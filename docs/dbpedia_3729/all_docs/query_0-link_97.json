Covid-19 provides a serious lesson\n\nfor doctors, politicians and economists in the whole world. There is\n\nstill much unknown about this virus. There is no experience with\n\nSARS-CoV-2, but virologists and clinicians have knowledge about\n\nand experience with other RNA viruses. There is in-depth knowl-\n\nedge about coronaviruses in veterinary medicine. There is experi-\n\nence in human medicine regarding other coronaviruses, especially\n\nconcerning SARS and MERS. People have experience in producing\n\nvaccines against RNA viruses, and these vaccines are effective in\n\nboth human and veterinary medicine. And yet – we are not able\n\nto answer the main question: how long and persistent will the im-\n\nmunity of people against SARC-CoV-2 be? We have only the views\n\nand insights of the most distinguished specialists in the world, but\n\nsometimes these are controversial points of view. And we believe a\n\nscientist or a school who, to our mind, is more persuasive or whose\n\nachievements have been acknowledged, or for example, the Nobel\n\nPrize awarded. We believe high impact journals and we are used to\n\ntrust them. And we also listen to information we want to believe –\n\nfor example, I read articles about viruses with great interest – and\n\nlearn that the virus is self-limited, it will become less aggressive, less\n\ninfectious, and people will have milder virus symptoms in the near\n\nfuture. I understand there is no convincing evidence for it, but I am\n\neager to believe it.\n\nWe, doctors, are not protected from disinformation, and a promi-\n\nnent doctor may cause a chain reaction, when subject to disinfor-\n\nmation. It is enough to come forth with exaggerated messages in\n\nserious non-medical news channels; and many doctors also start\n\nbelieving it. It is time the World Medical Association, the largest\n\nand most serious forum of doctors, takes the initiative and defines\n\ncertain things. The need of staying 6 feet apart is to be repeated\n\nevery day, just as the requirement not to scream, not to sing and not\n\nto be sneezed at.The virus spreads much better indoors, and people\n\nmust use the opportunity to communicate more outdoors. It must\n\nbe understood that the world population is not prepared to accept\n\nany longer communication restrictions. We must teach people how\n\nimportant it is to treat their chronic diseases – diabetes, asthma,\n\ncardiovascular diseases, hypertension – so that the virus does not\n\nkill them.\n\nA key issue for the medical world will be attitudes toward newly\n\ncreated vaccines. If I was able to trust the Oxford researchers in\n\nmoving towards a vaccine, I could not believe the news that military\n\npersonnel are already being vaccinated against Covid-19 in some\n\nmajor post-socialist states. And indeed, we have no chance of pre-\n\ndicting whether we can expect long-lasting and permanent immu-\n\nnity of the SARS-CoV- 2 virus to vaccines. And we don’t know if\n\npeople have cross-immunity to coronavirus.\n\nAnd in the end, we do not know how expensive, safe and effective\n\nthe vaccine will be, and whether there will be enough of it for all\n\nthe people of the world, both – in rich and poor countries.The virus\n\ndoes not recognize national borders.\n\nOne thing is clear.The World Medical Association should renew its\n\ncooperation with the World Veterinary Association without delay\n\nand raise the concept ‘One World, One Health’ to a new level. We\n\nhave zoonoses and and we will have to face zoonoses in the near\n\nand distant future.The more the people in this world produce meat\n\nfor their own consumption, the more industrial the keeping of pet\n\nanimals and meat production will become. The more high-density\n\ndomestic animal farming develops, the more likely the outbreaks of\n\nzoonoses. Covid-19 reminded the world about hygiene and clean-\n\nliness. Maybe it is time to discuss globally modern standards for\n\nhygiene.\n\nDr. med. h. c. Peteris Apinis,\n\nEditor-in-Chief of the World Medical Journal\n\nBACK TO CONTENTS\n\n2\n\nDeclaration of Geneva\n\nPractising Medicine\n\n“with conscience\n\nand dignity”\n\nBeginning with the Declaration of Ge-\n\nneva (the Declaration), for over 70 years\n\nthe World Medical Association (WMA)\n\nhas maintained that physicians must prac-\n\ntise medicine with conscience and dignity\n\n[1]. On the Declaration’s 70th anniversary,\n\nseven associate WMA members raised seri-\n\nous concerns about their ability to remain in\n\nmedical practice if they fulfil this obligation\n\nby refusing to support or collaborate in the\n\nkilling of their patients by euthanasia and\n\nassisted suicide (EAS)[2].\n\nThe physicians practise in Canada, where\n\neuthanasia and assisted suicide (EAS)\n\nare legal, [3,4] recognized as therapeutic\n\nmedical services by the national medical\n\nassociation [5,6] and provided through a\n\npublic health care system controlled by\n\nthe state, which also regulates medical\n\npractice and medical ethics. The national\n\ngovernment is now poised to make EAS\n\navailable for any serious and incurable\n\nmedical condition, vastly increasing the\n\nnumber of patients legally eligible for the\n\nservice [7].\n\nIn these circumstances, it is urgent to reas-\n\nsert that the duty to practise medicine “with\n\nconscience and dignity”includes unyielding\n\nrefusal to do what one believes to be wrong\n\neven in the face of overwhelming pressure\n\nexerted by the state, the medico-legal estab-\n\nlishment and even by medical leaders and\n\ncolleagues. That the founders of the WMA\n\nnot only supported but expected such prin-\n\ncipled obstinacy is evident in the WMA’s\n\nearly history and the development of the\n\nDeclaration, all of which remain surpris-\n\ningly relevant.\n\nEarly Developments: 1945–46\n\nA meeting of physicians from 30 coun-\n\ntries in London in June 1945 discussed\n\nthe formation of an international medical\n\nassociation [8, 9]. Some continental physi-\n\ncians spoke of crimes by physicians in their\n\ncountries during the war [10], and over the\n\nnext 18 months the world medical commu-\n\nnity became increasingly aware of physician\n\nparticipation in crimes against humanity [8,\n\n11, 12].\n\nNational medical association delegates re-\n\nturning London in September 1946 were\n\nuneasy and ambivalent about plans to na-\n\ntionalize health care systems in Britain and\n\nthe Continent. On the one hand, they wel-\n\ncomed the growing interest in medicine by\n\ngovernments around the world.On the oth-\n\ner, they worried about the consequences of\n\n(as later expressed) transforming all physi-\n\ncians into “Civil Servants controlled by the\n\nState” [13, 14]. They conceived an interna-\n\ntional medical association as support for na-\n\ntional associations defending practitioners\n\nand patients from government demands.\n\nThey reminded the British health minister\n\nthat physicians treat human beings, not col-\n\nlections of tissue, and must practise with “a\n\ndiscipline of the heart that makes it difficult\n\nto integrate [them] into the State machine”\n\n[15].\n\nWhile delegates were motivated to or-\n\nganize the WMA by concerns about the\n\nprofession-state relationship, they were also\n\ndeeply disturbed by physician participation\n\nin war crimes [8].\n\nIn the month following the London gath-\n\nering, twenty German physicians were ar-\n\nraigned in Nuremberg [13]. And the or-\n\nganizing committee drafted the WMA\n\nconstitution and prepared for the first\n\nGeneral Assembly while the Nuremberg\n\n“Doctors Trial”was in session.Reports from\n\nThe WMA and the Foundations of Medical Practice.\n\nDeclaration of Geneva (1948), International Code of Medical\n\nEthics (1949)\n\nSean Murphy Ramona Coelho Philippe D. Violette Ewan C Goligher Timothy Lau Sheila Rutledge\n\nHarding\n\nCANADA\n\nBACK TO CONTENTS\n\n3\n\nDeclaration of Geneva\n\nthe trial resonated deeply with physicians\n\nanxious about being integrated into a “State\n\nmachine” [16,17,18,19].\n\nFirst General Assembly:\n\nWar Crimes and Medicine\n\n(September 1947)\n\nPhysician war crimes dominated the agenda\n\nof the first WMA General Assembly, dis-\n\nplacing discussion of the profession-state\n\nrelationship. Delegates heard impassioned\n\ntestimony from physician victims of the\n\nThird Reich and received the BMA report,\n\nWar Crimes and Medicine [20, 21, 22].\n\nThe report denounced physicians respon-\n\nsible for crimes against humanity as lack-\n\ning “moral and professional conscience,”\n\ncondemning them for having allowed the\n\nstate to use medical knowledge and sci-\n\nence as “instruments of wanton destruction\n\nin the pursuit of war.” It asked the WMA\n\nto endorse the prosecution of physicians\n\nfor war crimes and adopt a World Charter\n\nof Medicine, explicitly reaffirming medi-\n\ncal ethics “in the spirit of the Hippocratic\n\nOath,” suggesting that medical graduation\n\nshould include a promise to adhere to the\n\nCharter [10].\n\nThe Assembly accepted the recommenda-\n\ntions and approved a public apology and\n\nundertaking to be required of the German\n\nMedical Association as a condition for\n\nadmission to the WMA. It also approved\n\nan oath affirming that a physician’s first\n\nduty is to care for a patient, “to resist any\n\nill treatment that may be inflicted on him”\n\nand “to refuse my consent to any authority\n\nthat requires me to ill-treat him.” Finally, it\n\nappointed a committee to produce a report\n\nabout war crimes [23, 24].\n\nOver the following year, the war crimes\n\ncommittee solicited forms of medical en-\n\ngagement from national associations with a\n\nview to formulating an international medi-\n\ncal oath. The WMA Council also agreed\n\nto develop an international code of medi-\n\ncal ethics, concerned that jurists reacting\n\nto physician war crimes might do so if the\n\nWMA did not [24,25].\n\nSecond & Third\n\nGeneral Assemblies\n\nDeclaration of Geneva (September 1948),\n\nInternational Code of Medical Ethics\n\n(September 1949)\n\nAt the second WMA General Assembly,\n\ndelegates were presented with War Crimes\n\nand Medicine: The German Betrayal and a\n\nRe-statement of Medical Ethics. It urged\n\nthe Assembly to prevent physician crimes\n\nagainst humanity by reaffirming basic Hip-\n\npocratic principles, which, it argued, would\n\nbe universally acceptable. Requiring medi-\n\ncal graduates to abide by a modern version\n\nof the Hippocratic Oath would help to im-\n\npress them with the fundamentals of medi-\n\ncal ethics. The suggested modern version,\n\ncontaining ten promises, was approved by\n\nthe Assembly and published as the Decla-\n\nration of Geneva [26].\n\nThe Second General Assembly also ap-\n\nproved the development of an international\n\ncode of medical ethics. The final version,\n\nwhich included the Declaration of Geneva,\n\nwas approved at the Third General Assem-\n\nbly in 1949 [27].\n\nRefusing the fatal surrender of conscience\n\nThe documents make clear that what the\n\nauthors of the Declaration and the ICME\n\nmeant by practising medicine “with con-\n\nscience and dignity” was not only doing\n\nwhat one believes to be right, or only doing\n\nwhat one believes to be best for patients,but\n\nrefusing “to make the easy and fatal surren-\n\nder of one’s conscience to the mass mind of\n\nthe totalitarian state” (18). A British physi-\n\ncian responding to the BMA report on war\n\ncrimes commented:\n\nDuring the terrible years of occupation by a\n\nbrutal enemy the large majority of doctors of\n\nmost of the occupied countries maintained\n\ntheir moral integrity, their unswerving loy-\n\nalty to their patients, and their spiritual and\n\nprofessional freedom, even at the risk of tor-\n\nture and death. They thereby set a great ex-\n\nample and vindicated the honour of their pro-\n\nfession [19].\n\nAccording to Leo Alexander, writing a year\n\nlater, just before the ICME was adopted,\n\nDutch physicians collectively demonstrated\n\nsuch heroism [28]. Steadfast refusal to do\n\nwhat one believes to be wrong was under-\n\nstood to be central to practising medicine\n\n“with conscience and dignity,” an essential\n\nsafeguard for personal and professional in-\n\ntegrity and patients.\n\nThat was then; this is now\n\nIt is easy to understand this duty in rela-\n\ntion to refusing to comply with the mur-\n\nderous dictates of a totalitarian regime that\n\nhave been universally derided for decades.\n\nIt is more difficult to see why it should\n\napply to refusing to provide legal services\n\nrequested by patients in a democracy. The\n\ndifficulty disappears once one admits that\n\nboth totalitarian and democratic regimes\n\ncan make grave moral errors in law and\n\npublic policy.\n\nEvents in Germany from 1920 to 1945\n\ndemonstrate that physicians willingly en-\n\nlisted and collaborated in the implementa-\n\ntion of a biopolitical ideology thought to\n\nbe on the cutting edge of science and pro-\n\ngressive ideas. Exactly the same thing has\n\nhappened elsewhere and is likely to happen\n\nagain. When it does, the medical profession\n\nis likely to be most accommodating and\n\neven anxious to participate to ensure that\n\nthe state “gets it right.”\n\nAt issue here is the freedom, integrity, dig-\n\nnity and obligations of individual physi-\n\ncians who are convinced that the profession\n\nand the state have got it wrong, yet face\n\nCANADA\n\nBACK TO CONTENTS\n\n4\n\n­\n\ndemands that they participate in activities\n\nthat they reasonably believe to be immoral\n\nor contrary to good medical practice.\n\nThen…\n\nWhen the Nazi regime was installed, of-\n\nficials of the largest German medical as-\n\nsociations “gladly” welcomed it and placed\n\nthemselves at its service, celebrating the\n\nintimate links of the medical profession\n\nwith “the wisdom and aims of the State”.\n\nThose intimate links were reflected in the\n\nlaw directing compulsory sterilisation of\n\nthose with “genetic illnesses” (including al-\n\ncoholism and mental deficiency) enacted in\n\nresponse to a petition from the associations\n\n[29]. Physicians sterilized about 300,000\n\npersons before the war, and began killing\n\nthe handicapped when the war began, a\n\nproject supported directly and indirectly by\n\ncolleagues and scientists [30].\n\nPhysicians were predisposed to cooperate\n\nbecause they were convinced of the value of\n\neugenics. Eugenics was a widely accepted\n\nscientific discipline, “on the cutting edge of\n\nscience”, supported by respected scholars,\n\nvarious scientific disciplines, major univer-\n\nsities and scholarly journals [30, 31]. The\n\neugenics movement propagated the belief\n\nthat people inherited not only eye and hair\n\ncolour,but were criminals,or rich,poor,lazy,\n\nindustrious,promiscuous or faithful because\n\nthey were “born that way”[32].Leading sci-\n\nentists and activists campaigned to prevent\n\nthe reproduction of such “defectives” by\n\ncontraception and sterilization of “inferior\n\ntypes,” including the mentally ill, physically\n\nhandicapped, criminals, and certain “degen-\n\nerate” races [33,34].\n\nEugenics was popular among the socially\n\nelite, including Winston Churchill, Herbert\n\nHoover and Alexander Graham Bell (35).\n\nEugenic societies and scientists successfully\n\nlobbied for laws authorizing voluntary or\n\ncompulsory sterilization of “defectives”, in-\n\ncluding criminals,the mentally handicapped\n\nand mentally ill; 27 US states had such laws\n\nin 1931.By 1935 sterilization laws had been\n\nadopted in Canada, Denmark, Switzerland,\n\nGermany, Norway and Sweden [36].\n\nEugenics was especially influential in Ger-\n\nmany after the First World War [37] and\n\nwas absorbed into Nazi party policy. Since\n\nphysicians were among eugenics’ foremost\n\nexponents, to hear Nazi policy described\n\nas “nothing but applied biology” was es-\n\npecially attractive to them. Hence, many\n\nwillingly joined the vanguard of what be-\n\ncame “the most ambitious and murderous\n\neugenics program in human history”. Their\n\ncharacteristic response was not just acqui-\n\nescence, but “eager and active cooperation”\n\n[31,38,39].\n\nSuch eagerness was not limited to German\n\nphysicians. In 1936, the Canadian Medical\n\nAssociation Journal featured a lengthy es-\n\nsay on the superiority of the Aryan/Nordic\n\nRace by an author who, the year before, had\n\nheld up Germany as a model for other na-\n\ntions and toasted Adolph Hitler as “a great\n\nleader” [40,41]. Two years earlier it had\n\npublished a glowing report about eugenic\n\nsterilizations authorized by the Alberta Eu-\n\ngenics Board [42].\n\nOver 44 years Alberta physicians steril-\n\nized 2,822 people at the Board’s direction\n\n[43].A court reviewing its operations found\n\nthat it had routinely flouted the law, and, as\n\nlate as the early 1960’s, physicians had per-\n\nformed illegal sterilizations and medically\n\nunnecessary castrations, hysterectomies,\n\noophorectomies and biopsies of testicular\n\ntissue, behaviour the judge described as\n\n“unlawful, offensive and outrageous”. He\n\nexcoriated one Board geneticist for, among\n\nother things,encouraging the use of persons\n\nwith Down Syndrome as “medical guinea\n\npigs” [44]. However, she had “no regrets,”\n\ndefending her activities as “a very reasonable\n\napproach to a very difficult problem” [45].\n\nAwarded the Order of Canada and other\n\nhonours [46, 47, 48], she was eulogized in\n\n2014 as one of Canada’s most respected ge-\n\nneticists (49).\n\nEven as the Alberta court was ruling on the\n\nAlberta Eugenics Board, Alberto Fujimori\n\nwas mobilizing physicians in Peru for the\n\nNational Program for Reproductive Health\n\nand Family Planning. By the time it ended\n\nfour years later, 200,000 to 300,000 people\n\nhad been sterilised, most without valid con-\n\nsent: some forcibly, others bribed or threat-\n\nened by government officials or health care\n\npersonnel. Most victims were poor and of-\n\nten illiterate women from indigenous ethnic\n\ngroups. The technical standard of medical\n\ncare was often appalling, and numbers of\n\nwomen died [50, 51, 52, 53].\n\nThe WMA’s denunciation of coercive steril-\n\nization came 12 years too late for Fujimori’s\n\nvictims [54]. In the United States, Oregon\n\nabolished its eugenic sterilization law only\n\nin 1983, and another 20 years passed be-\n\nfore the state acknowledged the injustice\n\nsuffered by victims sterilized according to\n\nthe ethical standards of the day [55]. The\n\nTuskegee Syphilis Study continued until\n\nit was exposed in 1972, the same year the\n\nAlberta Eugenics Board was abolished. It\n\ntook almost 25 years for victims to receive a\n\npublic apology for unethical human experi-\n\nmentation [56, 57].\n\nIn 2012, when a generation of German\n\nphysicians unconnected with the Nazi\n\nera admitted the enthusiastic participa-\n\ntion of German physicians at all levels of\n\nthe profession in crimes against humanity,\n\napologized, begged forgiveness, and de-\n\nscribed what their predecessors had done\n\n“as a warning for the present and the fu-\n\nture” [58].\n\nThe warning points, in the first place, to\n\nthe risk of sea changes with incalculable\n\nconsequences. It appears that the Ger-\n\nman medical profession’s eugenic outlook\n\nand interests converged with other social\n\nand political dynamics and Hitler’s rise to\n\npower. The convergence triggered a sud-\n\nden, seismic socio-political shift that su-\n\npercharged Nazi biopolitical ideology. The\n\nmedical profession rapidly transformed\n\nDeclaration of Geneva CANADA\n\nBACK TO CONTENTS\n\n5\n\nitself and was transformed to fulfil its new\n\nbiopolitical responsibilities [29], and new\n\npossibilities suddenly materialized [59].\n\nCarl Jung experienced this as an “earth-\n\nquake” and an “avalanche” that was sweep-\n\ning all before it [60].\n\nSecond, the warning reminds us that mod-\n\nern biopolitical ideologies are advocated\n\nworldwide by lobbyists as prominent, pow-\n\nerful and influential as the eugenic enthusi-\n\nasts of yesteryear.\n\nFinally, we are warned that state collabora-\n\ntion with the medical profession in support\n\nof faulty biopolitical ideologies is far more\n\ndangerous than the exercise of freedom of\n\nconscience by individual physicians.Literal-\n\nly millions have suffered and died as victims\n\nof what seemed like a good idea at the time,\n\nat least in the eyes of those in positions of\n\npower and influence.\n\nNow…\n\nThe euthanasia/assisted suicide (EAS)\n\nmovement backs a biopolitical ideology\n\nthat is enormously popular in the developed\n\nworld, now entrenched in Canadian law\n\nand collectively supported by the medical\n\nprofession.This has serious implications for\n\nthe nature of medical practice.\n\nLeading Canadian EAS advocates told the\n\nSupreme Court of Canada that physicians\n\nare ideal EAS practitioners because they\n\nwill agree to it only “as a last resort” [61].\n\nIndeed, they argued that “physician-assisted\n\ndying” is not only “medical treatment,” but\n\n“at the core of health care” [62]. This must\n\nplace killing patients at the core of the prac-\n\ntice of medicine and require transformation\n\nof the medical profession to fulfil its role in\n\nthe new order. How far this will go remains\n\nto be seen.\n\nPhysicians cannot currently be compelled\n\nto personally administer or prescribe lethal\n\ndrugs, though some prominent academics\n\nargue that should change [63,64]. However,\n\nthe national government allows state medi-\n\ncal regulators to compel unwilling practitio-\n\nners to facilitate EAS by effective referral\n\n[65] or effective transfer of care [66], which\n\neven some strong supporters of the proce-\n\ndures acknowledge to be morally equivalent\n\nto personally killing patients [64,67,68].\n\nCourts in the province of Ontario support\n\nthis coercive policy, ruling that physicians\n\nunwilling to comply can move into fields\n\nlike sleep medicine, hair restoration and\n\ndermatology [69].\n\nUnsurprisingly, some academics recom-\n\nmend that medical schools deny admit-\n\ntance to anyone with conscientious ob-\n\njections to providing whatever the state\n\nconsiders medical treatment or health care,\n\nincluding EAS [70]. Anecdotal reports\n\nindicate that some dissenting medical stu-\n\ndents face intense pressure to conform to\n\nthe EAS biopolitical agenda, experienc-\n\ning isolation, disregard and disdain among\n\ntheir peers (71).\n\nNo wonder Canadian physicians who refuse\n\nto support or collaborate in killing their pa-\n\ntients feel themselves to be in the midst of a\n\nsocio-political and ethical avalanche.\n\nSumming up\n\nThe historical record suggests that support\n\nfor physicians who refuse to kill or facilitate\n\nthe killing of their patients is justifiable on\n\nprudential and pragmatic grounds. Tolerat-\n\ning refusal to participate in killing seems to\n\nbe a safer course than imposing an obliga-\n\ntion to kill and is certainly consistent with\n\nthe high value EAS advocates have placed\n\non physician reluctance to kill as a primary\n\nsafeguard for patients.\n\nAs a matter of principle, one must dis-\n\ntinguish what is demonstrably necessary\n\nto preserve a free and democratic society\n\nfrom what may be necessary to enforce a\n\nbiopolitical ideology. The difference is sig-\n\nnificant but can be difficult to discern in an\n\navalanche. EAS ideology is grounded upon\n\nmetaphysical, philosophical and moral\n\npremises that can be rationally contested\n\nbut cannot be empirically validated. Among\n\nthese is the dogmatic claim that a human\n\nbeing can be better off dead. In a free and\n\ndemocratic society, it ought to be unac-\n\nceptable to force physicians to profess this\n\narticle of faith, or to demonstrate practical\n\nadherence to it by killing or facilitating the\n\nkilling of a patient.\n\nFinally, there is an issue that goes to the\n\nheart of what concerned the authors of the\n\nDeclaration of Geneva.\n\nCompetent patients may refuse even life-\n\nsaving/sustaining interventions based en-\n\ntirely on their subjective views of what is\n\nbeneficial, harmful, or in their best interests.\n\nPhysicians ensure that patients have infor-\n\nmation relevant to such decisions and may\n\nmake recommendations, but they are legally\n\nand ethically obliged to respect patients’ in-\n\nviolability and abide by their decision. The\n\nfoundations of medical ethics and the per-\n\nsonal integrity of physicians who disagree\n\nare untouched by the patient’s decision.\n\nWhile competent patients can absolutely\n\nrefuse interventions, they cannot demand\n\ninterventions because medical decisions to\n\nintervene are not based solely upon patients’\n\ndemands [72]. Among other things, they\n\nengage physicians as moral agents.\n\nPatients request an intervention, including\n\neuthanasia, because they believe it is not\n\nharmful, is beneficial, or is in their best in-\n\nterests. Physicians may reasonably disagree.\n\nIf, despite this, physicians are compelled to\n\nfurther a patient’s request, the concepts of\n\nbenefit, harm and best interest become ir-\n\nrelevant. All that remains is the demand of\n\nthe patient,backed by the power of the state\n\nto ensure compliance.\n\nThis treats physicians as mere technicians\n\nor state functionaries, as cogs in a state ma-\n\nchine delivering services upon demand, not\n\nas responsible moral agents who, like their\n\nDeclaration of Geneva\n\nCANADA\n\nBACK TO CONTENTS\n\n6\n\npatients, must form and act upon judge-\n\nments about benefits and harms. It imposes\n\na form of servitude that is incompatible\n\nwith human equality, dignity and personal\n\nand professional integrity.\n\nThe authors of the Declaration and ICME\n\ndenounced such instrumentalization of\n\nphysicians and the medical profession in\n\nthe strongest terms. The precept to practise\n\nmedicine with conscience and dignity im-\n\nposes an obligation to resist and refuse such\n\ndemands, notwithstanding overwhelming\n\npressures exerted even in democratic soci-\n\neties.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

A recently published study [3]\n\nbased on 2017 country data showed the\n\nsame categories were now 24% and 7%.\n\nIn the WHO Global Atlas Canada was rat-\n\ned as having “advanced integration of pallia-\n\ntive care into mainstream service provision.”\n\nI believe this is overly generous and would\n\nsay that Canada, like many other countries,\n\nsuffers from lack of integration of palliative\n\ncare into chronic illness care, particularly\n\nnon-cancer, and has a long way to go be-\n\nfore claiming equitable service and quality\n\nacross urban, rural and remote areas.\n\nOne issue raised by Canadian clinicians is\n\nnot having palliative care symptom man-\n\nagement guidelines or communication tips\n\non hand when seeing patients. Our pallia-\n\ntive care program developed an app so cli-\n\nnicians would have essential palliative care\n\nknowledge at their fingertips. The app de-\n\nsign follows similar thinking formats used\n\nin medicine – assess, manage, communicate,\n\nplan. A website-based app allows us to add\n\ncontent without users having to down-\n\nload current versions. St. Paul’s Hospital\n\nFoundation in Vancouver Canada funded\n\nthis development and continues to fund\n\nthe costs of maintenance in order to keep\n\ncontent free. It was launched in 2014 and\n\ncontinues to be used on a regular basis by\n\ndoctors, nurses, social workers and others\n\nthroughout North America. It is accessible\n\nat ipalapp.com and can be “bookmarked” or\n\nits icon added to the home screen of a de-\n\nvice. It is also usable on a desktop computer.\n\nAfter launching and reviewing usage data\n\nwe realized many users were from parts of\n\nthe world where the palliative care chal-\n\nlenges and available medications may be\n\nsignificantly different.Thus iPal Global was\n\nborn with some significant differences.\n\niPal Global is a downloadable app that pro-\n\nvides access to essential palliative care infor-\n\nmation without requiring continuous inter-\n\nnet access. The app uses the International\n\nAssociation for Hospice and Palliative Care\n\n(IAHPC) List of Essential Medicines for\n\nPalliative Care – the most effective and safe\n\ncommonly available medicines throughout\n\nthe world. The content of the app has been\n\nreviewed and revised by clinicians working\n\nwith Two Worlds Cancer Collaboration to\n\nensure its content is relevant to resource\n\nconstrained countries.\n\nThe app contains advice on when a pallia-\n\ntive approach to care is indicated and con-\n\ntains basic assessment and management of\n\n22 symptoms, as well as managing the last\n\nhours of living. The app features advice for\n\nplanning future care and decision-making.\n\nThe Communication section, is intended to\n\nimprove therapeutic efficacy of communi-\n\ncating as well as give suggested approaches\n\nto specific situations such as breaking bad\n\nnews, discussing prognosis and deciding on\n\ngoals of care in managing an illness. Talk\n\nPalliative Care: Free App and Tips to\n\nImprove Quality of Care\n\nRomayne Gallagher\n\nCANADA\n\nBACK TO CONTENTS\n\n10\n\ntips are placed throughout the app in ap-\n\npropriate situations.\n\nDownloading the app requires 15 Mb\n\nof memory so it is quite modest for most\n\nphones. Go to the website: https://global.\n\nipalapp.com where you will find links to\n\ndownload the app to your smart phone, tab-\n\nlet or desktop computer.\n\nThe apps are applicable to COVID-19 as\n\nmany people can suffer with shortness of\n\nbreath if they develop Acute Respiratory\n\nDistress Syndrome as a consequence of a\n\nsevere infection. If available and appropri-\n\nate, ventilation is the next step. If not avail-\n\nable, or the person has multiple morbidities\n\nthe “Dyspnea” section under the heading\n\n“Manage”.\n\nImproving Palliative Care Takes\n\nMuch More than an App!\n\nMany colleagues struggle to improve pallia-\n\ntive care capacity in their healthcare system\n\nin resource-constrained nations. It is often a\n\nphysician or nurse who makes it their per-\n\nsonal mission to improve palliative care in\n\ntheir area and sacrifice a great deal of their\n\ntime and energy to make that happen for\n\npatients. That is not sustainable in the long\n\nterm because of personal burnout of the in-\n\ndividual and it doesn’t change the way the\n\nsystem provides care.\n\nThere is a greater likelihood of success in\n\nestablishing change if you form a group of\n\ninterested colleagues that includes nurses,\n\npharmacists, social workers, other allied\n\nprofessionals and administrators. Don’t for-\n\nget volunteers as no palliative care service is\n\ncomplete without volunteers. There may be\n\nalready people in the community who do vis-\n\nits to sick people and they can be invaluable\n\nin understanding the barriers to accessing\n\ncare and may even have workable solutions.\n\nEstablishing who and how many people\n\nneed palliative care is an essential first step.\n\nTo win support of administrators in the\n\nhospital and ministry and justify requests\n\nfor increased medication and salary support\n\nyou will need to show that there is an unmet\n\nneed.The Lancet Commission on Palliative\n\nCare [4] calculated the world-wide serious\n\nhealth-related suffering and developed a\n\npackage of resources to aid countries in de-\n\nveloping their palliative care. They defined\n\nserious health-related suffering as being\n\ncaused by illness or injury of any kind that\n\ncould be alleviated by palliative care or pain\n\nmanagement. One valuable resource is a da-\n\ntabase that estimates the number of patients\n\nneeding access to palliative care and you can\n\nfind your country at the database website on\n\nthe International Association for Palliative\n\nCare at https://hospicecare.com/what-we-do/\n\nresources/global-data-platform-to-calculate-\n\nshs-and-palliative-care-need/database/. You\n\nwill likely see that the estimate is greater\n\nthan what you thought it would be and that\n\nis because the estimate covers those who are\n\ndying from the illness as well as those living\n\nwith chronic illness.\n\nPalliative care home visits have repeatedly\n\nshown to reduce hospital admissions and\n\ncosts [5, 6] which is a significant help to the\n\nhealthcare system in any country. Reference\n\n5 is available in an infographic at: https://\n\nwww.capc.org/seminar/poster-sessions/home-\n\nbased-palliative-care-reduces-hospital-read-\n\nmissions/. Having an estimate of the need\n\nfor palliative care as well as evidence that\n\nit reduces visits and admissions to hospital\n\ncan help you to demonstrate a need for care\n\nin the community that deals with suffering,\n\nimproves quality of life and prevents hospi-\n\ntal admissions.\n\nIf you begin to treat more people’s pain\n\nand shortness of breath you will use more\n\nopioids. Opioids remain the medication\n\nof first choice for moderate to severe pain\n\nand shortness of breath due to advanced\n\nillness of any cause [7, 8]. My experience\n\nhas been that if doctors don’t use opioids,\n\nhospital and community pharmacists don’t\n\nstock them. If you talk to doctors, they say\n\ntheir prescriptions are not filled because the\n\npharmacy doesn’t have them. The pharma-\n\ncist says they have thrown out opioids that\n\nexpired and don’t want to do that again so\n\nthey don’t order them in. Working together\n\nalways sorts out these issues and ongoing\n\ncommunication is key to sorting out issues\n\nwith demand and supply.\n\nThe United States and Canada have expe-\n\nrienced an increase in opioid-related deaths\n\nover the past decade known as the “opioid\n\ncrisis”. It is a complex problem, not well\n\nunderstood by media and many healthcare\n\nproviders.While the focus of the “crisis”has\n\nbeen on opioids and how to reduce their use\n\nin and out of the healthcare system, there\n\nhas been a poisoning of the illicit opioid\n\nsupply by synthetic opioids (fentanyl and\n\nothers), great stigma around opioid use\n\ndisorder (addiction) and a lack access to\n\ntreatment for the disorder. It is not a simple\n\nrelationship that the more you prescribe\n\nthe more people are harmed. It is possible\n\nto treat pain and shortness of breath and\n\nkeep abuse of these medications to as low\n\nas possible. More about this in a subsequent\n\narticle.\n\nImproving the quality of the palliative care\n\nyou offer includes the use of validated tools\n\nfor assessing symptoms and tracking func-\n\ntion. It promotes a standardized assessment\n\nand tracks efficacy of the treatment. The\n\nmost widely used tool, available in many\n\nlanguages, is the Edmonton Symptom As-\n\nsessment Scale [9]. The reference is online\n\nand has a description of how to use the\n\ntool to improve quality of care. The Pallia-\n\ntive Performance Scale is a tool to measure\n\npatient function and progression of the\n\nillness. It is available on line at https://vic-\n\ntoriahospice.org/how-we-can-help/clinical-\n\ntools/ and has been widely translated. With\n\ntraining these tools could be used by vol-\n\nunteers checking up on patients at home\n\nwith serious illness to determine if a visit by\n\nthe healthcare professional is needed. This\n\nmeans that the doctor/nurse save their visits\n\nfor those who most need their help.\n\nCANADA\n\nPalliative Care\n\nBACK TO CONTENTS\n\n11\n\nCOVID-19\n\nGetting more education in palliative care\n\nfor your team is challenging as online cours-\n\nes do not have the evidence [10] to show\n\nthat they improve palliative care practice.\n\nParticipation in the learning such as a jour-\n\nnal club that reviews clinical articles regu-\n\nlarly may improve practice but the evidence\n\nis not there yet. Additionally, case review\n\nof patients, especially when the symptoms\n\nwere not well controlled or the death was\n\nnot well managed is essential. What tends\n\nto stick with physicians is experiential\n\nlearning where they encounter a clinical\n\nsituation (e.g. neuropathic pain) and seek\n\nevidence for its management. That is where\n\nthe app and some supplemental reading of\n\nmedical literature can boost your practice.\n\nMost healthcare providers find palliative\n\ncare work meaningful and rewarding. If\n\nburnout occurs it is usually due to the frus-\n\ntration and challenges of doing this work\n\n“off the side of your desk” or not being able\n\nto get the resources you need to do this\n\nwork in a sustainable way (salary, necessary\n\nmedications,support from colleagues etc…)\n\nIf you have a team you can share experienc-\n\nes and potential solutions as well as provide\n\nemotional support to each other.

How are you in this\n\ndifficult time? How are Brazilian doctors these\n\ndays?\n\nWe see that the situation worsens day by\n\nday. We have the second highest number of\n\ncases and soon will also rank second as to\n\nthe number of deaths. And we know that\n\nthe current numbers are undercounted. Be-\n\nsides this sanitary crisis, we had some years\n\nof a crisis in economy and, unfortunately,\n\nwe are also experiencing a political crisis,\n\nwith a polarized country and a President\n\nwho is against the recommendations from\n\nspecialists on how to face the COVID-19\n\npandemic. Physicians, nurses and other\n\nhealth personnel are trying to do their best\n\nto help those affected by the virus, but there\n\nis shortage of specialized people at public\n\nhospitals, lack of PPE, lack of reliable data\n\n(only seriously ill patients are tested) and\n\nspecialists are stigmatized by people in fear\n\nof being infected.\n\nBACK TO CONTENTS\n\n12\n\nCOVID-19\n\nAs I understand, you contact your fellow col-\n\nleagues, doctors around the world, almost every\n\nday. What is the mood among our friends – the\n\nleaders of National Medical Associations?\n\nThere is an enormous mobilization of medi-\n\ncal leaders around the world in order to\n\novercome all sort of obstacles to have effi-\n\ncient and safe working conditions. I am par-\n\nticularly following the group of NMAs that\n\nbelong to CONFEMEL (Confederation of\n\nMedical Entities of Ibero Latin America)\n\nand CMAAO (Confederation of Medical\n\nAssociations in Asia and Oceania). Despite\n\nthe difficulties, they are doing their work and\n\ntrying to build efficacy with great enthusiasm.\n\nWe know you as a distinguished psychiatrist,\n\nprofessor and a long-term specialist of the\n\nWorld Health Organization. As a special-\n\nist of such a kind, I must ask you, hasn’t the\n\n­\n\nCovid–19 pandemic caused a very large out-\n\nbreak of mental diseases in the world, defined\n\nby fear, ignorance, worry, the loss of loved ones?\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the needed\n\nconfinement at home brought out a series of\n\nmental health problems as well as new cases\n\nor worsening of previous mental disorders.\n\nAnxiety and different types of fears are\n\ncommon reactions when facing the possi-\n\nbility of infection and also after some weeks\n\nof quarantine.Depression and alcohol abuse\n\nare problems affecting the vulnerable ones.\n\nThe loss of someone close, economic loss or\n\nbecoming unemployed are factors contrib-\n\nuting to emotional distress.\n\nThere are many interesting articles in world lit-\n\nerature that solitude and isolation reduces non-\n\nspecific immunity, increases the risk of neurologi-\n\ncal and endocrinological diseases. Many people\n\nin the world now live more or less in isolation,\n\nquarantining. Doesn’t loneliness and isolation\n\nlead to depression, anxiety, and other psycho-\n\nlogical changes? Can these psychological chang-\n\nes become a cause for psychosomatic diseases?\n\nWe have to be careful when considering\n\nisolation or loneliness for a period of some\n\nmonths in comparison with an endless situ-\n\nation. As I have said before, we are observ-\n\ning anxiety, depression and other emotional\n\nreactions to the pandemic and the associ-\n\nated quarantine. That situation is also con-\n\ntributing to decreasing physical activity and\n\nthe consumption of non-healthy food,gain-\n\ning weight and potentially triggering some\n\nhealth problems. Sleep disorders have also\n\nbeen observed.\n\nIt is known that isolation and confinement in\n\nvery small spaces can lead to domestic violence\n\nand aggression. Isn’t the world threatened by a\n\nwave of violence as a response to lasting isola-\n\ntion?\n\nConfinement of people in not large spaces\n\nthat create difficulties to have privacy or for\n\na long period of time is associated with ris-\n\ning tensions among them, increase of irrita-\n\nbility, and potentially causing verbal and/or\n\nphysical aggression. Some couples can even\n\nexperience a serious marital crisis.\n\nWorld experience has shown that in difficult\n\ntimes like these people tend to pour out their\n\ndiscontent and aggression on relatives, doctors\n\nand pharmacists. Doctors around the world\n\noften become victims of negative feelings, not\n\nonly verbally, but they are attacked also physi-\n\ncally. What can we do to make doctors feel safe\n\nat such a moment of tension?\n\nWe see reports about people applauding\n\nhealth professionals and also reports about\n\nviolence against them. As regards safety,\n\npeople need to be informed in what difficult\n\nsituations professionals at the pandemic’s\n\nfrontline are, risking their lives to save oth-\n\ners. Physicians, nurses and other members\n\nof the health team also experience fears of\n\nbeing infected, to infect their relatives at\n\nhome, to die or not being able to save many\n\npatients they attend to.They are people like\n\nany other. When someone attacks health\n\nprofessionals, usually it is because of a\n\nwrong idea about getting infected from be-\n\ning in their presence.And if a health worker\n\nis attacked,it will be one less at the frontline\n\nhelping patients. Public campaigns are im-\n\nportant to educate people.\n\nFrom the experience of China and Italy, we\n\nknow that doctors are really exposed to the\n\ndisease, as it is very common to get sick with\n\n­\n\nCovid–19. Most doctors are very afraid of get-\n\nting sick,mainly because they can take the disease\n\nhome to their parents, relatives. The worrying\n\nabout a potential disease can be very serious.\n\nCan doctors in the world feel protected from the\n\nillness and feel more or less safe?\n\nGovernments and health managers have the\n\nresponsibility to offer good and safe work-\n\ning conditions to doctors and health work-\n\ners at the frontline. Adequate personal pro-\n\ntective equipment needs to be fully available\n\nand services need to take into account the\n\nrequired sufficient number of personnel so\n\nas not to expose one another to a bigger risk\n\nof being infected. Time off between shifts\n\nand breaks during shifts also contribute to\n\nrest and focus when returning to work.\n\nFrom the experience of China and Italy, we\n\nknow that doctors who face a large number of\n\nseverely ill Covid–19 patients daily are forced\n\nto make very difficult decisions – which patients\n\nshould be assisted to. Are doctors psychologically\n\nsupported and what can the World Medical As-\n\nsociation, National Medical Associations and\n\nGovernments do to maintain the psychological\n\nhealth of doctors?\n\nEven before the COVID-19 outbreak, there\n\nwere reports about increasing burnout among\n\nphysicians, particularly among those in\n\ntraining or with few years of practice. Good\n\nand safe working conditions protect physi-\n\ncians from psychological problems but even\n\nin rich countries there are situations where\n\nthey have to choose between patients – those\n\nwho will be placed in an Intensive Care Unit\n\nor not or have access to a ventilator. National\n\nMedical Associations and their specialized\n\nsocieties are developing guidelines with al-\n\ngorithms to help physicians be less subjective\n\nin their decision making and consequently\n\nBACK TO CONTENTS\n\n13\n\nCOVID-19\n\nexperience less psychological stress in that\n\nundesirable situation.\n\nCovid–19 has produced fantastic developments\n\nin science and research. Every day there is new\n\nresearch, new lessons, new information.There has\n\nnever been so much contradictory information\n\nabout one topic. How do doctors feel about this\n\ninformation flow and how to adapt to it?\n\nThere is an enormous effort from scientists\n\nworldwide to know better this new coronavi-\n\nrus and the pathophysiology of ­\n\nCOVID-19.\n\nThe world is anxious for a vaccine to prevent\n\nnew cases and the right medication to treat the\n\ndisease. Moreover, there are lots of researches\n\nbeing done to study human behavior during\n\nthe current pandemic and trying to figure out\n\nhow habits will change after the COVID-19\n\noutbreak. Unfortunately, good research takes\n\ntime to achieve results that will last and not be\n\ncontradicted by another research.And doctors\n\nknow it better than anyone not familiar with\n\nthe development of science. What is impor-\n\ntant – science was not properly considered or\n\neven rejected before this pandemic and now\n\nwe see people more interested and recogniz-\n\ning the importance of science development.\n\nIn the world, not only doctors and patients have\n\nconversations in Zoom, Skype or over the tele-\n\nphone, but also the relationship between doc-\n\ntors, their mutual advice and communication\n\nis remote. Do we not lose much of the human\n\ncommunication qualities? Don’t our doctors lose\n\nprofessional ties? Maybe we need psychotherapy\n\nfor the all-global medical community?\n\nDifferent forms of telemedicine and the\n\nutility of remote work are tested during the\n\nsituation the world is experiencing since the\n\noutbreak that started in China.I am sure that\n\nit will affect the work of everybody and our\n\nwork as physicians as well. As a psychiatrist\n\nand psychotherapist, I do not believe that a\n\nvirtual consultation will give us all we can\n\nhave when in the physical presence of our\n\npatients. Unfortunately, sometimes physical\n\nexamination is replaced by labs and images,\n\nand the patient as a person loses importance\n\nto the signs and symptoms they present.Evi-\n\ndence based diagnosis and treatment are of\n\ngreat importance but the human contact is\n\nan essential aspect of the practice of medi-\n\ncine.Telemedicine can be a wonderful tool to\n\ncomplement the possibilities of an encounter\n\nbetween a physician and their patient.\n\nYour final remarks?\n\nI believe that the most important thing that\n\nthe COVID-19 outbreak brought to us was\n\nthe astonishing awareness of how unequal\n\nis the world we live in. We discussed in the\n\nprevious questions situations that can be\n\nmore applicable to privileged people but we\n\nmust think about those who live in low and\n\nmiddle income countries and even in the\n\noutskirts of cities or urban areas of rich coun-\n\ntries.Think about those who do not have ac-\n\ncess to health services or have limited and\n\ndifficult access to not too good quality medi-\n\ncal services. At this particular time, during\n\nthe current pandemic,while I am here,in my\n\nsmall but comfortable apartment, answering\n\nquestions, typing on my computer, there are\n\nmillions of people fighting to survive in this\n\ndifficult situation. There are cultures were\n\nphilanthropy is not rare and I do not know\n\nabout every country but I have never seen\n\npeople being mobilized to do something or\n\nto donate a considerable amount of money\n\nto the underprivileged as nowadays in my\n\ncountry, Brazil. I hope and wish that such\n\nattitudes will increase and reach every corner\n\nof the world.\n\nThe World Health Organization is re-\n\nporting this June 2020, that there are over\n\n6 million cases globally of COVID-19\n\nwith over 380,000 deaths and the human\n\ncost of this pandemic could be extraordi-\n\nnary [1]. It is important to shine a lens on\n\nthe potential impact of the pandemic on\n\nWomen’s Health Issues and the Sustain-\n\nable Development Goal of reaching Zero\n\nUnmet Need for Contraception by 2030.\n\nUnplanned teenage pregnancy is a global\n\nhealth issue, a women’s health issue, and a\n\nhuman rights issue.\n\nThe Nairobi Summit on ICPD+25 held in\n\nNovember 2019 had a major theme, Reach-\n\ning Zero Unmet Need for Family Planning\n\nby 2030. At that time, in Developing coun-\n\ntries 214 million women did not have access\n\nto modern contraception and thus, become\n\npregnant as young adolescents, often while\n\nthey are still in school. There still exists a\n\ndisparity in contraceptive use between the\n\nhigh and middle-low countries, even within\n\nAfrican countries, and between the higher\n\nand lower income quintiles within coun-\n\ntries. The economic and physical disrup-\n\ntions related to COVID-19 could have vast\n\nconsequences for the sexual and reproduc-\n\ntive rights and health of women and girls,\n\na new analysis by UNFPA and partners\n\nshows.The pandemic will undermine efforts\n\nto end gender-based violence and limit the\n\nprogress of ending gender-based violence by\n\n2030 [2].For every 3 months the lockdown\n\ncontinues, assuming high levels of disrup-\n\ntion, up to 2 million women may be unable\n\nto use modern contraception. Significant\n\nlevels of lockdown-related disruption over\n\n3 months could leave 47 million women in\n\nWhat is the potential impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on\n\nAchieving the Sustainable Development Goal of Reaching Zero\n\nUnmet Need for Contraception by 2030?\n\nBACK TO CONTENTS\n\n14\n\nPadmini Murthy\n\nBev Johnson Deborah Bateson Marion Okoh-Owusu\n\nlow- and middle-income countries unable\n\nto use modern contraceptives, leading to a\n\nprojected 7 million additional unintended\n\npregnancies [2].In the most severe scenario,\n\nwith significant service disruptions lasting\n\nfor a full year, 51 million women would be\n\nunable to use modern contraceptives, re-\n\nsulting in 15 million unintended pregnan-\n\ncies [2]. During the past 4-5 months, the​\n\nCOVID-19, a highly infectious virus that\n\nwe do not have a vaccine for yet, has spread\n\nto every corner of the world.\n\nDr. Natalia Kanem, Executive Director\n\nof the United Nations Population Fund\n\n(UNFPA) stated “This new data shows the\n\ncatastrophic impact that COVID-19 could\n\nsoon have on women and girls globally. The\n\npandemic is deepening inequalities, and mil-\n\nlions more women and girls now risk losing\n\nthe ability to plan their families and protect\n\ntheir bodies and their health,” said Dr. Na-\n\ntalia Kanem, UNFPA Executive Director.\n\n“Women’s reproductive health and rights\n\nmust be safeguarded at all costs.The services\n\nmust continue; the supplies must be deliv-\n\nered; and the vulnerable must be protected\n\nand supported [3].” ​\n\nSome clinics may not\n\nhave the Personal Protective Equipment\n\n(PPE) to protect themselves or the patients\n\nand staff illness may impact service provi-\n\nsion. Staff will need to focus on COVID-19\n\npatient care and may not have the resources\n\nto provide contraceptive advice and services.\n\nThe function of supply chains in some coun-\n\ntries has been disrupted with the closure of\n\nborders and production of some contracep-\n\ntives have been disrupted. It is essential to\n\nensure supply chains of contraceptive prod-\n\nucts so that there is unimpeded flow from\n\nmanufacturer to the patient.FP2020 has cre-\n\nated a platform to ensure information from\n\nglobal experts about family planning [4].\n\nKey action points to consider maintenance of\n\nessential Family Planning services during the\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic have been published\n\nby the International Federation of Obstetrics\n\nand Gynecology [5].These include an urgent\n\nneed to use points of care such as postpar-\n\ntum and prenatal visits for providing educa-\n\ntion and access to long acting reversible con-\n\ntraceptive (LARC) options. Also, self-care\n\nfamily planning methods which include self\n\ninjectables,condoms and vaginal rings which\n\ncan be supplied to women are important.\n\nImplementation of telemedicine using mo-\n\nbile phones and social media can be used for\n\nboth information and access to supplies [5]\n\nAdolescents are particularly vulnerable in the\n\npandemic as they may have restricted ability\n\nto seek services away from home but there\n\nare opportunities to remove some barriers to\n\ncare with use of telemedicine.\n\nContraception is a human right for adoles-\n\ncent girls,and healthy families are by choice,\n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\non Family Planning requires a collaborative\n\nand novel approach so that we can continue\n\nto strive towards Zero Unmet Need for\n\nContraception by 2030.\n\nMedical Women’s International Association\n\n(MWIA): Teenage Pregnancy Task Force\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Importantly, it includes the range of\n\nsocio-economic activities undertaken by an\n\nindividual or group of persons in the process\n\nof accessing medical care/health care ser-\n\nvices outside his/her country of residence.\n\nThese activities,which are usually undertak-\n\nen after completion of the primary medical\n\nprocedure, could include leisure and busi-\n\nness activities in the destination country.\n\nOutward Medical tourism, particularly po-\n\nlitical health tourism by African political\n\nleaders, has been a major challenge con-\n\nfronting the African continent,with health-\n\ncare systems in most of the African conti-\n\nnent left undeveloped, at huge cost to the\n\nhealth of African people and the economy\n\nof the African continent. Instead of invest-\n\ning required resources in the development\n\nof their healthcare systems, some African\n\npolitical leaders prefer to seek medical care\n\nabroad, outside their respective countries.\n\nHowever, with the outbreak of Coronavi-\n\nrus disease (COVID-19) in China and its\n\nsubsequent spread to other regions of the\n\nworld, including Africa, most parts of the\n\nworld have been on lockdown with closures\n\nof international airports, land and sea bor-\n\nders.\n\nApart from the COVID-19 pandemic ex-\n\nposing the long-standing challenges and\n\nfragility of African healthcare systems, it\n\nhas severely limited the opportunity to seek\n\nmedical care abroad, with African political\n\nleaders and elites left with no choice but to\n\nseek healthcare in their home countries.\n\nWhile it may be premature to tell if this\n\nswitch to the utilization of local health\n\nfacilities by African political leaders will\n\nremain a permanent feature in the post-\n\nCOVID-19 era, this article is aimed at\n\nreviewing the impact of outward medical\n\ntourism by Africa’s political leaders and the\n\nlikelihood of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nserving as a reversal mechanism, with a pro-\n\njection into the post-COVID-19 era.\n\nFunding: This research/paper did not re-\n\nceive any specific grant from funding agen-\n\ncies in the public, commercial, or not-for-\n\nprofit sectors.\n\nThe global community is currently con-\n\nfronted with the challenge of containing\n\ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by\n\na novel strain of coronavirus, called SARS-\n\nCOV-2 [1].The disease first came to public\n\nattention following the outbreak of an acute\n\nrespiratory illness in Wuhan City, Hubei\n\nprovince of China in December 2019 [2].\n\nSince the outbreak was reported to the\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) by\n\nChinese authorities [3], it has spread be-\n\nyond China to many other countries of\n\nthe world. This trend of regional and con-\n\ntinental spread, as well as the increase in the\n\nnumber of cases, informed WHO’s declara-\n\ntion of the disease as a Public Health Emer-\n\ngency of International Concern (PHEIC)\n\non January 30, 2020 [4], and as a Pandemic\n\non 11th\n\nMarch, 2020 [5]. As at Sunday, 14th\n\nJune, 2020, over 200 countries have been\n\naffected by COVID-19, with 7,948,001\n\npersons confirmed to have COVID-19 and\n\n434, 097 deaths recorded, globally [6]. Af-\n\nrica recorded her first case of COVID-19 in\n\nEgypt on the 14th\n\nof February,2020 [7],and\n\nas at Sunday, 14th\n\nJune, 2020, over 50 Af-\n\nrican countries have been affected by CO-\n\nVID-19, with a total of 233, 732 persons\n\nconfirmed to have COVID-19 and 6, 253\n\ndeaths recorded [8].\n\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is spread\n\nthrough respiratory droplets from infected\n\nindividuals (especially when they cough or\n\nsneeze), aerosols, and contact with infected\n\nobjects and surfaces [9]. It is characterized\n\nby symptoms such as fever, cough, sore\n\nthroat, difficulty with breathing/short-\n\nness of breath, myalgia, anosmia, fatigue,\n\nas well as complications such as acute re-\n\nspiratory distress, septic shock, metabolic\n\nacidosis, bleeding and coagulation dysfunc-\n\ntion [10]. There is currently no approved\n\ndrug treatment or vaccine for the disease\n\n[11]. Therefore, Infection Prevention and\n\nControl measures and other public health\n\ninterventions such as respiratory and hand\n\nhygiene, social distancing, use of face mask,\n\npublic lockdown, risk communication, etc.\n\nhave been the mainstay of containment ef-\n\nforts [12]. This has resulted in movement\n\nrestrictions, including stoppage of interna-\n\ntional, national and local travels, closure of\n\ninternational and domestic airports, closure\n\nof land and sea borders, closure of schools\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic: a Possible Reversal Mechanism for Outward\n\nMedical Tourism by African Political Leaders\n\nOsahon Enabulele\n\nCOVID-19\n\nNIGERIA\n\nBACK TO CONTENTS\n\n16\n\nand offices, and prohibition of mass gather-\n\nings [13].\n\nCovid-19 has had great impact on many\n\ncountries. Indeed, the health, socio-eco-\n\nnomic,political and cultural implications of\n\nCOVID-19 have been quite evident. Even\n\ncountries with well-developed healthcare\n\nsystems have had their healthcare systems\n\nseriously challenged and overwhelmed by\n\nCOVID-19 [14]. The lives and livelihoods\n\nof the people have been grossly affected\n\nby the shutting down of the economy and\n\npeople’s sources of livelihood/income. It\n\nhas been estimated that half a billion more\n\npeople in the world could be pushed into\n\npoverty as governments shut down entire\n\neconomies to manage the spread of the vi-\n\nrus [15]. COVID-19 has enthroned a “new\n\nnormal” and way of life, with various cop-\n\ning strategies developed to cope with the\n\neffects of COVID-19, including new ways\n\nof living and conduct of human affairs and\n\ntransactions, increased local production of\n\nessential commodities and human needs,\n\nincreased utilization of local, homegrown\n\nresources and facilities, etc [16]. These im-\n\nplications are more glaring in most of the\n\ndeveloping countries of the world, includ-\n\ning the African continent where most of\n\nthe countries have fragile economies, in-\n\nstitutions, and fragile health care systems\n\n[17, 18].\n\nImpact of COVID-19\n\nPandemic on Outward\n\nMedical Tourism\n\nWhat is Medical Tourism?\n\nMedical tourism as a concept has been\n\npracticed for centuries in Africa and other\n\nparts of the world. However, the emergence\n\nof technology and globalization, as well as\n\nthe involvement of political leaders, govern-\n\nments, and the corporate world, has accel-\n\nerated its transformation and significance\n\nover the decades.\n\nThough there is currently no universally\n\nagreed definition of medical tourism [19],\n\nit is sometimes simply defined as the pro-\n\ncess of people travelling to another coun-\n\ntry, across international borders and outside\n\ntheir country of residence, for the purpose\n\nof obtaining medical care [19, 20].This may\n\ninclude the full range of medical services,in-\n\ncluding preventive, promotive, curative and\n\nrehabilitative services [19]. This simplified\n\ndefinition may however not truly reflect the\n\nimportant factor of tourism associated with\n\nthese foreign medical travels [21]. There-\n\nfore, to better appreciate its significance, it\n\nmay be better defined as the range of socio-\n\neconomic activities undertaken by an indi-\n\nvidual or group of persons in the process of\n\naccessing medical care/ health care services\n\noutside his/her country of residence. These\n\nactivities, which are usually undertaken af-\n\nter completion of the primary medical pro-\n\ncedure, could include leisure and business\n\nactivities in the destination country [21].\n\nMedical Tourism is usually classed into\n\nOutward Medical Tourism (when it in-\n\nvolves travel for medical care outside one’s\n\ncountry of residence) and Inward/In-bound\n\nMedical Tourism (when it involves travel\n\nfor medical care within one’s country of\n\nresidence) [21].\n\nAside from the patients, there are sev-\n\neral stakeholders currently involved in the\n\nmulti-billion dollars medical tourism mar-\n\nket. These include the healthcare providers,\n\nmedical tourism agents, insurance and trav-\n\nel agencies, national governments, etc [21].\n\nReasons for Outward Medical Tourism\n\nThere are various reasons for outward medi-\n\ncal tourism (foreign medical travels) by in-\n\ndividuals and groups. These include better\n\nquality of health infrastructure and health-\n\ncare services in the destination country, re-\n\nduced cost of healthcare services in the des-\n\ntination country, lack of access to required\n\nhealth care and diagnostic services in the\n\nsource country (such as reproductive tech-\n\nnologies and cancer diagnostic facilities),\n\npolitical instability and insecurity in the\n\nsource country, availability of the required\n\nexpertise/highly skilled medical person-\n\nnel in the destination country, ambience of\n\nthe health facilities and receptiveness of the\n\nhealth personnel, etc [21, 22]. In the case\n\nof Africa, Nigeria inclusive, it sometimes\n\nalso includes the absurd such as inordinate\n\nquest for government estacodes by some\n\npolitical and public office holders, poor po-\n\nlitical commitment to the development of\n\nthe health system and health of the citizens,\n\nand official secrecy [21].Indeed,some elites,\n\npublic and political office holders see it as\n\na status symbol, even when such medical\n\nconditions or medical care needs can be sat-\n\nisfactorily attended to in Africa [21]. This\n\nnotwithstanding, it is important to note\n\nthat there are Africans who genuinely travel\n\nabroad to access quality healthcare services\n\nand technologies (such as heart surgeries\n\nand oncological treatments) which may\n\nnot be readily available in most of Africa’s\n\nhealthcare facilities [21].\n\nOutward Medical Tourism by\n\nAfrica’s Political Leaders\n\nIt is well known that rather than invest-\n\ning resources in the sustained development\n\nof their healthcare systems, some African\n\npolitical leaders and public office holders\n\nutilize public resources to undertake fre-\n\nquent travels abroad to receive medical care,\n\nsometimes for medical conditions that can\n\nbe readily managed in their respective coun-\n\ntries [21, 23, 24]. The common destination\n\ncountries for African political leaders and\n\nelites include India, United States, United\n\nKingdom,United Arab Emirates,Germany,\n\nTurkey,Thailand, and Israel.\n\nAside from the huge loss to their country’s\n\nhealthcare systems and economies, some\n\nof these African political leaders have un-\n\nfortunately kicked the bucket either in the\n\ncourse of obtaining foreign medical care in\n\nthe destination countries, or shortly after\n\nCOVID-19 NIGERIA\n\nBACK TO CONTENTS\n\n17\n\nreturning to their home countries. Some\n\nhave also had to spend upwards of 4months\n\nin the destination countries, at great loss\n\nto the governance/political leadership and\n\neconomy of their countries [24].\n\nIn the words of Professor Khama Rogo of\n\nthe World Bank, much as Africa is heavily\n\nresource constrained,a lot of money is spent\n\non treatment abroad that could have instead\n\nhelped develop capacity locally. Africa, ac-\n\ncording to Prof. Khama Rogo, is exporting\n\nmoney and patients to the East, especially\n\nIndia, which has largely contributed to a\n\nflourishing private health sector at the ex-\n\npense of Africa’s. Prof. Rogo went further\n\nto state that 25% of the passenger loads on\n\nmajor airlines such as Kenya Airways and\n\nEthiopian Airlines, are medical tourists\n\nfrom Africa to foreign countries [25].\n\nThe unceasing trend of outward medical\n\ntourism by African political leaders in the\n\npre-COVID-19 era is a reflection of their\n\npoor priority for the health of their citizens.\n\nIt is also a strong reflection of their unsat-\n\nisfactory level of political commitment to\n\nthe development and utilization of health\n\nfacilities/systems within their respective\n\ncountries.\n\nAmongst several enablers of health sys-\n\ntem development are two critical enablers,\n\nwhich clearly depict the poor priority for\n\nhealth and unsatisfactory level of political\n\ncommitment to the development of health-\n\ncare systems by most African political lead-\n\ners/governments, viz:\n\n1. Inadequate Government Health Financ-\n\ning and Budgetary allocations.\n\nOne of the major factors that has blighted\n\nAfrican health systems is inadequate health\n\nfinancing and budgetary allocations to the\n\nhealth sector by most African governments.\n\nThis is coupled with the injudicious utiliza-\n\ntion of even the insufficient funds allocated\n\nto the health sector. An evidence of this is\n\nthe fact that many African countries are yet\n\nto meet up with the 2001 Abuja declaration\n\nof African Heads of Government (signed\n\nover 18 years ago) in which they pledged to\n\nallocate a minimum of 15% of their annual\n\nbudgets to the health sector [24, 26, 27].\n\nWhereas Africa currently (as at Sunday,\n\nJune 14, 2020) constitutes about 16.72% of\n\nthe global population [28], and bears about\n\n24% of the global disease burden [29], pub-\n\nlic health spending in Africa is reported to\n\nbe 1% of global health spending [30, 31],\n\nwith the average public expenditure on\n\nhealth in the African region put at 10% of\n\ntotal public spending [32].\n\nThis state of poor financial investment in\n\nAfrican healthcare systems has led to poor\n\nand fragile health infrastructure, equipment\n\nand diagnostic facilities, poor investment\n\nin research, poor emergency preparedness\n\nand response to epidemics, as well as a se-\n\nrious dearth in human resource for health,\n\namongst other challenges [33, 34].\n\n2. Dearth of Human Resource for Health.\n\nA very significant factor in the develop-\n\nment of healthcare systems is the Human\n\nResource for Health, comprised largely of\n\nphysicians, nurses, pharmacists and other\n\nallied health professionals/health workers.\n\nThese professionals play a significant role\n\nin the provision of the much-needed access\n\nto quality, effective and efficient health care\n\nservices.\n\nCurrently, there is a global crisis of avail-\n\nability of human resource for health, re-\n\nflected in the acute and chronic shortages\n\nof health care workers in most countries of\n\nthe world.This crisis is even worse off in the\n\nAfrican continent, which though accounts\n\nfor about 24% of the global disease bur-\n\nden, only boast of about 3% of the global\n\nhealth work force [29]. Notwithstanding\n\nthe globally acknowledged significance of\n\nthe human resource for health, most Afri-\n\ncan countries hardly accord this component\n\nof the healthcare system serious consider-\n\nation and importance, an attitude that has\n\nled to continuous emigration of medical\n\ndoctors and other healthcare professionals\n\nto countries in the developed parts of the\n\nworld with better economic climate and\n\nmore enabling health care environments,\n\nsuch as United States of America, United\n\nKingdom, Canada, United Arab Emirates,\n\nGermany, etc [35, 36].\n\nConsequences of Outward\n\nMedical Tourism on African\n\nHealthcare Systems\n\nThere have been several consequences of\n\noutbound/outward medical tourism by Af-\n\nrican political leaders and elites in the pre-\n\nCOVID-19 era. One of such consequences\n\nis the huge outflow of foreign exchange\n\n(capital flight) to other countries outside\n\nAfrica, in the course of accessing foreign\n\nmedical facilities, healthcare services and\n\ntechnologies that ought to be available lo-\n\ncally in Africa.\n\nIn 2016 alone, Africa is reported to have\n\nlost over $6 billion from outward medical\n\ntourism [37]. Indeed, it is important to note\n\nthat there are some African countries whose\n\neconomic loss (country wise) to outward\n\nmedical tourism exceeds $1billion. This is\n\nmore so as each foreign medical trip typi-\n\ncally cost an average of $20,000–$40, 000\n\nper individual traveler, with each traveler\n\nusually accompanied, most of the time [21].\n\nIn the case of foreign medical travels by Af-\n\nrican political leaders, the expenditures are\n\neven more, on account of the fact that they\n\nusually travel with outlandish entourages/\n\nhorde of aides and in expensive chartered\n\njets which sometimes incur huge parking\n\ncosts in the destination countries. For in-\n\nstance, in the year 2013, Nigeria alone, lost\n\nover $1billion to capital flight from outward\n\nmedical tourism [21, 23, 38, 39].\n\nThe unfortunate trend of frequent foreign\n\nmedical travels by African political leaders\n\nin the pre-COVID-19 era has also led to the\n\nsustained de-marketing of the healthcare\n\nCOVID-19\n\nNIGERIA\n\nBACK TO CONTENTS\n\n18\n\nsystems of their respective countries [21].\n\nThis has been at great loss to the econo-\n\nmies of African countries with tremendous\n\nnegative knock-on effects on the healthcare\n\nsystems of African countries, with most of\n\nthem left in very fragile states.\n\nThe fragile and deteriorated state of health\n\nfacilities in most African countries has over\n\ntime led to loss of confidence in the avail-\n\nable local health facilities, thus promoting\n\noutward medical tourism for the average\n\nAfrican citizen.\n\nThe emergence of COVID-19 on African\n\nsoil on the 14th\n\nof February 2020 [7], has\n\nonly exposed further, the fragility of most\n\nAfrican healthcare systems. The current\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic revealed that most\n\nAfrican healthcare systems lacked enough\n\ncapacity to respond to COVID-19 as was\n\nevident by the insufficient numbers of suit-\n\nable isolation centers and inadequate hu-\n\nman resource for health, as well as the in-\n\nsufficient diagnostic capacity to screen and\n\ndetect COVID-19 [40]. Before the first\n\nrecorded case in Africa on the 14th\n\nof Feb-\n\nruary, 2020, most of the African countries\n\nhad very limited number of Laboratories to\n\nprocess confirmatory tests for COVID-19\n\n[40].In Nigeria (the most populous country\n\nin Africa),for example,as at the 27th\n\nof Feb-\n\nruary 2020 when the country recorded her\n\nfirst case of COVID-19, there were only 5\n\ndiagnostic laboratories (4 public and 1 pri-\n\nvate) for test confirmation of COVID-19.\n\nThis was to serve a Nigerian population of\n\nover 200 million people resident in the 36\n\nStates of Nigeria and the Federal Capital\n\nterritory, Abuja [41].\n\nExpectations in the Post-\n\nCOVID-19 Era\n\nWith the deficits in African healthcare sys-\n\ntems exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic,\n\nthere are lots of expectations by African\n\npeople, particularly in terms of African\n\npolitical leaders recommitting themselves\n\nto health system development in the post-\n\nCOVID-19 era.\n\nInterestingly, COVID-19 has indubita-\n\nbly compelled most governments in Af-\n\nrica with poor priority for health, to have\n\na rethink about their commitment to their\n\nhealthcare systems, particularly with the\n\ngrim reality that COVID-19 is no respecter\n\nof social class, age, gender or race, and the\n\nfact that the opportunity for foreign medi-\n\ncal travels does not currently exist. Truly,\n\nAfrican governments have been compelled\n\nby ­\n\nCOVID-19 to make the kind of invest-\n\nments in the healthcare system that they\n\nmay ordinarily not have made in the pre-\n\nCOVID-19 era; a fact that is evident when\n\ntheir current responses to the COVID-19\n\npandemic is compared with their responses\n\nto other epidemic and endemic diseases\n\nlike Malaria, Lassa fever, Tuberculosis,\n\nand Cholera, some of which have caused\n\nmore deaths in the African continent than\n\n­COVID-19.\n\nThese COVID-19 induced investments\n\nhave led to the development of new health\n\ninfrastructure and equipment, including\n\nIsolation centres and Infectious Disease\n\nHospitals,the upgrade of existing ones,pur-\n\nchase of diagnostic machines, recruitment\n\nand motivation of healthcare personnel,\n\nencouragement of local production of some\n\nessential commodities like Ventilators, Face\n\nmasks, and Personal Protective Equipment\n\n(PPEs),amongst other initiatives to contain\n\nCOVID-19 in Africa.\n\nThis notwithstanding, it remains to be seen\n\nif these investments and commitment to\n\nemergency preparedness and response, as\n\nwell as health system development, will be\n\nsustained in the post-COVID-19 era. This\n\nauthor hopes that it will no longer be “busi-\n\nness as usual” in the post-­\n\nCOVID-19 era,\n\nand that African governments will emplace\n\nan effective and focused strategic develop-\n\nment plan that incorporates e"
