An American Journal of Medical Quality article, written by HRET staff, explores the relationship between engagement in improvement activities and affected quality measures. Read more...\n\nMHA's Participation in the Choosing Wisely Massachusetts Campaign led by Massachusetts Health Quality Partners (MHQP)\n\nHospitals and others are coming together to encourage patients to discuss with their physicians whether diagnostic imaging in the treatment of lower back pain and persistent headaches is appropriate. The goal is to help erase the long-held misconception that \"more\" care equals \"better\" care.\n\nMassachusetts Hospitals are Leading the Effort Against Opioid Addiction\n\nHospitals are currently adopting the recommendations from MHA's Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Task Force that will assist in reducing the number of opioid pain prescriptions from hospital EDs and result in a corresponding reduction in the number of opioid overdoses that are occurring in Massachusetts.\n\nEffect of a Multidisciplinary Team Approach to Eradicate Central Line Associated Blood-Stream Infections (CLABSI)\n\nAt UMass Memorial Medical Center use of a multimodal approach to catheter care resulted in more than an 89% decrease in CLABSI over a 7-year period.\n\nInfection Prevention: Highlights from Massachusetts Hospitals\n\nFor the past two years, the Massachusetts Coalition for the Prevention of Medical Errors (the Coalition) and the Massachusetts Hospital Association (MHA) have been offering programming to support the prevention of hospital-acquired infections throughout the Bay State. The Coalition and MHA are pleased to present a sample of the infection prevention successes from Massachusetts hospitals across the state. If you are a consumer, use this guide to see what hospitals in your area are doing to prevent hospital-acquired infections. If you are a provider, look for ideas that you can incorporate into your own infection prevention efforts.\n\nBID - Plymouth (formally Jordan Hospital's) Great Success in Combating Infections\n\nOver six consecutive months in 2013, Jordan Hospital in Plymouth has not recorded a single catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) in its Critical Care Center - an impressive statistic that has required intensive, shift-by-shift persistence by caregiving teams throughout the hospital and a wholesale change in the hospital culture."
