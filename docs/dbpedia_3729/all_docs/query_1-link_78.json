        "text": "Abstract\n\nLooks at the spiritual needs of older people while in care; notes that the national service framework stipulates that spiritual needs must be met as part of end-of-life care. Reports on a questionnaire survey of all the homes in the UK Trent region; records the participation of 644 homes (local authority, private and voluntary sector); highlights how respondents were asked to indicate which of eight different activities they considered to be spiritual care. Features the results of the survey; spotlights the broad interpretation given to the definition of spiritual care by management; touches on the need for education and training in this area."
