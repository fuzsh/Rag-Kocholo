        "text": "Jones was praised for his leadership, skills, and personality, with the judges highlighting the title’s outstanding 25th anniversary issue as evidence of both a magazine and an Editor at the very peak of their game.\n\nThe PPA Awards is one of the most prestigious events for UK consumer magazine and Business Media brands, with winners selected after a two-round process involving a panel of 102 independent industry judges. Around 900 senior figures gathered at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London’s Mayfair for the event on July 10, which was hosted by Claudia Winkleman, star of BBC1’s Strictly Come Dancing.\n\nA total of 24 awards were handed out on the night, which also saw Lord Heseltine, Chairman of Haymarket Media, inducted into the PPA Hall of Fame for his contribution to UK magazine media. The former Deputy Prime Minister was presented with the honour by Terry Mansfield CBE, the former President and CEO of The National Magazine Company, and Lord Heseltine was also presented with a framed personal message of congratulations from Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\nIPC Media was the big winner on the night, with woman&home taking the awards for both Consumer Magazine of the Year and Consumer Media Brand of the Year, Country Life victorious in the Specialist Consumer Magazine of the Year category, and NME’s Mark Neil named Designer of the Year.\n\nNew for 2014, the GameChanger of the Year award went to Hearst Magazines UK for their ad-sponsored ELLE Fashion Cupboard.\n\nIn the Business Publishing categories, EMAP’s Health Service Journal was crowned Magazine of the Year, while Business Media Brand of the Year went to Sigaria’s Procurement Leaders, and the BMJ’s Fiona Godlee was named Editor of the Year.\n\nFront Cover of the Year, decided for the third year running by a public online vote, went to Team Rock’s Metal Hammer for its unique Slipknot artwork cover, while the PPA Chairman’s Award was presented to Dennis Publishing’s The Week, which has achieved consistent growth as it has expanded onto web, tablet and smartphone. The late Felix Dennis, founder of Dennis Publishing, was remembered on the night with a special three-minute video tribute put together by Dennis staff.\n\nBarry McIlheney, PPA CEO, said: “Congratulations to all of this year’s thoroughly deserving winners. The PPA Awards have set the standard for excellence in our industry for more than 30 years now, and this year’s winners stand proud as the individuals, brands and companies that are setting new standards and forging new directions at such a hugely exciting time for our industry.”\n\nTHE PPA AWARDS WINNERS 2014\n\nCONSUMER MAGAZINE OF THE YEAR\n\nWoman & Home, IPC Media\n\nCONSUMER MEDIA BRAND OF THE YEAR\n\nWoman & Home, IPC Media\n\nCOLUMNIST OF THE YEAR – CONSUMER MEDIA\n\nPolly Vernon, Grazia, Bauer Media\n\nCUSTOMER MAGAZINE OF THE YEAR\n\nSlimming World, Slimming World\n\nHighly Commended: n by Norwegian, INK\n\nDIGITAL INNOVATION OF THE YEAR - CONSUMER MEDIA\n\nDiscover TV, Immediate Media Co\n\nHighly Commended: Carbuyer.co.uk, Dennis Publishing\n\nEDITOR OF THE YEAR - CONSUMER MEDIA\n\nDylan Jones, GQ, The Condé Nast Publications\n\nINTERNATIONAL CONSUMER MEDIA BRAND OF THE YEAR\n\nTime Out, Time Out Group\n\nSPECIALIST CONSUMER MAGAZINE OF THE YEAR\n\nCountry Life, IPC Media\n\nWRITER OF THE YEAR - CONSUMER MEDIA\n\nTim Lewis, Esquire, Hearst Magazines UK\n\nDESIGNER OF THE YEAR - CONSUMER MEDIA\n\nMark Neil, NME, IPC Media\n\nDESIGNER OF THE YEAR - BUSINESS MEDIA\n\nSimon Campbell, Strategies for Growth, Seven\n\nBUSINESS MAGAZINE OF THE YEAR\n\nHealth Service Journal, EMAP\n\nBUSINESS MEDIA BRAND OF THE YEAR\n\nProcurement Leaders, Sigaria\n\nDIGITAL INNOVATION OF THE YEAR - BUSINESS MEDIA\n\nCelebrity Intelligence, Centaur Media\n\nPUBLISHER/MANAGER BUSINESS & CONSUMER\n\nAlun Williams, Women’s Health, Hearst-Rodale\n\nGAME CHANGER OF THE YEAR\n\nThe ELLE Fashion Cupboard, Hearst Magazines UK\n\nPUBLISHING INNOVATOR OF THE YEAR (UNDER £10M)\n\nDiane Young, Managing Director, The Drum/Carnyx Group\n\nHighly Commended: The Slow Journalism Company\n\nCOLUMNIST OF THE YEAR – BUSINESS MEDIA\n\nSally Donovan, Community Care, Reed Business Information\n\nWRITER OF THE YEAR - BUSINESS MEDIA\n\nEmily Wright, Estates Gazette, Reed Business Information\n\nEDITOR OF THE YEAR - BUSINESS MEDIA\n\nFiona Godlee, BMJ, The BMJ Publishing Group\n\nEVENT OF THE YEAR - CONSUMER MEDIA\n\nLondon Motorcycle Show, Bauer Media\n\nEVENT OF THE YEAR - BUSINESS MEDIA\n\nFestival of Marketing, Econsultancy, Centaur Media\n\nPPA CHAIRMAN’S AWARD\n\nThe Week, Dennis Publishing\n\nHALL OF FAME\n\nLord Heseltine\n\nFRONT COVER OF THE YEAR\n\nMetal Hammer, Team Rock Limited"
