        "text": "Please follow the submission guidelines detailed below. Manuscripts that do not conform to our Instructions to Authors may be returned without review.\n\nManuscript submission\n\nPrepare manuscripts according to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association using the 7th edition. Manuscripts may be copyedited for bias-free language (see Chapter 5 of the Publication Manual). APA Style and Grammar Guidelines for the 7th edition are available.\n\nSubmit Manuscript\n\nContact our Peer Review Coordinator Katt Fambrough, if you have questions about submitting a manuscript or if you do not receive confirmation of your submission within three business days.\n\nSome institutional spam filters may block emails from our editorial office or from APA Journals. If this happens, add “apa.org” to your safe address list and ask your IT service to add it to their white list.\n\nSubmission Process\n\nOur Editorial Manager system will ask you for the following items during the submission process.\n\nArticle Type: Indicate whether the manuscript is a regular article , a brief report , or a submission for a special issue or series . Some special issues and special series submissions require permission or are by invitation only; please obtain permission if needed before choosing one of the special article types.\n\nFiles: You will be asked to upload the following files:\n\nCover letter. The letter should briefly describe the paper; explain how it fits within the journal’s scope; and confirm that it has not been published, is not under review elsewhere, and does not contain data that are under review or that have been published elsewhere. It should also confirm that all authors have reviewed the final version of the paper that is being submitted.\n\nManuscript. See the Manuscript section (below) for instructions.\n\nTables and Figures: Place tables and figures at the end of the manuscript, after the references, with one table or figure per page. Include page numbers on the table and figure pages.\n\nSupplemental Materials: You may place a variety of materials in an online-only supplement, such as 1) methodological details, tables, and figures that are not essential for inclusion in the manuscript itself but that enhance the report; 2) computer code needed to reproduce the major analyses; 3) nonproprietary questionnaires, survey forms, other data collection instruments, scripts, or experimental stimuli; and 4) qualitative response material. There is no specific limit on the length of the supplemental document, and it does not count against the manuscript’s page limit. Refer readers to the supplement at appropriate points in the text of the manuscript. See Supplementing Your Article with Online Material for more information.\n\nReporting Checklist: If you have completed a reporting checklist (e.g., CONSORT, PRISMA, or STROBE), submit it as a Reporting Checklist file.\n\nUse Microsoft Word (.doc) or LaTeX (.tex) to create documents for submission. If using LaTeX, submit a zip file that includes a .pdf version of each .tex file.\n\nManuscripts should adhere to the guidelines provided in the 7th edition of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association. APA Style guidance is available online.\n\nClassifications: Use this checklist to classify the manuscript’s area(s) of interest or specialization.\n\nSuggested Reviewers: Enter the name, institution, email address, and qualifications of at least three potential reviewers.\n\nQuestionnaire: The questionnaire asks about 1) serving as a reviewer; 2) funding agencies that supported the submitted work; 3) the larger study or project, if any, on which the current study is based; and 4) potential conflicts of interest.\n\nIf your report is based on data from a larger study or project (e.g., an analysis based on a large epidemiological dataset or a secondary analysis of clinical trial data), use the questionnaire to explain the relationship between the current paper and the larger study or project, and briefly explain the current study’s novel or value-added scientific contribution relative to other papers from the same dataset. List any papers that were based on the larger study or dataset and that have been published, are under review, or are in press, about which the editors and reviewers of the current paper should be aware. Cite them in the manuscript as well if readers should be aware of them.\n\nManuscripts\n\nLength: Regular articles are limited to 30 pages, meta-analyses to 35 pages, and brief reports to 12 pages. The page limit includes all parts of the manuscript, including the title page, abstract, text, references, tables, and figures. Use a sans serif font such as 11-point Calibri or 11-point Arial, or a serif font such as 12-point Times New Roman, and double-space the text. Authors may request permission to exceed the page limit, but the journal operates under a contractual page budget, so overages are allowed only when necessary. Please write succinctly and place nonessential materials in a supplement, not in the manuscript.\n\nTitle Page: The title page should adhere to APA Style and include an APA-style Author Note. The manuscript’s title should be no more than 12 words long, and it should not state an assertion or conclusion. The title should include “a randomized controlled trial,” “a meta-analysis,” “a systematic review,” or “systematic review and meta-analysis,” if appropriate.\n\nAPA-Style Author Notes include the following information:\n\nParagraph 1 : Authors’ ORCID iDs if available. Authors will be asked to identify the contributions of all authors at submission using the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT) . All authors should have reviewed and agreed to their individual contribution(s) before submission. Authors may claim credit for more than one role, and the same role can be attributed to more than one author.\n\nParagraph 2: Changes, if any, in author affiliations that occurred after the study ended.\n\nParagraph 3: Disclosures and acknowledgements, if any, including: a) Study preregistration information including registry name and record number, e.g., “Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT999999.” b) links to data, materials, and code. c) Financial support including funding agencies and grant numbers. d) Disclosure of any real or potentially perceived conflicts of interest including financial interests or affiliations that might be seen as influencing the research. If there are no conflicts of interest, this should be clearly stated. e) Acknowledgements of nonfinancial assistance such as staff or student contributions to the research.\n\nParagraph 4: Corresponding author’s contact information, including an email address.\n\nAbstract: Empirical reports must include a structured abstract with < 250 words and these headings:\n\nObjective: Brief statement of the purpose or aims of the study.\n\nMethods: Essential information about the study design, procedures, and measures.\n\nResults: Primary findings; include sample size and primary statistical results, if possible.\n\nConclusions: Main conclusions based on the primary findings.\n\nPapers such as narrative reviews or invited commentaries for which a structured abstract would be inappropriate should include an unstructured manuscript with a maximum of 250 words.\n\nThe journal will provide a Spanish translation of abstracts for all papers accepted as of March 1, 2023. This abstract will be added in post-production after acceptance and will be included in the online (html) version and the end of the article in the PDF version\n\nKeywords: List up to five keywords below the abstract. Use National Library of Medicine medical subject heading ( MeSH ) vocabulary or APA psychological index terms .\n\nBody of the Manuscript: Empirical reports should include:\n\na clear statement of the research question, hypothesis, specific aims, or purpose of the study;\n\nessential information about the methods even if a separate methods or protocol paper is cited;\n\ndescriptive statistics to characterize the sample, the sample size, and the measures;\n\na CONSORT-style participant flow diagram, if appropriate;\n\ndisclosure of the study’s limitations; and\n\nconclusions that are consistent with the findings.\n\nThe methods section of reports of research involving human participants must provide information about institutional review board or ethics board approval, including the name(s) of the institution(s) that approved the study, or an explanation of why the study was exempt from approval and oversight. Informed consent and assent procedures should also be briefly described.\n\nReports should explain the significance or novel contribution of original research without overstating the study’s translational, clinical, or public health significance.\n\nIf the purpose of the work is to attempt to replicate or extend previous studies, this should be disclosed, and minor innovations or superficially novel features should not be overstated.\n\nThe statistical methods should adhere to the APA Task Force on Statistical Inference guidelines. Statistical results, tables, and figures should adhere to APA Style guidelines.\n\nAreas of interest\n\nTranslational research\n\nHealth Psychology publishes work across the entire spectrum of translational research in health psychology and behavioral medicine, including observational, experimental, and interventional studies. Programmatic research is especially welcome. If the study is integral to an ongoing, well-focused program of research, its relationship to previous and planned work should be described.\n\nWhen applicable, authors are encouraged to position their study within an established framework or model for translational research, intervention development or optimization, or implementation science, such as the ORBIT Model (Czajkowski et al., Health Psychology 2015;34(10):971-982).\n\nObservational and experimental research\n\nHealth Psychology publishes many kinds of observational, epidemiological, and experimental studies. However, studies with the following characteristics are seldom accepted:\n\nstudies with little or no direct relevance to physical health or medical illness\n\nstudies with limited ecological validity or generalizability\n\nmediation analyses based on cross-sectional data\n\nsmall qualitative studies\n\nEarly-phase intervention research\n\nHealth psychology is an applied science that draws upon many areas of basic research. Translational and intervention optimization models such as ORBIT, the NIH Stage Model, or the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) encourage us to ground our health-related behavioral intervention research in basic social and behavioral science research, the science of behavior change, and in other areas of psychosocial, clinical, and public health research. These models also promote a programmatic approach to intervention development, optimization, testing, and implementation.\n\nThe journal welcomes basic research that is conducted to inform health-related behavioral intervention development or other clinical or public health applications of health psychology. We also welcome early-phase research on health-related behavioral interventions, such as intervention development, optimization, and dose-finding studies; proof-of-concept evaluations; and feasibility studies. However, these reports must meet certain criteria to be considered for publication.\n\nThe study should be embedded in a translational or intervention optimization model and in programmatic line of research whose long-term goal concerns maintaining physical health, preventing medical illness, or improving significant medical or public health outcomes.\n\nThe report should not claim that the study is definitive or that it has significant practice or policy implications; it should instead point to specific next steps in the line of research.\n\nIt should not include severely underpowered statistical tests of efficacy hypotheses; see Freedland KE. Health Psychology 2020;39(10):851-862 for further information.\n\nSmall, early-phase studies must compete against larger and more definitive studies in the journal’s priority ranking system. This is especially challenging for small or preliminary studies that are conducted primarily to guide the investigator’s own work and that may be of limited interest to other researchers. Thus, early-phase research reports should highlight aspects of the study that would be informative for other investigators.\n\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs)\n\nThe journal welcomes reports based on randomized controlled trials of health-related behavioral interventions. However, secondary or exploratory analyses of RCT outcome data should not be submitted until the primary findings of the trial have been published. Manuscripts that do not include outcome data, such as analyses that are limited to baseline data, may be submitted before the primary findings have been published.\n\nMeta-analyses and Meta-regression analyses\n\nMeta-analyses and meta-regression analyses of research in health psychology and behavioral medicine are welcome. They must provide significant added value if other meta-analyses of the same area of research have already been published.\n\nPsychometric studies\n\nResearch on questionnaires or other assessment instruments should be based on modern psychometric methods. A convincing case should be made for a new, modified, or translated measure, and it should be relevant to a large segment of the journal’s readership.\n\nMethodological issues and advances\n\nHealth Psychology welcomes reviews and tutorials on the following methodological topics:\n\nAdvanced statistical procedures that are applicable to multiple areas of health psychology or behavioral medicine research but that are underutilized.\n\nStandard statistical methods that are widely misunderstood, misused, or neglected in health psychology and behavioral medicine research.\n\nNonstatistical methodological issues that affect the quality or impact of health psychology and behavioral medicine research.\n\nAuthors should 1) present advanced methods in a clear and accessible manner for readers who are not statistical experts; 2) provide guidance about the assumptions and utilization of statistical procedures, examples, and computer code; and 3) provide links to sample datasets if applicable.\n\nLetters to the editor\n\nSelected letters to the editor are published online, on the journal’s website. Submit letters to the editor by email to Katt Fambrough with a cover letter disclosing any potential conflicts of interest. If the letter is accepted, the target article’s authors may be invited to respond.\n\nTransparency and Openness Promotion\n\nWork submitted to Health Psychology should adhere to the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines. For empirical reports, include a brief \"Transparency and Openness\" subsection at the beginning of the methods section. This subsection should detail the efforts the authors have made to comply with the TOP guidelines; the purpose is to gather all required disclosures and links in one location to make it easier for readers, reviewers, and editors to find this information. This is an example of a brief transparency and openness statement for an RCT:\n\nIn this article, we report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions, all manipulations, and all measures that were included in the study, and we follow the CONSORT guideline for reporting parallel group randomized trials. All data, analysis code, and research materials are available at [stable link to permanent repository]. Data were analyzed using R version 4.0.0 (R Core Team, 2020). The trial was pre-registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT99999999).\n\nEmpirical reports submitted to Health Psychology are required to meet certain TOP standards. Adherence to other TOP standards is optional but the manuscript must disclose the level of adherence. The list below summarizes these requirements; see the TOP guidelines for details.\n\nCitation Standards: Level 2, Required—All data, program code and other methods must be cited in the text and listed in the References section.\n\nData Transparency: Level 1, Disclose—The article must disclose whether or not the materials are posted to a trusted repository. In both the Author Note and the Transparency and Openness subsection in the Method section, state whether the data are available, and if so, where to access them. The preferred method is to provide a link to a trusted repository. Trusted discipline-specific, institutional, and open research repositories are acceptable. See the OpenAIRE Guide for information and re3data.org help with finding repositories.\n\nAnalytic Methods (Code) Transparency: Level 2, Required—Provide the computer code needed to reproduce the major analyses in a supplement or via a link to a trusted repository in the Transparency and Openness subsection in the Method section. Explain exceptions in the Statistical Analysis section.\n\nResearch Materials Transparency: Level 2, Required—Provide key nonproprietary materials such as questionnaires or survey forms in a supplement or via a link to a trusted repository in the Transparency and Openness subsection in the Method section. Provide citations for proprietary materials. Explain exceptions in the Method section.\n\nReporting Standards; Design and Analysis Transparency: Level 2, Required—Adhere to relevant Equator Network reporting guidelines, such as CONSORT for randomized trials or PRISMA for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Submit a completed reporting guideline checklist as a Document for Reviewers and include a participant flow diagram in the manuscript. Adhere to the APA Journal Article Reporting Standards (JARS) for items that are not addressed in the Equator Network guidelines.\n\nPreregistration of Studies: Level 2, Required—State whether the study was preregistered in an established registry, and if so, provide the link or information needed to access the record. Randomized controlled trials must be pre­registered in clinicaltrials.gov or another established registry in the WHO Registry Network. Reports of RCTs that are unregistered or that were registered retrospectively may be rejected without peer review.\n\nStudy preregistration is defined as creation of time stamped, read-only documentation of study design and, if applicable, hypotheses, before the participants are enrolled.\n\nAccess to a masked version of the preregistered study should be available at submission via stable link or supplemental material.\n\nStudy design includes items such as experimental conditions, operationaliza­tion of variables, sampling plans, etc. For studies other than RCTs, a protocol or methods paper may be cited in lieu of study preregistration if it was published prior to the enrollment of study participants.\n\nPreregistration of Analysis Plans: Level 2, Required—State whether the statistical analysis plan was preregistered in a trusted repository or established registry such as clinicaltrials.gov, and if so, provide the link or information needed to access it. Documentation of the analysis plan must be time stamped, accessible, and read-only.\n\nThe analysis plan may include information about planned analytic strategies, specific planned models, statistical decision rules, assumption checks, etc. It may also identify analyses that are meant to be confirmatory tests of a priori hypotheses. The goal is to clearly differentiate between preplanned vs. post hoc (and perhaps data-dependent) analyses.\n\nA priori analysis plans are defined as ones that are preregistered before the data are collected. Blinded ex post analyses are defined as ones that were not preregistered but that were planned before the relevant data were seen. Post hoc analyses are defined as ones that are conducted after the analyst or investigator has seen the data.\n\nAccess to a masked version of the preregistered analysis plan should be available at submission via stable link or supplemental material.\n\nReplication: Level 1, Disclose—The journal encourages submission of replication studies. Submissions should include “A Replication of XX Study” in the subtitle of the manuscript as well as in the abstract.\n\nEquity, diversity, and inclusion statement\n\nHealth Psychology is strongly committed to advancing diversity in all areas including but not limited to age, socioeconomic background, race/ethnicity, culture, gender, sexual orientation, religion, language, abilities, and the intersection of multiple underserved identities. In this context, the editorial team strives for inclusive excellence; the belief that our mission to advance population health is facilitated by promoting diversity in who we are (representation), the scope of work, and how that work is achieved. Through these efforts we aim to create a more welcoming space to advance understanding of public health challenges, optimize the associated research efforts, harmonize research with the very communities we aim to benefit, and establish a sustainable pipeline of inclusion and representation for the journal’s future stewardship.\n\nPlease review the journal’s full EDI statement and a summary of the journal’s practices in support of equity, diversity, and inclusion.\n\nEquity, diversity, and inclusion in Health Psychology\n\nHealth Psychology is committed to improving equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in scientific research, in line with the APA Publishing EDI framework and APA’s trio of 2021 resolutions to address systemic racism in psychology.\n\nThe journal encourages submissions which extend beyond Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) samples (Henrich, et al., 2010). The journal welcomes submissions which feature Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) and other historically marginalized sample populations. The journal particularly welcomes submissions which feature collaborative research models (e.g., community-based participatory research [CBPR]; see Collins, et al., 2018) and study designs that address heterogeneity within diverse samples. Studies focused exclusively on BIPOC and other historically excluded populations are also welcome.\n\nTo promote a more equitable research and publication process, Health Psychology has adopted the following standards for inclusive research reporting.\n\nAuthor contribution statements using CRediT\n\nThe APA Publication Manual (7th ed.) stipulates that \"authorship encompasses…not only persons who do the writing but also those who have made substantial scientific contributions to a study.\" In the spirit of transparency and openness, Health Psychology has adopted the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT) to describe each author's individual contributions to the work. CRediT offers authors the opportunity to share an accurate and detailed description of their diverse contributions to a manuscript.\n\nSubmitting authors must identify the contributions of all authors at initial submission according to the CRediT taxonomy. If the manuscript is accepted for publication, the CRediT designations will be published as an author contributions statement in the author note of the final article. All authors should have reviewed and agreed to their individual contribution(s) before submission.\n\nAuthors can claim credit for more than one contributor role, and the same role can be attributed to more than one author. Not all roles will be applicable to a particular scholarly work.\n\nParticipant description, sample justification, and informed consent\n\nAuthors must include a detailed description of the study participants in the Method section of each empirical report, including (but not limited to) the following:\n\nage\n\nsex\n\ngender\n\nracial identity\n\nethnicity\n\nnativity or immigration history\n\nsocioeconomic status\n\nclinical diagnoses and comorbidities (as appropriate)\n\nany other relevant demographics (e.g., disability status; sexual orientation)\n\nIn both the abstract and in the discussion section of the manuscript, authors must discuss the diversity of their study samples and the generalizability of their findings (see also the constraints on generality section below).\n\nAuthors must justify their sample demographics in the discussion section. If Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) or all-White samples are used, authors should justify their samples and describe their sample inclusion efforts (see Roberts, et al., 2020 for more information on justifying sample demographics).\n\nThe method section also must include a statement describing how informed consent was obtained from the participants (or their parents/guardians), including for secondary use of data if applicable, and indicate that the study was conducted in compliance with an appropriate Internal Review Board.\n\nReporting year(s) of data collection\n\nAuthors must disclose the year(s) of data collection in both the abstract and in the method section in order to appropriately contextualize the study.\n\nPositionality statements\n\nAuthors are encouraged to include a positionality statement in the author note. Positionality statements are intended to address potential author bias by transparently reporting how the identities of the authors relate to the research/article topic and to the identity of the participants, as well as the extent to which those identities are represented in the scientific record. The statement should be included in the author note and expanded upon in the Discussion section. See this example from Jovanova, et al. (2022):\n\nSample positionality statement: “Mindful that our identities can influence our approach to science (Roberts, et al. 2020), the authors wish to provide the reader with information about our backgrounds. With respect to gender, when the manuscript was drafted, four authors self-identified as women and four authors as men. With respect to race, six authors self-identified as white, one as South Asian and one as East Asian.”\n\nFor more guidance on writing positionality statements, see Roberts, et al. (2020) and Hamby (2018).\n\nReflexivity\n\nThe journal welcomes submissions that proactively challenge racism and other forms of oppression. In line with the APA Guidelines on Race and Ethnicity in Psychology (2019), authors are encouraged to include reflexive statements in the Discussion section, addressing the following questions.\n\nWhat are the policy implications of these findings?\n\nCould this research be misinterpreted or misused to negatively affect underrepresented groups? Does the research have the potential to cause harm to vulnerable groups? If so, how can this be addressed and mitigated?\n\nDoes the design or framing of this research reinforce negative stereotypes about marginalized populations?\n\nWhat roles do the researcher(s)’ values and worldview play in the selection of this topic or design of the study?\n\nData, materials, and code\n\nAuthors must state whether data, code, and study materials are posted to a trusted repository and, if so, how to access them, including their location and any limitations on use. If they cannot be made available, authors must state the legal or ethical reasons why they are not available. Trusted repositories adhere to policies that make data discoverable, accessible, usable, and preserved for the long term. Trusted repositories also assign unique and persistent identifiers. Recommended repositories include APA’s repository on the Open Science Framework (OSF), or authors can access a full list of other recommended repositories.\n\nIn a subsection titled \"Transparency and Openness\" in the Methods section, specify whether and where the data and material will be available or note the legal or ethical reasons for not doing so. For submissions with quantitative or simulation analytic methods, state whether the study analysis code is posted to a trusted repository, and, if so, how to access it (or the legal or ethical reason why it is not available).\n\nFor example:\n\nAll data have been made publicly available at the [repository name] and can be accessed at [persistent URL or DOI].\n\nMaterials and analysis code for this study are not available.\n\nThe code behind this analysis/simulation has been made publicly available at the [repository name] and can be accessed at [persistent URL or DOI].\n\nConstraints on generality\n\nIn a subsection of the discussion titled \"Constraints on generality,\" authors are encouraged to include a detailed discussion of the limits on generality (see Simons, Shoda, & Lindsay, 2017). In this section, authors should detail grounds for concluding why the results are may or may not be specific to the characteristics of the participants. They should address limits on generality not only for participants but for materials, procedures, and context. Authors should also specify which methods they think could be varied without affecting the result and which should remain constant.\n\nPublic significance statements\n\nAuthors submitting manuscripts to Health Psychology must include a brief statement (2-3 sentences/70 words max) summarizing the public health significance/implications of their work. For example, this statement may describe how the current research advances some fundamental knowledge of health and disease, vulnerable populations, sheds light on hypothesized mechanisms, or contributes knowledge that may enhance prevention and health, contribute to illness management, or aid coping and recovery. Hyperlinks and URLs are not permitted in this description. The statement should be included within the manuscript on the abstract/keywords page and should be written clearly for the educated public.\n\nPeer review policy\n\nAll manuscripts submitted to Health Psychology undergo an initial editorial evaluation which may result in rejection without external peer review.\n\nManuscripts that are sent out for external peer review receive single-masked reviews. This means that the reviewers are anonymous, but the authors are not.\n\nThe manuscript’s title page should include the name and affiliation of every author. Identifying information should not be masked on the title page, in the Abstract or in body of the manuscript, or in citations or references. Masked manuscripts may be returned to the authors without review.\n\nTechnical specifications\n\nTables\n\nTables should adhere to APA Style. Use Word’s Insert Table function to create tables, and do not insert tabs or extra spaces to align columns as this will create problems when the table is typeset.\n\nFigures\n\nPreferred formats for graphics files are TIFF and JPG, and preferred format for vector-based files is EPS. Graphics downloaded or saved from web pages are not acceptable for publication. Multipanel figures (i.e., figures with parts labeled a, b, c, d, etc.) should be assembled into one file. When possible, please place symbol legends below the figure instead of to the side.\n\nResolution\n\nAll color line art and halftones: 300 DPI\n\nBlack and white line tone and gray halftone images: 600 DPI\n\nLine weights\n\nAdobe Photoshop images\n\nColor (RGB, CMYK) images: 2 pixels\n\nGrayscale images: 4 pixels\n\nAdobe Illustrator Images\n\nStroke weight: 0.5 points\n\nAPA offers authors the option to publish their figures online in color without the costs associated with print publication of color figures.\n\nThe same caption will appear on both the online (color) and print (black and white) versions. To ensure that the figure can be understood in both formats, authors should add alternative wording (e.g., “the red (dark gray) bars represent”) as needed.\n\nFor authors who prefer their figures to be published in color both in print and online, original color figures can be printed in color at the editor's and publisher's discretion provided the author agrees to pay:\n\n$900 for one figure\n\nAn additional $600 for the second figure\n\nAn additional $450 for each subsequent figure\n\nEquations and computer code\n\nUse Times or Symbol font or Microsoft’s Equation Editor for equations or formulas.\n\nIf possible, provide executable source code in an online-only supplement, not in the manuscript itself. If it is essential to include code in the manuscript, submit a separate file with the code exactly as you want it to appear. Use 8-point Courier New font and do not add any extra indents, line spaces, or line breaks. Segments >40 characters will be printed as images; shorter snippets of code will be typeset in Courier New and run with the rest of the text.\n\nReferences\n\nList references in alphabetical order. Each listed reference should be cited in text, and each text citation should be listed in the References section.\n\nExamples of basic reference formats:\n\nJournal article\n\nMcCauley, S.
