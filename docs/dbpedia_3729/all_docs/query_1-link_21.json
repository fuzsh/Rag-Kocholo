        "text": "This evening Dr Cheryll Adams, Executive Director of the Institute of Health Visiting (iHV), was named in the Health Service Journal (HSJ) 2015 Clinical Leaders List held in association with Veredus.\n\nThe HSJ Clinical Leaders list highlights those leaders whose clinical background enhances the work they do and those who have either made a significant impact on health service policy, healthcare delivery or medical/clinical advance over the last 12 months.\n\nSally Russell, Chair of the Institute of Health Visiting, said: “It’s a wonderful accolade for Dr Cheryll Adams to be included on the 2015 HSJ Clinical Leaders list. This acknowledges the remarkable effort she has personally put into making the Institute of Health Visiting match its vision of delivering excellence and consistency in health visiting practice, and so lead to improved health outcomes and making a real difference to all children, families and communities.\n\n“Through evidence-based support and guidance developed by the Institute to help health visitors on issues which are key to tackling inequalities in health, Cheryll is determined that every child deserves the best start in life. I am sure many will join me in welcoming this recognition, which is richly deserved.”\n\nThe HSJ team and readers named those they thought the judges should consider. A panel of expert judges were asked review the long list and add suggestions of their own. 100 individuals from across the spectrum of healthcare have made the 2015 list, with the top 20 clinical leaders ranked – and this was announced at the evening ceremony.\n\nDr Cheryll Adams, Director of the Institute of Health Visiting, said: “I feel very honoured to have been selected for the HSJ Clinical Leaders List again.\n\n“Health visitors, for so long the ‘silent public health army’, must have their voice heard again by communities where they have such an impact on the public’s health, the iHV is helping this to happen. In particular through the hundreds of local iHV Fellows, Perinatal and Infant Mental Health Champions and Safeguarding and Domestic Violence and Abuse Experts we have created since our launch in November 2012. These health visitors are our real leaders as it is they who are driving local change.\n\n“Critical to our success has been the support of all those in the profession, their managers and employers who have embraced all the iHV offers them and implements it to drive health improvement – they should share in this award, as should the board and staff of the iHV.\n\n“I would like to thank those who nominated me, the judges and the very many individuals who are helping the iHV to deliver its vision. The iHV is a very exciting organisation and one I love being part of.”\n\nENDS\n\nFor more information, please contact: Julie Cooper, Communications and Marketing Manager at the Institute of Health Visiting on 07508 344716 or [email protected]\n\nNotes to editorsAbout the Institute of Health Visiting\n\nThe Institute of Health Visiting is A UK Centre of Excellence supporting the development of universally high-quality health visiting practice.
