        "text": "The committee was tasked with identifying factors that influence a person's use of health-care services, including poverty and level of urbanization. This chapter will address those factors. The committee has organized the beginning of the chapter around individual and societal determinants of health-care utilization, including factors that affect the need for care, the propensity to use services, and barriers to the use of services. That is followed by a brief overview of disparities in the use of health care that have differentially affected different population groups. Finally, it concludes with a discussion of what is known about the relationship between disability status and use of health-care services.\n\nPeople use health-care services to diagnose, cure, or ameliorate disease or injury; to improve or maintain function; or to obtain information about their health status and prognosis. Health-care utilization can be appropriate or inappropriate, of high or low quality, and of high or low cost. Types of health-care utilizations are described in detail in Appendix A.\n\nThe health-care delivery system has undergone great change over the past few decades. New and improved drugs, devices, procedures, tests, and imaging machinery have changed patterns of care and sites where care is provided (NCHS, 2003). The growth of ambulatory surgery has been influenced by improvements in anesthesia and analgesia and by the development of noninvasive or minimally invasive techniques. New and improved, and less invasive, procedures are available to treat a number of previously untreatable conditions in a variety of new sites of care, or even in physicians' offices. New drugs can cure or lengthen the course of disease, although often at increased cost or increased utilization. Combinations of technologies can be more effective than individual ones, such as the combination of drugs now used to treat HIV/AIDS, combination chemotherapy for many types of cancers, and the recent creation of scanning machines that combine positron emission tomography and computed tomography or positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. As some technologies become easier to use and less expensive, as equipment becomes more transportable, and as recovery times for procedures are reduced, even complex technologies move out of hospitals and institutional settings and into ambulatory surgery centers, provider offices, outpatient facilities, imaging centers, and patients' homes and become more accessible. The average length of hospitalizations decreased with the diffusion of new technologies until 2010 and has been constant since then (NCHS, 2016).\n\nThe availability of newer and improved health-care services, however, does not mean that they are equally available to all Americans. For example, white women are much more likely to have outpatient surgery than women of other races or ethnicities (Salasky et al., 2014) and Medicaid beneficiaries, who are poor and often disabled, are more likely to use emergency departments (EDs) than people who have other coverage, in part because they have less access to ambulatory care (MACPAC, 2016; NCHS, 2017a).\n\nHealth-care utilization is determined by the need for care, by whether people know that they need care, by whether they want to obtain care, and by whether care can be accessed. Quality is a construct separate from access and is related to the achievement of favorable outcomes associated with utilization, not to whether health-care utilization occurs at all or to difficulties in obtaining care. In theory, health-care utilization should correlate highly with the need, however defined, for services. But, some services are needed and not obtained, and others are utilized but not clearly indicated, or are indicated only after other protocols are followed (Kale et al., 2013; Kressin and Groeneveld, 2015; Lyu et al., 2017). The committee did not address various technologies and whether they might be useful for disability assessments, because data on technologies are insufficient for such assessments. For example, telehealth is not widely used throughout the country, and the medical field continues to try to determine how it can be used most effectively. However, the committee did examine national data when they were available.\n\nNeed for and access to health care are discussed below. Those sections are followed by a discussion of differences in utilization according to selected characteristics. Finally, health-care utilization by people who have disabilities is discussed.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe health-care delivery system has undergone much change in the past few decades: new and improved drugs, devices, procedures, tests, and imaging machinery have changed patterns of care and sites where care is provided. The growth in ambulatory surgery has been influenced by improvements in anesthesia and analgesia and by the development of noninvasive or minimally invasive techniques. New and improved, and less invasive, procedures are available to treat people for a number of previously untreatable conditions in a variety of new sites of care, and even in physicians' offices. New drugs can cure disease or prolong survival of disease, although often at increased cost or with increased utilization. However, the availability of newer and improved types of health-care services does not mean that they are equally available to all Americans.\n\nPeople use health-care services to diagnose, cure, or ameliorate disease or injury; to improve or maintain function; or even to obtain information about their health status and prognosis. Many factors affect health-care utilization, including need. The need for services affects differential use of health utilization for specific populations. Ideally, need is the major determinant of health-care utilization, but other factors clearly have an impact. They include poverty and its correlates, geographic area of residence, race and ethnicity, sex, age, language spoken, and disability status. The ability to access care—including whether it is available, timely and convenient, and affordable—affects health care utilization.\n\nFor people who have disabilities, accessing health care can be demanding. Many factors facilitate and hinder access to needed health care. Disability correlates with increased health-care utilization, and people who have disabilities often have worse overall health status, are poorer, and have a higher prevalence of poor health behaviors such as smoking and obesity. They also have poorer overall access because of provider discrimination, provider failure to make accommodations, and inadequate communication with providers."
