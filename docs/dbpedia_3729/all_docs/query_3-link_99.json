        "text": "Please submit the following through the online submission form by Monday, May 20, 2024 at 5 p.m. to be considered for the next cohort of RISE Innovators:\n\n1. Description. Provide a brief (two-page limit) description about your health science education innovation that includes the following:\n\nHealth issue to be addressed. Describe the existing health issue your innovation addresses. Briefly summarize why you believe this is an important issue, based on existing evidence — e.g., published literature, personal or professional experience, available metrics, extant theories, etc.\n\nVision. Describe the desired future state of practice or health to which you expect your innovation to contribute.\n\nInterventions. Describe 1-2 specific interventions you plan to create or adopt to address the health issue. In your description of each intervention, please include the following information:\n\nWhat, specifically, is the intervention (e.g., training course, new education delivery platform)?\n\nIs the intervention new, or an adapted or modified activity/intervention?\n\nWho are the intended participants or recipients (e.g., medical students, master’s students, PhD students, residents, fellows) of your intervention?\n\nWhere can the intervention be scaled (e.g., single or multiple institutions and/or other education domains such as biomedical sciences, continuing medical education, graduate medical education, undergraduate medical education)?\n\nWhat outcomes do you expect the intervention to translate into (e.g., improved knowledge, skills, or other attributes, improved science, or health)?\n\nTeam. Describe the people who will work with you on your intervention. Please include 1) names of team members, 2) brief descriptions of each team member’s role on the team and 3) a statement regarding how the team member represents a diversity of perspective. The team should include at least one intended recipient of your intervention (e.g., learner, patient).\n\n2. Letter of support. Submit a letter of support from your supervisor, director or division/department chair that supports for your participation. This letter should be addressed to Dr. Meg Wolff, RISE Curriculum Director, and should include a statement endorsing the department’s support for applicant’s participation and the innovation. For learners, the letter should also state the applicant is currently in good standing in their academic program. For applicants requesting FTE support, this letter should also include an explicit agreement to accommodate the 15% reduction in FTE effort or education responsibilities.\n\nPlease feel free to contact Dr. Paula Thompson ([email protected]) or Dr. Meg Wolff ([email protected]) with any questions about your application.\n\n3. Itemized budget (if funding is requested*). Provide an itemized budget that describes how you will use the requested funds. Describe any technology (hardware, software, devices, etc.) or technological support (programming, editing, storage, network, etc.) necessary to support your intervention(s). *A budget is not required for applicants not requesting FTE or project funding.\n\n4. Resume or Curriculum Vitae.\n\nNote: Please do reference the use of AI tools if used for the development of your submission materials.\n\nThese RISE Funding Application FAQs provide additional clarifying information. Please contact [email protected] with any additional questions.\n\nTopics\n\nHow does RISE define “health science education innovation”?\n\nWe define health science education innovation (HSEI) broadly as a new idea with the potential to change existing approaches in teaching and learning, scale to different areas and learners, and improve practice and health.\n\nWhat topics has RISE previously supported?\n\nRISE has supported a wide variety of topics. Please see our Innovators to learn more.\n\nWhat topics is RISE looking to support?\n\nRISE invites topics seeking to transform the way we learn, teach and train in health science education. We seek new ideas from across the continuum of health science education that have the potential to advance science, health and/or health care delivery. This includes topics from all health science education disciplines.\n\nApplication\n\nHow long can my application be?\n\nApplications should not exceed 2 pages (12-point font, 1” margins). The resume/CV, budget, and letter of support should be submitted as separate documents and do not factor into the 2-page limit.\n\nCan I submit supplementary materials—beyond what is explicitly required?\n\nYes. If you wish to provide additional materials in formats not supported by our online submission, please email these directly to [email protected] with a subject line that includes— Supplemental RISE Application Material: Last Name, First Name.\n\nWhat is RISE’s policy on IRB approval?\n\nInstitutional Review Board (IRB) approval or exemption is required for any research project involving human participants. Applicants have three months from the date of the acceptance to obtain IRB approval if the innovation involves human participants.\n\nSelection\n\nHow will my RISE application be assessed?\n\nAll applications will be assessed using the RISE Health Science Education Innovation Application Development Rubric. Interviewers will use the RISE Health Science Education Innovation Competency Development Rubric to assess interviewees.\n\nWho is involved in the RISE selection process?\n\nThe RISE Core Team will review applications, conduct interviews and make final selection decisions.\n\nWhen and how will notifications regarding the RISE selection be made?\n\nAll applicants will receive feedback on their application by July. Top applicants will be invited to interview over the summer with final decisions being made mid-September. Those selected for RISE support will be asked to confirm acceptance, in writing, by early October.\n\nIf I am selected as a RISE Innovator, how much time will I have to complete my project?\n\nInnovations are expected to be piloted within the 12-months of the program. However, we recognize that, for various reasons, delays may occur. In the event of a delay, an extension may be requested.\n\nIf I am not accepted as a RISE Innovator, will I receive feedback on my application?\n\nYes, you will receive a narrative summary of the strengths and areas for development as they relate to your proposed innovation.\n\nIf I am not accepted as a RISE Innovator, can I still participate in aspects of RISE?\n\nAbsolutely! We would love for you to remain engaged with us. By applying for support, you become a member of the RISE Community. This means you will be invited to RISE activities and will be eligible for opportunities such as grant brainstorming sessions, which will offer you innovation networking and much more.\n\nFunding\n\nWho can apply for RISE funding?\n\nAll Michigan Medicine faculty, staff and learners (medical or graduate students, residents, fellows, and post-doctoral fellows) are eligible for RISE funding. Individuals can apply for the FTE support if they can modify their position/program requirements to accommodate the required 15% reduction in their employment or education responsibilities. It is the applicant’s responsibility to negotiate and secure this approval from their supervisor prior to submitting their application. A letter of support from a person with appropriate oversight for the 15% reduction in other responsibilities is required at the time of application.\n\nCan I apply for support if I am not employed by Michigan Medicine?\n\nYes. The individuals who are not employed by Michigan Medicine can apply to participate in the Innovation Development Program and receive Innovation Coaching without funding.\n\nHow much funding can be requested, in addition to the protected time?\n\nA maximum of $5,000 per application can be requested.\n\nWhen will the FTE support and project funding begin?\n\nThe FTE support is effective January 1, 2025. If your position does not allow for the 0.15 FTE support, the equivalent of 15% reduction in other responsibilities for staff and learners can also be made to accommodate the effort required. The project funding will also be made available by January 1, 2025.\n\nCan I apply for FTE funding if I already have FTE support for another education project?\n\nYes, although your innovation must still represent a unique scope that advances the other project. Please contact us at [email protected] to discuss specifics.\n\nWhat is excluded from RISE project funding?\n\nRISE funds cannot be used to pay for internal training or consulting, food where the sole purpose of the event is to promote dialogue or conversation within the department or unit, conference travel, or regular faculty and staff salary support.\n\nWhat happens if I do not use all the funds?\n\nAll unused funds must be returned."
