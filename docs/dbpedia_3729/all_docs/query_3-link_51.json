        "text": "Exploring UNC Research Networks and Impact Metrics with VOSViewer\n\nInteractive network graphics of publication output, areas of research focus, and collaboration patterns offer a technological advance over static, flat images. VOSviewer Online allows users such as prospective faculty and students to explore data up close that show faculty research strengths and how a particular unit or school collaborates with other researchers and institutions around the world.\n\nGillings School of Global Public Health 10-Year Research Analysis\n\nThe Health Sciences Library (HSL) has partnered with administration at UNC-Chapel Hillâ€™s Gillings School of Global Public Health (SPH) on a series of projects to reveal collaboration patterns of research faculty, illustrate evolution in research foci over time, and demonstrate SPH impact."
