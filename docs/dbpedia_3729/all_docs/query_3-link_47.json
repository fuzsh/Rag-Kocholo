Health services professionals include nurses, technicians, health administrators, managers, counselors, and physicians.\n\nDiscover more about health services, including the different categories, job opportunities, and salaries in this guide.\n\nHealth Services vs. Healthcare: What's the Difference?\n\nMany healthcare providers use the terms healthcare and health services interchangeably. People receive healthcare services when they visit a hospital, clinic, or other healthcare setting. This entails any health-related service provided by a healthcare professional, from processing new patient paperwork to performing health assessments and providing treatment.\n\nHealthcare professionals collaborate to determine which services patients need to recover. They may provide these services directly or refer patients to a specialist. Professionals in health services careers use their specialized education and training to inform their suggested care plans to patients.\n\nWhat Is Health Services?\n\nHealthcare services include treatments patients receive to recover from illness or injury or prevent morbidities from occurring. Depending on a patient's medical condition, many professionals, such as emergency medical technicians (EMTs), paramedics, nurses, and physicians, may provide these services.\n\nHealth services careers require specialized education and training. Some professions, such as EMTs, do not require a college education. Consider the following health services categories and types of health services to find those that align with your interests and goals.\n\nHealth Services Categories\n\nChevron Down\n\nChevron Up\n\nEmergency: EMTs, paramedics, and physicians provide emergency health services, such as stabilizing patients after a car accident or heart attack. Their work keeps patients alive during the trip to a hospital or in other healthcare settings. Learn more about the best online associate in paramedic programs.\n\nPreventative: Medical assistants, nurses, public health professionals, and physicians trained in preventative medicine. They develop preventative treatment plans for patients or communities.\n\nRehabilitative: Rehabilitative healthcare workers help patients regain mobility and independence after illness, injury, or disease. Services include educating patients about rehabilitation strategies, leading exercise sessions, and offering encouragement.\n\nLong-term: Older patients or those with a chronic illness or debilitating injury may need long-term healthcare and social services, which may include help with dressing, eating, and completing other tasks.\n\nHospital: Healthcare services professionals in a hospital setting treat patients needing 24/7 care, such as those recovering from a serious illness or injury. Hospitals also provide outpatient services, such as therapy sessions for mental health or addiction issues.\n\nDiagnostic: Diagnostic healthcare services provide the test results physicians need to diagnose and treat illness or injury. These services also help healthcare professionals measure patients' recovery.\n\nPrimary: Physicians and nurses provide primary healthcare services. Other workers specializing in another healthcare services category can also provide primary care.\n\nPalliative: Palliative care focuses on improving patients' quality of life in a healthcare or home setting. Physicians create medication plans for patients with terminal illnesses, while hospice workers ensure residents remain comfortable.\n\nHomecare: Many patients need continued healthcare services after discharge from the hospital. Physical therapists, nurses, or medical assistants make home calls, review patients' conditions, and provide services on-site.\n\nTypes of Health Services\n\nChevron Down\n\nChevron Up\n\nPrimary care: Primary care services include answering patients' healthcare questions, taking vitals, and analyzing test results. In-person or virtual visits let physicians gauge patients' overall health, identify issues, and recommend solutions.\n\nOutpatient care: Outpatient care refers to all healthcare services not requiring hospitalization, such as bloodwork, cancer treatment, and mental health services. Healthcare centers' facilities determine whether they can provide outpatient care.\n\nEmergency care: Serious, sometimes life-threatening medical conditions require emergency care. EMTs and paramedics stabilize patients en route to a hospital's emergency room by administering medication and other life-saving measures.\n\nMental health: Becoming a psychiatrist, psychologist, therapist, or counselor will allow you to provide mental healthcare services. Typical services include leading patients in one-on-one or small group therapy sessions. Learn more about counseling careers.\n\nDental: Dental health services careers include dentist, periodontist, and oral surgeon. These and other healthcare workers treat medical conditions and injuries afflicting the teeth, gums, jaw, and related structures. Learn more about dental careers and the best online dental hygiene programs in 2024.\n\nLaboratory and diagnostic: Laboratory and diagnostic technicians, assistants, and specialists test patients' biological samples, such as urine, blood, and biopsy tissue. The results they produce help physicians diagnose illness and develop a treatment plan.\n\nSubstance use care: Substance use careers involve diagnosing addiction, identifying root causes, and developing a personalized treatment plan. Services may include outpatient therapy sessions, inpatient recovery plans lasting up to one month, and group meetings.\n\nPreventative care: Preventative care professionals encourage positive life choices, such as a healthy diet, immunizations, and yearly medical exams. This care reduces the risk of illness later in life, including cancer caused by smoking or excessive alcohol consumption.\n\nPhysical and occupational therapy: Physical and occupational therapists help people regain mobility and live independently. They may specialize in working with people with a disability or children.\n\nNutritional support: Many people struggle with proper nutrition. Nutritional support services can include educating patients regarding dietary best practices, administering tube feeding, and prescribing IV therapy to provide essential nutrients and calories. Learn more about the best online nutrition programs in 2024.\n\nPharmaceutical: Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians provide essential healthcare services, such as dispensing prescribed medication and educating patients about new prescriptions. They also answer patients' questions regarding related healthcare matters. Learn more about jobs in the pharmaceutical industry and how to become a pharmacist.\n\nTransportation: Nonemergency and nonmedical transportation services help patients travel between their homes and healthcare providers. Drivers in the latter category do not need specialized healthcare training or experience.\n\nPrenatal care: Prenatal care providers treat expecting mothers and their unborn children. These providers may perform ultrasounds or other medical procedures to determine an unborn child's health.\n\nPopular Online Health Services Degree Programs\n\nLearn about start dates, transferring credits, availability of financial aid, and more by contacting the universities below.\n\nHealth Services Career Paths and Salary\n\nYou can explore many health services career paths, including medical, allied health, mental health, and healthcare administration. Each features different education and experience requirements, and some roles also offer greater salary potential.\n\nThis section describes healthcare services careers and projected job growth statistics for 2022-2032. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) makes these projections by analyzing hiring, retirement, and economic trends. Keep in mind that changing economic circumstances, such as recessions, can significantly affect actual job growth.\n\nMedical Professionals\n\nMedical professionals include physicians, surgeons, and nurses. Physicians and surgeons diagnose and treat patients experiencing illness or injury. Nurses specialize in performing medical tests, administering medication, and recording patients' medical histories.\n\nAlthough the BLS projects only a 3% job growth rate for physicians and surgeons, specialties with better growth potential include psychiatrists and pathologists. The BLS projects 6% growth for registered nurses, which is somewhat faster than the average projected growth for all U.S. professions.\n\nLearn more about nursing degrees and careers\n\nAllied Health Professionals\n\nThe allied health field includes all healthcare workers besides physicians, surgeons, and nurses. Allied health professionals can work as medical assistants, laboratory technologists, or occupational therapists. These and other careers may require specialized education and training, working directly with patients, and licensure.\n\nThe BLS projects the need for respiratory therapists to grow by 13%, faster than many other health services careers. Although the BLS projects only 5% growth in the clinical laboratory technologist field, some entry-level positions require only an associate degree.\n\nLearn more about the Best Online Doctorate in Occupational Therapy Programs\n\nMental Health Professionals\n\nMental health professionals such as psychologists, therapists, and counselors treat mental health disorders. Insights gained through testing or therapy sessions let mental health workers develop a treatment plan, including cognitive-behavioral therapy. They may refer patients to a psychiatrist if they think patients would benefit from medication.\n\nThe BLS projects 6% growth in the psychology field, with the greatest need in clinical and counseling psychology. The BLS projects an impressive 15% growth rate for marriage and family therapists. The BLS bases this figure on the increasing popularity of integrated care.\n\nHealthcare Administration and Management\n\nMedical and health services managers coordinate budgets, develop employees' work schedules, and act as their employer's public face. They may coordinate activities at a hospital, nursing home, or other healthcare setting. Well-paying healthcare administration careers include chief nursing officer, nursing director, and hospital CEO.\n\nDemographic and technological trends led the BLS to project a 28% growth rate for medical and health services managers. This figure significantly exceeds the BLS projection of 3% growth for top executives in all U.S. industries.\n\nSupportive Roles\n\nMany workers, including MRI technologists, pharmacy technicians, and home health aides, support other medical professionals and assist patients. They can work under a licensed physician, nurse, or pharmacist and may not provide patient care. However, many healthcare support roles require direct patient contact.\n\nThe BLS projects a strong 6% growth for pharmacy technicians due to the increasing number of older Americans with chronic diseases. These same trends led to the BLS projecting 22% growth in the need for home and personal care aids.\n\nPublic Health Services\n\nPublic health services professionals work with individuals and communities to promote better healthcare outcomes. Their campaigns educate people about poor health habits and ways to make positive changes. They may specialize in one of many areas, such as maternal health, health policy, or public health.\n\nThe BLS projects a 7% growth rate for health education specialists, based on local, state, and federal investments in public health education.\n\nLearn more about Best Online Bachelor's in Public Health Programs\n\nEmergency Services\n\nEMTs and paramedics respond to emergency calls, assess patients' vital signs, administer treatment, and transport patients to a hospital or another healthcare facility. Although these professionals work side by side, paramedics' advanced training lets them administer medication and monitor bodily functions.\n\nThe BLS projects the need for EMTs and paramedics to grow by 5%, somewhat faster than the average projection for all U.S. jobs. Completing paramedic training and earning industry certifications can increase your competitiveness in a tight job market.\n\nAlternative and Holistic Medicine\n\nAlternative and holistic medicine exists outside of traditional healthcare. Practices that include acupuncture come from ancient medical traditions. Some patients find value in alternative and holistic medicine due to its focus on patients' spiritual needs and the patient as an individual.\n\nTop-paying states for acupuncturists include Minnesota, Rhode Island, and Florida. Professionals in these states earn an average salary exceeding $107,000. Oregon and New Jersey also feature a high average salary.\n\nPopular Jobs in Health Services Job Description Salary Home Health and Personal Care Aides Assist patients with routine tasks, such as feeding and dressing $33,530 Pharmacy Technicians Fill patients' prescriptions and perform other tasks assigned by a pharmacist $40,300 EMTs and Paramedics Provide lifesaving care while transporting patients to a hospital $44,780 Marriage and Family Therapists Help people repair and maintain family relationships $58,510 Laboratory Technologists Process biological samples at hospital labs or off-site facility $60,780 Health Education Specialists Promote community health through educational programs $62,860 Respiratory Therapists Help patients maintain and improve lung function $77,960 Acupuncturists Treat patients by inserting needles into patients' skin to treat pain, anxiety, and other medical conditions $78,220 Registered Nurses Provide patient care and track patients' progress under the supervision of a doctor $86,070 Psychologists Diagnose patients' mental health problems and administer treatment $92,740 Medical and Health Services Managers Organize and oversee a healthcare department or institution $110,680 Physicians and Surgeons Diagnose medical issues and provide treatment $239,200\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Health Services Careers\n\nWhich health services career is most in demand?\n\nChevron Down\n\nChevron Up\n\nThe BLS projects the pharmacy technician field to grow faster than other health services careers between 2022-2032. Other in-demand careers include marriage and family therapy.\n\nEconomic and demographic trends may make other careers more in demand by the time you start applying for jobs. Seek career advice from your program or college's counselors to help narrow down your options, build a resume, and network with potential employers.\n\nWhat is the easiest health services job to get into?\n\nChevron Down\n\nChevron Up\n\nHealth services careers, such as home health and personal care aide, may require only a high school diploma and little formal training. However, professionals in this job earn significantly less than other healthcare workers. Consider earning an undergraduate degree to raise your salary potential.\n\nWhat is the least stressful job in health services?\n\nChevron Down\n\nChevron Up\n\nWhile determining what constitutes a \"stressful job\" is subjective, some may find that roles that do not provide direct patient care may be less stressful. Jobs like laboratory technology and public health nursing may experience less stress than workers in other health services careers, as they do not work directly with patients and their families. Treating patients and working in an unpredictable healthcare environment can increase stress, making it not ideal for all workers interested in a healthcare career.\n\nWhat are alternative careers in health services?\n\nChevron Down\n\nChevron Up\n\nSome examples of an alternative career in health services are a physician running clinical trials for a pharmaceutical company or an experienced nurse working as a health coach or educator.\n\nStart exploring your career options as soon as possible. Coworkers, managers, and other advisors can help you uncover new opportunities.\n\nHow do I switch to a career in health services?\n\nChevron Down\n\nChevron Up\n\nEntering the health services field may require significant education and training. Top-earning professionals hold a license or graduate degree.\n\nResearch your chosen career's latest requirements, state regulations, and hiring trends to plan for a successful transition.
