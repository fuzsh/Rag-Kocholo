Glenigan, Groundsure, De Havilland and Planet Retail/RNG are already 100 per cent digital and events businesses.\"\n\nTop Right Group chief executive Duncan Painter said: \"Customers are sending a clear message: digital subscriptions and live events are the formats they want to engage with. This change finalises our group’s migration to a digital and large scale events company.”\n\nThe new operating company will be holding a customer launch in November.\n\nEmap chief executive Natasha Christie-Miller will head up the new merged business.\n\nShe said: “This is a fantastically exciting time in the evolution of our businesses and creating this new company is an opportunity to finalise the successful digital migration of our great brands which started 4 years ago. The 4C, Planet Retail and EMAP businesses already have many things in common, including a lot of the same customers and we create products that meet similar customer needs. These needs are all linked by the need to know more, and the need to connect with the right people.”\n\nTop Right Group is still jointly owned by Apax and Guardian Media Group.\n\nIn 2014 it reported EBITDA profit of £85.3m on turnover of £312.7m.\n\nEmap began life in 1947 as regional newspaper group the East Midland Allied Press. It moved into magazines with the launch of Angling Times in 1953."
