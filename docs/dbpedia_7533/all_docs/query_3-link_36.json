        "text": "Smith was very much concerned with the welfare of the community and created The Wealth of Nations, to put forth most of his economic ideas, that are still considered today. The message Adam Smith alleged was that since people satisfied their own self needs, then the economy would work affectively. For example, “When people look to their own self-interests, they contribute unintentionally, by means of an invisible hand , to the welfare of society” (Smith 281). Smith talks about the invisible hand as a guiding tool towards supply and demand within a society and argued the division of labor generates wealth not just for that one person but for the nation as a whole. By selling products that are in demand, for the purpose of earning money people are engaging in within their enterprises. Additionally, the more demands, the more people want to invest, the more people need to work, the harder it is to find a job when the economy is at a low. Today, the invisible-hand theory is often guides free markets and capitalism in the direction of efficiency, through supply and demand and competition for scarce resources.\n\n“All previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the interest of minorities. The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority. The proletariat, the lowest stratum of our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise itself up without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into the air.” (Page 222). Karl Marx wrote The Communist Manifesto. This is a really important essay. It has three sections in the book that I read it from. Robert B. Reich wrote Why the Rich Are Getting Richer and the Poor, Poorer. This was widely discussed and still is. That is how important this essay it to people. These two essays are about economics. They may not agree on things, but they are both respected and discussed in many colleges. According to Aijaz Ahmad, “Earlier texts include passages and entire sections of great originality. However, virtually all of them are written in opposition to some particular writers or tendencies, i.e., Hegel and the others we have mentioned above. This kind of focused criticism is continued in the latter section of the Manifesto as well, but the memorable first part can be viewed as perhaps the first of Marx 's texts that is written entirely in the declarative, in opposition to not this or that thinker, this or that tendency in thought, but in opposition to bourgeois society as a whole.\n\nAdam Smith is a proponent of capitalism, more specifically, laissez faire economic. Laissez faire is an economic policy in which businesses operate in the free market with little to no regulation from the government in a free market. Smith would disagree with Karl Marx because the two have different idea when it comes to economics. Smith argues that capitalism is the best form of economics because human self interest drives positive results in the economy. In addition, Smith would argue that invisible hand of the marketplace would help control the economy through supply and demand. When the supply is greater than the demand, the price of the product would be lower than the standard price. The opposite is that when supply is lower than the demand, the price would be above the standard price. With this, Smith believes that laissez faire would be the ideal economic plan. Furthermore, Smith would also argue that competition would lead to better product for the people as competition forces businesses to compete with each other for customers, leading to innovations and better products.\n\nSmith believed that self, self-interest, and self-determination, all were mechanisms where individuals are motivated to gain wealth and power for individual gain and group gain. Smith believed that self' is a matrix of reason and passion (Levine, 1998). Furthermore, Smith believed that sympathy leads to empathy, and our individual self-determination leads to accumulation of wealth that benefits others as well as us (Levine, 1998). Examples of this concept are evident in our current economic society today. We see Bill Gates and Microsoft providing technology to communicate more efficiently, Henry Ford's posterity changing the transportation market, and many others who impact man with their accumulation of wealth.\n\nIn, The Wealth of Nations, Smith explained why capitalism is the most known economic system. He gives credit to the defenders of the principle parrot his basic arguments. The theme of The Wealth of Nations is what Smith's supporters called the doctrine of laissez-faire capitalism. This doctrine had the world of economics functions under natural laws. It operated exclusively on politics. Government in the economic order of things did not like these natural laws, and said the laws disrupted the nation's economy. The hands-off policy permits citizens to complete economic freedom, and shows that governments could promise the growth of a nation's wealth. Smith realized that under a free enterprise system, individuals would pursue their own self-interests. He said that selfish individuals need competition, so\n\nAdam Smith, an Enlightenment economist, advocated for a laissez-faire approach to the economy, leaving the citizens the right to control their economic system. He recommended that the government deregulate trade and allow people to be “perfectly free to pursue his own interest in his own way.” (Doc C) Since people work for their own benefit, Smith argued that the workers, while striving for their own economic gain, would ultimately benefit the entire society, “led by an invisible hand,” (Doc C) which would equate the supply and demand of the free market. By giving people the right to decide how the\n\nCapitalism is an omnipresent system that has taken on many unique and defined forms throughout its existence. While capitalism comes in a variety of disguises, one thing about capitalism has always remained the same – the nature of its selfish being. Capitalism thrives on hard work. Individuals that work hard will undoubtedly be rewarded. On the contrary, those that are not able to work are left in a dreadful predicament. Even with two distinct versions of capitalism – plain capitalism and democratic capitalism – both involve the necessary component of free enterprise. Capitalism considers free enterprise something to be achieved individually with rewards intended for just oneself. Adam Smith came along and challenged that notation\n\nEconomist Adam Smith felt pretty strongly about this idea and influenced the development of it. His argument was that if markets were competitive, the actions of private individuals who were driven by themselves, worked together for the greater good of society. What a good thought, if people worked hard and motivated themselves everything would work out, sounds nice. Too bad it’s too good to be true and some kind of government regulation has be involved. Smith did encourage some forms of intervention but mainly only to establish the ground rules for free enterprise.\n\nTwo of the most influential and celebrated modern political thinkers, Karl Marx and John Locke, have made countless insightful and compelling arguments, expressing their ideas on various conditions of the individual, state, and the interactions between the two. Marx was a German political thinker who was best known for his works with idea of communism and social class divisions. Locke was an English philosopher famous for his social contract and is known as the Father of Liberalism (CITE). Despite the paramount success these men achieved, they had radically different views on the idea of property and the description of freedom, finding only minimal similarity on their views on the right to revolt.\n\nAdam Smith was a British economist who helped to create the system of capitalism that we use today. Adam Smith was one of the major critics of the old system of mercantilism as was seen in his book The Wealth of Nations. He was against mercantilism because he felt like the people worked to make the place where they lived rich and not themselves. Mercantilism was based on a few major points, most important was that the state must have a favorable balance of trade, which means that they must export more than they import. As you can see in our nation today our balance is not in our favor but yet we remain to be the richest country ever. Mercantilism also focused on the idea of bullionism, which was having hard currency in gold and silver to back up trade. Smith’s idea was that they would take parts of mercantilism and create this new system capitalism. He felt that in a society with free enterprise people would be able to pursue profit themselves, and this would also benefit the society as well. Smith advocated the new system of capitalism to replace mercantilism. Smith created this idea of the “invisible hand” which was a theory that\n\nThe advent of the ideal of capitalism is often attributed to Adam Smith. Sometimes called “The Father of Economics,” Smith was an 18th century moral philosopher from Scotland. Smith is perhaps most known for writing the book “An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.” In this book Adam Smith considers and advances the ideas of the division of labor, the invisible hand, the pursuit of self-interest, the proper role of government and the idea of a Laissez-Faire (or noninterventionist) economy. Each of these ideas were considered heavily during the establishment and development of the United States. Because of their adoption into the new American government, the United States became the forerunner to the free-market.\n\n“Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defense of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all.” This quote by Adam Smith captures the essence of his view on government. He realized that the governing body would use the power they possessed to their advantage. It is simply part human nature. By recognizing this, Smith was able to create an economic system that would, in theory, allow the individual to do anything in his/her economic interest."
