($) Income for 20 hrs. of Work Cost of Production Beavers Trap(12) + Hunt(8) = 20 $10/hr. $200 $200 Deer Bow & Arrow(4) + Hunt(6) = 10 $10/hr. $200 $100\n\nAlthough the market price may fluctuate often due to supply and demand at any given moment, the natural price acts as a center of gravity, consistently attracting the prices to itâ€”if the market price overshoots the natural price, people will be incentivized to sell more of it, while if the market price underestimates the natural price, the incentive is to buy more of it. Over time, this competition will tend to bring relative prices back into line with the natural price. This means that the labor that is used to produce economic goods is what determines their value and their market prices because it determines the natural price.\n\nLabor Theory and Marxism\n\nThe labor theory of value interlaced nearly every aspect of Marxian analysis. Marx's economic work, Das Kapital, was almost entirely predicated on the tension between capitalist owners of the means of production and the labor power of the proletariat working class.\n\nMarx was drawn to the labor theory because he believed human labor was the only common characteristic shared by all goods and services exchanged on the market. For Marx, however, it was not enough for two goods to have an equivalent amount of labor; instead, the two goods must have the same amount of \"socially necessary\" labor.\n\nMarx used the labor theory to launch a critique against free-market classical economists in the tradition of Adam Smith. If, he asked, all goods and services in a capitalist system are sold at prices that reflect their true value, and all values are measured in labor hours, how can capitalists ever enjoy profits unless they pay their workers less than the real value of their labor? It was on this basis that Marx developed the exploitation theory of capitalism.\n\nCritiques of the Labor Theory of Value\n\nThe labor theory of value leads to obvious problems theoretically and in practice. One critique is that it is possible to expend a large quantity of labor time on producing a good that ends up having little or no value. However, a closer reading points to the fact that commodities conforming to the LTV would have both a use-value and an exchange-value, and be reproduceable. Therefore something that has no demand in the market or with little or no use-value would not be considered a commodity according to the LTV. The same would go for a unique object such as a work of fine art, which would too be excluded. It may take one person longer than another to produce some commodity. Marx's concept of socially necessary labor time does also get around this problem.\n\nA second critique is that goods that require the same amount of labor time to produce often have widely different market prices on a regular basis. Moreover, the observed relative prices of goods fluctuate greatly over time, regardless of the amount of labor time expended upon their production, and often do not maintain or tend toward any stable ratio (or natural price). According to the labor theory of value, this should be impossible, yet it is an easily observed, daily norm.\n\nHowever, market price and value are two different (although closely-related) concepts. While market price is driven by the immediate supply and demand for a commodity, these prices act as signals to both producers and consumers. When prices are high, it incentivizes producers to make more (increasing the supply) and discourages buyers (reducing demand), or vice-versa. As a result, over the long run, prices should tend to fluctuation around the value.\n\nThe Subjectivist Theory Takes Over\n\nThe labor theory's problems were finally resolved by the subjective theory of value. This theory stipulates exchange value is based on individual subject evaluations of the use value of economic goods. Value emerges from human perceptions of usefulness. People produce economic goods because they value them.\n\nThis discovery also reversed the relationship between input costs and market prices. While the labor theory argued input costs determined final prices, the subjectivist theory showed the value of inputs was based on the potential market price of final goods. The subjective theory of value says that the reason people are willing to expend labor time producing economic goods is for the usefulness of the goods. In a sense, this theory is the exact reverse of the labor theory of value. In the labor theory of value, labor time expended causes economic goods to be valuable; in the subjective theory of value, the use value people get from goods causes them to be willing to expend labor to produce them."
