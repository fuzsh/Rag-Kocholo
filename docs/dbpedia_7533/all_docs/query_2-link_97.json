By contrast, Marx extensively insists much of what Smith called “natural” is in fact social. Smith believed that each individual would try to maximize his own utility and gains. As a result, consumers would pay as what they would value the benefit of the good as, and producers would only sell as much as they spent of producing the good or higher based on value.
