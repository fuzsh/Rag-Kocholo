Entry updated 12 September 2022. Tagged: Author, Publisher.

(1927-2009) US Small-Press publisher whose imprints were the Grandon Company (formerly the Hadley Publishing Company, renamed after its buy-out by Grant) and, later, Donald M Grant Publisher. He published and co-compiled the early Bibliography "333": A Bibliography of the Science-Fantasy Novel (1953 chap) with Joseph H Crawford Jr (1932- ) and James J Donahue, with assistance by Joseph W Bateman and J Lloyd Eaton (see J Lloyd Eaton Collection); "333" is a central document of early scholarship in the field (see Fandom), its annotated checklist of sf and fantasy up to 1950 providing a clear sense of the canon of American sf as it was then conceived. After Fantasy Press folded in 1958, Grant acquired its stock, including large numbers of unbound signatures which over the years he had bound and released in editions almost identical to Fantasy Press's. In the 1970s he published handsome editions of Robert E Howard's Conan stories, based on their original magazine texts and illustrated by Roy G Krenkel.

Grant edited the critical anthologies Rhode Island on Lovecraft (anth 1945 chap), with Thomas P Hadley and Virgil Finlay (anth 1971) (see Virgil Finlay). His one fiction anthology is the anonymously edited Swordsmen and Supermen (anth 1972). Talbot Mundy: Messenger of Destiny (anth 1983) is a "bio-bibliography" of Talbot Mundy, with essays by others including Fritz Leiber. In 2003 Grant received the World Fantasy Award for lifetime achievement. [DRL]
