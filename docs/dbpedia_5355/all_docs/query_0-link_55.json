        "text": "March 18, 2018\n\nA really curious grab-bag of stories.\n\n\"How Sargoth Lay Siege to Zaremm\" would require five more pages in order to be considered a 'confection'. Lin Carter writing in a Lord Dunsany mode but without the irony or hidden meanings.\n\n\"Meet Cap'n Kidd\" a Breckinridge Elkins piece by Robert E Howard. It's in a humorous mode, and while Howard manages the action well and it is very sympathetic to the rough-mannered but straight-shooting and crafty Elkins, you either like this sort of thing or you don't. I don't.\n\n\"The Slave of Marathon\" is part of this Grey Maiden series from the old _Adventure Magazine_ pulp, tracing the history of a magical blade through the hands of various people and through major conflicts of history. The Grey Maiden itself has a bit of Stormbringer in it, but I'd really have to see more of the stories to make a major judgement. This one is gritty, realistic tactical warfare.\n\n\"The Death of a Hero\" is a fragment of d'Esme's novel The Red Gods which looks like it has but a single 1923 edition in English. The editor carefully selected the portion such that it starts without preamble, ends in a curious cliffhanger, and the middle may abandon the lantern-jawed European protagonist in favor of the \"Red Man\" primitive Maa-Wang. I'm intrigued by what d'Esme offers, but the florid writing is a warning.\n\nAnd, finally, \"Wings of Y'vrn\". Darrel Crombie apparently has nothing else to his name, despite Grant's talking-up of his abilities and his future. The imagery and construction here is so striking and so utterly weird that you can see an expert latching onto it, readers being turned off by it, and an author struggling to produce more.\n\nCrombie describes a mystical tradition that reminded me of the intricate systems of Peter Valentine Timlett's The Seedbearers and sequels, yet has the descriptions and splash one would see out of E. E. \"Doc\" Smith. The magic-wielder Y'vrn constructs matrices of images or glyphs which respond in circuits and provide rays and screens and power fields and pocket dimensions and energization and geometry. In small doses this pseudo-psychic system is quite remarkable, but it quickly bogs down into fiddly details and highly specific descriptions and plot contrivances and other weird Doctor Strange nonsense that feels like it should make sense but doesn't. This is a short story to make a reader stop and stare.\n\nApril 28, 2021\n\nThis review previously appeared on the DMR Books Blog.\n\n“A most unusual volume of swashbuckling high adventure stories with a heavy accent on the fantastic” promises the back cover. The first tale is certainly an unusual choice: “Meet Cap’n Kidd,” a humorous western yarn by Robert E. Howard. The Cap’n Kidd of the title is a furious wild stallion “as full of rambunctiousness as a drunk Apache on the warpath.” Our hero, Breckinridge Elkins, naturally decides to try his hand at taming him. I’m not a fan of westerns, but I found the story amusing enough once I got used to the dialect (sample: “I cooked me nine or ten squirrels over a fire and et ‘em, and while that warn’t much of a supper for a appertite like mine, still I figgered next day I’d stumble on to a b’ar”).\n\nNext we have “The Death of a Hero” by Jean D’Esme. This is actually an excerpt from “The Red Gods,” a novel set in Indo-China that was first published in 1924. In the excerpt, Wanda Redeski convinces a native to rescue her companions who have been captured by priests. The ensuing battle is described vividly, but I’m sure it would have had much more impact in context.\n\nDarrel Crombie contributes the next story, “Wings of Y’vrn,” one of the two originals in the anthology. It’s pure sword and sorcery, ‘70s style, and it’s very goofy. Y’vrn is able to change his shape and create matter via “matrix frames” on his “mental screens.” He has been tasked by Mal-Kiz of S’lmm with stealing Queen Dharga’s wand. Should he fail, the reputation of S’lmm will be sullied. This story is by no means good, but I suppose it could be enjoyed in the same way as dumb B-movies like The Dungeon Master. The introduction claims Crombie is “a writer with a style, vocabulary, and imagination to take the reader back in time to the more fertile days of fantasy production,” but this is no substitute for the real thing. This becomes even more apparent when reading the next story, which was originally published in the July 23rd, 1926 issue of Adventure. “The Slave of Marathon” is part of Arthur D. Howden Smith’s historical series about the Grey Maiden, a mythical sword said to be forged at the beginning of time. In this installment, the sword is in the possession of a Persian who uses it to slay Giton of Athens. Glaucus, an outspoken slave, swears to avenge the death of his master’s friend. This is far and away the best story in the book.\n\nLin Carter wraps things up with the other exclusive story, “How Sargoth Lay Siege to Zaremm.” To put it bluntly, it’s a rip off of Lord Dunsany. However, Carter actually does a much better job here than with his imitations of Howard and Burroughs.\n\nOn the whole, it’s not a bad collection, but probably not worth the trouble of tracking down a copy."
