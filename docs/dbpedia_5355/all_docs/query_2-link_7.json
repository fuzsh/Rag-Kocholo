How can I recertify?\n\nI missed the deadline for my Cash Assistance recertification and now I’m afraid I will lose benefits. Can I still recertify?\n\nWho can apply?\n\nDo I need to have a Social Security Number (SSN) to be eligible for benefits?\n\nGenerally, to be eligible for Cash Assistance benefits, you and all of the members of your household must have a valid Social Security Number (SSN) or show proof of having applied for one. ACCESS HRA keeps all of your information private and secure.\n\nIf you are applying for Cash Assistance benefits on behalf of your children and you are an undocumented immigrant you do not need to have or show that you applied for an SSN, and the Agency cannot take unfavorable actions against your household. Your children must have a valid SSN or have applied for one to be eligible for Cash Assistance benefits.\n\nWhat if I don't have an SSN?\n\nWill my immigration status impact my eligibility?\n\nWho needs to be on my application for Cash Assistance?\n\nWhat will the application ask?\n\nIs the online Cash Assistance application different from the paper Cash Assistance application?\n\nWhat are the advantages of submitting a completed application online?\n\nNext Steps/ Completing the Eligibility Process\n\nWhat do you need to make an eligibility decision on my application?\n\nWhat if I miss my scheduled interview?\n\nIf you miss your interview you will receive an automated call and reminder letter in the mail telling you that you missed your appointment. You will be given a telephone number to call to reschedule your interview. You will also receive a missed appointment letter on which you will find the number to reschedule your interview. If you are a participant you will receive the automated call and written reminder but can also contact your worker.\n\nHow will I complete my Cash Assistance interview?\n\nHow can I submit documents for my eligibility?\n\nDo I have to work in order to get benefits?\n\nGenerally, if you are considered able-bodied, you have to comply with the agency work requirements. There are various ways to meet the work requirements such as: being enrolled in an HRA approved education/training program or being enrolled in an approved two-year or four-year college degree program, or if you are currently employed full time. There are exemptions based on age, medical and physical limitations, and other considerations. You should speak to your worker to discuss any possible exemptions for which you or other household members may qualify. But remember, the goal is for you and the members of your household to become self-sufficient.\n\nAm I eligible for Emergency Assistance?\n\nYou may be qualified to receive Emergency Assistance if you have an unforeseeable emergency such as a utility turnoff, pending eviction from you home/apartment, you have no food, or need to replace clothes or furniture because you suffered a fire or other disaster at your home/apartment.\n\nHow soon will I get my benefits?\n\nBefore you can receive benefits, you must have an in person interview with an HRA worker so they can begin to figure out what benefits you are qualified to receive. Depending on the type of program benefit for which you qualify, it may take up to 30 to 45 days to get regular benefits, but for certain cases it may be sooner. If you apply for emergency/immediate needs assistance it may be much sooner depending on the emergency.\n\nInquiries/ Check Status\n\nIf my application is denied, how soon can I apply again?\n\nYou have the right to reapply at any time.\n\nHow can I check the status of my Cash Assistance application?\n\nWhat if I already submitted my application or recertification (by mail, fax, or online)?\n\nThere is no need to submit an application online if you have just recently submitted another application for the same program to HRA. Someone from HRA will be contacting you to schedule an interview for your application.\n\nPlease contact InfoLine at 718-557-1399 to find out the status of your application.\n\nCan I receive text messages or emails about my application or case?\n\nYes you can!\n\nIf you opt-in to receiving text messages and/or emails about your application, and you provide accurate email and cell phone information, you can receive emails and/or text messages about your application and upcoming appointment dates.\n\nEmails\n\nFirst, you will be sent an email from us asking you to confirm your email address. After opening that email and clicking on the link, your email address will be confirmed in our system and you will start receiving emails about your application or case. We will never share your email address or send confidential case information over email.\n\nTexts\n\nIf you wish to receive text messages about your application or case, please provide a contact number where we can send text messages.
