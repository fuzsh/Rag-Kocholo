        "text": "M. Donald Grant, a winning amateur competitor in hockey, squash and golf who became the controversial chairman of the Mets and enjoyed mixed success, died at his home in Hobe Sound, Fla., on Saturday. He was 94.\n\nAs the Mets' chairman, Mr. Grant made the key move that led to the team's surprising World Series championship in 1969, hiring Gil Hodges as manager in 1968. But Mr. Grant became best known for trading pitcher Tom Seaver, the Mets' ''franchise,'' in 1977, even though the dispute that led to the trade was triggered by Seaver's desire to renegotiate his contract.\n\n''I cannot even go into my own seat in my own stadium,'' Mr. Grant said of Shea Stadium after the trade. ''I have become lower than the lowliest bum on the street.''\n\nThe fans did not care why Seaver, an eventual Hall of Famer, was sent to Cincinnati, just that he was. They did not care that he had a three-year contract that he wanted to renegotiate in the face of escalating salaries with the advent of free agency.\n\n''It didn't sit well with my father that Seaver had signed a contract and now wanted to renegotiate it,'' Michael Grant Jr. said. ''He really dug his heels in about that. He was a word-is-your-bond kind of guy.''\n\nJust before he was traded, Seaver switched tactics and asked Lorinda de Roulet, daughter of the late Joan Payson, the Mets' original owner, for a contract extension, and she agreed to it.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
