        "text": "Harvard College founded in 1636, is the oldest institution of higher education in the United States. Harvard College offers a four-year undergraduate, liberal arts program for students seeking their first degree. There are about 6,600 undergraduates at the College, with nearly equal numbers of men and women. In addition to Harvard College, Harvard University includes 12 graduate and professional schools, all of which offer programs for students who already hold their first degrees and seek advanced training in their fields through master's or doctoral programs. All 12 graduate and professional schools maintain their own admissions offices and teaching faculties, and they are run independently of Harvard College. For information about Harvard's graduate programs, please contact these schools' admissions offices directly.\n\nCommitment to liberal arts & sciences is at the core of Harvard College’s mission: before students can help change the world, they need to understand it. The liberal arts & sciences offer a broad intellectual foundation for the tools to think critically, reason analytically and write clearly. These proficiencies will prepare students to navigate the world’s most complex issues, and address future innovations with unforeseen challenges. Shaped by ideas encountered and created, these new modes of thinking will prepare students for leading meaningful lives, with conscientious global citizenship, to enhance the greater good.\n\nHarvard offers General Education courses that show the liberal arts and sciences in action. They pose enduring questions, they frame urgent problems, and they help students see that no one discipline can answer those questions or grapple with those problems on its own. Students are challenged to ask difficult questions, explore unfamiliar concepts, and indulge in their passion for inquiry and discovery across disciplines.\n\nWhile you can take courses related to these fields, Harvard's academic programs are not pre-professional, in that they do not provide vocational training. Many Harvard graduates plan to continue their education in professional or graduate schools, often in these fields. Please note that both medicine and law are postgraduate programs in the United States. If you are not a U.S. citizen but wish to continue your education in a professional program, particularly in an American medical school, we advise you to consult specific graduate and professional programs in advance to understand those schools' admissions and financial aid policies concerning international students.\n\nMost first-year dorms have suites for three to six students. Suites contain from two to four bedrooms and a common room. A few have their own baths, though most share a bathroom with other suites. The First-Year Experience Office assigns students to suites rather than to particular bedrooms, and in almost any suite students should expect to share a bedroom for at least part of the first year. Some dorms contain doubles, usually one fairly large room with a shared bath.\n\nWoven into Harvard's residences are a variety of academic and other advising resources that make the residential experience at Harvard distinctive. First-year students benefit from the guidance that resident proctors provide about living in Cambridge and studying at the College. Each House also has its own staff of advisers called resident tutors who are similar to first-year proctors but with expertise in particular academic and professional fields. Harvard offers extensive advising resources of other kinds. If you need extra help in coursework, you can turn to the Academic Resource Center. The Mignone Center for Career Success (MCS) offers career counseling. The University maintains its own outstanding health services. The Undergraduate Financial Aid Office will help you with financial aid issues, and the Student Employment Office will help place you in jobs on and off campus. Finally, if you are an international student, the International Office is there for your special needs.\n\nThe $85 admissions application processing fee can be paid online through the online application system (either the Common Application or the Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir). Please note that the Common Application and Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir, websites are operated independently, and their respective offices are better able to assist you with specific logistical issues you may encounter while submitting the application forms or your fee through their sites.\n\nYou may also send a check drawn on a US bank in US dollars to: Harvard College Admissions 86 Brattle Street Cambridge, MA 02138. Please be sure to write the name and date of birth of the applicant on the check.\n\nWe are committed to making the application process accessible for all students. If the admissions application fee presents a hardship for you or your family, the fee will be waived. You can request a fee waiver. Please follow these instructions to learn how to get your fee waived.\n\nThe Admissions Committee does not expect applicants to go to extraordinary measures to access SAT or ACT test sites. If students attend schools that offer SAT or ACT testing onsite, or live or attend schools close to accessible test sites, we will expect them to take the tests and submit scores with their Harvard application. However, if students do not have access to nearby test sites, the Admissions Committee still welcomes applications from these students. We encourage students in that situation to submit results from other standardized tests to which they have greater access. For instance, students lacking access to the SAT or ACT may submit AP results/IB/GCSE/A-level/other national leaving exam predictions or results.\n\nIf the cost of taking the SAT or ACT is of concern, keep in mind that both the College Board and ACT provide fee waivers to some domestic students from low-income families. Students who are non-US citizens attending secondary schools outside the US are not typically eligible for SAT or ACT fee waivers. If applicants are ineligible for fee waivers, but still face financial hardship in paying for a SAT or ACT, the Admissions Committee still encourages these students to apply. We encourage students in this situation to take and submit results from other standardized tests to which they have greater access. For instance, students lacking access to the SAT or ACT may submit AP results or IB/GCSE/A-level/other national leaving exam predictions or results.\n\nThe decision to return to requiring testing was motivated by a number of important new insights, including research led by Harvard faculty members that confirms the role of standardized testing to help predict college and post-college success for students, including those from less-resourced backgrounds, particularly when considered together with other academic credentials. We also know that, when given the choice, many applicants choose not to submit scores. This can disadvantage some students, including low-income and minority applicants, who also may be disadvantaged in other aspects of their application because of lack of academic opportunity.\n\nMore information about an applicant, especially such strongly predictive information, can be valuable. Reinstating a testing requirement will bring important and consistent information back into the admissions process. In Harvard’s whole-person review process, testing is just one data point among many considered carefully with the expertise of the admissions committee.\n\nWe recognize that this requirement brings certain challenges. Access to testing should never prevent a student from applying to Harvard. In addition to providing alternative test options for those who cannot access the SAT or ACT, Harvard College Admissions provides information on sources for no-cost tutoring and test preparation.\n\nHarvard will accept the SAT or ACT to meet the standardized testing requirement. In exceptional cases, when those are not accessible for a student, one of the following can meet the requirement:\n\nAP exam results\n\nIB Actual or Predicted Scores\n\nGCSE/A-Level Actual or Predicted Results\n\nNational Leaving Exams Results or Predictions\n\nEnglish language proficiency examinations such as the TOEFL, IELTS and Duolingo cannot be used to meet the standardized testing requirement, though students are welcome to submit them for review as part of their application materials.\n\nStudents may self report their standardized test scores.\n\nIf the cost of taking the SAT or ACT is of concern, keep in mind that both the College Board and ACT provide fee waivers to some domestic students from low-income families. Students who are non-US citizens attending secondary schools outside the US are not typically eligible for SAT or ACT fee waivers. If applicants are ineligible for fee waivers, but still face financial hardship in paying for a SAT or ACT, the Admissions Committee still encourages these students to apply. We encourage students in this situation to take and submit results from other standardized tests to which they have greater access. For instance, students lacking access to the SAT or ACT may submit AP or GCSE results, IB/A-level/other national leaving exam predictions or results.\n\nWhen reading an application, the Admissions Committee reviews test scores, along with all other aspects of the application, to get to know the person behind the numbers. Harvard has found that SAT and ACT scores are the best predictors of Harvard grades. The Committee also understands that SAT and ACT tests are one aspect of a student’s application.\n\nAdmissions officers take into consideration that not all students attend well-resourced schools throughout their lives, and that those who come from modest economic backgrounds or first-generation college families may have had fewer opportunities to prepare for standardized tests. Each application to Harvard is read with great care, keeping in mind the context of a student’s high school and community and in recognition that talent is everywhere, but opportunity and access are not.\n\nYes. Applicants may provide self-reported test scores. Admitted students who self-report SAT and ACT scores and decide to enroll at Harvard College will be required to submit official SAT and ACT test scores upon enrolling. Other test scores will be reviewed through the final transcript review process. View our application tips for specific information on how to self-report your scores.\n\nIf you were eligible for a fee waiver from the SAT or ACT, you are eligible for unlimited free score reports to be sent to institutions to which you are applying. We recommend you use your free score reports to share your scores with Harvard.\n\nYes. Students admitted in the Early Action and Regular Decision rounds can choose to defer their admission by selecting the \"I defer\" option in their admitted student reply form.\n\nWe want to do everything possible to help the students we enroll make the most of their opportunities, avoiding the much reported \"burnout\" phenomenon that can keep them from reaching their full potential. Our overall graduation rate of 98%, among the highest in the nation, is perhaps due in part to the fact that so many students take time off, before or during college.\n\nThe admissions committee encourages admitted students to defer enrollment for one year to travel, pursue a special project or activity, work, or spend time in another meaningful way - provided they do not enroll in a degree-granting program at another college. Deferrals for two years are also considered for such purposes as military or religious service or under other unique circumstances, and subject to the approval of the admissions committee.\n\nEach year, between 90 and 130 students defer their matriculation to the College, and they report their experiences to be uniformly positive. After graduation, large numbers of Harvard students take time off before beginning work or graduate school. Read more about taking time off.\n\nIf a student has already replied as enrolling, but has since changed their mind and would like to defer, they may contact the Admissions Office or submit the Request to Defer form on the Admitted Students Website explaining the request for a deferral as soon as possible and in any event by the end of June.\n\nJust as in previous admissions cycles, applicants and those writing on behalf of applicants should feel welcome to write about any aspect of the applicant’s identity or background, including race and/or ethnicity. You do not have to withhold any information in any part of the application (e.g. extracurricular list, personal essay, Harvard’s supplemental questions, letters of recommendation, etc.) because of the Supreme Court’s decision regarding affirmative action. As the applicant, you are welcome to check the race/ethnicity boxes when completing the application, though that information will not be shared in the transmission of application data for review. As our admissions committee members review applications, it is incumbent on our staff to comply with the ruling of the Supreme Court in which we cannot consider race/ethnicity in our review of applications.\n\nThere is no single academic path we expect all students to follow, but the strongest applicants take the most rigorous secondary school curricula available to them. An ideal four-year preparatory program includes four years of English, with extensive practice in writing; four years of math*; four years of science: biology, chemistry, physics, and an advanced course in one of these subjects; three years of history, including American and European history; and four years of one foreign language.\n\n*​​Applicants to Harvard should excel in a challenging high school math sequence corresponding to their educational interests and aspirations. We recommend that applicants take four years of math courses in high school. Ideally, these math courses will focus on conceptual understanding, promote higher-order thinking, and encourage students to use mathematical reasoning to critically examine the world. Examples include rigorous and relevant courses in computer science, statistics and its subfields, mathematical modeling, calculus, and other advanced math subjects.\n\nStudents’ math records are viewed holistically, and no specific course is required. Specifically, calculus is not a requirement for admission to Harvard. We understand that applicants do not have the same opportunities and course offerings in their high schools. Moreover, many programs of study at Harvard do not require knowledge of calculus. We encourage applicants to take the courses that are available to them and aligned with their interests and goals.\n\nStudents intending to study engineering, computer science, physics, mathematics, statistics or other fields where calculus is needed may benefit from taking calculus in high school. However, students at Harvard can still pursue such fields by starting with one of our introductory calculus classes that has no high school calculus prerequisite. On balance, we encourage all students to master foundational mathematical material instead of rushing through any of the more advanced courses.\n\nUpon receipt of your application, we will send you a confirmation email with instructions on how to access the Applicant Portal. This portal allows you to view your record in our applicant database, to see which pieces of your application we've received and processed, and to make other changes to your application.\n\nThe data is updated nightly from the main admissions database and has the most up-to-date information available from our office. If you have sent us required materials that are shown in your status as not received, it is possible that those documents are being processed (along with thousands of others) in our office and simply have not yet made it to your file. Though we can not track each individual's materials upon request, we will conduct a thorough scrutiny of all files prior to committee evaluations. You will be contacted if you are missing required documents, and you will be given the opportunity to re-submit them without penalty.\n\nWe begin processing applications in September, and we confirm the receipt of each application to each applicant via email. Most applicants receive their application acknowledgement email the day after they submit their application (if it was submitted online). If you have submitted your application more than 2 weeks ago, and still have not received a confirmation email from us, it is likely that our email was undeliverable for some reason. Please check to make sure that your email account settings allow emails from college@fas.harvard.edu and fileroom@fas.harvard.edu. Also, please check any filtered mailboxes for spam/junk email to see if your confirmation was filtered there.\n\nIf you are still unable to locate your confirmation, it is possible that we have not received your application. If you submitted your application through the Common Application or Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir, please make sure that you have clicked the button to \"Submit\" and not just \"Save.\"\n\nOnce you have made sure that you have actually submitted your application and still have no confirmation, please send us an email with your full name, date of birth, and school. Let us know when you submitted your application and how, so that we may consult our records accordingly.\n\nThough you may have ordered your scores, it can sometimes take a couple of weeks for your scores to be officially sent and processed in our office. If your official scores do not show in your status page after a couple of weeks, please double check with the testing agency to make sure they were sent. Once you have confirmed the delivery, please check the name and personal information used on your scores. If this varies, even slightly, from what you have listed on your application, your scores will be automatically stored in a separate entry in our database. If this is the case, you can send an email to scores@fas.harvard.edu listing the discrepancy in your name/info, and your scores will be merged with your application file.\n\nWhen you submitted your application, we sent a confirmation email to the email address you listed on your application that included a PIN to access the applicant portal and create your own password. However, these e-mails are sent out in bulk from fileroom@fas.harvard.edu or college@fas.harvard.edu, so please check your spam/junk folder. We begin sending application acknowledgement emails in mid-September, so if you applied before then, please wait to receive this email from us before contacting our office.\n\nIf you have checked your email inbox and your spam folder, and you are still unable to find your application acknowledgement email, please contact the Admissions Office so that we can re-send it to you.\n\nThe cost of attendance used in calculating financial aid packages has, for many years, included a standard personal expenses allowance, meant to represent what you will spend on out-of-pocket costs like books and supplies, toiletries, laundry, entertainment etc. Starting in the 23-24 school year, we have split this expense into a “books and supplies” category, and a “personal expenses” category, in order to be clearer about what students may spend on books, course materials, supplies, and equipment. There has been no change to how these items work in your financial aid package – this is simply a language change.\n\nFor many years we have used the term “room” to represent the cost of housing at Harvard, and “board” to represent the cost of the meal plan. Students were charged “room” and “board” fees as part of their student term bill, and received aid towards “room and board” costs. The Department of Education has asked that schools change this language to “housing” and “food” costs. This is simply a language change meant to make costs clearer and easier to understand; there has been no change to how housing or meals work at Harvard, or to the amounts charged and used in financial aid calculations.\n\nThe term-time work expectation listed on your award letter is the amount of earnings during the academic year that we expect you to contribute toward your college costs. All earnings are paid directly to you, and it will be your responsibility to determine what portion of your earnings will be used towards billed (tuition, fees, housing and food, etc.) and/or non-billed (transportation and personal expenses, etc.) expenses. Students can work while at Harvard, but only some students are eligible for the Federal Work-Study Program (FWSP). Your financial aid letter will designate whether you can work in a job funded by FWSP or need to focus your job search on positions not funded by the program. Please note: You may request a student loan to replace or supplement part or all of a job expectation (term-time or FWSP). To request a loan, use the Loan Request Form.\n\nThere is no requirement to work. However, all students, international or American, who demonstrate financial need will have a student term-time work expectation as part of their financial aid package, which they can typically meet with a job requiring about 10-12 hours per week. U.S. immigration regulations allow foreign nationals to work on-campus only, and they restrict the amount of time a foreign student can spend working while attending college (10-12 hours per week is well under their limit). Jobs are plentiful and are often interesting and relevant to academic interests.\n\nMany of our families find parent loans to be a useful tool for spreading the cost of education over a number of years. Parents may borrow up to the full cost of education, less any other financial aid. Parent loans are not based on financial need, and there are no income restrictions or penalties for early repayment. Harvard processes PLUS loans directly with the U.S. Department of Education through the Federal Direct Lending Program, without the need for banks and for-profit lenders. However, your financing options are not limited to the parent PLUS loan; you and your family may borrow from any lender you choose.\n\nIn assessing your financial need, we first look at your family’s particular income and assets in order to come up with a student and parent contribution based on your individual financial need. Any funds that you receive from an organization outside your family that are intended for your educational expenses would be considered outside awards. Since outside awards are additional resources that reduce your financial need, they cannot be used to replace your parent contribution (which was calculated based on your parents’ income and assets).\n\nHere are some examples of outside awards:\n\nFunds from your secondary school\n\nFunds from city, state, or national organizations\n\nFunds from nonprofit organizations and businesses\n\nFunds from your parents’ employers\n\nFunds from government scholarships like ROTC\n\nIf the funds are meant to pay for your educational expenses, they are outside awards and will be incorporated into your financial aid package according to our outside award policy. You Harvard scholarship funding is not an outside award. Student wages, thesis grants, summer research grants, and other similar grants are not outside awards, since they are not directly meant to pay your standard cost of attendance. If you are receiving funding from an outside organization and are unclear of how to report it, please contact us and we’ll let you know.\n\nA large percentage of each entering first-year class receives one or more outside awards from national or local organizations. When adjusting the Harvard financial aid package, 100% of the total outside award amount is first deducted from your work expectation. If the total of outside awards exceeds your work expectation, that excess amount is deducted from the Harvard Scholarship. Since outside awards are additional resources that help to meet need, they may not be used to replace your parents' contribution or other expected family resource. For example, if you were originally offered a financial aid package with a $3,500 job, and a $15,000 Harvard Scholarship and subsequently receive a $2,000 National Merit award and $1,000 from the Elks Club, then we will reduce your term-time job expectation to $500. Only if outside awards exceeded $3,500 would they have any impact upon the amount of Harvard Scholarship.\n\nThe FAFSA determines your eligibility for federal and state financial aid, including the Pell Grant, Federal Work-Study funds, and subsidized federal student loans. While the new methodology may change your eligibility for federal financial aid, it does not determine your eligibility for aid from Harvard. At Harvard, we will continue to use our own methodology to determine your eligibility for our need-based financial aid (read more about this in our How Aid Works section). We first determine a family contribution, based on your family’s financial circumstances, and then meet your full financial need using Harvard’s funds as well as any federal or state funds for which you are eligible.\n\nIf you are admitted to Harvard during Early Action and have met your financial aid deadlines, you will receive an estimated financial aid decision around the time you receive your admissions decision. This will include a parent and student contribution, an estimated cost of attendance (which will be updated in the Spring when tuition and fees have been set for 24-25), and your total eligibility for grant aid. When we have received and processed your FAFSA, we will update this grant eligibility to break out funding from Harvard, federal, and state sources. Since we use our own methodology to determine your parent and student contribution, this will in most cases not change these parts of your financial aid package. If the information on your FAFSA conflicts with information submitted on the rest of your application materials (for example, if you report an investment account that you forgot to include on the CSS Profile), we will reach out to resolve these differences and may update your financial aid decision if the updated information changes your eligibility for financial aid.\n\nSince the FAFSA determines your eligibility for Federal Work-Study funding and subsidized federal student loans, we will also update you on your eligibility for these programs after your FAFSA has been submitted and reviewed.\n\nWe expect to send out finalized financial aid decisions around April 1 to students who meet the listed financial aid deadlines. Late applications will be reviewed as soon as possible after this point.\n\nIf you are unable to ask a parent to send in their financial information, please fill out a Parent Information Sheet including a letter from a third party and any additional documentation as appropriate. Given that every family situation is unique, we review parent and household information on a case-by-case basis to determine what documentation and paperwork is appropriate for that student to provide to us in an effort to be as generous as possible with our financial aid assessment. Since we do not review financial information until a positive admissions decision has been made, we cannot make a judgment call on the documentation required until that point in the process. Please rest assured that our financial aid application deadlines are flexible and that we will be in direct touch with the student, should a positive admissions decision be made and the financial aid application is incomplete.\n\nSign in here. Please allow five or more business days for processing. Remember that the staff at IDOC are only trained to identify basic US tax documents and these are the only ones that will show up on IDOC's tracking. If you have read through our application instructions and submitted what we ask for, then you should not worry about whether IDOC has been able to correctly identify and track your documents. Our staff will review the IDOC materials for all admitted students and current undergraduates to make sure your submissions fulfill our requirements and will reach out if there is anything more we need.\n\nHarvard does not charge a financial aid application fee. However, the financial aid application does include submission of the CSS Profile, an application independent of Harvard but that will normally require the payment of a fee.\n\nFor CSS Profile fee waiver requests: If you are a US Citizen or Permanent Resident you will automatically be evaluated for a waiver of the CSS Profile application fee at the point that you submit your CSS Profile data to the College Board. The College Board is wholly responsible for these fee waivers and will grant a waiver using their guidelines. You can learn more on their website here: https://cssprofile.collegeboard.org/fee-waivers.\n\nInternational students for whom the cost of the CSS Profile is prohibitive or who live in countries from which the College Board cannot process payments can follow these instructions to apply through our alternate application process.\n\nAdmission application fee waiver requests are explained here: (https://college.harvard.edu/resources/faq/paying-admissions-application-fee-hardship-my-family-can-i-get-waiver)\n\nPlease complete your CSS Profile online. The Harvard College CSS code number is 3434. Once your CSS Profile has been completed, you will be able to use the College Board’s Institutional Documentation Service (IDOC) to submit your tax forms and any other supplemental forms that may be required. Remember, it is important to provide your Social Security Number, if you have one, when you register for CSS Profile; Harvard will use this unique number to identify your data before loading any electronic records. NOTE: If you are a returning student and do not have a Social Security Number, please provide your Harvard ID number in the SSN field when you register for the CSS Profile. If you are a prospective/entering student and do not have a Social Security Number, please be sure to provide the same first, last and middle name, as well as birth date on the CSS Profile that you provided on your Harvard admissions application.\n\nYour parents and/or non-custodial parents should upload signed copies of their most recent federal tax return(s) with attending schedules to IDOC. Note that we will not be able to finalize your financial aid award until we receive your actual federal tax returns with all schedules - these should also be sent to IDOC as soon as they become available.) If you are an international student and a national tax return is not filed, your parents should ask each employer to submit a wage statement detailing their annual compensation.\n\nWe are not able to track financial aid application materials for prospective students until they have been admitted. If a student is admitted and indicated they wished to apply for aid, we will let them know at that point what has been received or is missing.\n\nFor current students, you can see what is missing and/or received by logging into my.harvard. We will not begin tracking documents for the next academic year until mid-February before that year starts, at which time we will post which documents are received/missing on your my.harvard.edu portal. Until that point, the documents showing on your my.harvard portal will be those from this current school year.\n\nIDOC is the best method for sending us documents, and is required for all US tax returns. IDOC is available to all students who submit a CSS Profile, whether residing in the US or abroad. Those students were unable to file a CSS Profile and who requested alternate instructions may send their foreign tax returns directly to us by mail or fax as directed by our alternate instructions. Please be sure that anything you send directly to us includes your full applicant name, applicant year, and some other unique identifier (school, birth date, etc.)\n\nFor prospective students, we will be happy to accept your completed application for financial aid whenever it arrives. We do ask, however, that you send your 2022 tax returns to IDOC as soon as possible after they become available. You should not submit 2021 documents unless you are specifically asked for them. If you receive a positive admissions decision and still have not been able to send your 2022 tax returns, please be in touch with us after you receive your admissions decision.\n\nFor current students, please send a copy of the IRS extension application to IDOC with the rest of your application materials. Please note that we will be unable to calculate your financial aid award until we receive the actual 2022 tax return.\n\nTravel: An allowance toward the cost of traveling to and from Harvard has been included in your budget on your award letter and used in calculating your eligibility for financial aid. You are responsible for booking and paying for your own travel. Many students will use the money they earn over the summer to meet the costs of travel to and from Harvard. Personal Expenses: The estimated cost for books, supplies, clothing, laundry, telephone, entertainment, local transportation, and other incidentals has been included in the personal expenses portion of your budget. Students generally spend between $600-$800 on books over the course of both semesters. You are responsible for paying your own personal expenses. Many of the students will use money earned at their term-time jobs to cover personal expenses.\n\nPlease notify our office if you are returning from a leave of absence. The same instructions and deadlines apply, regardless of whether you intend to return in the fall or spring semester. Make sure that you are current with loan repayments and that you file the necessary deferment or forbearance forms when you register. You may want to check the status of your student loans by calling the Student Loan Office at (617) 495-3782. In addition, your term bill from previous semesters must be paid in full.\n\nProspective students: Our deadlines are in place in order to ensure that we can send an aid award with our admissions decisions. We do not stop accepting applications, and a late application has no effect on your eligibility or the amount of your award. If we receive application materials late, you may simply receive your aid letter at a later date than your admission letter.\n\nCurrent students: Our deadlines are in place in order to ensure we have time to process your financial aid application in time for aid to be reflected on your term bill. If we receive application materials late, you may have to wait longer to receive your financial aid decision and may need to make plans to cover your first term bill payment. While a late application has no effect on the amount of your award, we typically expect all applications to be submitted no later than August 1.\n\nIf you are a prospective student and completed your application by the deadline, then you will receive an award decision in your acceptance mailing. If you missed the application deadline, an award decision will be completed as soon as possible and in the order it is received. If you are a current student, award decisions will be posted to your my.harvard account around July 1st. If you missed the application deadline, an award decision will be completed during the remainder of the summer and in the order it is received.\n\nSince we use the same expected family contribution whether you are studying at Harvard or abroad, the cost to your family should be the same in both cases. However, if a budget is more than $5,000 above your Harvard standard budget, the costs in excess of that $5,000 threshold will not be eligible for additional scholarship funding. A subsidized loan will usually be available to meet these additional expenses.\n\nIf while abroad you find that your necessary living expenses are substantially higher than anticipated, please contact your financial aid officer. You may be eligible for additional scholarship or a subsidized loan to help meet these expenses. It is to your benefit to contact your financial aid officer before using credit cards to meet unanticipated expenses.\n\nIf you are worried that you do not have resources to fall back upon in the case of urgent expenses while abroad, or to allow you to take advantage of discretionary travel or cultural opportunities that may come up, we may be able to offer you an “unexpected expenses loan” in advance of your departure. This is a subsidized loan that you can take out for your time abroad. If you don’t end up using the loan funds while abroad, you can simply return them when you return. Interest on these funds does not begin to accrue until 6 months after graduation/withdrawal, so they may be a much better option than credit cards to help you manage expenses.\n\nThe personal expenses allowance of your budget is meant to help toward your daily living expenses (separate from your housing and food charges) while enrolled in your study abroad program. As expenses can vary greatly based on each student’s discretion, we are not able to meet every student’s individual expenses. Rather, we build an allowance toward them in your budget, but leave the daily choices to you. For instance, in regard to local travel expenses, we might be able to offer you financial aid toward commuting from your apartment to your school campus, but we wouldn’t be able to offer you scholarship toward a traveling tour that is separate from your program. However, we recognize that you may want to take advantage of your time away from Cambridge, and we encourage you to make your time abroad enriching and educational in the broadest sense. We may be able to offer you subsidized loan to help you expand the scope of your experience abroad, and allow you a wider range of choices.\n\nPlease be aware that it is your responsibility to make sure that you have the appropriate health insurance coverage, whether you are studying on campus or abroad. All students are required to have health insurance, and the Harvard Blue Cross/ Blue Shield health insurance is automatically charged to each student’s termbill at the beginning of each semester. If you are covered under your family’s health insurance policy, you may be eligible to waive the Harvard health insurance. It is your responsibility to pursue the health insurance waiver, and University Health Services can help you with that decision.\n\nThe Health Fee and the Student Services Fee are the two mandatory Harvard fees, and are automatically charged to each student’s termbill at the beginning of each semester. You continue to be responsible for the Student Services Fee while abroad, and we include it in your budget. However, students who are studying abroad are usually eligible to waive the Health Fee. It is your responsibility to pursue the Health Fee waiver, and you should contact University Health Services about the Health Fee waiver.\n\nComplete the Study Abroad Supplement and return it, along with all supporting documents substantiating your budget, to the FAO. If you are planning to study abroad in the fall semester or for the full academic year, the form is due May 1st. If you are planning to study in the spring semester, the form is due October 30th. Be sure to attach documentation of your program budget to the Supplement. Please submit the Supplement by these deadlines, even if you do not know all the answers to the questions, as you can always update it later.\n\nWe encourage you to email your financial aid officer. While we do our best to construct an appropriate budget for you in advance based on the information provided by your program, we recognize that you may encounter higher costs during your time abroad. It is definitely to your benefit to contact your financial aid officer before relying on credit cards to help meet the difference in your expenses. We may be able to offer you additional scholarship or a subsidized loan to help with these unanticipated costs.\n\nWe are committed to making the application process accessible for all students. If the admissions application fee presents a hardship for you or your family, the fee will be waived. You can request a fee waiver directly through the Common Application or the Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir, if you meet their respective indicators of economic need. If you do not meet these indicators, please follow these instructions to learn how to get your fee waived. Requesting a fee waiver will not disadvantage your application in any way.\n\nWhen possible, we try to arrange for you to meet with alumni/ae in or near your school communities. You will not be at a disadvantage if an interview cannot be arranged. In the U.S., Canada and the U.K., an alumnus/a will contact an applicant directly by phone, e-mail, or letter if such an interview is possible. If you live outside these areas, we aim to hold an admission interview when and where possible. Our interviewers abroad are graduates of Harvard who offer their assistance on a volunteer basis. While we try to make interviewers as widely available as possible, it will not always be possible for a student to have an interview. The absence of an interview will not adversely affect your candidacy. See more about international interviews.\n\nThe SAT or ACT is required of all transfer applicants. In exceptional cases, when those are not accessible for a student, one of the following can meet the requirement:\n\nAP exam results\n\nIB Actual or Predicted Scores\n\nGCSE/A-Level Actual or Predicted Results\n\nNational Leaving Exams Results or Predictions\n\nIf you have applied to Harvard in the past, we will have access to your previous application in our review process including any scores that you submitted with earlier applications. Test scores can be particularly helpful for non-traditional students. We encourage non-traditional students to submit an exam taken within three years of applying for transfer to reflect current academic ability.\n\nSelf-reported scores are acceptable during the application process; official scores are required of enrolling students.\n\nHigh school transcripts are a required component of the transfer application. If you are unable to obtain your high school transcript, please submit a letter from your high school explaining why the transcript is not available.\n\nTo streamline your application review, we request that students who have taken the SAT or ACT report their scores with each new application, even if you have applied to us previously. Self-reported scores are acceptable during the application process; official scores are required of enrolling students. Please bear in mind that we will consider prior scores, and any other information that we have previously received on your behalf, in our whole-person review process. If you have applied to Harvard in the past with test scores and choose not to report them on your current application, we will have access to your previous application in our review process including any scores that you submitted with earlier applications.\n\nYes. Admitted transfer students who indicate in their application that they wish to live on campus are eligible for housing in the undergraduate Houses. Students are not required to live on campus, though nearly all undergraduate students do. The undergraduate Houses do not have appropriate accommodations for students who will be living with a spouse, partner, or other family members; students in these situations should plan to live off campus and will be given information about housing resources if admitted.\n\nTo be eligible to transfer to Harvard College, you must have satisfactorily completed at least one continuous academic year in a full-time degree program at one college by your anticipated date of matriculation at Harvard, and not have completed more than two years total in college. Please note that once a student has completed more than two years of college coursework at another institution, regardless of the courses taken, that student is no longer eligible for transfer admission or freshman admission. Our office cannot make exceptions to this policy as it is set by the Harvard faculty.\n\nIf you do not meet the above requirements and have not yet completed one continuous academic year in a full-time degree program at one college, then you may apply for freshman admission to Harvard College. Please note that if you are eligible to apply as a freshman that any college coursework you have completed would not transfer to Harvard College.\n\nWe consider an applicant’s full range of experiences and growth from those experiences, especially for veterans. A weak high school transcript does not necessarily mean you will not be a compelling candidate for Harvard. Look at your high school transcript with a critical eye, identify what your weaknesses in the classroom might have been and think about what you have done since that time to address those weaknesses. Be prepared to explain any steps you have taken to improve.\n\nTo be eligible to transfer to Harvard College, you must have satisfactorily completed at least one continuous academic year in a full-time degree program at one college by your anticipated date of matriculation at Harvard, and not have completed more than two years total in college. Once a student has completed more than two years of college coursework at another institution, regardless of the courses taken, that student is no longer eligible for transfer admission to Harvard. Our office cannot make exceptions to this policy as it is set by the Harvard faculty. We recognize that military service may impact a student’s access to classes. Please contact us at adm-tran@fas.harvard.edu if you have specific questions about your situation.\n\nWe fully understand that high school teachers may not remember you or still be at your school. We normally suggest that you get a similar set of letters from people who know you well in your current phase of life, such as commanding officers or other professors/instructors (if you have pursued any coursework since high school). Helpful letters might address how you dealt with adversity, stress, or other challenges, how you got along with your peers and how you have maximized opportunities available to you – all critical components to success at Harvard and beyond.\n\nA student may be deemed \"independent\" for federal purposes for a variety of reasons, including having veteran status. Harvard College maintains its own financial aid program and policies, and it is our institutional philosophy that every student’s parents have a responsibility to contribute to their child’s educational expenses. We therefore begin by asking all aid applicants to provide information for both parents.\n\nHowever, we are committed to working with any student on an individual basis to learn more about complex, unusual, or challenging circumstances that are not easily described in the standard aid application. If any aid applicant cannot ask one or both of their parents to participate in the financial aid process, the applicant should complete the Parent Information Sheet and submit it as part of their financial aid application.\n\nThere are many avenues to provide more information on your specific financial circumstances. When completing the CSS Profile, there is a dedicated section that allows any applicant to expand upon their specific situation. Applicants may also upload a brief “special circumstances” letter through IDOC when they are submitting their tax documents. In addition, all applicants are encouraged to contact the Griffin Financial Aid Office and work with one of our Financial Aid Officers, both during the application process and throughout their time at Harvard, to discuss their circumstances.\n\nThe Griffin Financial Aid Office works in conjunction with Harvard University Student Financial Services (SFS) to complete the certification process for any student who elects to use VA benefits. An outline of the process can be found here, and there is also a helpful “VA and Military FAQs” page on the SFS website here. Once a student has obtained their Certificate of Eligibility, we would ask them to contact our office at faoinfo@fas.harvard.edu for information on next steps.\n\nIn general, we encourage students to contact our office directly if they have specific questions about how their VA benefits might interact with financial aid.\n\nNo, while Harvard College is predominantly residential, some students do not live in College housing. Undergraduates living off campus may elect to be members of Dudley Community. This option has appealed to a number of students, including married students and students who wish to be part of a fully non-residential community. Students who are part of Dudley Community are eligible for meal contracts in Dudley Community and are included in all social and cultural activities sponsored by the Community. They are \"deaned\" by the Allston Burr Resident Dean of Dudley Community and are advised for purposes of fellowship and professional school application by Dudley Community tutors.\n\nIf you are currently enrolled full-time at an accredited college or university you may apply to spend one or two semesters studying at Harvard College. This program is not for high school graduates who wish to study at Harvard for a gap year. Additionally, since the VUS Program is for full-time undergraduate students only, if you have already achieved the equivalent of a bachelor's degree, you would not be eligible. However, you might be eligible to be a \"Special Student\" at the Graduate School of Arts & Sciences. For more information on this program, please visit their website.\n\nStudents whose native language is not English are REQUIRED to submit a TOEFL score not more than two years old. The results of this test are very useful to the Committee as it considers international applicants. Official tests results must be submitted electronically to the Admissions Office from the ETS (code#3434). We do not require SAT, ACT or AP scores to be submitted in order to apply to the Visiting Undergraduate Student Program. However, we encourage students who have taken them to submit their scores, because all information about a candidate is helpful in the admissions process.\n\nOnly applicants to the Visiting Undergraduate Students program are required to submit the TOEFL. It is not a requirement for first-year and transfer applicants.\n\nWithout all of the information about a VUS candidate, we cannot make exceptions to this requirement and time constraints do not allow us to pre-screen all applicants to determine if they are exempt from taking the TOEFL. Therefore, we advise all VUS applicants whose native language is not English to take the TOEFL and submit the results."
