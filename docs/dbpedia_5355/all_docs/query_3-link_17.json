As a two-term President, he is typically dismissed as weak and ineffective; historians have often ranked Grant's presidency near the bottom in American history. Recently, however, scholars have begun to reexamine and reassess his presidential tenure; recent rankings have reflected a significant rise.\n\nU.S. Grant and the crisis of Reconstruction\n\nWatch Joan Waugh, professor in the UCLA history department, talk about the crisis of Reconstruction"
