        "text": "Located off a desolate stretch of Interstate 50, Desperation, Nevada has few connections with the rest of the world. It is a place, though, where the seams between worlds are thin.\n\nMiners at the China Pit have accidentally broken into another dimension and released a horrific creature known as Tak, who takes human form by hijacking some of the town’s residents.\n\nThe forces of good orchestrate a confrontation between this ancient evil and a group of unsuspecting travelers who are lured to the dying town. This rag-tag band of unwilling champions is led by a young boy who speaks to God.\n\nLimited edition of 2,000 signed and numbered copies with no dustjacket in slipcase. Signed by Stephen King and Don Maitz.\n\nGift edition of 4,000 copies in dustjacket. Unsigned.\n\n524 pages. ©1996"
