They also cannot coerce you (force you) to not serve. If your employer makes any threats like this, you may file a lawsuit or file a complaint with the Bureau of Labor and Industries.​\n\nThere is no Oregon law that requires an employer to pay salary or wages during an employee’s jury service. Your employer’s policies, or your employment contract, will determine they will pay you during your jury service.​"
