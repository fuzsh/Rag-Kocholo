This process allows us to consider more than just a student's academic profile. As part of our Comprehensive Review Process, we consider:\n\nAcademic Factors\n\nFactors such as class rank, strength of curriculum, performance in curriculum, grade point average in required core academic courses and optional materials (resumé, and personal statement) will be considered for students’ admission. During the review process, students may be asked to provide additional information, such as 7th semester transcripts.\n\nExtracurricular Factors\n\nOther factors may include leadership, service, work experience and extracurricular activities; personal characteristics, attributes, and talents; and the ability to benefit from and contribute to a diverse and challenging learning environment. We are interested in learning much more about your preparedness, motivation, and potential in the unique context of your experience.\n\nYour Personal Statement\n\nThe inclusion of an optional short answer, personal narrative or statement to the application gives you the opportunity to include unique life experiences and personal achievements in your application and the ability to explain weaker areas of your academic history or journey. This section is not an essay and there is no content expectation. Through this process, we create more comprehensive and individualized admission and scholarship decisions while providing context to areas of concern on a student’s transcript or academic record.\n\nIf you have not been admitted yet, you may contact your admissions recruiter assigned to you or contact our Undergraduate Admissions Office to request a term change.\n\nIf you have already been admitted, you may request a deferment*.\n\n*See Defer Your Enrollment for eligibility and more information.\n\nIf you are not eligible for a deferment, please cancel your admission and re-apply.\n\nIf you would like to cancel your admission to the University of Arizona and have not paid your enrollment fee, please complete and submit the Admissions Cancellation Form within your Future Wildcat account.\n\nIf you have already taken action with your enrollment fee, please visit the Next Steps Center and navigate to the bottom of the ‘secure your spot’ tab to cancel your admission to the University of Arizona.\n\nYou may also mail in your cancellation notice.
