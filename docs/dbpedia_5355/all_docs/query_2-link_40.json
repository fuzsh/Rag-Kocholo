        "text": "How do I apply for Child Support Services?\n\nYou can complete the application at your local CSS office or apply online.\n\nIs an application fee required?\n\nA non-refundable $25 application fee is required to apply for Non-Public Assistance services. You could be eligible for a reduced fee of $10. Ask about this when you apply. For more information contact your local CSS office.\n\nWhat services are provided by CSS?\n\nThe CSS program provides the following services: location of noncustodial parents, paternity establishment for children born outside of marriage, establishment of support obligations, collection and distribution of support and enforcement of support obligations.\n\nHow long does it take to obtain a child support court order and receive child support payments once the application is completed and received by the CSS program?\n\nThe length of time depends upon the unique circumstance of each case. Some cases are more complicated and require more time. Providing additional information when requested helps CSS in obtaining a child support order in a timely manner. Factors contributing to the complexity of the case can include:\n\nDifficulty in locating the noncustodial parent\n\nPaternity establishment\n\nMultiple potential fathers\n\nNoncustodial parent lives in another state\n\nWhat is a Non-IV-D case?\n\nNon-IV-D cases are managed by the county Clerk of Superior Court.\n\nWhat is the CSS Customer Service Center?\n\nThe CSS Customer Service Center serves as the gateway for all questions from our customers. The toll-free phone number is 1-800-992-9457. This puts you in contact with the Interactive Voice Response Unit, which is available seven days a week. Information is available in English or Spanish. Have your Master Participant Index (MPI) number available. A menu describes your options. Press the appropriate number to go directly to the information you want, or press “0” to speak to a customer service representative. You also can contact CSS Customer Service representatives by mail or by completing the feedback form.\n\nWhat is New Hire Reporting?\n\nEmployers doing business in North Carolina are required to report all newly hired employees to the NC New Hire Directory. Prompt reporting enables CSS to locate noncustodial parents faster and increase child support collections. Employers can report online at the New Hire web site.\n\nLocation of NCPs\n\nWhat is location of NCP?\n\nLocation is one of the core services provided by CSS. Noncustodial parents (NCPs) must be located in order to establish paternity and support and to enforce existing court orders for support. If CSS has a record of the NCP’s current address or place of employment it considers that NCP to be located.\n\nIs CSS always successful in locating the NCP?\n\nNo. However, as the CSS agency receives more information on an NCP its ability to locate that NCP increases.\n\nPaternity\n\nWhat does “establishing paternity” mean and why is it necessary?\n\nEstablishing paternity is one of the core services provided by CSS. It identifies the legal father of a child, which ensures certain rights for the child and access to the father’s medical information and benefits. A child support order cannot be established for a child born out of wedlock unless the alleged father acknowledges paternity or is proven to be the father through genetic testing.\n\nWhat is a genetic test?\n\nA. Genetic testing is a way of determining the probability that the alleged father is the child’s biological father. The natural mother, alleged father and the child are tested. The most common method uses tissue swabbed from the inside of the cheek. . The procedure can take place in the CSS office or a testing laboratory. Identification is required and individuals being tested are photographed to verify the donors. Results from the lab can take four to six weeks.\n\nWhat are some of the legal ways to establish paternity?\n\nPaternity can be established through:\n\nVoluntary acknowledgment process: Both the mother and father complete a form known as an Affidavit of Parentage. This document becomes a legal finding of paternity. If there are any doubts about who is the father of the child, neither party should sign an Affidavit of Parentage. Either parent can request genetic testing to assist in determining the father of the child. Paternity should be established through the courts once genetic testing determines the father.\n\nCivil or criminal paternity action: A court of law establishes the paternity of the child and in most cases a child support order is entered.\n\nIf the father is unable to sign the Affidavit of Parentage in the hospital can this document be completed later?\n\nYes. The Affidavit of Parentage can be signed at your local CSS office, or visit the NC Vital Records website.\n\nWill the father’s name be placed on the birth certificate?\n\nYes. When the natural mother and biological father sign an Affidavit of Parentage the affidavit is filed with NC Vital Records. The father’s signature on the affidavit gives permission for his name to be entered on the birth certificate for a child born in NC.\n\nWhat happens after paternity has been established?\n\nOnce paternity is established an order for financial and or medical support can be obtained either voluntarily or by court order.\n\nEstablishing Support\n\nWhat does “establishing support” mean?\n\nEstablishing support is one of the core services provided by CSS. To successfully establish a support order CSS must locate the noncustodial parent (NCP), identify how much the NCP can pay and determine the needs of the child(ren) in the case. CSS must obtain a legal order that specifies the amount of financial support to be paid for the benefit of the child(ren).\n\nWhat are some of the legal ways to establish a child support order?\n\nChild support orders can be established in the following ways:\n\nA Voluntary Support Agreement (VSA) that is signed by a judge;\n\nA civil court action brought by the custodial parent, an organization or the guardian of a dependent child;\n\nA Criminal Abandonment and Non-Support court action;\n\nA divorce order that includes child support.\n\nHow is the amount of child support determined?\n\nThe amount of child support to be paid is based upon the NC Child Support Guidelines. These guidelines are used to calculate child support orders based on the ability of parents to pay and the needs of the children. The amount of child support is calculated using the worksheets contained in the guidelines.\n\nNorth Carolina Child Support Centralized Collections (NCCSCC)\n\nWhat is the North Carolina Child Support Centralized Collections (NCCSCC) operation?\n\nThe NCCSCC operation automatically processes all NC child support payments at a central location in accordance with the requirements of federal and state law.\n\nDistribution and Disbursement\n\nWhat does “distribution” and “disbursement” mean?\n\n“Distribution” is the accounting process that determines how incoming payments are applied. The Automated Collection and Tracking System (ACTS) applies these funds based on pre-defined rules of distribution. For example funds can be distributed to multiple child support cases and to multiple subaccounts for each case in order to satisfy current and past due support obligations.\n\nWhat is proration?\n\nFederal and state laws require that payments from payors with more than one child support case be divided (or prorated) among all of their cases. When NCCSCC processes a payment, the money is divided among all of the payor's child support cases. The amount of the payment that is applied to each case is determined by the amount owed as current support and the amount of past due child support owed on each case.\n\nEnforcement\n\nWhat does enforcement mean?\n\nOnce a child support obligation is determined and a court order established, CSS is responsible for enforcing the order. Appropriate enforcement actions are mandatory when the noncustodial parent (NCP) is not complying with the court order.\n\nWhat can CSS do when an NCP does not pay his/her child support?\n\nSome remedies that CSS can use to enforce a child support order are:\n\nCourt action resulting in jail time.\n\nInterception of tax refunds (See Tax Intercept FAQs).\n\nConsumer credit reporting – An NCP’s obligation is reported to consumer credit bureaus that track credit records. Having a child support arrearage debt on a credit record could prevent an NCP from getting a loan or a new credit card.\n\nPassport denial or revocation – NCPs with cases that have arrearages of more than $2,500 are submitted to the U.S. Secretary of State. The U.S. Secretary of State refuses to issue a passport to these NCPs and could revoke, restrict or limit a passport that was previously issued.\n\nLiens – A lien is a hold placed on property to ensure that child support payments are made. If NCPs have arrearages equal to three months of their child support obligation or $3,000 (whichever is less), CSS can petition the court to place a lien on the NCP’s property. The NCP can either pay his or her arrearages to have the lien removed, or the property can be sold to satisfy part or all of the debt.\n\nDriver’s, professional/occupational, or wildlife license revocation – If an NCP is 90 days behind in child support payments, a judge can order revocation of his or her driver’s license. CSS also can refer that NCP’s name to the appropriate licensing board to revoke a professional or occupational license. These licenses cannot be reissued until either the entire debt is paid or a satisfactory payment plan is established. Examples of professional or occupational licenses include: doctor, lawyer, realtor, nurse, teacher, plumber, barber, etc.\n\nLevying financial institution (bank) accounts – If NCPs have arrearages equal to six months of their child support obligation or $1,000 (whichever is less), CSS can request that a levy be placed on the NCP’s financial institution accounts.\n\nWhat is income withholding?\n\nIncome (or wage) withholding is an efficient and reliable means of collecting periodic child support obligations. When North Carolina (or any other state) sends a notice of wage withholding for an employee to the employer, federal and state laws require that employer to begin withholding child support from the employee’s wages. Employers deduct the amount specified under the terms of the withholding notice from the employee’s paycheck and forward it to the state within seven business days. Income can also be withheld when the NCP has other sources of income, such as unemployment insurance benefits and workers’ compensation.\n\nWhat kinds of income can be withheld?\n\nNorth Carolina income withholding law permits the withholding of most kinds of income. Examples include:\n\nSalaries and wages\n\nUnemployment compensation\n\nWorkers’ compensation\n\nWork release\n\nSocial Security Administration (SSA) benefits\n\nVeterans benefits\n\nRetirement benefits\n\nWhat sources of income are exempt from income withholding?\n\nThe following sources of income are exempt:\n\nPublic assistance (Work First)\n\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI)\n\nFederal black lung benefits\n\nFederal death benefits\n\nPayments under the Federal Torts Claims Act\n\nFederal grants and fellowships\n\nVeterans Educational Assistance Payments\n\nRefunds from incorrect payment or overpayment of federal income tax\n\nTravel, transportation, uniform, relocation and other allowances for civilian employees on military posts\n\nReserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) subsistence allowance\n\nVeterans disability and death benefits\n\nIs it possible to collect child support from sources other than wages?\n\nYes. It is possible to collect past due child support from other types of assets such as tax refunds, insurance settlements, unemployment compensation, workers’ compensation benefits, property and bank accounts. Custodial parents should inform their caseworker of any assets that the noncustodial parent has.\n\nCan an NCP be arrested for failure to pay child support?\n\nNCPs cannot be arrested solely because child support payments are not paid. The NCP must be served with a Motion and Order to Show Cause, which allows the case to be heard before a judge. Both parents in the case can be given the opportunity to address the court about the case. After all the testimony and evidence are presented, the judge determines whether the NCP is in contempt of the order, and if so, what penalty to apply.\n\nCan an NCP be forced to get a job?\n\nChild support caseworkers can offer suggestions on where to seek employment, but they do not have the authority to require someone to go to work. A judge can require the noncustodial parent to seek employment and return to court at a later date.\n\nWhat can be done when the NCP’s payments are due on the first of the month, but they are always late?\n\nThe current month’s payment is not considered delinquent until 30 days have passed and the amount that is owed equals or exceeds one month’s obligation. Once the payments are past due 30 days enforcement actions can be taken.\n\nHow can CSS collect child support if the NCP is paid in cash?\n\nIncome withholding might not be effective if the NCP is paid in cash. Delinquency notices are mailed to the NCP. If payments are not made, enforcement remedies can be taken.\n\nTax Intercept\n\nWhat is tax intercept?\n\nCSS can intercept the federal and/or state tax refund of an obligor/noncustodial parent (NCP) who owes past due child support. For federal tax intercept, the NCP must owe at least $500 in past due child support for his or her non-public assistance cases or at least $150 for public assistance cases. For state tax intercept, the NCP must owe at least $50 for his or her non-public assistance cases. Intercepted tax refunds are used to pay child support debt that is owed to the state first and then to pay the custodial parent. Custodial parents cannot receive tax intercept payments unless the NCP has filed taxes and is eligible for a tax refund. NCPs might not be eligible for a tax refund if they owe past due taxes or did not pay enough taxes during their employment to qualify for a refund. Any funds that remain after the NCP’s child support debt is paid off are returned to the NCP.\n\nIf the noncustodial parent applies for a rapid refund, can his or her taxes be intercepted for child support?\n\nYes. A rapid refund is a loan that uses the tax refund as collateral. Funds are still intercepted from the noncustodial parent’s tax refund to pay child support, even if the lender is not aware that the NCP has been certified for tax intercept.\n\nWhy are intercepted federal tax refunds held for six months?\n\nWhen the obligor/NCP files a joint tax return, some of that tax refund could be owed to his or her spouse. CSS puts a hold on funds from an intercepted federal tax refund for six months to allow the spouse to file a claim for his or her share of the refund. If the NCP and spouse sign a notarized statement with both of their Social Security numbers that waives the spouse’s right to file a claim, CSS releases the held funds upon receipt of the affidavit.\n\nIntergovernmental Cases\n\nWhat is an intergovernmental case?\n\nIntergovernmental cases are those in which the involved parties reside in different states and a request for assistance is forwarded to the other state's child support agency.\n\nWho handles a child support case in another state?\n\nThe CSS office in the noncustodial parent’s (NCP) state of residence handles the establishment or enforcement of a child support order.\n\nGeneral\n\nCan the CSS office assist me with visitation and custody issues?\n\nNo. Federal regulations do not allow the CSS office to provide services for visitation or custody disputes. Child support and visitation rights are separate issues. For these issues, consult with a private attorney.\n\nWhat kind of documents can I provide to help the CSS agency process my case?\n\nIf possible provide the following documents:\n\nA copy of the divorce decree, separation agreement or court order for child support\n\nA copy of the Affidavit of Parentage, if one has been signed\n\nBirth certificate(s) of the child(ren) involved\n\nDocuments that reflect both parents’ incomes (paycheck stubs, tax returns, bank statement, etc.)\n\nEvidence of child support payment history\n\nOther documents might be needed, depending on your case.\n\nDo I have to provide CSS with information about the noncustodial parent to receive Work First Family Assistance?\n\nWork First applicants and recipients must cooperate with CSS by providing information about the NCP, unless the Work First agency determines that good cause exists for noncooperation, such as the potential for emotional or physical harm to the child or caretaker. If good cause is granted, the case is not referred to CSS. Contact your Work First caseworker for information on how to make a claim of good cause.\n\nWhat should I do if my address changes?\n\nMake sure that you keep CSS informed immediately of changes to your address. If a child support check is returned to CSS due to an incorrect address, it is not reissued until a new address becomes available. Call the CSS Customer Service Center at 1-800-992-9457 from 7:30 a.m. until 5:30 p.m. Monday through Friday or contact the county CSS office that handles your case.\n\nWhat should I do if my name changes?\n\nContact the county CSS office handling your case.\n\nLocation of Noncustodial Parents (NCPs)\n\nHow can I help with location efforts?\n\nProviding CSS with as much information as possible is the key. The individual’s complete name, Social Security number and date of birth are vital to successful location, but other information such as things you remember or documents you possess can be very useful.\n\nWhat kind of documents can I provide to help the CSS agency locate the NCP?\n\nEmployment, tax, financial institution and insurance records are good examples of documents that can help CSS to locate the NCP.\n\nWhat if I don’t know much about the NCP?\n\nYou could know more than you think. Where did you meet? Did the NCP speak of the type of work that he or she did? Do you have mutual friends who could have information? Think about the conversations that you had, and you may remember small things to help in locating the NCP.\n\nThe NCP for my case moved out of state four years ago. How can the CSS agency locate him orher?\n\nThe CSS agency can access information from both state and national computer databases to assist in location efforts. In addition, CSS agencies in other states can assist in location and pursuing support. (See Interstate Cases.)\n\nPaternity\n\nWhat if I am not sure who the father is?\n\nIf you apply for services or are referred to the CSS office to establish paternity, you are asked questions about the men who could have fathered the child. It is very important for you to provide as much information as you can to help determine the father’s identity. When more than one person could be the father of the child, each person could be required to take a genetic test.\n\nWhat are some legal ways to establish paternity?\n\nPaternity can be established the following ways:\n\nVoluntary acknowledgment process – Both the mother and father complete a form known as an Affidavit of Parentage; this document becomes a legal finding of paternity. If there are doubts about who is the father of the child, neither party should sign an Affidavit of Parentage. Either parent can request genetic testing to assist in determining the father of the child. Paternity can be established through the courts once genetic testing determines the father.\n\nCivil or criminal paternity action - A court of law establishes the paternity of the child and in most cases, a child support order is entered.\n\nIf the father is unable to sign the Affidavit of Parentage in the hospital, can this document be completed later?\n\nYes. The Affidavit of Parentage can be signed at your local CSS office, or visit the NC Vital Records website.\n\nWill the father’s name be placed on the birth certificate?\n\nYes. When the natural mother and biological father sign an Affidavit of Parentage, the affidavit is filed with NC Vital Records. The father’s signature on the affidavit gives permission for his name to be entered on the birth certificate for a child born in North Carolina.\n\nEstablishing Support\n\nWhat are some of the legal ways to establish a child support order?\n\nChild support orders can be established in the following ways:\n\nA Voluntary Support Agreement (VSA) that is signed by a judge\n\nA civil court action, brought by the custodial parent, an organization, or the guardian of a dependent child\n\nA Criminal Abandonment and Non-Support court action\n\nA divorce order that includes child support\n\nHow is the amount of child support determined?\n\nThe amount of child support to be paid is based upon the NC Child Support Guidelines. These guidelines are used to calculate child support orders based on the ability of parents to pay and the needs of the children. The amount of child support is calculated using the worksheets contained in the guidelines.\n\nDo the guidelines allow adjustments for second families?\n\nYes. The guidelines allow adjustments for each of your biological children from another relationship, as long as the children are living with you. See the NC Child Support Guidelines for more information.\n\nWhat about an adjustment for parents who pay health insurance?\n\nThe guidelines provide a credit for the cost of health insurance.\n\nCan I get health insurance for my child as part of the child support order?\n\nYes. North Carolina law mandates that all orders for child support must require either parent to provide health insurance to cover the child(ren), if coverage is available through an employer or other group coverage is available at the time the order is issued or at any time in the future.\n\nCan I receive child support if the noncustodial parent (NCP) is in prison?\n\nIf the NCP has other assets, such as property or wages from a work release program, then child support can be collected while the parent is in prison.\n\nWhat can I do to increase my child support order?\n\nCSS automatically reviews child support orders every three years, if the family is receiving public assistance. Other orders that are enforced through CSS can be reviewed every three years, if either parent requests a review. A review can be requested at any time if a substantial change in circumstances occurs. CSS determines the present income and assets of both parents and the needs of the child(ren). If appropriate, CSS then can seek to modify the order.\n\nBoth the noncustodial parent and I have moved from the county where our child support order was first obtained. Does a new court order for child support need to be established in the county where we live now?\n\nNo. It is possible to enforce an existing order, even when no one still lives in the area. Contact the local CSS office where you live to determine what is best for your case.\n\nDistribution and Disbursement (Custodial Parents)\n\nHow long after the noncustodial parent (NCP) makes a payment should I receive a payment?\n\nIf you have a Non-Public Assistance (NPA) case, your first child support payment will be in the form of a check, unless you have signed up for direct deposit. That check should be mailed on the next business day after the payment was receipted. You will receive subsequent payments through the ncKIDScard (debit card) program. Payments are automatically deposited in your ncKIDScard account within two business days after the noncustodial parent’s payment has been applied to your case. If you receive public assistance, the child support payment will be used to reimburse the state for the public assistance you have received.\n\nCan I pick up my check in person?\n\nNo. North Carolina Child Support Centralized Collections (NCCSCC) mails all checks.\n\nWhat should I do if I have not received a check?\n\nIf you do not receive your check within 10 business days of the date of disbursement, call the CSS Customer Service Center at 1-800-992-9457, or contact your local CSS office to sign an Affidavit and Indemnity Bond. This document must be signed in the presence of a notary public. If the check has not been cashed, a stop payment is placed on the original check and a new check is reissued. If the check has been cashed, further research must be done. It could take two to three weeks to determine the status of the original check before a new check can be reissued.\n\nWhat happens if the payor/NCP makes a payment without a payment coupon?\n\nIf the payment does not include the NCP's Master Participant Index (MPI) number and court docket number, your check could be delayed or the funds misapplied. To avoid a delay or misapplication of funds, the NCP should use the complete 16-digit number as it is listed on the coupon.\n\nWhat is the ncKIDScard?\n\nThe ncKIDScard (debit card) program replaces paper checks for custodial parents who meet the enrollment criteria and have not signed up for direct deposit. The ncKIDScard automatic enrollment process begins as soon as the custodial parent receives a child support payment by check.\n\nWhat should I do if I have questions about my ncKIDScard account balance?\n\nYou can call Bancorp Bank Customer Service (1-877-776-9759), access your account online, or verify your balance using an ATM machine. You will receive a monthly statement for your ncKIDScard account by mail.\n\nWhat is direct deposit?\n\nCustodial parents can choose to have their child support payments automatically deposited instead of receiving their payments through ncKIDScard. Direct deposit transfers funds electronically from the noncustodial parent’s payment into a checking or debit card account that the custodial parent designates. Savings accounts cannot be used for direct deposit.\n\nHow can I sign up for direct deposit?\n\nComplete an Authorization for Automatic Deposit of Child Support form and attach a voided blank check (or other form of verification, if using a debit card account.) To have this form mailed to you, contact the Customer Service Center at 1-800-992-9457 between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. Please allow three to four weeks for direct deposit to take effect.\n\nHow can I change or terminate direct deposits?\n\nComplete an Authorization for Automatic Deposit of Child Support form. To change financial institutions or the checking/debit account number at the same financial institution, submit a new authorization form and mark the “Bank Change” field. Include a voided check or other form of verification. To terminate direct deposit, submit the form and mark the “Cancellation” field. To have this form mailed to you, contact the Customer Service Center at 1-800-992-9457 between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.\n\nIf the NCP for my case makes a payment but owes child support for children in other cases, who receives the money?\n\nPayments are applied to all of the NCP’s cases. The amount of the payment that is applied to each case is determined by the amount owed as current support and the amount of past due child support owed on each case.\n\nHow can I obtain a payment history?\n\nYou can obtain a payment history through the eChild Support website. Log on and select “Parents’ and then “Case/Financial Info.” Payment histories that show the last 12 payments are available online. To obtain a payment history for any time period before the last 12 payments were made, contact the county CSS office handling your case. You can also call the CSS Customer Service Center at 1-800-992-9457 between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.\n\nIf I receive public assistance (such as Work First Family Assistance), will I also receive child support payments?\n\nNo. In order to receive Work First Family Assistance (WFFA) payments, you are required to assign your rights to child support over to the CSS agency. The child support that is collected is used to repay the state for the WFFA payments that you receive.\n\nWhat happens if I stop receiving WFFA?\n\nIf you stop receiving WFFA, the child support that is collected is paid to you. If any extra money is collected, it is applied to any past due support balance that is owed to you. Once your past due support is repaid, any remaining money is applied to repay the state for the WFFA benefits that you have received.\n\nIf I receive a notice that I have been overpaid, will I receive my regular child support?\n\nCSS will notify you of the overpayment and give you 30 days to repay it. If you have not repaid the overpayment after thirty days, your regular child support payments are reduced by 10 percent until the state recoups the overpayment.\n\nIntergovernmental\n\nI just moved to North Carolina but the father of my child lives in another state. Can I still get child support services?\n\nYes, interstate case processing provides for the same child support services as in any local case. Be aware that your local CSS agency might have to request the assistance of the other state’s CSS agency when performing whatever case action is needed. Case activities usually take longer when working with another state. While CSS agencies in different states cooperate with each other when handling requests for assistance, enforcing the court order of another state is not a simple matter. For additional information, contact your local CSS office. To apply for CSS services apply online, download an application or you can obtain and complete the application at your local CSS office.\n\nWhat can I do if I was never married to the father of my child and he is living in another state?\n\nApply for services at your local CSS office. Genetic testing might be ordered to help prove paternity. Once paternity is established, the other state’s guidelines are used to determine the amount of child support that is to be paid.\n\nIf I have a case in North Carolina, do I need to establish a new child support order each time the noncustodial parent moves to another state?\n\nNo. Under Federal Interstate Laws, only one order can exist.\n\nWhat happens when a noncustodial parent (NCP) who is living in another state does not pay his child support obligation?\n\nOnce the NCP is located, the local CSS agency can request that the other state enforce the court order. If the NCP’s employer is known, local CSS can send a direct income withholding notice to the employer in the state where the NCP lives.\n\nHow can I receive child support when the court order is in another state and the NCP moves frequently?\n\nIt is difficult to enforce a child support order when the NCP moves on a regular basis. Keep your caseworker informed of any new information that is obtained. Your caseworker can access many resources, but their best source of information is you, the custodial parent. Contact your local CSS office for more information.\n\nI live in North Carolina, the NCP lives in Nebraska and our child support order was established in Florida. Can this order be modified in North Carolina?\n\nNorth Carolina CSS can register the Florida support order in Nebraska, where the order can be modified and enforced.\n\nCan North Carolina enforce a child support order that was entered in another state?\n\nYes, procedures for this activity are in place. Providing a certified copy of the court order and a payment history can expedite the processing of the case. If you do not have a copy of the order, it is important to provide the county and state in which the court order was obtained, the approximate date of the order and the court file number, if known.\n\nGeneral\n\nCan the CSS office assist me with visitation and custody issues?\n\nNo. Federal regulations do not allow the CSS office to provide services for visitation or custody disputes. Child support and visitation rights are separate issues. For these issues, consult with a private attorney.\n\nPaternity\n\nWhat are some legal ways to establish paternity?\n\nPaternity can be established in the following ways:\n\nVoluntary acknowledgment process – Both the mother and father complete a form known as an Affidavit of Parentage; this document becomes a legal finding of paternity. If there are any doubts about who is the father of the child, neither party should sign an Affidavit of Parentage. Either parent can request genetic testing to assist in determining the father of the child.\n\nCivil or criminal paternity action – A court of law establishes the paternity of the child and in most cases, a child support order is entered. The court can establish paternity when genetic testing determines the father or by default if the alleged father fails to answer a summons to appear in court.\n\nIf I am unable to sign the Affidavit of Parentage in the hospital, can I complete this document later?\n\nYes. The Affidavit of Parentage can be signed at your local CSS office or visit the NC Vital Records website.\n\nWill my name be placed on the birth certificate?\n\nYes. When the natural mother and biological father sign an Affidavit of Parentage, the affidavit is filed with NC Vital Records. The father’s signature on the affidavit gives permission for his name to be entered on the birth certificate for a child born in North Carolina.\n\nWhat if I am not sure I am the father?\n\nIf there are any doubts about who is the father of the child, neither party should sign an Affidavit of Parentage. Either parent can request genetic testing to assist in determining the father of the child.\n\nEstablishing Support\n\nHow is the amount of child support that I owe determined?\n\nThe amount of child support to be paid is calculated using the worksheets contained in the NC Child Support Guidelines. These guidelines are used to calculate child support orders based on the ability of parents to pay and the needs of the children.\n\nAre there any adjustments for second families allowed in the North Carolina Child Support Guidelines?\n\nYes. The guidelines allow adjustments for each of your biological children from another relationship, as long as the children are living with you. See the NC Child Support Guidelines for more information.\n\nDo I receive credit if I pay for health insurance for my child(ren)?\n\nThe guidelines provide a credit for the cost of health insurance.\n\nDo I have to provide health insurance for my child(ren) as part of the child support order?\n\nYes. North Carolina law mandates that all orders for child support must require either parent to provide health insurance available through an employer at the time the order is issued or at any time in the future to cover the child (ren).\n\nDo I have to pay child support if I am in prison?\n\nIf a noncustodial parent (NCP) has other assets, such as property or wages from a work release program, then child support can be collected while the parent is in prison.\n\nCan the amount I owe for child support order change?\n\nCSS automatically reviews child support orders every three years if the family is receiving public assistance. Other orders being enforced through CSS office can be reviewed every three years, if either parent requests a review. A review can be requested at any time if a substantial change in circumstances occurs. CSS determines the present income and assets of both parents and the needs of the child(ren). If appropriate, CSS then can seek to modify the order.\n\nNC Child Support Centralized Collections\n\nWhere should I send my payments?\n\nMail your payments to:\n\nNC Child Support Centralized Collections\n\nPO Box 900006\n\nRaleigh, NC 27675-9006\n\nCan I come in person to NCCSCC to make a payment?\n\nNo, you must mail your payment to the address above.\n\nWhat ways can I use to make my payments?\n\nChild support can be paid in the following ways: Checks (including personal checks) and money orders can be sent through regular mail.

The payor/NCP must make a purge payment to the entity specified by the court (often the Clerk of Court), but purge payments are not mailed directly to NCCSCC. Only money orders, certified checks or cash are accepted as purge payments.\n\nWho do I call if I have questions about payment or account information?\n\nFor payment and account information, contact the Customer Service Center at 1-800-992-9457.\n\nDistribution and Disbursement\n\nAfter I make a child support payment, how soon will the custodial parent in my case receive the payment?\n\nIf the custodial parent in a non-public assistance (NPA) case has an ncKIDScard account, the payment is deposited automatically in that ncKIDScard account within two business days after the payment has been applied to the custodial parent’s case. If the custodial parent is enrolled in direct deposit, the payment transmittals are generally processed within two to three business days after the payment has been applied to the custodial parent’s case. If the custodial parent is receiving public assistance, the payment generally is sent to reimburse the State for the Public Assistance that was paid.\n\nHow are my payments applied if I have more than one case?\n\nFederal and state laws require that payments from a payor/noncustodial parent (NCP) with more than one child support case be divided among all of their cases. The amount of the payment that is applied to each case is determined by the amount owed as current support and the amount of past due child support owed on each case. This is known as proration.\n\nCan I make a payment to one case without the money being applied to my other child support cases?\n\nAll payments you make through NCCSCC are applied to all of your child support cases.
