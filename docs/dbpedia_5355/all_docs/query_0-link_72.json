Hard not to think of them as definitive, in my opinion. But I also love vintage editions. What made you pick Grant?\n\nPost by Falconer on\n\nUnfortunately Del Rey only did the first one in hardcover with color plates, the rest are paperback only, with black and white art only (including the color pieces rendered in B&W).\n\nPost by scalydemon on\n\nBut I also love vintage editions. What made you pick Grant?\n\nEverything I own or have owned published by him is great in quality and as a collectible. He is sort of a legend and has great taste.\n\nPost by geoffrey on\n\n\"Donald M.

Grant was recently found to contain unnecessary editorial alterations to the text. Most of the changes were done to make the text more 'politically correct.' Racial slurs, names, and other 'potentially offensive' remarks and phrases were edited, as well as some tampering with adjectives, deletions or words, and some punctuation changes. This discovery, coupled with the discovery that the D.M. Grant collection of Howard's Solomon Kane stories, Red Shadows, was also edited, calls into question the textual purity and integrity of the entire D.M.

Not sure what the kid is discovering as these came out in the 70's. Dropping a racial slur and fixing a typo doesn't bother me anyways.\n\nThe Frost-Giant's Daughter is one of my favorite stories and it is cool to own the Donald M Grant printing of it.\n\n\"The last version, as left by Howard before his death, was first published in 1976 by Donald M. Grant in an edition of the Conan story Rogues in the House.\"\n\nI'll eventually collect the rest of these as money permits.\n\nI want a copy of this book also en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull-Face_and_Others\n\nPost by geoffrey on\n\n\"Sadly, the Conan hardback collector's edition The Pool of the Black One published by D.M.

I could get to Schaumburg in a bit over an hour, I think.\n\nPost by Finarvyn on\n\nThe also have the SPI John Carter game behind the counter, for $75.\n\nI have that one already. Tempted to buy a second as a backup, but I don't really ever play it so that would probably be a waste of my money.\n\nPost by stevemitchell on\n\n\"All that I have are the black, paperback Del Rey publications of Conan (in three volumes) and of Kull (a single volume).\"\n\nThose are the best editions to have, in terms of faithfulness to Howard's original texts, and the various articles and comments that accompany them. But you should add the Solomon Kane and Bran Man Morn volumes!\n\nPost by Finarvyn on\n\nI think I have a complete set of the DEL RAY trade paperbacks. I kind of wish they were in hardback and with slightly larger font size, but I like them anyway.\n\nI also have a SFBC omnibus with a lot of Conan stories, I think raw and unedited. If I recall correctly, the SFBC volume and the one Del Ray hardback cover the whole sequence and the SFBC one has slightly larger font size.\n\nPost by thegreyelf on\n\nUnfortunately Del Rey only did the first one in hardcover with color plates, the rest are paperback only, with black and white art only (including the color pieces rendered in B&W).\n\nUntrue. I own all three volumes of the Del Rey series in hardcover. As well as Solomon Kane and Kull in hardcover. You're correct that they don't have color plates, though. The art is all B&W.\n\nPost by thegreyelf on\n\nAlso, If you're looking for other great, definitive collections of Howard's works, it's hard to beat the REHFP. Their stuff is expensive, small print run, high quality, and sells out fast, but they usually get around to multiple print runs in time if you stick with it.\n\nThey focus more on his lesser-known works. They haven't done Conan, Solomon Kane, Bran Mak Morn, or the like. I have the Steve Harrison's Casebook, Western Tales, and all three volumes of the Collected Letters from them.

I suspect the font sizes are the same, but if they are different I may try to track down the hardbacks of those.\n\nPost by thegreyelf on\n\nUntrue.
