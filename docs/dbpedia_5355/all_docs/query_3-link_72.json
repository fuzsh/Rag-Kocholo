Grant Papers, created by the Manuscript Division in 1965 after the bulk of the collection was microfilmed, provides a full list of the correspondents and notes the series number and dates of the items indexed. This information is helpful in finding individual letters or documents in the online version. Additional letters received by the Library after 1965 are not listed in this index.\n\nA current finding aid (PDF and HTML) to the Ulysses S. Grant Papers is available online with links to the digital content on this site.\n\nBrief History of the Grant Papers\n\nUlysses S. Grant's papers were acquired by the Library of Congress by gift and purchase during the years 1904-2010. Efforts by the Library of Congress to assemble the Grant Papers began early in this century when Worthington C. Ford, chief of the Manuscript Division, reported in 1904 of learning of \"some letter books of General Grant\" in the White House, which he believed to be \"the sole relic of any Presidential papers.\" Ten years later the letterbooks were placed in the Library of Congress at the request of Major U. S. Grant III, the president's grandson and namesake. Major Grant and his mother, Ida Honore Grant, had already deposited in the Manuscript Division the original manuscript of the Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant and a drawing made by Grant when a West Point cadet. In 1922, Ida Grant and her son deposited the drafts of Grant's first inaugural address and his reports on the Vicksburg and Chattanooga campaigns. The largest additions of original material came in 1953 and 1957 when Ulysses S. Grant III presented the headquarters records in two installments of seventy-five and thirty-six volumes, respectively. In 1960 he gave the Library more than three hundred of Grant's letters to his wife, Julia Dent Grant. Through additional gifts by members of the Grant family and by others and through purchase and photocopying, the Grant Papers have grown to approximately 50,000 manuscripts reproduced on fifty-two reels of microfilm. Thus a quest which began in 1904 has resulted in an accumulation which effectively documents the career of Grant the soldier, the president, and the writer of a great memoir of military history.\n\nA fuller history of the provenance of the collection was prepared for the Index to the Ulysses S. Grant Papers, pp. v-x, and subsequently reproduced in the finding aid (PDF and HTML). A version appears on this website as the essay Provenance of the Ulysses S. Grant Papers.\n\nDescription of Series\n\nThe Ulysses S. Grant Papers are arranged into eleven series. The collection is reproduced on fifty-two reels of microfilm, scans of which comprise this online collection. Series 8-11 of the Ulysses S. Grant Papers are described in more detail in the Scope and Content Note in the collection finding aid (PDF and HTML)."
