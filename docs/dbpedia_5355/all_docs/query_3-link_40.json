        "text": "Forecast of Funding Opportunities under the Department of Education Discretionary Grant Programs for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018\n\nThis document lists virtually all programs and competitions under which the Department (we) has invited or expects to invite applications for new awards and provides actual or estimated deadline dates for the transmittal of applications under these programs. The lists are in the form of charts -- organized according to the Department's principal program offices -- and include programs and competitions we have previously announced, as well as those we plan to announce at a later date. If you are interested in applying for any upcoming grants with the Department of Education, please take the time to register with SAM at www.SAM.gov, as you must have an active account in order to submit a grant application with our agency. We recommend you register now even as you are looking for eligible grant programs so that your SAM registration is active by the time the application is published. This will allow you to focus on writing the application during the period the application is available and you are not spending a portion of that time obtaining SAM registration. Please click here to refer to the SAM tip sheet for additional information.\n\nNote: This document is advisory only and is not an official application notice of the Department of Education. We expect to provide updates to this document starting in the first week of June in a fiscal year and continuing through the following August. Please keep in mind that the dates recorded in this document are SUBJECT TO CHANGE and that the average size/number of awards are ESTIMATES.\n\nNote on printing: For best results, print this document in landscape orientation.\n\nOrganization of this Document\n\nWe have assigned to each principal office a separate chart as follows:\n\nChart 1 - Institute of Education Sciences.\n\nChart 2 - Office of Elementary and Secondary Education.\n\nChart 3 - Office of Postsecondary Education (Link to IFLE Chart)\n\nChart 4 - Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (Links to RSA Chart)\n\nChart 5- Office of Career, Technical and Adult Education\n\nChart 6 - Office of English Language Acquisition\n\nGrant Application Information\n\nHere's how you can tell whether we've already published an application notice for a particular program or competition in the Federal Register and whether the dates we list in this Forecast of Funding Opportunities are actual or estimates:\n\nIf we have published the application notice, we will list the Federal Register (FR) volume and page number (e.g., 65 FR 53402) after the date in column two. The other dates for that program or competition (columns four and five) are actual (as opposed to estimated) dates.\n\nIf we do not follow the date in column two with an FR citation, it means that we have yet to publish the application notice, and the dates (columns, two, four, and five) are estimates only. The actual dates will appear in the official application notice for that program or competition in the Federal Register.\n\nDate of Application Notice. In column two of the charts, we lists the actual or estimated date for publication of the application notice for a given program or competition.\n\nLink to Notice. In column three of the charts, after its publication in the Federal Register, we will provide a link to the application notice for a given program or competition.\n\nElectronic Grant Applications. Applications may be submitted electronically, for certain programs listed in the Forecast, through the Grants Management System (G5: www.g5.gov) or through Grants.gov. The requirements and instructions for submitting applications electronically under the program identified will appear in the Federal Register in the application notice for these programs or competitions. It is important to note that, if a competition is using Grants.gov, it will not be using G5 and vice versa. As part of doing business with the Federal Government, applicants must have an active registration with SAM (www.SAM.gov). Therefore, we strongly recommend that you create a SAM account now (or update your account if you already have an existing one) before the application package becomes available so that once the package is posted, your registration will be complete.\n\nContact Information\n\nProgram Contact Person. In column seven of the charts, we list the name, e-mail address, fax, and telephone numbers of the person or persons to contact for obtaining an application or further information about the programs listed. We also include this information in the actual application notice for that program.\n\nFor Users of TDD or FIRS. If you use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD), you may call the TDD number, if any, listed in the individual application notice. If a TDD number is not listed for a given program, individuals who use a TDD may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1-800-877-8339.\n\nFiscal Information\n\nAvailable Funds. The programs and funding amounts listed in this document are based on the Secretary's best estimates at this time. The Secretary is providing this document in order to give potential applicants adequate time to prepare applications. Potential applicants should note, however, that the Department may cancel some of the competitions listed in this document and may announce some new competitions not listed in this document.\n\nEstimated Average Size of Awards and Number of Awards. Except for programs and competitions administered by the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS), column six lists estimated average size and number of awards. The amounts and numbers referenced in this column are advisory and represent the Secretary's best estimates at this time. The average size of an award is the estimate for a single-year project or for the first budget period of a multi-year project. In the application package for an individual program or competition, applicants will receive information about the amount the Secretary intends to make available for each year of a multi-year project.\n\nIn the case of programs and competitions administered by the principal components of OSERS, the charts differ with regard to the average size of awards. For programs and competitions of this office, column six of the charts lists the average or estimated maximum size of the awards per year. Applicants will receive further information about funding amounts in the application packages for the individual programs.\n\nNote: The Department is not bound by any of the estimates in this document. We advise you to read the actual individual application notices for these programs or competitions published in the Federal Register.\n\n-\n\n(As of July 13, 2018)\n\nChart 1 - Institute of Education Sciences (IES)\n\nFor any application notice not already published, the dates in this chart are estimates.
