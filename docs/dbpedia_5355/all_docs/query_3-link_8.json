        "text": "The last time anything remotely similar happened was 150 years ago. It involved a speeding horse and buggy, the thunder of hooves near the White House and a repeat offender who happened to be the president of the United States.\n\nUlysses S. Grant, who had an eye for spirited horses and an apparent yen to test their mettle, was arrested in 1872 for speeding on a street in Washington, where he had been driving a two-horse carriage. It was the second time in two days that the policeman had stopped the president; the first time, the officer had issued him a warning.\n\nOn Tuesday, Donald J. Trump will become the second American president to be taken into custody by the authorities.\n\nThe Grant episode apparently wasn’t reported in the press at the time, but it came to light in 1908 when The Sunday Star of Washington published an interview with the then-retired officer who pulled the 18th president of the United States over. The former officer’s name was William West, a Black man who had served in the Union Army during the Civil War. The story was confirmed more than 100 years later by the Washington Police Department.\n\nWhile past commanders in chief have been investigated — notably Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton — the arrest of President Grant for his equestrian high jinks is the closest thing history has to offer to the arrest of Mr. Trump.\n\nPresident Grant and several of his friends, with whom he had apparently been racing, were taken to a police station. They all had to put up $20 in bail — what was described in the news account as “collateral” — a sum that would be equivalent today to about $500.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
