He grew up in St. Cloud and graduated from St. Cloud Tech High School. After graduation, he traveled on his Harley and eventually settled in the Rochester area, where he met his future wife, Cindy Clark Eaton. They enjoyed riding his Harley and being with his husky, Phil, who was a beautiful dog and great companion. Don and Cindy were married on Sept. 7, 1995, at their home in Chatfield.\n\nDon enjoyed the outdoors, motorcycles, gun collecting and was an avid Chicago Cubs fan. He loved spending time with his grandchildren and was able to pass his love of the Cubs to his grandson, Noah.\n\nDon is survived by his wife, Cindy of Chatfield; stepdaughter, Shannon (Mat) Schaefer of Wanamingo; stepson, Travis Eaton; grandchildren, Noah, Macy, Elih, Owen and Sawyer; sisters, Dianne, Debbie, Annette and Barb; and father-in-law, Don Clark.
