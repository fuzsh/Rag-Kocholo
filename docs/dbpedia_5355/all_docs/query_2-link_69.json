        "text": "Scammers create and maintain fraudulent postings on many reputable job boards, for monetary gain, including Handshake and even networking sites like LinkedIn. While every position that is posted to Handshake is vetted, sometimes fraudulent postings make it through.\n\nScammers may also directly contact you, for example through email or phone, soliciting to hire you for an open job position. Some will even go as far as stating that they represent an established company or pretend to be a well known individual. They may even reference the ICC in some way to make them seem more legitimate.\n\nThese scams most often times target you financially. They may do so directly by asking you to send money to the scammers such as through an online payment application or gift cards. Or they may do so indirectly by stealing your identity or banking information. This may all be done in the disguise of either you getting hired for the job or you performing tasks in the job.\n\nHow To Identify Job Scams\n\nThere are many potential signs of a job scam. Here are some. Be wary if the job posting or email exhibits any of these signs:\n\nEmail or contact to you that you were not expecting to receive\n\nAsks for any money\n\nAsks for you to make purchases on their behalf such as gift cards\n\nAsks for sensitive personal information such as bank account\n\nThe person is out of town or on a business trip and not physically able to meet\n\nFocuses on how much money you'll make. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.\n\nUses a generic email address such as @gmail.com or @yahoo.com (check on the actual email address used in the from field or email address given as the reply to)\n\nReferences their company but don't use an email address from their company's domain\n\nLinks to a fake or minimalist website\n\nLists a company without an established physical office\n\nHas spelling errors or lacks a professional tone\n\nReferences getting your contact information from your university or career center\n\nIf a company is legitimate it usually takes them a while to sort through applications and respond to you. Be wary of immediate responses to your applications.\n\nWhen evaluating an email message, don't rely on just trusting based on who sent it. For example if an email came from an address belonging to your organization, don't automatically assume it is legitimate. Email accounts may become compromised from a scam or phishing attack and end up being used to further scam or phish others within your organzation.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n7 Ways to Safeguard Yourself From Job Phishing Scams\n\nStudent Job and Internship Scams: Know the Red Flags\n\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC) job scams webpage\n\nOne reported often is the fake check scam\n\nLook up companies with the Better Business Bureau\n\nWhat To Do If You Suspect a Scam or Have Been Scammed\n\nIf you are unsure or believe something is fraudulent, email the ICC.\n\nIf you have already sent money, contact your bank or credit card company right away to close the account or dispute the charges.\n\nCall the local police using their non-emergency number and report the incident.\n\nFile a cybercrime incident report with the FTC if it took place over the internet.\n\nSample Scam Emails\n\nFrom: Administrative Assistant Consultant [trujillostacey1@*****.***]\n\nDate: Tue, Jun 25, 2024 at 6:22 AM\n\nSubject: PART-TIME HIRE!\n\nThe University of California, Davis Student Job and Intern Service, offered to the UC Davis community and managed by the Office of Financial Aid and Student Employment currently needs the service students to work as administrative assistants and get paid $450 weekly.\n\nThe position is available to students from any department of the institution. tasks will be carried out remotely and at leisure times, materials needed will be provided by the department.\n\nTo proceed with the application process, submit your full name, year of study, functional phone number and major via this email address to receive the job description.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nProf. Kenneth Lam\n\nVM: POPULATION HLTH & REPROD\n\nCopyright Â© The Regents of the University of California, Davis campus.
