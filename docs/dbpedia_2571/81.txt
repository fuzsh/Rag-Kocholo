Yeah, but he's not exactly bad either.

He is certainly trying his best and is enjoyable as far as the octaves don't go too high. With the Live in New York CD I have to push the karaoke button though.

The topic started with an Ayreon fan searching for Dream Theater albums, i'd like to know if some think the other way around. Maybe knowing, or heard of Ayreon/Arjen Lucassen because of the singing of James on "the human equation"?

I'm a big fan of both Dream Theater and Arjen (since he is the mastermind behind ayreon, star one, ambeon and now Stream of Passion) and they both make great and technical music which can make a big man cry

Arf?

I enjoy him best when he's straining on those high notes. It gives it the 80s metal Power Ballad feel to it

I am a relatively new DT fan. Two things I didn't see mentioned (i may be blind, they may have been) concerning DT albums. If you havent heard the offical bootleg of DT covering the entire Master of Puppets album, get it. I've seen it for sale on the web at various places. It's a live recording but it's great quality. As a long time fan of old Metallica, I love the DT twist on it. There are parts where it seems DT plays it better than Metallica themselves. The second album to get the is John Petrucci & Jordan Rudess - An Evening With John Petrucci & Jordan Rudess. It is an excellent display of Petrucci's guitar mastery.

Btw, I'm listening to Scenes right now.

Threshold is really an amazing band, with an excellent vocalist (you can't say that full-heartedly for DT) and a tighter a bit rougher sound than DT but very memorable songs.

Every DT fan should seriously try listening to one of their albums. Now I think I have found another band on equal ground with DT.

I have to agree with you on this reco, Subsurface is one fantastic album, probably the best they've done in their distinguished career. A definite must for prog-metal fans.

3rd'ed. Subsurface is my first Threshold experience (first heard "Ground Control" on The Bone Yard on XM!) and WOW what a great CD. I would disagree that the vocalist is "better" than DTs (I worship the ground on which LaBrie walks though ) but to each his own. A must for a prog rock fan.

Well I had heard a bit of the latest album and was quite impressed by what I heard. Octavarium is an excellent album begining to end. Question now is where to go from here in reguards to DT?

I've never been a huge fan of "Progressive Metal", but these guys are excellent!
