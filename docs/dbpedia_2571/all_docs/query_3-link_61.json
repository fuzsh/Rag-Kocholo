        "text": "Career beginnings\n\nParamore was created in 2004 when friends Hayley Williams, brothers Josh and Zac Farro, Jeremy Davis and Jason Bynum would meet up and jam together after school. As most of the band apart from Davis were under 18, Hayley's parents would drive them to perform at various shows and festivals. After attracting the attention of record label executives, the band, who originate from Franklin, Tennessee, was signed to Atlantic Records and Fueled By Ramen in 2005. However, shortly after this, Davis left the band citing personal reasons and was replaced by bass player John Hembree.\n\n2005: 'All We Know Is Falling'\n\nUpset about Davis leaving the band, Paramore used the experience as inspiration for their debut album, 'All We Know is Falling'. Despite leaving five months earlier, Paramore asked Davis to return just before the album was released. He accepted and replaced Hembree. Later that year, guitarist Hunter Lamb was brought in to replace Jason Bynum.\n\n'All We Know Is Falling' was released in July 2005, along with singles 'Pressure', 'Emergency' and 'All We Know'. The album reached Number 4 on the UK Rock chart and Number 51 on the UK chart. It also peaked at number 30 on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums in 2006. While the album didn't perform as well as their record label had hoped, it did help Paramore to build a larger fanbase, particularly in the emo/alternative rock scene, on both sides of the pond.\n\n2007: 'Riot!'\n\nParamore had their major breakthrough moment after the release of their second album, 'Riot!' in 2007. The now 2x Platinum-selling album featured singles 'That's What You Get', 'CrushCrushCrush', 'Hallelujah' and their biggest song to date, 'Misery Business'. The band chose the name 'Riot!' for the album, because it means \"a sudden outburst of uncontrolled emotion\" which they felt \"summed it all up\".\n\n2007: Jeremy returns and Taylor York joins\n\nAt this point, the band had gone through yet another lineup change after saying goodbye to Hunter Lamb, who was later replaced by guitarist Taylor York, a friend of the Farro brothers. Davis was also briefly expelled from the band, which according to Josh Farro was due to \"his lack of work ethic and participation in things that Zac, Hayley and I didn't agree with\". However, Hayley later convinced the rest of the band to let him return as their bass player for the second time.\n\n2009: Third album 'Brand New Eyes'\n\nAfter extensively touring their 'Riot!' album, Paramore went back into the studio to write and record their third album in 2009. 'Brand New Eyes' was released later that year and was an international success, thanks to singles 'Ignorance', 'Brick By Boring Brick', 'The Only Exception', 'Careful' and 'Playing God'. Paramore then went on tour with You Me At Six for a 15-date European tour, which culminated at a show at London's Wembley stadium which was watched by over 12,000 fans.\n\n2010: The Farro Brothers leave Paramore\n\nIn 2010, Hayley, Jeremy and Taylor announced on the Paramore website that founding members Zac and Josh Farro had left the band. The trio wrote, ' None of us were really shocked. For the past year, it hasn't seemed as if they wanted to be around anymore ... We want Josh and Zac to do something that makes them happy, and if that isn't here with us, then we support them in finding happiness elsewhere.'\n\nA year later, Paramore released their first single as a trio, 'Monster' which featured on the movie, Transformers: Dark of the Moon soundtrack.\n\n2012: Fourth self-titled album\n\nIn 2012, Paramore released their self-titled fourth album -their first as a trio. This album marked a change in direction for the band as they came back with a brand new look and sound. The change worked in their favour, with the album reaching Number 1 on the US Billboard 200 and the UK Album chart.\n\n2017: 'After Laughter'\n\nWith the new line-up in place, Paramore released 'After Laughter', their fifth studio album in 2017 which had a distinct '80s new wave vibe. It debuted at Number 6 on the US Billboard 200, making it their third top 10 on the chart and also reached the Top 10 in countries such as the UK, Australia and Canada.\n\n2022: The band get back in the studio\n\nThe group confirmed in Jan 2022 that they were back in the studio recording their sixth album - the first in five years. While there's currently no title or release date for the new record, the Tennessee trio promised the return of riffs to Paramore's sound as the album will feature \"more emphasis on the guitar\" than 2017's 'After Laughter', according to vocalist Hayley Williams.\n\n2022: 'This Is Why'\n\nFinally, Paramore fans had some new music to sink their teeth into with the release of single 'This Is Why' in September 2022. Hayley said of the track, which the upcoming sixth album is named after: \"'This Is Why' was the very last song we wrote for the album. To be honest, I was so tired of writing lyrics but Taylor convinced Zac and I both that we should work on this last idea.\n\n\"What came out of it was the title track for the whole album. It summarizes the plethora of ridiculous emotions, the rollercoaster of being alive in 2022, having survived even just the last three or four years. You'd think after a global pandemic of biblical proportions and the impending doom of a dying planet, that humans would have found it deep within themselves to be kinder or more empathetic or something.\"\n\n2022: When We Were Young festival\n\nThe trio took part in the 'When We Were Young' festival in October 2022, performing alongside the likes of The All-American Rejects, Sleeping with Sirens, and Black Veil Brides. Also on the bill were forgotten favourites We The Kings, The Ready Set, and 3OH!3, plus newcomers like Meet Me @ The Altar and The Linda Lindas.\n\n2023: 'This Is Why' album release\n\nParamore's album 'This Is Why' was released on 10th February 2023, preceded by an explanatory post from the group which described why you might listen to it: \"Hello. It's been 5.5 years since we released our last album. What'd we miss?\n\n\"If within the last 5.5 years you've felt/experienced sensations of: Agoraphobia, Righteous Rage, Confused About The Difference Between Selfishness and Self-Preservation, Complete and Utter Apathy, Cabin Fever, Deep-Seated Vengefulness, Moral Superiority, Dissociation, Disassociation, Disbelief At The Inconsistencies of The American-English Language, American Psycho, Revelation, Nostalgia For Things You've Not Yet Experienced and Did Not Know You Even Wanted To, Resignation Then oh boy, do we have an album for you.\""
