        "text": "Squeeze’s debut self-titled album was released by A&M in 1978 (after a three-song EP) at the height of the punk revolution, but its pop songwriting hooks and melodies hark back to the ‘60s British Invasion. That album included the track, “Take Me I’m Yours,” followed by a cadre of hits on the UK charts including “Cool for Cats,” “Up the Junction,” “Pulling Mussels From A Shell,” “Black Coffee in Bed” and “Labeled With Love.” Squeeze’s hits “Tempted,” “Hourglass” and “853-5937” (from East Side Story) made their mark in the U.S. in 1981.\n\nSqueeze disbanded in 1999 and reunited in 2007, releasing three new albums since then (2010’s Spot the Difference, 2015’s Cradle to the Grave and 2017’s The Knowledge,) as well as various solo projects from both Chris and Glenn. Aside from Difford and Tilbrook, Squeeze now features keyboardist Stephen Large and drummer Simon Hanson (since 2007) percussionist/backing vocalist Steve Smith (frontman for electronic band Dirty Vegas) along with pedal/lap steel guitarist Melvin Duffy (who joined them for the 2019 tour) and Owen Biddle, former bassist for The Roots who joined in 2020.\n\nThe band’s “Squeeze Songbook 2019” tour featured opening acts like KT Tunstall, They Might Be Giants, X, Marshall Crenshaw, the Mavericks and Leon Tilbrook in selected cities and was widely praised by critics. Two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foo Fighters founder Dave Grohl even joined the band at the Bourbon & Beyond Festival in Louisville in September 2019 to perform percussion on “Black Coffee in Bed.”\n\nSqueeze most recently toured across the U.S. in 2021 with Hall & Oates, being the first UK band to tour the US since the pandemic.\n\nIn May 1977, Adam Ant’s newly formed band, The Ants, made their public debut at the ICA restaurant in London, stopping abruptly after one song. The band continued their set in the ICA theatre and later gained attention through performances at the Man in the Moon pub.\n\nIn 1978, Adam Ant and the band immersed themselves in the London gig circuit, securing a residency at the Marquee club. The band underwent a lineup change, becoming Adam and the Ants, and garnered attention through their involvement in the film Jubilee.\n\nThe year 1978 saw the band building a solid fan base and recording for BBC Peel sessions. In May, they supported X-Ray Spex at the Roundhouse, marking the last show with Jordan and Johnny Bivouac. Matthew Ashman joined as the guitarist, leading to a Decca Records deal, a successful European tour, and the release of their debut single “Young Parisians.”\n\nIn 1979, the band faced contractual issues with Decca but continued to tour nationally, gaining popularity. They signed with Do-it Records and released the single “Zerox” before recording their debut album, “Dirk Wears White Sox,” which received mixed reviews. After a temporary split, the band regrouped, bringing in new members and achieving success in 1980 with the single “Kings of the Wild Frontier” and the album of the same name.\n\nChristopher Cross burst onto the music scene with his 1980 self-titled debut album, winning five Grammy Awards, including—for the first time in Grammy history—the “Big Four” most prestigious awards: Record of the Year (for the single “Sailing”), Album of the Year, Song of the Year (also “Sailing”), and Best New Artist. In a career spanning more than four decades, Cross has sold over 10 million albums. His music has garnered five Grammys, an Oscar, a Golden Globe, an Emmy nomination and five Top 10 singles.\n\nWithin a year of the first album’s release, Cross joined music royalty Burt Bacharach to write “Arthur’s Theme,” for the movie Arthur, which won an Academy Award for Best Song. With his 1983 release, Another Page, Cross was again in the Top 10 with the singles “All Right” and “Think of Laura.” His song, “Swept Away,” composed for the hit television series, Growing Pains, was nominated for an Emmy.\n\nCross started his own label and, since 2007, has released 8 albums of new material, including A Christopher Cross Christmas and The Café Carlyle Sessions, jazz treatments of hits and favorites born out of a residency at the famous Hotel Carlyle in New York City. Take Me as I Am, released in 2018, features richly-crafted melodies and elegant guitar work. The latest project for Christopher Cross Records is aptly titled The Complete Works. Released in 2020, it celebrates his 40th anniversary as a recording artist and is a collection of all 12 previously-released CDs, one CD of singles and bonus tracks, and a pink vinyl containing one track from each album chosen by Christopher.\n\nEven though the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the 40th Anniversary tour, starting in 2021, he is once again performing the carefully-crafted songs and music his fans enjoy, starting with “Sailing” and “Ride Like the Wind” from his Grammy-winning debut album and continuing through the decades of his ever-changing but always excellent material. More 40th Anniversary concert dates will be announced soon.\n\nAll in all, it’s been quite a ride, one that has taken Cross from his early days in Texas where he once served as a drum tech for Ginger Baker, bought gear from Jimmy Page, and played lead guitar for Deep Purple on a night when Ritchie Blackmore fell ill, to this place as a respected singer-songwriter-guitar player who continues to share his original music with the world.\n\nGuided by the forces of family, faith, and music, Sheila E. has made a name for herself as one of the most talented musical icons over the decades. With a fearless nature and a passion for sharing her gifts with others, Sheila truly follows the beat of her own drum. She touches the lives of so many, with her dynamic music career at the heart of everything. Sheila’s eagerness to share her music, openness as an author, and fire for her ministry make her such a relatable, inspirational figure for people of all ages.\n\nBorn into a musical family, Sheila Escovedo (Sheila E.) has been driven by an inner rhythm her entire life. As a young girl, she was immersed in the diverse music scenes of the Bay Area—influenced and inspired by her percussionist father Pete Escovedo; musical uncles Coke Escovedo, Alejandro Escovedo, Mario Escovedo, and Javier Escovedo; and godfather Tito Puente. Growing up in the Escovedo household, musical instruments were for everyone. “Nobody cared as long as you could keep time (or have a good time),” she writes in her memoir, The Beat Of My Own Drum.\n\nAt the age of 5, Sheila gave her first public performance for an audience of 3,000, appearing alongside her dad. It was while on that stage playing a drum solo that Sheila first realized she was going to be a percussionist. Five decades later, and the beat that has always driven her is showing no signs of slowing down. The famous drummer, singer, songwriter, author, humanitarian, and icon is following the beat of her own drum. She considers music to be the purest form of self-expression and the one true love of her life.\n\nAt its core, WARRANT is an American rock band through and through. Hitting it big in 1989, the Hollywood, CA based band rose through the ranks of the local Sunset Strip scene to the level of multiplatinum selling, chart-topping success. The band first came into the national spotlight with their debut album Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich. This album produced Radio and MTV chart toppers “Down Boys,” “Sometimes She Cries,” and the massive hit “Heaven” which reached #1 in Rolling Stone and #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks in a row. The single “Heaven” enjoyed Gold sales and the Album went Platinum in Canada as well, eventually selling over 3 million copies. The band toured the globe performing 262 shows in support of DRFSR and closed the year with a Platinum Home Video.\n\nWARRANT’s sophomore album Cherry Pie was released in September 1990. This album, which spawned the MTV & Radio hits “Cherry Pie,” “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” and “I Saw Red,” all reached the Top 10 in the United States and went on to sell 3 million copies, reaching Platinum sales in Canada and Australia. The band played 200 shows in support of Cherry Pie and finished the tour headlining sheds all over the USA and ended up being one of the top grossing tours of 1991. Over the course of their career, WARRANT has sold over 10 million albums worldwide. The song “Cherry Pie” has taken on a pop culture life of its own, being featured in countless movies, TV shows, commercials and the hugely popular video game Guitar Hero II.\n\nWARRANT’s signature style of rock music is very catchy and yet very melodic and remains the band’s signature sound today. In September 2008, Robert Mason replaced Jani Lane (RIP) as lead vocalist joining the other four original members, Jerry Dixon, Steven Sweet, Joey Allen and Erik Turner. Their current album Louder Harder Faster, released on Frontiers Records, has been highly regarded in reviews and embraced by fans.\n\nWARRANT has been headlining festivals, casinos and fairs all over the country in support of their latest CD Louder Harder Faster and the 30 year anniversary of their debut album Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich. The band is fired up and tighter than every musically! These rockers can’t wait to play not only ALL the hits fans know & love, but also new tunes/videos like “Louder Harder Faster” & “I Think I Will Just Stay Here & Drink.”\n\nDokken exploded out of the boiling hard rock/heavy metal scene in Los Angeles in the early 1980s. 1983’s “Breaking the Chains” with its catchy title track, set the stage for Dokken becoming the most dominant creative and commercial force in the world of Melodic Hard Rock for the following years. Such classic albums as “Tooth and Nail”, “Under Lock and Key” and “Back for the Attack” all became Multi-Platinum selling smashes and the live “Beast from the East” went gold in Europe and Japan. Songs like “Alone Again”, “Just Got Lucky”, “Into the Fire”, “In My Dreams”, “Unchain the Night”, “Dream Warriors”, “Burning like a Flame” and “Heaven Sent” are still nowadays regarded among the genre’s finest.\n\nDokken has shared the stage with AC/DC, Metallica, Aerosmith, Judas Priest, Van Halen, Kiss, Scorpions, as well as Bon Jovi, just to name a few. The band hit stadium status in 1988, playing in front of over a million fans in just five weeks. It seemed Dokken was on the verge of superstardom. But like so many other bands that have come before and after them, Dokken broke up his group in 1989.\n\nIn 1994, the legendary A&R man John Kalodner offered Dokken a recording contract on the condition the group had to be original members. The band released the appropriately titled “Dysfunctional” in 1995 selling 450,000 copies, which by the mid ’90s was considered by industry standards very respectable. But just as they were on the verge of releasing a second single, filming a video, starting a world tour and “taking it all the way”, as Don Dokken puts it, the baggage from their past reared its ugly head, and again the group began to unravel. Soon after guitarist George Lynch left the group, he was replaced by Reb Beach (Winger, Whitesnake).\n\nThey released “Erase the Slate” in 1999 Followed by their DVD “Live from the Sun” in 2000. In 2001, Beach was replaced by John Norum (Europe) and released the album “Long Way Home”. By 2003 guitarist Jon Levin came on board with the subsequent release of the albums “Hell to pay”. Lightening strikes Again’ and ‘Broken Bones’ and has remained with the group for over 20 years now. All 3 CD’s have been aclamained as a true and definite return to there classic sound.\n\nIn October 2016, the original members of Dokken reunited for a brief Sold-Out tour of Japan, playing in several Arenas as well as co-Headlining the Loud Park Festival with the Scorpions. But as Don says, “It was fun to play with the original members again, but my current line-up of Dokken will remain so.”\n\nDOKKEN is now Don Dokken (vocals), Mick Brown (drums), Jon Levin (guitar) and Chris McCarvill (bass).\n\nDokken has survived and kept their loyal fans in a time when people’s tastes change as fast as Britney Spears’ wardrobe, they have been embraced by a whole new generation of rock fans. They recently played at ‘The Bang Your Head Festival’ in Germany as well as ‘Rambling Man’ in England receiving rave reviews. The group is now currently back in the U S wrapping up there 2017 world tour! The group plans on a new record release in 2018.\n\nThey say a cat has nine lives and it seems Dokken is enjoying more than a few as well!\n\nFireHouse has been rockin’ for over a decade. Their music has taken them all over the world and has produced Gold, Platinum and Multi-Platinum records in the United States and countries abroad.\n\nIn 1990, their first album, entitled FireHouse, was released. The band’s first single, Shake & Tumble, had impressive radio success. The band then released Don’t Treat Me Bad, which became their first Top Ten hit. This was followed by Love of a Lifetime, which also entered the Top Ten, reaching the #3 spot on the United States charts. This string of hits vaulted their first album to double platinum status in the United States; also going gold in Canada, Japan and Singapore. At the 1991 American Music Awards, FireHouse found themselves standing before the nation accepting the award for Best New Hard Rock/Metal Band, chosen over Nirvana and Alice in Chains.\n\nThe band’s second album, Hold Your Fire, was released in 1992. It produced the hits Reach for the Sky and Sleeping with You. Another Top Ten hit, When I Look into Your Eyes, peaked on the United States charts at #5. This album earned the band two more gold albums and over 1 million sales worldwide.\n\nIn 1995, FireHouse released their third album on Epic, simply titled 3. Once again, FireHouse produced another Top Forty hit in the United States with I Live My Life For You. It was with this album that FireHouse made their first trip to Southeast Asia for a promotional tour. Earlier American hits like Don’t Treat Me Bad, Love of a Lifetime and When I Look into Your Eyes had climbed the charts in Asia. Here for You, the second single from 3, had also become a hit. The band then continued their promotional tour in South American countries such as Brazil and Argentina.\n\nTheir fourth album, Good Acoustics, was released in 1996 and quickly went gold in Malaysia, Thailand, and Philippines. Good Acoustics contains unplugged versions of the group’s greatest hits, as well as four new songs. This album produced foreign hits such as In Your Perfect World, Love Don’t Care and You Are My Religion. The band returned to Southeast Asia for another promotional tour at the end of 1996. Then, in February 1997, FireHouse embarked on their first concert tour of Southeast Asia playing sold out shows for fans in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, and Japan. During May and June they toured the United States before returning to Southeast Asia in July for an unprecedented twenty-five city sold out tour of Indonesia.\n\nIn 1998, FireHouse toured the United States on the Rock Never Stops tour, which also included Slaughter, Warrant, Quiet Riot, and LA Guns. October of 1998 featured the Asian release of FireHouse’s fifth CD, Category 5 on Pony Canyon Records. The album quickly climbed to #4 on the Japanese charts, and supporting promotional tour of Japan followed. Category 5 was officially released in the United States in 1999.\n\nFireHouse continued touring through the winter and spring of 1999, including 3 more sold out shows in Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka. On April 22, 1999, the band recorded their live show in Osaka. The result – the first ever live album by FireHouse. Bring ‘em Out Live was released in Japan in December 1999 and in the United States on Spitfire Records in July 2000.\n\nThe turn of the century brought the release their seventh album, titled O2. It has been released in SE Asia on Pony Canyon Records, and in the US on Spitfire Records. This album had notable success despite the changing style of popular rock music. During this time, the band decided to part ways with original bass player, Perry Richardson. O2’s remarkable bass playing was supplied by Bruce Waibel. Bruce brought to the band his phenomenal bass playing along with is equally impressive sense of humor. We truly regret to say that in September 2003, Bruce has passed away. He will be greatly missed as a friend and talented musician.\n\nFireHouse headed back into the studio in early 2003 to write and record their 8th album, PRIME TIME. As music changes over time, FireHouse continues to evolve their musical style; yet, at the same time, hang onto their hard rock roots. Released in October of 2003, album number 8 is no exception. You can expect to hear what FireHouse is famous for … soulful, melodic hard rock.\n\nT’Pau was a late-1980s rock group led by singer Carol Decker. They had a string of Top 40 hits in the UK, and several hits in the United States and Europe.\n\nT’Pau formed in 1986. The members originated from the towns of Shrewsbury and Wellington in central England and took their name from a Vulcan high priestess in the classic Star Trek episode Amok Time. Their debut single and first hit was the 1987 release Heart and Soul. Initially a flop in the UK, it first became a hit in the U.S. Billboard charts, reaching #4, a feat it repeated in the UK Singles Chart some months later. The same year, the band had their biggest hit with the ballad, “China in Your Hand,” which spent five weeks at Number One in the UK chart, and also claimed the top slot in several European countries, although oddly the song made little impact on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nThey had a number of smaller hits which made it to at least the UK Top 40, including the singles “Valentine”, “Sex Talk” (a new recording of early flop single “Intimate Strangers”), “I Will Be With You”, and “Secret Garden.” Their 1987 album Bridge Of Spies (the album was called T’Pau in the U.S.) was a best seller and won several British record industry awards.\n\nNevertheless, the band failed to maintain their success and split in 1991. But Decker reformed the band with a new line-up in 1998, and T’Pau have in recent years attempted a comeback.\n\nIn May 2005, Carol Decker reached the final round of the ITV show Hit Me Baby One More Time, singing the T’Pau hit “China in Your Hand.”\n\nIn The Jam, Bruce Foxten and drummer Rick Buckler were the driving force, power and rhythm section behind singer, guitarist, and songwriter Paul Weller. Bruce’s versatility is evident, taking lead vocals on “David Watts” (The Kinks) and writing “News Of The World”, which to this day appears as the theme to the BBC’s Mock the Week show and has introduced his work to a new generation of fans. Perhaps Bruce’s most notable work “Smithers-Jones”, the story of the city executive who soon finds he has been chewed up & spat out, is just as pertinent today as it was in 1979 when he wrote it for the Setting Sons LP.\n\nAfter The Jam split in 1982, Foxton pursued a solo career. He had a hit with the single “Freak” and collaborated with other musicians, until he got the call from Stiff Little Fingers’ Jake Burns, staying with SLF for fifteen years, recording four albums, namely, Flags and Emblems, Get a Life, Tinderbox, and Guitar and Drum.\n\nRussell Hastings has been working with Bruce Foxton since 2007 when Russell and Rick Buckler were touring with The Gift which was formed in 2006. Russell has been the only frontman to work with both Rick Buckler and Bruce Foxton since Paul Weller split The Jam in 1982 and has been earning respect from fans across the world as a frontman and with his guitar skills. As a genuine Jam fan, his passion and understanding of The Jam’s history is second to none and has toured the world playing to packed houses of Jam fans for years.\n\nIn May 2007 From The Jam toured the UK to sold out venues. Since then they have toured the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand as well as some dates in Europe.\n\nBrian Wilk began playing piano as early as he could reach the EBONY AND IVORY, but classical music gave him GROWING PAINS. So when the 80’s hit, he was a MANIAC for MTV and 80’s TV theme songs. He gave up riding the MORNING TRAIN and his 9 TO 5 life to pursue music, playing top 40 and performing with the ComedySportz improv troupe. But he was an OWNER OF A LONELY HEART until dueling pianos said you CAN’T FIGHT THIS FEELING and he found his TRUE COLORS. When Brad Heron was born, Dr. Feelgood took one look at his Flock of Seagulls hairdo and said, “This kid is destined for 80’s greatness!” His parents nurtured this gift with diligence: keeping him swaddled in red and black Thriller onesies, playing Ferris Bueller’s Day Off in his crib, and pushing him around in a mini DeLorean stroller. He was soon reaching for that Casio keyboard, impressing everybody with his pop music covers. There was no stopping the music after that. Year after year, it has been proven onboard The 80s Cruise that there is almost no 80s song that Brian and Brad don’t know (or can’t make up the words to)! This dynamic duo knows how to get a crowd going. You can catch them around the ship rockin’ the keys all week!"
