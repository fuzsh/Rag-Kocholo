        "text": "1.\n\nFcukers\n\nHomie Don’t Shake\n\nFcukers are a New York electronic trio who are bringing a big indie sleaze vibe in their music to date. I wrote an intro piece to their vibe but what you need to know about ‘Homie Don’t Shake’ is ‘Homie Don’t Shake’ hsd a literal sample of Beck’s Devil’s Haircut’ included and cowbell that plucked from a record from The Rapture, vocals channelled from Brazil indie sleaze era band CSS, and a breakdown that is straight out of the Chemical Brothers playbook.\n\nIt’s hard to make music sound this nonchalantly cool, but Fcukers do it easily, ‘Homie Don’t Shake’ is nonsensical (“say you’ll DJ at my wake”) grimey, DIY, evocative of an early era (I feel like the Cobra Snake reference is intentional) and endlessly repeatable.\n\n3.\n\nSilverbacks\n\nSelling Shovels\n\nThe Kildare/Belgian alt-rock band have announced their third album Easy Being A Winner, out on Friday 18th October through Central Tones/Cargo.\n\n‘Selling Shovels’ was the first song from the now six-piece band since the 2022 second album Archive Material. The track has the band’s cerebral wonky alt-guitar pop style intact, inspired by Dan Kelly’s penchant for jumping straight the death info on Wikipedia on famous people.\n\n“The idea for these lyrics came from a habit I have – maybe everyone does it? When reading a historical figure’s Wikipedia page I often lose interest and so I jump straight to the ‘personal life’ and ‘death’ part of the page to see how they died and the circumstances they were in at the time. The lyrics flicker between mundane distractions and fairly horrific images of war. Selling Shovels is a reference to ‘selling shovels during the gold rush’.”\n\nOriginally featured.\n\n5.\n\nSkinner\n\nNew Wave Vaudeville\n\nDublin-based multi-instrumentalist, singer and producer Aaron Corcoran is back with a song inspired by the New York no wave scene.‘New Wave Vaudeville’, is a song inspired by the freeform art club in New York in the late ’70s and early ’80s, and is out today on Faction Records.\n\nI actually got to meet the artist David McDermott while I was writing the song. He was the original host and MC of New Wave Vaudeville in the 70s and he lives in Dublin now. He agreed to meet up with me and I got to ask him a bunch of questions about it and the New York No-wave music and art scene in the late 70s. He’s a very inspiring guy and talking to him really helped me to piece together the song more accurately.”\n\nIt’s a song about being proud of being weird.\n\nThe song is inspired by the variety show extravaganza New Wave Vaudeville. It was a musical variety freak show hosted in the 57 club in New York in the late 70’s with an emphasis on showcasing strange and unorthodox acts. I liked the ethos they had about embracing the weird and wanted to try and incorporate that idea into a song.\n\nDOI: I manage Skinner\n\n7.\n\nChanel Beads\n\nPolice Scanner\n\nNew York-based musician Shane Lavers and close collaborators Maya McGrory and Zachary Paul make up Chanel Beads, and their album of indie, electronic, pop, and alternative music called Dedicated To The World came out on Jagjaguwar in April.\n\n‘Police Scanner’ is a returning visitor to my ears from the record, and it makes sense that the band have been supporting Mount Kimbie, as their music reminds of Mount Kimbie’s current iteration, with more of a foot in the singer-songwriting realm.\n\nChanel Beads play Bello Bar Dublin on November 17th.\n\n8.\n\nKynsy\n\nStereo Games\n\nFollowing recent single ‘Money’, London-based Dublin artist Kynsy has dropped another indie rock banger on Nice Swan.\n\n‘Stereo Games’ is influenced by New Young Pony Club, and Wet Leg, which you can detect readily. It’s the kind of bright and breezy pop rock song that should do well on UK guitar radio.\n\n“This song is a wild ride through the chaos of love and self-destruction. It’s about the intense, sometimes toxic, passion that can consume us, turning heartbreak into a form of art. With a nod to mythic and modern icons like Dionysus and Kendrick Lamar, it’s a rebellious anthem that immortalises the madness of love in a ‘stereo game’ of emotions and dreams”.\n\nWatch the video above which is giving A Tale Of Two Sisters in technicolour vibes, directed by Dougie Chalmers.\n\n9.\n\nA Lazarus Soul\n\nThe Dealers\n\nA Lazarus Soul chiefly identify as a Dublin band. Their last album was called The D They Put Between the R & L, and their songs talk of the true Dublin working class.\n\nFive years later, and the band’s album No Flowers Grow In Cement Gardens is released today, and features this beautiful stirring acoustic and string-arranged song about Dublin street traders Bridie and Tessie.\n\nThe pleasure of listening to the lyrics of these characters is a big part of the appeal, as is Brian Brannigan’s vocal.\n\nMoney for jam.\n\nA Lazarus Soul’ Tickets upcoming gig dates are at Vicar Street in October, Coughlan’s in Cork and Cleere’s in Kilkenny.\n\n11.\n\nHis Father’s Voice\n\nThe Blues\n\nFrom the Beach House-esque ‘Forgot To Feed’ to April’s ‘Arm’s Length’ , and now to their newest single ‘The Blues’, Limerick band His Father’s Voice are a band catching the ones to watch tag fast.\n\nThe song brandishes darkly lit guitar lines under Ash O’Connor’s bright melodies and underscores the duality of the light and dark with a video by Graham Patterson (Out of Place / Feile na Gréine), that was inspired by the 1981 psychological horror film Possession.\n\nThe band cite Siouxsie & the Banshees, Protomartyr, Drahla and The Altered Hours as sonic inspirations and share the following statement alongside the release:\n\nOriginally posted here.\n\n17.\n\nEmma Noodles\n\nBreath Away\n\nKildare artist Emma Noodles dropped a roller-skating themed self-directed and made video for her recent song ‘Breath Away’, a glossy retro synth pop tune that immediately jumped out of the noise recently.\n\nThe video was made with the help of her dad who drove the car with her friend Jack with the camera in the boot. The incoming car beeps lead Emma to skate into the ditch and pick up some cuts and bruises.\n\nAll in the name of art.\n\nHey, before you go...\n\nNialler9 has been covering new music, new artists and gigs for the last 18 years.
