        "text": "Long before Luke Combsâ cover of âFast Carâ was given an official release on his acclaimed 2023 album, Gettinâ Old, Luke's Tracy Chapman cover had already worked its way into fansâ hearts.\n\nThis was due to the Luke sharing an acoustic rendition of âFast Carâ on his YouTube channel almost six years ago, with fans clamouring for his gravelly and gently countrified version of the classic ballad to be made available on streaming platforms ever since.\n\nThey got their wish in March 2023, when the âBeautiful Crazyâ hitmaker surprised critics and fans alike by including âFast Carâ in the tracklist for Gettinâ Old.\n\nAs is the case with any Luke Combs album, Gettinâ Old was packed with chart-topping single candidates, with âLove You Anywayâ being shipped to Country Radio before the project had been put out. However, with âFast Carâ quickly building up a head of steam upon its release, Luke and his team were left with no choice but to select it as his next single.\n\nAt the time of writing, âFast Carâ is on the cusp of going No. 1 on the Mediabase Country chart, while it has also matched Luke Combsâ highest positioning on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100, which he earned when âForever After Allâ reached No. 2.\n\nLuke Combs has repeatedly underlined that he was keen to stick closely to Tracy Chapman's 1988 original, with the country superstar citing âFast Carâ as the song his dad would always play in the car, as well as being one of the first tracks he learnt the guitar to.\n\nIt's one of the only songs Luke Combs has cut that he hasn't co-written, along with the neo-Western âWhere The Wild Things Areâ, which also appeared on Gettinâ Old.\n\nLuke Combs made a point of not playing around too much with the instrumentation that was used on Tracy Chapman's original. With Lukeâs trademark husky vocals, his rendition of âFast Carâ benefits from this decision to keep the guitar backing relatively drawn-in, with the central, serpentine beat glueing the track together.\n\nAs with Tracy Chapman's version, the ballad coasts gently along for the first few verses as Luke sets the scene, before launching into the iconic hook, where he is joined by a smooth crescendo as the instrumentation matches his escalation in energy.\n\nEven on tender, slow-burning ballads such as âForever After Allâ and âDoinâ Thisâ, Luke Combs usually transforms his hooks into storming, high-powered anthems accompanied by aggressive electric guitars.\n\nOn âFast Carâ, he relinquishes this charged, zero-to-a-hundred style in favour of a more easy-going, meandering ambience that is carried serenely through the entirety of the song.\n\nThe fact that âFast Carâ appears on Gettinâ Old - the more mature sibling to Lukeâs previous album, Growinâ Up - gives him the freedom to include these more introspective and less bar-suited odes on the project, providing listeners with a sound that leans more into the enchanting intricacy of tracks such as âBetter Togetherâ and âJoeâ.\n\nOn the tracklist, âFast Carâ follows on from the equally as vulnerable âLove You Anywayâ and âTake You With Meâ, both of which ease the listener down from the raucous high of âMy Song Will Never Dieâ and âWhere the Wild Things Areâ. âFast Carâ then leads smoothly into the sun-soaked, heartbroken hangover of âTattoo on a Sunburnâ.\n\nGettinâ Old epitomises the level of consideration that Luke Combs puts into his album structure and composition, where each track feels carefully positioned in order to keep the listener engrossed in the sonic and emotional journey the North Carolina native is taking them on.\n\nIn a record littered with stellar offerings that all contribute towards this rich, variegated tapestry, you can't help but feel as though âFast Carâ is the shimmering jewel in the crown.\n\nâYou got a fast car\n\nI want a ticket to anywhere\n\nMaybe we make a deal\n\nMaybe together we can get somewhere\n\nAny place is better\n\nStartin' from zero, got nothing to lose\n\nMaybe we'll make something\n\nMe, myself, I got nothing to proveâ\n\nLuke makes no changes to Tracy Chapman's evocative lyrics, which knit together to tell the story of a young woman who leaves her family to pursue love and the promise of a happier future.\n\nâYou got a fast car\n\nI got a plan to get us out of here\n\nI been working at the convenience store\n\nManaged to save just a little bit of money\n\nWon't have to drive too far\n\nJust across the border and into the city\n\nYou and I can both get jobs\n\nFinally see what it means to be livingâ\n\nâFast Carâ opens with a sense of bright-eyed optimism, as the protagonist stands on the precipice of a new life filled with romance, adventure and opportunity. She quickly pinpoints her love interest - and his beat-up old car - as her ticket out of her current situation.\n\nâSee, my old man's got a problem\n\nHe lives with the bottle, that's the way it is\n\nHe says his body's too old for working\n\nHis body's too young to look like his\n\nMama went off and left him\n\nShe wanted more from life than he could give\n\nI said, âSomebody's got to take care of himâ\n\nSo I quit school and that's what I didâ\n\nIn the third verse, we learn more about why our lead character is so eager to move away and open a new chapter, as we find out that her father is fighting a long-standing battle with alcoholism.\n\nAs a result, she has been forced to put her own dreams on hold, in order to help him get his life back on-track - something that, as the song unfolds, becomes more and more of a struggle.\n\nInterestingly, the dark side of alcohol is a recurring theme throughout the rest of the album, most viscerally on âJoeâ, which explores the newfound freedom of a man who has given up drinking.\n\nIt represents a marked shift compared to the beer-chugging fire-starters that Luke Combs has become known for, such as âBeer Never Broke My Heartâ and â1, 2 Manyâ, and again symbolises the overall impetus of maturity that underpins Gettinâ Old.\n\nâYou got a fast car\n\nIs it fast enough so we can fly away?\n\nStill gotta make a decision\n\nLeave tonight, or live and die this way\n\nSo, I remember when we were driving, driving in your car\n\nSpeed so fast, I felt like I was drunk\n\nCity lights lay out before us\n\nAnd your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder\n\nAnd I, I, had a feeling that I belonged\n\nI, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someoneâ\n\nâFast Carâ hits its uplifting climax when we join the two lovers coasting happily away from their past lives, with the tantalising dawn of a fresh start serving as the only fuel keeping them going, as their previous misery fades slowly away in the rear-view mirror.\n\nâYou got a fast car\n\nWe go cruisin', entertain ourselves\n\nYou still ain't got a job\n\nSo I work in a market as a checkout girl\n\nI know things will get better\n\nYou'll find work and I'll get promoted\n\nWe'll move out of the shelter\n\nBuy a bigger house, live in the suburbsâ\n\nHere, we encounter the first subtle signs of trouble, as we learn that our protagonist's partner âstill ain't got a jobâ. Nonetheless, she remains hopeful that things will ultimately work out for the best.\n\nIn his effort to keep his rendition as close to the original as possible, this verse brings us the amusing and charming moment where Luke Combs, in his deep, burly baritone, sings the now-immortal line, âSo I work in the market as a checkout girlâ.\n\nâYou got a fast car\n\nI got a job that pays all our bills\n\nYou stay out drinking late at the bar\n\nSee more of your friends than you do of your kids\n\nI'd always hoped for better\n\nThought maybe together you and me would find it\n\nI got no plans, I ain't going nowhere\n\nSo take your fast car and keep on drivingâ\n\nAs âFast Carâ reaches its conclusion, the song is tinted by a strong sense of melancholy, as our protagonist finds herself in a similar situation to how she began the song - stuck in an unbalanced, loveless household, where she is the only one keeping them afloat.\n\nThe song ends up by flipping the original cri-de-coeur, as she tells her partner to âtake your fast car and keep on drivingâ.\n\nIn a number of interviews, Luke Combs has stressed just how much âFast Carâ means to him, highlighting it as his âfirst favourite song probably ever. I remember listening to that song with my dad in his truck when I was probably four years old. He had a cassette, a tape of it, and we had this old brown camper top F-150â.\n\nSpeaking to Smooth Radio, the chart-topping powerhouse outlined why he decided to record âFast Carâ, and why it has now become a staple of his live setlist, âItâs always been one of my favourites. I covered it in college, and just kind of continued to play it around the house or whatever, and did a video of it in 2020 during the whole lockdown thing. I just figured, why not? Itâs been such a big part of my life, and I just figured it would be cool to do an official version of itâ.\n\nIn a conversation with iHeartCountry, Luke again emphasised his love for âFast Carâ, âIt's always just been one of my favourite songs for my entire life, so I was really blessed to have the opportunity to record this and for the fans to be able to hear itâ.\n\nDuring his 2023 Grady Smith interview, Luke Combs revealed that âFast Carâ nearly didn't make it onto the Gettinâ Old tracklist, âJonathan [Singleton] tried to talk me into not cutting it, because he was like, âWhat's the point...why would you put it on there?ââ\n\nLuke went on to underline that he had no idea that his version of the song would become as successful as it is today, âWe didn't know, that wasn't the plan...I've tried for years, ever since I first started putting music out, to figure out what the people are going to like. What do I think is going to be everyone's favourite song? And I'm always wrongâ.\n\nDelving into the story of âFast Carâ in the same discussion, Luke mused, âShe's trying to remember these good times, she's taking care of [her father] now, obviously, and the mother's like, âI'm out, I'm not taking care of this guyâ, so she's like, âWell I have toâ...My uncle lives with my grandmother, and my grandmother's not a raging alcoholic, but she lives in his house and he watches over her and takes care of her. I imagine this scenario being a little bit [of a] younger version of that, right? In my mind, the dad is in his fifties in this song, and the kid is probably mid-20sâ.\n\nLuke Combs then concluded, âEverybody that has had - I would imagine - struggles with their parents have these core memories that they go back to of like...we did have good times, right?â\n\nâYou got a fast car\n\nI want a ticket to anywhere\n\nMaybe we make a deal\n\nMaybe together we can get somewhere\n\nAny place is better\n\nStartin' from zero, got nothing to lose\n\nMaybe we'll make something\n\nMe, myself, I got nothing to prove\n\nYou got a fast car\n\nI got a plan to get us out of here\n\nI been working at the convenience store\n\nManaged to save just a little bit of money\n\nWon't have to drive too far\n\nJust across the border and into the city\n\nYou and I can both get jobs\n\nFinally see what it means to be living\n\nSee, my old man's got a problem\n\nHe lives with the bottle, that's the way it is\n\nHe says his body's too old for working\n\nHis body's too young to look like his\n\nMama went off and left him\n\nShe wanted more from life than he could give\n\nI said, \"Somebody's got to take care of him\"\n\nSo I quit school and that's what I did\n\nYou got a fast car\n\nIs it fast enough so we can fly away?\n\nStill gotta make a decision\n\nLeave tonight, or live and die this way\n\nSo, I remember when we were driving, driving in your car\n\nSpeed so fast, I felt like I was drunk\n\nCity lights lay out before us\n\nAnd your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder\n\nAnd I, I, had a feeling that I belonged\n\nI, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone\n\nYou got a fast car\n\nWe go cruisin', entertain ourselves\n\nYou still ain't got a job\n\nSo I work in a market as a checkout girl\n\nI know things will get better\n\nYou'll find work and I'll get promoted\n\nWe'll move out of the shelter\n\nBuy a bigger house, live in the suburbs\n\nSo, I remember when we were driving, driving in your car\n\nSpeed so fast, I felt like I was drunk\n\nCity lights lay out before us\n\nAnd your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder\n\nAnd I, I, had a feeling that I belonged\n\nI, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone\n\nYou got a fast car\n\nI got a job that pays all our bills\n\nYou stay out drinking late at the bar\n\nSee more of your friends than you do of your kids\n\nI'd always hoped for better\n\nThought maybe together you and me would find it\n\nI got no plans, I ain't going nowhere\n\nSo take your fast car and keep on driving\n\nSo, I remember when we were driving, driving in your car\n\nSpeed so fast, I felt like I was drunk\n\nCity lights lay out before us\n\nAnd your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder\n\nAnd I, I, had a feeling that I belonged\n\nI, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone\n\nYou got a fast car\n\nIs it fast enough so you can fly away?\n\nYou still gotta make a decision\n\nLeave tonight, or live and die this wayâ\n\nFor more on Luke Combs, see below:"
