        "text": "30 JUNE\n\nFeatured Events\n\n2019 Taylor Swift's former label, Big Machine, is sold to Scooter Braun's company for an estimated $300 million, giving him control of her back catalog, including the master recordings. In response, Swift accuses Braun of bullying her and says she will re-record all her old albums to devalue his purchase.More\n\n2009 Spinal Tap start (and end) their One Night Only World Tour at Wembley Arena in London.\n\n2000 During a Pearl Jam concert at Denmark's Roskilde Festival, nine people are crushed to death as the crowd rushes the stage. Several people fall and can't get up, and in addition, crowdsurfers are falling into the open area. Pearl Jam stops the show and asks people to back up, but it is too late. Investigations conclude that the events were an accident, and many European venues ban crowdsurfing. The Pearl Jam song \"Love Boat Captain\" refers to the events with the line \"Lost nine friends we'll never know... two years ago today.\"\n\n1984 Bruce Springsteen's \"Dancing In The Dark\" reaches its chart peak of #2 on the Hot 100. The song spends four weeks at runner-up, held off the last three by Prince's \"When Doves Cry.\" Springsteen never does reach #1 (except as a writer: Manfred Mann's Earth Band took \"Blinded by the Light\" to #1 in 1977), but the next six singles from his Born In The U.S.A. album all hit the Top 10.\n\n1975 Cher marries Gregg Allman. Their union produces a son (Elijah Blue Allman) and an album, but ends for good in 1979.\n\n1975 The Jackson 5 announce they will be leaving Motown Records for Epic Records and changing their name to The Jacksons because Motown owns The Jackson 5 name.\n\nmore featured events"
