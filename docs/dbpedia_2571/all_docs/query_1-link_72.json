        "text": "The Holy Spirit is not just a power, He is not just a Presence; The Holy Spirit is a PERSON and He wants a specific relationship with you. If you are wanting to know the unique position of The Holy Spirit in your life, this message is for you!\n\n“What are you cuffed to?” We’ve all tried to love things that don’t love us back. In this series, God is going to expose what we are cuffed to knowingly or unknowingly, and show us how we can be cuffed to Christ!\n\nHaving a greater level of faith leads to a greater level of favor. God wants to show us something beyond our belief. If you’re looking to believe for more, this message is for you!\n\nWe all have wanted to get “there”. We’ve all wanted to escape our present circumstances and move on to what we think is better. But what if “here” is right where God wants us to be? In our new series Here Is Holy, Pastor Mike shows us how to ignore “there”, and focus on the here and now.\n\nThe promise for this series is that our THINKING changes so that we can turn to God and see, seek, speak and serve the kingdom. If you’re ready for the Rise of a Holy Rebellion, this series is for you!\n\nIn this series, Pastor Charles spoke so powerfully about the difference between Purpose and Calling. If you have ever asked questions like, “Why am I here,” “What’s next,” and “What is my purpose,” this series is for you!\n\nIn this life-changing series, Pastor Mike talks about being single–not alone, the myths of dating, keys to marriage, the container for sex, and more! If you want to improve all of the relationships in your life, this series is for you!\n\nIn this 14-week series, Pastor Mike dives even deeper into the viral series “Relationship Goals.” This is a must-watch for anyone who cares to not only transform the way they relate with others, but the way they relate with God and themselves! You’ll never be the same after this series!\n\nIn this series, Pastor Mike shows us what grace truly is and the life-changing power it holds. With messages about finding your anchor and navigating your life with the pace of grace, this series is a great place to start no matter where you are in your walk with God!\n\nMaverick City Music\n\nMaverick City started with a dream to make space for folk that would otherwise live in their own separate worlds. To break the unspoken rules that exist in the CCM and Gospel World! And now it’s the audacious sound of true belonging: The beautiful harmony of long lost family.\n\nSteffany Gretzinger\n\nEven as a young girl, Steffany housed a passion for worship with an innocent, expectant love for the Presence of God. She started writing songs as a way to process the world around her. Steffany’s heart is to minister to the Lord first, giving Him joy and adoration.\n\nUPPERROOM\n\nThe music of UPPERROOM is an offering to the Lord that establishes the church in intimacy and encounter. We believe when we encounter His presence, we are transformed and equipped to go out and impact our world.\n\nThe Bluejay House\n\nThe Bluejay House is a movement of believers carrying a heart for ministering to Jesus and cultivating His presence and revival through worship. We have a heart to see unity among various churches – it’s not about this church or that church, but about us BEING the church.\n\nThe Fasting Edge\n\nThere is nothing more powerful than fasting. Though it lasts for a short season, it brings long-term effects and blessings. This book is focused on the power of fasting to help you regain your edge when the circumstances of life deplete your spiritual energy and dull your spiritual sharpness. Best-selling author Jentezen Franklin will give us the steps to regaining our edge, which include: Make up your mind to admit it is lost; Confess that you have lost it…and more.\n\nKingdom Principles\n\nIn Kingdom Principles, the second book in his “Kingdom” series, Dr. Munroe insists that we cannot appropriate and enjoy the benefits of God’s Kingdom until we understand how it operates. Kingdom Principles helps you learn to think and act like a Kingdom resident and ruler–the person God intended you to be. Knowing these principles will infuse your life with a new sense of excitement and purpose!\n\nRelationship Goals\n\nIn Relationship Goals, Pastor Michael Todd digs deep to give you good news and real-life ideas for making the most of your most important relationships. Whether you are married, single, or it’s complicated, aiming for the right targets will make all the difference in finding true satisfaction. As it turns out, God’s got the best relationship goals of all for your life. Why settle for less?\n\nCrazy Faith\n\nIn Crazy Faith, Pastor Michael Todd shows us how to step out in faith and dive into the purposeful life of trusting God for the impossible. Even if you have to start with baby faith or maybe faith, you can become empowered to let go of your lazy faith, trust God through your hazy faith, and learn to live a lifestyle of crazy faith. God’s not looking for somebody to give Him all the reasons why His plans can’t happen. He’s looking for somebody to believe they will happen. In fact, He has so much He wants to do through you. The question is, Are you crazy enough to believe it?\n\nDamaged but not\n\nDestroyed\n\nDamaged but Not Destroyed will give you tools to identify the impact of your damage, see yourself the way God sees you, and realize that healing is all about progression, not perfection. No matter how badly you’ve messed up, and no matter the pain you’ve experienced, nothing can destroy the God-given value of your life. It’s time to turn your damage into destiny! You may be damaged, but you are not destroyed. The value is still in you.\n\nThe Blessed Life\n\nOur culture is saturated with false teaching on what it means to be blessed, but what does the Bible say about it? How can we truly live blessed lives? With humor, passion, and clarity, pastor and bestselling author Robert Morris presents the secrets of living a blessed life both financially and spiritually. He shows that when God changes your heart from selfishness to generosity, every part of your life-journey is affected.\n\nThe Ruthless Elimination of Hurry\n\nA compelling emotional and spiritual case against hurry and in favor of a slower, simpler way of life. “Hurry is the great enemy of the spiritual life.” Too often we treat the symptoms of toxicity in our modern world instead of trying to pinpoint the cause. A growing number of voices are pointing at hurry, or busyness, as a root of much evil. Within the pages of this book, you’ll find a fascinating roadmap to staying emotionally healthy and spiritually alive in the chaos of the modern world.\n\nBelong Groups are the small group ministry of Transformation Church.
