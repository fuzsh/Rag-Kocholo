Paired with an architecturally mapped light show, this performance promises a truly transcendent experience in this historic cathedral.\n\nBuy Tickets\n\nListen\n\nReflections in Suspension (30th Anniversary Remaster)\n\nAbout Artist\n\nSTEVE ROACH draws on the beauty and power of the Earth’s landscapes to create lush, meditative soundscapes. Inspired by Klaus Schulze, Popul Vuh, and Tangerine Dream, Roach’s visionary sound design has captivated listeners for decades.\n\nFirst emerging with the Berlin School-styled album Now in 1982, he came into his own with the 1984 minimalist epic Structures From Silence. Efforts such as 1988’s equally heralded Dreamtime Return were directly inspired by desert life, incorporating field recordings and rhythms inspired by indigenous music traditions. Dark ambient works such as 1996’s The Magnificent Void and 2000’s Midnight Moon reflected the vast expanse of space.\n\nDuring the 2010s, he began building an extensive modular synthesizer/sequencer system, revisiting his Berlin School roots with albums such as 2020’s album Tomorrow. Roach has maintained an impossibly prolific work rate throughout his career without sacrificing quality or craftsmanship, resulting in countless hours of truly sublime, otherworldly music.\n\nEvent Details\n\nDoors open at 7 pm.
