It worked.\n\nRehabAmy Winehouse\n\nAmy Winehouse really did refuse \"Rehab.\" She said she drank because she was lovesick, and \"you can't go into rehab for that.\"\n\nLet It GoIdina Menzel\n\nThe Frozen song \"Let It Go\" was recorded in 42 different languages for the movie's foreign releases. This earned it an entry in the 2016 Guinness World Records publication for \"Most Languages Featured on a Single.\"\n\nPrivate IdahoThe B-52s\n\nThe B-52's picked chose the location of their song \"Private Idaho\" because the state had a reputation for being wacky and mysterious. The title was a play on the phrase \"Private Eye.\"\n\nMachineheadBush\n\nAn Allen Ginsberg line from his poem Howl inspired \"Machinehead\" by Bush: \"Machine says I saw the best minds of my generation.\"\n\nVanessa CarltonSongwriter Interviews\n\nThe \"A Thousand Miles\" singer on what she thinks of her song being used in White Chicks and how she captured a song from a dream.\n\nSusanna Hoffs - \"Eternal Flame\"They're Playing My Song\n\nThe Prince-penned \"Manic Monday\" was the first song The Bangles heard coming from a car radio, but \"Eternal Flame\" is closest to Susanna's heart, perhaps because she sang it in \"various states of undress.\"\n\nMike Rutherford (Genesis, Mike + The Mechanics)Songwriter Interviews\n\nMike Rutherford talks about the \"Silent Running\" storyline and \"Land Of Confusion\" in the age of Trump.\n\nTim McIlrath of Rise AgainstSongwriter Interviews\n\nRise Against frontman Tim McIlrath explains the meanings behind some of their biggest songs and names the sci-fi books that have influenced him.\n\nDick Wagner (Alice Cooper/Lou Reed)Songwriter Interviews\n\nThe co-writer/guitarist on many Alice Cooper hits, Dick was also Lou Reed's axeman on the Rock n' Roll Animal album."
