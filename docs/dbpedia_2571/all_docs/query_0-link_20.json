The album fused diverse influences such as shoegazing,[5] dream pop,[6] and heavy metal,[5] and has been described as \"closer to progressive rock than to punk or grunge.\"[7]\n\nDespite recording sessions fraught with difficulties and tensions, Siamese Dream debuted at number ten on the Billboard charts, and eventually sold over four million copies in the US, and over six million worldwide,[8] cementing The Smashing Pumpkins as an important group in alternative rock music. Four singles were released in support of Siamese Dream: \"Cherub Rock\", \"Today\", \"Disarm\", and \"Rocket\". In addition to receiving widespread critical acclaim upon its release, Siamese Dream has widely been regarded as one of the best albums of the 1990s, and one of the best albums of all time.[9] Rolling Stone magazine have ranked it number 362 on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.[10][11]\n\nBackground[edit | edit source]\n\nThe band's debut album, Gish, was released on Caroline Records in 1991 to unexpected success and acclaim. After the release of Nirvana's Nevermind later that year, The Smashing Pumpkins were hyped as \"the next Nirvana\".[12] The band was signed to Caroline Records parent Virgin Records and began recording a follow-up album. Frontman Billy Corgan felt \"this great pressure to make the next album to set the world on fire\".[13] The immense pressure to succeed intensified an already problematic situation: drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was undergoing an increasingly severe addiction to heroin, guitarist James Iha and bassist D'arcy Wretzky had recently ended a romantic relationship and Corgan, aside from battles with weight gain and suicidal depression,[14] was suffering from his worst-ever bout of writer's block.[15]\n\nRecording and production[edit | edit source]\n\nSiamese Dream was recorded mainly between December 1992 and March 1993. The band relocated to Triclops Studios in Marietta, Georgia for the album sessions, so they could avoid local friends and distractions,[16] and to cut Chamberlin off from his known drug connections.[17] Butch Vig reprised his role as producer after working on their debut album Gish. According to an interview with Daniel Gumble, writing for PSN Europe, Butch Vig stated \"Billy [Corgan] and I raised the bar really high. We wanted to make a very ambitious sounding record. It was all done on analogue tape so it was time consuming. We were working 12 hours a day, six times a week for about three months, and for the last two months we worked seven days a week, 14 or 15 hours a day because we were behind schedule.\"[18]\n\nAfter he suffered a nervous breakdown, Corgan began visiting a therapist. Consequently, his lyrics became more explicit about his troubled past and his insecurities.[16] Lyrically, \"Today\" was among the first songs written by Corgan for Siamese Dream.[15] He played the self-recorded demo to Vig, and received a positive reaction.[15] Soon afterward, executives from Virgin Records came to observe the band after hearing about their problems, but were pleased with the demo and did not soon return to the studio.[15] The reaction from the executives only served to put more stress on Corgan.[12] Corgan worked overtime, practically living in the studio for the recording of Siamese Dream—he and Vig would sometimes work on a 45-second section of music for two days, working 16-hour days for weeks at a time to achieve the sound Corgan wanted.[17]\n\nCorgan's desire for musical perfection put further strain on the already-frayed relationships between the band members. Vig later recalled, \"D'arcy would lock herself in the bathroom, James wouldn't say anything, or Billy would lock himself in the control room\". Corgan often overdubbed Iha's and Wretzky's parts with his own playing.[16] Wretzky stated that Corgan only performed most of the guitar and bass parts because he could lay them down more easily in recording and with far fewer takes.[17] Stories of the album's recording had circulated in the music press. Corgan admitted there was some truth to accusations of tyrannical behavior, though he felt the press misunderstood the situation.[19]\n\nWhile Chamberlin performed all drum parts on the album, he would disappear for days on drug benders that caused everyone to fear for his life. After one incident where the drummer had disappeared for two or three days, Corgan \"put the hammer down\", according to Vig, and had Chamberlin perform the drum part for \"Cherub Rock\" until his hands bled.[16] Due to Corgan's urging, Chamberlin checked into a rehab clinic.[17] Corgan told Spin later that year, \"You know, I gave them a year and a half to prepare for this record... I'm surrounded by these people who I care about very much, yet they continue to keep failing me.\" Corgan explained that he began to take the actions of others personally; he said, \"If you really think about it, of course, someone doesn't do the job because they're lazy, or they don't think it's important. But I took it as, 'You're not worth going home and working on the song.'\"[20]\n\nMeanwhile, Corgan was also going through his own problems. He would admit in 2011 that throughout the recording process he had been planning his own suicide. Stating that he had gotten rid of most of his things and was \"fantasizing about my own death, I started thinking what my funeral would be like and what music would be played.\"[21]\n\nVirgin began to grow impatient with the album's recording as it went over budget and became behind schedule. The band, however, would not let the company cut corners if it meant compromising the sound.[17] By the time recording was completed, Corgan and Vig felt too emotionally exhausted to mix the record. Corgan suggested that engineer Alan Moulder mix the album, due to his work on Loveless by My Bloody Valentine.[22] Moulder booked two weeks in a studio to mix the album; the mix ended up taking 36 days to complete.[23] Eventually, the album was finished after four months and $250,000 over budget.[17]\n\nMusic[edit | edit source]\n\nThe album boasts relatively high production values and ornate arrangements compared to other early-1990s alternative albums. Vig said, \"Billy wanted to make a record that people would put on and say, 'What the fuck was that?' [...] We wanted to have things going on in the left ear and right ear all the time\".[16] One of Corgan's main goals was to create a sense of sonic depth, but, as Corgan said, \"without necessarily using delays or reverbs—to use tonalities instead.\"[24] For the album, the guitars were layered multiple times. Corgan has stated that \"Soma\" alone contains up to 40 overdubbed guitar parts.[25] Vig stated that as many as 100 guitar parts were compressed into a single song.[16] Rolling Stone noted that the album was \"closer to progressive rock than to punk or grunge.\"[7]\n\nThe subjects of Corgan's lyrics on Siamese Dream varied. Corgan noted that most of his lyrics for the album were about his girlfriend and future ex-wife Chris Fabian, with whom he had briefly broken up at the time he wrote the songs.[24] Corgan occasionally wrote about other subjects. In \"Cherub Rock\", the album's opening track, Corgan attacked the American music industry,[26] and \"Today\" is about a day that he was experiencing depression and suicidal thoughts.[14] \"Spaceboy\" was written as a tribute to his autistic half-brother, Jesse Andersen.[27]\n\nArtwork and packaging[edit | edit source]\n\nThe artwork for the album was initially going to be created by an outsider artist, but after a series of disagreements with the label, Corgan was forced to step in at the last minute.[28] The album booklet, composed of old photographs of both strangers and Corgan's family members with lyrics handwritten on top, was assembled by Corgan and his wife the day after their wedding.[28] Corgan was not satisfied with the results.[28] The first pressing of the CD contained a 20-page booklet, with a separate page devoted to each song's lyrics and accompanying photograph; later pressings contained a four-panel fold-out liner with thumbnails of each picture. In 1999, Virgin Records reissued the album with the original 20-page booklet.[29]\n\nThe artwork on the compact disc itself is the original \"Gemini\" logo of Virgin Records[30] and was used on many Virgin releases, such as Lenny Kravitz' Are You Gonna Go My Way.[31] Coincidentally it depicts Siamese twins,[30] and Siamese Dream was the only Smashing Pumpkins release for which Virgin used the artwork.\n\nShortly after the Pumpkins reformed in 2007, Corgan posted a message to the band's blog saying that they were \"[l]ooking for girls from Siamese Dream album cover... As you all know, they were quite young when the photo was taken. They are not conjoined anymore, as far as we know.\" The band's intentions for the search were never made clear.[32] In February 2011, Billy Corgan announced via Twitter that not only had one of the girls been found, she was the current bassist for the Pumpkins, Nicole Fiorentino. According to Corgan, \"Just found out the weirdest news: our bass player Nicole just admitted she is one of the girls on the cover of Siamese Dream.\"[33] However, according to the assistant photographer for Siamese Dream, the cover photo was probably shot specifically for the album. Given Fiorentino's age at the time of the album, this would make her too old to be on the cover of the album.[34] It was later confirmed that the information was false, and both girls were located in 2008.[35][36] In promotion of the 2018 Shiny and Oh So Bright tour, the two girls reunited for a photo and video op, using a flame thrower to ignite the classic SP heart logo.[37] Corgan thanked the girls on Instragram, writing \"we adore you [Ali and LySandra], and having you be a part of today's launch brings tears to my eyes. For life goes fast, and I can still see you in my mind's eye wearing crisp white dresses in a stranger's backyard, looking like little Mother Mary's, smiling and laughing into the sun.\"[38]\n\nThe album was also released as a shaped wooden box set (aka Siamese Dream Collectors Edition) with metal hinges, limited to only 1,000 copies and containing the UK HUT CD album housed in a recess with individually numbered silver metal embossed plate at the side and a 20-page booklet housed in a similar recess in the lid. Though the CD itself and the booklet are official and genuine, the wooden box is not an official Virgin (US) or HUT (UK) release.[39]\n\nWilliam Corgan Sr. is credited as an illustrator for the 2011 reissue of Siamese Dream.[40]\n\nRelease, reception and legacy[edit | edit source]\n\nProfessional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingAllMusic[1]Chicago Tribune[41]Encyclopedia of Popular Music[42]Entertainment WeeklyB[43]NME8/10[44]Pitchfork10/10[45]Q[46]Rolling Stone[47]The Rolling Stone Album Guide[48]Select5/5[49]\n\nIn early July, a promotional release of Siamese Dream released, with \"Cherub Rock\", \"Today\", \"Disarm\" and \"Spaceboy\". On July 27, 1993, the full album hit shelves, debuting at number ten on the Billboard 200 the following week.[50] The album was almost universally lauded by music critics. Select's Andrew Perry praised it as \"the most grand-scale, expansively-passionate blasts of music you'll hear this year\" and remarked that it would be \"hard for anyone to top this one\".[49] John Harris of NME wrote that Siamese Dream, \"for all its air of non-committal blankness and exercise-book psychoanalysis, is a startling, deeply satisfying record\".[44] Steve Hochman of the Los Angeles Times predicted that \"the scale of its success will likely be tied to how many fans are willing to stop moshing and enter into some rather contemplative, even tender territory\", and wrote that \"the songs tend to drift in places, and some get a bit long-winded, but the overall balance between the harsh and the sweet makes for a strong and distinctive package\".[51] Lorraine Ali of Rolling Stone called the album \"a strong, multidimensional extension of Gish that confirms that Smashing Pumpkins are neither sellouts nor one-offs.\"[47]\n\nEntertainment Weekly critic David Browne praised the band for living up to industry expectations of being the \"next Nirvana\" and compared Siamese Dream favorably to Nirvana's Nevermind, concluding: \"In aiming for more than just another alternative guitar record, Smashing Pumpkins may have stumbled upon a whole new stance: slackers with a vision.\"[43] Critic Simon Reynolds disagreed; he wrote in his review for The New York Times that \"fuzzed-up riffs and angst-wracked vocals are quite the norm these days, and Smashing Pumpkins lacks the zeitgeist-defining edge that made Nirvana's breakthrough so thrilling and resonant.\"[52] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice cited \"Geek U.S.A.\" and \"Today\" as highlights while noting the record's strength is \"the sonics\";[53] he later rated the album with a three-star honorable mention.[54] Siamese Dream earned The Smashing Pumpkins their first Grammy Award nominations. The album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Performance, and the group was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocal at the 36th Annual Grammy Awards.[55]\n\nSiamese Dream continues to receive critical praise and has been frequently included in lists of the best albums of the 1990s—the Alternative Press ranked it fourth,[56] Pitchfork ranked it 18th,[57] and Spin ranked it 23rd.[13] In 2003, the album was ranked number 360 on Rolling Stone's list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list.[11][58] In a retrospective review of the album, Greg Prato of AllMusic called Siamese Dream \"one of the finest alt-rock albums of all time\" and remarked that it \"stands alongside Nevermind and Superunknown as one of the decade's finest (and most influential) rock albums.\"[1] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote that it \"became a soundtrack for a significant portion of [Corgan's] generation\" and \"did so by tempering some of the first album's extremes; sticky melodies and pretty production can make almost anything radio-friendly, even a desperately sad song like 'Today.'\"[41] In a review for Pitchfork, Ned Raggett remarked that while initial reviews of the album singled out Corgan's lyrics for criticism, they were actually \"exactly what made the band click even further\", commending Corgan's \"ear for hooks, metaphors, and deft summaries.\"[45] The deluxe edition of the album holds a score of 96 out of 100 on review aggregate site Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[59] In April 2019, Rolling Stone ranked Siamese Dream as the twelfth greatest Grunge album of all time.[60]\n\nTrack listing[edit | edit source]\n\nAll tracks are written by Billy Corgan, except where noted.\n\nOriginal releaseNo.TitleWriter(s)Length1.\"Cherub Rock\"4:582.\"Quiet\"3:413.\"Today\"3:194.\"Hummer\"6:575.\"Rocket\"4:066.\"Disarm\"3:177.\"Soma\"Corgan, James Iha6:398.\"Geek U.S.A.\"5:139.\"Mayonaise\"Corgan, Iha5:5010.\"Spaceboy\"4:2811.\"Silverfuck\"8:4312.\"Sweet Sweet\"1:3813.\"Luna\"3:20\n\nJapanese edition bonus trackNo.TitleLength14.\"Pissant\" (labelled as \"Hikari Express\")2:31\n\nReissue bonus material[edit | edit source]\n\n2011 reissue bonus CD – Lollipop Fun TimeNo.TitleWriter(s)RecordedLength1.\"Pissant\" (Rough Mix)Spring 19932:322.\"Siamese Dream\" (Broadway Rehearsal Demo)19926:183.\"STP\" (Rehearsal Demo)19913:284.\"Frail and Bedazzled\" (Soundworks Demo)Spring 19923:425.\"Luna\" (Apartment Demo)19913:126.\"Quiet\" (BBC Session/Billy Corgan Mix)12 September 19933:367.\"Moleasskiss\" (Soundworks Demo)Spring 19923:598.\"Hello Kitty Kat\" (Soundworks Demo)Spring 19926:149.\"Today\" (Broadway Rehearsal Demo)19923:2110.\"Never Let Me Down Again\" (BBC Session)Martin Gore12 September 19934:0311.\"Apathy's Last Kiss\" (Siamese Sessions Rough Mix)Spring 19932:4012.\"Ache\" (Silverfuck Rehearsal Demo)19916:5713.\"U.S.A.\" (Soundworks Demo)Spring 19924:2514.\"U.S.S.R.\" (Soundworks Demo)Spring 19921:3515.\"Spaceboy\" (Acoustic Mix)December 1992 – March 19933:5716.\"Rocket\" (Rehearsal Demo)19914:5517.\"Disarm\" (Acoustic Mix)December 1992 – March 19933:1818.\"Soma\" (Instrumental Mix)Billy Corgan, James IhaDecember 1992 – March 19936:38Total length:74:39\n\n2011 reissue bonus DVD – Live at the Metro (Live on August 14, 1993)No.TitleWriter(s)Length1.\"Intro by Joe Shanahan\"0:482.\"Rocket\"4:193.\"Quiet\"3:394.\"Today\"3:395.\"Rhinoceros\"5:066.\"Geek U.S.A.\"5:217.\"Soma\"Billy Corgan, James Iha7:218.\"I Am One\"Billy Corgan, James Iha4:479.\"Disarm\"3:5510.\"Spaceboy\"4:4811.\"Starla\"9:2512.\"Cherub Rock\"5:0113.\"Bury Me\"4:2814.\"Hummer\"8:4215.\"Siva\"8:3516.\"Mayonaise\"Billy Corgan, James Iha10:2917.\"Drown\"8:2418.\"Silverfuck\"13:3019.\"credits\"1:12Total length:113:23\n\nRelease history[edit | edit source]\n\nReleased Label Catalog ID Format Country External sites July 26, 1993 Hut Recordings HUTLP 11 • 0170 4 65010 1 9 2 LP UK [1] July 26, 1993 Hut Recordings CDHUT 11 • 0170 4 65010 2 6 CD UK [1] July 26, 1993 Hut Recordings HUTCS 11 Cassette UK [1] July 27, 1993 Virgin 0777 7 88267 2 9 CD US [1] July 27, 1993 Virgin 0777 7 88267 4 3 Cassette US [1] July 27, 1993 Caroline • Virgin CAROL 1740 1 • 0170 4 61740 1 5 2 LP US [1] August 25, 1993 Virgin VJCP-28179 CD Japan [1][2] November 29, 2011 Virgin 50999 67928 9 27 2 CD • DVD US [1][3][4]\n\nPersonnel[edit | edit source]\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins\n\nBilly Corgan – lead vocals, guitars, bass guitar, Mellotron on \"Spaceboy\", string arrangements, production, mixing\n\nJames Iha – guitars, backing vocals\n\nD'arcy Wretzky – bass guitar, backing vocals\n\nJimmy Chamberlin – drums\n\nAdditional personnel\n\nMike Mills – piano on \"Soma\"\n\nEric Remschneider – string arrangements and cello on \"Disarm\" and \"Luna\"\n\nDavid Ragsdale – string arrangements and violin on \"Disarm\" and \"Luna\"\n\nTechnical staff\n\nButch Vig – production, engineering, mixing, string arrangements\n\nJeff Tomei – engineering\n\nTim Holbrook – special technical engineering\n\nAlan Moulder – mixing\n\nHowie Weinberg – mastering\n\nLen Peltier – sleeve art direction\n\nSteve J.
