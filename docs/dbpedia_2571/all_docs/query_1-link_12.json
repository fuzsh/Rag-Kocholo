Still Water\n\nNorwegian Progressive Metal masters Rendezvous Point return with their highly anticipated third full-length album “Dream Chaser”. Following the footsteps from their critically acclaimed sophomore album “Universal Chaos”, the 5-piece around Leprous drummer Baard Kolstad, keyboardist Nicolay Tangen Svennæs (Ihsahn, Bernhoft, Emilie Nicolas), singer Geirmund Hansen, guitarist Petter Hallaråker and bass player Gunn-Hilde Erstad continues to push boundaries with more concise songwriting and a wider focus on groove, riffs, melodies and hooks.\r\n“Dream Chaser” delves deep into the realm of artistic exploration, focusing on the relentless pursuit of perfection. “Artists often strive a whole lifetime searching for something abstract, a feeling of perfection in what you do or create. Since it’s an abstract and subjective thing, the artists‘ search for perfection often results in a lifetime of always wanting more, better, bigger and deeper. This leads to chasing something unclear and un-touchable, like a dream. It seems real and reachable, but never is,“ comment the band. \r\nWith themes ranging from societal disillusionment to personal growth, “Dream Chaser” is offering a compelling glimpse into the human experience. Rendezvous Point invites listeners to join them on their journey exploring the complexities of modern existence and the depths of emotional turmoil.",

        "text": "1.\n\nDon’t Look Up 04:29\n\nThere's a time Time to self-evaluate the things we've done We have time Time to make things right and to get up again Warning signs Screaming out the fact that we're the ones to blame Draw the line Listen to the voices deep inside your brain When the trees fall Will you come for me I suggest you look out for yourself You can scream all you want but No one's listening anyway There's no facts Everyone's entitled to a breakaway When the trees fall Will you call For someone to come I suggest you look out for yourself There's a fire raging storm Building larger than life Don't look up you might understand why When the trees fall Will you call For someone to come I suggest you look out for yourself There's a fire raging storm Building larger than life Don't look up then you might understand Why the trees fall Why we call for someone to come Will you come\n\n2.\n\nOslo Syndrome 03:21\n\nLike a drug Slowly you take control of me No apology On the rug With my hands tied behind my back My eyes go black Every time I talk Anywhere I walk I cannot go on without your spark Remembering the time you told me I was unbeatable How can I repay Can I make you stay Don't you know I'm wounded like a prey You can cut me open cause you're so unbelievable Then you're gone You made sure that you made a scar Tell me where you are I am done Cause I feel like you are using me Can I be free Every time I talk Anywhere I walk I cannot go on without your spark Remembering the time you told me I was unbeatable How can I repay Can I make you stay Don't you know I'm wounded like a prey You can cut me open cause you're so unbelievable For all the times You gave me what I wanted A taste of something beautiful And now I want it more For all the ones That told me you were danger They never saw your power, How you struck me to my core Every time I talk Anywhere I walk I cannot go on without your spark Remembering the time you told me I was unbeatable How can I repay Can I make you stay Don't you know I'm wounded like a prey You can cut me open cause you're so unbelievable\n\n3.\n\nUtopia 03:53\n\nAll of this time I Dreamt of being just like you When I'm in a haze I feel I have the perfect view I know I wouldn't feel better if I didn't see through your eyes Wouldn't be stronger if I didn't feel all the lows and the highs Stand in your shoes and flip my middle finger the whole world collide This is just dystopia I'm still stuck here on my own When will I come Closer to the Dream I had Where do I go if I'll escape dystopia And to find Utopia Now I know I would feel better if I didn't see through your eyes I would feel better if I didn't feel all the lows and the highs Stand in your shoes and the whole world collides in blink of an eye This is the place I am at I won't change I'll stand my ground till the ground disappears When will I come Closer to the Dream I had Where do I go if I'll escape dystopia And to find Utopia\n\n4.\n\nFireflies 06:06\n\nShe's staring up again Once more her dream has gone from being vital To be side of What people tell her that Not what she wants but what She's supposed to What she's meant to do We're holding hands again While I am figuring out How to soothe her How to move her Like fireflies she lights up the sky For all the rest to follow The only way she won't fall astray She's dancing with her daughter Time flies While sky fall Fireflies Illuminate and die The stronger gender game Come near they'll throw the flame Where it hurts you They will come through My words were loud and clear It's all for you my dear You can conquer You're the one here I know the world she's in They dominate and try to keep a hold of Every part of her truth Like fireflies she lights up the sky For all the rest to follow The only way she won't fall astray She's dancing with her daughter How can I look her in the eyes And tell her that it's all a lie Just to give her all the rights that we have She is stronger than the ones Running round with all the guns Ruining a perfect world\n\n5.\n\nPresence 04:40\n\nI'm here to feel Made for something bigger I'm kept in shades Waiting for the trigger All I feel is starvation Oh all I ever was All I am bound to be Someone you will be proud of I can't talk, I can't walk, I can't move, I can't soothe you I can't talk, I can't walk, I can't move, I won't soothe you This very moment when I feel alive Feels like a life and makes it all worthwhile It's hard to see Everyone is changing It's late at night Inside I am raging All I feel is starvation Now's the time for salvation This very moment when I feel alive Feels like a life and makes it all worthwhile If you can join me in this brief vacation I'll promise you that I will last a while\n\n6.\n\nWildflower 03:59\n\nWatching you give advise and Listening to you speak Really some form of weakness Turning the other cheek So many people now Trusting in you somehow How can you be a leader We know you are weak I just wanted to let you know We think it's time to go You're done running the show Puppeteer no more So many ways to flourish So many ways to grow Why would you just demolish How can you be so low Never an honest man Catch me if you can All I want is for you to Crawl back to your shed You're on your back in the tower Counting down to your last hour Listening to all the voices in your head You thought you where someone with power How can you get any lower Listen to me we are done with all your shit Walk away in shame Or we'll take our aim You're the one to blame Fire up the flame You're on your back in the tower Counting down to your last hour Listening to all the voices in your head You thought you where someone with power How can you get any lower Listen to me we are done We'll never falter Don't you think we're walking away Stay by your alter This is your destiny\n\n7.\n\nThe Tormented 04:48\n\nHe never takes showers he's hiding away I wonder if he'll ever leave me someday The one who should watch me and make up my bed Is down in the cellar and building his shed Each year they applaud him, they carry his chair Salutes his achievements and breathing his air They don't see the struggle, he won't let them know The tormented artist will soon leave the show Now, you tell me why All that I've fought for Was for nothing Gave it a try Turned it and called for Your last dance Is there a chance You're coming home When I grow up I want to be just like him Look at the love and the praise that he gets Why does he never smile, kiss and tell stories Hidden away with his pencils and pets All that I wanted was for him to see me Treat me with dignity, love and respect I'm tired of trying to raise my own father I think that's the wrong way around last I checked Now, you tell me why All that I've fought for Was for nothing Gave it a try Turned it and called for Your last dance Is there a chance You're my tormented despair You are the one that I fear Searching the one affair that you know of You're tormented but you aren't aware Wanting perfection is ruining Your last dance This is your chance You're coming home\n\n8.\n\nStill Water
