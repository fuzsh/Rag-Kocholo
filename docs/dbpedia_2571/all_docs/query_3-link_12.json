        "text": "Excluding bootleg recordings, rock band the Grateful Dead (USA) have released 167 full-length live albums since 1969 â an incredible 150 of which have appeared since the Californian collective disbanded in 1995 due to the untimely death of singer/songwriter/guitarist Jerry Garcia (b. 1942). A host of retrospective live albums have seen the light of day since 1991, including archived concert recordings in the Dickâs Picks (1993â2005), Road Trips (2007â11) and Daveâs Picks (2012âpresent) series, plus 13 albums in the Grateful Dead Download Series that were issued exclusively on the bandâs website and on iTunes in 2005â06. Their most recent live album, Daveâs Picks: Volume 29, was released on 1 February 2019.\n\nAll 167 albums included in this record are wholly live albums that were released on vinyl, on CD or digitally. The band released many more albums that combined studio and live recordings, but these have been excluded to avoid the need for a contentious qualifying percentage for live material. No DVD releases have been included. Multi-disc releases (e.g., box sets) are featured if the entire running order is made up of live tracks.\n\nThe Grateful Dead, who were active from 1965 to 1995, were renowned for their varied set lists, and they reportedly performed in excess of 500 different songs at their concerts. The band attracted dedicated fans (known as âDeadheadsâ) who would follow them from concert to concert, often for weeks or months on end.\n\nThe Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide.\n\nMiscellaneous (72 albums): 1.
