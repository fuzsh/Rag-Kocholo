        "text": "The Jonas Brothers' whirlwind path to stardom begin when the gifted siblings were only kids: Kevin was 17, Joe was 15 and Nick was 12 when they began work on their first studio album. Since then, the musical family members have pursued success on screens, stages and world tours, earning their fame both together and apart.\n\nFrom their Disney days to their band breakup and eventual reconciliation 10 years later, the trio has endured and enjoyed a rollercoaster of a career. Take a look back at their eventful, emotional and ongoing journey that's proven their resilience as a band and strength as brothers.\n\n2005: Jonas Brothers sign with Columbia Records\n\nThe Jonas Brothers' song \"Please Be Mine\" caught the attention of Columbia Records, and they began production on their first record. As they worked on their studio album, the guys started touring with various artists and bands, opening for the likes of the Backstreet Boys, Jesse McCartney, Kelly Clarkson and The Cheetah Girls, among other music staples of the aughts.\n\nAugust 2006: Jonas Brothers release their debut album, It's About Time\n\nThe lead single off It's About Time, \"Mandy,\" was featured on an episode of Nickelodeon's Zoey 101, and their song \"Time for Me to Fly\" appeared on the soundtrack for the 2006 film Aquamarine.\n\nTo promote their first album, the Jonas Brothers embarked on the 28-date American Club Tour.\n\nFebruary 2007: Jonas Brothers sign with Hollywood Records\n\nColumbia Records dropped Kevin, Joe and Nick after It's About Time failed to meet their expectations, but they were soon picked up by Disney's Hollywood Records and success soon followed. The boys recorded \"Kids of the Future\" (sampling Kim Wilde's \"Kids in America\") for the Meet the Robinsons soundtracks, and they put their own spins on classic Disney songs for two Disneymania cover albums.\n\nAugust 2007: Jonas Brothers release their self-titled sophomore album\n\nJonas Brothers debuted at No. 5 on the US Billboard 200 chart. Their song, \"Year 3000,\" which they originally recorded for It's About Time with Columbia Records, was repurposed as the album's lead single. The second and third songs, \"Hold On\" and \"S.O.S.,\" got music video treatments, and their fourth single, \"When You Look Me in the Eyes,\" inspired the title of their tour.\n\nIn the months that followed the album's release, the Jonas Brothers rocked a number of high-profile stages. To wrap up 2007, they performed at the American Music Awards in November, at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and during December's Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve broadcast.\n\nThe trio also made their TV debut on Disney Channel's Hannah Montana, portraying themselves in an episode titled \"Me and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas\".\n\nJanuary 2008: When You Look Me in the Eyes Tour\n\nWhile on the When You Look Me in the Eyes tour, which lasted for 39 dates, the Jonas Brothers filmed a documentary miniseries for Disney Channel entitled Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream.\n\nThe band took their album on tour just a few months later in the summer. The Burning Up Tour featured guests including Demi Lovato, Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus and Avril Lavigne.\n\nJune 2008: Jonas Brothers make their movie debut in Camp Rock\n\nIn the Disney Channel Original Movie, the Jonas Brothers played a jaded band that ends up at the same musical summer camp as Demi Lovato's character, Mitchie. Joe starred as Shane Gray, the lead singer of the fictional group Connect 3, while Nick and Kevin played his bandmates Nate and Jason.\n\nCamp Rock holds the record for third-most viewed Disney Channel TV film premiere, behind High School Musical 2 and Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie, which stole second place from Camp Rock in 2009.\n\nJuly 2008: Jonas Brothers are featured on the cover of Rolling Stone\n\nWith their cover story, the Jonas Brothers became the youngest people to feature on the front of the magazine's US edition.\n\nAugust 2008: Jonas Brothers release their album A Little Bit Longer\n\nThe group's third studio album was named after a song written by Nick about his Type 1 Diabetes diagnosis at age 14.\n\nDecember 2008: Jonas Brothers are nominated for a Grammy\n\nThe Jonas Brothers lost out to Adele, who took home the award for best new artist that year.\n\nFebruary 2009: Jonas Brothers perform on Saturday Night Live\n\nThe trio performed their song \"Video Girl\" during the sketch comedy series, but they didn't return to the NBC stage for an entire decade.\n\nAhead of their comeback appearance 10 years later, the band posted a throwback clip of a young Hailey Bieber (then Baldwin) introducing them during their first appearance on Saturday Night Live. In the video, the model is accompanied by her sister and uncle, Alec Baldwin, who was hosting the episode.\n\n\"This feels like the perfect #FlashbackFriday video,\" the Jonas Brothers tweeted a month prior to their May 2019 performance. \"#VideoGirl on @nbcsnl in 2009! PS – thanks for the intro @haileybieber.\"\n\nFebruary 2009: Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience premieres\n\nThe movie, which showed in theaters, featured video recordings from their Burning Up tour and behind-the-scenes footage from their time on the road. Guest performances by Demi Lovato and Taylor Swift were also featured in the concert film.\n\nMay 2009: Jonas premieres on Disney Channel\n\nThe TV series Jonas saw the brothers playing fictional versions of themselves, though their characters shared the surname \"Lucas.\" The inspiration for their on-screen band's name, JONAS, was said to be inspired by their characters' home address on Jonas Street.\n\nDisney Channel produced two seasons of the show, renaming it Jonas L.A. for its second installment, which followed the main cast on summer vacation in Los Angeles, away from home in New Jersey.\n\nThe show also featured the boys' younger brother, Frankie Jonas, who played their little sibling on screen.\n\nJune 2009: Jonas Brothers release their album Lines, Vines and Trying Times\n\nLines, Vines and Trying Times debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart; its release was preceded by their very first world tour, starting in May 2009.\n\nAugust 2009: Jonas Brothers host the Teen Choice Awards\n\nIn addition to hosting, the Jonas Brothers performed their songs \"Much Better\" and \"World War III\" from their album Lines, Vines and Trying Times. The boys also won five of the eight Teen Choice Awards for which they were nominated in both music and acting categories.\n\nTheir little brother Frankie, the \"Bonus Jonas,\" took home the award for breakout TV comedy star thanks to his appearances in the brothers' Disney series.\n\nOctober 2009: Nick launches Nick Jonas & the Administration\n\nFans worried when Nick announced his \"side project,\" but the band was quick to reassure everyone that Nick Jonas & the Administration wasn't a diverging road for the youngest brother. PEOPLE reported that the group wrote a letter to fans before performing in Venezuela while on their world tour.\n\n\"We plan to make music together for as long as we can,\" the letter read. \"We've said from the beginning of our career as the Jonas Brothers that anything we do outside of the group is a side project because you can't break up brothers.\"\n\nNick continued: \"My brothers are my biggest supporters, and were on the phone with me everyday while I was in the studio asking how it was going, and telling me they couldn't wait to hear the record.\"\n\nTo conclude their note, the trio waxed poetic about their solid bond. \"A three-chord strand is not easily broken, and one thing's for sure… this three chord strand is stronger now than it's ever been,\" the Jonas Brothers wrote to their supporters. \"You are truly the best fans in the world, and we love you with all our hearts.\"\n\nDecember 2009: Kevin marries Danielle Deleasa\n\nIn 2007, the eldest Jonas brother met then-hairstylist Danielle Deleasa while the two were in The Bahamas on vacation with their respective families. After dating for two years, Kevin popped the question. The two married in Long Island, New York, with an elaborate wedding inside a castle.\n\nSeptember 2010: Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam premieres on Disney Channel\n\nThe Disney Channel Original Movie's sequel saw the Jonas Brothers and Demi Lovato back in their same roles as campers attending the summer music program.\n\nSeptember 2011: Nick Jonas & the Administration goes on tour\n\nAfter Nick Jonas & the Administration released their first album, Who I Am, in February 2010, Nick's \"side project\" flourished into a tour, marking the first time the musician hit the road without his older brothers.\n\nThe milestone moment initiated a period of hiatus for the Jonas Brothers, during which the three bandmates focused on their solo careers. The break also saw the group split from Hollywood Records in 2012.\n\nOctober 2011: Joe releases his solo album, Fastlife\n\nDuring the Jonas Brothers' time apart, Joe released his first and only solo album. In producing Fastlife, the second-oldest Jonas sibling collaborated with fellow artists like Chris Brown and Lil Wayne.\n\nAugust 2012: Kevin and Danielle star on Married to Jonas\n\nThe couple's reality show followed their day-to-day lives at home in New Jersey. Married to Jonas ran for two seasons on E! until it wrapped in May 2013.\n\nOctober 2012: Jonas Brothers reunite for another world tour\n\nThe boys brought the band back together after two years spent on their own projects. They embarked on the global tour intending to promote their next album, which was meant to release in 2013.\n\nApril 2013: Jonas Brothers release \"Pom Poms\"\n\nAfter finishing their world tour in March, the Jonas Brothers officially released the lead single off their next record, titled V. The song \"Pom Poms\" was brought to life with a music video aired on E!\n\nThey followed up the upbeat tune with V's second single, \"First Time,\" which came out in June 2013.\n\nJune 2013: Jonas Brothers begin another tour\n\nThe Jonas Brothers' ninth tour was intended to run from June to December. However, at the beginning of October, the band canceled their remaining dates due to a \"deep rift within the band,\" as a spokesperson for the group told PEOPLE at the time.\n\nAnother source elaborated on the stars' creative differences, telling PEOPLE that they were \"not getting along at all.\"\n\nThe insider continued: \"They are each looking into solo projects. Nick and the Administration are working on another album. They are moving forward away from the Jonas Brothers. I think this is the beginning of the end.\"\n\nOctober 2013: Jonas Brothers confirm their split\n\nNot long after things started to appear rocky, the boys themselves validated suspicions about their drifting apart. PEOPLE reported all three members were officially calling it quits.\n\nKevin called it \"over for now,\" and Joe claimed the decision was \"unanimous.\" Nick, on the other hand, shared some insight into his reasoning behind the split.\n\n\"I was feeling kind of trapped,\" he said. \"I needed to share my heart with my brothers.\"\n\nIn 2019, Nick reflected on their difficult split during an interview with Z100.\n\n\"When it ended it was not good,\" the youngest Jonas Brother said. \"It was a couple years of rebuilding our family, and in our mind it seemed impossible for us to do this ever again.\"\n\nThe band broke up for five years, and each brother pursued their own projects during this time.\n\n2013-2018: Kevin steps outside the music industry and grows his family\n\nKevin followed a couple of entrepreneurial pursuits after the brothers parted, dipping his toes into worlds beyond music and performing. He co-created a company called The Blu Market, which provided social media influencers with strategic support. Kevin invested in the tech world as well, helping to create the restaurant-finding app Yood! and becoming a partner of social media app We Heart It.\n\nThe oldest Jo Bro didn't completely stray from entertainment, though. In 2014, Kevin made a cameo on The Real Housewives of New Jersey working as Kathy Wakile's home contractor. He also competed on season 7 of Celebrity Apprentice, albeit briefly, since he was kicked off after the second episode.\n\nDuring his hiatus from the band, Kevin and his wife Danielle welcomed their two daughters, Alena Rose and Valentina Angelina, in February 2014 and October 2016, respectively.\n\n2013-2018: Joe forms DNCE and gets engaged\n\nFor his new project, Joe formed a group called DNCE. The funk-pop ensemble released their hit single \"Cake by the Ocean\" in September 2015 and their debut EP, Swaay, was released in October 2015. The following autumn, DNCE released a self-titled album, and they followed with another EP, People to People, in June 2018.\n\nJoe took his musical talents to television as well, becoming a judge on season 7 of the Australian version of The Voice in 2018.\n\nThe singer began his own love story on Instagram, with a direct message sent to Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner. PEOPLE confirmed that their flirtation leveled up to a full-fledged romance in December 2016, and they were engaged in October of the following year.\n\nFast forward to May 2019, when the two tied the knot. They eloped in Las Vegas, and then celebrated again with a second ceremony in France a few months later, in July. Joe become a dad in 2020, when he and his wife welcomed their daughter Willa. Two years later, the couple's second little girl arrived.\n\n2013-2018: Nick pursues acting and his solo music career and gets married\n\nThe band's youngest member expanded into on big and small screens as an actor. He made cameos on Hawaii Five-O, starred in all three seasons of the drama series Kingdom and held a recurring role on season 1 of Ryan Murphy's Scream Queens. Nick also featured alongside James Franco in the 2016 film Goat, and the singer voiced Lou in the 2019 animated film UglyDolls.\n\nNick's solo career blossomed in the years following the Jonas Brothers' split. He released a self-titled album in 2014 that boasted several chart-topping hits like \"Chains,\" \"Jealous\" and \"Levels.\" His third album, Last Year Was Complicated, came out in 2016, and Nick had a prolific 2017 with major song releases. His song \"Home\" from the Ferdinand soundtrack was even nominated for a Golden Globe award.\n\nNick's notable non-solo project: pairing up with his wife, Priyanka Chopra. The two lit a flame in 2016 with friendly texts and debuted as a duo at the 2017 Met Gala. By the summer of 2018, they were engaged, and they were married in two extravagant ceremonies that incorporated their Hindu and Christian backgrounds and traditions.\n\nIn January 2022, the couple welcomed their daughter, Malti Marie, via surrogate.\n\nFebruary 2019: Jonas Brothers announce their comeback\n\nPEOPLE confirmed the rumors of their reunion in February 2019, when a source shared that the boys were spotted planning their official announcement over breakfast.\n\nQuestions about the group's return started to pop up a full year before anything was confirmed, when the band's official Instagram account was reactivated. But it was all just buzz until the famed trio spilled all on James Corden's Late Late Show in the winter of 2019.\n\nMarch 2019: Jonas Brothers release \"Sucker\"\n\n\"Sucker\" was the first single released by the grown-up iteration of the Jonas Brothers. The hit track debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. It even came along with a fun, elaborate music video featuring the brothers' significant others, the \"J Sisters,\" as they were dubbed.\n\nThey followed the pop hit with \"Cool\" a month later.\n\nJune 2019: Jonas Brothers release their comeback album, Happiness Begins\n\nMaking fans even more excited: the Jonas Brothers released an album and a documentary detailing their history as brothers and bandmates. According to Kevin, making the Amazon Prime Video film, Chasing Happiness, was part of their healing process.\n\n\"[It] was great because we had to have real conversations and not hold back,\" Kevin said, comparing the production to therapy. \"So for us, it worked out in a good way.\"\n\nThe long-awaited album, Happiness Begins, came out just three days after the film, debuting at No. 1. That same summer, in August 2019, the Jonas Brothers took their record on tour.\n\nJanuary 2020: Jonas Brothers perform at the Grammys\n\n\"Sucker\" earned a song of the year nomination at the 2020 Grammy Awards, and the Jonas Brothers debuted their new single \"What a Man Gotta Do\" at the ceremony.\n\nAugust 2021: The Remember This Tour\n\nOver a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, the Jonas Brothers returned to stages around the United States on their Remember This tour. They even produced a docuseries called Moments Between the Moments to give fans an intimate, behind-the-scenes look at their lives as they performed around the country.\n\nNovember 2021: Jonas Brothers get roasted on Netflix\n\nThe streaming platform tested the bandmates' senses of humor in The Jonas Brothers Family Roast. The Netflix special featured burns and no-holds-barred jests from their wives, friends and comedians ready to poke fun at the siblings.\n\nJune 2022: Jonas Brothers perform a residency in Las Vegas\n\nAfter their initial Sin City plans were thwarted by coronavirus, the Jonas Brothers followed through on their five-night Las Vegas residency in June 2022.\n\nJanuary 2023: Jonas Brothers announce their new album and receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\n\nThe Jonas Brothers were bestowed with the ultimate A-list honor in late January 2023, when they received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in front of their friends and family. Even in their moment of glory, however, the group gave back to their devoted supporters with an exciting announcement.\n\n\"It's nice to reflect on this nearly 20-year journey and to commemorate it here today but we're looking towards the future,\" said Nick. He and his brothers proceeded to share their latest project: an upcoming record titled The Album.\n\nMarch 2023: Jonas Brothers stage a residency on Broadway\n\nFrom March 14 through March 18, the Jonas Brothers will be giving five unique performances on Broadway. Their N.Y.C. residency will see the trio playing music from five of their albums on separate nights.\n\nFirst up will be a set list from their self-titled album circa 2007, then 2008's A Little Bit Longer. Nights three and four will center on the 2009 track list from Lines, Vines and Trying Times and the 2019 comeback record, Happiness Begins. The finale will give a taste of their new music from The Album.\n\nMay 2023: Jonas Brothers announce tour dates and release The Album\n\nBefore their five record, The Album, dropped on May 12, the band shared some exciting news about where fans can hear old and new Jonas Brothers' songs later in 2023. Kevin, Joe and Nick announced plans to take their entire discography on tour, starting with two shows at Yankee Stadium in August.\n\nThe trio confirmed their late-summer setlist on SiriusXM's Radio Andy, sharing that plans to perform \"pretty much every song from all the albums.\" While that plans seems to promise a extra long show, the brothers feel confident that they'll be able to fit everything."
