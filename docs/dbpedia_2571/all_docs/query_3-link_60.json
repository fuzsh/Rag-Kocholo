'Titanic Rising' by Weyes Blood\n\n- Rank all-time: #354\n\n- Rank in decade: #45\n\n- Rank in year: #3\n\n- Year: 2019\n\nWhile Weyes Blood may be a name that isn't considered \"household\" as of yet, the album \"Titanic Rising\" certainly put singer-songwriter Natalie Mering ever closer. Her critically acclaimed fourth album acts as an analysis on the impact of the internet, social media, and over-connectedness when it comes to love and connection, and the inability to understand others despite a world of information at everyone's fingertips. Despite the heavy intonations of the album, in an interview with Pitchfork, Mering stated her plea that is the continuous thread featured throughout the album, \"I want to make sure everybody feels like they deserve to be alive.\"\n\n2 / 100\n\nYui Mok/PA Images // Getty Images\n\n#99. 'The King of Limbs' by Radiohead\n\n- Rank all-time: #348\n\n- Rank in decade: #44\n\n- Rank in year: #5\n\n- Year: 2011\n\nRadiohead is one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the past 25 years for its ability to evolve and experiment, but \"The King of Limbs\" divided some critics at first. PopMatters poignantly wrote there's always something more to Radiohead, and the album has gained more acceptance with age.\n\n3 / 100\n\nEd Westmacott/Photoshot // Getty Images\n\n#98. 'Chutes Too Narrow' by The Shins\n\n- Rank all-time: #346\n\n- Rank in decade: #55\n\n- Rank in year: #5\n\n- Year: 2003\n\nBefore The Shins received Natalie Portman's approval as a band to change your life, they released 2003's \"Chutes Too Narrow.\" Lead singer James Mercer was credited as showcasing a \"brave voice and ebullient delivery\" with songs about protest and ontogeny.\n\n4 / 100\n\nJim Dyson // Getty Images\n\n#97. 'Third' by Portishead\n\n- Rank all-time: #343\n\n- Rank in decade: #54\n\n- Rank in year: #4\n\n- Year: 2008\n\n\"Third,\" is the highly anticipated third album by the living legendary group Portishead, and as of 2023, its most recent—despite coming out 11 years after its last album. Considered a natural musical re-invention for the group, the album was a bit darker, far less dreamy, and a little more cynical than the band's previous album endeavors, which is probably what earned it such a high ranking among critics and fans alike.\n\n5 / 100\n\nJack Vartoogian // Getty Images\n\n#96. 'Brothers' by The Black Keys\n\n- Rank all-time: #341\n\n- Rank in decade: #43\n\n- Rank in year: #9\n\n- Year: 2010\n\nThe Black Keys broke through with \"Brothers\" in 2010, which included production by Danger Mouse. The album brought home the group's first Grammy, thanks to the upbeat rock jam \"Tighten Up.\"\n\nYou may also like: Best albums by The Rolling Stones\n\n6 / 100\n\nAndy Sheppard/Redferns // Getty Images\n\n#95. 'xx' by The xx\n\n- Rank all-time: #336\n\n- Rank in decade: #53\n\n- Rank in year: #3\n\n- Year: 2009\n\nThe debut offering by The xx was described as brilliantly realized and contains not an inch of flab across its 11 songs.
