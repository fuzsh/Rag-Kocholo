        "text": "Fugees singer and rapper Lauryn Hill has been celebrating the 25th anniversary of her album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill all summer, with special performances at high-profile festivals across the country, including Roots Picnic in Philadelphia and ESSENCE Festival in New Orleans. Soon, she'll embark on a 17-date world tour, co-headlining with Fugees on the dates that take place in the United States.\n\nReleased on Aug. 25, 1998, Miseducation was Hill's debut solo album and only one to date. Decades later, it remains a touchstone and high watermark for hip-hop and R&B, helping to redefine both genres. Hill and her opus are still influencing artists today, from Lizzo to Drake.\n\nKeep the party going with 25 facts about the album and its impact, from what the cover art was originally supposed to look like, to the current Mayor who appeared as the narrator, and the book to read for all the Miseducation tea.\n\nMiseducation Is The First Hip-Hop Record To Win Album Of The Year\n\nIn 1999, Hill became the first woman to earn five GRAMMYs in one night. Her wins included Best New Artist, Best R&B Album and Album Of The Year. (To date, she has won eight GRAMMYs and received 19 GRAMMY nominations in total.)\n\n\"This is crazy, 'cuz this is hip-hop music!\" Hill exclaimed when Whitney Houston presented her with the golden gramophone for Album Of The Year, which no other hip-hop album had done before. Outkast's Speakerboxx/The Love Below, which won in 2004, is the only other hip-hop album to win the prestigious category.\n\nThe Album Was Recorded In Bob Marley's Home\n\nBob Marley's legendary Tuff Gong Studios in Jamaica — which also happened to be his home — is the most prominent of the three places where Miseducation was recorded.\n\n\"We recorded in New York, Miami, and at Hope Road in Jamaica,\" the album's sound engineer Gordon \"Commissioner Gordon\" Williams recalled to Okayplayer in 2021. \"To be in Bob Marley's house created a landscape for magic. Stephen Marley was the one who invited us to come in. I had to organize the equipment that had to be brought to Jamaica, and we had to make sure it could work as a museum when we weren't recording.\"\n\nHill Kept Everything Raw On Purpose\n\nHill and Commissioner Gordon worked to create a sound that's deliberately raw. As she told Rolling Stone in 2008, \"I don't like to use compressors and take away my textures, because I was raised on music that was recorded before technology advanced to the place where it could be smooth.\n\n\"I wanna hear that thickness of sound,\" she continued. \"You can't get that from a computer, because a computer's too perfect. But that human element, that's what makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I love that.\"\n\nHill's Personality And Experiences Are In The Songs\n\nOn the album, Hill shares her struggles as a young Black mother who has been through turbulent relationships on songs such as \"Ex Factor\" and \"Forgive Them Father,\" an honesty that's still relatable and appreciated 25 years later.\n\n\"I think the piece as a whole communicates my personality, it is the culmination of my experiences, the sum total of what I had gone through at a certain point in my life,\" Hill said in a 2013 interview with The Guardian. \"To me it's like driving in a storm, it's hard to see where you're going. You're just praying to get out of it. But once you get out of it, you can look back and say; 'Oh man, thank god!' Give thanks, 'cos that's what I came out of. That's what the album feels like to me.\"\n\nHer Label Didn't Love Some Of The Early Versions\n\nMiseducation went through a few iterations before it was ultimately finalized for release, and her label (Ruffhouse/Columbia Records) reportedly was unimpressed with the first work that they heard.\n\n\"Lauryn and her mom took [early versions of] her album to Sony Records and they said, 'This is coffee table music. What is this s—? Coffee table music,\" Rohan Marley, the father of Hill's children, told Rolling Stone in 2008. \"She took her s— and walked outta there.\"\n\nThe Album Made Chart History In The United States\n\nMiseducation landed in the top spot on the Billboard 200 in the first week of release. The Score, Hill's 1996 album with Fugees, was also a No. 1 hit, but it didn't debut in that position. Her feat set a record for the first unaccompanied female solo rapper to debut at No. 1 on the all-genre albums chart. (To this day, she remains one of only five female rappers to achieve the feat; the other four are Foxy Brown, Eve, Nicki Minaj, and Cardi B.)\n\nIt Was An International Hit, Too\n\nLike The Score, Hill's solo album was a major success internationally. Miseducation appeared in the top 20 on pop and R&B charts all over the world, including No. 1 in Canada and Ireland, as well as on the UK R&B Albums chart.\n\n\"Doo Wop (That Thing)\" Is A Two-Time Billboard Record Breaker\n\nAs a woman solo artist, Hill set long-held records for singles with \"Doo Wop (That Thing),\" which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Rap Songs chart. Miseducation also set a record for being the first album by a woman to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.\n\nThe Album Also Set A Sales Record\n\nGuinness Book of World Records notes that the album's first-week sales of 422,624 copies set a record for female artists at the time. Though that's still an astonishing opening week figure, Hill's record was later broken by Adele when she sold 3.38 million copies of her album 25.\n\nA Book Inspired The Title…\n\nIn a 2013 interview with The Guardian, Hill cited Carter G. Woodson's 1933 book The Mis-Education of The Negro as an inspiration.\n\n\"The title of the album was meant to discuss those life lessons, those things that you don't get in any textbook, things that we go through that force us to mature,\" she said. \"Hopefully we learn. Some people get stuck. They say that what doesn't kill us makes us stronger, and these are some really powerful lessons that changed the course and direction of my life.\"\n\n…And A Book Now Examines Its Impact\n\nIn 2018, author Joan Morgan, the program director of NYU's Center for Black Visual Culture, released She Begat This: 20 Years of The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill on Atria Books. Morgan beautifully combines interviews with Black authors and activists such as dream hampton, Tarana Burke and Michaela Angela Davis with her own experience, and how they all found resonating messages within the album.\n\n\"I loved Miseducation, at least as much as the nineteen million or so folks who've bought it since 1998,\" she wrote. \"I'd even go as far as to say I probably loved it more than every mofo in those governing bodies that bestowed it with seventeen cumulative Billboard, American Music, Grammy, and MTV awards. Why? Because I was one of the score of hip-hop-loving and/or pregnant women who swore the album was soundtracking her life.\"\n\nThe Narrator Is Now The Mayor Of A Major City\n\nThe teacher heard talking with students on Miseducation's interludes, is voiced by Ras Baraka, now the longtime Mayor of Newark, NJ. At the time of Hill's album, Baraka, who is the son of the famous poet and activist Amiri Baraka, was well known in the community.\n\n\"I was running for councilman in Newark and was also an eighth grade teacher,\" Baraka revealed to Rolling Stone in 2008. \"I was just about to take two of my students home and Lauryn called and asked if I could come up to her house in South Orange. There were chairs set up in the living room and a bunch of kids were there. She told me she wanted to discuss the concept of love. There was a blackboard and I wrote the letters 'LOVE' and we just went into the whole discussion.\"\n\nThe Album Cover Was Almost Shot At Hill's High School\n\nPhotographer Eric Johnson and Hill went to her alma mater, Columbia High School in South Orange, New Jersey, to shoot pictures of her for the album cover.\n\n\"I always wanted to shoot photos that people would really connect with,\" Johnson told Okayplayer in 2021. \"I wanted to create something that was chic, but that regular people could identify with as well.\"\n\nBut instead of using one of those raw photos, Hill ultimately decided on the carved desk cover art that fans know, which is based on an image that Johnson took of her face.\n\nMiseducation Was Released In Four Different Physical Formats\n\nReleased in a pre-streaming era, Miseducation dropped on cassette, CD, minidisc and record. There is even a rare limited edition album made with orange-colored vinyl. (It's now available on all major streaming platforms.)\n\nThere Are Two Hidden Tracks\n\nThe vinyl version of the album and select international editions include two songs that aren't listed on the cover: \"Tell Him\" and \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You,\" a cover of Frankie Valli's Sixties standard. (Though today, the songs aren't hidden — they're widely available on streaming services.)\n\n\"Can't Take My Eyes Off of You\" Was In A Movie\n\nHill's rendition of \"Can't Take My Eyes Off of You\" was first in a Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts movie called Conspiracy Theory that came out in 1997 — which is the reason the song ended up on the album.\n\n\"It was originally recorded for [the soundtrack for the movie] Conspiracy Theory and ended up on the radio, became popular, and that's how it ended became a bonus track,\" Commissioner Gordon explained to Rolling Stone.\n\nCarlos Santana Guest Stars On \"To Zion\"\n\nWhen Santana played guitar on Hill's song about her son Zion, he fulfilled one of her childhood dreams. He weaves his instrument delicately and masterfully around a marching drum beat and the vocals of Hill and her background singers.\n\n\"I used to write music, you know, write songs over [Santana's] guitar playing when I was a little kid,\" Hill told MTV News in 1999. \"I had all his records and I would play 'Samba Pa Ti' on [the] 'Abraxas' album and just write rhymes and songs on top of it. So I knew Carlos way before he knew me.\"\n\nHer Duet With Mary J. Blige Samples Wu-Tang Clan\n\nHill and Mary J. Blige's duet \"I Used to Love Him\" samples a hook from \"Ice Cream,\" a song released in 1995 by rapper Raekwon featuring his fellow Wu-Tang Clan members Cappadonna and Method Man. The track's title also calls back to another '90s rap star, as it's a play on Common's 1994 song \"I Used to Love H.E.R.,\" an acronym for Hip-Hop in its Essence is Real.\n\nA College-Aged John Legend Played On \"Everything Is Everything\"\n\nJohn Legend was attending the University of Pennsylvania when he got the opportunity to meet Hill through a mutual friend. After he played piano and sang a Stevie Wonder song for her, she invited him to contribute to Miseducation.\n\n\"Lauryn said, 'Why don't you play on this record we're working on right now? And it was 'Everything is Everything,\" he said in a 2013 interview with Yahoo!\n\nThe song became a Top 40 hit, and Legend scored some bragging rights at school. \"I went back to college and I was the man after that,\" he joked.\n\nA Subtle Salute To House Music Hides In The Lyrics\n\nThough Miseducation is a hip-hop work that doesn't sonically veer into house music, Hill winks at a foundational classic from the dance music genre on the album. When she says, \"Jack ya, jack ya, jack ya body\" in \"Every Ghetto, Every City,\" she is referencing the 1986 club anthem \"Jack Your Body\" by Chicago DJ/producer Steve 'Silk' Hurley.\n\nNew Ark's Lawsuit Over The Album Raised Questions\n\nIn late 1998, the music collective New Ark (guitarist Johari Newton, pianist Tejumold Newton, drum programmer Vada Nobles and songwriter Rasheem \"Kilo\" Pugh) sued ill, alleging that their work on Miseducation was not properly credited. The lawsuit was reportedly settled for $5 million in 2001, but accusations outside the legal arena have persisted for years.\n\nIn 2018, Hill posted a written response to pianist Robert Glasper's claims that she uses work from others without giving credit. In it, she acknowledged that it took the work of others to bring her vision to life, but asserts that she is the nucleus, and that she hired musicians to execute her specific ideas.\n\n\"The album inspired many people, from all walks of life, because of its radical (intense) will to live and to express Love,\" she countered in the response, which was posted to Medium. \"I appreciate everyone who was a part of it, in any and every capability. It wouldn't have existed the way that it did without the involvement, skill, hard work, and talents of the artists/musicians and technicians who were a part of it, but it still required my vision, my passion, my faith, my will, my soul, my heart, and my story.\"\n\n\"Ex-Factor\" Made Its Way Into Two 2018 Rap Hits\n\nHill's \"Ex-Factor\" was sampled in two different pop hits that were both released in April 2018. Drake's \"Nice For What\" topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart, while Cardi B's \"Be Careful\" peaked at No. 11; both achieved higher chart success than the original, which stalled at number 21.\n\nLizzo took Inspiration From \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\" In 2022\n\nTeaming up with Mark Ronson, Lizzo interpolated (aka replayed) melodies from Hill's hit \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\" on \"Break Up Twice.\" The song appears on Lizzo's second album, Special. She's also performed covers of the original track on tour.\n\nThe Album Set Another Record 23 Years After Its Release\n\nIn 2021, Guinness Book of World Records noted that Hill became the first female rapper to reach RIAA Diamond certification for selling 10 million copies of Miseducation. Not only has no other female rapper achieved the feat since, but Hill is in rare company: the only other rappers to reach Diamond status for an album are Eminem, OutKast, Notorious B.I.G., 2Pac, Beastie Boys and MC Hammer.\n\nHill Announced A World Tour To Celebrate The 25th Anniversary\n\nOn Aug. 22, the star announced a 17-date world tour celebrating the 25th anniversary of her monumental solo album. Fugees will co-headline the U.S. stops, which begin in Minneapolis on Sept. 8.\n\n\"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is and was a love song to my parents, my family, my people, my musical and cultural forebears, my teachers, my loves, my Creator,\" Hill said in a press release. \"I wrote love songs and protest songs— (still love songs) about the subjects and interests that inspired and moved me. I was confident that what inspired me would resonate with an audience that had been led to believe that songs of that kind could only live in the past.\n\n\"I loved music, I loved people, I truly felt grateful to God for my life, and genuinely blessed to have a platform where I could share wisdom and perspective through music,\" she added. \"I felt a charge to challenge the idea that certain kinds of expression and/or certain kinds of people didn't belong in certain places. I loved showing what could work or happen provided there was imagination, creativity and LOVE leading the way.\"\n\n9 Teen Girls Who Built Hip-Hop: Roxanne Shante, J.J.

Released on Tommy Boy Records in 1989 — considered one of the years during hip-hop’s \"Golden Age\" — and produced by legendary DJ and hip-hop producer Prince Paul, the album was a critical and commercial success. Featuring samples that draw on a vast array of genres — from doo-wop and psychedelic rock to children’s music — the album was unlike any hip-hop album that came before it. Melding inventive production with clever and humorous wordplay and samples from artists as diverse as Johnny Cash (the title of the album is derived from the Cash song \"Five Feet High and Rising\"), Hall & Oates, Steely Dan, and the Turtles, 3 Feet High And Rising is often considered the beginning of 1990s alternative hip-hop. De La Soul’s use of skits/comedy sketches as interludes also had a huge influence on future generations of rappers. In a review of the album for The Village Voice in 1989, music critic Robert Christgau wrote, \"An inevitable development in the class history of rap, [De La Soul is] new wave to Public Enemy’s punk.\"\n\nFeaturing the singles \"The Magic Number,\" \"Buddy,\" \"Eye Know,\" and the GRAMMY-nominated \"Me Myself and I,\" 3 Feet High and Rising spent five weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. \"Buddy\" is one of the album’s hallmark songs and features cameos from Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, Jungle Brothers, Queen Latifah, and Monie Love — who are collectively known as the Native Tongues (along with Black Sheep, the Beatnuts and Chi Ali).\n\nThe platinum-certified record consistently places on lists of the greatest albums of all time, including in 2023 when Paste magazine featured it at No. 4 on their list of the Greatest Debut Albums of the 1980s. In 2010 it was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry. 3 Feet High and Rising has influenced countless artists, from the Roots and Yasiin Bey to OutKast and Common. With the album's undeniably trailblazing release, Posdnuos, Trugoy the Dove and Pasemaster Mase of De La Soul have cemented themselves as one of the best rap groups of all time.\n\nKelvin \"Posdnuos\" Mercer – Artist/Songwriter\n\nDavid \"Trugoy the Dove\" Jolicoeur – Artist/Songwriter\n\nVincent \"Maseo\" Mason – Artist/Songwriter\n\n\"Prince Paul\" Huston – Producer/Engineer/Songwriter\n\nAlan Watts – Engineer/Mixer\n\nGuns N’ Roses, Appetite For Destruction\n\nGeffen, 1987\n\nGuns N’ Roses’ Appetite For Destruction LP will go down in history as one of the most iconic and influential rock albums ever made. But when it was released in the summer of 1987, Appetite didn’t initially garner much mainstream attention. Once the band hit the road in support of the album, singles \"Welcome to the Jungle\", \"Paradise City\" and \"Sweet Child O' Mine\" started getting significant airplay. By the summer of 1988, the band found themselves with a No. 1 album on the Billboard 200. Appetite For Destruction became the best-selling album of all time in the U.S. and the best-selling debut album. In a review for Pitchfork, Maura Johnston said, \"The debut from Guns N' Roses was a watershed moment in '80s rock that chronicled every vice of Los Angeles led by the lye-voiced Axl Rose and a legendary, switchblade-sharp band.\"\n\nProduced by Mike Clink, Appetite for Destruction is widely considered a near perfect album where the deep cuts are just as good as the hits. From the opening roar of \"Welcome to the Jungle\" and the iconic \"Sweet Child O’ Mine,\" to \"It's So Easy,\" \"Nightrain,\" \"You're Crazy,\" and \"Mr. Brownstone,\" the album is an artistic triumph in sound, songwriting and production, earning its place at No. 62 on Rolling Stone’s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In many ways, the album changed the world. In a 2018 article for Revolver, Dan Epstein noted that Appetite ushered in a new wave of bands like the Black Crowes with its \"blues-based music played by an unflashy yet hard-swinging rhythm section, a rock-solid rhythm guitarist, a flashy-but-soulful lead player and a charismatic vocalist who exuded danger and decadence.\" It also paved the way for Nirvana and the arrival of grunge as rock fans’ \"ears were primed for more raw, real and rebellious hard rock.\" Now, nearly 40 years since its release, Appetite for Destruction has sold over 30 million copies worldwide and is without a doubt one of the most successful debut albums of all time.\n\nAxl Rose – Artist/Songwriter\n\nSlash – Artist/Songwriter\n\nDuff McKagan – Artist/Songwriter\n\nSteven Adler – Artist/Songwriter\n\nIzzy Stradlin – Artist/Songwriter\n\nMike Clink – Engineer/Producer\n\nSteve Thompson – Mixer\n\nBuena Vista Social Club, Buena Vista Social Club\n\nWorld Circuit/Nonesuch, 1997\n\nIn 1996, a group of veteran Cuban musicians was assembled to record an album that would pay tribute to Cuba’s \"musical golden age\" of the 1930s to 1950s. Showcasing styles of music that were popular at the time, such as son, bolero and danzón, the group became known as the Buena Vista Social Club, named after a 1940s-era members-only music club that was located in the Buenavista quarter of Havana. Organized by British music producer and executive Nick Gold and produced by GRAMMY-winning American guitarist Ry Cooder and Cuban director Juan de Marcos Gonzalez, Buena Vista Social Club recorded their eponymous 14-track debut album in just six days. Released in September 1997, the album featured 20 of Cuba’s most prominent musicians, including vocalist Ibrahim Ferrer (1927–2005), pianist Rubén González (1919–2003), and vocalist/guitarist Compay Segundo (1907–2003). Buena Vista Social Club was an instant hit with tracks such as the four-chord song \"Chan Chan,\" written by Segundo, and a rendition of the romantic criolla \"La Bayamesa.\" Everything fell into place at the right time for this album — from the chemistry between the musicians to the rich music history of Havana — to create one of the moments that can only be described as pure musical magic. Buena Vista Social Club sold more than 1 million copies, earned a spot on the Billboard 200, and won the GRAMMY Award for Best Tropical Latin Performance.\n\nIn 1998 the ensemble held performances in Amsterdam and New York that were captured on film by German director Wim Wenders. Along with interviews with musicians that were conducted in Havana, a documentary, titled Buena Vista Social Club, was released in 1999 and earned an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary (Feature). In 2003, Buena Vista Social Club was named on Rolling Stone’s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and in 2022, it was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry. Further cementing its place in the music history books, Buena Vista Social Club was recognized by Guinness World Records as the best-selling album of world music with more than 8 million copies sold worldwide.\n\nRy Cooder – Leader/Producer\n\nJuan Demarcos Gonzalez – Director\n\nLarry Hirsch – Engineer\n\nJerry Boys – Engineer/Mixer\n\nDonna Summer, \"I Feel Love\"\n\nCasablanca, 1977\n\nWhen the Queen of Disco, Donna Summer, released her hit single \"I Feel Love\" in 1977, it propelled Brian Eno (who was in the studio with David Bowie at the time) to rush in and declare, \"This single is going to change the sound of club music for the next 15 years.\" Now, more than 40 years after its release, \"I Feel Love\" definitely changed something – it changed pop music forever. Recorded with producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, the goal was to create a song that signified the future — and it did. \"I Feel Love\" was the first song to pair repetitive synthesizer loops with four-on the-floor bass drum and an off-beat hi-hat, helping to forge the path for synth pop, New Romantics, Italo disco, Hi-NRG, electro, house, techno, and more. Along the way, the global smash influenced countless artists, including Blondie, who became one of the first punk-associated groups to embrace disco, releasing \"Heart of Glass\" the following year.\n\nUpon its release, \"I Feel Love\" reached No. 1 in several countries, including the UK, and peaked in the Top 10 on the Billboard 200. In 2012, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Recording Registry. Many of today’s biggest artists have paid tribute to Summer’s groundbreaking track with covers or samples, including Madonna, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Bronski Beat, and Beyoncé, the latter of whom samples \"I Feel Love\" on \"Summer Renaissance,\" the closing track on her 2022 GRAMMY-winning album Renaissance. To this day, \"I Feel Love\" is considered the No. 1 greatest dance song of all time (Rolling Stone).\n\nThe song's impact on the LGBTQ+ community is equally as great as its impact on the dance community. GRAMMY-winning artist Sam Smith, who released a cover of \"I Feel Love\" in 2019, wrote on X: \"As a queer person, ‘I Feel Love’ has followed me to every dance floor in every queer space from the minute I started clubbing. This song, to me, is an anthem of our community.\" In 2023, Pride Life Global ranked the track as one of the best gay anthems.\n\nDonna Summer – Artist/Songwriter\n\nGiorgio Moroder – Producer/Songwriter\n\nPete Bellotte – Producer/Songwriter\n\nJürgen Koppers – Artist/Songwriter\n\nCharley Pride, \"Kiss An Angel Good Mornin'\"\n\nRCA Victor, 1971\n\n\"Kiss An Angel Good Mornin’\" is GRAMMY winner Charley Pride’s biggest hit of his career. Released in 1971 as the first single from his GRAMMY-winning album Charley Pride Sings Heart Songs, the song peaked at No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100, his only single to break the Top 40. Considered one of Pride’s signature songs, the track marked his eighth single to top the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and became one of the biggest country hits of the decade. \"Kiss An Angel Good Mornin’\" was produced by Cowboy Jack Clement (Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton) and written by Ben Peters, who got the inspiration for the song after he and his wife Jackie welcomed their daughter Angela. It’s a song purely about love and a slight departure from Pride’s other hits, such as \"I’m Just Me\" and \"I’d Rather Love You.\" In a 2021 article for CMT, Marcus K. Dowling writes, \"The achievement of conveying life's simple joys with a magnificent voice over complex countrypolitan rhythms and melodies — instead of discussing complex emotions over those same types of tracks — is the greatest victory of Pride's signature song.\" The single also earned Pride a GRAMMY nomination for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male. Since its release, \"Kiss An Angel Good Mornin’\" has been covered by countless artists, including George Jones, Conway Twitty, Gene Stuart, and Roy Clark — all of whom released the song in 1972 — along with Percy Sledge, Alan Jackson and Heather Myles.\n\nWhen he signed with RCA in 1964, Pride became the first Black country music singer to get a major record label deal. He went on to have 29 No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, selling more than 70 million records. When it comes to sales for RCA, he is second only to Elvis Presley. Though he passed away in December 2020, Pride’s impact on country music, especially Black country music artists, remains. His influence can be heard in the music of up-and-coming artists such as Brittney Spencer, Mickey Guyton and Shy Carter. As country music’s first Black superstar, Pride and his warm baritone captivated audiences, broke racial and cultural barriers, and earned him an induction into the Grand Ole Opry in 1993.\n\nCharley Pride – Artist\n\nJack Clement – Producer\n\nBen Peters – Songwriter\n\nRay Butts – Artist\n\nMike Shockley – Producer\n\nWanda Jackson, \"Let's Have A Party\"\n\nCapitol, 1960\n\nOriginally recorded by Elvis Presley for the 1957 musical/romance film Loving You, \"Let’s Have a Party\" was recorded by Wanda Jackson and released on her eponymous debut album in 1958. After Jackson’s version of \"Let’s Have a Party\" was discovered by an Iowa disc jockey and received an increase in interest from radio listeners, Capitol Records encouraged Jackson to release the song as a single two years later in 1960. The song became a hit, making the Top 40 in the U.S. and topping the chart in the U.K. The success of \"Let’s Have a Party\" inspired Jackson to rename her band the Party Timers and Capitol subsequently released the compilation album, Rockin’ With Wanda that same year. As one of the first women to have a career in rock and roll, Jackson recorded a series of singles in the 1950s that helped earn her the nickname of The Queen of Rockabilly. It was Elvis, with whom she toured with in 1955, who encouraged her to record in the rockabilly style.\n\nIn 2005, Jackson received the Fellowship Award from the National Endowment for the Arts, becoming the first female country and rock artist to receive the honor. In 2009, after several artists advocated on her behalf — including Elvis Costello, Bruce Springsteen and Cyndi Lauper — Jackson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Lauper has cited Jackson as one of her earliest influences, recording a cover of \"Funnel of Love\" for her 2016 album Detour. Other artists who have listed Jackson as an influence include Adele and Elle King.\n\nLauper told Rolling Stone in 2016: \"I think for country you look at Patsy Cline or Loretta Lynn who played a guitar, or sang the songs she wrote, and Dolly Parton. But Wanda Jackson was a rocker, and so, of course, I was going to listen and learn from her because I was a rocker and that's what we did.\"\n\nJackson is also a member of the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, the Iowa Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Oklahoma Hall of Fame, and the Oklahoma Country Music Hall of Fame. In 2010, she was the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Americana Music Honors.\n\nWanda Jackson – Artist\n\nKen Nelson – Producer/Engineer\n\nJesse Mae Robinson – Songwriter\n\nKid Ory’s Creole Orchestra (As Spike’s Seven Pods Of Pepper Orchestra), \"Ory's Creole Trombone\"\n\nNordskog, 1922\n\nLouisiana-born composer, trombonist and bandleader Edward \"Kid\" Ory put New Orleans jazz on the map. Kid Ory’s 1922 hit \"Ory’s Creole Trombone\" was the first recording of Black/Creole New Orleans jazz. Recorded in Los Angeles, the single features Ory on trombone, along with Thomas \"Papa Mutt\" Carey on cornet, Oliver \"Dink\" Johnson on clarinet, Fred Washington on piano, Ed \"Montudie\" Garland on bass, and Ben Borders on drums. Upon release, the entire first pressing of 5,000 records sold out, leading to gigs for Ory and his band down the California coast in San Diego and Tijuana.\n\nBorn on Christmas Day in LaPlace, Louisiana, Ory led a band early on in his career in New Orleans that featured music legends such as Joe \"King\" Oliver, Johnny Dodds, Johnny St. Cyr and, later, Louis Armstrong. Ory relocated to Los Angeles after the prohibition of alcohol in 1919 changed the landscape for jazz musicians performing in New Orleans nightclubs. Many of the musicians who played on his L.A. sessions had also recently relocated from New Orleans. After moving to Chicago in 1925, where jazz was just starting to gain traction, Ory worked and recorded with artists such as Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, and many others. He was an original member of Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five, with whom he would later re-record \"Ory’s Creole Trombone\" in 1927. As demonstrated on \"Ory's Creole Trombone,\" Ory was an early adapter of the glissando technique, now a central element of New Orleans jazz. While he might not have been the first to play a glissando on a trombone, he was certainly the most influential.\n\nIn 2005, \"Ory’s Creole Trombone\" was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry. In an essay written upon the recording's selection by the Library of Congress, GRAMMY-nominated musician and jazz historian David Sager wrote, \"‘Ory’s Creole Trombone’ offers a rare glimpse into the origins of New Orleans jazz and a remarkable insight to this music’s durability and universal appeal.\" A pioneering record and one of the most essential jazz recordings, \"Ory’s Creole Trombone\" helped define the New Orleans style of jazz and served as the prototype for future musicians of that genre.\n\nEdward \"Kid\" Ory – Artist/Songwriter\n\nLauryn Hill, The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill\n\nRuffhouse Records / Columbia Records, 1998\n\nWidely considered one of the greatest albums of all time, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is the debut album and only solo studio set released by GRAMMY-winning singer and rapper Lauryn Hill. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and sold more than 422,000 copies in its first week, breaking the record for first-week sales by a female artist. Credited for bringing hip-hop and neo-soul to the forefront of popular music, the album earned Hill 10 GRAMMY nominations, which now has her tied with Beyoncé for the Guinness World Record for most GRAMMY nominations in a single year for a female artist. Hill turned half of those nominations into wins, taking home the awards for Album Of The Year, Best New Artist, Best R&B Album, and Best Rhythm & Blues Song and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for \"Doo Wop (That Thing).\" With lyrics that present arguably the most poignant of female perspectives on life, love and relationships, while also touching on the turmoil within her former group the Fugees, three of the album’s singles — \"Everything Is Everything, \"Ex-Factor\" and \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\" — peaked in the Top 40 on the Billboard 200, with the latter claiming the top spot.\n\nThe Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was partially recorded at Bob Marley’s studio Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica, while Hill was pregnant with her first son, Zion. Speaking about that time, Hill told Rolling Stone, \"When some women are pregnant, their hair and their nails grow, but for me it was my mind and ability to create. I had the desire to write in a capacity that I hadn't done in a while. I don't know if it's a hormonal or emotional thing ... I was very in touch with my feelings at the time.\" The album’s track \"To Zion,\" which features Carlos Santana on guitar, is a song about her son.\n\nIn 1999, Hill became the first hip-hop artist to appear on the cover of TIME magazine. Now, more than 25 years since its release and with more than 20 million copies sold, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill continues to be one of the most influential albums ever made.\n\nLauryn Hill – Artist/Producer/Songwriter\n\nGordon \"Commissioner Gordon\" Williams – Engineer\n\nTony Prendatt – Engineer\n\nThe Doobie Brothers, \"What A Fool Believes\"\n\nWarner Bros. Records, 1978\n\nOne of the few non-disco songs to hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1979, the Doobie Brothers’ \"What a Fool Believes\" is featured on their 1978 eighth studio album, the Album Of The Year-nominated Minute by Minute. Co-written by Michael McDonald and Kenny Loggins, \"What a Fool Believes\" won the Doobie Brothers two GRAMMY Awards, including Record Of The Year. Stylistically speaking, the song is unlike anything the Doobie Brothers had done before.\n\n\"What a Fool Believes\" started off as a piano piece idea McDonald had. Producer Ted Templeman heard what he was working on and encouraged him to put some lyrics down with a co-writer. It turns out that McDonald and Loggins had talked about working together for some time. When they got together at McDonald’s house in Los Angeles to write, Loggins had already come up with the song’s hook — \"she had a place in his life.\" Telling the story of a man who attempts to rekindle a romantic relationship, \"What a Fool Believes\" is about the lies we sometimes tell ourselves about past romances. When the protagonist in the song attempts to reconnect with an old love, he realizes that he barely registers in the woman’s mind. The Doobie Brothers and Templeman recorded numerous takes of its rhythm track over five or six days, but they couldn’t land on a version they all liked. Templeman eventually decided to cut up the master tape of a recording into sections. \"In those days when you cut the tape, you’re over – that’s the master of your recording,\" recalled Templeman in an interview with The Guardian in 2022. \"But we got lucky and I put it together on the spot.\" McDonald completed the rest of the arrangement, adding keyboards, vocals and strings. Before it was released by the Doobie Brothers, Loggins released his own jazzier and experimental version of the song on his 1978 album Nightwatch.\n\n\"What a Fool Believes\" was rated as the Doobie Brothers’ all-time greatest song by Ultimate Classic Rock critic Michael Gallucci and listed on Rolling Stone’s Top 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list. Today, \"What a Fool Believes\" is considered a \"foundational yacht rock classic,\" as Tom Breihan wrote in a review for Stereogum in 2020.

Recorded as a demo with members of the Mar-Keys and MG’s, \"You Don’t Miss Your Water\" was originally released as a B-side of his single \"Formula of Love\" and gained steam after DJs flipped the record over and started playing \"You Don’t Miss Your Water.\" The song became the first hit for Stax Records, charting on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1962. It was later released on Bell’s 1967 album The Soul of a Bell and remains his best-known recording to this day.\n\n\"The message is universal: appreciate what you have,\" said Bell in a 2022 interview with Uncut magazine. \"Back then I didn’t realize what I was writing, but after I got a little older, I realized that although the world changes physically, every generation has the same wishes, desires and aspirations. If you just write truthfully about life and write things you think will help people, it will resonate.\"\n\nAnd indeed, the song did resonate. More than six decades since its release, \"You Don’t Miss Your Water\" has gone on to become a Southern classic. Countless artists have recorded covers of it, including Otis Redding, Percy Sledge, Taj Mahal, Jerry Lee Lewis, the Black Crowes, Sturgill Simpson, Peter Tosh & the Wailers, Brian Eno, and, most notably, the Byrds, on their seminal 1968 country-rock album Sweetheart of the Rodeo.\n\nIn 2013, Bell performed \"You Don’t Miss Your Water\" before President Barack Obama during \"In Performance at the White House: Memphis Soul.\" The following year, Bell was featured in the documentary Take Me to the River, reflecting upon American music's soul. He was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2016. In 2020, the National Endowment for the Arts celebrated him as a Heritage Fellow. Bell was instrumental in ushering in the Southern soul music genre, which is now known as the globally influential \"Memphis Sound.\"\n\nWilliam Bell – Artist/Songwriter\n\nChips Moman – Producer\n\nExplore The History Of The GRAMMY Hall Of Fame\n\n2023 has seen countless tributes to hip-hop, celebrating both its golden anniversary and the staying power of a genre that was vilified, underestimated, and branded a passing fad for decades. Nonetheless, while 50 is a major milestone, many believe hip-hop reached its peak decades ago.\n\nAt the tail end of the golden age of hip-hop, the genre reached a new level of maturity. Twenty-five years ago, hip-hop music demonstrated a wide variety of production styles and a diversity of perspectives. Further proving that 1998 was a high watermark for hip-hop, several important and stylistically distinct albums by Jay-Z, Black Star, A Tribe Called Quest and Outkast were even released on the same day.\n\nThis diversity of expression resulted in multiple commercially successful, distinct subgenres and niche audiences. The culture moved beyond the bi-coastal hostility that had culminated in the tragic murders of Tupac and Biggie, and the South asserted itself in a big way. The year’s versatility was demonstrated through the emergence of an underground scene that was critical of mainstream hip-hop’s consumerist mentality, but nonetheless thrived alongside commercially successful albums by both new and established artists.\n\nSouthern Hip-Hop Earns Respect\n\nBy 1998 groups beyond the East and West Coasts had started to gain national visibility — a hallmark of hip-hop's growing maturity.\n\nWhile Outkast's Andre 3000 famously declared that \"The South got somethin’ to say\" in1995, the group didn't earn widespread respect and recognition until three years later. Released in September 1998, Aquemini, garnered near-universal praise — earning Outkast a notoriously rare five mics in The Source — and is still considered to be one of hip-hop’s greatest albums.\n\nNo other hip-hop group sounded like Outkast, and Southern flavor and slang pervaded the album (see the harmonica breakdown in \"Rosa Parks\"), but it was also the live instrumentation on tracks like \"Liberation\" and \"SpottieOttieDopaliscious\" that made the album so special.\n\nFellow ATLiens Goodie MOB, a group in the Dungeon Family collective, also released an album in '98. Like Aquemini, their sophomore effort Still Standing was produced largely by Organized Noize and featured a similar production style.\n\nOutkast and Goodie MOB collaborated often in the 1990s: Aquemini’s \"Liberation\" only works because of the deeply soulful vocals of Goodie MOB’s Cee-Lo, and Still Standing’s \"Black Ice\" features one of Andre 3000’s most poetic and brilliant verses. While speaking to the many struggles of being young, Black and poor in the South, these two groups demonstrated how regional pride could be asserted in a more positive way, instead of spilling over into real-life violence; it was evidence of hip-hop’s maturity.\n\nOn the more commercial side, Atlanta rapper/producer Jermaine Dupri — who was already producing and writing songs for major R&B artists like Usher and Mariah Carey — released his debut album, resulting in one of the hits of the summer: the bouncy Jay-Z collaboration \"Money Ain’t A Thang.\" New Orleans was also becoming an important locus of Southern hip-hop by 1998, with Master P’s No Limit Records releasing albums by Master P himself, Silkk the Shocker, C-Murder, Mystikal, and Snoop Dogg. Hits included \"Make ‘Em Say Ugh\" and \"It Ain’t My Fault,\" both containing Mystikal’s distinctive high-pitched growling; his lightning-fast verse on the first song is truly something to behold. Also from Crescent City, Cash Money Records struck gold with Juvenile’s 400 Degreez and his booty-shaking anthem, \"Back That Azz Up.\"\n\nThe Rise of Underground Hip-Hop\n\n1998 was also the year \"underground\" hip-hop bubbled to the surface as a reaction to the genre’s crossover success. It was defined primarily by a critique of the presumed excessive consumerism of mainstream hip-hop, and a desire to return to the days when DJs, b-boys and graffiti artists were as important as rappers.\n\nTurntablism was strongly associated with this style, as were cyphers — gatherings where rappers, b-boys and beatboxers would form a circle and engage in freestyle battles. The emergence of underground hip-hop was another sign that the genre was maturing as a whole; artists were no longer as worried about the ghettoization by the music industry and some felt that it had strayed too far from its marginalized roots.\n\nThe most significant underground hip-hop album of 1998 was Mos Def and Talib Kweli are Black Star, created by a young duo of Brooklyn MCs. Interestingly, it was released on the same day in September as Aquemini, as well as two other major albums of the year: Jay-Z’s Vol. 2…Hard Knock Life and A Tribe Called Quest’s The Love Movement — which although not an essential listen in their discography, did produce a hit with \"Find A Way.\" Four major albums released on the same day was a testament to how far hip-hop had come.\n\nIn fact, the Black Star album was an explicit critique of the type of consumerist mentality and sexually explicit/boasting lyrics Jay-Z employed on Hard Knock Life. Songs like \"Definition\" display Mos Def and Talib Kweli’s exceptional lyrical dexterity and clever references, while \"Hater Players\" draws a clear line in the sand between commercial hip-hop and the \"real MCs.\" In the latter, Kweli raps: \"We ain't havin’ that, reachin’ past the star status that you grabbin’ at/ My battle raps blast your ass back to your natural habitat.\"\n\nMos Def’s adaptation of Slick Rick’s \"Children’s Story\" is a clever screed about the lack of originality within mainstream hip-hop. \"They jacked the beats, money came wit' ease, but son, he couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease. He jacked another and another, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder.\" The song was a not-so-veiled reference to the production technique utilized by Puff Daddy, relying heavily on well-known samples of soul and R&B songs.\n\nBlack Star also distinguished itself from much of commercial rap of the time by uplifting, instead of denigrating, women. \"Brown Skin Lady\" is an ode to Black women throughout the African diaspora, presenting a clear contrast to the frequent use of the b-word on Hard Knock Life, particularly on one of its biggest hits, \"Can I Get A…\" Nonetheless, like many \"conscious\" rappers — notably, Common, who makes a guest appearance on this album — Black Star reflects the almost-universal homophobia in hip-hop at the time, particularly in Mos Def’s verse on \"Re-Definition.\"\n\nDespite Jay-Z’s distrust and demonization of women on Hard Knock Life — his third and most commercially successful record — no one can dispute his tremendous verbal prowess and flow, evident on tracks like \"N— What, N— Who.\" And while he called out \"gold diggers\" in \"Can I Get A…,\" he invited a female rapper (Amil) onto the song — leveling the playing field a bit.\n\nProduction-wise, Jay-Z’s use of the \"Annie\" theme for the title song was one of the most inspired choices in the genre’s history. The slick production of the album guaranteed it would be a home run; in retrospect, it heralded the future of commercial hip-hop’s sound.\n\nOher underground hip-hop artists were making big waves in 1998. Rawkus Records — which released the Black Star album — put out an important compilation, Lyricist Lounge, Volume 1, which featured performances by Mos Def, Talib Kweli, A Tribe Called Quest’s Q-Tip, and the L.A.-based Jurassic 5, who also released their debut album that year. Other West Coast underground artists who released debut albums in 1998 included the Bay Area-based Hieroglyphics and Rasco, and the L.A.-based Aceyalone and People Under the Stairs.\n\nDebuts, Veterans And The Biggest Album Of The Year\n\n1998 also saw the release of important debut albums by commercial hip-hop artists like DMX, Big Pun and Black Eyed Peas. Big Pun’s \"Still Not A Player\" was one of the biggest hits of the year, with his lyricism reminiscent of Biggie.\n\nDMX had a particularly productive year, releasing two albums in 1998, It’s Dark and Hell Is Hot and Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood. That year, it was impossible to escape the melodic hook and chorus of \"Ruff Ryders’ Anthem\" (\"Stop! Drop! Shut ‘em down, open up shop\") from the first DMX album. DMX also contributed a memorable verse on the Lox’s hit \"Money, Power, Respect,\" off the group’s debut album, released by Puffy’s Bad Boy.\n\nBeyond the debut albums of 1998, a slew of established artists from various regions and representing myriad styles put out their third, fourth or fifth albums. East Coast artists with new albums included Beastie Boys, Method Man, Redman, Busta Rhymes, Queen Latifah, Gang Starr, Mc Lyte, and Public Enemy, who released a soundtrack album for Spike Lee’s He Got Game. On the West Coast, there were new albums by Cypress Hill, Ice Cube, and Digital Underground.\n\nNotwithstanding the success of so many diverse hip-hop artists, no album achieved greater heights than Lauryn Hill’s masterful solo debut, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. To start, it won Album Of The Year at the 1999 GRAMMYs, a feat never before accomplished for a hip-hop artist, as well as four other golden gramophones. Hill wrote, arranged and produced the album herself, reportedly turning down offers for production help from both her former Fugees bandmate Wyclef Jean and her label, which suggested bringing in Wu-Tang Clan’s mastermind, RZA.\n\nThe album was somewhere between R&B and hip-hop (and in fact was nominated and won in R&B instead of rap categories), and right off the bat, the album showcases Hill’s considerable skill as both a rapper and singer. The dancehall-inflected \"Lost Ones\" takes on an aggressive stance, with Hill rapping in Jamaican patois and invoking phrases of religious retribution, but it’s followed by a neo-soul breakup ballad, \"Ex-Factor,\" featuring Hill’s signature throaty vocals.\n\nThe other major hits on the album besides \"Ex-Factor\" were \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\" and \"Everything Is Everything,\" which cemented Hill as one of the best lyricists in hip-hop. Twenty-five years later, the whole album holds up beautifully and features some incredible invited guests.\n\nPerhaps it’s not a coincidence that the first hip-hop album to break the Album Of The Year barrier was released in 1998 — when the genre had reached what is arguably its creative apex. With the incredible stylistic and regional diversity of that year’s albums, hip-hop had succeeded beyond its founders’ wildest dreams.\n\nHip-Hop Just Rang In 50 Years As A Genre.
