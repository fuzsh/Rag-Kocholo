        "text": "This afternoon, DMB management announced a video webcast livestream for the European Tour finale in Lisbon, Portugal, taking place this coming Sunday, May 5. The show will stream free of charge on the VOLTA platform. From their website: \"VOLTA is a pioneering technology and entertainment company on a mission to revolutionize the way people experience their favorite events, sports, and entertainment.\"\n\nWith the announcement, this was the right time to put together a list of all of the DMB-related shows that have had a video webcast livestream. While there are 50+ webcast shows, they mostly fall into the event category. Usually it's a festival like Farm Aid - separate from the tour and likely to be Dave solo or with Tim, or one that fits into the tour like Bonnaroo or Rothbury Festival. Some were sessions directly for an online platform such as AOL. Considering how common webcasts are even from other artists in DMB's same management group, it's actually pretty uncommon for DMB to webcast a concert from a standard tour. Fans have relied on other fans' livestreams on Facebook and reconstructed fan-shot footage from YouTube creators like ChesterCopperpot5 and Concertvids3.\n\nHere is a look at some of the notable webcasts over the years:\n\nAnnounced on November 2, 1998, the first DMB video webcast was the 1998 Fall Tour finale from Chicago's United Center on 12.19.98. It was streamed for free on rollingstone.com, and the band sold t-shirts on the old www.dmband.com website. The show featured memorable guest appearances by Victor Wooten, Maceo Parker, and Mitch Rutman, and would be released on CD three years later.\n\nThe next major webcasts were hosted by America Online. Though it's not considered part of the 2003 Summer Tour proper, it's difficult not to objectively call the Central Park concert on 9.24.03 one of the peaks of DMB's career with a career-spanning setlist and performance that matched the event. The Stand Up release show from Roseland Ballroom on 5.9.05 was a chance for all fans to see live debuts of four songs from the new album. 8.12.06 is what we believe was the final AOL broadcast and was the final \"normal\" show stream for almost a decade. This night 2 in West Palm Beach might be more known as one of the rougher nights on Dave's voice.\n\nFall 2007 brought the \"World's Loudest Pep Rally,\" a contest by AT&T promoting their text message services. Students from all Division I universities voted, and West Point won. The final advertised tally was over 3 million total votes. DMB played two shows on the West Point campus on 11.14 and 11.15.07 that were also streamed on AT&T's website. Highlights from these shows include Robert Randolph guesting, the longest performance of The Dreaming Tree on record, an early look at Snow Outside in the form of Round and Round, Butch Taylor's last public appearance before stepping away from the band, and an electric energy that still comes through on the tapes today.\n\nSeveral concerts were streamed as part of festivals over the next few years including a few that were scheduled as part of the tour such as Rothbury, Mile High Music Festival, and Farm Aid, which became an annual Dave & Tim gig starting in 2008. DMB also tried their first and only paid webcast during this time. Before the 2010 Fall Tour, DMB management announced that they would be taking 2011 off from touring. Eventually deciding to celebrate the band's 20th anniversary, they took to the stage for a series of festival weekends called the DMB Caravan. The final originally-scheduled weekend of the Caravan tour was The Gorge, and the webcasts of these shows were hosted on livedownloads.com as a $35.00 package. Because streams were sold through the band, it seemed like this might be the start of more consistent offerings, but the next standard show webcast didn't come for several more years.\n\nSince those shows, there have only been a handful of random full show video streams. On 7.15.14, yahoo.com webcast DMB's full show from Jacksonville, which is the only \"2 Sets\" show to be webcast. Then in 2018, three full Saturday night concerts from Camden, SPAC, and The Gorge were webcast on youtube.com via dmblivestream.com - the latter two pairing with the then–brand new SiriusXM Friday Night Concert Series. Highlights of these shows are a JTR liberation and what is currently the final complete performance of The Last Stop, with Hamilton de Holanda guesting on bandolim. The most recent streamed \"normal\" show was 7.20.19 in Bristow, VA, also on YouTube, and was the third consecutive show that was impacted by weather - this time a lightning storm forced the band off the stage and fans to shelter five songs into the set.\n\nThis Sunday in Lisbon will be the first proper tour show to be webcast since that night. With a Summer Tour right in front of us, hopefully this kicks off an era of more regular DMB webcasts. The show is scheduled to begin at 3:00 PM EDT, and you can sign up for the webcast at www.volta.live.\n\nHere is a list of every known DMB live video webcast (additional thanks to Copperpot for the review).One of DMB fans' most frequently-requested shows has been officially released just over 11 years after it took place: Live Trax 63: 7.6.12–7.7.12 - Alpine Valley Music Theatre - East Troy, WI is now available for purchase from DMB's web store. The title implies that it includes both shows in full; however, the release contains the full 7.7.12 concert and a disc of selections from the previous night, in similar fashion to Live Trax 31 (6.23.01), 33 (1.31.95), and 34 (6.24.99). While Live Trax 30 was named for the three partial shows it comprises (8.16, 8.17, and 8.18.93), these other Live Trax with filler discs had all been named after the full show only. The other two times a Live Trax release was named after multiple dates—Live Trax 6 and 9—both complete shows were released in the package. In return, this is the first time that a filler disc has taken a show past three discs and not been a pre-order bonus.\n\nAfter Live Trax 8, 15, and 36, this is the fourth live release recorded at Alpine Valley, the most for any venue. Two other venues, The Gorge and Red Rocks, have had just as many or more full shows released, but their numbers are padded by box sets containing full multi-night runs from 2002 and 2005, respectively, and therefore have had only two distinct releases each.\n\nThe release of Live Trax 63 comes 245 days after the previous entry, from Blossom Music Center (6.25.10). While not formally explained, it’s clear that DMB didn’t want a Live Trax release interfering with the release of Walk Around the Moon in May. This ties for the second longest gap between releases, with Live Trax 45 (6.29.13) being released a few months after Come Tomorrow and after a period of uncertainty following Boyd Tinsley's departure from the band. Whether this leads to the first break in the usual four-Live-Trax-per-year cycle since 2011 – a year the band planned to take a break and only Live Trax 20 (8.19.93) was released – remains to be seen.\n\nOn May 19, 2010—two weeks before the 2010 Summer Tour kicked off—DMB announced in an email that after their upcoming 53-show summer tour and extending into the fall, the band would take 2011 off. After a finale in Charlottesville that had a \"last show for a while\" vibe to it, there were no DMB shows on the schedule for less than five months, when they announced the band would host a series of three-night festivals called the Caravan Tour in the summer of 2011.\n\nAfter this “year off,” DMB hit the road in their traditional fashion in May 2012, kicking off the Summer Tour in Texas for the first time, starting a tradition that has carried forward to 2023 with few exceptions. It was somewhat of an album tour; however, all that fans knew at the start of the tour was that a new album was coming later in the year. Away From the World itself wasn’t announced until June 27 and not released until September 12, the last day of the tour. Sweet was the first song from the album to debut, having already been played by Dave solo the prior summer during the Caravan Tour; Dave debuted Mercy on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon before the tour; and DMB gifted the mailing list with a download of Gaucho a few hours before the tour kicked off in The Woodlands (this version is an early mix and is different from the studio version—perhaps this is Steve Lillywhite's mix he has referred to in podcasts?). Those three songs were the backbone of the early tour before live debuts of The Riff and If Only in June and Belly Belly Nice, Rooftop, and Snow Outside later in the summer (the remaining two songs from the album, Belly Full and Drunken Soldier, debuted the first show of the Fall Tour). While the 2012 Summer Tour hadn’t had any full show releases until now, the deluxe editions of Away From the World contained bonus live tracks from the first half of the tour.\n\nBeyond the tour as a whole, this particular show itself also stands out. It has the highest average song rarity of the entire tour: the average song was played once every 4.026 shows on the tour, with six songs played fewer than five times on the tour. It begins with the first Little Thing opener played by DMB since 4.30.96 (also released as Live Trax 4), which segues directly into Funny the Way It Is with an extended intro (they opened two of the following three shows again with Little Thing, then haven’t played it full-band since). Guitar virtuoso Stanley Jordan guests on Rhyme & Reason, The Dreaming Tree, and Thank You, all for the first time. Aided by five songs that reach or surpass the 13-minute mark, this show was the longest ever played at the time (now second to 7.25.15, another Alpine show), and it is one of only four shows ever that is known to contain over three hours of music. The band’s five longest shows all now have some sort of release (Live Trax 36, like this, contains a full show and a bonus disc of music from night 1).\n\nThe extra disc of material from night 1 contains nine additional songs, including Jordan on Proudest Monkey » Satellite, as well as fan favorites You Never Know, The Best of What’s Around, Pig, and Lie in Our Graves. Notably, the Best of What’s Around from this show was previously released on the bonus DVD from the Super Deluxe Edition of Away From the World.\n\nHere is management’s official write-up:\n\nOn July 7th, 2012 Dave Matthews Band made their 25th appearance at Alpine Valley Music Theater. They came with songs from all possible eras of their career including music from the upcoming release, Away From the World. From the first notes of a partial Little Thing, to the explorations in Dreaming Tree with guest Stanley Jordan on guitar, to the extended funk of Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin) the band brings it all out on the stage.\n\nIncluded in this volume are selections from the first night of this highlight filled two night stand.\n\nYou can purchase it here.Almanac rarity\n\nOne of the most important characteristics the Almanac attempts to maintain is objectivity. Something that comes up often in discussion about Dave Matthews Band is ranking things: which songs are best, which shows are best, which tours are best, etc. Clearly, the concept of \"best\" is an inherently subjective one, but are there any objective ways of ranking tours? From an \"on-paper\" perspective, there are two variables that tend to come up when people discuss which tours are better than others: song selection and setlist variation. Quality of song selection is obviously not possible to quantify objectively, but it does seem possible to do so with setlist variation. A common observation about the band's setlist variation is that they don't vary their setlists as much as they used to. Is that true? Let's see if we can find out.\n\nDifferent Songs Played\n\nThe easiest way to rank tours against one another is to look at how many different songs were played over the course of each.\n\nHere are the rankings (with total different songs played in parentheses):\n\n1 Summer/Fall 2021 (120)\n\n2 Summer 2015 (116)\n\n3 Summer 2022 (111)\n\n4 Summer 2013 (110)\n\n5 Summer 2014 (107)\n\n6 Summer 2012 (99)\n\nT-7 Summer 2018 (97)\n\nT-7 Summer 2019 (97)\n\n8 Summer 2010 (96)\n\n10 Summer 2016 (88)\n\nT-11 Summer 2008 (78)\n\nT-11 International Summer 2009 (78)\n\nT-13 Summer 2006 (72)\n\nT-13 International Fall 2015 (72)\n\n15 Summer 2007 (71)\n\n16 Summer 2003 (68)\n\nT-17 Spring/Summer 2001 (61)\n\nT-17 Summer 2005 (61)\n\n18 Spring 2002 (57)\n\nT-20 Summer 2000 (56)\n\nT-20 Summer 2002 (56)\n\nT-20 Summer 2004 (56)\n\nT-23 Fall 1998 (50)\n\nT-23 Summer 1999 (50)\n\n25 Summer 1998 (44)\n\n26 Fall 1996 (42)\n\n27 Summer 1995 (41)\n\n28 Spring 1998 (39)\n\n29 Fall 1994 (37)\n\nT-30 Spring 1994 (34)\n\nT-30 Winter 1995 (34)\n\nT-30 Spring 1995 (34)\n\n33 Summer 1997 (33)\n\n34 Winter 1994 (31)\n\nThere are some problems with this way of comparing tours, namely that the band's song catalog has grown greatly in the 31 years they have been playing together, so it is not really fair to compare a 1994 tour to a 2015 tour. Another problem is that the band often plays some songs only one or two times on a tour but plays others far more often; this means that a higher number of songs does not necessarily indicate greater setlist variety.\n\nPercentage of Catalog Played\n\nTo overcome the size-of-catalog problem, let's rank the tours by the percentage of the then-current catalog that was played on the tour. Here we are excluding defunct songs once their evolved versions debuted, and we're also excluding covers and segues.\n\nHere are the same tours ranked by total percentage of catalog played (with total played/catalog size and percentage in parentheses):\n\n1 Fall 1994 (34/40; 85.0%)\n\n2 Summer 1995 (37/45; 82.2%)\n\n3 Spring 1994 (30/37; 81.1%)\n\n4 Winter 1995 (32/40; 80.0%)\n\n5 Fall 1996 (38/50; 76.0%)\n\n6 Winter 1994 (28/37; 75.7%)\n\n7 Spring 1995 (32/43; 74.4%)\n\n8 Fall 1998 (43/60; 71.7%)\n\n9 Summer 2003 (61/86; 70.9%)\n\n10 Summer 2000 (47/68; 69.1%)\n\n11 Summer 1999 (43/63; 68.3%)\n\n12 Summer 2013 (102/151; 67.5%)\n\n13 Spring/Summer 2001 (54/81; 66.7%)\n\n14 Summer 1998 (38/59; 64.4%)\n\n15 Summer 2010 (88/138; 63.8%)\n\n16 Summer 2015 (97/155; 62.6%)\n\n17 Summer 2014 (94/151; 62.3%)\n\n18 Summer 1997 (31/50; 62.0%)\n\n19 Summer 2012 (91/150; 60.7%)\n\n20 Summer 2006 (68/113; 60.2%)\n\n21 Summer/Fall 2021 (101/170; 59.4%)\n\n22 Summer 2002 (50/86; 58.1%)\n\nT-23 Spring 2002 (48/85; 56.5%)\n\nT-23 Summer 2004 (52/92; 56.5%)\n\n25 Spring 1998 (33/59; 55.9%)\n\n26 Summer 2018 (92/165; 55.8%)\n\n27 Summer 2022 (94/171; 55.0%)\n\n28 Summer 2008 (65/121; 53.7%)\n\n29 Summer 2016 (83/159; 52.2%)\n\nT-30 Summer 2007 (62/119; 52.1%)\n\nT-30 Summer 2019 (86/165; 52.1%)\n\n32 Summer 2005 (55/106; 51.9%)\n\n33 International Summer 2009 (64/136; 47.1%)\n\n34 International Fall 2015 (68/155; 43.9%)\n\nLooking at the tours this way makes it slightly more apples-to-apples when comparing an early tour to a more recent one, but it still doesn't account for the band's tendency to play certain songs far more often than others, thus causing the number-of-songs-played figure to be a bit misleading. Furthermore, it creates a new problem: the band played about 85% of its catalog on the Fall 1994 tour, which required them to play 41 different songs; by comparison, they would have had to have played 145 different songs in 2021 in order to play the same percentage of their catalog. Finally, it's a bit subjective to determine which songs should count as being \"in the catalog\" at the time: do songs from Some Devil count, even if they've never been played at a DMB show? Does Captain count from 1996 onward, or only from 2000, 2001, or 2002? Which, if any, cover songs count? It's certainly a judgment call.\n\nAverage Rarity\n\nSince adjusting for one skewed variable creates another skewed variable, and vice-versa, let's take a different approach. Our website assigns each show a rarity index number, which represents how often the average song in that show's setlist was played on the tour. For example, if a show has a 2.000 rarity, that means that the average song in that show's setlist was played once every two shows on that tour. Averaging all of the rarity index numbers for a given tour provides a rarity value for the entire tour.\n\nHere's what the rankings look like this way (with average rarity in parentheses):\n\n1 Summer 2022 (3.419)\n\n2 Summer/Fall 2021 (3.399)\n\n3 Summer 2013 (3.341)\n\n4 Summer 2015 (3.198)\n\n5 Summer 2012 (3.048)\n\n6 Summer 2014 (2.978)\n\n7 Summer 2019 (2.956)\n\n8 Summer 2016 (2.783)\n\n9 Summer 2018 (2.731)\n\n10 Summer 2003 (2.665)\n\n11 Summer 2010 (2.634)\n\n12 Summer 2006 (2.581)\n\n13 Summer 2008 (2.452)\n\n14 International Fall 2015 (2.253)\n\n15 Summer 2007 (2.234)\n\n16 Summer 2002 (2.213)\n\n17 Summer 2005 (2.204)\n\n18 Summer 2000 (2.190)\n\n19 Summer 1999 (2.147)\n\n20 Spring 2002 (2.101)\n\n21 International Summer 2009 (2.066)\n\n22 Spring/Summer 2001 (2.047)\n\n23 Summer 2004 (1.943)\n\n24 Fall 1998 (1.805)\n\n25 Spring 1994 (1.764)\n\n26 Fall 1994 (1.759)\n\n27 Winter 1995 (1.746)\n\n28 Summer 1998 (1.657)\n\n29 Spring 1995 (1.623)\n\n30 Summer 1995 (1.540)\n\n31 Winter 1994 (1.527)\n\n32 Spring 1998 (1.476)\n\n33 Fall 1996 (1.470)\n\n34 Summer 1997 (1.321)\n\nWhile the previous two ways of looking at this are flawed-yet-acceptable proxies for setlist variety, this method is a true measurement. The average song on the Summer 1997 tour was played once every 1.321 shows, while the average song on the Summer/Fall 2021 tour was played once every 3.399 shows.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo what's the takeaway here? Are the band's recent setlists as varied as they were in the early days? No, they are in fact much more varied! But these statistics aren't what truly matter for most people—what matters are the actual performance and quality of the songs themselves, and those are impossible to quantify. It's likely that people who complain about a lack of setlist variety are actually referring to their own subjective perspective on setlist quality.\n\nStray Observations\n\nPlease note that the data above feature only tours with 20 or more shows whose setlists are known. Short tours over- or under-inflate certain statistics, so we have chosen to ignore those tours. Additionally, some of the data above has been adjusted to account for unknown setlists.\n\nWe often see people misinterpreting our site's rarity index numbers and rankings as a quantitative assessment of how good a show was. Just because a show has the highest rarity index number for its tour does not necessarily mean it was the best show of the tour. That's for you to decide. It just means that the songs at that show weren't played as often as the songs at other shows.\n\nThe most recent major tour whose average rarity index value is less than 2 is Summer 2004 (1.943), when Crazy Easy, Hello Again, Joyride, and Sugar Will were all played at nearly every show. Summer 1997 has one of the lowest average rarity index values of all time (1.321), due mostly to nearly every encore being identical. Many people consider these two tours among the best the band has done, which is good evidence that rarity (and, by extension, variety) isn't everything.\n\nThe single rarest show of all time (again, from tours with 20+ known setlists) is 9.1.13, with a rarity index of 5.025. Remember, though, that a show's rarity index number is only good for comparing a show to others from the same tour. We made a big deal about the rarity index value for 9.8.02 back when that show became the rarest of all time; its score is a meager 3.825!"
