        "text": "This time last year, Jeff Rosenstock was living in a cramped Brooklyn apartment, surrounded by toppling towers of records, T-shirts and shipping boxes. For eight years, he and his wife and tour manager, Christine, had used their tight living space as the hub of operations for his career as a punk frontperson, indie label operator, and soundtrack composer. Then, in January, the couple packed everything up and moved across the country to the Highland Park area of Los Angeles, where they could stretch out a bit. They now inhabit a house with a porch that overlooks sun-drenched hills and rooftops, an office out of which they fulfill mail orders, a studio room where Rosenstock spends most of his day writing, and the greatest luxury for any former New Yorker: a laundry room. Two months after making the cross-country jump, though, the world decided they'd be stuck in their new digs for a while.\n\n\"It seems like a good time to switch from an apartment to a house,\" says Rosenstock. \"It makes me nervous to think about New York. I feel for everybody who's there. In my mind, I can't imagine walking around in New York City and not touching, like, 30 things the second you step out of your house.\"\n\nEven though Rosenstock's surroundings have changed and the entire world has been turned upside-down, the 37-year-old remains the same. Despite his proud slacker demeanor, the cult punk hero thrives on proliferation, and all the time locked inside has made him more productive than ever. Last week, he treated his devoted fanbase to a surprise album, NO DREAM, which had been recorded in February with GRAMMY-nominated producer Jack Shirley. The release comes only a few months after a live record, 2019's Thanks, Sorry!, not to mention sporadic output from his buddy project with Chris Farren called Antarctigo Vespucci, and his day job scoring the Cartoon Network show \"Craig Of The Creek.\"\n\nNO DREAM, his fourth LP since going solo following the dissolution of his beloved Bomb The Music Industry!, has been a welcome gift for fans, though the timing is bittersweet. Rosenstock's songs are meant to be sung—or, more accurately, shouted—in densely packed rooms of sweaty friends. With no live shows scheduled for the foreseeable future, those chomping at the bit to unleash the catharsis of a scary, frustrating year will have to wait.\n\nThe Recording Academy spoke with Rosenstock (from a safe distance) about the anxieties that fueled NO DREAM, the uncertain future of live music and the power artists wield through livestreaming.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2477291838/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://jeffrosenstock.bandcamp.com/album/no-dream\">NO DREAM by Jeff Rosenstock</a></iframe>\n\nSomething that's often said about your records is that they are \"prescient\" or \"a perfect album for the time.\" But could it be that you just write anxious records for an increasingly anxious world?\n\nI've never been tightlipped about being an anxious person. Part of the way I process it is to write, and then that makes me feel a little bit better. So that’s just how I’ve written songs since I was a kid. Maybe anxiety is just a little cooler now that we all realize things are bad. [Laughs.]\n\nWORRY. came out right before the 2016 election, and now NO DREAM was released during a pandemic. How do the anxieties differ between the two?\n\nI don't feel like I talked about anything Trumpy on WORRY. at all. I think the specific stuff on that record was gentrification and police killing people of color. Those were the things on that record I was firing on. The big one on this new record is that it seemed like we had a mass shooting every week. Over the last three or four years, we’ve had this neverending newscycle of bad things where it becomes static. It’s all there, all the time, and I don’t think our brains can process any of it. And in the shuffle, every week somebody goes to a school or church or a place where people gather and open fire with assault rifles, yet we still have assault rifles in this country because the gun lobby will always control our government.\n\nYou've been a very vocal critic of the exploitative model of the music industry. Have you noticed any changes, either positive or negative, during COVID?\n\nI need to say right off the bat that I do not think of the music industry in any way. I think about bands and my musician friends. The industry as a whole is set up to take power away from musicians. I don’t really know how we’ll come out of it. There was a second there where artists were doing their own livestreams on their own platforms, and it was cool. The first couple of days of it, where Ben Gibbard was like, “F**k it, I’m gonna sit in my living room and play songs for you,\" that was a cool thing. Then it slowly got co-opted by brands and tastemakers. And then bands are asking, \"Well, shit, this band is on this thing, why can't I get on that thing?\" And then it just becomes the same problem, where the promoter only books the talent they're friends with. On the artist's side, there’s a validity to want to be a part of those things because you’re reaching new audiences. I don’t really know how it’s all going to shake out. I think musicians have power to play to their fanbase right now, whenever they want, in a cool way.\n\nOn that note, Laura Stevenson, who plays on your new record, tweeted something about the superficial assistance of Spotify's donation button, which you echoed on Twitter. Can you talk about that?\n\nIn December, I was trying to figure out how to put merch on my Spotify page that wasn’t merch. It was just to donate five or 10 or 20 dollars. I do think in my heart people who use these services are starting to question why artists aren’t getting paid, so I wondered if you could present people with an option to do that. You have to sign up through this one company that approves your merch items; it’s a whole thing. I remember thinking, \"Oh, they just do not want people to donate.\" So, when they put [the donation button] up, I thought, \"You should have had that up there the whole f**king time.\" When COVID ends, that button should be there. It seems like the music industry figured out a way to have Napster, which they sued everybody over, but now they’re making the money and artists are making no money. The thing that's frustrating is that there isn’t really an alternative. There isn’t really a universal way to get music on people’s phones the way that you could rip an mp3 and put it up somewhere. It’s not just bad royalty rates; it’s that there’s a barrier between the artist and the listener.\n\nJeff Rosenstock performs at Pitchfork Festival in 2017\n\nPhoto by Michael Hickey/Getty Images\n\nA lot of artists have been talking about this being a very difficult time in which to be productive. You produce things at a rapid clip, with your solo records, and the live record, and Antarctico Verspucci, and scoring a cartoon. What drives you to produce at that rate?\n\nThe cartoon drives me at this point. When this went down, I had four weeks off from the cartoon between seasons. I was like, that’ll be great, I’ll have a month to get to know my new city—just drive around and go to the beach and recenter myself. Moving out here was a big thing to process. And then when this all went down, I hit up Ben Levin, one of the creators of \"Craig Of The Creek,\" and was just like, \"Eh, just send me the episodes now. I don’t care. I don’t want to just sit around and do nothing.\" I said yes to everything. Then once I started working, I was too distracted to think about anything else.\n\nHas working on \"Craig\" informed your own music at all?\n\nI think it’s a big part of why there's so much punk on this record. There were a handful of opportunities to write these 20- or 30-second pop punk or ska songs for the show. A lot of the score is basically trying to make the sounds of my youth feel cinematic and big. So I was thinking about that a lot. So, it’s that, combined with running and driving a lot, and the music I was listening to then.\n\nA theme that’s come through in your work, and comes up on this record too, is the idea of enjoying being hermetic. On the album's last line you say, \"I hate coming home / I hate leaving home.\" In the context of everything that’s happened over the last few months, and being forced to stay home, has that changed how averse you are to the world?\n\nYeah, for sure. Even before this, not being on tour for the last year, it made me miss traveling around and seeing people. But doesn’t everybody feel both ways? I feel like I exist as both an introvert and extrovert. I do like seeing people, but also, if it was fine with everybody for me to disappear for six months and it affected nothing at all, I'd be chill with that.\n\nI was looking at one of Amanda Fotes' photos of you the other day and it instantly reminded me of how difficult it would be to hold one of your live shows right now. Everyone in it is sweaty and touching you.\n\nYeah, I don’t know what I’m gonna do! [Laughs.] I'm always getting my ass-sweat on everybody while I'm crowdsurfing with a saxophone after playing for an hour and a half. How are we gonna do that? I don’t know! I think we can all agree on the future being pretty unpredictable. We don’t know when it’s gonna open up. We don’t know what the restrictions are gonna be, what’s gonna feel safe. We live in an age where there are no definite sources for shit anymore. We need real info and it’s not been a priority for our government to give us that info.\n\nAnd in the context of live music, I feel like we’re always hearing from some concert promoter about the future of music rather than a scientist.\n\nBut then, also, how is a scientist going to understand what happens at a concert? A scientist might be taken aback by the amount of jumping on each other that goes on at our shows.\n\nYou know who could solve this? Milo Aukerman. It’s the punk scientist's time to shine.\n\nYeah, where is he? He's the Venn Diagram cross-section!\n\nWould you play a drive-in concert?\n\nI'll do a drive-in concert. F**k it. Whatever’s the thing that makes sense. We don’t know what’s gonna be safe. Maybe I’ll wear a hazmat suit that’s got vents in it so I don’t suffocate, or it’s lined with ice pack material.\n\nYou'd be like Wayne Coyne in the bubble.\n\nOh yeah, Flaming Lips shows could still be going on, because he's safe in that bubble.\n\nDo you remember the last show you played?\n\nYeah, I played a house show in San Jose at my friends Laura and Gil’s basement. After everything went down, the three of us were texting, like, \"Uh oh, we just gathered a bunch of people in your basement.\" That was the last show we played. I wasn't particularly good but it was fun and I had a good time. I hope I can do it again.\n\nWayne Coyne Looks Back On 'The Soft Bulletin': \"I Wouldn't Want to Be In That State of Mind Ever Again\"\n\nIdol continues to reckon with his demons — they both grappled with addiction during the '80s — and the singer is open about those struggles on the record and the page. (Idol's 2014 memoir Dancing With Myself, details a 1990 motorcycle accident that nearly claimed a leg, and how becoming a father steered him to reject hard drugs. \"Bitter Taste,\" from his last EP, The Roadside, reflects on surviving the accident.)\n\nAlthough Idol and Stevens split in the late '80s — the skilled guitarist fronted Steve Stevens & The Atomic Playboys, and collaborated with Michael Jackson, Rick Ocasek, Vince Neil, and Harold Faltermeyer (on the GRAMMY-winning \"Top Gun Anthem\") — their common history and shared musical bond has been undeniable. The duo reunited in 2001 for an episode of \"VH1 Storytellers\" and have been back in the saddle for two decades. Their union remains one of the strongest collaborations in rock 'n roll history.\n\nWhile there is recognizable personnel and a distinguishable sound throughout a lot of his work, Billy Idol has always pushed himself to try different things. Idol discusses his musical journey, his desire to constantly move forward, and the strong connection that he shares with Stevens.\n\nSteve has said that you like to mix up a variety of styles, yet everyone assumes you're the \"Rebel Yell\"/\"White Wedding\" guy. But if they really listen to your catalog, it's vastly different.\n\nYeah, that's right. With someone like Steve Stevens, and then back in the day Keith Forsey producing... [Before that] Generation X actually did move around inside punk rock. We didn't stay doing just the Ramones two-minute music. We actually did a seven-minute song. [Laughs]. We did always mix things up.\n\nThen when I got into my solo career, that was the fun of it. With someone like Steve, I knew what he could do. I could see whatever we needed to do, we could nail it. The world was my oyster musically.\n\n\"Cage\" is a classic-sounding Billy Idol rocker, then \"Running From The Ghost\" is almost metal, like what the Devil's Playground album was like back in the mid-2000s. \"Miss Nobody\" comes out of nowhere with this pop/R&B flavor. What inspired that?\n\nWe really hadn't done anything like that since something like \"Flesh For Fantasy\" [which] had a bit of an R&B thing about it. Back in the early days of Billy Idol, \"Hot In The City\" and \"Mony Mony\" had girls [singing] on the backgrounds.\n\nWe always had a bit of R&B really, so it was actually fun to revisit that. We just hadn't done anything really quite like that for a long time. That was one of the reasons to work with someone like Sam Hollander [for the song \"Rita Hayworth\"] on The Roadside. We knew we could go [with him] into an R&B world, and he's a great songwriter and producer. That's the fun of music really, trying out these things and seeing if you can make them stick.\n\nI listen to new music by veteran artists and debate that with some people. I'm sure you have those fans that want their nostalgia, and then there are some people who will embrace the newer stuff. Do you find it’s a challenge to reach people with new songs?\n\nObviously, what we're looking for is, how do we somehow have one foot in the past and one foot into the future? We’ve got the best of all possible worlds because that has been the modus operandi of Billy Idol.\n\nYou want to do things that are true to you, and you don't just want to try and do things that you're seeing there in the charts today. I think that we're achieving it with things like \"Running From The Ghost\" and \"Cage\" on this new EP. I think we’re managing to do both in a way.\n\n**Obviously, \"Running From The Ghost\" is about addiction, all the stuff that you went through, and in \"Cage\" you’re talking about freeing yourself from a lot of personal shackles. Was there any one moment in your life that made you really thought I have to not let this weigh me down anymore?**\n\nI mean, things like the motorcycle accident I had, that was a bit of a wake up call way back. It was 32 years ago. But there were things like that, years ago, that gradually made me think about what I was doing with my life. I didn't want to ruin it, really. I didn't want to throw it away, and it made [me] be less cavalier.\n\nI had to say to myself, about the drugs and stuff, that I've been there and I've done it. There’s no point in carrying on doing it. You couldn't get any higher. You didn't want to throw your life away casually, and I was close to doing that. It took me a bit of time, but then gradually I was able to get control of myself to a certain extent [with] drugs and everything. And I think Steve's done the same thing. We're on a similar path really, which has been great because we're in the same boat in terms of lyrics and stuff.\n\nSo a lot of things like that were wake up calls. Even having grandchildren and just watching my daughter enlarging her family and everything; it just makes you really positive about things and want to show a positive side to how you're feeling, about where you're going. We've lived with the demons so long, we've found a way to live with them. We found a way to be at peace with our demons, in a way. Maybe not completely, but certainly to where we’re enjoying what we do and excited about it.\n\n[When writing] \"Running From The Ghost\" it was easy to go, what was the ghost for us? At one point, we were very drug addicted in the '80s. And Steve in particular is super sober [now]. I mean, I still vape pot and stuff. I don’t know how he’s doing it, but it’s incredible. All I want to be able to do is have a couple of glasses of wine at a restaurant or something. I can do that now.\n\nI think working with people that are super talented, you just feel confident. That is a big reason why you open up and express yourself more because you feel comfortable with what's around you.\n\nI remember when you went on \"Viva La Bam\" back in 2005 and decided to give Bam Margera’s Lamborghini a new sunroof by taking a power saw to it. Did he own that car? Was that a rental?\n\nI think it was his car.\n\nDid he get over it later on?\n\nHe loved it. [Laughs] He’s got a wacky sense of humor. He’s fantastic, actually. I’m really sorry to see what he's been going through just lately. He's going through a lot, and I wish him the best. He's a fantastic person, and it's a shame that he's struggling so much with his addictions. I know what it's like. It's not easy.\n\nMusically, what is the synergy like with you guys during the past 10 years, doing Kings and Queens of the Underground and this new stuff? What is your working relationship like now in this more sober, older, mature version of you two as opposed to what it was like back in the '80s?\n\nIn lots of ways it’s not so different because we always wrote the songs together, we always talked about what we're going to do together. It was just that we were getting high at the same time.We're just not getting [that way now] but we're doing all the same things.\n\nWe're still talking about things, still [planning] things:What are we going to do next? How are we going to find new people to work with? We want to find new producers. Let's be a little bit more timely about putting stuff out.That part of our relationship is the same, you know what I mean? That never got affected. We just happened to be overloading in the '80s.\n\nThe relationship’s… matured and it's carrying on being fruitful, and I think that's pretty amazing. Really, most people don't get to this place. Usually, they hate each other by now. [Laughs] We also give each other space. We're not stopping each other doing things outside of what we’re working on together. All of that enables us to carry on working together. I love and admire him. I respect him. He's been fantastic. I mean, just standing there on stage with him is always a treat. And he’s got an immensely great sense of humor. I think that's another reason why we can hang together after all this time because we've got the sense of humor to enable us to go forward.\n\nThere's a lot of fan reaction videos online, and I noticed a lot of younger women like \"Rebel Yell\" because, unlike a lot of other '80s alpha male rock tunes, you're talking about satisfying your lover.\n\nIt was about my girlfriend at the time, Perri Lister. It was about how great I thought she was, how much I was in love with her, and how great women are, how powerful they are.\n\nIt was a bit of a feminist anthem in a weird way. It was all about how relationships can free you and add a lot to your life. It was a cry of love, nothing to do with the Civil War or anything like that. Perri was a big part of my life, a big part of being Billy Idol. I wanted to write about it. I'm glad that's the effect.\n\nIs there something you hope people get out of the songs you've been doing over the last 10 years? Do you find yourself putting out a message that keeps repeating?\n\nWell, I suppose, if anything, is that you can come to terms with your life, you can keep a hold of it. You can work your dreams into reality in a way and, look, a million years later, still be enjoying it.\n\nThe only reason I'm singing about getting out of the cage is because I kicked out of the cage years ago. I joined Generation X when I said to my parents, \"I'm leaving university, and I'm joining a punk rock group.\" And they didn't even know what a punk rock group was. Years ago, I’d write things for myself that put me on this path, so that maybe in 2022 I could sing something like \"Cage\" and be owning this territory and really having a good time. This is the life I wanted.\n\nThe original UK punk movement challenged societal norms.
