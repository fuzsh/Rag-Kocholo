        "text": "\"Right Where It Belongs\" is the thirteenth track on the 2005 release With Teeth. Preview copies for media had it labeled \"Cages,\" though it's unknown whether that was a working title or just an anti-piracy measure [1].\n\nA re-work of the track by Martin Wav was featured in a trailer for The Game Awards 2022.[2]\n\nAppearances\n\nHalos\n\nWith Teeth\n\nBeside You In Time\n\nSeeds\n\nThe Definitive NIN - Quiet Tracks\n\nVersions\n\nRight Where It Belongs\n\nThis is the original album version. Heavily atmospheric, its opening ambience transitions from the end of \"Beside You In Time\" into its first quiet musical elements, a bouncing bassline and guitar riff accompanying a piano lead and soon Trent Reznor's melodic vocals. New melodies and changes join Reznor's choruses, but all of the layers seem muffled and distant throughout. The second verse is characterized by a unique sonic change only found in this NIN song: upon singing the last line of the verse, all the layers become much clearer, soon joined by a cheering crowd erupting as the second and final chorus begins. Reznor quietly and wordlessly accompanies the repeating final piano melody, which ends the song alone.\n\nRight Where It Belongs (Instrumental)\n\nRunning Time: 5:18\n\nReleased exclusively through Apple Music.\n\nRight Where It Belongs V2\n\nRunning Time: 5:04\n\nThis is an alternate version of the song, available on the UK and Japanese releases of With Teeth. More minimalistic than the original album version, it simply features a different vocal take accompanied by electric piano. Its structure and lyrics remain the same. This version was also available to download at remix.nin.com.\n\nRight Where It Belongs (Beside You In Time)\n\nThis version can be found on the Beside You In Time DVD. It is much quieter than the album version, losing the slightly abrasive synthesizers in exchange for a mellow piano.\n\nCover Versions\n\nRight Where I Belong\n\nIn June 2019, the anthology TV series Black Mirror aired the episode \"Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too\", which featured versions of \"Head Like A Hole\" and \"Right Where It Belongs\" with new lyrics written by Charlie Brooker and recorded by Miley Cyrus, entitled \"On A Roll\" and \"Right Where I Belong\" respectively. Cyrus also recorded direct covers of both songs, all of which were sanctioned and approved by Reznor - a rarity for any cover of Nine Inch Nails. The songs were recorded and released under the name \"Ashley O\", Cyrus' character name in the episode. The band also released a collaborative t-shirt on their website, featuring Brooker's new lyrics.\n\nLyrics\n\nSee me dancing on the stage that I built Spotlight on me shining strong Feel such happiness inside of my heart And it's all right here, right here in my song See my crew dancing around me Hear the audience’s screams Feel like I could jump right to the sky And just lose myself Lose myself inside a dream I got all these songs inside of my head Just creations of my own The rhythm in the song as I'm sleeping in my bed It's got me dancing on my feet See my crew dancing around me Hear the audience’s screams Feel like this whole world I love to know Is an elaborate dream And when I look at my reflection But it's all I wanted to be Feel like I could jump right to the sky And just lose myself Lose myself inside a dream\n\nLive\n\n\"Right Where It Belongs\" made its live debut on September 19, 2005. On the Fall 2005 and Winter 2006 legs of the Live: With Teeth tour, this song was the centerpiece of the 'slow section' of the concerts, as a curtain was dropped down in front of the stage, onto which video images compiled by Andrea Giacobbe were projected. It was always preceded by \"Eraser\" and followed by \"Beside You In Time\". The alternate V2 version was played very rarely on the NIN/JA Tour.\n\nLyrics\n\nSee the animal in his cage that you built Are you sure what side you're on? Better not look him too closely in the eye Are you sure what side of the glass you are on? See the safety of the life you have built Everything where it belongs Feel the hollowness inside of your heart And it's all Right where it belongs What if everything around you Isn't quite as it seems What if all the world you think you know Is an elaborate dream? And if you look at your reflection Is that all you want it to be? What if you could look right through the cracks Would you find yourself—find yourself afraid to see? What if all the world's inside of your head Just creations of your own? Your devils and your gods all the living and the dead And you're really all alone You can live in this illusion You can choose to believe You keep looking but you can't find the woods While you’re hiding in the trees What if everything around you Isn't quite as it seems What if all the world you used to know Is an elaborate dream? And if you look at your reflection Is that all you want it to be? What if you could look right through the cracks Would you find yourself—find yourself afraid to see?"
