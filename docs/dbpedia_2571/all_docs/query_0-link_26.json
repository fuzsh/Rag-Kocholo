Maybe knowing, or heard of Ayreon/Arjen Lucassen because of the singing of James on \"the human equation\"?\n\nI'm a big fan of both Dream Theater and Arjen (since he is the mastermind behind ayreon, star one, ambeon and now Stream of Passion) and they both make great and technical music which can make a big man cry\n\nAug 18, 2005 at 3:16 AM Post #79 of 84\n\n10068\n\nHeadphoneus Supremus\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 26, 2004\n\nPosts\n\n3,992\n\nLikes\n\n15\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by EvilDwarf\n\nHe is certainly trying his best and is enjoyable as far as the octaves don't go too high.

It gives it the 80s metal Power Ballad feel to it\n\nAug 18, 2005 at 12:20 PM Post #80 of 84\n\nrreynol\n\n100+ Head-Fier\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 1, 2005\n\nPosts\n\n444\n\nLikes\n\n10\n\nI am a relatively new DT fan. Two things I didn't see mentioned (i may be blind, they may have been) concerning DT albums. If you havent heard the offical bootleg of DT covering the entire Master of Puppets album, get it. I've seen it for sale on the web at various places. It's a live recording but it's great quality. As a long time fan of old Metallica, I love the DT twist on it. There are parts where it seems DT plays it better than Metallica themselves. The second album to get the is John Petrucci & Jordan Rudess - An Evening With John Petrucci & Jordan Rudess. It is an excellent display of Petrucci's guitar mastery.\n\nBtw, I'm listening to Scenes right now.\n\nAug 20, 2005 at 2:43 AM Post #81 of 84\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by EvilDwarf\n\nI have listened to countless other progressive metal bands and enjoyed many, but none of them could really compete with DT. Until last week I listened for the first time to Threshold - Subsurface. I was completly blown away . If you ask yourself how good a progressive album can be: your answer is there. Is almost too good to be true. Threshold is really an amazing band, with an excellent vocalist (you can't say that full-heartedly for DT) and a tighter a bit rougher sound than DT but very memorable songs.\n\nEvery DT fan should seriously try listening to one of their albums. Now I think I have found another band on equal ground with DT.\n\nI have to agree with you on this reco, Subsurface is one fantastic album, probably the best they've done in their distinguished career. A definite must for prog-metal fans.\n\nAug 20, 2005 at 5:45 AM Post #82 of 84\n\nKyPeN\n\n100+ Head-Fier\n\nJoined\n\nOct 5, 2003\n\nPosts\n\n357\n\nLikes\n\n29\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Iron_Dreamer\n\nI have to agree with you on this reco, Subsurface is one fantastic album, probably the best they've done in their distinguished career.

I would disagree that the vocalist is \"better\" than DTs (I worship the ground on which LaBrie walks though ) but to each his own. A must for a prog rock fan.\n\nOct 12, 2005 at 2:30 PM Post #83 of 84\n\nscottder\n\nHeadphoneus Supremus\n\nJoined\n\nNov 4, 2002\n\nPosts\n\n3,485\n\nLikes\n\n18\n\nWell I had heard a bit of the latest album and was quite impressed by what I heard. Octavarium is an excellent album begining to end. Question now is where to go from here in reguards to DT?\n\nI've never been a huge fan of \"Progressive Metal\", but these guys are excellent!\n\nScott"
