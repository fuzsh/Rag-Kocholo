        "text": "Dormant for decades under a succession of authoritarian regimes, Argentina's film industry - heartened by the nation's return to democracy four years ago - is enjoying an artistic renaissance.\n\nLast year, Maria Luisa Bemberg's ''Official Story'' won the Academy Award for best foreign film. Eliseo Subiela's ''Man Facing Southeast,'' now playing in New York at Cinema 1, won the International Critics' Award at the Toronto Film Festival. ''The King and His Movie'' by Carlos Sorin won the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival.\n\nHector Olivera's ''Night of the Pencils'' was showcased - and reviewed favorably - at the New Directors/New Films series that closed yesterday in New York at the Museum of Modern Art, where Fernando Solanas's ''Exile of Gardel'' received similar accolades a year earlier.\n\nMany of these films have dealt with the turbulent politics, the social and human concerns, of recent years in Argentina. Ms. Bemberg's ''Official Story'' looked at the horror of children who vanished during the military regime that ruled the country from 1976 to 1983. The desaparecidos - this time students - were also the subject of ''Night of the Pencils,'' and ''Exile of Gardel'' looked at Argentine expatriates in Paris during the same era.\n\nIn the first flush of artistic liberty, which came gradually in the final years of the military government and grew with the inauguration of President Raul Alfonsin at the end of 1983, the films that attracted attention were those that touched political and human-rights themes.\n\n''We intellectuals are the conscience of the people and the people tend to have bad memories,'' said Mr. Olivera. ''We are obligated to refresh them from time to time.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
