        "text": "Over 453 films have been made focusing on the topic of the last dictatorship in Argentina (1976-1983), otherwise known worldwide as the Dirty War. This time period is characterized by the vile human rights abuses committed by the military junta against those who opposed the government, leading to the disappearances of 30.000 people, many of whom left children behind. These children were often forced to grow up, giving up their childhood, due to their parents' militancy. In the national story of the dictatorship, these children's stories and experiences have often been forgotten. This thesis will investigate the portrayal of the last Argentine dictatorship through cinema, from the perspective of children who grew up during the dictatorship, often children of the disappeared. These films often focus on the recreation of identity, their disappeared parents, and the loss of childhood innocence. Through fiction and documentary film, these filmmakers are able to use a self-reflexive process to recreate their identity and self-represent their own stories, rather than fitting into the narratives forced upon them.\n\nResumen Este artículo constituye el diario del proceso de pro-ducción de un documental que busca crear un mapa cinematográfico de los imaginarios locales de la posdictadura argentina. De este modo, traza el desarrollo y despliegue de un proyecto que utiliza el cine como medio, tanto en su recepción como en su po-tencial creativo para documentar y dar cuenta de ma-nera artística de fenómenos sociales que permiten comprender el multifacético, entreverado y polisémi-co conjunto de imaginarios sociales de la memoria de la dictadura cívico-militar argentina y la consiguiente transición democrática. Este viaje cinematográfico supone un ingreso al laberinto dantesco que se de-sarrolla en el espacio liminal entre lo imaginario y lo real. En este despliegue, experiencias vividas de manera íntima resuenan en demostraciones públicas del placer y del trauma que conducen a un espacio aún por definir entre el documental y la ficción. Abstract This article constitutes the diary of a documentary in the making, one that aims to create a cinematic map of the local imaginaries of post-dictatorship transition. The unfolding project it charts uses film as a medium-both its reception by audiences and its creative potential as a mode of documenting and expressing social phenomena artistically-in order to map and produce fresh understanding of the multifaceted and layered, polysemous set of social imaginaries of the memory of Argentina's civic-military dictatorship and the ensuing post-dictatorship transition to democracy. This cinematic journey into the Dantesque labyrinth of the imaginary unfolds in the liminal space between the imagination and the real. In doing so, intimate lived experience resonates through public displays of trauma and pleasure, taking us into a yet-to-be-defined space that is neither documentary nor fiction.\n\nThis book's primary goal is to critically examine traditional approaches to testimonial cinema (trauma theory and subaltern studies), to propose an alternate interpretive framework at the intersection of semiotics and theories of affect, and to re-read Argentine films produced between 1983 and 2016 from this latter standpoint. I expect that this renewed analysis will contribute to understanding the specific place of first-person narratives in contemporary Argentine culture and to overcoming the existing fatigue surrounding the topic (“el temita,” as Mariana Eva Perez, also known as “la princesa montonera,” has brilliantly called the fossilized discourse on the dictatorship). Although I focus on Argentina, my readings also apply to other contexts in which narratives about recent political conflicts have shifted from alternative versions of history to hegemonic, iconic accounts: Spanish, Chilean, Uruguayan, and Brazilian post-dictatorship narratives; accounts of apartheid South Africa; and Holocaust testimonies, to name but a few. I see Argentina as a case study for rethinking testimonial cinema in a larger context, one that goes beyond trauma and subaltern theories. I also believe that an approach combining semiotics and affect theories could be helpful in pursuing a broader ideological analysis of the links between film and historical representation.\n\nThis article draws out the implications of Luis César D'Angiolillo's Potestad (Argentina, 2002) for contemporary debates on post-dictatorship memory in Argentina, as well as for current theories of spectatorship in film. Potestad forms part of a revisionist agenda that calls for a greater heterogeneity in post-dictatorship memory and seeks to reposition the violent repression of the most recent military regime within the broader context of the ideological conflicts of the 1970s. While the film initially appears to call for a psychoanalytical interpretation of its events and characters, it ultimately insists on a political reading; moreover, my analysis suggests that it effectively points to the insufficiency of psychoanalytical models of spectatorship to explain how meaning is constructed in film.\n\nThis thesis analyzes a series of films that, in different ways, seek to represent the last Argentine dictatorship. The possibility of interpreting the thematic and formal recurrences of the films as a defining characteristic of a specific genre is posed as a first hypothesis. The second hypothesis postulates the possibility of relating certain aesthetic and rhetorical changes of the series to certain socio-political processes. After presenting a general overview of some of the various forms in which the relationship between cinema and society has been theorized before, the work proposes the instance of enunciation as a principle of articulation between textual and social systems, analysing the subjects involved in each of these levels and the relationship that can be established between them. The apparatus of enunciation (between textual figures), which can be related to the reading contract (between social subjects) can also be associated with the notion of genre. In this context, the thesis explores the possibility of a redefinition of cinematographic genres from the perspective of the Semiotics of Passions. Having established in the previous chapters the theoretical and methodological basis, the second part of the work consists of the analysis of the enunciation in the films of the corpus, in order to establish the main characteristics of the reading contract proposed to the spectator. The analysis starts with the consideration of the genre known in television as \"docudrama\", paying particular attention to the relationship between what is filmed and the \"real\", that this genre seeks to establish. This is followed by the partial conclusions of the analysis of the totality of films included in the corpus. A first systematisation of the general characteristics of the films considered allows for a definition of a new genre which we termed \"documelodrama\".\n\nWhile much has been written about Argentine political documentary during the 1960s and 1970s, less has been said about post-dictatorship political documentaries. This article will consider the films Cuarentena: Exilio y regreso (1983) and Juan, como si nada hubiera sucedido (1987) by Carlos Echeverría, an independent filmmaker who focuses on the return to democracy and reflections on the recent past. Cuarentena: Exilio y regreso is about Osvaldo Bayer's experiences and fervent desire to return to his homeland. Osvaldo Bayer is an Argentine writer who was exiled in Germany during the dictatorship. Juan, como si nada hubiera sucedido is one of the most important Argentine films of the last thirty years, as it is among the first documentaries to address the subject of the forced disappearance of people during the last military dictatorship. The film contains interviews with military officers who held high positions during the period, asking them about the roles they played in political disappearances.\n\nFurther to the recent handover of the Naval School of Mechanics (ESMA), Argentina's most notorious centre for the clandestine torture and assassination of leftist militants under the dictatorship of 1976–83, to the city of Buenos Aires, in order to create on the premises a 'Space for Memory' , debates on the proper commemoration of the recent past have gained momentum. In the course of these, it has become clear that there is currently no consensus among the human rights organizations, let alone Argentine society at large, on how the former sites of state terrorism can be adequately 'recovered' , or what the purpose and function of such a recovery might be. Rather than as a shortcoming, however, this impossibility of closure, and of the monumentalization of a social consensus about the past in museal forms, might be taken as an opportunity to problematize some of the politics and material poetics underpinning the contemporary 'memorial museum'. The article therefore analyses the principal arguments and positions voiced in the debate about ESMA with a view to their attitudes (explicit or implicit) towards the museum-form as such, and the conclusions that might be derived from these in the context of contemporary debates about 'postmemory' , 'secondary witnessing' and the politics of empathy at the museum."
