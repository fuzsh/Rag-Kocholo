        "text": "This chapter takes up a number of themes as it traces filmmaking during and after the Argentine economic crisis of 1998–2002. It looks especially at the ways that the films from this period intersect with some of the central tenets of New Latin American Cinema’s notion of political film—especially since two of its key figures (Octavio Getino and Fernando Solanas) remained active during the period. And it also analyzes the different ways filmmakers navigate corporate realities while attempting to find funding and markets for their work. The chapter compares a selection of films from three directors (Israel Adrián Caetano, Pablo Trapero, Juan José Campanella) that each offers different models for Argentine filmmaking in the neoliberal era."
