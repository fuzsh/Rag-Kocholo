        "text": "When I arrived in Argentina in October of 2018, I didn’t know much about the country or its people. Sure, as an American, I had heard of “Maradona,” “Messi,” “gauchos,” and “tango,” but I clearly had very little understanding of what the culture of the nation was really like. I quickly began to be inundated with the many cultural items and elements that Argentines are so proud of. The first thing that really stuck out to me was the food. I was shocked at how Italian the food seemed to be. I don’t know what I was expecting, but it certainly wasn’t pizza and pasta almost everyday. It was there in that moment when I first really started to think about Argentina’s relationship with Europe, and just how obsessed they are with that heritage. Over the next year and a half, while I lived in the west side of Buenos Aires, I continued to hear more and more about the country’s ties to Italy, Spain, England, Germany, and France. It seemed as though the average Porteño considered themselves to be just like them, almost more like them than their South American counterparts.\n\nWhen Netflix entered the Argentine market in 2011, it was entering into this world; it was entering into this social climate, this national identity. And, in 2016, when the company announced that it would begin producing original productions in the South American country, it knew it had to take into account this landscape when creating content. Drawing upon principles of cultural study and textual analysis, examining national identity and culture, and exploring how Argentina depicts various members of society, I’d like to look at how Netflix’s original Argentine productions create new senses of identity and contribute to the national identity as a whole. I’d like to look specifically at shows like Edha (2018), Apache: La Vida de Carlos Tevez (2019), División Palermo (2023), and Maradona: Bendito Sueño (2021), as case studies. As Costelló states, “in television fiction serials, the nation functions like a stage,” and I’d like to explore what is “performed” for the audience (316).\n\nArgentina’s Obsession with Europe\n\nTo begin, I believe it’s important to touch upon this European sense of identity found in Argentina, and later see how that relates to their sense of “modernity.” It’s no secret that Argentina has been “Europhilic” for a long time now. In the early 1800s, fresh off of their newly found independence from Spain, Argentina began to adopt many philosophical, political, and artistic principles from the Old World. France of all countries, which didn’t have any formal ties to Argentina, became the country from which the majority of elites looked to emulate Buenos Aires and Argentine society as a whole: “in the early nineteenth century, [Europhilia] developed into an ideological belief that Argentina could best prove its place among the “civilized” nations of the world only through the emulation of European—especially French—tastes, ideas, and art” (Daughton 837). This idea that modernity and civilization came from Europe would prove to be extremely important for the development of the national identity later on.\n\nArgentina’s early fascination with France bled into the more physical manifestations of the country as well. The government became obsessed with the idea of building Buenos Aires in the image of Paris. There was a dramatic and rapid change in architecture that used “the methods of Georges Haussmann, the prefect of the Seine who oversaw the rebuilding of Paris during the Second Empire, [which] became the model for creating a consciously ‘modern’ Buenos Aires,” especially in a physical tangible sense (Daughton 840). The change was so dramatic and so well done that many French visitors wrote that when they stepped off the boat into Buenos Aires, they felt as if they “found [themselves] back home,” in a country with similar look, feel, culture, and even weather (837). They even claimed that Buenos Aires had the “most beautiful and elegant” women in the world, “except Paris, of course.” (845).\n\nI think it’s important to note that the Argentine obsession with Europe and France at the time was more mutual than one would imagine. The French came to love and respect the “Paris of South America,” seeing it almost as a “little brother,” or their “creation,” something for which they felt immense pride. Juxtaposed with their colonial holdings of the day, France also felt a special connection to the fact that they didn’t have to force French assimilation on the South Americans; the French ​“were often proud of the fact that the Parisian feel of Buenos Aires was the result of conscious choices made by porteños,” themselves (842).\n\nHowever, all of this intense Francophilia started to wane in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as more and more immigrants from other European countries came to Argentina. Massive influxes of Italian, Spanish, and German immigrants started to change the cultural landscape and allegiances in the young country. It was here that this large mixture of cultural identities, as well as Argentina’s massive wealth at the time, caused a uniquely Argentine sense of civilization to form. There was pride for a modern nation that embraced its “cosmopolitan immigrant makeup,” almost combining the best of Europe in a new home (848, my emphasis).\n\nOverall, from the very conception of the country, Argentina was a European-inspired nation. With that, there is a strong association with the idea that it is “modern,” and “civilized” as well, displaying cultural, economic, and artistic tendencies of its western and southern European heritage. Because it is made up of many immigrants from multiple European countries it is not particularly allegiant to any single one, rather it feels like it is connected to the continent as a whole.\n\nThis sense of European identity is deeply ingrained in the Argentine psyche and is very much still present today. In 2021, Argentine president Alberto Fernandez, in an attempt to show solidarity with the Spanish prime minister stated, “the Mexicans came from the Indians, the Brazilians came from the jungle, but we Argentines came from the ships. And they were ships that came from Europe” (Reed). Setting aside the controversial racist nature of the comment for a moment, it’s key to acknowledge not only Argentina’s self identification as a European nation, but also that it makes them starkly distinct from their South American neighbors. Brazil and Mexico are by far the two biggest cultural influences in Latin America, so Fernandez’s classification of them as different from his own country speaks volumes: not only does Argentina see itself as European, but it sees itself barely as South American.\n\nAdditionally, Fernandez’s comments are strikingly similar to the typical classification of races that Quijano describes as related to coloniality of power, and race as a construct. Despite Europeans encountering many distinct indigenous peoples of both Africa and America with their own cultures, customs, history, languages, etc, 300 years after they had arrived in the Americas they exclusively referred to them as either “Indians” or “Blacks” (Quijano 219). It’s remarkable how that sentiment is still literally shared today by the leader of a country that claims to be quite progressive. And he’s not the only one. Similarly, the former president of Argentina, Mauricio Macri was also quoted saying that in Argentina, “we are all descendants of Europeans.” This caused a lot of uproar as members of minority groups claimed they were being left out of the conversation. We will continue to look at race and how it affects Argentine media later on.\n\nArgentina’s Media Landscape\n\nSimilarly, I think it’s appropriate to describe the context and background of the media environment Netflix was encountering when they ventured down south. This will help to better synthesize knowledge of the cultural and economic landscapes of the media world at the time when streaming services arrived in Argentina. Before Netflix’s expansion into the country, El Trece and Telefe had long become duopolistic in the world of production, with both of their conceptions dating back to the 60s. In the 1980s, “pay TV” was also introduced in the country, and it was actually fairly widely adopted, with about 77% of the country using it. This was particularly important for Netflix, because, as a nation with one of the highest rates of paid TV in Latin America, they saw the opportunity to capitalize on a market that was already used to paying for their content (Mastrini 2).\n\nArgentina was quickly able to amass a subscriber base in the country for a few reasons. First, they had the element of “first-mover” advantage, meaning they were just the first streamer to enter the market, with Amazon and HBO Go lagging behind by a few years. Second, they were able to offer a product of high quality, with personalized recommendations and no ads, for a “relatively cheap price,” helping to grow the subscriber base early as consumers saw the service mostly as an “add-on” to other TV they were already paying for. This usually tended to be members of the upper middle class. And finally, once other telecom and “pay TV” providers had decided that Netflix wasn’t going to shake up the industry too much, they decided to partner with the streaming service, allowing older shows in their catalog to get a second life. “One of the pioneers was the cable tv company Telecentro, which in 2016 reached a deal with Netflix to enable its more than 600,000 subscribers to access [Netflix] content bundled in their subscription,” and Telecentro even included an exclusive Netflix button on their remotes that allowed users to access the service without a separate device (Mastrini 6). This was especially important as it allowed for lower income households to not have to spend quite as much for Netflix, also allowing subscriber rates to grow.\n\nThe type of content wanted by the masses was also very clear. Like many other Latin American industries, telenovelas were king in Argentina in the early 2010s, and this was the climate that Netflix entered in 2011. This is confirmed by the numbers themselves, especially in the years leading up to the release of Netflix’s first Argentine original. According to the Argentina data in the Obitel Yearbooks of 2016, 2017, and 2018, the years leading up to the release of the Netflix Original, shows categorized as “telenovelas” accounted for about 2/3 of the country’s top ten most titles of each year. And, many of the most popular series not cited as “telenovelas,” could be considered by some as a “mini-series” novela, like Moises y Los Diez Mandamientos, from Brazil, which held the top spot for most watched show in Argentina for two years in a row.\n\nNetflix also signed deals with local production companies, most notably Pol-ka, which is El Trece’s go-to producer for their biggest telenovela hits. Despite promises to produce Netflix originals partnered with these companies there hadn’t been much in production until Puerta 7 and El Reino at the start of the 2020s.\n\nWith that being said, now in 2023, there are currently 34 Argentine Netflix originals, with 64 titles in total from Argentina on the platform. However, many of these titles are comedy specials or movies, with only a few series in total. Also, as many know, Netflix can be pretty lenient with their usage of the term “original,” making it seem that they were involved with the production of something even if they really only were only the distributor. Overall, Netflix’s catalog of shows contains mostly miniseries or short series from Argentina, mostly relating to crime, soccer, or both. Biopic series also seem to be a very popular genre among all streaming services in the region. The average Netflix subscriber in Argentina tends to be upper middle class and slightly more educated.\n\nAs part of my cultural analysis, I’d mostly like to focus on questions of race and class, all relating back to my aforementioned idea of Argentina being a South American country that yearns to be European. I’d like to look at each show individually and explore each of the themes and how they present themselves in Netflix originals.\n\nEdha (2018)\n\nThere’s no better place to start than with Edha, Netflix’s first venture into original programming in Argentina. In 2016, when it was announced that the show would be produced with Netflix, many in Argentina understood that Edha would represent a global message that they wanted to send to the world. In a sense, it was one of the first times in the 21st century that they would have the opportunity to broadcast on a global network a story that represented their nation as a whole. The head of Netflix’s international series knew the gravity of the situation and knew that it would be a huge opportunity to share the culture with the world: “The fashion and music scene in Buenos Aires is unique, sexy and exciting and Daniel Burman and his team are among Argentina’s most gifted creators. We can’t wait to present Edha and her dramatic story to Netflix members around the rest of the world” (Jafaar).\n\nEdha tells the story of a single mother, business mogul, fashion designer, and lover named Edha. She comes from a long line of successful women, and, while struggling to maintain good relationships with her daughter and ex-husband, becomes obsessed with one of her models and they become the objects of one another’s desires.\n\nOn a racial side, every character in the show is white. I understand that the demographics of Argentina are mostly white but the idea of whiteness being the “norm” is so widely accepted that it seems like they don’t even really think about it that much. In Edha, this is represented by the “dark and mysterious” character, Teo. Teo is the seductive, conniving, and “tall and handsome” model who proves to be Edha’s love (or lust) interest during the show. He is vaguely self-described as “not Argentinian,” as just a general immigrant, also coming from a much lower class than the titular character. It would be expected that this man would probably be an immigrant from somewhere else in South America, potentially a country that “came from the jungle or the Indians,” but in the end he was portrayed by a white, Spanish actor/model named Andres Velencoso. It seems that even when the country was supposed to portray someone that was an immigrant and who’s main character identity was the fact that they were an “other,” the character was even “whiter” than the Argentines themselves.\n\nI also think it’s interesting to note that there was no specific country mentioned as to where the man came from. Is it because they don’t even want to mention other South American countries as to not be “guilty by association?” This idea of complete whitewashing includes the fact that not a single person of color was in the cast. One could argue that this is an accurate representation of the country’s culture, as more than 95% of the country considers themselves to be white, but still it seems bizarre, especially from a country that has received many South American immigrants in the last few decades.\n\nHistorically, certain Latin American television programs, like Xica from Brazil, have used their platform as a way to present the public with a progressive racial examination “disguised as entertainment.” These certain progressive programs “allow[ed] viewers to reconnect with a social being different from the one daily presented to them” in more mainstream forms of institutionalized media, like a newspaper for example (Benavides 42). However, it feels like Edha might be doing the opposite when it comes to race. Instead of ignoring Argentina’s troubling past with both slaves and indigenous populations, one would think that a more progressive show might be able to address those issues. However, it seems like Argentina might be avoiding the topic altogether, “reconstruct[ing] a postcolonial reality in a way that will allow them to ‘not go insane from their not understanding the reason for so much pain in their hearts’” (Benavides 45). It seems better just to avoid the situation altogether, and focus on the other parts of their identity that contribute to their sense of “modernity.”\n\nTherefore, the other elements of the story are incredibly forward-thinking. The titular character, Edha, is a powerful single mother who has built a fashion empire and enjoys the benefits of being in power. The idea that a woman could be in power and become a successful businesswoman is part of this idea of modernity that the show (and the country as a whole) wants to portray. Similarly, the depiction of Teo, the model, rising from the depths of poverty and becoming a successful figure in the upper class of society also proves Argentina’s place in the modern economy, creating their version of the “American Dream.” Additionally, multiple characters are openly homosexual and really face no repercussions for that fact.\n\nDespite the success of the top shows in Argentina in the years leading up to the release of Edha, the show really only takes vague themes like seduction and family drama into its process, stripping back other similarities to traditional Argentine novelas, as to differentiate itself for the more modern, more educated, upper-class Netflix demographic.\n\nIn terms of its territorial representation, I think it’s interesting to note the absences of the other territories in the region. No other countries in South America are mentioned, even when the characters are traveling or there are defined “immigrants” on screen. Instead, Edha’s involvement in fashion week in Paris and Milan are both mentioned, and mostly Buenos Aires’ “Paris of South America” architecture and sprawling highways/infrastructure are shown in the establishing shots.\n\nIn terms of cultural proximity, I believe the show’s main subject matter is the best example of its claim to be more modern. There are very few elements of society that are seen as more modern than high fashion. I think the idea that a country has the means and abilities to invest in art and more “high brow” culture is a sign of modernity and is usually associated with the west, or western influenced countries like Japan. As mentioned before, in my opinion, Edha does everything it can to place Argentina on a level playing field with major powers of the modern west, like France, Italy, and the United States, specifically using fashion and high society culture to do so.\n\nOf course there are exceptions to this idea of “European modernity” in the show as well. The depiction of some of the poverty and especially the sweatshop that burns down would definitely not align with a clean, modern brand image of Argentina. However, the characters that are involved in the crime and the misconduct are usually side characters and of lower economic status. In the end, the main characters of the show, those in charge, all come from high culture Buenos Aires society and are seen wearing expensive clothing and driving luxury cars.\n\nApache: La Vida de Carlos Tevez (2019)\n\nThe next show I’d like to explore is Apache: La Vida de Carlos Tevez. Released in 2019, Apache tells the childhood story of Carlos Tevez, a renowned Argentine soccer player who would go on to have success on the field in Europe and in the top leagues in the world. Tevez, a national hero in Argentina, grew up in the country’s most dangerous slum, a villa called “Fuerte Apache,” or “The Apache Fort.” The series recounts his dangerous and tumultuous upbringing in a world of drugs, violence, and sex. Apache represents a different form of national identity than what Edha sets out to do. Instead of depicting the high society of Buenos Aires, it depicts the lowest possible.\n\nApache is particularly interesting as it highlights an intersection between race, class, and perhaps the most important cultural element of Argentina: football, or soccer. Carlos Tevez is not explicitly of Afro-descent, but he definitely is of a darker complexion than many other Argentines. This is also the case with another national figure, and another show I would like to reference here, Diego Maradona in Amazon Prime’s Maradona: Bendito Sueño. Both Tevez and Maradona were considered “negritos,” especially while growing up in each of their own rough neighborhoods, Apache and Fiorito, respectively. Like many other Latin American countries, mestizaje can be a deeply entrenched and complicated topic, and the colonial racial hierarchy can still be very prevalent in the modern world. Like “Black Cinderella,” these characters in both series are considered “member[s] of [Argentina]’s elite when identified by [status or accomplishment], [and] treated as a lowly, powerless member of society when identified by race” (Hanchard 166). It’s actually quite an interesting claim coming from Netflix, and perhaps the closest we will get to seeing the platform address an issue of race head on. Often throughout the series, Carlos’ race is grouped together with his lower social status, making it harder to analyze on its own. But, that fact in and of itself speaks volumes to the racial and social hegemony of the nation.\n\nWith that being said, Apache looks to appeal to international, modern audiences in a different way, by promoting the idea of “quality TV. ” Like Edha, Apache seeks to use conventions not found in telenovelas or network TV to separate itself and align it with “higher quality” media. It does so in the form of violence. Apache is extremely graphic, with depictions of shootouts, stranglings, and executions in almost every episode. There are depictions of children being killed, unborn babies being shot, and children even committing murder. But, it is all done using “extreme violence [as a means] to a profound artistic end” (McCabe 90). Add the fact that a real life interview with Carlos Tevez about the show precedes every episode, and all of a sudden the “explicit violence [is] not merely some ‘ratings stunt’ but ‘the only way to remain true to the complex reality of [Carlos]’s life’” (McCabe 90). In this way, they are also probably “car bombing history” as they are tasked with creating “a history lesson as well as a compelling drama,” which probably means that the show warps reality slightly to fit its agenda (Britto 177).\n\nEver since HBO produced The Sopranos and Sex and the City, quality television has been, for better or for worse, associated with graphic depictions of real life, and Apache contains it all. To avoid the melodrama and “cheesiness” often associated in the U.S. and Europe with telenovelas, Apache is grounded, brutal, concise, and aesthetically beautiful, validating itself by calling upon already established “‘high-end’ media—theater, European art cinema and painting—to determine and legitimize” its place in high culture (McCabe 88).\n\nThe people committing the acts of violence in the show are also quite telling. The violence and misconduct are always reserved to those who are stuck at the bottom of the social class hierarchy and are reserved to characters that don’t make it “out” of the slum. All the characters that end the series with a chance to improve their socio-economic status and “escape” from Fuerte Apache are never involved in drugs or commit acts of violence in the show. It’s almost as if the message is that in order to gain higher status and reach success, one must “play by the rules” and behave well, no exceptions.\n\nThis is showcased by the fate of Carlos’ best friend Danilo who, despite having a lot of potential on the pitch and moving in the right direction in life, ultimately dies as he is consumed with rage and vengeance and commits a violent murder. This “convention presented..is not a mere coincidence. The approach to the nation is politically and commercially designed,” or in other words, the message for the nation itself is that only by playing by society’s rules will one ever find success (Castelló 309). This is particularly important in the “recipe” of creating a modern, Euroecntric, nation, as violence, chaos, and a lack of “civilized” behavior should always be punished on screen. In fact, the civilizing of this kind of “barbaric” behavior was one of the most common, racist motivations for the colonization of many lands by European nations, so it fits right on brand.\n\nDivisión Palermo, Community Squad (2023)\n\nNetflix’s most recent entry into the Argentine original category is called División Palermo, or Community Squad. Community Squad tells the story of Felipe Rozenfeld, a young man who’s at a crossroads in his life when his backpack with a lot of money gets stolen. When he goes to file a police report he accidentally gets interviewed and hired to be part of Community Squad, a new civilian police-like force. The catch is that the force is made up entirely of minorities in some way or another, and they end up getting involved with some actual violent criminals by mistake. It’s an irreverent, workplace action- comedy kind of like Brooklyn 99.\n\nI was drawn to analyze this particular series for a couple of reasons. First, it is Netflix’s most recent original in Argentina and would provide the best look at the current Netflix strategy for nation building in the country. Second, the very nature of the cast and the premise allows for an in-depth look at how Argentina classifies “minorities” and what they want to say about those communities.\n\nOverall, the show’s depiction of the characters is tricky. Most of the characters that make up the Community Squad are actually just disabled in some way or another, like being blind, in a wheelchair, largely overweight, or missing a limb, etc. But the other minorities include a transgender woman, a person with dwarfism, an immigrant (the only racial minority, probably from an Andean country like Bolivia or Peru), and Felipe, who only has a Jewish last name (it’s played as a joke that he even gets involved). Almost all of the characters that are in the squad are of a lower economic status, as that’s really the only reason they would be participating in this job. The show does a pretty decent job at addressing a few of the concerns of these characters and their respective situations in relation to their minority identity, but the overall way they are depicted is still hard to pin down. In some ways, it feels very progressive that Netflix has chosen to give a platform for these minorities, but in other ways, it feels almost like the display of a “freak show,” or a blatant celebration of these people as “the other” in almost a tokenistic way. It is reminiscent of the 2017 film The Greatest Showman, in which many marginalized groups were given their “15 minutes” in the spotlight while the rest of the main characters and people in positions of power were depicted as white and straight.\n\nCommunity Squad feels similar. In order to maintain this idea that Argentina is a modern European nation, all of the characters in power and higher up in society are clearly fitting the hetero-normative, white model, and the minorities are all kind of grouped together as bumbling idiots who are there for laughs. I understand that that’s the point of the show, yet to me it does little to truly bring Argentina into progressive modernity. Instead, it feels as if their early Europhilia is still affecting the way in which minorities are depicted.\n\nIn some ways though, I understand that the show itself may be a critique, calling out the way these minorities have been treated in the past. There definitely are a fair share of characters in the show that make fun of the minorities specifically for what makes them different, allowing sympathy to be felt. It seems sometimes as though the creators of the show were “attacking social conventions, [seeking] to win over [a] more sophisticated audience that the industry qualifies as ‘quality’” (Smith 59). This is definitely on brand with Netflix’s targeted audience, as mentioned before, of more educated, upper middle class citizens.\n\nHowever, there are also so many minority types represented that each one doesn’t really get enough screen time to fully flesh out a three dimensional character. They are reduced to stereotypes. The one racial minority, Mario, is seen as just “not from Argentina” and reckless, and that’s basically the extent of his character development. Again, the racial question in Argentina is extremely difficult to address and it seems like avoiding it altogether is again the choice of action.\n\nPerhaps the most telling sign of Community Squad’s campaign for modernity is its direct references and homages to other successful American and European workplace situational comedies. Its format, content, and tone are very reminiscent of The Office, Parks and Recreation, Community, and Brooklyn 99, just to name a few. An attempt to adapt a very modern style of comedy for an Argentine audience is perhaps what showcases their plea to be a modern European nation the most.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn the end, it is clear to me that Netflix and their original content has played a big role not only in the way that Argentines view themselves on the global landscape but also how they wish others to perceive them. Of the shows that were previously mentioned, all of them, and the majority of the other Netflix shows made in Argentina, set out to create a very modern identity for the country, one that is consistent with their Eurocentric past. Additionally, the shows were packaged, structured, and shot like more modern American and European shows of high quality, which helped to depict Argentine media on that same level.\n\nWhether or not Netflix made the shows take on more traditional American TV packages, with about 10 episodes per season, etc, is probably more of an economic question, but I don’t think the creators of these shows were complaining. Any associations with Netflix’s other successful European catalog entries like Casa de Papel would be more welcomed than any other South American comparisons. North American comparisons would also be welcomed with open arms.\n\nSimilarly, the branding and marketing around the shows were equated more to Netflix’s other more serious dramas or modern comedies. This was done in a way to avoid other comparisons with melodramatic soap operas, which much of the rest of the world might consider “low brow” and particularly associated with South America. The idea of “quality TV” as mentioned by McCabe and Acass is also present through the show’s depictions of graphic content. All of the shows analyzed were graphic in one way or another, whether that be in sexual content, violence, language, or all of the above.\n\nOverall, these selected narratives are naturalizing the idea of Argentina being a modern, European nation. From the very beginning of their history as an independent country, Argentina has been obsessed with Europe and being equal in their eyes. And, in many ways, these shows attempt to do just that. The shows are generally progressive, of “high quality,” and depict the nation as very modern, by a Eurocentric definition. As mentioned before though, Argentina’s complicated history and present with race makes the topic a little bit difficult to deal with when it comes to their media, and it seems like the almost complete avoidance of the subject is the course of action that best suits their needs. I am interested to see if this changes going forward.\n\nArgentina has long been Europhilic, and it seems like their country has built part of its modern image, through Netflix, on that very fact.\n\nSources\n\nBenavides, H.
