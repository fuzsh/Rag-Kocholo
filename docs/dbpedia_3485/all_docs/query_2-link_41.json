It sounds easy. It isn’t. Only the good poets make it seem exceedingly simple. In “A small, monumental bead,” Zach Tackett seems to effortlessly guide us into his written world for a closer look.\n\nAs soon as I started to read this poem, I was taken in. I wanted to know where I was, suddenly surrounded by such sensuous description. The inside of a plant? The rough edge of a limb? Did I even care? Admittedly not really – I am happiest when a poem’s language is the first thing that intrigues. No phoneme here is left unconsidered, and the pull between such duos as small and monumental, blood and bone, amalgamate and whirlpools, and ash and collapse kept me returning for the reverberations.\n\nTackett knows the distance a little alliterative tension can take us toward feeling the poem from the inside, toward really getting into its skin. “A small, monumental bead” is about showing the world to be as strange and wonderful as it really is, about taking what might normally seem familiar and holding up to the glare. Is it really so usual? Is there really nothing to remark? No, resolutely no. In Tackett’s poem we are “surrounded in an ocean,” where “shadows are hooked / by accident.” This is a world I’d like to stay in. I can’t wait to see what else Tackett writes.\n\nAndy Stallings & Dan Rosenberg\n\nMarch 12, 2015, 5:30 p.m.\n\nLuparello Lecture Hall, Sis and Herman Dupre Science Pavilion\n\nAndy Stallings lives in Massachusetts, where he is faculty at Deerfield Academy.

He was born in Cuba in 1940, the son of Jewish parents who migrated in the late 1920s from Poland and Czechoslovakia.
