        "text": "In the recent history of Argentina's dictatorship so many people were kidnapped and tortured by right-wing death squads and then vanished without trace that a grisly noun came into common use: ''Los Desaparecidos'' - the disappeared ones. Their children, treated as war booty, were often given to government officials or sympathizers who were childless. ''The Official Story,'' a prize-winning Argentine film that is called ''Los Desaparecidos'' in Spanish, examines the social and psychological trauma that is the legacy of such practices even today, after democracy has come.\n\nThe film, opening Friday at the Paris Theater, tells the story of an upper-middle-class mother who begins to suspect that her beloved daughter, whom she adopted as an infant five years before, may have belonged to one of the mothers or grandmothers whose agonized faces she sees begging for the return of their lost children outside the presidential offices at the Plaza de Mayor in Buenos Aires. It is also the story of the consequences of refusing to believe in unpalatable truths - of blindness caused by the unwillingness to see.\n\n''The Official Story'' - a reference to the government's denials that such horrors ever took place - opened to rave reviews in Argentina last April 4, just three days before the beginning of the trials of nine officers who headed three military juntas responsible for the disappearances. Over 9,000 people vanished during the so-called ''Dirty War'' of the 1970's. At least 180 children also simply disappeared. The fictionalized story that unfolded on the screen paralleled the eerie chronicle of real-life brutalities carried in the newspaper accounts of the trials.\n\nBut ''The Official Story,'' which was directed by Luis Puenzo, is not primarily a political film. It uses the tortured history of Argentina to touch on human and moral themes of universal and epic dimensions. Like Eve, the heroine's first taste of knowledge brings suspicion and also pain. Like Oedipus, she cannot stop herself from searching for the truth, although she knows it is likely to destroy her through the loss of what she most loves. Like Nora, in ''A Doll's House,'' her mental journey leads her not to knowledge of what she will do, but to a conviction about what she can no longer do.\n\n''I was interested in the point of view of this film,'' said its star, Norma Aleandro, whose performance won her an award for best actress at the Cannes Film Festival this year. Miss Aleandro plays Alicia, mother of an adopted child, wife of a successful businessman and, ironically, a history professor. ''This is the perspective of a person who represented about 70 percent of the population, not in social class, but in attitude,'' Miss Aleandro continued. ''She is one of those who couldn't believe and didn't want to believe what they were told, what they suspected was true. It's interesting because it describes a situation common in the history of man and dictatorships. People who are not directly affected try to live on the margin. A near reference is Germany during World War II where perhaps so many Jews didn't have to die if more people had believed the horrors they were told were going on.''\n\nMiss Aleandro's character lives what appears to be an ideal life. She is economically well-off. Her husband's business benefits from the regime. She has an adorable child, an interesting job. She has heard rumors about the fate of people arrested in the night, but it has never affected her, and she still naively believes that the government would put a stop to the brutalities if it were informed of them. Only when an old friend who had been living in exile returns at the end of the military dictatorship in December 1983 is she told directly of the torture her friend endured and, in passing, that many children were taken from prisoners and given away.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
