        "text": "The late 90s were a transformative period for Argentina. The Great Depression caused the economy to shrink profusely, pushing over half of the population below the poverty line and causing a high degree of social unrest.\n\nEl Nuevo Cine Argentino (“New Argentine Cinema”) developed around that same time, a new cinematic movement that marked the use of new forms of narration and a clear depiction of the socio-economic crisis haunting the country at the time.\n\nOn the front lines of this movement was Lucrecia Martel, one of the most widely known Latin-American filmmakers. Most of her work is characterized by its anarchic plotlines and its bold portrayal of class, gender, and race.\n\nHer first feature-length film, La Ciénaga (2001), follows the lives of two families in northern Argentina. On one side we have Mecha, who is resting from a recent fall at her vacation home with her husband and kids. And on the other, Tali, Mecha’s almost cousin, who comes to visit Mecha with her children.\n\nMartel undoubtedly places the women at the forefront of this film’s narrative, but don’t be fooled into thinking it is a feel-good female heroine story – it’s actually quite the contrary. Mecha, although the head of the family, is stuck with a deadbeat husband who says (maybe) three words throughout the entire movie and doesn’t care to fight back when she tells him to move into a different room of the house.\n\nAnd although Tali’s husband contrastingly plays a caring and protective fatherly figure, she seems suffocated from her role as a submissive and obedient wife.\n\nTwo husbands that couldn’t be more different, but two wives caught in the same patriarchal family system.\n\nThe above-mentioned conflict, despite being a relevant one, represents perhaps a tenth of what the movie is about. Martel’s way of splitting up dialogue and storylines allows her to explore many themes and stories at the same time, touching on topics such as motherly neglect, race, and incest.\n\nThe film was critically acclaimed globally, referred to as “one of the highest achievements” of the New Argentine Cinema movement by scholars. And twenty years later, La Ciénaga remains one of its kind.\n\nThe confusing and claustrophobic nature of the film – dare I say - is genius, and it will almost surely leave you wanting more from her. Or at least it did for me.\n\nTo anyone who attempts to watch this movie expecting it to be straightforward… Well, it is unnervingly easy to get lost and have no idea what is going on: Martel is hardly interested in presenting us with a clear narrative.\n\nThe plot, while chronologically linear, doesn’t follow a straight storyline. The director gives us glimpses of conversations, interactions, and intimate moments to form a not-so-clear telling of the characters’ lives.\n\nChicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert described the experience of watching the movie as “attending a family reunion when it’s not your family and your hosts are too drunk to introduce you around”.\n\nWATCHING THIS MOVIE IS LIKE ATTENDING A FAMILY REUNION WHEN IT’S NOT YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR HOSTS ARE TOO DRUNK TO INTRODUCE YOU AROUND\n\nThe first scenes of La Ciénaga show close-ups of wrinkly skin marked by years of neglect and sunbathing. Mecha drunkenly falls while holding glasses of wine, and the other adults in the scene are either too inebriated or too indifferent to help. Unable to move, Mecha stays on the floor until eventually one of her kids insists on rushing her to the hospital.\n\nAt this point, we barely know any of the characters by name, but the household dynamic is clear: a detached father, a dysfunctional mother figure, and feral children running wild.\n\nMartel’s films can hardly be referred to as aesthetically pleasing, her scenes are often claustrophobic and eerie, her characters always seemingly trapped in a world of decay.\n\nMost of the movie is set around Mecha’s vacation house in Salta, Argentina. The house itself is called La Mandragora (the Mandrake), the name of a poisonous plant, and is a clear foreshadowing of the setting of the house.\n\nThe estate is in poor condition, the pool looks like it hasn’t been cleaned in years while the wilderness is slowly acquiring more and more territory.\n\nThe title of the movie, which literally translates to the swamp, symbolizes the scenery of the movie as a whole: the air is warm, thick, and full of insects that fly around different rooms of the house as if there was something rotting inside.\n\nHer use of noise and visuals is nothing short of exemplary. The soundtrack of the movie is composed of sounds of nature, often distorted and overwhelmingly loud, infiltrating conversations until voices are completely drowned by insects and rain and you cannot make out a single word being said.\n\nThis only helps add to the feeling of confinement and is an interesting parallel to the state of La Mandragora: nature threatening to take over not just the house itself, but the dialogue and lives of the characters living in it as well.\n\nThe movie has plenty of turning points and tension build-ups, but rather than sticking to a certain climax, the scenes serve to unveil character traits throughout."
