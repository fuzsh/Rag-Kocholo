The Town of Barnstable is seeking to create a Master Site Development Plan for the 14.2 acre parcel formerly the site of the Marstons Mills Elementary School.

The Town seeks to collaborate with the village on a master plan that includes land uses that meet community needs, respect the history and character of the village center, and

incorporate sustainable development principals. There will be two upcoming public workshops to kickoff the planning process and begin to gather feedback from the public on the future of this site:

• In-Person Workshop

Tuesday, April 30th at 6:00 PM

Liberty Hall, 2150 Main Street in Marstons Mills, MA

• Virtual Workshop

Thursday, May 2nd at 6:00 PM

Zoom Link

There will also be a site walk open to the public taking place on-site (2095 Main Street in Marstons Mills) on Saturday, May 4th at 9:00 AM.

Residents are encouraged to provide input regarding the future of the site at these public meetings or through the Town’s interactive project public comment tool found on the Town’s

website: https://townofbarnstable.us/Departments/planninganddevelopment/projects/marstonsmillsschool/Marstons-Mills-School-Property-Master-Plan.asp.
