The Town of Barnstable will host a public workshop for the Marstons Mills Former School Site Master Plan on Wednesday, May 29th at 6:00 PM Liberty Hall, 2150 Main Street, Marstons Mills.

The intent of the public workshop is to continue to garner community input as to the future redevelopment of this site. This is the third public listening session hosted by the Planning and Development Department. The Town of Barnstable is seeking to create a Master Site Development Plan for the 14.2-acre parcel formerly the site of the Marstons Mills Elementary school and public input is critical to successfully establish site-specific land use goals which will inform the Master Plan. All residents are welcome to attend.
