Four generations of Browns lived at the five-acre site for more than 150 years. The site contains formal and informal gardens and two homes: Liberty Hall (1796) and the Orlando Brown House (1835).\n\nThe Browns were leaders in politics, community, business, literature, and education. John Brown, the patriarch of the family, was from Virginia where he had studied law with Thomas Jefferson. In 1783, he settled in Danville and established a law office. By 1784, Brown was representing Kentucky in the Virginia Legislature. In 1787-1788, he was a member of the Continental Congress. He represented Kentucky in Congress beginning in 1789 and during that time, he presented a petition to Congress to separate the county of Kentucky from the state of Virginia. In June 1792, Kentucky became the fifteenth state, largely due to Brownâ€™s efforts. Brown served as one of the first U.S. senators from Kentucky and served from 1792-1805.\n\nBrown married Margaretta Mason of New York City in 1799 and they moved into their Georgian style home in 1801. In 1819, Margaretta established a Sunday school for girls only. She also wrote poetry and religious tracts such as \"Food for Lambs\" and \"Brown's Catechism.\" The Browns had five children, but only two, their sons Mason and Orlando, survived to adulthood. Mason inherited Liberty Hall and, in order for Orlando to have an equal inheritance, a new home was built on the property. Senator Brown hired Gideon Shryock to design a Greek Revival style home."
