        "text": "No matter how many times you visit Cape Cod, you'll continue to find new ways to be captivated by its beauty. Massachusetts' hook-shaped peninsula is special in so many ways, thanks to its abundance of charming towns and sandy, pitch-pine-dotted landscapes. In Chatham, for example, a lively Main Street beckons shoppers and diners. But further north, the towns of Wellfleet and Truro have a more laid-back vibe with quiet beaches and winding back roads. Provincetown — the crown jewel at the very tip of the Cape — is a haven for painters, photographers, and writers.\n\nJust about every town on Cape Cod can lay claim to some of New England's most idyllic vacation rentals, luxurious hotels, and bed-and-breakfasts — not to mention award-winning seafood shacks and restaurants. There's also the unspoiled beauty of the Cape Cod National Seashore, where seemingly endless stretches of sand invite you to sunbathe, hike, and sunbathe some more. And the Cape's countless other beaches are all treasures on their own, from Nauset Light Beach in Eastham to Mayflower Beach in Dennis.\n\nA haven for those of us drawn to the sea, Cape Cod brims with nautical charm like no other. It's true: Nothing beats Cape Cod beaches or Cape Cod lighthouses, but in all honesty, we could do without the Cape Cod traffic.\n\nTime Zone\n\nEastern Standard Time\n\nBest Time to Go\n\nWhile the height of summer (between June and late August) is the quintessential time to experience Cape Cod, it's a treat to visit in September and October, when the crowds have subsided. Prices tend to be lower in the fall, too. Don't miss the Provincetown Film Festival in June and Wellfleet OysterFest in October.\n\nThings to Know\n\nThe Cape is famous for its traffic, and it has two bridges to thank for that: the Bourne Bridge and the Sagamore Bridge. They're the only entry and exit roads onto the hook-shaped chunk of land, and they almost always create a bottleneck effect on weekends in the summer.\n\nYour best bet is to begin (and end) your stay on a weekday. If you absolutely must drive in or out on a weekend, expect to add over an hour to your driving time. (For reference, it takes about an hour and a half to drive from Provincetown to Bourne.) Visit Cape Cod Commission for real-time traffic updates.\n\nTemperatures, much like traffic, vary wildly on the Cape. It's cooler than you might guess during summertime (thank you, sea breezes), and the ocean tends to hover around 67 degrees at the height of the season. It's also fairly mild in the winter — the salt air tends to minimize huge snowstorms. A word to the wise? Always bring a light jacket, no matter what the weatherman says, and keep a pair of flip-flops handy for spontaneous beach excursions.\n\nHow to Get Around\n\nGoogle Maps might tell you Cape Cod is a little over an hour's drive from Boston, but in this case, the app is wrong. There's constantly bumper-to-bumper traffic in the summertime, especially on weekends. So, if you're driving, factor in another hour into your travel time to be safe.\n\nThere's the option to catch a short flight from Boston or Providence into Hyannis or Provincetown. You can also take a seasonal train called the CapeFlyer, which departs from Boston's South Station on Friday nights, Saturdays, and Sundays from Memorial Day through Labor Day. Tickets start at $22 one-way and $40 round-trip, and cover a two-hour scenic ride into Hyannis. (As an added bonus, kids 11 and under ride free when accompanied by a paying adult.)\n\nThe most fun way to get there is the fast ferry from Boston. Bay State Cruise Company and Boston Harbor Cruises offer 90-minute rides across the bay, where you can sip a cold beer from the onboard bar. Tickets start at $61 one-way or $93 round-trip. Once you arrive, you'll need to rent a car to see everything. There is a public bus system, but it doesn't reach every corner of the Cape (or every beach). It's most useful to travelers staying put in one or two towns, or for short trips. A CharlieCard, the form of payment used on Boston's subway system, is accepted on Cape Cod Regional Transit Authority buses.\n\nTrains: CapeFlyer, capeflyer.com\n\nBuses: Cape Cod Regional Transit Authority, capecodrta.org\n\nTaxis: Town Taxi of Cape Cod, towntaxicapecod.com, Cape Cab, capecabtaxi.com\n\nRideshare: Uber, uber.com Lyft, lyft.com\n\nBoats: Bay State Cruise Company, baystatecruisecompany.com, City Experiences cityexperiences.com/boston/city-cruises\n\nBest Hotels\n\n01 of 31\n\nChatham Bars Inn\n\nAddress: 297 Shore Rd., Chatham, MA 02633\n\nPhone: (508) 945-0096\n\nBook Now\n\nBehold the first-ever luxury hotel on Cape Cod.

Situated on the Lower Cape in the town of Brewster, the award-winning resort is one of New England's finest. There's plenty to do on the 429-acre property, too, like kick back on a private bayside beach, rent a few stand-up paddleboards, or book an oyster bed tour.

But the 10 guest rooms inside this 1866 manse are one-of-a-kind, thanks to a host of original details (hello, ornate ceiling medallions) and antique decorations. Captain Freeman would be glad to know each bed is made with 600-thread-count sheets, and if guests so choose, they can order facial and massage treatments straight to their rooms.\n\n07 of 31\n\nThe Platinum Pebble Boutique Inn\n\nAddress: 186 Belmont Rd., West Harwich, MA 02671\n\nPhone: (508) 432-7766\n\nBook Now\n\nIn a land of nautical throw pillows and lighthouse lamps, The Platinum Pebble Boutique Inn feels refreshingly modern.

The weathered-shingle restaurant, formerly a blacksmith shop, is tucked on a back road in Truro. Don't let its unassuming exterior deter you — the New American spot serves out-of-this-world seafood, Wellfleet oysters, and natural beef burgers in an elegant setting. In the back, there's a glass-walled dining area overlooking a lush garden.\n\n11 of 31\n\nThe Canteen\n\nAddress: 225 Commercial St., Provincetown, MA 02657\n\nPhone: (508) 487-3800\n\nWebsite\n\nHigh-quality, laid-back eats are the name of the game at the Canteen, a beachy counter-service spot along Commercial Street in Provincetown.

Kennedy in 1961. The seashore's visitor center in Eastham offers a comprehensive overview of the area, and connects to several hiking trails.

The Sandwich Glass Museum chronicles the history of the glass industry on the Cape, showcasing the company's classic designs and hundreds of other colorful treasures.

Perched on the coast of Truro, Highland Lighthouse was commissioned by George Washington and erected in 1797 as the 20th light station in the newly formed United States. When the lighthouse isn't undergoing structural repairs, visitors can mount all 69 twisting, turning steps to the top for sweeping views of the ocean. (Tours of the lighthouse are suspended through 2021, but the grounds are open, so you can take in those views.) Nearby, the Highland House Museum, once a hotel, presents the history of Truro's earliest European settlers.\n\n23 of 31\n\nProvincetown Art Association and Museum\n\nAddress: 460 Commercial St., Provincetown, MA 02657\n\nPhone: (508) 487-1750\n\nWebsite\n\nProvincetown is a haven for artists, so it's no wonder its art museum is a treat for the eyes.

You might recognize their apparel — it's the wholesome shop that sells those classic pastel-colored sweatshirts with \"Cape Cod\" emblazoned on the front.
