        "text": "For Immediate Release (July 8, 2022) – In January of 2022 the Town of Barnstable was officially recognized as a Complete Streets community. The Cape Cod Commission and the Town of Barnstable are working together to analyze the Town’s transportation network to identify opportunities to create a more connected, efficient, and accessible roadway network and are seeking community feedback on priority projects at upcoming village meetings.\n\nAs elaborated within the Complete Streets Introduction Video, a “Complete Street” provides accommodations for all users, including motorists, pedestrians, bicyclists and transit users for people of all ages and abilities making streets safer, sustainable, and more accessible to promote a more livable community.\n\nStaff is currently working to develop a draft Prioritization Plan which is a list of potential roadway improvements that incorporate Complete Streets design elements ranked by defined evaluation criteria such as safety, mobility, ability to implement and community support.\n\nThe Cape Cod Commission and the Town of Barnstable want to hear from you. Staff will hold five family-friendly village meetings open to the public. Residents are encouraged to stop by to learn more about this effort and share ideas for potential Complete Streets projects that would better support walking, biking, and safe driving in the Town of Barnstable. All residents are welcome to attend one or more of the following meetings:\n\nMonday July 18th 4:30 PM\n\nVillages of Osterville & Cotuit\n\nOsterville Village Library 43 Wianno Ave, Osterville\n\nWednesday July 20th 4:30 PM\n\nVillage of Marstons Mills\n\nLiberty Hall 2150 Main Street, Marstons Mills\n\nTuesday July 26th 4:30 PM\n\nVillage of Hyannis\n\nBarnstable Adult Community Center 825 Falmouth Road (Route 28), Hyannis\n\nThursday July 28th 4:30 PM\n\nVillage of Centerville\n\nCenterville Public Library 585 Main Street, Centerville\n\nWednesday August 3rd 4:30 PM\n\nVillages of Barnstable & West Barnstable\n\nSaint Mary’s Episcopal Church 3055 Main Street (Route 6A), Barnstable\n\nBased on feedback from the village meetings, Town of Barnstable and Cape Cod Commission staff will work together to develop a draft Prioritization Plan which will be presented at a public meeting to occur Winter 2023. The final Prioritization Plan will be submitted to the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) as part of the town’s ongoing participation in their Complete Streets Program. Approved projects will be eligible for up to $400,000 in construction funding from MassDOT.\n\nFor more information visit the project website at https://www.capecodcommission.org/our-work/barnstable-complete-streets/ or contact: Colleen Medeiros, Transportation Program Manager, Cape Cod Commission: 508-744-1226 or Kate Maldonado, Assistant Director of Planning and Development: 508-862-4791."
