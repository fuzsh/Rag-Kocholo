        "text": "Rebuilt in 1911 and opening in February of 1912 as the Bowersock Opera House after fire destroyed the original Liberty Hall. It’s Beaux Arts facade, fireproof construction, rich acoustic qualities, and interior design make the hall as aesthetically pleasing and functional today as it was when it was built almost a century ago. By 1941, as the Jayhawker Theatre, it was operated by Commonwealth Amusement, but was gone from their management by 1950 and was closed in December 1957.\n\nInterior renovation took place in the 1980’s. The present day Liberty Hall is a 1,050-seat-capacity rental facility with a main floor and full balcony. The Hall’s interior features a 37 foot grand vaulted ceiling accented with the original chandeliers. The present interior motif has been designed and executed by local artists and craftsmen. Liberty Hall is available for private functions, fundraisers and conventions and still operates as a theatre for concerts, movies and the performing arts. Liberty Hall also offers video rentals.\n\nContributed by Clay Jarratt"
