        "text": "No visit to Kentucky is complete without touring the house of one of the state's founding fathers, Senator John Brown. Liberty Hall Historic Site is a learning center that engages the public and explores early Kentucky history, politics, and social and cultural life through the houses, gardens, documents, and artifacts of Senator John Brown and his family.\n\nDesignated a National Historic Landmark in 1971, Liberty Hall was home to four generations of the Brown family. The 4.5-acre property is owned and operated by the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The site’s formal and informal gardens border the Kentucky River and promise a chance for a restful stroll.\n\nWith its Georgian and Federal details, Liberty Hall is one of the finest examples of early American architecture in Kentucky. Next door, the 1835 Greek Revival home of John Brown’s son, Orlando, boasts family furniture and portraits, plus a museum store specializing in gifts and books inspired by the collections. To view some of the collections, explore the Liberty Hall gallery."
