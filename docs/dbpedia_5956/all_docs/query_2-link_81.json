        "text": "The Museum is completely contained within the two stories of the Old Barnstable U.S. Customs House. As the building is a registered historical landmark, only minimum changes can be made to it. As a result, there is wheelchair access to all of the first floor, including the restroom, but not the second floor. A video showing the upstairs displays is available for people who cannot or prefer not to negotiate the stairs to the second floor, just ask the Docent on duty to play the video for you.\n\nThe system is offered free of charge to all visitors. Each visitor is given a handset to use. With earphones two persons can share a single handset. Small cards located throughout the Museum display areas provide reference numbers for the audio tour system. Visitors can pick and enter which commentaries they would like to hear. After each visitor, the handsets are cleaned with a sanitary disinfectant wipes. Use of the audio tour system is not required for full enjoyment of the Museum.\n\nYes. One of the marked display areas on the first floor includes a small gift shop. Visitors are asked to wear gloves (provided, if needed) when handling any gift shop merchandise. Minimum handling of the merchandise and funds is practiced when making a purchase. We accept cash, checks and credit cards.\n\nThe Museum displays include varied artifacts, models, photographs and videos With two floors and 10 display areas in over 2,700 square feet, you should plan to spend about an hour to get the most out of the Museum, but visitors are welcome to stay as long or short of a time as they like. An audio tour system is available free of charge, but is not required to get the full benefit of the Museum. Most displays are clearly documented and some have videos.\n\nYes.
