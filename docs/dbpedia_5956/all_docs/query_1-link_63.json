        "text": "Built as a center of commerce in 1741, Faneuil Hall is where the Sons of Liberty proclaimed their dissent against Royal oppression. Faneuil Hall has served as an open forum meeting hall and marketplace for more than 270 years and has continued to provide a stage for debate on the most consequential issues of the day. It was at Faneuil Hall in 1764 that Americans first protested against the Sugar Act and the Stamp Act, setting the doctrine that would come to be known as \"no taxation without representation.\" Gatherings to protest the Townshend Acts, the Redcoat occupation, and the Tea Act would follow. The most famous weathervane in Boston is Faneuil Hallâ€™s golden grasshopper created by acclaimed craftsman Shem Drowne, whose weathervane also tops the Old North Church. Tradition has it that the weathervane was used during the War of 1812 to spot spies. Anyone who did not know the answer to the question \"What is on top of Faneuil Hall?\" in those days invited suspicion. Frequent naturalization ceremonies are held in the Great Hall at Faneuil Hall to swear in between 300 to 500 new citizens as they take the Oath of Allegiance. Quincy Center and Faneuil Hall Marketplace are located adjacent to historic Faneuil Hall and offers popular shopping and dining destinations in restored 19th-century buildings."
