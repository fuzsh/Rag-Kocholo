        "text": "Complete Streets\n\nUpdates\n\nIn collaboration with the Cape Cod Commission and based on public feedback, Town staff from Planning & Development and the Department of Public Works developed the Town of Barnstable’s Complete Streets Prioritization Plan: a list of priority roadway improvement projects throughout the community ranked by defined evaluation criteria including safety, mobility, ability to implement and community support. To view the map of priority projects please visit the Cape Cod Commission's webpage: https://www.capecodcommission.org/our-work/barnstable-complete-streets/\n\nThe Town’s Complete Streets Prioritization Plan was approved by MassDOT on August 30, 2023. The Town is now eligible to apply for construction grant funding up to $500,000 from MassDOT for any of the identified projects listed on the Prioritization Plan\n\nWhat are Complete Streets?\n\nComplete Streets are designed for people of all ages and all abilities that prioritize safety, comfort and accessibility. In adopting a Complete Streets Policy, a municipality commits to plan, design, maintain and operate right-of-ways, as determined feasible and practical, to improve the quality of life for their community.\n\nPotential complete streets improvements include but are not limited to: high-visibility crosswalks, designated bicycle lanes, wayfinding signage, street lighting, street trees, accessible curb ramps, intersection signalization, shared-use paths, traffic calming measures, bus shelters, sidewalks, street furniture, and pedestrian crossing islands.\n\nTown of Barnstable’s Complete Streets Policy\n\nAt the December 2, 2021 Town Council meeting, the Council affirmatively voted on a Resolve approving the Town of Barnstable’s Complete Streets Policy. The Town of Barnstable officially became a Complete Streets community in January 2022.Town of Barnstable’s Complete Streets Policy\n\nComplete Streets Funding Program\n\nLaunched in 2016, the MassDOT Complete Streets Funding Program dedicates state transportation funds to plan and implement Complete Streets addressing critical gaps in transportation networks by providing municipalities with tools and funding.\n\nAs a first step towards becoming a Complete Streets community, Town staff must attend Complete Streets training and a Complete Streets Policy must be developed and approved locally by the highest elected official or governing body. The Policy must then be submitted to MassDOT and obtain a qualifying score for approval. Upon becoming a Complete Streets community, the next step is for a municipality to collaborate with the greater community to develop a Complete Streets Prioritization Plan which is a list of at least fifteen (15) priority Complete Streets projects ranked by defined evaluation criteria. Through the MassDOT Complete Streets Funding Program, a municipality can apply for technical assistance to work together with a consultant to develop the Town's Prioritization Plan.\n\nOnce completed, the Prioritization Plan must then be submitted to MassDOT for approval. Upon approval, a municipality is eligible to apply for and potentially receive construction funding to implement projects identified within their Prioritization Plan. A municipality may obtain up to $500,000 in construction funding over the course of four fiscal years.\n\nFor more information, please review the MassDOT Complete Streets Funding Program Guidance document which provides further details defining the overview and purpose of the program, the process and frequently asked questions.\n\nCalendar\n\nWednesday February 15, 2022 6:00 PM\n\nVirtual Public Outreach Meeting #2\n\nLink: https://capecodcommission.org/CompleteStreets/join\n\nPasscode: join\n\nPhone: (929) 205-6099\n\nMeeting ID: 932 6393 2207\n\nMonday July 18, 2022\n\n4:30-5:30 PM\n\nVillages of Osterville & Cotuit\n\nOsterville Public Library: 43 Wianno Avenue #2028, Osterville, MA 02655\n\nWednesday July 20, 2022\n\n4:30-5:30 PM\n\nVillage of Marstons Mills\n\nLiberty Hall: 2150 Main Street, Marstons Mills, MA 02648\n\nTuesday July 26, 2022\n\n4:30-5:30 PM\n\nVillage of Hyannis\n\nBarnstable Adult Community Center: 825 Falmouth Road, Hyannis, MA 02601\n\nThursday July 28, 2022\n\n4:30-5:30 PM\n\nVillage of Centerville: 585 Main Street, Centerville, MA 02632\n\nWednesday August 3, 2022\n\n4:30-5:30 PM\n\nVillages of Barnstable & West Barnstable\n\nSaint Mary's Episcopal Church: 3055 Main Street, Barnstable, MA 02630\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nCape Cod Commission’s Complete Streets/Living Street: A Design Manual for Cape Cod\n\nContact"
