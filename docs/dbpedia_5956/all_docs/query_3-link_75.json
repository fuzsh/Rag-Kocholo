        "text": "Liberty Hall’s story began in Northamptonshire England, in Green’s Norton with Robert Green. He was the youngest son in a rather healthy family of strong, tall men; so was unlikely to move up the inheritance chain and was in need of opportunities. Fortunately for Robert, while his family had noticeably healthy genes, they also had great connections to the Court, (including his 5th Cousin Katherine Parr – the only wife Henry VIII actually liked) and his father William was a member of King William III’s Royal Bodyguard. (To be in the Royal Bodyguard one must be strong, healthy and over 6 feet tall; so not just a vanity Court position.) So young Robert, perhaps with a grant from the King (or maybe Queen Anne) he became a colonial landholder at just 15 years of age in 1710.\n\nRobert’s mom also contributed to his fortunes (least she could do to make up for all those bigger brothers she gave him) through her own big brother, Sir William Duff, a Scottish Quaker, with whom Robert traveled to the New World to make his fortune. Uncle Duff had received many of his own patents prior to departing for Virginia, though I am not sure how or have much of a clear story on him. We know that Uncle Duff joined the Monthly Meeting at West River in southern Maryland, a slightly “freer” religious area than Northern Virginia. We also know that Uncle Duff lived a stricter lifestyle than Robert, a traditional Anglican, which caused Robert (only 17 upon his arrival) to quickly seek out his own life independent from his Uncle.\n\nLegend has it that Robert named his first parcel of land, this plantation, “Liberty Hall” because it was a place at which “A man could be at his liberty...” We assume he might also have added, under his breath, “from Uncle Duff.”\n\nRobert had a successful life, serving as a Capt. in the Orange County Militia, as vestry man for St. Mark’s Parish, and he was also a member of the House of Burgess, a Justice of the Peace and Sheriff for Orange County. He (and his wife Eleanor) had 7 healthy sons, all taking after the Green family line in being very strong, healthy and tall as well as inheriting their mother’s flaming red hair; thus earning the nickname “The Red Green’s of Culpeper.”\n\nAside from being healthy, the Green family was blessed with significant military, civil and economic talents. Robert’s luck in receiving a patent for land so well situated, with 2 strong streams flowing through the rolling hills of the pasture land and bordered by two strong rivers ensured the long-term success of the plantation and his family.\n\nAt the time of its inception, Liberty Hall, was located in the County of Essex, within an area that would be established (through a very long legal battle) as Lord Fairfax’s Northern Neck of Virginia. During its first owner’s life, Liberty Hall began in Essex and passed to Spotsylvania County on December 17, 1721, to Orange in 1734 and settled in Culpeper in 1749 (though after Robert’s will was probated in Orange).\n\nThroughout history, Liberty Hall has raised cattle as well as horses for sport. Attesting to this fact are numerous advertisements in colonial papers for cattle and horses for sale and for stud at Liberty Hall. From the early 18th century to mid-19th century the Hall was also the location of two robust Mills, which included a county store with various goods. The largest Mill was in the Hazel River (on what we call Danny’s Island) and was part of the Hazel River Navigation Company complete with Lock and Canal system. The rock foundations of the docking area and rings to securing transports are still there along the bank.\n\nThe plantation’s land, given its strategic advantages of river borders and strong streams, was host to both armies during the Civil War. Thankfully, as the house was uninhabitable due to the fire shortly before the war, Liberty Hall was not destroyed. Many relic hunters have found treasures buried here and continue to enjoy unearthing the plantation’s secrets even today.\n\nThroughout its 300+ year history, the plantation has consistently sustained operations for cattle, equestrian sports and been a center for hospitality."
