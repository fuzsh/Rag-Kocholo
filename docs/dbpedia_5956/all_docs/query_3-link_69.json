        "text": "Liberty Hall Academy: A New Nation, a New Sense of Purpose, and New Challenges\n\nThe Charter of 1782\n\nIn November 1782, Graham petitioned the Virginia General Assembly for an Act of Incorporation, which was, in everything but name, a college charter. On December 28, it was signed into law. The incorporation authorized the institution to confer degrees and appoint professors, and constituted the first formal recognition that Liberty Hall Academy offered a college-level education.\n\nCampus Development\n\nSometime during 1783, the frame schoolhouse burned. The minutes of the Board of Trustees indicate that arson was suspected. A new wood frame building was erected shortly afterward, but this also burned in 1790, apparently as the result of an accident.\n\nIn response to the need for a new home for the academy, the trustees undertook an ambitious plan to construct a three-story stone building which could house forty students as well as the school’s library, classrooms, and scientific apparatus. The Synod of Virginia wished to establish a theological seminary in connection with Liberty Hall. This close relationship with the Presbyterian Church disturbed some who feared that the Academy would be effectively placed under the control of the church. However, as the religious fervor of the 1790s subsided, the theological character of the institution declined.\n\nAlthough Lexington’s townspeople expressed interest in having the academy relocate inside the town, the trustees decided against moving."
