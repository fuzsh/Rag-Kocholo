        "text": "Liberty Hall is a locally owned and operated historic theater in downtown Lawrence, Kansas. Comprised of a concert hall, video store, coffee house, and independent cinema, all located conveniently at the corner of 7th and Massachusetts Street (lovingly referred to as Mass Street by the locals).\n\nLiberty Hall's main stage has hosted countless live performances ranging from Willie Nelson to Wu Tang Clan, in an intimate setting with a state of the art concert hall sound system. Liberty Hall has been voted Lawrence's Best Music Venue for three years straight. It has acted as a community-meeting house since 1856, and hosts regular screenings and lectures that promote culture and civility in Lawrence, KS.\n\nLiberty Hall Video Library can be accessed from a window within the Box Office, and boasts an enormous collection of DVD and Blu-ray titles for rent. Liberty Hall Video Library has a friendly and knowledgeable staff, and prices that cannot be beat. Enjoy two-for-one rentals every day, or sign-up for the Uranium Option: unlimited rentals with no late fees for just a small monthly charge (funny name, serious deal).\n\nLa Prima Tazza is a European-style coffee house that serves the best in Fair Trade coffee and specialty drinks on Massachusetts Street. It is home to the most experienced and loveable baristas in downtown Lawrence. La Prima Tazza has been voted Best Coffee in Lawrence for three years straight, and is the perfect place to work on your latest project, chat with a friend, or to contemplate life's big questions over a hot brew. Starbucks wishes it was La Prima Tazza!\n\nLiberty Hall Cinema shows the latest in first-run independent, foreign, and art house films on two screens. Liberty Hall Cinema also offers monthly creative special screenings of classic and soon-to-be-classic films on the big screen. We offer a traditional movie theater concession stand with the addition of beer, wine, and cocktails."
