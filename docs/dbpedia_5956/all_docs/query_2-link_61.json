        "text": "Cape Cod gives locals and visitors the chance to dive into unique natural habitats, culture and art, and a long history. In fact, there are more than 75 nature centers, art and cultural centers, museums, and historical societies on the Cape Cod Museum Trail.\n\nWe’ve compiled a list of 23 of our favorite and unique spots in each region to get you started exploring the Cape Cod Museum Trail. If you want even more options, you’ll find lists of additional great museums and historical societies to visit in each region too.\n\nAbout the Cape Cod Museum Trail\n\nThe Cape Cod Museum Trail is a digital initiative and physical journey sponsored by First Citizens’ Federal Credit Union to connect the dozens of museums across the Cape.\n\nEstablished in October 2015, the idea of the trail was born after some museum directors gathered to talk about how they could coordinate, promote, and share each other’s resources.\n\nEver since, more museums have joined the effort — from Woods Hole, Bourne, and Sandwich in the Upper Cape to Brewster and Chatham in the Lower Cape to Provincetown at the tip of the Outer Cape.\n\nMuseum Mondays in May\n\nSince 2021, the Cape Cod Museum Trail has organized Museum Mondays in May. Every Monday in May, select museums are open to the public for free, celebrating the art, culture, and history of the Cape. The trail organizes other programs as well:\n\nCape Cod Art Week — a celebration of the creative impact of arts and culture, featuring presentations from artists, creative entrepreneurs, and cultural organizations.\n\nMonday at the Museum Podcast — a series of conversations with local historians, musicians, artists, and more that you can listen to on the go.\n\nPilgrim Landing Trail — a 55-mile trail across the Lower and Outer Cape that traces the Pilgrims’ experiences and explorations.\n\nCape Cod Museum Trail | Planning Your Visit\n\nThere are many ways to plan your visit to the best museums on the Cape Cod Museum Trail. You could visit all of the museums in a region, or select a few stops as you take a scenic drive from one end of the Cape to the other. Either way, below are some of our favorites in each area.\n\nTop-Rated Museums in Upper Cape Cod\n\nCape Cod Cape Verdean Museum & Cultural Center | East Falmouth\n\nThe Verdean Museum & Cultural Center is the first of its kind in the Upper Cape to celebrate the rich history and contributions of Cape Verdean. It has a collection of about 1,000 artifacts related to Cape Verdean, Cabo Verde, and other Lusophone migrations. Admission is free!\n\nOne attraction here is The Emerald House, a historic farmstead that represents the rich immigrant history of Falmouth. The center hosts activities and events throughout the year as well.\n\nMuseums on the Green | Falmouth\n\nRun by the Falmouth Historical Society, the Museums on the Green is a beautiful 2-acre property that features an early 20th-century reconstructed barn, Colonial gardens, a Cultural Center, a four-seater outhouse, two historic cannons, and two 18th-century homes.\n\nEach building and exhibit shares a story about the seaside community’s locals at the time. The Hallett Barn Visitor Center features rotating exhibits and the Whaling Wives Gift Shop. Walking tours and trolley tours also depart from here from late May to early October.\n\nAptucxet Museum Complex | Bourne\n\nOpen Memorial Day Weekend through Indigenous Peoples Day Weekend, the Aptucxet Museum Complex is a 12-acre campus along the Cape Cod Canal. It consists of small historic buildings, outdoor installations, and replicas that tell of local Colonial history through the 20th century.\n\nThe main building — the Aptucxet Trading Post — is a replica of the Pilgrim Trading Post that the Plymouth Colony built in 1627 for trading with the Wampanoag Tribe and Dutch traders.\n\nCape Cod Military Museum | Bourne\n\nThe Cape Cod Military Museum promotes an appreciation and understanding of how Americans have contributed to 20th-century conflicts. Rather than glorify war, the museum honors the sacrifices that military personnel — particularly those from Southeastern Massachusetts — have made at home and abroad.\n\nHeritage Museums & Gardens | Sandwich\n\nCombining museums and gardens, Heritage Museums & Gardens commemorates the culture, leisure, work, and lives of Southeastern New England locals — especially Cape Cod and the islands.\n\nIts museum collection consists of 18,000 items — from automobiles to fine art to Indigenous Peoples’ artifacts. You can even ride the hand-carved, 1908 Looff Carousel. On top of that, there are 100 acres of designed gardens, nature trails, sweeping lawns, and shrubs and trees.\n\nSandwich Glass Museum | Sandwich\n\nFeaturing some of the most unique Cape Cod art, the Sandwich Glass Museum interprets the history of the town, which is the oldest on the Cape. Much of this history involves American glass production.\n\nAlong with viewing historic and locally made glass creations, you can watch glassmaking presentations every hour. A glassblower lights up the glory hole and turns and twists the hot glass into various forms. You can feel the heat from the furnace!\n\nMore Upper Cape Museums\n\nOcean Science Discovery Center & Store | Woods Hole\n\nWoods Hole Historical Museum | Woods Hole\n\nFalmouth Art Center | Falmouth\n\nHighfield Hall & Gardens | Falmouth\n\nCape Cod Children’s Museum | Mashpee\n\nMashpee Wampanoag Museum | Mashpee\n\nBriggs-McDermott House | Bourne\n\nNational Marine Life Center | Bourne\n\nCape Cod Canal Visitor Center | Sandwich\n\nHoxie House Museum | Sandwich\n\nWing Fort House | Sandwich\n\nNye Museum Sites | East Sandwich\n\nUnique Mid Cape Cod Museum Trail Stops\n\nCape Cod Maritime Museum | Hyannis\n\nPreserving Cape Cod’s maritime history and traditions, the Cape Cod Maritime Museum features collections, exhibitions, educational programs, and public events. Highlights include cultural exhibits, marine artifacts, boat building, and shipwrecks.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy Hyannis Museum | Hyannis\n\nIf you’re interested in JFK, head to the John F. Kennedy Hyannis Museum to learn about this former president’s legacy. Experience the Summer White House days of the 1960s, and find out why the area was considered the Kennedys’ “heart and home.”\n\n1717 Meetinghouse | West Barnstable\n\nThe 1717 Meetinghouse is a historic memorial, place of worship, village center, and town meeting place. This fascinating structure was built before George Washington was born and was home to the 1806 Paul Revere bell! The current bell was made between 1828 and 1835 by the Revere family.\n\nIt’s just an interesting place to view and look around from Memorial Day to Indigenous Peoples Day.\n\nCoast Guard Heritage Museum | Barnstable\n\nFeaturing more than 2,700 square feet and two floors of exhibits, the Coast Guard Heritage Museum is dedicated to all things U.S. Coast Guard from its beginning as the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service. You can tour the museum with a guide, the free audio system, or on your own.\n\nCape Cod Museum of Art | Dennis\n\nFounded in 1981 by artists, the Cape Cod Museum of Art houses artwork by the finest artists on the Cape, celebrating the region’s distinct artistic identity. Alongside an outstanding art collection across seven galleries, the CCMoA is surrounded by a Sculpture Garden and has a film screening room.\n\nWhydah Pirate Museum | West Yarmouth\n\nOne of the most unique spots on the Cape Cod Museum Trail, the Whydah Pirate Museum has the first exhibition of authentic pirate treasure in the world. You’ll find the biggest worldwide collection of pirate artifacts that have been recovered from one shipwreck — the Whydah.\n\nThe museum tells the story of the slave ship and how it was turned into a pirate ship in the early 18th century, revealing its true story and who lived on board. New exhibits are added as more artifacts and treasures are excavated.\n\nMore Museums in the Mid Cape\n\nMassachusetts Air and Space Museum | Hyannis\n\nToad Hall Sports Car Collection | Hyannis\n\nZion Union Heritage Museum | Hyannis\n\nCahoon Museum of American Art | Cotuit\n\nCotuit Center for the Arts | Cotuit\n\nHistorical Society of Santuit & Cotuit | Cotuit\n\nOsterville Historical Museum | Osterville\n\nBarnstable Historical Society Museum | Barnstable\n\nCape Cod Art Center | Barnstable\n\nCenterville Historical Museum | Barnstable\n\nTales of Cape Cod | Barnstable\n\nCaptain Bangs Hallet House Museum | Yarmouth Port\n\nEdward Gorey House | Yarmouth Port\n\nHistorical Society of Old Yarmouth | Yarmouth Port\n\nTaylor-Bray Farm | Yarmouth Port\n\nWinslow Crocker House | Yarmouth Port\n\nCultural Center of Cape Cod | South Yarmouth\n\nDennis Historical Society Museums | Dennis\n\nBest Museums in the Lower Cape\n\nBrewster Historical Society Museum & Windmill Village | Brewster\n\nFounded in 1964, the Brewster Historical Society preserves local history and artifacts, specifically the restored circa 1799 Cobb House Museum and Windmill Village. Cobb House has five permanent galleries. Even when the house isn’t open for tours, you can enjoy the grounds and garden.\n\nWindmill Village next to Drummer Boy Park is home to a circa 1795 Higgins Farm Windmill, circa 1795 Harris-Black House, and circa 1867 Hopkins Blacksmith Shop. The buildings are open to explore from late June through Labor Day Weekend, including blacksmith demos every weekend.\n\nIn addition, the Brewster Historical Society hosts the farmer’s market from early June to early September. It also hosts the Harvest Market in early October, as well as other festivities throughout the year.\n\nCape Cod Museum of Natural History | Brewster\n\nWhen it comes to exploring nature, there’s plenty to do at the Cape Cod Museum of Natural History. Established in 1954, the museum is located in a 17,000-square-foot building on 80 acres of land next to 320 acres of conservation and town land.\n\nIt’s certainly easy to spend an entire day here! We don’t have room to list all of the exhibits and attractions, but here are a few to give you an idea of how much there is to explore:\n\nNature Trails\n\nAquarium\n\nPreserved Bird Collection\n\nGuided Archaeology Walks\n\nGuided Family Field Walks\n\nButterfly House & Pollinator Path (including butterfly feeding)\n\nHoney Bee Observation Hive\n\nMoon Adventure Game & Interstellar Explorations\n\nPeople of the Land: The Wampanoag\n\nBrooks Academy Museum & A.

Sydney Brooks oversaw the two-room school, teaching a high school curriculum to boys and girls. Today, it houses exhibits about the town’s history.\n\nAlso on the museum grounds is the A. Elmer Crowell Barn Museum, which highlights the story of the world-famous bird carver. You can watch real video footage of Crowell in his workshop and carving demonstrations.\n\nAtwood House & Museum | Chatham\n\nHome to the Chatham Historical Society, The Atwood House was built by Captain Joseph Atwood in the 1750s. On the ground floor, you can explore eight rooms that contain items from the 1700s to the 1900s, encompassing three centuries of Cape Cod family life.\n\nThe house has remained unchanged since its original structure, except for the Marjorie’s kitchen addition in the 1830s and the addition of essential electricity. It’s even furnished like it was during the 1700s and 1800s. Also on the grounds are a lighthouse turret and the Nickerson North Beach Camp.\n\nCaleb Nickerson Homestead | Chatham\n\nEstablished in 1897, the Nickerson Family Association maintains Nickerson family properties, including the Caleb Nickerson Homestead. The circa 1829 home features an Antique Cape design with a working beehive and three hearths.\n\nAlso on the property are a reproduction post-and-beam outhouse, heirloom kitchen garden, archaeology dig site, and memorial monument. All is open for guided tours from June to September. Additionally, this historic landmark is located where English settlers made their first home in Chatham in 1664.\n\nThe Centers for Culture and History in Orleans | Orleans\n\nBringing Cape Cod culture and history to life, The Centers for Culture and History in Orleans has three interesting historic sites for activities and learning.\n\nThe Meetinghouse is an 1834 Greek Revival structure that was once the meeting house for the Universalist Church of Orleans. Now, it houses a museum with special exhibits and hosts cultural programs.\n\nThe CG36500 Motor Lifeboat is famous for its nighttime rescue of 32 crew from the Pendleton tanker in 1952 during a fierce winter storm. The boat is the center of the book “The Finest Hours: The True Story of the U.S. Coast Guard’s Most Daring Sea Rescue” and the 2016 film “The Finest Hours.”\n\nBuilt in 1937, the Hurd Chapel is a newer addition to the property with plans to make it a place for research, meetings, and storage for artifacts and archives.\n\nMore Lower Cape Cod Museums\n\nCrosby Mansion | Brewster\n\nStony Brook Grist Mill & Museum | Brewster\n\nBenjamin Godfrey Chatham Windmill | Chatham\n\nChatham Railroad Museum | Chatham\n\nMarconi/RCA Wireless Museum | Chatham\n\nExcellent Stops on the Outer Cape Cod Museum Trail\n\nCaptain Penniman House | Eastham\n\nCompleted by local artisans in 1868, the Captain Penniman House is a 2.5-story, wood-frame home with a mansard roof. It was home to the family of Captain Edward Penniman, one of the most successful whaling captains in the region.\n\nA unique feature is the octagonal cupola with arched windows. It was raised high enough so that the Captain could see ships passing in both the Atlantic Ocean and Cape Cod Bay.\n\nAlso on the 12 acres of property purchased from his father, Penniman had a barn and a greenhouse. The greenhouse was destroyed in a 1920s hurricane and never rebuilt. Since then, the property has retained its 19th-century site plan.\n\nEastham Historical Society Museums | Eastham\n\nThe Eastham Historical Society has several museums and places to explore on the Cape Cod Museum Trail.

The collection consists of art, documents, letters, maps, nautical objects, and photos rich in local history.\n\nMost of this collection is on permanent display in its main building, which was a former store. Various display cases and floor-to-ceiling shelves house the items. The society features temporary and special exhibitions as well.\n\nThe second building is a house that dates from the 18th century in some parts and the 19th century in others, all of which are furnished accordingly.\n\nHighland House Museum | Truro\n\nBuilt in 1907, the Highland House Museum was once a seasonal hotel. It’s located near the Highland Light and is a classic model of a summer resort hotel at the turn of the century.

There are also rotating displays of locals’ contributions to the domestic crafts, railroad, and salt mill industries over the years.\n\nPilgrim Monument & Provincetown Museum | Provincetown\n\nStanding 252 feet above Provincetown, the Pilgrim Monument commemorates the arrival of the Mayflower Pilgrims in the town.
