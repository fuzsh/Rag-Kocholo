        "text": "The story of Liberty Hall is a story of family, one filled with cherished memories, an independent spirit, strong women and patriotism. When John Robert McDowell built his impressive Greek Revival home in the 1850s, he selected the best materials and used the best craftsmen available. He intended his beautiful home to last to be enjoyed by generations to come. Now, his fifth generation descendant lovingly cares for the home and shares it with bed and breakfast guests.\n\nThis historic plantation home near Camden, Alabama, is in the heart of the Black Belt, a rich stripe of black earth perfect for growing cotton. This fertile land became the center of plantation culture in Alabama and is home to some of the South’s most beautiful antebellum homes. Liberty Hall’s two-story front portico features two central Ionic columns flanked by a square column to each side. The floor plan is centered on a broad hall that separates four large, equally proportioned rooms on both levels. The formal rooms and hall on the lower level have elaborate plasterwork designed, in part, by Harriet McDowell, wife of John Robert McDowell. Full French windows open from the parlor onto the large veranda."
