        "text": "The Alden Family sites consist of two properties in Duxbury, MA that are listed on the National Register of Historic Landmarks.\n\nThe first property, the Alden Homestead Site, contains the archaeological remains of the house John Alden built about 1630.\n\nThe second property, the John Alden House, is a historic house museum that was purportedly home to John and Priscilla (Mullins) Alden, but by forensic analysis, judged to have been built around 1700, probably by John Alden’s grandson. The property has been under continuous ownership by the Alden Family and it is now managed by a family foundation.\n\nThe Jabez Howland House is an historic house museum that has been restored and decorated with 17th-century period furnishings. The oldest portion of this two-story wood frame house was built by Jacob Mitchell in 1667, and purchased by Jabez Howland, son of Mayflower Pilgrims John Howland and Elizabeth (Tilley) Howland. John and Elizabeth lived in the home with Jabez for a short time making it the only existing house in Plymouth where Pilgrims have actually lived.\n\nThe Jenney is dedicated to conveying the impact 51 Pilgrims have had on the founding and ongoing development of the United States and to the importance of passing the history of our country from generation to generation. The museum offers walking tours of the Plymouth historic district and tours of the National Monument to the Forefathers. Educational programs cover topics such as the economics of the Pilgrims and the Pilgrim family. The house, built in 1749, houses a gift shop and three exhibits in the Interpretive Centre.\n\nThe Mayflower II, built in Devon England, is a replica of the 17th-century ship Mayflower that transported the Pilgrims to the New World.\n\nToday, Mayflower II is a floating classroom and working vessel. Following her restoration and return to Plymouth in 2020, she was added to the National Register of Historic Places, illuminating that she is a historic ship in her own right.\n\nThe Mayflower Pilgrims’ first Meetinghouse was built at the top of Leyden Street in Plymouth in 1622. Records of the Pilgrim ancestors were stored there and passed on from congregation to congregation through the years. This is the fifth spiritual structure built in this location, to honor and memorialize the Mayflower Pilgrims.\n\nThe current Meetinghouse was built in 1897, the same year that the General Society of Mayflower Descendants was founded.\n\nIn 2014, the Meetinghouse was added to both the National Register of Historic Places and the List of Massachusetts’ Most Endangered Resources.\n\nThen In 2018, the First Parish Church congregation, the former owners of the Meetinghouse, decided to donate the Meetinghouse to The Mayflower Society, in order to save and preserve the building.\n\nToday the General Society of Mayflower Descendants is in the process of a complete restoration and upgrade of the Mayflower Meetinghouse.\n\nPlease consider making a donation to the Mayflower Meetinghouse Project.\n\nPlimoth Patuxet, founded in 1947, is a living history museum that exhibits, through topography and reenactors, the original settlement of the Plymouth Colony established in the 17th century by the Mayflower Pilgrims. The museum started with two English cottages and a fort on Plymouth’s historic waterfront. Since then, the Museum has grown to include Mayflower II, the English Village, the Wampanoag Homesite, the Hornblower Visitor Center, the Craft Center, the Maxwell and Nye Barns, and the Plimoth Grist Mill.\n\nThe Pilgrim George Soule must have recognized what this land had to offer when he joined together with 25 other men to buy a large parcel from the Wampanoag Indians in 1662. Although he never settled his piece, which lay primarily in what is now E. Middleborough, his grandson James, built a home there.\n\nThe Soule Homestead mission is to teach people where their food comes from and promote sustainable agriculture, which requires open fields for crops and grazing. Many people visit the Farm to learn about agriculture and others come to the farm to enjoy the open space. The site has scenic vistas in every direction, from sunrise to sunset, that inspires creativity for all who visit. Visitors to Soule often speak of the feelings of peace and well-being they experience walking around."
