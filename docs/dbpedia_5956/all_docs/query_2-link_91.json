        "text": "The all-American town of Hyannis, MA, is home to the historic Kennedy Compound on Cape Cod. This historical gem was once home to the beloved and iconic United States president John F. Kennedy. Today, the Kennedy family still uses the property. For this reason, it is private property and not open to the public. However, you can still view the estate from a distance. History buffs can also learn about the legacy of JFK and the Kennedy family by visiting the John F. Kennedy Hyannis Museum and Hyannis Kennedy Legacy Trail. Cape Cod is brimming with history! The Kennedy Compound is just one example of all the great things to do on Cape Cod.\n\nAccess our complimentary Vacation Guide and discover how to make your Cape Cod getaway come to life!\n\nYour Guide to the Kennedy Compound on Cape Cod\n\nWhere Is the Kennedy Compound on Cape Cod?\n\nThe Kennedy Compound on Cape Cod is made up of three neighboring homes spread across six acres along Nantucket Harbor. Although visitors aren’t allowed on the grounds or to go inside, we know where to get the best views! Here are our recommendations:\n\nOne of the best ways to see the residence is from the ferry heading to and from Martha’s Vineyard. Plus, it makes an excellent day trip during your stay!\n\nYou will not be able to see the compound from the road, but you might be able to catch a glimpse as you walk along the beach. The oceanfront homes capture the Kennedy lifestyle and show how the former president and his family lived on Cape Cod.\n\nHyannis Kennedy Legacy Trail\n\nHead out to downtown Hyannis to experience the Hyannis Kennedy Legacy Trail if you’re interested in learning more about the family’s legacy. Here, you’ll find a self-guided walking tour through downtown Hyannis, MA, that highlights significant landmarks in the lives of all the Kennedys. The trail includes 10 sites that contain informative signs displaying little-known facts about the family and Cape Cod. You can also download the QR scanner app on your mobile device for more information; the app will give you access to links to exclusive Kennedy videos and pictures. The best way to experience the tour is to explore the 1.6 miles in person, but you can also take a virtual tour from your computer.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy Hyannis Museum\n\nThe John F. Kennedy Hyannis Museum provides an in-depth look at the former president by documenting his public and private time on the Cape. This museum is near the Kennedy Compound on Cape Cod and uses interactive multimedia exhibits to showcase the Kennedy legacy. The museum also features a new exhibit annually so you can come back year after year! Past displays include “Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, Mother of a President” and “Jack and Bobby Kennedy, Brothers First.” The museum closes from December 1st through mid-April but is open during school vacation week.\n\nWhere to Stay Near the Kennedy Compound on Cape Cod\n\nYou’re sure to want to visit other museums and absorb all of the Cape’s rich history after visiting the Kennedy Compound on Cape Cod. For this, we recommend the Cape Cod Museum Trail.\n\nCome back and relax at Candleberry Inn Cape Cod bed and breakfast after a day of touring. Our inn is also full of Cape Cod history. Once a sea captain’s home, our innkeepers have done thorough research on the history of the inn. Ask about it when you check-in!"
