It was recognized for its significance in politics and government and was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1972. Today, it serves as the Liberty Hall Museum, offering visitors a glimpse into the past and the lives of those who once resided there.\n\nArchitectural Evolution of Liberty Hall\n\nLiberty Hall was originally built in 1772 as a fourteen-room Georgian-style house. Over the years, it has undergone significant transformations and now stands as a fifty-room Victorian Italianate mansion. This architectural evolution reflects the changing times and tastes of its inhabitants, offering visitors a unique insight into different periods of history.\n\nCollections at Liberty Hall Museum\n\nLiberty Hall Museum houses an extensive collection of historical artifacts, including furniture, clothing, manuscripts, books, portraits, and pictures. Among these artifacts are a signed letter from George Washington, a pre-census population count, and an invitation to Abraham Lincoln's inaugural. These items provide a tangible connection to the past, allowing visitors to gain a deeper understanding of the historical events and figures associated with Liberty Hall."
