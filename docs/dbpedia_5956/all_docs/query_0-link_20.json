        "text": "July 2022\n\nOur stay at Liberty Hill Inn exceeded our high expectations. John called us to say the room was ready if we wanted to check in before the published time. We had other plans, but that was the first of many nice gestures. He also made suggestions of several restaurants for our first nights dinner. When I told him where we had already planned to go, he suggested reservations, which proved quite a wise choice even though it was the off season. John called and made those for us, again a nice gesture. The afternoon cookies and the wide assortment of complimentary beverages was much appreciated. The breakfast each morning was phenomenal! We really enjoyed visiting with John and Kris and them sharing their varied life experiences. It certainly felt like family when we left. We will definitely stay again if visiting Cape Cod and encourage others to avail themselves to this fantastic B&B.\n\n– Craig T Stockton Iowa\n\nWelcome to the Liberty Hill Inn Cape Cod, a TripAdvisor.com Travelers Choice, award-winning bed and breakfast located in Yarmouth Port.\n\nThe Liberty Hill Inn’s main house accommodates five spacious rooms, from the ground floor to the third floor.
