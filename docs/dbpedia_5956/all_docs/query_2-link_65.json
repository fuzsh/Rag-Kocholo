It is known for its miles of white sand beaches, marshes, and dunes combined with charming towns and villages to explore. Why is Cape Cod famous? For more than 200 years, it was mostly a fishing and whaling region but train service from Boston began in 1848. The creation of the Cape Cod Canal in 1914 then the construction of bridges onto the cape in the 1930s allowed the population to explode.\n\nFor about 100 years, towns on Cape Cod have been a major summer haven for city dwellers in New England and New York. Most famously, the Kennedys made Cape Cod their summer home and President John F. Kennedy established the gorgeous Cape Cod National Seashore during his presidency.\n\nCape Cod is made up of more than one dozen towns and many more villages, many of which quadruple in population during the summer.
