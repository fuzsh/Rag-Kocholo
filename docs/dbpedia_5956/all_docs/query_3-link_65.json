It’s a preeminent addition to his already-acclaimed and extensive discography, and it’s the album he’s been trying to make since he started making records.\n\nMcCraven believes that the word “jazz” is insufficient, at best, to describe the phenomenon we’re dealing with. The artist, who has been aptly called a cultural synthesizer, has a unique gift for collapsing space, destroying borders and blending past, present, and future into poly-textural arrangements of post-genre, jazz-rooted 21st century folk music. Profiled in Vice, Rolling Stone, the Guardian, and NPR, among other publications, he and the music he makes today are at the very vanguard of that phenomenon. According to the New York Times, “McCraven has quietly become one of the best arguments for jazz’s vitality.” The artist explained to NPR in 2019, \"I don't think what I'm doing is necessarily that far off of the legacy of jazz that I grew up in... I think one of the things that gives it strength is that people want to argue over it. That's a good sign. That means there's life here.\"\n\nFree State Presents: Short & Sweet\n\nABOUT THE FILMS\n\nA Man for the Job (15min) by Lyn Elliot\n\nWhen a young hospital parking valet befriends a middle-aged patient, he discovers she wants something he may not be able to give.\n\nPayback Time (14min) by Takashi Miyatani\n\nA man reunites with someone from his past in the workplace leaving coworkers to wonder who bullied who\n\nCottage Grove (13min) by George Elzey Jr.\n\nA young man struggles to communicate with his stroke-afflicted father, and at the same time, stay true to himself.\n\nBedtime Story (3min) by Jake Jackson\n\nOn a dark summer night, evil lurks in the shadows as a young child must decide what bedtime story she would like to hear.\n\nHangman (15min) by Megan Brotherton\n\nA recently widowed woman works through the complexities of grief with the help of friends, strangers and Tupperware.\n\nThe Blue Hour (15 min) directed by J.D.

Doors 7pm / Show 8pm\n\nAllen Stone is an R&B / soul singer from Chewelah, WA. The son of the pastor of the local church, he was immersed in gospel from an early age until he found funk and soul as a teenager through Stevie Wonder’s Innversions. Billboard has praised his “disarmingly soulful vocals” and WXPN says \"his energetic shows, plus his warm and evocative albums, explain why Stone has such a solid fan base\". Allen released his 3rd studio album in 2019 called Building Balance that includes hit songs Brown Eyed Lover, Sunny Days, and Consider Me. Building Balance is a textured amalgam of R&B and soul, which saw Stone draw inspiration from ‘70s funk and punctuate his music with modern pop flourishes. His latest release, a cover of Bob Marley’s “Is This Love”, is the first song off his upcoming acoustic album APART, due to releases Nov 12th. “This album was a way to pay homage to the songs that have been my foundational support for the last decade, and to also pay homage to all the people who’ve loved these songs over the years,” says Stone. He has performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, as well as the Special Olympics opening ceremony, NPR’s Tiny Desk, and has been a guest mentor on American Idol.\n\nFor more information, visit allenstone.com\n\nDescendents - Buzzcocks\n\nDescendents with, Buzzcocks and Surfbort.
