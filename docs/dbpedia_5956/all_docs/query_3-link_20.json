        "text": "Reserved Balcony, GA Floor. Doors 7pm / Show 8pm\n\nAllen Stone is an R&B / soul singer from Chewelah, WA. The son of the pastor of the local church, he was immersed in gospel from an early age until he found funk and soul as a teenager through Stevie Wonder’s Innversions. Billboard has praised his “disarmingly soulful vocals” and WXPN says \"his energetic shows, plus his warm and evocative albums, explain why Stone has such a solid fan base\". Allen released his 3rd studio album in 2019 called Building Balance that includes hit songs Brown Eyed Lover, Sunny Days, and Consider Me. Building Balance is a textured amalgam of R&B and soul, which saw Stone draw inspiration from ‘70s funk and punctuate his music with modern pop flourishes. His latest release, a cover of Bob Marley’s “Is This Love”, is the first song off his upcoming acoustic album APART, due to releases Nov 12th. “This album was a way to pay homage to the songs that have been my foundational support for the last decade, and to also pay homage to all the people who’ve loved these songs over the years,” says Stone. He has performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, as well as the Special Olympics opening ceremony, NPR’s Tiny Desk, and has been a guest mentor on American Idol.\n\nFor more information, visit allenstone.com\n\nDoors at 6:00\n\nBegins at 7:00\n\nThe Commons at KU presents: An Evening with Ocean Vuong, in conversation with Chloé Cooper Jones\n\nOcean Vuong is the author of the critically acclaimed poetry collections Night Sky with Exit Wounds and Time is a Mother, as well as the New York Times bestselling novel On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous.
