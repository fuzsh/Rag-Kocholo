        "text": "Independence Hall\n\nDuring the blistering summer of 1776, 56 delegates gathered at the Pennsylvania State House and pledged their “lives, their fortune and their sacred honor” in the pursuit of independence.\n\nNow known as Independence Hall, the UNESCO World Heritage Site is where the Declaration of Independence was signed, finalizing the colonies’ break with England.\n\nEleven years later, representatives from 12 states gathered once again at the State House to shape the U.S. Constitution, finally creating one unified nation.\n\nA national treasure, Independence Hall is one of only 25 World Heritage sites in the nation, placing it in the company of the Statue of Liberty and Yellowstone National Park.\n\nHow to Experience Independence Hall\n\nIndependence Hall is open to the public via ticketed tours only (except during select times in January and February).\n\nVisitors looking to tour Independence Hall between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. must reserve tickets in advance for all tours of Independence Hall.\n\nVisitors can reserve tickets online at www.recreation.gov or by calling (877) 444-6777 between 10 a.m. to midnight EST. Tours start at 9 a.m. with the last tour leaving at 4:40 p.m. Tickets are free with a $1 per ticket administrative fee. Tickets must be presented in printed form or on your mobile device. Visitors are encouraged to arrive 30 minutes before their tour time to go through security.\n\nVisit the National Park Service’s official site for more info on visiting Independence Hall.\n\nResidents and visitors can also snag spectacular views of the exterior of the iconic Georgian building from multiple Historic District locations, including:\n\nIndependence Mall, the large green space between 5th and 6th streets that runs from the National Constitution Center to Independence Hall, and\n\nIndependence Square, located behind Independence Hall.\n\nRead more about Independence Hall by clicking the button below.\n\nLiberty Bell Center\n\nIt doesn’t make a sound, but the Liberty Bell’s message rings loud and clear: “Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof.”\n\nThis inscription on the cracked but mighty bell is one reason it has been adopted by abolitionists, suffragists and other freedom-seekers.\n\nOriginally adorning the Pennsylvania State House (now known as Independence Hall), the Liberty Bell is an iconic symbol, not just of Philadelphia but of freedom around the world.\n\nHow to Experience the Liberty Bell Center\n\nNo tickets are required to visit the Liberty Bell. During the busiest times, guests should plan for a potentially long wait to enter.\n\nPro tips:\n\nYou can increase your odds of avoiding a long line by visiting early in the day.\n\nCheck the weather before heading out. Visitors wait outside in an uncovered area. (Read: Bring an umbrella if there’s a chance of rain.)\n\nThere are very few places to sit while waiting in line. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes or bring a light chair if unable to stand for long periods.\n\nNote: Guests must pass through a security-screening area to enter.\n\nVisit the National Park Service’s official site for more info on visiting the Liberty Bell.\n\nThe experience of getting close to the bell can’t be beat, but if you’re in a hurry, you can catch a glimpse of it through an open-to-the-public eastward-facing window on the Liberty Bell Center.\n\nRead more about the Liberty Bell by clicking on the button below.\n\nThings to Do Nearby\n\nIndependence Hall and the Liberty Bell are inarguably two of the most iconic attractions in Philadelphia. But they’re far from the only things to do in Philadelphia’s Historic District.\n\nBefore or after a visit to the Bell and the Hall, make time to explore some (or all!) of the following attractions within walking distance:\n\nIndependence Visitor Center\n\nThe Independence Visitor Center at 6th and Market streets serves as a clearinghouse of great visitor information. It’s also the spot to ask real, live experts for Philly tips. Don’t miss the Official Welcome Film of Philadelphia.\n\nBetsy Ross House\n\nAmerica’s most famous flag maker greets guests at her 18th-century upholstery shop, part of a cozy dwelling where visitors learn about Ross’ life and legend, and enjoy programs, storytelling and activities.\n\nElfreth’s Alley\n\nElfreth’s Alley boasts 300 years of history on its charming cobblestone road lined with quaint row houses. While a modern city has sprung up around it, the alley preserves three centuries of evolution through its old-fashioned flower boxes, shutters, Flemish bond brickwork and other architectural details. Don’t miss Bladens Court, a “secret” alley off of Elfreth’s Alley.\n\nThe African American Museum in Philadelphia\n\nThis museum has as a permanent core exhibition, Audacious Freedom, a groundbreaking historic and cultural display spanning two floors and presenting the stories of African Americans such as Richard Allen, Octavius Catto and Harriet Tubman through a series of informative and interactive presentations. The upper galleries host a rotating calendar of special exhibitions.\n\nFranklin Square\n\nEnjoy the outdoors at this fun-filled park named in honor of Benjamin Franklin. Take a mini-tour of Philadelphia as you putt-putt your way through the city’s iconic sites during a round of Philly Mini Golf, or enjoy a nostalgic ride on the Parx Liberty Carousel, a classic tribute to Philadelphia’s great heritage of carousel-making. There’s also a fountain (which features seasonal water shows and nighttime light shows!), the SquareBurger food stand, and lots of open space to lounge or run around.\n\nThe President’s House\n\nBefore the White House, there was The President’s House, home to both George Washington and John Adams, when Philadelphia was the capital of the United States from 1790 to 1800. The open-air President’s House exhibit commemorates the nation’s first executive mansion and reveals a long-obscured glimpse into the lives of the enslaved Africans who toiled at the house during Washington’s presidency. For a deep dive into more than 300 years of Black history in Philly — including special tours of The President’s House and other sites — check out The Black Journey Tour.\n\nMuseum of the American Revolution\n\nJust steps from Independence Hall, the Museum of the American Revolution traces the evolution of the American colonies from the earliest days of unrest through a legendary war and the improbable victory that led to a new nation. Immersive exhibitions and priceless artifacts include General Washington’s original headquarters tent, Revolutionary War weaponry, centuries-old military documents and hundreds of other authentic objects.\n\nNational Constitution Center\n\nIt’s only four pages long, but the U.S. Constitution is among the most influential and important documents in the history of the world. The 160,000-square-foot National Constitution Center dives into all aspects of this amazing document — drafted just a few blocks away — through high-tech exhibits, artifacts and interactive displays.\n\nThe Franklin Fountain\n\nThis popular old-timey ice cream parlor serves up handmade ice cream, house sodas, the best egg cream in the country and other sweet treats in a variety of flavors. The shop also offers over-the-top sundaes with names that pay homage to the neighborhood’s historical significance, including the Franklin Mint (mint chip and vanilla ice creams, chocolate, marshmallow sauce, and whipped cream) and the Lightening Rod (brownie chunks with coffee ice cream, espresso beans, whipped cream and a salty pretzel rod).\n\nU.S. Mint at Philadelphia\n\nThe U.S. Mint at Philadelphia can cast nearly 2 million coins each hour. Fortunately, it costs exactly zero coins to take a tour to see it. The mint offers free self-guided tours from an enclosed catwalk 40 feet above the factory floor. The 45-minute tour highlights include America’s very first coining press dating back to 1792, seven turn-of-the-century Tiffany glass mosaics and push-button stations showing videos about the minting process (narrated by late Phillies announcer Harry Kalas).\n\nMore Things to Do\n\nFor even more things to do, check out our guides to hidden gems in Greater Philadelphia, off-the-beaten-path attractions and museums, and great museums and attractions in Greater Philadelphia."
