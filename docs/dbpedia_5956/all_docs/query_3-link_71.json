        "text": "Liberty Hall is an irreplaceable American landmark. It is beautifully located in the small town of Machiasport in rural Washington County, a rugged and unspoiled area of Down East Maine. Built overlooking the site of the first naval battle of the Revolutionary War, Liberty Hall is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nBuilt in 1873, Liberty Hall served as Machiasport's Town Hall and as its cultural and community center for over a hundred years. The building was closed by the town in 2000 because of declining condition and safety hazards. A spirited and highly effective local campaign has, since 2005, raised almost one million dollars to save Liberty Hall. Phase One, Phase Two and much of Phase Three of a projected four-phase restoration have now been completed. We are urgently seeking funds to complete the project.\n\nLiberty Hall has long inspired all who saw it. A proud symbol of American history and Maine's distinguished architectural past, a fully renovated Liberty Hall promises to become a vital center for the renewal of community life. Its potential as a focus of historical, cultural and civic activity extends further than Machiasport to encompass Washington County and beyond."
