        "text": "1861\n\nAid to the Sandwich Volunteers: Several of the citizens of this place (Barnstable) contributed liberally to the fund for the purchase of uniforms and equipment for the Sandwich volunteers, over $200 having been raised in the course of a few hours. Judge J. M. Day, and Hon. George Marston, subscribed $25 each, for this purpose.\n\n1871\n\nDecoration Day: One week from to-day is Decoration Day, and our Cape citizens should not let it pass without public observance. We are requested to call upon the citizens of Barnstable to meet at Liberty Hall, in Centreville, on Thursday afternoon next, at 3 o'clock, to make arrangements for decorating the graves of our fallen heroes in the several villages, for having some appropriate public services at the Monument in Centreville, and for perfecting an organization that shall hereafter have the matter in charge. It is hoped there will be a full attendance, and that arrangements will be fully entered upon by which the day will be appropriately observed.\n\n1881\n\nBarnstable: The fine bark Mary S. Ames, commanded by Capt. Elijah Crocker of this village, has sailed from New Bedford for San Francisco, loaded with whalemen's stores and coal. Capt. Crocker is accompanied by his wife and two children. Bon voyage.\n\n1891\n\nHyannis: Carpenters, painters, masons, paper hangers and, in fact, all having anything to do with building, repairing or improving in any way a house, are now eagerly sought after and have more work than they can possibly do in the required time.\n\n1921\n\nAbout fifty members of the Hyannis Woman's Club accepted the invitation of the Woman's Club of Brewster for last Thursday, and all report an interesting and delightful afternoon. The Brewster Club was a most agreeable hostess receiving her guests with great cordiality. A reception, an address by Rev. Sarah A. Dixon, and an entertainment made up the program, and bountiful refreshments were served. The Hyannis ladies made the trip by automobile, members owning cars placing them at the disposal of the Club.\n\n1931\n\nToday the American Red Cross celebrates its 50th birthday among its different chapters and at the headquarters in Washington. The Cape Cod chapter tonight serves dinner at the Hyannis Inn to many officers and guests. Afterwards, a radio broadcast will be heard from Washington where the largest celebration will be held. Among the speakers, President Hoover will be the most prominent.\n\n1941\n\nThe President of the James Otis Foundation, John D. W. Bodfish of Hyannis, announces that memorial services will be held at the grave of James Otis, the patriot, in the Granary Burial (Burying) Ground on Tremont Street in Boston tomorrow (May 23) at 12 o'clock noon. Wreaths will be placed on the patriot's grave by Leverett Saltonstall (Governor of Massachusetts), and Maurice J. Tobin, Mayor of Boston. Judge Daniel T. O'Connell, chairman of the advisory board of the Foundation, is arranging the ceremonies and representatives of a number of patriotic societies are cooperating with him. (Note: Patriot James Otis, Jr. was born at West Barnstable on Feb 5, 1725, and died at Andover, MA on May 23, 1783.)\n\n1951\n\nAtomic Films Ready: The Civil Defense Office for Region 7, located at the Town Office Building, Hyannis, Massachusetts, Victor F. Adams, director, announces two films ready for use: \"Survival Under Atomic Attack\" and \"Can You Beat an A Bomb?\" Both films are talking movies and take about 30 minutes each to run. They are available to all groups wishing to use them and may be borrowed on application to the Civil Defense Regional Office at the above address.\n\n1961\n\nTown Topics: Cy Crowell of Crowell Brothers Delivery Service tells us that early bird tourists are already asking for directions to Jack Kennedy's house in the Port &mldr; Speaking of JFK, there is a persistent rumor that he may stop over here on his return trip from Canada before he leaves for France.\n\n1971\n\nAfter seven years of planning and construction, Cape Cod Community College's new campus in West Barnstable is ready for its debut. College officials are inviting the public to tour the new facilities on Route 132 at Open House on Sunday, May 23, from 3 to 5 p.m. Student guides will conduct tours of the six buildings, and a color slide show depicting student life and the campus complex will run continuously in the library &mldr; Cape Cod Community College opened in September, 1961, with 161 students and a faculty of five occupying two 19th century buildings in Hyannis, formerly headquarters for the Hyannis Normal School and Massachusetts Maritime Academy. Since the new campus in West Barnstable opened, it has bustled day and night with classes, student-sponsored activities, and meetings of community organizations.\n\n1981\n\nBuilding Soars in Barnstable: Spurred by a spurt in commercial building and over a million dollarsâ€™ worth of homes in Centerville, construction has soared in the town of Barnstable. Heights of almost $7 million in March and almost $6 million in April have tripled the average monthly totals of the last three or four years. Residential homes have carried the load of building in town since the boom of the early 1970s. Such construction has lagged in other parts of the country. They came in at over $2 million here in both of the last two months.\n\n1991\n\nThe preliminary work for the repaving of Main Street, Hyannis began this week with the raising of drainage structures and improvements to some drainage systems. The final paving schedule was originally planned for the nights of May 28 and 29, but the town of Sandwich would not allow the asphalt plant to operate at night. The final paving is now scheduled to be done between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on May 28-30, weather permitting. One lane of traffic will remain open throughout the construction period. All work, including road markings, should be completed during the first week in June.\n\n2001\n\nPolice Peddle Bikes: The Barnstable Police Department is looking to off-load about 75 bicycles of all shapes, sizes and conditions this Saturday. The auction will be held at the police facility on Phinney's Lane and bidders must preregister between 9 and 10 a.m. The auction helps the department keep its basement clean of abandoned and seized bikes from the year."
