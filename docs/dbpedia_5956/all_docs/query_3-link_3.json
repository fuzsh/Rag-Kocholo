        "text": "A 23-acre National Historic site built in 1772 by New Jersey’s first governor, William Livingston, Liberty Hall Museum at Kean University chronicles more than 240 years of American History. The museum also houses extensive collections of furniture, ceramics, textiles, toys and tools owned by seven generations of the Livingston and Kean families. The Firehouse Museum, built in 2004, houses three antique fire engines, including a rare 1911 American LaFrance Metropolitan Steam Engine.\n\nLiberty Hall Museum is appointment only January-March for group reservations (10 or more guests), private events and scheduled seasonal activities; public tours of the museum resume on April 3. Public Tours take place Tuesdays-Saturdays from 10am-3pm, with tours leaving every hour on the hour. Explore the rooms of the Liberty Hall mansion that welcomed many distinguished guests, such as George and Martha Washington, Alexander Hamilton and Presidents Ulysses S. Grant, William Howard Taft, Herbert Hoover, Gerald Ford and George Herbert Walker Bush. Discover a treasure trove of American history with forgotten letters from Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin. Admire fashions of women in the Victorian-era or sip tea on the glass-enclosed porch overlooking the formal English parterre gardens.\n\nFinish with a garden tour observing the artistic display of historical horticulture, including some of New Jersey’s oldest trees. There is something for everyone at Liberty Hall Museum, one of Union County’s best-kept secrets.\n\nDuring a recent restoration of the wine cellar at Liberty Hall Museum, museum staff uncovered one of the largest collections of 18th-century Madeira wine in the United States.\n\nFOR LIBERTY HALL MUSEUM EVENTS & MORE DETAILS, CLICK HERE."
