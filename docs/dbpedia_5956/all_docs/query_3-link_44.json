        "text": "Become a part of America’s legacy when you hold your wedding at the Liberty Hall Museum. Built in 1772, on the eve of the American Revolution, the Liberty Hall Museum is a silent witness to more than 200 years of American history. Dignitaries such as George and Martha Washington, Alexander Hamilton and countless United States Presidents have passed through its doors. Liberty Hall’s serene country setting with its beautiful gardens, expansive lawn, impressive architecture and array of facilities create the ideal venue for your special day. With 23 acres of pristine landscape, fragrant gardens and rolling meadows, the historic grounds at Liberty Hall provide a perfect backdrop for outdoor ceremonies and photos. The 1882 Carriage House is a lovely spot for your reception or cocktail party with wooden ceilings and the classic carriage house wall length door that opens to reveal the gorgeous grounds. Couples that would prefer to have an outdoor ceremony can set up a tent next to the Carriage House. For a more intimate reception the Wagon Shed overlooking the Rose Garden is a lovely, bright space to share a decadent dinner with your guests."
