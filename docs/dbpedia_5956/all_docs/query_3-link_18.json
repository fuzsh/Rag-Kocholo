        "text": "The City of Tyler welcomes filmmakers to the Rose City. We see filmmaking as an art form and a powerful industry that creates jobs, tourism, businesses, and trade.\n\nA film permitting ordinance was adopted by the City of Tyler to facilitate the work of filmmakers from Tyler or those who travel to Tyler for special projects. We work hard to expedite the application and review process and to assist filmmakers wherever possible. Tyler earned the Texas Film Friendly designation of the Texas Film Commission in 2016, recognizing Tyler as a community that welcomes filmmakers and has a bounty of filming sites, natural resources, unique architecture, and talent to include in any production.\n\nHere you will find links to our film permitting ordinance and application form.\n\nIn 2024, Tyler received the Texas Music Friendly Designation from the Texas Governor's office! This recognition not only honors the city's rich musical heritage but also celebrates the ongoing commitment to fostering a supportive environment for musicians and the music industry. Together, we harmonize the notes of culture, creativity, and community, making Tyler a melody that resonates across the Lone Star State.\n\nThe Music Friendly Texas Certified Community Program, the first in the nation since introduced by Texas Music Office in 2016, seeks to foster music business-related economic development and job creation in Texas cities and communities."
