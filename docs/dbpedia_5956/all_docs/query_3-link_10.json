        "text": "United States historic place\n\nLiberty Hall\n\nShow map of Oakland, California\n\nShow map of California\n\nShow map of the United States\n\nLocation1483--1485 8th St., Oakland, CaliforniaCoordinatesArea0.1 acres (0.040 ha)Built1877 ( )Architectural styleItalianateNRHP reference No.89000199[1]Added to NRHPMarch 30, 1989\n\nLiberty Hall is a historic meeting hall used by African-American organizations in Oakland, California. The building, located at 1483-1485 8th St., was built in 1877 as a store and residence. The building was designed in the Italianate style and features projecting bays at its northwest and southwest corners, a bracketed cornice, a frieze with dentils and crown moldings, and a hipped roof.[2]\n\nLocal 188 of the Universal Negro Improvement Association, the African-American fraternal organization founded by Marcus Garvey, purchased the building for its headquarters in 1925. Founded in 1920, Local 188 was the largest chapter of the UNIA in northern California. The chapter renamed the building Liberty Hall, the name used by all of the UNIA's meeting halls. During its time in the building, the UNIA used it for its meetings, activities, and holidays such as Lincoln's Birthday and Garvey Day. A fire burnt the building's roof in 1931, and the UNIA's activism in Oakland declined afterward. The organization sold the building in 1933.[2]\n\nAfter the UNIA left the building, one of Oakland's chapters of the International Peace Mission movement took over the building. The International Peace Mission was a religious movement led by Father Divine, an African-American preacher from New York. Father Divine, who was considered the Second Coming by his followers, was known for hosting free banquets at his home during the Great Depression. The International Peace Mission continued to operate in the building until the 1950s, though its activities declined after the early 1940s.[2]\n\nThe building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 30, 1989.[1]\n\nDescription of Physical Structure\n\n[edit]\n\nLiberty Hall, erected in 1877 as a corner store and flat before being repurposed into a lodge hall by 1928, is a standalone, two-story structure featuring a partial basement and attic. Situated near the Oakland West BART station, it embodies typical balloon frame construction and Italianate design, characterized by a truncated hip roof and a rectangular layout with 28' frontage on 8th Street and 74' on Chester Street. Noteworthy architectural elements include bay windows with umbrella-like roofs on the second floor, extending from the northwest and southwest corners, as well as a drive-through bay at the southern end. A single-room, false front addition built in 1932 extends the frontage on 8th Street to 58'. Presently, the building is in a state of disrepair, evident from broken windows and weathered exterior surfaces. Nevertheless, it retains much of its original character, seamlessly blending the 1928 alterations and the 1932 addition.\n\nThe building is adorned with a classical bracketed main cornice encircling the entirety of its two stories, including the projecting corner bay windows. This cornice boasts a paneled frieze topped by dentils and crown molding. Notably, over the entrance on the north elevation, there is a bullseye motif flanked by brackets. The main cornice brackets, mostly intact, feature a pattern of two rows of overlapping rings. Additionally, a partly bracketed belt course at the second-floor level marks the former location of a removed wooden sidewalk canopy.\n\nThe truncated hip roof features two small dormers, one facing south and the other east, covered with composition shingles. Galvanized sheet metal covers the roofs over the projecting corner bays, while the one-story addition has a built-up roof.\n\nOn the street-facing elevations, original double-hung windows adorn the first and second stories, topped by molded hoods supported by decorative brackets. Each upper-story window opening is slightly arched, with raised panels between the hood brackets, displaying stylized floral motifs. The corner bays house five windows each, outlined with colonnettes, resembling the other second-story windows.\n\nThe exterior is clad in rustic siding, matching the original siding, albeit with slight differences. Notably, the northeast corner features quoins at the second story, and decorative cast iron vents adorn the west side just below the bracketed belt cornice.\n\nThe annex, a utilitarian wood frame structure measuring 30' wide by 51' deep, has a low-sloped, trussed roof concealed behind a false front clad in wood siding. It incorporates remnants of the building's history, such as the eastern wall and part of a stable. Historical records suggest that the space once housed a meat market, with wagons likely utilizing the drive-through on Chester Street to access the stable. Sanborn maps indicate the presence of a smokehouse and fry kettle at the rear of the store, directly accessible from the drive-through."
