        "text": "Let’s take a closer look at some of the top things to do in Chatham, so you can plan a perfect getaway to this small, charming town.\n\nLocated right on the elbow of Cape Cod, Chatham is a popular destination for travelers looking to enjoy the beauty and charm of New England. With its picturesque lighthouse, stunning beaches, and quaint Main Street, there is no shortage of things to do in Chatham.\n\nWhether you’re looking to relax on the beach, explore the town’s history and culture, or indulge in fresh seafood, Chatham has something for everyone.\n\nBest Things To Do in Chatham, MA\n\nThese are the things I love most about Chatham, and tend to do over and over again whenever I am in town.\n\n1. Watch the Seals at the Chatham Fish Pier\n\nIt’s fun to see wildlife no matter what but watching as fishermen toss their day’s catch to begging seals at the Chatham Fish PIer is especially fun.\n\nThe Fish Pier is on Shore Road less than a half mile from Chatham Bars Inn and less than a mile from Main Street. Stopping by without a car is easy for most but there is a small parking lot at the pier if you’d rather drive. Keep in mind that it’s incredibly difficult to score a spot in the height of summer.\n\nTake your seal watching a step further with a seal boat tour.\n\n2. Learn About Great Whites at the Shark Center Chatham\n\nGreat white sharks have a horrible reputation, and their presence in Cape waters has steadily increased over the years. This hasn’t stopped people from going to the beach, but it certainly has stopped many from getting in the water.\n\nThis fact became crystal clear to me one day at Coast Guard Beach in Eastham when I noticed more people sitting on the beach with binoculars than swimming on a hot August afternoon.\n\nThe Shark Center educates visitors through interactive exhibits, displays, and videos about the natural history and conservation of white sharks. Did you know they are a vulnerable species? The Shark Center also hosts scientific lectures covering research and public safety efforts.\n\n3. Visit the Monomoy Wildlife Refuge\n\nThe Monomoy Wildlife Refuge spans over 7,600 acres, offering visitors the chance to explore a diverse range of habitats, including salt and freshwater marshes, sand dunes, and tidal flats. It is the perfect place for nature lovers or bird watchers.\n\nThe hiking trails lead to secluded beaches where you can watch for migratory birds from the observation tower, or take a guided tour to learn more about the wildlife and habitats found in the refuge.\n\n4. Support Independent Books Stores\n\nVisiting independent bookstores in Chatham is a great way to support local businesses. Make sure to check out the section with books about local topics and by local authors that all bookstores have.\n\nYellow Umbrella Books | Located on Main Street, Yellow Umbrella Books offers a diverse selection of new and used books, as well as gifts and stationary. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and they often host author events and book signings.\n\nWhere the Sidewalk Ends | This charming bookstore is located in a historic building on Crowell Road and specializes in children’s books, but also offers a wide variety of books for all ages. They also have a cozy reading nook and a children’s play area.\n\n5. Window Shop on Main Street\n\nEven if you’re not in the mood to buy anything, window shopping on Main Street is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon or evening. The street is beautifully lit at night, adding to the ambiance and making for a memorable experience.\n\nMain Street is lined with beautifully preserved historic buildings that house a diverse range of shops, boutiques, galleries, and restaurants. You’ll be treated to picturesque views of the town’s iconic white steeple church, as well as the adorable flower boxes that adorn the buildings.\n\nThe shops themselves offer a wide range of merchandise, from high-end clothing boutiques and art galleries to gift shops and specialty food stores. You’ll find everything from unique jewelry and artisanal crafts to gourmet chocolates and local wines.\n\nMany of the shops on Main Street in Chatham are locally owned and operated, which adds to the town’s unique character and provides a personalized touch to the shopping experience. You’ll often find the shop owners themselves working behind the counters, happy to chat and offer recommendations.\n\n6. Visit the Chatham Lighthouse\n\nThe Chatham Lighthouse is an iconic landmark and must-visit attraction for anyone visiting Chatham, Massachusetts.\n\nVisitors can take a tour of the lighthouse and learn about its rich history, including its role in guiding ships through the treacherous waters off Cape Cod, like in the the real life story in the film The Finest Hours (one of the many movies filmed on Cape Cod).\n\nFrom the top of the lighthouse, you can enjoy panoramic views of the coastline and the picturesque town of Chatham.\n\n7. See Beautiful Pink Blossoms in the Spring\n\nIf you’re looking for a unique Instagrammable spot in Chatham, there is a stand of trees with beautiful pink flowers located across the street from Chatham Seaside Links on the corner of Seaview Street and Kettle Drum Lane. The best time to catch them in full bloom is typically mid-May.\n\n8. Watch a Movie at the Historic Chatham Orpheum Theater\n\nWhether you’re a movie buff or simply looking for a fun and unique experience in Chatham, the Chatham Orpheum Theater is not to be missed. The theater’s cozy atmosphere, complete with plush seats and vintage decor, makes it the perfect place to catch a movie or enjoy a night out while you’re in town.\n\nOriginally opened in 1916 as a vaudeville theater, the building was transformed into a movie theater in the 1940s and has since undergone extensive renovations to restore its historic charm. Today, the Chatham Orpheum Theater is a state-of-the-art cinema that shows a mix of current and classic films, as well as live performances and special events.\n\n9. Attend a Cultural Event\n\nChatham offers a variety of cultural events and festivals throughout the year, providing visitors with a chance to experience the town’s rich history and artistic community. Whether you’re interested in music, theater, or art, there is something for everyone in Chatham.\n\nCheck out the Chatham event calendar to plan ahead for any time of year.\n\n10. Relax at the Beach\n\nPlease explore all of the activities above, but I know you really want to come to Chatham to enjoy the beaches.\n\nAll of the beaches in Chatham offer stunning views and a variety of activities for beachgoers of all ages. Make sure to bring sunscreen, towels, and plenty of water to stay hydrated in the sun!\n\nLighthouse Beach\n\nHarding’s Beach\n\nRidgevale Beach\n\nCockle Cove Beach\n\nOyster Pond Beach\n\nPleasant Bay (Jackknife) Beach\n\nMUST-KNOW INFO ABOUT CHATHAM BEACHES\n\nSummer Season – Summer season typically runs from the end of June to Labor Day weekend. During that time, lifeguards (where noted) and bathroom facilities are present.\n\nBeach Passes – Non-residents can purchase daily, weekly, and seasonal beach passes online or with cash at Harding’s, Ridgevale, or Cockle Cove.\n\nUnique Things To Do in Chatham\n\nI am always on the lookout for quirky little things to see when I travel. If you’re like me, you will appreciate these hidden gems in Chatham, MA.\n\n11. Find the Home With a Tiny Replica\n\nIt’s adorable and easily accessible from Main Street, so you might as well. While you’re strolling Main Street, walk up Cross Street (behind the Chatham town offices) and look for the teal gingerbread house. There is also a Little Free Library a little further up Cross Street!\n\nIt is a private residence, so just view the replica from a distance – do not go on the property to take pictures in front of it!\n\n12. Visit the Chatham Labyrinth\n\nThe Chatham Labyrinth is an outdoor, circular walking path made of stones, and is designed to encourage introspection and reflection. Visitors can walk the labyrinth at their own pace, either alone or in a group, as a way to quiet their minds and connect with themselves or a higher power.\n\nIt is open to the public and is free to visit, making it an accessible and peaceful attraction for anyone looking to take a break from the hustle and bustle of daily life.\n\n13. Check Out the Occupy Chatham Shack\n\nLocated about a half mile up the right side of Lighthouse Beach (across from the lighthouse) is a driftwood shack that is always fun to spend time at. Not many people include this on their list of things to do in Chatham, so don’t skip this little gem while at Chatham Lighthouse Beach.\n\nFree Things To Do in Chatham\n\nLots of the things I’ve listed above are free, but here are more free things to do in Chatham, MA that I am sure you will love.\n\nCatch a Cape Cod Baseball League Game at Veterans Field and cheer on the Chatham A’s.\n\nTake a stroll down Main Street and enjoy the charming architecture, unique shops, and beautiful gardens.\n\nTake a sunset walk on one of Chatham’s many beautiful beaches, such as Lighthouse Beach or Ridgevale Beach.\n\nVisit the Chatham Marconi Maritime Center and learn about the history of wireless communication and maritime navigation.\n\nExplore the Atwood House & Museum, which offers free admission on certain days of the week and showcases the history and culture of Chatham.\n\nTake a self-guided walking tour of the historic Chatham Village and discover the town’s rich history and architecture.\n\nAttend one of the free concerts or events held at the Kate Gould Park during the summer months.\n\nGetting To and Around Chatham\n\nBringing your car (or having a rental) is the best way to get to and around Chatham.
