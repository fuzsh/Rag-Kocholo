A student of Kentucky furniture cannot be serious until this furniture is part of their vocabulary.\"\n\nMack\n\nImage\n\n\"There’s so much I love about this place! I started coming to the garden as a child when we spent summers in Frankfort. When my daughter was a little girl, I brought her Brownie troop for a tour. Forty-three years later, I’m helping the staff with Girl Scout and school programs! Liberty Hall is a wonderful old house, and I love being a part of it.\"\n\nMarcie\n\nImage\n\n\"You can immerse yourself in the stories surrounding the Brown family of Liberty Hall. The interpretation presents a whole picture of life in early Kentucky and is a perfect springboard for discussing a range of relevant and timely topics.\"\n\nNicole\n\nImage\n\n\"I walk my dog, Molly, nearly every day at Liberty Hall Historic Site. The gardens are beautiful all year long (even in the winter!) making it a pleasant and peaceful place to visit in downtown Frankfort.\"\n\nKaren (and Molly)\n\nGet Updates from Liberty Hall\n\nThere's no better way to stay in touch than to get our monthly newsletter and emails about special events!\n\nSign up!
