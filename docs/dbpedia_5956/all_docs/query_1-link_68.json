        "text": "Revolutionary War patriots gathered under the famous Boston Liberty Tree, an American Elm, to fight British oppression\n\nThe famous Boston Liberty Tree was said to be planted by a man named Jared Bourne. The tree was planted in Bourne’s yard near his house, nine years after he was granted eight acres of land in Boston, Mass.\n\nIn 1630 during the settlement of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, there were vast acres of hardwood forests in the area surrounding Boston and on the islands of the Bay. Between Boston and Roxbury (a town four miles to the southwest) there was a large timbered area referred to as the Boston Â Â Neck. Colonists often travelled between the two towns, transporting and exchanging goods, but found it a dangerous journey because of the many bandits and robbers who hid in and ambushed the travelers. The forest was subsequently cleared and the trees used for firewood and building materials.\n\nThe removal of forests resulted in flooding of the Neck by sea water. Colonists in Boston came together in an extensive effort to replant trees throughout this area in 1646. The Liberty Tree was one of the trees planted on the Bourne property.\n\nBourne sold the house and land in 1665, the tree continued to grow to an enormous size and soon became the icon of freedom and liberty and the meeting place for early American patriots during the time leading up to the American Revolution.\n\nThe elm was called “Liberty Tree” from its being used on the first occasion of resistance to British rule and the obnoxious Stamp Act or Duties in American Colonies Act, March 22, 1765 that imposed a heavy tax on every page of printed paper they used. The tax also included fees for playing cards, dice, and newspapers.\n\nIn revolt, the American Colonists came together to fight the oppressive taxation by the British. Patriots, called the Sons of Liberty, gathered regularly beneath the Liberty Tree and the area surrounding the tree was aptly called “Liberty Hall.” They hung effigies of the Stamp Officer and the overlord from the tree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nA flagstaff was attached to the trunk of the tree that extended above the tree’s canopy where a flag was hoisted to signal to the Sons of Liberty that it was time to assemble and take action.\n\nThe Liberty Tree became an embarrassment to the British Tories and their allies who cut the Liberty Tree down in 1775 during The Siege of Boston. The axe-wielding party, led by Job Williams, made an angry and aggressive scene as they took down the majestic tree, taunting and laughing at the Sons of Liberty, and taking away more than fourteen cords of firewood. A British soldier was killed while trying to remove one of the limbs.\n\nSoon after, a pole was erected from the tree’s stump and a plaque was placed directly over the spot where the tree once stood to commemorate Liberty.Â The plaque reads: “Sons of Liberty 1766 Independence of our Country 1776.”"
