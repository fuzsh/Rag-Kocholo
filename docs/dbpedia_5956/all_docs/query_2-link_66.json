        "text": "During your first in-home visit, one of our local nurse practitioners or physician assistants will ask about your health goals, discuss our services and answer your questions. They will go over the forms that allow our care team to treat you, similar to those you sign in your doctorâ€™s office. They will review your medical history and schedule a future visit.\n\nOnce you have completed your first visit, you can expect preventive care checkups in your home and urgent in-home visits when you need treatment quickly. You can call us anytime for help with symptoms such as:\n\nRash or wound care\n\nAbdominal pain\n\nFall or other injuries\n\nHeadache or dizziness\n\nShortness of breath with activity\n\nPersistent cough\n\nAnxiety or depression\n\nFever or other flu-like symptoms\n\nNotes from your in-home visits are sent to your primary care doctor. We are an added layer of support at home and do not replace the care you receive from your other doctors.\n\nI really enjoy having Landmark as part of my health plan. It feels very good to know if I get ill I can call Landmark and someone will come to my home instead of me having to go to the ER.\n\nOur advanced practice clinicians and care teams live and work in the communities we serve. We go to our patients where they reside and when they need care. We connect as a team in our local offices to collaborate on patient cases to see and treat the whole patient."
