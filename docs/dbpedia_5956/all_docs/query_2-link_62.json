        "text": "The Pilgrim Monument is Cape Cod’s oldest non-profit. Soaring 350 feet above Provincetown, it offers stunning views of the region, commemorating the Mayflower’s first landing in the New World in 1620 and drafting of the historic Mayflower Compact. After being blown off course, it was on our shores that the Pilgrims found safe harbor, spending five and a half weeks scouting the area and meeting the Indigenous Wampanoag people.\n\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt laid its cornerstone in 1907 and President William H. Taft dedicated it upon completion in 1910. That same year, a building was added to house a museum, another first for Cape Cod. Since then, millions of visitors and generations of residents have climbed the Pilgrim Monument and strolled its grounds.\n\nThe Pilgrim Monument remains the tallest all-granite structure in the U.S. The institution remains committed to teaching people about the big role our small town has played in American history.\n\nExperience it for yourself! Make plans to visit to the Pilgrim Monument and Provincetown Museum today.\n\nPlan Your Visit\n\n1920, August 5th\n\nPresident William H. Taft dedicates the Pilgrim Monument on the anniversary of the day the Pilgrims set sail for America. Elaborate preparations are made, including the building of bleachers to hold 3,000 at its base. The day prior, the Atlantic fleet of the U.S. Navy sailed into Provincetown Harbor. Once again, the yacht Mayflower carries a president to Provincetown, dropping anchor near where its namesake is believed to have done the same in 1620.\n\nThe event was followed by a dinner at Town Hall. Afterward, rain forced crowds hoping to celebrate further to take cover. Outside, electricians stood firm, continuing to hang strings of bulbs, lighting the Monument in time for nightfall. Reportedly, festivities then resumed and continued very late into the evening."
