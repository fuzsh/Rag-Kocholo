Bass Hole is at the mouth of Garden Creek and has a long boardwalk that extends over the salt marsh and offers an excellent view of coastal plant and marine life as well as nature’s beauty. Across the river is Dennis’ Chapin Beach. Bass Hole Beach is rather small and, at low tide, has very little water, which makes it perfect for small children. Bass Hole is considered by many to be one of the great spots on the Cape to watch the sun going down. Bass Hole Beach has a large picnic area complete with a pavilion and bathroom facilities. You’ll also find some free parking, and there are lifeguards on duty in season. If you come late in the day for the beautiful sunset, remember that it is a marshy area and bring some insect repellent.\n\nHyannis Ma Vacation Rentals Cape Cod Attractions"
