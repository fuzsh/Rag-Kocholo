These beacons have long served as famous landmarks and fascinating historical sites for the sailors and visitors to Cape Cod, and the whole family will enjoy these unique excursions. Best of all, you can easily visit them from any of our Ocean Edge rentals! Here are a few of the most popular lighthouses in Cape Cod.\n\nWings Neck Lighthouse\n\nWings Neck Lighthouse in Pocasset gives a stunning view of Wings Neck Point. It was first constructed in 1849 to warn sailors of the heavy marine traffic heading to ports in Wareham and Sandwich. A fire in 1889 damaged the lighthouse requiring a total rebuild, but by 1914 when the Cape Cod Canal opened, Wings Neck Lighthouse was operating fully and played a vital role in the operation of the Canal. It has been updated over the years and remains one of the most popular sites in Pocasset.\n\nSandy Neck Lighthouse\n\nThis lighthouse went into service on October 1st, 1826. It sits on a six-mile-long peninsula on the northside of Cape Cod, helping sailors reach the entrance to Barnstable Harbor. It stood “headless” for almost 75 years until volunteers finally restored the lighthouse to the beautiful landmark that it is today.\n\nHyannis Harbor (Lewis Bay) Light\n\nThis lighthouse is officially listed as Lewis Bay Lighthouse, but today its visitors call it Hyannis Harbor Light. Hyannis was a common commercial and fishing port in the 1800s, leading to the creation of the Gammon Point Lighthouse in 1816 on the southern tip of the Big Island. The lighthouse that we know of today was not constructed until 1849, and it has been reconstructed several times throughout the years. Today, it serves as the centerpiece of Hyannis.\n\nStage Harbor Lighthouse\n\nStage Harbor Lighthouse was established in 1880, but there is little information on the early keepers of the lighthouse. The keepers of the lighthouse throughout the 1900s are regarded as some of the best in the business. Visiting the site allows patrons to learn more about these exemplary servicemen, even despite the slight air of mystery. Today, it is still owned by the Hoyt family, who purchased the lighthouse in 1936.\n\nMonomoy Point Lighthouse\n\nMonomoy Point Lighthouse, located near Chatham, was built in 1823 and operated until its deactivation in 1923. Today, the iconic bright red color of the lighthouse is a standout in the area. If you’re in town, take advantage of the Monomoy Island Ferry, which offers a variety of trips, including visits to this monumental lighthouse. Visitors should be aware, however, that physically getting to the lighthouse requires a bit of hiking, so come prepared!\n\nNauset Lighthouse\n\nNauset Lighthouse, or as it is commonly known, Nauset Light, is the most photographed and well-known lighthouse on Cape Cod. It provides a gorgeous view of the Cape Cod National Seashore, and since 1993, the Nauset Light Preservation Society has made efforts to preserve the lighthouse and the surrounding area. Not only can you visit this iconic lighthouse, but you can learn more about the society’s preservation efforts and the history of the area at the education center.\n\nThree Sisters Lighthouses\n\nIn 1836, Eastham residents petitioned to have the Nauset Lights built out of concern for their loved ones at sea. 3 15-foot-high Towers were built and were soon nicknamed “The Three Sisters.” Not long after, the National Lighthouse Board ordered new movable wooden towers to be constructed 30-feet inland, all standing 22 feet tall. The towers were often moved over the years and today are owned by the National Park Service.\n\nHighland Light\n\nHighland Light is Cape Cod’s first lighthouse, opened in 1797, and remains a popular tourist attraction to this day. It is located in North Truro and is owned by the National Park Service as a part of Cape Cod National Seashore. The LED light beacon helps the lighthouse remain a vibrant landmark on Cape Cod. Come experience a lighthouse climb or check out the keeper’s shop!\n\nRace Point Light Station\n\nRace Point Light Station was first lit on November 5th, 1816. It remained a critical landmark to Cape Cod sailors throughout the rest of the 19th century and the early 20th century, and it was electrified in 1957. It has been updated with modern technology throughout the years, including solar lights and wind turbines. The lighthouse remains active to this day and aims to educate the public on the rich history of the area.\n\nWood End Lighthouse\n\nBuilt-in 1872, the Wood End Lighthouse has long provided aid to the sailors near the entrance to Provincetown. The lighthouse was automated in 1961 and remains lit to this day, courtesy of the US Coast Guard. The white square tower features a flashing red light 45-feet above sea level, and the foghorn blasts once every 30 seconds.\n\nLong Point Lighthouse\n\nLong Point Lighthouse was first erected in 1827. At this time, the salt works and fishing village suffered a terrible smell and an enormous population of flies. The unbearable living conditions lead to virtually the entire settlement fleeing, leaving the lightkeepers practically alone. The original lighthouse was replaced in 1875, and the new lighthouse still stands today but is one of the most remote lighthouses on Cape Cod National Seashore.\n\nNobska Lighthouse\n\nThe first lighthouse in Nobska Point was erected in 1829, and it was electrified in 1919 and automated in 1985. Though it was deaccessioned in 2014, the community is still passionate about the lighthouse and helps to preserve and protect the area. Visitors are still able to tour the tower, but the Keeper’s House is currently under construction, as it is set to become a maritime museum."
