        "text": "How and When to Get to Cape Cod\n\nCape Cod is an island, separated by the mainland by the Cape Cod Canal. This man-made Canal, a National Civil Engineering landmark, is the widest sea-level canal (without locks) in the world. It was built to create more efficient nautical trade routes, opening in July 1914. There are two highway bridges that cross the Cape Cod Canal: the Sagamore Bridge and the Bourne Bridge. Additionally, the Cape Cod Canal Railroad Bridge carries railway freight and limited passenger service onto the Cape. The only other way to get to the Cape is to fly. There is air service from Boston, New York, Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard to Barnstable Municipal Airport in Hyannis. Cape Cod is divided into 15 towns with many villages.\n\nHere are a few travel tips from the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce:\n\nBest times to drive to the Cape in the Summer:\n\n– Sunday through Thursday\n\n– Fridays before 2:00 pm or after 9:00 pm\n\n– Saturdays before 8:00 am or after 2:00 pm\n\nBest times to leave the Cape (if you must!) in the Summer:\n\n– Monday through Friday (except Monday holidays between 2:00 pm and 9 :00 pm)\n\n– Saturdays after 2:00 pm\n\n– Sundays before 1:00 pm or after 9:00 pm"
