        "text": "A day of remembrance and good small-town fun.\n\nMarstons Mills Village Day falls on the 10th anniversary of 9/11 and special ceremonies to honor the date will begin at 12:15 pm before the day's activities get underway.\n\nThe remembrance ceremony will include the Centerville-Osterville-Marstons Mills Fire Department Color Guard and an invocation by Marstons Mills Community Church Pastor Earl Roberts, who volunteered with the Red Cross at ground zero.\n\nTo follow the ceremony is another day of small-town fun, with hamburgers on the grill at noon and Liberty Hall’s famous chicken BBQ at 4 p.m.\n\nThere’s music all day, activities for the kids, many information booths staffed by local organizations, a raft of vendors (including a local soap maker), and a best-looking dog contest. Village Day is a dog-friendly event, but keep your buddies on their leashes.\n\nOrganizer Debbie Lavoie said, \"the tag sale is new this year and we have a lot of new vendor tables with fun activities planned. Plus all proceeds from the 50/50 raffle go directly to our scholarship fund. Last year we gave away four $1,000 scholarships. Not too shabby!\"\n\nWhat will make this year's village day awesome?\n\nThis year our honoree is Beryl Lewis, who is approaching her 100th birthday. According to her daughter, Patricia Ekman, her mom has always been a very energetic person who up until she was 93 years old, walked 5 miles everyday. Beryl’s passions are still gardening, cooking, playing bridge and entertaining. She still does all of them with gusto! Everyone who knows her says she is their idol and inspiration.\n\nSept 11, 2011 is Grandparent’s Day. Any child who is accompanied by their Grandparent will get a certificate for a free ice cream cone at Steve & Sue’s Ice Cream – while supplies last.\n\nWe are also fortunate to have an oil painting of Scorton’s Creek (Sandwich) by Marstons Mills Artist Zoe Albino. We will have a silent auction for that painting valued at $800.\n\nIn addition, we will have our 50/50 raffle with all proceeds going into our scholarship fund. Last year we were able to give four $1,000 scholarships to Marstons Mills graduates. Some of the prizes include gift certificates or baskets from: Osterville Fish, Cape Resources, Mills Garage, The Village Mini Mart & Gas, The Salon at the Mills, The Upper Cut Salon, The Plum Porch, Razzamatazz Hair Salon, Sam Diego’s, Cotuit Liquors, Mahoney’s, Pizza Wave, Serendipity, Cape Cod Pie Company, Sweet Repeats Consignment, Green Briar Jam Kitchen, Cape Cod Maritime Museum, Wimpy’s, Riverway Lobster House, Cape Cod Beer, The Mills Restaurant, Cotuit Liquors, Hy-Line Cruises, and Momo's Food Emporium (which is in Sandwich – but the owner lives right here in MM).\n\nTag sale at the school on Main Street. Our wonderful Marstons Mills Librarian, Renee Voorhees, is spearheading that and still looking for items to be included in the sale starting at noon on Sunday. Items can be dropped off on Saturday, Sept. 10 from 10 am to 2 pm and in the early morning (8 am to 10 am) on Sept. 11.\n\nWe also have a wide array of vendor tables – our “non profits” and “for profits” include: Cape Cod Disc Golf Club, Barnstable Land Trust, Indian Ponds Association, COMM Water, MM Public Library, MM Community Church, Liberty Hall, BARS, Marstons Mills Historical Society, Meetinghouse Farms, Girls Scouts of America, Alex’s Lemonade, Operation Christmas Child, Buy Fresh Buy Local, 4H Beekeepers, Green Brier Jam Kitchen, E&T Farms, Winters Work, Linda’s Jewelry, Herseys Handbags, Jans Jewlz, Plum Porch, Salon at the Mills, Twisted Pippy, Barnstable Dog Park Committee, Red Rover Dog Walking, Dogman Dog Training, Barnstable Animal Hospital, Falmouth Animal Hospital, Happy Tails Self-Service Dog Wash, Paws Dream Doggie Daycare, Bark and Bubble Salon, Service Dogs, and Backyard Art – Birdhouses.\n\nWe will have Lunch, a Black Smith Demonstration, Dog demonstrations, Pony Rides, Face Painting, the Moonwalk, Ice Cream Truck, Balloon Art, a Juggler and lots of items to look at and - if so inclined - purchase. And let's not forget the foam fire truck at the end.\n\nThe day ends with the Liberty Hall Chicken Barbeque at 4 pm.\n\nMain Street in the heart of the village will be closed to vehicular traffic from noon to 4 p.m. to make “Made in the Mills” a walkable event. Parking is available at the former elementary school on the Route 28 side.\n\nInformation provided by Debbie Lavoie\n\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
