He starred in The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) and Goldmember (2002) as Mini-Me.\n\n“To be honest, I don’t know how we’d do it without Verne,” Roach said. “We always had ideas of revealing a whole life that he had that would have taken his character much further.”\n\nHe continued: “If Mike cracks it and figures it out, we would definitely do some kind of tribute to him. I’m there if he ever wants to do it.”\n\n27 films and TV shows that were forced to change their title\n\nShow all 27\n\nNow, it’s been known for some time that Myers and co-writer Michael McCullers had ideas for Dr Evil – myers even reprised the role for a guest appearance on Jimmy Fallon last year, so he’s clearly not done with the character. But the fact that they had wider plans for Mini-Me is new.\n\nRoach’s next film is the Roger Ailes film about Fox News, which stars Charlize Theron as Megyn Kelly.\n\nYou can read our 20th anniversary celebration of The Spy Who Shagged Me here.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
