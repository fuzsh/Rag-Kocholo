        "text": "The Will Ferrell project that Hoosiers saw being filmed at the Beech Grove Walmart last year is out.\n\nWe now know who was driving the car that the comedian and actor jumped into; and that the couple of days he and his friend spent in Indianapolis was part of a road trip documentary.\n\nWhat is the documentary 'Will & Harper' about?\n\n“Will & Harper” premiered at the Sundance Film Festival Jan. 22. The doc follows Ferrell and his long-time friend, writer Harper Steele, on a 17-day road trip across the United States after Steele decided to undergo gender transitioning.\n\nMore on Will Ferrell's documentary: His best friend came out as trans. He decided to make a movie about it.\n\nThe IMDB.com page for “Will & Harper” reads: “In this intimate portrayal of friendship, transition, and America, Will Ferrell and his best buddy of thirty years decide to go on a cross-country road trip to explore this new chapter in their relationship.”\n\nThe run time is 114 minutes. We don't know if Beech Grove or Indianapolis scenes made the cut.\n\nWhen was Will Ferrell in the Indianapolis area?\n\nFerrell was spotted filming the project in the parking lot of the Walmart, 4650 S. Emerson Ave., in March 2023. Fans captured the moment, taking videos of Ferrell sitting in a camping chair with a camera crew and then getting into a car driven by an unidentified person in a dress.\n\nThe next day Ferrell took in a Pacers game at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, where he was greeted by Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson.\n\nFerrell later stopped in at The Basket Case Pub in Peoria, Illinois. Pub owner Dannette Wheeler Rumsey said the actor spent about 90 minutes there and sang “She’s a Lady” by himself and “I Got You Babe” with two others.\n\nFerrell explores 'new territory' in documentary\n\nFerrell and Steele met at \"Saturday Night Live\" where the comedian was a cast member from 1995 to 2002 and Steele wrote from 1995 to 2008.\n\nThe writer told friends in an email about plans to transition in 2022, Variety reported Ferrell saying.\n\n“All of us were extremely supportive and expressed love… but that sort of opened the questions like, how can we help you? What do you need us to do?” Ferrell said.\n\nFerrell said he had “zero knowledge” about the trans community before Harper came out to him, Variety reported.\n\n“I had met trans people, but I didn’t have anyone personally in my life,” Ferrell said. “So this was all new territory for me, which is why I think this film is so exciting for us to kind of put out there in the world. It’s a chance all of us in the cis community to be able to ask questions and also just to listen and be there as a friend to discuss this journey.”\n\nFerrell produced the documentary alongside Jessica Elbaum, Rafael Marmor, Christopher Leggett and film director Josh Greenbaum.\n\nThe movie is seeking distribution."
