        "text": "(born 1967). American comedy actor, writer, and producer Will Ferrell was known for his impersonations and for his portrayal of dim-witted but endearing characters. During his career he performed on television, in movies, and on Broadway.\n\nJohn William Ferrell was born on July 16, 1967, in Irvine, California. In high school he drew laughs for reading the morning announcements in a variety of voices. He later studied sports journalism at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. After graduating in 1990, he worked as a sports broadcaster on local cable before studying acting and comedy. After a year of training with the Los Angeles improvisational comedy group the Groundlings, he became a member of the company. In 1995 he was invited to join the television sketch show Saturday Night Live (SNL).\n\nWith his manic energy and outlandish gags, Ferrell became a fixture on SNL. He was well known for his impersonations, notably of game show host Alex Trebek, sportscaster Harry Caray, and U.S. President George W. Bush. While on SNL, Ferrell also appeared in such feature films as the James Bond parody Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997); Dick (1999), a satire of the Watergate scandal; and Zoolander (2001).\n\nIn 2002 Ferrell left SNL to focus on a film career, often collaborating with Adam McKay, a writer and director he had met on SNL. The following year Ferrell was one of the stars in the movie Old School, and he took the lead role in Elf. In Elf he played a charmingly naive human raised in Santa’s village who travels to New York, New York, to meet his biological father. Both films were box-office successes. Ferrell then starred in a string of hit comedies, notably Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004) and the NASCAR spoof Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006), both of which he cowrote with McKay. In 2005 Ferrell portrayed a Nazi playwright in the musical comedy The Producers. He played equally outlandish characters in the sports comedies Blades of Glory (2007) and Semi-Pro (2008).\n\nFerrell’s subsequent film roles included a bumbling scientist in the adventure comedy Land of the Lost (2009) and an alien supervillain in the animated Megamind (2010). Although most of his film work was comic in tone, he occasionally took on more serious roles. In Stranger than Fiction (2006) he played a methodical Internal Revenue Service agent, and in Everything Must Go (2010) he portrayed an alcoholic selling his possessions.\n\nIn 2006 Ferrell and McKay launched Gary Sanchez Productions. Through that company they produced several other movies in which Ferrell starred, including the farcical Step Brothers (2008), which they cowrote. They also produced the buddy-movie parody The Other Guys (2010), the political satire The Campaign (2012), and Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (2013). The production company was also behind Funny or Die, a Web site that first gained notice with a short video of Ferrell being intimidated by his landlady, a beer-swigging potty-mouthed toddler.\n\nFerrell voiced a tyrannical businessman in The LEGO Movie (2014), a computer-animated film that used renderings of plastic LEGO toys as the characters and set pieces. He also lent his voice to the sequel, The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part (2019). In the film Get Hard (2015), Ferrell looks to a black employee (Kevin Hart) for help on learning how to survive in prison after being framed for insider trading. Ferrell played a hapless stepfather whose relationship with his stepchildren is challenged by the arrival of their father (Mark Wahlberg) in Daddy’s Home (2015). In 2017 he reprised the role in Daddy’s Home 2. That same year he costarred with Amy Poehler in The House, about a suburban couple who run an illegal casino in order to pay for their daughter’s college tuition. In Holmes & Watson (2018), Ferrell assumed the role of Sherlock Holmes for the comedic take on Arthur Conan Doyle’s classic tales. His film credits from 2020 included Downhill and Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga.\n\nIn 2009 Ferrell made his Broadway debut in the one-man play You’re Welcome America. A Final Night with George W. Bush, which he wrote. The play featured Ferrell as Bush giving some imaginative reminiscences and defenses of his administration. It earned a Tony Award nomination for special theatrical event and was broadcast on the cable channel HBO. Ferrell also periodically returned to the small screen for guest appearances, most notably on several episodes of the sitcoms 30 Rock (in 2010 and 2012) and The Office (in 2011). He was featured in the comic miniseries The Spoils of Babylon (2014) and The Spoils Before Dying (2015)."
