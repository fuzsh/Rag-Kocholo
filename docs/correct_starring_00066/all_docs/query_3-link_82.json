        "text": "HOLLYWOOD — Will Ferrell received the 2,547th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame today for starring in some of the most memorable movie comedies of the 21st century.\n\nJohn C. Reilly, who co-starred with Ferrell in “Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby” and “Step Brothers,” and Ferrell’s “Saturday Night Live” castmate, Molly Shannon, were among those joining him at the ceremony in front of the Hollywood Wax Museum.\n\n• PHOTOS: Mayor, co-stars praise Will Ferrell as he gets Hollywood Walk of Fame star\n\nMayor Eric Garcetti and Kevin Hart, Ferrell’s co-star in his upcoming movie, “Get Hard,” also attended the ceremony, which came three days before the release of “Get Hard.”\n\n“I’ve never had a mayor say nice things on my behalf,” Ferrell joked after Garcetti praised him at the ceremony. “I’ve had plenty of mayors say horrible things about me. And I mean horrible, hateful things. The mayor of Arcadia despises me. I don’t know why. I never met him, I don’t even frequent Arcadia, but he hates me.”\n\nBorn July 16, 1967, in Irvine, where he was raised, Ferrell graduated from USC with a degree in sports information, but instead pursued a career in comedy. He was a member of the famed improvisational group “The Groundlings,” where he was discovered for “Saturday Night Live.”\n\nDuring his seven seasons on “Saturday Night Live,” Ferrell is remembered for his portrayals of Craig the Spartan Spirit Cheerleader, middle school music teacher Marty Culp and impressions of then-President George W. Bush, then-Attorney General Janet Reno, “Jeopardy!” host Alex Trebek, singer Neil Diamond and the late Chicago Cubs announcer Harry Caray.\n\nFerrell received Emmy nominations in 2001 for outstanding individual performance in a variety or music program and outstanding writing for a variety, music or comedy program.\n\nFerrell’s movie roles include “Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy” and its sequel, “Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues” — he co-wrote both — “The Campaign,” and the Spanish-language telenovela spoof “Casa de mi Padre.”\n\nFerrell’s other film credits also include “Elf,” “Zoolander,” “Old School,” and “The Producers,” which earned him his first Golden Globe nomination for best supporting actor. Ferrell received a second Golden Globe nomination in 2006, for best actor in a comedy or musical, for his portrayal of IRS agent Harold Crick in “Stranger Than Fiction.”\n\nFerrell received a Tony Award nomination for his Broadway debut, headlining the one-man show “Will Ferrell: You’re Welcome America, A Final Night with George W Bush.” At the end of its Broadway run, Ferrell performed the show, live, in its entirety on HBO, earning Emmy Award nominations for outstanding variety, musical or comedy special and outstanding writing for a variety, musical or comedy special.\n\nFerrell and his writing partner Adam McKay are the founders of the video website Funnyordie.com."
