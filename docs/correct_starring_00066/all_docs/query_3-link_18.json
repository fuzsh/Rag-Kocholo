During this era, news anchors were judged far less by their journalistic skills than by their ability to convey ...\n\nAnchorman 2: The Legend Continues\n\nAnchorman 2: The Legend Continues could easily be called Anchorman 2: More of the Same. However, when it comes to comedy sequels, is there a reason to expect anything different? More importantly, is there a reason to want anything different? People...\n\nBarbie\n\nFor roughly one hour, Barbie is a delightful journey into a satirical world of pastels and fluorescents, where everything is awesome and pink rules. With its Lego Movie inspired approach to bridging the “real world” with that of dolls and toys...\n\nBewitched\n\nWarning: vicious personal-sounding attacks to follow. I want revenge on those who stole 100 minutes of my life.
