        "text": "It's hard to believe \"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery\" came out 20 years ago this month. Wondering what the stars of the comedy hit are up to now? Keep reading to see where they all ended up, starting with the actor who played Austin Powers himself, Mike Myers.\n\nRELATED: Child stars: Where are they now?\n\nAfter embodying both Austin Powers and Dr. Evil in three \"Austin Powers\" films, Mike Myers went on to voice the title character of another hit franchise: \"Shrek.\" The animated films kept him busy from 2001 all the way up until 2012 with sequels and television shorts. Mike returned to his roots, popping up on a 2014 episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" to reprise his Dr. Evil character. In 2016, Jay Roach told Larry King there's a possibility of a fourth Austin Powers film in the future. On the personal front, Mike divorced first wife Robin Ruzan 2005 and married Kelly Tisdale in 2010. The couple have three children: son Spike and daughters Sunday and Paulina. Talk about a full life!\n\nRELATED: Beyonce's big year after \"Lemonade\"\n\nElizabeth Hurley plays the gorgeous Vanessa Kensington, Austin's love interest, in \"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery.\" After Austin and Vanessa got married at the end of the film, Elizabeth reprised her role in the first sequel, \"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.\"\n\nRELATED: Tom Hanks' most underwhelming movie moments\n\nElizabeth Hurley has since been keeping busy on the small screen. She had a recurring role as Diana Payne on \"Gossip Girl\" and currently stars as Queen Helena on the E! drama \"The Royals.\" After 13 years together, Elizabeth Hurley and Hugh Grant ended their relationship — but remained on very friendly terms — in 2000. In 2002, Elizabeth gave birth to son Damian with Steve Bing, whom she briefly dated. Amazingly, she named Hugh Grant her son's godfather and the three have remained really tight over the years.\n\nThe second-in-command of Dr. Evil's empire, Number Two, is played by Robert Wagner in \"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery.\" Robert took on the role in all three \"Austin Powers\" films, while the role of his younger self is played by Rob Lowe.\n\nAfter reprising his role as Number Two in the second and third \"Austin Powers\" films, Robert Wagner focused more on the small screen. He had a recurring role on \"Hope & Faith\" from 2004 to 2006 and joined the cast of \"Two and a Half Men\" from 2007 to 2008 as Teddy Leopold. He's been popping up as Anthony DiNozzo on \"NCIS\" since 2010. He has been married to Jill St. John since 1990. Robert has also returned to the headlines in recent years: In 2011, investigators reopened the case of his former wife Natalie Wood's 1981 drowning off the coast of California's Catalina Island. Despite reports questioning Robert's alleged involvement in her death — it's been claimed they got into an argument just before she died — police have said he is not a suspect.\n\nMimi Rogers plays Mrs. Kensington in \"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery.\" Mrs. Marie Kensington is Austin Powers' original sidekick from the '60s and the mother of Elizabeth Hurley's character, Vanessa Kensington.\n\nWith roles on several hit television shows, Mimi Rogers has been a busy actress since appearing in the first \"Austin Powers\" film. From 1998 to 1999, she starred as Agent Diana Fowley on \"The X-Files\" then took on the part of Robin Schmidt on \"Two and a Half Men\" from 2011 to 2014. Mimi has also appeared on \"Mad Men\" and \"NCIS,\" where she acted alongside her \"Austin Powers\" co-star Robert Wagner. She's appeared on the Amazon Prime series \"Bosch\" since 2014. Mimi married longterm boyfriend Chris Ciaffa, a producer, in 2003 after they welcomed two children together. The couple is still together.\n\nSeth Green plays Scott Evil in \"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery\" — villainous Dr. Evil's only son. Even though Dr. Evil never finds his offspring to be evil enough, Seth does a great job of playing the relatively normal young man. He reprised the role in the sequels.\n\nSince playing Scott Evil in the \"Austin Powers\" films, Seth Green has been working steadily in Hollywood. The actor has appeared in dozens of television shows and most notably has voiced the role of Chris Griffin on \"Family Guy\" since 1999. He's also a creator, producer, voice actor, director and writer on Adult Swim's beloved sketch comedy show \"Robot Chicken,\" which launched in 2005. Seth married his girlfriend of four years — actress and producer Clare Grant — in 2010.\n\nWill Ferrell makes an appearance in \"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery\" in the role of Mustafa, one of Dr. Evil's henchmen. Dr. Evil drops Mustafa into a pit of fire after his unfreezing process leaves Dr. Evil's beloved cat, Mr. Bigglesworth, without any hair.\n\nAfter appearing in the second installment of the franchise, \"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,\" only to have his character Mustafa killed off one more time, Will Ferrell went on to make many major and beloved movies. The \"Saturday Night Live\" alum appeared in wildly successful films like 2004's \"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,\" 2005's \"Wedding Crashers\" and 2008's \"Step Brothers.\" He also starred in 2013's \"Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues,\" 2016's \"Zoolander 2\" and has made several appearances on \"SNL\" since leaving the sketch comedy show in 2002. He also occasionally takes on small roles in TV projects that star his friends, including on comedies like \"30 Rock,\" \"The Office,\" \"Eastbound & Down\" and \"The Last Man On Earth.\" He also owns Gary Sanchez Productions. Will married Viveca Paulin in 2000 and they have gone on to have three sons together."
