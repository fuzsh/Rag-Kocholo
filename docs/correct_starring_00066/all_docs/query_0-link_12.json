        "text": "Will Ferrell is one of the most iconic leading men in comedy. Born and raised in California, Ferrell used comedy as a way to make friends as a youth in suburbia. In his senior year of high school, he and a friend would perform comedy skits over the school’s intercom system (with cooperation from the principal). Ferrell also performed comedic skits in the school’s talent shows and was voted “Best Personality.” In 1991, his mother encouraged him to pursue his passions, so he moved to Los Angeles. He successfully auditioned for the comedy group The Groundlings, where he spent time developing his improvisation skills.\n\nSNL and Beyond\n\nA producer for Saturday Night Live saw Ferrell in the improv group. During a time when SNL was declining in popularity in 1994 and 1995, Ferrell was asked alongside two other members to audition for the sketch comedy show to audition for Lorne Michaels. He nailed it, joining SNL in 1995 and stayed on for seven years. He has hosted the show five times, becoming a member of the show’s Five-Timers Club. During his time on SNL, Ferrell appeared in a multitude of comedy movies: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, A Night at the Roxbury, Superstar, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, and Zoolander.\n\nContinuing to land comedy roles like Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy and Starsky & Hutch he earned a place among Hollywood’s Frat Pack (usually considered to include Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Jack Black, Paul Rudd, and Vince Vaughn). When he starred in the now-iconic fan-favorite Step Brothers with frequent collaborator John C. Reilly in 2008, viewers were either unamused by the duo, or loved their crazy antics. We are the latter. With 128 acting credits under his belt now, with nine upcoming projects, Ferrell is also a writer and producer. He can next be seen in the Barbie movie, coming out in theaters Friday, July 21.\n\nSee below our 5 picks of Will Ferrell at his most feral:"
