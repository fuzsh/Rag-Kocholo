        "text": "Oh behave!\n\nIt looks like Austin Powers’ fans could be getting the fourth installment to the movie series they’ve been hankering for – one day anyway.\n\nJay Roach, who directed the first three movies, says he’s definitely up for revisiting the super spy, played by Mike Myers, in a brand new film.\n\n‘You know, [Mike Myers and I] talk about it [a fourth film] every time we get together,’ he said in an interview on US TV show Larry King Now.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n‘I would say it’s in a latent phase right now but someday if we find the right idea that seems to have it earn itself, for sure.\n\n‘Mike gave me the break of a lifetime in letting me direct so I’m always good to go.’\n\nThe first movie Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery was a huge success when it was released in 1997 and follow-ups, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Austin Powers in Goldmember came out a few years later.\n\nMike famously starred as Austin as well as the wonderfully hilarious villain Dr Evil (he also played Fat Bastard and Number 3 in the later films).\n\nWhile it’s been 14 years since the third movie came out, Mike, who produced and wrote the movies as well as starring in them, has previously said he’d love to make a fourth film.\n\nMeanwhile actor Verne Troyer, who played Mini-Me in the second and third film, is also keen to reprise his role.\n\n‘I love working with Mike and we have a great camaraderie together so whatever he comes up with, I’d love to do it,’ he told reporters while promoting British movie Convenience last year.\n\n‘Mini-Me was a big character in the films, so I don’t see why he wouldn’t be in it.’\n\nMORE : Austin Powers star Mike Myers is looking a bit different these days…"
