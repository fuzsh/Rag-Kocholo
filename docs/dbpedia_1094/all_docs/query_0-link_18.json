All current and past Schools of the Institute are represented by the scholars in the series. Contents of these files may include applications, letters of reference, invitation letters, and correspondence related to administrative matters such as travel and housing. In some cases there is correspondence related to a Member's activities after leaving the Institute.\n\nThe vast majority of the series concerns those who accepted the Institute invitations, but there are some declinations and, in a few cases, people who died before arriving at the Institute. Files may not reflect all visits by a person to the Institute, especially for those with additional visits that took place after 1989. Some files or portions of files pertain to visits to the Institute that were not Memberships, including for people who served as assistants to various Institute Faculty members and were offered academic term and summer visitorships.\n\nThe files of Members who later became IAS Faculty are kept with the Director's Office Faculty files.\n\nReturn to Table of Contents »\n\nAdministrative Information\n\nPublication Information\n\nShelby White and Leon Levy Archives Center\n\nHistorical Studies-Social Science Library\n\nEinstein Drive\n\nPrinceton\n\nNJ, 08540\n\n609-734-8375\n\narchives@ias.edu\n\nRevision Description\n\nNovember 28, 2018\n\nConditions Governing Access note\n\nAdministrative records of the Institute are closed for 30 years from the date of creation. In addition, letters of recommendation are closed until the death of both the author and the subject of the recommendation.\n\nImmediate Source of Acquisition note\n\nWhile most materials in the series originated with the Office of the Director, in some cases files were generated by the individual scholar or other administrative departments at the Institute.\n\nReturn to Table of Contents »\n\nRelated Materials\n\nRelated Archival Materials note\n\nWhile this series contains files for thousands of people who visited the Institute, it does not include files for everyone who came to the Institute as a Member. For the most part, the files of those who came to the Institute as Members originally and were later appointed to the Faculty were moved to the Director's Office Faculty files series, though there are some exceptions. Files for those who came to the Institute primarily as Visitors or Assistants are in the Director's Office Visitor and Assistant files series.\n\nThe files in this series were maintained by the Director's Office. The Institute's Schools also often kept separate files on their Members. These files are found in the record groups corresponding to an individual Member's School of affiliation.\n\nReturn to Table of Contents »\n\nCollection Inventory"
