This hands-on session will explore ways in which to use authentic, historical scientific instruments and their replicas to teach history of astronomy, navigation, and surveying to college students, school children, teachers, and the general public. We will describe the hands-on activities, do-it yourself instrument kits, and curricula that we have been developing for use in our universities, museums, and outreach programs. Part of the session will be devoted to participants building two instruments and taking them outside to make some measurements.\n\n3:00 - 4:00 pm Historical Studies on Astronomy I\n\nChair: Patricia S.
