        "text": "We’re still finishing up our small cache of rediscovered DVDs, and on today’s disc there’s one programme – Hawking. It’s a BBC film made quite a while before the movie The Theory of Everything and stars young Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Hawking. The film does a nice fake-out at the start. We first see a young Hawking sitting watching television – he’s actually watching Professor Fred Hoyle on TV saying that the universe has no beginning – that it always existed. This is the Steady State theory, of which Hoyle was the main promoter. I thought perhaps that this was a bit of Archive footage, but Hoyle is played here by Peter Firth.\n\nHawking is watching the TV, sitting in his characteristic slumped pose. But when Hoyle’s broadcast ends, he stands up and switches the TV off. This is young Stephen Hawking, before his motor neurone disease took hold.\n\nIntercut with these scenes are scenes from later – 1978 to be exact – as scientists Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson are being interviewed before their Nobel Prize ceremony. Penzias plays a recording for the reporter – it sounds like white noise – and tells him “This is the most profound thing you will hear in your entire life.”\n\nThe earlier scene with Hawking is actually in St Albans – which just a few miles from where I live. That’s Lisa Dillon who plays Jane Wilde.\n\nPhoebe Nicholls plays Hawking’s mother Isobel.\n\nIt’s Hawking’s 21st birthday, and he had invited Jane to his party. They’re in the garden, looking up at the stars, vaguely flirting. She suggests they should go back to the party. But he finds he can’t get up.\n\nIn hospital, he undergoes some unpleasant tests.\n\nEventually, the doctor tells him he has motor neurone disease. The neurones that send signals to his muscles are dying. Eventually, his muscles will waste through lack of use. And he will die.\n\nBut he still embarks on his PhD. His father Frank takes him to Cambridge, and without Stephen knowing, he finds his PhD supervisor, and asks him for his help. “Physics means everything to him. I want him to be happy, Mr Sciama.” Sciama replies “What can I do?” “I want you to set him a question that he can finish. Something easy enough for him to finish. Before he dies.”\n\nDennis Sciama is played by John Sessions. He tells Frank that he can’t do what he asks.\n\nStephen briefly meets Fred Hoyle.\n\nThere’s some famous faces among Stephen’s college friends. Bertie Carvel plays George Ellis.\n\nTom Ward off of Silent Witness plays Roger Penrose.\n\nAlice Eve plays Martha Guthrie, whom Hawking chats up in the bar using Einstein’s theory of relativity. It almost works until she asks him what his star sign is.\n\nHe has another encounter with Hoyle. “The thing about a big bang is that it’s wrong. Irrational and wrong. It’s my term, “big bang”. Do you know why I called it that? Because it sounds like a cartoon. Big-bang theory is cartoon physics.”\n\nPenzias and Wilson are still telling the story of the noise. It’s more radio noise than can be accounted for by the energy of all the galaxies. One theory is that pigeons pooping in their antenna horn was causing the extra noise. “We had the pigeons shot.” They cleaned out all the poop. “The pigeons were innocent. The noise was still there.”\n\nHawking visits Hoyle’s lab again. He talks to Hoyle’s assistant, who shows him Hoyle’s new paper. Hawking reads it, and spends the whole night working out the equations.\n\nAt Hoyle’s lecture, Hawking stands up at the end and tells him he’s got his maths wrong. Dennis Sciama tells him he should work on something original rather than just demolishing other people’s work.\n\nHe sits in on one of Roger Penrose’s lectures, where he talks about the work he’s doing on singularities – stars collapsing. This is quite radical at the time. Penrose: “It’s what frightened Einstein.” Hawking: “Singularities can’t exist – the laws of science don’t allow for them.” Penrose persists. “Wrong. Singularities do exist.”\n\nHe takes a train. When the train next to them starts moving, the woman opposite him starts talking about how strange things happen on the Cambridge platform. “Backwards, now. We are having a time of it.”\n\nHawking has an insight, and gets out of the train, looking for Penrose who had seen him onto the train. He starts drawing a diagram on the ground to explain his idea. “What if the whole of the universe were trapped in a region whose boundary shrinks to zero?” Penrose: “A singularity? Nothingness.” “Your theorem works for collapsing, dying stars. It proves that a singularity must exist. What if it works for this? Could it work? Roger, what would it mean if it did?” “A collapse in reverse.” “Which is?” “An explosion.” “Bang.”\n\nHawking proposes to Jane, but she has to take some time to think about it.\n\nHe throws himself into his dissertation based on this idea.\n\nDennis Sciama and Penrose have read his dissertation. Sciama: “The first three chapters – nothing special. The fourth…” Penrose finished the thought: “Mozart.”\n\nJane visits him at his rooms (despite women not being allowed). He has to go and see the bursar at Caius college, as he’s been given a fellowship. Hawking tries to explain his specific needs, but the bursar isn’t being helpful. Jane takes over. “You listen to me, and you listen very carefully. This man cannot walk up stairs. His illness won’t allow it, and his illness will get worse. He needs housing with easy access. And YOU are going to find it for him because if you don’t, all the newspapers will hear about how the bursar of this college treats a man of huge courage, brilliant mind and the capacity to imagine faith like a piece of nothing. Do you understand me? And he’s going to be my husband.”\n\nCurmudgeonly old Fred Hoyle is still skeptical. “If you’re right, which you’re not, there should be some left-over radiation from the big bang. And somebody should have heard it. But they haven’t, have they? I wonder why that could be? Could it be because it isn’t there? Where’s the fossil, Hawking? Where’s the fossil?”\n\nCut To Arno Penzias’s tape of the 3 degrees of excess heat noise they couldn’t explain. “This noise, this goddam beautiful hiss… It connects. It’s the sound of the beginning of time. The leftover heat from the big bang. The three degrees that hasn’t cooled yet. It’s everywhere. It’s all around us. It’s 15 billion years old. And we found it.”\n\nI really enjoyed that. It was interesting, and surprisingly emotional."
