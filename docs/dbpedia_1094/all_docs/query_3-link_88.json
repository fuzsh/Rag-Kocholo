        "meta_description": "The \"dark age\" of the Universe is generally pointed out as the period between the recombination epoch and the horizon of current observations (z=5-6). The arrow of time in the cosmic history describes the progression from simplicity to complexity, because the present Universe is clumpy and complicated unlike the homogeneous early Universe. Thus it is crucial to know the nature of the constituents, in order to understand the conditions of the formation of the first bound objects. In this paper we analyse the chemical history of this \"dark age\" through the creation of the primordial nuclei to the formation of the first atoms and molecules. Then we will describe the consequences of the molecular formation on the birth of the proto-objects. In this context we will mention the important works of Dennis W. Sciama who influenced a large number of theorists -cosmologists and astronomers- on this new field of research dedicated to primordial molecules.",
