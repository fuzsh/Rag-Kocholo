        "text": "Stephen Hawking was born on 08 January 1942, which is the birth anniversary of Galileo . He died this month, 14 March, 2018, which is birth anniversary of Albert Einstein. Two of the greatest minds who shaped the world of Cosmology and Physics. He was identified with them, their work and carried forward their legacy in the world of Cosmology and Physics. He was diagnosed with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) or Motor Neurone disease at the age of 21, doctors had said he will not live more than three years but nature had something else in destiny. He lived more than forty years. In his memoirs ‘My Brief History’, Stephen Hawking writes he succumbed to depression, went fragile, thought why only he, after being diagnosed with disease. Stephen Hawking’s life teaches us lessons of zest for life, determination, hard work, passion and much more. He contributed immensely to the world of cosmology and Physics. His life is an inspiration not for ill and disabled people which he himself was but for all of us. He did best work in adversity. He moved far beyond than a normal human and proved anyone can make mark in this world. He even married twice first in 1965 with Jane Wilde and in 1995 with Elaine Mason his nurse which ended in divorce 2007. Raised his children, family like normal person do even in illness.\n\nEducated at Oxford and Cambridge where he wanted to work with renowned Physicist of his times Fred Hoyle who didn’t take him as his candidate and later worked with Dennis W. Sciama who later called his thesis ‘Best work in the history on the topic’. Sciama had made a team of researchers like Martin Rees, George Ellis, Bardon Carter and others in Cambridge with whom Hawking enjoyed to work and time. Hawking shot into fame when he wrote his book “A Brief History Of Time” in 1988 which sold more than ten million copies and was translated into forty languages. It was best selling book for two hundred thirty seven weeks on Sunday Times. He has written more than ten books like A Brief History of Time, Illustrated A Brief History Of Time, Universe in a Nutshell, Theory of Everything etc., and his autobiography in parts. He was part of Popular Science T.V series like Genius by Stephen Hawking, Stephen Hawking’s brave new world, Stephen Hawking’s Grand New Design, Into The Universe with Stephen Hawking, Master Of The universe, Red Dwarf, Star Trek, Futurama, Simpsons, Danger Decoded, Star Talk, Big Bang Theory and many others. On him the film Theory Of Everything was made for which Eddie Redmayne who played Stephen Hawking in the film won Oscar. To his credit is to popularise science than anyone else in the present times after which Lawrence Krauss, M. Kaku, Neil Degrase Tyson and others followed the same league and are popularising science especially among youth which is very important for the world ,humanity and upliftment of science contribution.\n\nStephen Hawking worked on blackholes, thermodymanics, quantum gravity, singularity. He developed Theory of Cosmology which is union of relativity and quantum mechanics. He developed theory with renowned Physicist and another popular science writer known for his books “Road To Reality” Sir Roger Penrose that ‘time has a beginning in Space and an end in blackhole’. In 2015, he collaborated with investor Yuri Milner to work on alien life which he himself cannot continue because of death.\n\nHawking received many honorary doctorates, awards. He was elected fellow at prestigious Royal Society at the very young age of thirty two. He has distinction of having Lucasion Chair of Natural Philosophy in Cambridge after Sir Isaac Newton. He was even given knighthood which he denied for government’s policy on lack of funding in Science which shows and proves his selfless dedication towards Science and rising above himself for the sake of Science.\n\nHe was known for humourous and witty talks like Artificial Intelligence will wipe the world, Humans should shift to another planet, Planet earth is going to end after thousand years and other things for which he often faced criticism.\n\nFrom politicians, leaders, actors, philanthropists, scientists, social scientists everyone is in grief and sorrow on his death. His death has left an intellectual vacuum and void in Cosmology and Physics. He will be always missed, remembered for his contributions, fighting against life, death adversity, health. Rest In peace Professor!"
