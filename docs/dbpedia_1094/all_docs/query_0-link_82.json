        "text": "The witch (Meryl Streep, right) explains that the Baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily\n\nBlunt) will need to find four items in order to reverse the curse that has left them unable\n\nto start a family. Naturally, we cannot help feeling that the witch isn't being entirely honest\n\nabout why she actually wants these items... Dismayed to have come to the direct attention of sadistic concentration camp guard\n\nMutsuhiro Watanabe (Takamasa Ishihara, right), Louis Zamperini (Jack O'Connell)\n\nis subjected to a series of increasingly brutal and humiliating ordeals. As a massive battle between elves, dwarves, humans and nasty orcs rages about them,\n\nGandalf (Ian McKellen, left) and Bard (Luke Evans) realize that the ghastly orc armies are\n\nbeing directed by the orc lord Azog the Defiler, standing on a nearby hilltop. Clearly, he\n\nmust be stopped ... but how? Much as he hates to play along, Andre (Chris Rock) agrees to smile for the ubiquitous\n\ncameras on behalf of his fianc√©e, Erica (Gabrielle Union), a realty TV star who insists that\n\nher entire life take place in full view of her devoted fans."
