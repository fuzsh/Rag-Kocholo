John Denver is Legacy Recordings’ Artist of the Month. Singer/songwriter John Denver would have been 70 years old on December 31 of this year. In addition to commemorating Denver by naming him the label’s Artist Of The Month, we are supplying The A.V. Club with two—count ’em, two—prize packages stuffed full of a bevy of Denver-related items to give away. Two lucky winners will get: A John Denver beanie (which is frankly quite awesome, it might be the crown jewel of this set); a copy of the limited-edition reissue John Denver And The Muppets: A Christmas Together, with the album cover printed directly on the vinyl itself; and The Essential John Denver, a two-disc set of 36 of the folk singer’s greatest hits.
