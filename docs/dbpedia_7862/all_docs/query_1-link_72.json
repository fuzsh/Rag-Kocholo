The orchestra, mesmerized, follows their lead.”\n\n– The New York Times, December 2023\n\n“It’s the sheer brilliance and ebullience of the music, with insistent rhythms that seem to owe as much to rock as they do to Steve Reich.”\n\n– The Guardian, February 2024\n\nNEW YORK, May 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ — Sony Music Masterworks announces today a unique far-reaching partnership with versatile composer, sought-after musical collaborator and guitarist Bryce Dessner, who is also a founding member of Grammy Award-winning rock band The National. The newly inked partnership will see Dessner’s classical compositions released on Sony Classical, while sister label Milan Records will continue to be a home for some of his celebrated soundtracks. This innovative tailored approach will give Dessner maximum artistic freedom to pursue these two essential strands of his creative output.\n\nDessner will make his Sony Classical début on August 23, 2024 with Solos, a collection featuring a series of unaccompanied instrumental works written by the composer over the past few years. Selected from both his classical and soundtrack worlds, the works showcase not only Dessner’s compositional flair but also the immense talent of his acclaimed collaborators, many of whom work regularly with him and are his friends. Featured soloists include cellist Anastasia Kobekina; violinist Pekka Kuusisto; pianist Katia Labèque; harpist Lavinia Meijer; violist Nadia Sirota; percussionist Colin Currie; and Bryce Dessner himself on guitar. Accompanying today’s announcement and album pre-order is the first single from Solos – “Lullaby for Jacques et Brune” – a lullaby for piano, written by Bryce Dessner for his godchildren.\n\nSays Dessner of these pieces: Writing a solo piece for me is always a great challenge and joy, as you have all the personality and talent of the player plus the physicality and resonance of the solo instrument, a bit like a Shakespearean monologue. These solo pieces for violin, viola, cello, harp, percussion, guitar and piano represent many years of my compositional process. When I began composing, I mainly wrote solo pieces for myself to play and I have always loved unaccompanied instrumental music – including the solo Bach lute and cello suites and the Renaissance lute fantasies of John Dowland, which I used to play myself on the classical guitar. These pieces of mine are often written like poems, where the musical language itself dictates the form and evolution of the piece, and were often opportunities for me to explore more deeply my relationship to the instruments they were composed for. They also represent in each case close collaborative relationships and friendships I have been very lucky to develop with the incredible musicians who play them. Katia, Pekka, Anastasia, Nadia, Lavinia and Colin are all exceptional artists who brought so much of their amazing talent to these recordings.\n\nDessner is a prolific classical composer, whose output has garnered him a Grammy Award and ranges from intimate chamber pieces and scaled-down works for solo instrumentalists to full orchestral scores and concertos.\n\nIn addition to his role as one of eight San Francisco Symphony Collaborative Partners, Bryce Dessner is currently Creative Chair of the Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich, and Artist-in-Residence at London’s Southbank Centre and with the Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra. Major new works include a Piano Concerto premièred by Alice Sara Ott and the Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich in January 2024 and now being performed internationally; a Concerto for Two Pianos premièred by Katia & Marielle Labèque and the London Philharmonic Orchestra; and a Violin Concerto premièred and performed internationally by Pekka Kuusisto. Dessner’s in-demand compositions have been performed by leading orchestras around the world, including the Los Angeles Philharmonic, New York Philharmonic, The Cleveland Orchestra, Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, Philharmonia Orchestra of London and San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.\n\nHe has co-founded several new-music festivals, including the Cincinnati-based MusicNOW Festival in 2006, Copenhagen’s Haven Festival and the Cork-based Sounds from a Safe Harbour.\n\nBryce Dessner’s musical career has been rich and eclectic. Born into a musical family based in Cincinnati, he started out learning the flute as a child before switching to classical guitar in his teenage years, graduating from Yale University with a Masters in Music before finding fame as a founder member, guitarist, arranger and writer for alternative rock band The National.\n\nAlongside his classical compositions, Dessner is also much sought after as a film composer, with recent and upcoming releases including the film Sing Sing starring Colman Domingo (due for release by A24 in summer 2024), limited series Manhunt (released in March 2024 on Apple TV), and John Crowley’s We Live in Time (due for release 2024 on A24). Over the years he has garnered great acclaim for his work on films such as Alejandro González Iñárritu’s The Revenant with the late Ryuichi Sakamoto and for his music to Netflix’s Fernando Meirelles’s The Two Popes. Dessner’s many musical collaborations include working with Philip Glass, Johnny Greenwood, Bon Iver, Steve Reich, Paul Simon, Bruce Springsteen, Sufjan Stevens, Taylor Swift and Thom Yorke.\n\nExtraordinarily gifted, collaborative, secure in his own musical language and brimming with ideas, Bryce Dessner is a singular talent whose addition to the roster is warmly welcomed as he expands the repertoire with his new music, bringing with him his trademark original deep thinking, enthusiasm for all types of music and forward-thinking creative partnerships.\n\nOn this new arrangement with Sony Music, Bryce Dessner commented: “I am very much looking forward to an ongoing collaboration with Sony Music Masterworks and their wonderful team on several upcoming projects around my compositional work.”\n\nPer Hauber, President, Sony Classical added: “As Bryce Dessner embarks on this exciting new chapter with Sony Classical, we look forward to showcasing his extraordinary talent and pushing boundaries of classical music together. We believe Sony Music Masterworks is the ideal new home for his releases and we warmly welcome him!”\n\nAlexander Buhr, SVP International A&R adds: “Bryce is a uniquely gifted composer and musician, and a very important voice in contemporary music. With his broad range of influences and inspirations he crafts music that is daring and ambitious, while making instant emotional connection with the audience. All this is introduced perfectly on Solos. We are very happy to welcome Bryce to the Sony family.”\n\nBryce Dessner’s music is published by and available from Chester Music, part of the Wise Music Group.\n\nBRYCE DESSNER – SOLOS\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\nLullaby for Jacques et Brune\n\nKatia Labèque piano\n\nFrancis\n\nBryce Dessner guitar\n\nTuusula\n\nAnastasia Kobekina cello\n\nSong for Octave\n\nKatia Labèque piano\n\nTromp Miniature\n\nColin Currie percussion\n\nOrnament and Crime I\n\nOrnament and Crime II\n\nOrnament and Crime III\n\nPekka Kuusisto violin\n\nA Good Person\n\nKatia Labèque piano\n\nOn a Wire\n\nLavinia Meijer harp\n\nWalls\n\nBryce Dessner guitar\n\nDelphica I\n\nDelphica II\n\nNadia Sirota viola\n\nOrnament III Piano\n\nKatia Labèque piano\n\nSong for Ainola\n\nAnastasia Kobekina cello\n\nSony Music Masterworks comprises Masterworks, Sony Classical, Milan Records, XXIM Records and Masterworks Broadway imprints.

For the new album, which arrives Friday, April 19, HAUSER has chosen and realized 18 unforgettable melodies in revelatory new arrangements, which were recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Robert Ziegler. Heralding the album’s arrival today alongside preorder is the release of HAUSER’s deeply felt interpretation of the romantic “Kiss the Rain” by the internationally acclaimed Korean composer and pianist Yiruma – listen here and watch the music video.\n\nWrapping up 2023 with the release of his first-ever holiday album, HAUSER shows no signs of slowing down in 2024, as he gears up for his first-ever solo U.S. tour this spring. Kicking off on May 31 at Hard Rock Live in Hollywood, FL, the tour includes stops at iconic venues such as Carnegie Hall in New York, Ravinia Festival in Chicago, Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, and the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. Tickets for HAUSER‘s 2024 U.S. tour are available now at HAUSERofficial.com/event-directory.\n\n“You can’t go wrong giving a beautiful, singing tune to the cello,” HAUSER says of his new album. “There is always a good chance that it will sound even better than the original!”\n\nOn Classic II, which he produced himself, HAUSER reunites with his creative collaborators on Classic – arranger Robin Smith, Ziegler and the London Symphony Orchestra. With Smith, he reimagined his favorite melodies in elegant new settings that feature the solo cello, perhaps the most “vocal” of all orchestral instruments. The melodies he chose were written originally for voice, piano, oboe or – in several instances – entire symphony orchestras, from the Baroque era to the present day. The goal was to make these melodies “sing” anew in the cello.\n\n“This is such a pleasure for me,” HAUSER says, calling Classic II and Classic his “dream albums.” “It’s what I actually enjoy the most – when I come back to my roots, to the classical repertoire. When I was a little boy, this was my dream: to play with an amazing orchestra, in a good studio, on a good cello. These melodies are some of my earliest memories, when I fell in love with music. This comes naturally to me.”\n\nTwo of the melodies he chose for Classic II had a life-changing significance for HAUSER.\n\nThe cellist first heard the luminous “Song of the Moon” from Antonín Dvořák’s opera Rusalka when, as very young cello student in London, HAUSER was chosen to play in an orchestra accompanying soprano Renée Fleming in the aria for a Buckingham Palace performance for Prince Charles. The music itself so galvanized HAUSER that he transcribed it for himself – “a pivotal moment in my life,” he says, that opened up his awareness of how the cello could “sing.”\n\nYears later, before HAUSER launched his career as half of 2CELLOS, the soulful Baroque elegance of the Albinoni “Adagio” inspired him to arrange the piece as a cello solo, to perform in a video he put together. He released it on YouTube, never imagining that it would trend in an epic way – earning some 91 million views. On Classic II, both works have been freshly reimagined to take advantage of HAUSER’s mature artistry and the sumptuous sound of the London Symphony Orchestra.\n\nWhen HAUSER released Classic in early 2020 – before the COVID pandemic and the onset of global political turbulence – the cellist said of the music, “This is what the world needs.” Of Classic II, he makes the same point, adding, “The world needs this music now – more than ever.”\n\nHAUSER – CLASSIC II\n\nTRACKLISTING –\n\n1.

The album is comprised of two acclaimed concert works the composer wrote for the cellist, plus selections from his film scores for Schindler’s List, Lincoln, and Munich. Featuring Williams himself conducting the New York Philharmonic, A Gathering of Friends also includes special appearances by the Spanish guitarist Pablo Sáinz-Villegas and harpist Jessica Zhou. Accompanying today’s album announcement is the first track release, Theme from Schindler’s List – LISTEN HERE – along with a visualizer featuring John Williams and Yo-Yo Ma discussing the poignant theme – WATCH HERE.\n\nTHEME FROM SCHINDLER’S LIST – STREAM / PURCHASE HERE\n\nJOHN WILLIAMS & YO-YO MA ON SCHINDLER’S LIST – WATCH HERE\n\nJohn Williams and Yo-Yo Ma first met some four decades ago, when the Oscar-winning composer became conductor of the Boston Pops Orchestra and Ma was just beginning his remarkable solo career. Their creative collaboration has extended from the concert hall to the scoring stage to the 2008 inauguration of President Barack Obama, all anchored by an abiding personal connection and mutual regard. From their first encounters, each recognized in the other an understanding that, as Williams simply puts it, “music is our oxygen.”\n\nThe centerpiece of A Gathering of Friends is the first recording of Williams’ newly revised version of his Cello Concerto, a work composed for Ma in 1994 and originally recorded for Sony Classical in 2001. As the four-movement concerto was performed over the last three decades, Williams made significant revisions to the score. Ma noted that the new version incorporates even “bigger changes, structural changes,” with a final movement that turns into “one glorious song, spinning and spinning, spinning to the very end.”\n\nAlso heard on A Gathering of Friends are new arrangements Williams created for Ma of three selections from his Oscar-winning score for Schindler’s List and a new arrangement for cello and strings of “With Malice Toward None” from his score for the 2012 film Lincoln. The album concludes with a duo arrangement for Ma and guitarist Pablo Sáinz-Villegas of “Prayer for Peace” from the 2005 film Munich. All three film scores are part of Williams’ enduring partnership with director Steven Spielberg.\n\nThe other concert work on A Gathering of Friends – Highwood’s Ghost – reaffirms the Williams-Ma friendship in the context of the Tanglewood Music Festival and in the spirit of the legendary composer/conductor Leonard Bernstein. Williams composed the work to celebrate the Bernstein centennial at Tanglewood in the summer of 2018, evoking the legend of a ghost said to haunt the Highwood Manor House on the Tanglewood grounds – a ghost that Bernstein memorably encountered. Williams wrote haunting solo roles for Ma and the Boston Symphony Orchestra’s principal harp, Jessica Zhou, who reunite for this recording with the New York Philharmonic.\n\nALBUM ARTWORK (FOR MEDIA USE): DOWNLOAD\n\nYO–YO MA & JOHN WILLIAMS (CREDIT: LAWRENCE SUMULONG) – PUBLICITY PHOTO – DOWNLOAD\n\nJOHN WILLIAMS, YO-YO MA, NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC\n\nA GATHERING OF FRIENDS\n\nCello Concerto (2021 Revision)\n\n1 I.
