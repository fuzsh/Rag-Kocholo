        "text": "February Program Titles Released This Week:\n\nAltitudes & Attitude – Get It Out CD (Megaforce)\n\nAltitudes & Attitude is a project featuring Anthrax bassist Frank Bello and Megadeth bassist David Ellefson, will release their debut album, which follows-up their eponymous 2014 EP. Boasting a deep bench of guest stars, including Ace Frehley (ex-Kiss; the track “Late”), Gus G. (Ozzy Osbourne, Firewind), Nita Strauss (Alice Cooper), Christian Martucci (Stone Sour) and Satchel (Steel Panther), the record represents the fulfillment of a lifelong but little-known ambition for two uniquely gifted artists. As Bello puts it, “All I ever wanted to do was write good songs. I’ve always been a melody guy. I love hooks; I love catchy songs with a good riff.” A kind of rock ‘n’ roll primal-scream therapy, Get It Out is the result of nearly four years of writing and recording sessions — and decades of touring, searching, striving and living.\n\nFrances Cone – Late Riser CD/LP (Living Daylight/Orchard)\n\n“Timing is everything to Frances Cone. Even the band’s moniker is a nod to band mastermind Christina Cone’s family’s own impeccable chronology, borrowing the name from her great-grandfather and father, both born on September 11th decades apart. Then there’s the fact that Cone met her future bandmate and beau, Andrew Doherty, at just the right moment on just the right date — 12/12/12 — for their lives to align. This acknowledged connection to cosmic scheduling also explains why the duo have been so patient in releasing their follow-up to 2013’s Come Back LP. It’s a patience that comes through on each of the 10 tracks that make up Late Riser. Carefully crafted soar on indie pop updrafts on songs like “Failure” or the melodic opener “Wide Awake”. “Unraveling”, a lush pop number with gripping harmonies, hints at Cone’s association with Lucius, while “Arizona” hints towards Justin Vernon’s style of songwriting. Then there’s the title track, a beleaguered and powerful folk number that finds Cone at her most aggressive. Whatever the influence or particular style of sound, each song feels complete, fully realized as a coherent effort from an artist who appreciates the value in taking your time to reach the finish line.” – Consequence Of Sound\n\nGreensky Bluegrass – All For Money CD/2xLP (Big Blue Zoo)\n\nFor more than 18 years, the members of Greensky Bluegrass have been creating their own version of bluegrass music, mixing the acoustic stomp of a string band with the rule-breaking spirit of rock & roll. As they continue to evolve and further define that sound they are breaking barriers with their seventh studio album, All For Money. Recorded at Echo Mountain Recording in Asheville, NC alongside co-producers Dominic John Davis (Jack White s longtime bassist) and Glenn Brown, this set of 12 new songs finds the band pushing boundaries and breaking new ground, welcoming old fans and new audiences alike. They’re going full steam ahead into this new era with both the passion and vigor of a band in their infancy and the knowledge and power of one that s been together for almost two decades and counting.\n\nJoe Jackson – Fool CD/LP/LP+7” (earMUSIC)\n\nFool once again showcases Joe Jackson’s incredible musical diversity and unique artistic vision. If the album had a theme, it would be Comedy and Tragedy and the way they’re intertwined in our lives. It begins with the powerfully mysterious “Big Black Crowd”, which foreshadows a collection that is impossible to describe in one word but undoubtedly musically and lyrically powerful and touchingly beautiful. The striking “Fabulously Absolute” shows a different side of the record with Jackson portraying an almost snarky attitude in his voice and the music showing a very melodic drive. Despite what the title may suggest, none of Jackson’s remarkable songwriting, although multi-faceted, does in any way sound foolish. It is rather a sense of masterful craftsmanship and intent that defines Fool. The listener will find jazz, classic and – of course – pop influences that fuse to make an artistically valuable experience. [Limited deluxe vinyl pressing featuring a bonus 7” also available.]\n\nRonnie Milsap – The Duets CD (Riser)\n\nCountry Music Hall of Fame member Ronnie Milsap returns with a duets album featuring an A-list cast, including Billy Gibbons, Luke Bryan, Dolly Parton, Jason Aldean, Willie Nelson, Lucy Angel, Kacey Musgraves, Little Big Town, George Strait, Jessie Key, Leon Russell, Steven Curtis Chapman and Montgomery Gentry. The Duets includes one of Troy Gentry’s final recordings on the Montgomery Gentry/Ronnie duet, “Shakey Ground.” In addition, Leon Russell, who passed away in 2016, is featured on “Misery Loves Company”.\n\nNight Beats – Myths Of Man CD/LP (PIAS America)\n\nWritten during a particularly destructive period of Night Beats, Myths Of Man is populated by fallen angels, blood-sucking wanderers, and vindictive lovers – sketches of people the band has surely come across during their cosmic roving through the underground – but the character most present is frontman Danny Lee Blackwell, himself. “Myth Of A Man can be summed up as a personal display of vulnerability and guilty conscience,” he explains, “Destroying the mythos of what it means to live and function in society.” With its bold steps forward, the album serves as both a takedown and reintroduction of the band as we know it – the strongest evidence that you’ll never be able to pin Night Beats down. While Blackwell has always fed off the musical legacy of his Texas roots – Roky Erickson and the 13th Floor Elevators, The Red Krayola, The Black Angels and more paving the way for the napalm-coated psych-rock head-trip of past albums – Myth Of A Man has him pulling from the surrogate wellspring of Nashville, TN. It was there that he worked with the eminent Dan Auerbach and a murderer’s row of battle-worn session musicians.\n\nNeyla Pekarek – Rattlesnake CD (S-Curve)\n\nNeyla Pekarek, formerly of The Lumineers, releases her debut album. A fitting subject for Neyla’s first solo release, Rattlesnake is a concept record about one of the strongest independent women and unsung heroes of the old west, Kate Slaughterback, better known as Rattlesnake Kate (who earned her nickname on October 28th, 1925 when she single-handedly defended herself and her 3-year-old son against 140 migrating rattlesnakes. Kate killed all 140 snakes using a shotgun). The 13 original songs on Rattlesnake, produced by Matt Ward (M. Ward, She & Him), were written as a “Folk Opera” shining a light on some of the incredible tales from Kate’s life, including her triumph over a pack of rampaging rattlesnakes, a 40-year love letter correspondence she maintained with a man she never actually met, and more. [Vinyl pressing due February 1.]\n\nMaggie Rogers – Heard It In A Past Life CD/LP (Capitol)\n\nAcclaimed producer/songwriter/performer Maggie Rogers’ new album, Heard It In A Past Life, includes the Pharrell Williams endorsed song that introduced Rogers to the world, “Alaska”, as well as follow-up singles “Fallingwater”, praised by NPR as “a celebration of the terrifying yet thrilling process of change” and “Give A Little”, which Pitchfork hailed as a “cathartic pop song about empathy and unity.” Co-produced with Greg Kurstin and Kid Harpoon, Rogers describes the single “Light On” as “a letter to my fans about the last two years of my life. There was so much change that happened so fast, I wasn’t always sure how to make all this stuff feel like me.”\n\nSoul Asylum – While You Were Out / Clam Dip & Other Delights CD (Omnivore)\n\nSoul Asylum’s last raucous indie releases before signing to major Label, While You Were Out (1986) and the mini-album Clap Dip & Other Delights (1988) have been remastered and expanded with 7 bonus cuts, including 4 never-before released, and includes liner notes by Jon Wurster (Superchunk). While You Were Out was produced by much revered Minneapolis musician Chris Osgood, leader of the groundbreaking 1976 punk band The Suicide Commandos. This set includes the full U.K.-only EP track list of the Clam Dip & Other Delights EP. [Vinyl edition due February 8.]\n\nThe Steel Woods – Old News CD/LP (Woods Music/Thirty Tigers)\n\nThe Steel Woods’ sophomore album, Old News, represents a creative leap for the southern roots rock songwriting team of Alabama native Wes Bayliss and his North Carolina partner Jason “Rowdy” Cope, who completed their first recordings barely months after they first met. Part Lynyrd Skynyrd, Allman Brothers, dual-guitar southern blues-rock with elements of R&B, country, bluegrass, gospel, blues, folk and metal, the descriptively named, Nashville-based band deepens its resolve on a theme-driven album that joins the mystery train of the past with the full-speed loco-motion of the present, seeking to bring people together with the universality of music.\n\nSwitchfoot – Native Tongue CD/2xLP (Fantasy)\n\nGrammy award-winning rock band, Switchfoot, expands on their trademark epic soundscapes and explores new themes and textures on Native Tongue, the group’s eleventh full-length album. Amid an impressive career spanning more than 20 years, Native Tongue is an inspired work of insight and passion from a band that continues to find strength in our differences and hope in what binds us. The 14-song album recorded primarily at Melody League Studios in the band’s hometown of San Diego, CA, includes a wide array of music from the hard-hitting anthemic title-track to more reflective songs such as “Prodigal Soul”, “Joy Invincible” and “Voices”, (co-written and produced with their friends in One Republic). The band interlace empathy and introspection, urging us to “use our lungs for love and not the shadows.” Native Tongue also features a moving collaboration with Kaela Sinclair on “The Hardest Art”. [Limited indie-exclusive vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nToro Y Moi – Outer Peace CD/LP+MP3 (Carpark)\n\nFollowing the ever-emotive Boo Boo, Toro Y Moi’s new album Outer Peace is a time capsule that captures our relationship to contemporary culture into one comprehensive, sonic package. As both a producer and designer, Chaz Bear utilizes abstract sound pairings with recognizable samples for his most pop influenced record to date, including features from ABRA, WET, and Instupendo. This is no departure from his funk and disco roots, which can be heard on “Ordinary Pleasure” later fusing into variations of house with tracks like “Freelance” and “Laws Of The Universe”. Smooth interludes melt into fast paced beats, paralleling the feeling of driving through the Bay Area, where Bear spent most of his time writing the album. Outer Peace is duality. It embodies whatever form you choose to inhabit in the moment. Listen and let your imagination become the universe. [Limited indie-exclusive vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nCDs + Vinyl:\n\nAbruptum – Vi Sonus Veris Nigrae Malitiaes [Reissue/1996] CD/LP (Profound Lore)\n\nOriginally released in 1996 on infamous cult black metal label Full Moon Productions, this Swedish band were always seen as one of the most bizarre, strangest, and otherworldly black metal entities.\n\nArch Enemy – Covered In Blood CD/2xLP (Century Media)\n\nArch Enemy is a Swedish melodic death metal band, originally a supergroup, from Halmstad, formed in 1995. Its members were in bands such as Carcass, Armageddon, Carnage, Mercyful Fate, Spiritual Beggars, Nevermore, and Eucharist. Covered In Blood is a compilation of all the covers the band has recorded throughout their career. [Limited gold colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nBuke & Gase – Scholars CD/LP (Brassland)\n\nThree years ago, Buke and Gase embarked on a major refinement and modernization of their instrumental creations – and embraced electronic music. Scholars began not as the title of their new record, but a new moniker for their artistic project. In a way, their long and roundabout journey has resulted in a sound that’s coincidentally in sync with our most forward-thinking contemporary artists – James Blake, Bjork/Arca, Frank Ocean. They have embraced the same computer-and synthesizer-driven creative tools that make EDM and trap music function, while existing entirely in their own, fully imagined universe of sound.\n\nCane Hill – Kill The Sun CDEP (Rise)\n\nNew EP from the New Orleans rockers, known for their brutal, mosh-pit-inducing songs.\n\nDAWN – New Breed CD/LP (Local Action)\n\nFollowing her acclaimed trilogy of solo albums, electronic R&B innovator DAWN (formerly Dawn Richard) returns with a new album-length project that dates back to her upbringing in New Orleans, taking in the city’s rich traditions and musical heritage. New Breed sees DAWN at her most eclectic, drawing on a wide range of influences and includes contributions from Cole M.G.N (Christine & The Queens, Ariel Pink), Kaveh Rastegar (John Legend, Sia), and Hudson Mohawke.\n\nDead Bolt – Trapped In Chaos CD/LP (Napalm)\n\nThe idyllic slopes and crystalline lakes of beautiful Bavaria stood no chance when Dust Bolt emerged in 2006 to encrust Germany and the rest of the world in hefty, Bay Area-influenced thrash metal featuring crossover influences and killer melodies.\n\nDeerhunter – Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared? CD/LP+MP3 (4AD)\n\nDeerhunter’s eighth LP forgets the questions and makes up unrelated answers. It gets up, walks around, it records itself in several strategic geographic points across North America. It comes home, restructures itself and goes back to bed to avoid the bad news. From the opening harpsichord and piano figures of “Death in Midsummer”, it is impossible to tell where the record came from. Is “No One’s Sleeping” an outtake of an aborted Kinks recording session in 1977 Berlin with Eno producing? No. That is nostalgia. If there is one thing Deerhunter are making clear it is that they have exhausted themselves with that toxic concept.\n\nThe Delines – The Imperial CD/LP (El Cortez)\n\nSophomore album from the Portland, Oregon-based country soul band.\n\nThe End Of The Ocean – -aire CD/LP (Equal Vision)\n\nNew album from the Columbus, Ohio based post rock band.\n\nFever 333 – STRENTH IN NUMB333RS CD (Roadrunner)\n\nFever 333 is an American rapcore supergroup formed in Inglewood, California in July 2017. The three-piece band consists of former let live vocalist Jason Aalon Butler, former The Chariot guitarist Stephen Harrison and Night Verses drummer Aric Improta. STRENTH IN NUMB333RS is their debut album.\n\nFlanders 72 – This Is A Punk Rock Club CD (Waterslide)\n\nThe Brazilian pop-punks are back with a new full-length album fueled with Ramones bubble gum pop punk.\n\nThe Flesh Eaters – I Used To Be Pretty CD/LP+MP3 (Yep Roc)\n\nOne of Los Angeles punk rock’s most widely admired yet little-heard bands makes a striking return with a new album. On I Used To Be Pretty, Flesh Eaters founding vocalist/songwriter Chris Desjardins is backed by the legendary all-star edition of the band, originally heard on the 1981 set A Minute To Pray, A Second to Die: Dave Alvin (guitar) and Bill Bateman (drums) of the Blasters; John Doe (bass) and D.J. Bonebrake (marimba and percussion) of X; and Steve Berlin (saxophones) of the Plugz (and later the Blasters and Los Lobos).\n\nFlotsam & Jetsam – The End Of Chaos CD/LP (AFM)\n\n12 inimitable, powerful and thrashy new songs from the veteran Arizona hard rock band. [Limited picture disc and limited orange colored vinyl pressings are also available.]\n\nSteve Gunn – The Unseen In Between CD/LP+MP (Matador)\n\nGetting to The Unseen In Between itself was not easy for Steve Gunn. In the summer of 2016, Gunn released Eyes On The Lines, his winning and elliptical debut for Matador. It should have been a triumphant moment, but exactly two weeks later, Gunn’s father and namesake died following a two-year struggle with cancer. This experience yielded the emotional centerpiece of the album. “Stonehurst Cowboy” is a duet for Gunn’s raw acoustic guitar and spare basslines by Bob Dylan’s musical director Tony Garnier, who’s featured throughout the album. The song distills the lessons Gunn learned from his father and it is a solemn but tender remembrance, a tribute to his father’s reputation as a tough, wise, and witty guy from far west Philadelphia.\n\nGuster – Look Alive CD (Nettwerk)\n\nGuster’s first new album in four years opens with a stark, haunting synth refrain and veers in unexpected directions from there. Despite having access to room after room of well-maintained analog keys, producer Leo Abrahams (Regina Spektor, Brian Eno/David Byrne, Belle and Sebastian) gravitated to a cheap Ensoniq Mirage synth from the 1980s.\n\nHama – Houmeissa CD/LP (Sahel Sounds)\n\nNigerian composer Hama presents a groundbreaking album of traditional electronic desert folk songs, hovering somewhere between early ’90s techno and synthwave. Nomadic herding ballads, ancient caravan songs, and ceremonial wedding chants are all re-imagined into pieces seemingly lifted from a Saharan 1980s sci-fi soundtrack or score to a Tuareg video game. With a deep love and respect, Hama effortlessly takes back and re-appropriates fourthworld ethno-ambient music.\n\nHante. – Fierce CD/LP (Metropolis)\n\nHante. is a one-woman project from the Paris-based Hélène de Thoury. While on the surface striking, cold, and synthetic, it becomes immediately evident that this unique blend of darkwave and striking electronics is also revealing, offering deep emotion and intimacy. The beautiful new album, Fierce, showcases an artist of passion and emotional depth using her music to face her fears.\n\nJuliana Hatfield – Weird CD/LP/Cassette (American Laundromat)\n\nFast on the heels of 2018’s acclaimed Juliana Hatfield Sings Olivia Newton-John comes Juliana Hatfield’s self-produced all-originals album, Weird. Freda Love Smith (Blake Babies, Sunshine Boys) and Todd Philips (Lemonheads, The Juliana Hatfield Three) each played drums on multiple songs while Hatfield played all of the other instruments (and some additional drums). Weird is an album about disconnection and discomfort. ”I often feel cut-off from other people, from my feelings, from technology, from popular culture,” says Hatfield.\n\nHold Close – Time CD/LP (Hopeless)\n\nMissouri emo rockers Hold Close release their debut full-length. Building on their success on their previous two EPs (I’ll Never Go Back / I Was Never Meant To Stay), the band use Time to explore topics such as love, loss and, of course, the passing of time.\n\nCody Johnson – Ain’t Nothin’ To It CD/2xLP (Warner Nashville)\n\nNew album from former rodeo bull rider turned prison guard turned budding country star. [Vinyl edition features a pair of live bonus tracks.]\n\nJorma Kaukonen & Jack Casady – Bear’s Sonic Journals: Before We Were Them CD (Owsley Stanley)\n\nRecently discovered and previously unreleased music from Jefferson Airplane’s fabled guitar and bass players before they became known as Hot Tuna.\n\nSourakata Koite – En Hollande CD/LP (Awesome Tapes From Africa)\n\nSourakata Koite is a Paris-dwelling kora-player from Senegal. He is a griot, which means he is a story- and history-teller and singer. He accompanies himself on the kora. The kora (a harp-lute with 21 strings) is the most representative instrument of Manding music and culture.\n\nMark Lockhart – Days On Earth CD (Edition Records Ltd.)\n\nDays On Earth epitomizes the eclectic mix of influences and genres that have shaped Lockheart’s concepts – from the expansive improvising and lush soundscapes of Polar Bear to 70’s funk, African Kora type harp melodies and soaring strings. With a heavyweight band featuring some of the leading figures of British Jazz including Liam Noble, Tom Herbert, Seb Rochford and John Parricelli, and a 30-piece orchestra, Days On Earth combines off-kilter Polar Bear grooves with unique and fascinating orchestral colors, all beautifully performed by a specially assembled crack London orchestra.\n\nLost Under Heaven – Love Hate What You Become CD/LP (Mute)\n\nLove Hates What You Become captures the Manchester-based duo comprised of Ebony Hoorn and Ellery James Roberts at their most musically raw and visceral. The band wrote the album in Ellery’s native Manchester before traveling to Los Angeles to record with producer John Congleton, known for his Grammy-winning work with St. Vincent, Swans, Explosions in the Sky and Sigur Rós.\n\nAlvin Lucier – Ricochet Lady CD (Black Truffle)\n\nThe recently composed Ricochet Lady (2016) is the only work for solo acoustic glockenspiel by the American experimental composer Alvin Lucier. Following in the manner of his pieces I Am Sitting In A Room and Vespers, Ricochet Lady embodies Lucier’s approach toward sound’s individual function and mobility within space. Created in close collaboration with Trevor Saint, a rare (if not the only) specialist of experimental music for glockenspiel, Lucier has further enhanced the sophistication of this re-imagined instrument while maintaining his devotion to letting spaces speak.\n\nMachinefabriek – With Voices CD/LP (Western Vinyl)\n\nWith Voices is the newest recording by Dutch composer Rutger Zuydervelt under the moniker Machinefabriek. True to it’s title, the album’s eight pieces exhibit Zuydervelt’s use of tone generators, radios, synths, and other hi-fi curio to construct bewildering aural architecture around vocal contributions from Marissa Nadler, Peter Broderick, Richard Youngs, and others. [Scarlet red colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nMagnum – Live At The Symphony Hall 2xCD/3xLP+2xCD (Steamhammer)\n\nOn April 19, 2018 inside Birmingham’s Symphony Hall, British rock band Magnum completed their Road To Eternity tour. [Limited colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nMalibu Ken (Aesop Rock and Tobacco) – Malibu Ken CD (Rhymesayers)\n\nAesop Rock has been credited as one of the most verbose MC’s in hip-hop today. Known for his dense and abstract wordplay, he manipulates language to illustrate elaborate stories and difficult concepts with sharp clarity. Tobacco is a member of psych-electronic band Black Moth Super Rainbow. Known for working with pre-digital electronic instruments like analog synths and tape machines, he crafts distorted, experimentalist beats that intertwine feelings of tension and anxiety with sensations of bemusement and pleasure. Together, Aesop Rock and Tobacco are Malibu Ken. [Colored vinyl edition comes in a die cut gatefold jacket with a 2-panel wearable perforated pop out mask with elastic string, and a 4-panel full color insert with full album lyrics.]\n\nSteve Mason – About The Light CD/LP (Domino)\n\nRecorded at studios in London and Brighton, About The Light sees a subtle yet noticeable evolution in Steve Mason’s sound. “When I listen to this album it feels and sounds like the first ‘legitimate’ record that I have ever made. It’s hard to explain but it sounds like a ‘real’ album. I think that is partly the production, the playing and the work that I did with the band for all those months in our rehearsal room on the South Coast,” says Steve. “It’s a beautiful, confident, positive, angry, loving and gentle album which once again moves what I do forward. David Bowie said that you should always be slightly out of your comfort zone if you want to achieve greatness, and for the first time perhaps ever, I deliberately pushed myself into that place. Who doesn’t want greatness?”\n\nJohn Medeski – John Medeski’s Mad Skillet CD/LP (Indirecto)\n\nLed by the hugely influential keyboardist and featuring guitarist Will Bernard and the legendary Dirty Dozen Brass Band rhythm section of sousaphonist Kirk Joseph and drummer Terence Higgins, Mad Skillet is first and foremost a product of New Orleans.\n\nAlice Merton – Mint CD/LP (Mom+Pop)\n\nPlatinum-selling English born, German-based singer-songwriter Alice Merton releases her much-anticipated debut album. Written by Alice and longtime co-writer/producer Nicolas Rebscher the “Why So Serious” single is a song that brings positive light into this sometimes too serious world we live in. Although sticking to Alice’s electric guitar riff-laden sound she’s come to form, this song brings a more pop filled positioning with a well-honed production and strong melody and chorus leading into a well-written bridge. [Limited colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nMister T – Black Drop CD/LP (Cold Busted)\n\nBased out of the funky scene brewing in Athens, Greece, Mister T leads the way with another spell-binding album release. With accolades from the likes of Greg Wilson, Mark Farina (Mushroom Jazz), and Jose Padilla (Café del Mar), Mister T has become a respected name in the global beat-making scene.\n\nTerry Ohms – Terryfirma CD/LP+MP3 (Cornelius Chapel)\n\nOn Terry Ohms’ Terryfirma, you can hear the echoes of artists such as The Rolling Stones\n\nand Gram Parsons but opening track, “Mind Blow”, evokes the bluster of Hüsker Dü and reckless abandon of The Replacements. Other tracks like the danceable “Bring All to Front” and “We Love You” share space with the lounge guitar vibrations of “Those Eyes”, building a wide-ranging selection of liquid melodies and subtle electronic flourishes. [Limited yellow colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nOomph! – Ritual CD/2xLP (Napalm)\n\nGerman trio Oomph! was raised on EBM, rock and new wave, and accidentally started a new subgenre in the ‘90s (the so-called Neue Deutsche Härte that influenced Rammstein and many more) and were crossover when crossover wasn’t even born. Ritual is their 13th album.\n\nOrgōne – Reasons CD/LP (Killion Sound)\n\nOrgōne delivers dirty, organic, California soul with heart; music that grabs you by the collar, pulls you to your feet and shoves you wantingly onto the dance floor.\n\nA Pale Horse Named Death – When The World Becomes Undone CD/2xLP/2xLP+CD (SPV)\n\n“Brooklyn Lords of Doom” A Pale Horse Named Death siphon strangely blissful melodies from apocalyptic heavy metal awash in swells of cavernous gothic keys and grunge songcraft. [Deluxe numbered box set edition features an exclusive colored vinyl version, a copy of the CD, a beanie, a patch, a guitar pick and a sticker.]\n\nPapa Roach – Who Do You Trust CD/LP (Eleven Seven Music)\n\nWho Do You Trust? includes some material that was left on the cutting-room floor during the Crooked Teeth sessions.\n\nPedro The Lion – Phoenix CD/2xLP+MP3 (Polyvinyl)\n\nCapping off a fruitful 12-year long solo career, singer/songwriter David Bazan resurrects and reunites with both the moniker and mindset of his profoundly influential indie rock outfit, Pedro The Lion, with the follow up to their 2004 opus, Achilles Heel. The band’s new album, Phoenix, marks a return to form for the beloved group, while mapping out the emotional intricacies and childhood experiences of growing up in Phoenix, AZ – a process that would ultimately shape Bazan’s adult life. [Limited colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nLee Perry & King Tubby – Cloak & Dagger: Scratch The Upsetter CD/LP (Clocktower)\n\nA new compilation of early Lee Scratch Perry material, including tracks recorded during the early ’70s.\n\nMike Posner – Real Good Kid CD (Island)\n\nGrammy-nominated, worldwide multi-platinum selling singer-songwriter and producer Mike Posner (“I Took A Pill In Ibiza”, “Cooler Than Me”) releases his long-awaited fourth album. [Vinyl edition due March 8.]\n\nRaven – Screaming Murder Death From Above: Live in Aalborg CD/2xLP+CD (Steamhammer)\n\nWhen the British/American metal trio Raven left the Skraen stage at the end of November 2017 after their acclaimed concert in Aalborg, Denmark, brothers John (bass, vocals) and Mark Gallagher (guitar) along with new member Mike Heller (drums) didn’t foresee their show recorded for posterity. [Limited colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nLou Reed – Thinking Of Another Place 3xLP (Bang!)\n\nLou Reed´s first triple-live vinyl LP from 1976’s Rock´n´Roll Heart USA tour. A superb performance recorded for radio broadcast, restored and remastered, Reed plays seven tracks from that album alongside songs from Transformer (1972), Berlin (1973), Sally Can´t Dance (1974), and Coney Island Baby (1975), as well as some excellent Velvet Underground thrown in for good measure.\n\nTrippie Redd – A Love Letter To You 3 CD (TenThousand Projects)\n\nFresh off the release of his video for Topanga and his debut studio album, Life’s A Trip, Multi-platinum rapper and singer Trippie Redd releases a new 16-track album featuring Juice Wrld, Emani 22, NBA YoungBoy, and Nel-Denarro.\n\nLaurie Spiegel – The Expanding Universe [Reissue/1980] 2xCD/3xLP (Unseen Worlds)\n\nLaurie Spiegel – Unseen Worlds [Reissue/1991] CD/2xLP (Unseen Worlds)\n\nExpanded CD and vinyl reissues of the first two albums by the composer and computer music pioneer.\n\nPeter Stampfel – The Ordivician Era! CD (Don Giovanni)\n\nWelcome to The Ordovician Era in which the Peter Stampfel and Atomic Meta-Pagans become even more like themselves. Features the vocal stylings of the Stampfelettes, magical overdubs by Mark Bingham, higher quality improvs by award winning experimental vocalist Shelley Hirsch (Singing, The Big Gundown), Peter Stampfel (Holy Modal Rounders, Fugs), and more.\n\nSubjective – Act 1: Music For Inanimate Objects CD/2xLP (Masterworks)\n\nDJ, producer, visual artist, actor and visionary Goldie joins forces with revered engineer and producer James Davidson under the alias Subjective on their first collaborative project. Act 1: Music For Inanimate Objects features Goldie at his uncompromising, unapologetic best – fusing classical, ambient and electronic elements with the ingenuity that only a trailblazer as himself could do.

Recorded and burned through a thousand galaxies of dust and doubt and endless infinite wonder, transforming both time and space. Forever exiled to the very bottom of the world to reflect on the struggling desperate pile above.

Distilling swaggering rock, soulful blues, R&B (rhythm& blues) grooves, and pop ambition into a bold and brash brew, the quartet—Ty Taylor [vocals], Nalle Colt [guitar], Rick Barrio Dill [bass], and Richard Danielson [drums]—have logged 3,000 shows across 30 countries on tour with divinities such as The Who, The Rolling Stones, AC/DC, Lenny Kravitz, and Bon Jovi, to name a few. Chapter II – EP 1 includes five brand-new studio recordings, plus five acoustic versions of those songs.\n\nWaltaa – Lose Control LP (NBN)\n\nA truly unique hybrid R&B project spiced up with touches of jazz fusion. [CD version due February 1.]\n\nJohnny & Edgar Winter ‎– Together: Johnny & Edgar Winter Live [Reissue/1976] LP (Culture Factory)\n\nLimited green colored vinyl LP pressing of the 1976 album by brothers Johnny Winter (guitar, vocals) and Edgar Winter (saxophone, vocals).\n\nCassettes:\n\nJuliana Hatfield – Weird (American Laundromat)\n\nFast on the heels of 2018’s acclaimed Juliana Hatfield Sings Olivia Newton-John comes Juliana Hatfield’s self-produced all-originals album, Weird. Freda Love Smith (Blake Babies, Sunshine Boys) and Todd Philips (Lemonheads, The Juliana Hatfield Three) each played drums on multiple songs while Hatfield played all of the other instruments (and some additional drums). Weird is an album about disconnection and discomfort. ”I often feel cut-off from other people, from my feelings, from technology, from popular culture,” says Hatfield.\n\nSwamp Thing – Horse Power (Urbnet)\n\nToronto’s three-headed rap monster, Swamp Thing (Timbuktu, Chokeules & Savilion) have delivered a special sonic treat. Horse Power is their seventh full length studio album and anticipated follow up to their 2017 release, The Octagon. Produced by Savilion and Timbuktu, the thirteen track LP showcases the electric chemistry, creativity, and swagger that the three emcees bring to the table, along with some talented features including the all-star turntablist DJ iRATE, Wordburgular, and D-Sisive."
