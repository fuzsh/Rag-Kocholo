        "text": "CLEVELAND - When you think of mainstream music in the 1970s, perhaps nothing comes to mind faster than disco. Love it or hate it (and a lot of people say they hated it), the genre was a juggernaut on the charts.\n\nNot surprisingly, in our ranking of the 253 songs to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the decade, you’ll find names like the Bee Gees, Donna Summer and K.C. and the Sunshine Band repeated over and over again.\n\nBut the 1970s were more than that. It was a time when power-pop and new wave first made commercial splashes. It’s when rock and roll took on stadium status. It was also a decade where you’ll find signature songs from some of the greatest artists of all time.\n\nOur list isn’t based on how long the songs stood at No. 1 (Spoiler: Debbie Boone’s “You Light Up My Life” -- the longest running chart-topper of the decade -- was not our top choice). But rather our own thoughts on the quality of the tunes. And it all starts with a duck!\n\n253. Rick Dees & His Cast of Idiots - “Disco Duck (Part I)”\n\nDate: Oct. 16, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nEvery song on this list has some redeemable quality (we think). But, aside from disco becoming a craze, “Disco Duck (Part I)” is void of anything meaningful. It’s almost too easy to place it dead last on this list. It’s also unavoidable. Some songs are universally considered bad. Then there’s “Disco Duck,” which features vocals from an annoying cartoon character, useless lyrics about a dance few people remember, poor instrumentation and a guy in radio personality Rick Dees singing like he’s narrating a horror film. Props to Dees for capitalizing on the moment and being self-aware (“Cast of Idiots”). But also, shame on him.\n\n252. Paul Anka feat. Odia Coates - “(You’re) Having My Baby”\n\nDate: Aug. 24, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nPaul Anka’s “(You’re) Having My Baby” unintentionally paints him as a megalomaniac. As the lyrics go, “Having my baby/What a lovely way of saying how much you love me. Having my baby/What a lovely way of saying that you’re thinking of me.” As if the sole purpose of a woman being pregnant is to serve as a tribute to the man who impregnated her. The inclusion of Odia Coates during the second half doesn’t help, especially since Anka closes out the final verse thanking her for not having an abortion.\n\n251. Ray Stevens - “The Streak”\n\nDate: May 18, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nRay Stevens’ “The Streak” was a novelty song created to capitalize on the fad of streaking in the 1970s. Knowing that you can probably sense, without even listening, that it’s not good. It can be hard to rate novelty songs because they’re not meant to be taken seriously. But it’s also hard not to turn off “The Streak” during the annoying intro skit. You’re not missing anything.\n\n250. Chuck Berry - “My Ding-A-Ling”\n\nDate: Oct. 21, 1972\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nNormally, it would be sacrilege to speak poorly of any song by an artist as revered as rock and roll pioneer Chuck Berry. But he made it easy with “My Ding-a-Ling.” The song, originally written and recorded by Dave Bartholomew, is about a kid’s toy with bells a grandmother refers to as his “ding-a-ling.” As you might expect, the innuendo is cringe-worthy, even in the hands of a charismatic performer like Berry.\n\n249. Ringo Starr - “You’re Sixteen”\n\nDate: Jan. 26, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nIn his defense, Ringo Starr did not write “You’re Sixteen.” His hit is a cover of a Johnny Burnette song written by the Sherman Brothers. Of course, that doesn’t excuse Starr’s judgment as a 33-year-old man releasing a song about a love for a 16-year-old girl.\n\n248. Starland Vocal Band - “Afternoon Delight”\n\nDate: July 2, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\n1970s babies will line up to tell you how bad “Afternoon Delight” is. For younger generations, it’s been a shining light in a few brilliant comedies. So much so, it’s easy to forget this song was originally meant to be taken seriously. And yet, there’s never been anything less sexy about taking a nooner.\n\n247. Shaun Cassidy - “Da Doo Ron Ron”\n\nDate: July 16, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nA male teen idol covering a classic, girl-group pop song from the 1960s is something no one with any sense of musicality should approve. The Crytal’s “Da Doo Ron Ron” is one of the signature songs to come out of Phil Spector’s 1960s run. Back then, it would be unfathomable to imagine someone messing it up. Then came Shaun Cassidy.\n\n246. Barbra Streisand & Neil Diamond - “You Don’t Bring Me Flowers”\n\nDate: Dec. 2, 1978\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\n“You Don’t Bring Me Flowers” pieces together two different versions of a so-so song. Neil Diamond’s solo version is rather boring, while Barbra Streisand’s take goes overboard with the dramatics. Someone got the bright idea to cut and paste everything together as a duet. It worked in terms of chart success. But Streisand is so overpowering, it blows Diamond out of the water.\n\n245. Donny Osmond - “Go Away Little Girl”\n\nDate: Sept. 11, 1971\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nThe original version of the Gerry Goffin and Carole King penned “Go Away Little Girl” was recorded by an adult Steve Lawrence in 1962. It’s downright creepy. It made more sense in the hands of a 13-year-old Donny Osmond nearly a decade later. But Osmond’s voice is just too soft to pull off the arrangement. Puberty might have helped. Instead, “Go Away Little Girl” sounds like something that might earn you top-10 at a junior high school talent show.\n\n244. The Captain & Tennille - “Love Will Keep Us Together”\n\nDate: June 21, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\nIt isn’t the lyrics on “Love Will Keep Us Together” that annoy you most. It isn’t the uncompromising commitment that makes you cringe. It’s the instrumentation -- more specifically the keyboard arrangement – that makes The Captain & Tenille’s “Love Will Keep Us Together” border on unbearable.\n\n243. The Carpenters - “Please Mr. Postman”\n\nDate: Jan. 25, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nThe Marvelettes’ version of “Please Mr. Postman” has the distinction of being the first No. 1 single in Motown’s history. What The Carpenters did to such a classic in 1975 wasn’t right. The original is a raw doo-wop turned soul tune. The Carpenters drain it of all its charm.\n\n242. Sammy Davis Jr. - “The Candy Man”\n\nDate: June 10, 1972\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nIt’s a shame that “The Candy Man” was Sammy Davis Jr.’s only No. 1 hit. The song is quite terrible, something Davis knew in covering a tune that was originally recorded for “Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.” Davis is one of the most charismatic performers in history. Here, he sounds completely bored.\n\n241. Tony Orlando & Dawn - “Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree”\n\nDate: April 21, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\nThere was a chance for “Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree” to work as a song despite its elementary hook about a ribbon and a tree. But Tony Orlando wasn’t the guy to make it happen. His performance lacks any sense of raw emotion. It doesn’t help that the guitar on the song sounds like it’s about to break into a million pieces.\n\n240. Terry Jacks - “Seasons in the Sun”\n\nDate: March 2, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nIs “Seasons in the Sun” the worst song of all time? You’ll find plenty of people on the Internet willing to say so. Terry Jacks’ hit is not a good song. The melody sucks, the lyrics are worse and the upbeat feel accompanied pushed on you by a narrator who is dying is annoying. It can be hard to listen to “Seasons in the Sun” without the urge to scream “Die already!” which might be a bit evil, even if it’s appropriate.\n\n239. Alan O’Day - “Undercover Angel”\n\nDate: July 9, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Undercover Angel” would be a fine pop song if Alan O’Day didn’t destroy the pre-chorus with terrible lyrics: “I said, ‘What?’ She said, Ooh-ooh-ooh, whee/I said, ‘All right’ She said, ‘Love me, love me, love me.’ Those baffling lyrics maybe could be pulled off by someone with endless amounts of cool. O’Day was not that guy.\n\n238. Tony Orlando & Dawn - “He Don’t Love You (Like I Love You)”\n\nDate: May 3, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nThis feature takes more digs at Tony Orlando & Dawn than any other hitmaking act of the 1970s. It’s easy to justify, however. The group’s “He Don’t Love You (Like I Love You)” sucks all the life out of Jerry Butler’s original. It’s proof that just because you’re a fan of 1960s R&B doesn’t mean you record your version of it.\n\n237. Olivia Newton-John - “Have You Never Been Mellow”\n\nDate: March 8, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nSongs, let alone No. 1 hits, from the 1970s don’t get much more boring than “Have You Never Been Mellow.” Sure, there’s something blissful about Olivia Newton-John’s voice (It was her second consecutive No. 1 hit). But musically, “Have You Never Been Mellow” lacks anything that truly hooks you. It highlights everything mundane about adult contemporary music.\n\n236. Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods - “Billy, Don’t Be a Hero”\n\nDate: June 15, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\n“Billy Don’t Be a Hero” was a song about a woman asking a guy not to go away to war, which made it resonate, in terms of theme, as the Vietnam War still going on. And yet, it feels like a tone-deaf anthem. The interesting part is that “Billy, Don’t Be a Hero” isn’t actually about the Vietnam War. It’s actually about the Civil War. Regardless, it’s a story that just wasn’t all that engaging to begin with.\n\n235. Maureen McGovern - “The Morning After”\n\nDate: Aug. 4, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nMaureen McGovern’s “The Morning After” doesn’t waste any time packing on the drama with its overpowering strings. The song was written for the 1972 disaster film “The Poseidon Adventure.” So, it’s essentially the 1970s version of “I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing,” only far more literal and self-aggrandizing, if that’s possible.\n\n234. Leo Sayer - “You Make Me Feel Like Dancing”\n\nDate: Jan. 15, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nThe most disappointing thing about “You Make Me Feel Like Dancing” is that it doesn’t make anyone feel like dancing. Leo Sayer’s hit is a well-produced disco song, which was enough to earn a one-week hit in 1977. But Sayer’s annoying falsetto kills any momentum the song builds up.\n\n233. Ray Stevens - “Everything Is Beautiful”\n\nDate: May 30, 1970\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nAs this list shows, a lot of early 1970s soft rock songs haven’t aged well. Ray Stevens’ “Everything Is Beautiful” feels like a positive statement that’s hard to knock. But then he pushes its tolerability to the limit by not saying anything profound for three and a half minutes and then pumping in a children’s choir on the chorus in a blatant attempt to make the point everything is indeed beautiful in its own way. Though, people suffering through the Vietnam War and Civil Rights Movement might have begged to differ.\n\n232. C.W. McCall - “Convoy”\n\nDate: Jan. 10, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nKnowing C.W. McCall’s trucker-song schtick, “Convoy” isn’t all that annoying in theory. But the chorus is a problem. Why does a song narrated by a tough trucker switch over to the sound of a bunch of Christmas carolers at your door? It’s too jarring to enjoy.\n\n231. Cher - “Half-Breed”\n\nDate: Oct. 6, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nThe idea of crafting a song exploring being bi-racial was very admirable, especially in 1973. But Cher overdoes. The authenticity of “Half Breed” is unfortunately underscored by Native American chants and Cher’s over-singing. Cher continued to squander whatever goodwill the song had when she performed it on “The Sonny & Cher Show” in a headdress and sexy outfit.\n\n230. Mac Davis - “Baby Don’t Get Hooked on Me”\n\nDate: Sept. 23, 1972\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nSongs about sex were hit but mostly miss in the 1970s. Mac Davis’ country-pop “Baby Don’t Get Hooked on Me” finds him telling a girl to keep things casual because he doesn’t want to leave her for being too clingy. He must have thought it was touching when it really makes you seem like a jerk.\n\n229. Bread - “Make It with You”\n\nDate: Aug. 22, 1970\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Make It with You” isn’t so much a song as it is a corny pick-up line. Could a guy singing so softly before telling a woman “I like to make it with you” be any less desirable?\n\n228. Exile - “Kiss You All Over”\n\nDate: Sept. 30, 1978\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\nIf you wanted a hit in the 1970s, releasing a catchy disco or soft rock song was a safe bet. Exile merged the two genres on “Kiss You All Over.” If the title alone makes you cringe, wait until the song starts. Slowed down and in the hands of someone like Teddy Pendergrass, “Kiss You All Over” might have worked. But Exile’s Jimmy Stokley and J.P. Pennington don’t have the sexiness in their voices to pull it off.\n\n227. David Soul - “Don’t Give Up on Us”\n\nDate: April 16, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nIt’s weird how soft rock and disco coexisted on the charts in the 1970s. David Soul’s “Don’t Give Up on Us” followed “Dancing Queen’s” reign atop the Billboard Hot 100. The two songs couldn’t be more different. Not just because one “Dancing Queen” is great and the “Don’t Give Up on Us” is utterly boring. Don’t Give Up on Us” is a song about saving a relationship. But it’s so bad it makes it clear why she wants to leave him in the first place.\n\n226. Tony Orlando and Dawn - “Knock Three Times”\n\nDate: Jan. 23, 1971\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\n“Knock Three Times” was songwriters L. Russell Brown and Irwin Levine’s attempt to capture the magic of the Drifters’ classic “Up on the Roof.” But the Drifters (or few other acts) ever dabbled in something this corny. The sound of actual knocking on the chorus is so obvious a 5-year-old could probably come up with it.\n\n225. John Denver - “I’m Sorry”\n\nDate: Sept. 27, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“I’m Sorry” is an overly melancholy tune about a guy feeling sorry for himself after a breakup. John Denver became a true star during the 1970s with a string of No. 1 hits. But “I’m Sorry” marked the end. The song was the last time Denver would have a significant hit.\n\n224 Elton John - “Island Girl”\n\nDate: Nov. 1, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nIt’s important to note just how powerful Elton John was in the 1970s. “Island Girl” replaced Neil Sedaka’s “Bad Blood,” a song released on John’s record label and featuring his backing vocals, atop the charts. Together, the songs ruled the chart for six weeks. What’s more impressive is that neither song is all that impressive. “Island Girl,” despite all of John’s panache as a performer, is less interesting than most of his album cuts from the era. It’s one of the most forgettable singles he ever released.\n\n223. Barry Manilow - “Mandy”\n\nDate: Jan. 18, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Mandy” starts slow and builds into something grander and relentless with its orchestral strings. What kills it is that Barry Manilow sings the song void of emotion. Everyone involved with “Mandy” clearly knew how to craft a hit. “Mandy” has become Barry Manilow’s signature song but it might as well be sung by anyone.\n\n222. Eric Clapton - “I Shot the Sheriff”\n\nDate: Sept. 14, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nIt’s hard to examine some of Eric Clapton’s work given some of the things he’s said over the years that have entered the modern spotlight, including racist remarks in 1976. It gets even stranger when listening to “I Shot the Sheriff,” Clapton’s cover of Bob Marley’s classic about good versus evil. From a pure musical, Clapton’s version is quite inferior. “I Shot the Sheriff” is one of Bob Marley’s most popular songs, not just because of its bold message and mainstream leanings, but because Marley’s voice is sublime. Clapton didn’t have the same gift. His version relies more on its instrumentation and great guitar playing. Yet, without Marley’s conviction, this is just annoyingly soft rock.\n\n221. Rupert Holmes - “Escape (The Pina Colada Song)”\n\nDate: Dec. 22, 1979\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nThe final No. 1 song of the 1980s also stretched its run into the 1980s. You’ll find numerous blogs online that rank Rupert Holmes’ “Escape (The Pina Colada Song)” as one of the worst songs of all time. But the song’s chorus has held up to make it an essential part of 1970s mixtapes. Still, when you sit down and listen to it, “Escape’s” lyrics are pretty awful. The melody is there. Holmes just forgot to fill in the rest.\n\n220. Barbra Streisand - “Evergreen (Love Theme From ‘A Star Is Born)”\n\nDate: March 5, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\n“A Star Is Born” is a depressing love story. Compelling, but absolutely gun-wrenching. Though it’s not as difficult as listening to “Evergreen,” the theme from the 1976 film. As she’s known to do, Barbra Streisand milks every note of “Evergreen” for all its worth. And while the opening feels like one heck of a declaration of love, the song tires out long before its conclusion.\n\n219. Mary MacGregor - “Torn Between Two Lovers”\n\nDate: Feb. 5, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nAs the 1970s continued, soft rock reached its golden age. If you had a well-written, well-produced tune that fit in the genre, it was going to demand airplay. Mary MacGregor’s “Torn Between Two Lovers” certainly fit the bill. The song was written by Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul & Mary and Phillip Jarrell, and recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio. The formula for greatness was there. But MacGregor’s vocal never rises to the occasion. She comes across as a Karen Carpenter copy without the pleasant charm to lure you in.\n\n218. Peaches & Herb - “Reunited”\n\nDate: May 5, 1979\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\nPeaches & Herb’s “Reunited” sets up nicely. The arrangement and vocals (even Herb Fame’s soft voice) are blissful. You want the song to explode on the chorus but instead, it dissolves into something far less interesting. The goal here was clearly R&B topped with soft rock. But it could have used some funk.\n\n217. Rod Stewart - “Tonight’s the Night (Gonna Be Alright)”\n\nDate: Nov. 13, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 8\n\nRod Stewart’s “Tonight’s the Night (Gonna Be Alright)” spent two months at No. 1 in the winter of 1976. Two months!? Aside from the lyrics about sex, which are fairly cringeworthy, “Tonight’s the Night” isn’t a bad song. But it’s also not great in any way whatsoever. But People latched on to Rod Steward doing sexually suggestive soft rock in 1976 for whatever reason.\n\n216. Frankie Valli - “My Eyes Adored You”\n\nDate: March 22, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“My Eyes Adored You” could give “Every Breath You Take” a run for its money in terms of stalker anthems. Granted, Frankie Valli’s hit sounds less creepy (what doesn’t?). But dramatic strings can’t disguise the fact that the song’s narrator has it bad for a woman who never seemed to give him the time of day. An entire verse about carrying her books home? Let it go, dude.\n\n215. Minnie Riperton - “Lovin’ You”\n\nDate: April 5, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nMinnie Riperton’s had one of the most sensual voices of all time. When paired with the right song (See: “Inside My Love” or “Here We Go”) it became quality baby-making music. But “Lovin’ You” wasn’t it, despite coming from an all-star team of co-writer Robert Rudolph and co-producer Stevie Wonder. Riperton sounds more like Olivia Newton-John with a high-pitched note at the track’s center that’s so annoying, it will make you rip your headphones off.\n\n214. Andy Kim - “Rock Me Gently”\n\nDate: Sept. 28, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nThe main problem with “Rock Me Gently,” other than it’s boring, is the premise. “Rock me gently. Rock me slowly.” Who would anyone use that as a pickup line? Ultimately, Andy Kim’s attempt at being suave morphs into something desperate and corny.\n\n213. John Denver - “Annie’s Song”\n\nDate: July 27, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nFor many, John Denver’s “Annie’s Song” is a timeless love classic. But it can also be sort of annoying. The way Denver holds each note is off-putting. It doesn’t help that the song has been used in a variety of ad campaigns, including one for Earth Day, which only makes it seem even more mundane.\n\n212. Vicki Lawrence - “The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia”\n\nDate: April 7, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\n“The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia” certainly sets a mood. The storytelling verses are fairly compelling, drawing you in only to disappoint you with a weak chorus. But Vicki Lawrence will, at the very least, always have a song title that makes you search for a backstory on Google.\n\n211. Debby Boone - “You Light Up My Life”\n\nDate: Oct. 15, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 10\n\nDebby Boone’s “You Light Up My Life” wasn’t just the longest-running No. 1 hit of the 1970s. It was the longest-running song in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 up until that point (besting Elvis’ double A-side “Don’t Be Cruel/Hound Dog”). But why? “You Light Up My Life” isn’t some stunning ballad. It certainly would have been better in the hands of a singer with a bigger voice. But there’s something about the way Boone sings the song that makes you believe every second of it. Go figure.\n\n210. B.J. Thomas - “Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head”\n\nDate: Jan. 3, 1970\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\n“Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head” will forever be one of those songs people just know. Writers Burt Bacharach and Hal David deserve all the credit in the world for that. But it doesn’t take away from the hokey arrangement that bogs down the original version. It’s a bit odd to think the song was associated with such a cool film as “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.”\n\n209. Cher - “Dark Lady”\n\nDate: March 23, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nBelieve it or not, Cher was one of the most successful storytellers of the 1970s. She went to No. 1 three times with songs that told epic tales. First, with “Gypsys, Tramps and Thieves,” then with “Half-Breed” and finally with “Dark Lady.” There isn’t much that differentiates those songs. They each come with dramatic backing music and Cher singing as if she’s trying to hit the ears of the person in the back row at a large theater. Like the previous two hits, “Dark Lady’s” tale gets old fairly quickly.\n\n208. Meco - “Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band”\n\nDate: Oct. 1, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nIt’s a simple enough idea – Combine two of pop culture’s biggest phenoms in soar up the charts. Meco’s “Star Wars” and disco mashup was a hit. But it will never overcome the fact takes John Williams’ iconic them and turns them into a cheap parlor trick.\n\n207. Styx - “Babe”\n\nDate: Dec. 8, 1979\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nIf you find Styx annoying, “Babe” isn’t going to win you over. Even for fans of the band, it has to feel like a bit of a letdown. The band’s brand of arena rock (well, soft arena rock) hinged on Styx going for broke. But “Babe” doesn’t reach for the stratosphere the way the band’s other hits do. Give me “Come Sail Away” all day.\n\n206. Robert John - “Sad Eyes”\n\nDate: Oct. 6, 1979\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nIf you look at the other No. 1 hits of 1979, Robert John’s “Sad Eyes” is kind of a buzzkill (it followed “My Sharona” on the charts and came just before “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough”). John develops a cute melody for the song and the chorus is catchy. But there’s something about listening to a guy whine about dumping someone that makes you want to slap him in the face.\n\n205. Amii Stewart - “Knock on Wood”\n\nDate: April 21, 1979\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nYou’ll remember “Knock on Wood” as an Eddie Floyd classic from the 1960s Stax Records era loaded with copious amounts of soul. Ammi Stewart’s version is an empty disco makeover. Fortunately, the song’s structure is so good it was impossible to turn it into a complete disaster.\n\n204. Grand Funk Railroad - “The Loco-Motion”\n\nDate: May 4, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nFans were very familiar with the original version of “The Loco-Motion,” a 1962 pop song written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King that went to No. 1 for Little Eva. Grand Funk’s version is supercharged when it didn’t have to be. The band takes it from an alluring tune to an annoying fist-pumper.\n\n203. Elton John - “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds”\n\nDate: Jan. 4, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nGenerally, you have to be over the moon in love with a Beatles song to cover it. It’s the only way to explain mustering up enough courage to go for it. Elton John gives it his all on “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.” But the length of his cover is the biggest problem. John nearly doubles the length of The Beatles classic without improving on it in any way.\n\n202. Wings - “With a Little Luck”\n\nDate: May 20, 1978\n\nMost of the group’s biggest songs lived or died on Paul McCartney’s hackneyed nature. The latter is the case for “With a Little Luck,” a lame soft rock song that can’t muster anything interesting no matter how many synths are poured in.\n\n201. Chicago - “If You Leave Me Now”\n\nDate: Oct. 23, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nIt is wild to think that Chicago went from an amazing jazz-rock band to a vehicle for Peter Cetera’s brand of soft rock. Not everything under Cetera’s leadership was bad. Hits like “You’re the Inspiration” and “Hard to Say I’m Sorry” have a cheesy sappiness that’s almost likable. But “If You Leave Me Now” is too depressing, even for a soft rock song. If it’s possible to be too soft when it comes to soft rock, Chicago achieves it.\n\n200. Neil Sedaka - “Laughter in the Rain”\n\nDate: Feb. 1, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nIt’s hard to knock the melody of “Laughter in the Rain.” Neil Sedaka hits on something, primarily in the song’s chorus. But the way Sedaka sings “Laughter in the Rain” leaves it void of emotion or any sensation whatsoever.\n\n199. Bee Gees - “Tragedy”\n\nDate: March 24, 1979\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nYou have to applaud the Bee Gees for trying new aspects of dance music in the late 1970s. Still, it’s hard to know what “Tragedy” is supposed to be. It sounds like ABBA on steroids...not in a good way. Even if you find the song sonically interesting, the high-pitched vocals create piercing that’s overpowering.\n\n198. America - “Sister Golden Hair”\n\nDate: June 14, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nProduced by George Martin, there’s a certain level of sheen to “Sister Golden Hair.” But the song sounds forced. America attempted to write a Jackson Browne tune. But Browne had better instincts than to write a story that, without an actual Sister Golden Hair, feels anti-climactic.\n\n197. The Honey Cone - “Want Ads”\n\nDate: June 12, 1971\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nMelody-wise, “Want Ads” feels like a winner. It wouldn’t be hard to imagine the song (with better production) coming out of Motown during the 1960s. But lyrically, it’s a dud. It’s also dated. A time will come, if it hasn’t already, where generations will hear this song and wonder, “What is a want ad?”\n\n196. Neil Diamond - “Song Sung Blue”\n\nDate: July 1, 1972\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Song Sung Blue,” which is based on the second movement of Mozart’s Piano Concerto #21, is a great arrangement that goes nowhere. Neil Diamond doesn’t exactly do his best work in terms of songwriting. There’s nothing beneath the surface of “Song Sung Blue” other than it’s a somewhat uplifting song about sad songs.\n\n195. Cher - “Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves”\n\nDate: Nov. 6, 1971\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nThe entire point of “Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves” was to redefine Cher. She was best known for the cookie-cutter music she made with Sony Bono. “Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves,” a dark tale about a girl who was “born in the wagon of a traveling show” did the trick, racing to No. 1 and presenting Cher to a more mature audience. But the song itself could have been stronger. A lot is going on musically (the Wrecking Crew plays the backing music) when you just want to hear Cher’s urgent voice as the focus.\n\n194. Three Dog Night - “Black & White”\n\nDate: Sept. 16, 1972\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Black & White” was first recorded by Pete Seeger with lyrics focused on the Supreme Court’s landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision. Not only does Three Dog Night’s version (based on a cover by British reggae band Greyhound) remove those lyrics, it turns “Black & White” into a big pop song. It’s catchy because everything Three Dog Night did in the early 1970s was. But the song’s take on racial harmony doesn’t feel as impassioned as Seeger may have intended.\n\n193. Paul McCartney & Wings - “My Love”\n\nDate: June 2, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\n“My Love” starts okay. But Paul McCartney tries to take his voice places it’s just not supposed to go. The result is an awkward ballad whose chorus lulls you to sleep before its highlight, which is Henry McCullough’s standout guitar solo.\n\n192. Billy Swan - “I Can Help”\n\nDate: Nov. 23, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nBilly Swan’s “I Can Help” is a throwback to the glory days of country and rockabilly in sound, but not quality. Swan’s voice squanders any goodwill the song kicks off with. “I Can Help” wants to be a classic Elvis hit. But Swan can’t come close.\n\n191. John Denver - “Thank God I’m a Country Boy”\n\nDate: June 7, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nIt makes sense the live version of John Denver’s “Thank God I’m a Country Boy” went to No. 1. The studio version isn’t much to write home about. But a live setting injects some fun energy. Denver did not write “Thank God I’m a Country Boy” (that honor goes to backing band member John Martin Sommers). So, if you hate it (which you might), Denver gets a slight pass.\n\n190. Elton John & Kiki Dee - “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart”\n\nDate: Aug. 7, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\nKiki Dee might seem like the weak link on “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart.” And certainly, a stronger female voice would have made the song work better. But it’s Elton John’s fault. He recorded the song by himself at first, providing a reference track for Dee. She never brought her own take to it and thus we’re left with a decent-sounding duet void of any real chemistry.\n\n189. Jim Croce - “Bad, Bad Leroy Brown”\n\nDate: July 21, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nOn paper, “Bad, Bad Leroy Brown” should rank with the other bad novelty storytelling songs of the 1970s (Sigh, “Convoy”). But Jim Croce is no ordinary storyteller. “Bad, Bad Leroy Brown” isn’t the most complex story you’ll hear. But Croce sells the heck out of it on a song that could otherwise be considered disjointed.\n\n188. The Rolling Stones - “Angie”\n\nDate: Oct. 20, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Angie” (or as anyone who listens to it for the first time might think, “Angel”) is not The Rolling Stones’ finest moment. Romance was never Mick Jagger’s lyrical strong suit and his voice certainly doesn’t help. The song’s appeal coasts on its melody. But only so much can be forgiven once the sound of Jagger whispering sweet nothings comes into play.\n\n187. Carpenters - “Top of The World”\n\nDate: Dec. 1, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\n“Top of the World” is a by-the-numbers country-pop song for better and worse. You’ll hear this again lower on this list): Karen Carpenter has a way of saving a song. Her voice is majestic and emotionally rich. Even when you want to roll your eyes (and you’ll want to multiple times during the chorus of “Top of the World”), you’re able to hold on to Carpenter’s vocal gift.\n\n186. Wings - “Silly Love Songs”\n\nDate: May 22, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\nThere’s at least one genius part to most Paul McCartney songs. That moment comes early in Wings’ “Silly Love Songs.” The intro sounds like it could be the central part of a modern indie-rock song. During the first verse, you get the sense McCartney is going into full satire mode in a critique of love songs. But, ultimately “Silly Love Songs” becomes just another lame, silly love song about silly love songs. It’s not great. It’s not terrible. It just...is.\n\n185. Anne Murray - “You Needed Me”\n\nDate: Nov. 4, 1978\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nFor younger music fans obsessed with the hottest songs on Spotify, it can be hard to understand why a song like “You Needed Me” caught on. Its slow pace can be unbearable at times. But singers like Anne Murray knew how to make you believe in such a song’s heartfelt sentiment. That was enough in the soft rock glory days of 1978.\n\n184. Neil Sedaka - “Bad Blood”\n\nDate: Oct. 1, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nIf you’d never heard “Bad Blood” before, you’d likely mistake it for an Elton John song (it was released on John’s record label). Neil Sedaka lacks John’s vocal dynamics. But John does sing backup on a song that’s essentially imitating him, giving it the star power it needed to go to No. 1.\n\n183. Johnny Mathis & Deniece Williams - “Too Much, Too Little, Too Late”\n\nDate: June 3, 1978\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Too Much, Too Little, Too Late” was a comeback for the great Johnny Mathis. It had been nearly a decade and a half since his last significant hit. The combination of Mathis & Deniece Williams’ voices is nice. You just kind of wish there was a slightly more interesting song for them to sing. “Too Much, Too Little, Too Late” comes with weak instrumentation that only works because Mathis and Williams elevate it with their vocals.\n\n182. Silver Convention - “Fly, Robin, Fly”\n\nDate: Nov. 29, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nArmed with a cool bassline, “Fly, Robin, Fly” ruled the charts for three weeks in 1975. The first half of the song is relatively boring but gets saved by a middle part you can’t get enough of. Unfortunately, that portion doesn’t last long (Though, it does come back at the end).\n\n181. Wings - “Listen to What the Man Said”\n\nDate: July 19, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nAfter finishing the first version of Wings’ “Listen to What the Man Said,” Paul McCartney felt it was missing something. He called in saxophonist Tom Scott to improvise throughout the song. Scott’s performance became the most interesting part of a song that, otherwise, finds McCartney finding a radio-friendly melody and throwing together some lyrics around it.\n\n180. Barry Manilow - “I Write the Songs”\n\nDate: Jan. 17, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nBarry Manilow was right to feel hesitant about recording “I Write the Songs.” The song, written by The Beach Boys’ Bruce Johnston, screams narcissism. But Johnston has said the “I” in the title stands for God (There were rumors it was about Brian Wilson, which makes more sense). Manilow gives the song his all and is aided by a “worldwide symphony” that comes in during the final third. It’s a bit of a mess, but Manilow’s passion never waivers. t’s a\n\n179. Marilyn McCoo & Billy Davis Jr. - “You Don’t Have to Be a Star (To Be In My Show)”\n\nDate: Jan. 8, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nMarilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr. weren’t new to the hitmaking game. They were former members of The 5th Dimension, a group that released 20 Top-40 hits. The husband and wife duo’s “You Don’t Have to Be a Star” isn’t too far off the sound that put The 5th Dimension on the map, taking the group’s eclectic sound and morphing it into a breezy, if unexceptional disco tune.\n\n178. Melanie - “Brand New Key”\n\nDate: Dec. 25, 1971\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\n“Brand New Key” (better known as “The Rollerskate Song”) is an easy-going song that oddly sounds quite modern. Much of that has to do with how Melanie Safka’s voice that sounds like several 20th-century indie singers. There’s also the sexual innuendo in the song’s lyrics, which was magnified in “Boogie Nights” when Dirk Diggler first hooks up with Rollergirl as the song plays in the background.\n\n177. John Travolta & Olivia Newton-John - “You’re the One That I Want”\n\nDate: June 10, 1978\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nThe film version of “Grease” and its soundtrack were absolute blockbusters. So, it’s not surprising the song from the movie’s fun conclusion went to No. 1. It’s hard to separate John Travolta & Olivia Newton-John’s duet from the movie it’s in. And a standalone piece of music, “You’re the One That I Want” is pretty corny. But for fans of the film, it’s electrifying.\n\n176. Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds - “Fallin’ In Love”\n\nDate: Aug. 23, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nThe best part of Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds’ “Fallin’ in Love” is its intro. Something hip hop producer Boi-1da recognized when he sampled it for the intro of megastar Drake’s 2010 breakthrough hit “Best I Ever Had.” Whereas Drake would capitalize on that with a sensational hook, Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds’ “Fallin’ in Love” fails to go anywhere special.\n\n175. The Carpenters - “(They Long to Be) Close to You”\n\nDate: July 25, 1970\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\n“(They Long to Be) Close to You” has too much going on for its own good. It comes with too much instrumentation and backing vocals for an easy listening song. But what made The Carpenters’ version so enticing (and became its saving grace) was Karen Carpenter’s voice. She had a way of making you fall in love with her, even if the material was beneath her.\n\n174. Three Dog Night - “Joy to the World”\n\nDate: April 17, 1971\n\nWeeks on top: 6\n\nThree Dog Night has openly admitted, “Joy to the World” is a silly song. But that didn’t stop the band from dressing it up as something inviting. Opening lyrics don’t get much more iconic than “Jeremiah was a bullfrog...” even if it’s all downhill from there.\n\n173. Eagles - “Heartache Tonight”\n\nDate: Nov. 10, 1979\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Heartache Tonight” feels like the moment the Eagles jumped the shark. The band would have two more top-10 hits from 1979′s “The Long Run.” But “Heartache Tonight” lacked the magic the songs from “Hotel California” had. It’s beefed up glam-rock that sounds cheap and underwhelming.\n\n172. Bee Gees - “How Can You Mend a Broken Heart”\n\nDate: Aug. 7, 1971\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\n“How Can You Mend a Broken Heart” can be polarizing. It is beautifully written. The way Barry and Robin Gibb sing it certainly makes you feel like you’re hearing the words of a broken man. But their vocals also feel like the inspiration for a very funny “Saturday Night Live” sketch. Al Green would cover the song on his “Let’s Stay Together” album, turning it into an emotional powerhouse that makes the Bee Gees’ version pale in comparison.\n\n171. America - “A Horse with No Name”\n\nDate: March 25, 1972\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\n“A Horse with No Name” hit No. 1 after Neil Young’s “Heart of Gold” occupied that spot. And, if you polled people, the overwhelming majority of them would think America’s hit was recorded by Young. “A Horse with No Name” has the simple country-meets-folk rock vibe Young was mastering at the time. But lyrically, America’s hit doesn’t stack up with anything Young was doing. The story on “a Horse with No Name” can be a bit of a bore.\n\n170. Gilbert O’Sullivan - “Alone Again (Naturally)”\n\nDate: July 29, 1972\n\nWeeks on top: 6\n\nThe narrator in Irish singer-songwriter Gilbert O’Sullivan’s “Alone Again (Naturally)” is having a rough time. In the first verse, he considers committing suicide after being left at the altar. Then his parents die, leaving him to wonder if there’s a God. It’s a real downer. But there’s a wink at self-deprecation with the phrase “naturally” that makes everything tolerable.\n\n169. Neil Diamond - “Cracklin’ Rosie”\n\nDate: Oct. 10, 1970\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nThere’s a moment on “Cracklin’ Rosie” where you think Diamond is about to break into “Sweet Caroline.” It never reaches those heights, despite a catchy melody and Diamond coming off as a likable guy you’d want to have a drink with.\n\n168. Partridge Family starring Shirley Jones & feat. David Cassidy - “I Think I Love You”\n\nDate: Nov. 21, 1970\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\n“I Think I Love You” is a song from a TV show about a fictional family band that featured a real star in David Cassidy. Only two of the actors from the show – Cassidy and Shirley Jones – actually sing on the “I Think I Love You.” The track sounds good with the legendary Wrecking Crew playing on it. Cassidy’s charisma carries it the rest of the way.\n\n167. The Osmonds - “One Bad Apple”\n\nDate: Feb. 13, 1971\n\nWeeks on top: 5\n\nTo say The Osmonds were the white version of The Jackson 5 might be dismissive. But it’s hard to listen to a song like “One Bad Apple” and not think it’s a copycat performance (The song was supposedly offered to The Jackson 5 first, but they chose “ABC” instead). “One Bad Apple” is a good pop song. But, unlike The Jackson 5, The Osmonds didn’t realize yet that their youngest member was the real star. Donny Osmond steals the show on the hook. It’s just too bad they didn’t give him the reigns on the so-so verses.\n\n166. Looking Glass - “Brandy (You’re A Fine Girl)”\n\nDate: Aug. 26, 1972\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl”) tells the story of a bartender in a small town where sailors continuously lust after her. But Brandy is longing for the one guy who came one day and left the next. It’s not much of a love story. But Looking Glass still goes for broke on the chorus. Give these guys a chance, Brandy.\n\n165. John Lennon - “Whatever Gets You Thru the Night”\n\nDate: Nov. 16, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nElton John (who sings backing vocals and plays piano on the song) bet John Lennon “Whatever Gets You Thru the Night” would hit No. 1. John had an advantage in knowing that “Whatever Gets You Thru the Night” was the kind of playful pop song his fans had been eating up in the 1970s. Lennon lost the bet and had to appear at one of John’s live shows. “Whatever Gets You Thru the Night” isn’t among the best songs of Lennon’s solo career. But it’s a rare treat to have two of the best artists of all time on a major pop hit.\n\n164. Carl Douglas - “Kung Fu Fighting”\n\nDate: Dec. 7, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nAs a disco song about a Chinatown rumble, Carl Douglas’ “Kung Fu Fighting” is rather crazy even for a novelty song. But it’s also extremely catchy thanks to Douglas’ infectious jubilation. “Kung Fu Fighting” would go on to sell 11 million copies, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time.\n\n163. Billy Preston - “Nothing From Nothing”\n\nDate: Oct. 19, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Nothing From Nothing’s” appeal is the same as Billy Preston’s previous No. 1 hit “Will It Go Round in Circles.” Its melody is delightful with lyrics that don’t move out of hazy territory. Preston works a small miracle in taking a song that sounds like it belongs in a Western saloon and making it a modern pop hit.\n\n162. Al Wilson - “Show and Tell”\n\nDate: Jan. 19, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nJohnny Mathis’ original version of “Show and Tell” is a stellar Easy Listening tune that could make you swoon. Al Wilson’s cover tries its best to ooze with sensual soul. But it’s simply hard to beat Mathis’ original even though Wilson gives it as much as he can on the powerful chorus.\n\n161. Paper Lace - “The Night Chicago Died”\n\nDate: Aug. 17, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nYou have to admire British band Paper Lace’s commitment. “The Night Chicago Died” tells the tale of a fictional shootout between Al Capone’s crew and Chicago police. Singer/drummer Phil Wright delivers it like it’s the greatest story ever told. It can border on comical during verses that want to be more compelling than they are. But the song delivers the goods with a hook you can’t get out of your head.\n\n160. Diana Ross - “Touch Me in the Morning”\n\nDate: Aug. 18, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Touch Me in the Morning” is structurally a letdown. You keep waiting for it to go somewhere interesting but it never obliges. But Diano Ross works wonders with it vocally. She even incorporates her signature spoken word charm, which seems all the brighter following her turn as an acting star in “Lady Sings the Blues.”\n\n159. Helen Reddy - “I Am Woman”\n\nDate: Dec. 9, 1972\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“I Am Woman” doesn’t necessarily sound like a scathing anthem of female empowerment by today’s standards. But Helen Reddy was ahead of her time. She was writing a song that was in full step with the feminist movement, which was a bold move career-wise, and still rode it to No. 1. That’s an impressive feat in any decade.\n\n158. Elton John - “Crocodile Rock”\n\nDate: Feb. 3, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nThere is a certain joy to Elton John’s first No. 1 hit that’s hard to deny. But “Crocodile Rock” also sounds weird. You’re not exactly dying to hear it again like, say “Tiny Dancer,” “Rocket Man” or “Bennie and the Jets” (which is coming up in a bit).\n\n157. Barbra Streisand - “The Way We Were”\n\nDate: Feb. 2, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nEveryone involved with “The Way We Were” knew their role. Songwriters written by Alan Bergman, Marilyn Bergman and Marvin Hamlisch had to tell the story of a relationship gone bad, while producer Marty Paich had to pile on the melancholy. All Barbra Streisand had to do was sell it and, boy, does she sell it. It’s easy to see why it was a monster record, even if it’s not the most well-executed song as Streisand’s timing is a bit off. Get your tissues ready.\n\n156. Olivia Newton-John - “I Honestly Love You”\n\nDate: Oct. 5, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nJeff Barry, co-writer of “I Honestly Love You,” penned some of the best songs of the 1960s, including The Ronettes’ “Be My Baby.” He brought that same simple pop-sensibility to Olivia Newton-John’s 1974 hit. Newton-John delivers a great vocal on a song that’s otherwise mundane with its string and piano arrangements.\n\n155. Barry Manilow - “Looks Like We Made It”\n\nDate: July 23, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Looks Like We Made It” doesn’t sound all that much like a Barry Manilow song. The song, composed by Richard Kerr with lyrics by Will Jennings, finds Manilow tuning down his voice a bit to make room for some strong instrumentation and backing choir.\n\n154. Glen Campbell - “Southern Nights”\n\nDate: April 30, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nGlen Campbell picked a great song to cover. Allen Toussaint’s original “Southern Nights” is a majestic nostalgia trip to his childhood days visiting New Orleans. Campbell’s version of “Southern Nights” morphs into a feel-good country song that found a home on soft rock radio. It’s likable (especially its guitar line). But do yourself a favor and listen to the original.\n\n153. Bee Gees - “Too Much Heaven”\n\nDate: Jan. 6, 1979\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nAfter ruling pop music with the “Saturday Night Fever” soundtrack, the Bee Gees dipped back into R&B with “Too Much Heaven.” The song follows the same formula as “How Deep Is Your Love” with a catchy intro and soft vocals intended to make you feel all the feels. In the end, it’s another one of those well-written Bee Gees ballads that go on a little too long.\n\n152. John Denver - “Sunshine on My Shoulders”\n\nDate: March 30, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nMost of John Denver’s music is pretty straightforward. He wrote “Sunshine on My Shoulders” while missing the sun during a Minnesota winter. The key to its appeal (and the appeal of Denver’s music as a whole) is that you can feel that sentiment in his performance. It can be easy to dismiss such optimism. But Denver’s words come across as heartfelt.\n\n151. Roberta Flack - “Feel Like Makin’ Love”\n\nDate: Aug. 10, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Feel Like Makin’ Love” is rather subdued for a song about sex. Flack’s voice is beautiful. But even with the song clocking in at under three minutes, it gets tiring. D’Angelo’s exceptional 2000 cover would prove a funk guitar riff can work wonders.\n\n150. Stories - “Brother Louie”\n\nDate: Aug. 25, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\n“Brother Louie” was originally written and recorded by British soul group Hot Chocolate. The song tells the tale interracial love affair between a white man and a black woman that doesn’t go over well. New York band Stories’ take on the song rocks a bit harder. Its most notable characteristic is lead singer Ian Lloyd’s high-pitched voice that, paired with the track’s groove, would become a blueprint for just about any rocker taking on more uptempo rock in the 1970s.\n\n149. Andy Gibb - “(Love Is) Thicker Than Water”\n\nDate: March 4, 1978\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nAndy Gibb reaches for a level of vocal dynamics on “(Love Is) Thicker Than Water” that was a bit beyond him. Maybe he attempted to separate himself from his older brothers. Though, it’s also likely the song was aided in its push to No. 1 given The Bee Gees’ amazing hot streak. Though its groove is decent, “(Love Is) Thicker Than Water” would prove the least memorable of the younger Gibb’s hits.\n\n148. The Hues Corporation - “Rock the Boat”\n\nDate: July 6, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nThe Hues Corporation’s “Rock the Boat” is an above-average soul masquerading as a disco anthem. But in the 1970s, it was all about getting people to the dancefloor. The verses on “Rock the Boat” are forgettable. But the chorus soars with joy.\n\n147. B.J. Thomas - “(Hey Won’t You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song”\n\nDate: April 26, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“(Hey Won’t You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song” is a somewhat forgettable song about sad songs, which makes it fit well in the country genre. B.J. Thomas’ storytelling comes with conviction and that touch of twang gives it a sense of authenticity.\n\n146. Leo Sayer - “When I Need You”\n\nDate: May 14, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“When I Need You” is a better ballad than it should have been. Lyrically, the song is quite boring. But the arrangement draws you in along with Leo Sayer’s strong vocal performance. You even get a nice saxophone solo from Bobby Keys, which never hurts.\n\n145. Helen Reddy - “Angie Baby”\n\nDate: Dec. 28, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nThere isn’t much that separates “Angie Baby” from other soft rock songs of the 1970s, including Helen Reddy’s other hits. But the track’s mysterious nature hooks you. Reddy never publicly stated what “Angie Baby” was about, giving listeners a reason to speculate and play it again and again.\n\n144. Van McCoy & The Soul City Symphony - “The Hustle”\n\nDate: July 26, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nDisco was a thing before “The Hustle” went to No. 1. But Van McCoy & The Soul City Symphony’s dance song marks the moment when the genre became a true driving musical force during the second half of the 1970s. “The Hustle” helped pave the way for any artist that was willing, to ride disco’s beats, syncopated basslines and strings to the top of the charts.\n\n143. Commodores - “Three Times a Lady”\n\nDate: Aug. 12, 1978\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\n“Three times a Lady” is the song that took the Commodores from a top-level funk band to a superstar act. More importantly, it set Lionel Richie up as a true star (and foreshadowed his amazing solo run in the 1980s). It’s easy to make a parody of Richie’s slow songs (plenty of people have). But he sings “Three Times a Lady,” a lame song, about as well as you can. What saves the day is a strong chorus that gets stuck in your head, whether you like it or not.\n\n142. Frankie Valli - “Grease”\n\nDate: Aug. 26, 1978\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nUnlike the other songs from “Grease” was written specifically for the movie and didn’t appear in the original musical. A breezy slice of funk and disco (of course it’s written by Barry Gibb), “Grease” is a good pop song whose chorus is a bit dated. There aren’t too many people shouting “Grease is the word” these days.\n\n141. Eagles - “Best of My Love”\n\nDate: March 1, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nThe Eagles’ first No. 1 showcases the band’s ability to turn their country influences into soft rock gold. “Best of My Love” is a slow-burner, almost too slow. But its mellow vibe has a way of hypnotizing you thanks to Don Henley’s voice.\n\n140. Elton John - “Philadelphia Freedom”\n\nDate: April 12, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nElton John could pretty much do whatever he wanted in the 1970s and it would become a hit. Case in point, “Philadelphia Freedom” (recorded as The Elton John Band) was simply a favor John did for friend Billie Jean King and her Philadelphia Freedoms professional tennis team. John and Bernie Taupin’s composition grows on you with its building strings and John’s enthusiasm. The song is an admirable attempt at paying homage to the Philadelphia Soul of the era, even if it’s not all that cool.\n\n139. Steve Miller Band - “Rock’n Me”\n\nDate: Nov. 6, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Rock’n Me” is the sound of Steve Miller going full pop-rock. Even on his other hits, you get a sense of the skilled bluesman that arrived in the late 1960s. But “Rock’n Me” is a fairly basic song with a catchy hook and decent guitar work. You can’t help but wish Miller would have stretched it out a bit.\n\n138. Andy Gibb - “Shadow Dancing”\n\nDate: June 17, 1978\n\nWeeks on top: 7\n\n“Shadow Dancing” was co-written by the Bee Gees and features the group on backing vocals. Not surprisingly, it comes with the same catchy groove the Bee Gees road to chart success. “Shadow Dancing” also never reaches the sonic heights of the Bee Gees other disco classics. Though, it stayed on top for seven weeks.\n\n137. K.C. and the Sunshine Band - “(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty”\n\nDate: Sept. 11, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nK.C. and the Sunshine Band’s disco hits all pretty much sound the same. “(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty” isn’t all that different from “Get Down Tonight” or “(That’s The Way) I Like It.” It isn’t as catchy as those songs either. But when it comes to pushing people out onto dancefloors at clubs, it more than got the job done.\n\n136. James Taylor - “You’ve Got a Friend”\n\nDate: July 31, 1971\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nIt might seem strange for such an iconic song to rank so low on this list. But Carole King’s version of “You’ve Got a Friend” from “Tapestry” radiates with the desperation of a late-night call where one person extends hope to another. James Taylor’s version isn’t as emotionally impactful. Sure, Taylor had a way of making it more universal in its lovely pop sound. But the smile it puts on your face doesn’t mean as much without the tearful turmoil that took place first. For that reason, King’s version stays with you more.\n\n135. The Beatles - “The Long and Winding Road”\n\nDate: June 13, 1970\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\n“The Long and Winding Road” (released alongside the weaker “For You Blue”) is yet another example of the mismatch that was Paul McCartney and Phil Spector on The Beatles’ “Let It Be.” It was John Lennon who wanted Spector on board. But the producer’s overwhelming strings don’t quite suit “The Long and Winding Road,” a melancholy song performed beautifully by McCartney, in the least.\n\n134. Bellamy Brothers - “Let Your Love Flow”\n\nDate: May 1, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nSongwriter Larry E. Williams originally wrote “Let Your Love Flow” for Neil Diamond after serving as a roadie in the star’s live shows. But the song was too country for Diamond. It eventually worked its way to the Bellamy Brothers, earning the duo crossover success. Though it’s rooted in country, “Let Your Love Flow” (as the title suggests) is a feel-good pop song that very much fell in line with the kinds of music the Eagles were ruling the charts with around the same time.\n\n133. Donna Summer & Barbra Streisand - “No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)” 7\n\nDate: Nov. 24, 1979\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nHad Barbra Streisand sang “No More Tears” all by her lonesome, it would sit in the same forgettable place as her other overblown, traditional love songs of the era. But Donna Summer brings raw emotion to the song that Streisand herself couldn’t muster. And nearly two minutes in it transforms into the kind of disco song Summer had mastered.\n\n132. The O’Jays - “Love Train”\n\nDate: March 24, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nThe O’Jays have better songs than “Love Train.” But it remains their biggest hit. In removing the heavy funk on amazing songs like “Backstabbers” and “For the Love of Money,” The O’Jays create something slightly more universal, even if it is a bit campy.\n\n131. Johnnie Taylor - “Disco Lady”\n\nDate: April 3, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\n“Disco Lady” was a key moment for disco. It was the first song to hit the No. 1 spot with the genre in the title. The song’s theme and lyrics leave a bit to be desired. But at a time when the genre had plenty of fast-paced anthems, “Disco Lady” became the ultimate dancefloor pickup song.\n\n130. Ohio Players - “Love Rollercoaster”\n\nDate: Jan. 31, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nOhio Players songs like “Fire” and “Love Rollercoaster” weren’t all that inventive. But, boy, did the Dayton band funk out hard. The catchy “Love Rollercoaster” comes with urban legends, involving a scream heard during the instrumental part of the song. Some say it was someone being murdered in the recording studio. Others suggest it’s the sound of a woman falling off a roller coaster to her death. None of that was true. But didn’t hurt “Love Rollercoaster” on the charts.\n\n129. Paul Revere & the Raiders - “Indian Reservation (The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation Indian)”\n\nDate: June 24, 1971\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Indian Reservation (The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation Indian)” was written with well-meaning intentions by John D. Loudermilk and most of them were realized by Paul Revere & the Raiders (then going by the Raiders. The first version of the song, recorded by Don Fardon in 1968, was sadly misguided and racist. But the Raiders’ got the song’s call to recognize the genocide of Native Americans and the horrible origins of America. The group gives the song a marching, garage rock feel that made it hit home enough that the song became one of the more unlikely No. 1 hits of the 1970s.\n\n128. The Miracles - “Love Machine (Part 1)”\n\nDate: March 6, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nSmokey Robinson was long gone by the time The Miracles released their 1976 album “City of Angels.” Billy Griffin was now the lead singer and one could argue his voice served the group better for the times. Griffin tended to blend with the music, especially the upbeat stuff. That’s certainly the case with the group’s disco hit “Love Machine.” If the track sounds like a Jackson 5 song, it should. It was produced by Freddie Perren, formerly a member of The Corporation, the team that helmed Michael and company’s early hits.\n\n127. George Harrison - “Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)”\n\nDate: June 30, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nFollowing his massive “The Concert for Bangladesh,” George Harrison was in the mood for more peace and love. There isn’t much to “Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)” lyrically other than a guy longing for a sense of universal joy. What sets the song apart is Harrison’s exceptional slide guitar work.\n\n126. Charlie Rich - “The Most Beautiful Girl”\n\nDate: Dec. 15, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\n“The Most Beautiful Girl” dates back to 1968 and combines two songs co-written by Noro Wilson: “Hey Mister” and “Mama McCluskie.” Other recordings of the song are more extreme. Charlie Rich’s version plays more like a country and blue-eyed-soul hybrid. What it lacks in charm, it makes up for in relatable sentiment.\n\n125. Rose Royce - “Car Wash”\n\nDate: Jan. 29, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nWhen Norman Whitfield, the producer behind The Temptations’ “Papa Was a Rolling Stone,” left Motown to start his own label, he needed a way to promote his new group, Rose Royce. Enter “Car Wash,” the film Whitfield was commissioned to provide the soundtrack for. Rose Royce handled the title track, which features one of Whitfield’s signature intros. The song is a catchy mix of funk and disco, even if it doesn’t reach the heights of Whitfield’s work with Motown.\n\n124. Commodores - “Still”\n\nDate: Nov. 17, 1979\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nLionel Richie was inspired to write “Still” after witnessing the divorce of two of his friends. Yet, he sings the song like he’s going through a breakup himself (he wasn’t, at least, not at that moment). Richie’s ballads, both with the Commodores and solo, tended to feel vague and boring (“Still” approaches the latter at times). But “Still” feels as intimate as anything he was associated with during the 1970s.\n\n123. Eagles - “New Kid in Town”\n\nDate: Feb. 26, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nThe theme of “New Kid in Town” is a bit depressing. Frequent Eagles collaborator J.D. Souther brought the chorus to the band. Don Henley and Glenn Frey rounded it out, using a Western gunfighter returning to town one day only to realize there was a younger, faster gun. The song was an analogy for the Eagles’ status atop the music scene. Henley would say the song foreshadows the Eagles’ demise. But that was still a little ways off.\n\n122. Donna Summer - “MacArthur Park”\n\nDate: Nov. 11, 1978\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nWritten by Jimmy Webb and originally recorded by Richard Harris, “MacArthur Park” immediately stood out for its over-the-top arrangement and odd lyrics. Few people would touch it. And yet, producer Giorgio Moroder felt the high notes were perfect for Donna Summer. The arrangement also allowed Moroder room to pump every electronic sound he could dream of. The lyrics to “MacArthur Park” are still head-scratching. But Moroder and Summer do about everything you can do with the song.\n\n121. Daryl Hall & John Oates - “Rich Girl”\n\nDate: March 26, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\n“Rich Girl” is a takedown of a spoiled rich girl. But it didn’t start that way. Daryl Hall originally wrote it about a guy who was dating a rich woman. But he liked the sound of “girl” instead of “guy.” Either way, the song’s bouncy blue-eyed soul and lyrics hook you right away. Hall & Oates would release more vital hits in the 1980s. But “Rich Girl” was a good start.\n\n120. Andy Gibb - “I Just Want to Be Your Everything”\n\nDate: July 30, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\nAndy Gibb takes a page out of his brothers’ book by riding the groove to “I Just Want to Be Your Everything” with a subtle pop voice before unleashing the signature Gibb falsetto on the chorus. The song isn’t as danceable or as interesting as the Bee Gees’ major hits. But Andy Gibb showed serious promise at just the right time.\n\n119. Diana Ross - “Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You’re Going To)”\n\nDate: Jan. 24, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nBy 1975, Diana Ross was in full dual-threat mode. In between releasing hits, Ross was starring in movies like the 1975 Motown/Paramount project “Mahogany.” The movie isn’t much to write home about. But “Theme from Mahogany” became the one thing that stood out most. Few artists could pull off something so overly tender and orchestral. But Ross was one of them.\n\n118. Edgar Winter Group - “Frankenstein”\n\nDate: May 26, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Frankenstein” is a showcase of Edgar Winter’s genius. He plays the bulk of instruments on the song, including synthesizer, electric piano, saxophone, timbales. Pieced together from various longer versions, its unique sound was still enough to catch on as one of the more surprising (and fun) No. 1 hits on this list.\n\n117. Ringo Starr - “Photograph”\n\nDate: Nov. 24, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Photograph” might be the most exceptional thing to come out of Ringo Starr’s solo career. Co-written with George Harrison, the song combines formulas from two different chapters of the Beatles. It has the whimsical vibe of the group’s late-career work while featuring a chorus that would give some of the band’s early album cuts a run for their money.\n\n116. Billy Paul - “Me and Mrs. Jones”\n\nDate: Dec. 16, 1972\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nOne of the signature songs from the Philadelphia soul era, “Me and Mrs. Jones” finds Billy Paul, perhaps, flaunting his sensual vocals a bit too much (especially since the song shows no real moral dilemma about having an extra-marital affair). But even that can’t take away from the strength of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff’s breezy production.\n\n115. Dionne Warwick & The Spinners - “Then Came You”\n\nDate: Oct. 26, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Then Came You” was the first No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 for both The Spinners and Dionne Warwick. Neither Warwick nor The Spinners’ singer Bobby Smith delivers an earth-shattering vocal. But the upbeat, pop-infused soul of “Then Came You” fit with the dancefloor vibes of the era.\n\n114. Eagles - “One of These Nights”\n\nDate: Aug. 2, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“One of These Nights,” the title track to Eagles’ fourth studio album, contains a groove that would push listeners to the dancefloor. Randy Meisner’s high-pitched vocal, which makes a play for soul, helps matters. But the song’s anchor is Don Felder’s guitar work, which includes a slick blues guitar solo.\n\n113. K.C. and the Sunshine Band - “I’m Your Boogie Man”\n\nDate: June 11, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“I’m Your Boogie Man” feels like the least sensational of K.C. and the Sunshine Band’s hits from the era. But it’s still extremely catchy, especially when it gets to its funky outro. Whether you were a fan or not, K.C. and his band were on a heck of a run.\n\n112. Rod Stewart - “Da Ya Think I’m Sexy?”\n\nDate: Feb. 10, 1979\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\nIf you’re going to title a song “Da Ya Think I’m Sexy?” you better make sure the answer is yes. Rod Stewart may not be most people’s definition of sexy. But he had the voice to conquer all. More importantly, “Da Ya Think I’m Sexy?” had a Eurodisco sound that was enticing. Stewart’s bravado borders on cringeworthy. But he holds back just enough to make “Da Ya Think I’m Sexy?” work.\n\n111. Glen Campbell - “Rhinestone Cowboy”\n\nDate: Sept. 6, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nThough he didn’t write “Rhinestone Cowboy,” Glen Campbell identified with the Larry Weiss-penned tune about a seasoned musician who persevered through tough times with bright moments still to come. You can hear the passion and conviction in Campbell’s voice, which is fitting since the country singer’s career would follow the story of “Rhinestone Cowboy” as he crossed over to pop.\n\n110. Johnny Nash - “I Can See Clearly Now”\n\nDate: Nov. 4, 1972\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\nThere are elements to “I Can See Clearly Now” that separate it from run-of-the-mill, feel-good songs. It’s a reggae track, which gives it a bounce, loaded with soul thanks to Johnny Nash’s convincing vocal. “I Can See Clearly Now” is a song about overcoming a rough patch and Nash makes it feel genuine.\n\n109. Michael Jackson - “Ben”\n\nDate: Oct. 14, 1972\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nFollowing a historic run of singles with The Jackson 5, Michael Jackson was poised to become a solo star. That began at the age of 13 when Jackson released “Ben,” a ballad from the 1972 film of the same name. All of Michael Jackson’s career can be hard to access given the sexual abuse allegations that followed him around. That’s especially true when you examine his work as a child performer. Stepping away from that, it’s clear in a song like “Ben” that Jackson as a teenager was a better singer than 90% of pop artists are as full-grown adults.\n\n108. Helen Reddy - “Delta Dawn”\n\nDate: Sept. 15, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Delta Dawn” is an all-time great country song. That being said, Helen Reddy’s version probably wouldn’t be the first you should go to. Tanya Tucker’s 1972 version is better thanks to Tucker putting her powerful voice front and center. Reddy takes a backseat during the song’s epic chorus. But she still delivers the goods on the verses with blissful charm to her voice that matches the song’s fun piano melody.\n\n107. Billy Preston - “Will It Go Round in Circles”\n\nDate: July 7, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\n“Will It Go Round in Circles” was the first of two No. 1 singles that would take Billy Preston from the guy known for his session work with The Beatles and The Rolling Stones to a pop star. The song’s key lyrics, “I’ve got a song, I ain’t got no melody...” began as a throwaway comment Preston made to songwriting partner Bruce Fischer. As you can tell, the two eventually came up with a solid melody.\n\n106. John Sebastian - “Welcome Back”\n\nDate: May 8, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nAs the story goes, TV producer Alan Sachs wanted a theme song for his new show “Welcome Back, Kotter” that sounded like a Lovin’ Spoonful song. So why not go to the band’s frontman John Sebastian, who obviously knew how to write a hit? Welcome Back, Kotter” would prove a big ratings success, pushing Sebastian’s theme to the top of the charts.\n\n105. Bachman-Turner Overdrive - “You Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet”\n\nDate: Nov. 9, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“You Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet” borrows from many songs of its era, which is to say there’s nothing original about it. The stuttering hook is ripped directly out of “My Generation.” Randy Bachman has even dismissed his vocal performance as a bad Van Morrison knockoff (Very true). And yet, there’s no denying the hook. It’s an onslaught of rock that renders the so-so verses meaningless.\n\n104. Diana Ross - “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough”\n\nDate: Sept. 19, 1970\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nDiana Ross had already recorded a version of “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” as a member of The Supremes alongside The Temptations. But this is a very different (and slightly lesser) version of one of Motown’s signature songs. Ross’ 1970 version was her star-making solo turn, built around her spoken word verses. It was Ross basking in her star power at a time when she was embarking on the next chapter of her career.\n\n103. The Shocking Blue - “Venus”\n\nDate: Feb. 7, 1970\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nStructurally, “Venus” is brilliant. It’s hook after hook after hook. However, the original’s weak link is singer Mariska Veres’ vocal. It’s not bad. It just doesn’t fully suit her. Where you got a sense of how strong the song was when it became a No. 1 hit again thanks to Banarama’s cover in 1986.\n\n102. Love Unlimited Orchestra - “Love’s Theme”\n\nDate: Feb. 9, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nThe instrumental “Love’s Theme” shows off Barry White’s ability as a composer. It’s a love song from one of the most sensual voices in music history going No. 1 that doesn’t feature him ever singing a note. White was a master at more than just having a deep voice.\n\n101. Bay City Rollers - “Saturday Night”\n\nDate: Jan. 3, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nAt its core, Bay City Rollers’ “Saturday Night” is a glam-rock song. It isn’t as sophisticated as the best work by, say, David Bowie or T. Rex. But the Bay City Rollers had something few people did at the time – that chant: “S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y.” You know the song’s special right from the start.\n\n100. Don McLean - “American Pie”\n\nDate: Jan 15, 1972\n\nWeeks on top: 4\n\n“American Pie” is a lot. The LP version of Don McLean’s iconic tune is so long (approaching nine minutes), the single was initially divided into two parts. McLean uses all that time to create a cast of characters and stories that can be hard to keep track of. Of course, the thing people remember is “the day the music died,” referring to the 1959 plane crash that killed Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper, and Ritchie Valens. “American Pie” is all about nostalgia. To say it means a lot to a lot of people would be an understatement.\n\n99. The Sylvers - “Boogie Fever”\n\nDate: May 15, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nProducer Freddie Perren, who had worked with The Jackson 5 as part of Motown’s The Corporation, made a nice transition to disco. His crowning achievement might be “Boogie Fever.” In co-writing and producing The Sylvers’ hit, Perren found a sweet spot between soul music and disco, bringing the same catchy dance vibes he helped oversee at Motown.\n\n98. K.C. and the Sunshine Band - “That’s The Way (I Like It)”\n\nDate: Nov. 22, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\n“That’s The Way (I Like It)” starts with a great chorus and then essentially goes blank with verses overshadowed by horns until that chorus comes in again. For people who despise disco and its history, “That’s The Way (I Like It)” might be exhibit A. But it’s a song that took off at the start of the genre’s rise and then got more and more popular as years went on.\n\n97. Rhythm Heritage - “Theme from S.W.A.T.”\n\nDate: Feb. 28, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nOnly a few TV themes have gone to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. “Theme from S.W.A.T.” might seem like the most surprising considering the single recording is different from the TV version. But that’s what likely pushed it to the top. While “S.W.A.T.” was popular, Rhythm Heritage’s version of the song (the TV version was done by Barry De Vorzon’s orchestra) cranks up the disco at a time when people couldn’t get enough of it.\n\n96. MFSB featuring The Three Degrees - “TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)”\n\nDate: April 20, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nThough it can be debated, “TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)” was likely the first true disco song to land at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. And all it took was legendary songwriting team Gamble and Hugg creating a theme song for “Soul Train” (It was also the first TV theme song to earn the top spot on the chart).\n\n95. Grand Funk - “We’re an American Band”\n\nDate: Sept. 29, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“We’re an American Band” is a song built for mass appeal. It’s loud and catchy with verses that can barely contain themselves. One could argue the chorus is a bit too on the nose (We get it, you’re a band coming to give folks a good time). But everything about “We’re an American Band” is tightly wound, produced in a precise fashion to conquer mainstream radio.\n\n94. George McCrae - “Rock Your Baby”\n\nDate: July 13, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nGeorge McCrae’s “Rock Your Baby” was written and produced by Harry Wayne Casey and Richard Finch of future disco kings KC and the Sunshine Band. From a music standpoint, “Rock Your Baby” is more about the instrumentation than George McCrae’s soft vocal. It feels like the kind of inventive dance cut someone like Pharrell or Daft Punk would toy around within the modern era of dance music.\n\n93. The Manhattans - “Kiss and Say Goodbye”\n\nDate: July 24, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nIt’s hard to imagine “Kiss and Say Goodbye,” The Manhattan’s sexy, 1976 R&B tune without Winfred Lovett’s bass vocal intro. Lovett originally saw the song as a country anthem, given the rise in popularity of the genre at the time. But the Manhattans hung on to, scoring a hit with an old-fashioned soul love song.\n\n92. Bee Gees - “Love You Inside Out”\n\nDate: June 9, 1979\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nAll the Bee Gees needed to move out of the disco sound that made them megastars was to emphasize the funk. “Love You Inside Out” has quite the groove and funky guitars. They’re so good, you’re willing to sit through the Bee Gees reaching into their disco tendencies on the pre-chorus just to hear more of the sweet instrumentation.\n\n91. Gordon Lightfoot - “Sundown”\n\nDate: June 29, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nOn its surface, “Sundown” is a basic folk song with a great hook. Beneath the surface, it’s absolutely terrifying. Gordon Lightfoot sounds numb as he combines obsession with looming rage as he thinks about a woman out with her friends who may be doing her wrong. In that sense, it’s far more interesting (and, again, terrifying) than just about any folk song from the decade.\n\n90. Nick Gilder - “Hot Child in the City”\n\nDate: Oct. 28, 1978\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Hot Child in the City” was a power-pop song that feels bright and uplifting sonically. But there’s much more to Nick Gilder’s hit. The track is actually about child prostitution, giving more weight to a tune that could have coasted on its already fantastic melody. The song would prove groundbreaking as one of the first examples of power-pop to break out commercially.\n\n89. Anita Ward - “Ring My Bell”\n\nDate: June 30, 1979\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\n“Ring My Bell” has just the right amount of cowbell. Writer/producer Frederick Knight knew what he was doing in giving the song an edgy disco groove accented by layers of instrumentation. Ward sings the hook with the right amount of restraint before stepping aside for more of the song’s instrumental magic.\n\n88. Herb Alpert - “Rise”\n\nDate: Oct. 20, 1979\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\n“Rise” was just what the world needed at the right time. The disco backlash was about to hit and while Herb Alpert’s instrumental was rooted in the genre, it had credibility with its jazz leanings. That would earn “Rise” the label as post-disco. Whatever you want to call it, Alpert combined a sexy sound (that saxophone) with a fun groove. “Rise” would reach the top of the charts again nearly 20 years after it first hit that to it being sampled by The Notorious B.I.G.’s “Hypnotize.”\n\n87. Player - “Baby Come Back”\n\nDate: Jan. 14, 1978\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nPlayer’s breakthrough hit wreaks of cool, which is saying something for a soft rock song. The intro and its driving bassline are reminiscent of Hall & Oates. Singers Peter Beckett and J.C. Crowley don’t quite have the blue-eyed-soul sound down like Daryl Hall. But, the chorus to “Baby Come Back” piles on the slickness and a killer guitar solo that closes things out.\n\n86. Yvonne Elliman - “If I Can’t Have You”\n\nDate: May 13, 1978\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nYvonne Elliman wasn’t a disco artist. She specialized in pop ballads (Elliman was initially supposed to sing “How Deep Is Your Love” for the “Saturday Night Fever”) soundtrack. Of course, like Diana Ross and Thelma Houston, Elliman’s stellar voice had no problem transitioning to disco. Her version of “I Can’t Have You” also provided one of the most heartfelt additions to “Saturday Night Fever.”\n\n85. Manfred Mann’s Earth Band - “Blinded by the Light”\n\nDate: Feb. 19, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Blinded by the Light” was not one of Bruce Springsteen’s finest songwriting achievements. He wrote the song for “Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.” while reading a rhyming dictionary. The story (or lack thereof) being told isn’t cohesive. But there was something catchy about the hook: “Blinded by the light, cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night,” which is surely what Manfred Mann’s Earth Band latched onto in covering it. The group changed up the lyrics on the chorus and gave the song a progressive rock feel. It worked. Though, Springsteen was not a fan.\n\n84. The Four Seasons - “December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)” 8\n\nDate: March 13, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nThe Four Seasons were one of the most prolific hitmakers of the 1960s. By the 1970s, no one expected to hear much from the group again. Then came “December, 1963 (Oh What a Night),” a perfect storm of nostalgia. Bob Gaudio truly stepped up his game production-wise, adding the disco elements that would give the group a modern touch to go along with their amazing vocals.\n\n83. Ohio Players - “Fire”\n\nDate: Feb. 8, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nOhio Players’ lively funk anthem “Fire” arrived at the perfect time to capitalize on the rise of disco. But it probably would have been a hit in any era, thanks to the simplicity of its hook backed with a serious funk attitude. The only knock is that “Fire” can get a bit repetitive, especially in its album version, something that probably didn’t matter much on dancefloors in 1975.\n\n82. Linda Ronstadt - “You’re No Good”\n\nDate: Feb. 15, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nSeveral artists recorded songwriter Clint Ballard Jr.’s “You’re No Good” before Linda Ronstadt got to it. What makes Ronstadt’s version the definitive one is that it does away with the overpowering instrumentation of other versions. With production from Peter Asher, Ronstadt’s take starts with a guitar that suggests dread before Ronstadt jumps in as a woman scorned.\n\n81. Bee Gees - “Jive Talkin’”\n\nDate: Aug. 9, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nIt seemed like the Bee Gees were destined to become prolific hitmakers after topping the charts with 1971′s “How Can You Mend a Broken Heart.” But it would take four more years and then move to disco to make it happen. The group’s rule over the 1970s (nine No. 1 hits in total) truly begins with “Jive Talkin,’” the lead single from 1975′s “Main Course” that would be included on “Saturday Night Fever” two years later. “Jive Talkin’” is a funk song that injects all the disco bells and whistles you can imagine into it.\n\n80. The Chi-Lites - “Oh Girl”\n\nDate: May 27, 1972\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nThe multi-part group harmony is a lost art. In the 1970s, four-part harmony groups like The Stylistics, The Spinners, The O’Jays and The Manhattans delivered some of the more timeless songs of the era. But perhaps the best at it were The Chi-Lites. The group’s other signature hit “Have You Seen Her” comes with funky production. “Oh Girl” is much slower with the signature instrument being a harmonica. None of that ends up mattering once Eugene Record begins singing. “Oh Girl” is a heartbreaker of a song because The Chi-Lites carry such raw emotion in their amazing voices. It was enough to make even Tony Soprano lose it.\n\n79. Walter Murphy & The Big Apple Band - “A Fifth of Beethoven”\n\nDate: Oct. 9, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nWalter Murphy wrote “A Fifth of Beethoven” for a TV commercial. But it ended up serving as the centerpiece of his demo. Even with the song sharing the same obvious influences as disco, it took the industry a while to catch on to “A Fifth of Beethoven.” But it eventually became a major hit and was added to the “Saturday Night Fever” soundtrack.\n\n78. Stevie Wonder - “You Haven’t Done Nothin’”\n\nDate: Nov. 2, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nInspired by Marvin Gaye’s “What’s Going On,” Stevie Wonder became more socially conscious in the 1970s. “You Haven’t Done Nothin’” ranks up there with his most politically charged tracks, serving as a takedown of President Richard Nixon right as the Watergate scandal was consuming the nation. Wonder delivers one of his most forceful vocals while playing every instrument on the song save for Reggie McBride’s thrilling bass. And yes, that’s the Jackson 5 singing backup.\n\n77. Bill Conti - “Gonna Fly Now (Theme from Rocky)”\n\nDate: July 2, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nAs a standalone composition, “Gonna Fly Now” would never be a hit. It’s not exactly the “Theme from Shaft.” But that’s the magic of movies. “Rocky” was a massive success both at the box office and during awards season and Bill Conti’s theme was an integral part of the film, which made it an inescapable slice of popular culture. Credit to Conti for crafting a song that comes in right at the moment you fall in love with cinema’s ultimate underdog story. It might have been Sylvester Stallone running up those steps in Philadelphia, but it wouldn’t have meant as much without Conti’s soaring score.\n\n76. M - “Pop Muzik”\n\nDate: Nov. 3, 1979\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nAt times, “Pop Muzik” borders on becoming a mess of a song. But its glowing synthesizers point towards the future of pop music. It would have been easy for British musician Robin Scott, aka M, to make it a disco or funk song. But he, instead, goes the art pop route. “Pop Muzik” would be tied to its clever music video as well, making it even more groundbreaking. This was music for the MTV era before the MTV era took hold.\n\n75. The Jackson 5 - “The Love You Save”\n\nDate: June 27, 1970\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nFor as ahead of its years as Michael Jackson’s voice sounded, it also had a youthful exuberance to it that presented a feel of nostalgia. “The Love You Save” mixes MJ’s voice, an enticing funk groove and the brothers delivering fun backing vocals. If any act was on cruise control in 1970 it was The Jackson 5, who couldn’t miss.\n\n74. Barry White - “Can’t Get Enough of Your Love, Babe”\n\nDate: Sept. 21, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nA declaration of love so sincere it turns into parody in the hands of anyone else. But Barry White had a voice that was a force of nature. His sensuality consumes you like a teddy bear hugging you. The lyrics to “Can’t Get Enough of Your Love, Babe” lyrics feel like a sultry stream of consciousness in the way they melt you.\n\n73. LaBelle - “Lady Marmalade”\n\nDate: March 29, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nA generation of music listeners remembers “Lady Marmalade” as a 21st-century all-star anthem featuring four massive female pop stars. But LaBelle didn’t need all that star power back in 1975. The group had Patti LaBelle. Her original lead vocal explodes out of your speakers. “Gitchie, gitchie, ya-ya, da-da...” never sounded this good.\n\n72. Harry Chapin - “Cat’s in the Cradle”\n\nDate: Dec. 21, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Cat’s in the Cradle” tells a compelling and relatable story about the relationship between a father and son and how complicated it can be to find balance. Harry Chapin’s song is a simplistic folk-rock song. But its story grips throughout, building to an ending that would make any parent give a nod of approval.\n\n71. Elton John - “Bennie and the Jets”\n\nDate: April 13, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nA song about a futuristic rock band made up of androids that serve as a critique of the 1970s music industry. Yep, that’s some crazy sh___. “Bennie and the Jets” wasn’t supposed to be released as a single but radio stations forced the record label’s hand. DJs and fans knew better. Bernie Taupin’s wild tale was truly one of Elton John’s best performance songs right down to him singing “B-B-B-Bennie...” and then screaming the name over and over to the song’s end.\n\n70. Paul Simon - “50 Ways to Leave Your Lover”\n\nDate: Feb. 7, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nPaul Simon certainly has several serious songs about divorce, which is what makes “50 Ways to Leave Your Lover” refreshing. The song finds Simon in humorous storyteller mode. The chorus, “You just slip out the back, Jack/Make a new plan, Stan...,” is the most memorable part. But the verses are also enticing thanks to a subtle marching band drum beat delivered by Steve Gadd.\n\n69. Wild Cherry - “Play That Funky Music”\n\nDate: Sept. 18, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nWild Cherry literally came out of nowhere. Mingo Junction, Ohio is a town of fewer than 4,000 people. But “Play That Funky Music,” released on the Cleveland Recording Company label, had big-city ambitions. Sonically, it sounds full and rich. The chorus is pandering on the highest level. But what white guy is going to hear the song and not sing and dance along to it?\n\n68. Bee Gees - “You Should Be Dancing”\n\nDate: Sept. 4, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nThe Bee Gees were working their way to dancefloor supremacy on 1976′s “Children of the World” and they knew it. The album’s lead single, “You Should Be Dancing,” isn’t meant to entice you to the dancefloor. It demands it. The combination of the group’s sweet harmonies and top-notch session players make it impossible to resist.\n\n67. The Staple Singers - “Let’s Do It Again”\n\nDate: Dec. 27, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nCurtis Mayfield wrote “Let’s Do It Again” for the Bill Cosby and Sidney Portier film of the same name. You could imagine Mayfield performing the song himself. But by having The Staple Singers do it, Mayfield gifted the song to an even better singer than he was at the time in Mavis Staples. With Mayfield providing the stunning instrumentation, Staples brings her vocal swagger to every blissful piece of the song’s production.\n\n66. The Doobie Brothers - “Black Water”\n\nDate: March 15, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nPatrick Simmons created the riff for the Doobie Brothers’ “Black Water” during the recording sessions for “The Captain and Me.” It was a bit of a throwaway until producer Ted Templeman heard it. Simmons would round out the song on a trip to New Orleans, giving the song its nostalgic, Delta-blues and roots music influence. It’s easy to imagine every rock and roll artist wishing they’d written “Black Water.” Not only does it hark back to the roots of the genre, but it also went to No. 1 while doing so.\n\n65. Freddy Fender - “Before the Next Teardrop Falls”\n\nDate: May 31, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nFreddy Fender’s ‘Before the Next Teardrop Falls,” a song that had been recorded numerous times before he took it on, is gut-wrenching. All of that has to do with Fender’s vocal performance – delivered in both English and Spanish – and the simple, yet precise production behind it. Fender’s voice contained a sense of honesty reminiscent of some of the best heartbreak songs of the 1960s.\n\n64. A Taste of Honey - “Boogie Oogie Oogie”\n\nDate: Sept. 9, 1978\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nDisco had peaked in terms of popularity by the second half of 1978, but the genre was still producing exceptional songs. Among them was “Boogie Oogie Oogie.” In terms of theme, A Taste of Honey’s hit is soaked in the disco aesthetic. But it’s also a clever dance song that could have hit in the 1990s or even 2000s (just imagine Kylie Minogue on it).\n\n63. Blue Swede - “Hooked on a Feeling”\n\nDate: April 6, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Ooga-Chaka Ooga-Ooga Ooga-Chaka Ooga-Ooga Ooga-Chaka Ooga-Ooga Ooga-Chaka Ooga-Ooga...” “Hooked on a Feeling” began as a 1968 pop song by BJ Thomas. But that version doesn’t have the “Ooga-Chaka” part and that makes all the difference. Thomas’ song is about unrequited love and you can feel his melancholy. Blue Swede’s cover feels like the song that’s sure to win her back. “Hooked on a Feeling” has been overplayed thanks to TV and film (Thanks, “Ally McBeal”). But its inclusion in “Guardians of the Galaxy” and the blockbuster movie’s amazing soundtrack breathed new life into it in recent years.\n\n62. Eddie Kendricks - “Keep on Truckin’”\n\nDate: Nov. 10, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\n“Keep on Truckin’” isn’t the kind of song you’d expect from Eddie Kendricks’ solo career. His go-to role in The Temptations was the lead on ballads. But this was a calculated move. Kendricks and producer Frank Wilson wanted to make Kendricks’ a mainstay on dancefloors and finally struck gold with “Keep on Truckin.’” The song is a pretty straightforward funk tune. But Kendricks’ unmatched falsetto tone would set it apart, along with the stunning production on the final third, which has been sampled a time or two and foreshadowed elements of disco.\n\n61. Three Dog Night - “Mama Told Me (Not To Come)”\n\nDate: July 11, 1970\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nIn the hands of its songwriter Randy Newman, “Mama Told Me (Not To Come)” is a rather humorous song about a sheltered young man attending his first party in Los Angeles. Passed along to Three Dog Night, the tune becomes a fully loaded rock song ripe with elements of funk.\n\n60. The Steve Miller Band - “The Joker”\n\nDate: Jan. 12, 1974\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“The Joker” was a lot of people’s introduction to Steve Miller, despite the fact he’d been around as a great blues-rock musician for quite some time. And yet, what a way to re-introduce yourself: “Some people call me the space cowboy / Some call me the gangster of love...” None of it makes much sense, which is part of its likability. Miller is having a ton of fun on “The Joker,” referencing a bunch of lyrics from different songs, knowing he has a masterful groove to work with.\n\n59. K.C. and the Sunshine Band - “Get Down Tonight”\n\nDate: Aug. 30, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nBoth K.C. and the Sunshine Band’s name and vibe work against the group from a historical standpoint. It’s not the most sophisticated moniker. And the music is unapologetically exuberant. Still, K.C. and the boys could play. All you have to do is check out the intro to “Get Down Tonight” and its amazing bridge. “Get Down Tonight” is a party song, nothing more, nothing less. But it makes for one heck of a celebration.\n\n58. Bee Gees - “Night Fever”\n\nDate: March 18, 1978\n\nWeeks on top: 8\n\nMuch is written in this list about the Bee Gees’ hot streak in the 1970s. But here’s another thing to wow you. Starting with “Stayin’ Alive” hitting No. 1 on Feb. 4, 1978, the next three No. 1′s were younger brother Andy Gibb’s “(Love Is) Thicker Than Water” (co-written by Barry Gibb), the Bee Gees’ “Night Fever” (for eight weeks) and Yvonne Elliman’s “If I Can’t Have You” (a cover of a Bee Gees song). “Night Fever” is subtler than “Stayin’ Alive,” but its groove is nearly as catchy. The song would inspire the change in the name of “Saturday Night Fever,” which was originally called just “Saturday Night.”\n\n57. Donna Summer - “Bad Girls”\n\nDate: July 14, 1979\n\nWeeks on top: 5\n\nA song giving a shoutout to sex workers that spent five weeks at No. 1. Yes, only Donna Summer could pull this off. But it’s not just the theme of “Bad Girls” that Summer works miracles with. The song comes loaded with various street sounds that could have come across as corny. But Summer, as she was known to do, made it sexy.\n\n56. The Guess Who - “American Woman”\n\nDate: May 9, 1970\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nThe Guess Who became the first Canadian artist to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the band did it with an anti-war song; a bold move at the height of the Vietnam War. The funny part was, no one cared. Part of that had to do with audiences maybe not recognizing the song’s theme (The title did have the word “American” in it). But also, who can resist such an amazing guitar riff?\n\n55. Average White Band - “Pick Up the Pieces”\n\nDate: Feb. 22, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nFunny how a jazz and funk song could sound a lot like disco in 1975, but only better. Average White Band’s mostly instrumental composition “Pick Up the Pieces” is exceptional in just how sophisticated it is while also being one of the most danceable tunes of its era. And its quality is clear right from the opening licks. The song lasts just four minutes, but it could easily go on for days without anyone minding.\n\n54. The Emotions - “Best of My Love”\n\nDate: Aug. 20, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 5\n\nEarth, Wind & Fire’s Maurice White was making a name for himself as a songwriter and producer outside of his own band. He co-wrote “Best of My Love” for The Emotions with Al McKay and it became a megahit. The song’s potential is fully realized in the first few seconds thanks to its mesmerizing opening drumline. And while White deserves a lot of props, The Emotions’ vocals knock you off your feet. “Best of My Love” made its money in the disco era. But it’s a soul song that would have ruled the charts for a long while in any decade.\n\n53. Stevie Wonder - “You Are the Sunshine of My Life”\n\nDate: May 19, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nOn its surface, “You Are the Sunshine of My Life” seems like one of those simple Stevie Wonder love songs (Think: “Knocks Me Off My Feet” and “I Just Called to Say I Love You”) with endless amounts of universal appeal. But, like most Wonder songs, there’s more to it. Wonder’s production work is subtle but complex with his stellar electric piano playing leading the way. You could argue Wonder has stronger love ballads (or maybe just one). But “You Are the Sunshine of My Life” is certainly top tier.\n\n52. Gloria Gaynor - “I Will Survive”\n\nDate: March 10, 1979\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\n“I Will Survive” is cinematic in the way it starts. Chalk it up to co-writer Freddie Perren’s Motown background. Together with producer Dino Fekaris, they allow Gloria Gaynor’s stellar vocal to serve as the backbone before building a disco soundscape behind it. What pushes “I Will Survive” over the top is its “Rocky”-like orchestration on the chorus. Gaynor wasn’t going to let anyone take her down.\n\n51. Thelma Houston - “Don’t Leave Me This Way”\n\nDate: April 23, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“Don’t Leave Me This Way” was originally released by Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes in 1975. And yet, the song’s combination of R&B and disco didn’t fully work. But it did two years later in the hands of Thelma Houston. The cover was initially given to Diana Ross as her follow-up to “Love Hangover.” You can feel the similarities. Houston’s light and luscious voice allows the disco grooves to coast along until the chorus explodes. The result is one of the great dance songs of the 1970s and one of a handful of tunes that epitomizes the pleasurable aspects of disco.\n\n50. Bee Gees - “How Deep Is Your Love”\n\nDate: Dec. 24, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nAmid all the dance anthems The Bee Gees took to No. 1 in the 1970s sits “How Deep Is Your Love,” the group’s greatest ballad. Its simple, yet melodic structure makes “How Deep Is Your Love” the quintessential boy band song, a rite of passage any aspiring pop vocal group must confront.\n\n49. The Knack - “My Sharona”\n\nDate: Aug. 25, 1979\n\nWeeks on top: 6\n\n“My Sharona” wasn’t the world’s first power-pop song. But it might as well have been. The song’s big drums and guitar sound drew you in before hooking you in with its energy and melody. At its core “My Sharona” is a great pop song that, as “Reality Bites” proved, you can’t resist the urge to dance to it no matter where you are\n\n48. Diana Ross - “Love Hangover”\n\nDate: May 29, 1976\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nThroughout the 1970s, producers would try to reinvent Diana Ross. Hal Davis took his turn on 1976′s “Love Hangover.” The song finds Ross essentially doing a Donna Summer impression driven by Ross’ sensual vocal stylings. The first half of the song is disco lite before breaking out into a full-on dance tune. The catchiness of the groove sticks throughout.\n\n47. Sly & The Family Stone - “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)”\n\nDate: Feb. 14, 1970\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nReleased alongside “Everybody Is a Star,” “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)” is a song that feels burdensome if you pay attention to the lyrics. But it was hard to since the song was so deliciously funky. Not surprisingly, it became a dance anthem for its groove along with Larry Graham pioneering the slapping bass technique.\n\n46. Roberta Flack - “Killing Me Softly with His Song”\n\nDate: Feb. 25, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 5\n\nIn September 1972, Roberta Flack opened at the Greek Theatre for Marvin Gaye. The latter insisted Flack perform an encore after her set. The song she chose was a cover of a Lori Lieberman song titled “Killing Me Softly with His Song” Flack had yet to record. She performed it and Gaye told her “Don’t ever do that song again live until you record it.” Gaye knew Flack had something special on her hands. But few could have anticipated how special. Not only did Flack’s version of “Killing Me Softly with His Song” stay at No. 1 for five weeks, but it also went on to win the Grammy Awards for Song and Record of the Year.\n\n45. Stevie Wonder - “I Wish”\n\nDate: Jan. 22, 1977\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\n“I Wish” starts with a relatable feeling. The song finds Stevie Wonder reminiscing about his childhood and how he wishes he could go back and do it all again. We’ve all been there. But Wonder framed everything with his genius. The arrangement on “I Wish,” a hybrid of funk and pop, is thrilling, topped off with a killer hook. Wonder’s musicality was at an all-time high “Songs In the Key of Life.” No artist was on his level.\n\n44. Earth, Wind & Fire - “Shining Star”\n\nDate: May 24, 1975\n\nWeeks on top: 1\n\nThe opening track from Earth, Wind & Fire’s “Shining Star” lasts less than three minutes. But it smacks you right in the face with just how invigorating it is. “Shining Star” is packed with funk guitars, amazing percussion, a barrage of brass and woodwind instruments and one of the catchiest hooks Earth, Wind & Fire ever crafted.\n\n43. Donna Summer - “Hot Stuff”\n\nDate: June 2, 1979\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\n“Hot Stuff” is not Donna Summer’s best song. It might not even be in the top five. And there have been some awkward moments in pop culture history that involve it. And yet, it’s the song where it’s most clear how awesome a star Summer was. Her performance on “Hot Stuff” oozes sex appeal. It’s raw and rocking. A lot of Summer’s success can be tied to Giorgio Moroder’s production. But on “Hot Stuff,” she’s the one overshadowing him.\n\n42. The Jackson 5 – “ABC”\n\nDate: April 25, 1970\n\nWeeks on top: 2\n\nIf “ABC” sounds a lot like its predecessor “I Want You Back,” that was the intention. Gordy wanted to make sure he had another smash on his hands for the young group. Mission accomplished in no small part to a young Michael Jackson continuing to come into his own with a series of ad-libs that blows everything else about “ABC” out of the water. The heir apparent to James Brown had arrived.\n\n41. Bill Withers - “Lean on Me”\n\nDate: July 8, 1972\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nAfter moving to Los Angeles to pursue his music career, Bill Withers sat at a piano longing for his days in West Virginia surrounded by friends and family. That was the inspiration for “Lean on Me,” one of the most universal, uplifting anthems ever put to record. “Lean on Me” has been covered so many times (often in cheesy fashion), that the thought of it is enough to make you cringe. But listening to Withers’ original takes you back to the heartfelt feeling of a guy who just missed having a friend.\n\n40. Carly Simon - “You’re So Vain”\n\nDate: Jan. 6, 1973\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nCarly Simon’s “You’re So Vain” is the ultimate takedown of the guy no woman should date. And it still feels fresh today, which is why it’s been covered by artists like Taylor Swift. That might not have been the case if it had remained in its original form as a folk song. But producer Richard Perry pumped some serious rock and roll into it (including Mick Jagger singing backup). And as a singer, Simon never lets the narrator seem like the guy she is writing about is getting under her skin. It’s was a showcase of serious swagger.\n\n39. Edwin Starr - “War”\n\nDate: Aug. 29, 1970\n\nWeeks on top: 3\n\nEdwin Starr’s “War” is the kind of anti-war anthem you crave during harsh times. It smacks you right in the mouth and lends itself to fed-up chants at protests (which is what happened). Starr also knew how to be a showman, coming from the James Brown school of enterta"
