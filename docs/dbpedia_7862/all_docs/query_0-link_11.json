        "text": "John and his tour band had dropped in at the Encore Studio, Burbank, in May this year, to cut an album of train-song collection by request of Sony/Wonder Records, the label wellknown for its family products. The album, a fine collection of classic and contemporary train songs, titled \"All Aboard!\" and released almost exactly 3 months after it had been recorded, on August 26.\n\nThough it contains none of John's own composition, it's still enjoyable with various styles of music, especially country music. The remarkable tracks are \"Waiting for A Train\" for that old yodel, \"People Get Ready\" for its poignant sentiments and \"Lining Track\" for its beautiful a capera. But, what impress us most is track 15 \"Jesse Dreamed of Trains\", in which JD changed the words to dedicate it to little Jesse Belle. It really fits well on the closing of this family album.\n\nJohn sings \"The City Of New Orleans\" for the first time since he recorded it in 1972 for \"Aerie\" album. You may notice the lylics on the \"All Aboard!\" version is slightly different from this \"Aerie\" version. As a matter of fact, \"City Of New Orleans\" was written by the songwriter Steve Goodman in 1971, and covered by JD the following year. When he covered the song, John changed some of Goodman's original lylics and added new verse. In an interview later years, he said he didn't content with the result. So, he brought back the original lylics and sings as it was written on this new rendition.\n\nThe band is same as recent JD concerts except Herb Pedersen, Denny Brooks and Elizabeth Lamers on background vocals, who are from the JD band in the good old 80s. They're really doing a fantastic job!\n\nHere's John's comments on this album:\n\n\"Both the history of our country and our musical history is in train songs. From how we settled the West, to bluegrass and to the hollars the chain gangs did when they were laying down tracks. On top of all that there is the longing that we all have to get out there and see the world. There is something about a train whistle when you hear it. You think that it's going somewhere that you'd kind of like to go. You could jump on a train and have an adventure.\"\n\n\"As I got into this album. I saw the opportunity to do some things I wouldn't ordinarliy do musically. I could stretch out a little bit. Most of the songs I've ecorded over all these years have been songs I've written myself. This is the first time I've really done a project that uses other people's music. To find the songs that work for you and then to make them your own has been a lot of fun for me.\"\n\n\"The whole idea of train songs is such a rich thing to me that I wanted to make sure it was for the whole family. But then, it's certainly true that I think of all of my albums as family music albums. I've always made sure to include songs that are for everybody.\"\n\nIt is a pitty that John's brandnew composition for this new album called \"The Song Of The West\" was not completed before he went into studio. He had been very busy touring etc. and didn't have enough time. However, the album is still great and enjoyable, even without his own composition. And as he said his albums were always for the whole family, I hope this last one would reach out for every family around the world."
