        "text": "John Denver re-recorded many of his songs for release on his 1973 Greatest Hits album and I was wondering if other artists or bands have done this and why? In Denver's case I think he thought his voice had improved with confidence and experience and he thought he could improve the original songs as well as add more production and backing instruments and not have a stripped down of versions as the originals. Am I right her John Denver fans? I would also think an artist with their heyday in the 1940s or 1950s might want to re-record their hits to get higher sound quality, and/or more modern production, and/or true stereo versions of their hits. Thoughts?\n\nGordon Lightfoot re-recorded all the songs for Gord’s Gold that had originally been released on his United Artists albums. That was a rights thing, since UA obviously wouldn’t allow recordings they owned to be put out on a Warner compilation, but Gord has actually said he prefers the re-recorded versions, anyway, because he didn’t like how some of his UA records came out (I don’t always agree, but the re-recordings on that release do all sound good).\n\nSocial Distortion re-recorded several of their songs for their Greatest Hits album, again because of rights between labels, but they bothered to make the re-recordings very close to the originals (you can tell, if you listen close).\n\nYes, he liked the re-recorded results on Gord’s Gold so much he wanted to take that same approach on a volume 2. The results this time, though, were largely cheesy ‘80s-sounding remakes of songs that sounded perfect in their original forms. It’s actually too bad, because the collection of songs would have been nice to have on an LP in sequence, but in their original recorded versions.\n\nI think that the original United Artist recordings sound better than the re-recordings.\n\nI think Johnny Cash did a couple times, for Columbia and then for Mercury.\n\nCarl Perkins may have as well for Columbia and a couple others.\n\nIt was mentioned above, but some of the re-recordings Little Richard did for Vee-Jay are rumored to have Jimi Hendrix on guitar.\n\nThere are examples on which I feel very strongly this is the case. The way some of the songs are paired together is a fun enough listen, and is how he plays them live (I assume that was already the case at the time?), but letting each song stand on its own is also nice. And “Canadian Railroad Trilogy” is actually changed, with one of the sections being slowed down quite a bit in tempo; I much prefer it at the faster tempo.\n\nI can go either way on “Song for a Winter’s Night”. Both versions are great, depending on my own mood at the time.\n\nI just don’t like the slowed-down second section as much. And the orchestration is a bit much at times. It feels like a Disney-produced version of the song, somehow.\n\nDon’t get me wrong — I listen to Gord’s Gold all the time, and I enjoy this track. I just like the original better.\n\nI agree! I understand that it was more than likely for money and a way to have some of Cash's classic songs on the Mercury label, and I think Jack Clement was involved with the re-recordings, but they didn't really work. I'll listen to them (I think the collection was called Classic Hits or something?) once in a while, and they just don't have that feel that they should."
