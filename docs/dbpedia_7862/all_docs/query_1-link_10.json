        "text": "This month in the Local 303 we're spotlighting local musicians as well as celebrating new music from established Colorado acts.\n\nApril welcomes DIY mainstays American Culture, who have been performing and releasing music since 2014. We are also excited to share the first single from Iceland-based, former Coloradoan John Grant ahead of his highly anticipated fifth album Boy From Michigan that includes songs about growing up in Michigan and also life in Colorado.\n\nDenver's Rubedo signed to a label from Mexico City called Amatista and we will hear songs from the first of four parts of their upcoming album being released throughout the year. The Mañanas recently put out their debut that has influences of 60's mellow rock and indie Latin alternative.\n\nOther debut albums include records from VALDEZ, which is Nate Valdez, one-half of rock band In the Whale. Connie Hong of Ivory Circle debuts as Fair Elle and folk pop duo LVDY will release their debut this month too.\n\nWe will highlight the music of Felix Ayodele with his electronic project as Felix Fast4ward and more soulful music with his band The New Moons. We will play the latest by Monalicious who also founded Free People Records and Eolian, a musical outlet from Ian O., a Denver artist who's played in bands for over 20 years.\n\nDiscover new music by electro-pop band Video Girl, soul-pop by Zoe Berman, and R&B from SF1.\n\nWhile we can't wait for the day when we can be back in the studio or at a concert, our music scene continues to thrive and we hope you'll fall in love with the Colorado artists we are featuring this month!\n\nMeet some of these bands virtually. The livestream of our next Local 303 Virtual Meetup will be on Apr. 26 at 4 p.m. MT on our homepage or watch from YouTube.\n\nMeet April's picks:\n\nAmerican Culture\n\nHometown: Denver, CO. Originally Chris- Grand Junction, CO, Kim- Denver-CO, Lucas- Lincon, NE, Michael- Long Beach, CA\n\nFormed: 2014\n\nLatest Release: For My Animals, Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records, Feb. 5, 2021\n\nAbout: Nothing is more American than the (flawed) idealism of rugged individualism. But any ruggedness you see in Denver's American Culture (the band) only comes from years of touring, living in a GMC van, lugging that bass cab down another steep DIY basement staircase.\n\nPunk but not rock. This is DIY music. But it isn't alone. It's a culture, a community. One that American Culture and so many of their peers have nurtured, town after town, basement after basement, selling one record at a time not to \"fans\" but to friends. Chris, main songwriter for American Culture considers the band a Trojan horse for his poetry. “Poetry is super awkward and even embarrassing as a live performance. To do it or to see it done. Even just reading it from a page can be cringey. But a cool band is a great way to sneak some poetry to people.”\n\nChris is a veteran to the underground DIY scene. Touring exhaustively since the early 2000s, he’s definitely cut his teeth. Accomplishments include, touring with punk legends The Meat Puppets, playing in a backing band for Daniel Johnson and on American Culture’s first record, guitar hero J Mascis lends a guest lead track. Like their favorites, The Meat Puppets, Crass, The Grateful Dead, The Feelies, AC does whatever they feel. Recorded on 4 track cassette machines and bootleg software in various Denver basements, there's bits of noise-pop, outsider lo-fi, washes of psychedelia and even hints of Jamaican dub influence here. It's definitely punk. Punk but not rock.\n\nAmerican Culture seems to be from different era. A time when people didn't have anything else to do but walk around the mal or smoke cigarettes out back. You made new friends by maybe seeing a Dead Milkmen tattoo peeking out from under a sleeve, or 'Sonic Youth' scrawled in sharpie on the rubber toe of their converse. You didn't know each other, but, also, somehow, you did. Same with American Culture. (Again. The band.)\n\nMusicians That Inspire: I like the 80s-90s punk bands that didn't sound like cookie-cutter punk. Sonic Youth, Meat Puppets, Dinosaur Jr. Also, Crass and the Grateful Dead.\n\nDo you feel like 2020 has shaped you as a musician? If so, how: No. It only slowed us down. But... I've learned to play a kind of fake version of pedal steel and I invented a 12 string electric guitar where the 6 octave strings are attached to a tremolo and the 6 regular strings are not so you get this kind of natural chorus. I'm excited to make new songs with the band with it!\n\nWebsite: Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records, Jigsaw Records\n\nGet Social: Instagram\n\nEolian\n\nHometown: Denver\n\nFormed: Eolian in 2008, playing in Denver since 1992.\n\nLatest Release: Division, Self-Release, Mar. 12, 2021\n\nAbout: A musician, producer, and editor, O'Dougherty has played with Ian Cooke, Discomfort Creature, Slim Cessna's Auto Club, Uphollow, Tauntaun, and others including performances with Fugazi, Nathaniel Rateliff, Blonde Redhead, Colorado Symphony, and more.\n\nMusicians That Inspire: Judee Sill, Peter Gabriel, Fiona Apple\n\nDo you feel like 2020 has shaped you as a musician? If so, how: I've been writing songs and releasing albums since the early 1990s in various bands, but started releasing a song each week in 2019, 52 in all. March 19th 2019 a storm knocked out power for days on my side of the street, while the other side remained with light and access.

I've played shows as Fair Elle for a few years but only sporadically... I've been planning to do something with it for a while, though.\n\nLatest Release: I'm Sorry You Feel That Way, Self-Released, Mar. 26, 2021\n\nAbout: From Denver, Colorado, Connie Hong has set herself apart as a singer and songwriter through her vocal agility in combination with story-driven and heartfelt lyrics, set against a minimalist instrumental background.\n\nIn Fair Elle, Hong utilizes her voice truly as an instrument of its own right, creating ethereal imagery in vocal harmonies and melody lines, in a similar vein to artists such as Kimbra, Regina Spektor, and Rachel Yamagata.\n\nMusicians That Inspire: The Beach Boys, always. And since my parents used to bribe me with Mariah Carey CDs, I can't deny she's an inspiration, as well. I've come in and out of obsession with other musicians/bands but those two seem to remain my constant.\n\nDo you feel like 2020 has shaped you as a musician? If so, how: It definitely has. For how many times I've said that I wished there were more hours in the day to focus on the things I wanted to pursue, such as this solo project, a lockdown during a pandemic will certainly give you that time. For better or for worse, I suppose. I'm thankful that I had an outlet for all that I wanted to express and the resources to accomplish it. To not have the normal distractions and being forced to just stop and be still was a challenge that I'm grateful I was able to take advantage of.\n\nWebsite: fairelle.me\n\nGet Social: Instagram, Facebook\n\nFelix Ayodele aka Felix Fast4ward\n\nHometown: I'm originally from Evanston, Ill & I’ve lived in Denver for almost 2 decades.

His sound along with the New Moons is a blend world music jazz & soul with a unique improvisational approach to the pop song aesthetic.\n\nMusicians That Inspire: First Nina Simone her catalogue is legend; also she has a version of Gilbert O’Sullivan's (Alone Again Naturally) that I've played over and over during lockdown that gives me so much joy even though it’s a sad tune. Of course we have Björk & Ray Charles, , that’s my musical trinity.\n\nDo you feel like 2020 has shaped you as a musician? If so, how: 2020 came with a massive share of both suffering & opportunity. The way 2020 shaped me musically has been freeing up time to focus on developing more foundational components of being a musician all while strengthening my approach to creating. This inner time gave me a clearer answer to why music is so important for me to create.\n\nWebsite: felixmusic.net\n\nGet Social: Instagram, Facebook\n\nJohn Grant\n\nHometown: Was born in Buchanan, Michigan and lived there until 12, then moved to Denver in 1980, spent about 20 years there altogether with a 6-year stint in Germany and 4 years in NYC and over a year in Texas.\n\nFormed: My career as John Grant started in 2008 when I moved from NYC to Denton, Tx to record my first solo record with Midlake.\n\nLatest Release: Boy From Michigan, Bella Union, Jun. 25, 2021\n\nAbout: John Grant arrived at the studio to begin recording his fifth solo record, Boy from Michigan, on 1st March 2020. “So, basically right at the beginning of the pandemic nightmare and all throughout the Presidential campaign,” he says. For Grant, lockdown was largely academic. He is insular by nature and removed himself from his native America in 2011, decamping to Iceland. From afar, the US Presidential race loomed large, though, igniting potent memories of the country which shaped John Grant. 2020’s temporary destabilizing of world order suits Boy from Michigan’s intent just fine.\n\nSomewhere in the last decade, John Grant established himself as one of the great musical chroniclers of the American Dream, angled mostly from its flipside. What if everything you were promised, if you worked hard, loved hard, played and prayed hard, it all turned to ash? “That’s where I was throughout this whole thing,” he notes. “These songs feel visceral to me. You end up marinating in the spirit of that place you grew up in. Some people really thrive in that.” Many don’t. Grant stopped being a boy in Michigan aged twelve, when his family moved to Denver, Colorado, shifting rust to bible belt, a further vantage point to watch collective dreams unravel. “I quickly learned all about the American caste system and where I fit in. Or didn’t,” he says. The repercussions of both remain.\n\nA compulsive over-sharer, Grant lays it all out for careful cross-examination in his most biographical work. In a decade of making records by himself, he has playfully experimented with mood, texture and sound, all the better for actualizing the seriousness of his thoughts. At one end of his musical rainbow, he is the battle-scarred piano-man, at the other, a robust electronic auteur. Boy from Michigan seamlessly marries both.\n\nGrant is the misfit’s misfit: too weird to be mainstream, too mainstream to be weird; too sad to be happy, too sharp not to crack a mordant joke about it. The dolorous ace in his song-writing pack is to gauge impressionistic childhood experiences against their amplified adult consequences. “The American Dream can cause scarring and some nasty bruising,” he sings in the opening, title song of the new record. “The American Dream is not for weak, soft-hearted fools,” it resolves.\n\nBoy from Michigan sets out its stall early in order to fan his lyrical deck wider. The record’s impressive reach builds toward conclusions, where once recriminations and questions lived. Grant knows America well enough to document it in microscopic, painterly detail. The brittle intensity of the early life experiences of a middle-aged man twist stealthily into a broad metaphor for the state of the nation.\n\nA John Grant album always feels like vignettes divined from a tart book of poetry. \"Boy from Michigan\" is the author’s shaggy-dog story, a novelistic approach where songs are more like chapters in a leatherbound book bought from a favourite thrift store. “I guess I’m just thinking about where I came from,” he notes, “and what I went into.”\n\nWith Cate Le Bon in the production chair, Grant has pared back his zingers, maximising the emotional impact of the melodies, stripping the noise of vaudeville and mood-enhancing a fruitful, spare, strangely orchestrated new world for him to live in. A clarinet forms the bedrock of a song. One pre-chorus feels lifted from vintage Human League. There is a saxophone solo. The record swings between ambient and progressive, calm and livid.\n\nGrant first met Le Bon when they performed on the Park Stage at Glastonbury in 2013 and they quickly became friends and fans of each other’s work. She subsequently duetted with Grant at the Royal Albert Hall in 2016 with John returning the favour at Green Man in 2018. They often talked about Cate producing an album for him. “Cate and I are both very strong-willed people, which is excellent”, says Grant. “Making a record is hard on a good day. The mounting stress of the election and the pandemic really started to get to us by late July and August. It was at times a very stressful process under the circumstances, but one which was also full of many incredible and joyful moments.”\n\nWith the frenetic backdrop to its incubation playing out in the distance, the narrative journey of Boy from Michigan opens with Grant returning to his artistic prettiest. It begins with three songs drawn from his pre-Denver life: the title song, \"The Rusty Bull\" and \" County Fair.\" “It’s my Michigan Trilogy,” he says. Each draws the listener in to a specific sense of place, before untangling its significance with a rich cast-list of local characters, often symbolizing the uncultivated faith of childhood.\n\n“The American dream is only about money,” he states baldly. After they initially became friends, Le Bon encouraged Grant to read Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse Five. “He talks about how poor people in the States have been made to feel ashamed of themselves. If you’re not making millions of dollars, it’s because you are not trying, and you don’t love yourself enough. You are a failure as a human being. And it’s fucking perverse.”\n\nTracks four and five, \"Mike and Julie\" and \"The Cruise Room,\" are perhaps the most affecting of the record, plunging deep into Grant’s late teenage years in Denver. In the former, an atypical ambient swell, Grant is confronted by a friend who wants to be with him, a man he brick-walls by purposefully positioning a mutual female friend in between as he cannot yet face his own sexuality. “Mike was the first guy I had sex with. He went to our church and was my best friend for years but I was never once able to talk to him about what happened between us.” In the latter, he revisits the untouched, faded grandeur of the Art Deco bar at Denver’s Oxford Hotel (“just fucking gorgeous”) for one last night as a young man before trying his luck in Germany, to see if Europe is a better fit. Patsy Cline plays on the jukebox. Cassettes are swapped. Promise still exists.\n\nCementing the mid-point of the record are a pair of skittish, scholarly dance tunes, \"Best in Me\" and \"Rhetorical Figure.\" The latter is built in the lineage of his nascent electropop darlings, Devo, suggesting a formative world in which brains are regarded as horny as bodies. “Now, wouldn’t that be a thing?” Dropping the pace, \"Just So You Know\" is the most familiar, John Grant-ian of his songs on the record. It is meant as a song to comfort his nearest and dearest after he’s gone.\n\nChildhood as a horror narrative returns on \"Dandy Star,\" observing the tiny Grant watching the Mia Farrow horror movie See No Evil on the old family TV set in which a blind girl arrives back at her Aunt and Uncle’s home after a date and, after sleeping through the night, awakens in the morning only to discover gradually that everyone has been murdered. Of course the killer comes back to finish the job. The song is a love letter to the girl’s horse, Dandy Star, who blinded and ultimately saved her character. “I was too young to be watching that,” he says, “it was sort of blurry and it terrified me and I never forgot about it. I searched for it for at least 25 years before finally finding it again.”\n\nThese nine songs are the tumescent prologue to his grand climax. The pure smut of \"Your Portfolio\" imagines the US economy rewritten as a throbbing libidinous cock. “It’s where we are now in The States,” he says. “We worship money and any pretence that there’s any worship of anything else going on – like a loving God, for example – is just pathetic. Character doesn’t matter. Intimacy doesn’t matter. Nothing else matters. Wealth is sexualised. It’s a poem in honor of money. The song sounds funny, but I think it’s probably one of the darkest and most serious on the record.” Here lies another Grant signature song-writing move: you’re laughing now but, honey, you’ll be crying by the way home.\n\nIn \"The Only Baby\" (for casual Grant sideliners: Boy From Michigan’s \"Glacier \" moment), he finally removes his razor blade from a pocket to cleanly slit the throat of Trump’s America, authoring a scathing epitaph to an era of acute national exposition. He positions the very soon to be former president as the bastard child of the nation’s virgin mother: “Don’t look so glum/There’s no reason to be sad/Because that’s the only baby that bitch could ever have.” As a final coda, on \"Billy,\" he gets to the causation of all this, a prevalent culture of hyper-machismo, one which fashioned us all for failure.\n\n“These songs are about taking responsibility,” says John Grant. “On every one of my records I talk about a cruel truth of the world, that whatever happens to you in your first eighteen years, if you don’t go out and thrive and succeed, people say ‘What the hell is wrong with you?’ It doesn’t matter what was done to you or how bad it was. You are responsible now for getting over it, having a life and figuring out how to thrive. And of course that’s the only way it can be.”\n\nThe final irony. In his own accidental, skewed manner, John Grant may just have nailed, if not the, then at least an American Dream. Bruised and scarred he may be, but the boy from Michigan is no weak-hearted fool. Success has multiple weighing scales and measurements, not all pecuniary.\n\nMusicians That Inspire: There are too many to count - ABBA, all 70s AOR, Cabaret Voltaire, DEVO, Chris & Cosey, Talk Talk, Cocteau Twins, Dead Can Dance, Eurythmics, The Cure, Skinny Puppy, Ministry, R.E.M., Bauhaus, The Cars, Kate Bush, Throwing Muses, Pet Shop Boys, Visage, Yello.\n\nDo you feel like 2020 has shaped you as a musician? If so, how: I don't feel it has shaped me as a musician. Although I have to say, the 2020 election definitely had an effect on the content of my current album. The pandemic less so, but again, it was because of the pandemic that I was able to spend as much time as I did preparing the new record.\n\nWebsite: https://johngrantmusic.com/\n\nGet Social: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music\n\nLVDY\n\nHometown: Denver, CO (altho Kat grew up in Portland)\n\nFormed: Summer of 2018\n\nLatest Release: \"Gold\" (Single), Self-Released, Mar. 8, 2021 and LVDY (LP), Self-Released, Apr. 16, 2021\n\nAbout: LVDY (pronounced LADY) is a Colorado-based indie-folk duo comprised of Kathleen Hooper and Aubrey Mable. Their uplifting sound and intimate storytelling is a delightful recipe of singer-songwriter, indie-folk, with powerful melodies and harmonies that speak to the senses.

Their dedicated fans, known as the LVDYMOB helped support a successful Kickstarter campaign, allowing them to create their debut album, dropping April 16th, 2021.\n\nMusicians That Inspire: We love Maggie Rogers' authentic ability to share exactly what's on her mind and pull us in with her gorgeous harmonies and unique production. We have fallen in love with the sister trio, Joseph, whose lyrics and building of songs teach us so much as musicians. We're huge fans of Joy Oladokun with her powerful messages and simple, beautiful production.\n\nDo you feel like 2020 has shaped you as a musician? If so, how: While the pandemic separated us, 2020 offered us a chance to slow down. We went from living together to living 7 hours apart, with new parts of our lives taking shape. We finished our debut album virtually and found creative ways to share our music live through \"Front Yard Tours\" and livestreams. New music is flowing, with ongoing inspiration amidst the chaos and massive shifts we've faced as individuals and as a duo. We're eagerly looking forward to the world of live music coming back, as we believe music is medicine. We hope our songs can offer a sense of connection and truth as our world continues to grow and heal.\n\nWebsite: www.lvdymusic.com\n\nGet Social: Spotify, Linktree, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Soundcloud\n\nThe Mañanas\n\nHometown: Denver, CO\n\nFormed: 2019\n\nLatest Release: Cheers, Soundbreaker Records, Feb. 19, 2021\n\nAbout: The Mañanas is an alternative rock project hailing from Denver.

The album includes collaborations with musicians from Denver (Civil Engineer on \"Lucia\") and Ecuador (Nockah & Agustin Rodas on \"Back to U\").\n\nMusicians That Inspire: The Mañanas take inspiration from the mellow classics of the 60's and the current Latin indie scene. We've curated a playlist that includes some of our favorite tunes that inspired us during the making of Cheers. Check out The Mañanas Jams on Spotify.\n\nDo you feel like 2020 has shaped you as a musician? If so, how: We started The Mañanas with our driving focus being live performances. We've had limited opportunities to play live because of the pandemic. However, we don't think we would have had the time or creative energy to finish our new album if it wasn't for all the time we got to spend in Danny's home studio because of the lockdown. Now that we are in the final stages of the pandemic, we have a few Denver shows lined up that we are anxiously anticipating on announcing soon.\n\nWebsite: https://soundbreakerrecords.com/artist/the-mananas/\n\nGet Social: Instagram, Facebook, TikTok\n\nMonalicious\n\nHometown: Denver, CO\n\nFormed: 1995 (or 2009)\n\nLatest Release: A Moment in Time EP, Free People Records, Mar. 29th 2021\n\nAbout: Mona (Monalicious) is a musician and community leader from Denver, CO.

This was also the first year that I started producing more r&b style music, which led to the creation of this album.\n\nWebsite: https://www.monaliciousmedia.com/\n\nGet Social: Instagram, Facebook\n\nRubedo\n\nHometown: Denver, CO\n\nFormed: The year of the Tiger 2010\n\nLatest Release: Antumbra EP, Amatista Records and RARE Records , Apr. 24, 2021\n\nAbout: Call it fate or coincidence but it seems that Rubedo –Gregg Ziemba, Alex Trujillo and Kyle Gray– had to be part of contemporary rock history. The band´s genesis was thunderous and spread immediately among an audience eager for genuineness at the dawn of the new century. The band’s sonic chemistry was inescapable.\n\nLacking pretentiousness from the moment Rubedo stepped onto Denver’s music scene, their presence was felt at home and far beyond, as the band found comradery and support in music communities across the country.\n\nThe band made such an impact beyond their hometown that even the mythical Ikey Owens (The Mars Volta and Jack White) was drawn to the become a part of the formula. Owens acted not only as the producer of Rubedo’s primal 2012 release Massa Confusa and 2013’s Love is the Answer, he became the keyboard player and fourth member. His looming role as the musicians’ advisor figured deeply into the artistic and personal DNA of the band – a feeling perceptible even in 2017’s Vaca, released years after Owens passed away in 2014.\n\nIn 2021, Rubedo enters a new phase with Blood Moon, their most organic work to date. The album unfolds in a clear evolution of sound but at the same time, keeps the band’s essence and creativity. Blood Moon embodies the feeling of an album that has been created gradually. Blood Moon will be released in 4 phases. April 24th will open the first chapter with the Antumbra ep.\n\nRubedo is dynamic -- the band has never sought to be like anyone else or made a conscious effort to belong to any scene; belonging has happened naturally. As a band, the sum of their parts contains complex personalities that come through in their music. Rubedo’s style is rooted in a positivity and a brotherhood. They do not align with any establishment, acting instead as leaders who connect with their audience through deep love and musical ingenuity.\n\nMusicians That Inspire: Our biggest influence when we started was The Mars Volta. They broke up and Ikey Owens found out on twitter when he was recording our 2nd album Love is the Answer with us. Shortly after, he joined Jack White's band; Ikey introduced us to the work of many of the musicians he was playing with and they, in turn, became big inspirations and mentors to us. Dominic Davis (Jack White's bass player) played and composed with us on the single \"Who it Be\" and the track \"Life We Live.\"\n\nWe have also been getting a lot of love and inspiration from Michael McDonald. He and his sister Kathy Walker built a studio for us to record this record in. Kathy Walker and her sister Maureen Ferguson sing back up vox on \"Who it Be\" and \"Get Down,\" and we've been super inspired listening to them singing on Michael McDonald's records. In particular, the song \"I Keep Forgetin' \" which we mainly knew from Warren G sampling it on \"Regulate.\"\n\nDo you feel like 2020 has shaped you as a musician? If so, how: We spent a lot of time recording new music in 2020, so expect a lot of new stuff from us!\n\nWebsite: www.rubedomusic.com\n\nGet Social: Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Spotify\n\nSF1\n\nHometown: Denver, CO\n\nFormed: 2009\n\nLatest Release: \"Games\" (Single), Cornbread Entertainment/Big Top Entertainment via The Orchard a Sony Music Company, Jan. 15, 2021\n\nBio: SF1 is an accomplished emcee, drummer, music producer, songwriter, dancer and actor.

I found streaming performances from my living room and most recently, performing a multi media set live from The Armory Denver, to be alternatives of the normal concert experience we all love, enjoy and truly miss.

If so, how: I, like many artists, have been changed by the 2020 pandemic. Not only having to learn new technology but also learning how to survive the new music landscape.

The last year has been very difficult, but i'm hopeful that we will be at the tail end of this pandemic.\n\nWebsite: https://www.partypooperrecords.com/\n\nGet Social: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, SoundCloud\n\nVideo Girl\n\nHometown: Sarasota, Florida (now based in Denver)\n\nFormed: 2020\n\nLatest Release: Girl EP, Self-Released, Dec. 31, 2020\n\nAbout: Video Girl is a three-piece music project consisting of vocalist/lyricist Emily Gaul, vocalist/producer/audio engineer Bryan Pascarella and producer/audio engineer Zaki Elhajoui.\n\nThe trio first met each other while growing up, in Sarasota, Florida. Pascarella moved out to Denver last year to stay with Gaul and they have lived there together ever since, while Elhajoui is currently still in Florida finishing up his degree. Gaul and Pascarella would record covers of their favorite songs from the comfort of their home studio and would upload their music to SoundCloud. Recording covers then turned into recording original demos, over instrumentals produced by Elhajoui and Pascarella. With some encouragement from Gaul, the collective went onto sending their tracks to various music blogs, websites, and radio stations.\n\nTheir music is a bewitching combination of acoustic and electronic sounds, creating some of the smoothest indie-pop songs in recent memory. Gaul’s and Pascarella’s vocals work incredibly well together, and the production handled by him and Elhajoui is just so catchy. The lyricism invites the listener to remember previous relationships and experiences, pulling them into a unique whirlwind of emotions. Video Girl’s debut EP, “Girl”, is a charming breath of fresh air, and they show no signs of stopping. -Isaac Tellechea\n\nMusicians That Inspire: There are so many artists/songs we pull inspiration from and our interests are constantly changing so I think this one is sort of difficult to answer. All three of us have very different tastes in music and I would like to think that that shows in our tracks. While working on our EP, “Girl”, Emily was listening to a lot of Cocteau Twins and Warpaint and I was really interested in recreating old funk songs and trying to incorporate more interesting synth parts into my production. Zaki and I have always tried to achieve a pretty clean sound in a lot of our previous works but with this project, a lot of the vocal and instrument parts sounded good on the first takes so we went with a more raw sound. At first, I kept trying to clean up the individual parts but Emily really encouraged me to keep more of the original takes and we actually ended up scrapping most of the edits. As far as specific musicians, I’m inspired by artists like Toro y Moi and Reptaliens and the way they record all their music out of their home studios. Some of Zaki’s biggest influences come from artists like Jadu Heart, Arlo Parks, and Carole King. Emily is always showing me new music from different genres but I think she tends to be attracted to artists with a unique vocal approach like The Cure and Velvet Underground. -Bryan Pascarella\n\nDo you feel like 2020 has shaped you as a musician? If so, how: Considering the band formed in 2020 and relies on using online platforms to collaborate remotely, I think we would all agree that 2020 has played a huge part in our music. Working remotely is something that can be very challenging but has also helped us shape our music-making process. We video chat every week to go over ideas and have virtual studio sessions to work through demos and finish tracks. With living in different states (Emily and I in Colorado and Zaki in Florida), it would be impossible to do what we do without these platforms. There are so many musicians and people in general that are forced to work remotely during this time and it’s something that we are very thankful for, but also continues to push us to grow.\n\n-Bryan Pascarella\n\nWebsite: https://videogirl.myportfolio.com\n\nGet Social: Instagram, Spotify, SoundCloud\n\nZoe Berman"
