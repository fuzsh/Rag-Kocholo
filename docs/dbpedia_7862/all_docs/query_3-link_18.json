        "text": "Ever since he hit it big in the early '70s, there have been many people who have nothing good to say about John Denver. It seems that thousands who deeply revere other folk-based singer/songwriters like James Taylor, Cat Stevens, and John Prine have nothing but disdain for Denver. Many refer to his voice as \"whiny and nasal\" (despite the nasal resonance of Taylor and Prine) and his songwriting as maudlin and sentimental. And in some cases, it seems that lots of people disliked him simply because he was so commercially successful (the overall top-selling singer/songwriter of the '70s). Many seemed to have a problem with the positive, upbeat, and life-affirming messages in many of his songs, as if in order to be taken seriously as a songwriter, you had to write about grim or edgy subject matter. Of course it didn't help his credibility when he overexposed himself in the public eye by appearing on so many cheesy TV specials (and saying \"Far out!\" so much did get old after a while), but that can be separated from his music. Since he did sell millions of records and had wildly successful concert tours, I'm sure there are many who agree with me here. I personally find his music to be very calming, uplifting, and spiritually centering. As for his many celebrations of the Rocky Mountains and other wonders of nature, I find that kind of \"Americana\" to be much more appealing that songs by more widely respected writers who focus on songs about how drab, depressing, and impoverished their lives are (while making a good living doing what they love). There were times when some of his albums settled into a certain formula, but there are many gems in his catalog. In addition to the celebrations of the beauty and grandeur of nature, he had quite a few ecologically and socially conscious songs, as well as some edgy sociopolitical statements in song. Even Rolling Stone (generally savaging his catalog in their 1983 Record Guide) referred to his anthemic \"Rocky Mountain High\" as \"a good song that far outshines Denver himself as well as anything else he recorded.\" His standout albums for me are:\n\nPoems, Prayers and Promises - His breakthrough album, stripped down to primarily 2 acoustic guitars and upright bass with occasional subtle embellishments, and ending with the stark and chilling anti-war poem \"The Box.\"\n\nBack Home Again - A country flavored album with strong songwriting and themes of nature, ecology, country living and domestic bliss.\n\nWindsong - His masterpiece, IMO, with 4 hit singles surrounded by 8 outstanding deep cuts. His most nature-affirming and ecologically conscious album with good tempo contrast, inventive melodies, and Lee Holdridge's sweeping orchestral arrangements don't sound syrupy or saccharine at all. They sound like the wide open spaces.\n\nI'm sure there are widely varied opinions on Denver and his music on the forum, but I'm sure I'm not the only rabid fan."
