        "text": "It’s a bit of a shock to revisit the raw emotionality of “Annie’s Song” by John Denver, especially in this plainspoken, stripped-down rendition by Brett Dennen and Milow.\n\nIf that wasn’t enough, Dennen thinks in a really interesting way about the political power of music. “In our world today we need to take every chance we have to empower people to make change,” he writes on his website. “We are hoping touring will provide a model for bridging socially conscious music and people.”\n\nFor his part, the Belgian singer-songwriter Milow is one of Europe’s most successful DIY musicians, known for figuring out creative ways to crack the pop charts while releasing all his material through his own record label, Homerun Records."
