The most popular country artist of the 1970s, and, indeed, one of the greatest in history, he recorded and released some 300 songs, about half composed by himself. He was named Poet Laureate of Colorado in 1977. Songs such as \"Leaving on a Jet Plane\" (1967), \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" (1971), \"Rocky Mountain High\" (1972), \"Sunshine on My Shoulders\" (1973), \"Thank God I'm a Country Boy\" (1974), \"Annie's Song\" (1974), and \"Calypso\" (1975) are popular worldwide. Denver has been referred to as \"The Poet for the Planet\", \"Mother Nature's Son\" (based on The Beatles song he covered) and \"A Song's Best Friend\".\n\nEarly years\n\nDenver was born in Roswell, New Mexico, to Erma Louise Swope and Henry John Deutschendorf, Sr., [ [http://www.wargs.com/other/denver.html WARGS.COM : \"Ancestry of John Denver\" compiled by William Addams Reitwiesner. ] ] an Air Force officer and flight instructor. He was a typical military brat whose family moved around the American Southwest and South while he was growing up. Denver graduated from Arlington Heights High School in Fort Worth, Tx.\n\nDenver was a Christian in his early life, reared Presbyterian, and converted to Lutheranism, but he often said he shared many beliefs with Zen Buddhists and certain Yoga spiritual masters. He also felt he had a connection with the indigenous people of North America. In his memoirs, Denver said that as a child he had had some troubles at home, mostly with his father.\n\nAt the age of 12, John received a 1910 Gibson acoustic jazz guitar from his grandmother, learning to play well enough to perform at local clubs by the time he was in college. He adopted the surname \"Denver\" after the capital of his favorite state, when Randy Sparks suggested that \"Deutschendorf\" \"(\"Germanvillage\")\" wouldn't fit comfortably on a marquee. He dropped out of the School of Engineering (Architecture) at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas in 1964, and moved to Los Angeles, California. Denver sang in the smoky underground folk clubs in Los Angeles, and in 1965 joined the Chad Mitchell Trio, a folk group that had been renamed \"The Mitchell Trio\" prior to the eponymous lead singer's departure and before Denver's arrival and then \"Denver, Boise, and Johnson\" (John Denver, David Boise and Michael Johnson).\n\nIn 1969, Denver abandoned the band life to pursue a solo career, and released his first album for RCA Records, \"Rhymes and Reasons\". It was not a huge hit, but it contained \"Leaving on a Jet Plane\", which had become a number one hit for Peter, Paul and Mary two years prior when Mitchell Trio manager Milt Okun had brought the unrecorded Denver song to the high profile folk group.\n\nAlthough RCA did not actively promote the album with a tour, John himself embarked on an impromptu supporting tour throughout the Midwest, stopping at towns and cities as the fashion took him, offering to play free concerts at local venues. If he were successful in convincing a school, college, American Legion Hall or local coffeehouse to let him play, he would spend a day or so postering the town, and could usually be counted to show up at the local radio station, guitar in hand, offering himself for an interview. With the foot in the door of having authored \"Leaving on a Jet Plane\", he was quite often successful in gaining some valuable promotional airtime, usually featuring one or two songs performed live. Some venues would let him play for the \"door\"; others restricted him to selling copies of the album at intermission and after the show. After several months of this constant low-key touring schedule however, he had sold enough albums to convince RCA to take a chance on extending his recording contract; more importantly however, he had built a sizable and solid fan base, many of whom remained loyal throughout his career.\n\nDenver recorded two more albums in 1970, \"Whose Garden Was This?\" and \"Take Me to Tomorrow\", featuring songs he had composed while driving the roads of the American Midwest. Although these albums were not as successful as those that followed, they would all be certified gold by the RIAA, and would later be considered some of his best work.Fact|date=October 2008\n\nHis first wife, Ann Martell, was from Minnesota, and he immortalized her in one of his biggest hits - \"Annie's Song\" - written, he claimed, in only ten minutes while on a ski lift in 1974. The couple lived in Edina from 1968 to 1971, when they moved to California, although following the success of \"Rocky Mountain High\", John felt it incumbent upon himself to purchase an additional residence in Colorado, and in fact, he owned one or more homes in Colorado, continuously, right up until his death. [ [http://www.midtod.com/98autumn/denver.phtml John Denver: The Baby Boomer's Poet Laureate Of Song] ]\n\nPeak of career\n\nDenver's next album, \"Poems, Prayers and Promises\", released the following year, was a breakthrough for him in America, thanks in part to the single \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\", which went to number two on the Billboard charts. (The first pressings of the track were distorted. Its success was in part due to the efforts of his new manager, future Hollywood producer Jerry Weintraub, who signed Denver in 1970. Weintraub insisted on a re-issue of the track and began a radio-airplay campaign that began in Denver, Colorado.) Denver's career flourished from then on, and he had a series of hits over the next four years. In 1972, Denver scored his first Top Ten album with \"Rocky Mountain High\", with its title track reaching the Top Ten in 1973. In 1974, \"Sunshine on My Shoulders\" and \"Annie's Song\" both went to number one, and \"Back Home Again\" made it to number five. In 1975, he again had two number ones, \"Thank God I'm a Country Boy\" and \"Calypso\" (with \"I'm Sorry\"), and two top twenty hits, \"Fly Away\" and \"Sweet Surrender\".\n\nKey to Denver's success were his many appearances on television. In the pre-MTV era of the 1970s, with his long blond hair, embroidered shirts commonly associated with the American West, affable manner and \"granny\" glasses, Denver became one of the first truly telegenic pop stars. His manager, Jerry Weintraub, insisted on these appearances (including a series of half-hour shows in England, despite Denver's then-protestations that \"I've had no success in Britain... I mean \"none.\" [Source: \"Rocky Mountain Wonderboy,\" James M. Martin, Pinnacle Books 1977.] ) Weintraub explained to Maureen Orth of \"Newsweek\" in December 1976, \"I knew the critics would never go for John. I had to get him to the people.\" Among one of these first appearances was a spot filling in for Johnny Carson on \"The Tonight Show\". During the show, Denver uttered the phrase, \"Far out!\" at least twenty times, thus ensuring the exclamation would become a sort of catchphrase forever associated with his name. After appearing as a guest on many shows, Denver went on to host his own variety/music specials, including several world-televised concerts from Red Rocks Amphitheatre near Denver. His seasonal special, \"Rocky Mountain Christmas\", was watched by over 60 million people, and was the highest rated show for the ABC network at that time. His live concert special, \"An Evening with John Denver\", won the Emmy for Best Variety or Musical Special in the same year.\n\nDenver was also a guest star on \"The Muppet Show\", the beginning of a life-long friendship between Denver and Jim Henson that spawned two television specials with The Muppets. He also tried his hand at acting, starring in the 1977 film \"Oh, God!\" opposite George Burns. Denver hosted the Grammy Awards five times in the 1970s and 1980s, and guest-hosted \"The Tonight Show\" multiple times.\n\nIn 1975, Denver was awarded Country Music Association Entertainer of the Year. At the ceremony, the outgoing Entertainer of the Year Charlie Rich (who himself had a series of crossover hits) was to present the award to his successor. Instead of reading the winner's name, Rich set fire to the envelope with a lighter and announced in tones of disgust, \"my good friend, John Denver!\" Some considered it a statement against country pop and the Music Row-controlled Nashville Sound, and many condemned Rich's action as inappropriate and rude.\n\nIn 1977, Denver co-founded The Hunger Project with Werner Erhard and Robert W. Fuller. He served for many years, and supported the organization until his death. John was also appointed by President Jimmy Carter to serve on the President's Commission on World Hunger, writing the song \"I Want to Live\" as its theme song.\n\nIn 1979, Denver performed \"Rhymes and Reasons\" at the Music for UNICEF Concert. Royalties from the concert performances were donated to UNICEF.\n\nImage and politics\n\nDenver had a distinctive\n\nPolitical activism\n\nDenver became outspoken in politics in the mid-seventies. In 1976, he campaigned for Jimmy Carter, who became a close friend and ally. Denver was a supporter of the Democratic Party, and a number of charitable causes for the environment, the homeless, the poor, the African AIDS crisis, and hunger. He founded the charitable Windstar Foundation in 1976 to promote sustainable living. His dismay at the Chernobyl disaster led to precedent-setting concerts in parts of communist Asia and Europe.\n\nDuring the 1980s, he was a critic of the Reagan Administration's environmental and defense spending policies, advocated unilateral disarmament of the United States, and opposed free-market economics. His outrage at the conservative politics of the 1980s was famously expressed in his autobiographical folk rock ballad \"Let Us Begin (What Are We Making Weapons For)\". Denver was also critical of the Republican-dominated Congress and American Conservatism of the 1990s. He denounced the National Rifle Association (NRA) as a corrupt political machine that could buy off politicians, in an open letter he wrote to the media opposing oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Denver had battled to expand the refuge in the 1980s, and praised President Bill Clinton for his opposition to the proposed drilling. The letter, which he wrote in the midst of the 1996 Presidential election, was one of the last he would ever write.\n\nDespite his many differences with Republican leaders and presidents, Denver was a sought-after guest at state dinners hosted by Richard Nixon and George H.W. Bush. His \"all-American\" image and gentle lyrics of peace and harmony made him a popular entertainer. In 1972, at a Washington, D.C. concert, Nixon and then-Premier of the People's Republic of China Zhou Enlai were members of the audience.Fact|date=October 2007 After the concert, which included Denver's infamous parodies \"The Ballad of Richard Nixon\" and \"The Ballad of Spiro Agnew\", the Premier purchased 500 cassette tapes of the country folk ballad \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\".\n\nJohn Denver was a graduate of Werner Erhard's Erhard Seminars Training and also wrote and dedicated the song \"Looking for Space\" to E.S.T.. This song came from his 1975 album \"Windsong\". It became the theme song for the training organization.\n\nDenver supported space activism and was once slated to go into space. He was on the Board of Governors of the National Space Society for many years.\n\nLater years and humanitarian work\n\nIn later years, Denver had a lower-profile career. He had a few more U.S. Top 30 hits as the 1970s ended, but nothing to match his earlier success. He began to focus more on humanitarian and sustainability causes, focusing extensively on conservation projects and helping to create the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He made public expression of his acquaintances and friendships with ecological-design researchers such as Richard Buckminster Fuller and Amory Lovins, from whom he said he learned much. He also founded his own environmental group, the Windstar Foundation. Denver had a keen interest in the causes of, and solution to, world hunger, and visited Africa during the 1980s to witness first-hand the suffering caused by starvation and to work with African leaders towards solutions.\n\nIn 1983 and 1984 Denver hosted the annual Grammy Awards. In the 1983 finale, Denver was joined on-stage by folk music legend Joan Baez with whom he led an all-star version of \"Blowing in the Wind\" and \"Let The Sunshine In\", joined by such diverse musical icons as Jennifer Warnes, Donna Summer and Rick James. In 1985, John Denver offered to sing on the recording of \"We are the World\", but was turned down. [ VH-1 Pop-Up Video of \"We are the World\".] Also in 1985, Denver was a guest star in the \"Miss Universe\" Pageant\" where he met and fell in love with Miss El Salvador, Julia Mora, with whom he had an short affair while she was in Florida but which ended when she went back to her hometown."
