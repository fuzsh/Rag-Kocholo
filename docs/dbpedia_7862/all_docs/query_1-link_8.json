        "text": "JPF Mentor\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 8,574\n\nI've had some business success. You can read about it on the History page in my website. But what you won't read is what I really consider success.\n\nI've overcome the odds more than once. My mother was a single mother before such a thing was \"cool.\" She raised my brother and I on a dictaphone operator's salary...a woman dictaphone operator. That's like a stenographer, only not as highly paid. She never took any type of welfare, though we were surely elligible. She also took care of my grandma, her mother. Mom died when I was a teenager. I stayed alone in the apartment for a while, then moved in with my brother who was married by then.\n\nThrough college, I worked in a paper products plant, first as a caretaker and later on I operated a tagging machine...made tags, the kind of things you'd find on Minnie Pearl's hat. All the while, I was playing coffeehouses, doing a single act with a guitar and as part of a duo called Mike and Michelle. The duo won a contest and we got on the radio, then split up...a common scene, having some success then the band splits up, Ha. After college I started teaching guitar, banjo, music theory, voice, and conducting the choir at the Old Town School of Folk Music. While doing this, I played a single act in the bars and on any stage I could get myself. I opened shows for folks like John Prine, Steve Goodman, Arlo Guthrie, Odetta, Tom Paxton, the Limelighters, Jethro Burns, and a bunch of folkies. I got to play guitar on a few gigs with Bob Gibson, an old idol of mine.\n\nNot bad for a poor kid, huh? One with no safety net. Maybe that's what I'll call my autobiography...\"No Net.\" Hmmm. Many layers to that, Ha.\n\nAfter a few bands, one of which that got some radio play and good press, I went back to being a single act. They split up after having some success\n\nThe disco era ended gigs for the single act singer/songwriter with a guitar. A chance came along to join a nationally known bluegrass band, Red, White and Blue(grass), that had members like Norman Blake and Vassar Clements (not while I was in it, though, ha.) So I moved to Nashville where I knew a total of three people. When that band split up (right after some success) I ended up homeless, living in my old pup tent. Gigs in Nashville are practically impossible to get, and most of them don't pay. Down to, literally, my last dollar, I walked several miles to find some sort of labor so I could eat that night. Walking down 8th avenue, near where Douglas Corner stands today, I walked by a bar called the Silver Dollar. There was a sign in the window that said \"Beer 35cents\" so I figured that was as good a way as any to spend my last dollar...two beers and a tip. While drinking and shooting the breeze with the bar tender, I looked up over the small kitchen area behind the bar and saw two microphones. \"You got music here?\" I asked her, \"Yeah, and the son of a b***h just quit!\" she said. I worked there four nights a week for almost three years.\n\nSince then I've done a lot here in Nashville. I've never found any conspiracies against me, other than regular old competition. To be competitive, I just tried to outwork everyone. I had to develop an honest survey of my strengths and weaknesses, then try to capitalize on them. I always looked for ways that I could be helpful to folks. That got me a lot of gigs. That and actually loving all the genres and styles of music...all of them. Which, interestingly enough, was a decision. The worst music in the world is much better than silence. Playing the worst gig in the world beats putting up drywall or working in a bank. So, doggone it, I really do love anything that goes do re me, or bang pow boom.\n\nJPF has been tremendously helpful. Participating on the boards has helped me organize my thoughts and ideas, it's also been an outlet for my teaching jones. Brian Austin Whitney has done more for musicians and songwriters than anyone I've known or even anyone of whom I've heard.\n\nThe most success I've had, though, has been my faith and family. I know it doesn't answer your question, but by focusing on God and my family, I've been able to put the business and techniques of music into perspective. They give me reason and meaning. They make my music better. Make a joyful noise.\n\nAnyway, the most success in music has been overcoming. Overcoming fear of failure, overcoming circumstances, overcoming personal weaknesses. It's an ongoing process, but I've come to love it.\n\nYou've got to know your limitations. I don't know what your limitations are. I found out what mine were when I was twelve. I found out that there weren't too many limitations, if I did it my way. -Johnny Cash\n\nIt's only music.\n\n-niteshift\n\nMike Dunbar Music\n\nTop 100 Poster\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 4,001\n\nOriginally Posted by Doug Dude\n\nhow many have had success with what they do?\n\nThere are a number of writers that I have enjoyed over the years, and some even recently, that IMO are decent writers writing what I believe are good, well formed, commercial lyrics.\n\nHow many have had success, commercially? AND how many have been help by the pros that also are a part of the JPF family?\n\nDoug\n\nThat's a bit of a loaded question. As many have said, what is it that really defines success for you? The most successful thing I've done as a musician is learned to roll with changing tastes. It also helps to network and be seen by as many people as you can.\n\nI'm one of those people that used to be on the boards a whole lot. I spent every waking hour online while doing everything else I could. Now I don't get nearly as much time to visit the boards. I only got a moment tonight while I was making dinner after a long day of audio editing.\n\nWhat I've found is that the more people who know you and know if you do good or great work, the more work you get. The music will always do the talking if you let it do it's job.\n\nTo add to my current workload, which includes turning my catalog into a library at the moment, I'm being egged by several friends and colleagues to write a book on the journey of my musical career. I'm already into it with a chapter or so. It's my project to finish while I'm out of Los Angeles for the holiday - then pass it along to a friend who wants to edit and shop it.\n\nMusically, I've been fortunate with winning an award with JPF and being nominated in the awards several years in a row. I think that's a pretty cool thing. I've turned down a major label deal. I've known some of the movers and shakers in both the non-signed and signed worlds. One thing I appreciate is that I'm well respected by my peers. That doesn't come easy.\n\nIn fact nothing in music does when it comes to the business aspect of it.\n\nHow do you define success Doug?\n\nJody Whitesides\n\nA Funky Audio Lap Dance For Your Ears!\n\nwww.jodywhitesides.com\n\nOP\n\nTop 40 Poster\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 6,325\n\nLikes: 4\n\nHi Jody.\n\nI have, in another post, defined my personal succes as follows:\n\nAm I a success? Depends on your definition.\n\nOnce paid a dollar by a drunk women, no not to have sex, but to play a certain song. My first paying gig.\n\nOnce was paid 20$, again by a women??, for a twenty minute set. My second paying gig. (I am a professional!).\n\nOnce won an award, top 100 I�ll have you know, for a song in a song writing contest that I did not think had a chance. (Home recording, kind of simple all around.).\n\nHave made an audience laugh, cry (no not that bad the song was sad) , clap and sing along (on a few occasions).\n\nOnce was called by a Fan (???) that I was not aware that I had (my first stalker) asking why he had heard that I was not going to perform at a local venue,.(Had a run in with the organizer) He told me that he was disappointed and that the only reason he was planning to show up that night was because of me. (I made up with the organizer.).\n\nHave been compared to my all time favorite singer/songwriter John Denver at least three times and every time made me beam.\n\nI have had people come up to me after a show (and out on the streets but for different reasons) and ask about my song. (Were you drunk? Are you now? LOL) and did I have a CD of it? (When I started doing this the question would have been on a cassette but I drift.)\n\nMy wife, my daughter and my sons actually listen to and look for my latest creations. (And this is now when they are older and not staring at me with kiddy eyes. My wife still does but again I drift.).\n\nMy children have some of my recordings on their I pods, (Do you still remember records and cassette players?) have shared them with their friends and generally seem to like them.\n\nMy eldest has started playing the guitar and wants to jamb with me, ON MY RECORDINGS!!\n\nI use to entertain my family and friends with my melodies and wit. (Not anymore. We are that much older now and do not have the time for me to get to the point and they do not always get the jokes anymore).\n\nI wrote and recorded our wedding song. we danced to it and are still married. (Good thing too that song took me weeks to finish.).\n\nI have appeared on TV here in Canada singing a protest song about the government and taxes, that lead to another opportunity later on while un-employed and struggling day to day but because I had a home I was to affluent so was passed over.\n\nWas once told that the reason I was not selected to appear on another television show was because I was to good??????\n\nHave been told on a few occasion (to shut up but again I drift) by professionals and laymen that I had a decent voice. (Whatever that means?).\n\nBut the best example of my success is the story that follows�\n\nYears ago, when I was young and youthful, I was in down town Montreal (not looking for a job but no one really did not know that they believed I was. I was looking at the women, beautiful women down town) and making my way to the building where my father worked.\n\nMy father was a carpenter a finisher by trade (that line describes a character in a song I penned called, Jesse and Kate) and he worked in the same high rise office building most of his working life. He could be on the second floor finishing off an office, then go up to the next floor to do the same and then end up back on the second to re-do after it was torn down what he had done before because that company moved out and another moved in. (I hope you understood that because I am not going to explain it again.)\n\nAnywho. (Where was I?) So I made my way to his building and went up to the fifth floor where I knew he would be. The floor was bigger then I expected and being completely gutted. There were men and equipment everywhere and no father could be seen.\n\nAs luck would have it I arrived on the site around lunch time and in unionized jobs when the lunch bell goes so do the workers. As one the equipment shut down and men started to leave. (But still no daddy!)\n\nThrough the relative quiet a tune drifted through the air, a simple melody that was familiar. �Where had I heard that before?�\n\nIt was one of mine, a tune entitled, Mabel�s, and the whistler was my father. Following the sound I found him. (This is all true.) My father, who I never thought paid any attention to what I did with my music, was whistling to a tune I created.\n\nIf that is not success I do not know what is.\n\nDouglas\n\nSo as you know that it is not always sunny out:\n\nThe first two live performances I participated in, a TALENT NIGHT, I was taken out by people laying on their backs with eyes drawn on their chins, two dots to represent nostrils and their mouths (upside down) but where a mouth would be lip singing!\n\nI have competed with sports on televisions� in a pub, another Talent Night and lost in overtime.\n\nOnce gave a song a brilliant introduction only to forget the melody. Drew a total blank for about three minutes.\n\nBut the worst experience I had:\n\nI did have a whole audience stand up, cross themselves and leave but in my defense the wedding ran longer and the next group was coming in. I would have stayed but then the song I had written would have seemed a little premature since they couple had not even said �I Do� yet and if someone in the audience wanted to protest the union they would have had to interrupt me and that would have been rude.\n\nAH! SUCCESS!\n\nLast edited by Doug Dude; 12:43 AM.\n\n\"Is this a practice?

True success is about life and what you do with it and what you can do for others.\n\nI can't sum up all musical life ,l can give you an idea of it\n\nBreak it down to the top 20 kinda thing and I'll do it in two parts. This way you know where I'm coming from, it has certainly taken it's toll on me.\n\n--------------------------\n\nPART ONE\n\n1. The band I started at age nine gets an audition with other bands for a high school dance, four years later.\n\nWe go and we pass it, and who said music has nothing to do with competition? We play covers all classic Rock!\n\n2. We play the show in 1978 and break an attendance record set earlier by David Johannson (aka Buster Pointdexter) 2,000 people.\n\nThis was perhaps the most satisfying and definitely most pivotal night of my life.\n\nI am now 14 and certain of what I want to do and be.\n\n3. Four years later my left over & new all original band gets working 4 nights a week in the studio, I switch to BASS guitar from lead guitar to help the band. A related contact person helps manage and produce us. At 19 we showcase for Clive Davis in NYC for Arista Records. even after he previously personally edits our song to his liking we get turned down, but they acknowledge me through our manager as someone they may be able to use for another signed act. I smile, bashfully and stay loyal to the band as always. MY exact quote \"See guys what do those suits know, I've only been playing this thing for six months\" Oh and we meet Kool And The Gang there, Cool guys! Euyrthmics were there too but we didn't meet them.\n\n4. We showcase again for Arista and then a few times with MCA Records.\n\nOver the next year or two but we fail to get through...\n\n5. The A&R at MCA Records takes a liking to our latest demo, a song in which I and another band member co-wrote. We set up a major showcase at SIR in Manhattan. She wants to SEE us live before she signs us, We smoke playing live... BUT Our singer blows his voice out the night before practicing. This hurts us really bad, we were so close. We breakup in the following weeks to come. Four years straight,, This was COLLEGE to me. Disappointed but young enough too shrug it off.\n\n6. I start working with a Rap/Rock artist who has a deal with Arthur Baker. I'm the bassist. We do an album, my first! We are set to do a presentation in England and launch He gets into a dispute with label, Atlantic I think, It's OVER. two year process.\n\n7. I start doing songs in my basement on a 4 track cassette porta studio, my best friend and I along with some singers finish a 9 song tape. All types of songs.\n\nI send songs out in brown envelopes to publishers ands record labels I found in the song-writing market book, I did not know what solicitation meant so most got sent back, but one got through to Motown Records. the very first song on the tape.\n\nMotown calls my house - You know this story! The guys is nice and talks to me for 20 minutes, he is deciding right there and then to give it a yes or no. So close he says finally, I can't put my finger on the trouble,,,, But here/s my CODE send more anytime. I never stop working all year but can't get one passed him, he Evan, eventually leaves label and becomes VP at EMI Records.\n\n8. The second song on the tape reaches a club DJ (through the female singer friend)who works with a dance music producer, he likes the singer/my co-writer and wants to record her and the song.\n\nThis song becomes my first RECORD as a songwriter. It gets played on a radio station in Philly and we get a letter saying it's doing well 4th top spot just behind Taylor Dayne... I make a total of $150.00 on this song. I have the check photo copied in my scrap book lol\n\n9. When the producer of the record meets me and finds out I played everything on the demo, he invites me to do some session work with him We hit it off very well.\n\nhe also makes me a staff writer for there independent label.\n\nHis next record has my song on the B side the A side becomes a national hit.\n\nI'm on the other side, So close! lol... I received no royalties,but didn't even care.\n\n10. I start writing in the dance and R&B song world, and start getting the session works as told would be. The first one is Thelma Houston, I'm very nervous as I can't read music and no nothing about session work. It's a breeze the producer says \"Play what you feeL\" I join the union and get paid by Warner Records.\n\n11. Over the next three years roughly we start landing lots of session and re-mix work. Including Gloria Estefan,Celion Dion, Jon Secada and others.\n\nI'm working all day as a doc worker in NJ and then it's to Manhattan at night to the studio. Made a weeks pay recording in one night, just playing bass and some guitar, Sweet! Spent every penny on my home studio equipment lol.\n\n12. Working during the day, writing and recording cool acoustic stuff and rock with my best friend and former original band mate, writing a bit of R&B /DANCE at the label, doing recording sessions every few weeks and making money, Finding out the DREAM is all about WORK!\n\nThe keyboard session player and I hit it off and he likes my playing, he offers me a spot in his band with his wife, he says' he has a deal in the works with Sony Columbia, I refuse him and say another deal sure? then immediately say. Only kidding, I'm in!\n\n13. I'm in session and I get the call we got the deal, I am now with Sony Columbia\n\nand we record our first album. Great experience, I'm very happy about this, I finally made it as a musician as a guitarist. I am the guitarist for this band. Now I succeeded on two instruments lol.. We later do a video, my first and last, 18 hours of work, I get my car towed that day as well, friggin city!\n\nI get offers for endorsements, I don't accept! Ibanez will give me a guitar, \"I say George Benson plays that guitar, I don't deserve it, when I'm a third as good as him I'll take the guitar\" Idiot! LOL Okay I'm on my way now! Alll through this I'm still submitting my songs a bit to the major label we first submitted too. Clive is a very honorable person and keeps his word.\n\nStay tuned for PART TWO..... or maybe not, this may only be interesting to me LOL ya LMK...\n\nThanks!\n\nPeace Mike\n\nSub\n\nMusic & Video's & Photo's\n\nhttp://www.soundclick.com/bands/default.cfm?bandID=482602\n\nDemo/Production & Music Services\n\nhttp://www.substudiomusic.com"
