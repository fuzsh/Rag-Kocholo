In addition to commemorating Denver by naming him the label’s Artist Of The Month, we are supplying The A.V. Club with two—count ’em, two—prize packages stuffed full of a bevy of Denver-related items to give away. Two lucky winners will get: A John Denver beanie (which is frankly quite awesome, it might be the crown jewel of this set); a copy of the limited-edition reissue John Denver And The Muppets: A Christmas Together, with the album cover printed directly on the vinyl itself; and The Essential John Denver, a two-disc set of 36 of the folk singer’s greatest hits.
