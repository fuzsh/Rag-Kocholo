        "text": "At the weekend, young NSW-based country music singer songwriter Jason Owen woke startled to find some strange and certainly hateful and homophobic posts on his Facebook and Twitter feed.\n\n“Satan has your soul. Sad. I stand with the Lord.”\n\n“The Almighty God of Moses judges you.”\n\nIn all this, a Boycott Jason Owen campaign also begin – inexplicable since the Australian is hardly known Stateside – while there were also some grumpy posts from the National Rifle Association.\n\nMystified, Owen contacted his co-manager Nardia Drayton who did some checking and discovered it was a case of mistaken identity.\n\nTheir real target was Jason Owen, the American veteran manager whose Sandbox Management looks after Little Big Town, Faith Hill, Midland and Kacey Musgrave.\n\nOwen, named as one of “40 Under 40: Music’s Top Young Power Players” by Billboard, also co-president Monument Records, a Sony Music label.\n\nLast week, the Country Music Association announced former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee on its board.\n\nThere was an immediate backlash from some members, expressing their disapproval of Huckabee’s appointment given his rightwing, neo-conservative Christian and anti-gay views in office.\n\nThe harshest public condemnation came from the openly gay Owen, who called Huckabee’s appointment “grossly offensive” and “a detrimentally poor choice by CMA and its leaders, and threatened to boycott the association.\n\nWithin 24 hours, Huckabee stepped down, hence the nasty posts.\n\nSome demanded to know why an Aussie should presume to tell the CMA what to do.\n\nFew paused to wonder why an American artist manager and label executive should have out an album of John Denver songs.\n\nDrayton told TMN, “Jason’s wanted to keep out of this whole political situation because he doesn’t like all this hate coming his way.\n\n“We put up a message to tell the message posters they got the wrong person.’\n\n“Some immediately apologised, others went on to check his Denver record online and came back to say they really liked it!”\n\nThe 24-year-old Australian, who grew up near Dubbo, and a keen clay pigeon shooter received national attention when he was runner-up to Samantha Jade in The X Factor in 2012.\n\nIt scored him a record deal with Sony Music, through which he released his debut album Life Is A Highway (April 2013) which debuted at #5 on the ARIA chart.\n\nHe’s now signed with Social Family Records. His most recent album, Jason Owen Sings John Denver stayed in the ARIA Country Charts for seven weeks.\n\nOn its release six months ago, it received the blessings from the family of the late US folk singer who died in a plane crash in 1997.\n\nThere are currently discussions for the Australian performer to go to America and play at the annual John Denver memorial festival.\n\nMeantime the Dubbo Jason Owen (not the US manager, or the similarly named US country performer Jake Owen) hits the road through NSW and a one-night stop in the ACT.\n\nFri 8 Jun | Macksville Ex Services\n\nSat 9 Jun | Grafton Ex Services\n\nSun 10 Jun | Laurieton United Services\n\nFri 15 Jun | Centro CBD, Wollongong\n\nSat 16 Jun | Harmonie German Club, ACT\n\nSat 30 Jun | Art House, Wyong\n\nSat 14 Jul | Orange Ex Services\n\nSat 21 Jul | C.Ex, Coffs Harbour\n\nSat 11 Aug | Dubbo RSL\n\nSat 18 Aug | Lizottes, Newcastle"
