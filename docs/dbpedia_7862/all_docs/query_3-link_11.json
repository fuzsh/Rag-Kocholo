        "text": "(1943–97). With his boyish looks, country-pop singer and songwriter John Denver sailed to commercial success in the mid-1970s singing wholesome songs about his beloved Rocky Mountains and simple country living. His biggest hits, “Take Me Home, Country Roads” (1971), “Rocky Mountain High” (1972), and “Sunshine on My Shoulders” (1974), combined elements of folk, country, and rock to portray Denver’s upbeat view of America.\n\nJohn Denver was born John Henry Deutschendorf, Jr., on December 31, 1943, in Roswell, New Mexico. The son of an Air Force pilot, Denver moved frequently, living in Oklahoma, Arizona, Alabama, and Texas. Denver received his first guitar, a 1910 Gibson, as a gift from his grandmother. He took some lessons and began playing folk songs while still in high school. In 1961 Denver entered Texas Tech as an architecture major and continued to perform at local clubs. Three years later, he dropped out of college and moved to Los Angeles, where he took the stage name John Denver.\n\nOne of Denver’s earliest gigs was in 1965 when he replaced Chad Mitchell in the Chad Mitchell Trio. Denver played with the group on the 1960s hootenanny circuit, recording several albums with them. Rhymes and Reasons (1969) included his classic “Leaving on a Jet Plane”, which became a number-one hit for Peter, Paul and Mary the same year. Several years later, Denver had his own hit with “Take Me Home, Country Roads” (1971). Shortly after moving to Aspen, Colorado, Denver scored another hit with “Rocky Mountain High” (1972), which went platinum. A string of hits followed, including “Annie’s Song” (1974), written for his wife; “Sunshine on My Shoulders” (1974); “Back Home Again” (1974); “Thank God I’m a Country Boy” (1975); and “I’m Sorry” (1975).\n\nRiding a wave of commercial success through the 1970s, Denver started his own record label, Windsong, and appeared in television specials and in films, co-starring with George Burns in the film‘Oh, God! (1977). Among Denver’s 12 gold and four platinum albums, his Greatest Hits (1973) racked up more than 10 million dollars in sales and stayed on the Top 200 for more than three years.\n\nDuring the mid-1970s, Denver also began devoting himself to environmental work, which he continued until his death. In 1976 Denver started his Windstar Foundation, a non-profit educational and research group. He later founded the Hunger Project, worked with UNICEF, and became a board member of the National Space Institute.\n\nAlthough he continued touring and recording throughout the 1980s, Denver’s career never returned to its former heights. In 1981 he released one of his last pop hits, “Perhaps Love”, a duet with opera singer Placido Domingo. Denver’s international tours took him to the Soviet Union, where he performed a benefit concert for victims of the nuclear power plant accident at Chernobyl, and to China and Vietnam.\n\nIn 1993 Denver appeared in the film Walking Thunder, and he published Take Me Home: An Autobiography the following year. Despite several highly publicized drunken-driving incidents, Denver’s career seemed to be on an upswing, due in part to a renewed interest in the music and culture of the 1970s and his selection in 1993 as the first nonclassical musician to receive the Albert Schweitzer Music Award for lifetime humanitarianism. Denver died on October 12, 1997, at age 53, when the single-engine plane he was piloting crashed into Monterey Bay in California."
