        "text": "There were actually 2 covers for the Sony Wonder edition of Platinum. There was the one you posted, and another cover with Big Bird, Cookie Monster and Elmo with headphones and a microphone. I'm still trying to figure out if they were released simultaneously, or if one replaced the other. Then the Koch (which became E1 a few years later) editions took the Sony Wonder covers (of this and a bunch of other albums), and added the sign and green border at the top, and the titles have the same lettering style, so they all have a similar look. This LP just blew up the CD cover so it would match. However, the catalog number is later than the CD edition, because it's been 8 years between them. I look at this as a \"vinyl premiere\" of an album that was only on CD and tape in its first release on Sony Wonder. The Koch was only on CD. A lot of 1990's albums are getting reissued now, and it's fun to see albums with their original artwork blown up to 12\" x 12\".\n\nThis release is also fun because it's pretty much the first Sesame record since Follow That Bird. I say \"pretty much\" because there is some question about whether an educational company in the 1980's called Sight & Sound (which is no longer in business, unfortunately) released an LP of an album called The Best of Sesame Street, which was a brand-new compilation. We know they reissued a lot of the 1974-1984 LP's on cassette, but we found proof that The Best of Sesame Street was the very first ever SS CD, back around 1987. I thought I found an LP listing on worldcat.org, which is a huge library database, but when I went back, the listing had disappeared. So the listing was either a mistake, or the library discarded the item. Either way, I can't wait to get this, even though I already have it on other editions. But hey, I've done the same thing with The Muppet Movie, The Sesame Street Book & Record, and John Denver and the Muppets: A Christmas Together!"
