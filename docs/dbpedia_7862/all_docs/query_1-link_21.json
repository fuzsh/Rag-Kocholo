In 1984, at the age of 15, Lewis auditioned for a children’s musical film called Hi-Tops. While working on the musical soundtrack, Lewis met a member of the rockabilly band The Lifters and was asked to join. Soon after, the band changed its name to Wild Blue Yonder.

Jonell has a voice that can belt like Janis Joplin but also convey the finesse of folk, jazz and Southern soul. She is a true musician’s musician. Her own records have been first-rate, but she has also been summoned to sing backup studio vocals for the likes of B.B. King, Trisha Yearwood, Etta James, Wynona (on the hit “No One Else on Earth”), Rodney Crowell, Vince Gill, Waylon Jennings, Patty Smyth, A.J. Croce and Bruce Cockburn on his popular “Last Night of the World.”\n\nJonell started singing at a young age, rising to do jazz standards in piano bars in her childhood home of Louisville. Her dad, a retired Air Force Master Sargent, had died of a heart attack when she was 3, so she was brought up by her mother, Joy, who loved jazz. She then came to the attention of Bonnie Raitt producer Don Was, after hearing her do demos of Townes’ songs to be pitched to Raitt. Don was so supportive that he soon put a band together with Jonell as lead singer. He rounded up A-listers such as guitarist Mark Goldenberg from Jackson Browne’s band, keyboardist Benmont Tench from Tom Petty’s Heartbreakers, and Beatles drummer Ringo Starr. They recorded 7 songs and were named the New Maroons.\n\nHer second album was “So Like Joy” in 2000, a smart, sophisticated batch of songs that Jonell wrote with John Hall (of Orleans fame) and Johanna Hall. Next up was “Enough Rope,” a 2001 album that Allmusic.com proclaimed had “enough class, muscle and tough grace to stand out from the pack.” Then a lull followed as Jonell turned to raising her sons, before her “powerful “Trust Yourself” CD came out. And perhaps the most intriguing project she’s been involved with in is being one of the Freedom Singers, who perform under the auspices of the First Amendment Center headed by former USA Today editor Ken Paulson.\n\nShe has sung with Mavis Staples, Levon Helm, Sam Moore, Bruce Cockburn, Waylon Jennings and Kris Kristofferson.

Songwriter Craig Bickhardt contributed the song “Crazy Nightingale”. Bickhardt had previously performed with Sylvia from 1984, and wrote the title cut to One Step Closer. Also in 2002, Sylvia released, A Cradle in Bethlehem, her first Christmas album.\n\nIn 2016, the album, It’s All in the Family, was released on Red Pony Records.\n\nIn 2018, Sylvia released, Second Bloom: The Hits Re-Imagined, an album of some of her hits she re-recorded with a more acoustic yet fully produced approach.\n\nIn 2022, Sylvia’s newest album, Nature Child — A Dreamer’s Journey, was released on February 22, 2022. Nature Child represents “a full circle moment for me,” the Nashville-based singer/songwriter shares. Playful as well as thought-provoking, this generation-spanning concept album (released 2/22/22 on her own Red Pony Records) inspires listeners of all ages to follow their dreams.\n\nNature Child is filled with a dozen enchanting story-songs. Tracks like the richly atmospheric “Avalon,” the lilting “Dancing Over An Emerald Isle,” and the joyous “If I Only Had Wings” convey three main album themes: “don’t be afraid to dream,” “imagination sets you free,” and “you are loved for who you are.” On stellar songs such as the title track and “My Best Friend,” Sylvia touches upon other themes that address the importance of remembering our innate connection with the earth and the qualities of being a true friend.\n\nWorking with her longtime co-producer/collaborator John Mock (Dixie Chicks, James Taylor, Dolly Parton), Sylvia blended rootsy country touches with elements of Celtic folk music (from traditional to modern artists like Enya), timeless lullabies, and film soundtracks like The Lord of the Rings. American Songbook standards were another touchstone, with Harry Nilsson’s A Little Touch of Schmilsson In The Night being a particular influence. Sylvia loved how Nilsson’s performance was earnest yet playful, and how well arranged the songs were – all qualities that imbue Nature Child’s own smartly executed arrangements.\n\nwww.sylviamusic.com\n\nThat same year, as a part of her nonprofit Groovetrail, she launched the Flathead Ellington Project, an all-star jazz ensemble of high school students from the Flathead area of Montana where she was residing at the time. Along with three dedicated local band directors and a slew of excited parents and supporters, Erica trained the band and on the music of the great Duke Ellington, providing them with opportunities to perform for the community, be showcased on Montana Public Radio, collaborate with students from Jazz at Lincoln Center, and be mentored by guest artists DeWitt Fleming Jr. and Summer Camargo. The project culminated in the students taking a trip to New York to perform at theNational Jazz Museum in Harlem. This program was the largest educational endeavor Erica has ever led, and was a massive and heartfelt undertaking. Sadly, the program did not repeat again the next year as the pandemic began to take hold.\n\nIn January of 2023 Erica relocated back to NYC with an opportunity to teach business at the Manhattan School of Music. Backed with seven years of experience running her own for profit and non profit companies in Montana, Erica developed a curriculum aimed at providing basic financial and entrepreneurial literacy to budding music professionals. Her concept has now snowballed into a web series launching soon on Patreon entitled“The Business of the Music Business”, with new videos dropping regularly.\n\nCOMEDY\n\nIn 2018 during the #metoo movement Erica began to reminisce and dive into her memories as the often sole woman on and off the bandstand and realized that one of the many reasons for her burnout was because she was a victim of, as many women are, the patriarchy. She figured she had two choices. Either write an epic rant on Facebook, thus risking looking like a crazy person and burning bridges OR write some music. She decided she’d start with writing some tunes because, what the hell! She wrote her first funny tune “You’re the Man”,a little ditty about a mansplaining incident where the gentleman underestimated her knowledge of John Coltrane. Her songwriting snowballed into more hilarious insane numbers such as “You’re Becoming a Woman but Let’s Not Talk About It” and “Another Day, Another Nipple”, a witty waltz about breastfeeding.\n\nHer knack for comedic songwriting then became an obsession, an extension of her creative path, and she now tours with her own one-woman show “BOOBS! with Erica von Kleist”. This 90-minute escapade of estrogen features all her original songs, with Erica on piano and ukulele, singing her jazzy little heart out while making people lose their shit laughing. Seriously folks, it’s really funny.\n\nThere’s more! Erica thought that it wasn’t enough to have a comedy show. She also wrote a musical entitled “Sorry” that debuted at Alpine Theatre Project in October 2021.\n\nThis new talent and obsession of hers quickly became the talk of the small town of Whitefish, MT where she was still living at the time. She began to team up with several writers and editors on collaborative projects, including co-penning the hit(?) musical comedy film Your Musical Is Cancelled. The Musical!with David Blair, Mikey Winn and Adam Pitman. Featuring an almost all-Broadway cast and orchestra (orchestrations by Erica) the film went on to win Best Comedy at the Toronto Alt Film Festival, Best Feature at the SoCal Film Awards, and premiered at the New York Independent Film Festival in June of 2021. It was the little pandemic project that could!\n\nThe success of the film was inspiring for our quaint mountain town, and the tourism bureau invited the team to pen an original music video encouraging tourists to not be jerks and please wear a mask. You can watch it here.\n\nSo yeah, the comedy thing is the real deal for miss Erica. And yes, she’s a teacher too, which is why you see a whole education portion on this website, so click if you want to learn more about that. She’s written a bookand has a web series and stuff so you totally should.\n\nwww.ericavonkleist.com"
