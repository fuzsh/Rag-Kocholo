        "text": "Randy Sparks was right. ”Henry John Deutschendorf, Jr.” likely wouldn’t have commanded attention on a marquee. “John Denver” would – and did. The beloved troubadour, who perished in 1997 at just 53, took the advice of the New Christy Minstrels’ leader. Choosing a new name from his favorite state, which he would immortalize numerous times in song, Denver went on to a career encompassing seven multi-platinum, thirteen platinum and 20 gold albums. During that sadly-curtailed career, he also penned some of the most beloved and indelible works in the canon of American song: “Leaving on a Jet Plane,” “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” “Rocky Mountain High.” On November 4, RCA Records and Legacy Recordings will celebrate the enduring music of John Denver on a new 4-CD career spanning anthology, All of My Memories: The John Denver Collection.\n\nAll of My Memories chronicles the two-time Grammy Award winner’s career from 1964 to 1997 over the course of 90 songs recorded between 1964 and 1997 by Denver solo, as member of The Chad Mitchell Trio, and with duet partners including Emmylou Harris, Olivia Newton-John, Placido Domingo, Sylvie Vartan, The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and that inimitable song stylist, Miss Piggy! With his boyish good looks, gentle voice and enthusiasm for music and nature, Denver was one of the preeminent pop voices of the 1970s, incorporating folk and country influences into his popular material. He charted more than 40 Billboard Hot 100, AC and Country songs from 1971 to 1988, and this box set features a number of them alongside key album tracks, live performances, and rarities including promotional-only and privately-pressed tracks. In addition, six songs make their first appearances anywhere on this set:\n\nCover versions of \"The Road\" and \"Far Side Of The Hill,\" both demos recorded for Capitol Records in Hollywood, 1964, prior to Denver’s tenure with the Mitchell Trio;\n\n“Rhymes And Reasons,\" an original composition cut in early '69 for Reprise Records, re-recorded as the title track of Denver's RCA debut later that year;\n\n\"Spirit,\" first recorded on 1975’s Windsong LP, as recorded live at the Sydney Opera House in 1977, but not included on the 1999 concert album release;\n\nAn alternate take of \"Eli's Song\" from 1976 with a lyric described by the record label as “prophetic”: \"See the airplane fly, see the trees rush by/ Be brave and strong when you hurt yourself/ Don't you have a worry in the world…\"; and\n\nAn alternate version of the vintage tune \"It's A Sin to Tell a Lie” from 1973. Denver’s mother’s favorite song, he famously performed it on Johnny Carson’s Tonight Show one year earlier.\n\nMany of Denver’s own compositions are, naturally, featured alongside tracks composed by Bill Danoff and Taffy Nivert (who co-wrote \"Take Me Home, Country Roads” and \"I Guess He'd Rather Be In Colorado\"), Buddy Holly (\"Everyday\"), John Prine (\"Blow Up Your TV (Spanish Pipe Dream)\"), Joe Henry, and others.\n\nAfter the jump, we have more details on this set from the onetime Poet Laureate of Colorado, including the complete track listing and pre-order links!\n\nThe box set includes a 32-page booklet with a 2,600-word liner notes essay written by G. Brown, former Denver Post music critic, and now Director at the Colorado Music Hall of Fame. Its first inductee was John Denver, in 2011. All of My Memories arrives in the wake of Legacy’s 2011 release of The Complete RCA Albums Collection box set and last year’s tribute album, The Music is You: A Tribute to John Denver, on the ATO label.\n\nAll of My Memories: The John Denver Collection is due in stores on November 4.
