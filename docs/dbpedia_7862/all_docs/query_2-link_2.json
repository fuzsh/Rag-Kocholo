        "text": "Henry John Deutschendorf, Jr. (December 31, 1943 – October 12, 1997), known professionally as John Denver.\n\nJohn was an American singer, songwriter, actor, activist, and humanitarian. He was one of the most popular acoustic artists of the 1970s and one of the greatest songwriters of the 20th century. After traveling and living in numerous locations while growing up in his military family, Denver began his music career in folk music groups in the late 1960s. His greatest commercial success was as a solo singer, starting in the 1970s. Throughout his life, Denver recorded and released approximately 300 songs, about 200 of which he composed.\n\nHe performed primarily with an acoustic guitar and sang about his joy in nature, his enthusiasm for music, and his relationship trials. Denver’s music appeared on a variety of charts, including country and western, the Billboard Hot 100, and adult contemporary, in all earning him twelve gold and four platinum albums with his signature songs “Take Me Home, Country Roads”, “Annie’s Song”, “Rocky Mountain High”, and “Sunshine on My Shoulders”.\n\nDoris Day and John Denver\n\nDenver further starred in films and several notable television specials in the 1970s and 1980s. In the following decade, he continued to record, but also focused on calling attention to environmental issues, lent his vocal support to space exploration, and testified in front of Congress to protest against censorship in music. He was known for his love of the state of Colorado, which he sang about numerous times. He lived in Aspen, Colorado, for much of his life. He was named Poet Laureate of the state in 1974. The Colorado state legislature also adopted “Rocky Mountain High” as one of its state songs in 2007. Denver was an avid pilot, and died in a single fatality crash of his personal aircraft at the age of 53.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly years\n\nHenry John Deutschendorf, Jr., was born in Roswell, New Mexico, to Erma Louise Swope and Lt. Col. Henry John Deutschendorf, Sr. an Air Force officer (who set three speed records in the B-58 Hustler bomber and earned a place in the Air Force Hall of Fame).\n\nHenry Sr. was of German ancestry, and met and married his “Oklahoma Sweetheart”. Denver’s Irish Catholic and German maternal grandmother was the one who imbued Denver with his love of music. In his autobiography, Take Me Home, Denver described his life as the eldest son of a family shaped by a stern father who could not show his love for his children. He is also the nephew of singer Dave Deutschendorf of The New Christy Minstrels.\n\nBecause Denver’s father was in the military, the family moved often, making it difficult for Denver to make friends and fit in with people of his own age. Constantly being the new kid was agony for the introverted child, and he grew up always feeling as if he should be somewhere else, but never knowing where that “right” place was. While living in Tucson, Arizona, Denver was a member of the Tucson Arizona Boys Chorus for two years.\n\nDenver was happy living in Tucson, but his father was transferred to Montgomery, Alabama, then in the midst of the Montgomery boycotts. The family later moved to Fort Worth, Texas, where Denver graduated from Arlington Heights High School. Attending high school in Fort Worth was a distressing experience for the disenfranchised Denver. In his third year of high school, he borrowed his father’s car and ran away to California to visit family friends and begin his music career. His father flew to California to bring him back, and Denver unhappily returned to finish high school.\n\nAt the age of 11, Denver received an acoustic guitar from his grandmother. He learned to play well enough to perform at local clubs by the time he was in college. He adopted the surname “Denver” after the capital of his favorite state, Colorado. He decided to change his name when Randy Sparks, founder of The New Christy Minstrels, suggested that “Deutschendorf” wouldn’t fit comfortably on a marquee.\n\nDenver studied Architecture at Texas Tech University in Lubbock and sang in a folk-music group called “The Alpine Trio” while pursuing architecture studies. He was also a member of Delta Tau Delta Fraternity. Denver dropped out of the Texas Tech School of Engineering in 1963, and moved to Los Angeles, where he sang in folk clubs. In 1965, Denver joined the Chad Mitchell Trio, a folk group that had been renamed “The Mitchell Trio” prior to Chad Mitchell’s departure and before Denver’s arrival, and then “Denver, Boise, and Johnson” (John Denver, David Boise, and Michael Johnson).\n\nIn 1969, John Denver abandoned the band life to pursue a solo career and released his first album for RCA Records: Rhymes & Reasons. Two years prior, Denver had made a self-produced demo recording of some of the songs he played at his concerts. He included in the demo a song called “Babe I Hate to Go”, later renamed “Leaving on A Jet Plane”. Denver made several copies and gave them out as presents for Christmas. Producer Milt Okun, who produced records for the Mitchell Trio and the high-profile folk group Peter, Paul and Mary, had become Denver’s producer as well. Okun brought the unreleased “Jet Plane” song to Peter, Paul and Mary. Their version of the song hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nAlthough RCA did not actively promote Rhymes & Reasons with a tour, Denver himself embarked on an impromptu supporting tour throughout the Midwest, stopping at towns and cities as the fashion took him, offering to play free concerts at local venues. When he was successful in persuading a school, college, American Legion Hall, or local coffee-house to let him play, he would spend a day or so distributing posters in the town and could usually be counted upon to show up at the local radio station, guitar in hand, offering himself for an interview.[citation needed] With his foot-in-the-door for authoring “Leaving on a Jet Plane”, he was often successful in gaining some valuable promotional airtime, usually featuring one or two songs performed live. Some venues would let him play for the “door”; others restricted him to selling copies of the album at intermission and after the show. After several months of this constant low-key touring schedule, however, he had sold enough albums to persuade RCA to take a chance on extending his recording contract. He had also built a sizable and solid fan base, many of whom remained loyal throughout his career.\n\nDenver recorded two more albums in 1970, Take Me to Tomorrow and Whose Garden Was This, including a mix of songs he had written and cover versions of other artists’ compositions.\n\nCareer peak\n\nHis next album, Poems, Prayers, and Promises (released in 1971), was a breakthrough for him in the U.S., thanks in part to the single “Take Me Home, Country Roads”, which went to number 2 on the Billboard charts despite the first pressings of the track being distorted. Its success was due in part to the efforts of his new manager, future Hollywood producer Jerry Weintraub, who signed Denver in 1970. Weintraub insisted on a re-issue of the track and began a radio-airplay campaign that started in Denver, Colorado. Denver’s career flourished from then on, and he had a series of hits over the next four years. In 1972, Denver scored his first Top Ten album with Rocky Mountain High, with its title track reaching the Top Ten in 1973.\n\nBetween 1974 and 1975, Denver experienced an impressive chart dominance, with a string of four No.1 songs (“Sunshine on My Shoulders”, “Annie’s Song”, “Thank God I’m a Country Boy”, and “I’m Sorry”) and three No.1 albums (John Denver’s Greatest Hits, Back Home Again, and Windsong).\n\nIn the 1970s, Denver’s onstage appearance included long blond hair, embroidered shirts emblazoned with images commonly associated with the American West (created by designer & appliqué artist Anna Zapp), and “granny” glasses. His manager, Jerry Weintraub, insisted on a significant number of television appearances, including a series of half-hour shows in England, despite Denver’s protests at the time, “I’ve had no success in Britain… I mean none.”\n\nWeintraub explained to Maureen Orth of Newsweek in December 1976, “I knew the critics would never go for John. I had to get him to the people.”\n\nAfter appearing as a guest on many shows, Denver went on to host his own variety/music specials, including several concerts from Red Rocks Amphitheatre near Denver. His seasonal special, Rocky Mountain Christmas, was watched by more than 60 million people and was the highest-rated show for the ABC network at that time.[citation needed]\n\nHis live concert special, An Evening with John Denver, won the 1974–1975 Emmy for Outstanding Special, Comedy-Variety or Music. When Denver ended his business relationship because of Weintraub’s focus on other projects, Weintraub threw Denver out of his office and called him a Nazi.\n\nDenver would later tell Arthur Tobier, when the latter transcribed his autobiography,[citation needed] “…I’d bend my principles to support something he wanted of me. And of course every time you bend your principles – whether because you don’t want to worry about it, or because you’re afraid to stand up for fear of what you might lose – you sell your soul to the devil.”\n\nDenver was also a guest star on The Muppet Show, the beginning of the lifelong friendship between Denver and Jim Henson that spawned two television specials with The Muppets.\n\nHe also tried his hand at acting, appearing in the The Colorado Cattle Caper episode of the McCloud television movie on February 24, 1974, and starring in the 1977 film Oh, God! opposite George Burns.\n\nDenver hosted the Grammy Awards five times in the 1970s and 1980s and guest-hosted The Tonight Show on multiple occasions. In 1975, Denver was awarded the Country Music Association’s Entertainer of the Year award.\n\nAt the ceremony, the outgoing Entertainer of the Year Charlie Rich presented the award to his successor, but in protest of what he considered the inappropriateness of Denver’s selection, Rich set fire to the envelope containing the official notification of the award. However, Denver’s music was defended by country singer Kathy Mattea, who told Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly, “A lot of people write him off as lightweight, but he articulated a kind of optimism, and he brought acoustic music to the forefront, bridging folk, pop, and country in a fresh way… People forget how huge he was worldwide.”\n\nIn 1977, Denver cofounded The Hunger Project with Werner Erhard and Robert W. Fuller. He served for many years and supported the organization until his death.\n\nDenver was also appointed by President Jimmy Carter to serve on the President’s Commission on World Hunger, writing the song “I Want to Live” as its theme song. In 1979, Denver performed “Rhymes & Reasons” at the Music for UNICEF Concert. Royalties from the concert performances were donated to UNICEF.\n\nHis father taught him to fly in the mid-1970s, which led to a reconciliation between father and son.\n\nT In 1980, Denver and his father, Lt. Col. “Dutch” Deutschendorf, co-hosted an award winning television special, “The Higher We Fly: the History of Flight”. It won the Osborn Award from the Aviation/Space Writers’ Association, and was honored by the Houston Film Festival.\n\nDenver became outspoken in politics in the mid-1970s. He expressed his ecologic interests in the epic 1975 song “Calypso,” which is an ode to the exploration ship and team of environmental activist Jacques Cousteau. In 1976, he campaigned for Jimmy Carter, who became a close friend and ally. Denver was a supporter of the Democratic Party and of a number of charitable causes for the environmental movement, the homeless, the poor, the hungry, and the African AIDS crisis. He founded the charitable Windstar Foundation in 1976, to promote sustainable living. His dismay at the Chernobyl disaster led to precedent-setting concerts in parts of communist Asia and Europe.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Denver was critical of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Administration, but he remained active in his campaign against hunger, for which Reagan awarded Denver the Presidential World Without Hunger Award in 1985.\n\nLater years and humanitarian work\n\nHe had a few more U.S. Top 30 hits as the 1970s ended, but nothing to match his earlier success. He began to focus more on humanitarian and sustainability causes, focusing extensively on conservation projects. He made public expression of his acquaintances and friendships with ecological-design researchers such as Richard Buckminster Fuller (about whom he wrote and composed “What One Man Can Do”) and Amory Lovins, from whom he said he learned much. He also founded two environmental groups; the Windstar Foundation and Plant-It 2020 (originally Plant-It 2000).\n\nDenver had a keen interest in solutions to world hunger. He visited Africa during the 1980s to witness first-hand the suffering caused by starvation and to work with African leaders toward solutions.\n\nIn 1983 and 1984, Denver hosted the annual Grammy Awards. In the 1983 finale, Denver was joined on stage by folk-music legend Joan Baez with whom he led an all-star version of “Blowin’ in the Wind” and “Let The Sunshine In,” joined by such diverse musical icons as Jennifer Warnes, Donna Summer, and Rick James.\n\nIn 1984, Roone Arledge, president of ABC Sports, asked Denver to compose and sing the theme song for the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. Denver worked as both a performer and a skiing commentator. (Skiing was another avocation of Denver’s.) He had written and composed “The Gold and Beyond,” and he sang it for the Olympic Games athletes, as well as local venues including many schools.\n\nIn 1985, Denver asked to participate in the singing of “We Are the World,” but he was turned down. According to Ken Kragen (who helped to produce the song), the reason Denver was turned down was that many people felt his image would hurt the credibility of the song as a pop-rock anthem. “I didn’t agree” with this assessment, Kragen said, but reluctantly turned Denver down anyway.\n\nFor Earth Day 1990, Denver was the on-camera narrator of a well-received environmental TV program, In Partnership With Earth, with then–EPA Administrator William K. Reilly.\n\nWith Denver’s innate love of flying, he was naturally attracted to NASA and became dedicated to America’s work in outer space. He conscientiously worked to help bring into being the “Citizens in Space” program. Denver received the NASA Public Service Medal, in 1985 for “helping to increase awareness of space exploration by the peoples of the world,” an award usually restricted to spaceflight engineers and designers. Also in 1985, Denver passed NASA’s rigorous physical exam and was in line for a space flight, a finalist for the first citizen’s trip on the Space Shuttle in 1986. But he was not chosen. After the Challenger disaster with teacher Christa McAuliffe aboard, Denver dedicated his song “Flying for Me” to all astronauts, and he continued to support NASA.\n\nDenver testified before the Senate Labor and Commerce Committee on the topic of censorship during a Parents Music Resource Center hearing in 1985. Denver also toured Russia in 1985. His 11 Soviet Union concerts were the first by any American artist in more than 10 years, and they marked a very important cultural exchange that culminated in an agreement to allow other western artists to perform there.\n\nHe returned two years later to perform at a benefit concert for the victims of the Chernobyl disaster. In October 1992, Denver undertook a multiple-city tour of the People’s Republic of China. He also released a greatest-hits CD, “Homegrown,” to raise money for homeless charities.\n\nIn 1994, he published his autobiography, Take Me Home, in which he candidly spoke of his marijuana, LSD, and cocaine use, his marital infidelities, and his history of domestic violence. In 1996, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nIn early 1997, Denver filmed an episode for the Nature series, centering on the natural wonders that inspired many of his best-loved songs. The episode contains his last song, “Yellowstone, Coming Home,” which he composed while rafting along the Colorado River with his son and young daughter.\n\nIn the summer of 1997, Denver recorded a children’s train album for Sony Wonder, titled All Aboard! This was produced by long-time friend Roger Nichols. The album consisted of old-fashioned swing, big band, folk, bluegrass, and gospel styles of music woven into a theme of railroad songs. This album won a posthumous Best Musical Album For Children Grammy for Denver, which was his only Grammy.\n\nPersonal life\n\nDenver’s first marriage was to Annie Martell of St. Peter, Minnesota. Their wedding was held at the Christ Chapel at Gustavus Adolphus College. Annie was the subject of his hit Annie’s Song, which he composed in only ten minutes while on a ski lift in 1974.\n\nThe couple lived in Edina, Minnesota, from 1968 to 1971. Following the success of “Rocky Mountain High”, Denver purchased a residence in Aspen, Colorado and owned one home in Aspen continuously until his death. He and Annie adopted a son, Zachary, and daughter, Anna Kate, who John would say were “meant to be” theirs.[4] John once said, “I’ll tell you the best thing about me. I’m some guy’s dad; I’m some little gal’s dad. When I die, Zachary John and Anna Kate’s father, boy, that’s enough for me to be remembered by. That’s more than enough.” Zachary was the subject of “A Baby Just Like You”, a song that included the line “Merry Christmas, little Zachary” and which he wrote for Frank Sinatra. Denver and Annie Martell divorced in 1982 and the ensuing property settlement caused Denver to become so enraged he nearly choked his ex-wife, then used a chainsaw to cut the marital bed in half. Martell continues to live in Aspen.\n\nDenver married actress Cassandra Delaney in 1988, after a two-year courtship. Settling at Denver’s home in Aspen, the couple had a daughter, Jesse Belle. Denver and Delaney separated in 1991 and divorced in 1993. Of his second marriage, Denver would later recall that “before our short-lived marriage ended in divorce, she managed to make a fool of me from one end of the valley to the other”. In 1993, Denver pleaded guilty to a drunken driving charge, and was placed on probation.\n\nIn August 1994, while still on probation, he was again charged with misdemeanor driving under the influence after crashing his Porsche into a tree in Aspen. Though a jury trial in July 1997 resulted in a hung jury on the second DUI charge, prosecutors later decided to reopen the case, which was closed only after Denver’s accidental death in October 1997. In 1996, the FAA decided that Denver could no longer fly a plane due to medical disqualification for failure to abstain from alcohol, a condition that the FAA had imposed in October 1995 after his prior drunk-driving conviction.\n\nDenver’s talent extended beyond music. He was a painter as well, but because of his limiting schedule, he pursued photography. He once said that “photography is a way to communicate a feeling”. Denver was an avid skier and golfer. His love of flying was secondary only to his love for music. He collected vintage biplanes, and in 1974, he bought a Learjet, which he used to fly himself to concerts. He also bought a Christen Eagle aerobatic plane, two Cessna 210 and in 1997, an experimental, amateur-built Rutan Long-EZ.\n\nOn October 12, 1997, Denver was killed at the age of 53, when his experimental Rutan Long-EZ plane, aircraft registration number N555JD, crashed into the Pacific Ocean near Pacific Grove, California, while making a series of touch-and-go landings at the nearby Monterey Peninsula Airport. The National Transportation Safety Board’s (NTSB) accident ID is LAX98FA008. Denver was the only occupant of the aircraft.\n\nIn 2000, CBS presented the television movie Take Me Home: The John Denver Story loosely based on his memoirs, starring Chad Lowe. The New York Post observed, “An overachiever like John Denver couldn’t have been this boring.”\n\nDenver’s music remains popular around the world. Previously unreleased and unnoticed recordings are now sought-after collectibles in pop, folk and country genres.[citation needed] Also in demand are copies of Denver’s many television appearances, especially his one-hour specials from the 1970s and his six-part series for Britain’s BBC, The John Denver Show. Despite strong interest in these programs, no sign of “official” release is evident for the vast majority of this material.[citation needed] An anthology musical featuring John Denver’s music, Back Home Again: A John Denver Holiday, premiered at the Rubicon Theatre Company in November 2006.\n\nOn March 12, 2007, the Colorado Senate passed a resolution to make Denver’s trademark 1972 hit “Rocky Mountain High” one of the state’s two official state songs, sharing duties with its predecessor, “Where the Columbines Grow”. The resolution passed 50–11 in the House, defeating an objection by Rep. Debbie Stafford (R-Aurora) that the song reflected drug use, most specifically the line, “friends around the campfire and everybody’s high”. Sen. Bob Hagedorn, the Aurora Democrat who sponsored the proposal, defended the song as nothing to do with drugs, but everything to do with sharing with friends the euphoria of experiencing the beauty of Colorado’s mountain vistas. Nancy Todd (D-Aurora) said that “John Denver to me is an icon of what Colorado is\n\nOn September 24, 2007, the California Friends of John Denver and The Windstar Foundation unveiled a bronze plaque near the spot where his plane went down near Pacific Grove. The site had been marked by a driftwood log carved (by Jeffrey Pine of Colorado) with the singer’s name, but fears that the memorial could be washed out to sea sparked the campaign for a more permanent memorial. Initially the Pacific Grove Council denied permission for the memorial, fearing the place would attract ghoulish curiosity from extreme fans. Permission was finally granted in 1999, but the project was put on hold at the request of the singer’s family. Eventually, over 100 friends and family attended the dedication of the plaque, which features a bas-relief of the singer’s face and lines from his song “Windsong”: “So welcome the wind and the wisdom she offers. Follow her summons when she calls again.”\n\nTo mark the 10th anniversary of Denver’s death, his family released a set of previously unreleased recordings of Denver’s 1985 concert performances in the Soviet Union. This two-CD set, John Denver – Live in the USSR, was produced by Denver’s friend Roger Nichols, and released by AAO Music. These digital recordings were made during 11 concerts, and then rediscovered in 2002. Included in this set is a previously unpublished rendition of “Annie’s Song” in Russian. The collection was released November 6, 2007.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, a DVD box set of previously unreleased concerts recorded throughout Denver’s career was released by Eagle Rock Entertainment. Around the World Live is a 5-disc DVD set featuring three complete live performances with full band from Australia in 1977, Japan in 1981, and England in 1986. These are complemented by a solo acoustic performance from Japan in 1984, and performances at Farm Aid from 1985, 1987 and 1990. The final disc has two-hour-long documentaries made by Denver.\n\nOn April 21, 2011, John Denver became the first inductee into the Colorado Music Hall of Fame. A benefit concert was held at Broomfield’s 1stBank Center and hosted by Olivia Newton-John. Other performers participating in the event included Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Lee Ann Womack and John Oates. Both of his ex-wives were in attendance, and the award was presented to his three children.\n\nThe John Denver “Spirit” statue is a 2002 bronze sculpture statue that was financed by Denver’s fans.\n\nHenry John Deutschendorf Jr ( 31 Décembre 1943 – 12 Octobre 1997 ) connu sous le pseudo de JOHN DENVER\n\nJohn Denver (31 décembre 1943 – 12 octobre 1997), né Henry John Deutschendorf, Jr. , est un chanteur américain, également compositeur, musicien et acteur. Il est mort à l’âge de 53 ans près de la côte de Monterey en Californie en pilotant un avion Rutan modèle Long-EZ, un avion expérimental en fibre de verre.\n\nIl est né à Roswell, au Nouveau-Mexique. Son père, Henry Deutschendorf, Sr, était instructeur dans l’Armée de l’air des États-Unis. Denver est né alors que son père était en poste au Roswell Army Air Field. Il a passé son enfance dans diverses bases militaires du Sud-ouest américain. Il fréquente le lycée de Fort Worth dans le Texas, et plus tard inscrit à Texas Tech où il était un membre de la fraternité « Delta Tau Delta ». Son goût pour jouer de la musique est venu à l’âge de douze ans lorsque sa grand-mère lui a donné une guitare acoustique Gibson de 1910. Denver a commencé à se produire dans des clubs locaux ainsi qu’à l’université. Il a laissé tomber l’université en 1964 et s’est déplacé à Los Angeles pour rejoindre le trio Chad Mitchell Trio, un groupe de musique folklorique. En 1966, il écrit la chanson Leaving on a Jet Plane, dont l’enregistrement le plus célèbre provient de Peter, Paul and Mary. Il quitte le groupe connu sous le nom de Denver, Boise et Johnson, en 1969 pour poursuivre une carrière solo. La même année il sort son premier album Rhymes and Reasons, (des rimes et des raisons). Durant les quatre années qui suivent, il sort des albums comme Whose Garden Was This, Take Me to Tomorrow, et Poems, Prayers and Promises et devient une célébrité de la chanson populaire en Amérique.\n\nUne de ses chansons les plus connues Take me home, Country roads enregistrée en 1971 sera reprise en France d’abord par Marie Laforêt sous le titre « Mon pays est ici » puis par Claude François sous le titre « J’ai encore ma maison », et encore quelques années plus tard par Dick Rivers sous le titre « Faire un pont ». Cette même chanson connaîtra également une adaptation en japonais dans le film Si tu tends l’oreille (1995). Elle a pour nom Mimi o sumaseba (耳をすませば) au pays du soleil levant.\n\nCélèbre dans le chant et dans l’écriture de chanson, il connaît une carrière mineure en tant qu’acteur.\n\nSes films les plus connus étant en 1977 Oh, God! avec George Burns.\n\nEn 1994, Denver a écrit son autobiographie intitulée Take Me Home. Il se rend à Aspen dans le Colorado en 1970 suivant son premier succès solo avec la chanson Leaving on a Jet Plane (en partant sur un avion à réaction). Denver est connu non seulement pour ses capacités musicales mais également pour son travail humanitaire.\n\nIl a travaillé intensivement sur des projets humanitaires et a aidé à créer un refuge national en Alaska. Il a également fondé son propre groupe environnemental appelé Windstar Foundation. Denver a montré un vif intérêt pour la lutte contre la famine, et s’est rendu en Afrique au cours des années 1980, œuvrant également avec des chefs africains à la recherche d’une solution.\n\nDéfiant toutes les étiquettes conventionnelles, John Denver a tenu un rôle singulier dans la musique américaine : un compositeur dont le travail immensément populaire s’est répandu avec une parenté profonde et en lien avec les gens. Ses chansons sont restées populaires dans le monde. Elles sont caractérisées par leurs mélodies douces, une guitare élégante et son interprétation soul du lyrique. Il est devenu un des quelques chanteurs occidentaux largement connus dans le monde non-européen comprenant l’Afrique, l’Inde et l’Asie du Sud-Est.\n\nJohn Denver était passionné par deux choses : la musique et l’aviation. Pilote expérimenté, il pilotait ses propres Lear Jet et pratiquait le vol acrobatique. Cependant, c’est cette passion qui a causé sa mort : John Denver s’est abîmé en mer le 12 octobre 1997 aux commandes de son Rutan Long-EZ.\n\n1969 : Rhymes and Reasons\n\n1970 : Take Me To Tomorrow\n\n1970 : Whose Garden Was This?\n\n1971 : Poems, Prayers and Promises\n\n1972 : Aerie\n\n1972 : Rocky Mountain High\n\n1974 : Farewell Andromeda\n\n1974 : John Denver’s Greatest Hits\n\n1974 : Back Home Again\n\n1975 : An Evening With John Denver\n\n1975 : Windsong\n\n1975 : Calypso, un hommage musical à Jacques-Yves Cousteau et à sa cause\n\n1975 : Rocky Mountain Christmas\n\n1976 : Spirit\n\n1977 : John Denver’s Greatest Hits, Volume 2\n\n1977 : I Want To Live\n\n1977 : John Denver\n\n1979 : A Christmas Together\n\n1980 : Autograph\n\n1981 : Some Days Are Diamonds\n\n1982 : Seasons Of The Heart\n\n1982 : Rocky Mountain Holiday\n\n1983 : It’s About Time\n\n1984 : John Denver’s Greatest Hits, Volume 3\n\n1985 : Dreamland Express\n\n1986 : One World\n\n1989 : Higher Ground\n\n1990 : Earth Songs\n\n1990 : The Flower That Shattered The Stone\n\n1990 : A Christmas Together\n\n1990 : Christmas, Like A Lullaby\n\n1991 : Different Directions\n\n1994 : John Denver – Country Roads\n\n1996 : John Denver – Love Again\n\nSOURCE : WIKIPEDIA"
