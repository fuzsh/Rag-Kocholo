        "text": "About\n\n\"Who in their right mind would start a record label these days?\"\n\nAnd the answer is that we’re not just here to make music. We’re here to make a difference.\n\nSanta Barbara Records is a purpose-driven and values-based business, first and foremost. We celebrate everything we love about Santa Barbara and the tremendous power of music to affect mind, body and soul. But more than just releasing great music, we intend to generate meaningful, cultural and economic impact in our community. This model has proven success nationwide by engaging and supporting a wide variety of businesses —recording studios, rehearsal spaces, venues (bars, clubs, hotels and restaurants), festivals, photographers, videographers, graphic designers, printers, makers and purveyors of goods, marketing firms, broadcast media, and more.\n\nWe also walk our talk by signing artists to fair trade deals in which they are partners and collaborators not dependents. We’re particularly proud that our artists represent the diverse influences and inclusive ideals of Americana music while still giving voice to an authentic and original perspective. This music is rooted in that ephemeral magic of central California — Americana music through a Santa Barbara lens.\n\nWhile we’re exporting some of what we love about the Santa Barbara experience through music and goods, we will also offer educational opportunities to artists on better ways of sustaining their own businesses. So, the answer to the question, “Who in their right mind would start a record label these days?” …is “Us!” We invite you to join us. We hope you love what you hear.\n\nDavis is a Denver-based community investor and music aficionado with strong ties to Santa Barbara, where he and his wife have a home. His forty-year professional career, from which he’s mostly retired, has been entirely in the business of healthcare, including commercial banking, ambulatory care management, asset development, strategic advisory services and venture capital. Davis has a long history of community service including serving as a governor-appointed member of the Connect for Health Colorado health exchange board and on the boards of the Telluride Hospital District, Telluride R-1 School District, Telluride Ski and Snowboard Club and the Telluride Foundation. He was also the former mayor of Telluride Mountain Village and a former certified firefighter with the Telluride Volunteer Fire Department. His love of Folk and Americana music along with his desire to make an impact in a community he cares deeply about led to the mission and vision at the heart of Santa Barbara Records.\n\nSanta Barbara native and San Marcos H.S. Alum, Tariqh has worked with some of the biggest names in the music industry. From Leanne Rimes to Josh Groban; from superproducer David Foster to legends such as Bette Midler and Stevie Wonder; to pop stars like Christina Aguilera, Weezer and Huey Lewis and the News among dozens of others, Tariqh has amassed an extensive and eclectic resume. A perpetual student of the art, he is a composer, producer, songwriter, studio musician, educator, musical director, multi-instrumentalist, and international clinician. After briefly studying jazz improvisation at SBCC, Tariqh went on to study Contemporary Classical Composition at UCSD and Professional Music at the Berklee College of Music. Tariqh served as Chairman of the Guitar Department at the LA College of Music for five years where he wrote ten books and continues to be active in speaking engagements, master classes and clinics around the world. In 2011 he returned to Santa Barbara and has since partnered with Teen Star, The Alcazar Theater, KTYD, The Lobero and Kenny Loggins, among others, on initiatives to uplift the local music community. In 2018, in partnership with Lisa Conn Akoni, Tariqh founded Red Wagon Music to develop sustainable business models that benefit both artists and venues alike. In addition to overseeing the artists at Santa Barbara Records, Tariqh continues to serve as Musical Director for Josh Groban."
