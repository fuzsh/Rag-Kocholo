        "text": "NATUREâ€™s John Denver: Let This Be A Voice explores the American West with the late singer and conservationist.\n\nDefying all conventional labels, John Denver held a singular place in American music: a songwriter whose immensely popular work was suffused with a deep and abiding kinship with the natural world.\n\nIn the months just prior to his death in a plane accident in 1997, Denver was filming an episode of the NATURE series, centering on the natural wonders that inspired many of his best-loved songs. The result is a poignant and melodic film that records his final journeys into the wilderness and contains his last song, composed while rafting along the Colorado River with his son and young daughter."
