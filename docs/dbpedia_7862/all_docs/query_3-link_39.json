        "text": "John Denver did not have a valid license to fly when he crashed an experimental plane in California and died on Oct. 12, 1997.\n\nThe singer, songwriter and environmental activist had a history of flying under the influence of alcohol. As a result, his medical certificate – necessary for a pilot’s license - had been revoked in 1996.\n\nBut, he had not been drinking on the day that the Long E-Z kit aircraft crashed.\n\nAccording to a story published in the Los Angeles Times eight months after the accident, the airplane was low on fuel and Denver likely would have had trouble switching from one gas tank to another because of the location of the fuel selector handle.\n\nAccording to the story, the handle is usually located between the pilot’s legs but the builder of the aircraft, Adrian Davis Jr., said he put it behind the pilot’s left shoulder. According to the National Transportation Safety Board report, Denver and a maintenance technician had discussed the inaccessibility of the handle.\n\nDenver had been practicing takeoffs and landings at Monterey Peninsula Airport. He had purchased the plane just two weeks before the crash.\n\nDenver was 53 when he died.\n\nHe dropped out of college in 1964 and in 1965 auditioned for the Chad Mitchell Trio then performed with them until 1968, according to biography.com.\n\nAfter the group Peter, Paul and Mary recorded “Leaving on a Jet Plane,” written by Denver, he began to find success. He changed his name from Deutschendorf to Denver.\n\nIn 1969 he signed a record deal and in two years released four albums.\n\nHis most successful albums, according to biography.com, were “Poems, Prayers and Promises” in 1971 that included the song “Take Me Home Country Roads;” “Rocky Mountain High” in 1972 and “Back Home Again” in 1974.\n\nIn 1977 he appeared in the film “Oh, God!” with George Burns.\n\nAs for his activism, in 1976 he cofounded Windstar Foundation, a wildlife preservation group, and in 1977 he founded the World Hunger Project.\n\nChuck Dauphin wrote this about Denver’s music in 2017 for Billboard: “In the early 1970s, America was beginning to long for a simpler way of life – as evidenced by the success of television series The Waltons and Little House On The Prairie. At the heart of that era from a musical standpoint was the easy-going and gentle sound that Denver personified. Whether it be love songs, nostalgia, or paying tribute to the area where he was from, Denver became one of the biggest-selling acts of his time, dominating Pop, AC, and Country playlists, while also becoming a huge TV and movie star. It goes without saying that many of the compositions in our list of essential John Denver songs come from the 1970s, but a few later recordings show that his music -- and talent -- were timeless pieces of Americana -- before that was a word or a format.”\n\nHis 10 best songs, according to that story, were:\n\n10. “Fly Away”\n\n9. “I’m Sorry”\n\n8. “Don’t Close Your Eyes, Tonight”\n\n7. “Annie’s Song”\n\n6. “Some Days Are Diamonds”\n\n5. “Rocky Mountain High”\n\n4. “Thank God I’m a Country Boy”\n\n3. “Sunshine on My Shoulders”\n\n2. “Take Me Home, Country Roads”\n\n1. “Back Home Again”"
