        "text": "Were you basically very shy?\n\nYeah, I think I was. I don’t know that I’m shy anymore and I’m a lot more secure in myself, but when I was a kid — most 13-year-old kids are shy, whatever act they come on with to make you think they’re not. So then, I moved on to Fort Worth and started high school in exactly the same situation, not really knowing anybody. And through church — more than church itself, I wanted to sing in the choir, but senior high fellowship is where I met a few kids that were going to the same school and then in school my guitar and sports are what made friends for me. I was working after school washing dishes at the McCrory Five and Dime on Camp Bowie Boulevard. My activities were centered around school and football and church and senior high fellowship and I got together with a couple bands and started playing parties, proms, stuff like that. It was the music that really worked for me. It was the thing that I always did that was easy and made me feel good. I liked singing for people.\n\nSince this was the late Fifties, what kind of material were you doing? Who were you listening to? The Kingston Trio?\n\nYes, absolutely. “Tom Dooley” was like in 1959 and all of a sudden folk music was the real big thing. Up to that time — I had an electric guitar that my folks got me and I took lessons in Tucson with a guitar that my grandmother gave me — “This Old Guitar,” that’s a true story. Then I got another electric and a little amp and I would take that to school and play. I would do mostly the ballad songs that were popular and I did a lot of Everly Brothers songs which were never right because I couldn’t sing both parts. Then as a graduation present my folks got me a Fender Jazzmaster and a Fender Pro Amp and I was getting more into folk music. “El Paso” was a big record and I did that. And then all the folk groups, especially the Kingston Trio.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nYou were playing folk music with a Fender?\n\nWell, I was playing the Jazzmaster but I was playing it softly and in the bands that I played with, mostly rock & roll bands, I was the rhythm guitar. I never was much of a lead guitar. I could play some of the stuff…was it the Fendermen or…\n\nOr the Ventures?\n\nThe Ventures. I could do their stuff. And I could play — I used to love to go listen to Jimmy Reed.\n\nI used to see him at Jack’s Place.\n\nAt Jack’s Place! All right! I remember going out to Jack’s Place. I used to sing all Jimmy Reed songs.\n\nThat’s hard to imagine…\n\nIt is hard to imagine me doing that.\n\nRelated"
