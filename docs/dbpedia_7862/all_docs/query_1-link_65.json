        "text": "LISTEN TO EXTRAORDINARY GIRL: HERE\n\n“Ringing guitar chords are backed by atmospheric layers of keyboards, but the true stunner is McDell’s unforced voice, which has already led the Americana artist to gold certifications and award nominations in her native New Zealand.” Rolling Stone on “Extraordinary Girl” (single)\n\nNew Zealand native Jamie McDell has released her third album Extraordinary Girl out worldwide today. Independently released, the record came together between Auckland, NZ and Nashville, TN where she recorded all the tracks with award-winning Australian producer Nash Chambers. It also features a hearty cast of country music legends including Kasey Chambers, Bill Chambers and Tami Neilson.\n\nThis record reflects her deep love of the music from her childhood. It formed the fundamental elements of what inspired her about songwriting the most - honest vocals, raw acoustic guitar and deep storytelling. Being drawn to artists like James Taylor and John Denver in her early years, she booked a trip to Nashville for a change of scenery a few years ago to connect with the environment that birthed the country/folk music of her youth. It was there that she wrote the songs that would make up the fabric of this record. On this work, McDell’s vocals are the most raw and vulnerable they have ever been: powerful, honest and reflect her core listening inspirations which also includes Patty Griffin and Alison Krauss. Putting the overall feeling of the album into words wasn’t easy, but McDell reflects on the personal challenge of leaving the comfort of home to write something that was honest and true. “Nashville was me getting out of my comfort zone and finding my way back to it. The listener is getting a sincerely true collection of stories that haven’t been tampered with since they were written. They are exactly what I felt like saying/singing at the time - raw, unpolished and deeply honest.”\n\n“Showcasing more richness and density than the typical banjo and fiddle exercise, the album contains waves of haunting tremolo guitar (\"Under the Bonnet\"), fuzzy squalls and heavy distortion (\"3AM,\" \"Bad Attitude\"), and a keen sense for crafting rewarding, sometimes even dramatic, vocal melodies.” –All Music\n\nThe singer-songwriter, who is in her mid-twenties, has achieved an enormous amount for someone so young. Being signed to EMI at age 16 sparked the beginning of a successful musical journey, making Jamie McDell a household name across New Zealand. With the release of her debut album Six Strings and a Sailboat, she went on to achieve Gold album sales, receive three NZ Music Award nominations and win Best Pop Album. Her sophomore record Ask Me Anything gained global attention, seeing album track “Moon Shines Red” featured on hit TV show Pretty Little Liars.\n\n“The result of her long journey from home is a stunning, 12-song collection of raw confessionals, breezy anthems and plaintive storytelling rooted in the tradition of old school country and folk balladeers.” –Wide Open Country\n\nEXTRAORDINARY GIRL: STREAM // DOWNLOAD\n\n***For Media Purposes Only***\n\nKEEP UP WITH JAMIE MCDELL:\n\nPR Materials: https://smarturl.it/JamieMcDellPR\n\nhttps://www.jamiemcdell.co.nz/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/JamieMcDellOfficial/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/jamiemcdell\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jamiemcshark/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_KGDZwoTPzt_NlSMX0J5WQ\n\nMegan Nicole, in conjunction with Jeenyus Entertainment, has launched the second episode of her brand new YouTube show Adult(ed), a full guide to being a grown up. Watch the latest episode HERE.\n\nIn this episode, Megan is joined by her sister-in-law Gatlin James and expert MJ Dino, a private chef and event coordinator, to learn how to host a classy dinner party on a budget. Dino guides them through the process of selecting a menu, cooking the food, and setting the ambiance all for under $200. You can also read more of Megan’s key takeaways and tips from this episode HERE.\n\nADULT(ED) EPISODE TWO: WATCH HERE\n\nThis episode is the second in a 10 episode season. The series was inspired by Megan’s whirlwind past year where she felt like she went from adolescence to adulthood overnight. She got married, bought her first home and became a pet parent. These rapid changes left her a little overwhelmed and wishing she had a handbook of sorts, thus, Adult(ed) was born. The feedback on the first episode, “How to Transform A Rental Space,” has been incredible thus far. With this show, Megan is hoping that viewers walk away from the series and the individual episodes feeling informed, positive and confident about living a meaningful adult life.\n\nFAN FEEDBACK ON EPISODE ONE OF ADULT (ED) : “HOW TO TRANSFORM A RENTAL SPACE”\n\n““This is a great idea for a video series. Megan has become a truly sophisticated, beautiful and smart adult...You are Amazing!!! ,”\n\nI’m loving this! So excited about the other episodes.

The raw and vulnerable nature of the track is perfectly complemented by the stunning choreography done solely by Lew. “As soon as I heard this song, I imagined a barrier where it represented the reality of what it’s like when two people aren’t ever on the same page in a relationship...we’re just really glad that we were able to share another story given by two incredibly talented artists,” Lew said.\n\n“The world is loud [and] sometimes you need an excuse to slow down. ‘Fragile’ gives you a peaceful moment alone–so go ahead, hit repeat a few times.” –Idobi Radio\n\nThe LA brother-sister duo said “I think, to a certain extent, everyone is afraid of bringing another person in close, or telling them how they really feel, because the closer someone is, the more they can hurt you. Even with all that, in the end, it’s still worth the risk.” “Fragile” is only the pair’s third single and is hot off the success of their debut “Break” and follow up “Like You.” Their music delicately draws listeners into serious subject matters using the power of a danceable beat. The band’s prior offering “Like You” (now at over 107K views on YouTube) was described by Atwood Magazine as an “unnervingly memorable release, soaked in sunshine while also mired in emotional turmoil.” Upon its release, “Break” was featured on Spotify’s New Music Friday U.S. playlist (now with over 521K plays) and the video has now amassed over 616K views. Ultra Records artist Tep No also produced a remix of the track that he called “one of the best remixes I've made.”\n\nThe two have the brilliant ability to blend elements of both acoustic and electronic elements so seamlessly into their music. They invite you into their cleverly crafted world with lush harmonies, tight melodies and playful brother-sister dynamic. They fine-tuned their sound when the pair’s family relocated to Los Angeles in 2014 from their hometown of Franklin, Tennessee. They’ve spent the past several years honing their craft as songwriters and musicians by forging their wide array of influences together to create a sound uniquely their own. They recently wrote a batch of new left-of-center pop songs that are fun and uplifting in delivery, but still deeply personal and relatable.\n\n“Cooper & Gatlin's latest video is simple but doesn't hold back on aesthetics. The all-too relatable lyrics and intricate acoustic guitar shine.” – Popdust (on “Break”)\n\n“FRAGILE”: WATCH\n\n***For Sharing, Posting, Embedding ***\n\n“WASI is the pop band the world needs right now” - AFFINITY MAGAZINE\n\nLos Angeles band WASI is excited to introduce the world to Riot Pop, a genre ushering in a new movement of empowerment and inclusion with the release of their single “What is Riot Pop?,” from their forthcoming album Riot Pop due out on June 7th.\n\n“Like the rad, queer riot bands before them, this Los Angeles duo, comprised of Merilou Salazar and Jessie Meehan, is about more than just sick beats: it’s about using the emotive intensity of sound to rock the world into a better, more progressive future. “ - CURVE MAGAZINE\n\nSo “What is Riot Pop?” It’s about being true to yourself and trusting your instincts. “It’s being on the edge of an airplane cabin ready to jump,” says Merilou Salazar (WASI co-founder), “being scared as all hell but you jump anyway because in the end life is short and you need to live it to the fullest, then just when you think it’s all over, your parachute opens and you land safely-just like all the risks in life we’ve taken. You trust that parachute just like you trust in yourself and your gut decisions.”\n\n“WASI…...is a pop dream for woke grrrls.” – BUST\n\nWASI’s anthemic songs speak of their experience as outsiders and owning your voice in a cloudy world. The band draws equal influences from the rebellion of the Clash and the pop sensibilities of Tegan & Sara. Not only does WASI write songs about defiance and shaking up the system, but they live it everyday. At the helm of the band are newlyweds and human rights activists Jessie Meehan and Merilou Salazar. The group developed and produce the Women Fuck Shit Up Fest that takes place in Los Angeles, and last year made it’s Washington DC debut, have worked with LGBTQ youth centers around the country and on their upcoming Love is Gay tour, starting in June they will be doing the same, working with LGBTQ centers around the country meeting with kids in each city to talk to them about music, art, and above all spreading a message of pride and acceptance.\n\nThe group's activism reached the national level last year, where they single-handedly got Walgreens to establish a nationwide bathroom discrimination policy. Two years ago, Jessie and Merilou were on their way to the Pride festival in West Hollywood and stopped at the Walgreens on Sunset and Vine. Jessie, who is a woman but tends to dress a bit more masculine asked to use the restroom and the manager on staff refused to open the women's restroom, insisting she use the men’s room. After some humiliating and frustrating back and forth the couple went straight to the ACLU boot at the Pride festival to share their story. Jessie then worked for a year writing letters on the local level, then the state level and the ACLU stepped in when Jessie made her way to the national Walgreens headquarters and together, they got Walgreens, with 8,000 stores in the U.S. to adopt a nationwide policy to address bathroom discrimination. See the video on the ACLU website HERE.\n\n“Growing Up Punk-Rock and Queer in the Suburbs Inspired WASI to Invent “Riot Pop” – LA WEEKLY\n\nRiot Pop album (out June 7): PRIVATE STREAM / DOWNLOAD\n\n***For Media Purposes Only****\n\nOutsider\n\nRun\n\nBall In My Court\n\nMamma’s Gonna Get You\n\nPussy Grabs Back\n\nWhat is Riot Pop\n\nAm I Even Doing it Right\n\nWhatchacallit\n\nVisions\n\nPuzzles\n\nLOVE IS GAY TOUR DATES\n\nw/ Lucy, La Mer, Polartropica\n\nAlternative pop duo Cooper & Gatlin have released their beautifully raw new single “Fragile” out everywhere today.

Even with all that, in the end, it’s still worth the risk.”\n\n“It’s hard to believe that ‘Like You’ is only the second single released by this duo. Most artists take a while to find their sound, but Cooper & Gatlin have got theirs down. They’ve found their voice. “Like You” is an upbeat anthem with a unique sound. The catchy beat, clever lyrics, and smooth vocals make for a perfect addition to all of your playlists.”\n\n–Affinity Magazine (on “Like You”)\n\nTheir previous single “Like You” was inspired by observing a rocky child-parent relationship where the roles were reversed and the child became the parent. Armed with a catchy hook and infectious production from Steve Solomon (who produced the James Arthur hit “Say You Won’t Let Go” which has surpassed 1 Billion streams), they delicately draw the listener into a serious subject matter using the power of a danceable beat. The success of the track and video (now at over 106K views) came hot on the heels of their debut single “Break,” a rhythmic and relatable tune about the stoic face you put on in front of ex- lovers. Upon its release the track was featured on Spotify’s New Music Friday U.S. playlist (now with over 510K plays) and the video has now amassed over 615K views. Ultra Records artist Tep No also produced a remix of the track that he even called “one of the best remixes I've made.”\n\n“Like You” is Cooper & Gatlin’s latest unnervingly memorable release, soaked in sunshine while also mired in emotional turmoil.” –Atwood Magazine (on “Like You”)\n\nThe two have the brilliant ability to blend elements of both acoustic and electronic elements so seamlessly into their music.

It will always be a milestone for frontman Jack Mosbacher’s life who said \"in a few days, we found a new sound, a new attitude and a new chapter in our lives. It’s a song about a woman who is totally in control, from a man’s perspective - she is confident and fearless. As my mother’s son and sister’s brother, I hope that the song is entertaining and fun but also an anthem for empowerment and the unmatchable strength of women.\"\n\nPreviously, they released their incredible debut “(Tell Me) It’s Not Love” followed by “Let’s Talk About You.” Working with producer K-Kov on both tracks (Keith Urban, Justin Timberlake), they managed to create two highly danceable earworms packed with joy and romance. The video for their debut (that has now amassed over 110,000 views), was inspired by the beautiful aesthetic of the classic tale Pride & Prejudice. The track was also added to Spotify’s official Love Pop and Young & Free playlists.\n\n“(Tell Me) It’s Not Love,” [is] an unmistakably radio-ready pop bop. Blending soulful vocals with a dazzling array of modern indie-pop elements, it’s an electric debut destined for major attention. We’re seeing KEZAR in bright lights on famous marquees. We’re hearing his neon anthems on Top 40. We’re thinking he just carved himself a well-deserved spot in the wild world of pop stardom.” –The Music Mermaid\n\nSeasoned musician Jack Mosbacher is the mastermind behind Kezar. He comes from a strong soul background and the more you listen to each cleverly crafted beat, the more you recognize it as the backbone of his newfound signature pop style. Mosbacher also has a deep admiration and respect for the artists that came before him. Using state-of-the-art synthesizer technology, he and the producers added throwback elements from hip-hop’s glory days, like the big 808 drum machines on Run-DMC and NWA records and stacked backing vocals and bass synths reminiscent of the 2000’s Hyphy Movement – homages to Mac Dre, Mistah F.A.B., Keak da Sneak, and Traxamillion.\n\n“The song is the perfect combination of soul and modern pop” –Affinity Magazine (on “Let’s Talk About You”)\n\nWhen choosing a name for this project, Mosbacher wanted to stay true to his hometown of San Francisco by naming it after Kezar Stadium in the Haight-Ashbury district. Choosing the original home of the 49ers and a now music venue that played host to music legends such as Led Zeppelin, Santana and The Grateful Dead, seemed like the perfect segway into a new era of his career while staying true to his roots. While soul will always stay the backbone of Kezar’s music, he also draws inspiration from contemporary pop artists like Shawn Mendes, Bruno Mars and Sam Smith.\n\nPress Materials | https://smarturl.it/KezarPR\n\nTwitter | https://twitter.com/kezarofficial\n\nInstagram | https://www.instagram.com/kezarofficial/\n\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/kezarofficial/\n\nThe Mowgli’s will be releasing a new four song EP American Feelings on March 1st followed by a co-headlining nationwide tour with Jukebox the Ghost.\n\nFrom their beginning as a music collective in Venice Beach, California The Mowgli’s have been writing songs of love, unity and togetherness. Their break out hit “San Francisco” brought them national attention and cemented the band as an indie-rockers with purpose and a message. Two subsequent albums and an independent EP have captured an ever growing fanbase drawn to their feel-good anthems.\n\nAs they’ve grown, the group has balanced their positive music with songs that give a window into the trials of a working band: Juggling relationships, friendships and adulthood with the rigors of constant touring. This was most apparent in their currently highest-streaming single “Kansas City”, released last year. Now presenting their second self-controlled EP American Feelings, The Mowgli’s have, perhaps surprisingly, found greater bonds than ever before: If nothing else, the path is shared and those sharing it have an intimate knowledge of what the journey feels like. “This EP speaks to the youth of America,” says Josh Hogan (guitar/vocals). “Being a person is hard, and we’re all just trying to be people here. American Feelings is a well rounded taste of The Mowgli’s. It’s our best work yet, and we’re extremely proud of it. “\n\nThis theme of connection is woven throughout the EP, starting with the anthemic pop song “Hard to Love” that pays homage to the daunting task of taking a good hard look at yourself in the mirror, owning up to who you are all while dancing your way through it, to the spacey and hypnotic “Mr. Telephone” that examines our culture’s obsession with gadgets and synthetic connectivity. “We are all Mr. Telephone,” says Katie Earl, “seeking answers from a device in the palm of our hands, but after all is said and done, how much more connected are we? How much can we gain from spending time inside our phones, and how much do we lose? There is a lot of love and knowledge and connection outside of our little boxes, and finding a balance is more crucial than ever before.” The EP is rounded out by the laid-back song “Norman Rockwell” that finds its lyrical roots in every youth’s disenfranchised America, and a stomping rocker “Talk About It,” that is about forgiveness and talking your way through difficult situations. “Communication is a very powerful tool,” says Hogan. “If we could learn to communicate in a healthy way, this place would be much less divided.”\n\nThe Mowgli’s - who began as a 10+ member group playing house parties and warehouse gatherings - is now comprised of singer/guitarists Colin Dieden & Josh Hogan, singer Katie Jayne Earl, drummer Andy Warren, keys player David Appelbaum and Matt Di Panni on bass. The release of their first major-label LP Waiting For The Dawn in 2013 saw immediate success with the hit single “San Francisco” and the band quickly found themselves playing to sold out crowds in clubs around the U.S. and inundated by requests for press, sponsorships and partnerships. The band’s music has accumulated 250 Million streams and counting, and they’ve graced the stages of major festivals such as Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, ACL, Firefly, Osheaga, Arroyo Seco, BottleRock, Bumbershoot and more. They’ve worked with major international brands such as Spotify, Abercrombie, Levi’s, GM, Dunkin’ Donuts, VW and Verizon and continue to spread their message of positivity not only through their music but through their work with charities such as Heal The Bay, Happy Bottoms and the International Rescue Committee. The Mowgli’s will be playing songs from American Feelings live this winter on a co-headlining tour with Jukebox the Ghost.\n\nTOUR DATES W/ JUKEBOX THE GHOST\n\nFEB 26 Cat's Cradle Carrboro, NC\n\nFEB 27 Terminal West Atlanta, GA\n\nMAR 1 Granada Theater Dallas, TX\n\nMAR 2 Empire Control Room Austin, TX\n\nMAR 5 Crescent Ballroom Phoenix, AZ\n\nMAR 6 The Fonda Theatre Los Angeles, CA\n\nMAR 7 August Hall San Francisco, CA\n\nMAR 9 Neptune Theatre Seattle, WA\n\nMAR 10 Wonder Ballroom Portland, OR\n\nMAR 12 The Shredder Boise, ID\n\nMAR 13 The Complex Salt Lake City, UT\n\nMAR 16 The Truman Kansas City, MO\n\nMAR 18 Varsity Theater Minneapolis, MN\n\nMAR 19 Turner Hall Ballroom Milwaukee, WI\n\nMAR 20 Metro Chicago, IL\n\nMAR 21 El Club Detroit, MI\n\nMAR 22 Beachland Ballroom Cleveland, OH\n\nMAR 23 Newport Music Hall Columbus, OH\n\nMAR 24 Mr. Smalls Theatre Millvale, PA\n\nMAR 26 The Haunt Ithaca, NY\n\nMAR 27 Brooklyn Steel Brooklyn, NY\n\nMAR 28 Royale Boston, MA\n\nMAR 29 Higher Ground Ballroom South Burlington, VT\n\nMAR 30 The Met Providence, RI\n\nKEEP UP WITH THE MOWGLI’S:\n\nhttp://themowglis.net\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/themowglis/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/themowglis/\n\nPress Materials | http://smarturl.it/TheMowglisPR\n\nLos Angeles brother-sister pop duo Cooper & Gatlin have released a charming rendition of the holiday tune “Wonderful Christmastime.” To go along with it, the two have released a fun video (here) with their friends and family channeling the true spirit of the season. The pair said of the song, “We chose ‘Wonderful Christmastime’ because we wanted to do something other than one of the big Christmas staples. Plus, we both love the Beatles, so we thought doing a song that Paul McCartney wrote would be a lot of fun.”\n\nJust last week, the two also released a remix of their debut single “Break” in collaboration with Ultra Records artist Tep No who called it “one of the best remixes he has ever made.” “Break” is a catchy and relatable tune about the stoic face you put on in front of ex- lovers. It’s an anthem about looking alright before someone who has broken your heart. Upon its release the track was featured on Spotify’s New Music Friday U.S. playlist and the video has amassed over 530,000 plays.\n\n“Cooper & Gatlin's latest video is simple but doesn't hold back on aesthetics. The all-too relatable lyrics and intricate acoustic guitar shine.” – Popdust\n\nThe pair draw you in with their lush harmonies, tight melodies and playful brother-sister dynamic. Originally from Franklin, Tennessee, the family relocated to Los Angeles in 2014 and the two have spent the past several years since honing their craft as songwriters and musicians. By forging their inspirations, the duo recently wrote a batch of new left-of-center pop songs that are fun and uplifting in delivery, but still deeply personal and relatable. This time of year is very special to them as it’s all about spending time with loved ones, making memories, traveling and spreading joy through music. They hope to bring fun, happiness and warmth to everyone’s ears this holiday season with this track.\n\n“Their sound is mature and feels advanced in their years as a duo. Cooper and Gatlin could easily be on the radio and jump into mainstream music.” - Veracious Magazine\n\nKEEP UP WITH COOPER & GATLIN:\n\nPR Materials | http://smarturl.it/CooperGatlinPR\n\nWebsite | https://cooperandgatlin.com\n\nTwitter | https://twitter.com/cooperandgatlin\n\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/CooperandGatlin\n\nInstagram | https://www.instagram.com/cooperandgatlin\n\nYouTube | https://www.youtube.com/cooperandgatlin\n\nThis holiday season, San Francisco-based retro pop and soul singer Jack Mosbacher has released a tender EP of classic Christmas tunes. Titled Christmas in California, this EP features Jack’s soulful, heartwarming take on songs like “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” and “White Christmas.”\n\nWith his own added California sunshine, Mosbacher said of the EP, \"This time of year, I feel particularly grateful for family, friends and music. I hope you will listen to it with the people you love - and that you have as much fun listening to it as I had making it.\"\n\n“His radiant sound has evolved to exude the old school power of Alabama Shakes and Leon Bridges, with the pop sensibility of Andy Grammer and Ed Sheeran. Today, Mr. Mosbacher aims to add happy elements to the next generation of soul.” –Pop Dose\n\nMosbacher is also no stranger to creating an EP of stunning covers. Earlier this summer, he released a phenomenal tribute to David Ruffin called WhyNot (after Ruffin’s hometown of Whynot, Mississippi), which All Access deemed “incredible.” When the opportunity arose, Mosbacher couldn’t resist the chance to honor his late idol’s previously unreleased solo work, and in collaboration with Michael Eisenstein and an eclectic array of musicians, covered four of Ruffin’s songs in a classic Motown session style: all of the instruments in one room, making music until they got it right.\n\nMosbacher’s original music has also become known for its thoughtfully crafted traditional hooks and cheerful Motown vibes. His sound has drawn comparisons to artists like The Temptations, Hall and Oates and even Otis Redding. He revives the best of past eras with warmth and modern charisma for a sound that’s both timeless and extremely accessible. In a world of confusion, chaos and division, he is determined to make music that resonates with everyone on some level. He feels that his highest creative purpose is to share joy with others through his music, channeling the great Motown, blues and soul singers he first listened to as a child. He’s delighted to share this lovely holiday EP with the world in the hopes that it brings genuine joy to anyone who listens, a sentiment he relays in all his music.\n\nMosbacher will also begin a residency at San Francisco’s the Black Cat later next month, a perfect fit for his distinct style of retro pop and just in time for the holidays.\n\nJack Mosbacher @ The Black Cat (Dec. 19-22): INFO HERE\n\n400 Eddy St, San Francisco, CA 94109\n\nKEEP UP WITH JACK:\n\nPR Materials | http://smarturl.it/JackMosbacherPR\n\nWebsite | https://www.jackmosbacher.com\n\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/jackmosbachermusic\n\nInstagram | https://www.instagram.com/jackmosbacher\n\nTwitter | https://www.twitter.com/JackMosbacher\n\nSoundCloud | https://soundcloud.com/jackmosbacher\n\nBrother-sister pop duo Cooper & Gatlin have released a remix of their debut single “Break” done by Ultra Records artist Tep No. \"The song was already amazing,” says Tep No. “I decided to completely change the instrumental to give it a more guitar-oriented feel. I recorded a bunch of guitars for it and it's one of the best remixes I've made, the drop is insane.\"\n\nThe original “Break” is a catchy and relatable tune about the stoic face you put on in front of ex- lovers. It plays with the duality of looking alright before someone who has broken your heart. Upon its release the track was featured on Spotify’s New Music Friday playlist and the video has amassed over 530,000 plays.\n\n“Cooper & Gatlin's latest video is simple but doesn't hold back on aesthetics. The all-too relatable lyrics and intricate acoustic guitar shine.” – Popdust\n\nThe duo likes to describe their sound as acoustic-meets-electronic. Finding inspiration from artists like Broods and Kevin Garrett, they draw you in with their lush harmonies, tight melodies and playful brother-sister dynamic. Originally from Franklin, Tennessee, the family relocated to Los Angeles in 2014 and the two have spent the past several years honing their craft as songwriters and musicians. By forging their inspirations, the duo recently wrote a batch of new left-of-center pop songs that are fun and uplifting in delivery, but still deeply personal and relatable.\n\n“The duo came in fast and hot, bursting onto the pop scene with a woozy neon anthem for the broken-hearted, garnering over half a million views since its release.” –The Music Mermaid\n\nAlthough putting their debut into someone else’s hands was nerve-racking, they couldn’t be happier with the results. “Tep No is amazing and absolutely killed it. We love hearing the melody and lyrics over a new chord progression. Also, the fact that the DJ remix is still guitar-based is a really nice touch. It feels like a completely new song, yet keeps the spirit of the original,” they said.\n\n“Their sound is mature and feels advanced in their years as a duo.

Born of the personal and professional hardships that deeply affected brothers Joshua and Jeremiah Zimmerman a few years ago, the record would also become a harbinger for the current cultural climate. Enemies Multiply is a collection of 11 songs that the band is very proud of and like most incredible works of art, something really beautiful emerged from a very dark place.The timing couldn’t be better to release this album of songs shaped by bewilderment and frustration in 2018.\n\n“Enemies Multiply is not only a step towards their DIY ethos, it’s a mainline into the creative process and family dynamic that both ignited and continues to sustain the band. At the center of it all are two brothers, raised on the Gospel, road worn, complex and relentless. The new album doesn’t put you in the van, but it does connect you to the heart of The Silent Comedy in a way that no album has before.” – No Depression\n\nRecorded in Austin, Texas, Enemies Multiply is a sonically hard-hitting affair. The brothers used the conflicted energy of their personal struggles to create their most engaging album to date. At the center is “Sharks Smell Blood,” that’s all bluesy strut, spooky choirboy harmonies and a sing-along hook. Likewise, “Avalanche” features a searing guitar line and squelching church organ. “No Saints Forgiven,” begins as a back porch delta-blues confessional that quickly explodes into a Van Halen-esque sing-along at the chorus. The songs were shelved at the time for a number of reasons, the main one being that it was too difficult reliving the painful and frustrating time they were written in. But then the 2016 election happened. Joshua was living in New York City and feeling completely disheartened by the country’s new reality. He realized that the feeling of this moment is what they wrote the record for. A certain pall of outrage and desperation had settled over the country and in Joshua’s estimation, the album now had greater cultural resonance.\n\n“The track showcases the band, known for its cathartic sing-along live performances, stomping through a desperate pop-rock anthem with a soaring chorus refrain of \"Help, help is on the way / But not today.\" Five years removed from their last studio effort, 2013's “Friends Divide\" EP, it's good to have 'em back.” – NBC San Diego (on “Avalanche”)\n\nJoshua and Jeremiah Zimmerman formed the Silent Comedy in their adopted hometown of San Diego. The brothers spent their childhood traveling around the world with their missionary parents. The family returned to the U.S. and meandered a bit on the road before settling in San Diego, where they moved into a house with nothing in it but an upright piano. It was then - around junior high - that the brothers started collaborating on songwriting as a form of catharsis. It is their travels that have colored their worldview, which when compared to some of their peers, is decidedly darker. Seeing the immense amount of suffering around the world really shaped their life views and Enemies Multiply is a distillation of this somber perspective.\n\nBeing the band’s third full-length album, it is the culmination of a long, winding journey for them. Joshua Zimmerman says, “Enemies Multiply is a really special album for The Silent Comedy. It’s a collection of our most personal, heartfelt songs to date and it means a lot to us to share it with the world. These songs are anthems for dark days, so this is a perfect time to release them.” Their last full length, Common Faults has gone through three rounds of CD re-pressings due to demand, and has garnered tens of millions of streams and downloads.Their music has also been paired with gritty American tales such as Hatfields & McCoys, starring Kevin Costner, the History Channel’s original series The Men Who Built America, Showtime’s Shameless, and the theme song for the first season of the Amazon show Goliath. The success of the album led to tours of North America, Europe, and the UK, and supporting slots with artists such as The Heavy, ZZ Ward, Ryan Bingham, and Dave Matthews Band to name a few.\n\nThe band will also be celebrating the release of the record with a sold out hometown show in San Diego at The Casbah tonight.\n\nKEEP UP WITH THE SILENT COMEDY:\n\nPhotos, Bio etc. : http://smarturl.it/SilentComedyPR\n\nhttp://www.thesilentcomedy.com/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/_SilentComedy\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/silentcomedymusic\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thesilentcomedy/\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/thesilentcomedy\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/the-silent-comedy\n\nThe Silent Comedy has released the second single “Avalanche” from their upcoming album Enemies Multiply out Oct. 19th. At its core, “Avalanche” is the thesis statement for the entire record. Containing the line “Help, help is on the way...But not today,” it encapsulates brothers Joshua and Jeremiah Zimmerman’s worldview, which is equal parts hopefulness and dark realism. This sentiment is especially timely given the state of the world at this moment in time.\n\nFor the band, this album was born of both professional and personal struggles they found themselves in over the years. Although tumultuous, these conflicts found their way into the recording process and emerged as a beautiful work of art. Enemies Multiply is a collection of 11 songs that was difficult to bring to life, but also a body of work that couldn’t be more relevant with our current cultural climate, to release this album in 2018. The album was delayed for a number of reasons, but things changed after the 2016 election. Feeling bewildered and frustrated, Joshua realized that the feeling of this moment is what they wrote the record for. A certain pall of outrage and desperation had settled over the country and in Joshua’s estimation, the album now had greater cultural resonance.\n\nJoshua and Jeremiah Zimmerman formed the Silent Comedy in their adopted hometown of San Diego.

It is their travels that have colored their worldview, which when compared to some of their peers, is decidedly darker.

At the Disco and most famously, the late Amy Winehouse who recorded a swinging soul version of the song for Mark Ronson’s 2007 record Version. His take on the single is fresh and upbeat but still captures the velvety, soulful essence of the original. He said of the song, “It’s my favorite to sing and perform, and I’m so proud of our Motown-style recording produced by the incomparable Michael Eisenstein.”\n\nHaving previously worked with Eisenstein on his magnificent David Ruffin tribute EP WhyNot (after Ruffin’s hometown of Whynot, Mississippi), “Valerie” seemed like the perfect song to record next.\n\nWhyNot which was released earlier this year, was a way for Mosbacher to pay tribute to one of his biggest heroes growing up. He first began an ongoing love affair with music by listening to the music of The Temptations. Ruffin was forced to abandon a solo record following struggles with addiction and a tussle with Motown Records but thirty years later, an independent label acquired the album and quietly released it. Mosbacher jumped at the chance to honor his late idol’s forgotten work, and in collaboration with Eisenstein and an eclectic array of musicians, he covered four of Ruffin’s previously unreleased songs in a classic Motown session style: all of the instruments in one room, making music until they got it right. Watch an incredible live performance of one of the songs on the EP, “Your Heartaches I Can Surely Heal” HERE.\n\n“He teamed up with Michael Eisenstein (Letters to Cleo, The Posies, Beck etc.) and a team of incredible musicians to breathe new life into these songs. The finished product is incredible.” –All Access Music (on WhyNot)\n\nExuding confidence, modern charisma and soulful warmth on “Valerie,” he considers it his love letter to the late Amy Winehouse whose beautiful light went out far too soon. Mosbacher’s voice revives the best of the past with timeless warmth, contemporary sensibility and authentic joy.\n\nAs with all his original music and tributes, Mosbacher’s respect for the incredible artists that came before him shines through in every note. Passionate, genuine and full of admiration, he is ecstatic to release his rendition of this wildly popular track.\n\nKEEP UP WITH JACK:\n\njackmosbacher.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/jackmosbachermusic/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JackMosbacher\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jackmosbacher/\n\nPress Materials (photos, Bio etc,) http://smarturl.it/JackMosbacherPR\n\nLos Angeles-based artist Miranda Glory is excited to announce the release of her new single “Hypochondriac” out today. The initial inspiration for this track stemmed from hours of endlessly surfing WebMD. She started to see some interesting parallels between the fear of diseases and the anxieties we experience in relationships. During a late night songwriting session with a few close friends, she wrote the lyrics to visually convey these feelings, and laid them over a catchy melody syncopated with beats.\n\n\"Wherever she goes, Miranda Glory makes an impression. Her innate talent and music school pedigree have made her a rising star to watch in the singer/songwriter community.\" –Inspirer Magazine\n\nThis hypnotic new track follows Glory’s previous collaboration “Stain” with Colin Chase and Gill Chang that came out on KnightVision Records earlier this year. Before that, she also collaborated with established European Artist & DJ Tujamo on the single “Body Language” (feat. Miranda Glory & Haris) and with R3HAB & Noah Neiman for the single “We Do (feat. Miranda Glory)” which debuted on 25 of Spotify’s New Music Fridays worldwide in April and has since garnered over 6.8 million plays.\n\n2017 was just as much of a whirlwind for Glory as her career skyrocketed with two debut singles “Blue Eyes (feat. Matty Owens)” and “Take” on iconic New York City-based label Tommy Boy Entertainment. This was also when she signed a worldwide deal with Selected/Sony Music Germany and Ultra Music U.S. for her single “Instant Gratification,” all while co-writing and being featured on RYNX’s single “Want You” that has gained over 9 million plays on Spotify, and has been shared and reposted racking up over 100 million impressions on YouTube & other platforms, alongside the official video.\n\n\"...the writing is some of the best you have heard in months; maybe even years.\" –Indie Shuffle\n\nGrowing up, Glory first fell in love with music by doing musical theater and listening to everything from John Mayer and Coldplay to Michael Jackson and Nirvana. This is where her eclectic pop sound truly began to develop. She started writing her own songs and learned to play guitar, piano and drums. It catapulted her into an ongoing love affair with music, later attending the prestigious Berklee College of Music where she earned her degree. After graduating, she was discovered and selected to the exclusive Neverland Songwriting Retreat in Costa Rica, which put her on the map as a songwriter. After that, she went bicoastal, ferrying back and forth from New York and Los Angeles, writing with established songwriters and producers, including Autumn Rowe (Fifth Harmony, Cher Lloyd), Sheppard Solomon (Enrique Iglesias, Britney Spears), Zac Poor (Tori Kelly, MNEK), David Brook (Eminem, Charlie Puth), The Fliptones (Jason Derulo, Flo Rida) and more.\n\nWorking with such established producers and songwriters helped her to hone her craft and draw inspiration from all different areas of her life. “Hypochondriac” is the perfect example of how Glory can take a spark of an idea and turn it into cleverly crafted lyrics and an infectious, captivating beat.\n\nKEEP UP WITH MIRANDA GLORY\n\nhttp://smarturl.it/MirandaGloryPR\n\nhttps://mirandaglory.com/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/chillranda\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/mirandaglory/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/chillranda/\n\nFilled with smooth, slightly punky angst and raw yet beautifully affective arrangements, it's a must-hear collection for any fan of the style. – Pop Matters\n\nNew York indie pop band The Davenports are excited to announce the release of their new album Don’t Be Mad At Me out everywhere today.\n\nThe Davenports is the longtime project of songwriter and musician Scott Klass. Although Klass is at the helm of the writing and creative process behind The Davenports, he has always looked at the project as a collective. The collective is made up a rotating group of stellar artists creating music with regular appearances by Claudia Chopek (Father John Misty, Springsteen, Moby), Garo Yellin (The Band’s Visit, The Ordinaires, Pere Ubu), Danny Weinkauf, Dan Miller (They Might Be Giants), Erik Philbrook, Rob Draghi and Cheri Leone to name a few. Best known for “Five Steps,” the theme song to A&E’s Emmy-nominated Intervention, Klass has also built a reputation for what Pop Matters calls “gentle compositions and earnest songwriting [that] evoke the inviting, bittersweet charm of artists like Weezer, Andrew McMahon, Ben Folds, Danielson, Loud Family, and Half-Handed Cloud.”\n\nThis record is all about moment-in-time stories that drive through the rocky terrain of human nature. Twists and turns of phrase and melody connect a soundtrack that’s equal parts expansive rock and close melancholy. The first single on the album, “Where Shall We Hang Elena,” was inspired by a photograph of Klass’s mother who passed away when he was young and the sadness that often comes with the desire to honor the memory of a lost loved one but also wanting to forget the pain that comes with it. The album’s title track “Don’t Be Mad at Me” is another story very close to Klass about his father who had to take the car keys away from his mentally ill aunt, even though it was her prized possession.\n\n“Don’t Be Mad At Me” examines this complicated relationship from both sides, and once again, Klass captures it with the same cleverness and intellect he’s come to be known for.” –Magnet Magazine\n\nDon’t Be Mad At Me also marks a series of firsts for Klass. Shirley Simms of The Magnetic Fields handles lead vocals on “Miranda in Her Room,” the first Davenport's song to ever feature a lead vocalist other than Klass. The track ”I Don’t Know What to Do”--marks Klass’s entry into the world of co-writing as he worked on the song with Swedish pop musician David Myhr (The Merrymakers) last year. “Miranda in Her Room,” and “I Don’t Know What to Do” were also collaborations, and in this case long distance international collaborations.\n\nIn addition to the Davenports, Klass is a member of Look Park, the new project from Fountains of Wayne frontman Chris Collingwood which also includes Philip Price of Winterpills. Last year, the trio played Japan’s Fuji Rock festival, opened for Squeeze on their west coast tour, and last spring, Klass and Collingwood supported rock legend Dave Davies of the Kinks.\n\nKEEP UP WITH THE DAVENPORTS\n\nhttps://www.thedavenportsnyc.com\n\nhttps://twitter.com/thedavenports\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/the_davenports\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thedavenportsnyc\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/thedavenportsnyc\n\n“The Dan Sadin EP trembles and aches, like aftershocks of an altogether damaging, merciless earthquake.\" –B-Sides & Badlands\n\nLos Angeles based singer-songwriter Dan Sadin is excited to announce the release of his debut solo self-titled EP. Best known for being the guitarist in electropop band FRENSHIP, his debut solo EP is raw, honest and filled with tender, heart-swelling lyrics.\n\nIn addition to working with FRENSHIP regularly, he has co-written and played on tracks with artists including Sabrina Claudio, Jessie Ware, Frenship, MØ and more. As a guitarist, producer and songwriter, Sadin felt it was important to explore his vulnerability and dug deep into his rock roots for this project, having grown up listening to artists like Tom Petty, Fleetwood Mac and Bruce Springsteen. His songs are an honest exploration of where the music we currently listen to comes from and an original take on where it can go. In fact, Sadin does what very few artists are willing to do: disregard current music trends in an effort to stay true to his roots and openly connect with his most important musical inspirations.\n\n“It’s almost instinctual – that feeling of dread when we know the relationship is over and how it’s only a matter of time before the glass shatters. LA artist Dan Sadin is channeling that darkness into something a little sweeter today with ‘Here Comes The Heartbreak’...With this in mind, Sadin plucks soft strings with bitter intent, bearing the heavy weight of a heart breaking in real time.\n\n–All Things Go\n\nThe material for this self-explorative EP was taken from a critical time in Sadin’s life. Fresh from a romantic and band break up, he went on to travel the world with Frenship, not leaving him a ton of time to process the loss. “The Way That It Hurts” is a cathartic outpouring in the form of big guitars and a sweeping chorus. Girl Underground Music said of the track, “The repetitive and progressive strumming hails from the end of the glam era of rock, as Sadin’s musical breaks revives the modern approach of the track.” The second single, “Here Comes The Heartbreak” is a deeply personal track about expressing gratitude for someone who’d changed his life, even if their relationship didn’t work. In “Lost on Nothing,” written alongside his close friend and collaborator, Colyer, he reflects on the struggle of seeing his country divided and tearing itself apart while feeling powerless in coming up with a sustainable solution.\n\nThe material emmenates sincerity and results in a unique musical style seamlessly intertwined in vulnerability. Of the EP Sadin says, “I needed to create the music I’ve been looking for. I had to capture the voice I needed to hear. This EP is me: my experiences, my relationships and my feelings. There’s nothing to hide behind. The fear of being this open and exposed has held me back from doing this for a long time. But if I truly want something, I have to be willing to try and create it for myself and this EP is the start of that journey.”\n\nKEEP UP WITH DAN SADIN\n\nPhotos, Bio etc.: http://smarturl.it/DanSadinPR\n\nhttp://dansadin.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/dansadinmusic\n\nhttps://twitter.com/_dansadin\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/dansadin\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTdqdeADp-ehr2b5ZBZJGUw\n\nVIEW THE RELEASE TRAILER : HERE\n\nNashville artist Boo Ray will be releasing the third installment in his ‘BooCoo Amigos’ 7inch duet series, with celebrity chef Sean Brock via Soundly Music. The digital release will be arriving July 27th followed by the physical vinyl release on August 24th. The 7inch features featuring two original songs “Saint Misbehavin’” and “Soul Food Cookin,” The vinyl is currently available for pre-order HERE.\n\nPrior releases in the ‘BooCoo Amigos’ series include duets with Lilly Winwood (Americana singer and daughter of Rock & Roll Hall of Famer Steve Winwood) and Elizabeth Cook. Cowboys & Indians called the Lilly Winwood duet “Hard to Tell,” “a fun, whimsical track that utilizes its steel guitar, organ, and bluesy guitar licks to emphasize Winwood’s unique voice and Ray’s signature eccentric style.” The Holiday duet with Elizabeth Cook “All Strung Out With Christmas Lights” was praised by Rolling Stone County, who called “a boozy bedrock of electric guitar, pedal steel and barroom piano.” The Country Note called the song “fun” and “flirty,” and No Depression recommended for readers to “Spin this tune while you’re stringing the lights on the tree with someone you want to be with and see what happens.” Additional praise for the series has come from Wide Open Country, Battered and Brewed, Glide Magazine, Nashville Music Guide, The Alternate Root and more.\n\nRay and Brock struck up a fast friendship over their mutual love of food and tattoo’s, both of which served as inspiration for the 7inch. The relationship started as most modern friendships do, on the internet. Brock had spotted a photo Ray posted to instagram of a tattoo from Athens, GA artist Mitchell Atkinson (Twins of Pain), via the hashtag #MitchellAtkins. Brock was so impressed to find a like-minded admirer of Atkins’ work the photo left a lasting impression him, and he started to follow Ray on social media. As luck would have it Brock spotted Boo, recognizing him from Instagram, at the East Nashville coffee shop Barista Parlor. The two struck up a conversation and became fast friends.\n\nWhen they started to write and make music together, they back to the source of how the first met for “Saint Misbehavin.’“ “Sean and I discovered that we had an Athens Georgia tattooist in common, “ Says Ray, “a wild rebel soul named Mitchell Atkinson that was one half of Twins of Pain Tattooing. After talking guitars, Jerry Reed, Billy Gibbons and Southern Culture On The Skids we figured we ought to write a number about Mitch, bemoaning ‘the foolish ways that take our friend before they’re old,’ and since it’s Chef Sean Brock I’m working with here, the obligatory ‘Soul Food Cookin’ song was natural as a hiccup.”\n\nThe first verse of “Saint MisBehavin’” references Atkins’ violent and fiery death in a hot rod accident with the verse “curse the foolish ways that take my friends before they're old.” The second verse the lyric “friends taken away by the foolish ways” eludes the coal mining industry in the Appalachian Mountains where both Brock and Ray grew up. “Watching Boo Ray magically turn our ideas into something you can play on a turntable was the songwriting equivalent of ‘farm to table’ cooking,” say Brock. “These songs were made to crank up with the windows down and the throttle wide open.“\n\nThe titled “Saint Misbehavin” is cleverly named after the Patron Saint of Body Art, “Saint Theresa the Tatted,” a mystical character who lived in war torn state of Kosovo in the early 90s. Legend has it that she kept an entire convent on nuns alive during the war by smuggling them food under her clothes, hanging the items on her body piercings.\n\nKEEP UP WITH BOO RAY\n\nBoo Ray PR Materials: http://smarturl.it/BooRayPR\n\nWebsite: https://booraymusic.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BooRayLive/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Boocooray\n\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/booray\n\nNashville’s ZAYDE WØLF has released his brand new album Modern Alchemy, out everywhere today. ZAYDE WØLF is a relatively new project for producer, songwriter and entrepreneur Dustin Burnett. His creative empire began with one song by accident and has since skyrocketed to include over 489,000 Spotify monthly listeners with 29 million streams, 9 million YouTube views, 88,000 YouTube subscribers and his music has been heard in hundreds of TV shows, films, trailers, commercials, video games and more.\n\nThe album title Modern Alchemy is derived from the medieval chemistry of converting poor metals into gold. This ties into the albums theme of self-betterment and pushing yourself into something greater than where you came from or how people may have defined you. It is powered by the previously released singles \"Gladiator\" and \"Rule the World\" which collectively have earned over 1.8 million streams. This is a topic of self-betterment is very close to home from Burnett, who grew up in Metropolis, IL a small town in Illinois best known for its fictional son, Clark Kent aka Superman. The riverfront factory town is a shell of what it used to be, and the level of success Burnett has achieved, both personally and professionally, is beyond anything he ever imagined.\n\nThe songs on this record are packed with uplifting and motivational lyrics mixed with the epic sonic production ZAYDE WØLF has become known for. “Next Level” encompasses the mentality of what this record is all about. It’s about reaching for new heights and always striving to become the best possible version of yourself you can possibly be. “The Crown” was inspired by Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech. “Higher Than High” is one of the most personal tracks. “When I was young, we didn't have much,” says Burnett, “but I always had a head full of dreams of what I wanted to do with my life and celebrating others. I wanted this song to make everyone feel like they were standing on a mountain with the sun shining bright in their life.” The motivational nature of of these songs has led ZAYDE WØLF to accrue a dedicated fan base around the world. Modern Alchemy has already charted in over 25 countries on the iTunes overall charts and in the U.S. debuted in the top ten Alternative charts.\n\nIn addition to being the creative mastermind behind ZAYDE WØLF, Burnett is also the co-owner of a drum sample and loops company called That Sound that has become a staple for top level artists and producers. The business has more than doubled in the past year, due to the quality of their work, making their live drum samples more in demand than ever before.\n\nWith Modern Alchemy, Burnett knows that real achievement is in the journey and the struggle. With this record, he is excited to share his incredible experiences with fans so that they too might be inspired by his journey through the music, to reach for new heights.\n\nKeep Up With ZAYDE WØLF\n\nhttp://www.zaydewolf.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/zaydewolf\n\nhttps://twitter.com/zaydewolf\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/zaydewolf\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/zaydewolf\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/zayde-wolf\n\nBio, Photos etc. : http://smarturl.it/phxuuq"
