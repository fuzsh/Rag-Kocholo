It seems like some of the music that used to be available before the series ended is no longer there.\n\nAlso, could you please work on getting all of John Denver's albums? They're very precious, as a lot of good songs were left out of his greatest hits.\n\nThanks,\n\nCAA in Mich\n\n(caamich on Spotify. Check out my public playlists!)\n\nHey @caamich\n\nRegarding removed music:\n\nThe reason is that the artist or their music label has likely decided to remove it from Spotify.\n\nThe availability of music on Spotify is up to the artist and their music label.\n\nSpotify wants all the world's music, and they're working hard on making this happen for you. However sometimes agreements can't be reached with the artist or label or a change may happen in music ownership. Sometimes the music is only available in certain countries, while access is blocked to others. Sometimes the album or song will be unavailable temporary, and come back again later.\n\nRegarding music not on Spotify:\n\nThe availability of music on Spotify is up to the artist and their music label.\n\nThis thread by Spotify staff explains why some music is not available:\n\nhttps://community.spotify.com/t5/Content-Questions/I-want-an-artist-song-on-Spotify/td-p/1136005\n\nMattSudaSpotify Star\n\nHelp others find this answer and click \"Accept as Solution\".\n\nIf you appreciate my answer, maybe give me a Like.\n\nNote: I'm not a Spotify employee.\n\nYou're not telling me anything I don't already know (or linking me to anything I haven't already read), @MattSuda. However, I was under the impression that if an artist/label pulled music, it was all pulled, not just some of it. And, if Spotify has rare John Denver recordings like \"Rocky Top,\" why on earth would they not have access to all his albums? Especially considering he's a beloved deceased artist.\n\nEDIT: Okay, didn't know about the Google form. Completed that. We'll see if that does any good.\n\nCAA in Mich\n\n(caamich on Spotify.
