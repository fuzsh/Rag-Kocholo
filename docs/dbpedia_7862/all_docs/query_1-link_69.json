        "text": "Season 3 Episode 5\n\nCarole King\n\nTo Be Home Again\n\nForest Ecosystem Preservation\n\nCarole King at the 1972 Grammys\n\nOur guest today is one of the most successful female songwriters of the latter half of the 20th century, writing or co-writing 118 pop hits in Billboard's top 100 in the US and 61 hits that charted in the UK, making her the most successful female songwriter on the UK singles charts for 43 years starting in 1962.\n\nWhat happens when you redirect the energy, hustle and persistence it takes to make it as a songwriter into a worthy cause?\n\nSong Chronicles is proud to present this conversation between Carole and podcast host and producer, her daughter Louise in an informative exploration that delves into King's remarkable journey from being renowned for her iconic songs to becoming a passionate advocate for environmental protection, specifically through her work on the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act (NREPA). Despite her initial lack of expertise in environmental matters, King's love for nature, cultivated since her childhood, sparked her interest in ecosystem protection.\n\nphoto by Elissa Kline\n\nForest Ecosystem Preservation\n\nIn 1989, King's involvement in environmental advocacy began when she encountered a bill proposed by scientists from Montana, which laid out a comprehensive approach to protecting the Northern Rockies ecosystem. This bill, based on the concept of preserving habitat for keystone species like grizzly bears, resonated deeply with King, leading her to take action by lobbying in Congress.\n\nOver the years, King faced both rewarding and challenging experiences as a volunteer advocate for NREPA. Despite the bill's continuous presence in Congress since 1992, it has yet to become law. However, King remains steadfast in her commitment to keeping the bill alive, recognizing its significance as a crucial climate solution, especially in the face of growing environmental challenges like climate change.\n\nCarole King testifying in Congress\n\nThrough her advocacy efforts, King emphasizes the importance of recognizing the interconnectedness of ecosystems and the urgent need for conservation measures. Her dedication to NREPA reflects her belief in creating a sustainable future for generations to come, highlighting the vital role of grassroots activism in addressing environmental issues.\n\nclockwise left to right:\n\nSherry Goffin Kondor, Carole King, and Louise Goffin\n\nLaurel Canyon\n\nOverall, Carole King's journey from music legend to environmental advocate serves as an inspiring example of using one's platform and passion to drive positive change in the world, reminding us of the power of persistence and determination in the face of daunting challenges.\n\nWelcome to Season 3, Episode 4 of Song Chronicles. Our guest today is Dave Davies, co-founder and lead guitarist for The Kinks, one of the most influential and quintessentially English rock bands.\n\nDave has recently released his autobiography and an album that goes with it, which are both called Living On A Thin Line. He has much to share in this conversation about the creative process, how a sense of humor can drive good storytelling home, the emotional comfort of melancholia in songs and poetry, and what it was like writing the song 21st Century with my dad, Gerry Goffin.\n\nIn addition to his brother and later bandmate Raymond, Dave was raised with six older sisters. We talk about growing up in this house of girls helped him understand how important it is for a healthy life to develop both a masculine and feminine side.\n\nDave was inspired by the working class storytelling of American music such as Hank Williams, Frank Sinatra, Fats Domino and even Rogers and Hammerstein songs, having heard songs from South Pacific and Oklahoma that his sisters used to play him when he was a boy. Getting thrown out of school set his musical learning on a path he credits with driving him to experiment more. We talk about how imagination is drawing new connections between things you've been exposed to.\n\nDave with his Harmony Meteor in 1964\n\nThe Kinks, Dave's band with his brother Ray, were one of the most successful and influential bands of the 60s. The Kinks scored 12 consecutive Top 20 singles in the UK before making themselves known in the US in the late 60s and then inspired countless other bands with their working class stories, humor, and androgynous theatrical image.\n\nIn the late 60s, Dave embarked on a solo career and continued to tour until 2018. He remains active to this day.\n\nIn 1992, Dave wrote \"21st Century\" with Gerry Goffin in an LA coffee shop. This hidden gem went unreleased for 30 years until it was released as a 7\" vinyl in 2022. We talk about their relationship and Gerry's lyrical intuition.\n\nThank you Dave for being generous with your time and stories.\n\nWelcome to Season 3, Episode 3 of Song Chronicles. Our guest today is singer and songwriter Billy Valentine, who just released a new album called \"a masterclass in soul interpretation\" by Record Collector. Billy Valentine & The Universal Truth was chosen as the first record for the relaunch of Flying Dutchman, the iconic imprint known for releases by Duke Ellington, Gil-Scott Heron, and Leon Thomas.\n\nBilly was born in West Virginia as one of thirteen children and later moved to Columbus, Ohio where his parents owned a nightclub. His brother Alvin introduced him to the path of professional entertainer. At 15 years old, Billy booked his first paying gig after sitting in with his brother Alvin during a performance at Leon’s Cocktail Lounge in Patterson, NJ. After a stint in the original touring company of The Wiz, Billy and his brother John formed The Valentine Brothers. Together they recorded four albums and had a breakout Reagan-era protest single \"Money’s Too Tight (To Mention).\"\n\nThe Valentine Brothers\n\nAfter the duo split, Billy began a songwriting collaboration with Bob Thiele, Jr and Phil Roy. The trio’s songs were recorded by Bonnie Raitt, Pops and Mavis Staples, The Neville Brothers, and his hero Ray Charles. We talk about the \"pinch me\" moment of hearing Ray’s recording of his song, the title track of the album My World.\n\nRay Charles's 1993 album My World\n\nBilly’s incredible vocal interpretations made him a sought-after demo singer for songwriting greats like Burt Bacharach & Hal David and Gerry Goffin. Bob Thiele, Jr. says it was Billy’s voice that made the songs they wrote together irresistible, making Billy \"the secret weapon of nearly every songwriter in LA.\" We talk about how Billy came to sing on the soundtrack of Boston Legal.\n\nBurt Bacharach and Billy Valentine\n\nRecording during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 brought Billy back to the '60s, being brought up in Ohio during the Kent State and Vietnam War protests. He chose to reinterpret iconic protest songs by Gil-Scott Heron, Curtis Mayfield, and Stevie Wonder for his new record Billy Valentine & The Universal Truth. We talk about the permanence of protest songs in our cultural landscape.\n\nAfter many decades in the business, Billy says he is finally feeling good in his own skin and proud of how he made these songs sound. We talk about how hard artists are on themselves and how pleasing yourself is the hardest part. He has an ageless quality about him and describes himself as having a \"young heart.\"\n\nEnjoy this conversation with a storied interpreter of songs.\n\nWelcome to Season 3, Episode 2 of Song Chronicles. Our guest today is Michelle Lewis, an Emmy- and Peabody-winning songwriter and composer and an advocate of songwriters’ rights as executive director of SONA.\n\nMichelle’s parents were both musicians. Her dad was the tenor saxophone player in Frank Sinatra’s band and her mom was a session singer who sang with the likes of Benny Goodman. Michelle talks about what it was like to tag along with her parents in the early seventies scene of working musicians in New York as \"the little mascot of the cats.\"\n\nMichelle recording jingles as a kid\n\nAfter college, Michelle had a deal with Irving Azoff’s Giant Records as a recording artist. Later her songs were recorded by other artists, including Cher, Amy Grant, Kelly Osbourne, and Lindsay Lohan. We talk about the invisibility of songwriters and the skill involved into distilling your life experience into words that can be sung by someone else, like a screenwriter writing for actors. More recently, Michelle has been a composer for children's television, including Doc McStuffins, for which she won a Peabody Award. She shares how writing for television lets her express a different range of creativity because it's not bound by genre.\n\nMichelle with her Peabody Award\n\nIn 2015, Michelle had a cut on an album that sold millions of copies and yet she was paid a fraction of what her 2005 hit was worth. Learning how much streaming technology had devalued the work of songwriters, she got together with songwriters Shelly Peiken, Pam Sheyne, Kay Hanley, Adam Dorn, Jack Kugell, and attorney Dina LaPolt to form SONA, Songwriters of North America. SONA pushes for changes to legislation like the Music Modernization Act which updated how songwriters are paid mechanicals to reflect the streaming music landscape. Michelle breaks down the different sources of revenue for songwriters including mechanicals, performance royalties, publishing, and syncs.\n\nSONA meeting with Senator Edward Markey\n\nMichelle is a mentor with WriteGirl, an organization that provides free mentoring to girls interested in songwriting and other types of writing including poetry, fiction, journalism, and screenwriting. We talk about the experience of helping girls write their first songs and how their lives are changed after seeing their songs performed. Michelle shares a story about watching future National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman develop her voice in WriteGirl workshops.\n\nWriteGirl songwriting workshop\n\nEnjoy this conversation about the importance of the jobs of songwriters, who provide the soundtrack to our lives.\n\nWelcome to Season 3, Episode 1 of Song Chronicles. Our guest is producer, engineer, and educator Mark Rubel. Mark has produced thousands of recordings for artists including Alison Krauss, Rascal Flatts, Fall Out Boy, Ludacris, and many more. Mark sees humans as storytelling machines, with production and mixing as a unified field of sonic storytelling.\n\nMark placing microphones to record Roy \"Futureman\" Wooten at The Blackbird Academy in Nashville\n\nMark has taught audio technology, the music business, and the history of rock to thousands of students. Previously the Audio and Recording Director and Instructor at Eastern Illinois University, he is now the Director of Education at The Blackbird Academy in Nashville, where he and Louise met, when she was one of his students. He shares the parallels between pacing a lesson and pacing a set list and how teachers are, in a sense, performers when they hold their students’ attention.\n\nMark teaching students at Blackbird Academy\n\nHe’s currently working on a book on the great American recording studios of the '60s and '70s many of which had their own unique setups with obscure pieces of equipment before the studio revolution moved recordings from live tracking to mono to 24 tracks synched up. Describing himself as a \"inveterate rabbit hole diver\", the task of finishing the book has been monumental. We talk about how Mark finds the motivation and energy to get everything done, what kinds of people make art no matter what, and how his parents influenced him. HIs mother was a journalist and his father was a scientist and mathematician.\n\n“You know\" he says, \"...if you take science, but high level science, where it's not, it's not just equations, it's philosophical leaps of problem solving and finding creative ways to get from one place to another -so that kind of science -and you combine it with what my mother did, which was portraiture in words, and you put them together, you get a record producer, engineer who's making a kind of a technical portrait of someone's essence, and you're trying to portray their personality and, and who they are through sound. So it's, it's a nice combination of those two things.”\n\nEnjoy this conversation about making audio technology accessible to everyone.\n\nWelcome to Season 2, Episode 12 of Song Chronicles. Our special guests today are the bewitching jazz vocalist Marley Munroe, better known as Lady Blackbird, and the award-winning producer, writer and musician Chris Seefried. Together, the two created the incredible Lady Blackbird debut album Black Acid Soul, which they describe as a genre all its own they almost invented. As Chris explains, the word \"jazz\" could have been limiting, but he reassured Marley \"you can still wear your outfits.\"\n\nLady Blackbird’s vocals are often compared to legends like Nina Simone or Billie Holiday, two vocalists she feels trained her. Chris describes what it’s like to have new audiences see Marley perform — it’s almost as if she’s a star they just haven’t heard yet.\n\nAs well as being a renowned producer, writer, and musician, Chris is an artist in his own right. We talk about what it’s like for him to be a part of another artist’s project as an artist himself. There’s no conflict for him because, as he says, \"We get to play everything we love and listen to the greatest singer in the world sing it.\"\n\nBlack Acid Soul might seem like an overnight success, but many years of work have gone into it.\n\nMarley and Chris in 2014\n\nAnd releasing a debut record in 2020 was no easy feat — Marley and Chris couldn’t support the record with the standard touring because of the pandemic.\n\nThe project was eventually embraced first by the UK, as often happens with American artists, and Lady Blackbird was invited to play Jools Holland — which Marley and Chris pushed through not realizing they both had COVID.\n\nListen to a most joyful conversation and hear about Marley and Chris's incredible journey writing, recording and performing this world-class, era-defying music that's worthy of becoming part of serious music fans' most loved artists.\n\nWelcome to Season 2, Episode 11 of Song Chronicles. Our special guest today is Thomas Walsh, an Ivor Novello-nominated songwriter who is the front person and songwriter behind the Irish pop-rock project Pugwash.\n\nAs a band, Pugwash released six albums and toured through the UK and Ireland before Thomas returned Pugwash to its roots as a solo project with the most recent album Silverlake. He's currently at work on a new solo album.\n\nPugwash in 2015\n\nWe also talk about The Duckworth Lewis Method, his collaboration with Neil Hannon of The Divine Comedy, and what it's like working with a true partner in co-writing.\n\nThe Duckworth Lewis Method\n\nThomas is an incredible writer of melodies. We talk about the songwriting process, how he often dreads the process but loves the result, and how he usually writes from his own experience. Though he feels the need to be modest about his own songwriting, I get him to share his favorites of his own songs that he's written throughout his career. As he shares, it's often the songs that come to you quickly that turn out the best.\n\nThomas performing in 2015\n\nThomas is a walking encyclopedia of music with the biggest record collection I've ever seen. He shares his obsession with the labels printed on records and the sense memories he associates with 70s music.\n\nHe talks about getting to work with many of his influences, including Jeff Lynne, co-founder of Electric Light Orchestra, who told him a funny story about how George Harrison found his awards to be highly valuable — in the garden. You'll also hear a fun story about singing Kinks songs with Ray Davies in the pub.\n\nThomas with Jeff Lynne\n\nEnjoy this in depth conversation with a true lover of music.\n\nSeason 2: Episode 10\n\nBilly Steinberg\n\nWelcome to Season 2, Episode 10 of Song Chronicles. Our special guest is Songwriter Hall of Fame member Billy Steinberg, who with collaborator Tom Kelly wrote many Number 1 hits including \"Like a Virgin\" by Madonna, \"True Colors\" by Cyndi Lauper, \"So Emotional\" by Whitney Houston, \"Alone\" by Heart, and \"Eternal Flame\" by The Bangles. The duo also co-wrote \"I’ll Stand By You\" with Chrissie Hynde and \"I Touch Myself\" with Christine Amphlett and Mark McEntee of The Divinyls.\n\nBilly Steinberg and Cyndi Lauper in Finland, 1988.\n\nBilly’s first hit song was \"How Do I Make You,\" which Linda Ronstadt decided to record after hearing demos from Steinberg’s band Billy Thermal. In our conversation, Billy shares how he found out Rondstadt would record the song which later reached the Billboard Top 10.\n\nBilly Thermal's unreleased 1980 album\n\nIn 1981, Steinberg began a momentous collaboration with songwriter Tom Kelly, with whom he wrote many memorable hits of the 80s and 90s. Billy shares how he and Tom found their groove as co-writers and how they always tried to write to make themselves happy rather than customizing songs for potential artists. Their breakout hit was \"Like A Virgin,\" the title track of Madonna’s second album. You’ll hear Billy’s personal story behind the lyrics to \"Like A Virgin\" and what it meant for him to hear the song sung by an Italian nun, directed at God.\n\nBilly Steinberg, Tom Kelly, and Chrissie Hynde of The Pretenders, 1992.\n\nSteinberg’s lyrics resonate throughout the years because their themes are universal — which is different from being general or bland, as we discuss. We also talk about how the Brill Building Era inspired him to become a songwriter.\n\nBilly has gone on to write with many other songwriters, including frequent collaborator Josh Alexander with whom he co-write \"Give Your Heart a Break\" by Demi Lovato and \"Too Little Too Late\" by Jojo. They have also written numerous songs with the artist LP, whom Steinberg calls \"a female Roy Orbison.\"\n\nBilly Steinberg and LP\n\nEnjoy this interview with Billy Steinberg on what makes songs that stand the test of time.\n\nSeason 2: Episode 9\n\nJon Platt\n\nWelcome to Episode 9, Season 2 of Song Chronicles. Our special guest is Jon Platt, the Chairman and CEO of Sony Music Publishing – a man Jay-Z proclaimed as the “the Obama of the music industry.”\n\nJon took a quite unusual path to becoming one of the most powerful and influential (music) publishers of the past 25 years,\" according to Variety. Born in Philadelphia and raised in Oakland, Jon was a high school student in Denver when he took his first step into the music industry. While working in a sporting goods store, he befriended a local DJ named Thomas Edwards, who showed Jon the deejaying basics and he soon became a popular club DJ.\n\nJon with Chuck D. photo by Desiree Navarro/Wire Image\n\nJon's next life-changing moment came when Jon was MC’ing a Public Enemy/Ice Cube concert. He got to talking with Public Enemy’s front-man, Chuck D, who told Jon not to settle for just being a DJ. “My music dream started the next day from that day,” Jon reveals in our conversation.\n\nwith Jay-Z\n\nInspired by Chuck D's words, Jon began managing some songwriters and producers in Los Angeles. In 1995, he got a low-rung job in EMI’s A&R department and quickly struck gold by signing Marqueze Etheridge, co-writer of the TLC’s smash, “Waterfalls,” one of the year’s – and the decade’s – mega hits. He credits his “DJ instincts” for his talent for breaking records like “Waterfalls” as well as his role behind the making of the Jay-Z/Alicia Keys smash single, “Empire State of Mind.”\n\nJon (on the right) with Sean Combs, Jay-Z, and Clarence Avant, one of Platt's mentor figures.

He later moved Warner/Chappell, where he was appointed Chairman and CEO in 2015. Then in 2019, he took the same positions at Sony Music Publishing, the world's No. 1 global music publisher with a catalog of over three million songs.\n\nHighly respected inside and outside the music business, Jon has received such honors as SESAC’s Visionary Award, Morehouse College’s Candle Award in Music, Business and Entertainment, and Black Radio Exclusive Magazine’s Man of the Year, and has been a perennial presence on Billboard’s prestigious Power 100 list.\n\nwith Pharrell Williams.

He wholeheartedly believes in the importance of helping people because you can help. This belief is underscored in the story he shares about assisting in getting Kanye West onto Usher’s Confession tour along with his many philanthropic endeavors – such as starting the Big Jon Platt Scholarship Program in 2005 to help Denver high school students go to college.\n\nJon with his wife, Angie, Usher, and Rita Ora\n\nHe’s extremely proud too for being able to assist songwriters during the pandemic. Jon, who has championed songwriters throughout his career, helped to have Sony’s COVID Global Relief Fund donate over $2 million to songwriters – and not just Sony Music Publishing songwriters -worldwide. We also discuss the Music Modernization Act, which he believes is a step in the right direction for songwriting compensation. It’s important, Jon says, “to do the right thing by songwriters.”\n\nPhoto by Mary Beth Koeth\n\nPlease enjoy this very special conversation with Jon Platt as he offers his perceptive personal insights along with talking about his unique place in the music business, and his love for music and music-makers.\n\nWelcome to Season 2, Episode 8 of Song Chronicles. Our special guest this week is cardiologist and singer-songwriter Suzie Brown, whose work has been recognized by NewSong Music Competition, the Great American Songwriting Competition, and the International Acoustic Music Awards.\n\nBorn in Montreal and raised in Boston, Suzie seemed predestined to follow in her parents’ footsteps to become a doctor and didn’t consider being a musician to be a potential career choice. While pursuing medicine at Harvard Medical School and later at the University of Pennsylvania, she started performing purely for the love of it, joining an a cappella group in college, moonlighting in a production of Hair with other busy grad students, and fronting a cover band during residency. She wrote her first song during her cardiology fellowship.\n\nOver time, Suzie became a staple of the Philadelphia music scene, where she released her first three albums. Now living in Nashville with her husband Scot Sax, she is a part-time Vanderbilt cardiologist and a full-time mom.\n\nSuzie and her husband Scot Sax\n\nThis full plate of responsibilities caring for others means Suzie has to fiercely defend her own creative time. Her sixth record, Under the Surface, was made by stealing away the hours of 6-10pm each evening with her producer Billy Harvey who lives down the street in Nashville. Making music during the COVID-19 pandemic was the one thing she could do for herself that allowed her to process the heartbreak she felt caring for her patients.\n\nIn this conversation recorded in March 2021, Suzie shares her insights for tapping into inspiration amidst an impossibly busy schedule, wrestling with perfectionism, and how going to med school prepared her for adjusting to the \"new normal\" of living in a pandemic.\n\nEnjoy this conversation with Suzie Brown about living a full and fulfilling life."
