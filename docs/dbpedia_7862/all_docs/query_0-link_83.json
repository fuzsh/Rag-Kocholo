        "text": "Dustin Lynch\n\nNet Worth: $5 million\n\nVenture: Ridin Roads\n\nWhen Dustin Lynch was at Lipscomb University in Tennessee, he knew it was time to choose between two very different career paths, one being as a country singer and the other was saving lives as a medical professional. Lynch eventually decided to go with his heart and chose to start a professional musical career. The singer-songwriter was found very quickly and signed a label deal with Broken Bow. He released his first EP shortly after and proceeded to release three more albums with the label. Since then, Lynch has had six of his eight singles hit the #1 spot on the charts. We’re not sure if it’s his charm or looks (or both), but this country star seems to have a very promising career ahead of him.\n\nApparently, going for a luxurious singing career ended up being a lot more profitable for Lynch than a medical career would have been, as it probably would have left him with a whole lot of college debt. His current worth is estimated at roughly $5 million dollars and that’s with a career that’s just only starting to show its potential. His three albums so far were “Dustin Lynch,” “Where It’s At,” and “Current Mood.” His most recent musical venture is an EP entitled “Ridin Roads,” which is shaping up to be another success in a very bright musical future.\n\nLady A\n\nNet Worth: $41 million\n\nVenture: LadyAID\n\nWith over ten million album sales worldwide and multiple Grammy awards, Lady A have managed to make their mark in the Country scene by combining the immense talents of Charles Kelley, Hillary Scott (Linda Davis’ daughter), and Dave Haywood. Despite a humble start supporting other musicians as guest vocalists, the group has managed to garner sufficient popularity and interest to get signed by the Capitol label and release their own music.\n\nThe group is reported to be worth an estimated $40 million, mostly generated through six albums that have all received critical acclaim and praise. Three of the group’s albums reached platinum and diamond status, and nine of their singles reached number one in the charts. If you're new to the band we highly recommend checking out two of their most popular songs, \"Downtown,\" and \"Need You Now\".\n\nRosanne Cash\n\nNet Worth: $10 million\n\nVenture: Johnny Cash\n\nBoyhood Home Project The Cash family has been in the music industry for quite a long time. Rosanne Cash, the oldest daughter of famous Country singer Johnny Cash, has seen relative fame and success in her musical career. Unlike many singers in our list, she actually found herself crossing a variety of musical genres until settling on the Americana musical audience, which ended up becoming a very successful one for her. Rosanne Cash is best known to date for her 1981 single, “Seven Year Ache,” which she has never really bested in terms of popularity and acclaim.\n\nThe singer-songwriter debuted with her album called interiors and has since evolved into various other genres and musical styles. Her most popular song, Seven Year Ache, became #1 in both the Country charts and the pop single charts. With a net worth just shy of $10 million, much of her wealth was the result of the added name recognition she got from her father’s extremely successful career. Still not a bad job though.\n\nKeith Urban\n\nNet Worth: $75 million\n\nVenture: The URBAN Guitar Collection\n\nIf there’s one Country singer on this list that truly managed to break through into mainstream appeal, it would definitely be Keith Urban. Beyond being one of the most recognizable names in the music industry, Urban is also known for being the husband of Oscar-winning actress Nicole Kidman. This platinum-selling singer originally began his musical career as a guitarist for The Ranch but quickly decided to go out there and do his own thing.\n\nThe New Zealand-born musician quickly dominated the charts with his debut album due to his amazing looks and insane musical appeal and achieved a very rare feat of receiving platinum status in his very first release. Since then, he has been pumping out best-selling albums without any sign of stopping and has even founded the URBAN Guitar Collection company, which helped boost his net worth to a staggering $75 million. But let’s be honest here, between his musical god status, great looks, immense wealth, his marriage to Nicole Kidman takes the cake for us.\n\nMac Davis\n\nNet Worth: $12 million\n\nVenture: The Mac Davis Show\n\nPopular retro singer, songwriter, and actor, Morris Mac Davis began his career in the music and entertainment industries as a songwriter for Nancy Sinatra's company, Boots Enterprises. He worked there for several years, contributing greatly to many of Sinatra's recordings. David eventually found his way to writing songs for the king of rock and roll, Elvis Presley. He was responsible for classics such as \"In the Ghetto\", \"Friend, Lover, Woman, Wife\", \"Home\", \"It's Such a Lonely Time of Year\", and \"Memories.\"\n\nFollowing his success as a songwriter, Davis went off on a solo path, pursuing a singing career which ended up becoming a very successful endeavor. He was awarded the Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year award in 1974 and proceeded to become an actor that same year. Davis hosted his own TV show on NBC called The Mac Davis Show and from there began to act in various films and TV shows such as North Dallas Forty and Cheaper to Keep Her.\n\nDavid Nail\n\nNet Worth: $500,000\n\nVenture: MCA Net\n\nDavid Nail is a 40-year-old country singer-songwriter with a fairly modest musical career. He has released a total of four studio albums: I'm About to Come Alive, The Sound of a Million Dreams, I'm a Fire, and Fighter, with a combined total of mid-6-figures in album sales. His last two albums both reached number three in the United States country billboards. Nail describes himself as \"an artist following his muse, making music without rules or regulations\".\n\nHe has been signed by Mercury Nashville and MCA Nashville in recent years and is originally from Kennett, Missouri. The singer took a brief break between 2002 and 2007 but has since returned full force into the music industry. If you’re interested in listening to some of Nail’s best songs, we recommend you check out “Let It Rain” and “Whatever She’s Got”, both these songs reached number-one on the country charts.\n\nCharley Pride\n\nNet Worth: $40 million\n\nVenture: Baseball\n\nCharley Pride is certainly a huge source of pride for many Americans because he exemplifies the pursuit of happiness perfectly. This talented individual somehow managed to become a successful country singer while also turning into one of the nation’s most popular and beloved African American baseball stars. Pride was born in 1934 in Sledge, Mississippi and saw his greatest musical success in the '70s when he became one of RCA Records' best selling artists since Elvis.\n\nHe was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2000. Since then, Pride uses his small fortune to become a minority owner in the Texas Rangers MLB club as part of his long activity in the sport. Pride is currently estimated to be worth around $40 million. What makes it even more impressive is that he did it as an African American during a time way before our modern push towards equality when a lot of the deck was stacked against him. His famous song “Just Between You and Me” is to this day one of the most iconic and unforgettable songs in country music’s history.\n\nMartina McBride\n\nNet Worth: $38 million\n\nVenture: Love Unleashed Tour\n\nMost country singers eventually crossover to pop and more mainstream versions of country once they have attained a certain level of fame and success. Crossing over helps musical artists expand into much bigger audiences and multiply a singer’s fan base. In Martina McBride’s case, she crossed over to pop a few times, long before achieving her current popularity and acclaim.\n\nThe Kansas-born singer is highly talented and plays everything from piano to harmonica and even the tambourine. Her first major single “The Time Has Come” didn’t achieve the popularity she hoped, but with many tweaks to her musical style and approach, she seems to have found her groove and managed to stay relevant and hot in the billboards for almost three decades since. McBride is currently signed to RCA and her tour Love Unleashed has proven to be very successful.\n\nBilly Currington\n\nNet Worth: $4.5 million\n\nVenture: Shotgun Rider Tour\n\nWith over two-million Facebook likes and over 650,000 Twitter followers, Billy Currington has managed to leverage social media to achieve commercial acclaim in the country genre. In 2017, his number-one single \"Do I Make You Wanna\" broke records by overtaking the number-two song by almost ten million sales. Currington has recently one the hilarious Hottest Video of the Year — \"Must Be Doin' Somethin’ Right\" award from CMT.\n\nCurrington has released six albums since 2003 with over one-million sales. Eight of his singles have reached Gold and Platinum status, including \"Pretty Good at Drinkin' Beer,\" \"Hey Girl,\" and \"Do I Make You Wanna.\" In 2013, Currington was indicted of felony criminal charges including making terrorist threats and inflicting mental anguish on an elder person, after allegedly berating and threatening boat captain Charles Harvey Ferrelle that same year. He was sentenced to 5 years' probation, a $1000 fine, and anger management counseling.\n\nCarly Pearce\n\nNet Worth: $500,000\n\nVenture: Way Back Tour\n\nYoung Carly Pearce has a very similar story to Lady A and started out as a guest singer for the popular Josh Abbott Band. Pearce then took a brave step and ventured out on her own, only that it didn’t take talent seekers any time to pay attention to her. The singer’s first single, “Every Little Thing,” became an instant hit when it was released in 2016 and became one of the year’s top songs in Country Airplay.\n\nPearce was shortly then signed to the label Big Machine, and has since released one album called \"Every Little Thing\" which sold around 40,000 units in the US. Her debut single \"Every Little Thing\" was awarded the Breakthrough Video of the Year award by CMT Music Awards. Pearce was born in Kentucky and grew up in Tennessee. She has recently married Michael Ray, a fellow country star.\n\nAlan Jackson\n\nNet Worth: $75 million\n\nVenture: Nashville\n\nWith over 80 million albums sold and 16 albums in his discography, old-school Country legend Alan Jackson’s is still going strong and keeps getting more and more interesting as time goes on. The top-selling singer and songwriter wrote almost all of his songs so far and is also engaged in other business ventures, such as a passion project with his daughter called Nashville.\n\nAlan Jackson is highly respected and acclaimed in the Country scene. He has amassed a small fortune of over 75 million dollars over the years and has even been involved with Cracker Barrel and the Ford Motor Company. Jackson is also a very religious person, with two of his albums being dedicated to gospel music and two other albums centered around Christmas themes.\n\nJake Owen\n\nNet Worth: $10 million\n\nVenture: Thunder by the Bay\n\nIf you’re not yet familiar with pretty boy Jake Owen, you might be missing out on one awesome country singer. The singer debuted in 2006 with the album ‘Startin’ with Me’ which was fairly successful and resulted in three singles that reached the Top 20 on the charts. He followed it up with his second album, “Easy Does It” which also received favorable acclaim. It’s often true that the ‘third time’s the charm’, which is exactly what happened in Owen’s case. His third album, “Barefoot Blue Jean Night” outperformed the first two by a margin and got him the number-one country hit and the Top New Male Vocalist award from ACM.\n\nOwen is an excellent golfer and occasionally plays pro golf. In June 2019, Jake was the subject of a small backlash from fans after covering Cher's song Believe to celebrate Gay Pride Month. He was promptly threatened with boycotts from many fans but chose to instead offer them a hug if they ever come to his concert, emphasizing that they \"need one\". The event has caused the musical artist to receive positive media coverage and a spike in his social media traffic..\n\nCassadee Pope\n\nNet Worth: $4 million\n\nVenture: Stages\n\nFormer lead singer of the popular country band Hey Monday, Cassadee Pope, has managed to build herself an impressive fan audience in just a few years after going her own way once the band reached its end (formally a hiatus) in 2011. Pope has released two albums and three EPs while being the singer of Hey Monday and has so far released a self-titled EP in 2012. They were followed by Frame by Frame, a number-one in the country charts, and Stages which came out just this year for digital download, although it had a much weaker reception. Our favorite singles from the talented country singer are, \"Wasting All These Tears\" which came out in 2013 and reached over a million sales (earning it a Platinum status by the RIAA), and \"Think of You\", a single featuring Chris Young which sold over 500,000 copies and also achieved Platinum status.\n\nPope has achieved many awesome victories in her short solo career, including being the first female winner of The Voice, being awarded the Breakthrough Video of the Year by CMT for hit single, \"Wasting All These Tears\", and was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Country Duo/Group Performance due to the aforementioned \"Think of You\" duet with Chris Young. She was also chosen as the Top Indie Artist of 2018 by the Taste of Country Fan Choice Awards.\n\nRascal Flatts\n\nNet Worth: $150 million\n\nVenture: Red Street Records\n\nOriginally formed in Columbus, Ohio, the Rascal Flatts are a popular musical group that combines popular music genres to create a delicacy of musical flavor called “country-rock-pop”. The band’s members include singer-songwriter Gary LeVox, Jay DeMarcus and Joe Rooney who are known to be second cousins. With seven best-selling albums to date, the group managed to secure an RIAA-certified platinum and diamond status for all their albums.\n\nThe group was first signed with Big Machine Records and went on to sign with Disney’s Lyric Street Records label. They have managed to build a very impressive net worth of $150 million and have succeeded in getting fourteen songs to the number-one spot in the charts since debuting. The band's longest-lasting number-one single is a 2005 cover of Marcus Hummon's \"Bless the Broken Road\", which spent five weeks in that position.\n\nT.G. Sheppard\n\nNet Worth: $1 million (estimated)\n\nVenture: NASCAR T.G.\n\nShepard is known as a country music legend and is active to this day even as he pushes age 76. The singer was born in Tennessee and decided to drop out of high school at an early age and pursue a career in music. He began his musical career with the name of William Browder and quickly gained an audience with his single \"Devil in the Bottle\" which reached the number one hit on Billboard's Hot Country Singles Chart. From there the singer went on to produce numerous number-one hits in the US charts and even had eight consecutive number one hits in the early '80s.\n\nG. Sheppard has since receded into a more modest life outside of the spotlight. His latest hit album was \"One for the Money\" and from there he would release an album ever 3-5 years with modest success. When asked about his stage name \"T. G. Sheppard\", he explains that as an executive at RCA, Browder didn't want to jeopardize his position by recording materials through other labels. He claims the stage name's initials (T. G.) are just random initials and don't really mean anything.\n\nDwight Yoakam\n\nNet Worth: $45 million\n\nVenture: Bakersfield Biscuits\n\nDwight Yoakam is the unchallenged king of coolness and stoic facial expressions, with classic country songs such as “A Thousand Miles From Nowhere”, he is hailed by many as one of the greats and is often listened to by fans who want to reminisce about the “good old days” of Country music. Yoakam initially rose to fame in the early ‘80s and has since released over twenty albums. Since his debut, he has successfully sold over twenty-five million records worldwide that have received gold and platinum status.\n\nYoakam is loved by many for his unique style, and even managed to reach triple-platinum status for his fifth album “This Time”. With over thirty singles reaching the top of the Billboard Hot Country charts, and a strong sense of business, Yoakam has built himself a fantastic net worth of almost $50 million. The Kentucky-born musician and entrepreneur is also the owner of a restaurant and food maker called Bakersfield Biscuits and is the manager of the Bakersfield Beat radio station.\n\nFaith Hill\n\nNet Worth: $80 million\n\nVenture: Tennessee Titans\n\nWith sales of over 40 million albums worldwide and an obsessed fan base that swears by her, Faith Hill can easily be considered one of the most famous and successful Country musicians in the world. Together with her husband of 25 years, Tim McGraw (who's also a musical icon in his own right), the couple is a powerhouse of music and wealth.\n\nThe couple also holds a large stake in the NFL’s Tennessee Titans. While McGraw is a lot more involved with managing the team on a daily basis, both of them appear to be active owners and take a lot of pride in their team’s success. Born in Mississippi, the singer grew up knowing early on that she wanted to become a big Country star. Her first single, “This Kiss”, debuted in 1998 to popular acclaim and her Soul2Soul tour is one of the best-selling tours the genre has ever seen. The future looks very bright for this couple, as they currently have a combined net-worth of over $80 million through their successful music careers and smart business decisions.\n\nJohnny Lee\n\nNet Worth: $5 million\n\nVenture: Urban Cowboy\n\nYou probably recognize Johnny Lee from his iconic 1980s song “Looking For Love”, which was the number one crossover hit and spent three weeks in first place on the charts. The texas-born country singer began his career humbly in a rock ‘n roll band called “Johnny Lee and the Roadrunners”. The band would often play cover songs in various nightclubs and other night venues in Texas during the ‘60s. Eventually, the young singer was discovered by a talent agent while collaborating with Mickey Gilley, a fellow country music singer and musician whom he worked with for over ten years.\n\nThe duo found their shot at fame when they collaborated on the soundtrack for James Bridge's romantic drama film, Urban Cowboy. From there, Lee went on to release various successful singles, including \"One in a Million,\" \"Bet Your Heart on Me,\" \"The Yellow Rose,\" and other hits that were released in the '80s. Lee suffered a number of tragedies in the '80s and '90s, with his ex-wife dying from prescription painkillers and son from a drug overdose. Since then, Lee has been an activist for stopping the use of illegal drugs.\n\nDavid Lee Murphy\n\nNet Worth: $8 million\n\nVenture: No Zip Code\n\nOriginally starting out as a songwriter and transitioning into a musician in his own right, David Lee Murphy has managed in a couple of years to stockpile a respectable net worth of almost $10 million through his musical career. The country artist’s most popular hit songs to date include “The Road You Leave Behind,” “Party Crowd,” “Out with a Bang,” “Dust on the Bottle” and “Everything’s Gonna Be Alright” (not to be confused with Bob Marley’s song). He’s currently developing a musical project with Kenny Chesney.\n\nLee Murphy has released five albums so far and has been on a temporary hiatus since 2004 after almost two decades of activity. During his humble beginnings in the musical industry, the veteran country singer spent his time writing songs for other famous country singers such as Thompson Square, Jason Aldean and Jake Owen. His best known work was “Big Green Tractor,” which ended up becoming a big hit for Jason Aldean.\n\nJohnny Rodriguez\n\nNet Worth: $4.6 million\n\nVenture: RunninWide\n\nMost people know Johnny Rodriguez as the Latin American country singer who managed to build his musical legacy and millions of dollars in net worth during the '70s and '80s. What most people don't know is that the young boy from Texas used to live in a family of ten and was put in jail at a young age following his father's and brother's deaths, which caused the young teen to stray. At just 20 years old, Rodriguez decided to turn his life around and moved to Nashville to try his luck as a country singer. He arrived with a guitar and $14 but soon found the demand for his musical and songwriting skills.\n\nFrom there the Latin-American country singer went on to gain fame and national attention with his debut single \"Pass Me By.\" Rodriguez's success peaked in 1975 with three number-one singles: \"I Just Can't Get Her Out of My Mind,\" \"Just Get Up and Close the Door,\" and \"Love Put a Song in My Heart.\" His troubled youth kept creeping up on him as he was involved in very severe legal troubles. Fortunately, Rodriguez was able to stay on the straight path and continues to perform and release albums even today, with his latest album, \"Live From Texas\" coming out just a few years ago.\n\nTyler Farr\n\nNet Worth: $4 million\n\nVenture: Broken Bow Records\n\nTyler Farr started his career as a songwriter and expanded his endeavors over time to include a country singing career as-well. He was born in Missouri but relocated at a young age to Nashville in hopes of being discovered and becoming a successful country singer. His plan seemed to work at first, as he was signed to BNA label, but to his dismay, the label closed its doors just shortly after Farr released his first two singles. Luckily, he recovered quickly from the event and managed to sign with Columbia Records label, leading him to release two studio albums over the next two years and release eight singles which have successfully appeared on the Billboard charts.\n\nFarr broke up with his second label, Columbia, after a falling out between the two, and from there he moved to Broken Bow Records in mid-2018. His highest rated single is \"A Guy Walks Into a Bar\", reaching the number-one spot in the chart when it was released in 2015. Far is married as of 2016 to his long-time girlfriend, and was featured on the Outdoor Channel show Buck Commander, where he talked about his love for hunting.\n\nEric Church\n\nNet Worth: $14 million\n\nVenture: Double Down Tour\n\nThe young Eric Church is an up and coming Country artist who’s been in the serious part of his career for the last 15 or so years. With six studio albums to his name, Church has produced many hit singles that seem to jive well with the younger fanbase of the genre. His first album, Sinners Like Me, was fairly well received and led to him teaming up with various other musicians such as Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan.\n\nChurch’s most recent album, Desperate Man, was also quite well received but has not attained exceptional acclaim or popularity. If you’re interested in checking his music, look no further than his best singles: “Springsteen,” “Drink in My Hand,” and his top hit “Raise ‘Em Up,” which he performed with Keith Urban.\n\nHunter Hayes\n\nNet Worth: $4.5 million\n\nVenture: The 21 Project\n\nThe multi-talented Hunter Hayes is known for a lot more than his awesome voice and great looks. The 18-year-old debuted his first album entitled Hunter Hayes back in 2011 to fantastic sales figures and critical acclaim. The album reached the number seven spot on the Billboard 200 charts and dominated the country album charts. What makes Hayes unique across the board is his talent and skill at playing over thirty different types of instruments.\n\nThe country artists were promptly approached by Nashville’s Atlantic Records and started working with them. His first single, “Wanted” became a massive hit and sold over three and a half million copies in its first year since release. This made Hayes the youngest artist to reach such records and put him up as a contender for future country Hall of Fame status. All that’s left for him to do is to keep up the good work.\n\nJoe Diffie\n\nNet Worth: $36 million\n\nVenture: All in the Same Boat\n\nYou may not recognize Joe Diffie in the picture above because most fans remember him as with the mullet-long-hair and mustache combination that just didn't seem to work but was still cool. Diffle is a country singer-songwriter from Nashville, Tennessee who was very famous during the '90s and early 2000s. Since his debut in 1989 as a country singer, he has released 35 singles which appeared in the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, with his top five songs being \"Home,\" \"If the Devil Danced (In Empty Pockets),\" \"Third Rock from the Sun,\" \"Bigger Than the Beatles,\" and \"Pickup Man,\" which was his most successful single and lasted four weeks at the number one spot.\n\nHe is often compared to George Jones and Mark Chesnutt, although he's regarded more as a humorous, rock-tinged singer rather than a traditional country artist. Diffie has been married four times so far. He used to hold charity concerts in the '90s for First Steps, a nonprofit that helps with education for mentally and physically disabled kids. He was even awarded a Humanitarian Award for his contributions in 1997 by Country Radio Broadcasters.\n\nTom T. Hall\n\nNet Worth: $1 million(estimated)\n\nVenture: Clipper Teas\n\nOne of the classical best sellers and among the most popular country singers in the world is Tom T. Hall. The retired country artist was once the hallmark of excellent country music and was consequently a massive country star in the ‘70s. Some of his most beloved songs are “I Love”, “(Old Dogs, Children and) Watermelon Wine” and “Harper Valley PTA”.\n\nTo respect his musical legacy and vast contributions to the country genre, Hall was recently inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Anyone who loves the country knows that you can’t have a list of the most successful country singers without including Tom T. Hall. Outside of his musical career, the retired musician is also a novelist and short-story teller. He wrote nine books to date between the '70s until the mid-'90s. In 1969 Hall was married to famous bluegrass songwriter and producer Dixie Hall until her passing in 2015.\n\nThomas Rhett\n\nNet Worth: $5 million\n\nVenture: The Ranch\n\nThomas Rhett is a successful country musician, actor and media entertainer. He was born in Georgia and grew up with Tim McGraw and Brooks & Dunn because of his father Rhett Atkins, who is a successful singer himself. Thomas Rhett knew he was born to be a musician early on, and already started showing the first signs of his musical talents during high school as a member of the High Heeled Flip Flops band.\n\nRhett was signed on Big Machine and released four albums at this point in time. He also appears often on shows such as The Ranch and Saturday Night Live. The country singer has so far released seventeen singles, with many of them reaching the number-one spot in the Billboard country charts.\n\nSherrie Austin\n\nNet Worth: $400,000\n\nVenture: Circus Girl\n\nWhile Sherrie Austin may look like your typical Alabama or Tennessee girl, she was actually born in Sydney, Australia and decided to try her luck in the musical and acting worlds by moving to the United States. Austin was a singer and general entertainer from a very young age, even going as far as being the opening act for the iconic Johnny Cash during his performance in Australia when she was just 14 years old. All of which led the young talented girl to move to the US. It didn’t take her long after to achieve her dream as an actress.\n\nAustin debuted as an actress in NBC's popular American sitcom “The Facts of Life” where she played as Pippa McKenna. She also had a short role in the legendary sitcom “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” where you might have recognized her as Lady Penelope. From there, Austin decided to form a country band in 1991 called Colorhaus. The band was modestly successful and had one of their songs appear on the soundtrack of an episode of the popular show Baywatch. She has since started a solo career, releasing five albums which have received lukewarm critical and commercial success. Her most successful single so far was 2013's \"Streets of Heaven\" which reached the number-eighteen spot in the country charts. Austin is also a part-time Broadway actress.\n\nBrandy Clark\n\nNet Worth: $10 million\n\nVenture: All BC Music\n\nOne of the younger singer-songwriters on our list is Brandy Clark. In just a bit less than 15 years, the acclaimed musician has managed to accomplish some pretty impressive feats. Clark writes songs for various famous artists such as The Band Perry, Sheryl Crow, Miranda Lambert, and even Reba McEntire. She’s also already signed with a private label named Slate Creek, which not many artists manage to do. If that’s not enough to persuade you, Clark has even founded her very own recording and production company called “All BC Music” (with the BC standing for either Brandy Clark or Blue Cheese).\n\nWhat we love the most about this inspirational young woman is how she got started. Apparently, music was a huge passion for young Brandy Clark and was already playing guitar by the age of ten. Her parents were her biggest fans at the time (hopefully they still are), and they helped push her to learn singing, songwriting and eventually, pursue her own music career. If you’re looking for a great model on how to raise awesome children, look no further than the Clark’s.\n\nScott McCreery\n\nNet Worth: $4 million\n\nVenture: Weekend Roadtrip\n\nTour If the name McCreery rings a bell, it’s because 26-year-old Scott McCreery was the winner of the popular musical reality show, American Idol, in its tenth season back in 2011. His success was a virtual guarantee following the publicized and challenging win, as he was offered many records deals with labels all across the United States. He eventually decided to go with Interscope and released his first studio album that year. The album, titled “Clear as Day,” was an instant hit among his fans from the show and received the lustrous platinum status. The album included many songs which ended up becoming very well received, mainly “The Trouble with Girls” and “I Love You This Big.”\n\nMcCreery decided to leave the label just six years later and promptly became the first and only country artist in history to appear in the charts without a record label behind him. McCreery is a sweetheart not just in his music videos and public appearances but also in real life. He recently married Gabi Dugal, his longtime girlfriend. He also sang the National Anthem before a popular AFC divisional game in 2016. With 4 albums released to date (one of which being a Christmas album) and a multi-millionaire status at the young age of 26, Scott McCreery is poised to have an extremely successful musical career.\n\nJoe Nichols\n\nNet Worth: $9 million\n\nVenture: Never Gets Old\n\nHeath Ledger look-alike, Joe Nichols is a country star that debuted back in the mid-‘90s and was immediately signed to Intersound and Giant for his commercial and popular appeal. Nichols has released nine albums over the course of his career, with the first being the eponymous Joe Nichols back in 1996 and the last one being the appropriately named Never Gets Old in 2017. Throughout his career, Nichols enjoyed a fair amount of commercial success with over fourteen of his songs appearing in the top 40 singles on the country charts. Joe Nichols\n\nHis best singles to date which have also performed best commercially are “Sunny and 75” and “Gimme That Girl,” with both singles reaching the number-one spot on the charts. Nichols started his career with the musical group The Rodeo Band and would often play in amateur venues such as high school dances and small clubs. It’s reported that the country singer is currently worth nearly $10 million through his label and album sales.\n\nChris Stapleton\n\nNet Worth: $10 million\n\nVenture: All American Road Show\n\nDespite not being as famous as some other country singers and musicians on our list, Chris Stapleton is definitely a name that you want to know if you’re a fan of the genre. With over 170 songs in his arsenal and 6 out of them reaching the #1 spot on the music charts, this songwriter is easily one of America’s most successful songwriters and it’s likely you’ve listened to at least a few songs he wrote himself.\n\nIf you’re a fan of the beloved Country star Kenny Chesney than there’s no way you haven’t heard his hit song “Never Wanted Nothing More,” that hit #1 on the music chart for 5 weeks. While the song was performed by Chesney, it was actually written by Stapelton. The successful Country singer and songwriter currently tours the country through his “The All American Road Show” concert tour, where he performs various songs he wrote over the years.\n\nMiranda Lambert\n\nNet Worth: $45 million\n\nVenture: Red 55 Winery\n\nOne of the most famous and successful Country singers in the United States, Miranda Lambert is often compared to other female stars in the music industry such as Avril Lavigne and Amy Winehouse. Lambert’s songs are full of powerful and empowering messages and are beloved by many women who view her as an amazing role model. Amongst her best songs are, “The House That Built Me,” “Mama’s Broken Heart,” “Heart Like Mine,” and our personal favorite, “Gunpowder & Lead.”\n\nLambert is an avid supporter of animal rights and is very actively trying to improve the way people treat them. She’s the founder of the MuttNation Foundation along with her mother, Bev Lambert. The foundation helps rescue animals in danger and gives them shelter. Outside of music and activism, the fiery and confident Lambert is also an owner and manager of a wine brand named “Red 55 Winery”. In case you were wondering if she’s still available, we’re happy to say that Lambert is happily married to Brendan McLoughlin, an NYPD officer. This is a fairly recent marriage, as the couple married just at the start of 2019.\n\nDanny Gokey\n\nNet Worth: $600,000\n\nVenture: Rock and Worship Tour 2016\n\nAnother country singer who gained much of his fame while appearing in American Idol is Danny Gokey. The Milwaukee born singer was a church music director before joining the 8th season of the popular musical reality show American Idol. Gokey ended up reaching third place on the show but was quickly signed with 19 Recordings after his appearance and then changed labels to RCA Nashville. His debut album, My Best Days, was released during the singer’s time with RCA Nashville. He didn’t stick long with them and moved on to a deal with BMG label in 2013 after deciding to change his tune to Christian rock rather than a classic country. Just this year, Gokey won the K-LOVE Fan's Male Artist of the Year Award.\n\nHis second album, Hope in Front of Me, was released in 2013. Gokey is just as lovely as his American Idol co-winner, Scott McCreery, as he has also married his high school sweetheart, Sophia Martinez in 2004. Unfortunately, his wife passed away before he joined American Idol, leading him to start a foundation in her name, Sophia's Heart Foundation\n\nBilly Joe Thomas\n\nNet Worth: $5 million\n\nVenture: Pepsi\n\nAs we move from Billie Jo Spears to Billy Joe Thomas, it clearly dawns why old-school fans of country have often lamented that traditional country has “just isn’t what it used to be”. The ‘60s and ‘70s produced some of the most prolific and incredible country singers to date, perhaps it was the era and the culture, or maybe it was due to the older recording quality, but either way, Billy Joe Thomas definitely stands head and shoulders above many of today’s pop-country musical counterparts with his soft and tender music that somehow manages to make your soul feel happier.\n\nThe country singer is mostly known for his musical mix of pop, country and Christian which came from his background as a church choir singer in his youth. His single, \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\" which was a cover of the hit Hank Williams song gained over a million sales and launched Thomas' career. He has won several Grammy Awards and was recently inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for his iconic song, \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\", which was featured in many films and video-games.\n\nJo Dee Messina\n\nNet Worth: $9 million\n\nVenture: Bigger Than This\n\nTwo-time Grammy award nominee Jo Dee Messina is a perfect example of a country singer taking the music industry in a perfect sequence of events. From a young age, Dee Messina was proving herself to be a very talented musician. She would tour her state of Massachusetts with her brother and play music in various local clubs. She was discovered eventually and signed a label deal with Curb in the early ‘90s. Her career skyrocketed from there and resulted in her releasing six hit singles in a short time span.\n\nDee Messina was the first female country singer to have three number-one singles the lasted in that spot for multiple weeks. Her albums were very successful and received one gold and two platinum certificates from the RIAA. The Massachusetts-born singer sold over five million copies worldwide and managed to become a multi-millionaire in the process with a net worth of almost $10 million. She has released six albums to date and her most successful singles are \"Bye, Bye,\" \"I'm Alright,\" \"Stand Beside Me,\" \"Bring on the Rain,\" and \"My Give a Damn's Busted\".\n\nCarrie Underwood\n\nNet Worth: $65 million\n\nVenture: CALIA by Carrie Underwood\n\nWhen we first heard Carrie Underwood perform as a young and aspiring artist in a popular music reality show American Idol, it was clear from the start that she was going to be causing some huge vibrations in the music world. This is exactly what happened, as the Oklahoma-born singer ended up becoming one of the most successful artists from her state. Underwood would go on to win American Idol, three Grammy awards and build her brand as a highly acclaimed musical artist.\n\nUnderwood’s musical ventures and business enterprises helped her secure a serious $65 million in personal net worth. Outside of music, she is also the founder and principal investor in her clothing line, CALIA, which provides sportswear for athletes that are based on her Oklahoma roots.\n\nThe Dixie Chicks\n\nNet Worth: $40 million\n\nVenture: Someday\n\nThis trio of country singers is the fantasy of every country music lover out there. Together, Martie Maguire, Emily Erwin, and Natalie Maines have more combined musical talent and beauty points than we know what to do with. After almost two decades of the trio’s relatively quiet and eager waiting from fans, the Dixie Chicks are finally working on their fourth studio album, Someday, which will undoubtedly be a bestseller.\n\nThe three singers first started touring together in Dallas and have found popularity with the country crowded with their unique set of voices and talents. Despite their short time together and very long hiatus, the trio’s best hit singles “There’s Your Trouble,” and “Wide Open Spaces” helped them received three Grammy awards over the years and sell millions of albums over the years. The moral of the lesson is, if you’re going to take a two-decades-long hiatus, make sure you do it after creating a raving fan base that’s going to keep consuming your material and eagerly waiting for your return.\n\nJerry Jeff Walker\n\nNet Worth: $200,000\n\nVenture: Mr. Bojangles\n\nWith over 5 decades of experience in the music industry, you can definitely say that Jerry Jeff Walker has been around the block. In fact, he has been circled the block many, many times and still keeps going. Jeff Walker, also known as Gypsy Songman, is a country and outlaw-country singer that comes from a family of musicians that goes back to his grandparents. He is currently 77 years old and still tours around the US.\n\nJeff Walker has been producing music consistently over the past 5 decades, with 38 albums attributed to his name. His best known single to date is the song “Mr. Bojangles.” The song has since been recorded by many other artists including the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band in 1970. Walker claims he was inspired to write the song while serving time in jail for public intoxication. He met a man who referred to himself as \"Mr. Bojangles\" which was the source for the single’s title.\n\nTrace Adkins\n\nNet Worth: $19 million\n\nVenture: SiriusXM\n\nWith an incredible record of highly successful songs and a terrific acting and radio hosting career, Trace Adkins has secured himself a spot in every Country aficionado's Greatest Hits compilation. The Louisiana-born singer and guitarist reached the peak of his fame towards the late ‘90s and early ‘2000s. In that period of time, he managed to release eleven highly acclaimed and popular albums that helped him reach a net worth of almost $20 million.\n\nIf you’re interested in listening to Adkins host on the radio, you can catch him at the SiriusXM radio station. Amongst his best albums are his 1996 debut album, Dreamin’ Out Loud and second album, Songs About Me, which became a two-times platinum and sold over two million copies. His best singles that have also attained popularity among Country fans are “No Thinkin’ Thing,” “Ladies Love Country Boys,” and “You’re Gonna Miss This.”\n\nPat Green\n\nNet Worth: $3 million\n\nVenture: Dancehall Dreamin’\n\nPat Green has been reinventing himself and his musical style for as long as he’s been in the music industry. The Texas-born singer began his musical career in 1995 and since then has recorded seven studio albums and had fifteen singles appear on the country charts. Although Green’s career had a lot of ups and downs over the years with mostly downs, he’s recently managed to break through into commercial in 2015 after two decades of work.\n\nHis 2015 breakthrough album is entitled Home and managed to snag the number-five spot on the album charts. Previous records have been less successful, with his second-best commercial success being the song “Wave on Wave” which performed better in the charts than all his other singles. His album of the same name also reached the most popularity and acclaim since and has received a gold certification. Green has worked with two labels so far, Republic Records and BNA, and is worth an estimated $3 million.\n\nRonnie Milsap\n\nNet Worth: $14 million\n\nVenture: WB4KCG\n\nWhat happens if you combine Elvis Presley, Elton John, and Johnny Cash into a musical country genius? You need to look no further than the legendary crossover country artist, Ronnie Milsap, who was both a lyrical country genius and a virtuous pianist. Milsap has amassed a multi-millionaire net worth through sales of his incredible mix of soul and country to create iconic hits such as “Stranger in My House” and “Smoky Mountain Rain.”\n\nThe 75-year-old artist was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2014 and received six Grammy Awards throughout his five-and-a-half decades of music. He was also the recipient of numerous awards and recognitions such as Male Vocalist of the Year, Album of the Year, Entertainer of the Year and Best Male Country Vocal Performance.

Outside of his musical career, Milsap is an amateur radio operator and his call sign is WB4KCG.\n\nMontgomery Gentry\n\nNet Worth: $10 million\n\nVenture: 20 Years of Hits\n\nThe mix of Eddie Montgomery and Troy Gentry has to go down as one of the most iconic and brilliant ideas in history. The two country stars, Eddie Montgomery and Troy Gentry decided to kick things together and formed a classic duo in 1991. They decided to give up fancy names and simply call it Montgomery Gentry. The successful country-rock band gathered a small audience that combined the influence of both singers and also collaborated with other artists like the Allman Brothers and Charlie Daniels. Their success led to a combined net worth of roughly $10 million.\n\nThe band was signed with Columbia Nashville and released six albums during a decade starting from the late ‘90s. The country duo was quite successful and managed to release twenty different singles that have appeared in the country charts. In 2007, the band was hit by a sudden tragedy when Troy Gentry was involved in a fatal helicopter crash. Despite Gentry’s tragic death, Eddie Montgomery still tours under the name of the band to this day.\n\nTrisha Yearwood\n\nNet Worth: $40 million\n\nVenture: Trisha’s Southern Kitchen\n\nTrisha Yearwood is one of our generation’s most talented entertainers and managed to exercise her influence in many of today’s mainstream outlets and topics. Beyond her successful career as a country singer and songwriter, Yearwood is also a popular celebrity chef, actress, author, TV personality and continues to dabble in many other ventures. With a net worth of $40 million and a huge following of fans that love watching her whether she’s singing or cooking, Yearwood has built herself one amazing set of skills that she commercializes perfectly.\n\nThe Georgia-born entertainer started out her journey to fame and fortune in the music industry with her debut song, “She’s in Love with a Boy,” which rocked the charts and became the number-one hit of the time, eventually selling over two million copies. Yearwood then used that fame to launch her career in many other successful directions.

Today Yearwood hosts her TV show, Trisha’s Southern Kitchen.\n\nDarryl Worley\n\nNet Worth: $1.3 million\n\nVenture: Darryl Worley Home Furnishings\n\nThe sweet Darryl Worley is a singer-songwriter and guitarist.

His songs \"Awful, Beautiful Life,” \"I Miss My Friend,\" and \"Have You Forgotten?\" have all reached the number-one spot in the United States charts. He’s a very generous and charitable fellow and annually hosts a charity event called the \"Tennessee River Run” and also founded the Darryl Worley Cancer Treatment Center in his hometown of Savannah, Tennessee.\n\nWorley is a very popular stud and posed nude for the 2007 July issue of Playgirl magazine. His singles reached the number-one spot for three years straight in 2002, 2003 and 2004, and have been consistently successful ever since.

The singer was signed to various labels over the years, including DreamWorks and R&J Records (previously known as Stroudavarious Records.\n\nJon Pardi\n\nNet Worth: $8 million\n\nVenture: Heartache Medication\n\nEven at a young age, Jon Pardi proved his musical and business skills were valuable assets when he formed his own band back when he was still just in high-school. He was born in Dixon, California and left his hometown after finishing high-school in the hopes of becoming a successful singer. The young boy moved to Nashville and found his luck there with the Capitol Nashville label. The young multi-millionaire is also a record producer and has many sets of talents under his sleeves.\n\nPardi has managed to charm the crowds with his laid back neotraditional country singing and brilliantly manages to fuse old traditional styles with the modern tastes of country lovers, bringing both oldies and youngsters together to his tours. So far, Pardi has released two albums and ten singles, with almost all of his singles appearing in the country chart. He is currently working on his latest album, Heartache Medication, which we’re sure will be just as good as the first two (or even better).\n\nJuice Newton\n\nNet Worth: $4 million\n\nVenture: Los Angeles Equestrian Center\n\nJuice Newton’s career began when she was still a little girl, with her mother actively helping her develop various musical skills such as playing the guitar. Over the years her musical style has changed from the focused tunes of classic country music to a more general style of country-pop that many crossover artists engage in these days to reach a broader audience. This caused audiences to label her as a crossover star, a title that some classic country musicians criticize and avoid at all costs.\n\nNewton has received many awards throughout her career which began in 1975. Amongst her proudest musical achievements and recognitions are five Grammy nominations with one win, an Academy of Country Music Award and two back-to-back Billboard artist awards. Her albums have consistently reached platinum and gold status, with the most successful one being her Greatest Hits compilation.\n\nBillie Jo Spears\n\nNet Worth: $1.9 million\n\nVenture: The Estate of Billie Jo Spears\n\nBillie Jo Spears was a popular country star from back in the ‘60s, who was mostly known for her hit song “Mr. Walker It’s All Over”. Widely regarded as the “Queen Mother” of country music by fans and critics alike, Spears had a wonderful streak of singles that became hits on the charts. Her musical career began stagnating and was eventually paused for a few years due to personal reasons — and fans were demanding a comeback.\n\nFollowing a few years of hiatus, Spears managed to surprise everyone when she released her most famous and successful song to date, \"Blanket on the Ground\", which came out in 1975 and became an instant hit. She continued releasing albums into the '80s but her fame and popularity began to fade in the United States, although she was still very popular in the UK and even recorded albums which were almost exclusively released in Britain. She continued her career into her mid 70’s despite persistent medical problems. Spears eventually passed away in 2011 leaving her wonderful music behind for the world to enjoy.\n\nBlanco Brown\n\nNet Worth: $500,000\n\nVenture: The Git Up\n\nOne of our most exciting up-and-comers in this list is Blanco Brown. Representing both the African-American culture and old-school folk American tradition, the singer has managed to combine the two most unlikely genres of rap and country into some of the most engaging and unifying forms of music that we’ve heard in the last few years. If there’s one genre that’s typically associated with more “dirty” themes it would definitely be rap and hip-hop. Brown brilliantly manages to take the best rap and hip-hop have to offer and distill them into an extremely positive country musical experience.\n\nThis young artist from Atlanta appears to be doing exactly the right moves since his works have led him to sell over twenty million records in his very short career so far. If you’re interested in listening to Brown’s music and experiencing some of the best combination of genres that music has to offer, look no further than his hit single The Git Up for some great ear pleasure. The song racked over 50 million views on YouTube and is honestly one of the most interesting pieces of music we’ve heard in a while.\n\nJana Kramer\n\nNet Worth: $2 million\n\nVenture: Dancing with the Stars\n\nWhile you may know Jana Kramer as one of the stars from the ABC’s American dance competition, Dancing with the Stars, or as a young and successful country singer, she’s the first country artist on our list that started out in entertainment as an actress and only then moved on to singing. While many actors dabble in music and singing, Kramer decided to fully embrace the country path and debuted her musical career in 2012.\n\nSo far, the young actress and singer has released two studio albums for her label called “Jana Kramer,” and “Thirty One.” Both albums received very favorable sales and reviews, and have both reached high spots in the charts, with seven singles also reaching the charts. Her two best performing songs to date are “I Got the Boy” and “Why Ya Wanna.” She’s most recognizable as an actress for her role as Alex Dupre in the One Tree Hill TV show and also acted in the low-budget indie horror film, Dead/Undead.\n\nWillie Nelson\n\nNet Worth: $25 million\n\nVenture: Willie’s Reserve\n\nYou may recognize Willie Nelson from various films and TV shows. Despite looking like your favorite uncle during the time he rebelled against your aunt and to prove his independence, Nelson has built a substantial following of fans and a net worth of around $25 million. He is actively involved in poetry and activism, mostly focusing on the topic of legalizing the use of Cannabis.\n\nNelson has also been around for a long time now, and originally signed his first label deal in 1973 with Atlantic Records after growing his fame through folk music. The singer has since changed his tune and focused more on outlaw country music rather than classic American folk, with his most famous album is “Wanted! The Outlaws”. Nelson currently spends his time and wealth on his business which sells marijuana-related products, as-well-as various activism efforts for legalization.\n\nLee Ann Womack\n\nNet Worth: $20 million\n\nVenture: CMT Crossroads\n\nWhen Lee Ann Womack first appeared in the country scene, she was instantly recognized as a modern mix of Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette. The country singer managed to bring fans back to the older days of female country songs with her musical style being deeply rooted in traditional country. When Ann Womack debuted in 1997, she instantly received fame and acclaim for her music. She is best known for the title song “I Hope You Dance” from her debut album, and has managed to achieve quite a lot with a relatively small discography.\n\nWhen Ann Womack released, There’s More Where That Came From, her second album, she was quick to find out that the name was exactly the right fit because it performed just as-well or even better than the first. The traditional country singer took a break in 2008 and only returned to the music scene six years later with the album “The Way I’m Livin”, which sold over six million copies in the US. Ann Womack has definitely built a very impressive career with a relatively low amount of work, compared to other country singers, and currently boasts a net worth around $20 million.\n\nKip Moore\n\nNet Worth: $4 million\n\nVenture: Slowheart\n\nMany fans of the hip Kip Moore don’t know that the singer never really set out to develop a musical career, and to some extent, stumbled into it. When he was younger, Moore would travel as a backpacking nomad and spend most of his time after college surfing in Hawaii while living in his tiny Hut. In 2004, after what we imagine were some really great days of tanning and working on his beach bod, Moore decided to try his luck at singing and moved to Nashville, where he met the successful producer Brett James, who helped him get a label deal with MCA Nashville.\n\nThe surfing singer made his debut in 2012 and his luck just kept going. Moore would go on to receive critical and commercial acclaim for his first album, “Up All Night,” which was the best selling first album of any male country star for both 2012 and 2013, and achieved platinum status by the RIAA shortly after its release. Since then, Moore has released two more albums, “Wild Ones” and “Slowheart”, which both received good amounts of sales and attention, but failed to live up to the levels of success the first album generated. His best singles are, “Young Love,” “Dirt Road,” and “I’m to Blame.”\n\nSawyer Brown\n\nNet Worth: $9 million\n\nVenture: Beach Street Records\n\nIf you've heard of the popular country singer Don King who ruled the '70s and '80s with more than fifteen hit singles in the Billboard charts, you probably remember that he had a band of musicians that toured with him across the US. When the popular singer retired, those musicians chose to stick together and in 1981 they formed Sawyer Brown, the popular country-pop band that was founded by Mark Miller, Gregg \"Hobie\" Hubbard, Bobby Randall, Joe \"Curly\" Smyth and and Jim Scholten.\n\nThe band’s country, rock and pop musical style was an instant hit. The band was such a success that it still plays in nowadays after nearly four decades together. They first competed in the popular TV competition show \"Star Search\" and won the grand prize of $100,000 plus a label deal with Capitol Records. The band went on to release eighteen studio albums and had over fifty songs appear in the Hot Country Songs charts. Their most successful songs to date are \"Step That Step,\" \"Some Girls Do,\" and \"Thank God For You\".\n\nChad Brock\n\nNet Worth: $100,000\n\nVenture: TCN\n\nIf you’re a veteran WCW fan, you’ll probably recognize Chad Brock from his old wrestling days in the mid-'90s. The wrestler was always a signer at heart and moved from Florida to Nashville to try and become a popular country singer. Despite signing a deal with Warner Bros, he didn’t release any music for three years and instead became a WCW wrestler between 1994 and 1996. His wrestling career was quickly dispatched due to an injury that prevented him from wrestling. This was just the push he needed to return to music, as Brock went on to release several albums.\n\nHis debut single, \"Evangeline\" peaked at number 51 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles but his next song, \"Ordinary Life\" became an even more popular hit, reaching the number-three spot on the charts. He has since released three albums which have seen moderate success. His strongest single to date was \"Yes!\" which reached first place on the country music charts. Since then, he has left the music scene to co-host a morning show in Tampa, Florida and eventually announced his desire to run for the United States Senate in 2014.\n\nMark Chesnutt\n\nNet Worth: $7.1 million\n\nVenture: Nada Dinero\n\nOur second neotraditional country singer is Mark Chesnutt, who’s worked with both MCA and Dacca and released over many successful albums throughout his career. The singer-songwriter debuted in 1990 after many years of wanting to take up a musical venture due to his passion for country music. Chesnutt was born in Beaumont, Texas and drew his musical influence from his father, Bob Chesnutt, a popular singer and record producer. He played music from a very young age and dropped out of school to focus on performing, before being taken to Nashville by his father to begin his recording ventures.\n\nBy the late '80s, Chestnut released eight singles that were stitched together into his debut album, \"Doing My Country Thing\". The album was well-received, as were his following three albums which have all managed to attain the Platinum status. Chesnutt has been slowing down a bit in recent years, but still released albums every few years or so. He has released 17 studio albums to date with nine of his singles reaching the number-one spot in the charts. He is highly awarded and even has his own label named Nada Direno.\n\nDarius Rucker\n\nNet Worth: $14 million\n\nVenture: MGC Sports\n\nDarius Rucker is the lead singer of Hootie & the Blowfish and is one of those rare artists that managed to combine different music genres into a beautiful and unique mix, namely, country and R&B. Over the years the band has released five albums and managed to claim six top-40 hits on the Billboard charts. Rucker also has a solo musical career, and already released several Country-R&B songs that have garnered their own audience and fans.\n\nIn his business venture, Rucker is currently focused on sports marketing and is a partner at MGC Sports, which promotes talented athletes across many different sports and provides them with services ranging from marketing to public relations and management.\n\nLynn Anderson\n\nNet Worth: $10 million\n\nVenture: The Lynn Anderson Estate\n\nWhen people look back at classical country music, two figures immediately come to mind — Dolly Parton, the country icon who empowered women all across the United States; and Lynn Anderson, herself a legendary figure in country and music and one of the best vocalists in the genre’s history. Anderson has released many number-one singles throughout her long career and excited the masses with her unique and defying musical style, especially during the ‘60s and ‘70s. Anderson’s most successful song to date is her version of \"Rose Garden\" which is considered as one of the most successful crossover recordings of all time.\n\nAnderson made a much-demanded return in her last few years before passing away in 2015. She enjoyed her last decade touring to sold-out concerts and an unfathomable amount of love, gratitude and praise from fans all across the country. The legendary singer was inducted into the Texas Trail of Fame and ranked 28 in Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Country Artists of All Time.\n\nKenny Rogers\n\nNet Worth: $250 million\n\nVenture: Gambler Chassis Co.\n\nAnother musical Hall of Famer, Kenny Rogers has also become a legendary name in music and especially the country genre. While most musical artists record and release just shy of 100 songs throughout their entire career, Rogers has released over 120 songs that hit the singles chart throughout many genres of music. As the #1 record seller in the United States for more than 3 years, Rogers built a vast fortune of $250 million to his name.\n\nSince launching his career, the iconic singer has sold over 100 million records worldwide and was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. He’s widely considered as one of the most influential musical artists of all time for multiple musical genres, with an obvious emphasis on country, and uses his mastery of guitar, bass, harmonica and fiddle to give the crowd exactly what they need. Outside of music, Rogers is the owner of the Gambler Chassis Company, which manufactures racing cars. Rogers has recently passed away at the age of 82.\n\nKelsea Ballerini\n\nNet Worth: $6 million\n\nVenture: The Voice (as a coach)\n\nA fairly new country star who appeared in the music scene in 2014 is Country-pop artist and songwriter Kelsea Ballerini. The singer, who also works as a coach on The Voice, has managed to build a net worth of $6 million in her musical career which so far has only existed for 5 years. Shortly after her debut, Ballerini signed with Black River Label and proceeded to release her first album, The First Time, which went on to receive positive reviews and decent sales figures.\n\nShortly after, she released a second album called Unapologetically, which unapologetically earned her a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist in 2017. During Ballerini’s short time in the music industry, she has already managed to get seven songs rated in the Hot Country charts with four of them reaching the number-one spot. Quite impressive, especially if you include the fact that she’s often being compared to Wynona Judd and Carrie Underwood for consistently managing to release #1 hit songs. This makes her a very demanded musical talent and shows great things for her future.\n\nMaren Morris\n\nNet Worth: $300,000\n\nVenture: Girls Just Wanna\n\nWeekend The Grammy-winning Maren Morris is a wonderful country artist with a varied pool of talents and musical styles. The singer-songwriter has released some very successful pieces of music, including an album, Hero, which reached number five in the charts and number one in the Top Country Albums list. Her most highly acclaimed and popular song so far has been “My Church” which reached #1 on the Country Digital Chart in 2016.\n\nMorris was born in Texas and also plays the guitar brilliantly. She recently had a few major life events that we’re very excited for — first she signed on to Columbia Nashville label, then released her second album in her debut major album deal. Secondly, and perhaps a lot more exciting, is that she married Ryan Hurd, a fellow popular country singer. The couple has recently announced that Morris is pregnant. Fortunately for the couple, their musical career has already started to blossom and it looks like things are only going to get better from here.\n\nMorgan Wallen\n\nNet Worth: $700,000\n\nVenture: Dig Your Roots Tour\n\nBorn in Tennessee, Morgan Wallen was well on his way to a successful career in baseball and was hoping to reach the MLB. He proved himself as a hardworking and talented individual, and even received a sports scholarship. Everything was going his way until one day, Wallen suffered a sports injury that severely damaged his odds of accomplishing his dream. Wallen chose to go into the music industry instead, and attempt to leave his mark there.\n\nWe were first introduced to Morgan Wallen in the 6th season of NBC’s reality music show, The Voice. Despite falling out in the playoff rounds, the singer-songwriter was quickly picked up by the label Big Loud and has since seen released a studio album and two EPs. He was recently nominated by the Country Music Association as Best New Artist of the Year, but the results are still pending.\n\nJustin Moore\n\nNet Worth: $10 million\n\nVenture: Valory Music\n\nJustin Moore has managed to personify the image of southern “bad boy” and definitely uses it to boost his commercial and popular appeal. The singer-songwriter and guitarist was born in Arkansas and quickly became known for his musical talents and popular appeal with the ladies. Moore was signed to Big Machine label, which constitutes a part of the Valory Music conglomerate. Since debuting a few years ago, the singer has released five albums and amassed a net worth of around $10 million.\n\nMoore has consistently produced hit number-one singles throughout his music career that consists of three studio albums. Some of these singles are “Til My Last Day,” “You Look Like I Need a Drink,” “Small Town USA,” “Lettin the Night Role,” and “If Heaven Wasn’t So Far Away.” His third album, Kinda Don’t Care, also follows along the same bad-boy line (as evident by its title). If you’re into the whole “I’m an awesome guy and I don’t care” thing, this is definitely a singer you should listen to and follow.\n\nJanie Fricke\n\nNet Worth: $10 million\n\nVenture: The Statler Brothers Show\n\nJanie Fricke was one of the most famous country singers during the '80s, she is best remembered for her incredible ballads, including \"Down to My Last Broken Heart\" and \"I'll Need Someone to Hold Me (When I Cry)\". The singer had many number-one singles during the '80s was awarded the Female Vocalist of the Year in 1982, 1983 and 1984 by Country Music Association Awards, Academy of Country Music Awards and Music City News Country respectively. She has received three Grammy nominations for her songs \"What're You Doin' Tonight,\" \"Your Heart's Not in It,\" and She's Single Again.\n\nFricke's rise to fame began after producing a lot of uncredited background work for other artists, including Dolly Parton, Barbara Mandrell, Crystal Gayle, Ronnie Milsap, Lynn Anderson, Tanya Tucker, Conway Twitty and Eddie Rabbitt. Over time, she began to attract attention from interested fans until her 1977 debut. Despite Fricke’s career slowing down considerably since the 2000s, she is still actively involved in the music industry and attends various events. Her 2004 album, \"The Bluegrass Sessions\", was the last major release from the famous singer and songwriter\n\nBarbara Mandrell\n\nNet Worth: $45 million\n\nVenture: Barbara Mandrell & the Mandrell Sisters\n\nFamous actress and singer Barbara Ann Mandrell saw her rise to fame through a bevy of hit songs during the ‘70s and ‘80s. Her most famous songs to date are “Years” and “I Was Country When Country Wasn’t Cool”, although she has had many other successful singles including 1978’s “Sleeping Single in a Double-Bed.” Mandrell’s fame and success as an entertainer and actress peaked when she hosted her own TV show on NBC called Barbara Mandrell & the Mandrell Sisters, which went on to win a Globe nomination and the People’s Choice Award.\n\nShe is considered to be one of the most successful female vocalists in the country during the '70s and '80s, and is still a member of the Grand Ole Opry since 1972. Her former mansion which was located in Whites Creek, Tennessee has turned into a tourist attraction, hotel, restaurant, shooting range and music venue, and was managed by her daughter until 2017. Mandrell also starred in various shows such as Touched By An Angel, Empty Nest, Diagnosis: Murder, Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman, The Commish, Baywatch, Walker, Texas Ranger, and The Rockford Files.\n\nBrad Paisley\n\nNet Worth: $40 million\n\nVenture: San Antonio Stock Show\n\nBrad Paisley is one of the most prolific and popular country singers and guitarists in recent times. With nine albums that have all performed exceptionally well commercially and a record-breaking list of ten singles that all hit #1 in the country charts, Paisley was able to bank around $40 million in just a few years. Paisley was born in Glen Dale, West Virginia and has been commercially active since 1998. He's known to play guitars, bass, mandolin, banjo and dobro.\n\nThe popular singer has received various awards including three Grammys and numerous Artist of the Year, Male Vocalist of the Year, Album of the Year and other awards.

He is a big fan of sports and follows teams such as the NFL's Cleveland Browns.\n\nGarth Brooks\n\nNet Worth: $330 million\n\nVenture: Pearl Records\n\nGarth Brooks is the second best selling solo artist in the world to date, with sales of albums exceeding 148 million in the United States alone. He is a titan in the music industry and fully justifies his net worth that’s in the hundreds of millions. Together with his wife, singer Trisha Yearwood, the two have invested in various successful ventures, including an online music eStore which was bought by Amazon for a large sum of money. He’s also the owner of a Pearl Records label and even played professional baseball for the Kansas City Royals about fifteen years ago.\n\nAs a musician, Brooks has seen unparalleled success, which has even overshadowed the Beatles with seven of his albums getting the ideal and extremely rare diamond rating. His only real competitor as a solo artist is Elvis Presley, the king of rock ‘n roll. Brooks also made the transition into the beloved genre of rock, making him an even rare case of success, as the transition only helped boost his already overwhelming influence and omnipresence.\n\nLucinda Williams\n\nNet Worth: $15 million\n\nVenture: Sweet Old World\n\nLucinda Williams is not your typical country singer. She has been around the block since the late ‘70s and her career has been an incredible ride so far with very high peaks and long periods of silence. Her first few albums, which debuted in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s failed to capture attention and were relative flops. She then released a self-titled record in the late ‘80s with the hit single “Passionate Kisses” that would end up winning her a Grammy award.\n\nWilliams is notorious for working at ever-changing paces and taking her time between albums. Her work only began to receive serious commercial and critical success in the last few years. She has since won three Grammys, been nominated over fifteen times, and was even named \"America's best songwriter\" in 2002 by Time Magazine. Her most successful singles in recent years have been \"Essence,\" \"Righteously,\" and \"Are You Alright?\"\n\nDierks Bentley\n\nNet Worth: $30 million\n\nVenture: The Voice\n\nIf you remember Showtime’s dark comedy-drama series Weeds, you’ll probably recognize Dierks Bentley as the guy who sang the show’s opening theme song. The country music singer has been working with the Capitol Nashville label since 2003 and debuted with his first album, called \"Dierks Bentley\". So far Bentley has released nine studio albums and was nominated for numerous Grammy awards, but hasn’t actually won any yet.\n\nHe was the ACM's Top New Artist of 2004 and has since done a pretty good job maintaining this record. Bentley has hosted a few musical events and also read the final results in season 15 of The Voice. The artist has been touring annually since 2006 and has not missed a single year. He's married to Cassidy Black and lives in Nashville with their three children and dogs Jake and George. What most people don’t know about Bentley is that he’s also a licensed pilot and owns two private airplanes, which add to his $30 million net worth.\n\nSugarland\n\nNet Worth: $20 million\n\nVenture: Bigger\n\nBeing part of a group or band certainly has its benefits and disadvantages. You certainly enjoy the support and cooperation working with other musicians towards a shared goal, but the downside is that sometimes things can get a little crazy. Sugarland is an example of a band’s poor inner-communication leading to a falling out. Originally started as a trio consisting of Kristian Hall, Jennifer Nettles, and Kristian Bush, the band debuted to a strong open and was signed to Mercury Nashville.\n\nIt didn’t take long before trouble started appearing though, as Kristian Hall suddenly left the band. Accounts on the reasons are different on the two sides, with Nettles and Bush claiming that Hall left the group on her own due to stress issues, and Hall claiming that she was effectively kicked out. Hall didn’t waste time and sued the group, a matter which was settled out of court. The biggest musical mark that Sugarland left to date was ironically their debut album “Twice the Speed of Life,” which received a double platinum status by the RIAA.\n\nLoretta Lynn\n\nNet Worth: $65 million\n\nVenture: Loretta Lynn Ranch\n\nBorn before World War II, Loretta Lynn is certainly a soul that’s still very much infused with the simplicity and charm of older and more traditional times. She was born in Kentucky and became a household name for everything country related. The veteran singer is still touring occasionally at 87-years of age but no longer records new music. If you’re interested in her life story, we highly recommend that you check out the Oscar-winning biographical drama film Coal Miner’s Daughter, which effectively takes you through her incredible life journey.\n\nLynn is a highly acclaimed singer and loved by many. She’s the owner of the Loretta Lynn Ranch, which sells attire and merchandise related to her wonderful brand. She’s certainly one of a kind, and if you’ve never heard her hit songs “Don’t Come Home,” “You Ain’t Woman Enough,” and her amazing “Coal Miner’s Daughter,” now would be a good time to take a listen. You definitely want to catch Lynn performing live while the opportunity still exists.\n\nDottie West\n\nNet Worth: $3 million\n\nVenture: Coca-Cola\n\nDottie West was one of the female pioneers in country music, with a nearly perfect record of hit singles and albums that launched her career into fame and success. She is often compared to Loretta Lynn and Patsy Cline, and is widely considered as one of the leading female singers that helped open the field for many other female country singers to come. Her debut song “Here Comes My Baby Back Again” was released in the ‘60s to massive critical and commercial success. It was immediately put in the Top 10 ranking in the country charts and West even received a Grammy for it, making her the first female country singer to ever win the prestigious award.\n\nFollowing her rise to fame, West struck a deal with Coca-Cola that ended up being another huge success. She wrote and recorded the iconic song “Country Sunshine” which became the company’s jingle for many years to come. The song also reached the #2 spot in the charts and helped propel her even further to critical acclaim. West then partnered with country icon Kenny Rogers and released a series of duets which helped her soar into even taller heights. The legendary singer's music is now considered the standard for great country music and she was recently posthumously inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nEddie Rabbitt\n\nNet Worth: $3 million\n\nVenture: Days of Our Lives\n\nRock and country musician Eddie Rabbit was born in Brooklyn and began his musical career after watching his father, a successful accordionist and fiddle-player, and becoming motivated to achieve and surpass his level of musical success. Rabbit began his musical career writing songs for various country stars, including Kentucky Rain for Elvis and Ronnie Milsap’s hit, “Pure Love,” in 1974. When Eddie Rabbit went into singing on his own, he was instantly recognized for having a unique style of country that mixed country and rock. The singer also acted in the famous soap operas Days of Our Lives and All My Children.\n\nRabbit passed away in 1998 due to a long battle against cancer, but the news was not published until after his burial at the request of his family. His most successful songs to date are \"Suspicions,\" \"I Love a Rainy Night,\" and \"Kentucky Rain\". Eddie Rabbit was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1998, the same year of his passing.\n\nAshley McBryde\n\nNet Worth: $1 million\n\nVenture: Girl Going Nowhere\n\nAshley McBryde, considered by many fans to be the pride of Arkansas, was originally discovered and presented to the world by popular country singer Eric Church who invited her to perform her song “Bible and a .44”. Often admired for her honesty and good-hearted performances, McBryde struck a chord with the audience and developed a big fanbase of loving admirers.\n\nMcBryde has released two albums before being signed in her first big label deal with Warner Music Nashville. The album’s names are “Expensive Guitars” and “Jalopies”. She was recently nominated for a Grammy and her song “A Little Dive Bar” is widely considered to be one of the best country songs of the year. The singer has a net worth of around $1 million, which is likely to increase dramatically as her fame and discography keeps growing over the years.\n\nAlison Krauss\n\nNet Worth: $16 million\n\nVenture: Rounder Records\n\nWith a net worth of $16 million, Alison Kraus is showing young men and women that all you need to have a great career is talent and lots of hard work. Krauss is a versatile and multi-skilled musician with an angelic voice and control of various instruments from the piano to fiddles and mandolins. Kraus definitely did well on the commercial side with many of her songs being made directly for iconic film soundtracks. She’s contributed to films such as O Brother, Where Art Thou by the Coen Brothers and Cold Mountain by Anthony Minghella.\n\nKrauss has nominated multiple times for the Oscars thanks to her incredible soundtrack songs and even decided to form her own label, called Rounder Label during a peak moment in her career, in order to make sure she has complete sovereignty over the content of her music. It looks like she’s got the incredible potential for the next few decades ahead of her, and you can be sure we’ll be rooting for her to appear on our next list with a nine-figure net worth and more amazing stories to tell.\n\nGloriana\n\nNet Worth: $500,000\n\nVenture: Emblem Records\n\nBack in 2008, singer and expert mandolin player Cheynne Kimball decided to go from solo artist to band member and promptly founded Gloriana, a country group starring Rachel Reinert and brothers Tom Gossin and Mike Gossin. The band has produced three albums, with the first two reaching second place on the US charts. Their two most commercially successful songs \"(Kissed You) Good Night\" and \"Wild at Heart\" respectively reached platinum and gold status.\n\nThe band has been well received from the very beginning, winning the American Music Awards' Breakthrough Artist of the Year. Since their strong and critically acclaimed debut, the band's commercial success has been declining quite rapidly, with the first album, “Gloriana,” standing at 235,000 sales, the second, “A Thousand Miles Left Behind” at 118,000, and the third, simply called “Three”, at an estimated 40,000 sales. The group was effectively disbanded after the release of their third album.\n\nGretchen Wilson\n\nNet Worth: $4 million\n\nVenture: Country Bands Together\n\nIf you’re looking for a classic country singer to listen to during long road trips and drives, look no further than the beautiful and very talented Gretchen Wilson. The country singer made her debut with a Grammy-winning single called “Redneck Woman” and has consistently produced award-winning albums and songs ever since.\n\nHer most successful album to date, \"Here for the Party\" has been awarded five-times Multi-Platinum status by the RIAA for exceeding sales of five million copies. Wilson’s debut single “All Jacked Up” is considered to be one of the best female debut singles in history. In her relatively short time in the music industry, Wilson has made a few million dollars and became a sponsor of a women’s softball league in Pierron, Illinois. She was arrested last year for causing a public disturbance at the Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, but has otherwise stayed away from mischief and trouble.\n\nLuke Combs\n\nNet Worth: $1.2 million\n\nVenture: This One’s For You\n\nIt took Luke Combs three different EPs before finally hitting the sweet point of commercial success and reaching the top spots in the Billboard Charts. His third EP, Hurricane, was the catalyst for his recent label deal with Columbia records. Since then, Combs has released a full studio album in 2017 titled This One's for You that managed to climb to the number one spot.\n\nHis first two EPs, The Way She Rides and Can I Get an Outlaw, were not as successful as the releases that followed. Combs has since gone back to his roots in EPs and released a fourth EP just recently this year called The Prequel which sold almost four times better than the previous one which catapulted him to fame. Combs is a perfect example of how powerful persistence and improvement are. These traits have helped the 30-year-old singer build a net worth of over $1 million.\n\nLee Brice\n\nNet Worth: $6 million\n\nVenture: Curb Records\n\nThe singer-songwriter Lee Brice recently broke a massive record that lasted for over 6 decades by having his single, “Love Like Crazy,” spend 55 weeks on the country music charts. The 40 year old country artist from South Carolina started his musical career in 2007 and has since released four successful studio albums called \"Love Like Crazy,\" \"Hard to Love,\" \"I Don't Dance,\" and \"Lee Brice\". He was nominated nine times for various musical awards including Top New Artist and Best Song but has yet to win an award. The South-Carolina born artist is estimated to be worth over $5 million.\n\nBrice has written many songs for many popular country artists between 2006 and 2016. In 2013, Brice married his longtime girlfriend Sara Nanette Reeveley. The couple have three children named Takoda, Ryker and Trulee. with his most successful compositions being Eli Young's \"Crazy Girl\", 2011's top country song and Brook's \"More Than a Memory\", which debuted at number one on the country charts.\n\nJason Aldean\n\nNet Worth: $80 million\n\nVenture: Buck Commander\n\nKnown by many as one of the best guitarists in the country music space, Jason Aldean has managed to create his own small empire with a fortune of over $80 million over his career. The country star has mostly stuck to traditional country values, both in his personal life and musical career. Aldean is also the owner of a hunting and fishing gear label named “Buck Commander” that’s based on his likeness and brand.\n\nAldean was able to organize and invest in this business through the large income he receives from album sales. He’s apparently even more popular than you might think, with his 2010 album My Kinda Party receiving the super rare quadruple-platinum certification by RIAA (which is a super-duper cool certificate). Various of his other albums also reached platinum and double-platinum statuses.\n\nCole Swindell\n\nNet Worth: $3 million\n\nVenture: The Reason to Drink Tour\n\nCole Swindell is a singer and songwriter who debuted his career as a solo country singer in 2013, after a full three years of songwriting for other popular country artists such as Thomas Rhett, Scotty McCreery, Luke Bryan and Craig Campbell. Swindell has released three albums so far and is signed with the prestigious Warner Bros. Records label in their Nashville branch. His latest tour, Reason to Drink, was criticized for its title which according to many promotes alcoholism. He’s currently touring alongside famous country artist Dierks Bentley.\n\nSwindell has released nine singles so far with seven of them making it to number-five or higher on the country charts. He has over a million likes on Facebook and managed to become a multi-millionaire in his mid-thirties. In 2015, Swindell won the Best New Artist of the Year by the Academy of Country Music Awards.

Born in Keiser, Arkansas, the talented young Bruce quickly caught the attention of Sam Phillips, the founder of Sun Records, and began writing and recording various songs for him. Bruce then proceeded to do voice-overs for TV shows and radio commercials, and finally debuted his first single in 1969 to moderate success. The aspiring singer finally made big progress when he released \"Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys\", a song which he wrote with his wife. The song reached the Top 20 charts and his career began improving quickly from there.\n\nBruce has released over 20 studio albums to date, with the most popular and commercially successful being his 1980 self-titled album.

Often referred to as the “First Lady of Country Music”, she helped during the ‘60s and ‘70s to pioneer much of the popularity of the folk American genre, with music that touched every person in the United States on topics such as the hardships of maintaining loving relationships and the effects of loneliness on the soul. Wynetta is often compared with some of the greats in the genre like Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn.\n\nWynetta hit her peak popularity between the ‘60s and the late ‘70s with songs like “D-I-V-O-R-C-E” that were massively popular before anyone has even heard of country-pop. With twenty singles reaching number one in the charts, this iconic and legendary singer was truly one of the best 20th century had to offer. If you’re interested in experiencing the magic of Tammy Wynette, you should listen to her hit song “Stand By Your Man”, or visit the Tammy Wynette Legacy Park Tremont, Mississippi that was constructed in honor of the woman who touched millions with her voice.\n\nGreg Bates\n\nNet Worth: $200,000\n\nVenture: The Highway\n\n(Sirius XM) American country singer Greg Bates has had a fairly short-lasting musical career that mostly appeared between 2012 and 2013. He released his first single, \"Did It for the Girl\", which debuted at number 57 on the Hot Country Songs chart in 2012. The song was well received and was praised for being simple and memorable.\n\nBates was born in Brentwood and moved to Nashville to better position himself for a country music career. He then got his music degree from Belmont University, which led to his signing a record contract with Republic Nashville a year later in 2011. Bates has since parted with the label after releasing two singles, \"Did It for the Girl\" and \"Fill in the Blank\", and also an extended play which all did moderately well financially and critically. He has since been fairly quiet and we've not heard too much from the country singer except for his marriage in 2015 to girlfriend Shelley Skidmore.\n\nKacey Musgraves\n\nNet Worth: $10 million\n\nVenture: Golden Hour\n\nThe beautiful and talented Grammy-winning Kacey Musgraves has managed to grab attention for her unique musical style right from the start of her musical career.
