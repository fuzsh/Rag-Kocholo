        "text": "Disaster-blaster Roland Emmerich serves us up another of the globally apocalyptic extravaganzas he has made his own, applying his trademark CGI wrecking ball to various iconic buildings. The statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio takes a tumble and an awful crack appears in the Sistine Chapel ceiling, running directly between the fingers of God and Man. Oh lordy. As ever in Hollywood pictures with urgent \"international\" settings, the opening scene is set somewhere in Notamericaistan, where the first signs of trouble are detected.\n\nThen we whisk to the real action: the West Wing. A copper mine is overheating somewhere in a far-off country. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays an earnest government scientist who realises that the earth's core temperature is overheating, as apparently smugly predicted by the ancient Mayans. It has incidentally zilch-all to do with global warming. Anyway, the world is going to end – in 2012! Thus substantially buggering up the London Olympics and all our medal-table hopes! This grave implication is sadly given scant mention here, but law and order breaks down all over the world as the earth's crust starts to bulge and crack, and for the anarchy in London, Emmerich appears to reuse old footage of the 1990 poll tax riots.\n\nThe star is John Cusack, playing a divorced novelist and author of some whinging yet inspiringly influential work about humanity and peace. Downbeat performers like him are important to counterweight the grandiloquent action with sympathetic quirkiness and ordinariness. For Cusack, the catastrophe is a valuable way of reuniting his family and moreover effecting a guilt-free removal of his ex-wife's new husband. Danny Glover is the US president who elects to stay with his doomed people on earth, rather than get on board the exit \"ark\" – like a captain going down with the ship. The only other world leader who takes this noble course is, I am sorry to say, the Italian prime minister. Somehow I can't imagine Silvio Berlusconi being quite so noble. The British prime minister has no qualms about scrambling aboard the rescue ship and the same goes for our queen. Her mother's famous Blitz spirit of not leaving London in a crisis seems not to have been inherited.\n\nYet when the catastrophe hits, when the buildings crash, and the seas engulf high mountains, one aspect of normal life still continues. Characters are still making contact via their mobile phones! Now, whatever network these people are with – I want to join. Are they on a contract or pay-as-you-go? How marvellous that with the earth literally falling apart, this mobile phone company is still providing a service.\n\nThis is a wildly over the top anthology of disaster pictures old and new, and Emmerich isn't above recycling other people's ideas. But it's enjoyable and the opening CGI thrill-ride through the collapsing streets of Los Angeles is undeniably good."
