        "text": "Next summer we'll most likely see both John Cusack and Chiwetel Ejiofor on the biggest posters, standing at odd angles and staring off into the distance. Cusack and Ejiofor have just been cast in Roland Emmerich's giant summer blockbuster movie 2012. We've featured this project before, but now it's got some faces. 2012 is an apocalyptic natural disaster movie set in 2012 about an academic researcher who opens a portal into a parallel universe and makes contact with his double in order to prevent an apocalypse predicted by the ancient Mayans. With Cusack and Ejiofor now on board, I really hope this will be something special, and not another The Day After Tomorrow or 10,000 BC.\n\nEmmerich and crew will begin shooting this July in Los Angeles for a July 10th, 2009 release. If you're curious to read more about the 2012 apocalypse according to the Mayan calendar, we wrote an extensive look at the conspiracy theory back in early March. The original screenplay was said to have \"more going for it than the big idea that studios love\" and ended up in the hands of Sony after an intense bidding war. It now is apparent that the ideas in the film involve a parallel universe twin on top of the entire apocalypse that threatens all of mankind. This movie is going to be big!\n\nI'm a big fan of both John Cusack and Chiwetel Ejiofor, but moreso Ejiofor. I hope this is his big break, because he's highly underrated and needs a chance to really shine. Unfortunately this seems like much more of a paycheck project for Cusack than it does anything else. I can't even really see him being the big budget apocalyptic savior - can you? I just keep crossing my fingers and hoping this is as good as it all sounds, but worried that Emmerich is just on a downward spiral. How does 2012 sound to you now that Cusack and Ejiofor have been cast?"
