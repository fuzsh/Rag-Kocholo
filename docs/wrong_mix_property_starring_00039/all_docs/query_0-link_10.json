        "text": "The Mayans have a prophecy that the world is going to end in 2012. In 2009, geologist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) travels to India and notices an increased occurrence sunspots and solar flares. He flies to Washington and tells Presidential advisor Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt) what is happening and the potentially tragic consequences for the country and the world. Anheuser starts to create an evacuation and government continuation plan for world leaders involving arks located in China but no one in the government tells anyone outside the inner circle anything about the coming catastrophe.\n\nJackson Curtis (Cusack) is a divorced father of two kids, part time chauffeur, full time failed author, takes his kids on a camping trip to Yellowstone National Park where he meets end of the world prophet Charlie Frost (Woody Harrelson) Charlie is convinced that the world is going to end and tells Jackson that he knows where the evacuation ships are because he’s got the maps. Jackson mostly thinks he’s a nut, but then realizes that the nut might have a point when earthquakes start roiling California and Governor Schwarzenegger tells everyone the worst is over . He drives his limo full speed to his ex-wife Kate’s (Amanda Peet) house picks up the kids and tries to get out of California. Then the really big earthquakes begin. Jackson goes back to Yellowstone, gets a map from Charlie, and tries to make his way to China with his kids and her currant boyfriend Gordon (Tom McCarthy) who just happens to know how to fly a plane. Jackson’s current employer Yuri Karpov Zlatko Buric gets Jackson a plane to fly. Does he make it to China? Does he make it to the ark?\n\nThis movie is an all too formulaic disaster movie is the mold of the Poseidon Adventure and Independence Day. Cusack is always one step ahead of being swallowed alive by mother earth, Amanda Peet’s boyfriend has two whole flying lessons and he flies like a stunt pilot, Cusack is a part-time chauffer, but he turns into the best driver in the world. The president is black, which always seems to be the case in these end-of-the world movies. See Morgan Freeman in Deep Impact. What is Hollywood trying to tell us anyway? The story is so formulaic, and trite that the viewer knows exactly who’s going to die and when. John Cusack is all wrong for this movie, he should be making sophisticated films, this movie screams out for Nicholas Cage playing the lead. Isn’t he in all these nutty conspiracy theory movies lately? Daanny Glover looks old and tired, like he IS a couple of days from retirement, it’s nice to see Thandie Newton and Woody Harrelson in this movie, but they don’t belong in this movie. They all try very hard, but it’s a god-awful 2 ½ hours long and it didn’t need to be. There were about 10 subplots going on. The geologist has a thing for Thandie, the geologists father is a jazz singer with George Segal on a cruise ship. George Segal’s son is estranged from him because he married a Hispanic girl Who the f— cares? Unnecessary, most of them die anyway, and the viewer knows it. The ending is pure Hollywood milquetoast. I just felt empty after watching it, empty and bored\n\n2012: Yours, Mayan, and Ours."
