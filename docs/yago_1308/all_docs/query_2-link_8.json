After months of speculation, Scout revealed the reason why her stepmom was stuck in California.\n\n“My stepmom was going to come up here too with my little sisters,” she explained in April 2020 during her “Dopey” podcast. “[But] my younger sister … [who has] never gotten a talk about not f–king with hypodermic needles … she found [needles at a park and] she actually tried to poke her shoe with it and poked her foot. So my stepmom had to be in L.A. waiting to, like, get the results for taking her to the doctor. My dad came up here early and then travel got crazy and my stepmom stayed in L.A. with my little sisters.”\n\nOne month later, Heming Willis reunited with her family.\n\nCredit: Craig 'Crash' Hattori/Imagespace/Shutterstock\n\nMarch 2022\n\nThe blended Moore/Willis family announced that the Red star was diagnosed with aphasia and planned on retiring from acting.\n\n\"To Bruce's amazing supporters, as a family we wanted to share that our beloved Bruce has been experiencing some health issues and has recently been diagnosed with aphasia, which is impacting his cognitive abilities,” the women wrote via Instagram alongside a photo of her husband. “As a result of this and with much consideration Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him.\"\n\nCredit: Courtesy Emma Heming/Instagram\n\nMay 2022\n\nThe Malta native opened up about how she was faring two months after sharing her husband’s diagnosis.\n\n“I put my family’s needs above my own, which I found does not make me any kind of hero,” Heming Willis said during an interview with The Bump. “That amount of care for everyone else within my household had taken a toll on my mental health and overall health. And it served no one in my family.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Demi Moore/Instagram\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nLess than one year after announcing the Armageddon actor’s diagnosis, the family shared\n\n“Since we announced Bruce’s diagnosis of aphasia in spring 2022, Bruce’s condition has progressed and we now have a more specific diagnosis: frontotemporal dementia (known as FTD),” Moore, Heming Willis and their respective daughters wrote in a statement. “Unfortunately, challenges with communication are just one symptom of the disease Bruce faces. While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Emma Heming Willis/Instagram\n\nMarch 2023\n\nHeming Willis shared a sweet tribute to her husband on his 68th birthday. \"He is pure love. He is so loved. And I'll be loving him always. Happy Birthday my sweet 💌,\" she wrote via Instagram. \"My birthday wish for Bruce is that you continue to keep him in your prayers and highest vibrations because his sensitive Pisces soul will feel it 🙏🏽 Thank you so much for loving and caring for him too 💞.\"\n\nAt the time, she told fans via her Instagram Story that she spent the morning crying amid his health battle. \"Sometimes in our lives, we have to put our big girl panties on and get to it, and that's what I'm doing,\" she said. \"But I do have times of sadness every day, grief every day and I'm really feeling it today on his birthday.\"\n\nCredit: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nMarch 2023\n\nOn the couple's 14th wedding anniversary, Heming Willis expressed her gratitude for a friend's \"act of kindness\" that helped her commemorate the occasion.\n\n\"Today marks 14 years of marriage to the greatest love of my life. ... In passing at a school event for our children, I mentioned to my friend that our anniversary was tomorrow. Cut to, I get a text from my friend later that day that said she left 'a little something' for me at my door. It was this sweet bouquet of flowers,\" the actress wrote via Instagram alongside a photo of the floral arrangement.\n\nHeming Willis noted that special occasions can be \"hard\" on caregivers as \"usually our person would acknowledge the event\" but \"now their changing brains just can't.\" She encouraged her followers to extend similar kindness to the caregivers in their own lives.\n\n\"If you know someone that is looking after someone else, don’t ask what you can do, just do,\" she wrote.\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Instagram/Emma Heming\n\nMarch 2023\n\nHeming reflected on her 2019 vow renewal with her husband by sharing sweet video footage from the special occasion amid the actor's battle with dementia.\n\n“On our 10th wedding anniversary we decided to renew our vows in the same place we said ‘I do’ back in 2009,” she wrote via Instagram alongside a video from the big day. “I’m so happy we did. Seize every opportunity to unite and celebrate with family and friends. Those are the moments and beautiful pockets of memories that you get to hold on to for a lifetime. And we get to keep those memories safe and alive for the ones that might not be able to 💌.”\n\nThe heartwarming clip, which showed the pair exchanging vows while the family cheered them on, was shot by Moore. Rumer and Scout performed a song for the intimate occasion while Mabel and Evelyn served as flower girls. Stephen Eads, who married the duo back in 2009, once again served as officiant.\n\nCredit: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images\n\nDecember 2023\n\nHeming Willis shared a few snaps posing alongside Bruce as they celebrated a relationship milestone.\n\n“16 years with this special man,” she wrote via Instagram alongside two photos of the pair kissing each other on the cheek. “My love and adoration for him only grows.”\n\nShe shared the same pics via her Instagram Story, writing, “16 years together!? Lord where did the time go.” In another Instagram Story post, she included a photo of her and Bruce kissing and wrote, “Sweet 16.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Emma Heming Willis/Instagram\n\nFebruary 2024\n\nHeming Willis shared a heartwarming tribute to her husband via Instagram for Valentine’s Day.\n\n“Love is a beautiful thing ❤️,” she captioned a photo of herself and Bruce sharing an embrace at Niagara Falls. “Wishing you all a Happy Valentine’s Day 🫶🏽.”\n\nTo celebrate the holiday, Heming Willis spoke about navigating love and dementia and her relationship with Bruce at Hilarity for Charity’s virtual CareCon event. Advertised as an event to “spread love and support to care partners this Valentine’s Day,” Heming Willis expressed her excitement — and her nerves — about participating in the panel via her Instagram Story.\n\n“Happy Valentine’s Day. I’m so excited to take part in my first CareCon,” she said. “I am gripped with fear right now. I’m not great at speaking live anyway, let alone talking about love and dementia, so, I will do my best.”"
