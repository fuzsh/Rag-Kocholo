        "text": "Bruce Willis' wife Emma Heming Willis has shared some incredibly rare snaps of their kids amid the actor's health battle.\n\nThe 68-year-old Die Hard actor shares three daughters - Rumer, 35, Scout, 32, and Tallulah, 30 - with his ex-wife, Demi Moore, and two daughters - Mabel, 12, and Evelyn, 9 - with his wife, Emma.\n\nThe beloved actor was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (better known as FTD) at the start of 2023. His health battle was first unveiled the year prior though, when Bruce's family revealed that he was suffering from a language disorder called aphasia. In October 2023, filmmaker Glenn Gordon Caron told Page Six that the star was \"not totally verbal\" anymore.\n\nAnd now Emma has shared a sweet Instagram post that features her and Bruce's daughters enjoying Fourth of July celebrations despite the family dealing with Bruce's ill-health. Taking to Instagram to share a selection of snaps, Emma penned: \"Happy 4th of July,\" adding a side note that read: \"*and if you don’t have cowboy boots, just put your snow boots on, it’s fine.\"\n\nIn the selection of snaps, Emma and Bruce's two daughters were seen standing with their mum in matching denim looks and cowboy hats. The second snap then saw them walking away, looking back and smiling.\n\nThe third photo was a smiley snap of Emma wearing her cowboy hat. And the fourth offering was a short video clip that saw the couple's daughters lining a sidewalk while watching a patriotic parade of people on horses carrying American flags.\n\nBack in October, it was revealed that Bruce is now \"not totally verbal\" after his heartbreaking dementia diagnosis. Glenn Gordon Caron, a film creator who worked with Bruce in the 80s spoke to Page Six last year and said: \"My sense is the first one to three minutes he knows who I am.\n\n\"He’s not totally verbal; he used to be a voracious reader - he didn’t want anyone to know that - and he’s not reading now.\" Glenn then went on to add: \"All those language skills are no longer available to him, and yet he’s still Bruce.\"\n\n\"When you’re with him you know that he’s Bruce and you’re grateful that he’s there, but the joie de vivre is gone,\" he added."
