        "text": "Emma Heming Willis has been opening up about her relationship with her Holllywood superstar husband Bruce Willis and her role as his caregiver.\n\nThe devoted wife of the Die Hard star has been busy giving interviews this week to help promote awareness of the condition that has left the whole Willis family struggling to cope. Many have been surprised to see Emma's youthful appearance as she steps in to the limelight to help promote the devastating effects of Frontotemporal Dementia to the wider public.\n\nEmma, 45, has in fact been married to 68-year-old Bruce for over 14 years with the couple tying the knot back in 2009 when she was 31. The couple first met back in 2007 several years on from the break down of Bruce's relationship with ex Demi Moore with whom he shares three daughters - Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .\n\nBruce and model and actress Emma met through a mutual friend at the time and very quickly became besotted with one another. In 2009 the happy couple wed at a civil ceremony in Beverly Hills. Among their wedding guestlist at their 2009 ceremony was Demi Moore and her then-husband Aston Kutcher. Bruce and Demi's three daughters also came to their dad's wedding.\n\nIn 2012 Bruce and Emma welcomed their first daughter together, Mabel, and in 2014 Emma gave birth to their second child Evelyn. Since then Emma has been documenting her adorable family life all over social media and after 10 years of marriage Bruce and Emma decided to renew their vows in 2019.\n\nSpeaking at the time of her wedding vow renewal, Emma had nothing but praise for her doting husband. She told US Weekly: \"I think we've always had a lot of respect for each other, which has really helped build a great foundation. He makes me laugh. He's funny and he's smart, and nuts, and always keeps me on my toes, so it's fun.\"\n\nOnce again, Bruce's best pal Demi was also at their wedding renewal ceremony, marking her approval of the loved-up couple. Emma and Demi share a mutual respect for each other and the couple admitted they wouldn't do their renewals without Demi at the vow renewals.\n\nAt the time she said: \"She welcomed me into her family like I welcomed her into ours. I have so much respect for her. I have so much respect for how Bruce and Demi worked through their divorce to be able to put their children first. I learned so much from that and grew so much from watching that. It was important for her to be there. She was at our first wedding. I loved having her there again. I wouldn't do it without her.\"\n\nBruce and Emma then embarked on a marriage full of adventures with their daughters travelling to exotic locations and stepping out to a variety of events together. However, their world came crashing down in March 2022 when Bruce's family announced that he would be stepping away from acting after being diagnosed with brain condition aphasia.\n\nThen in February 2023 they revealed the crushing news that he had been diagnosed with Frontotemporal Dementia. Emma has since become Bruce's care partner meaning she provides him with all the support he needs to cope with his condition to the best of her ability while also keeping track of her own self-care.\n\nEmma has recently admitted to the strain the illness has put on the whole family and her guilt over taking any time for herself while she is caring for Bruce. She told TODAY: \"Dementia is hard. It’s hard on the person diagnosed, it’s also hard on the family. And that is no different for Bruce, or myself, or our girls. When they say this is a family disease, it really is.\"\n\nDuring the chat Emma also shared her love for Bruce through his struggles calling him \"the gift that keeps on giving,\" and admitting that he has taught their daughters Mabel and Evelyn, important personality traits like \"love, patience and resilience.\" She added: \"It's teaching them so much and how to care and love, and it’s really a beautiful thing amongst the sadness.\""
