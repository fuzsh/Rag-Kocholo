In her post, the 45-year-old was seen spending some quality time with Zorina as they treated themselves to a delicious hibachi dinner at Benihana in front of a flaming grill.\n\nIn the short clip, Zorina was all smiles as Emma panned the camera over to her while an electric relaxation tune played in the background. Emma sweetly captioned the story: \"Make time for some fun with your mommy at Benihana. It really never disappoints.\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Madonna proudly supports son Rocco Ritchie’s art exhibition with paintings priced at £20k\n\nEmma's latest post comes as she continues to dedicate her time caring for her husband Bruce was he struggles with his ongoing battle with dementia. The beloved Die Hard actor was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (better known as FTD) last spring. His health battle was first announced the year prior when his family revealed he was suffering from a language disorder called aphasia.\n\nPatients that suffer from the condition can experience a number of symptoms including unusual behaviours, emotional problems, trouble communicating, difficulty with work, or difficulty with walking, according to The National Institute on Aging.\n\nHis wife Emma, who he's been married to for 14 years, has been a steady rock for the actor throughout his heath battle, staying by his side every step of the way, while raising awareness to their fans. The couple share two kids together, welcoming Mabel in 2012 and Evelyn in 2014. Bruce also shares three older children with ex-wife Demi Moore including Rumer, Tallulah and Scout.\n\nIn March, Emma expressed her unconditional love for the retired Hollywood star in a heartfelt birthday post. In the post celebrating the Unbreakable star's 69th birthday, she gushed over their romance describing Bruce's arms the \"safest place in this whole wide world\". She went on to add that he was a true \"gentleman\" and was the \"gift that keeps giving\" and still has so much love to share and give to the world."
