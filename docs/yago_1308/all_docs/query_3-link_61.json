        "text": "Emma Heming, wife of Bruce Willis, has been criticized for discussing her husband’s life-altering diagnosis on her Instagram account. In March 2022, Willis’s family announced that the actor, who’d recently starred in a spate of direct-to-video films, had been diagnosed with the brain disorder aphasia and would be stepping back from his work. Then, in February of this year, the family shared that he’d received a more specific diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD).\n\nHeming, who has been married to Willis since 2009 and shares two children with him, made a polite but impassioned plea for paparazzi to stop crowding Willis after he was spotted on a coffee run in Santa Monica. “I know this is your job, but maybe just keep your space. For the video people, please don’t be yelling at my husband, asking him how he’s doing or whatever,” Heming said. “The woo-hooing and the yippee-ki-yays—just don’t do it. Give him the space. Allow for our family or whoever’s with him that day to be able to get him from point A to point B safely. That’s my PSA.”\n\nIn a separate post on Tuesday, she expressed frustration with media outlets that have bought and published paparazzi photos of Willis. “I just want my husband to be able to participate in his life to the fullest,” she said.\n\nThough comments on her account are overwhelmingly supportive, at least one commenter accused Heming of using the situation to promote herself.\n\n“I just saw something about me getting my ‘five minutes,’ which is great, which means that you’re listening,” she said in another Instagram post on Wednesday. “So I’m gonna take my five minutes and I’m gonna turn it into 10, because I’m always gonna advocate for my husband.”\n\nHeming added that she would continue raising awareness around FTD as well as caregivers, the “unsung heroes.” She concluded her video by saying that she plans to turn her grief, anger, and sadness into something positive: “Watch this space, because I didn’t come to play.”\n\nCelebrity\n\nMontel Williams Once Dated Kamala Harris and Now His Social Media Is a Big Mess\n\nThe former TV host’s social media feed has been a real journey in retweeting and deleting.\n\nMovies\n\nLiza Minnelli Is Writing a Memoir Because She’s “Mad as Hell”\n\nIn a statement to People, Minnelli expressed disappointment with other representations of her life and revealed that she’s releasing a memoir set to hit stands in spring of 2026: “It’s my own damn story.”\n\nStyle\n\nBallerina Farm Influencer Hannah Neeleman Says She Doesn’t “Identify” as a Trad Wife\n\nThe Mrs. World competitor and mother of 8 says she doesn’t know “what feminism means any more” but said the one epidural she ever had was “kinda great.”\n\nMovies\n\nThe Dude Is Voting for Kamala Harris\n\nJeff Bridges, star of The Big Lebowski, hopped on the “White Dudes for Harris\" fundraiser call and pledged his support for the Democratic Nominee: \"I’m white, I’m a dude, and I’m for Harris.”"
