        "text": "The model and founder has worked alongside a dementia specialist since Bruce's recent diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia, according to Yahoo Entertainment. She is also looking to spread awareness regarding how to treat people who have dementia while they are in public.\n\nEmma and Bruce have been married since 2009 and share two daughters, Mabel Ray, 10, and Evelyn Penn, 8. Bruce also has three daughters with his ex-wife Demi Moore, Rumer Glenn, 34, Scout LaRue, 32, and Tallulah Belle, 29.\n\nEmma began the video by sharing her intention of \"raising awareness\" around dementia. The model acknowledged how \"difficult\" and \"stressful\" it can be to safely navigate the world with a loved one diagnosed with the condition.\n\nThe actor's wife went on to describe a recent event where Bruce was photographed getting coffee with friends in Santa Monica. Emma appeared to hold back tears as she discussed the situation and asked for space.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"It's clear that there's still a lot of education that needs to be put forth,\" she said in the video. \"So this one is going out to the photographers and the video people that are trying to get those exclusives of my husband out and about: Just keep your space.\"\n\nEmma continued by requesting paparazzi stop yelling at her husband while he's in public.\n\n\"I know this is your job, but maybe just keep your space. For the video people, please don't be yelling at my husband asking him how he's doing or whatever â€” the woohoo-ing and the yippee ki yays ... just don't do it. OK? Give him his space. Allow for our family or whoever's with him that day to be able to get him from point A to point B safely,\" Emma concluded.\n\nIn March 2022, Bruce announced he was taking a break from acting after being diagnosed with aphasia, a language disorder that can affect one's ability to communicate. In February, the Willis family announced his frontotemporal dementia diagnosis."
