        "text": "EMMA Heming has given an intimate glimpse into her relationship with Bruce Willis.\n\nThe model shared a sweet selfie with the actor on Instagram on Thursday as she celebrated 15 years of marriage.\n\nIn the post, Emma, 45, captured a romantic moment with her husband Bruce, 69.\n\nThe shot showed Emma smiling at the camera, while film star Bruce leaned in to share a kiss.\n\nEmma also shared a long caption with the photo, praising her husband and alluding to his battle with dementia.\n\n\"Today marks our 15th wedding anniversary! And today, I can make a choice. I can wallow in sorrow or I can celebrate it. I call this the 'remarkable reframe.' What I know is there is so much to celebrate,\" she wrote.\n\nDescribing her relationship with the Pulp Fiction star, Emma described, \"Our union and connection is probably stronger than ever. We have two bright, fun and healthy daughters. We have a family unit that is built on mutual respect and admiration.\n\n\"And simply, I just love and adore the man I married. I’m so proud of what we have and continue to create. So, happy crystal anniversary to us!\"\n\nIn the comment section, one fan wished, \"Happy Anniversary! Keep letting love be a healer.\"\n\n\"Your positivity and gratitude are inspiring. Happy anniversary to you both,\" wrote a second social media user.\n\nIn February 2023, it was announced that Bruce had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, the most common form of dementia in people under 60.\n\nSymptoms include personality changes, obsessive behavior, and speaking difficulties.\n\nFAMILY FIRST\n\nBruce has five children: two from his current marriage to Emma, and three with his ex-wife Demi Moore, 60.\n\nHis three children with Demi, named Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah, have all gone on to have careers in acting, much like their parents.\n\nHis two children with Emma are Mabel, 11, and Evelyn, 9.\n\nBruce retired from acting in 2022 after being diagnosed with aphasia - the inability to comprehend or formulate language due to damage in parts of the brain - and has been supported by his family throughout his health journey.\n\nWhen you’re with him you know that he’s Bruce and you’re grateful that he’s there, but the joie de vivre is gone.\n\nGlenn Gordon Caron, Director\n\nHEARTBREAKING STRUGGLE\n\nWriter and director Glenn Gordon Caron, who gave Bruce his big break in the '80s sitcom Moonlighting, recently revealed heartbreaking details of the Die Hard legend's current condition.\n\n\"My sense is the first one to three minutes he knows who I am. He’s not totally verbal; he used to be a voracious reader - he didn’t want anyone to know that - and he’s not reading now,\" he told Page Six.\n\n\"All those language skills are no longer available to him, and yet he’s still Bruce.\n\n\"When you’re with him you know that he’s Bruce and you’re grateful that he’s there, but the joie de vivre is gone.\"\n\nBRUCE'S BIRTHDAY\n\nBruce's anniversary came just days after he celebrated his 69th birthday.\n\nFor the big day, many of his family members shared touching posts about the star.\n\nHis ex-wife, Demi, shared a photo of them cuddling up on a couch while chatting, and gushed, \"Happy birthday, BW! We love you and are so grateful for you.\"\n\nShe also added a shot of Bruce and their first granddaughter, Louetta, born to Rumer in April 2023.\n\nRumer herself posted several images from over the years with her dad, and proclaimed him \"the greatest papa.\""
