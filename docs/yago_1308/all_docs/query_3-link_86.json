        "text": "Bruce Willis’ family is keeping him close as he battles dementia.\n\nThe “Die Hard” actor has been spending his days alongside his wife, Emma Heming, ex-wife Demi Moore, and their collective five children.\n\n“Once Bruce was diagnosed, everyone came together to keep his memory of the family intact,” an insider told Us Weekly on Wednesday.\n\n“They’re all there all the time,” the source continued. “This experience has brought the whole family even closer together.\n\n“No one knows how much time Bruce has left, so they’re soaking up every moment they get with him.”\n\nThe insider furthered that everything “revolves around” Willis as he’s had “many more bad days than good” over the past few months.\n\nAnother source added that the four-time Golden Globe winner “has around-the-clock care, but at least one family member is always with him.”\n\nWillis, 68, has also been spending time with his granddaughter, Louetta, whom his daughter Rumer welcomed in April.\n\n“Rumer wants to make sure Louetta knows [Bruce],” the source said. “She wants him to be actively involved in Louetta’s life. It’s a very special bond.”\n\nWillis shares daughters Rumer, 35, Scout, 32, and Tallulah, 29, with Moore, 61, whom he was married to from 1987 to 2000.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nThe “Pulp Fiction” star also shares daughters Mabel, 11, and Evelyn, 9, with Heming, 45.\n\nThe actor and the model tied the knot in March 2009 and renewed their vows on their tenth anniversary, just before Willis’ health woes unfolded.\n\nHis family announced in March 2022 that he had been diagnosed with Aphasia and would be “stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him.”\n\nThe condition can affect a person’s speech, comprehension skills and ability to write, per the Mayo Clinic.\n\nThen, in February 2023, the family revealed his condition worsened with the “cruel” diagnosis of dementia.\n\nSince then, for every holiday, the “Assassin” star has gathered with his daughters, wife and Moore to savor their time together.\n\nWillis most recently celebrated Thanksgiving with his entire family and was seen beaming in a candid group shot posted to Heming’s Instagram."
