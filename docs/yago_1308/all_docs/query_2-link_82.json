        "text": "Bruce Willis‘ wife Emma Heming Willis is ready to chronicle her journey of being a caregiver to husband Bruce Willis.\n\nHeming Willis is set to release a book to share her experience as a care partner to Willis after he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, it was announced Monday.\n\nThe yet-to-be-titled book, to be published in 2025 through The Open Field book imprint helmed by Maria Shriver, will also include interviews and expert advice, “offering a thoughtful, inspiring guide for those seeking support while navigating a loved one’s dementia.”\n\n“For many people, their first touch point about this disease is received in their doctor’s office,” Heming Willis told Shriver’s Sunday Paper. “I think it’s very important how this information from doctor to patient and loved one is relayed. Having resources and information readily available is imperative. I know between my experience and other care partners that I have spoken to; our stories are unfortunately similar. We left that office with close to no resources or support and with a diagnosis that I could hardly pronounce.”\n\nShriver said in a statement, “I’m thrilled to be publishing Emma’s book for caregivers. She and I have known each other for a long time, and I’m so proud of the way she is using her voice to help others. Caregivers are unsung heroes in our society — they need guidance, support, knowledge, along with community and a roadmap. We will be giving them this with this new book from The Open Field. I couldn’t be more excited and proud.”\n\nAfter it is released, Heming Willis hopes her book lands “in the hands of care partners, but especially new care partners, who have just received this life-changing news.” She added, “They should know they are not alone and there is support, even hope. In a perfect world, I envision this book in that doctor’s office, and he or she, puts it in their hands to bring home.”\n\nIn March 2022, Willis’ family revealed the actor had been diagnosed with aphasia after announcing he was stepping away from acting. Almost a year later, the family publicly revealed that they were given “a clear diagnosis” of frontotemporal dementia. Following the diagnosis, members of his family, including daughters Tallulah and Rumer, have opened up about their thoughts and experiences since his diagnosis."
