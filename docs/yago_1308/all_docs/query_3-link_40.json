And today, I can make a choice. I can wallow in sorrow or I can celebrate it,” she shared in an Instagram message. “I call this the ‘remarkable reframe.’ What I know is there is so much to celebrate. Our union and connection is probably stronger than ever. We have two bright, fun and healthy daughters. We have a family unit that is built on mutual respect and admiration.

What you might not know, but maybe you could imagine, that being wrapped in his arms is the safest place in this whole wide world,” Emma captioned a snap of him holding one of his daughters. “He’s a true gentle-man.

There’s all of that. But you start a new chapter,” she said, adding that her family’s life is now filled “with love, it’s filled with connection, it’s filled with joy, it’s filled with happiness.”\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBut Moonlighting creator Glenn Gordon Caron, who is still close with Willis, said that the actor’s love of life is slipping away as his dementia progresses rapidly.\n\n“The thing that makes [his disease] so mind-blowing is [that] if you’ve ever spent time with Bruce Willis, there is no one who had any more joie de vivre than he,” Caron told the New York Post last fall. “He loved life and … just adored waking up every morning and trying to live life to its fullest … When you’re with him you know that he’s Bruce and you’re grateful that he’s there, but the joie de vivre is gone.”\n\nmdaniell@postmedia.com\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nBruce Willis 'not totally verbal' amid dementia decline, pal says: 'The joie de vivre is gone'\n\nBruce Willis' ex Demi Moore and wife Emma Heming celebrate his birthday\n\nEmma Heming Willis blasts claim Bruce Willis has 'no more joy'\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
