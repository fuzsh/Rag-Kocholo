        "text": "Bruce Willis' wife, Emma Heming, has shared a touching message in honour of her 46th birthday.\n\nThe emotional post reflected on how the Die Hard star used to celebrate her birthday before his dementia diagnosis.\n\nThe Instagram video showed a montage of Heming's birthday celebrations, revealing she planned to celebrate it the same way Willis would have.\n\n\"Bruce would call it my 'birthday month.' So we must celebrate,\" her post began.\n\nREAD MORE: Bill and Melinda Gates' daughter expecting her second child\n\nREAD MORE: Country star dies after 'tremendous pain, unthinkable loss'\n\n\"I'm blessed and grateful to have family and friends (in this video and afar) who made it so special for me all month long ðŸ¥°.\n\n\"There's still a few days left of June and I'm going to ride this baby out till the end.\"\n\nWillis's family revealed in February 2023 that the actor had frontotemporal dementia (FTD) after the 69-year-old had retired due to his brain disorder, aphasia.\n\nLast year, Heming spoke with Hoda Kotb on the US Today Show on NBC about how the diagnosis has affected the couple and their two daughters.\n\n\"What I'm learning is that dementia is hard. It's hard on the person diagnosed. It's also hard on the family. And that is no different for Bruce or myself or our girls,\" she said. \"And when they say that this is a family disease, it really is.\"\n\nKotb asked Heming Willis if her husband was aware of his condition, to which she responded: \"Hard to know.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Robbie almost ruined chances with wife of 14 years\n\nKotb also asked how the diagnosis had affected Heming Willis.\n\n\"I think it was the blessing and the curse,\" she said, explaining that it is good to finally understand what is happening to him, even though it's still painful.\n\n\"Just being in the know of what is happening to Bruce just makes it a little bit easier,\" she added."
