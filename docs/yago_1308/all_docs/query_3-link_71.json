        "text": "Emma Heming has said that her husband Bruce Willis still lives a life of “love, connection, joy and happiness” following his frontotemporal dementia diagnosis.\n\nHeming shared a video via social media, keen to dismiss false narratives about her husband’s quality of life, stating that she was “clickbaited” by a headline about her family.\n\nDie Hard star Bruce Willis was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia last February.\n\nHe had previously been diagnosed with aphasia the previous year, which saw him quit acting, having experienced issues with words and language.\n\nThe HSE website describes FTD as an umbrella term for a group of dementias which mainly affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. It may affect such things as personality, behaviour, language and speech.\n\n“that is far from the truth” Says Emma Heming\n\nIn a video shared via Instagram, Emma Heming said, “The headline basically says there is no more joy in my husband”.\n\n“Now, I can just tell you, that is far from the truth”, she continued. “I need society – and whoever’s writing these stupid headlines – to stop scaring people”.\n\n“Stop scaring people to think that once they get a diagnosis of some kind of neurocognitive disease that that’s it. ‘It’s over. Let’s pack it up. We’re — Nothing else to see here. We’re done.’ No. It is the complete opposite of that”.\n\n“There is grief and sadness. There’s all of that. But you start a new chapter”.\n\n“love”\n\nEmma Heming insisted that this chapter is full of “with love, it’s filled with connection, it’s filled with joy, it’s filled with happiness”.\n\nShe also hit out at misleading headlines, “That’s where we are. So stop with these stupid headlines. These stupid clickbait-y things that freak people out. Stop doing that. There’s nothing to see here, ok?”.\n\nIn a caption with this post, Heming added, “My experience is that two things can be true and exist at the same time. Grief and deep love. Sadness and deep connection. Trauma and resilience”.\n\n“I had to get out of my own way to get here but once I arrived, life really started to come together with meaning and I had a true sense of purpose. There is so much beauty and soulfulness in this story”.\n\nLast March, Emma Heming also called on the paparazzi to be nice to Bruce in public. More on that story here.\n\nBruce Willis and Emma Heming have been married for 15 years. The actor was previously married to Hollywood star Demi Moore.\n\nAlong with Die Hard, Bruce Willis also starred in The Sixth Sense, and Pulp Fiction."
