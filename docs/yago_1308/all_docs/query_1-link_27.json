Symptoms of the incurable condition are similar to those of Alzheimer's — patients experience memory loss and difficulty understanding and producing language.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmma Heming, now 44, was born on the island of Malta before growing up in London and California.\n\nOn her personal website, she said she lived on the \"small but beautiful\" island of Malta, which lies south of Italy in the center of the Mediterranean Sea, until her parents got divorced when she was a child. Her mother is Guyanese and her father is English, she wrote.\n\nAfter her parents split up, she moved to London and then Southern California with her mother.\n\n\"My mother has been the ultimate guide in my life – she is the rock that I cherish, respect and admire,\" she wrote on her website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn her 20s, she worked as a model, walking catwalks around the world and fronting high-profile designer campaigns.\n\nHeming Willis' modeling career went full force after she won a modeling competition in London, \"The British Elle Supermodel,\" in the early 1990s.\n\n\"For the next 15 years I had the privilege of walking the runways in New York, Paris, and Milan for Karl Lagerfeld, Chanel, Valentino, Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Armani, Emanuel Ungaro, Dior, and Victoria's Secret,\" she wrote on her website, adding that she was also the face of a Dior campaign, and was featured in commercials for Clairol and Redken hair products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe later began working as an actress and landed a role in the film \"Perfect Stranger\" — alongside her future husband — in 2007.\n\nIn 2001, Heming Willis began her acting career. She played minor parts in \"Perfume\" and \"Entourage,\" before landing a role in \"Perfect Stranger,\" which starred Bruce Willis and Halle Berry. In 2013, she acted alongside her husband once more in \"RED 2.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, she first met Willis at the gym in 2007.\n\n\"In 2007, I met my husband-to-be, Bruce, at our mutual trainer's gym,\" Heming Willis wrote on her website.\n\nIn a joint interview with People in 2020, the couple discussed the day they met.\n\n\"When we first met, I was surprised at how charming and how funny he was – and extremely handsome,\" Heming Willis told the magazine. \"That was my first thought of you.\"\n\n\"I was already in love with her,\" Bruce Willis added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmma Heming and Bruce Willis got married in 2009.\n\nThe two got married two years later, in 2009, at their shared home in Turks and Caicos, according to Emma's website.\n\nOn their 13th wedding anniversary, Heming Willis shared a photo on Instagram of the couple on their wedding crying as they listened to speeches made by their loved ones. \"13 years ago, those wedding speeches really sent us over the edge,\" she wrote in the caption.\n\nBruce Willis was married to Demi Moore from 1987 to 2000. The two are still close friends, and have reportedly grown closer since Willis was diagnosed with dementia in March 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple has two daughters together, in addition to Willis' three daughters from his previous marriage.\n\nThe couple shares two daughters, 11-year-old Mabel Ray Willis and 9-year-old Evelyn Penn Willis. On her website, Heming Willis describes her daughters as a \"source of inspiration.\"\n\nWillis also has three older daughters — 34-year-old Rumer Glenn, 31-year-old Scout LaRue, and 29-year-old Tallulah Belle — with his ex-wife, Demi Moore. Heming Willis has a good relationship with her husband's ex and their daughters, often sharing updates to Instagram showing them spending time together.\n\nWillis is apparently over the moon about being the father of five daughters. For Father's Day in 2021, Heming Willis shared a photo on Instagram with the caption, \"Bruce's response when asked if he'd like to have a son?… \"I'd have 5 more girls right now.\" Happy Father's Day to this proud #girldad.\"\n\n\"I can't imagine having five boys,\" Bruce Willis told People in 2020. \"I can't imagine having one boy.\"\n\nAfter becoming a mother, Heming Willis became an ambassador for Room to Grow, a charity that helps children in poverty, according to People.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple has collaborated on business endeavors and has developed three fragrances together.\n\nAround the same time the couple tied the knot, the Willises began collaborating to create three fragrances, two of which were nominated for Duftstars Awards.\n\nTheir first fragrance, \"Bruce Willis,\" was released in 2010 and nominated for the prestigious German award. Two years later, they created a women's fragrance, \"Lovingly,\" which was \"a declaration of [Bruce's] love to his wife\" and \"is intended for modern, style-conscious women who radiate a certain sensuousness,\" according to Business Wire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe showed her support for her husband when he was diagnosed with aphasia in 2022.\n\nIn March 2022, Bruce Willis was diagnosed with aphasia, which negatively impacts cognitive function. Loss of speech and difficulty with writing and understanding language are two symptoms of the condition, according to Insider.\n\nOne of his daughters, Rumer, shared the update on her father's health in an Instagram post and said he would be \"stepping away\" from acting.\n\n\"This is a really challenging time for our family and we are so appreciative of your continued love, compassion and support,\" she wrote in the caption, in a letter signed by Willis' entire family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn honor of the couple's most recent wedding anniversary, Heming Willis discussed the difficulties of being a caregiver to a romantic partner.\n\nOn the couple's 14th anniversary, Heming Willis wrote on Instagram, \"[My anniversary] got me thinking about how hard these types of 'special occasions' can be on caregivers,\" she wrote. \"When usually our person would acknowledge the event, now their changing brains just can't.\"\n\nShe offered advice to those looking for ways to support people who provide care to loved ones.\n\n\"If you know someone that is looking after someone else, don't ask what you can do, just do,\" she added.\n\nRead next\n\nRelationship\n\nAdvertisement"
