        "text": "Bruce Willis’ wife, Emma Heming, has shared a series of throwback photos of the actor before his health deteriorated last year.\n\nTaking to her Instagram Story over the weekend, Heming, 47, admitted that she had been “caught in the old photo and video vortex” as she shared several photos of the “Die Hard” actor from previous years.\n\n“Send help,” Heming quipped as she posted several images of Willis, who was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in Feb. 2023.\n\nThe mom of two also posted a series of throwback snaps of her husband on the set of the 2013 film “A Good Day to Die Hard.”\n\nIn the photo, Heming can be seen posing with Willis, 69, and his daughter Scout Willis, whom he shares with ex-wife Demi Moore.\n\nHeming went on to share a sweet image of Willis with the pair’s daughter Mabel, now 12. In the snap, the actor can be seen holding his daughter on his shoulders as she read a book.\n\nIn another throwback photo, Heming shared a loved-up picture with Willis as the pair had their arms around each other.\n\n“A cellular level kinda love,” she captioned the image, before adding, “Just because,” alongside another.\n\nHeming last month celebrated the actor’s 69th birthday with a touching tribute on social media.\n\n“Just like you, we simply adore him,” she told her Instagram followers. “What you might not know, but maybe you could imagine, that being wrapped in his arms is the safest place in this whole wide world.”\n\nShe went on to call her husband “a true gentle-man” with “so much love to give and share.”\n\n“That’s what I get to see, his true core,” she concluded her post. “I can tell you, it’s so pure and ever so good. Happy Birthday my love. You are the gift that keeps giving.”\n\nIn the accompanying throwback photo, the “Wire Room” actor smiled while holding one of the couple’s two daughters.\n\nIn addition to Mabel, and Evelyn, 9, whom he shares with Heming, Willis shares daughters Rumer, 35, Scout, 32, and Tallulah, 30, with Moore.\n\nThe “Ghost” star, 61, and her daughters have all showed their support for Bruce since helping reveal his frontotemporal dementia diagnosis in February 2023.\n\nThe following month, the movie star’s family members felt “grief and sadness” while celebrating his 68th birthday.\n\nHeming, who wed Bruce in 2009, admitted via Instagram at the time that she “started the morning by crying.”\n\nThe “Moonlighting” alum was initially diagnosed with aphasia and announced a step back from his decades-long acting career in March 2022."
