        "text": "Originally appeared on E! Online\n\nMake no mistake: Bruce Willis' life is full of joy, his wife says.\n\nEmma Heming Willis is setting the record straight about the \"Die Hard\" actor after reading what she called a \"clickbait\" article about the 68-year-old, who has been battling frontotemporal dementia for over a year.\n\n\"The headline basically says there is no more joy in my husband,\" Emma Heming Willis said in a video posted on her Instagram March 3. \"Now, I can just tell you, that is far from the truth.\"\n\nThe 45-year-old continued, \"Stop scaring people to think that once they get a diagnosis of some kind of neurocognitive disease that, 'That's it. It's over. Let's pack it up. Nothing else to see here. We're done.' No, it's the complete opposite of that.\"\n\nBruce Willis' family—Emma Heming Willis and their daughters Mabel Willis, 11, and Evelyn Willis, 9, and his ex-wife Demi Moore and their kids Rumer Willis, 35, Scout Willis, 32, and Tallulah Willis, 30—announced in February 2023 that the actor had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. Almost a year prior, they had revealed that he was battling aphasia, which also affects cognitive abilities, and was stepping away from acting.\n\nBruce Willis' Family Moments\n\nIn her Instagram post, Emma Heming Willis reflected on how the actor's health battle has affected him and his loved ones.\n\n\"One hundred percent, there is grief and sadness. There is all of that. But you start a new chapter and that chapter is filled,\" she said. \"It's filled with love. It's filled with connection. It's filled with joy. It's filled with happiness. That's where we are.\"\n\nIn another video, Emma Heming Willis added, \"I'm not saying that dementia is rainbows and unicorns. It is not. But there is also another side of it that is so beautiful.\"\n\nBruce Willis' loved ones have rallied behind him and have occasionally shared photos of him at joyful family gatherings, past and present, most recently Tallulah Willis' birthday in February."
