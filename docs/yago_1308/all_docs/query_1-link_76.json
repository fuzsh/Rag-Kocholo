        "text": "She said on Tuesday on Instagram in a post to mark his birthday: “Just like you, we simply adore him. “What you might not know, but maybe you could imagine, that being wrapped in his arms is the safest place in this whole wide world.”\n\nHeming added Willis was a “true gentle-man” with “so much love to give and share”, signing off her post with the lines: “That’s what I get to see, his true core.\n\n“I can tell you, it’s so pure and ever so good. Happy Birthday my love. You are the gift that keeps giving.”\n\nShe posted a throwback photo of Willis smiling as he held one of their two daughters.\n\nWillis is also dad to Rumer, 35, Scout, 32, and Tallulah, 30, who he had with ex-wife Demi Moore.\n\nHeming has previously admitted she was “not good” as she continues to support Willis in his dementia fight.\n\nShe made the admission in an update to her social media fans in December, in which she also urged fellow “care partners” to “look for something beautiful” in their otherwise “hard,” “stressful” days and send her photos of their lives.\n\nHeming added on Instagram: “I know it looks like I’m out living my best life, [but] I have to make a conscious effort every single day to live the best life that I can. I do that for myself, I do that for our two children and [I do that for] Bruce, who would not want me to live any other way.\n\n“So I don’t want it to be misconstrued that I’m good, ‘cause I’m not. I’m not good.”\n\nWillis retired from acting in 2022 due to the brain disorder aphasia affecting his ability to understand language.\n\nHis family later said he had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, which affects behaviour, problem-solving, planning and emotions."
