        "text": "BRUCE Willis' wife Emma Heming has spoken out and said she had no support over her husband's dementia diagnosis.\n\nEmma announced she is set to release a book about caregiving after Bruce was diagnosed with dementia last year.\n\nEmma spoke to the publishing house Open Field about her upcoming release.\n\nThe book was said to, \"Offer a thoughtful, inspiring guide for those seeking support while navigating a loved one’s dementia.\"\n\n\"For many people, their first touch point about this disease is received in their doctor’s office,\" Emma explained in a newsletter released by the publishers.\n\n\"I think it’s very important how this information from doctor to patient and loved one is relayed.\n\n\"Having resources and information readily available is imperative. I know between my experience and other care partners that I have spoken to; our stories are unfortunately similar.\n\n\"We left that office with close to no resources or support and with a diagnosis that I could hardly pronounce,\" she continued.\n\nBruce was first diagnosed with aphasia in 2022, a condition which affects speech and language.\n\nIn February 2023, Bruce's family announced that the condition had progressed and he was diagnosed with Frontotemporal dementia.\n\nThe actor's daughter Rumer, 34, whom he shares with his ex-wife, Demi Moore, shared the heartbreaking news on Instagram.\n\nThe post explained that Bruce's condition was not treatable.\n\nThe condition is said to cause personality changes, obsessive behavior, and speaking difficulties.\n\nIn September, Emma became a caregiver for her husband, who she married in 2009.\n\nShe said that she wasn't sure if Bruce fully understood his diagnosis when he was faced with it.\n\nHOPEFUL\n\n\"There's so much more hope today than I did after Bruce was first diagnosed,\" Emma continued.\n\n\"I understand this disease more now, and I’m now connected to an incredible community of support.\n\n\"I have hope in having found a new purpose – admittedly one I never would have gone looking for – using the spotlight to help and empower others,” she finished.\n\nSUPPORT\n\nEmma's book hopes to help caregivers and family members who received difficult health news.\n\n\"[I hope to help] care partners, but especially new care partners, who have just received this life-changing news … they should know they are not alone and there is support, even hope.\n\n\"In a perfect world, I envision this book in that doctor’s office, and he or she, puts it in their hands to bring home,” she concluded.\n\nFAMILY TIME\n\nThe actor's family has spent more time around him since the difficult news.\n\nRecently, Bruce's family gathered around for Thanksgiving and took a sweet photo.\n\nEmma shared the post on Instagram at the end of November.\n\nThe shot showed the actor's whole blended family sitting outside, cuddling up to each other and smiling for the camera.\n\n\"I’m grateful and thankful to know this kind of love. Wishing you all a Happy Thanksgiving,\" Emma captioned the post.\n\nBLENDED FAMILY\n\nPulp Fiction star Bruce has five children: two from his current marriage to Emma, and three with his ex-wife Demi Moore, 60.\n\nHis three children with Demi, named Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah, have all gone on to have careers in acting, much like their parents."
