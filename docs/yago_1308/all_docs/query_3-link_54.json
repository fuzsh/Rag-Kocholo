        "text": "Synopsis\n\nEmma Heming Willis, who is the wife of Bruce Willis, seems to have given an update about the health of her husband. Bruce has been battling dementia for sometime now.\n\nThe wife of Bruce Willis, Emma Heming Willis, seems to have made an announcement about the ongoing battle of her husband with dementia.\n\nEmma, who is a model and entrepreneur, had married Bruce in 2009. She seems to have given the heartbreaking update about husband’s ongoing battle with dementia in a candid statement after watching the documentary Little Empty Boxes.\n\nThe feature-length documentary has been made by Max Lugavere about the life of his mother as she also battles dementia.\n\nOn Instagram, Emma also posted a picture with Max while putting on a brave face after attending the screening.\n\nEmma said, “Last night I was lucky enough to see a screening of @maxlugavere and @chrisnewhard new documentary, Little Empty Boxes. Max chronicles his mother Kathy’s battle with dementia while he educates himself on everything he can do to help her. His love for his mother is powerful. His motivation to find answers from leading health experts is inspiring and then be so gracious to share that information is a true blessing. It would be an absolute disservice if this documentary is not on a screen near us soon. Thank you Max for being so brave and vulnerable to share the journey and spotlighting the importance of brain health. When you live the world of dementia you know that options are slim. But some won’t take that lying down which is how change is made and I got to witness the beauty in that last night. #dementiaawareness #brainhealthawareness #paintopurpose (sic).”\n\nIn response to the message, Max said, “You're a warrior and I'm so proud to be in this fight with you.”\n\nSeveral fans have also commented on the post. A user said, “Thank you Emm for sharing this and Max for making it! Hope to see it! Prayers for you both and your families!”\n\nAnother user said, “God bless you for standing by the man you love. I know wedding vows say in sickness and in health but it can be very stressful. Your husband is blessed to have you!”\n\nFAQs\n\nWhen did Bruce Willis marry Emma Heming?\n\nThe couple tied the knot on March 21, 2009.\n\nHow old is Bruce Willis?\n\nBruce is currently 68 years old.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
