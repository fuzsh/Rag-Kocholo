        "text": "In the last year, Bruce Willis' life has taken an unexpected turn. The 67-year-old actor announced in 2022 that he had aphasia and was therefore retiring from the world of cinema. Now, the family has just revealed that he has been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. By his side is always Emma Heming, with whom he has been in a relationship for more than 10 years.\n\nBruce Willis and his now wife met in 2007 at a gym and also coincided in some films. Two years later, the couple married in Turks and Caicos, in a wedding in which Demi Moore, the ex-wife of the star of 'Die Hard' and her then-husband Ashton Kutcher, was present.\n\nFrom a successful model to her first steps in film\n\nEmma Heming Willis was born in Malta and, when her parents divorced when she was a child, she moved to London. There, she took her first steps as a model, even winning a beauty contest or two.\n\nLater, she moved to California to give new life to her professional career.\n\nDuring the following decades, Heming paraded on the best catwalks in the world, such as New York, Paris and Milan. In addition, she worked for major brands such as Victoria's Secret, Channel, Valentino and Dior and was on the cover of numerous fashion magazines until she became interested in acting.\n\nIn 2007, while she was at the gym, she met Bruce Willis, as they both shared a personal trainer. The couple met and struck up a romance that has continued over time. She has even been in the news for her excellent relationship with Demi Moore and the children she had with Bruce Willis."
