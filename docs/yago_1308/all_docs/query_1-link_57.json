In her caption, Emma wrote the pair's union is \"stronger than ever\" as the \"Die Hard\" star battles frontotemporal dementia.\n\n\"Today marks our 15th wedding anniversary! And today, I can make a choice. I can wallow in sorrow or I can celebrate it,\" Emma shared.\n\n\"I call this the ‘remarkable reframe.’ What I know is there is so much to celebrate.\n\nBRUCE WILLIS’ WIFE SAYS HER LOVE FOR ACTOR ‘ONLY GROWS’ BUT ADMITS ‘HOLIDAYS ARE HARD’ AMID DEMENTIA BATTLE\n\n\"Our union and connection is probably stronger than ever,\" Emma added. \"We have two bright, fun and healthy daughters. We have a family unit that is built on mutual respect and admiration.\n\n\"And simply, I just love and adore the man I married. I’m so proud of what we have and continue to create.

Willis' daughters — Rumer, 35, Scout, 32, and Tallulah, 30 — with ex-wife Demi Moore, 61, were in attendance. Moore, who has maintained a close relationship with Willis and Emma, and Ashton Kutcher, her husband at the time, were also guests at the wedding.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

I just got clickbaited. I’m just scrolling minding my own business and just saw a headline and got clickbaited that had to do with my own family,\" she wrote. \"The headline basically says there is no more joy in my husband.\n\n\"Now, I can just tell you that is far from the truth,\" she continued. \"I need society and whoever’s writing these stupid headlines to stop scaring people. Stop scaring people to think that once they get a diagnosis of some kind of neurocognitive disease that that’s it, it’s over. Let’s pack it up, nothing else to see here. We’re done.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"No. It is the complete opposite of that, OK? 100%. There is grief and sadness, there’s all of that. But you start a new chapter. And that chapter is filled. Let me just tell you what it is. It’s filled with love, it’s filled with connection. It’s filled with joy, it’s filled with happiness. That’s where we are.\""
