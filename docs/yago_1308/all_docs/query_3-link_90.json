        "text": "Bruce Willis’ wife, Emma Heming-Willis has shared that she has been in tears over the Christmas period as she struggles to deal with Bruce’s tragic illness.\n\nEmma took to Instagram to share a series of photos celebrating the couples’ 16 years together. She wrote that she had a “good cry” and revealed that although things have been tough for a while, her emotions have been amplified over the holidays.\n\nWATCH NOW: Demi Moore reflects on her relationship with ex-husband Bruce Willis. Article continues after video.\n\n“You know, holidays are hard, anniversaries are hard. But for me, this year, it has really been about community, building a community and connection,” she wrote.\n\n“And I just want to say that has been my lifeline and I just want to thank you for that.”\n\nEarlier this month, Bruce Willis’ family shared a devastating statement after discovering a development in his health battle. The family took to Instagram to share the news that his condition has “progressed.”\n\nThe family is “not sure how much time he has left”… it is understood that the actors health has significantly deteriorated.\n\nIn an interview with Us Weekly a source close to the family shared that Bruce is having “more bad days than good.”\n\n“No one knows how much time Bruce has left, so they’re soaking up every moment they get with him.”\n\nThe wife of beloved Hollywood actor, Bruce Willis, has spoken candidly about her husband’s health in a candid new personal essay for Maria Shriver’s Sunday Paper.\n\nSince his diagnosis, Emma Heming Willis, who married Bruce in 2009, has been a caregiver for her husband, something she says she feels a level of “guilt” about.\n\n“I struggle with guilt, knowing I have resources that others don’t. When I’m able to get out for a hike to clear my head, it’s not lost on me that not all care partners can do that,” she wrote.\n\nRELATED || Michael J Fox shares heartbreaking health confession\n\n“When what I share about our family’s journey gets press attention, I know that there are thousands of untold, unheard stories, each of them deserving of compassion and concern.”\n\n“At the same time, I see that what I share matters to others who may be struggling, and in a small way makes them feel seen and understood.”\n\nShe added that by going public with Bruce’s dementia diagnosis, she hoped in some “small way”, families experiencing the same thing would feel “seen and understood.”\n\n“I want people to know that when I hear from another family affected by FTD, I hear our family’s same story of grief, loss, and immense sadness echoed in theirs. It’s important to be an advocate on behalf of those families who don’t have the time, energy, or resources to advocate for themselves.”\n\nThe FTD Emma is referring to is frontotemporal dementia, a rare and progressive form of dementia that can cause extreme changes in behaviour and personality as well as declining cognition.\n\nIn 2022, the 68-year-old actor was diagnosed with aphasia which impacts how a person communicates, especially their speech. This then progressed into FTD, the Willis family confirming the sad news in February 2023.\n\nThe update from Emma comes mere weeks after the youngest daughter of Bruce and his ex-wife Demi Moore, Tallulah, gave another sad update about her father’s deteriorating health.\n\nReflecting upon the “really aggressive cognitive disease” that her father was fighting on The Drew Barrymore Show, Tallulah, 29, said that her blended family chose to go public about the battle Bruce was facing for several reasons.\n\n“On one hand, it’s who we are as a family,” she said.\n\n“But also, it’s really important for us to spread awareness about FTD because there’s not enough information out there.”\n\n“If we can take something that we’re struggling with as a family and individually and help other people turn it around, to make something beautiful about it, that’s really special for us.”\n\nWhen asked about how her father was currently, Tallulah replied: “He is the same, which I think, in this regard I’ve learned is the best thing you can ask for. I see love when I’m with him, and it’s my dad and he loves me.”\n\nTallulah’s comments come shortly after a close friend of Bruce’s – Glenn Gordon Caron – provided a sad update on his close friend and collaborator’s deteriorating health.\n\nSpeaking with The New York Post, Glenn revealed that he had actively tried to remain in Bruce’s life in a private manner.\n\n“I’m not always quite that good but I try and I do talk to him and his wife and I have a casual relationship with his three older children.”\n\nHe then elaborated on just how Bruce had deteriorated, explaining that the award-winning actor was “not totally verbal” and was “seeing life through a screen door.”\n\n“The thing that makes [his disease] so mind-blowing is [that] if you’ve ever spent time with Bruce Willis, there is no one who had any more joie de vivre than he. He loved life and….just adored waking up every morning and trying to live life to its fullest.”\n\n“When you’re with him you know that he’s Bruce and you’re grateful that he’s there,” he continued before making the heartbreaking admission that the “joie de vivre” in Bruce was gone.\n\nA month prior, Bruce’s loving wife Emma revealed to US breakfast television program Today it was “hard to know” if her husband of almost 15 years was aware of his dementia diagnosis.\n\n“It was a blessing and a curse to finally understand what was happening to him so can be into the acceptance of what it is,” the 45-year-old shared.\n\n“It doesn’t make it any less painful, but just being in the know of what is happening to Bruce makes it a little easier.”\n\nFrontotemporal dementia can be difficult to diagnose given the symptoms are often similar to a variety of other health conditions.\n\nMedical professionals are also unsure what causes the condition but believe that it can be passed on genetically in roughly 20 – 25% of people.\n\nWhen his condition was first made public, his family released a heartfelt statement about the “cruel” nature of the disease.\n\n“[Frontotemporal dementia] is a cruel disease that many of us have never heard of and can strike anyone. Today there are no treatments for the disease, a reality that we hope can change in the years ahead,” the statement said.\n\n“As Bruce’s condition advances, we hope that any media attention can be focused on shining a light on this disease that needs far more awareness and research.”\n\nReflecting upon how her family dynamic had shifted following Bruce’s declining health, his wife also revealed to Today that her husband was “the gift that keeps on giving.”\n\n“Love, patience, resilience. So much that he’s teaching me,” Emma said.\n\n“And it’s teaching (our kids) so much. How to care, how to love. It’s a beautiful thing amongst the sadness.”\n\nThe mother of two also revealed that their daughters Mabel Ray, 11, and Evelyn Penn, 9 were “aware” of their father’s health and the family home was “very honest and open.”\n\n“I wouldn’t want there to be any stigma or shame for their dad’s diagnosis or any form of dementia,” she added, noting how her husband’s condition had impacted their young girls.\n\nCurrently, Emma is a caregiver for her husband, sharing a home in Los Angeles with their two daughters.\n\nBruce’s ex-wife Demi Moore and their now adult daughters Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah have also been on hand to provide their support, the blended family even celebrating Bruce’s 68th birthday together in March 2023.\n\nIt’s an unconventional arrangement but is one borne out of love.\n\nThe blended family even celebrated Thanksgiving together in November 2023, Emma taking to her Instagram to share a sweet snap of them all together.\n\n“I’m grateful and thankful to know this kind of love 🤍🧡,” she captioned the post."
