        "meta_description": "In case I didn't thank you personally, please know that I appreciate all prior contributors/responders' input, images, etc.   Tom's posting of a recent acquisition got me thinking about this large set which I have quite a few questions about, which follow below...  However, I though I'd relate the story of my checklist below...  I first visited the Burdick Collection at the Met on 3/30/2005. For those of you who might not have had the opportunity to do this (something that I would suggest every collector on this board make at least a day available to do at some point), the collection is massive and is housed in individual albums, each weighing probably 12+ pounds and containing newsprint paper that measures about 12.5 x 15\". Burdick, working primarily by himself beginning in 1948), affixed his cards to the paper sheets according to categories set up in the ACC (i.e. Album No. 307 contains bakery issues D1 - D317). The collection is viewable by appointment through the Study Room for Drawings and Prints (Telephone: 212-570-3920) in 2.5 hour windows in the morning and afternoon, Monday thru Friday. The problem is that you have to bring a very systematic list of albums that you want to peruse, and in order to do that you have to either own or have a copy of the long out-of-print \"Directory to the J.R. Burdick Collection\" (I'll try and scan the one that I own and post in separate listing).  Back to the story of my first visit. In 2005, the NSB project was well underway. I decided to dedicate a couple of days to visiting the collection and fellow collector, Mike Maltzman, agreed to join me on at least one of those days. I prepared my list of albums of interest, focusing on topics that I knew the least about. I had a brand new journal for notes, so I know that the very first one that I requested was Album No. 307....and turning to page 1 was D1 \"Movie Actor Photos\". I probably had some pictures of what an album page looked like at one time, but unfortunately they've been lost to time (and multiple computer changes). To give you an idea as to what an album page looked like, imagine cards attached by stamp hinges in rows with as little space between to prevent overlap. Most of the cards were affixed so that backs could not be easily seen (and the museum staff actually dissuade you from touching the actual cards anyway), but Burdick would alway make one from a set fastened in such a way that the back could be seen or use a duplicate flipped over so that the back could easily be read....but only one/set.  So back to D1... it must have been one of Burdick's favorite sets. Having been born in 1900, he would have been in his late teens when it was issued. He had a lot of them, and he did elect to make tithe first listing in the section, labeling it as the only \"Actors and Actresses\" in an alphabetical listing, despite the fact that he showed a card back that clearly stated \"Movie Actor Photos\" (which would have put in farther into the section where there three other sets whose titles began with \"Movie\"). Regardless, almost half of the checklist below comes from Burdick's collection. I furiously wrote down 72 different names that day (you can take photos, but you can't use any form of good lighting or flashes, and the fonts are so small on these cards that it was next to impossible to just photograph entire pages and then magnify to read later....so I simply scribed...  The problem is that at the time I didn't realize there were several different backs. on these cards, and I'm pretty sure that Burdick only illustrated one (probably the only kind of bread that he ate as a teenager!). I'd love to aggressively work on this checklist by (1) noting additions, (2) noting variations, (3) identifying any cards with the larger dimensions (I'm pretty sure that my entire list comes from Burdick's collection, and finally (4) noting other bakeries (I seem to recall having seen one, but I failed to make any notation at the time....alas, lost from memory). I could also use a 300 dpi scan of variations \"a\" and \"b\", as well as one of the \"larger\" cards....Here goes:   MOVIE ACTOR‚ÄàPHOTOS   1910s - Koester‚Äôs Bread    50 x 87 mm  U.S.A.                      157K unnumbered cards (+var.) üì∑ The vast majority of these borderless, black & white, photographic card fronts identify the depicted actor in all upper case letters printed in a very small font either at the top or bottom; however, a few have the actor identified only by their autograph within the photo (noted as ‚Äúscript‚Äù in checklist). In addition to blank-backed cards, three distinct printed back variations exist that identify the set total as 100 and advertise one or two of the manufacturer‚Äôs brands of bread:  one offers an album promotion (available in return for submission of twenty-five of ‚Äúthese portraits‚Äù to either the local grocer or bakery office) and advertises only ‚ÄúKoester Honey Bread‚Äù,  identifies the set title/total (also 100) and advertises only ‚ÄúKoester Tosty Bread‚Äù, or  identifies the set title/total (also 100) and advertises both ‚ÄúKoester Honey and Tosty Bread‚Äù. It is unknown whether all three back variations exist for every actor, but it would appear that they likely represent different printings with some or all new actors depicted (to date no actor has been confirmed to be found with different printed backs). This would explain the known checklist exceeding the advertised set total. Cards are printed on very thin white card stock. Some cards have been seen  that exhibit a thin white border surrounding the actor photo, but because their dimensions are larger (up to 59 x 88 mm) this may simply represent production variation. This set dates to 1916-19, based on the careers of the actors who are depicted. Cards were inserted into the manufacturer‚Äôs bread loaves, so collecting such a large set (or even accumulating the twenty-five portraits necessary to acquire the album would have been quite challenging). The set is designated as ‚ÄúActors and Actesses‚Äù in Burdick's American Card Catalog, but is more appropriately labelled by the title found on the printed card backs. There was also an album insert that advertised set title and total. The checklist of the subsequent listing contains ten actors not currently known for this set, suggesting that both checklists may be far from complete.

Thanks, Chris\n\nSee the \"H\" post for a related advertising stock issue that includes our moderator Tom's recent acquisition.\n\nMy head is spinning with all the great information from Todd and Bob. Todd, thanks for posting those Huber blank backs and all the other great information. Bob, thanks for posting all those backs, I'm going to spend a day poring through those.\n\nThis is one of my favorite sets. This is how I think things happened with these cards. They started out as giveaways at movie theatres in about 1916. They have been positively dated to 1916 from some of the backs. They were given out at tons of different theatres, as Bob has shown. They were given out over several years, with some of the early stars dropped and others added. It would be very difficult to figure out exactly which cards went with which theatres. Then at the end, they were also used as giveaways in bread. The bread cards used a lot of the same cards from the movie theatres and also added a few new ones.\n\nI have 198 different cards listed on my movie card website for this group, with 188 of them pictured. I haven't checked the names Bob just listed against my checklist yet to see if there are new ones, but there probably are.\n\nI'm going to disagree with you both on these being issued by Kromo Gravure. I used to think that, but I don't think so anymore. These cards curl inwards from top to bottom, while the Kromo Gravure cards lay flat. The card stock is a bit different between the two. The front gloss is different between the two, more glossy with Kromo Gravure. The pictures are all different between the two with maybe a very small handful of exceptions. I think Kromo Gravure and these were just competitors. I don't know who issued these.\n\nOn my movie card website, my main listing for these is grouped as Bob and I have been collecting them, with all the cards listed together regardless of whether they have a movie theatre back, bread back, arcade back, blank back, etc. As I said earlier, they were not all issued together, but it was a continuous group, with some of the earliest cards being issued all the way to the end. I have named them Distinguished Players on my website because a lot of the movie theatre sets have that wording on the backs. Here's a link to my listing:\n\nhttp://www.moviecard.com/zamerican/theatre/royal.html\n\nYou guys have answered some of my questions, but I have lots more questions, beginning with is there a Charles Chaplin card in the set. I have him listed, but I don't remember why I listed him and I'm thinking now that he is probably not in the set.\n\nAlso, all of Jefferson Burdick's cards from this set have been scanned and can be seen on the Metropolitan website. There is one very weird card he has listed for this set, the Edna Payne card. I don't know quite what to make of that card."
