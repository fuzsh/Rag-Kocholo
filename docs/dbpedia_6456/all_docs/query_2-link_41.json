        "text": "Sign up for our Watching newsletter to get recommendations on the best films and TV shows to stream and watch, delivered to your inbox.\n\nThe Disney-owned Hulu streaming service is still, more than 15 years into its existence, thought of first as a repository for new television (and, for many cord-cutters, the “live TV” option of choice) and second as a library of indisputable TV classics, usually in their entirety. But savvy viewers can also find a rotating library of movies, both new releases and recent classics, rivaling the collections of many of its competitors — if they know where to look. We’re here to help.\n\nWe also have lists of the best movies and TV shows on Netflix, the best of both on Disney+ and the best movies on Amazon Prime Video.\n\n‘Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ (2024)\n\nThe most recent addition to the rebooted “Planet of the Apes” franchise adroitly continues its tradition of excellence; this is a rare studio tent-pole that’s executed with intelligence and maturity. Set “many generations” after the events of “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” and “War for the Planet of the Apes” (both also on Hulu), it’s a classic hero’s journey, with a new protagonist: the young chimpanzee Noa (Owen Teague) searching for his ape tribe, which has been kidnapped by the monstrous Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand). The action beats are muscular, the scale and scope are impressive, and the closing passages are uncommonly thoughtful. Our critic called it a “powerful” film, with “a tremendous amount to mull over.”\n\nWatch it on Hulu"
