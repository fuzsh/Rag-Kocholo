        "text": "United Kingdom\n\nClassical music in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland can be traced back to the thirteenth century. Essentially it is similar to music which developed in continental Europe, but with unique styles for each of its major nations - England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. There was a period of rebirth of classical music from the second half of the nineteenth century into the early years of the twentieth century, when it became more important in society, and significant national identities began to emerge.\n\nA selection of articles about United Kingdom"
