        "text": "Apollo’s Fire: festive, virtuosic Bach\n\nApril 2024 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Peter Feher\n\nReview of: Bach’s Easter Oratorio\n\n“A festive, virtuosic spirit coursed through every piece Apollo’s Fire presented. From the beginning of Friday’s performance at St. Raphael Catholic Church in Bay Village, the dialogue between soloists and ensemble was on brilliant display. Conducting from the organ, Sorrell led a breezy reading of the Sinfonia from Cantata 42, which put the spotlight on the orchestra’s two oboes and bassoon.\n\nThe vocalists were the stars of Cantata 66, which opened with the joyous declaration of ‘Erfreut euch, ihr Herzen; (Rejoice, my heart’s spirit) from Apollo’s Singers. Trumpets and drums added to the fanfare of the Easter Oratorio, which impressed in both its big orchestral passages and quieter moments of reflection… the final chorus saw everyone united again in the expression of something greater.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire wraps season with lively jam session of Spanish early music\n\nMarch 2024 – Chicago Classical Review\n\nby John von Rhein\n\nReview of: ¡Hispania! A Voyage from Spain to the Americas\n\n“Exhilarating… a fascinating exploration of the vast diaspora of early music culture that progressed from North Africa to Spain to the colonial Americas…. Presiding over the sold-out concert with her usual stylish vitality, director and harpsichordist Jeannette Sorrell lent rattles of tambourine to the Spanish folkloric rhythms that her brilliant ensemble seized with infectious gusto….\n\nTwo superb vocal artists, Sophia Burgos and Andréa Walker, displayed immaculate diction and were mesmerizing as they drew listeners deeply into a potpourri of largely unfamiliar Spanish music from the 16th to 20th centuries. The Puerto Rican-American soprano Sophia Burgos possesses a sensuous, strikingly beautiful, deeply expressive voice. A 17th-century party song capped off a flawless concert delightfully. Apollo’s Fire has secured an indispensable place in Chicago’s early music life.”\n\nRead More\n\n¡Hispania! A Voyage from Spain to the Americas\n\nMarch 2024 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Kevin McLaughlin\n\n“Apollo’s Fire makes the enjoyment of old music easy. Less interested in the virtues of museum preservation, this band delights in having practices and creations of the past party with the present. Jeannette Sorrell and her joyous troupe made this trip a theatrical thrill ride.\n\nApollo’s Fire were their usual accomplished and exuberant selves, the kind of musicians who are disinclined to sit still. They swayed, reveled, and wholly involved themselves in the music making, as if each note were a group product.\n\nIn her Apollo’s Fire debut, soprano Sophia Burgos provided ample justification to have her back, and soon. With a radiant singing voice and charismatic stage presence she gladdened the heart, whether singing songs of pleasure or sadness. [Jeremias] García showed consummate guitar skill in several solo turns… an equal supply of digital dexterity and musical imagination.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire burns darkly in a program of Hispanic music\n\nMarch 2024 – Seen & Heard International\n\nby Mark Jordan\n\nReview of: ¡Hispania! A Voyage from Spain to the Americas\n\n“Breathtaking musical dialogue… powerful and emotional. Sopranos Sophia Burgos and Andréa Walker blended exquisitely, dovetailing their phrases to give each other moments to shine. Burgos was particularly fascinating in the Sephardic Ladino ballad ‘Nani, Nani.’ Percussionist Anthony Taddeo seemed determined to light up the stage with his vital joy.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire serves up Irish holiday warmth with “Wassail!”\n\nDecember 2023 – Chicago Classical Review\n\nby Tim Sawyier\n\n“Infectious Irish fiddle reels...violinists Susanna Perry Gilmore, Caitlin Hedge, and Emi Tanabe brought irrepressible Gaelic flair throughout the afternoon. Fiona Gillespie was a standout, singing with power, polish, and idiomatic Irish inflection. The musical polymathy on display was impressive. Sorrell was an effortless master of ceremonies… In addition to having arranged much of the music, she narrated, conducted, played harpsichord, and joined the dance numbers, entirely at ease directing her creation. One wondered whether ‘Wassail!’ may in time become another Chicago Christmas tradition.”\n\nRead More\n\nFire & Joy from Bach and Vivaldi\n\nNovember 2023 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Daniel Hathaway\n\n“Soloists Alan Choo and Edwin Huizinga brought plenty of fire to their assignment, setting daredevil tempi at the beginning as they chased each other up and down d-minor scale passages, and inspiring cellist René Schiffer to brief bursts of virtuosity. Oboist Debra Nagy was outstanding as soloist…sonorous and splendid. Nicole Divall and her viola d’amore were refreshingly healthy and unaffected. Admirable ensemble playing between the soloists and orchestra.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire soars with ‘Fire & Joy’ in Ohio\n\nNovember 2023 – Seen & Heard International\n\nby Mark Jordan\n\n“It is notable that Apollo’s Fire can bill a concert as ‘Fire & Joy’, and then actually deliver on those strong descriptors. The program admirably mixed famous and lesser-known pieces, closing with a chestnut, Johann Sebastian Bach’s Brandenburg Concerto No.4. This performance was of the sort that poses a real challenge to a reviewer who has twice heard Apollo’s Fire perform the piece in the past. Those renditions were outstanding, and one might think they would be hard to top, but this is not a group that rests on its laurels. They looked anew and dug deeper into this masterpiece.\n\nIt has been a joy watching violinist Alan Choo over the last few years move from talented newcomer to vivid master. He had brilliant technique when he joined Apollo’s Fire, but working with Jeannette Sorrell and her ensemble has unlocked his ability to project vivid emotion and drama. This concerto offers some ferocious passages for the violinist and suffice it to say that Choo could have taken on both the Devil and Johnny from the Charlie Daniels song ‘The Devil Went Down to Georgia’ and left them behind, sputtering in the dust. Yet – and this is perhaps an even greater achievement – he had the wisdom and grace to know when to drop back and let recorder players Daphna Mor and Kathie Stewart take the lead.\n\nA further mark of the performance is how one could focus deep in the ensemble and still feel like each person was animating the music in a personal and committed way. I don’t think I was alone when a sense of elation began to creep over me, a sense that the very atoms around us began dancing with the deep joy of this performance. Audience reaction was explosive.\n\nDeborah Nagy was no less excellent in the reconstructed oboe concerto in F by Bach…enchanting and breathtakingly otherworldly. Sorrell brings restless creativity to everything she does and has found like-minded allies to join her in her explorations. They are a gift.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire takes a varied and rewarding journey to Venice\n\nNovember 2023 – Chicago Classical Review\n\nby Tim Sawyier Review of: Nights in Venice\n\n“The Cleveland-based Baroque orchestra Apollo’s Fire continues to expand its Chicago footprint to the benefit of the city’s early music scene. Soprano Erica Schuller, a standout all night, gave a stirring invocation, her robust soprano sensitively attentive to the text’s affective shading. Three Vivaldi concerti bore Sorrell’s trademark Vivaldi-as-Baroque-rock-music aesthetic, with swaggering vitality and virtuosic contributions from the multiple soloists. Daphna Mor was a versatile soloist, aided by slight amplification, leading the supporting ensemble with poise.\n\nThe full complement of musicians ended the night with the boisterous ‘Seven Ways to Cook Eggplant’… a party atmosphere prevailed. Apollo’s Fire contribution to the Chicago’s musical life continues to grow.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire opens Chicago season with gripping, of-the-moment Handel\n\nOctober 2023 – Chicago Classical Review\n\nby Tim Sawyier Review of: Handel’s Israel in Egypt\n\n“Sorrell’s version restores Handel’s original tripartite structure, in an attempt to capture the intended dramatic arc from sorrow to jubilation… The result is gripping. It is hard to find enough superlatives for the performance of the Apollo’s Fire vocal forces. They met Handel’s many demands with aplomb, singing with superb pitch, balance, sweep, and diction. The trust and mutual respect among Sorrell and her period instrumentalists were apparent throughout, with supple, responsive playing from the orchestra, and clear yet unobtrusive leadership from Sorrell herself.”\n\nRead More\n\nSplendour of London\n\nOctober 2023 – Cool Cleveland\n\nby Lisa DeBenedictis & Tricia Hammann\n\n“On Thursday, October 12th, the superb ensemble of soloists, Apollo’s Fire, opened its 32nd season in Akron’s stunning St. Paul’s church. The sound of this ensemble demonstrates a clarity and purity that is not only appropriate to the time period of its repertoire, but is ravishing in its own right. Every musician in the orchestra and chorus is solo quality, but nonetheless plays with an attention and blend that creates a distinctive and stunning ensemble sound.\n\nThe trumpet and horn players in Handel’s hornpipes were especially astonishing. Horn players Sara Cyrus and Alexandra Cook and trumpeters Steven Marquardt, Perry Sutton and Ryan Berndt exhibited a virtuosity that was exhilarating. Tenor Jacob Perry’s singing was wonderfully alive, limber and flexible. The exuberance of Handel’s Water Music lifted the spirits… a concert deeply appreciated and moving.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire floats the ‘Splendour of London’ to Ohio\n\nOctober 2023 – Seen & Heard International\n\nby Mark Jordan\n\n“For the most part, Water Music is ‘just’ a string of dance tunes. But, and this is an important exception, almost every one of those dances is a gem. The way to make the collection work is to dive into the essence of each dance and animate it from within, almost as if making the dances a succession of exquisite moments. That is exactly what Sorrell did with her selections from Water Music, finding in each piece a tiny cosmos of humor (the Bourrée from the F major suite), brazen brilliance (the opening Allegro of the D major suite) or even quite moving pathos (the second menuet from the G major suite). When performed with such characterization, the dances are endlessly appealing.\n\nThe concert ended with a stirring rendition of Zadok the Priest, broadly visionary until it erupted in the high spirits that carry it to its peak. The vocalists of Apollo’s Singers were as vibrant here as they had been brooding in the Funeral Music. Orchestral balances were exquisite throughout the concert, and all the singers and orchestral players gave the ensemble’s thirty-second season a stirring launch.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire Illuminates the Road to Dublin at Rosen Concert Hall\n\nJuly 2023 – Cultural Voice of North Carolina\n\nby Peter Perret\n\n“Apollo’s Fire is an extraordinary ensemble…I have witnessed few orchestral ensembles with such spontaneous yet precise cohesion, albeit bursting with enthusiasm. The fiddlers, all three, were extraordinary virtuoso musicians. Fiona Gillespie sang several folk songs with a pure tone and impeccable intonation.\n\nA brief word about the remarkable conductor that is Jeannette Sorrell. In contrast to the world of time-beaters, it is a pleasure to experience the musically precise gestures which gracefully pace the music and allow it to breathe in a musical fashion. Indeed, Sorrell accomplishes far more with much less motion! Brava!”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire concert in the Ohio countryside packs both charm and substance\n\nJune 2023 – Seen & Heard International\n\nby Mark Jordan\n\n“Apollo’s Fire concert packs both charm and substance… Sorrell is not only a musician, she is a sort of conceptual artist of public engagement. Apollo’s Fire can and does throw a damn good party, but you can bet even the Grim Reaper himself will dance in the shadows. [After] a radiantly beautiful but infinitely sad rendition of ‘The Parting Glass’, the entire ensemble all but blew the roof off the barn with a rollicking stomp in ‘The Rocky Road to Dublin.’ – Now that, my friends, is how you throw a memorable party.”\n\nRead More\n\nExile & Resilience: Music of the Jewish & African Diasporas\n\nMarch 2023 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Kevin McLaughlin\n\n“Jeannette Sorrell and troupe always seem to offer a festival for the eye and ear — thoughtful thematic programs, all-out committed musicianship, and infectious exuberance. Wednesday’s program at Bath Church UCC was all this and more. Pure joy.”\n\nRead More\n\nExile & Resilience: Music of the Jewish & African Diasporas\n\nMarch 2023 – Chicago Classical Review\n\nby Katherine Buzard Review of: Exile & Resilience\n\n“Impressive vocal soloists… soprano soloist Ashlee Foreman and baritone soloist Charles Wesley Evans left an indelible impression. Jacob Perry wowed with his pleasantly gentle upper register, clear-as-crystal coloratura, and deep knowledge of baroque style. Tenor Haitham Haidar and baritone Edward Vogel were highly engaging and committed performers. Concertmaster Alan Choo and violinist Emi Tanabe duked it out in Rossi’s Sonata in Dialogo, each trying to one-up the other in virtuosity. Later, in three traditional Ashkenazi wedding dances, clarinetist Merlin Shepherd displayed a dazzling array of colors and dynamics. The continuo instruments provided supportive accompaniment throughout, skillfully adapting their playing for the various stylistic requirements.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire Launches 10-City ‘Exile and Resilience’ Tour\n\nMarch 2023 – Musical America\n\nby Hannah Edgar Review of: Exile & Resilience\n\n“Rapturously performed. Young soprano Ashlee Foreman stepped out with a remarkable, text-painting opening solo in ‘O Freedom!’ Baritone Edward Vogel pinch-hit impressively for Apollo’s Fire regular Jeffrey Strauss, his voice snowballing in power and expressiveness over the course of his cantorial solos. Tina Bergmann garnered some of the most raucous applause of the night for an extended hammered dulcimer solo that flirted with chromatic embellishment. Oud player Brian Kay arguably outshone them all in a spectacularly combustible djembe drum-and-tambourine solo. An ecstatic romp.”\n\nRead More\n\nMuse of Fire\n\nFebruary 2023 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Peter Feher\n\n“Longtime fans of Apollo’s Fire might think they’ve heard everything possible from Cleveland’s Baroque Orchestra, but they should have another listen. A fresh lineup of musicians and a largely unfamiliar set of composers were featured in the group’s concerts this month, making for an exciting evening. The mastery and deliberation that come from knowing a score so well shone through in [Alan Choo’s] performance.”\n\nRead More\n\nDrive the Cold Winter Away\n\nJanuary 2023 – Cool Cleveland\n\nby Lisa DeBenedictis\n\n“Brian Kay’s storytelling, delivered with panache and humor, enhanced the spirit of the evening. The foot-tapping music inspired audience participation with clapping, stomping, singing and toe-tapping… The dark days of January are always dispiriting, frequently dampening the Christmas Spirit. This concert left its audience uplifted and giddy. Blu Jazz and Apollo’s Fire should make this an annual post New Year’s tradition.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire makes Handel’s Messiah a Christmas miracle in Ohio\n\nDecember 2022 – Seen & Heard International\n\nby Mark S. Jordan\n\n“Sorrell treated this year’s performance as a new study of the work, with new discoveries and inflections even in the familiar parts. Indeed, one of Sorrell’s continuing keys to success in this thirty-first season of Apollo’s Fire is that she can find and weld together the strengths of such a varied cast of elite period performers and make it something greater than the sum of its already considerable parts. That she can do it with such a seasoned chestnut as Messiah, making every moment as engaging as it must have been to its first audience, is little short of a Christmas miracle.”\n\nRead More\n\nSorrell leads Apollo’s Fire in a vital, transcendent “Messiah”\n\nDecember 2022 – Chicago Classical Review\n\nby Landon Hegedus\n\n“Imbued with a striking vigor and precision not heard since the pandemic…[Sorrell’s] respect for and mastery of this score was evident in her fluid yet exacting gestures; but the alchemical fusion of choral and instrumental sound that she drew from the ensemble was transcendent. The combined sound, like a pipe organ, was homogenous and organic, with articulation and pitch executed meticulously across each section of the ensemble.”\n\nRead More\n\nCleveland’s Apollo’s Fire summons Baroque storms\n\nNovember 2022 – Seen & Heard International\n\nby Mark S. Jordan Review of: Storms & Tempests\n\n“The ensemble’s director, Jeannette Sorrell, is a master of program building. Here she assembled a compelling arc of French and Italian music, contrasting the elegance of the former with the drama of the latter, but further complicating the contrast by including both concert works and excerpts from stage works. This approach spurs the musicians to go beyond the conventions of the original genres to a sort of grand unified theory of performance: the operatic arias sound like concertos for voice, and the concertos pop like characters on a stage before you.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire strikes sparks with exuberant take on Monteverdi “Vespers”\n\nOctober 2022 – Chicago Classical Review\n\nby Lawrence A. Johnson Review of: Monteverdi Vespers of 1610\n\n“An exuberant performance….enhanced by some terrific solo singing, and directed by Jeannette Sorrell with characteristic vitality and ebullience. The polish and dedication of Sorrell and the soloists—vocal and instrumental—was unassailable.”\n\nRead More\n\nMonteverdi Vespers of 1610\n\nOctober 2022 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Peter Feher\n\nCleveland’s period orchestra revived its thrilling take on the composer’s Vespers of 1610 to start the season, and you couldn’t ask for a better beginning. The 40-odd singers and instrumentalists had musical riches to spare, and [Sorrell’s] distinctive creative vision united it all. The Vespers of 1610 is something of a raison d’être for Apollo’s Fire — because it’s both a period work and a perfect fit for the players….almost as if this work had been crafted with one ensemble in mind.\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire animates Monteverdi’s Big Bang of sacred works in Cleveland\n\nOctober 2022 – Seen & Heard International\n\nby Mark S. Jordan Review of: Monteverdi Vespers of 1610\n\n“Sorrell’s and Apollo’s Fire’s recording of this work was recently named by BBC Music Magazine as one of ‘30 Must-Have Recordings of our Lifetime’. One can see why. Sorrell has made sure that her ensemble are masters of a tremendous range of music making, from ethereal spirituality to earthy frolics. That Shakespearean range was brought to bear in the Monteverdi Vespers, ranging from angelic sweetness to human longing, divine power to swaying dance.\n\nThe soloists were outstanding. Jacob Perry engaged compellingly, and the ‘Pulchra Es’ duet between Erica Schuller and Molly Netter was almost unbearably beautiful, the meaning of the text simply but devastatingly conveyed by the singers turning away from each other in the closing measures. Apollo’s Fire is always alive to the power of communication through stage movement. The instrumental performers supported the singers with brilliance.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire brings down the house for 30th anniversary\n\nMay 2022 – Cleveland.com\n\nby Linda Gandee Review of: Mozart and the Chevalier\n\n“Apollo’s Fire brings down the house… a spectacular performance. Some classical performances have people walking away saying, gee, that was nice. But not too many have the audience giving two standing ovations… That is the allure and the effect on audiences wherever Apollo’s Fire performs. Incredibly energetic… To miss them when they are in the Cleveland area is a day wasted. How special that we can claim them here in Northeast Ohio as they bring a new understanding, as well as a special kind of excitement, to baroque music.”\n\nRead More\n\nMozart and the Chevalier\n\nMay 2022 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Daniel Hathaway\n\n“Sunday’s concert… was an amazing event. A rhythmically splendid performance full of excitement and power… The featured soloists, who can knock the socks off an audience with their dazzling playing alone, reached deep into their reservoirs of charm to make personal connections with their listeners. “\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire celebrates their thirtieth anniversary at Severance\n\nMay 2022 – Seen & Heard International\n\nby Mark Sebastian Jordan Review of: Mozart and the Chevalier\n\n“An outstanding performance… bringing the audience to their feet. Sheer delight, capturing the special alchemy that launched Apollo’s Fire onto the world stage. Their thirtieth anniversary – a milestone for a group that appeared out of nowhere and blazed a path to the top….”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire wraps Chicago season with music of Mozart and Bologne\n\nMay 2022 – Chicago Classical Review\n\nby Katherine Buzard\n\n“Apollo’s Fire brought the vivacity that audiences have come to expect from them. Dramatic tension… Sorrell allowed her personality to come out in full, moving around the podium like a sorceress incanting the music into being… That’s the beauty of a group like Apollo’s Fire: they’re not afraid to challenge expectations.”\n\nRead More\n\nFrancisco Fullana and Apollo’s Fire blaze connections in Ohio\n\nMarch 2022 – Seen & Heard International\n\nby Mark Sebastian Jordan Review of: Virtuoso Bach & Vivaldi\n\n“My understanding of J. S. Bach’s Violin Concerto in D minor will forever be separated into ‘before’ this concert and ‘after’…the tremendous Spanish violinist Francisco Fullana returned to concertize with Jeannette Sorrell’s masterful Apollo’s Fire ensemble, and alchemy occurred. Fullana has found a way to turn music into pure golden energy. Olivier Brault and Susanna Perry Gilmore were also vital soloists, bursting with energy and interaction…brilliant and communicative. Sorrell served not as accompanist but as co-creator of both these extraordinary performances.”\n\nRead More\n\nHandel’s Israel in Egypt\n\nFebruary 2022 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Peter Feher\n\n“Artistic director Jeannette Sorrell adapted the Baroque score with certain modern expectations in mind. Her production retains Handel’s solemn opening, achieving a kind of period authenticity, but jettisons much of the repetition and inessential action in the rest of the music. The result is a lean and engaging dramatic arc — less than two hours — that translates 18th-century entertainment for the 21st century.”\n\nRead More\n\nHandel’s Israel in Egypt\n\nFebruary 2022 – Cool Cleveland\n\nby Dr. Roy Berko\n\n“A triumphant musical journey – a display of the startling abilities of the orchestra’s musical sounds and solo and choral performances. A powerful emotional journey and an audience pleaser.”\n\nRead More\n\nVirtuoso Bach & Vivaldi\n\nJanuary 2022 – Chicago on the Aisle\n\nby Lawrence B. Johnson\n\n“Sorrell’s lively tempos kept the band on its toes – and I might as well say rockin’ to the rhythms of those old boys from Venice and Leipzig. Spanish violinist Francisco Fullana dispatched this grand-scaled essay with heady virtuosity – tossing in a formidable, blazing first-movement cadenza worthy of Paganini. It was an electric performance. Throughout the concert, Sorrell pushed the Baroque boundaries in a determined effort to recapture the music in all the freshness of its native sound. Here was highly idiosyncratic music-making, with persistent lifts at phrase endings, ever-buoyant rhythms and generally quick tempos. No solemn enshrinement here, no deference before the some pale plaster bust. This was Bach perceived as youthful and headstrong.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire lights a winter blaze with lively Bach and Vivaldi\n\nJanuary 2022 – Chicago Classical Review\n\nby Tim Sawyier\n\nReview of: Virtuoso Bach & Vivaldi\n\n“The nuance and vitality that Apollo’s Fire brought to Bach’s familiar opus made one realize just how many seemingly adequate past performances were, in hindsight, casual and pro forma. Sorrell and colleagues’ reading was bustling and highly inflected, though never mannered, and highlighted contrapuntal details that breathed necessary freshness into the oft-traversed score. Choo and Gilmore were fiery soloists, bringing dynamic esprit and flashiness to their solo parts. The evening ended in a lively, party atmosphere.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire captivates with jubilant Messiah\n\nDecember 2021 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Stephanie Manning\n\n“A breathtaking performance…The 19-member chorus projected a large, resonant sound, with the ethereal higher voices floating above. Their sections with orchestra, like the rousing four-part canon “He trusted in God,” were full of energy, while in the haunting choir-only moments during “Since by man came death,” it was as if time was briefly suspended…a performance alight with musicality.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire opens new Chicago series with rock-n’-roll Vivaldi\n\nOctober 2021 – Chicago Classical Review\n\nby Katherine Buzard\n\nReview of: Vivaldi’s Four Seasons rediscovered\n\n“Sorrell led the ensemble standing at the harpsichord almost like an electric keyboard player in a rock band. Her conducting was balletic and expressive, using her body and face when her hands were otherwise occupied. The ensemble itself was buoyant and aerobic, following the shapes of the musical lines with their bodies. Their joy and physical connection to the music was infectious, and it made one want to join in their dancing, or at least tap one’s toe.”\n\nRead More\n\nVivaldi’s Four Seasons rediscovered\n\nOctober 2021 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Daniel Hathaway\n\n“Sorrell’s spoken introductions to each concerto were brief, witty, and deftly illustrated with well-rehearsed snippets of music. Throughout the performance, ensemble playing was tight and coordination flawless. Apollo’s musicians have this score so much in their blood and fingers that they can be playful with Vivaldi’s imitations of natural sounds. The birds chirp convincingly, the flies and wasps buzz threateningly…the movement depicting cautious steps on ice was lovely, the several stormy passages fiercely tempestuous.”\n\nRead More\n\nVivaldi’s Four Seasons rediscovered\n\nOctober 2021 – Seen & Heard International\n\nby Mark Sebastian Jordan\n\n“Apollo’s Fire launched its thirtieth season in a richly imagined exploration of Antonio Vivaldi’s The Four Seasons with guest artist Francisco Fullana. One of the many joys of Jeannette Sorrell’s brilliant Apollo’s Fire baroque orchestra is that they can reinvigorate old favorites just as well as they chart unfamiliar waters. Fullana was an inspired choice. Careful interplay between Fullana, Sorrell and the ensemble led to thrilling moments of expressive detail.”\n\nRead More\n\nReplete with drama, Apollo’s Fire takes audience on ‘vivid, almost visceral’ Baroque journey\n\nJuly 2021 – The Chautauquan Daily\n\nby Zachary Lewis\n\nReview of: Love in Venice\n\n“Apollo’s Fire doesn’t just play, you see. It inhabits the music. In the hands of this award-winning chamber orchestra, and especially in “Love in Venice,” scores become veritable pieces of theater, animated scenes replete with drama impossible to absorb passively. When these players utter their creative tagline, ‘Passion. Period,’ they mean it. By the end, the house was on its feet, clamoring for more.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire and the last measure of perfection\n\nJuly 2021 – The Berkshire Edge\n\nby David Noel Edwards\n\nReview of: Virtuoso Bach & Vivaldi\n\n“One could witness any number of early music performances and yet be utterly blindsided by Apollo’s Fire (a.k.a. the Cleveland Baroque Orchestra). That’s because few early music groups perform at the level of precision this ensemble regularly achieves. What differentiates Apollo’s Fire from other ensembles using period instruments is the last measure of perfection, the last one or two percent, that tiny bit of wiggle room that separates absolute perfection from what is considered humanly possible. It’s almost like the tiny but crucially important difference between a partial and total eclipse of the sun. Apollo’s Fire closes that gap to a startling extent, and when they do, it is immediately audible — astounding, really.”\n\nRead More\n\nBring on the Fire!\n\nJuly 2021 – The Boston Musical Intelligencer\n\nby Leon Golub\n\nReview of: Virtuoso Bach & Vivaldi\n\n“Retrieving Telemann’s distinctive voice from underneath Bach’s shadow takes an incredibly special gift, and Apollo’s Fire succeeded beautifully, revealing a probing and experimental composer. The Allegro galloped and raced with verve, shaped to great cathartic effect by Sorrell’s eloquently expressive dynamics. Apollo’s Fire made Brandenburg Concerto no. 4 as fresh as its premiere. The final Presto, a triumphant counterpoint explosion, came across masterfully with breathtaking momentum. The audience was riveted…\n\nSince no one felt like leaving and all were clapping madly, Apollo’s Fire treated us to an unexpected encore, one thematically tied to 18th-century Leipzig, when all things Turkish were in fashion. Longa Nahawand, a rousing Turkish instrumental dance, featured brilliant improvisations by Daphna Mor, then by Emi Tanabe, capping the evening with ‘barbaric beauty.'”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire rewards in-person audience with Resplendent Bach on Season Finale\n\nApril 2021 – Cleveland.com\n\nby Zachary Lewis\n\nReview of: Virtuosity\n\n“Transcendent…elegant, meaningful phrasing and resonant warmth.

Jordan\n\nReview of: Tapestry – Jewish Ghettos of Baroque Italy\n\n“The work proved highly dramatic, quickly shifting from introspective to fiery and giving the strings a virtuoso workout. The video gives a sense of how closely the players and director have to bond to follow this work’s twists and turns. No bland staring at the printed page in this group: everyone’s eyes are on the move, connecting with other players and with Sorrell in order to make a million subtle shifts seem inevitable. In truth, such fine coordination is never as easy as Apollo’s Fire makes it look.”\n\nRead More\n\nAllure: The Three Amandas\n\nNovember 2020 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Daniel Hathaway\n\n“Sopranos Amanda Forsythe and Amanda Powell and mezzo-soprano Amanda Crider deliver jaw-dropping performances of virtuosic works. ‘Who needs the three tenors?’ Sorrell asks rhetorically in her opening remarks. The ladies seem to answer, “Not us!” as they effortlessly negotiate Luzzaschi’s fluttery melismas and ornaments. The results are stunning.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire rises to virtual challenge with poignant ‘Resilience’ program\n\nOctober 2020 – Cleveland.com\n\nby Zachary Lewis\n\nReview of: Resilience – Music for Troubled Times\n\n“No one else does the Purcell, Dowland, Tomkins, or folk pieces director Jeannette Sorrell and crew present here, or gives them such suave, dramatic treatment…. Powerful words by Harriet Tubman, Francis Harper, and Frederick Douglass unify a striking musical menu including Kentucky fiddle tunes, spirituals, and Appalachian folk melodies. Soprano Ashlee Foreman delivers a tour de force in “Death Comes to My House” and the whole group carries “Wade in the Water” to captivating heights, freshly adorning every new wave. The takeaway is a message of hope, a celebration of humanity’s ability to endure the worst.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire strikes sparks in a timely Ohio return\n\nOctober 2020 – Seen & Heard International\n\nby Mark S. Jordan\n\nReview of: Resilience – Music for Troubled Times\n\n“While other ensembles play it safe during troubled times, leave it to Jeannette Sorrell and her stable of geniuses to bring both catharsis and balm… Sopranos Amanda Powell and Ashlee Foreman were glorious soloists. Apollo’s Fire is a cultural treasure, particularly in its willingness to grapple with the world’s problems and offer comfort and catharsis. Above all, the ensemble proved, once again, that they are the embodiment of the program’s title: resilience.”\n\nRead More\n\nO Jerusalem!\n\nMarch 2020 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Timothy Robson\n\n“Sensational…’O Jerusalem’ was a sensory feast, with its varied music, instruments, and vocal styles, as well as beautiful images projected on a screen above the performers.

It was a joyous celebration ending a well-conceived and well-executed program.\n\nRead More\n\nA Lively Valentine from Apollo’s Fire\n\nFebruary 2020 – Seen & Heard International\n\nby Mark Sebastian Jordan\n\nReview of: L’Amore – An Old Italian Valentine\n\n“Apollo’s Fire refuses to let music lie dead on the page. The Prometheus behind Apollo’s Fire is its founder and music director Jeannette Sorrell. Sorrell presided like an alchemist working in human personalities. It was exciting to see how much Alan Choo’s artistic grip, confidence, and sense of engagement with this ensemble has grown. Erica Schuller was breathtakingly crystalline in the concert aria ‘Che si può fare?’ by Barbara Strozzi. Nothing less than haunting… and Schuller didn’t hesitate to plumb its emotional depths.\n\nInfectiously fun… the concert’s most surprising selection – surely calculated to raise purists’ blood pressure – Monteverdi’s ‘Ohimè, ch’io cado’ started off straight but began to swing in rhythm more and more as it progressed, finally pushing past scholarly baroque notes inégales, to actual jazzy blue notes…. deliciously melting the walls of time, showing that the distant past is never that far gone after all.”\n\nRead More\n\nVivaldi’s Four Seasons – Rediscovered\n\nOctober 2019 – Seen & Heard International\n\n“Sorrell’s vivid approach to the pictorial elements to make these familiar works seem freshly minted, full of astonishing incident. Sorrell is part of a new movement in early music, pushing past shock value toward a less dogmatic flexibility. The opening chorus of birds had exhilarating ebb and flow. In the dance-like finale, Sorrell made it clear once and for all that Vivaldi was evoking bagpipes. In the brilliant overall shaping of first movement of ‘Summer’, each return of the heat-weary ritornello grew slightly faster, until the tension exploded in the final squall.”\n\nRead More\n\nHandel’s Messiah\n\nDecember 2018 – Seen & Heard International\n\n“Stunned at the new life conductor Jeannette Sorrell brought [to Handel’s Messiah], with the players’ remarkable commitment… Issues of tradition or radical change fall to the wayside as Sorrell and the musicians focus on living in the moment with Handel’s lively muse. Part of their approach is simply being aware of the oratorio’s theatrical nature. In one spot, Sorrell had the chorus members leave the stage and envelop the audience in a radiant ring. I have been waiting for thirty years for a conductor who also seemed to be aware of the awesome strength of “And he shall purify.” Finally I heard it. Insights like this kept appearing on page after page.”\n\nRead More\n\nO Jerusalem! – Crossroads of Three Faiths\n\nNovember 2018 – Seen & Heard International\n\n“On period instruments, a voyage of faith for the 21st century… Apollo’s Fire continues to challenge and enchant.

To hear an ensemble at the peak of their powers, making vital statements about the world, is a privilege.”\n\nRead More\n\nO Jerusalem! – Crossroads of Three Faiths\n\nNovember 2018 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\n“Captivating… a ravishing musical landscape. A high level of artistry and passionate music-making… gorgeous and stylish.

Brian Bigley delighted the audience when he pocketed his penny whistle and began Irish clog dancing. The lightning strike of genius can happen, sometimes even repeatedly to those willing to earn it. Jeannette Sorrell is one such person. This show was intense, interesting, spectacularly performed, and deeply moving. If that’s not genius, I don’t know what is.”\n\nRead More\n\nTenor Nicholas Phan with Apollo’s Fire\n\nNovember 14, 2017 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Timothy Robson\n\nReview of: 50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\n\n“….A stunning live performance of Nicholas Phan’s English Baroque lute song album, A Painted Tale. The instrumentalists also interspersed dance movements by William Lawes that enhanced the storyline of Phan’s “pastiche song cycle.” There was not a weak moment in the 90-minute concert. Purcell’s Evening Hymn was itself worth the price of admission. In the encore, Phan put on his inner Whitney Houston for a ravishing rendition of Dolly Parton’s classic I Will Always Love You. It brought down the house.”\n\nRead More\n\nHandel’s Israel in Egypt\n\nOctober 20, 2017 – Seen & Heard International\n\nby Mark Sebastian Jordan\n\n“A Master Storyteller Adapts an Undervalued Oratorio… Sorrell is a masterful musical storyteller. Her adaptation [of Handel’s Israel in Egypt] gives the work a coherent, compelling dramatic arc, brought off brilliantly by her singers and players. I can only think that Handel, a practical man of the theater, would wholeheartedly approve. Here, the life and dramatic meaning were foremost, and it was a thrilling reminder of Handel’s greatness. The instrumental solos throughout were brilliant… Sorrell’s adaptation and conducting could open up a new era of appreciation for this great, undervalued oratorio.”\n\nRead More\n\nHandel’s Israel in Egypt\n\nOctober 16, 2017 – The Cleveland Plain Dealer\n\nby Mark Satola\n\n“A vivid adaptation of Handel’s ‘Israel in Egypt’… A new performing edition prepared by music director Jeanette Sorrell… seeks to re-establish the dramatic balance…The effectiveness of Apollo’s Fire’s version proves that Sorrell was on the right track. Exhilarating abandon, which Sorrell harnessed wonderfully… Apollo’s Singers were supple and subtle, alert to a wide dynamic range and sensitive to the drama of the music.”\n\nRead More\n\nHandel’s Israel in Egypt\n\nOctober 17, 2017 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Daniel Hathaway\n\n“Triumphed Gloriously”… Chorus, soloists, and orchestra were uniformly impressive. The chorus, like the text they sang at one point, ‘triumphed gloriously.’ Alternating between the podium and the harpsichord, Sorrell led a highly nuanced performance of Israel in Egypt… unanimous in phrasing, dynamics, and musical rhetoric — and well-calculated in dramatic impact.”\n\nRead More\n\nTanglewood 2017: It gets better every year\n\nAugust 3, 2017 – Hudson Valley 360 (Tanglewood Festival)\n\nby Dave Sear\n\nReview of: Vivaldi’s Seasons – Rediscovered\n\n“For me, this summer’s Tanglewood season opened in Ozawa Hall with an exciting concert performed by Apollo’s Fire — also known as The Cleveland Baroque Orchestra.\n\nNamed for the classical god of music and the sun, Apollo’s Fire was established by Jeannette Sorrell who leads the orchestra while conducting from the harpsichord. This long-time favorite ensemble of mine energetically entered the stage from both sides and, while standing, took off with a performance of what they called “Antonio Vivaldi’s Four Seasons — Rediscovered.”\n\nIt was like no other performance of this work I have ever heard. Up until now, I have thought of this piece as just another orchestral work.”\n\nRead More\n\nA change of “Seasons” at Ozawa Hall\n\nJuly 6, 2017 – The Berkshire Eagle (Tanglewood Festival)\n\nby Andrew L. Pincus\n\nReview of: Vivaldi’s Seasons – Rediscovered\n\n“Rediscover a work that has been played just about every way except by dwarves standing on their heads? Apollo’s Fire at Tanglewood… put some high-octane fuel into the tank. The idea, Sorrell said in talks from the stage, was to transport Vivaldi’s four violin concertos to the Italian countryside conjured up in annotations in the scores. Sorrell is a wonder. A harpsichordist-conductor who studied conducting under such as Leonard Bernstein at Tanglewood, she founded Apollo’s Fire. Some of the 18 players are also Tanglewood grads.”\n\nRead More\n\nVirtuoso Bach & Vivaldi\n\nFebruary 2017 – Sarasota Herald Tribune, Florida\n\n“Arguably one of best period-instrument ensembles in the world… Apollo’s Fire embodies the most glorious of Baroque ensemble traits.

If this concert didn’t shake your rafters, then nothing will.”\n\nRead More\n\nA Trip to Venice with Apollo’s Fire\n\nNovember 22, 2016 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Nick Jones\n\nReview of: Love in Venice – A Multi-Cultural Fiesta\n\n“With music director Jeannette Sorrell as tour guide, ‘Love in Venice: A Multicultural Fiesta’ took us not only to palazzi on the Grand Canal, but also ushered us safely through the crowded streets and tiny squares where Jews and Arabs traded and mixed — not always comfortably — with the ruling Christians. Soprano Amanda Powell gave passionate renditions of three songs from the Jewish and Arab quarters. She was accompanied by an ensemble of haunting soundscapes: harp, flute, and shawm, hammered dulcimer, and a host of atmospheric percussion sounds.\n\nThe palaces of Venice, as Sorrell pointed out, held frequent musical entertainments featuring the music of Monteverdi and Rossi (himself a Jew, and much in favor in elite circles). Selections from Rossi’s instrumental music were high-energy, eminently upbeat pieces imbued with an unabashed frivolity, and played with the usual Apollo’s Fire sparkle. Monteverdi joined the party with the lovely wedding scene from the beginning of Orfeo, aswirl with romantic imagery and uplifting music. Monteverdi’s Scherzi musicali (musical jokes) completed the party, sung with flirtatious élan by Powell, McIntosh, and Schuller in various combinations, and with considerable theatrical flair.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire Inspired Musical Affection\n\nNovember 21, 2016 – The Cleveland Plain Dealer\n\nby Mark Satola\n\nReview of: Love in Venice – A Multi-Cultural Fiesta\n\n“…Unexpected musical revelations…. Violinist Olivier Brault was stylistically incisive and interpretively impulsive. Of greatest interest were the three songs evoking Venice’s Jewish and Arab quarters, with soprano Amanda Powell fully submerged and wholly convincing in the stylistic complexity of the music’s Middle Eastern scales and sinuous melodies.\n\nThe evening concluded with the premiere of a work by AF cellist Rene Schiffer, with words in Italian by Jeanette Sorrell, “Figli di Dio (Children of God),” which Sorrell described as a plea for love and understanding among the diverse people of the world. Adding a seraphic note to Schiffer’s music were the singers of Apollo’s Musettes, young women of high school age whose purity of voice went a long way toward carrying the music’s message.”\n\nRead More\n\nA Night at Bach’s Coffeehouse\n\nOctober 2016 – Chicago Classical Review\n\n“APOLLO’S FIRE MAKES BLAZING CHICAGO DEBUT… At long last, Apollo’s Fire has descended upon Chicago. Nearly every bar teemed with ideas. The Technicolor phrasing Sorrell drew from her players only increased this vividness… From their hair-trigger dynamic shifts in the opening phrase to the whirlwind final bars, this was as exciting as Baroque music gets… The appreciative audience coaxed them back… their encore was a barnstorming conclusion to an arresting musical evening.”\n\nRead More\n\nA Night at Bach’s Coffeehouse\n\nOctober 2016 – Chicago Magazine\n\n“Baroque performance generally inclines towards the buttoned-down.

Oestreich\n\nReview of: Bach’s St. John Passion – A Dramatic Presentation\n\n“A resplendent performance… The production belonged entirely to Ms. Sorrell, who devised the concept, which she called ‘a dramatic presentation…’ Jesse Blumberg sang the role [of Jesus] handsomely and acted vividly. Nicholas Phan sang the Evangelist beautifully, with unusual animation and dramatic vehemence. Jeffrey Strauss turned Pilate into a living, breathing figure for a change. The other vocal soloists — Amanda Forsythe, soprano; Terry Wey, countertenor; and Christian Immler, baritone — were outstanding.\n\nThe orchestra was also excellent… The chorus, equally fine, allowed Ms. Sorrell some exquisite moments. In the two-verse chorale early on, Ms. Sorrell silenced the orchestra for the second verse, letting the magnificent chorus sing a cappella to breathtaking effect…”\n\nRead More\n\nA ‘Staging’ of the St. John Passion That Works\n\nMarch 10, 2016 – MusicalAmerica.com\n\nby George Loomis\n\nReview of: Bach’s St. John Passion – A Dramatic Presentation\n\n“As the closest thing to an opera Bach wrote, the St. John Passion… evokes deep spirituality while teeming with theatricality. No wonder attempts have often been made to stage it, including one two years ago by Peter Sellars and the Berlin Philharmonic that erred…. The drama was blurred.\n\nNo such problem afflicted the superlative performance by Apollo’s Fire… Sorrell ensured that there was no lack of drama. She set persuasive tempos…. The excellent orchestra proved capable of producing an engagingly colorful sound at full volume but also finely nuanced effects.\n\nAlso in good form was the chorus known as Apollo’s Singers. Consistently alert and dynamic, the group was especially vital… when positioned in the aisles, achieving a kind of surround-sound effect that heightened the drama. Phrasing in the chorales, as shaped by Sorrell, was noteworthy for some lovely detail.\n\nThe first-rate soloists are well known… Pure-voiced Amanda Forsythe sang exquisitely in the soprano arias.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire Set to Tour Gripping St. John Passion\n\nMarch 9, 2016 – Classical Voice North America\n\nby Daniel Hathaway\n\nReview of: Bach’s St. John Passion – A Dramatic Presentation\n\n“The ensemble’s lively and gripping version of the oratorio… Sorrell dispatched 8 chorus members to the side aisles during the turbulent crowd scenes, surrounding the audience and virtually making them part of the seething mob. The soloists who portrayed Jesus, Simon Peter, and Pilate had memorized their parts and physically confronted one another. So did the chorus.\n\nThe dramatic success of the performance hinged on Sorrell’s skillful, often brisk pacing of the music and Nicholas Phan’s superb storytelling as the Evangelist.\n\nApollo’s Singers were riveting… Sorrell dictated a variety of nuances that the chorus delivered with fine attention to detail and unflaggingly crisp diction. This absorbing performance was nearly flawless.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire Outdoes Itself with Resplendent, Fresh Account of Bach’s St. John Passion\n\nMarch 7, 2016 – The Cleveland Plain Dealer\n\nby Zachary Lewis\n\nReview of: Bach’s St. John Passion – A Dramatic Presentation\n\n“A magnificent account… So much about the performance under Jeannette Sorrell was alluring that it would be virtually impossible to rank any one aspect over another. Still, if any faction deserves top billing, it’s the Apollo’s Singers. Its singing alone was often enough to give one chills. But the group also provided immersive drama, simulating angry mobs by gathering in aisles amidst the audience and demanding Jesus over Barrabas in stereo surround-sound.\n\nNicholas Phan… as Evangelist supplied both theatricality and sheer vocal splendor… Soprano Amanda Forsythe and baritone Jeffrey Strauss were their usual enchanting selves. The former’s two arias were moments of pure, angelic radiance; the latter, meanwhile, proved an ideal Pilate, embodying the ruler’s tragic position, his simultaneous need to appease and disinclination to condemn.\n\nThat just leaves the orchestra. Any prophet could have foretold it: under Sorrell, playing a work with which it is deeply acquainted, the ensemble… evinced nothing but insight, warmth, and sensitivity.”\n\nRead More\n\nBoston Goes Gaga for Handel\n\nDecember 9, 2015 – Berkshire Fine Arts\n\nby Daniel Bonetti\n\nReview of: The Power of Love – Passions of Handel & Vivaldi\n\n“The Apollo’s Fire concert at Cambridge’s First Church… was a total love fest.

A set of extravagant variations on a four-note bass line, the piece showed Apollo’s Fire at its exuberant best, engaging with the music as few early music ensembles dare to do. Picture the cellists, bassist, and continuo players cherishing those endlessly repeating four notes as though they were the finest bass line ever written, and you can see why Apollo’s Fire charmed audiences from Tanglewood to England to Italy last summer — and did it once again on Friday night in Cleveland Heights….\n\nBassoonist Marc Vallon lent his warm, expressive tones to Vivaldi’s solo lines in the a-minor concerto (RV 497)…Violinists Julie Andrijeski and Johanna Novom splendidly took the solo honors in Vivaldi’s g-minor concerto, RV 578, beginning with sneaky entrances that led to stabbing gestures of surprising violence…”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire lives up to its word with treat-filled ‘Splendor of Venice’ program\n\nOctober 18, 2015 – Cleveland.com\n\nby Mark Satola\n\n“Apollo’s Fire hit the ground of their new season running, powered by their dual summertime triumphs at Tanglewood and the BBC Proms. Concertos by Vivaldi anchored their October program, but considerable interest was generated by music by some of the “outliers,” including Marco Uccellini and Evaristo Dall’Abaco. The festive nature of “Splendor of Venice” was underscored Friday by the ensemble’s processional entry into the nave and sanctuary of Fairmount Presbyterian Church in Cleveland Heights.\n\nSoloists Kathie Stewart, flute, and Debra Nagy, oboe, were well matched and nimble in their roles, and the ensemble essayed some of their most polished playing ..

Their programme of mostly Baroque music flickered and danced, distinguished by cultivated string tone and buoyancy of rhythm. The most appealing item was a selection of movements from Telemann’s Burlesque de Quixotte, vignettes of vivid, pictorial character. Alina Ibragimova, fresh from Bach’s solo violin works at this year’s Proms, gave lithe performances of concertos by Vivaldi and Bach. The programme was designed to take the audience back to Zimmermann’s coffee house in 18th-century Leipzig. Unusually, women were allowed at Zimmermann’s for concerts — just as well, when Apollo’s Fire has more women players than men and is directed by the live-wire Jeannette Sorrell.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire & Alina Ibragimova: ‘superbly judged’\n\nBBC Proms review\n\nAugust 16, 2015 – The London Telegraph\n\nby Jonathan McAloon\n\nReview of: A Night at Bach’s Coffeehouse\n\n“Building sound, almost instrument by instrument, Sorrell exposed to us clearly the workings of this lovely piece.

Snaidas was glowing… Strauss’s abilities as a forceful and dramatic singer came to the fore. The vocal star of the evening, however, was Sulayman, whose subtle and wide-ranging tenor voice was marvelous throughout. Finally, we come to Sorrell. Her performance of Storace’s “Folias d’Espagna” indicated that her audiences are long overdue a solo keyboard recital by her.”\n\nRead More\n\nBaroque Blues: Apollo’s Fire in café style\n\nFebruary 15, 2015 – Bachtrack.com\n\nby Frank Kuznik\n\nReview of: Blues Café 1610\n\n“Imagine Claudio Monteverdi and other luminaries of the early Baroque era gathered in an Italian café, trading ideas over generous glasses of vino while the band improvises on their latest musical creations…With songs and dances rooted in the popular music of the era, [they]… made a persuasive case for a direct line running from composers like Monteverdi and Diego Ortiz to Woody Guthrie and the Rolling Stones. One of the hallmarks of the ensemble is its easy blend of erudition and entertainment, with Jeannette Sorrell compiling tasty and instructive programs…. A program of this depth and caliber can only be assayed by an ensemble that knows its music history and has mastered early music chops.

It also boasts a staging of the elder’s “Coffee” Cantata, set at a Leipzig coffeehouse…To such sparkling performances by AF director Jeannette Sorrell and a handful of AF principals and apprentices, one could have listened happily for ages…the real jolt came via J.S. Bach’s “Coffee” Cantata, a singular work depicting a coffeehouse argument between a father and his daughter over her marriage prospects and addiction to caffeine. Rarely performed in its own right, the piece Thursday was given even rarer treatment in the form of a semi-staged production… a fetching combination of vocal radiance and dramatic awareness that brought the quirky tale to life…a truly distinctive program. Apollo’s Fire treated listeners to a most appropriate bonus beverage: coffee.

The light-hearted, 90-minute concert culminated in a cleverly staged performance of Johann Sebastian’s amusing “Coffee Cantata.” The “fourth wall” came down abruptly right at the end of the brief intermission when Zimmermann hurried onstage and moved into the audience with his broom, sweeping up and trying to get the crowd to stop nattering and take their seats. Jeffrey Strauss perfectly captured the personality of Schlendrian — bumbling and at his wits’ end — singing with excellent diction and a fine sense of comedy. [Madeline] Healey’s strong, clear voice and supple delivery beautifully suited the frequently ornate music Bach wrote for Lieschen, and her acting fit the character of a dizzy daughter like a glove. [Jeannette] Sorrell’s imaginative staging brought the instrumental ensemble into the action and sometimes coyly made good fun of itself…”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire brings a riveting new work to Cleveland: Handel’s Messiah\n\nDecember 13, 2014 – Bachtrack.com\n\nby Timothy Robson\n\n“For those who thought they knew Messiah, the performance on Saturday evening by Apollo’s Fire, conducted by Jeannette Sorrell, was a revelation. In the second of five performances in four venues around the Cleveland area, Messiah has seldom seemed so dramatic, soalive with detail, yet with an overall sense of the work’s architecture. Throughout the almost three hour performance, my attention never flagged, even in arias that can sometimes be dull… Throughout, it was Jeannette Sorrell’s vision which led to an uncommonly unified success. This was a Messiah that will last in my memory for a very long time.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire breathes new life into Handel’s beloved ‘Messiah’\n\nDecember 13, 2014 – Special to The Plain Dealer\n\nby Mark Satola\n\n“It is their current series of performances of Handel’s beloved oratorio “Messiah” that returns Apollo’s Fire to its original raison d’etre, which is to breathe new life, through early-music practices, into music that over three hundred years of playing has accrued, like ivy that degrades mortar, an overlay of inimical habits of performance… Artistic director Jeannette Sorrell and her players and singers accomplished this handily with their 2014 edition… Sorrell’s approach, which is at once alert and more intense (her baton on this occasion was more forceful and direct than usual), highlighted the visceral excitement of the music, and, for those listening for it, underscored the excitement Handel himself must have felt …The chorus of 26 (“Apollo’s Singers”) was similarly light on its feet, rendering Handel’s masterful counterpoint with clarity and verve, but rising to sonic splendor when Handel calls for it. …Meredith Hall was reliably crystalline, and baritone Jeffrey Strauss was an appealing proponent of Jennens’ patchwork libretto, whether shaking the heavens and the earth (“Thus saith the Lord”) or calling forth the notes of the trumpet (“The trumpet shall sound”).”\n\nRead More\n\nAn Exuberant Music Party (Monteverdi Vespers)\n\nNovember 14, 2014 – The San Francisco Chronicle\n\nby Joshua Kosman\n\n“The robust and wonderfully vivacious account… was a voluptuous and hugely gripping approach to Monteverdi’s masterpiece [the Vespers of 1610]. A vast and inviting feast, ranging from exuberant choral explosions to intimate expressions of the amorous. Sorrell and her forces delivered it with superb energy and clarity to put the cap on a wholly exhilarating evening.”\n\nRead More\n\nMonteverdi Vespers\n\nNovember 13, 2014 – The News-Gazette (Urbana, IL)\n\nby John Frayne\n\n“A resplendent version of Claudio Monteverdi’s “Vespers of 1610.” …I have heard recordings of this work over many years with pleasure, but the impact of a live performance by so professionally accomplished a group as Apollo’s Fire was overwhelming. . . The choral singing was excellent in ensemble discipline, and the ability of these singers to control phrasing, volume, and intricate blending of voices was most impressive. The solo singers were outstanding in their vivid enunciation of the Latin Psalm texts. The instrumental sound of the therbos (large lutes) and sackbuts (trombones) stood out in the delightful aural array of ancient instruments. Conductor Sorrell did a superb job in maintaining forward momentum in this complex and monumental score.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire on tour gives Ann Arbor a glorious night (Monteverdi Vespers)\n\nNovember 7, 2014 – The Plain Dealer\n\nby Zachary Lewis\n\n“A resplendent performance… Apollo’s Fire’s account of [the Monteverdi Vespers] stands out from others… From the procession with which it began to the florid, antiphonal exchanges between superb tenors at its conclusion, the performance was bracingly theatrical. Two bewitching hours of sometimes tense, often enrapturing, and always vivid musical drama.Apollo’s Singers, the vocal wing of the ensemble… hovered radiantly on one or two words, sumptuously evoking one hallowed image after another. None of these glories would have been possible without the orchestra – colorfully decked out with sackbuts, theorbos, and a recorder – or Sorrell’s lucid, emotionally rich leadership.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire: Monteverdi’s Vespers at St. Paul’s, Akron\n\nNovember 1, 2014 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Daniel Hathaway\n\n“A dazzling guided tour…a glittering parade of pieces: five inventive settings of Vespers psalms for double chorus with four interspersed “Motets” in the new theatrical style for soloists, then at the end, a spirited instrumental sonata with soprano obbligato, a rich elaboration of the hymn Ave maris stella, and a striking setting of the Magnificat. Apollo’s Singers, 22 strong including soloists, sang with potent focus and laser-sharp intonation throughout the evening….impressive on all counts: brilliantly paced, arrestingly sung and magnificently played.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire Triumphs in “Glory on the Mountain”\n\nJune 18, 2014 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby James Flood\n\n“Apollo Fire’s Sunday evening performance at the Baroque Music Barn in Hunting Valley shows why the early music/Baroque ensemble can and should make forays outside of classical and into the heart of American folk music…“Glory on the Mountain” is an exploration into the music and culture of 18th and 19th century Appalachia, a place populated by British settlers. It combines haunting melodies, foot-stomping jigs and reels, stories, and a healthy dose of comedy, all with musicianship of the highest order. The audience sang, clapped, shed a few tears, and laughed, ultimately enjoying a taste of the good times that our mountain forebears must have had…an absolutely joyous achievement. See it/hear it if you can. Bravo!”\n\nRead More\n\nSandrine Piau and Apollo’s Fire at Birmingham Town Hall\n\nMay 13, 2014 – Birmingham Post (UK)\n\nby Norman Stinchcombe\n\n“Apollo’s Fire brought a type of American bohemian chic which was a refreshing change from the more staid, often po-faced, British baroque bands. Led by exuberant, flame-haired Jeannette Sorrell, they were flamboyant and fun. And boy, they can play, too. Their party piece – Vivaldi’s trio sonata La Folia arranged as an increasingly frenetic dancing concerto grosso by Sorrell – energetically rounded off a hugely enjoyable concert.”\n\nRead More\n\nSublime mastery from Sandrine Piau and an exciting return from an American period band\n\nMay 10, 2014 – The ArtsDesk (London, UK)\n\nby Alexandra Coghlan\n\nReview of: Apollo’s Fire, St John’s Smith Square\n\n“Maverick energy… Artistic Director Jeannette Sorrell knows her repertoire well, and chose a wonderful selection of works to showcase her band. It was great to see the music stands put away for this dancing, stamping piece of musical madness [Vivaldi’s La Folia arranged by Sorrell]. The group are natural communicators. Apollo’s Fire are a wonderful antidote for too much British baroque.”\n\nRead More\n\nThe Power of Love – Apollo’s Fire/Jeanette Sorrell with Sandrine Piau –\n\nVivaldi, Rameau and Handel\n\nMay 8, 2014 – Classical Source (London, UK)\n\nby Richard Landau\n\n“The ever-growing reputation of Apollo’s Fire – an ensemble based in Cleveland, Ohio – ensured a substantial and very appreciate audience. This well-planned programme demonstrated to perfection the players’ high artistry. The opening movement of Vivaldi’s Concerto in D, [arranged by Sorrell] served as a lively opener in which all of the musicians’ stylishness and virtuosity were on display. One immediately sense the intense rapport between the players, and between them and Jeannette Sorrell. The most stunning orchestra item was Sorrell’s arrangement of Vivaldi’s trio sonata “La Folia” (Madness). The playing became evermore abandoned until, with tapped cellos adding to the riot of sound, the piece whirled towards a boisterously exhilarating climax. This was a supremely satisfying concert on every level. A further appearance in London by Apollo’s Fire would be very welcome.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire, Birmingham Town Hall, review: ‘agile grace and unforced energy’\n\nMay 8, 2014 – The Telegraph (London, UK)\n\nby Ivan Hewett\n\n“An evening of superlative music-making. The group’s director, harpsichordist Jeannette Sorrell, put together an ingenious programme which showed off the ensemble’s range of colour, mood and style . . . playful and flexible. Each piece found its own special colour. Another engaging thing about the group is that they combine European stylishness with “can-do” American entrepreneurism. They seize on unlikely things like American folk music and recreate it with foot-stomping brio – as their first encore showed. And Sorrell arranged [Vivaldi’s La Folia] for the full band and the results were thrilling. The players’ agile grace and unforced lyrical energy made them ideal partners for soprano Sandrine Piau.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire in passionate music (mostly) by Handel and Vivaldi\n\nApril 29, 2014 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Timothy Robson\n\n“One of the hallmarks of Apollo’s Fire’s performances is the naturalness and freedom of their music-making. Although very carefully planned and rehearsed, the musicians always project a sense of spontaneity and improvisation. Also, Jeannette Sorrell is not afraid to make things her own, as exemplified in the program by two of her transcriptions of Vivaldi works that opened and closed the concert…it was stylishly done… (“La Folia” ) turned into a kind of Baroque “jam session. The whole group performed from memory, with a sense of improvisation and everexpanding ornamentation, passing the thematic material around from section to section. It was a tour de force that brought the program to a thrilling conclusion.”\n\nRead More\n\nSoprano Amanda Forsythe joins Apollo’s Fire in glorious display of ‘The Power of Love’\n\nApril 28, 2014 – The Plain Dealer\n\nby Zachary Lewis\n\n“Illuminated by soprano Amanda Forsythe, last week’s Apollo’s Fire program was truly not to be topped, and for the performances, the only possible feeling was affection. If only the evening, the orchestra’s last subscription program, had been longer. Two hours of Baroque love-themed arias and related instrumental music under Jeannette Sorrell practically rushed by, leaving patrons Friday at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Cleveland Heights ready and eager for more… the real joy was all the colorful vocal plumage Forsythe displayed: lustrous sighs and perky leaps accomplished with ultimate precision. These were the magic in Forsythe’s spells, and each one only served to deepen the enchantment…What’s more, the performances by the orchestra were the equal of the soloist’s, mirroring every bit of her spirit and agility.”\n\nRead More\n\nBright and dazzling, again.\n\nMarch 5, 2014 – CoolCleveland.com\n\nby Laura Kennelly\n\nReview of: Sephardic Journey – Wanderings of the Spanish Jews\n\n“Apollo’s Fire shone forth in another innovative and brilliant new program: Sephardic Journey: Wanderings of the Spanish Jews.

With performers of such reliable quality and a director who choreographs the proceedings down to the tiniest detail, Apollo’s Fire always puts on a good show…”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire arrives at a hit with new ‘Sephardic Journey’ program\n\nFebruary 24, 2014 – The Plain Dealer\n\nby Mark Satola\n\n“The question one might ask, upon experiencing Apollo’s Fire’s new evening-length “Sephardic Journey: Wanderings of the Spanish Jews,” is why they waited so long to put it together. It certainly has the potential to be the ensemble’s biggest hit since their long-running “Sacrum Mysterium: A Celtic Christmas Vespers” presentation… Certainly, if one is to judge from the audience’s acclaim at Saturday night’s performance at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Cleveland Heights, Sorrell and company have a new favorite on their hands, one which is likely to become a regular event.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire sets Cleveland aflame\n\nFebruary 24, 2014 – Bachtrack\n\nby Frank Kuznik\n\n“Who says American early music bands can’t play European music? Apollo’s Fire, the Cleveland-based early music ensemble that will be touring the UK and Austria with Sandrine Piau in May,took local fans on a journey to medieval Spain this past weekend with delightfully authentic songs of the Sephardic Jews. The spirit and sound of the music could have come straight out of a Middle Eastern bazaar, mixed with spices ranging from ancient prayer chants to Italian Baroque… This was a scholarly, imaginative program that only a skillful and adventuresome ensemble could pull off. The packed house it attracted suggests that for both players and audiences,there are fascinating worlds to explore beyond the traditional borders of Baroque.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire — Praetorius Christmas Vespers at Trinity Cathedral (December 14)\n\nDecember 17, 2013 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Daniel Hathaway\n\n“Well before the more pietistic style of Lutheran church music that Johann Sebastian Bach wrote at Leipzig in the second quarter of the eighteenth century came the Italian-influenced, Renaissance style ofMichael Praetorius, the subject of Jeannette Sorrell’s well-crafted and expertly performed Christmas Vespers with Apollo’s Fire…There were too many special moments to count… In reviving the Praetorius Vespers program, Apollo’s Fire has provided a compelling alternative to the area’s holiday concert scene.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire brings ancient folk and liturgical music to vibrant life in ‘Sacrum Mysterium’\n\nDecember 6, 2013 – The Plain Dealer\n\nby Mark Satola\n\n“There’s no mystery to the endless popularity of Apollo’s Fire’s “Sacrum Mysterium,” a musical retelling of the Christmas story through ancient liturgical settings and Celtic songs and dances. The inexpressible otherworldliness evoked by the source material’s antiquity, and its modal musical rhetoric, so deeply rooted in folk song, strike a resonant chord in every hearer…There could be no better setting for this musical trip through the ages than Trinity’s richly detailed evocation of centuries-old ecclesiastical architecture. Central to “Sacrum Mysterium” is the role taken again this year by soprano Meredith Hall, a singer of such artistic skill and timbral purity that it’s hard to imagine another singer taking her place.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire players offer an enticing taste of Baroque ‘Tangos and Fandangos”\n\nNovember 19, 2013 – The Plain Dealer\n\nby Mark Satola\n\n“A streamlined ensemble drawn from the ranks of Apollo’s Fire, the Cleveland Baroque Orchestra, presented a loosely themed program last weekend called “Tangos and Fandangos,” with music by Luigi Boccherini and modern pasticheur “René Duchiffre.” …In both the String Quintet in E Major (with a second cello added) and the Guitar Quintet No. 4 in D Major, Boccherini’s highly conversational style was in evidence, as violinists Olivier Brault and Andrew Fouts, violist Karina Schmitz and cellists René Schiffer and Mimé Brinkman masterfully navigated the music’s resourceful (and unique) deployment of melody and counterpoint…The tango finale was a textural delight, with the three upper-string players in close harmony, and a return of the evening’s guitarists, with Simms this time playing a long-necked chitarrone.

Apollo’s Fire has thrived and blossomed under the sure hand of music director Jeanette Sorrell for more than 20 years. In that time, Cleveland’s Baroque orchestra has made steady inroads into worldwide awareness, garnering acclaim for its lively and alert performances of Baroque and Renaissance repertoire.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire “Virtuoso Orchestra” at Fairmount Presbyterian Church, Cleveland Heights (October 12)\n\nOctober 15, 2013 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Nicholas Jones\n\n“As Apollo’s Fire heads out on a real tour across North American, last weekend’s set of concerts gave us a virtual tour of some of the top orchestras across Europe—all without leaving our seats. Talk about not leaving a carbon footprint!…The theme, “virtuoso orchestra,” led music director Jeannette Sorrell to feature concertos in which Apollo’s Fire’s soloists could step forward and dazzle us as their counterparts 300 years ago must have done. It is a remarkable strength of this group that so many excellent soloists could emerge from the ranks of the orchestra, play these very challenging parts, and then rejoin the ripieno, as the back-benchers were called at the time.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire Countryside Concerts — “My Father was a Matchmaker,” June 6\n\nJune 9, 2013 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Alexandra A.

In true communal fashion, the ensemble was the star of the show. Each person was able to garner a few moments in the spotlight, but the real gem was the collective group — they musically embodied the symbolism of the Claddagh ring – love, loyalty, and friendship…Ross Hauck (tenor) demonstrated breadth of character as the jaunty limerick raconteur one moment and then drew us in close for his fatherly perspective on “Danny Boy.” I could almost envision Mr. Seamus Ennis smiling while Brian Bigley played the uilleann pipes, and his Irish dancing was clearly world class.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire Countryside Players charm with Irish tunes, humor\n\nJune 8, 2013 – The Plain Dealer\n\nby Mark Satola\n\n“The Apollo’s Fire Countryside Players launched their 15th summer season with a program of Irish reels and airs, and wry, rambling tales from internationally renowned storyteller Foley, entitled “My Father Was a Matchmaker.” …Ireland was evoked in sound by the Countryside Players, who created a glowing web of plucked, bowed and struck strings, pierced by the tart notes of Bigley’s uilleann pipes, the sharp pennywhistle or the soft, dovelike notes of the wooden flute. High tenor Hauck sang the sentimental airs with the requisite delicacy…The most electrifying notes of the evening were sounded by Bigley’s block-heeled dancing shoes, as he stepped a loud and complex tattoo on the wooden stage, at one point trading licks with (and besting) the Irish frame drum, the bodhran, played by guitarist Coulter.”\n\nRead More\n\nOberlin Artist Recital Series — Apollo’s Fire in “Mozart & Papa Haydn” in Finney Chapel (April 28)\n\nApril 30, 2013 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Nicholas Jones\n\n“Apollo’s Fire burnt bright with the intensity of the mature Haydn and the brilliance of the young Mozart…this concert assembled a big band—almost thirty instrumentalists—fitting for late 18th-century operatic and symphonic literature. The investment in such a richness of talent paid off in an extraordinary mixture of precision, energy, and richness…This was Apollo’s Fire at its best: crisp, exciting, and beautifully transparent. Bass lines energized the music from below; in the middle, inner voices shone through with ease; oboes, flutes, and violins dazzled with rapid and always-varying intricacies. Music director Jeannette Sorrell—for these concerts, not conducting from the harpsichord— energized the entire group with forceful and intelligent leadership…in addition, we were treated to the stunning voice of soprano Amanda Forsythe, one of the stars in the constellation of young early-music opera singers.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire and mesmerizing soprano illuminate music of Mozart and Haydn\n\nApril 27, 2013 – The Plain Dealer\n\nby Donald Rosenberg\n\n“…it was an almost unqualified delight to hear… Mozart, especially as young wizard, received more attention than Haydn, but the pairing placed these towering composers and friends in striking perspective. Another irresistible aspect of the program was Amanda Forsythe, who is billed as a soprano but really must be considered an enchantress. She performed four arias, including Cherubino’s “Voi che sapete” from Mozart’s “The Marriage of Figaro” as an encore, with such beauty of tone, expressive depth and silken agility that all you could do was submit to the exquisite artistry… the performances exemplified Apollo’s Fire trademarks of clarity, dexterity and subtlety of nuance…In everything, the orchestra’s strings gleamed and scampered, the winds were poetic and alive, and the natural horns sounded noble and secure.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire: Handel’s Messiah in Rocky River (December 16)\n\nDecember 18, 2012 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Nicholas Jones\n\n“Jeannette Sorrell led a highly dramatic rendering of the piece that made the most of the theatrical basis of the music. Messiah takes us through a great and complicated plot… In the Apollo’s Fire performance, that plot was gripping at almost every moment…Meredith Hall’s clear and focused voice, coupled with her passionate delivery, were as close to heaven as I might imagine achieving in a concert hall or a church.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire continues holiday offerings with Handel’s Messiah\n\nDecember 12, 2012 – The Plain Dealer\n\nby Donald Rosenberg\n\n“Music Director Jeannette Sorrell… succeeded in drawing the audience into another world.

From the lightest of touches to the majestic proclamations, the ensemble provided lucidity and fervor.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire revives wondrous ‘Celtic Christmas’ program\n\nDecember 8, 2012 – The Plain Dealer\n\nby Donald Rosenberg\n\n“Apollo’s Fire… has shown a welcome knack for crisscrossing between periods and genres. Nowhere is this more evident than in its smashing holiday presentation known as “Sacrum Mysterium,” or “Sacred Mystery – A Celtic Christmas.” Music director Jeannette Sorrell devised the program last year with Sylvain Bergeron, artistic director of Ensemble La Nef of Montreal, and it’s back this season in a version that confirms the brilliance and poignancy of the concept. At Friday’s concert, Sorrell joined… the orchestra’s crackerjack chorus, in a performance at turns mellifluous, cozy and raucous. How can such qualities share the same stage? Sorrell and Bergeron created a narrative that weaves together ancient art and folk traditions with a keen blend of reverence and rousing personality. The sound of a distant bagpipe introduces the evening, with the chorus and soprano Meredith Hall processing down the central aisle. What follows is a mesmerizing array of seasonal delights, which Sorrell and company perform with a special mix of sophistication and zest. The orchestra’s superb CD and DVD of the program have just been released by Avie Records. It likely will keep listeners glued to their speakers or earbuds for decades to come. But seeing “Sacred Mystery” is an altogether different and wondrous experience…”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire and guests exult in Baroque ‘blues’\n\nNovember 4, 2012 – The Plain Dealer\n\nby Donald Rosenberg\n\n“There wasn’t a moment during the program Apollo’s Fire presented Saturday at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Cleveland Heights when the mind or ears wandered from the delectable music and enchanting performances….Sorrell, always quick to make connections between music of distant eras, imagined the program as a night at a blues café in 1610. These particular blues were conjured by much-heralded composers, such as Claudio Monteverdi and Marc-Antoine Charpentier, and others of less renown but equal spunk and poetry…Throughout the night, the Apollo’s Fire musicians had a grand time playing old-time blues with their guests – soprano Snaidas, tenor haute-contre Karim Sulayman, tenor Oliver Mercer and baritone Jeffrey Strauss. Snaidas was an expressive marvel in Monteverdi’s “Lamento Della Ninfa” and coquettish delight in Barbara Strozzi’s “L’Amante Secreto.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire’s Passacaglia Baroque Blues Club opens for the weekend in Cleveland\n\nNovember 2, 2012 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Timothy Robson\n\n“One of the enchanting aspects of Apollo’s Fire’s concerts…are their stage presentation and director Jeanette Sorrell’s fluency in making even fairly obscure concerts and music interesting to a general audience, as well as those versed in early music…Ms. Sorrell structured the program around the idea of the blues club, in which the singers and instrumentalists came and went from the stage, danced, and participated in the “party” at hand… Just as when one goes to a fun party, this was a delightful evening spent at the Apollo’s Fire Baroque Blues Club…And the passacaglia turned out not to be the least bit dull.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire and Zimmermann’s Coffee\n\nOctober 27, 2012 – The Kansas City Metropolis\n\nby Tom Marks\n\n“Apollo’s Fire brought to Kansas City the taste of delightful German Kaffee Saturday night with their concert, “A Night at Zimmermann’s Café” for the Friends of Chamber Music. The program was comprised of music inspired by the eighteenth-century Leipziger Gottfried Zimmermann and his famous coffee house. Throughout the concert, an air of tasteful historicism, free from pedantry, circulated amid the theater as artistic director and harpsichordist Jeannette Sorrell enlightened listeners between pieces to the broader cultural context of the music’s role and its essential place among coffee-house musicians. With works by Bach, Telemann, and Vivaldi, the Cleveland-based ensemble brought the baroque’s characteristic contrasts of formal niceties and the heated passions to the stage, effectively reconstructing the intimate Kaffeehaus in the Folly Theater.\n\nThe program began with a concerto by one of Zimmerman’s most famous patrons, J. S. Bach. The Concerto for Two Violins in D minor opened the night and was headed by Oliver Brault and Johanna Novom. The overall approach to Bach’s double concerto was fresh and exciting.\n\nOpening the concert’s second half was Bach’s Brandenburg Concerto No. 5, BWV 1050. The concertino included Jeanette Sorrell on harpsichord, Oliver Brault on violin, and Kathie Stewart on the transverse flute. The small group had great chemistry together and an intuitive sense of ensemble. The highest praise should be given to Sorrell for her execution of the extended cadenza near the end of the first movement. Sorrell played with impeccable precision, all the while maintaining full control of the cadenza’s momentum. Most impressive was Sorrell’s intentional exploitation of the numerous cadence points in the cadenza where, when coupled with the section’s relentless rhythm, draw the ear toward an expected conclusion only to be thrown into more and more tumultuous churning.\n\nThe night closed with an arrangement of Vivaldi’s Variations on “La Follia,” originally scored for two violins and continuo, but transcribed by Sorrell for orchestra in concerto grosso setting. The impressive showpiece left the audience buzzing (without the influence of caffeine) and brought them to their feet at the concert’s conclusion. The ensemble’s overall ability to simply have fun while making good music, paired with their stellar technical abilities, contributed to an excellent concert—one which was fuelled by historical research but never managed to neglect the basic human elements inherent in the music.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire: Brandenburg Concertos at Fairmount Presbyterian (October 13)\n\nOctober 16, 2012 – ClevelandClassical.com\n\nby Nicholas Jones\n\n“I would guess that most classical-music concertgoers know Bach’s Brandenburg concertos pretty well. But hearing Apollo’s Fire play three of them this weekend was, for me, to hear them new. What was new? Most obviously, the instruments. In Brandenburg #1, two hunting horns brought their raucous, forest flavor indoors…Here, Paul Avril and Todd Williams were the hornists, mastering these unwieldy beasts with utter aplomb…the second aspect of what was new: the skill level of the performances… Sorrell outdid herself in the stunning solo [of Brandenburg #5], generating a tightly wound energy in the passagework that spilled out into a roller coaster of almost terrifyingly dizzying scales.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire opens season with three Brandenburgs of Bach\n\nOctober 13, 2012 – The Plain Dealer\n\nby Donald Rosenberg\n\n“Audiences have come to expect surprises from Apollo’s Fire, the Cleveland Baroque Orchestra, which is one reason the ensemble is so popular.

Rather, go to the Baroque Music Barn in Hunting Valley. Go to Huntington Playhouse in Bay Village. Go to Geauga Lyric Theater in Chardon. Go anywhere, really, this weekend where Apollo’s Fire, the Cleveland Baroque Orchestra, is presenting “Celtic Crossings: Songs and Stories of the Irish-American Journey.” A sampling of Irish traditional music, dancing and storytelling, performed by experts and natives, the program, part of the orchestra’s “Countryside Concerts,” is a substantial and highly effective dose of culture only a leisurely trip around the Emerald Isle, complete with pints of Guinness, could top.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire presents a lithe, beguiling production of Mozart’s “The Magic Flute”\n\nMarch 23, 2012 – The Plain Dealer\n\nby Donald Rosenberg\n\n“Mozart’s “The Magic Flute” is such a smorgasbord of whimsy and mysticism that musicians and stage directors never run out of ways to interpret the opera. Apollo’s Fire, the Cleveland Baroque Orchestra, has trimmed the score, libretto and theatrics for its production this week at three locations. In doing so, music director Jeannette Sorrell and superb colleagues have created a lithe “Magic Flute” of captivating and touching vibrancy… Stage director Linda Brovsky and choreographer Carlos Fittante came up with delightful solutions to some of the opera’s theatrical puzzles…Sorrell shaped the score with a knowing blend of momentum and elasticity, drawing lucid playing from her remarkable period-instrument orchestra and making glittery contributions at the keyed glockenspiel to depict Papageno’s magic bells…Nearly two decades ago, Apollo’s Fire made its debut in Mozart’s Requiem. Isn’t it just like this most generous of composers to help Sorrell and company celebrate their 20th anniversary in such rousing and eloquent fashion?”\n\nRead More\n\nClassical Fireworks: A Fine Champagne\n\nNovember 14, 2011 – El Paìs (The major national newspaper of Spain)\n\nby J.

The shadow of the American Louis Armstrong was evoked in spirit to perfection by his compatriots from Cleveland, Apollo’s Fire Baroque Orchestra, thanks to some dazzling variations on the trio sonata “La Follia” by Vivaldi.

Part of the evening’s success also flowed from the sense of artistic collaboration, as Apollo’s Fire here was far more than a backup band. The group without Jaroussky played two Vivaldi concertos on the first half and later pulled out Sorrell’s arrangement of Vivaldi’s “La Follia’’ trio sonata, uncorking it like a Baroque party piece, dashed off from memory. These excellent young musicians take a highly gestural approach to phrasing and bring across their music with an exuberant physicality, like wind through a forest.”\n\nRead More\n\nJaroussky Dazzles in Arias Raised from Opera’s Splendid Shipwrecks\n\nNovember 2, 2011 – The Toronto Globe & Mail\n\nby Robert Everett-Green\n\n“Apollo’s Fire’s flair for drama was perhaps best displayed in a grand rumpus performance of Sorrell’s arrangement of La Follia, from a Vivaldi triosonata. This party piece, played from memory, featured many steep and rapid changes in tone, texture and rhythmic character. One of the most interesting and rewarding recitals of the season.”\n\nRead More\n\nMusic Review: Apollo’s Fire and Philippe Jaroussky at Royce Hall\n\nOctober 29, 2011 – The Los Angeles Times\n\nby Rick Schultz\n\n“A thrilling program.

Even composers of the period were happy to borrow (sometimes from themselves) and tweak to suit an artist or a performance situation.\n\nSo it was no surprise to find that virtually everything on the program Apollo’s Fire, the Cleveland Baroque Orchestra, offered Friday at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Cleveland Heights was an arrangement. What was surprising, and often delightful, was the rambunctious nature of much of the music-making.\n\nThe guest director was German recorder player Matthias Maute, who devised a program titled “Bach, Telemann & the Bohemian Gypsies.” What, you may ask, do gypsies have to do with Bach and Telemann? Possibly nothing in the case of the former and something in the case of the latter.\n\nThe works Maute brought along did prove how mutable the music is. The two Bach concertos for recorder were Maute arrangements of harpsichord pieces. Apollo’s Fire music director Jeannette Sorrell, who served as the program’s luxuriant harpsichordist, exerted “revenge” by arranging a Telemann recorder polonaise for her instrument.\n\nIt took a while to get used to the Bach concertos as shaped by Maute, who favors lickety-split tempos that almost make you dizzy. In Bach’s “Italian Concerto,” he created an eruptive sense of motion in the first movement while managing the virtuoso writing with easy assurance. Things settled down in the slow movement, to which Maute applied a spectrum of expressive nuances, and became rollicking in the final Presto.\n\nBach’s Harpsichord Concerto in D minor was another vehicle for Maute to display remarkable facility and breath control, despite some clipped phrases and overly emphatic gestures.\n\nThe gypsy portions of the evening were drawn from the Uhrovska manuscript, so named for the Slovakian town where the music was found. As arranged by Maute, these exuberant and moody pieces are intriguing glimpses into the world of itinerant musicians who added local flavors to their sonic stews.\n\nIn one piece, Maute rolled his eyes like a mad scientist, played in animated unison with the strings and encouraged the violins to go at the music as if they were lusty country fiddlers. In another, violinist Olivier Brault – who’ll serve as concertmaster of Apollo’s Fire for the 2011-12 season – took wild Hungarian flight, sending the intricacies into charismatic orbit.\n\nThere was also a Sorrell arrangement of a piece by a “Baroque” composer named Maute (yes, the same), Concerto delle Zingari for Harpsichord, Recorder and Violin. With roots planted in the world of gypsies (zingari), it’s a fair facsimile of an old score, with foot stomping, a Celtic-hued slow movement and a folksy final dance complete with ensemble shout of “Hey!”\n\nMaute teamed here vibrantly with Sorrell and Brault (playing an adorable violino piccolo) and then shared the stage with traverso (transverse flute) player Kathie Stewart in Telemann’s Concerto in E minor for Traverso and Recorder. The program’s only score not arranged, it received a performance of wide dynamic swings, stately phrasing and no-hold-barred gusto.”\n\nRead More\n\nApollo’s Fire brings Handel’s “Messiah” into warm and dramatic focus\n\nDecember 17, 2010 – The Plain Dealer\n\nby Donald Rosenberg\n\n“In the biggest hit of his fruitful career, “Messiah,” George Frideric Handel applied an especially buoyant touch to the words “rejoice greatly.”\n\nApollo’s Fire, the Cleveland Baroque Orchestra, heeds those words to special effect throughout its performance of Handel’s oratorio. But music director Jeannette Sorrell, the orchestra, Apollo’s Singers and a vocal quartet also rejoice intimately.\n\nFor its “Messiah” this year, Apollo’s Fire fields 20 instrumentalists and 27 singers. That’s a far cry from the days when gargantuan forces – hundreds or even thousands – wrapped limbs, embouchures and larynxes around the work’s beloved music.\n\nA “Messiah” on a small scale can sound either meager or intensely dramatic, depending on the depth of vision the musicians bring to Handel’s score. As performed by Sorrell and company Thursday at First Baptist Church of Greater Cleveland in Shaker Heights, the oratorio was catapulted into immediate and dramatic focus.\n\nAudiences only rarely have the opportunity to hear “Messiah” complete, as Apollo’s Fire is offering the work this weekend. Along with the famous selections, including the adored “Hallelujah Chorus,” the oratorio contains a host of delectable pieces that help connect the listener to the story of Christ.\n\nSorrell, serving both as conductor and harpsichordist, reduces “Messiah” to its ample essence by treating the score as a series of stark contrasts. Nothing is taken for granted in terms of phrasing, gradation or tempo. The flexibility and suavity of the ensemble’s expert period-instrument players allow details to emerge that put Handel’s creation in fresh perspective.\n\nAt Thursday’s performance, Sorrell and her colleagues reveled in nuances, sometimes going to extremes to convey emotional transformations. In “All We, Like Sheep,” the fleetness of the opening section gave way to almost motionless consideration of the ensuing dark sentiments.\n\nThe reverse also occurred. The score’s final “Amen” moved from rapt utterance to glorious exultation, like a flower sprouting and blossoming before our ears. It didn’t hurt that the orchestra’s articulate chorus, Apollo’s Singers, can shift gears from buttery smoothness to golden strength at the flick of a vocal cord.\n\nThe solo quartet is one of the most impressive Apollo’s Fire has amassed in recent seasons. Soprano Meredith Hall poured expressive grace and tonal shimmer into every line, while mezzo-soprano Amanda Crider brought bountiful warmth to her duties.\n\nRoss Hauck proved brilliantly equal to the lyrical and dramatic tenor demands. Baritone Jeffrey Strauss’ noble account of “The Trumpet Shall Sound” with Baroque trumpeter Barry Bauguess was a highlight, as were contributions by violinists Olivier Brault and Johanna Novom.\n\nA cosy hallelujah to all.”\n\nRead More\n\nSophie Daneman, Apollo’s Fire: Cleveland Baroque Orchestra, Wigmore Hall\n\nDecember 1, 2010 – The ArtsDesk (London"
