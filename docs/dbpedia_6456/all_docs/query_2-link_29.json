        "text": "Youth Theatre Carson City is thrilled to announce auditions for \"Annie, Jr.,\" a 60-minute adaptation of the hit Broadway musical based on the classic comic strip.\n\nAuditions will be held August 17, 2024, 10 a.m. in the Bob Boldrick Theatre at the Carson City Community Center. The show will run eight performances, January 17-26, 2025 also in the Bob Boldrick Theatre at the Carson City Community Center.\n\nWith equal measures of pluck and positivity, little orphan Annie charms everyone’s hearts despite a next-to-nothing start in 1930’s New York City.\n\nAnnie is determined to find her parents who abandoned her years ago on the doorstep of an orphanage run by the cruel Miss Hannigan. Annie eventually foils Miss Hannigan’s evil machinations, finding a new home and a family in billionaire Oliver Warbucks, his personal secretary, Grace Farrell, and a lovable mutt named Sandy. Featuring favorite songs such as “It’s A Hard Knock Life,” “You’re Never Fully Dressed Without A Smile,” and “Tomorrow,” Annie, Jr. is a must-do for every young performer.\n\nWe are looking for actors, singers, and dancers grades K-12, who will be cast to play all of the beloved Annie, Jr. characters including the unflappable orphan, Annie; the debonair Oliver Warbucks and his elegant secretary Grace; the evil Miss Hannigan and her nefarious cohorts, Rooster and Lily; the tough but lovable band of orphans; and a host of colorful characters who help bring the world of 1930’s New York City to life.\n\nAuditions for Annie, Jr. will be held Saturday, August 17, 2024 at 10am in the Bob Boldrick Theatre at the Carson City Community Center. Auditions are open to all youth grades K-12.\n\nAudition information and materials can be found on our website. For information, please contact Youth Theatre Carson City at 775.315.2501 or visit youththeatrecarsoncity.com."
