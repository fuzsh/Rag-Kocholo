Trust me, you won’t want to miss it!”\n\n– A View from the Box\n\nThe true spirit of the season comes to life in this beloved classic, adapted as a 1940’s radio broadcast before a live audience — you and the kids! Enjoy all the fun of live sound effects, retro jingles — and holiday time together.\n\nTransport yourself to 1945 Bedford Falls, as an ensemble cast of five retells the story as a vintage radio broadcast. Watch as each actor doubles as a foley artist (someone who creates amazing sound effects), producing a playful acoustic backdrop!\n\nIt’s a snowy Christmas Eve and George is struggling with an unfulfilled life of big dreams and even bigger disappointments. A lovable guardian angel by the name of Clarence appears and takes George under his wing, revealing what life might have looked like without him in it. In the true spirit of the holidays, George is reminded how precious life is, and the value of family, community and love.\n\n“One of THE BEST holiday shows around…FRESH, INVENTIVE.”\n\n– Chicago Sun Times\n\n“TREMENDOUS FUN…SPLENDID CAST.”\n\n– Our Theatre Voice\n\n“MOVING, JOYFUL, CELEBRATORY – INVENTIVE.”\n\n– The Slotkin Letter\n\n“WHAT MAGIC FOR KIDS to see how a sound is made, from a door slamming, to water splashing, to a fluttering of hanging metal that makes a tinkling sound. WONDERFUL.”\n\n– The Slotkin Letter\n\n“A well-loved tale told with style, charm and a heart so big it could burst the ribcage of the harshest Grinch.”\n\n– The Chicago Tribune\n\n“A fresh theatrical context that creates just the right kind of retro warmth. If you cry every time you see the movie, you’ll be blubbering away right on cue…Guaranteed.”\n\n– The Chicago Tribune\n\nPre-Show Family Activity\n\nFUN WITH FOLEY!\n\nInteractive Sound Effects Exhibit – IT’S FREE!\n\nVisit our Studio before the performance and have fun learning how to create your own sound effects from simple objects. You will have 15 minutes to try four sound effects, and to become a Foley Artist in Training! The exhibit is FREE and is offered for public performances only. More information HERE.\n\nPlease Note: Admission to the exhibit requires a ticket to the day’s performance. When booking your ticket, look for the Foley Exhibit add-on in the drop down menu. If you have any questions, please contact the Box Office at yptboxoffice@youngpeoplestheatre.org.\n\nContent Advisory\n\nIn this story the character of George Bailey begins to doubt his worth and becomes overwhelmed due to a financial crisis.
