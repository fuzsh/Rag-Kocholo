        "text": "In a captivating new addition to the Celine Haute Parfumerie collection, creative director Hedi Slimane unveils Zouzou, a scent that encapsulates the essence of utopic adolescence and the allure of eternal youth. Launched in June 2024, Zouzou joins the eleven exquisite fragrances that have defined the French fashion house's olfactory journey since 2019.\n\nSlimane's inspiration for Zouzou is deeply personal, as he explains: \"I wished to create a perfume about utopic adolescence, capturing an ideal of eternal youth. The recklessness of the young French writer Françoise Sagan, the ingenu boyishness of Jean Seberg filmed by Jean Luc Godard, the magnificent heroines of the Velvet Underground, together with the young women I was able to photograph for more than 20 years.\"\n\nThe name \"Zouzou\" itself is a playful and affectionate nickname that emerged in the last century to describe a young woman with short hair, evoking a sense of youthful charm and carefree spirit. This sentiment is perfectly captured in the fragrance's composition, which features an intoxicating blend of benzoin, tonka bean, patchouli, labdanum, vanillin, and musk. Zouzou opens with a burst of fresh, invigorating notes, followed by a warm and sensual heart of benzoin, tonka bean, and patchouli. The fragrance settles into a captivating base of labdanum, vanillin, and musk, creating a scent that is both youthful and sophisticated.\n\nTo bring Zouzou to life, Slimane collaborated with rising British-American actress and musician Esther-Rose McGregor, who was first photographed by the designer for the \"Tomboy\" collection video. McGregor's enigmatic presence and undeniable charm perfectly embody the essence of Zouzou, making her the ideal muse for this olfactory masterpiece.\n\nAs Celine continues to redefine the landscape of haute parfumerie—the pinnacle of luxury fragrance craftsmanship—Zouzou stands as a testament to Slimane's unwavering vision and the maison's commitment to creating fragrances that are both timeless and utterly modern. With its launch, Zouzou is set to become a coveted addition to the vanities of those who seek to embrace the reckless charm and eternal youth that lie at the heart of this captivating scent."
