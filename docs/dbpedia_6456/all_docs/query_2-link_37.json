        "text": "150 Great Feel-Good Movies to Stream Now\n\nWhat defines a feel-good movie? It’s hard to say. For some, a thrilling fight sequence or a series of Michael Bay-style explosions brings joy; for others, a jump scare does it. For others still, a satisfying mystery; for others romance is key. When putting together the below epic list of “feel-good” movies – a list we think will do movie lovers some good right now – we didn’t overthink it. As a staff, we at Rotten Tomatoes asked ourselves a basic question: What are the movies that, without fail, leave us feeling better than we did before we pushed play.\n\nA sort of criteria emerged from our responses. Below you’ll find movies that lean heavily into nostalgia – titles that evoke that comfy feeling of going to the cinema as a youngster to see films you’ll later watch dozens of times on cable (Hook, The Sandlot, Mrs. Doubtfire). You’ll also notice a preponderance of hilarious, and often goofy, comedies (Step Brothers, Friday, Spy), and a bit of romance, too (Crazy Rich Asians, When Harry Met Sally). You’ll find big names whose decades spent atop marquees have been a kind of comfort over the years to moviegoers (Toms Hanks and Cruise, Whoopi Goldberg, Eddie Murphy). And you’ll find the work of newer filmmaking voices that make us thrilled for the future of the medium (Taika Waititi, Olivia Wilde, and the team behind Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse).\n\nThe 150 titles featured in our guide to Great Feel-Good Movies are filled with laughs and heart, and characters you root for and relate to. In times like these, we think they’ll make good company.\n\n#150\n\nNow and Then (1995) 33%\n\n#150\n\nAdjusted Score: 33777%\n\nCritics Consensus: No consensus yet.\n\nSynopsis: Three strong women -- Roberta Martin (Rosie O'Donnell), Samantha Albertson (Demi Moore) and Tina \"Teeny\" Tercell (Melanie Griffith) -- return...
