        "text": "Mary Miles Minter (born Juliet Reilly; April 25, 1902– August 4, 1984) was an American actress. She appeared in 53 silent films from 1912 to 1923.\n\nIn 1922, Minter was involved in a scandal surrounding the murder of director William Desmond Taylor, for whom she professed her love. Although gossip implicated her mother, former actress Charlotte Shelby, as the murderer, Minter's reputation was tarnished, and she gave up her film career in 1923.\n\nEarly life\n\nMinter was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, the younger of two daughters born to J. Homer Reilly (1877–1958) and Lily Pearl Miles (later known as Broadway actress Charlotte Shelby; 1877–1957). Her sister was Margaret Reilly, who later became an actress using the name Margaret Shelby.\n\nCareer\n\nStage and film career\n\nAt the age of five, she accompanied her sister Margaret on an audition because no babysitter was available. She was noticed by the director and given her first part. She began her stage career and frequently was employed afterward, widely noted for both her talent and visual appeal. To avoid child labor laws while the 10-year-old was appearing in a play in Chicago in 1912, Charlotte Shelby obtained the birth certification of her older sister's deceased daughter from Louisiana, and Juliet became Mary Miles Minter.\n\nIn her screen debut, in which she was billed as Juliet Shelby, she appeared in the 1-reel short film The Nurse (1912). Her new stage name was applied, and Minter starred in the role as Viola Drayton, the fairy, in the 5-reel drama The Fairy and the Waif (1915).\n\nMinter's career steadily grew after that. She specialized in playing demure young women. With her photogenic features, blue eyes, and blonde curls, she emulated and later rivaled Mary Pickford.\n\nHer first movie for director William Desmond Taylor was Anne of Green Gables (1919). It was well-received, and Taylor actively promoted Minter. According to Minter, a romantic relationship developed between them. However, Minter (who had grown up fatherless) said Taylor had reservations from the outset and later curtailed the romance, citing their 30-year age difference. Other people who knew Taylor and Minter said he never reciprocated her feelings.\n\nLater career and retirement\n\nMinter made four more motion pictures for Paramount, with her last being The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (1923). When the studio did not renew her contract, she received many other offers but declined them all, saying she had never been happy as an actress.\n\nPersonal life\n\nMinter was involved with James Kirkwood Sr. for a time in 1916 when she was 15 years old. Minter and Kirkwood \"married\" without benefit of clergy in the countryside near Santa Barbara. .....\n\nIn late 1922, several months after Taylor's death, Minter became involved romantically for a time with then-news correspondent of Los Angeles and movie critic Louis Sherwin, who had at one time been married to actress Maude Fealy.\n\nIn 1925, Minter sued her mother for an accounting of the money Shelby had received for her during her screen career. The case was settled out of court, with the settlement being signed by Minter and Shelby at the American consulate in Paris, France, on January 24, 1927.\n\nIn 1934, a hearing took place in Los Angeles, in which Hilda Desey, the proprietor of a dress shop on Wilshire Blvd., claimed that Minter entered her shop and took a tweed dress valued at $55.00 by force. Minter countered in court by stating that she had helped finance Miss Desey's dress shop and that she took the dress as she was owed interest. The deputy district attorney declined to issue a complaint for either petty theft or malicious mischief, as it was decided that there was no evidence of malicious intent on the part of Minter.\n\nIn 1957, Minter and real estate developer Brandon O. Hildebrandt (1898–1965) were married. They remained married until Hildebrandt's death in 1965.\n\nLater years\n\nMinter commented she was content to live without her Hollywood career. She later reconciled with her mother and proclaimed her love for Taylor throughout her life. Minter's money had been invested in Los Angeles real estate, and she seems to have lived in relative comfort and prosperity. She later moved to a house in Santa Monica, California; her mother Charlotte Shelby died there in 1957.\n\nIn 1981, Minter was severely beaten in a burglary at her home in which more than $300,000 worth of antiques, china and jewelry were taken. A former live-in companion and three other people were charged with attempted murder and burglary. The police described her as a frail old woman, and people often were shocked to learn she had been a famous movie star.\n\nMinter died in 1984 at age 82 from a stroke in Santa Monica. She was cremated, and her ashes were scattered at sea. For her contribution to movies, she has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1724 Vine Street in Hollywood.\n\nLegacy\n\nMuch of Minter's work has been lost; of her 53 films, approximately a dozen are known to exist today. A print of her 1919 movie The Ghost of Rosy Taylor surfaced in New Zealand in the 1990s. Other known surviving movies include The Fairy and the Waif (1915), Youth's Endearing Charm (1916), A Dream or Two Ago (1916), The Innocence of Lizette (1916), The Eyes of Julia Deep (1918), Nurse Marjorie (1920), A Cumberland Romance (1920) and The Little Clown (1921).\n\nFilmography\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1912 The Nurse The Child Credited as Juliet Shelby 1915 The Fairy and the Waif Viola Drayton, the Fairy 1915 Always in the Way Dorothy North Lost film 1915 Emmy of Stork's Nest Emmy Garrett Lost film 1915 Barbara Frietchie (1915 film) Barbara, Mrs. Frietchie's granddaughter Lost film 1916 Rose of the Alley Nell Drogan 1916 Dimples Dimples 1916 Lovely Mary Mary Lane Lost film 1916 Youth's Endearing Charm Mary Wade 1916 Dulcie's Adventure Dulcie Lost film 1916 Faith Faith 1916 A Dream or Two Ago Millicent Hawthorne 1916 The Innocence of Lizette Lizette 1917 The Gentle Intruder Sylvia Partially lost 1917 Environment Liz Simpkins Lost film 1917 Annie-for-Spite Annie Johnson Lost film 1917 Periwinkle Periwinkle Lost film 1917 Melissa of the Hills Melissa Stark Lost film 1917 Somewhere in America Rose Dorgan 1917 Charity Castle Charity Lost film 1917 Her Country's Call Jess Slocum Lost film 1917 Peggy Leads the Way Peggy Manners 1917 The Mate of the Sally Ann Sally Lost film 1918 Beauty and the Rogue Roberta Lee Lost film 1918 Powers That Prey Sylvia Grant Lost film 1918 A Bit of Jade Phyllis King Lost film 1918 Social Briars Iris Lee Lost film 1918 The Ghost of Rosy Taylor Rhoda Eldridge Sayles 1918 The Eyes of Julia Deep Julia Deep 1918 Rosemary Climbs the Heights Rosemary Van Voort Lost film 1918 Wives and Other Wives Robin Challoner Lost film 1919 The Amazing Impostor Joan Hope Lost film 1919 The Intrusion of Isabel Isabel Trevor Lost film 1919 A Bachelor's Wife Mary O'Rourke Lost film 1919 Yvonne from Paris Yvonne Halbert Lost film 1919 Anne of Green Gables Anne Shirley Lost film 1920 Judy of Rogue's Harbor Judy Lost film 1920 Nurse Marjorie Lady Marjorie Killonan 1920 Jenny Be Good Jenny Riano Lost film 1920 A Cumberland Romance Easter Hicks 1920 Sweet Lavender Lavender Lost film 1920 Eyes of the Heart Laura Lost film 1921 All Soul's Eve Alice Heath/Nora O'Hallahan Lost film 1921 The Little Clown Pat 1921 Don't Call Me Little Girl Jerry Lost film 1921 Moonlight and Honeysuckle Judith Baldwin Lost film 1921 Her Winning Way Ann Annington Lost film 1922 Tillie Tillie Getz Lost film 1922 The Heart Specialist Rosalie Beckwith Lost film 1922 South of Suva Phyllis Latimer Lost film 1922 The Cowboy and the Lady Jessica Westoon Lost film 1923 Drums of Fate Carol Dolliver Lost film 1923 The Trail of the Lonesome Pine June Tolliver Lost film\n\nSee also"
