        "text": "Nymphs, pirates and a wizard feature in this year’s edition of the festival in upstate New York, which offers a balanced rendition of ‘La Calisto,’ a vibrant production of ‘The Pirates of Penzance’ and a premiere of the youth opera ‘Rumpelstiltskin and the Unlovable Children.’\n\nBy\n\nHeidi Waleson\n\nAug. 14, 2024 at 4:52 pm ET\n\nTshilidzi Ndou and Craig Irvin in ‘The Pirates of Penzance.’\n\nPHOTO: BRENT DELANOY/THE GLIMMERGLASS FESTIVAL\n\nCooperstown, N.Y.\n\nThe highlight of this season’s Glimmerglass Festival, a beguiling production of Francesco Cavalli’s “La Calisto” (1651), recalled the 1990s—when the company, then headed by Paul Kellogg, did a Baroque opera every year, setting off a vogue that other American houses would follow. Its 1996 “Calisto” featured Christine Goerke, now a renowned singer of Strauss and Wagner, among the leads. This year’s staging featured a stylish orchestral realization, including a few tastefully deployed wind and brass instruments, by Rob Ainsley, now in his second season as the festival’s artistic and general director. Mr. Ainsley conducted with brio from the keyboard with the support of a sensitive continuo section.\n\nCraig Irvin and Emilie Kealani in ‘La Calisto.’PHOTO: SOFIA NEGRON / GLIMMERGLASS FESTIVAL\n\nThe show carefully balanced the opera’s serious and comic depictions of love. Jove disguises himself as the goddess Diana in order to have his way with Calisto, one of her virgin nymphs; Juno, Jove’s consort, is jealous; Endymion, a shepherd, is in love with Diana, who is tempted by him; Linfea, another nymph, is curious about sex. Emilie Kealani’s light, delicate soprano was ideal for the innocent Calisto, effectively contrasted with Taylor Raven’s voluptuous-toned Diana—both the real one and Jove-in-disguise. Mezzo SarahAnn Duffy, stepping in for an indisposed colleague, was poignant as the lovelorn Endymion; her tenderly passionate duets with Ms. Raven were high points in the show. Eve Gigliotti brought a ferocious intensity to Juno, who turns Calisto into a bear. Amanda Sheriff’s bright soprano and hilariously lewd acting and dancing turned the Young Satyr into a potent scene-stealer. As Jove, Craig Irvin was properly imperious, though less vocally stylish than the other singers.\n\nContinue reading “Glimmerglass Festival Review: Between History and Fantasy”\n\nThe summer program includes the world premiere of ‘The Righteous’ along with four classics—‘Der Rosenkavalier,’ ‘La Traviata,’ ‘Don Giovanni’ and ‘The Elixir of Love’—brought closer to the present.\n\nBy\n\nHeidi Waleson\n\nAug. 5, 2024 at 6:15 pm ET\n\nMichael Mayes and the Santa Fe Opera ensemble\n\nPHOTO: CURTIS BROWN\n\nSanta Fe, N.M.\n\n“The Righteous,” having its world premiere at the Santa Fe Opera this summer, is the second collaboration of composer Gregory Spears and librettist Tracy K. Smith. Like their first, “Castor and Patience,” it is based on an original story with a complex, contemporary theme and a lot of potential. Set in the American Southwest between 1979 and 1990, it concerns a preacher, David (Michael Mayes), whose religious calling is tainted by his ambition and other personal flaws. However, like the earlier work, the opera is ensnared in a wordy and overly complicated libretto, with too many scenes and dramatic climaxes, especially in the second act, as well as numerous stretches of unoperatic exposition.\n\nIn a plot that covers races for governor and the expansion of David’s church against the backdrop of the Iran hostage crisis, AIDS and the crack epidemic, David’s actions and motives are questioned by three people who love him: Michele, his first wife (Jennifer Johnson Cano); Sheila, a parishioner with whom he has an affair and then marries (Elena Villalón); and Jonathan, Michele’s gay brother, who is also David’s longtime friend and would-be lover (Anthony Roth Costanzo). Their arias—though invariably too long—are the best moments in the opera, delving into their hearts with poetry and lyricism. But David is a cipher, and since Mr. Mayes, singing with a blaring, unsubtle baritone, doesn’t read as a handsome, charismatic young preacher, it is hard to understand their attraction to and belief in him. It’s a relief when they all break free at the end. Even though in the final aria (with chorus) David declares that “Life is long, and wisdom slow,” it’s not clear that he understands how his inability to love, as a Christian or a human, has been his downfall even as he has risen in the world.\n\nContinue reading “Santa Fe Opera Review: Time-Swapped Tales of Love”\n\nThese reviews first appeared in The Quarterly of the Lute Society of America in significantly altered form.\n\nThe modern guitar dominates the commercial music we hear in the west. Since the time of Elvis Presley and the Beatles, bands made up of fretted instruments and percussion have become the convention in popular music. The tradition of the players of guitar being the stars of non-religious art music is a long one, and includes not only Spain, but France, Italy and England as well. The idea of the guitarist improvisor/composer/performer is also not a new one.\n\nThe baroque guitar is one of the several variations on historical fretted instruments, of which the most well know is probably the lute. The baroque guitar was in its time perhaps most widely heard accompanying comic arias in operas of the baroque. In Latin American music of the period, is can similarly be part of a jubilant rhythm section playing in the rasqueado (strummed) style. There is a substantial solo repertoire of secular music, some of which is now played by modern guitarists. But the instrument remains somewhat obscure in the modern world, especially since it is difficult to perform as a soloist in public under contemporary concert circumstances due to its lack of capacity to project and the low volume of sound it produces (particularly when played in the punteado (or plucked) style. But digital recordings are a godsend for this music, because of the immediacy made possible by the microphone and the ability to crank up the volume, if one so desires.\n\nIt is therefore particularly remarkable, given the relative invisibilty of the instrument in the wider world that so many recordings of the baroque guitar and its music have landed in the “in-box” of the LSA in recent years. Musicians seeking to perform this music must not only become expert in the appropriate style, rhetoric and ornamentation for the genre, but they often must create their own performing editions from manuscripts or period printings. Clearly, playing this music, like most of early music for fretted instruments, is a labor of love – and certainly not a dry scholarly exercise. Several of the performers, playing at a high level of technique and sophistication, are names that were previously unknown to me. What follows is a report on the several disks that have piled up at the LSA featuring the historical guitar.\n\nContinue reading “THE GUITAR RULES”\n\nThese reviews first appeared in The Quarterly of the Lute Society of America in significantly altered form.\n\nLa Suave Melodia, Performance Practice in Italy 1600-1660, Ensemble Badinerie, Rahel Stoellger, flauto dolce, William Dongois. Cornetto, 68’09, 21 tracks, Accent Plus ACC10401, Recorded 2000, released 2010\n\nArguably, modern western musical harmony was born in and around the Veneto in Italy around 1605. Venice was in economic decline, it’s 700-year history as the portal between the world of the Byzantine world and the European was coming to an end. The militarily defensive value of being an island city state, and Venice’s form of maritime technology were being eclipsed by the financial and commodity traders in Amsterdam and London, and the multi-masted sailing goliaths being built elsewhere than Italy.\n\nAnd yet there was Venice as a magnet for musicians from all over the continent at that time. With its epicenter at the oddly shaped San Marco basilica (not even a Cathedral), where for decades Claudio Monteverdi reigned supreme after 1613. Cavalli, Schutz, Gabrielli all were associated with the Basilica at one time, and this musical flowering had reach – including courts as far away as Naples and as near as Mantua, Brescia and Milan. This disk of chamber music includes recorder, cornett, dulcian, keyboard and lute. The terminology regarding organology can be, as we know both confusing and inconsistent, as they are here. The notes to the recording make reference to cembalo, positive organ, zink, bassoon, theorbo and baroque guitar. The lutenist is Karl-Ernst Schröder, whose instruments are a Richard Earle “theorbo”, and a Peter Biffin “gitarre.”\n\nThe recording features excellent ensemble playing by the Badineries, led by Vienna-based recorder player Rachel Stoellger. This is secular instrumental music from the first half of the 17th century, repertoire of which we don’t hear enough. This was chamber music, some of which was composed to be played in the great scuola of Venice. The scuola were more guilds than schools and were fabulously decorated by the leading painters primarily of the 16th Century, the most famous of which is the scuola San Rocco, decorated with breath-taking paintings by Tinteretto. Being among the wealthy citizens of Venice attending concerts in this space must have been an fine experience. And this recording gives a satisfying taste of what that must have been like. Something quite different from the grand music of the opera house and church of this period with which we are more familiar. The composers on the recording are unfamiliar names, except for Merula – who contributes a “Ciacona,” which, given the basic descending bass pattern of the chiccone and the nature of improvisatory performance practice of the period, could have been by anyone! The other pieces take the form of sonatas and dances.\n\nA particularly interesting aspect of these performances is the high visibility of the bassoon (played with brio and skill by Christian Beuse), which is not just a participant in the continuo section, but also a virtuosic soloist. The theorbo, by contrast is inaudible, and the guitar plays a percussive part under the playing of the passacaglio and the ciacona. The recorder was not part of the ensemble at San Marco during this period, and so the sonatas for soprano recorder were a showcase. The sonata was a newish name for a musical form at this time, and these works are of a type that are the germ of what became a long history of art music composed for small ensembles. The compositional style generally features parallel lines (often in thirds) over a harmony created by a figured bass. Polyphony is in the past. Modern harmony is in the future. Here is a very well-presented kernel of the musical future from, perhaps, the most important transitional period in Western musical history, created for artistically remarkable spaces, during the closing years of the long run of an empire of previously unsurpassed wealth and global power.\n\nSettecento, Baroque Instrumental Music from the Italian States, La Serenissima, Adrian Chandler director/violin, Tabera Debus recorder, 27 tracks, 70’48, Signum Records SIGCD663; 2021\n\nWe’ve come a long way since what was once called the “sewing machine” music of Il Soloisti Venti of the 1950’s performances of baroque music for mostly strings on modern instruments, with steel strings. This recording of English ensemble, La Serenissima, is an exemplary example of contemporary string band performance practice, under the direction of violinist, Adrian Chandler. Following in Monteverdi’s wake, Italy from about 1650 to about 1740 flowered with talented string players (and instrument makers!), and the repertoire for them is vast and diverse – featuring a wide range of concerted instruments.\n\nChandler’s playing is lively and precisely pitched, and his leadership is spirited. There is a guest appearance of a half dozen of the tracks of English Lute Society stalwart, Lynda Sayce on theorbo and baroque guitar in the continuo group. The disk includes music of the first half of the 18th Century by composers both of La Serenissima itself (Venice) and of the Kingdom of Naples. The composers include Alessandro Scarlatti, Tartini and Vivaldi, but also the less familiar names of Dall’Abaco, Vandini, Mancini, Brescianello. The seven included works are six in sonata form and one concerto for recorder and two violins. Two of the sonatas are also for recorder and two violins; one sonata is for cello, one is for two violins and two are for solo violin. All are scored with continuo, performed mostly with harpsichord.\n\nThe music presented here is wonderfully engaging in these performances. Chandler is an impressively virtuosic player, with great flair and theatricality, without excess, and his note in the CD package in quite interesting about the manuscript sources of the scores. Tabera Debus (who teaches at the school of the Wells Cathedral – a very cool gig!) is equally impressive and refined in the works for recorder. The tracks featuring the interplay of recorder and violin are the standouts on the album and are particularly enjoyable. There are seven players involved in this recording, and they make a full, rich, stylish sound together. Unfortunately, in the works calling for a larger band, the ensemble work can tend toward the insufficiently well-coordinated. But otherwise, the music making is bright, clear and pleasing.\n\nChandler has made thirteen recordings with the group, which, to my best knowledge, has not performed in the U.S. Why not?\n\nContinue reading “La Serenissima – Italian Music for Lute (and others)”"
