        "text": "Over the next few weeks, I’ll discuss some ofÂ the things I’ve been doing this past 10 months when I mostly haven’t been blogging.\n\nThey include what one might call Internet research rabbit holes, obsessions with obscure corners of pop-culture arcana.\n\nOne of these obsessions is a “rabbit hole” in more ways than one.\n\nIt starts with something everybody knows, even if it hasn’t been at the pop-cult forefront in recent years.\n\nâ€¢\n\nWarner Bros.’ classic Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons haven’t been on broadcast TV in years. The one basic cable channel they’ve been on, Cartoon Network, had lately only shown them on weekday mornings, and only when that time slot wasn’t being used to rerun some Tom & Jerry or Scooby-Doo direct-to-video movie. CN’sÂ not showing them at all now. You have to pay extra for CN’sÂ premium-tier channel Boomerang to see these timeless classics.\n\nEven worse for longtime fans, no LT/MM shorts have been issued on DVD (aside from reissues) since late last year. With the industry-wide collapse of disc sales, Warner Home Video has put any future digital remasters of old cartoons on hold.\n\nThe prolific WB cartoon studio made some 1,005 “classic” theatrical shorts over 40 years. Approximately 450 of them have yet to be digitally restored. A lot of those look really dingy in the old TV prints seen online.\n\nOh yeah: Almost all the LT/MM shorts can be found in unofficial online uploads. WB has gotten some of them removed from YouTube, but they just pop up on more obscure sites. (WB could put them up officially, and get whatever ad revenue there is to get, but mostly hasn’t.)\n\nWhile I was on my last extended “blog vacation” earlier this year, I set out to watch every darned one of the not-on-DVD Warner cartoons. About half of them feature the studio’s “A list” characters (Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tweety, etc.). Some of them (in the uploaded versions from old TV prints) look good enough to go on disc as is. Others look dingy, faded, and lo-res.\n\nTo keep the LT/MM “franchise” (and its lucrative merchandising) alive, WB needs to (at least) make new digital transfers of these not-on-DVD shorts, from the best existing film materials. This would make the films more viable in today’s hi-def era, for release on broadcast, cable, on-demand, streaming, and download “platforms,” as well as on disc. Perhaps some of the less “commercial” entries (the ones with minor or one-shot characters) could receive less of the labor-intensive digital retouching that was used forÂ the DVD releases.\n\nâ€¢\n\nAt the same time as I was re-viewing all those films, I also started to research the music used in them.\n\nThe studio’s great music directors, Carl Stalling and Milt Franklyn, incorporated more than 500 pre-existing compositions into their cartoon scores. They ranged from classical and folk pieces, to contemporary hits and songs from Warner feature films, to obscurities that had originally been published as sheet music for silent-music accompanists.\n\nWith the aid of several existing online lists of the “sampled” compositions, I put together a YouTube playlist of most of them. It’s currently up to 434 entries. They’re allÂ records or film clips of the original tunesâ€”not theÂ cartoon excerpts of them.\n\nIf you know them only from the cartoon versions (and you probably do), you’re in for a few surprises:\n\n“Hello Ma Baby,” the first frog-sung tune in One Froggy Evening,Â was originally a novelty song about a man in love with a woman he knows only as a voice on that then-new gadget, the telephone.\n\n“Those Endearing Young Charms,” used in the oft-repeated “exploding xylophone” gag, was originally a sorrowful ballad about a man promising his wife he’ll still love her in sickness and old age.\n\nâ€¢\n\nWarner might be mismanaging one of its most valuable assets; but other parties remain determined to keep the cartoons in the public eye.\n\nThey include the Chuck Jones Center forÂ Creativity, founded byÂ the Spokane boy who became the most famous of the studio’s several cartoon directors.\n\nThe Jones Center and the Jones heirs, along with the Smithsonian’s “touring exhibits” division, created What’s Up, Doc?: The Animated Art of Chuck Jones.Â It’s now at the EMP Museum in Seattle.\n\nIt’s got dozens of original art pieces and artifacts from Jones’s Warner, MGM, and indie films.\n\nIt’s got one of his most famous works, What’s Opera, Doc?, playing continuously (it never gets tiresome); plus a mysterious minute and a half of music recorded for “unproduced scenes” in that classic. (Wonder what they would have been?)\n\nIt’s got excerpts from several otherÂ Jones films (and one Tex Avery WB short, the defining Bugs Bunny film A Wild Hare),Â on flat-screen monitors around the exhibit space.\n\nIt’s got a few spots where you can take photos of one another alongside life-size cartoon props, such as under a “precariously” suspended prop anvil. (Photography’s forbidden in the rest of the exhibit.)\n\nIt’s got meticulous explanations and documentation about the now-threatened art of 2D animation.\n\nAnd it’s got plenty of words, pictures, and video footage about Jones (1912-2002).\n\nBesides hundreds of one-reel films for theaters, Jones also worked onÂ TV specials, instructionalÂ films, and a couple of animated features (Gay Purr-ee and The Phantom Tollbooth).\n\nAt Warner he created his own characters (the Road Runner and Coyote, Pepe le Pew) and developed characters created by or with other directors (Bugs, Daffy, Sylvester).\n\nLater, he adapted works byÂ Dr. Seuss, Walt (Pogo) Kelly, Rudyard Kipling, and his former Warner colleague Frank Tashlin, adjusting all of their individual artistic visions to his own.\n\nThematically, Jones’ films ranged from Disney-esque sentiment to violent slapstick and back again. Stylistically, they ranged from slick “realism” to almost pure abstraction (and, in his version of Norman Juster’s storyÂ The Dot and the Line, total abstraction).\n\nAnd while many animators were/are soft spoken and shy creatures, Jones was an inveterate and articulate self-promoter. He made books and documentaries about his works. He gave many interviews to animation historians, sometimes embellished for entertainment’s sake.\n\nAnd with the exhibit, his take on “the art of animation” has an immersible, walk-through incarnation. Viewers get to enjoy the finished films, and to learn in grit-detail about each of the many components that went into them.\n\nCan this help revive interest in “analog” animation?\n\nAnd, just as importantly, can it help rescue the classic WB shorts from extra-tier-cable-channel purgatory?"
