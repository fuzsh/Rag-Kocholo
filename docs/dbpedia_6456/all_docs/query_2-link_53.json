        "text": "There's no shortage of shows about young people who live and work in cities full of magic and missed opportunity; who chase their dreams to the point of physical and mental exhaustion; and who, against the odds, fall in love. But Netflix's Record of Youth combines the nuance of a slice-of-life story with the romantic whimsy of a Korean drama, and the end result is a reflection on youth that somehow feels both timely and timeless.\n\nStarring internet boyfriend Park Bo-gum and Parasite star Park So-dam, Record of Youth follows a group of young adults as they try to make it in the entertainment industry. Sa Hye-jun (Bo-gum) is a hard-working fashion model from working-class roots who dreams of a future on the big screen, while his best friend and career rival Won Hae-hyo (Byeon Woo-seok) struggles to prove himself as a model and actor who can land gigs by his own merit without his overbearing mother's money and help. And they eventually both get pulled into the orbit of sensible makeup artist and successful fangirl An Jeong-ha (So-dam), whose dream is to work hard and live a stable life.\n\nThis is a drama that has a bit of everything: romance, comedy, tears (Park Bo-gum is a beautiful crier), fashion, family screaming matches, incendiary chemistry between the leads, and astute commentary on privilege and celebrity. Oh, and BTS.\n\nBelow, get to know the cast and characters of Record of Youth, which has new episodes airing on Mondays and Tuesdays on Netflix.\n\nPark Bo-gum as Sa Hye-jun\n\nKnown as the \"Nation's Son-in-Law\" in South Korea, 27-year-old heartthrob Park Bo-gum brings his signature charm and empathy to the leading role of Sa Hye-jun.\n\nHye-jun is a scrappy, young twenty-something and semi Insta-famous model who dreams of becoming a successful actor. It's easier said than done. Balancing part-time jobs slinging deli meats and soju bottles with low-paying modeling gigs and relentless ambition, Hye-jun struggles to make ends meet while pursuing the big screen. This puts him at odds with his exasperated father, who wants his son to get his head out of the clouds and get serious about his future. But Hye-jun is nothing if not determined. And he does have a few allies in his corner: his well-meaning mother, an enthusiastic new manager, his best friend and handsome industry rival, Hae-hyo, and his playful grandfather/roommate, who likes to remind him that he was born to be a star. Of course, he already shines in the eyes of Jeong-ha, a witty makeup artist he meets in the pilot episode who also happens to be his biggest fan.\n\nHe ultimately gives himself one last shot to turn his dreams into reality before he has to fulfil his compulsory military service. (In a twist of art imitating life, Bo-gum enlisted in the South Korean navy on August 31 of this year.) For the actor, Hye-jun's struggles are relatable to his own experience in the entertainment field. \"I hope that my peers, who are also working toward their dreams, can relate to him,\" he told Soompi.\n\nPerhaps best known for his breakout role in Reply 1988, which is also available to stream on Netflix, and the popular fantasy period drama, Love in the Moonlight, Bo-gum is so captivating on screen that the phrase \"Park Bo-gum magic\" is widely used among fans. Equally as enchanting is his voice. The actor and entertainer graduated with a degree in musical theater from Myongji University — because perfection does exist in the human form of Park Bo-gum.\n\nPark So-dam as An Jeong-ha\n\nRecord of Youth is Park So-dam's first onscreen role since her breakthrough performance in Bong Joon-ho's Oscar-winning Parasite, which earned her and the cast a Screen Actors Guild Award and the adoration of Hollywood and film Twitter alike. But Parasite fans should prepare to see a new side to So-dam as An Jeong-ha, a newbie makeup artist by day and hard-working beauty and lifestyle YouTuber by night. When it comes to Jeong-ha, patience is life's most important virtue. (Her name sounds similar to the Korean word for \"stable,\" and her YouTube channel is even called \"I Like Stability.\")\n\nJeong-ha is passionate about three things: her work, her home (which she bought on a 30-year loan), and fashion model Sa Hye-jun. Described as a \"diligent fangirl\" by her best friend, Jeong-ha's love for Hye-jun imbues her with a sense of motivation. \"Fangirling over you is what keeps me going,\" she says to a photo of Hye-jun on her phone. (She has an entire folder full of his runway photos, proving that she's the show's most relatable character.) In Hye-jun, she finds someone who's just as diligent as she is, and the pair dance around each other while riding the highs and lows of following their dreams. For Jeong-ha, that means living a happy life of stability, without the vulnerability and unpredictability that comes with falling in love. Clearly, her blossoming friendship with Hye-jun will challenge some of those views.\n\n“I think that youth is constantly taking on new challenges and growing as a person,\" So-dam told Soompi about the drama's coming-of-age themes.\n\nRecord of Youth is the 29-year-old actor's first television drama in four years, having focused on film projects in recent years. Those looking to add two international titles to their movie queues should check out historical thriller The Silenced and supernatural drama The Priests, two titles that showcase So-dam's scene-stealing abilities in supporting roles. But following the runaway success of Parasite, a major leading role could be in her future. She's a favorite among Marvel fans to land the coveted role of Korean-American superhero Cindy Moon in Marvel's Silk television series.\n\nByeon Woo-seok as Won Hae-hyo\n\nModel and actor Byeon Woo-seok completes this inevitable love triangle as warm-hearted Won Hae-hyo, Hye-jun's best friend since childhood and his biggest competition in the industry.\n\nDespite their shared dream to parlay their modeling careers into movie stardom, Hae-hyo and Hye-jun couldn't be more different. They're like fire and ice: Hae-hyo with his soft, full features, and Hye-jun with his striking angles and steely gaze. There's also the fact that Hae-hyo was born into money, while Hye-jun is the housekeeper's son. Still, they both have something to prove, and they don't let their ambition and ego come between their friendship. The thought of succeeding at the other's expense is an uncomfortable one, especially for Hae-hyo, who uses his privilege and growing influence as a top model-turned-actor to help his friend. Though, unbeknownst to him, his cunning mother — who will do anything to see her son become a star, even if it means buying his Instagram followers — is secretly pulling the strings of his budding career.\n\n“Won Hae-hyo is a character who can’t stand being given an advantage because of his so-called ‘golden spoon,'\" Woo-seok told Soompi. \"He seems like someone who has no worries and should be happy, but he has a lot of inner pain and works hard.\" It's this inner turmoil, led by his desire to be taken seriously on his own merit, that makes Hae-hyo such a compelling second male lead. And with his swoopy hair and endearing smile, he's easy to root for.\n\nSince making his screen debut in 2016, 28-year-old Woo-seok has been in a handful of dramas, but his breakthrough came with last year's historical rom-com Flower Crew: Joseon Marriage Agency. He's also an incredible follow on Instagram.\n\nKwon Soo-hyun as Kim Jin-u\n\nActor Kwon Soo-hyun steps into the role of moppy-haired Jin-u, Hye-jun and Hae-hyo's bumbling best friend and their lovable third musketeer.\n\nAs a supporting character, it's Jin-u's job to bring the vibes — and he fulfills his duty with an electric mix of humor and heart. As the comic relief in the group's outings, Jin-u is a nice counterbalance to Hye-jun and Hae-hyo's push and pull dynamic, and he makes friends easily, as evidenced by his swift kinship with Jeong-ha. But don't be fooled by his bright demeanor; he's no less ambitious than his peers. He's a photographer's assistant with dreams of creating his own spotlight one day. (And he's also the only one in his inner circle with a sizzling love life; he's entwined in a secret romance with Hae-hyo's sister, proving that Jin-u's got game even if it's not always visible.)\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit different from Soo-hyun, check out the mystery sci-fi drama Abyss, also on Netflix.\n\nPark Se-hyun as Choi Su-bin\n\nNewcomer and 1998 liner Park Se-hyun may not have very many credits to her name (yet), but she's making the most of her screen time in Record of Youth as Jeong-ha's easily excitable best friend Su-bin.\n\nAn employee at Victory Hair & Makeup, Su-bin is always there to comfort Jeong-ha after she gets scolded by senior makeup artist Jin-ju (Jo Ji-seung) — and to give her a necessary dose of reality. In one of the first episode's most scarily relatable scenes, she tells Jeong-ha, who's swooning over Hye-jun's kind heart, \"the most pathetic thing a fangirl can do is complimenting a celebrity's personality. How do you know he's kind in real life?\" Su-bin is… not wrong! To be honest, we could all use a friend like her.\n\nShin Dong-mi as Lee Min-jae\n\nAs Hye-jun's novice manager Min-jae, actor Shin Dong-mi flexes her comedic chops. Despite her inexperience, Min-jae is passionate about turning Hye-jun into a star. Her tactics might be a bit eccentric, but her belief in Hye-jun and his dream is unwavering. And their unlikely partnership is a reminder to all that having a support system is not only crucial to achieving a goal but also to living a happy, successful life."
