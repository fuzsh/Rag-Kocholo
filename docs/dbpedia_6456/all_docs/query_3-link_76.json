        "text": "The Sobchak-Bot is Back\n\n...should I start with my Trump musings first? Okay. Whelp, so far so good. Some keep speculating that Sean Spicer will be gone tomorrow, some say he'll stay for another four to eight years. I think New Spicey's in this for the long haul! This is God's work he's doing, after all. Don't forget! Also, the rumor that leaked that Trump was thinking of firing Mueller, the former head of the FBI that's now in charge of the investigation into Russia determining the outcome of our presidential election. Now, if you're on Facebook and you're pro-Trump, you're of course thinking to yourself, show me some proof! Well, I would... but you probably wouldn't believe it anyway. Now, usually, when we the Little People who Shouldn't be in Charge of Big People Things, public or private sector, hear that Trump's thinking about doing something... BOOM! Within a couple of days, said Trump Thoughts become World Facts... none spring to mind at the moment. But I'm pretty sure that that's how it goes down in Trumpland and the real world. I mean, it would be a sign of weakness otherwise, right?\n\nBut like the rest of you, I'm waiting to see those Trump tax returns. You know, just to compare them to McCain's tax returns. Trump's got at least eleven homes, right? Unfortunately, those Trump tax returns are under some serious lock and key, and always will be, and there's nothing we can do about it. Trump commands far too much respect amongst our intelligence community employees, the State Department, AND the IRS, which is why those documents will never see the light of day...\n\n...nothing yet? Okay. Well, it must be true! All these high-ranking government employees just love Trump too much! As well as all the hackers in the world, and Trump's fellow business douchebags, because the truth would be far too devastating for the American people to handle. Incidentally, ... ah, skip it. Let's get to the real news of the week. As predicted, the latest installment of the Transformers franchise is #1 this week. Now, maybe I'm crazy, but there were a couple of ads that said that this one is the last \"episode\" or \"chapter\" or installment of the Transformers franchise. On the other hand, this is the age of Trump, and alternative facts. So, I go to Michael Bay's IMDb page and... BOOM!!!! There's an entry here for Transformers 7... apparently, the cinematic experience is so powerful, we're just going to skip right over a sixth installment to get right to lucky seven. Interesting bit of trivia about the latest Transformers movie: both John Goodman and Steve Buscemi were in Barton Fink. However, they didn't have a scene together... which leads me to believe that they were both playing (two halves of) the same character, kinduva Fight Club type deal, if you will.\n\n...and THAT'S IT! The latest Transformers movie is the only debut this week. Oh, and... stay tuned for a Transformers prequel as well. That's right... it's just like \"Better Call Saul,\" except that the entire cast will be selected by both Maxim and Cosmopolitan magazine... or maybe Marie Claire for the ladies? Is Oxygen magazine still around? I don't think they survived. It was for those fitness enthusiasts who thought that Shape magazine wasn't skanky enough. THAT one's still around, that I know for sure.\n\nAnd that's it. So I guess the only question now is, which films are going to turn a profit? Too early to tell for Transformers; it's going to take more than one American weekend to do so, clearly. It doesn't have the populist groundswell of, say, 2008's The Dark Knight. Also too early for Cars 3. But Wonder Woman looks like it's going to make a profit! It's doing so well that Lynda Carter might actually want to appear in one of the upcoming Justice League movies. (Spoiler Alert: she wants to, but they haven't asked her yet. Also, her demands are probably a little unreasonable. I mean, a Costco fruit platter AND Fiji(TM) bottled water? Puh-leeze.) The indie-type hits 47 Meters Down, All Eyez on Me and Rough Night are all profitable. Pirates of the Caribbean 5? I'd start to sweat a little. Tom Cruise's The Mummy? I'd start to sweat a lot. Captain Underpants is probably not profitable yet. They'd like to at least get over 100 million domestically, which might not happen. And finally, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is so profitable, they've already begun work on installments three and four simultaneously. You know, like the Matrix movies, and something before those! They'd get them done faster, but they're still trying to figure out the soundtrack. You know how it is. Damn AMPAS!!!\n\nAuteur Watch - Rod Gailes\n\nWell, it's really time to call me Cynical. I've probably used and abused that opening already. \"You know, call me Cynical, but...\" Time to make it official, because I've got issues with you, the IMDb! All these bios start the same way: \"He or she is a writer and director known for...\" And then, they list three or four titles NO ONE'S EVER HEARD OF. No one's heard of, or they just sound too generic, there's no reviews, there's nothing on YouTube... okay, there's one thing on YouTube. With UNDER 100 VIEWS!!!!!\n\nBut, to be fair, Mr. Gailes has ventured out onto that silver screen. Two features we know of: the first is 2008's Camouflage. Alas, no external reviews, no IMDb user ratings, two of the actors have thumbnail pics... ONE OF WHICH is Rod Gailes. The other feature is called 10 Things I Hate About You... sorry, that's Gil Junger's 1999 updating of the Shakespeare classic The Taming of the Shrew. Don't even get me started on that... okay, first of all, how exactly do you go about taming a rodent? The only instance I know of is the rats that were specially bred for Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade... you know, so they wouldn't bite anyone and give them the F... FRICKIN' PLAGUE!!! And if you do actually tame a shrew, how long can you take that on the road before it just up and dies? Six months? Eleven? What's the risk slash reward we're looking at here? Just stick with a flea circus, because fleas never die. Even if you squish them with a big flat rock... okay, that slows 'em down pretty good, but other than that, fleas are forever. Fleas and diamonds.\n\nIncidentally, there's a \"10 Things I Hate About You\" TV show... dang! Two seasons? Maybe the answer's in there someplace. If your show's about to be cancelled, the shrew will suddenly find a sympathy groom. Kinda move things along, you know. No, Gailes' other feature for the multiplex was 6 Things I Never Told You. Again, no external reviews, no IMDb user ratings... so you could possibly be the first! Sign up today! But more importantly, there's SIX directors! Six short stories, six directors. A modern, HD update of Aria, let's say. Sometimes you just gota... gotta go with what you're good at. If one feature film takes the wind out of your sails, just stick with the shorts. Don't get fed up with the industry entire and flat out walk away! ...although you might as well, if you're just doing shorts.\n\nBox Office 6-18-17\n\nWhile we're still waiting for the IMDb's Top 10 numbers to come out, I forgot to take a moment to reflect on the passing of Roger Moore. He was a controversial figure, to be sure... some say that Sean Connery's their all-time favourite James Bond, some say George Lazenby. I say Peter Sellers in the ORIGINAL Casino Royale. But if you count them all up, one does have to admit that Moore appeared in the most Bond films. I mean, that's just math. Great, provocative titles like The Spy Who Loved Me, Live and Let Die and The Cannonball Run.\n\nAs for our current president, well... I hate to seem like a partisan, but we did just watch Robert Redford's documentary about the 40th Anniversary of All the President's Men. Spoiler alert: Dustin Hoffman actually showed up for it! Of course, Redford tricked him and made him think he was doing an appearance for the 30th Anniversary of Ishtar. Anyway, the BIG question is: how is this president different from all other presidents named Nixon? Welp, for one thing, Nixon actually said in his final address to the nation that all this Watergate nonsense has gotten so bad... HOW BAD IS IT?... it's so bad that he won't be able to get his legislative agenda done for the nation. Therefore he will resign before getting impeached, then get the next guy to grant him a full pardon... something like that. A full pardon for all crimes past and future, for all perpetuity, as long as men and women live and breathe, throughout the known universe and far, far beyond. Trump has no such agenda for the American people, so he thinks he'll stay! He'll stay until Putin cuts him that big check. Trump doesn't need it, of course... but it is a pretty big check. It's like how the Kardashians say \"Oh, it's not about the money.\" On the other hand... it is.\n\n...okay, looks like the numbers just come in. As expected, the latest Pixar juggernaut is #1. This time, it's Cars 3. And this time, the girl cars are flashing more than just those little lights! Ooh baby. As UN-expected, however, was the low take that first week. All involved were honestly expecting much more than 53 million dollars, really. Well, thank God those more grateful international markets have opened up for cinema, like Saipan and the Southern Langue d'oc part of France... oh, they're actually working on an Incredibles sequel? You'd think they'd want to get on that much sooner! Well, you know that Brad Bird. Ever the artisan, has to wait until the script is just right. So Goldilocks. (TM) If I were more on top of my game, I actually would copyright and trademark that... ah, what's the point. I'll never get the Hipsters to do my bidding. But you'll probably hear that at some point. \"So I was faced with the ultimate dilemma: bacon-chocolate combo, or just bacon? I was very Goldilocks about it. Too much or just right?\"\n\nOur second deubt... debut this week comes in at #3 and it's about Tupac Shakur, called All Eyez on Me. Directed by Bernard Boom. And to the tune of 27 million or so, that's hard to argue! A lotta butts in the multiplex seats, a lotta eyes on this guy! So, here's my two thoughts. One, it's clearly an incomplete telling of Tupac's story because no one's showing Dan Aykroyd's part in all this. Also, Dan wanted to play himself in the movie, and he was like Colin Quinn with Crocodile Dundee 2. He came in with his own script, wanted to direct, wanted to give brother Peter a prominent role. Clearly, at some point, the film's producers told the Aykroyds to, and I quote, \"Get the hell outta here, you're nothing but trouble.\" And second, I'll be the first to admit that I'm no student of Tupac's work. I don't have the whole Tupac zeitgeist in my brain yet, and I am white, so I still to this day get my small share of white privilege. I could get more if I played golf and went to church with the right people, but I made all the wrong choices in this life, and continue to do so to this day. But I did come across the lyrics to a song Tupac co-wrote with... someone. It's called \"Me Against the World.\" And the chorus goes something like this: \"It's just me against the world, baby. I've got nothin' to lose.\" Now, maybe I'm just cynical and or jealous... jeal-ical? Cynic-ous? Anyway, I read that and couldn't help but think to myself, well... you've got ONE thing to lose! I think Chris Rock also had some thoughts on that.\n\nWe're halfway there! The third debut this week is called 47 Meters Down. Um, Jaws called...\n\nAnd the last debut this week... you know, when you reach a certain level in showbiz when you're a comedian, there comes a time when you start to pay it forward. Amy Schumer's already done that with Rachel Feinstein and Mark Normand, as the Google SmartSearch informs me. Kevin Hart is also mentoring some comedians. Well, Amy Poehler's \"Broad City\" thespians have their own movie this weekend! It's kinda like Bridesmaids or that one with Judd Apatow's wife and Rebel Wilson... How to Be Single, that's the one. When I was growing up, we had films like Crimes of the Heart and The Linguini Incident. But this is 2017 and movie studios have to push that R rating to its absolute breaking point, so we get a movie like Rough Night... ooh! It's basically an episode of \"Girls\"... something like that. Oh, I'm totally down with the here and now. And yet, it feels like the cast of \"Girls\" AND of Rough Night seriously need to be broken up by a revamped version of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Maybe it needs a new name! After all, trust is an important part of any relationship; maybe it should be called the Anti-Corporate Greed Act. And speaking of corporate greed, the Wall Street Journal, in between its campaign of softening Trump headlines, mentioned that Amazon is about to gobble up the Whole Foods market chain. Alas, it probably means I still have to drive to Seattle to get my daily order of cheese mashed potatoes... where was I? Oh, right. Because this project is tangentially connected to Lorne Michaels, I won't badmouth it too much. Probably gotta run!! ...damn, just thought of something. They had an old episode of SCTV on DVD where they said \"And now, our musical guest, Rough Trade!\" ...egg-zactly. I never heard of them either.\n\nAuteur Watch - Antoine Fuqua\n\nMy God! Someone I've heard of! And not just because he was in a documentary about GoodFellas, talking about its influence. (Spoiler alert: very influential)\n\nBut it wasn't always near the top of the A-list for this guy. He had to claw his way to the top, doing some things he might later regret. And not just Training Day or Bait. Doug Hutchison, STOP CALLING!!! A video of your wedding night is NOT an A-list project, okay? Make it yourself and put it on YouTube like everyone else. No, Fuqua had to cut his teeth on something called \"Inside Out,\" along with Alexander Payne and... others, I'm sure. I thought Bernard Rose was already established by that time! Go figure. Well, it was just that strong a project, apparently.\n\nThen of course there's the music videos. David Fincher did them. Adam Bernstein did 'em, Anton Corbijn's done way way too many of 'em. I hate to tell the IMDb what to do... I know, not really, right? But here goes anyway. In the future, for directors, how about a new section? Take Anton Corbijn's page for example. You've got about all the categories that one person can have: Self, Thanks, Producer, Cinematographer, Visual Effects, Self... and of course, Director. Well, in Anton's case, those darned old pesky silver screen releases seem to be buried amongst a bunch of shorts. How about a new category called \"Director - Shorts\" or \"Director - Music Videos\"? Some would argue that they should be separate, and not just me. Also, I seem to have found a web page or two that point to nothing. How about getting on top of those as well? If it were MY web site, I'd be taking hella flack for that. Hella.\n\nSo I guess we should go by decade on this one. So, which do you think is Fuqua's favourite decade? Would it be the go-go '90s that we're currently nostalgizing? Dee-Lite and The Spitfire Grill? The rise of the indie and the fall of Rob Reiner? I mean, seriously, the guy lost his touch after... The Princess Bride or something. Does Fuqua miss the hard work and the obscurity? Or is it the 2000s, when Training Day vaulted him squarely into the A-list? Had some trouble staying there, though. Alas, his revisionist King Arthur wasn't terribly profitable, and he had to work with Mark Wahlberg once or twice.\n\nOr maybe it's the 2010s? A chance to make a move into documentaries... you know, along with Scorsese and Spielberg, plus bringing that Ken Burns-type touch to your work. Of course, the industry's changing so much. Doing something for Amazon and or Netflix is now on everyone's to-do list. Maybe producing's a little more fun. He's got a \"Training Day\" series now and something called \"Ice.\" Hey Ronald Bass, Blood Diamond called... wants its plot back. But here's the question I want answered. Fuqua directed a music video for Prince called \"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World.\" Who did Prince find to play the part? I'm sure he had a say in it. He ain't messing with no Uggo's, especially not in the afterlife now. Well, the internet is nothing if not an engine to answer such questions. And the IMDb says... inconclusive?! Ladies and gentlemen, this is the biggest failure since Al Capone's Vault. Probably more so. Are you telling me that Prince is going to let us mere Mortals use our imagination when it comes to picturing the most beautiful girl in the world? Well, thankfully, that's where YouTube comes in. Turns out it's kind of like how they casted the girl parts... roles for that George Michael video, \"I Want Your Sex.\" Get a couple Asians with nice glutes, get a Playboy photographer and a bed with a nice sheet with good folds in it and call it a day. Ah, directing. The best job in the world.\n\nTrexit\n\nBooyah-k'sha! As you probably know from the attached pic, that is Ali G. appearing with a certain well-known businessman with a red tie... oops! Cut off his head by accident. Seems like I'm always doing that with photos. Harder to get away with these days in the digital age. Wonder how often that comes up? A guy asks you to take a picture of him and his whole douche-y family, then he looks at it on the screen of the camera and or phone and says \"...okay, now you see how the picture's all fuzzy? It's out of focus! TAKE ANOTHER ONE!\"\n\n...where was I? Oh yeah. Just a few political brain farts before we dive into the numbers. As you know, Britain's current PM Theresa May had a special election a few years earlier. Apparently, she misunderestimated her party's popularity, and wanted to increase her seat majority. The plan totally backfired. And Republicans in this country don't have the opportunity to say \"See that? Look around this world of yours, Liberals, and witness the march of conservatism around the world. WE shall overcome this time!\" Not a peep. The Pussy-Grabber, World's Worst Landlord in Chief called it \"surprising.\" As for Comey's testimony, well, it finally happened and wasn't sabotaged like I thought it would be, with Steve Bannen streaking through the room, screaming \"THERE'S A BOMB!!! THERE'S A BOMB!!!! EVERYBODY OUT!!!\" I kinda wanted to read Kayleigh Mack-a-ninny's tweet about how she loves it when this kind of thing pisses off liberals. Yeah but...\n\nOkay, enough of the real world. How's the box office this week? Well, whatever adventure Wonder Woman is on in the movies, it hits the #1 spot yet again. No one thought it could happen twice... something like that. Insert your own lewd joke here. But the movies for the guys aren't far behind, so don't worry. At #2, it's the #1 Tom Cruise movie this week, and it's called The Mummy. However, judging from the ads, it's not your grandfather's mummy. They keep showing this chick with two eyes! I mean, she has eyes with two pupils. Guh-ross. You know, baby, when I look into your eye, I see two limpid pools of blue. How messed up is that? I hate to say it... I know, not really, right? Just a manner of speech, suh! But this new mummy comes from a long tradition of movie villains, dating all the way back to Suicide Squad. I'm assuming that's it, because this new mummy seemed an awful lot like that... that... one character in S.Squ. You might know the one I'm talking about! The role played by that girl? Who was in that thing? I think it was June Moone slash Enchantress. The one character that's 7,000 years old, able to break into Iran's CIA equivalent in a single bound and steal their most sensitive documents, that kind of thing.\n\nMeanwhile, in more mortal-type news, one of the reviews was ragging on how 54-year old Tom Cruise is playing the same old role he once played in movies like Cocktail and Top Gun. I try to look on the positive side of things and say, hey! Can't blame a guy for trying! Cary Grant hung in there for as long as he could! Let's say Charade was his last chance at wooing a younger gal. And Audrey Hepburn was only 25 years younger! Oh, there's all kinda historical precedent and sh... stuff. I'm sure Tom Cruise is way more buff, of course. As for the people behind the camera, well, we've got Cruise's latest collaborators. There's Christopher McQuarrie of The Usual Suspects fame, and you've got several members of the J. J. Abrams camp. Why, this might even be a Bad Robot co-production! ...nope. My dreams deffered again.\n\nMeanwhile, in low-budge horror film news, something called It Comes at Night debuts at #6. Which probably won't slow Joel Edgerton down any time soon; he's still on his way to either an Oscar(TM)(R) or playing the lead in that much awaited Conan O'Brien biopic. But what about the rest of the cast and crew? How are they supposed to go in with their agent to the big movie studio and negotiate a proper deal, and say that they were in that new hit movie? \"It debuted at #6!\" Ned Tanen's relative will say, dryly, looking over their glasses at you. How do you spin that into gold?\n\nAnd our last debut this week is a story of a Marine and her dog called Megan Leavey. You might have seen ads for it on the IMDb, for one. Those ads seem to have dried up now... now that it's bombing. Well, you know how it is. Us Americans, you know, we support our troops... just not always at the box office.\n\nOkay, one last brain fart about President Pussy-Grabber MacDouchebag. He pulled America out of the Paris Climate Agreement... insert filthy joke here... and he justified it by saying, among other terribly newsworthy things, \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" Three thoughts about this. First of all, I would be remiss as an unrepentant movie buff to offer my improvement. I mean, he could have said \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Paris, Texas... not Paris, France.\" Much more clever. Then, of course, being Trump, he'd have to add \"And what's the deal with French women not shaving their armpits? How gross is that? It's like they've got extra vaginas under their arms. So disgusting. So disgusting, folks.\" Second thought: Pittsburgh is actually with Paris. And third, I couldn't help but think to myself... then go to Wikipedia to confirm it... what's the population of Pittsburgh? The city proper's about 300,000, the whole metropolitan area about 2.3 million. So Trump represents about 2.3 million Americans, therefore. But isn't the whole country about 300 million? What about the other 297.7 million Americans, Mr. President? Don't you represent them, too?\n\nThis brain fart was brought to you by BranePhart. BranePhart! Also available in chocolate. Also, get ready, America, because come February 15th, 2018, \"BranePhart: Mall Cop Part 3\" will be hitting theaters in IMAX and... regular theaters. Whatever the non-IMAX ones are called."
