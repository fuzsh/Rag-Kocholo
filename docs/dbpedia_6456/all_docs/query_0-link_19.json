        "text": "The First Performances\n\nBartholomew Fair is the most ‘occasional’ of Jonson’s plays, in the sense that it incorporates the unusual occasions of its first performances into the work itself and its meaning. In fact, only two performances are recorded from Jonson’s lifetime, but they were the first, and there are few stagings by the professional theatre of the period that remain so accessible to us. The play was first performed by the Lady Elizabeth’s Men at the Hope Theatre, Bankside, London, on 31 October 1614, and the next night it was repeated for the court in Whitehall, in the presence of King James. Both occasions are incorporated into the printed text: the Induction dates and places the first; the court performance is present in direct addresses to the King and in numerous glances at him and his concerns. This second performance is confirmed by the records of the royal Treasurer of the Chamber, which show that the performers were paid the standard fee of £10 on 11 June 1615 ‘for presenting a play called Bartholomew Fair before His Majesty on the first of November last past’ ( Malone Society Collections, 6.60).\n\nMuch that is known about these occasions makes them exceptional — not least that the court performance followed immediately upon the opening in a public theatre. No other new play is known to have transferred at once in this way (Blissett, 1974, 81-2). Plays were normally proved in public before being vetted by the Lord Chamberlain for performance at court — indeed, the players themselves would normally be cautious about risking an untried play before their most important audience. (Later, in the 1630s, a few plays by more amateur dramatists would be performed first at court before entering the professional repertory: see Edwards, 1981, 112.) It says much for Jonson’s stature at this time that an untried play was engaged for the King’s entertainment. Since ‘a good deal of time was spent in the discovery and preparation of suitable pieces’ (Chambers, ES, 1.223), Bartholomew Fair must have been chosen well in advance, presumably before rehearsals began (Sturgess, 1987, 170). Moreover, the Revels Office had elaborate scenery to build for the performance (as shown below). So Jonson would have had time in hand and a dual occasion in mind while finalising the text, a duality retained in the lengthy induction for the Hope and in the repeated evocation of the King within the text, an evocation that would be clinched by the unprecedented dedication of a commercial play to him (title page, 8n.), a dedication all the more emphasized by appearing on the title-page, unlike those in F1 (Marcus in Smith et al, 1995, 170). Although Jonson’s early career as a dramatist had been stormy, his standing at court now seems assured.\n\nThe special sense of occasion begins with the dates of these performances, since Bartholomew Fair was written not only about but also for a festivity. Where most traditional holy-days and holidays fell in the half-year between the winter and summer solstices of 24 December and 24 June, the play takes advantage of two major intervals of release during the more laborious half of the year: St Bartholomew’s Day, 24 August, and Hallowtide. Halloween, 31 October, was traditionally the most weird and uncanny night of the year, and from the most ancient times it had been the night when the dead were supposed to return to their old haunts and companions, while witches and other dark powers were at their zenith. Despite such macabre associations, the festival had long been celebrated with merriment and feasting. In Jonson’s society, it was largely a time of pranks and practical jokes (known as Mischief Night in some parts of the country), with the stores of summer opened for feasting, with cheerful and noisy games, and with simple rites of divination played with facetious semi-belief. A play that the Scrivener presents as ‘merry and as full of noise as sport’ (Ind., 61-2) is in keeping with this.\n\nVarious ancient festivals associated with the waning power of the sun coincided on 1 November — notably the Celtic Samhain commemorating the end of summer and the death of the saviour god — and these became absorbed into the Christian celebrations of the saints and faithful in heaven on All Saints’ Day and the following All Souls’ Day, 2 November. In keeping with this, the winter season at court began on All Saints’ Day — it was the day when Lords of Misrule took up the office they would hold until Candlemas Day, 2 February — and King James had restored the old custom of marking the onset of this season with a major court celebration at Whitehall. Plays were often performed then, but it remains altogether exceptional to have marked such an important festive occasion with an untried commercial play.\n\nThe sense that this is a play for a special occasion is borne out by both the length of the text and the size of the cast. The induction’s statement that the audience is to pay patient attention ‘for the space of two hours and an half and somewhat more’ (59-60) indicates not an exact duration but that the play is going to be long. Public theatre performances began at 2 pm and were limited by the stamina of the groundlings and the early onset of darkness in winter. It is estimated that, in unbroken speech, contemporary actors averaged some 160-70 words or about twenty lines of verse a minute. With the average length of a play of the period about 2,250 lines, it follows that plays were normally performed ‘richly in two short hours’ (H8, Prol., 13), although the complete entertainment would usually be filled out to approaching three hours by music, intervals, or a final jig. When the citizens of Blackfriars raised a petition against the theatre in 1619 they grumbled that their streets were blocked by people and coaches ‘from one or two of the clock till six at night’ (Malone Society Collections, 1.1.92), and much of the last hour must have gone on the traffic jam of departing pedestrians, coaches, and hackneys. However, many plays by Shakespeare and all those by Jonson up to 1616 — though very few by the less esteemed playwrights — have texts well over 3,000 lines long, and so must have been cut for performance. This practice is explicit in, for example, the authors’ prefaces to Every Man Out of His Humour and Webster’s The Duchess of Malfi, and the publisher’s preface to the 1647 folio collection of Beaumont and Fletcher (Rasmussen, 1997, 442). The full text of Bartholomew Fair is an extreme case, and it is almost twice as long as the average play of the period. It is significantly longer than any Shakespeare play, including the second Hamlet Quarto, and well beyond even Jonson’s average. Assuming delivery at 165 words a minute, a full run-through even at that brisk contemporary speed would take very little less than four hours in the Hope Theatre text, and a few minutes less in the court version. And that is allowing nothing for laughter, for significant pauses, for the slower pace of the musical settings, and especially for the intervals built into its structure, which were then customary in the professional theatre and essential at court, where the candles required regular trimming (see 2.1.0 Longer Notes). As I argue in the Textual Introduction, printer’s copy for F2 was Jonson’s ‘foul papers’ or an uncritical copy of them; it is not a text revised, cleaned up, and slimmed down for the theatre. Like Shakespeare’s major work, Jonson’s plays, being too long for the stage, claim a literary as well as theatrical existence. It follows from the induction that Jonson was anticipating substantial cuts in the performed text, but at the same time, the induction’s adding of about one-third to the standard performance length indicates that he sees his play as meriting as much time as could be expected when, on 31 October, the sun sets before 5.00 pm, while the court performance would not begin until as late as about 10.00 pm. (See Hart, 1932b, Gurr, 1996b, Erne, 2003.)\n\nAs for the ‘Persons’, with its thirty-six named characters Bartholomew Fair requires an exceptionally, although not uniquely, large cast for its time, even after allowing for doubling. There are twenty speaking characters on stage together in the last scene, presumably plus puppeteers (at least two of whom have just been in action) and some supernumeraries. When George Devine was preparing his 1950 production for the Old Vic at Edinburgh, he sketched stage positions for thirty-eight actors in this scene (Teague, 1985, 120). Of the speakers here, eighteen are major characters on stage in at least several scenes — all the major characters, in fact, except Trash and Mooncalf, who do not appear after Act 3. Since Troubleall does not appear until Act 4, it is likely that he was doubled with one of this pair, probably Mooncalf. At least nineteen actors are therefore required for the significant speaking parts. Some of these can double small parts who appear in only one or two scenes, but they cannot double the three named Watchmen, who have repeated appearances though they speak little; — Poacher, for example, has only one speech but coincides on stage with all the major characters. So a minimum of twenty-two actors is required for the speaking roles. In addition, so many boys, passers-by, porters, puppeteers, and unnamed watchmen are needed as mutes that it would be difficult for actors in substantial roles to double all of them, and the total cast in 1614 probably approached thirty, whereas Shakespeare normally wrote for a cast of twelve men and four boys. Jonson may well have been responding here to the merger in 1613 of Lady Elizabeth’s and the Children of the Queen’s Revels (also known as the Children of the Chapel and the Blackfriars Boys), and this suggests why there are so many parts suitable for boys. Seven boys are named alongside seven men in the patent for the company, dated 31 May 1613, that was produced when they visited Coventry early in 1615 (Ingram, 1981, 394). In Bartholomew Fair, boys are likely to have played the seven named female parts (though Ursula, who has at times been acted by a man since at least the early eighteenth century, may well have been played by an adult), plus Cokes the gangling youth, Mooncalf the ‘pretty stripling’ (2.2.111), Wasp the ‘little old fellow’ (1.3.88), and the boys playing around in the fair (4.2.8, 5.3.0). Jonson is clearly writing with this company in mind, because his text is more prescriptive about the physical appearance of the characters than any other play of the period, as well as their dress and the props they handle (Sturgess, 1987, 178ff.).\n\nIt is striking that Jonson should have tailored this major play to a new troupe, especially as all his plays since 1603 except Epicene had been written for Shakespeare’s company, the King’s Men. It is likely that he was happy to collaborate with its leading actor, Nathan Field, a protégé of his who is praised at 5.3.67 and who had acted in his plays for boys’ companies, Cynthia’s Revels, Poetaster, and Epicene. Bartholomew Fair was to prove the high point of the company’s existence, even though the previous year it had introduced Middleton’s A Chaste Maid in Cheapside. Under James I, patronage of the London companies was confined to members of the royal family, so that approval for naming the company after Elizabeth (1596-1662) — the King’s daughter, who married the Elector Palatine, Frederick V, in 1613 and through him was to become Queen of Bohemia in 1619 — must have come from the court. She was made its patron by royal warrant on 27 April 1611. Despite this royal sanction, the company’s history was to prove insecure, partly because at first there were not enough theatres in London to accommodate the six companies then officially tolerated, and partly because its most creative years, 1613-16, coincided with a chaotic period when (according to the aggrieved actors) its manager — the entrepreneur Philip Henslowe, who was manoeuvring himself into unprecedented power over the actors — broke, dismembered, and re-formed five companies in order to further his profits and his power. It was Henslowe who in 1613 had merged the company with the Queen’s Revels. The new company had recently become established at its own theatre, the Hope, but it was never to be out of difficulties. In February 1615 there was a breach between Henslowe and the company, and the actors drew up a list of grievances alleging fraud and other misconduct by their manager over the previous three years. They claimed he had kept them in debt in order to keep them in his power. After this, from the spring of 1615 at least until Henslowe’s death in January 1616, they joined forces with Prince Charles’s Men, though for collaboration rather than amalgamation. Eight leading players, including the stars Nathan Field, Joseph Taylor, and Robert Benfield, left the company at this period. From 1616 to 1622 a Lady Elizabeth’s company was mainly or entirely a provincial troupe, though a company of that name flourished in the capital from 1622 until almost all companies were reorganised in 1625-6, when severe plague coincided with the succession of Charles I. (See Chambers, ES, 2.466-7; Bentley, JCS, 1.176-97; and Beckerman, 1971.)\n\nBartholomew Fair is the only play known to have been performed at the company’s Hope Theatre, the newest playhouse in London. Because of this, and because of the eminence of the playwright and the unusual demands of the play, it has often been assumed that it was written as a festive opening for the theatre (e.g. M. C. Bradbrook, 1976, 97). It is clear, however, that plays were already being performed there, because a few weeks earlier, on 7 October, John Taylor the ‘water poet’ and William Fennor, a hack writer and pamphleteer, had agreed to an improvised trial of wit on the stage of the Hope. Fennor defaulted, and Taylor, failing to entertain the angry audience alone, had to be rescued by Lady Elizabeth’s Men, who placated the audience by putting on a performance (5.3.61-2n.).\n\nThe Hope, which straddled the modern Bear Gardens in Southwark, a short distance to the northwest of Shakespeare’s Globe, was both conservative and innovative as an undertaking. It was the last ‘public’ theatre — a wooden amphitheatre open to the skies — to be built at that period, when the indoor ‘private’ theatres had become more fashionable (even though at the same time the Globe was being magnificently rebuilt after a disastrous fire on 29 June 1613, and the Fortune was to be re-built in 1621 after another fire). The Hope was innovative, however, in being designed specifically for both plays and bear-baiting (although older structures such as Paris Garden had been adapted for both entertainments.) (The older view that theatres developed out of baiting rings is rejected by Brownstein, 1979, and Orrell, 1988, 14-20.)\n\nMore is known about the Hope as a building than any other London theatre of the day, because the contract for its construction survives. On 29 August 1613, Henslowe and Jacob Meade, the leading impresario of bull- and bear-baiting, commissioned Gilbert Katherens, a carpenter, to pull down the old Beargarden and ancillary buildings and erect the Hope and new ancillary buildings on an overlapping site. Although the new theatre was due to be ready by the end of November, work was still underway as late as spring, 1614 — it is not known why it took so long (Chambers, ES, 2.370). Katherens was, says the contract, to build ‘one other game place or playhouse fit and convenient in all things, both for players to play in, and for the game of bears and bulls to be baited in the same, and also a fit and convenient tire-house and a stage to be carried or taken away, and to stand upon trestles good, substantial, and sufficient for the carrying and bearing of such a stage’. Inventive carpentry was demanded of Katherens: the closing phrases just cited are ambiguous, but it seems likely that not only the stage but also the tiring-house (which in the public theatres usually stood within the outer ‘wooden O’: see Orrell, 1988, 67-9) had to be readily dismantled. Moreover, he was ‘to build the heavens [protective canopy] all over the said stage, to be borne and carried without any posts or supporters to be fixed or set upon the said stage, and all gutters of lead needful for the carriage of all such rainwater as shall fall upon the same’ (Chambers, 2.466-7, as corrected by Wickham, 1959-2002, 2.72). He must have cantilevered the canopy from the outer frame of the building.\n\nIn other respects the Hope was to be based upon the existing Swan Theatre — ‘to be made in all things and in such form and fashion as the said playhouse called the Swan’ — with a brick foundation for the wooden structure, seating on three storeys and two external staircases to the upper levels, ‘two boxes in the lowermost storey fit and decent for gentlemen to sit in’, ‘turned columns upon and over the stage’, ‘good and sufficient oaken timber’ and no mere fir for the major and visible woodwork, and (no doubt in view of the fire at the Globe) an expensive roof of new English tiles rather than cheaper and lighter thatch. The carpenter was to be paid £360, which seems small besides the £1,400 supposedly being spent at the same time on the second Globe, but that sum has been thought implausibly high, while Katherens’s costs were kept low by using timber from the old Beargarden or supplied free by Henslowe.\n\nThe general appearance of the auditorium can be inferred from the famous sketch of the interior of the Swan made about 1596 by Johannes de Witt, copied by his friend Aernout van Buchel (Foakes, 1985, 52). This shows a rectangular trestle-stage thrusting into the circular arena for the groundlings, with two large double-hung doors as stage entrances from the façade of the tiring-house, and with a gallery above for the more select spectators or for music and upper-stage action, the whole being surmounted by a hut-like structure. (No ‘discovery space’ is shown, nor an arras which might be concealing one, and although such a space is required at the opening of Middleton’s A Chaste Maid in Cheapside — the only play known to have been designed for performance at this theatre — the door-openings appear large enough for one to have served in this way. Indeed, the headnote to Chaste Maid, 5.4, ‘Enter at one door . . . At the other door . . .’, confirms the accuracy of de Witt’s sketch.) It is probable, then, that the Hope also had only two stage doors, and, despite its complexity, Bartholomew Fair can indeed be played with only two doors; it makes much less play with entrances than Jonson’s three previous comedies. (Waith, ed. Bart. Fair, 207, is incorrect in claiming that 4.6 requires three stage entrances.) Contrary to the Swan sketch, however, there was obviously an arras on the tiring-house wall of the Hope (Ind., 7n.).\n\nIn the sketch, the stage and tiring house stand at one side of a ‘wooden O’ — or else a polygon of twenty-four or so many sides as to appear circular — an outer circle on three levels for the seated spectators. (For a detailed account, see Hosley, 1975.) The Hope, lacking any pillars to support the heavens, would have presented an uncluttered stage, while the heavens, being ‘all over the said stage’, would have been higher and much larger than they appear in the sketch.\n\nThis suggests also why the hut or gabled structure found above the heavens and tiring-house in the sketch of the Swan and other contemporary representations of other theatres is absent from those of the Hope. The outer appearance of the theatre is known from various sketches and engravings, most familiarly in Wenceslaus Hollar’s ‘Long View’ of London from Southwark (1647) (Foakes, 1985, 36), where it is identified as the ‘bear baiting h[ouse]’ (though the name is exchanged in error with that of the nearby Globe). An external staircase is visible in almost identical positions on both these neighbouring playhouses, but the nearest equivalent to the twin-gabled structure that dominates the inner circle of the Globe is a large peak at the matching southwest side of the Hope’s outer circle. The placing of these structures suggests that in both theatres the tiring-house stood to the southwest of the inner building, protecting actors and the highest-paying spectators from the evening sun and the stage from rain brought by the prevailing wind. It has been reliably calculated that the Hope was almost exactly 100 feet in diameter and 32 feet high, while the stage offered a very large acting area, some 43 feet wide and 27 feet 6 inches in depth (Orrell, 1983, 101-5, and 1988, 63-4).\n\nIn the event, however, the Henslowe/Meade initiative at the Hope was a limited success. Tensions created by the dual purpose of the building are already evident in Jonson’s Induction, with its scornful references to the bears and the stink they created. A conflict of interest was soon apparent, and no acting company would stay long at the theatre. As mentioned above, early in 1615 the actors of Lady Elizabeth’s Men drew up a list of complaints against Henslowe, whose attempts to assume an innovative role as manager of the company rather than continue as financial backer and theatre-landlord appeared high-handed (Beckerman, 1971). Their ‘Articles of Grievance and Oppression’, a compendium of all they could find to say against him, accuse him of financial mismanagement and autocratic dealings, such as rewarding the company inadequately for the days given over to baiting. It was this crisis that apparently brought an end to Lady Elizabeth’s as a London company. Until its destruction in 1656, the Hope was indeed the ‘bear baiting house’ and was used far more for bear-baiting and similar exhibitions than for plays.\n\nFor the second performance of Bartholomew Fair, the company was at a place no longer ‘as dirty as Smithfield, and as stinking every whit’ (Ind., 119-20), although it is not explicit just where the court performance was held. There were several sites for royal theatrical entertainments at this time, four of them in Whitehall Palace alone: the Great Chamber, the Great Hall, the Cockpit, and the Banqueting House. It is very likely that the play was performed in the last of these, the largest and grandest, even though this is contrary to what is implied in the Declared Accounts of the Office of Works for the period from 1 October 1614 until 30 September 1615, where there is the entry: ‘Diverse works and reparations in making ready the Great Chamber for plays, the Banqueting House for a masque, and the Hall for revels and shows’ ( Malone Society Collections, 10.26, see Sturgess, 1987, 174). This is contradicted by a more specific entry under the 1614-15 season in ‘Chamber Accounts: Apparellings’ (which record the preparation of royal dwellings for use by the sovereign or royal consort), where one John Heborne and the maximum number of ten assistants were paid for eight days’ work in September-November 1614 for making ready the Banqueting House ‘for plays’, and it is most unlikely that Bartholomew Fair was not one of these (Malone Society Collections, 6.111), since the only other rooms recorded as being prepared that autumn were at the Queen’s court, Somerset House. Work there did not begin until November, while preparations for Bartholomew Fair must have been made in October.\n\nThe Banqueting House was a fitting place for a play that would be dedicated to the King, since it was a sumptuous hall built at his initiative, and he took pride in it. An elaborate banqueting house of wood and canvas built for Queen Elizabeth in 1581 had survived for twenty-five years, but James disliked it, and in 1607, according to Stow, ‘the King pulled down the old, rotten, slight-builded Banqueting House at Whitehall, and new builded the same this year very strong and stately, being every way larger than the first’ (Annals, 1631, cited Bentley, JCS, 6.255). After the opening, James boasted to the Venetian ambassador that his predecessors had left him a building of wood ‘which he had converted into stone’ ( CSPV, 1607-10 , 86), though in fact it was largely built of brick. It was a substantial rectangular room, 120’ by 53’, on the site of the present Banqueting House in Whitehall; there was space for a large stage and audience. In the course of his detailed report on the performance of Pleasure Reconciled to Virtue on 6 January 1618, Orazio Busino, Almoner to the Venetian Embassy, was impressed by how many the hall could accommodate: 'For although they profess only to admit the favoured ones who are invited, yet every box was filled notably with most noble and richly arrayed ladies, in number some 600 and more according to the general estimate.' The ground plan of the hall is recorded by the architect John Smythson in a sketch of c. 1618 (reproduced Orgel & Strong, 1.81), although there were ten pillars along each of the east and west sides rather than the nine in the sketch ( Malone Society Collections, 10.xvi-xix). These pillars, and two more across the north end, supported galleries on those three sides, and, though made of wood on plinths and bases of stone, were painted to resemble marble. Less ornate pillars went from the galleries to the intricate plaster ceiling. Overall there was a great deal of carving and gilding to aid the display of royal magnificence, for this was the King’s audience-chamber and place of state and judgment. Forty-six double-casement windows ensured that daytime audiences were well illuminated. Busino gives this account of it:\n\nWhilst waiting for the King we amused ourselves by admiring the decorations and beauty of the house with its two orders of columns, one above the other, their distance from the wall equalling the breadth of the passage, that of the second row being upheld by Doric pillars, while above these rise Ionic columns supporting the roof. The whole [of the interior] is of wood, including even the shafts, which are carved and gilt with much skill. From the roof of these hang festoons and angels in relief with two rows of lights.\n\n(Bentley, JCS, 6.257)\n\nThe first entertainment in the new hall seems to have been Jonson’s The Masque of Beauty on 10 January 1608, and some ten of Jonson’s masques were to be performed there. From 1610, plays were also performed there. The hall was, however, burned down on 12 January 1619, and was replaced by Inigo Jones’s masterpiece, the surviving Banqueting House.\n\nTurning now to the performances themselves, Jonson is unusually specific and detailed in his requirements. As mentioned above, he wrote the play with a particular troupe in mind: the actors of Cokes, Wasp, Ursula, and Mooncalf require distinctive physiques, with Wasp and Cokes anticipating other ‘odd couples’ such as Laurel and Hardy. Clothing is specified with precision: Mistress Overdo’s French hood and Mistress Purecraft’s strait stomacher, Leatherhead’s velvet jerkins, Win’s fashionable hat and shoes, etc. Throughout, clothes are social signifiers. Moreover, Jonson sought to create a dense social milieu and a recognizable image of the Fair. Bartholomew Fair ‘probably requires more props than any other contemporary play’ (Sturgess, 1987, 180), not only items significant in the plot such as the black box and assorted papers, but also all the paraphernalia of the Fair: Leatherhead’s trinkets, Trash’s gingerbread men, Ursula’s pig pan, firebrand, tobacco, and bottles of ale, Nightingale’s ballads, the Costermonger’s pears, Cokes’s purchases, and all the rest. In addition, besides various props of moderate size, such as Trash’s basket, there are four substantial items: (1) Lantern Leatherhead’s stand; (2) Ursula’s booth, with its chairs and benches; (3) the stocks; (4) Leatherhead’s puppet-theatre. Accordingly, the 1614-15 accounts of Master of the Revels (who was responsible for scenery, costumes, and stage hangings at court plays) include the entry: ‘Canvas for the booths and other necessaries for a play called Bartholomew Fair, forty-one shillings sixpence’ (Streitberger, 1986, 70).\n\nThe structure of the Banqueting House means that these properties must there have been free-standing, and it will have been the same at the Hope, since the text refers to actors being at the ‘backside’ of Ursula’s booth before walking round to the front (4.3.104). Leatherhead’s stand is never called a booth but consistently referred to as a shop (e.g. 2.2.4; 3.4.65, 112-5; 3.6.65), a term used only once elsewhere (of Joan Trash’s basket, 3.4.77 SD). This implies he has something less than a full-scale booth: he appears to have a stall for display rather than a booth that could be entered. It must have been substantial compared to Trash’s basket, since he charges Cokes six times as much as she does for his wares and his rent, 30s as opposed to 5s (3.4.117-21). On the other hand, it must have been transportable, like her basket, because Cokes wants to buy ‘thy whole shop, case and all’ (3.4.115-16), and Leatherhead is able to ‘pack up all, and be gone’ (3.6.16) in a trice at the end of the act. It is likely he was a ‘barrow-boy’ with a small cart as a stall, and simply trundled it away (as in the Royal Shakespeare Company production of 1969). Alternatively, he may have been given the comic display of packing his goods away into the ‘case’ with deft skill.\n\nUrsula’s booth must have been much more substantial, since groups of characters go into it or emerge from it; at 4.4 as many as seven revellers are discovered within and are joined by two others. The booth must also have had two sections, with guests welcomed at the front and cooking and other services supposedly active within. The rear section would also have been an apt place to hide the stolen cloaks in 4.4. There is no reason to doubt that it was fundamentally the standard kind of booth as summarized by Gabriel Egan:\n\nThe essential features of a stage booth are a three-dimensional rectilinear wooden frame large enough for several players to stand in, with curtains suspended from the top which can be drawn aside to reveal or closed to conceal the occupants, and perhaps a solid roof strong enough to support a player or two.\n\n(Egan, 1998, 44)\n\nSuch properties, with canvas stretched over a skeleton of wooden poles and lath, were simply drawn or carried on and off stage by stage-keepers or attendant players at need, within full view of the audience. The brief intervals observed between acts even by the adult companies by 1614 would have made it easy for such large items to be moved without interrupting the action at all. Unlike Cleopatra’s ‘monument’ or presumably Scoto’s ‘bank’ in Volpone, 2.2.2, Ursula’s booth did not require the strength to support actors clambering on it, and indeed it is clear from 3.2.45-6 that it was at least in part covered with boughs. On the other hand, it may well have been a good deal larger than usual. It has been reckoned that an average of sixteen square yards of canvas was used for the ‘houses’ brought on stage in court performances of the later sixteenth century (Nagler, 1981, 41). Assuming a height of six feet, so much canvas would at most be enough for a square structure with sides six feet long, or eight feet if the front was open, or curtained with another material. Bearing in mind that Ursula’s booth is in two sections, this would hardly be large enough for the crowded beginning of the ‘vapours’ scene, even though the action was no doubt quick to spill onto the main stage. It is probable, therefore, that this was a booth of large size. Since coarse canvas cost about a shilling a yard (Linthicum, 96-7), this is compatible with the 41s 6d spent on ‘canvas for the booths and other necessaries’. In any event, the front of the booth must have had curtains that could be used to hide or reveal those within (as in Egan’s summary).\n\nThe third large property, the stocks, must also have been somewhat larger than standard. They were usually light enough to be carried on and off when required, as indicated by the direction Stocks brought out in King Lear, 2.2. In Bartholomew Fair, 4.6, they have to restrain not a single prisoner as in Lear but Wasp, Busy, and Justice Overdo all at once. This could have made for a very substantial property, but it appears to have been kept less bulky by having only three holes, with only one leg of each prisoner locked in place. At 4.1.27 and 4.6.37 and 65 the prisoners are each commanded to put just one leg in, and Wasp’s deft manner of escape exploits this.\n\nFourthly, Lantern’s puppet-show seems to have used glove-puppets (5.3.55 SDn.), and so will have required a simple kiosk-theatre of what became the Punch-and-Judy type. This presumably stood, however, within a large booth: a defined structure around the theatre itself is required by the display of a banner attracting patrons within, by the demands of the doormen for entrance money, and by the way some prospective clients hover outside. (Admittedly, this structure could simply have been indicated by ropes, posts, or barriers about a free-standing kiosk, as Eugene Waith suggests (ed. Bart Fair, 216) and as in some modern productions, but the established tradition of stage-booths and the realism of the mise-en-scène make this less likely.) Since the scenes of the puppet-play have as many as fourteen speaking characters on stage, plus the unseen puppeteers and no doubt some supernumerary boys and bystanders, with over twenty named characters on stage for the last scene, the booth must again have been large, even though there was no doubt a rapid overspill onto the main stage as the action continued. It must have been possible not only to open the front, as with Ursula’s booth, but also at least part of the sides of the structure: the audience needs to be able to follow the detail of the puppet-play within the booth and also to follow the reactions of the onlookers, in whom, after all, it is more interested.\n\nThe question arises how these four major properties might have been deployed on the stage at the Hope and the Banqueting House. The most detailed studies assume a static staging. Waith sums up his minute analysis: ‘Only in the change from Littlewit’s house [which occupied the whole stage] to the Fair is the entire stage used to represent first one locality, then another. Thereafter all localities are simultaneously present and the action moves from one to another’ (217). R.B. Parker goes further, proposing an elaborate, emblematic layout, with Ursula’s booth symbolising hell in the traditional ‘sinister’ position, stage left, the puppet-theatre standing in as a comic heaven in the traditional position of stage right, and with the stocks downstage centre ‘as an emblem of the trials that this world imposes on the virtuous’ (1970, 295). Since the puppet-theatre is not required until Act 5, it does duty as the Littlewits’ house in Act 1, and has the stands of Leatherhead and Trash in front of it during Acts 2 and 3. This schema is unpersuasive: the domestic action of Act 1 seems to be taking place in the Fair, with the action confined by it to one part of the stage; one large booth, dominating up to half the stage, is then left unused for three acts, with its alleged (and inexplicit) symbolic function unrevealed; the stocks are required only in Act 4, and for most of the play would simply be a dead space and a distraction, and, if placed downstage as Parker suggests, would hamper the sight lines of the central groundlings.\n\nWhile both Waith and Parker assume a static stage, it is clear that even large props could be moved and assembled speedily. In Volpone, for example, the bed is moved on and off several times, while Scoto’s ‘bank’ is assembled within twenty-five lines of dialogue or about a minute and a quarter. In any case, the precise structure of Bartholomew Fair act by act means that major changes of set always coincide with an interval, and it is clear that a versatile staging would have posed no problems. Moreover, for all the complexities of the play’s action and detailed mise-en-scène, it is carefully devised to work with a simple and flexible use of the larger props. Act 1 requires none of them at all, and Act 5 requires only the puppet-theatre within its booth (scene 2 takes place outside, but just by, that theatre, 5.2.109-10). Waith (209) argues that Ursula’s booth should remain visible on stage because at 5.6.12-13 John says of Win: ‘I left her at the great woman’s house in trust yonder, the pig-woman’s’, a reading of ‘yonder’ which is surely too literal when taken to mean he is pointing at the booth itself. Indeed, if all John has to do when searching for Win at Ursula’s is to cross the stage, so remaining in sight, it becomes implausible that the search takes him two long scenes, since he sets off to find her early in 5.4.\n\nSince the only large property required for Act 5 is the puppet-theatre, and since sight lines are important if the audience is to follow both the puppet-play and the reactions of the crowded stage-audience, it would make sense for the booth to be located upstage centre, with the side-curtains open, and with the members of the stage-audience fanning out and spreading beyond the confines of the booth once entrance money has been paid and the performance gets under way. There are likely to have been only a few chairs on stage for them to fix their positions (5.4.25 SDn.).\n\nIn Acts 2 and 3, a more complex layout is required, since there are three principal settings: Ursula’s booth (which is the focus of half the scenes), the ground occupied by Leatherhead and Trash — it is clear from the opening of 2.2 that these are close together — and unlocalized scenes. Apart from the Justice’s soliloquies in 2.1 and 3.3 (which would presumably be spoken at the very front of the stage, with the life of the Fair stirring behind him), there are only two unlocalized scenes: Overdo’s speech as ‘Mad Arthur’ and Nightingale’s ‘Caveat for Cutpurses’ (2.6 and 3.5), in each of which Cokes loses a purse. Each of these requires a crowded stage and is the climax of its act, and it makes most sense for them to hold the centre stage. It follows that in these acts the action flows between three stage-areas, presumably with Ursula’s booth and Leatherhead’s shop standing somewhat upstage and to opposite sides — casual chatter does not require them to be close together — with the central downstage area free for the climactic scenes. Waith envisages Ursula’s booth as central (212), but such a large booth in this position would cramp the staging of the climaxes.\n\nAct 4 works on similar lines, but with the stocks on stage throughout instead of Leatherhead’s shop. It would make sense, therefore, for the stocks to stand where the shop did, again leaving the centre-stage free for the two unlocalized scenes (although this time the scene of theft from Cokes, 4.2, is less noisy and climactic than the game of ‘vapours’ in and around Ursula’s booth, 4.4).\n\nThis simple and almost symmetrical scheme requires sizeable properties to be moved on or off stage at the end of acts 1, 3, and 4, but, as argued above, this is no problem, since the set is unchanged within each act and intervals marked the transitions between acts (2.1.0n.). In passing, it may be noted that the ease of fitting such changes into the play makes even more unnecessary Herford and Simpson’s unsupported suggestion that the first act was played ‘above’ on the upper stage (10.170).\n\nAny disturbance caused by moving properties would have been lessened if, as suggested above, Leatherhead’s shop could simply be wheeled off stage and if, as is very probable, what had for three acts been Ursula’s booth became the puppet-theatre (a suggestion made in passing by Armstrong, 1960, 54). All that then would be required at the end of Act 4 would be moving a structure of canvas and light timber from one side of the stage to the centre and setting the puppet-theatre itself in the front compartment. Egan argues that this economy of means is unlikely, since the Revels accounts refer to ‘booths’ in the plural (1998, 46). But on his own evidence ‘booth’ was the technical term for large properties of all kinds, from rocks to the mouth of hell — he even argues that it is ironically unorthodox for a stage booth to be representing a real booth (44) — and it follows that Leatherhead’s shop, whatever form it took, could be classified as a booth. Moreover, the change of function for the large booth is made explicit by the stress on the puppet-theatre’s sign at the very beginning of Act 5, contrasting with the emphasis on Ursula’s sign in 3.2. Presumably the change was also marked by removing the boughs that had been covering part of the booth, so opening up the sight lines.\n\nIt follows from this discussion that whatever elaborations may have been worked around the written text in the early performances — and the listing of boys and other supernumerary characters in the Persons and the silent presence on stage of Leatherhead from 2.2.25 to 2.4.3 imply that the dialogue was spoken against some background activities suggesting the wider Fair — the essentials required to stage the exceptionally complex action of the play work with very economical means. Although the play made unusual demands in that it was rare for more than two large properties to be needed in a single play, there are, as Parker points out (1970, 307), analogous three-booth sets in Middleton and Dekker, The Roaring Girl, 2.1 (c. 1608) and Heywood (?), The Fair Maid of the Exchange (c. 1602). Other advantages apart, this basic simplicity must have aided the actors in their instant transfer of a still unfamiliar play from the Hope to Whitehall. The cast would need to be instantly at home on a second stage, where the large properties were not from their own theatre but supplied by the Revels Office. The virtue of a basic simplicity was borne out by the seminal modern production of the play, by George Devine for the Old Vic Company in 1950-51. This opened at the Edinburgh Festival in the Assembly Rooms, with a vast set recreating a fair in immense detail strung across the width of the large hall. As mentioned below, when the production moved to London four months later, reviewers were unanimous in preferring the version as slimmed down for the Old Vic Theatre.\n\n1614-1642\n\nThere is no direct evidence for the success of Bartholomew Fair with its original audiences. Although it is supposed to have been so popular that it established the catchphrase ‘O rare Ben Jonson’, which was to be carved on his tombstone, the evidence is late. The antiquary William Oldys (who was not born until 1696) noted in a copy of Gerard Langbaine, An Account of the English Dramatic Poets (1691) ‘what old Mr Clud told me of the inscription on his [Jonson’s] tombstone arising from the popular applause of this play [Bartholomew Fair] after his solemn Catiline had been coldly received by the audience’ (H&S, 1.183). Nevertheless, the prevailing assumption has been that so rich a play must have been successful.\n\nParadoxically, it is often suggested that this successful play was performed only twice in Jonson’s lifetime, because no performances other than those recalled in the text itself are on record (e.g. Sturgess, 1987, 170; Kay, 1995, 149). But by this token there were only three contemporary performances of Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night, one of Much Ado about Nothing, and none at all of As You Like It — all undoubtedly popular plays. It is true that Bartholomew Fair demanded a large cast and a lot of props and was closely associated with the court, but why go to the trouble of setting up such an elaborate play only to drop it, especially as the courtly associations would add to the play’s prestige? The court, after all, paid only the standard fee of £10, hardly enough to justify the effort and expense.\n\nAs it happens, there are hints that the play was less than a universal success. The contempt for the audience expressed in the Horatian epigraph on the title page suggests as much. Also, Drummond records: ‘To me he read the preface of his Art of Poesy, upon Horace’s Art of Poesy, where he hath an apology of a play of his, St Bartholomew’s Fair’ (Informations, 58-9). While this means an apology in the sense of a vindication, it appears that Jonson felt the play needed some defence. Perhaps it was vulnerable because the extreme complexity of the plotting and the lack of clear moral teaching made it seem to fall short of Horatian ideals of narrative and moral coherence in the Ars Poetica. Herford and Simpson suggest that the play ‘cannot have satisfied his stricter critical conscience’ (1.70), and accept as authentic an anecdote recorded by William Rufus Chetwood in Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Ben Jonson, Esq (Dublin, 1756, 25-6) that the play ‘had prodigious success, and, as Ben himself, in a letter to a friend, says, \"so unmerited, that, for the time to come, he would feed the swine with the husks or chaff of wit, since the good grain [i.e. Catiline] they had no relish for”’. But Chetwood was known from the first to be fanciful and unreliable. There are no grounds for thinking that Jonson denigrated a play he was to dedicate to the King; indeed, the induction claims just the opposite — ‘he prays you to believe his ware is still the same’ (121). It is far more likely that in writing the apology Jonson sought understanding for what he knew was a masterpiece, innovative and therefore open to misapprehension.\n\nEven so, the very writing of an ‘apology’ — which was presumably burnt and lost in 1623 along with the fuller commentary on Horace (‘An Execration upon Vulcan’, 89-91, Und. 43.89-91) — implies that there had been a mixed reception. This is borne out by the most explicit account, in ‘A Funeral Elegy’ on Jonson by John Taylor the ‘water poet’: ‘His play of Barthol. Fair gave much delight / To all, but such as understood not right’ (93-4; see the Literary Record, Electronic Edition). This statement seems the more trustworthy and discriminating because it is immediately followed by an account of the failure of The Magnetic Lady.\n\nIt may well be, however, that ‘such as understood not right’ were primarily those puritans who were hostile to theatre. Not long after writing the play Jonson asked his friend John Selden’s advice on the interpretation of Deuteronomy, 22.5, the basis of the key puritan argument against the theatre (exploited by Busy at 5.5.77-9): ‘The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto the man, neither shall a man put on woman’s raiment: for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God.’ Selden was to reply on 28 February 1616 in a formidably erudite letter, brushing aside puritanical readings of the verse (Rosenblatt & Schleiner, 1999; see Electronic Edition, Letters to Jonson). Presumably Jonson had turned to Selden because he felt the need to arm himself against puritan criticism.\n\nMoreover, when Pepys saw the play on 7 September 1661 he was to record: ‘Here was Bartholomew Fair with the puppet-show acted today, which had not been these forty years (it being so satirical against puritanism they durst not till now)’ (Craig, 1990, 230). Consequently Herford and Simpson assert: ‘Soon after 1620 the play, at least in its complete form, disappeared from the stage’ (2.131). There is no need, however, to take Pepys’s account so literally. In Jonsonus Virbius (1638), Henry Ramsay’s elegy includes an ironic list of Jonson’s ‘faults’:\n\nThat he exposed you zealots, to make known\n\nYour profanation and not his own?\n\nThat one of such a fervent nose should be\n\nPosed by a puppet in Divinity?\n\nIt follows that, despite puritan opposition, Busy’s clash with the puppet had been performed fairly recently, since Ramsay, still an undergraduate at Christ Church, was seventeen on matriculation in June 1635 and the play was still unpublished. Nevertheless, while Pepys’s account of what was performed before he was born cannot be strictly accurate, it does confirm that the play was known to have aroused puritan hostility.\n\nIt is clear from Taylor and Ramsay that the play had not disappeared from the stage, whether after the initial pair of performances or a longer run, but had successfully established itself in the theatrical repertoire. The unique dedication of this professional’s play to a king also implies, at the least, that it was a success at court, since even Jonson, in his stubborn defensiveness, would not have insulted King James’s memory with a play that he had not enjoyed. In the intermean after Act 3 of The Staple of News, the gossip Censure refers in passing to Zeal-of-the-land Busy (51), while in ‘An Expostulation’ Jonson comments on the new magistrate Inigo Jones: ‘How would he firk, like Adam Overdo, / Up and about, dive into cellars, too, / Disguised, and thence drag forth enormity’ (79-82). In Brome’s The Weeding of the Covent Garden (1632-4), a play influenced throughout by Bartholomew Fair (Butler, 1984, 151-8), Justice Cockbrain recalls and is based on ‘my reverend ancestor Justice Adam Overdo’ (2.1.1n.). The point of these references is that familiarity with characters in a play that was still unpublished is taken for granted: the play must have been performed so often that audiences could be relied on to pick up the allusions.\n\nNumerous less explicit echoes suggest that Bartholomew Fair was a major presence in theatrical and literary experience well before it was published. For example, Cokes’s yearning to catch a thief is closely followed by an episode in Middleton’s Hengist, King of Kent, or The Mayor of Queenborough (c. 1619-20), 5.1, the earliest clear-cut sign of the play’s influence (see 3.5.29n.). As Baskerville (1908-09), 125 notes, the episodes have the same pattern of a stupid clown’s pitting himself against cheaters, only to lose, and a shrewder clown’s censuring him only to become a more notable victim. Jonson’s induction (notes to 66-7 and 78-9) is echoed in the preface to Shakespeare’s first Folio, while Richard Brathwait’s character-sketch of ‘A Zealous Brother’ in Whimsies (1631) is close to Busy (1.6.36n.). The Drinking Academy, 3.2, where Jack Bidstand sings a ballad while Tom Nimmer robs Simple, is very closely based on Jonson’s 3.5, and if, as its editors claim, this play is by Thomas Randolph, then it will have been written in or close to 1628. (It is not impossible, however, that it was written in the 1640s by an imitator, Robert Baron: see Moore Smith, 1930.)\n\nVarious other possible signs of early influence have been noted (Bentley, JCS, 4.885, 902; 5.1167, 1238). Middleton’s The Widow (c. 1616) includes in 4.2 a pickpocketing episode where the thief deflects his crimes onto an innocent and where the theft enables him to exploit a magistrate’s blank warrants. A Cambridge academic comedy in Latin, Fucus Histriomastix (1623), probably by Robert Ward, features an aggressively antitheatrical and hypocritical puritan on the general lines of Busy. James Shirley’s The Witty Fair One (1628) includes, in Brains and the Tutor, belligerent servingmen with some similarity to Wasp. When Brains insists in 5.4 that he will be mad ‘in spite of any man here; who shall hinder me if I have a mind to it?’ he resembles the knotty perversity of Wasp: ‘I am not i’the right, nor never was i’the right, nor never will be i’the right, while I am in my right mind’ (4.4.58-9). In none of these plays, however, is direct influence certain.\n\nIt is also possible (as argued by Perkinson, 1936) that Bartholomew Fair initiated a genre of topographical comedy especially popular in the 1630s, notably Marmion’s Holland’s Leaguer (1631), Shirley’s Hyde Park (1632), Nabbes’s Covent Garden (1633) and Tottenham Court (1633), and Brome’s The Weeding of the Covent Garden and The Sparagus Garden (1635). But (as pointed out by T. Miles, 1942), any influence from Jonson’s use of place is not deeply assimilated, since the detailed London settings of these plays are confined to a few scenes of local colour; they are not intrinsic to the whole play, like the Fair to the Fair.\n\nA rare token of the play’s standing is its appearance in the commonplace book of an Anglican divine, Abraham Wright (1611-90), a man of literary interests who had acted at university. His detailed comments on the printed texts of twenty-eight plays — the most detailed comments on contemporary drama between Jonson himself and Dryden — were probably compiled in the early 1640s, and show a Caroline preference for the Beaumont and Fletcher tradition of tragicomedy. Hamlet and The Staple of News, for example, are dismissed as ‘indifferent’ plays, but Bartholomew Fair is relished:\n\nA good play . . . Almost any scene is good where Cokes, who is a silly gentleman, or Wasp, who is an old testy fellow his man, or Purecraft, who is a she-puritan, or Busy, who is a he-one, or Ursula, who is a huge fat [pig] woman and soundly baffled for’t, or Leatherhead, who is also Lantern that shows the puppet play, or Nightingale a ballad singer, or the costermonger, or Troubleall a madman, comes in.\n\n(Kirsch, 1969, 256-7)\n\nEven under Cromwell, the play remained a familiar source of allusion: in The Surfeit (1656), Philip Kynder argues that limiting analysis of ancient Greek social custom to what can be found in the poets and dramatists would be ‘as if one in future age should make all England in ages past to be a Bartholomew Fair, because Ben Jonson hath writ it, or that the condition of all our English women may be drawn out of Shakespeare’s merry wives of Windsor’ (Bradley and Adams, 1922, 313).\n\nIt can safely be assumed, then, that Bartholomew Fair was well known in its own day (Teague, 1985, 50). But who was performing it, since Henslowe, who must have paid for it, died in January 1616, and the Lady Elizabeth’s company flourished for only a short time in London before becoming a touring company (and hence unlikely to perform a play requiring such a large cast and so many props)? A Lady Elizabeth’s company did return to London in the early 1620s, but Henry Ramsay can have been only about seven when it disappeared at King Charles’s accession. It is very probable that by the time Ramsay saw the play, and probably years earlier, it had been taken over by the King’s Men, by far the richest and most powerful company of the period, for which most of Jonson’s work had been written. This is almost certainly what happened by 1625 with a much lesser Lady Elizabeth’s play, The Honest Man’s Fortune, by John Fletcher and others (ed. Ioppolo, xviii-xix).[.] The leading Lady Elizabeth’s actors, Nathan Field and Joseph Taylor, 5.3.61-2 and 67 notes), transferred to starring roles with the King’s Men in 1616 and 1619 respectively, while in 1669 Bartholomew Fair is included in a reliable list of over 100 King’s Men plays (Bentley, JCS, 1.121; Van Lennep, 1965, 151).\n\n1660-1700\n\nSince no performances of Bartholomew Fair are recorded between its dual première and the closure of the theatres in 1642, its popularity with early audiences can only be inferred from incidental allusions. Superficially, its popularity in the three-quarters of a century following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the consequent re-opening of the theatres is more a matter of record, with eleven individual performances known up to 1700, and well over thirty in the first three decades of the eighteenth century (see Appendix 1 below). But the bald figures are treacherous; they have, for example, misled Frances Teague into declaring that there was a marked decline in productions after an initial rush in 1661, that the play was neglected in the last quarter of the seventeenth century, and that there was ‘a flurry of revivals’ early in the next century (1985, 70, 76, 79). Such conclusions are vulnerable because a mere 7% of the performances of all works in London theatres over the four decades following the Restoration can be positively identified (Milhous and Hume, 1996, v), whereas early in the new century London theatres began advertising many of their performances in the Daily Courant, the city’s newspaper, so that nearly all of them (and many of their leading performers) are known. In the decades before such advertising became common practice, it is pure chance whether a particular performance is recorded or not. Bartholomew Fair seems to have been especially popular in the 1660s, for example — with nine of the eleven later seventeenth-century performances falling in this decade — merely because Samuel Pepys (whose diary covers only 1660-69) loved the play and saw it repeatedly. We know it was being performed in Dublin at Christmas 1670 only because of the tragic deaths of some members of the audience.\n\nAccording to identifiable performances, the play was off the stage between 1674 and 1702, but John Downes records in his Roscius Anglicanus, or an Historical Review of the Stage (1708) that the famous comedian James Nokes took the part of Cokes, and he can have done so only between 1682 and his retirement from the stage c. 1691 (Downes, 1987, 42). Moreover, in 1691 Gerard Langbaine (who was not born until 1656) says of Bartholomew Fair in his Account of the English Dramatic Poets: ‘This play has frequently appeared on the stage since the Restoration, with great applause’ (Bradley and Adams, 1922, 432), while Charles Gildon confirms in his 1699 continuation of Langbaine that the play has been ‘acted with good applause since King Charles the Second’s Restoration’ (Bentley, 1945, 2.257). Actual performances across the decades must have far outweighed the few recorded by chance: it is known, for example, that in 1662 Dr Edward Browne paid one shilling and sixpence to see the play acted by the King’s Company, but it is not known exactly when (Noyes, 1935, 224). It may even be significant that Pepys notes in his diary for 12 November 1661 that he has seen a certain form of the play ‘often’, though the diary records only two occasions.\n\nFor two decades after the Restoration, London theatre was dominated by two competing patent companies: the King’s Company, led by Thomas Killigrew, and the Duke’s Company, under Sir William Davenant until his death in 1668. Downes, who was prompter with Duke’s from 1662 to 1706, recorded much later that Bartholomew Fair was formally assigned to the King’s Men on 8 April 1663, not as one of ‘their principal old stock plays’ (which included Volpone, The Alchemist, and Epicene) but among ‘old plays [that] were acted but now and then; yet, being well performed, were very satisfactory to the town’ (1987, 25-6). Duke’s, a company largely of inexperienced actors, started at Salisbury Court and moved soon to Lincoln’s Inn Fields and a theatre that had the up-to-date advantage of changeable scenery, before moving triumphantly in 1671 to the Dorset Garden Theatre. From November 1660 until May 1663, the King’s Company performed in the Vere Street Theatre made out of Gibbons’s tennis court, but this lacked changeable scenery and the competition forced the troupe to move in 1663 to Bridges Street, Drury Lane, to the first of a series of theatres that was to make that name the most renowned in London’s theatrical history. At first the advantage lay with this company, which had performance rights to a rich repertoire of Renaissance plays, as well as the more experienced actors. But Davenant and his successors adapted more readily to the changing public, revising plays to exploit a new taste for music in drama and for elaborate staging, and by 1682 the Duke’s Company was strong enough to absorb the King’s into a new United Company and take over its repertoire. The formal union was on 4 May, and acting began on 15 November. Bartholomew Fair is included in the list of plays said by Downes to have been revived by the new company (1987, 82).\n\nBartholomew Fair was an obvious and yet controversial play to restore to the stage early in the Restoration — obvious because of Jonson’s standing and the play’s earlier popularity, and because of the appeal of its anti-puritan satire to royalists in London, but controversial precisely because of the force of that satire in a city that was still predominantly puritan and wary of the restored monarch. Charles II evidently liked the play: he was present when Pepys was in the audience on 7 September 1661; there were command performances for him in July 1667 and November 1674; and it was performed at court in February 1669. To many, this liking of the King’s was hardly a recommendation.\n\nThe explosive potential of Bartholomew Fair was evident in reactions to a disaster at the Theatre Royal, Smock Alley, Dublin, on 26 December 1670, when the theatre galleries suddenly collapsed during a gala holiday production, and four people died (with early reports claiming as many as eighteen deaths). The crash happened, according to eye-witnesses, when Busy was put in the stocks. Moreover, according to one report, Busy was being played as a caricature of the eminent puritan divine, Richard Baxter (Baxter, 1696, 84). (The temptation to relate so vivid a character to real life has not been resisted: some recent productions, such as Richard Eyre’s for the National Theatre in 1988 and Laurence Boswell’s for the RSC in 1997, have had the actor mimic the Ulster politician, the Rev. Ian Paisley.) Though the impersonation of Baxter is unproven, Nonconformists certainly viewed the catastrophe — a bizarre parallel to the climax of Milton’s recently licensed and advertised Samson Agonistes — as the act of an angry God. An Irish Presbyterian preacher reported:\n\nAnd there, among other parts of the play, the poor shadow of a Nonconformist minister is mocked and upbraided . . . But behold, when his shadow is brought to the stocks, as an affront upon Presbyterian ministers and to teach great persons to deal with like severity toward them, down came the upper gallery on to the middle one, where gentlemen and others sat, and that gallery broke too, and much of it fell down on the lords and ladies . . . Such providences, so circumstantial in divers respects, will not pass without the observation of impartial and prudent persons.\n\n(W. S. Clark, 1955, 69-70)\n\nTo extremer puritans, this supposed act of divine vengeance fulfilled their horror at an earlier and apparently even more provocative occasion. On 12 October 1661, the Rev. William Hooke, a puritan minister, wrote to a friend about the outrageous Play of a Puritan performed before the King, three bishops, and some of the highest in the land. It caricatured the dress and manner of Baxter and another leading puritan divine, Edmund Calamy, ‘with such scripture expressions as I am loath to mention . . . one representing the Puritan put in the stocks for stealing a pig, and the stocks found by him unlocked, which he admires at as a wonderful providence and fruit of prayer . . . Some present, who were far from liking the Puritan, were greatly astonished, wondering the house did not fall upon their heads’ (H&S, 9.246). Hooke continues: ‘The play, I hear, was taken out of one or two of Ben Jonson’s’, and the exploitation of Bartholomew Fair, presumably along with The Alchemist, is unmistakable. (This statement confirms that scholars who identify this play with Bartholomew Fair itself must be mistaken.)\n\nA weightier re-working of Bartholomew Fair also reveals the disturbing force of that play in early Restoration society. In John Wilson’s satiric comedy The Cheats, first performed in 1663, Scruple the central character is a puritan divine based on Busy — though, as Michael Cordner (1999, 176) has argued, there is enough distinctiveness to avoid mere duplication. The Cheats was the first comedy written and performed after the King’s return to deal with critical issues of politics and religion in an explicitly Restoration setting, and this entry into uncharted territory led to repeated trouble with the censor. In 1663 it was highly controversial to expose a silenced minister to mockery, and even the King felt a need to respond to objections. Audiences watching The Cheats would have been pervasively aware of Bartholomew Fair, not only because Wilson is so Jonsonian a writer but also through what Cordner terms his ‘intertextual gamesmanship’ (176). Scruple provided a bravura role for the great King’s Company comedian John Lacy (c. 1615-81), a leading member of the company from the outset and a favourite actor of the King and also of Pepys, an actor who relished taking risks with his parts and his audiences. (Information on individual performers, 1660-1735, here and below is drawn largely from Burnim et al., 1973-93.) No early cast lists for Bartholomew Fair survive, but since Lacy was an established success as Ananias in The Alchemist and is also known to have played Captain Otter and Falstaff, it is very likely that he played Busy. Throughout The Cheats it is probable that the audience was aware of Jonsonian actors playing deft variations on Jonsonian roles.\n\nAnother instance of an early Restoration dramatist responding with relish to Zeal-of-the-land Busy comes with a recently discovered play dated 1662 on the title page, News from Geneva, or The Lewd Levite, by William Lawrence. The principal object of Lawrence’s satire is the Puritan title character Levi, and, among various Jonsonian echoes, he meets the same fate as Busy when he is put in the stocks. Lawrence’s connections and sympathies had previously been with the revolutionary government, but in presenting Levi as a Puritan ready to ‘bring a text for rebellion’ — that is, to offer biblical justification for revolution — he may be seeking to rehabilitate himself under the monarchy. (Private communication from Martin Wiggins.)\n\nThe conflict of response aroused by a play that was of canonical authority and yet highly provocative is revealed most intimately by the one habitual theatre-goer of those years who has left his feelings on record: Samuel Pepys, lover of women, music, and the theatre, a puritan in his youth and an admirer of Oliver Cromwell, but now a firm Anglican and a loyal servant of the restored monarchy. His diary for 8 June 1661 includes: ‘Then I went to the Theatre and there saw Bartlemew Fair, the first time it was acted nowadays. It is [a] most admirable play and well acted; but too much profane and abusive.’ On 7 September, he records seeing the play again: ‘And here was Bartholomew Fair, with the puppet show, acted today, which had not been these forty years (it being so satirical against puritanism, they durst not till now; which is strange they should already dare to do it, and the King to countenance it); but I do never a whit like it the better for the puppets, and rather the worse.’ This can hardly mean that the puppets had been entirely absent, since the play would have been left without Act 5 and a denouement. Presumably the action had jumped from puppet Dionysius’ exasperated awakening at the end of 5.4 to Justice Overdo’s intervention at the end of 5.5, leaving out Busy’s earlier intervention and his humiliation by the puppet. Prudence must have dictated omitting such provocation from the earliest Restoration performances. But it seems from this performance in September 1661 and of the taunting Play of the Puritan around the same time that the players were now prepared to take more risks. Pepys’s reaction suggests that even for the broad-minded the restoration of Busy’s defeat is a gratuitous act of daring, or foolhardiness, and he is troubled that the King seems to condone it.\n\nStill, for all his mixed feelings, Pepys was back at the play after a couple of months, on 12 November: ‘So abroad with Sir W. Pen, my wife and I, to Bartholomew Fair, with puppets (which I have seen once before, and the play without puppets often); but though I love the play as much as ever I did, yet I do not like the puppets at all, but think it to be a lessening to it.’\n\nPepys’s next record of a performance, on 2 August 1664, is more straightforward: ‘Thence to the King’s playhouse and there saw Bartholomew Fair, which doth still please me and is, as it is acted, the best comedy in the world, I believe.’ The praise is high, and almost exactly how he was to celebrate Volpone on 14 January the next year and Epicene on 19 September 1668. But his reactions remained divided; on 4 September 1668 (when the Fair was still running because it had been extended to a fortnight), he and friends ate a pig there, ‘but saw no sights, my wife having a mind to see the play, Bartholomew Fair, with puppets; which we did, and it is an excellent play; the more I see it, the more I love the wit of it; only, the business of abusing the puritans begins to grow stale and of no use, they being the people that at last will be found the wisest.’\n\nAlthough nothing later in the century illuminates the play’s performances and the divided reactions they aroused as much as Pepys does, Bartholomew Fair clearly remained a living element in London’s imaginative life, a source of allusion and a central instance in the discussion of drama. In 1668, for example, Francis Kirkman and Richard Head described a grotesque woman as ‘the representation of the Pig-woman in Ben’s Bartholomew Fair’ (The English Rogue, cited Bentley, 1945, 2.135), and Dryden in his Essay of Dramatic Poesy celebrates its variety as opposed to the ‘thin sown’ French drama of the time, and also its transmutation of sordid matter: ‘The copy is of price, though the original be vile’ (Craig, 1990, 249, 266). Dryden’s antagonist, Thomas Shadwell, in the preface to The Humorists (1671), celebrates it in turn as ‘one of the wittiest plays in the world’, so that ‘the most excellent Jonson put wit into the mouths of the meanest of his people, and, which is infinitely difficult, made it proper for ’em’ (Craig, 285).\n\nNumerous glancing allusions show that the audience or reader was assumed to be entirely familiar with Bartholomew Fair, even though it was available in print only in the substantial and costly F2 until the even more substantial F3 of 1692 and the collected works in multiple volumes of 1716 and 1729. In Dryden’s Sir Martin Mar-All (acted 1667), for example, the character Warner grumbles: ‘Why, sir, are you stark mad? . . . He’s gone! Now is he as earnest in the quarrel as Cokes among the puppets; ’tis to no purpose, whatever I do for him’ (5.1; Bradley and Adams, 337). In Shadwell’s The Virtuoso (1676), Sir Samuel exclaims: ‘Ha! What’s here, a rope? I am delivered as Rabbi Busy was, by miracle. I’ll slide down from the window into the garden’ (Act 4; Bentley, 1945, 2.170). Cokes’s self-nickname of ‘resolute Bat’ is repeatedly invoked (1.5.50n.). The whole play was seen as a quasi-proverbial source of graphic situations. Introducing City Politics (1683), John Crowne asks rhetorically: ‘Is it possible I should be such a Bartholomew Cokes to pull out my purse in a fair, and as soon as ever a knave tickled my ear with a straw — a little, silly flattery — I should let go my discretion and perhaps my fortune?’ (Bentley, 1945, 2.184). Similarly, in 1690 Thomas D’Urfey published a burlesque poem, ‘Collin’s Walk through London and Westminster’, in which Collin the puritanical provincial is taken to a performance of Bartholomew Fair. He believes himself at a non-conformist conventicle until Busy is put in the stocks — at which he draws his sword and creates an uproar, ‘For sake of brotherhood to ease him, / And from his wooden shame release him’ (Noyes, 1935, 230-3). Jeremy Collier, A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage (1698), assumes when he meets outrageous blasphemies in the mouth of chaplain Bull in Vanbrugh’s The Relapse that ‘the thought is borrowed from Ben Jonson’s Bartholomew Fair, only the profaneness is mightily improved’ (109).\n\nClearly Bartholomew Fair was living theatre up to and beyond the end of the seventeenth century. It was accepted as one of Jonson’s great plays, though it tended to be placed a little behind his three comedies of 1605-10. For example, Milton’s nephew, Edward Phillips, writes in Theatrum Poetarum (1675): ‘In three of his comedies, namely The Fox, Alchemist, and Silent Woman, [Jonson] may be compared . . . as well with the chief of the ancient Greek and Latin comedians as the prime of modern Italians . . . nor is his Bartholomew Fair much short of them’ (Bradley and Adams, 1922, 379). This judgment became standard, and was echoed by other writers, e.g. William Winstanley in 1684 (Bradley and Adams, 407) and Sir Thomas Pope Blount in 1694 (Bentley, 1945, 2.236).\n\nUnfortunately, little can be known about how the play was performed. That Busy is said to steal a pig in both The Play of the Puritan and ‘Collin’s Walk’, works nearly thirty years apart, suggests that this had become a traditional piece of comic business. Very few actors can be linked with given roles, although members of the acting companies are listed year-by-year in part 1 of The London Stage. As mentioned above, the leading comic actor John Lacy starred as Busy. John Downes also notes: ‘Mr Wintersel [William Wintershall] was good in tragedy as well as in comedy, especially in Cokes in Bartholomew Fair; that the famous comedian Nokes came in that part far short of him’ (1987, 42). This is praise indeed because Nokes was to be celebrated by Colley Cibber in his Apology for the Life of Colley Cibber (1740) and seems to have been born to play Cokes: he ‘was an actor of a quite different genius from any I have ever read, heard of, or seen . . . and yet his general excellence may be comprehended in one article, viz. a plain and palpable simplicity of nature . . . utterly his own’. Nokes played with the Duke’s Company, which only had access to Jonson’s plays after the amalgamation with King’s in 1682. The part of Cokes had earlier belonged to Wintershall, who also played Sir Amorous LaFoole and possibly Subtle and who had died in 1679.\n\nAlthough little that is precise can be known about performances, there is no reason to doubt that standards remained high. The performers were the star actors of the day, and, as Pepys wrote of the performance on 2 August 1664, Bartholomew Fair ‘doth still please me and is, as it is acted, the best comedy in the world, I believe’.\n\n1700-1735\n\nSuperficially, the details recorded in Appendices 1 and 2 below would suggest that in the first three decades of the eighteenth century the popularity of Bartholomew Fair was at its zenith, so that the abrupt succession of two centuries of absence from the stage would be inexplicable. Thirty-four performances are known within these decades, after only thirteen in the previous eighty-six years, while it is also known who played the major roles at most of them. Properly seen, however, these years saw the play’s reputation beginning to decline. Bartholomew Fair was the first of Jonson’s great comedies to drop out of the repertoire — it anticipated by almost half a century his virtual disappearance from the stage between about 1776 and his gradual renaissance in the twentieth century.\n\nAs mentioned above, the crucial distinction between records before and after 1700 is that over a few years early in the new century the acting companies began advertising their performances and publicising their star actors, initially in the Daily Courant. Whereas very few performances from 1660-1700 can be positively identified, most performances at Drury Lane were being advertised, often with cast lists, by 1703-4 and records are close to complete from 1705, while the rival company at Lincoln’s Inn Fields was advertising fairly regularly by early 1704. After 1706 almost all performances are known (Milhous and Hume, 1996, v, and year-by-year introductions).\n\nAn average of slightly more than one performance a year over 1702-31 suggests that Bartholomew Fair remained an established but secondary favourite, a welcome though marginal part of the repertoire. It is noticeable, however, that despite a late cluster of eleven performances in 1718-22, the play was on stage markedly more in the first dozen years of the period than in the following eighteen, and the 1731 performance was the first for almost a decade. Moreover, the popularity of the play in those earlier years seems to have been very much bound up with the actual Fair: eight of the nineteen performances were during the Fair or in the approach to it, and some advertisements make the connection explicit. The appeal of the performance for 22 August 1707, for example, is its ‘being the last time of acting till after the Fair’ and on 26 August 1712 its ‘being the last time of acting this season’, while on 31 August 1708 the seasonal topicality of the play was heightened by performing it ‘with beadles, officers, and attendants belonging to the Powder Court’. The play was still beloved, but partly as a seasonal entertainment, rather like a Christmas show, and not solely for its own merits.\n\nThe sad final token of the play’s fall in esteem was its re-emergence, at fair time, in 1735, after a solitary revival in thirteen years, and advertised (not quite accurately) as ‘not acted these seven years’. It was given not, as for years past, at Drury Lane but at Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and in what must have been a severely revised form, since the list of characters included Ananias, Valentine, Rover, Silence, Toyman, Nut Woman, Florella, Loveit, and Pickleherring, as if Jonson’s original cast were not rich enough. Moreover, it was performed by a much less well-known team of actors than those who had held the stage so long. Several of them were to remain so little known that they can be identified solely by the plain surnames used in the advertisements. It cannot have been much of a success, as it was performed only the once. With this travesty, Bartholomew Fair disappeared from the stage for 186 years.\n\nUntil the early 1720s, the play had been acted by strong and consistent casts of leading actors. Time and again, John Littlewit was played by Henry Norris (1665-1731), ‘Jubilee Dicky’, one of London’s most popular comic actors, who, with his odd, squeaky voice, was especially noted for playing cuckolds, weak husbands, and fops such as Sir Politic Would-be and Osric, and was notorious for ad-libbing. John’s wife Win was taken by Margaret Saunders (1686-c. 1745), who also played Dol from The Alchemist and Lady Haughty. Mary Powell, who played Dame Purecraft, is recorded as an actress from 1686, but is not known to have taken the part after 1711; her name disappeared from the playbills after the 1713-14 season. It is unlikely that Quarlous was given a dynamic or charismatic performance at this time, as the part was taken by John Mills (at Drury Lane from 1695, d. 1736), a good utility actor in a great variety of roles, but inexpressive in voice and features. He was to be described by Cibber as ‘an honest, quiet, careful man, of as few faults as excellencies’. William Bullock (c. 1667-1742), who played Cokes until he left Drury Lane for the rival theatre at Lincoln’s Inn Fields in 1715 and was succeeded by Josias (or Joseph) Miller (1684-1738), was a more considerable actor and the patriarch of an acting family. By 1702 he was called ‘the best comedian that has trod the stage since Nokes’, and Steele in The Tatler wrote he was ‘a person of much wit and ingenuity’, with ‘a peculiar talent of looking like a fool’ (24 April 1709). Aptly for Cokes, he made much of being unusually tall. Wasp was played for decades by the dramatist’s namesake, Benjamin Johnson (1665-1742). Describing him as ‘our present Roscius’, Charles Gildon said that he acted Wasp with ‘such an engagement in the part that I could not persuade myself that it was acting but the reality’ (Life of Betterton, 1710). Theophilus Keene (1680-1718), a specialist in heavy, blunt parts such as Voltore and Casca, played Justice Overdo until he transferred to Lincoln’s Inn Fields in 1715, when he was succeeded by Charles Shepard (1675-1748), who was also to play Captain Otter, Lovewit, Mammon, and Falstaff. Ursula was always a male role at this time, and was usually played by Richard Cross (fl. c. 1695-1725), a utility actor who played secondary roles such as Polonius, suggesting that Ursula was not seen as the dominant figure she has been in some modern interpretations.\n\nOn the other hand, Busy was clearly seen as the role and was the only role to pass from star to star: John Bickerstaff (d. c. 1724), Colley Cibber (1671-1757), and George Pack (fl. 1700-24). Cibber, in particular, was the most important figure in the London theatre of the eighteenth century until the emergence of David Garrick, and was an outstanding performer of fops and other comic roles such Justice Shallow in 2 Henry 4. He became one of a triumvirate of actors who ran Drury Lane effectively for two decades. Bickerstaff, who took leading roles from about 1708, was another with a flair for comedy, though he also played more serious roles.\n\nWith helpers in the lesser roles and with occasional changes, this team performed the play until the early 1720s, apart from a disgruntled group — not large enough to weaken the company seriously — who left for the troupe at Lincoln’s Inn Fields in 1715. But by the 1720s Theophilus Keene was dead and others were reaching the end of their careers. When Bartholomew Fair was produced after a lapse of years in 1731, only Benjamin Johnson and Charles Shepard were still in the cast. There was a little further continuity in that Theophilus Cibber (1703-58), who played Cokes, was the son of Colley, and William Mills (1701-50) was following his father John in the part of Quarlous. But otherwise the cast was completely new to the play and seems to have performed it only once. Similarly, there is no continuity at all in the Lincoln’s Inn Fields Company who performed the free variation on the play in 1735. It may be that the dedication of the original team to Bartholomew Fair prolonged its stage career, and that the failure of their successors to build up a momentum in performing it hastened its departure. Moreover, Leo Hughes argues of the London theatre ‘that the mid-seventeen-twenties . . . represent a kind of watershed in taste. Two changes were rapidly taking place: first, a further flight from head to ears and eyes, the shift to eyes requiring only a year or two; second, a sharp increase in the number of theatre-goers’ (1971, 97, cited Jensen, 1985, 11). The abrupt fall from any popularity of Bartholomew Fair may well have reflected this suddenly enhanced preference, emphasised by an influx of inexperienced theatregoers, for variety entertainment over verbal and intellectual drama.\n\nThe play’s sudden loss of favour may well coincide — among all theatre-goers, sophisticated as well as inexperienced — with the growing adulation of Jonson’s ‘mighty opposite’, Shakespeare. As Jonathan Bate observes: ‘If we had to identify a single decade in which the \"cult of Shakespeare” took root, in which his celebrity and influence came to outstrip that of his contemporaries once and for all, it would probably be the 1730s’, when cheap editions proliferated and the plays came to make up a quarter of the entire repertoire of the London stage, twice what they had been (Bate and Rasmussen, 2007, 47).\n\nAs is apparent in Appendix 1, there was more consistency in the performers in the early years of the century than in their managements. The United Company formed in 1682 had split in 1694-5, when a co-operative of actors led by Thomas Betterton (1635-1710) — the greatest English actor between Burbage and Garrick — rebelled against the Drury Lane management in the unscrupulous hands of Christopher Rich, who had taken active control in 1693. The co-operative was granted a licence by the Lord Chamberlain to establish a new company at the second Lincoln’s Inn Fields Theatre. Rich was left with an enfeebled company, but this included some actors of great promise at the beginning of their careers such as Cibber, Johnson, and William Bullock, and despite the company’s discontent under Rich it steadily became more successful. Meanwhile the more experienced rebels struggled and squabbled in an inadequate theatre and the situation became so extreme that the Lord Chamberlain intervened and put the management in the hands of Betterton. But in 1704 the architect and playwright John Vanbrugh succeeded Betterton and proposed building a new Queen’s Theatre in Haymarket for the Lincoln’s Inn Fields troupe. The opening of this in April 1705 made the actors’ troupe a much more potent opposition, though the leading rebels were now reaching the end of their careers, while Rich’s Drury Lane company, the performers of Bartholomew Fair, were maturing into a very accomplished ensemble. In September 1706 Vanbrugh found himself forced into an uncomfortable compromise: he had to surrender what he most wanted, the right to perform opera and dance, in return for being allowed to hire nine of Drury Lane’s best actors. Rich was again left with an inadequate acting troupe, but now had the profitable rights to music and dance. So it came about that the performances of Bartholomew Fair in the 1706-7 season were by Vanbrugh’s company in Haymarket, though the leading members of the cast (who are first recorded in August 1707) had actually learned the play while performing at Drury Lane.\n\nBy the next season, however, the actors were back at Drury Lane. Rich’s singers there were in open mutiny by the autumn of 1707, and Vanbrugh began approaching them. On 31 December 1707 the Lord Chamberlain pronounced an ‘Order of Union’ which amalgamated the acting companies at Drury Lane under Rich and gave Vanbrugh the right he sought to perform opera at the Queen’s Theatre. But the opera singers demanded such inflated salaries that within months Vanbrugh had to hand over the management of Queen’s to Owen Swiney (1680-1754), an associate of Rich who was to turn against his mentor. Two or three years of complicated and heated manoeuvres followed and transformed the running of Drury Lane. Initially, three leading actors — Colley Cibber, Robert Wilks (c. 1665-1732), who was seen as Betterton’s successor in the great roles, and Richard Estcourt (1668-1712) — were brought in as co-managers, though under Rich’s tyrannical proprietorship. Then, with the Lord Chamberlain’s connivance, Rich was manoeuvred out of power. This involved the Lord Chamberlain in closing down Drury Lane because of Rich’s misdemeanours — hence the 1710 performance of Bartholomew Fair is back at Queen’s Theatre, under Swiney. Then in November 1710 the actors moved back into Drury Lane, now under the proprietorship of Swiney, with Wilks and Cibber joined as managers by the talented comic actor, Thomas Doggett (c. 1670?-1721). This at last made possible the relief of a sustained period of relative stability. Swiney was forced out in May 1711, and the addition of the actor Barton Booth (1679?-1733) to the managerial team in 1713-14 brought about the acrimonious departure of Doggett, and from then the Cibber/Wilks/Booth triumvirate ran the company at Drury Lane for some twenty years, with Bartholomew Fair performed many of these years before slipping out of the repertoire. Even the loss of several actors in 1714-15 to the new theatre in Lincoln’s Inn Fields — an initiative of the persistent Christopher Rich, though he died before the theatre opened — was not a serious disruption of these successful decades.\n\nIn the earlier years of the century, Bartholomew Fair remained high in critical esteem, and familiarity with the play could be taken for granted. In 1711, for example, Bernard Lintot published a handsome, posthumous collection of plays by George Farquhar, and the frontispiece shows Jonson, displaying a copy of Bartholomew Fair, formally presenting Farquhar to Apollo, god of the arts and leader of the Muses (Farquhar, 1988, 2.frontispiece). Writing in The Champion on 15 March 1740, Henry Fielding could say familiarly: ‘No character is oftener represented on the stage of the world than that of Justice Overdo in the Nest of Fools; men often become ridiculous or odious by over-acting even a laudable part’ (Fielding, ed. Coley, 2003, 233 — Fielding is running together Overdo and the discomfited justices Squelch and Bullfinch in The Northern Lass, or the Nest of Fools, c. 1629, by Jonson’s follower Brome). As performances faded further into the past, the play’s standing became less secure. Primarily because of the criticism of Shakespeare in the Induction, bardolatrous critics cited it as a prime instance of Jonson’s supposed jealousy of the greater dramatist. It was at best seen, in the words of David Erskine Baker in 1764, as having ‘an infinite deal of humour in it, and is, perhaps, the greatest assemblage of characters that ever was brought together within the compass of one single piece’ (Craig, 1990, 492). But even those more sympathetic saw it as dated and shapeless. For example, Dr John Brown (1715-66), who had written two tragedies staged by the great actor David Garrick and was used by him as a reader of new plays, wrote to him of the play in 1765: ‘Its comic merit, in point of character, is universally allowed to be of the first degree. In point of plan, it goes well upon the whole, till the third or fourth act, and then falls into nonsense and absurdity.’ Tantalisingly, he was writing to Garrick about a revision of the play by Brown himself in line with contemporary taste, removing the ‘nonsense and absurdity’ and ‘retaining, at the same time, every the least scrap of what is thinly scattered through the bad parts of it, such as might be worth preserving . . . The Pig-woman certainly cannot be removed without spoiling the whole; for on her depend all the fine comic scenes . . . In short, she is the great connecting circumstance that binds the whole together’ (Craig, 497). Shortly afterwards, he wrote again: ‘I pique myself more on rectifying this plan, than on any plan I ever struck out in my life. It is amazing to think how any writer could do so well, and so ill, at the same time, as Ben Jonson did in this comedy’ (Craig, 498). Unfortunately, nothing came of this revision (which is now lost); otherwise a version of Bartholomew Fair might have revived the play, at least for the few years until Garrick left the stage in 1776.\n\nThe Return to the Stage\n\nLeft without a performance by Garrick, Bartholomew Fair was doomed to remain off the stage for almost 200 years, until a revival by the deliberately named Phoenix Society in 1921, at a time when — as indicated by T. S. Eliot’s classic essay of 1919 — Jonson was at last beginning to be appreciated again. (There is a tantalising hint that a slightly earlier production may have been envisaged in a simple design for Bartholomew Fair by the noted illustrator and stage designer Claud Lovat Fraser (1890-1921). This survives in the collection of designs by himself and his wife and collaborator Grace Crawford Lovat Fraser at Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania ( www.brynmawr.edu/library/speccoll/guides/fraserart.shtml ), and was dated 1917 by Grace Crawford. The literary and theatrical connections of the young couple were extensive, but there is nothing to link this drawing with a particular project or with the Phoenix Society, although in 1923 the widow was to become an associate of the Society’s chief stage designer, Norman Wilkinson, in a firm designing theatre scenery and costumes.)\n\nDuring the Romantic and Victorian periods, many had found the play shocking — even some modern productions have bowdlerised its bawdy and sometimes sacrilegious language. Leigh Hunt, for example, thought it ‘full of the absolutest and sometimes loathsomest trash’ and an anonymous writer in Temple Bar in 1874 found it ‘infinitely coarser than the coarsest thing which Smollett ever wrote’ (cited Townsend, 1947a, 11-12). A more intelligent critic than either, William Hazlitt, was not shocked, but even he was patronizing, since for him it was ‘chiefly remarkable for the exhibition of odd humours and tumbler’s tricks, and is on that account amusing to read once’ (Lectures on the Comic Writers, in Complete Works, 1930-34, 6.45). Lamb’s revelatory Specimens of English Dramatic Poets who Lived about the Time of Shakespeare (1808) found nothing in the play worth reproducing, while Gifford’s pugnacious edition was unlikely to win the playwright many friends. Charles Dickens, a Jonsonian humorist in some of his work, was exceptional in his enjoyment of certain of the plays. Mr Stiggins of the pineapple rum and hot buttered toast, deputy shepherd of the United Grand Junction Ebenezer Temperance Association in Pickwick Papers, is in part a descendant of Zeal-of-the-land Busy, while among the items sold after Dickens’s death was a large collection of books, drawings, and ephemera relating to the actual Bartholomew Fair, as if the novelist had planned a work around it (Dutton, 1979, 231-2).\n\nItems at that sale included no fewer than three copies of Henry Morley’s Memoirs of Bartholomew Fair (1859), and it is this first detailed study of any English fair that helped to make appreciation of the play possible again, by locating it within an event that for some 700 years was a major presence in English life, so that it could be seen as in many ways realistic, not a gratuitous wallowing in filth and corruption. Intelligent modern appreciation emerges with A Study of Ben Jonson by the poet Swinburne (1889), where the critique is summed up in a sentence majestic in its contradictions:\n\nWhen all is said that can reasonably be said against the too accurate reproduction and the too voluminous exposition of vulgar and vicious nature in this enormous and multitudinous pageant — too serious in its satire and too various in its movement for a farce, too farcical in its incidents and too violent in its horseplay for a comedy — the delightful humour of its finer scenes, the wonderful vigour and veracity of the whole, the unsurpassed ingenuity and dexterity of the composition, the energy, harmony and versatility of the action, must be admitted to ensure its place for ever among the minor and coarser masterpieces of comic art.\n\n(61-2)\n\nSwinburne remains enough within the shadow of nineteenth-century criticism to find Bartholomew Fair ‘minor’ and ‘coarse’ in its relentless vulgar realism, yet his language is energized by the vigour, the ingenuity, and indeed the harmony to which he is responding in the work. His intuition that the satirical comedy is too serious for farce and too farcical for comedy anticipates the division of responses that runs through modern critiques of the play and that the present edition sees as essential to its enigmatic meaning. (For more extended accounts of nineteenth-century awareness of the play, see Townsend, 1947a, Jensen, 1985, and Teague, 1985.)\n\nSwinburne’s study was a forerunner of the revival of an historicist approach to Shakespeare and a revaluation of his contemporaries that led to William Poël’s founding of the Elizabethan Stage Society in 1895 and eventually to the restoration of Bartholomew Fair to the stage, among many plays of the period. Poël’s performances of Renaissance plays were to be profoundly influential for decades to come in their experiments with what he took to be authentic style. The acting was ensemble rather than star-centred; scenery was reduced to a minimum; the stage was modelled upon his understanding of the Elizabethan stage, encouraging intimacy with the audience and freeing the plays from the cumbersome elaborations of the commercial theatre of the day. These productions were an early inspiration to Harley Granville-Barker, actor, director, playwright, and great Shakespearean critic, in founding the Incorporated Stage Society in 1899 to perform plays of artistic merit then seen as uncommercial. Performances were usually by professional actors in West End theatres, although confined to Sunday evenings. The Phoenix Society was in turn founded in 1919 under the auspices of the Stage Society specifically to perform plays by early English dramatists. It was led by one of its four founders, Allan Wade (the bibliographer of W. B. Yeats and first editor of the poet’s letters), secretary of the Stage Society in 1912-16 and an actor who had been secretary, assistant, and then close associate of Granville-Barker since 1906. In its years of existence up to 1925, the Society put on twenty-six semi-private productions, all but two of them directed by Wade and most of them to designs by Norman Wilkinson, who had become prominent through designing Granville-Barker’s acclaimed and pioneering Shakespeare productions at the Savoy. The Phoenix performances were enthusiastically supported by established actors and made a valued contribution to the theatrical avant-garde’s reassessment of Renaissance drama. Several of the revived plays successfully entered the repertory of the public stage.\n\nThis was not, however, the outcome of its production of Bartholomew Fair, which took place — as its eighth production, five months after its revival of Volpone — at the New Theatre, Oxford, on 26-7 June 1921, a Sunday evening and a Monday matinée, the first known performances of the play since the 1730s. This was a scholarly production — the programme included a long note by Montague Summers and reprinted the title page from F2 — and it can be assumed to have been more than competent, because prepared by the experienced Wade and Wilkinson for a cast including a leading actor of the day, Frank Cellier, as Justice Overdo and several other professionals well established in roles of middling importance, such as Margaret Yarde, Ben Field, Tristan Rawson, Ernest Thesiger, Clare Harris, Henry Kiell Ayliff, Edward Combermere, and Roy Byford (full details of this and subsequent modern productions are listed in Appendix 3 below). The best-informed commentators on the production thought ‘the general level of the acting was high’, although ‘there was a certain heaviness of movement, due perhaps to the episodic treatment of the characters’ (H&S, 2.249).\n\nUnsurprisingly, however, the press reviews show that the play seemed too outlandish to be appreciated. There was no lack of praise for individual performances, notably for Byford cross-dressed as Ursula, Thesiger as Cokes, and Field as Busy, and, since many later interpretations would omit the induction, it is interesting that ‘Tarn’ in The Spectator for 2 July 1921 found this (with Wade himself as the Scrivener) highly effective. Paradoxically, however, the characters were seen as ‘merely personified eccentricities, and they behave so irrationally that we do not care a straw what becomes of any of them’ (The Times, 28 June 1921). The play itself was found to be, at most, of historical interest: ‘We were very glad, exceeding glad, very exceeding glad, when the play was over. We speak of it, of course, as an entertainment. As a \"document” Bartholomew Fair is full of interest’ (The Times). Even the most positive review, in The Daily Telegraph, thought ‘the action so overlaid with detail as to make it difficult to see the wood for the trees’ and saw the play as ‘a relic of the past’, appealing to curiosity rather than the emotions (28 June 1921), while less sympathetic reviewers openly patronized its ‘primitive humour’ (H. G. in The Observer, 3 July).\n\nEven the most intelligent discussion, by Desmond MacCarthy, who had prepared himself by reading Swinburne, is at sea with the play: ‘Nothing can be so tiresome as a man in towering spirits and of inexhaustible vitality. One gets sick of the perpetual exhibition of vulgarity, idiocy and viciousness, though there is so much energy and force in many a line and speech that if one’s stomach had not turned queasy one would adm"
