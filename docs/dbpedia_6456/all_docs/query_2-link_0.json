        "meta_description": "Youth's Endearing Charm: Directed by William C. Dowlan. With Mary Miles Minter, Wallace MacDonald, Harry von Meter, Gertrude Le Brandt. Orphan Mary Wade is the ward of a family of farmers who keep her busy with drudgery. When Mr. Jenkins, the head of the household, makes advances to Mary, she flees to the city with her dog Zippy and lands in court for imitating a beggar who pretends to be blind. Harry Disbrow, a young millionaire in court for drunkenness, takes Mary home to his family, who take her in as a servant. Mr. Disbrow, a trust officer, has a partner, Horton, who has been stealing from the firm and who wishes to have his daughter Maud marry Harry to minimize the consequences of his crimes. Desperate to shore up his business, Disbrow demands that Horton reveal the whereabouts of certain securities, which fall out of Horton's pocket during the course of the confrontation. The struggle between the two men is resolved when Mary crashes a vase over Horton's head. Taken to the heart of the Disbrow family, Mary wins Harry's affections as well.",
