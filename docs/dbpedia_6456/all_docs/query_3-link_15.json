When Gladys Saunders, fresh from college, inherits the spa, Clarence makes romantic overtures, but she turns him down, even though her late father had assumed that she and Clarence would someday marry. When Gladys becomes interested in Dr. Sherwood, a visitor to the spa, Clarence threatens to confess to medicating the waters, and thereby ruin Gladys' business, if she continues her relationship with the doctor. However, Sherwood, who has overhead all this, tells Gladys that he can cure the spa's patients without drugs, through diet and exercise, and succeeds spectacularly with his new regimen, which defuses Clarence's threat and allows them to proceed with their romance without him.",
