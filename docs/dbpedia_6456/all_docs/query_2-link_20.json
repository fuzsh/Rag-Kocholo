        "text": "Odes Of Anacreon - Ode LXI.\n\nBy Thomas Moore\n\n[1]\n\nYouth's endearing charms are fled;\n\nHoary locks deform my head;\n\nBloomy graces, dalliance gay,\n\nAll the flowers of life decay.[2]\n\nWithering age begins to trace\n\nSad memorials o'er my face;\n\nTime has shed its sweetest bloom\n\nAll the future must be gloom.\n\nThis it is that sets me sighing;\n\nDreary is the thought of dying![3]\n\nLone and dismal is the road,\n\nDown to Pluto's dark abode;\n\nAnd, when once the journey's o'er,\n\nAh! we can return no more!\n\nExtra Info:\n\n[1] The intrusion of this melancholy ode, among the careless levities of our poet, reminds us of the skeletons which the Egyptians used to hang up in the banquet-rooms, to inculcate a thought of mortality even amidst the dissipations of mirth. If it were not for the beauty of its numbers, the Teian Muse should disown this ode.\n\n[2] Horace often, with feeling and elegance, deplores the fugacity of human enjoyments.\n\n[3] Regnier, a libertine French poet, has written some sonnets on the approach of death, full of gloomy and trembling repentance. Chaulieu, however, supports more consistently the spirit of the Epicurean philosopher. See his poem, addressed to the Marquis de Lafare."
