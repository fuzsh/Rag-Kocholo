        "text": "Michael Douglas has built a lucrative career out of being the sultan of sleaze. From “Fatal Attraction” to “Wonder Boys” and “Wall Street,” he’s taken us deep inside the minds of selfish, narcissistic men like few other actors, including Al Pacino.\n\nThere is, however, the possibility of too much of a good thing, and with “Solitary Man” this week and the much ballyhooed “Wall Street” sequel in September, Douglas would seem to be approaching that threshold.\n\nDon’t get me wrong; I love to watch the man dive into these misanthropic roles with zero regard to image or career trajectory. And I’m continually amazed by how he manages to attract empathy for heartless slugs like Gordon Gekko and Grady Tripp. But I’m beginning to experience too many moments of déjà vu in pictures like “Solitary Man,” in which he plays a hybrid of those “Wall Street” and “Wonder Boy” characters in Ben Kalmen.\n\nWhen we first meet Big Ben, he seems to have hit rock bottom after losing both his wife (a terrific Susan Sarandon) and his Ernie Boch-like car dealership empire to his propensity for fooling around with the books and other women. But the downward spiral of shame and disgrace has only just begun.\n\nSome might accuse writer-co-director Brian Koppelman (“Rounders,” “Oceans 13”) of piling on, and they’d be right. Too much seems to be happening to one man at one time to be believed. His daughter (Jenna Fischer) has barred him from seeing his grandson; his latest lover (Mary-Louise Parker) has dumped him for (shades of Woody Allen) hitting on her teenage daughter (Imogen Poots); and his attempts at a professional comeback are thwarted by one of the many people he wronged along the way.\n\nJust one of these indignities would be enough to sustain any movie, but the lot of them makes “Solitary Man” feel contrived and overstuffed.\n\nYou go along with it, though, simply because Douglas wills it with charisma and shaggy-dog charm. Not only does he establish a fascinating love-hate relationship with the audience, he also makes you marvel at how easy the character comes to him. He never breaks a sweat. But you do.\n\nAnd the source of that perspiration is the discomfort you feel in watching a smart talented man like Ben so willfully embarrass himself socially and professionally just to feed his enormous ego.\n\nPredictably, comeuppance is in the offing, but thankfully it’s not as obvious and sappy as you’d expect. In many ways the movie and Douglas’ performance reminded me of Jack Lemmon’s Oscar-winning turn as a tortured, self-inflicted failure in “Save the Tiger.”\n\nAnd like that fine film, “Solitary Man” possesses little in the way of plot, opting for a straight character study that unfolds slowly through revealing conversations Ben has with his fed-up daughter; flustered ex-wife; his latest – and youngest – sexual conquest; an impressionable college nerd (Jesse Eisenberg); and most intriguingly, his best friend, a hash-slinging diner proprietor played by Douglas’ real-life pal, Danny DeVito.\n\nIt’s the first time they’ve been together in a film since “War of the Roses” (in which Douglas played yet another hall-of-fame sleazeball), and it’s something to see. It’s also a grand reminder of what a terrific dramatic actor DeVito can be when he puts his mind to it.\n\nNot surprisingly, their scenes together are the best things Koppelman and his co-director, David Levein, have going for them, as the two actors summon the few genuine moments the movie has to offer.\n\nThey’re also the scenes when Douglas’ Ben seems most vulnerable and lovable. And it’s in these revealing moments that we begin to understand just what it is that makes Ben tick, and why he feels the need to feed on folks with youth, beauty and success like a horny, undernourished vampire.\n\nBut that’s only a small portion of a movie that is less interested in examining the onset of age and irrelevancy than it is in salaciously tossing Douglas into the sack with a gorgeous teenage girl.\n\nIf it was Koppelman’s goal to make his audience squirm during such moments, he can consider his mission accomplished. But if, instead, he wanted to take us deep into the head of a man in the throes of a midlife crisis, “Solitary Man” comes up a tad short.\n\nNormally that would be a killer, but when you have Douglas onboard acting at the top of his game, it’s more of a nuisance than a liability. Still, one wonders how many more of these nasty characters Douglas can play before he starts becoming a parody of himself.\n\nAl Alexander may be reached at aalexander@ledger.com."
