        "text": "A 1808 song about the power of enduring love.\n\nwords by Thomas Moore\n\nthe melody is a traditional Irish air\n\narranged by Sir John Andrew Stevenson\n\nThe melody is much older and would have been familiar to Irish poet Mr. Moore. A lady’s loss of charms may have been due to scars left by smallpox. First published in London in 1808, it was a song hit in the U.S. by 1810. This is a 1823 printing.\n\nThe sheet music:\n\nAccompaniment track:\n\nLyrics\n\nBelieve me if all those endearing young charms\n\nWhich I gaze on so fondly today\n\nWere to change by tomorrow and fleet in my arms\n\nLike fairy gifts fading away\n\nThou would’st still be adored as this moment thou art\n\nLet thy loveliness fade as it will\n\nAnd around the dear ruin, each wish of my heart\n\nWould entwine itself verdantly still\n\nIt is not while beauty and youth are thine own\n\nAnd thy cheek unprofaned by a tear\n\nThat the fervour and faith of a soul can be known\n\nTo which time will but make thee more dear\n\nOh! the heart that has truly loved never forgets\n\nBut as truly loves on to the close\n\nAs the sunflower turns on her god, when he sets\n\nThe same look which she turned when he rose\n\nSung here by Fred Feild:"
