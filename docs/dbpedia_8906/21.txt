Braceface was an animated television show that aired on TeleToon from 2001 to 2006. The show starred Alicia Silverstone as the voice of Sharon Spitz, a teenage girl navigating the ups and downs of adolescence while wearing braces. Stacey DePass also provided voiceover work for the show, portraying several characters throughout its run.

The show's plot centers around Sharon Spitz, a smart and vivacious teenager balancing the challenges of high school with the added difficulty of wearing braces. Along with her best friends Maria Wong and Connor MacKenzie, Sharon navigates the awkwardness of adolescence and the sometimes-turbulent waters of young love.

Despite the show's focus on Sharon's orthodontic treatment, Braceface is much more than a show about braces. It tackles a variety of issues facing teenagers today, including peer pressure, relationships, and self-image. Throughout the series, Sharon deals with many of these issues and learns important life lessons, all while maintaining her signature wit and charm.

One of the show's strengths is its relatability to its target audience: pre-teens and young teenagers. Sharon and her friends go through many things that most young people experience, such as school dances, crushes, and academic pressures. The show's writers do an excellent job of depicting these moments in a way that will resonate with the audience and provide insight into the difficulties of growing up.

In addition to its relatable characters and storylines, Braceface is also notable for its humor. The show features many comedic moments that are sure to make the audience laugh out loud. With its witty writing and excellent voice acting from the show's talented cast, it's no wonder that Braceface was so popular during its run.

Another strength of the show is its diversity. The characters come from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, including Chinese, Jamaican, and Scottish. This diversity is not just for show; the cultural differences between the characters are often brought up in the show's dialogue, providing insight into different ways of life and ways of thinking.

Overall, Braceface is an excellent show for pre-teens and young teenagers who are trying to navigate the complexities of adolescence. With relatable characters, insightful storylines, and plenty of humor, it's easy to see why this show was so popular during its run on TeleToon.

Braceface is a series that is currently running and has 6 seasons (115 episodes). The series first aired on June 2, 2001.
