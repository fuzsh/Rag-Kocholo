        "text": "Do you have a favorite Mission: Impossible entry? I love the original TV series (1966-1973), particularly the early seasons starring Barbara Bain and Martin Landau, and I can remember a few standout plotlines from the 1980s revival TV series. For the more recent movie series, I definitely have a soft spot for the first Mission: Impossible movie from 1996 (“Red light! Green light!”). But my top favorite of the Misson: Impossible film series has to be the fourth entry, 2011’s Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.\n\nReasons to love Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol\n\nThere are many reasons to love Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol — sharp writing, swift pacing, top-notch acting, Tom Cruise doing what he does best (running onscreen). Beyond that, a major personal reason why I love this film is the fact that I was actually living in the UAE when they were filming the Dubai scenes for this movie. I’m talking about the iconic scenes in which Tom Cruise scales the Burj Khalifa, then, and still currently, the tallest structure in the world. It was a HUGE news story in the UAE at the time, especially because the Burj Khalifa had only officially opened in Jan. 2010, just a few months before filming began (Sept. 2010, lasting through Mar. 2011). And it’s still a huge story; this Screen Rant article, most recently updated in 2024, breaks down the scene, calling it “a cinema landmark” and “a defining moment for the franchise.” For me, it’s extra fun to rewatch the movie and recognize sites and buildings that I’ve actually been to and lived amongst; the personal nostalgia factor is strong.\n\nThis movie also had its world premiere in Dubai on Dec. 7, 2011, two weeks before it premiered in the U.S. The Burj Khalifa was also highlighted in all the movie’s promotions and posters, and in the first trailer (and thumbnail!), as well:\n\nLearning about the archives mission\n\nMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is very rewatchable. But upon rewatching it myself recently, what I had NOT remembered was that there was an archives scene! Let’s revisit that scene, shall we?\n\nAfter the gloriously entertaining opening scene in which Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is extracted from a Moscow prison with the help of agents Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Jane Carter (Paula Patton), Ethan gets a new mission via an old phone booth.\n\nAt 18 minutes into the movie, we learn that the new mission involves breaking into a “secured archive inside the Kremlin” — complete with blueprints! — in order to learn the identity of “Cobalt,” a man who has stolen nuclear launch codes:\n\nCobalt is or was a level 1 nuclear strategist for Russian intelligence. Therefore the only way to uncover his actual identity is to infiltrate the Kremlin itself. In order to get past their checkpoints, you will be impersonating General Anatoly Fedorov. We believe Cobalt will do everything he can to destroy any record of his identity. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to penetrate the highly secured archive inside the Kremlin, and retrieve Cobalt’s file before he can destroy it. New Intel suggests Cobalt is already en route, leaving you 4 hours, 52 mins to infiltrate.\n\nIn less than a minute, we learn that the Mission Directive is to “Infiltrate the Kremlin Archive Room” and “Acquire the Dossier.” The blueprints show the path to the “highly secured archive,” and we learn that the Archive Room is located on the lower level, Zone 14E, Room 1124.\n\nCarrying out the archives mission\n\nAt 27.5 minutes into the movie, Ethan and Benji have successfully infiltrated the Kremlin and made their way to the lower level. There is a security guard stationed at the end of the hallway where the Archive Room is located.\n\nEthan enters the Archive Room, which has a door sign in Russian. I used Google Translate to ascertain that the door sign reads: “Archive 36B.” I’m thrilled that the word “Archive” is on the door sign, but I am confused by the “36B.” That doesn’t match up with the info Ethan had gotten before, that the Archive Room was located in Zone 14E, Room 1124.\n\nAnyway… after Ethan enters the darkened space, he pans a flashlight around, and we get to see the details of the room, which is full of filing cabinets and stacks of various archival boxes. It looks pretty organized, with wall signs and a lot of labels on the filing cabinets and boxes.\n\nClick on any image in the gallery below to view in a larger window.\n\nEthan immediately starts scanning the filing cabinet labels in order to narrow down to the files he needs. He quickly locates the drawer he needs, and we are treated to a drawer full of bright yellow microfilm boxes. He pulls out 3 boxes, but upon inspecting them, finds the microfilm spools empty!\n\nClick on any image in the gallery below to view in a larger window.\n\nAt this point, the voice of Cobalt (played by well-known Swedish actor Michael Nyqvist, who sadly passed away in 2017) booms out over the radio frequency:\n\nCheck in, team leader. Over. Repeat, check in, team leader. Have you made it to the Archive Room? … Team leader, awaiting your go-sign. Standing by to detonate.\n\nEthan and Benji immediately realize that this is a trap (“Someone is piggybacking our frequency”), as this frequency is picked up within the Kremlin. We see the Russians guards spring into action, shouting out:\n\nCaptain! The Archive Room!\n\nThe team is forced to abort the mission!\n\nThe archives scene lasts a little under two minutes total, and this is is the last we see of the Kremlin Archive Room:\n\nArchives filming location\n\nWith this film being famous for using real locations like the Burj Khalifa — yes, that was really Tom Cruise dangling off the world’s tallest building! — I wondered if they had managed to get permission to film in the Kremlin, or at least somewhere else in Russia. Alas, no! The IMDb.com Filming & Production page lists Prague Castle in Prague, the capital city of the Czech Republic, as the location used for the Kremlin inner courtyard and interiors.\n\nAnd while looking this up, I also learned that there is a real Archives of the Prague Castle! The collection began in 1920, and you can read more about the History of the Archives here on the main Archives website. There is an old photograph on this page that shows the rounded arches of the Archives — which look VERY similar to the rounded arches in the Archive Room scene in the movie. If the archive room interiors weren’t filmed in the real Prague Castle Archives space, then they did a good job to replicate that architectural detail.\n\nGetting the details right\n\nI also appreciated some other details this movie got right. First, there are lots of signs and labels in the Archive Room, with some kind of a classification numbering system, which Ethan used to locate the files that were essential to the mission. And they didn’t make a big show of it in this short scene. I love the low-key way they demonstrate that these archives are efficiently organized, that Ethan is able to immediately use the classification labels, and therefore is able to easily locate what he’s looking for. That’s the point of classification systems, to help you locate the info or resources you need!\n\nCompare that to the time I ranted about the KGB Archives scene in the otherwise-excellent What If…? animated series. In episode 8, “What If… Ultron Won?,” Natasha and Hawkeye break into the KGB Archives and have this exchange:\n\nHawkeye: So, where do we start?\n\nNatasha: Just pick a box.\n\nYou can read more about my rant here and why that scene is so infuriating in this post, ‘What if’ we explored the multiverse of research…? | Library, archives + reel librarian scenes in ‘What If…?’ Season 1 (2021).\n\nBack to the impossible mission at hand, I also appreciated the closeup of microfilm spools! A lot of movies and TV series mix up microfilm and microfiche — which are two different types of microforms — but this movie got it right. You can read more into my mini-lecture on microforms here in this post analyzing A Winter’s Tale (spoiler: A Winter’s Tale got it wrong!), but here’s an easy way to remember the difference: microfilm come in spools, and microfiche are flat sheets. And I love love love that standard-size microfilm spools make an appearance in a spy movie! Archival collections and “old-school” technology like microforms are still useful in our modern world. ❤\n\nUltimately, this short archives-centric scene lands in the Class V category of films that feature library or archives scenes, but with no librarians or archivists present. It is admittedly a bit disappointing that this is yet another example of an archives room seen onscreen with no sense of a professional who organizes or maintains it, although these archives are clearly valuable enough to employ a security guard! (See additional, recent examples of this type of archives scene without archivists in Captain Marvel, What If…?, and Soul.)\n\nHowever, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol does shine a spotlight on an interesting archives collection… which did, in fact, turn out to be a mission: impossible! 😉\n\nWhat is your favorite Mission: Impossible movie or series? Did you remember this archives scene in this movie? Please leave a comment and share!\n\nSources used"
