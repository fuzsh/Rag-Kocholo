        "text": "Cancellation Policy\n\nPlease remember that we are moving your order forward as quickly as we can to ensure it leaves our facility within our production schedule.\n\nYou are ordering custom product.No cards are pulled from a shelf. Regardless of an order’s need for a proof, EACH card is created to your specifications when you place your order and is printed inside our facility. Due to the nature of our business, the speed at which orders must be processed, the effect your cancellation has on other customers, and the cost and labor it takes to manage a cancelled order, a cancellation at any time will result in a cancellation fee.\n\nIf you feel you have made an error on your order please call and we will assist in correcting the order without a need to reorder or cancel the existing order. If you need to increase or decrease quantity, or alter your order in anyway, please contact us as soon as you recognize this need. We will do our best to accommodate that request.\n\nThe cancellation fee is determined by the progress made to your order when the cancellation is requested, along with any fees charged, that are nonrefundable.\n\nSAME DAY: Orders cancelled within the same day (where no proof/signature sheet has been generated) will be charged a flat $10 fee plus any credit card fees incurred, with all other order charges being refunded in full.\n\nAFTER PROOFS: Orders that have received proofs will incur a minimum charge of $30. This fee helps offset the labor cost of creating your proof. A cancellation after several rounds of proofs will result in a charge of no less than $60.\n\nPREPRINTED SIGNATURES: The $50 signature fee is nonrefundable. Whether you change your mind, run out of time, or didn’t mean to select “yes” your $50 fee remains so please ask any questions you need answered, before placing your order.\n\nIN PRODUCTION: Orders cancelled after they reach production (after approval of proof, signatures have been received - or when no proof is required) will be assessed fees depending on how far through production the order has gone.\n\nReturn Policy\n\nWe understand that you purchase greeting cards as a gift for clients, vendors and staff. We know too, that you select industry specific greeting cards to act as a marketing tool for your business. At Industry Greetings we always want our cards to make a great impression for you and your organization. If you receive your card order and find a defect in the product or if we have made an error with your order or personalization, we will replace it or refund your order without issue. Please contact us immediately and keep all packaging as your original product will need to be returned for replacement product to be shipped.\n\nWe suggest you open your card order upon receipt to ensure everything meets your satisfaction. Although you may return your order anytime during the same calendar year recognize that it benefits you to know as quickly as you can that your order is perfect and ready to send out when you are ready to tackle that project.\n\nPlease do understand that while we review orders for accuracy to the best of our ability, we may not recognize incorrect spelling of names, companies or locations. We don’t know if you’ve omitted something or used the wrong zip code. We therefore may miss mistakes you made during your ordering process. We strongly suggest reviewing all pertinent information prior to submitting your order, again, when you receive your order confirmation and also, during the proofing stage should your order be one that receives a proof.\n\nOwnership & Use Policy\n\nYou are purchasing a set number of printed greeting cards only. You are not purchasing art or any rights to reproduce the card or other images. All card images are copyrighted and solely owned by House of Cards (a dba of ON-PRESS Printing Services Inc.). Although we appreciate your interest, use of our art (with or without your company branding) whether in print or digitally, including but not limited to, social media pages, personal websites, blogs, emails and newsletters, is strictly prohibited.\n\nWe reserve the right to cancel blank, small quantity orders without administrative approval due to copyright concerns. Any copyright infringement will be pursued to the fullest extent of the law.\n\nSubmission & Copyright Policy\n\nWhen you submit information, logos, images or other material product whether through our website, email, in person, by fax or mail you represent and warrant that you possess any necessary rights, ownership and authority with respect to your Submission and that your Submission does not and will not infringe upon, or in any way, violate any intellectual property or proprietary rights of another. You further warrant that any identifiable person in any photograph/image provided for placement on or in greeting cards has provided consent and/ or permission as to the use of said image.\n\nWe reserve the right to request evidence of authority or ownership, written consent or other information as we deem necessary and sufficient.\n\nProduction Procedure\n\nYour order is created and produced specifically for you - it is not pulled (stock) from a shelf. Even cards ordered blank inside are created as ordered. Items without pre-printed signatures, image alteration or a logo generally ship within roughly 5-7 business days. This time frame may vary - lengthening during the months of October through December. Altering the face of cards, adding logos and/or preprinted signatures typically adds 2-5 business days to your order production. We encourage you to call for a current production schedule if you have any concerns.\n\nProofing Procedure\n\nProofs are created for orders that include custom greetings, logos or other card alterations when ordered within the Classic Order Method. Depending on the time of year that your order is placed, proofs will typically increase the production time of your order an additional 2-5 business days. Orders will generally not move forward into production until we receive a proof approval. Should your order be awaiting approval for an extended period, or near the Christmas holiday, we may move your order forward without approval, with the understanding that no order change request indicates acceptance as proofed. Should your order be one that requires a proof and you do not see a proof within 5 days you should contact us immediately as there is likely an issue. To reduce the likelihood of lost or missing proofs, please add our customerservice@industrygreetings.com email to a safe list so emails from Industry Greetings with proof / signature sheet attachments land safely in your inbox rather than fall to spam/junk folders or are deleted entirely from your email server.\n\nProofs are not created for orders placed within the Classic Order Method with only a standard greeting with or without personalization and/or envelope imprints. All entered text should be reviewed carefully in the preview, in the cart, and again upon receipt of your order confirmation. This text will print as you have typed it and as you see it on your receipt. Contact us immediately for any needed changes.\n\nProofs are also not created for orders placed within the Designer Order Method as you are creating, designing and approving your own design online prior to completing your order. Check all work before adding your card to cart as you are no longer able to view your design once approved. Should you wish to have the designs you approve we suggest taking screen shots of each panel (front, inside card top half, inside card bottom half, envelope) prior to clicking the “add to cart” button for your records.\n\nShipping Procedure"
