        "text": "Lifetime Movies employs a wide range of actors - most of which you will recognize from more than just TV movies. Lifetime actresses and actors have been in everything from current blockbuster films to your favorite '80s and '90s movies, while also adding a Lifetime movie or two to their filmography.\n\nThis list of Lifetime actors is ordered by how many Lifetime original movies and Lifetime Movie Network films each actor has been in. Actors like Megan Park, Colin Ferguson, Wendy Crewson, and Rick Roberts are regular Lifetime movie actors and actresses, working in multiple films over the years. Even actors such as Colin Firth, Dean Cain, and Caroline Rhea have been in multiple movies from Lifetime. Marcia Gay Harden was in her first Lifetime movie, Labor of Love, in 1998 and has regularly been in Lifetime movies since - including a 2011 film about Amanda Knox that also has Hayden Panettiere in the cast.\n\nBigger stars who have been in only one Lifetime Movies or LMN film include Laura Dern, Meghan Markle, Tiffany Haddish, Rob Lowe, Method Man, Stanley Tucci, and Mark Ruffalo. It's surprising what other big names have shown up in a Lifetime movie that is seasonal, romantic, or based on a true story."
