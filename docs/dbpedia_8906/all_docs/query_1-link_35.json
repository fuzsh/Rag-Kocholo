        "text": "If there is one Nicktoon that I would label the biggest Butt Monkey of them all, it would undeniably be Pelswick, which celebrates the 16th anniversary of its CBC premiere this week (yeah, the show actually premiered in America on October 24, not the 5th). For those who aren’t familiar with this show (and I wouldn’t blame you if you aren’t), Pelswick was a Nicktoon produced by our good friends in Canada, Nelvana Studios. Based on the comics by the late paraplegic cartoonist John Callahan, it basically followed the anti-climatic life of a pubescent boy named Pelswick Eggert, who sits on a wheelchair for reasons that were never explained based on my research. The “hook” to the show’s premise that tries to make it less mundane is Pelswick having a goofy guardian angel voiced by Courteney Cox’s ex-husband, David Arquette. Unfortunately, it wasn’t enough to save the show from being a mediocre cartoon that is essentially Doug on a wheelchair. I know Doug itself was never among the most intriguing of the Nicktoons, but at least without it, we might not have greater slice-of-life shows such as Hey Arnold! or Arthur,. With Pelswick on the other hand, it was blatantly trying and failing to imitate the granddaddy of all Nicktoons. I swear, the bully in Pelswick, Boyd, is a poor man’s copy of Roger Klotz. Regardless of how bland the show is, I kinda feel sorry for it. Like As Told by Ginger, another neglected Nicktoon which debuted around the same time, one would argue that this show was ahead of its time. First off, how many other cartoons could you think of that has a disabled protagonist? I understand what John Callahan and the other people behind the show were getting across, but they just didn’t execute it in a very appealing way. Let TV Tropes explain:\n\nPelswick was unable to gain much of an audience due to taking too many risks at once. It had a paraplegic protagonist, which is a pretty big risk by itself, unfortunately, especially since it made the bold choice to have it not define his entire character. Then it was set in a Fantastic Comedy (the protagonist receives advice from a guardian angel only he can see), and some of the people who liked the reality aspect found the fantasy aspect confusing to the point they couldn’t enjoy it, as well as having an unconventional art style which some people find off-putting in and of itself. For good measure, the show employed mature humor about political correctness and then aimed the series at kids, complete with a far-from-subtle Aesop structure that older people were turned off by. All of this resulted in being cancelled after 26 episodes and not released on DVD with a handful of fans (Funimation wanting to focus more on My Dad the Rock Star certainly didn’t help matters).\n\n– Audience-Alienating Premise page\n\nYeah, about the art style, it’s…so-so to say the least. Granted, Mr. Callahan had no choice but to draw while holding the pencil with both hands. Then again, it shouldn’t excuse him completely. He could have told the Nelvana artists to refine his sketches to make them cuter. Well, maybe his crude art style was left intact as part of executing his message about disability.\n\nBottom-line, Pelswick might not be very exciting, based on the few episodes I’ve seen, but I have enough respect for its attempt to be revolutionary to give it a spot on my top 25 favorite Nicktoons list. Also, I currently prefer Pelswick over John’s other show, Quads, which is edgier, nastier, more faithful to his own dysfunctional life, and served as my introduction to his style when I was younger. But remember: opinions are likely to change.\n\nNow for the main meat of this article regarding this show. Pelswick, of all early 2000s Nicktoons, has been announced to air on TeenNick’s late-night nostalgia block, The Splat, this month. This blew me away when I found out this is true. I thought it was impossible to happen anytime soon, because, even though Nickelodeon treated the show as an official Nicktoon during its run, they seemed to drop its existence down the trash can like a dirty diaper after 2005. They even neglected to include it in the heavy 2007 book, Not Just Cartoons: Nicktoons!, despite including another Nelvana series, Wayside, which was brand-new at the time (so Nick had the rights to it at that point). Then again, the reasons as to why Nick seems to hate Pelswick are understandable, as mentioned above. Also, unlike most of the other Nicktoons ever deemed as “official”, this show has its rights reserved to Nelvana Limited. In general, this whole Pelswick thing is bloody divisive. Regardless, though, this is more proof of how awesome The Splat is compared to its predecessor, The ’90s Are All That. Not only did they please me for giving As Told by Ginger some well-deserved love, but they’re even! Going! To! Air! KABLAM!!!! Proof:\n\nIn general, 2016 really is a redeemable year for Nickelodeon, isn’t it? Not only did we get The Loud House, a show that managed to become even more popular than SpongeBob (at least in ratings), but we were also treated to countless amazing occurrences done to celebrate the Nicktoons’ 25th anniversary. This includes giving acknowledgement to such obscure Nicktoons as Catscratch, Tak and the Power of Juju, and of course, KaBlam!.\n\nBack onto Doug–I mean Pelswick, how does this decision to air it on The Splat make Nickelodeon a bunch of hypocrites? Back in June, when Nick Animation uploaded the As Told by Ginger intro on YouTube (which, of course, I was ecstatic about), a user named [thomasandmario7] asked in the comments section if they could upload Pelswick‘s intro. Nick answered:\n\nNo, it’s not a Nickelodeon Animation Studio production, so we don’t own the rights to it and it’s not part of our 25 Years celebration.\n\nReally, Nick? Well, can you explain why you suddenly decided to broadcast the show through The Splat, even though you clearly stated that you wouldn’t do anything about the show during your 25th anniversary celebration because it’s not an actual Nick production? Look, it’s nice that you’re pleasing fans of the show for acknowledging it for the first time in over 10 years. And like I said, I was amazed myself that you guys actually have a soft spot left for Pelswick. However, I dislike how you betrayed your own statement for no public reason. What’s been going between you and Corus Entertainment, Nick? How and why were you able to get permission from Nelvana to let the show air again on one of your networks? Well, whatever the case may be…you sure gave us a damn good surprise!\n\nAlso, when I mentioned how Pelswick used to be an official Nicktoon, Nick answered back:\n\nNicktoons is used more for branding and promotion than to indicate which shows are by Nick Animation. So anything we’ve aired could be considered “an official Nicktoon” even though many of them are not created or produced at Nick Animation. Notice there’s no difference in the way The Loud House and Alvin and the Chipmunks are branded on air right now, even though we make The Loud House and Alvin is an acquisition.\n\nWell, at least with this comment, Nick is giving us their definition on the term “Nicktoon”. Just like art as a whole, it’s something that’s both objective and subjective. It’s a fact that Ren & Stimpy is a Nicktoon, but it’s subjective to consider The Brothers Flub one. I don’t see it as a Nicktoon, not because it wasn’t produced by Nick’s in-house studio (instead, it was made by Sunbow Entertainment and Sony Wonder), but there doesn’t seem to be any promos calling it a Nicktoon. If there were, please share them with me, readers. Yeah, with me, I determine if a cartoon airing on the channel should be considered a Nicktoon in my opinion based on how its promoted, regardless of Nick still owning the rights or not. For example, I previously didn’t see Kappa Mikey or Random! Cartoons as official Nicktoons, because they were produced for Nicktoons Network, not the main Nickelodeon channel. Then, I got Not Just Cartoons: Nicktoons!, and my opinion changed from there. So, this official comment should gratify us all. If you want to call the French show Corneil and Bernie a Nicktoon, despite not airing on the main Nick channel, it all depends on your point of view. Just keep in mind that Nick was only involved distribution-wise, not production-wise.\n\nOverall, even though they contradicted one of their YouTube comments, it really is awesome how Nick has proven that they do remember this oddity of Nicktoons history, and that they actually don’t hate it enough to completely obliterate it from its library. Let’s hope that other early 2000s Nicktoons, such as Jimmy Neutron, Invader Zim, ChalkZone, and My Life as a Teenage Robot, make it onto the Splat line-up as well. And let’s hope Nick still remembers Wayside, too.\n\nNow, if you excuse me, I’ve got three better Nicktoons to wish a happy birthday to this month, Hey Arnold!, KaBlam!, and that one with the redhead (yeah, at this point, I feel so much embarrassment over my Ginger obsession last year that I sometimes hesitate to refer to the show by name)…\n\nUPDATE (Dec. 4, 2016): Nickelodeon has realized that they said they weren’t going to do anything Pelswick-related for the #NickAnimation25 celebration, so they decided at the last minute NOT to have it air on The Splat this fall. Thus, Pelswick still remains the biggest Butt Monkey of all the Nicktoons. In happier news, The Splat has been showing ChalkZone, its birthplace Oh Yeah! Cartoons, and even Action League Now! (in standalone form)/ Once again, 2016 has proven to be such a redeemable year for Nick Animation.\n\nBTW, I’m sorry for calling you hypocrites, Nick.\n\nSay, that’s a pretty neat title I just came up with. It should be used for a coffee-table book or something.\n\nHappy Canada Day, everyone! This is a time for animation fans to praise the likes of Norman McLaren, Richard Condle, Cordell Barker, Danny Antonucci, Richard Williams, and the insanely persnickety John Kricfalusi for being born in the Great White North to shake up the animation industry with their edginess, imagination, and creative talent! But today, I’m briefly praising an entire animation studio! One that has played as big of a part of my childhood as Nickelodeon Animation Studio! I would like to call this studio the Disney of Canada, not only because it’s the biggest animation studio of its own home country, but also because a majority of their famous productions tend to be adaptations of existing properties, whether it be children’s books, toys, video games, or an Oscar-winning short.\n\nIT’S NELVANA! Down below is a mini logo history.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nBorn in Toronto, Nelvana Limited all started back in 1971, June 23rd. Michael Hirsh and Patrick Loubert had just graduated from York University, so they decided that establishing an animation studio would a fun way to spend the rest of their lives. When they teamed up with British animator Clive A. Smith, the three of them started to work on a series of animated/live-action shorts called Small Star Cinema for CBC.\n\nFun fact: the studio was named after a Canadian comic book heroine named Nelvana of the Northern Lights, because Michael, Patrick, and Clive had a fascination with Canadian comics that are now obscure as hell. But it wasn’t until 1978 when the polar bear was first adopted to be their mascot, instead of Nelvana of the Northern Lights. Well, considering how obscure that heroine is, I doubt that a lot of people would mistake the studio for her. It’s probably be the other way around.\n\nIn 1977, they began their string of animated specials, including A Cosmic Christmas, The Devil and Daniel Mouse, Easter Fever, Romie-0 and Julie-8, and Take Me Up to the Ball Game. So far, I’ve only seen the second one. Eventually, Nelvana caught the attention of a certain director of a certain movie about a certain galaxy far, far away. Yes, George Lucas loved Nelvana! If you were strong enough to actually remember the infamous Star Wars Holiday Special, you might remember those weird animated segments in the middle. That was Nelvana’s doing. They also made the animated series Droids and Ewoks based on Star Wars, from 1985 to 1986.\n\nHowever, Nelvana’s rise to fame came when they made a deal with American Greetings to produce a feature length film based on the diabetically adorable Care Bear plushies, as well as a few specials based on Strawberry Shortcake. In 1985, The Care Bears Movie proved to be so successful that it infamously beat Disney’s attempt at finding their darker side with The Black Cauldron. On one hand, it’s hilarious; on the other hand, it’s sad and embarrassing. Either way, it’s thanks to the Care Bears why Nelvana is even still alive to this day. After suffering the failure of their first movie, Rock & Rule, the people at Nelvana must have been grateful.\n\nAnd the rest is history for you to find out on your own time, either through Wikipedia, or the 2001 book The Nelvana Story: Thirty Animated Years, which was coincidentally released on the same day as Braceface.\n\nAnd now, time for the highlight of this post!\n\nThis massive, colorful collage, containing exactly 69 Nelvana productions, should be enough to illustrate my strong admiration for them, and how much they mean to me as a Canadian animation aficionado. Recognize any of your favorites? I apologize if they are any I missed. I didn’t want to be biased by only including shows that I either admire or formerly admire. The collage went far enough to include stuff that I either show indifference towards (such as Cyberchase and Pelswick), or haven’t seen at all yet (like A Cosmic Christmas and Fievel’s American Tails).\n\nWhenever I can, I’ll update this post with a list of the cartoons included in the collage in chronological order, as well as my short opinions on the ones I’ve actually seen.\n\nThanks very much to Michael, Patrick, and Clive, for all the work they’ve done to keep the animation industry in Canada alive for all these decades. However, let’s not forget that Nelvana not only covers for Canada, but for the whole globe as well."
