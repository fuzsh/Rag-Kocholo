        "text": "Lauren Fitz July 26th, 2016 - 2:41 PM\n\nAlicia Silverstone is making a return to television. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Silverstone has been cast in the TVLand pilot of a new show called American Woman, which is inspired by The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills cast member Kyle Richards.\n\nThe show will be set in the 1970s during the rise of the sexual revolution and feminism. Silverstone will play Bonnie Nolan, a mom of two children who is on the path to discover who she really is after she leaves her husband and struggles to find independence at a time when women didn’t have a lot of independence.\n\nThe pilot episode is written by John Riggi, who worked on NBC’s 30 Rock. Riggi will also be an executive producer with John Wells. Richards will also be a co-executive producer.\n\nThe ordering of the pilot of American Woman continues to show how TVLand is trying to appeal to younger viewers, especially with shows like Younger, Teachers and Impastor that currently air on the network.\n\nWhen news of the pilot was first announced, Keith Cox, executive vice president development and original programming at TVLand, said “This project, the caliber of the people behind it, and its fearless authenticity brings TV Land to new heights.”\n\nSilverstone is best known for her role as Cher Horowitz in the 90s teen movie Clueless. She’s also had roles in many television shows, including the cartoon Braceface, where she was also the executive producer, Childrens Hospital and Suburgatory. She’s starred in a number of unaired pilots, including one for NBC, ABC and Lifetime.\n\nRichards herself has been in show business since she was a child. She had a role on Little House on the Prairie, played a nurse on ER, was on Beverly Hills, 90210 and was recently on Days of our Lives. She’s also appeared on shows as herself, including The Simple Life, which starred her niece, Paris Hilton, Betty White’s Off Their Rockers and has been a cast member of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills since the show started in 2010. Her sister, Kim, was also a cast member on the show. The Wrap confirmed it was renewed for a seventh season back in April."
