        "text": "That crappy Tex Avery show that wasn't actually about Tex Avery it was just a pale imitation of his art style about some obnoxious cowboy. Always screwed me up when you'd see it on and you'd think you were gonna see The Ventriloquist Cat or a dope Droopy cartoon but nope, just some shitty cowboy show.\n\nI don't remember this... the Tex Avery show I knew from late night cartoon network in the mid 90's was literally just them showing Tex Avery cartoons.\n\nthere was this cartoon from britain (or at least on British cartoon network) and it had the ugliest characters I've ever seen\n\nit was about 3 boys and in the intro they were using a mirror to look up a girls skirt\n\nit was so bad but that's all I remember\n\nthis would have been on in like 98 or 99 maybe 2000\n\nI thought you were talking about Fleabag Monkeyface but I think that was on like a decade later.\n\nNo one should be wondering how Johnny Test got made and stayed on the air for so long. Both of those are because it must have been the single cheapest cartoon in the history of the medium. An given episode looks like it cost ~$25 to make and they got to be on the air for years. Imagine the profit margins!\n\nAlso Secret Saturdays was a cool idea with bad execution. Johnny Quest + Cryptids sounds great.\n\nAnything made by Hannah Barbara in the 70s/80s.\n\nThey made some classics but man did they -mass produce- a metric ton of shitty and cheap cartoons.\n\nThey made about 4-5 rip offs of their own franchise (Scooby-Doo).\n\nThis is probably the correct answer. I remember watching Speed Buggy (1973) and the cartoon literally wasn't finished before airing. Horrendous animation on cheap blank backgrounds all over the place.\n\nEdit: wait. Im wrong. The unfinished show was 'wheelie and the chopper bunch' (1974)\n\nYou people think Rocket Power was bad, this was the absolute nadir of extreme sports cash-ins at the turn of the millennium. Who asked for kiddie xXx, but with ass-ugly CGI and no Rammstein?\n\nYeah, I know xXx came out when Max Steel was getting cancelled, don't @ me.\n\nHi Hi, Puffy AmiYumi\n\nA cartoon about 2 real Japanese women who speak English and have a Jpop band, in which they are played by 2 American voice actresses. (but they still do a live action skit at the end of the Episode with the real women, so it's an even more confusing decision).\n\nI mean, Jackie Chan Adventures had a similar premise including a live-action bit at the end and it was awesome.\n\nThe creators blog was full of really cool behind the scenes stuff, and his final posts on the show were heartbreaking. No idea if they are still available anywhere, but he even talked about how he loved the time skips in dragonball/z, and that's why the final episode had one.\n\n(edit) In today's WTF, someone used his original blog (https://cartoonnetworkschowder.blogspot.com/) to host some business blog called CN Schowder...\n\nSadly the wayback machine doesn't have it archived a lot of great stuff lost forever to time.\n\nI don't actually remember anything about it except I can sing the song, lol. I just know I loved it when I was very small.\n\nLol fair enough. I think I was 8 years old when it aired, and I'd watch it because it was the only cartoon on at the time. Ive seen over 100 episodes and I hated every minute of it.\n\nThe creators blog was full of really cool behind the scenes stuff, and his final posts on the show were heartbreaking. No idea if they are still available anywhere, but he even talked about how he loved the time skips in dragonball/z, and that's why the final episode had one.\n\nLove the show so much, probably best it ended when it did so the quality did not dive, but I would have loved another season.\n\nHere's my contributions:\n\nYeah, believe it or not they made an animated tv show based on the classic Mel Brooks film 21 Years later! And man it sucked. It tried to parody other iconic sci-fi fantasy films such as Jurassic Park and Lord of the Rings, but so much of the humor was either too low brow, very repetitive or just plain unfunny. I guess it was made because G4 wanted to get an animated hit that pandered towards those who are nostalgic for Spaceballs? Anyways Spaceballs Animated was bad and had an ugly art style too.\n\nAlso:\n\nF**k this show. It had an interesting premise claiming it was suppose to show George W Bush's childhood and how grew up to be a crappy person and president. But instead the episodes had very unsubtle slams at Bush's actions during his presidency but they change the timing of the actions as he committed those actions as a kid.That completely defeats the purpose of the show if you're demonstrating GW Bush as a terrible child and how he got the motivation to make terrible decisions as president later! Combine that with the show coming out very late in Bush's second term (2007), terribly forced music sections, lousy animation and just garbage writing and it's literally one of the worst cartoons I've seen. It's literally the Our Cartoon President of the 2000's.\n\nOh something more inline with my youth.\n\nI know how it got made but fuck it was the worst, especially as a kid when you thought Ghostbusters was on and it was this trash.\n\nI always felt the same way. Looking at it again the animation and art looks decent, but the opening theme seemed like it was bored with itself. Also the gorilla makes the same repeated noises every time.\n\nWhy the hate for the Secret Saturday\n\nI don't have much of an opinion about it, but from what little I saw of it, I wasn't a fan.\n\nDidn't help that it aired during a time CN was on a downward slog and I was almost completely uninterested in their programming."
