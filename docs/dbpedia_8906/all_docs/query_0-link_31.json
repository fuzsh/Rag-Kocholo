        "text": "These shows may’ve been the cream of the crop in their day, but TV has come a long way since. Welcome to WatchMojo, and today we’re counting down our picks for the top 10 TV shows that have become unwatchable with age.\n\nFor this list, we’re taking a look at various older TV shows that are difficult to watch now due to their acting, directing, or production values. To be clear, we aren’t saying that these shows are BAD – in fact, some of them are absolute classics. However, even the classics can age poorly.\n\n#10: “Walker, Texas Ranger” (1993-2001)\n\nLook, we all know Chuck Norris is a badass. But there’s no denying that this show’s seen better days. The program follows Norris, who plays a member of the law enforcement agency known as the Texas Ranger Division. While the show was fairly popular during its run, it never earned much critical acclaim, and if you thought it was kinda corny then, well, it’s even more corny now. The martial arts action the series was famous for just doesn’t stack up next to today’s fights, and the runtime is basically a constant stream of camp. Of course, it also doesn’t help that Conan O’Brien used to make fun of the show in his popular “Walker, Texas Ranger Lever” segments.\n\n#9: “Everybody Loves Raymond” (1996-2005)\n\nEverybody DOES love Raymond. Or at least, everybody DID love Raymond. The show was a critical darling throughout much of its run, it ended on a high note, and it was largely praised for breaking some TV sitcom molds – for example, it focused on the parents rather than the family unit as a whole. However, this concept is now commonplace, and many of the running jokes, like Robert living with his parents in his 40s and the rivalry the two siblings share, now seem a little clichéd or odd or out of touch. “Everybody Loves Raymond” is as funny as it ever was, but it’s definitely beginning to show its age.\n\n#8: “Full House” (1987-95)\n\nAt the time, it was a unique premise: a widowed father raises his three daughters with the help of his brother-in-law and best friend. OK, maybe not THAT unique, considering that “Three Men and a Baby” came out within months of “Full House’s” premiere. In any case, “Full House’s” main appeal was its wholesomeness; the apparently novel idea of men raising children; and the Olsen twins saying cute things as Michelle Tanner. Today, however, that wholesomeness can seem saccharine, and the jokes hopelessly simple. Sure, the mullets are still kind of fun, but we’ve since had an entire show about kids saying the darndest things - wearing out the novelty. Then again, there are still enough fans for a sequel series, so what do we know?\n\n#7: “7th Heaven” (1996-2007)\n\n“7th Heaven” was an insanely successful show for The WB and The CW, achieving high ratings throughout its 11 season run. The show followed a minister and his family, and was a mix of soap opera and old-fashioned family drama. However, the “soap opera” aspect meant it came with outlandish moments and on-the-nose morality, including a hilariously dramatic reaction to finding a joint and discovering over-the-top gang paraphernalia under a teenager’s bed. Family-oriented viewers praised the series, but to the rest of us, it is now terribly dated and overly preachy.\n\n#6: “Knight Rider” (1982-86)\n\nIt’s an 80s action show about a crime fighter, played by David Hasselhoff, who’s assisted by a self-aware car. Did you really expect it to hold up? At the time, this was the baddest thing on television, complete with Hasselhoff’s rocking haircut, a beautiful Pontiac Firebird Trans Am, and all the high-tech gizmos you could imagine. Now it just looks like cheap ‘80s fare. Along with the dated technology and fashion, the action scenes are hilariously campy, and the acting is…questionable, to say the least. But hey, if you’re into 80s cheese, then this is essential viewing.\n\n#5: “Saved by the Bell” (1989-93)\n\nYes, we know, this is a classic, and it’s undoubtedly etched into your mind as the quintessential high school series. However, it’s not without its issues. For one thing, the late 80s/early 90s fashion and slang are hilariously outdated, making it difficult for newcomers or younger viewers to enjoy without rolling their eyes. The show also has a high camp factor; one need only watch Jessie’s infamous caffeine freak-out to realize it. Many of the show’s hallmarks, including a focus on the “tween” demographic, have also been recycled countless times since, which now makes the show seem dated and unoriginal. It’s a 90s classic, but maybe it should’ve stayed in the 90s.\n\n#4: “Home Improvement” (1991-99)\n\nThis was easily one of the biggest sitcoms throughout the 90s. It starred Tim Allen as Tim the Tool Man Taylor, a know-it-all yet accident-prone handyman, whose catchphrase was a series of \"manly\" grunts. At the time, the show featured some new and interesting ideas, like realistic marital disputes rather than the simple “wife is correct and the husband is a bumbling idiot” trope popular during this era. However, many shows have since featured more three-dimensional relationships like this, and “Home Improvement’s” wholesome family drama can now feel forced. The show also remained strictly formulaic throughout its run, severely hampering its longevity. It’s now just a simple 90s sitcom and nothing more.\n\n#3: “The Cosby Show” (1984-92)\n\n“The Cosby Show” was an enormous success in the 1980s. It remained the number one show for five straight seasons and is the only sitcom, along with “All in the Family,” to achieve that distinction. The show was also praised for challenging racial stereotypes of the time by portraying a stable and successful black family. But today, several decades later, this revolutionary idea has lost much of its impact thanks to the numerous clones it inspired, meaning “The Cosby Show” has become just another dated sitcom. Furthering its unwatchability significantly are the sexual assault allegations brought against Bill Cosby, which have tarnished the name of this sitcom for many viewers forever.\n\n#2: “The A-Team” (1983-87)\n\nLike “Knight Rider,” “The A-Team” was once the absolute coolest show on television – it starred Mr. T, had over-the-top action, and featured the most outrageous villains you could imagine. It also never took itself too seriously. But even so, the show is incredibly corny by today’s standards. With the possible exception of its premise and that badass theme song, nothing much from this show transitioned smoothly from the 80s to today, including the hammy acting, cheap action, and incredibly dated celebrity cameos, like Boy George (yeah, remember him?). Oh, and blackface. Yup, there was blackface.\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions:\n\n“Touched by an Angel” (1994-2003)\n\n“Baywatch” (1989-2001)\n\n“Magnum, P.I.” (1980-88)\n\n#1: “Dawson’s Creek” (1998-2003)\n\n“Dawson’s Creek” was a groundbreaking show; not only was it a defining entry in the up-and-coming teen drama category; it also featured those teens talking about subjects considered taboo for TV at the time – at least, when discussed by the under-20 set. Dawson, Joey, Pacey and Jen’s talk of sex and masturbation earned the series some criticism – even though, y’know, that’s just teens being teens. Viewers at the time couldn’t believe it, but TV’s come a long way since then; these once off-limits topics are now boring, and the teen drama market is oversaturated, meaning that watching this show for the first time today is an exercise in patience. But trust us: it was unbelievable stuff 20 years ago."
