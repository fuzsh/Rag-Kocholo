        "text": "Canadian independent studio Blueprint Ent. has been greenlit by Canadian animation network Teletoon for 26 half-hour episodes of the live-action tween comedy GO-GIRL. GO-GIRL is the first Teletoon original production to feature live-action animation hybrid with an eclectic mix of animation and visual collage techniques.\n\nThe series begins production in late fall, filming in Toronto and the greater Ontario region, for a fall 2009 launch on the network. John Morayniss and Frank Saperstein of Blueprint Ent. and creator Wilson Coneybeare (TIMEBLAZERS, MONSTER WARRIORS) executive produce the series joined by Alyse Rosenberg (BRACEFACE, READY OR NOT) who serves as head writer/showrunner. Blueprint's Oasis International will distribute the series worldwide.\n\nGO-GIRL is the story of a town that gets turned upside down when 15-year-old Becky Smith's class project results in her election as mayor. The series follows Becky and her enthusiastic group of friends as they balance family, high school, relationships, and politics. A strong online and web component is being developed as an organic outgrowth of the series, offering a portal where teens and tweens are encouraged to make a difference and have their voices heard while providing them with an enhanced television experience.\n\nCasting Directors Lisa Parasyn and Jon Comerford have begun a country wide casting search seeking the latest young talent to populate the GO-GIRL world. Blueprint has taken the unusual step of expanding the casting search to the virtual realm via a Facebook Event page. Young hopefuls are being invited to post their auditions onto YouTube for consideration.\n\n\"Casting online is an innovative process that this audience is familiar with and gives them further opportunity to share their creativity with a free voice,\" said Lisa Parasyn and Jon Comerford. \"We live in a world where anything can be uploaded at the touch of your fingertips and the top performers who are most familiar with this means of technology are the younger generation. By presenting the casting call online, it not only offers greater opportunity and advancement on our side, but also to the young aspiring generation who are looking for their chance at stardom.\""
