        "text": "By Tyler Alm\n\nBraces are the best. Whether it’s the sharp hooks that poke you when you talk, that gooey bubble gum flavored paste that makes a teeth mold, or that constant voice telling you that you need to floss more. We all love them! As surprising as it is, that’s not quite the case. Whether you’ve had them for six months or six years, you’ve probably been counting down until they’re gone. Even people who have already made it to the finish line and had them taken off remember it too clearly. Ryleigh Hauer, (10) who had braces through freshman year, said that in the event of being faced with braces again, she would refuse them. Hauer said, “No, my teeth are straight enough.” Ciana Burroughs, (10) who got hers off September, reacted the same. She said, “The worst part was not being able to eat caramel apples.” Even the adults are not exempt, as Chris Love explains as he only got his own pair off about four years ago. Love said, “The one thing that I think was a difference for me that I don’t see in kids is the fact that I was paying for them myself, so I always made sure to do what the orthodontist told me.” Braces don’t always span to adulthood, but they’re generally for the best. Luckily for all of us, though, we are not alone. According to First State Smiles, specialists in teeth, up to 70% of teenagers either have or need braces. Being a teen is uncomfortable, and it can feel all the more awkward with those tight rubber bands you have to wear and your big brackets ruining your first kiss, but everyone else knows your pain, too. As much as it feels like it will be forever, your braces will come off one day. Until then, try and follow your orthodontist’s advice, get some snappy colors, and smile wide."
