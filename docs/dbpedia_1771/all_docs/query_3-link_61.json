        "text": "O\n\nn May 21, the leader of the Republican Peopleâs Party (CHP) and presidential candidate of the Nation Alliance, Kemal KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄlu, attended the program âMevzular AÃ§Ä±k Mikrofonâ on Babala TV where he addressed a wide array of controversial topics. Some of his answers prompted responses from public figures, including the CEO of Bakar Haluk Bayraktar.\n\nOn whether he would shut down Baykar factories if he came to power, KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄlu responded, addressing Bayraktar: âHe [Bayraktar] may produce UAVs/ UCAVs himself, there is no obstacle against that. Our only concern here is creating a competitive environment because there are other establishments that produce the same UAVs/UCAVs, including government agencies. We shouldnât raise any obstacles, but there must be competition. As befits the name: national defense.”\n\nEarlier, Ali Babacan, chairman of the DEVA Party, a constituent of the Nation Alliance, had targeted Baykar during a program on the Turkish Fox TV channel. Talking about UAVs and UCAVs, Babacan said, “They have been made sacred by the government. They say we will burn those who touch them. With all due respect, we will touch them.”\n\n“We don’t ask for support; just donât stymie our efforts, we ask for nothing else“\n\nFollowing KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄluâs answer, Haluk Bayraktar responded by sharing a lengthy and reproachful tweet in which he criticized KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄlu for distorting truths and failing to address slanderous claims made by his partyâs MPs.\n\nThe tweet reads: “Mr. KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄlu, when talking about Baykar, you said, âOur only problem is the creation of a competitive environment.â Not only you, but also those who have voiced the slander and defamation we have been facing recently have clung to this baseless argumentâ¦ If you remember, you did not answer the question of why you raised the position of your MPs, he called the national UCAVs âJÄ°TEMâ [GendarmerieÂ Intelligence Organization], who slandered us for stealing human resources from state companies, who lied that we received money from the municipality, on the lists in DiyarbakÄ±r, Izmir, and Malatya. When Sezgin TanrÄ±kulu’s name was mentioned, you ignored it.\n\nOur late father had denounced these slanders to you years ago in letters and on the phone, but you remained oblivious then too. Finally, when you made another slander, our father Ãzdemir filed a lawsuit against you and the court sentenced you to pay compensation. He had wished for the amount awarded to be donated to the families of martyrs. We once again present your inconsistent behavior before the public’s judgment.”\n\nIn 2022, CHP DiyarbakÄ±r MP Sezgin TanrÄ±kulu had shared a provocative tweet implying that if the CHP came to power, SelÃ§uk Bayraktar would be put on trial.\n\n“Why should we be afraid of competition?“\n\nBayraktar highlighted Baykarâs international success in the defense field, and repetitively emphasized that Baykar was not afraid of competitionâon the contrary, it worked to promote it.\n\nThe tweet continued, “As for the issue of competitionâ¦ Baykar was born out of competition, and became one of the world’s leading companies in its sector through competition. Before Baykar, Turkey was buying UAVs from Israel. Baykar produced UAVs, competed with the Israeli company, and supplied Turkey with better quality UAVs at one-tenth the cost. Currently, there are seven companies, one of which is a foundation-owned company, producing UAVs in Turkey. Baykar has outcompeted U.S., Israeli, and Chinese companies, and exported to 30 countries. It has become the world’s largest UAV exporter.â\n\nBayraktar stated that this yearâs Teknofest, which was organized under Baykar’s leadership with the participation of more than 2.5 million visitors, had garnered more than 4,000 UAV teams among the 332,000 participating teams, with one million young people competing in total. He argued that new technology companies are born from these competitions.\n\nBayraktar added that Baykar had made all its R&D investments with its own resources; had not received any government grants or bank loans; and earned 75% of all its revenues and 99.3% of the current year’s revenues from exports.\n\n“Baykar’s share of total defense spending in Turkey is less than 1%. Which monopoly are you talking about? … Let me explain again: our concern is not to become a monopoly in Turkey. We produced these UAVs for Turkey, for our fight against terrorism. Before Baykar, there was a monopoly and foreign dependency. We want our country to maintain its world leadership in this field.”\n\nBayraktar went on to add, “From Greece to the United States, the world’s most important media outlets have published articles saying that our national UCAVs have changed the paradigm and rewritten defense doctrines. However, what is said and written about what we do at home is always under the same perception, always the same slanderâ¦ While extending your support (!), I wish you had not distorted the truthâ¦ We don’t ask for support; just donât stymie our efforts, we ask for nothing else.”"
