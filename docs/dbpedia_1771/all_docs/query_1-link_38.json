        "text": "95 journalists and 35 distributors welcomed the month of July in prison. All are imprisoned for connections with a \"terrorist organisation\" within the scope of the Anti-Terror Law (TMK) and the Turkish Penal Code (TCK). Sixty-two of the 95 imprisoned journalists and all of the 35 imprisoned distributors are from the Kurdish media.\n\nThese journalists and distributors are being accused with \"creating a media for the illegal organisation.\" Ordinary journalism activities, such as \"following news,\" \"writing books,\" \"criticizing the government,\" and \"working for the Kurdish media,\" are - in general - being defined as offenses.\n\nAmong alleged offenses are, \"committing an offense on behalf of the group, without being a member of that group\" and/or \"knowingly and willingly assisting a group although not being in the hierarchical structure of the group.\" Some journalists are on trial for setting up an armed or unarmed group, motivating and commanding it, and/or being a member of it. The courts have already delivered verdicts in some of these trials.\n\nOnly four journalists are being tried in penal suits brought directly because of their news reports, articles or books: Azadiya Welat newspaper's editors-in-chief Vedat Kurşun, Ruken Ergün and Ozan Kılınç, and Aram Publishing's owner and Hawar newspaper's executive Bedri Adanır.\n\nDespite the fact that arrest is a precautionary measure, criteria such as \"danger of absconding,\" \"destruction, concealment, alteration of evidence\" \"influencing the witness,\" and \"intense and strong suspicion of crime,\" together with the criteria that the accusations are within the scope of Article 100 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, continued to serve as grounds in the second quarter of 2012.\n\nJournalist Murders / Trials\n\nThe Dink Murder\n\nSamast was fined for threatening: On 28 June, the İstanbul 35th Criminal Court of Peace, handed out a punitive fine that corresponds to 30 days to Ogün Samast, who is the murderer of Agos newspaper's editor-in-chief Hrant Dink, for saying \"Only 5 years to go, we will meet again,\" to Hosrof Dink. Samast received a punitive fine of 600 Turkish liras (about 255 euros), 20 liras for each day, for 'threatening.' The fine was not postponed.\n\nDink file is with the Supreme Court of Appeals: The case file regarding the murder of Agos newspaper's editor-in-chief Hrant Dink was sent to the Supreme Court of Appeals on 6 June. After the reasoned decision of the Dink case at the İstanbul 14th High Criminal Court reached both parties, the court sent the file to the Supreme Court of Appeals. The court had made a ruling during the hearing on 17 January, and had announced the reasoned decision about a month later.\n\nDink family applied to the Chief Public Prosecutor: The lawyers of the Dink family submitted two letters of application to the İstanbul Chief Public Prosecutor's Office on 4 June about the civil servants, who had a responsibility in the Dink murder. In the letters of application, the lawyers demanded that the investigation be extended, adding that there is adequate evidence regarding the civil servants and that a law suit should be brought against them.\n\nLetter to the Council of Europe: Dink family's lawyer Fethiye Çetin wrote a letter to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on 14 June. In the letter, the lawyer stated that the government did not take any serious and concrete steps to enforce the decision of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which had found Turkey guilty. She added that those responsible were not taken to court, but were rather awarded through promotions.\n\nParliamentary question from Tanrıkulu: Republican People's Party's (CHP) Deputy Chairman Sezgin Tanrıkulu presented a parliamentary question to the Presidency of the Turkish Grand National Assembly (TBMM) about the Hrant Dink murder on 23 May. Tanrıkulu asked Justice Minister Sadullah Ergin why the necessary steps were not being taken with regards the civil servants, who have connections with the murder.\n\nParliamentary question from Dibek: Interior Minister İdris Naim Şahin replied CHP Deputy Turgut Dibek's parliamentary question about the Dink murder on 7 May. In his reply, Şahin stated that one of the security officers was handed a long-term suspension from his duty, three security officers had a salary cut, three security officers were reprimanded and one security officer received a warning on grounds that they had negligence in the murder. Şahin added that judicially, an investigation permit was not given about eight personnel, there was no grounds for additional proceedings for 31 personnel, two personnel were acquitted, and the prosecutorial investigation about one personnel is on-going. The interior minister said that four paramilitary police officers were sentenced to four months in prison, one was sentenced to six months in prison, and two paramilitary police officers were acquitted.\n\nSamast's membership in an organisation: Hrant Dink's murderer Ogün Samast stood trial for \"membership in a terrorist organisation\" on 26 April at the İstanbul 2nd Juvenile High Criminal Court. Previously, the İstanbul 14th High Criminal Court had acquitted the defendants including Yasin Hayal and Erhan Tuncel from charges of membership in a terrorist organisation citing lack of evidence. The panel of judges at the İstanbul 2nd Juvenile High Criminal Court decided to wait for the finalisation of the decision by the Supreme Court of Appeals.\n\nSeparately, the court decided to request the sections that mention Dink in the record of the proceedings of the Ergenokon files from the İstanbul 13th High Criminal Court. The hearing was postponed to 18 September.\n\nCihan Hayırsevener trial\n\nGüney Marmara'da Yaşam ('Life in Southern Marmara') newspaper's chief editor Cihan Hayırsevener was killed on 18 December 2009. The fourth hearing of the trial regarding the murder was heard before the İstanbul 10th Specially Authorised High Criminal Court on 22 May. A total of 18 defendants, three of whom have been arrested pending the outcome of the trial, are being charged with organised crime. İhsan Kuruoğlu, who is allegedly the instigator of the murder, Serkan Erakkuş, who is being charged with murder, and driver Kerem Yılmaz, who is being accused with acting in conjunction with the gunman suspect were all present at the hearing. During the hearing, anonymous witness Bandırma explained how Serkan Erakkuş, who pulled the trigger, killed Hayırsevener. With the statements of the anonymous witness, Erakkuş's testimony was disproven. Erakkuş had said that Hayırsevener had insulted him on the road and therefore, he hit Hayırsevener with the keychain he was holding. Erakkuş had continued by saying that when Hayırsevener, who fell on the ground, reached for something inside his bag, he got scared and fired at him. Following the statements of the anonymous witness, the panel of judges listened to the requests of the lawyers of the defendants and rejected the request for a release. The hearing was postponed to 28 August.\n\nHayırsevener was killed on 18 December 2009, while walking on the street in Bandırma soon after publishing articles on the corruption in the public tenders of the municipality in October 2009.\n\nIn May 2011, the 5th Criminal Division of the Supreme Court of Appeals joined the trial being held on grounds of 'establishing an organisation to serve personal interests,' 'membership in an illegal organisation,' 'conspiring to rig the bids in a public tender' with the trial regarding the murder of the journalist. In the trial, which was joined with the 'conspiring to rig the bids in a public tender' trial by the 5th Criminal Division of the Supreme Court of Appeals, İlk Haber ('First News') newspaper's founder İhsan Kuruoğlu and publication adviser Engin Arıcan are among the 18 defendants being charged.\n\nImprisoned Journalists\n\nClick for a table of imprisoned journalists.\n\nNinety-five journalists and 35 distributors all welcomed the month of July in prison. All journalists are imprisoned for connections with an 'organisation' within the scope of the Anti-Terror Law (TMK) and the Turkish Penal Code (TCK).\n\nOnly four journalists are being accused and tried in suits brought directly because of their news reports, articles or books: Azadiya Welat newspaper's editors-in-chief Vedat Kurşun, Ruken Ergün and Ozan Kılınç, and Aram Publishing's owner and Hawar newspaper's executive Bedri Adanır.\n\nSixty-two out of 95 journalists are in prison because of trials related to 'Kurdistan Union of Communities-Turkey' (KCK), 'PKK' and 'DYG', five are in prison because of trials related to 'Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front' (DHKP-C), six are in prison because of trials related to 'Ergenekon', five are in prison because of trials related to the 'Marxist Leninist Communist Party' (MLKP), four are in prison because of trials related to OdaTV, three are in prison because of trials related to the 'Revolutionary Camp', one is in prison because of a trial related to the 'Resistance Movement', one is in prison because of a trial related to the Turkish Communist Labor Party/ Leninist (TKEP/L) organisation and one is in prison because of a trial related to the Turkish Islamic militant group İBDA-C ('The Great Eastern Islamic Raiders' Front').
