        "text": "TURKEY’S Kemalist opposition urged the United States to press Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on democracy yesterday after the latest media arrest.\n\nRepublican People’s Party (CHP) MP Sezgin Tanrikulu spoke out ahead of Mr Erdogan’s meeting with US President Donald Trump at the White House yesterday.\n\nHe pointed to the crackdown by the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government on the CHP and pro-Kurdish HDP since last summer’s failed military coup.\n\n“Turkey is under a state of emergency since then, during which human rights have been trampled on,” Mr Tanrikulu said.\n\n“The media and press freedoms have been placed under government control. Torture and ill-treatment have increased.”\n\nOn Monday night the editor of pro-CHP newspaper Cumhuriyet’s online edition Oguz Guven was arrested for allegedly spreading “terrorist propaganda.”\n\nThat was after the newspaper’s Twitter account wrote that prosecutor Mustafa Alper, who died in a traffic accident last week, was “mown down” by a lorry.\n\nThe comment, seen as distasteful, was deleted 55 seconds after it was posted.\n\nFormer Cumhurriyet editor Can Dundar is now living in exile in Germany after his conviction last year for revealing state secrets after he published photos of Turkish intelligence officers smuggling arms to extremists in Syria.\n\nThe White House meeting was expected to focus on the war in Syria.\n\nThe US angered Turkey last week by announcing arms supplies to Syria’s Kurdish YPG militia — which Turkey sees as allies of Turkey’s banned Kurdish organisation the PKK — to fight Isis.\n\nYesterday Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim called that “unacceptable” and threatened to “root out terror” if Washington did not give guarantees the arms would not end up in PKK hands."
