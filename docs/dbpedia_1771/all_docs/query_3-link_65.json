        "text": "Hitting the notes, ringing the change / It's clipped phrasing and dry ice in summer / Straining against the rhythm, speeding it up / Loping forward and looping back, finding the curl / In the wave, the modd in the air. It's / Splintered tones and furious double timing / It's leaving the other instruments on stage (Camila Nebbia, poem by Edward Hirsch)\n\n© Camila Nebbia, Berlin, 2024, Florian Fritsch\n\nISTANBUL, TURKEY, 6 June 2012 - Ozgur Tanrikulu, Managing Director, McKinsey & Company, Turkey, participates in an arena session at the World Economic Forum on the Middle East, North Africa and Eurasia in Istanbul, 4-6 June 2012.\n\nCopyright World Economic Forum (www.weforum.org)/Photo by Norbert Schiller\n\nAmina Mohamed, Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Culture and Heritage of Kenya, Vikas Pota, Group Chief Executive, Tmrw Digital, United Kingdom; Young Global Leader, Bonginkosi Emmanuel Nzimande, Minister of Higher Education and Training of South Africa, Ozgur Tanrikulu, Senior Partner and Managing Partner, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (EEMA), McKinsey & Company, South Africa, Clayton Naidoo, General Manager, sub-Saharan Africa, Cisco, South Africa speaking during the session Employing Africa’s Talent at the World Forum World Economic Forum on Africa 2019.

Co-founder of the Diyarbakir Human Rights Association, the Secretary of the Bar Association in Diyarbakir, and the regional representative of the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey, his work has taken him where few dared to go. For over a decade, the Kurdish region has been under a state of siege, including food blockades and curfews. Fighting between Turkish troops and the Workers Party of Kurdistan has caught civilians in the cross fire.\n\nPhoto by Eddie Adams"
