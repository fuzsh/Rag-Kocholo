        "text": "Paris\n\nWho killed the Kurds? Turkey’s attempts to restart negotiations with the Kurdish militant group PKK grew complicated after three militants were murdered last week in Paris. The three prominent PKK women—including Sakine Cansiz, a co-founder of the group—were killed just days after the Turkish government announced it had begun cease-fire talks with jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is seeking Kurdish regional self-governance and full minority rights. French investigators believe the killings were either an assassination ordered by Turkey or the result of a PKK power struggle. “There is no question that this was a warning—it shows just how difficult a peace process is going to be,” said Sezgin Tanrikulu, a Kurdish member of the Turkish parliament. The three-decade conflict has killed some 40,000 people.\n\nIsola del Giglio, Italy"
