        "text": "Click to read the article in Turkish\n\nProsecutors have prepared a summary of proceedings against main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) deputy Sezgin Tanrıkulu because of his statements about the allegations that Türkiye used chemical weapons during its military operations in Iraq's Kurdistan region.\n\nThe Parliamentary Crimes Investigation Bureau of the Ankara Chief Public Prosecutor's Office said a tweet Tanrıkulu shared on October 20 was \"in line with the strategic goals and actions\" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).\n\nThe summary of proceedings demanding Tanrıkulu be stripped of legislative immunity was sent to the Ministry of Justice.\n\nIn the tweet in question, Tanrıkulu said, \"I have watched the footage regarding the allegations that chemical weapons were used. Chemical weapons are a crime against humanity. As of tomorrow, I will submit my parliamentary question to the agenda of the parliament about the accuracy of the footage that the allegations are based on. It's interesting that no statement has been made in the face of the allegations.\"\n\nAn MP's legislative immunity can be lifted by a majority vote in the parliament.\n\nOn October 14, the Fırat News Agency (ANF) released a video showing two PKK members allegedly exposed to chemical weapons.\n\nTurkish Medical Association (TTB) Chair Şebnem-Korur Fincancı was arrested on October 26 on suspicion of \"propagandizing for a terrorist organization\" because of her statements about the allegations.\n\n\"I have examined the videos. Obviously, toxic gasses that directly [affect] the nervous system have been used,\" she had told Medya Haber TV. (EMK/VK)"
