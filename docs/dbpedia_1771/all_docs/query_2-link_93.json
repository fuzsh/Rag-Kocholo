        "text": "What nonsense is this. Who are you kidding, they are just words. No, it started 20 years ago. What was done 20 years ago? Isn't the opposition with those who speak out against defense industry companies and oppose them? For example, HDP is one of the opposition's biggest partners. I wish you success with a defense minister from HDP. In fact, lists have already been prepared. If they come to power, the opposition will throw anyone who speaks against the government in jail.I'm not saying this. The opposition says.\n\nÜmit Özdağ follows defence accounts on Twitter. He is also a militarist. You shouldn't put all opposition in the same bag.\n\nBTW if you think that CHP or İP will cancel defence projects you are wrong. You say that they are allied with HDP, yet you ignore the fact that AKP was allied with FETÖ and made peace with PKK. They literally has meetings in the ssouth-east where Erdoğan was on stage with PKK supporters.\n\nAKP has about %30 diehard voters who won't vote for anyone else. The 6 party alliance needs every Kurdish vote they can get, sadly that means playing it nice with HDP.\n\nDon't forget that Erdoğan promised a Kurdish state under the Great Middle East project. Who are you to trash the opposition when your beloved Erdoğan promised them a state with Diyabakir as the capital?\n\nBack to the defence industry. It was rekindled in the 70s during the crisis in Cyprus. By the 90s we were making armoured vehicles and short range ballistic missiles. Aselsan led the way with electronics which have played a key role across land, air and sea assets. It was founded back in 1975. Turkish Aerospace, in 1973. Many other companies were started decades ago. \"Oh but we are making bigger progress now\"... Well it's because knowledge accumulates and manufacturing capabilities expand as time goes on. You cannot build a solid defence industry overnight. Stop attributing the defence industry's success to politicians, and start giving credit to the university students who made this all possible.\n\nÜmit Özdağ follows defence accounts on Twitter.

You cannot build a solid defence industry overnight. Stop attributing the defence industry's success to politicians, and start giving credit to the university students who made this all possible.\n\nThis is the problem here mate\n\nThe opposition alliance is just way too broken rn.... all of them have their own goals and are just allying to topple Erdogan; but what after that? The ppl here are just looking at the half of the cup that is full and is ignoring the rest in terms to their viewpoint of the opposition\n\nFirstly, Baykar said before that any nation's military industry can be toppled no matter how advanced it is as long as there is no political will in an interview. After the AKP goes and the oppositon frgaments again, no party will have the majority and most will try to suck up to the HDP (just like what they are doing now) and I re-iterate how one of those assholes said that Turkey is producing weapons of war and murder within the Turkish parliament itself. So if you are asking me whether the CHP or iYi can destroy a nation's defense industry, then the answer is Yes! If CHP or iYi gets to rule, then the AKP is better alternative but if Umit Ozdag wanna rule, then I say lets give the guy a chance but the current political spectrum is way too polarised tbh.\n\nSecondly, I agree that not all of the opposition is bad; as you have said, Umit Ozdag is actually against the AKP but he isnt with the CHP or iYi due to many reasons, as you know. However, Umit Ozdag doesnt have the sufficient popularity to win in 2023 (he needs a miracle tbh). He may win in 2029 though. Moreover, Umit Ozdag is tooo pure and those who are too pure are easily corrupted\n\nFinally, Yes, most of the Turkish companies doing amazing work rn are actually founded during the 1980s or the 1970s; however, that is no excuse for the delay of more than 40 years FFS! The technology of engines or software wasnt new at the time and they could have nationalised it if they wanted to but I bet that some \"foreign\" powers didnt like that and actually gave orders to the ruling parties the time to hinder their progress. For example, the Altay tank was planned to have a german engine in 2016 yet it was cancelled. Erdo announced plans to develop a domestic engine and we saw it getting fired in 2021 or early 2022; thus, a period of 5 to 7 years to develop an engine from scartch! Why did a company like BMC which hasnt even been founded for even a decade manage to develop an engine in 7 years while other companies couldnt? Does this mean that TAI or Aselsan are inferior? The asnwer is NO! the only difference is that there was political will to actually do these stuff. TEI only took 2 years to finish the design nstudies of teh brandnew TF-6000 and yet we needed 40+ years to nationalise the tech for TS-1400 even though TEI was co-producing F16? Insnaity, the math just doesnt add up here\n\nYou are 100% right on the fact that Erdo didnt do shit for the defense industry. The true legends are the engineers who actually make such dreams come true but Erdogan is the one providing political will and is resisting and getting sanctioned by literally most Western countries for supporting the development of such systems till this day. Just look at the massive propaganda against Turkish weaponry and you will get what I mean\n\nI still remember one member who said b4 that Osman Kavala used to supply the military with weapons and equipments in the early days; thus, my question is how does a philantrophist who hasnt even established a company for less than a decade (if he even did establish one) get the right or even tech to supply weaponry to TSK while ASELSAN or TAI that were founded in the 80s and 70s were present at the time\n\nI dont wanna be an extreme AKP fan but if me rejecting the AKP because they used to collude with FETO and PKK and replacing them with those who are ACTUALLY STILL COLLUDING with such factions; then my brain is simply dead\n\nErdogan is an asshole tbh; but at the very least is a patriot and not a liberal piece of shit (sorry for the language guys)\n\nI can write 5 days worth of articles shitting on Erdo and the mistakes he did but that doesmt mean that I support getting those shitty PKK back into the turkish political scene again tbh; thus, if any of the iYi or CHP's candidates other than Yavas (even though I have some doubts as other factions within the CHP may put pressure on the decent guy) and Ozdag, then the priority should just go to Erdogan"
