        "text": "JUDGMENT\n\nMustafa Sezgin Tanrıkulu v. Turkey 19-07-2017 (no. 27473/06)\n\nsee here\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe applicant is a member of the Turkish Parliament. The case concerned a domestic court decision allowing the monitoring and examination of all electronic communications in Turkey for about one and a half months in 2005. The applicant filled a criminal complaint, but the prosecuting authorities decided not to prosecute the officers, as the execution of the court’s judgments did not constiturte a crime. Nor did the Ministry of Justice decide to take action against the prosecutor or the judge as their acts had fallen within judicial discretion and the decision of May 2005 had been in the interests of national security.\n\nThe ECtHR has condemned Turkey for violating the right to privacy.\n\nPROVISIONS\n\nArticle 8\n\nArticle 13\n\nPRINCIPAL FACTS\n\nThe applicant, Mustafa Sezgin Tanrıkulu, is a Turkish national who was born in 1963 and lives in Ankara. He is a member of the Turkish Parliament.\n\nThe case concerned a domestic court decision that allowed for the interception, monitoring and examination of electronic communications of everyone in Turkey for about a month and a half in 2005. Former president of the Diyarbakır Bar Association, Mr Tanrıkulu learnt about the decision in June 2005 in a newspaper report. The decision had been taken by the Diyarbakır Assize Court on 6 May 2005; it involved granting the National Intelligence Agency of Turkey permission to intercept all domestic and international communications between 8 April and 30 May 2005 with a view to identifying terrorist suspects. Shortly after, Mr Tanrıkulu filed a criminal complaint against the judge who had made the Assize Court decision, the public prosecutor and the intelligence officers involved in both requesting as well as implementing the decision. However the prosecuting authorities decided not to prosecute the intelligence officers as implementing court decisions did not constitute a crime; and the Ministry of Justice decided not to take any action against the public prosecutor or judge as their acts had fallen within judicial discretion and the decision of May 2005 had been in the interests of national security.\n\nRelying on Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life, the home and the correspondence), Mr Tanrıkulu complained about the decision of May 2005 allowing the interception of communications of anyone in Turkey, including himself. He alleged in particular that the interception measures amounted to abuse of the national legislation in force at the time. He also claimed under Article 13 (right to an effective remedy) that he had been denied an effective judicial remedy because the national authorities had refused to carry out an investigation into his complaints about the interception of his communications.\n\nTHE DECISION OF THE COURT\n\nViolation of Article 8 Violation of Article 13"
