        "text": "The motion\n\nANKARA - Hürriyet Daily News\n\nHere is the text of the government motion introduced to the Parliament speaker’s office and signed by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to be voted on at an extraordinary session of Parliament today.\n\n“The negative impact of the ongoing crisis in Syria on our national security, as well as on regional stability and security, is increasingly being seen.\n\n\"As part of the military operations being conducted by the Syrian Arab Republic Armed Forces, starting from Sept. 20, aggressive actions have been directed against our country’s territories too. These actions have continued despite our repeated warnings and diplomatic initiatives. Aggressive actions directed against the territory of our country are on the threshold of an armed attack.\n\n\"This situation has reached a stage that poses serious threats and risks to our national security. Therefore, the need has developed to act rapidly and to take the necessary precautions against additional risks and threats that may be directed against our country. Within this framework, on the condition that the extent, amount, and time will be appreciated and determined by the government, I submit according to Article 92 of the Constitution a one-year-long permission to make the necessary arrangements for sending the Turkish Armed Forces to foreign countries and having it [TSK] mandated, according to the principle causes that will be designated by the government.”"
