        "text": "MINISTER OF JUSTICE TUNÇ REACTED TO THE WORDS OF SEZGIN TANRIKULU, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FROM CHP (REPUBLICAN PEOPLE’S PARTY), ABOUT TURKISH ARMED FORCES\n\nMinister of Justice Yılmaz Tunç stated that the words of Sezgin Tanrıkulu, member of parliament from CHP, about the Turkish Armed Forces (TAF) are unacceptable. He stated that if the issue is referred to the Grand National Assembly of Türkiye, the discretion lies with the Assembly.\n\nMinister Tunç answered the questions of the press members, after the Opening Ceremony for Training Year of the Justice Academy of Türkiye, held at the Court of Cassation.\n\nMinister Tunç, who was asked about his opinion on launching an investigation after CHP Diyarbakır Deputy Sezgin Tanrıkulu's remarks about the Turkish Armed Forces, said that \"It is not possible to welcome or accept these statements.\"\n\nMinister Tunç, who reminded that the matter was referred to the judiciary and an investigation was opened, stated as follows:\n\n\"As a result of this investigation, you know the process. At this point, especially the summary of proceedings regarding this investigation comes to the agenda of the Grand National Assembly of Türkiye. It is discussed in the Committee on the Constitution. It is not possible to accept these statements. It is unacceptable to defame our soldiers. Unfortunately, these things have been done in the past. It is unacceptable for anyone to defame our army and to make such accusations against our army. It is unacceptable for any of our citizens, especially for someone who holds the title of a member of parliament. His own political party must also react here. In this sense, the necessary investigation process has already begun. After this investigation process is submitted to the Grand National Assembly of Türkiye, it is naturally at the discretion of the Assembly.”"
