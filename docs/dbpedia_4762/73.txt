It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of our brother, Ian Ferguson, at the age of 54. Pre-deceased by his mother Dorothy Ferguson, Ian leaves behind his father Graham, sister Kathryn and brother Bruce (Magda). He was well loved by his nieces Elyzabeth, Morgan, Abigail and his nephew Connor.

Ian was a gentle soul who lived a life of giving, patience, and kindness to others. He would be the first to lend a hand to a friend or loved one without question and was an intellectual powerhouse. He led a life with a curious and artistic mind and will surely be missed by friends and family.

The family will be having a celebration of Ianâ€™s life at Tubman Funeral Homes Garden Chapel on Saturday May 22, 2021. This is a virtual service which will be live streamed to family and friends. Access to the link is available at www.tubmanfuneralhomes.com/obituary/Ian-Ferguson.

In lieu of flowers, the family have requested donations be made to Shelter Movers Ottawa.
