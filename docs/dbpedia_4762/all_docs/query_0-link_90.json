        "text": "BATTLE OF KAPYONG\n\nCommonwealth troops faced vastly overwhelming Chinese forces in the Kapyong Valley in April 1951. AWM historian Michael Kelly outlines this often forgotten David vs Goliath struggle in the Korean War\n\nEarly on April 23, 1951, from the Sea of Japan in the east to the Imjin river valley in the west, thousands of Chinese soldiers went on the offensive in the largest series of attacks of the Korean War so far. Wave after wave collided with United Nations positions along the entire Korean front. The men of the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade occupying Kapyong’s road and ridges had just 90 minutes warning before the understrength brigade would have to hold against a division three times its size.\n\nFought at the same time as the heroic defence of Imjin, which ranks high among Britain’s great battles, the action at Kapyong barely 45 miles to the east was of equal significance. It was a truly Commonwealth affair, with the bulk of the fighting men from Australia and Canada. At Kapyong, which took place nearly 36 years to the day of the Gallipoli landings, a number of the combatants were the sons of veterans of that conflict."
