        "text": "Oct 29, 1937 - Jun 3, 2018\n\nYou may remember her from the Government Office, the Cranbrook Court House, or the BC Access Center, where she joyfully, diligently and capably gave her service, or maybe as a dedicated member of the Catholic Church, the CWL, or the Historical Society. Perhaps you knew her as an avid gardener, or a generous friend.\n\nMarilynne Anne Ferguson died with laughter, many visitors, a struggle and then peace, on Sunday, June 3rd, 2018, in the town where she was born. She was predeceased by her mother Mary Pascuzzo, her father Sandy Pascuzzo, her husband of 13 years George Ferguson, and her aunt and dear friend Dot Haley.\n\nShe will be remembered fondly by her daughter Sandi Cockwell and Sandi's husband Dave; her son Bruce Ferguson and his partner Brad Antle; her three grandsons Jason, Bryan and Aaron Cockwell and Aaron's wife Sharla; her great granddaughter Taya Cockwell; her brother Gene Pascuzzo and his wife Betty; nephews Johnny and Stephen Pascuzzo, Neil, Sandy and Ian MacDonald, Duncan Ferguson and Cam Grunstrom; and nieces Charlene Misurelli, Geraldine Chuong, Ann Harper, Adele Simpson, Deanna Ferguson and Val MacCormack; her aunt and good friend Eva Schieffert; faithful cousins Renie Misurelli, Dave and Lenny Haley, and Dave's wife Laura; as well as friends who became like family, Heather, Wally, Kinnon and Griffin Smith; and Harry Kotlarz to whom she was Mom #2.\n\nShe will also live on in the hearts of the many friends she has made and kept over the years, and many more fine relatives.\n\nPrayers for Marilynne will be held at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Cranbrook on Tuesday, June 12th at 7:00 pm. A funeral mass will be held Wednesday, June 13th, also at St Mary's, at 1:00 pm, followed by a short graveside service at Westlawn Cemetery, and a reception tea in St. Mary's church hall.\n\nArrangements entrusted to McPherson Funeral Service."
