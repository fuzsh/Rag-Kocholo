He was the owner and operator of Ernie's Garage in Dawson Springs.\n\n\"Ernie Aiken was a good man,\" his friend Joe Lovell wrote in a tribute. \"He was a good friend to my dad and cared for my whole family. He was a man you could depend on if you called for help. He was a man of few words, but what he had to say always helped. He will be missed by many.\"\n\nNancy Son Menser wrote in a tribute that she's known Aiken since she was a teenager; he was very close to her two brothers. For years — right up until his death — he would pick up her brother, Randy, and take him to breakfast every Saturday.

Rachel's mom, Victoria Smith, 64, also lived with them.\n\nCynthia Duncan, Steven’s mom, described her son as a “God-fearing man” and “a family man.\"\n\nHe served two tours in Iraq, relatives said.

Terrence Duncan Sr. told the crowd, taking care of Nyles, including doing his hair. She was “a joy.”\n\nNyssa was “a handful,” he said. One of her teachers attended the visitation, telling relatives the middle-schooler gave him just about all he could handle.\n\n“But that’s who she was,” said Duncan.\n\nNyles was “a joy, a glow, a busybody,” Duncan said.\n\nAnd Nolynn had a contagious smile — one he would always flash, even if he was chastised by his parents or picked on by peers, Duncan said.\n\n“He lit up a room,” his grandfather said.\n\n- Olivia Krauth\n\nShare this story on Twitter\n\nShare this story on Facebook\n\nEmail this story\n\nLink copied to clipboard\n\nShare this story\n\nJennifer Bruce\n\n65, of Dawson Springs\n\nJenny Bruce served the kids of Dawson Springs for four decades, even after her retirement.\n\nBruce was a school board member for Dawson Springs Independent, a small district with around 500 students in Hopkins County.\n\nShe was the finance director for many of her years in the district, a post from the Kentucky School Boards Association said.\n\nSarah Kaegi, the finance officer for Murray Independent, said in a message Bruce was “sweet, kind & always ready to help.”\n\nBruce \"always talked about her husband, her children, her grandchildren & of course, her dog,\" Kaegi said.\n\n\"She always had a smile on her face.

The two lived in a trailer on the property while he learned — because he had no carpentry experience — and built the house entirely on his own at his leisure, his brother Tim Burdon told The Courier Journal.\n\nTim said his brother was always focused on his health: He ate right, walked 10 miles a day and lifted weights regularly. Burdon was an avid outdoorsman who was planning to finish hiking the second half of the Appalachian Trail this spring.\n\n\"He used to joke that he would live to be 120,\" Tim Burdon said. \"He became kind of a farm boy after living in the city. He just did what he wanted to in his retirement.\"\n\nLarry was quiet, highly intelligent and loved the Lord. He loved his chickens and often left eggs for his neighbors. Tim said his brother was full of ingenuity, even as a child. He built a radio as a young kid and communicated with people from Japan.\n\nWhen he mowed the lawn, he drove a stake into the ground and connected it to a self-propelled mower in a way that it would mow a large circle evenly. Sometimes he'd watch and laugh from the house as passersby in their cars slowed to watch, confused about what was happening.\n\n\"He was a good brother and a good man,\" Tim said. \"If he set his mind to do something, he would do it.\"\n\nBurdon, his wife, his daughter and their grandson were thrown from the home when the tornado hit. They woke up on the lawn while it was pitch black and raining.\n\nLarry was disoriented and prayed out loud until he died. His wife, who is alert but critical at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, was buried under debris. Neighbors rushed over to help, covering them with blankets and doing what they could. But, it took more than three hours for authorities to cut through mangled trees so ATVs could take them out on stretchers.\n\n\"The devastation is unimaginable,\" said Tim, who has been at his brother's home assessing the damage. He said it will take heavy equipment like bulldozers and backhoes to move the debris, likely after the holidays. Teams of people have come out to help the family. Larry's wife is facing months of recovery; his daughter and grandson had only minor injuries.\n\nA verified GoFundMe has been set up to help with expenses.\n\n- Kala Kachmar\n\nShare this story on Twitter\n\nShare this story on Facebook\n\nEmail this story\n\nLink copied to clipboard\n\nShare this story\n\nDevin Burton\n\n21, of Mayfield\n\nDevin Burton died working at a candle factory in Mayfield, along with six of his co-workers and a deputy jailer who was on-site.\n\nHe had only worked at the factory for a few months, his obituary says. Before that, he worked at McDonald’s.\n\n\"Losing you is the hardest thing I’ve been through,” his mom, calling herself his “momma,” wrote on his obituary site. “I miss you so much.

Wiggins.\n\nMany of the defendants who came before him weren’t represented by attorneys, and Crick “was very good about seeing to it that their rights were protected,” Wiggins said. “He had a very common-sense approach. He was very level-headed about how to handle cases and how to talk to people.”\n\nCrick was killed when the storm hit his family’s home in Muhlenberg County. He is survived by a wife and three children, none of whom suffered major injuries, Wiggins said. “[Crick] was just a consummate family man ... very engaged with his children and his wife.

Workman said the last inmate through the door told deputies that Daniel was behind him one moment, and suddenly he was gone.\n\n“It takes a tremendous person to be able to lay their own life down for somebody else. But he did and he was doing it for the right reasons,” Workman said.\n\nAll seven inmates in Daniel’s care survived, Workman said. Two suffered broken legs.\n\nA cousin, Mark Saxton Sr., said Daniel was a native of the Mayfield area that was devastated by the storm.\n\n“He loved his community,” Saxton said. “He was a great family man.

Jackson said her nephew was loving, friendly and always excited to go to daycare. He loved his mom and dad, William Dunbar and Huda Alubahi.\n\nJackson said every time he ate, he said it was \"bussin', bussin',\" which is a popular TikTok phrase that means something is delicious.\n\nAlisha Weatherbee, Jha’lil's second cousin, said he and Julius were at home with Alubahi when the storm approached. The three couldn't get to the basement so they took shelter in the first-floor bathroom. Alubahi's brother was in the living room at the time.\n\nWhen the tornado hit, it pushed the two-story home off the foundation and into the house next door.

Ferguson was kind, caring, reserved, down-to-earth and could connect with anyone, his cousin Jenny Prewitt and her husband, Matthew Prewitt, told The Courier Journal.\n\n\"He was the type of person who would do anything in the world for anybody,\" Matthew Prewitt said. \"From the day I met him he always treated me just like a member of the family &mldr; It leaves a pretty big void.\"\n\nFerguson was passionate about horror movies. He was an amateur writer and director, visited film conventions and hosted Halloween parties. He was planning to remake a low-budget horror movie, \"The Devil's Playground,\" that he filmed in their grandmother's home in 2010, Matthew said.\n\nFerguson was a driver for Carhartt in Madisonville and worked on cars in his spare time. Jenny said since she lost her own father, she planned to ask her cousin to \"carry on the tradition\" and teach her son about cars, but she never got the chance. Ferguson loved his family dearly, she said.\n\nFerguson is the only boy of four, and the only one born in Kentucky. As a child, his sisters used to tease him about \"sending him back\" when they drove by the Greenville hospital he was born in. A few years ago at a relative's funeral, Matthew and their family laughed about a photo of Ferguson and his older sisters from the 1970s during his \"Davy Jones phase,\" Matthew said.

They all loved her.\n\nShe loved Christmas and decorating for the season, never missing an opportunity to see the famous holiday light show in Paducah. Smith, a certified nursing assistant by trade, was born in Fulton.\n\n“If there was one person that walked out of that building, I wanted it to be Kayla,” her friend BJ Rowell told The Post.\n\n- Kala Kachmar\n\nShare this story on Twitter\n\nShare this story on Facebook\n\nEmail this story\n\nLink copied to clipboard\n\nShare this story\n\nCheryl Snodgrass\n\n52, of Muhlenberg County\n\nCheryl Snodgrass will be remembered for her kindness.

She'd kept her father updated on the storm throughout the day, and asked if he'd shelter at her house.\n\n\"None of us can understand exactly why he didn't leave,\" Katrina said. \"He was always real cautious with storms. For some reason, he was stubborn and decided he was going to wait to see how bad it got.\"\n\nSpradling, who owned a flooring business, was a skilled and sought-after carpet-layer who often traveled for his clients. He was a gifted handyman, who would fix incorrectly installed flooring for free.\n\nSpradling also had a son, Bruce, of Paducah. Authorities found his roommate and longtime best friend, 44-year-old Derek Gilbert, about five feet away from him in the wreckage.\n\nKatrina said her father had a fascination with science and technology, and he loved to learn. She recalls many nights staying up late talking and watching YouTube videos about black holes. Spradling also instilled in his children a love for camping and fishing, though work schedules and timing prevented them from taking trips over the past few years, Katrina said.\n\nHe was also an avid gamer and loved classics like Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat and Halo.\n\n\"Some of the best times I can remember were get-togethers on Friday nights where friends and family would all come down and bring Xboxes and TVs,\" she said. \"&mldr; It would be 10 to 16 people all playing.\n\n\"He had a hell of a sense of humor. If he wasn't trying to help someone, he was trying to make someone laugh.\"\n\n- Kala Kachmar\n\nShare this story on Twitter\n\nShare this story on Facebook\n\nEmail this story\n\nLink copied to clipboard\n\nShare this story\n\nDiane Varney\n\n62, of Moorman\n\nDiane Varney, known to many as Ms. Di, died in her daughter's home in Moorman. She was a team leader and 15-year-veteran at the Burger King in Central City, where she was loved by managers, employees and customers alike, her son Ricky Beckman told The Courier Journal.\n\n\"My mom was adored by everybody that knew her,\" he said. \"I didn't realize how much the community loved her until the funeral yesterday.\"\n\nBeckman said his mother had a heart of gold and though she didn't have much, she'd give her last penny or the shirt off her back to help someone in need. Varney moved her two children, Beckman and Jenny Shemwell, to Muhlenberg County from Chicago in 1998 to get them away from the city. She lived for her grandchildren, Ava, 11, Asher, 8, and 4-year-old Abram Shemwell, Beckman said.\n\n\"Her hobbies were being a couch potato — as long as she had her Sonomas (cigarettes), Monster drinks and her grandbabies,\" he said.\n\nBeckman, who has been in recovery since March, said he's going to stay sober to honor his mother.\n\n\"She just wanted me to do right,\" he said. \"Just because something bad happens doesn't mean you have to go back to that lifestyle. She wouldn't want me to go back to the way I was.\"\n\nVarney's family has set up a verified GoFundMe page to pay for her funeral expenses.\n\n- Kala Kachmar\n\nShare this story on Twitter\n\nShare this story on Facebook\n\nEmail this story\n\nLink copied to clipboard\n\nShare this story\n\nJoe Marshall Ward\n\n36, of Mayfield\n\nJoe Marshall Ward, a line leader at the Mayfield candle factory, died when the tornado hit Dec. 10.
