Perry died from an apparent drowning on Saturday, October 28. Police responded to a call of someone in cardiac arrest at a Los Angeles home, where they reportedly found the actor unconscious in a jacuzzi. Ian Ziering, who worked with Perry on Beverly Hills, 90210, took to Instagram, writing, \"RIP Matthew. My heart goes out to his family and all who he was dear to. What a great guy, so sad.\" Before his death, Perry candidly discussed the ups and downs he faced after rising to stardom on Friends. The sitcom, which ran from 1994 to 2004, made Perry a household name for his role as Chandler Bing. Behind the scenes, however, Perry battled addiction after a Jet Ski accident in 1997. Perry became addicted to Vicodin, which eventually led to alcohol abuse. In 2000, he was hospitalized with pancreatitis and ultimately started detoxing while still filming Friends. Over the years, Perry made multiple attempts to get sober. His struggles inspired Perry’s decision to open a sober living home for men in 2013. After entering recovery, Perry detailed his journey in his memoir, Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir. \"So much has been written about me in the past. I thought it was time people heard from me. The highs were high, the lows were low. But I have lived to tell the tale, even though at times it looked like I wouldn’t. And it’s all in here. I apologize it’s not a pop up book,\" he tweeted ahead of the book’s release in November 2022.

I was at a particular place in my career where I needed [to book Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip] very desperately and he, because of his friendship with Amanda Peet, who was my best friend at the time, who was also on the show, they had done a movie together called The Whole Nine Yards,\" she recalled. \"So he asked me to meet him in the parking lot for my final audition, and I got in his car and he ran the whole scene with me multiple times so that I could have a leg up on the other performer. And I did get the job!\"\n\nPaulson added: \"So, I sort of credit him with taking that extra time, and he absolutely did not need to do that.\"\n\nCredit: Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Politicon\n\nBradley Whitford\n\nWhitford and Perry worked together on Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and The West Wing. \"I want his parents to know that Matt was kind. Not just to his costar. To everyone,\" Whitford wrote in a lengthy tribute via social media. \"To honor Matt, I hope we can continue the work that mattered most to him: to open our hearts to so many who share his vulnerabilities, to encourage them to get the help they need, and to give them the love and the support they deserve.\"\n\nCredit: Daniele Venturelli/Getty Images\n\nKate Hudson\n\n\"We played tennis and played more tennis, talked endlessly about trials and tribulations of love and then would talk some more as we would laugh our asses off and then laughed some more,\" Hudson shared via Instagram Story alongside a photo of herself and Perry at an awards show. “I share the same sadness with all our film and TV community who shared time with Matthew. As you can see, to know him was to adore him. I send my love and condolences to his family and his work families. We love you Matthew.”\n\nCredit: Getty Images\n\nJennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer\n\n\"We are all so utterly devastated by the loss of Matthew. We were more than just cast mates. We are a family. There is so much to say, but right now we’re going to take a moment to grieve and process this unfathomable loss,\" the Friends cast told Us in a statement. \"In time we will say more, as and when we are able. For now, our thoughts and our love are with Matty’s family, his friends, and everyone who loved him around the world.\"\n\nCredit: John Lamparski/Getty Images\n\nHank Azaria\n\n\"Matthew was the first friend I made in Los Angeles, when I moved there. I was 21, he was 16,\" Azaria recalled in an Instagram video, calling Perry \"the funniest man ever.\"\n\nAzaria said he and Perry were \"more like brothers\" than friends, adding, \"We drank a lot together, we laughed a lot together, we were there for each other in the early days of our career. ... I'm a sober guy for 17 years, and I wanna say that, the night I went into AA, Matthew brought me in. The whole first year I was sober, we went to meetings together. He was so caring and giving and wise. And he totally helped me get sober.\"\n\nPerry was a comedy \"genius,\" according to Azaria. \"As an actor, he was so brilliant. I just wish we – the world — I and the world — could have gotten what the rest of his career would’ve been,\" he said.\n\nCredit: Joe Scarnici/Getty Images For THR\n\nDoug Draizin\n\nThe Fools Rush In producer reflected on working with Perry on the 1997 rom-com, telling the New York Post, \"We were at the premiere and he's surrounded by Jennifer [Aniston] and the Friends cast and he comes over to me and gives me a hug and says, 'I hope I did you proud.' I looked at him and gave him this big hug and said, 'Thank you,' because it was about my family and my life, and I knew he really wanted to do a good job.\"\n\nCredit: Tibrina Hobson/Getty Images\n\nMorgan Fairchild\n\nThe actress, who played Chandler's mom on Friends, described Perry as a \"warm,\" \"wonderful,\" \"funny\" and \"creative\" person during an appearance on CNN This Morning. \"I think that one of the bravest things that he did in his career and his life was to go public, to write this book, to reach out to other people, to try to be of help to other people,\" she added. \"And that was one of the most endearing things about him.\"\n\nCredit: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images for Adele\n\nAdele\n\n\"It is always so shocking, especially someone that made you laugh and who brought so much joy to your life that you don’t know,” Adele said during her Las Vegas concert hours after Perry's death. “This is what I find so strange, I never met him in my life. There is something, you feel so sad about it especially because you don’t necessarily know what was going on.\"\n\nShe added: “I’ll remember that character for the rest of my life. He’s probably the best comedic character of all time.”\n\nCredit: Stefanie Keenan/Getty Images for Daily Front Row\n\nGwyneth Paltrow\n\n“He was so funny and so sweet and so much fun to be with. We drove out to swim in creeks, had beers in the local college bar, kissed in a field of long grass. It was a magical summer,” the Oscar winner wrote via Instagram. “He had shot the pilot of Friends but it had not aired yet. He was nervous, hoping his big break was just around the corner. It was. We stayed friends for a while until we drifted apart, but I was always happy to see him when I did.”\n\nCredit: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for Hallmark Channel\n\nShannen Doherty\n\n“We were a gang way back. We all grew up together going to the Formosa, North and constantly laughing. Matt, Roger, David, Roxana. We played dare and Matt had to say ridiculous things to girls at the bar. We just always had fun and supported each other,” Doherty wrote via Instagram. “You would always find us all together in a booth speaking in our own made-up language. And yes, Matt always had THAT sense of humor.”\n\nShe continued: “Our friendship spanned a long time. A lifetime really. I know many are hurting, especially our little gang. He will be missed by many and definitely by us. Yes. I could be more poetic or say things better but right now, shock and sadness prevail.”\n\nCredit: Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic\n\nRumer Willis\n\nWillis’ dad, Bruce Willis, worked with Perry on The Whole Nine Yards, The Whole Ten Yards and when Bruce appeared on season 10 of Friends.\n\n\"I'm sad to hear about Matthew Perry passing. When I was a kid and I was on Set while he and my dad were doing whole nine and whole 10 yards he was so kind and funny and sweet with my sisters and me and I think his physical Comedy and that movie still makes me laugh so much,\" Rumer wrote via Instagram. \"I know he had many challenges in his life and brought a lot of joy to people with his comedy. I hope he can rest peacefully.\""
