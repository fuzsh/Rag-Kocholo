        "text": "Fifth Generation\n\n46. Catherine Sophie 'Kate' CROSSMAN was born on 25 Oct 1911 in Victor Harbour, S.A. and died on 30 Dec 1975, at age 64.\n\nNoted events in her life were:\n\n Birth:\n\nCatherine married Frederick Joseph LUSH, son of Eli LUSH and Mary Jane LAVER. Frederick was born on 23 May 1893 in Wincanton, Somerset, England and died on 12 Mar 1972 in Glenside S.A., at age 78.\n\nChildren from this union were:\n\n+ 128 i. John Hamilton LUSH\n\n+ 129 ii. Roger Graham LUSH\n\n47. Douglass Catherine FERGUSON was born on 26 Mar 1907 in Leederville W.A. and died on 19 Sep 1991 in Pinnaroo, S.A., at age 84.\n\nGeneral Notes: Went to school at Parilla Well.\n\nWhen Grandma (Douglass Ferguson) arrived in Pinnaroo in 1910, at the age of three years, one family was living in a dugout cellar. When she was very young, Grandma only went in to Pinnaroo on Show Day and Christmas Eve. School, dances, church services and Sunday School were held in the Parilla Well Hall. She had to walk 21h miles across the paddock to school- around the roads it would have been five miles. She used an iron dropper as a sundial to tell if she was late, early, or on time. If she was early, she would stop at the Inksters for a cup of coffee and a piece of toast. In the winter, she carried a spare pair of socks and shoes in case those she was wearing got wet. At school, there was a string across the fireplace for drying socks. One day, her socks were too close to the fire, and the toes were burnt out. When she was older, Grandma rode a horse part-way to school. She would ride two miles to her uncle's house, then walk the rest of the way with her cousins and others. Later, she and her brother took turns to ride. Her father made a hook for the end of the neck rope so the horse could be hooked on the fence while they opened the gates. On Sundays, when they went to church, their father would take enough chaff to feed the horse during the week. At school, each horse had a special spot where it was tied during school hours. One day, when they were going home from school, a thunder storm came up just as they were passing the old shearing shed, so they stayed in the shed until the storm was over. Grandma's mother was getting worried and wondered where they were. Another afternoon, as - they were riding home, the horse shied, and Grandma fell off, saddle and all. She couldn't catch the horse and had to carry the heavy saddle home. Grandma also had to ride the pony into Pinnaroo for music lessons.\n\n(Compiled from articles written by Catherine and Paul\n\nWurfel when in Year 8 at Pinnaroo Area School)\n\nNoted events in her life were:\n\n Birth:\n\nDouglass married Donald Arthur WURFEL, son of Henry John WURFEL and Agnes Emily KEHN. Donald was born on 27 Jun 1906 in Brim, Vic. and died on 1 Jan 1981 in Pinnaroo, S.A., at age 74.\n\nChildren from this union were:\n\n Marriage Certificate:\n\nGeneral Notes: Born at Brim, a small community North of Waracknabeal Vic. Donald Arthur Wurfel was born on 27th June 1906 at \"Willowbank,\" the old Brim (Victoria) station homestead, and was the third child of Henry and Agnes Wurfel. He was educated at Brim State School, the Longerenong Agricultural College, and the Dookie Agricultural College. In 1926 the \"Border View\" property at Pinnaroo was purchased and on 23rd September 1931, he was married to Douglass Catherine Ferguson, the elder daughter of pioneers James and Ada Ferguson of Pinnaroo. Mr Wurfel was a committeeman, president, honorary life member, and patron of the Pinnaroo Agricultural Society. He was an outstanding exhibitor during the whole of his life at Pinnaroo, being particularly notable in connection with the Grain and Farm Produce and Draught Horse stock sections. His collections of cereals were a feature of the Show and most instructive, and his beautiful horses were greatly admired. He was a most generous donor in work, skill, and finance to innumerable Show projects and to local community institutions. As honorary secretary of the Parilla Well Agricultural Bureau from 1948 until his death, he organised a host of valuable activities including lectures, field days, hogget competitions, conferences, film evenings, shearing schools for young shearers and wool classing schools (the latter two activities in his own shearing shed). For many years he conducted private wheat variety and superphosphate trials which were of great value to local farmers and the industry in general. His persistent advocacy of the wheat varieties Insignia, Heron, and Halberd, which were productive, profitable, and suited to local conditions, did much to further their acceptance despite opposition from some quarters. The immense margin in profitability of these wheats over any other recommended variety of their day, confirmed the wisdom of his counsel. His knowledge of cereals, and particularly of wheat, was prodigious. He assembled what was acknowledged as one of the most comprehensive and remarkable private collections of cereals in Australia if not the world. Part of this collection is housed at Pinnaroo and part at Warracknabeal. One of Mr Wurfel's main achievements was the establishment of the Pinnaroo Farm Machinery Museum. He encountered an appreciable amount of apathy and some opposition to this project, but persisted with it. A large building which houses a fascinating collection of farm implements, tools, and appliances, many of which would otherwise have been lost, stands as a memorial to his foresight and determination. The Pinnaroo Historical Society was founded with the sole object initially, of establishing the Farm Machinery Museum. Mr Wurfel was secretary of the Society from its foundation until his death.\n\nNoted events in his life were:\n\n Birth:\n\nChildren from this union were:\n\n+ 130 i. Ian James WURFEL\n\n+ 131 ii.

Jean Constance (Jenny) DAVIS was born on 30 Mar 1915 in Adelaide S.A. and died on 25 Sep 1976 in W.A., at age 61.\n\nNoted events in her life were:\n\n Birth:\n\nJean married Eric Fleming SMART, son of Percival Horace SMART and Lilian Louise ROGERS. Eric was born on 12 Oct 1911 in Narridy, S.A. and died on 10 Jun 1973 in Dalkeith, W.A., at age 61.\n\nGeneral Notes: Wheat-farmer and grazier, was born on 12 October 1911 at Narridy, South Australia, third child of Australian-born parents Percival Horace Smart, farmer, and his wife Lilian Louise, née Rogers. Educated at Washpool Public School and (as a boarder) at Prince Alfred College, Adelaide, Eric worked on the family farm at Jamestown. By the age of 18 he was share-farming and running a thriving business delivering salt. Responding to a landowner's advertisement in a newspaper calling for a share-farmer with plant, he travelled to Watheroo, Western Australia, in 1935. He had only £200, and spent all but £25 in making a deposit on a tractor and buying a utility truck. The landowner paid for a seeder and fuel, a friend lent a plough, and a lad helped in return for payment after harvest.\n\nWith fair crops but low prices in 1935 and 1936, Smart barely covered his costs. In 1937 an opportunity arose for larger-scale share-farming on Tootra station at Bindi Bindi. A 3500-acre (1416 ha) crop and better prices yielded a profit of £10,000 which became the springboard for further expansion on leased and purchased land. On 15 September 1938 at the Pirie Street Methodist Church, Adelaide, Smart married Jean Constance Davis. He bought Mount Rupert, a 10,000-acre (4047 ha) station at Wongan Hills, Western Australia, in 1940. Six years later his bank invited him to buy 25,000 acres (10,117 ha) near Mingenew, comprising Fairview station, on heavy soil to the east of the town, and an adjoining, virgin, sand-plain block known as The Dip. He renamed the station Erregulla Springs, moved there in 1949 and built a new homestead in 1950. Further purchases of unimproved light land brought the area to 80,000 acres (32,375 ha), in addition to which he leased another 7000 acres (2833 ha) of heavy land.\n\nThe Western Australian blue lupin had been long naturalized and sown on the red soils around Geraldton and Gingin for feeding sheep. Smart showed that, by using superphosphate, lupins would also thrive on sand-plains and build up fertility for cereal cropping. The Department of Agriculture showed little interest in lupins and at first did not share his vision or welcome his field-days. For his part, Smart supported scientific research and hosted departmental trials at Erregulla Springs which showed how, after initial fertility build-up, introduced clovers gave a more diversified and productive agriculture. The practices pioneered included aerial spraying of insects and fertilising of cereals with nitrogen.\n\nIn 1950 the grain production from Smart's properties set an Australian individual record of 102,000 three-bushel bags (8200 tons). This figure regularly increased and passed 500,000 bushels (13,400 tons) in 1967. That year Smart also produced nearly 3000 bales of wool from 105,000 sheep. By 1955 Erregulla Springs had twenty-four houses and a resident population of 120; it boasted a swimming-pool, a tennis-court, a cricket field and a community bus.\n\nSmart detailed his methods and philosophy in a booklet, West Australian Wasteland Transformed (Geraldton, 1960). Two points stood out. First, the importance of appreciating the value of labour\\emdash to look after one's employees, to pay them well, and to give credit where due. Second, the need to make the best use of machinery. Underlying his success was a firm Protestant ethic, born of his Methodist background, of hard work, integrity, and community involvement. He served on the Wongan-Ballidu (1947-49) and the Mingenew (1950-56 and 1958-60) road boards, and on the Mingenew Shire Council (1961-67). In 1955 he was appointed O.B.E. He was knighted in 1966.\n\nOf middle height and solid build, with brown receding hair and a florid complexion, Sir Eric had piercing blue eyes. He possessed restless energy, a quick mind and the capacity for lightning calculation. Although generous, he could be impatient. Devoted to his family, he loved tennis, golf, the company of friends, travel, his pipe, a fine cigar and a good whisky. Ill health forced him into semi-retirement in Perth in 1966. Survived by his wife, and their son and two daughters, he died of a coronary occlusion on 10 June 1973 at his Dalkeith home and was cremated with Anglican rites. He bequeathed $200,000 to the University of Western Australia for continued research on the West Midlands light lands, with particular attention to the role of lupins.\n\nNoted events in his life were:\n\n Birth:\n\nChildren from this union were:\n\n+ 149 i.
