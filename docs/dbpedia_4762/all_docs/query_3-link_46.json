        "text": "The death occurred peacefully at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital on Monday, August 26, 2024 of Christopher Edward Phillis of Charlottetown, age 89 years. Beloved husband of Valerie (nee Ansell), father of Paul, and proud Granddad of Robin, Eliza (Luc) and Thomas (Amanda) and great-granddad of Miriam. Predeceased by sons Carl and Peter Phillis.\n\nA renowned international sculptor, his works are prominently displayed across PEI and abroad.\n\nResting at MacLean Funeral Home Swan Chapel from where the service will be held on Thursday at 1:30 p.m. Interment in Peoples Cemetery.

Her life was marked by a loving commitment to her children, family members, and as a quiet devout supporter to her community, and province.\n\nIn earlier years, Margaret taught school for one year to acquire more formal education. While attending Acadia University to further her studies, she played hockey, piano and enjoyed the many social connections of campus life. The diversity from rural life along with the university setting spurred her pursuit of higher education throughout her entire life. She attended Toronto Western Hospital in Ontario to complete a certification as a Canadian Registered Laboratory Technologist/Professional. After employment at the Toronto Western Hospital, she moved back to PEI and worked at the Prince Edward Hospital and later to the provincial laboratory in Haematology. She later became the Department Head for the Immunology Department at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital.\n\nHer quiet, yet self-disciplined ways led to awards and expanding interests for others. Margaret's dry yet quiet sense of humor would appear when appropriate, and her demeanor led to stimulating others to develop such things as a school band, library, and in becoming a PEI Director for CSLT(CSMLS). These items combined garnered her an award as Mrs. Chatelaine Runners-Up in Canada in the 1960s and later receiving an Award of Merit from The Canadian Hard of Hearing Association while her involvement with medical laboratory technology led her to receiving the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.\n\nHer career spanned over 39 years and her personal interests included passions such as art, gardening, medical lab history, and as part of a committee ensured Hard of Hearing was resourced properly in areas such as hospitals through her volunteer work well into her senior years. She remained a member of the Canadian Society for Medical Laboratory Science (CSMLS) at the time of her passing. Throughout her working life she had published medical related papers, including developing tests still used today, and was well known for adhering to privacy policies in Health Care. Margaret was an elder at the Cornwall United Church, now renamed to West River Church and carried a lifelong strong and resilient faith.\n\nMargaret was a devoted mother, grandmother, sister, aunt and wife. Predeceased by her husband, Colin J MacPhail, they raised two children, Ian MacPhail (Rosalind) and Ellen MacPhail (Greg MacKay) and ensured they obtained well rounded opportunities. In her retirement years, she had a keen interest in her 2 grandchildren, Jenilyn DeLong (Shawn) and Ryan MacPhail (Janice) and 2 cherished great-grandchildren, Katelyn and Aiden MacPhail. Her step grandchildren of David, Mark and Carrie Howell also held a special place in her heart. Margaret was born on July 9, 1930 in Hampton, PEI as one of six children to Boyd MacQuarrie and May Monkley. She is predeceased by brothers William, Ray, and sisters Annie and Muriel. Margaret's younger sister Sarah MacQuarrie mourns the loss of her sister, along with a large extended family of nieces and nephews, friends, and neighbours.\n\nThe family sends special thanks to Norma MacLean and Queen Elizabeth Hospital. In lieu of flowers and if so desired, memorial donations can be directed to the QEH Foundation or West River Church. Private funeral by request. Arrangements entrusted to MacLean Funeral Home Swan Chapel. Online condolences may be made at www.macleanfh.com\n\nDonations may be forwarded directly to:\n\nQueen Elizabeth Hospital Foundation\n\nPO Box 6600\n\nCharlottetown\n\nPrince Edward Island\n\nC1A 8T5\n\nPh: 902-894-2425\n\nWest River United Church\n\nPO Box 89\n\nCornwall\n\nPrince Edward Island\n\nCOA 1HO\n\nPh: 902-566-4052\n\nClifford Kelley passed away peacefully with family at his side at the Mount Nursing Home in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island on Thursday, August 8, 2024.\n\nHe was born in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia on September 15, 1931. He was the son of the late Clifford and Hilda (Wyman) Kelley.\n\nIn addition to his parents, Clifford was predeceased by his beloved wife of 63 years, Shirley, his sister Marjorie, his brother George and his grandson Jack.\n\nClifford is survived by his children John (Stacey), Susan, Thomas (Marsha) and Robert (Inge); grandchildren Stephen (Meaghan), Tyler (Victoria), Sean, Kate, Neil (Kaya), Andie and Joe; great grandchildren Bryn, Beckett and Zoe.\n\nHe was an avid sports fan playing both baseball and basketball in his youth and enjoyed cheering on his grandchildren at various sporting events.\n\nClifford began his career as a purser on the Blue Nose ferry from Yarmouth to Maine and spent over thirty years with the Marine Atlantic organization, ending his career as a vice-president of Marine Atlantic.\n\nThe family would like to thank the dedicated staff at The Mount for their loving care of Clifford over the past several years.\n\nResting at Fair Haven Funeral Home with visitation on Thursday, August 15 from 6:00 to 8:00 pm.

Loving and dedicated husband to Kari (nee Dennis) and proud Dad to Cameron and Caleb. Beloved son of Jackie (nee Roach) and the late Ross Matheson and brother of Robbie (Kelli), Jeffrey (Lesley) and Timmy (Karla). Uncle Joey to Colby, Lauryn, Ben, Gracie, Ella, Jack, Beau, and Ross. Cherished son-in-law of Arnold and Marsha Dennis and best brother-in-law to Michael Dennis. Fondly remembered by grandmother-in-law Grace Swan, aunts, uncles, cousins, and a wide circle of friends.\n\nJoey was a worker and a do’er, if it was cutting grass or gardening, he did it with care. He brought the same level of perfection and eye to detail to his work at the Provincial Palliative Care Centre. It was so important to Joey that the families being cared for had a tidy, beautiful place to walk, sit and enjoy.\n\nJoey was the first person who friends and family called - whether they needed carpentry work done, decks built, landscaping, or chowder and cookies baked. He was there and always ready to take on the challenge.\n\nJoey’s best times were spent on the golf course with his brothers or friends, sharing old stories.\n\nHis devotion to minor hockey was endless and many trips were made up and down the roads of PEI in the Dodge Caravan with a van full of boys. Many friendships were made over the years with his involvement in sport.\n\nThe loves of Joey’s life were his family: Kari and his two boys. He would be so happy just to spend time with the boys. He was an amazing father who gave love so easily – whether it was teaching Cam how to drive or making sure Caleb’s (aka Reg) hair was just perfect. Everything was done with love.\n\nJoey and Kari’s favourite way to spend time was at the beach. He loved the peace of the beach, along with long days at Rocky Point, laughing and telling stories.\n\nResting at MacLean Funeral Home Swan Chapel. Funeral Saturday at 11:00 a.m. from Park Royal United Church. For those wishing to attend virtually, the service will be live-streamed on the church's YouTube channel. Interment in Sherwood Cemetery. If so desired, memorial donations may be made directly to KidSport PEI. Visiting hours Friday from 4:00 – 7:00 p.m. Online condolences may be made at www.macleanfh.com\n\nIt is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of our beloved wife, mother, grandmother, sister, aunt and treasured friend, in the early morning on August 3, 2024.\n\nNancy was born on January 27th, 1946 in North Sydney, Nova Scotia, the eldest child of Ruth (Vincent) Roberts and Dr Athol L. Roberts. Her love of travel was sparked in childhood, by her father’s career taking the family to many places in Canada and abroad. When they settled in Charlottetown, PEI, in 1961, Nancy met the greatest love of her life: Billie Prowse. Nancy and Bill started their 61year marriage at the tender ages of 17 years and 20 years on September 7, 1963. Nancy considered their relationship both the greatest blessing and a source of immeasurable joy; how she loved to tease Bill. If there was a prank to be had, she would find a way to play it on Bill, eliciting support from her children, family and friends. So many memories of obliging her folly and witnessing comedy in Dad’s reaction.\n\nNancy and Bill were blessed with two children, Rob Prowse (Ryan Ervin) and Karen Comeau (Michael); four grandchildren, Jeremy (Katelyn Samson), Emilie (Noah Anthony), Dash and Emme; and four siblings Susan Roberts (Jack Weanus), David Roberts (Susan) with whom she had a close relationship, Linda McTaggart (Doug), and HuiJun Ding (Julian); as well as many nieces and nephews. Nancy was predeceased by her parents Dr. Athol and Ruth (Vincent) Roberts and parents-in-law Dr. L. E. and Pauline Prowse.\n\nFamily was everything to Nancy. Although her children were the beneficiaries of her warmth, generous and curious spirit, so were her nieces and nephews and grandchildren. When each of them turned 8 years old, a special weeklong trip was planned that was educational, fun and filled with adventure. Although many of the nieces and nephews are in their 40s, they continue to reflect on this time with Aunt Nancy and Uncle Bill as a wonderful childhood memory.\n\nAs a Navy couple, Nancy developed many enduring relationships along the way, wherever they lived and travelled; always welcoming people of all ages into their home, particularly those who were displaced from family during the holidays. She was most happy sharing a delicious meal, a few beverages, and love and laughter among friends and family. Nancy so enjoyed a full table and an opportunity for fellowship.\n\nIn 1997, the Prowse couple returned to PEI and Nancy rekindled friendships from years gone by and developed new community bonds where she lived and thrived, Cornwall and Stratford. Nancy also spent time volunteering with the Confederation Gift Shop and with the Provincial Palliative Care Centre. Her attention to details and her engaging way made people feel loved, cared for and valued. Nancy demonstrated these beautiful qualities in all aspects of her life.\n\nVisitation will be held on Thursday, August 8 from 3pm – 6pm, and a Celebration of Life will be held on Friday, August 9 at 11 am, all at MacLean Funeral Home Swan Chapel. For those wishing to attend virtually, the celebration of life will be live-streamed at https://event.forgetmenotceremonies.com/ceremony?c=813ef18c-94b8-4f82-9de5-a434fa87f0bf Interment in Sherwood Cemetery.

Blanche met Prime Ministers, Veteran Affairs Ministers, Premiers, CBC personnel and many newspaper reporters with the same enthusiasm every time she donned her WWII Medals and showed up for a Veterans event or was asked to share her story.\n\nHer memory remained intact right to her last moments with us, and she will be remembered forever for her numerous contributions to remind all of us to \"Never Forget\" a Veteran. Blanche's Prince Edward Home family were an integral part of her joy for life and longevity. Everyday was a gift for Blanche and the love and care she received as a Resident at PE Home contributed to her ability to thrive in a long-term care environment, even when she \"rolled her eyes too loud\" sometimes.\n\nResting at MacLean Funeral Home Swan Chapel.
