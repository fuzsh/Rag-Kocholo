        "text": "BRIDGETON â€“ The final time Dreu Ferguson Sr.'s voice was allegedly heard by anyone other than Dreu Ferguson Jr. was when he told his girlfriend Amber Henley to go outside while he argued with his father in their Millville home, according to testimony from Henley on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nMuch of testimony in the second day of Dreu Ferguson Jr.'s murder trial revolved around the disappearance of his father, who was found dead and buried in a crawl space beneath the rear porch of his Maple Street home in May 2009.\n\nFerguson Jr., 39, is charged with his murder; disturbing, desecrating or concealing human remains; tampering with evidence; and terroristic threats in connection with the death of Dreu Ferguson Sr.\n\n\"He asked me to go outside while him and his dad had an argument,\" Henley said. The Millville woman said she then walked out on the back porch, and remained for an unknown amount of time. Henley allegedly didn't see Ferguson Sr. alive again.\n\nFerguson Jr. was arrested May 26, 2009 after police found his father's body buried beneath the back porch of his home. Lime was found on his boots and his father's body.\n\nLime was mentioned in a phone conversation between Henley and Ferguson Jr. shortly after he was incarcerated on terroristic threats and illegal burial charges in connection with his father's death. That portion of the call was played in court Wednesday by Assistant Prosecutor Jonathan Flynn.\n\n\"Did you buy the lime?\" Henley asked.\n\n\"Huh,\" replied Ferguson Jr.\n\n\"Did you buy the lime or did dad buy the lime?\" said Henley.\n\n\"What lime?\" asked Ferguson Jr.\n\nHe then asked if his dad was buried in lime. Henley told him it was reported on the news that he was.\n\nTwo of Ferguson Jr.'s uncles, current and former members of the Millville police department, a former sanitation worker and a former Cumberland County Jail inmate also testified Wednesday.\n\nHarry Amwake, who spent a month in the county jail with the suspect in July 2009, said they often spoke about Ferguson Sr.'s death.\n\nAmwake said they talked about \"mistakes he made.\" He said Ferguson Jr. told him the biggest mistake was \"not getting rid of his dad's car.\"\n\nAmwake said Ferguson Jr. told him the prosecution would have a tough case against him.\n\nWhen asked by Flynn why it would've been tough, Amwake said, \"For the simple reason that nobody's seen him do anything.\"\n\nBut Amwake replied \"no\" when asked by defense attorney Timothy Reilly if the suspect ever mentioned killing his father.\n\nFerguson Jr.'s uncles Kurt and Bruce told jurors their concerns about their brother's whereabouts when he disappeared six years ago.\n\nKurt Ferguson said Ferguson Sr. called him from his locked car the morning of May 12, 2009 to say the defendant threatened to kill him.\n\n\"He sounded distraught, like he was really distressed,\" Kurt Ferguson said. \"I told him to call the police.\"\n\nHe said they spoke twice later that day, and said Ferguson Sr. sounded more relaxed.\n\nBut Kurt Ferguson alerted his brother Bruce when he hadn't heard from Ferguson Sr. about a week later. The same day he was told by Kurt, Bruce Ferguson traveled to the Maple Street home with police, but there were no signs of Dreu Ferguson Sr.\n\nMillville police Officer Charles Twigg and former Millville detective Keith O'Brien discussed the demeanor of Ferguson Jr. when he first spoke to authorities, and the nature of the crawl space before Ferguson Sr.'s body was found.\n\nJeraldo Cotto is a former sanitation worker who regularly picked up trash from the Maple Street home. During his testimony he discussed finding three empty bags that still had residue from a grayish-white substance in a trash can around the period Dreu Ferguson Sr. went missing.\n\nThe elder Ferguson was 58 years old when he died.\n\nFerguson Jr. wasn't charged with murder until 2011 after results came back from extensive forensics tests.\n\nHenley will take the stand again this morning to be cross-examined. Medical examiner Ian Hood also is expected to testify today."
