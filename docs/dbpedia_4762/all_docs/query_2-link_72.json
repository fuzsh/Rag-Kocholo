        "text": "Clifford Kelley passed away peacefully with family at his side at the Mount Nursing Home in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island on Thursday, August 8, 2024.\n\nHe was born in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia on September 15, 1931. He was the son of the late Clifford and Hilda (Wyman) Kelley.\n\nIn addition to his parents, Clifford was predeceased by his beloved wife of 63 years, Shirley, his sister Marjorie, his brother George and his grandson Jack.\n\nClifford is survived by his children John (Stacey), Susan, Thomas (Marsha) and Robert (Inge); grandchildren Stephen (Meaghan), Tyler (Victoria), Sean, Kate, Neil (Kaya), Andie and Joe; great grandchildren Bryn, Beckett and Zoe.\n\nHe was an avid sports fan playing both baseball and basketball in his youth and enjoyed cheering on his grandchildren at various sporting events.\n\nClifford began his career as a purser on the Blue Nose ferry from Yarmouth to Maine and spent over thirty years with the Marine Atlantic organization, ending his career as a vice-president of Marine Atlantic.\n\nThe family would like to thank the dedicated staff at The Mount for their loving care of Clifford over the past several years.\n\nResting at Fair Haven Funeral Home with visitation on Thursday, August 15 from 6:00 to 8:00 pm. A funeral service will take place at the Chapel of Fair Haven on Friday, August 16 at 2:00 pm followed by a reception in the Garden View Reception Room. Interment in Fair Haven Cemetery.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made to IWK Children’s Hospital Foundation or to a charity of the donors’ choice.\n\nArrangements are entrusted to Fair Haven Funeral Home, 1177 Salisbury Road, Moncton (506) 404-0898.\n\nIn the early morning hours of Monday, August 5, 2024, Joseph Daniel “Joey” Matheson, age 48 years, passed away at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Loving and dedicated husband to Kari (nee Dennis) and proud Dad to Cameron and Caleb. Beloved son of Jackie (nee Roach) and the late Ross Matheson and brother of Robbie (Kelli), Jeffrey (Lesley) and Timmy (Karla). Uncle Joey to Colby, Lauryn, Ben, Gracie, Ella, Jack, Beau, and Ross. Cherished son-in-law of Arnold and Marsha Dennis and best brother-in-law to Michael Dennis. Fondly remembered by grandmother-in-law Grace Swan, aunts, uncles, cousins, and a wide circle of friends.\n\nJoey was a worker and a do’er, if it was cutting grass or gardening, he did it with care. He brought the same level of perfection and eye to detail to his work at the Provincial Palliative Care Centre. It was so important to Joey that the families being cared for had a tidy, beautiful place to walk, sit and enjoy.\n\nJoey was the first person who friends and family called - whether they needed carpentry work done, decks built, landscaping, or chowder and cookies baked. He was there and always ready to take on the challenge.\n\nJoey’s best times were spent on the golf course with his brothers or friends, sharing old stories.\n\nHis devotion to minor hockey was endless and many trips were made up and down the roads of PEI in the Dodge Caravan with a van full of boys. Many friendships were made over the years with his involvement in sport.\n\nThe loves of Joey’s life were his family: Kari and his two boys. He would be so happy just to spend time with the boys. He was an amazing father who gave love so easily – whether it was teaching Cam how to drive or making sure Caleb’s (aka Reg) hair was just perfect. Everything was done with love.\n\nJoey and Kari’s favourite way to spend time was at the beach. He loved the peace of the beach, along with long days at Rocky Point, laughing and telling stories.\n\nResting at MacLean Funeral Home Swan Chapel. Funeral Saturday at 11:00 a.m. from Park Royal United Church. For those wishing to attend virtually, the service will be live-streamed on the church's YouTube channel. Interment in Sherwood Cemetery. If so desired, memorial donations may be made directly to KidSport PEI. Visiting hours Friday from 4:00 – 7:00 p.m. Online condolences may be made at www.macleanfh.com\n\nIt is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of our beloved wife, mother, grandmother, sister, aunt and treasured friend, in the early morning on August 3, 2024.\n\nNancy was born on January 27th, 1946 in North Sydney, Nova Scotia, the eldest child of Ruth (Vincent) Roberts and Dr Athol L. Roberts. Her love of travel was sparked in childhood, by her father’s career taking the family to many places in Canada and abroad. When they settled in Charlottetown, PEI, in 1961, Nancy met the greatest love of her life: Billie Prowse. Nancy and Bill started their 61year marriage at the tender ages of 17 years and 20 years on September 7, 1963. Nancy considered their relationship both the greatest blessing and a source of immeasurable joy; how she loved to tease Bill. If there was a prank to be had, she would find a way to play it on Bill, eliciting support from her children, family and friends. So many memories of obliging her folly and witnessing comedy in Dad’s reaction.\n\nNancy and Bill were blessed with two children, Rob Prowse (Ryan Ervin) and Karen Comeau (Michael); four grandchildren, Jeremy (Katelyn Samson), Emilie (Noah Anthony), Dash and Emme; and four siblings Susan Roberts (Jack Weanus), David Roberts (Susan) with whom she had a close relationship, Linda McTaggart (Doug), and HuiJun Ding (Julian); as well as many nieces and nephews. Nancy was predeceased by her parents Dr. Athol and Ruth (Vincent) Roberts and parents-in-law Dr. L. E. and Pauline Prowse.\n\nFamily was everything to Nancy. Although her children were the beneficiaries of her warmth, generous and curious spirit, so were her nieces and nephews and grandchildren. When each of them turned 8 years old, a special weeklong trip was planned that was educational, fun and filled with adventure. Although many of the nieces and nephews are in their 40s, they continue to reflect on this time with Aunt Nancy and Uncle Bill as a wonderful childhood memory.\n\nAs a Navy couple, Nancy developed many enduring relationships along the way, wherever they lived and travelled; always welcoming people of all ages into their home, particularly those who were displaced from family during the holidays. She was most happy sharing a delicious meal, a few beverages, and love and laughter among friends and family. Nancy so enjoyed a full table and an opportunity for fellowship.\n\nIn 1997, the Prowse couple returned to PEI and Nancy rekindled friendships from years gone by and developed new community bonds where she lived and thrived, Cornwall and Stratford. Nancy also spent time volunteering with the Confederation Gift Shop and with the Provincial Palliative Care Centre. Her attention to details and her engaging way made people feel loved, cared for and valued. Nancy demonstrated these beautiful qualities in all aspects of her life.\n\nVisitation will be held on Thursday, August 8 from 3pm – 6pm, and a Celebration of Life will be held on Friday, August 9 at 11 am, all at MacLean Funeral Home Swan Chapel. For those wishing to attend virtually, the celebration of life will be live-streamed at https://event.forgetmenotceremonies.com/ceremony?c=813ef18c-94b8-4f82-9de5-a434fa87f0bf Interment in Sherwood Cemetery. If so desired, memorial donations may be made directly to the QEH Foundation (Cancer Treatment Centre) or the Provincial Palliative Care Centre. Online condolences may be made at www.macleanfh.com\n\nDonations may be mailed directly to:\n\nQEH Foundation (Cancer Treatment Centre) PO Box 6600 Charlottetown Prince Edward Island C1A 8T5 Ph: 902-894-2425\n\nProvincial Palliative Care Centre 93 Murchison Lane Charlottetown Prince Edward Island C1A 0G3 Ph: 902-368-4781\n\nPeacefully at Prince Edward Home in Charlottetown, PEI on August 1, 2024 in her 102nd year, in the arms of her loving daughter Barbara, son-in-law David and dearest friend Brenda Doucette, Blanche (Landry) Bennett surrendered her soul to her Heavenly Father.\n\nBorn in Summerside, PEI November 12, 1922 to Matilda (Wedge) and Joseph Landry, Blanche is survived by her daughters, Barbara Spence (David), Joan MacNeil (Adrian), and Patty Bennett (Aubrey), as well as her sister, Elma Sonier.\n\nPredeceased by her husband of 61 years Murray Earl Bennett, her parents, brothers Alban, Clarence “Cappy”, Henry and Tanton Landry and her sister Stella Clough.\n\nA proud WWII Veteran, Blanche served in the Canadian Women's Army Corps 1942-1945 as a Switchboard Operator with Signals Sqn. in Halifax NS, where she met her husband Murray (RCN) at a dance.\n\nAs a military spouse for the next 60 years, Blanche relocated 28 times in Canada and overseas as well, when Murray was posted to #1 Wing RCAF Station Marville, France in 1955. Blanche met Prime Ministers, Veteran Affairs Ministers, Premiers, CBC personnel and many newspaper reporters with the same enthusiasm every time she donned her WWII Medals and showed up for a Veterans event or was asked to share her story.\n\nHer memory remained intact right to her last moments with us, and she will be remembered forever for her numerous contributions to remind all of us to \"Never Forget\" a Veteran. Blanche's Prince Edward Home family were an integral part of her joy for life and longevity. Everyday was a gift for Blanche and the love and care she received as a Resident at PE Home contributed to her ability to thrive in a long-term care environment, even when she \"rolled her eyes too loud\" sometimes.\n\nResting at MacLean Funeral Home Swan Chapel. A Mass of Christian Burial will be held on Tuesday at 2:00 p.m. from St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church, Cornwall, PE. Interment in St. Martin of Tours Cemetery, Cumberland, PE. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made directly to St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Women’s League (PO Box 219 Cornwall, PE C0A 1H0). No visitation by personal request.

Bernice Bell of Charlottetown, formerly of Ontario, age 95 years. Beloved wife of the late Claude S. Bell. Fondly remembered by extended family, cherished friends, former colleagues and generations of students. Predeceased by her parents Charles and Hazel (Billing) Copson and sisters Gwen Adams and Beth McEachern.\n\nA life-long learner, Bernice relished time spent in her grandfather’s library, as a student at the University of Toronto, and later as a professor of social work and gerontology.\n\nShe and Claude enjoyed their annual visits to PEI, before retiring to the Island in 1991. They also enjoyed their winter travels to Barbados.\n\nA lover of music, Bernice spent decades singing in the church choir. She always had her stereo or radio on, with classical music flooding the room.\n\nBernice was a fierce advocate and passionate about numerous issues. She was a friend to all animals, especially her Siamese cats and rescue feline “Kitty 1”. She was often found feeding her feathered friends at the bird feeders at her home on Hillsborough St.\n\nA very special thank you to the residents and staff of the Dr. John Gillis Lodge for enriching Bernice’s life this last year.\n\nResting at MacLean Funeral Home Swan Chapel from where the funeral will be held on Monday at 10:00 a.m. Interment later in Kettleby Cemetery, Ontario.
