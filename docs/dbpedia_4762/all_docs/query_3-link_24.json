His early years after graduation were dominated by war service with the Royal Army Medical Corps. He was attached to the Tank Corps, always near considerable action in north Africa, Sicily, Italy, the Normandy landings, and the advance into the Low Countries and Germany. In 1941 he was awarded an immediate Military Cross for his activities in north Africa and was twice mentioned in dispatches. He always said that the war cured him of any desire to be a surgeon and after demobilisation he quickly obtained the MRCP and developed an interest in cardiology. Throughout his consultant career he was an enthusiastic teacher.Charlie had a strong Christian faith, was closely involved with the Christian Medical Fellowship and the University Christian Union, and after retirement remained busy with church affairs, serving as president of the Baptist Union. He was a keen golfer and hill walker. He leaves a wife, Kathleen, and a son and daughter (also a doctor).\n\nRobert Lewis (“Robin”) Ferguson\n\nFormer general practitioner Bromsgrove (b Cairo, where his father was professor of pathology, 1914; q St Andrews 1938), d 23 March 1998. He served as a surgeon lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and was mentioned in dispatches for bravery during HMS Devonshire’s voyage to bring King Haakon from Norway to Britain in 1940. After the war he was a general practitioner in Oxford before becoming chief medical officer to Cadburys, then returning to general practice. His best tribute is the continuing postbag from grateful patients, and he always maintained that there is no certainty in medicine, believing in listening to patients and spending time with them. A gifted sportsman, he played hooker for Scottish Schoolboys against England in 1931: Scotland won. He was champion welterweight at school, university, and the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. In retirement he added woodcarving to his skill as a draughtsman. He leaves two children and five grandchildren.\n\nby Duncan Ferguson\n\nRalph Wales Gould\n\nFormer general practitioner Bolton (b North Shields 1925; q Durham 1948), d 2 April 1998. The only non-architect in the Architectural Society at university, he had a lifelong passion for the subject, while in retirement he made a considerable contribution to the Imperial War Museum’s project of recording war memorials. Predeceased by his elder daughter (also a doctor), he leaves a wife, Margaret, and daughter.\n\nby M Gould and E Gould\n\nFrederick John Sambrook Gowar\n\nConsultant thoracic surgeon Grampian region 1947-75 (b London 1910; q Middlesex 1932; FRCS; VRD), died after a stroke on 24 March 1998. After qualifying he trained in thoracic surgery at the Brompton and The London Hospitals with Tudor Edwards and Price Thomas. He was called up in 1939, serving as a surgical specialist in the Royal Navy, mostly in the Far East. D-Day found him anchored off Sword Beach under enemy fire performing an emergency appendicectomy on the chief officer of his tank landing craft, the mess dining table serving as an operating table. In Scotland his first responsibility was to set up a surgical thoracic service for patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Because of the widening scope of thoracic surgery and the increasing incidence of lung carcinoma he set up a unit at Woodend Hospital. His operating technique was so refined that he was one of the few surgeons willing to undertake thoracic surgery on Jehovah’s Witnesses. One of the first surgeons to recognise the link between smoking and carcinoma of the lung, he made considerable efforts to publicise this. He was an enthusiastic golfer, the high spot of his career being a hole in one during a Medical Golf Society competition, and he continued this in retirement together with devoting time to his local church. He leaves a wife, Mary; two daughters and a son; and 10 grandchildren (including a geneticist and a medical student).\n\nby Elizabeth Sharwood-Smith, Geoffrey Sharwood-Smith and Susan Oussedik\n\nBrian Kenneth Higton\n\nGeneral practitioner Lancaster 1971-97 (b Manchester 1941; q Manchester 1964; FRCOG), died of metastatic sarcoma on 8 February 1998. Initially trained in obstetrics, he maintained an interest in this, being a hospital practitioner at Westmoreland County Hospital in Kendal. He was a trainer in general practice for many years, but relinquished this five years ago because of his illness (which he called “a bit of a bugger”) and because he felt vocational training was becoming too regimented. Brian was renowned for his organisational abilities (arranging his own funeral) and for his generosity in staying to help the practice through a difficult time of change. A good all round sportsman and gifted musician, he was a founder member of the Lancaster Singers, a chamber choir set up in 1975. Tragically Brian’s wife, Margaret, died two weeks before him, and he leaves two sons.\n\nby D J Longden\n\nPeter Warren Jackson\n\nConsultant anaesthetist Manchester Royal Infirmary 1968-95 (b Glossop 1935; q Manchester 1959; FRCA), died after heart surgery on 23 July 1997. A keen sportsman, he represented the university at pistol shooting and golf. At Manchester he became an innovative cardiac anaesthetist at an early stage in the development of the subspecialty. One of his main introductions was neuroleptanalgesia, which was being pioneered on the continent. He also undertook the anaesthesia for ophthalmic operating sessions of interminable length and for chair dental surgery in one of the most socially deprived areas of the city. It is difficult to see how he found time to write several articles, edit a textbook for trainees, and to serve as administrative head of the department and president of the section of anaesthesia of Manchester Medical Society. At the age of 52 the renal problems of his youth eventually necessitated a kidney transplant, which gave him 10 extra years of life. He relished the opportunity to take part in the national transplant games, in both golf and bowls, and started flying lessons, but was prevented from carrying on because of hypertension. After early retirement his transplant failed, but he adjusted to nocturnal peritoneal dialysis before a rapidly deteriorating aortic valve required surgery, which he did not survive. He leaves a wife, Sue; four children from a previous marriage; and seven grandchildren.\n\nby D G D Davidson and S G Greenhough\n\nGerald O’Gorman\n\nFormer consultant psychiatrist (b London 1916; q Guy’s 1940; FRCP, FRCPsych), d 2 March 1998. Educated by the Jesuits, he bucked his family theatrical tradition by studying medicine. After working at Broadmoor Hospital and in the Royal Army Medical Corps in the second world war he became one of the early and unashamedly paternalistic medical superintendents at Reading, championing the patients and their need for occupation and self respect. He set up Smith Hospital, Henley, out of his interest in autistic children, and was involved in working parties looking at criteria for the diagnosis of autism and on setting up mental handicap services for England and Ireland. He spent three years as medical superintendent of Warneford Hospital, Oxford, overseeing the planning of the professorial department in 1970. An articulate man of warmth and energy, he regarded youth and enthusiasm as much more valuable than age and experience, and was active in medical politics, enlivening committee meetings and making stands against NHS bureaucracy. He worked until his late 70s and refused to be restricted by blindness and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, writing novels and playing golf until his last few months. Predeceased by his first wife, he leaves a second wife, Katie, and five children (two doctors).\n\nby K Friend\n\nWilfred Allen (“Bill”) Oliver\n\nFormer consultant physician and cardiologist United Norwich Hospitals (b Croydon 1913; q St Bartholomew’s 1936; MD, FRCP; MBE), died after prolonged ill health due to complications of cerebral and peripheral vascular disease on 22 January 1998. During the war he served in the Royal Army Medical Corps, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. One of his hospital camps was taken over by Rommel but left undisturbed because German prisoners were being treated alongside British soldiers. Bill was so shocked by a subsequent visit to Belsen concentration camp that he was unable to talk about it. At Norwich his careful investigation of patients, together with the help of his surgical colleague, led to one of the earliest peripheral centres for cardiac surgery in Britain, and he also developed screening of children for cardiac disorders and a cardiac arrest programme. A tall imposing man, he was in many ways retiring and formal, addressing his female patients as “Ma’am” and his juniors as “Doctor.” He enjoyed sailing his Dragon, becoming commodore of the Royal Norfolk and Suffolk Yacht Club, and his love of high powered cars was well known to passengers and police alike. Predeceased by his first wife, Daisy, he leaves a second wife, Pamela (his medical assistant in cardiology); a son and daughter from his first marriage; and four grandchildren.\n\nby N Alan Green and John H Simpson\n\nJohn William (“Jack”) O’Sullivan\n\nFormer examining doctor Civil Aviation Authority (b Cork, where his father was a consultant ophthalmologist; q Cork 1967; CAOM), died of a lymphoma on 13 November 1997. After house jobs in Jersey Jack joined a group practice there, which allowed him to continue his interest in anaesthetics and flying. Before long his spare time was exclusively occupied in aviation and then aviation medicine occupied much of his working day. He pitted his skills against others in air rallies, with great success, notably the Paris-Dakar on two occasions and also a transatlantic rally. On many occasions he helped retrieve islanders who had fallen ill or been involved in accidents overseas, and he also helped set up a service for transporting organ transplants in Britain. His last years were dogged by ill health, first with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura as a result of a tick bite in Algeria and then by the development of a lymphoma. Predeceased by his wife, Vivienne, he leaves two daughters (one a doctor) and a son.\n\nby Margaret Bruce and Donald Fullerton\n\nDavid Stuart\n\nGeneral practitioner Great Yarmouth 1959-91(b 1931; q Leeds 1955; MD, FRCGP), died of carcinoma of the colon on 18 January 1998. My father was a man of considerable intellectual talent, and after service in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve he joined my mother in practice. He was one of the founders of the Norfolk Vocational Training scheme in 1968 and subsequently served on the regional hospital board and as a regional adviser. He was also a hospital practitioner in dermatology, inheriting this interest from his father, and early on his practice had a full primary healthcare team. His other great passion was for antique glass, and he was an expert on 18th century English drinking glasses, publishing a monograph on Norfolk glass very recently. He managed to visit at least one antique shop a day on his rounds. His other interests included Early English music, fell walking, wine, and travel. In his last five years he was determined to lead an active life, his last excursion being to read a lesson at a carol service in December. He leaves a wife, Pat; three children (two doctors); and three grandchildren.\n\nby Ian Stuart\n\nMichael Robert Thomas\n\nConsultant ear, nose, and throat surgeon Monklands Hospital, Airdrie, Lanarkshire, April-October 1997 (b 1955; q St Mary’s 1979; FRCSE), died of a recurrence of malignant melanoma (treated initially 12 years previously) on 10 October 1997. Brought up in Bahrain, Mike joined the Royal Air Force after house jobs, and insisted on interrupting his senior registrar training to serve in the Gulf War. A cheerful, energetic, and deeply religious man who loved teaching, Mike lived life to the full. He played rugby for St Mary’s and the RAF and represented the RAF at water polo, swimming, and squash. He was committed to laryngectomee rehabilitation, establishing swimming clubs in Glasgow and Portsmouth. He leaves a wife, Kate, with three sons, together with two daughters from his first marriage.\n\nA celebration for the life and work of Sir John Nabarro will be held in the Royal College of Physicians of London, 11 St Andrews Place, London NW1 4LE, on Monday 22 June at 4 00 pm.\n\nby H J Cox and J J Skipper"
