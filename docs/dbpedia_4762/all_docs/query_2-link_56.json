        "text": "Thank you for investing in the health of our community!\n\nIn 2021, MaineHealth Stephens Hospital underwent a rigorous facilities planning process to assess our aging infrastructure and identify building and service needs. As part of that process, the PACE ambulance station was identified as a priority, requiring significant updates and renovations. To help fund these renovations, MaineHealth Stephens Hospital launched the 2022 PACE Community Campaign to address the needs of our PACE paramedics and EMTs as they care for our community.\n\nThe renovated ambulance station will provide sufficient space and modern equipment to ensure crews deliver the best care possible. Improved storage will preserve gear and make it more accessible when seconds are a matter of life and death. In addition, updated living quarters will support our diverse crew members who spend hours living away from home as they work to keep this community safe. This renovation will also provide expanded meeting and training space – not only for our first responders but also for community education. These updates are essential and will strengthen the infrastructure of Oxford County’s only paramedic-licensed first responder service.\n\nThank you to all whose commitment and support made this achievement possible.\n\nThank you to all who believe in the mission, vision and purpose of MaineHealth Stephens Hospital and who invested in improving the health of our community. With your support, the 2022 PACE Community Campaign raised $2,220,615.29.\n\nA special thank you to the committee members who are responsible for the success of this project: Angela Bancroft, Krista Bureau, Dick Beauchesne, Kevin Carleton, Elise Christie, Celia Dieterich, Jennifer Fogg, Abbie Graiver, Robert Hand, Mari Grover, Gail McBride, Andrea Patstone with support from Dana Bullen and Darcy Lambert.\n\nVisionary Donors ($100,000 and above)\n\nAnonymous\n\nAnonymous\n\nLeadership Donors ($50,000 – $99,999)\n\nStephen and Tabitha King Foundation\n\nMr. and Mrs. James C.
