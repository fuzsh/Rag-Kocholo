        "text": "Bonnie was predeceased by her husband Ian James Fife, whom she dearly adored (2015). Bonnie and Ian met during their time teaching in Etobicoke. After the death of Ian’s wife, Kaye, they met again and began a new chapter. After marrying and taking on the role of step parent, Bonnie retired from her teaching career, but forever retained her immaculate/enviable cursive handwriting and love of colouring, which she did frequently with her grandchildren as they were growing up. Though Bonnie had many adventures in her rich lifetime, she particularly enjoyed cruising the Muskoka Lakes on the RMS Segwun with Ian.\n\nBonnie was also predeceased by her parents Gilbert and Mildred (nee Hume) Little and brother Gilbert, and is survived by her sister Joy Appleman (Robert) of Hawaii.\n\nRecently, dementia made her world smaller but her relationships with family stronger.\n\nBonnie will be fondly remembered by the children she shared with Ian – Glynnis Fleming (John), Karen Wilson (Barry), Rebecca Holvik (Adrian) and Murray Fife (Amy). Having not had children herself, Bonnie specially enjoyed her grandchildren – Ian, Matthew, Hartley, Indigo, Graham, Eric, Kevin, Erin, Scott, Andrew, Kathryn, Lindsey, Joshua, and Kaitlyn. Bonnie had unique relationships with each of them, who will hold her with love in their memories. Bonnie and Ian even got to hold some great grandchildren in their arms. Ian’s family loved and will remember Bonnie too. Bonnie will be missed by her long-time friends Pat Graham and Janet Barry and by her loving sister-in-law, Rosalind Little. Bonnie treasured the times with her fellow teacher friends and will be remembered for her fellowship in the many church groups she participated in over the years.\n\nSpecial thanks to the loving, caring team at the Meaford Long Term Care Centre for your care of Bonnie when she needed you.\n\nA graveside service will be held on Thursday October 12, 2023 at 11 o’clock in the Ayton Union Cemetery.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, it would be Bonnie’s wish to send donations to the Alzheimer Society of Grey Bruce or a charity of your choice which may be made through the Ferguson Funeral Home, 48 Boucher St. E., Meaford, ON N4L 1B9 to whom arrangements have been entrusted. www.fergusonfuneralhomes.ca"
