Obituaries can be emailed to obituaries@readingeagle.com.\n\nIn addition to the text of the obituary, any photographs that you wish to include can be attached to this email. Please put the text of the obituary in a Word document, a Google document or in the body of the email. The Reading Eagle also requires a way to verify the death, so please include either the phone number of the funeral home or cremation service that is in charge of the deceased's care or a photo of his/her death certificate. We also request that your full name, phone number and address are all included in this email.\n\nAll payments by families must be made with a credit card. We will send a proof of the completed obituary before we require payment. The obituary cannot run, however, until we receive payment in full.\n\nObituaries can be submitted for any future date, but they must be received no later than 3:00 p.m. the day prior to its running for it to be published.\n\nPlease call the obituary desk, at 610-371-5018, for information on pricing."
