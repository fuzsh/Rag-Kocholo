        "text": "Former Negativland member Ian Allen has died from complications during heart valve replacement surgery at the age of 56. Allen was a part of the outfit from 1981 for around six years, when health problems forced him to slow down activities, although he remained a close friend and collaborator of the group, helping to articulate their idea of \"culture jamming‚Äù.\n\nAllen contributed to points (1981) and A Big 10-8 Place (1983), the group's first concept LP. A full statement from the collective has been posted on Facebook."
