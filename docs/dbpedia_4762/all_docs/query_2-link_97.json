R. Ferguson, of Keppoch.\n\nYoung Ferguson and his four-year-old brother had saddled the horse and were about to round up stock on their father's property. The older boy was wearing a rubber-type rain sheet which was flapping in the strong wind. This is believed to have frightened the horse and caused him to unseat the lads, but Sandy's foot became entangled in the stirrup, and the frightened horse careered in the direction of the homestead.\n\nMr. Ferguson was in a shed at the time and heard the horse galloping towards the yard and was just in time to see his boy strike a post, and at the same time clear his foot from the stirrup.\n\nThe injured lad was rushed to the Naracoorte Hospital, and although not then unconscious, he later fell into a coma. He was suffering from a broken nose, fractured upper jaw, and a severe cut under the arm. In addition all his front teeth were knocked out.\n\nA successful operation was performed yesterday morning, and although the boy was still seriously ill, his condition was reported to be improving. This afternoon young Ferguson had shown still further improvement.\n\nThe young boy was not injured.\n\nColin married Corrine McColm FIELD, daughter of Arthur Henry FIELD and Beatrice Sarah McCOLM.\n\nGeneral Notes: Corrine's mother was evacuated to Katoomba from Sydney during the war.\n\nChildren from this union were:\n\n+ 404 i.

Malcolm John FERGUSON\n\nMalcolm married Mary Josephine (Mem) DUNSTAN.\n\nMal Ferguson an Electrical Fitter employed by Hamersley Iron at East Intercourse Island owes his eyesight to a pair of safety glasses. On December 2, Mal was engaged in replacing a module to the 415 volt M.C.C. panel in the dumper substation. A separate panel between the modules was\n\nmissing and during the replacement, Mal accidentally caused a short across three live 300 amp fuses contained in the lower module. The resultant flashover caused burns to Mal's face, arms and hands. The safety glasses worn by Mal were extensively damaged with the front lens surface actually melting. Because of his glasses no eye damage was received. Mal had, just two days previously attended a talk by Lawrie Walsh the Technical Training Manager of Protector Safety Products Pty. Ltd., (see-story this page, ,'Top Eye Protection Man Visits Dampier'), where the importance of wearing eye protection at all times was stressed. In hospital after the accident Mal could only express his gratitude that he had taken the advice given and worn his glasses even though he was working in the comparatively safe area of a substation.\n\nMal will be nominated for a Wise Owl Award.\n\nOur latest member to the 'Wise Owl' club, Mal\n\nFerguson suffered burns to the upper half of his\n\nbody in a freak electrical accident, whilst fitting\n\na module into a spare space on the 415 volt MCC\n\npanel in the dumper Sub-station at East Intercourse\n\nIsland.\n\nAfter removing the blanking plate, Mal found\n\nthat there was no separator plate between the\n\nmodule and the spare area. After obtaining a sep-\n\narator plate, Mai tried it for size and in doing so,\n\ncaused a short across three live 300 AMP fuses,\n\ncontained in the bottom module and to earth.\n\nThe resultant flash over caused burns to Mal's\n\nface, hand and arms and set fire to his synthetic\n\nshirt causing further burns to his body.\n\nHe spent a month in Royal Perth Hospital burns unit.\n\nSerious eye injury was avoided because he was\n\nwearing the correct safety glasses.\n\nChildren from this union were:\n\n+ 408 i.

You stuffed up big time, like the day Mitchell cut brionys long hair\n\nAnd most of all his positive outlook on life! Even these last few weeks he never failed to put smiles on faces with his funny 1 liners that lifted everyone's spirts\n\nI'm sure grumps would be proud of all of us and I hope we enriched his life as much as he did ours!\n\nEulogy - Kelly Ferguson: 18 Apr 2019, Barmera, S.A.\n\nIt's an honour to say a few words today ..\n\nStuart Charles Ferguson was the first son of Peter and Lorna Ferguson, born on the 18th of January 1941, in Naracoorte.\n\nApart from a short period of time spent in Renmark on Peter's return from the war, the family lived in Lucindale. Stuart's only brother, Terry, was born in 1946 and by now the family were living on a scrub property they had purchased from Lorna's family.\n\nThis was on the outskirts of Lucindale, where they cleared the land and bred cattle.\n\nStuart loved his childhood on the farm. He and Terry were close to their cousins and they made many memories together. Well known as an accomplished horseman, Stuart rode his horse to school and home each day. Family holidays were spent at Nora Creina fishing and crayfishing, sparking a long love of fishing.\n\nStuart began his first job as a Stock Agent and loved the time on the road and in the stockyards. He made many friendships throughout these years, and his love of a Southwark long neck was born.\n\nStuart played the bagpipes for the Naracoorte Pipe Band and later for the Port Pirie Pipe Band when living in Kadina. He enjoyed a scotch, straight from the bottle, while playing the pipes, insisting that the alcohol kept the bag soft.\n\nWhile working in Bordertown as a Stock Agent with Goldsbrough Mort, he met Margaret Price. By the time they became engaged Stuart had moved to Jamestown and a long distance romance continued. Margaret recalls asking him to send her a BIG letter and so he did, it was A3 size!! She then said she had meant a LONG letter. The next mail brought a letter written along the length of an adding machine roll. He always had a sense of humour.\n\nFinally, Stuart and Margaret were married on the 15th of February 1964, in the Bordertown Methodist Church\n\nThe newly-weds settled in Kadina, and within a few years Mardi was born. An opportunity arose to return to Bordertown and purchase half of Margaret's parent's property at Wirrega. They settled, and built a home on the farm with cereal crops and an intensive piggery. James, and then, David were born, and the family was complete.\n\nStuart was a wonderful, placid and loving father who rarely raised his voice and preferred to let Margaret do the chastising. Mardi, James and David have endless memories of their childhood on the farm, never far from his side. This time was spent, on the tractor, lighting fires, in the shearing shed or the piggery.\n\nSummer holidays were always spent at the shack in Kingston and Stuart loved making sure everyone had a feed of King George Whiting or Snook. He developed a love of sailing and bought himself a 24 foot yacht, then set about teaching himself to sail, winning first place in a couple of local sailing events, not that he ever was one to gloat.\n\nStuart was all about having fun, and the family enjoyed camping in the scrub just down the road at Harding's Springs or at the Grampians. Margaret recalls one particularly hairy moment, when Stuart ignored the well beaten path and dragged the kids up the sheer side of the Elephant's Hide. However, the most memorable holiday, the caravan trip to Queensland, fondly known as 'The Year of the Sandwich'.\n\nStuart loved gliding through these years and spent most weekends at the Gliding Club, either flying, ground crewman or carrying out maintenance. He was Chief Ground Engineer, for some years, and both he and Margaret loved the gliding community and competitions they travelled to.\n\nStuart and Margaret sold the farm in 1984, at which time they moved into Bordertown and began their Deli adventure. They bought and worked Ferg's Deli for 10 years, which was as 7 day a week, 12 hour a day business. Although the deli had its drawbacks, this time saw them make some of their dearest friends and memories.\n\nAfter 10 long years, it was time for a change, and they sold the Deli and Stuart began a job with SACBH. First he held a position as a Site Manager at Wirrega and Cannawigra silos and then carrying out Area Site Maintenance for the region. Stuart retired at the age of 65 and their caravanning adventures began.\n\nStuart and Margaret lapped the country more than once, setting off on an adventure for many months each year. They made friends all over Australia and still stay in touch to this day.\n\nIn 2018, Stuart and Margaret sold up their Bordertown home and moved to their little unit in Berri. Stuart never stopped his love of learning, hardly a gadget he didn't own. His inquisitive mind, interested in all subjects, meant he was well read and knowledgeable on a huge range of topics.\n\nMargaret, a beautiful cook, would always have Stuart looking over her shoulder, stirring the pot and offering advice. He loved to cook and after retirement, loved nothing better than testing a new recipe or cooking apparatus. He could make the best pancakes or homemade crumpets, cooking with dough his specialty. The kids still remember his Kitchener buns from their childhood.\n\nStuart was much loved by his wife, Margaret, 3 children and their partners, 10 grandchildren and 3 great grandchildren, very fondly known as Grumps.\n\nHe always put others first and even in his final days, kept us amused with his witty one liners, his sneaky little smiles and subjected us to hours on end of SBS food channel.\n\nWe will all miss him enormously.\n\nStuart married Margaret (Peg) Grace PRICE, daughter of Vincent Dudley PRICE and Grace Isabel WILSON.\n\nGeneral Notes: Margaret Grace Price was born on the 10th of July 1943 at Hamley Bridge in South Australia and lived on her parents farm at Lowan Vale near Bordertown.\n\nWent to School at Bordertown to Yr 7, 1949 - 1955.
