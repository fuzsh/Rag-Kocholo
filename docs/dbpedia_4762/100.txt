Oct 29, 1937 - Jun 3, 2018

You may remember her from the Government Office, the Cranbrook Court House, or the BC Access Center, where she joyfully, diligently and capably gave her service, or maybe as a dedicated member of the Catholic Church, the CWL, or the Historical Society. Perhaps you knew her as an avid gardener, or a generous friend.

Marilynne Anne Ferguson died with laughter, many visitors, a struggle and then peace, on Sunday, June 3rd, 2018, in the town where she was born. She was predeceased by her mother Mary Pascuzzo, her father Sandy Pascuzzo, her husband of 13 years George Ferguson, and her aunt and dear friend Dot Haley.
