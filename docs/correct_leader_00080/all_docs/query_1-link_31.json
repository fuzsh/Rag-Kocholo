        "text": "Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg (Finland Swedish: [ˈstoːlbærj], Finnish: [ˈstoːlbæri]; 28 January 1865 – 22 September 1952) was a Finnish jurist and academic who was one of the most important pioneers of republicanism in the country. He was the first president of Finland (1919–1925) and a liberal nationalist.[1]\n\nQuick Facts 1st President of Finland, Prime Minister ...\n\nClose\n\nStåhlberg was an important figure in the drafting of Finland's republican constitution. As a jurist, he anchored the state in liberal democracy, guarded the fragile germ of the rule of law, and embarked on internal reforms. In implementing the form of government of 1919, Ståhlberg piloted an independent Finland towards acting in world politics; in presidential-led foreign and security policy, he relied on international law and diplomacy.[2]"
