        "text": "Stalin respected Hitler as a vulnerable swimmer respects a shark. Constantly monitoring Hitler’s every move, Stalin made sure to keep his distance, lest he should be swallowed up by the ferocious jaws of the Reich. Though they possessed certain similarities, such as their manipulation and hunger for territory, both men were ideological opposites. Stalin passionately condemned fascism. Hitler came to power after persecuting and opposing German communists. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39, the Nazis supported Fascist dictator Francisco Franco, whereas the Soviet Union sent aid to Franco’s enemies. Given their ideological opposition, Stalin knew that a conflict between the Soviet Union and the Nazis was unavoidable. Cognizant of Hitler’s power, Stalin chose to anticipate and react to Hitler’s moves, instead of trying to act out against him. Stalin wanted to give himself time to prepare his army and erect the necessary defenses, man-made and natural.\n\nStalin believed that if the Nazis were to invade the Soviet Union, they would likely attack Leningrad, a key economic and political center. A Petrine creation and Russia’s “window to the West,” Leningrad was a symbolic capital of communism, housing the Soviet Baltic Fleet and numerous arms factories. Unlike Moscow, Leningrad was a western city, only hundreds of miles from the Nazis. Seeking a buffer zone between Leningrad and the Nazis, Stalin looked to Finland.\n\nAlthough Finland and the Soviet Union shared an 800 mile-long border, each nation could not have been any more unlike the other. Finland was a relatively peaceful, neutral nation, whereas the Soviet Union endured disastrous experiences in the First World War and 1917 revolution. The Soviet Union’s 170.6 million citizens dwarfed Finland’s 3.7 million. Unable to rival the Soviet Union’s military might, Stalin was convinced that Finland would easily capitulate to a Soviet invasion. Because of Hitler’s demonstrated militarism and ideological differences, Stalin turned to Finland, a weak and poorly-defended country, to annex a buffer zone between Leningrad and the Nazis.\n\nReacting to the Nazi annexation of Austria in March of 1938, Stalin sent Boris Yartsev, the Second Secretary of the Soviet legation in Finland, to negotiate with the Finns about a defensive alliance. As historian Albin T. Anderson writes, Yartsev’s rationale was simple: “It was assumed that Hitler had in mind an eventual multi-pronged attack upon the Soviet Union. One of these attacking wings would undoubtedly seek to pass through Finland. Such an eventuality would force the USSR to anticipate the Germans in Finland and that country would then become an area of hostility. Yartsev's government felt it prudent, therefore, that the two countries begin discussions relating to mutual defense.” Yartsev offered the Finns military aid and guaranteed the integrity of Finnish borders. In return, he asked that the Soviets militarize the key Finnish island of Suursari, which would help protect Leningrad from Nazi naval invasion. Finland, though, did not blindly agree to Soviet demands: they feared that a militarized Suursari could serve as a pretext for a Soviet land invasion, a violation of their neutrality and sovereignty. Cornered between ceding valuable land to Stalin or risking a bloody, drawn-out conflict with the Soviet Union, the Finns prevaricated, as Anderson notes: “The only concession which the Finns would grant at this time was to promise that conversations would be resumed in Moscow on the occasion of the dedication of the new Finnish legation early in December.”\n\nBy the fall of 1938, as the Soviet Union eagerly eyed Finland and the Baltic States, Helsinki kept its cards close to its vest. Instead of trying to reason with the Soviets, the Finns stalled for as long as possible. Stalin, meanwhile, knew that the window to prepare his nation for a Nazi invasion was quickly diminishing. Seeing through the Finnish delay, Stalin ordered Boris Stein, a top Soviet diplomat stationed in Rome, to expedite negotiations in Helsinki. By mid-march of 1939, the two nations reached an impasse: the Finnish delegation, led by Prime Minister Aimo Cajander, averred that such “an exchange of the proposed territory would be politically hazardous and impossible to justify to the Finnish people.”\n\nAs Soviet diplomats waged mental war with the Finns, Stalin sent his best statesman, Vyacheslav Molotov, to negotiate with the Nazis by April of 1939. After months of diplomatic speculation and negotiations, two burgeoning powers came to an unlikely agreement.\n\nAugust 23, 1939, sealed the fate of Europe. In a state meeting room in Moscow, Nazi Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and Soviet diplomat Vyacheslav Molotov put pen to paper, ensuring the creation of a Nazi-Soviet nonaggression pact. The treaty stunned the world, but it especially came as a shock to the Finns, who “discovered how difficult it was for a small power to retain freedom of action in the face of big-power maneuvering.” In October, Stalin, aware that the Finnish position was weakened, sent more diplomats to Helsinki. On October 12, the Soviets lay all their cards on the table, proposing “that Finland relinquish a group of major islands in the Gulf, including Suursaari and Koivisto; that the USSR be leased a naval and airbase on the Finnish coast, preferably Hanko; that the Karelian border be moved west…, that the Russians be granted a bit of territory on Petsamo in the far north; and, finally, that the Finns agree to a limited pact of mutual assistance designed to guarantee the security of the Finnish Gulf.” Although the Finns had their backs to the wall, they did not budge. By the fall of 1939, the nations became locked in diplomatic stalemate. Conflict, it seemed, was imminent.\n\nIn Mainila, Soviet Union, a small border town, the peace and quiet of the dew-kissed morning of November 26th did not last for long. Tired of unproductive negotiation and impatient to seize borderlands, Stalin had his men shell the village and blame it on the Finns. Although the Soviets insisted that the Finns were responsible for the carnage, Helsinki denied all responsibility, declaring war four days later. Thus, the stage was set: one of history’s largest powers would invade a young, largely neutral nation, lake-laden and wintry, protected by a small army and bands of ex-hunters. The Soviet tanks lumbered across the Finnish border on the night of November 30, 1939.\n\nGiven the Soviet Union’s military might, it was expected that victory would come quickly. This, however, was not the case: the first few weeks of the conflict were disastrous for the Soviet infantry. Much like the elusive Viet Cong of the 1960s and 70s, the Finns masterfully waged guerilla warfare against a much larger, mechanized army. Taking advantage of their speed and tactics, the Finns drew Soviet forces away from bases of operation, encircling them and attacking from all sides. Unlike the Soviets, the Finns knew the snowy terrain inside and out. Lurking in the trees and hiding in plain sight, the Finns inflicted heavy casualties during the beginning weeks of the war.\n\nTo exemplify the dogged determination and brilliant strategy with which the Finns fought, it is necessary to look to Simo Hayha. A gifted sniper, Hayha was a master of disguise and braved the elements to fight for his country. Hayha knew the snow-covered Finnish countryside like the back of his hand, always using his knowledge to gain an advantage. Aware of Finland’s icy temperatures, Hayha preferred an iron sight on his rifle over a scope, since a scope would give off a distinctive glint in the sun and fog up in the cold. Dressed entirely in layers of white, Hayha blended into the snow and was conscientious of every detail: he put snow in his mouth while aiming so that when he exhaled he would not give off steam and reveal his location. Despite the conditions and iron sight, Hayha’s exploits made him the world’s most successful sniper: he earned over 500 kills during the 100-day Winter War, averaging at least five confirmed kills a day. Whereas Hayha and the Finns blended into their wintry surroundings, the Soviet infantry stood out against their Baltic backdrop, making them easy targets. In a classic backfire of totalitarianism, Stalin had purged all of his leading military strategists the decade prior, leaving the Soviet army highly disorganized and unprepared for their new environment. After his service, Hayha became a national hero, hailed as “the White Death.”"
