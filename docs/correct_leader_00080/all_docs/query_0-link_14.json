        "text": "Aimo Kaarlo Cajander\n\nThe organization of forest administration in Suomi\n\nCajander A. K. (1927). The organization of forest administration in Suomi. Silva Fennica no. 4 article id 4437. https://doi.org/10.14214/sf.a8385\n\nAbstract\n\nA temporary organization for forest service was established in 1851 for the State forests of Finland. It was made permanent in 1859, and a central board, chief forest supervisors, forest supervisors and forest guards were appointed for the state forests. The Forest Research Institute, established in 1917, was subordinated to the Board of Forestry. In addition, the higher forest education was subordinated to Board of Forestry until it was moved to the University of Helsinki in 1908.\n\nIn 1921 the administration was reorganized to meet the requirements of developing forestry in the state forests. The Forest Service was divided into two sections: The State Forest Section and the Private Forest Section. The first consists of four divisions and the latter two. The forests under the supervision of the State Forest Section are divided into four districts, and each of these into two or three inspection territories. Under the supervision of the Private Forest Section are the forest schools, the Forest Research Institute, and the forest officials working for the ecclesiastical forests and Provincial Forest Committees. The Forest Research Institute is only nominally subordinated to the Private Forest Section of the Board of Forestry. It has 17 experimental areas in various parts of the country. These areas have been separated from the supervisor-areas of the state forests.\n\nThe PDF includes a summary in Finnish.\n\nKeywords\n\nForest Service; forest administration; forest research; forest education; state forests; Mets√§hallitus; private forests\n\nPublished in 1927\n\nViews 1765"
