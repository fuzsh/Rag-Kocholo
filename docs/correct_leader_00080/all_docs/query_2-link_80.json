President Roosevelt told Congress: \"We stand on our historic offer to take counsel with all other nations of the world to the end that aggression among them be terminated, that the race of armaments cease and that commerce be renewed. But the world has grown so small and weapons of attack so swift that no nation can be safe in its will to peace so long as any other single powerful nation refuses to settle its grievances at the council table.\" The President added: \"At the very least, we can and should avoid any action, or any lack of action, which will encourage, assist, or build up an aggressor. We have learned that when we deliberately try to legislate neutrality, our neu­trality laws may operate unevenly and unfairlymay actually give aid to an aggressor and deny it to the victim. The instinct of self‑preservation should warn us that we ought not to let that happen any more.\" Congressional Record [Bound], Vol. 84, pt. 1, Jan. 4, 1939, p. 75.)\n\nJanuary 6. Baron Kiichiro Hiranuma became Premier of Japan. (Prince Konoye resigned Jan. 4. Simonds, Emeny, p. 687.)\n\nChancellor Hitler told Foreign Minister Joseph Beck of Poland Danzig should return to Germany politically but remain with Poland economically (\". . . economically Danzig could not exist without a hinterland: . . . Danzig was German, would always remain German and sooner or later would return to Germany;\" the Corridor presented a grave psychological problem for Germany \". . . the connection with the sea was for Poland.\" Ger­many would give Poland a definite guarantee of her frontiers on a treaty basis, \"if means, could be found to bring about a final settlement of all separate questions on such a common sense footing, . . .\" German, No. 200, p. 206.)\n\nJanuary 6. Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop again proposed reunion of Danzig, guarantee of Polish economic interests, extra­territorial connections with East Prussia, and guarantee of all Poland's present possessions. (\"As the Führer had already said Germany's prime and unqualified desire was for a final, compre­hensive, and generous consolidation of our mutual relations.\" Ibid., No. 201, p. 208. Cf. offer of Oct. 24, 1938, supra.)\n\nJanuary 14. Prime Minister Chamberlain emphasized to France that Premier Mussolini had promised to withdraw his forces from Spanish territory after a final Franco victory.

(Appeasement. Ibid., p. 366.)\n\nJanuary 23. Prime Minister Chamberlain explained British scheme of voluntary national service. (\"It is a scheme to make us ready for war . . . we might be forced to take part in a war begun by others, or we might be attacked ourselves if the government of some other country were to think we could not defend our­selves effectively . . . if we wish to protect our civilian popu­lation in time of war, we must prepare necessary organization in time of peace.\" London Times, Jan. 24, 1939, p. 12.)\n\nJanuary 26. Foreign Minister Bonnet announced France would con­tinue her policy of nonintervention in Spain. Cf. Jan. 15, supra. Lee, p. 367.)\n\nForeign Minister von Ribbentrop again told Foreign Minister Beck of German desires for \"the reunion of Danzig with the Reich in return for a guarantee of Poland's economic interests there, and the building of an extra‑territorial motor‑road and railway connection between Germany and her province of East Prussia, for which Germany would make compensation by guaran­teeing the German‑Polish frontier.\" (\". . . the allocation of exceedingly valuable sections of severed German territory to Poland, in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles, is regarded by every German, as a great injustice, which only Germany's extreme importance made possible at the time.\" German, No. 202, p. 209. Cf. Jan. 5, supra.)\n\nJanuary 27. President Roosevelt approved the sale of military plane to France. (Simonds, Emeny, p. 687. Cf.

Prime Minister Chamberlain explained pursuit of re­armament. (\"We cannot forget that though it takes at least two to make a peace, one can make a war. And until we have come to clear understandings in which all political tension is swept away we must put ourselves in a position to defend ourselves against attack, whether upon our land, our people, or the prin­ciples of freedom with which our existence as a democracy is bound up and which to us seems to enshrine the highest attributes of human life and spirit.\" London Times, Jan. 30, 1939, p. 8. Cf. Lee, p. 369. Cf. Jan. 23, supra.)\n\nJanuary 30.

(In answer to Chancellor Hitler's speech. Commons, Vol. 343, col. 81.)\n\nFebruary 3. President Roosevelt said American foreign policy was:\n\n\"1: We are against any entangling alliances, obviously.\n\n\"2. We are in favor of the maintenance of world trade for everybodyall nationsincluding ourselves.\n\n\"3. We are in complete sympathy with any and every effort made to reduce or limit armaments.\n\n\"4. As a nationas American peoplewe are sympathetic with the peaceful maintenance of political, economic, and social inde­pendence of all nations in the world.\" (\"The [foreign] policy has not changed and it is not going to change.\" State Release 1939, No. 489, p. 99.)\n\nFebruary 4. Dragisha Cvetkovich became Premier of Yugoslavia re­placing Milan Stoyadinovich.

Prime Minister‑Chamberlain stated: \". . . the solidarity of interest by which France and this country are, united is such that, any threat to the vital interests of France . . . must evoke the immediate cooperation of this country,\" (Confirming French statement of Jan. 26 that all forces of Britain would be at disposal of France. Commons, Vol. 343, col. 623. German, No. 267, p. 291.)\n\nFebruary 7. Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop said German foreign policy was to fight bolshevism through the anti‑Comintern Pact and to regain their colonies. (\". . . the struggle we have started is merciless. Towards the Soviets, we will remain adamant. We never will come to an understanding with Bolshevist Russia . . . we cannot admit that the riches of the world should be divided between great powers, and even small ones like Belgium or Holland, and that Germany should be completely deprived of them.\" French, No. 46, p. 55.)\n\nFebruary 10. Poland absolutely refused \"to accept the establishment of `a corridor through the Corridor'; neither will she hear of the construction of a railway line which would be the property of Germany or of a motor road with extra‑territorial rights.\" (\"Measures are being planned, which, according to the words of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, are meant to ease and simplify German transit through Pomerania.\" Ibid., No. 43, p. 52. Cf. Jan. 5, 26, supra.)\n\nFebruary 16. Britain and France qualified renewed adherence to the General Act of Geneva, requiring, obligation to arbitrate disputes, to except those \"relating to incidents which may occur in the course of a war in which they are involved.\" (\". . . both Governments desire to ensure themselves a completely free hand in dealing with neutral countries in the event of war, and refuse\n\n178 EVENTS LEADING UP TO WORLD WAR II\n\nto submit to arbitrating any dispute's arising out of the interpre­tation of the neutrality laws in general, and out of the regulations governing the conduct of maritime warfare in particular. This attitude of the British and French governments can also be interpreted as a measure directed against the withdrawal of neutral states from the policy of sanctions, and in any case will seriously weaken the position of the neutral states in the event of war.\" German, No. 244, p. 260.)\n\nFebruary 18. M. V. de Lacroix, French Minister in Prague, wrote to the French Minister for Foreign Affairs that the conditions Germany required to precede their effective guarantee of Czecho­slovak frontiers were:\n\n\" (1) Complete neutrality of Czechoslovakia.\n\n\"(2) The foreign policy of Czechoslovakia must be brought into line with that of the Reich; adhesion to the Anti‑Comintern Pact is deemed advisable.\n\n\"(3) Czechoslovakia must immediately leave the League of Nations.\n\n\"(4) Drastic reduction of military effectives.\n\n\"(5) A part of the gold reserve of Czechoslovakia must be ceded to Germany. A part of the Czechoslovak industries having been ceded, a part of the gold‑reserve must accordingly pass into the hands of Germany.\n\n\"(6) The Czechoslovak currency from the Sudeten countries must be exchanged for Czechoslovak raw materials.\n\n\"(7) The Czechoslovak markets must be open to the German industries of the Sudeten countries. No new industry may be created in Czechoslovakia if it competes with an industry already existing in Sudetenland.\n\n\"(8) Promulgation of anti‑Semitic laws analogous to those of Nuremberg.\n\n\"(9) Dismissal of all Czechoslovak Government employees who may have given Germany any ground for complaint.\n\n\"(10) The German population of Czechoslovakia must have the right to carry Nazi badges and to fly the National‑Socialist flag.\" French, No. 48, p. 57. Hitler was planning to take over Bohemia and Moravia. Lee, p. 371.)\n\nFrance reoccupied territory in East Africa ceded to Italy in 1935.

Ibid., p. 359.)\n\nFebruary 22. Prime Minister Chamberlain said British policy was \"a policy of peace through strength, which will neglect no oppor­tunity of breaking down suspicions and antagonisms and at the same time will build up steadily and resolutely, with the help of our friends within and without the Empire, a strength so for­midable as to maintain our rights and liberties against any who might be rash enough to attack them.\" (In justifying huge rearmament program.

Polish‑Rumanian defensive alliance renewed. (Against Russia. Ibid., p. 384.)\n\nGerman Minister to Iran, Smend, reported growing anti­-German sentiment in British circles and anti‑German activity: espionage and sabotage.

If we are involved in war, our contribution and the ways in which we can best make it will not be half‑hearted, nor upon any theory of limited liability.\" Commons, Vol. 344, cols. 2171, 2181‑2182.)\n\nMarch 10.

The President of the Czechoslovak State has declared that to serve this purpose, and with the object of securing a final appeasement, . . . whoever tried to resist would be `trodden underfoot.' \" Ibid., No. 77, p. 88.)\n\nMarch 15. Prime Minister Chamberlain said the Slovak declaration of independence absolved Britain from obligation to guarantee Czech frontiers.

(Rejected all British proposals. Ibid., p. 380.)\n\nPrime Minister Chamberlain ended appeasement by denounc­ing Chancellor Hitler's broken fledges and warned against pos­sible domination of the world by force. (\". . . there is hardly anything I would not sacrifice for peace. But there, is one thing that I must except, and that is the liberty that we have enjoyed for hundreds of years, and which we will never surrender . . . no greater mistake could be made than to suppose that, because it believes war to be a senseless and cruel thug, this nation has so lost its fibre that it will not take part to the utmost of its power in resisting such a challenge if it ever were made.\" British,. No. 9, pp. 12 f. Cf. Mar. 14, 15, 16, supra.)\n\nMarch 18. France and Britain and Russia protested illegality of German annexation of Bohemia and Moravia.

Sept, 29, 30, 1938, supra.)\n\nRussia protested German annexation of Czechia and modi­fication of statute of Slovakia. (\"The Government of the U. S. S. R. cannot recognize the incorporation of Czechia in the Reich, nor that of Slovakia in one form or another, as legal or as in conformity with the generally accepted rules of international law, or with justice, or with the principle of self-determination. Not only does the German Government's action not avert any of the dangers threatening world peace taut it actually tends to multiply them, to disturb the political stability of Central Europe, to increase the causes of anxiety already existing in Europe, and, finally, to deal a new blow to the feeling of security of nations.' \" French, No. 82, p. 97.)\n\nMarch 19. French Senate adopted special powers bill authorizing the Cabinet to rule by decree until Nov. 30. (Because of general. state of uneasiness. Lee, p. 379.)\n\nMarch 20. Lord Halifax confirmed change in. British policy. (\"But if and when it becomes plain to States that there is no apparent guarantee against successive attacks directed in turn on all who might seem to stand in the way of ambitious schemes of domina­tion, then at once the scale tips the other way; and in all quarters there is likely immediately to be found a very much greater readiness to consider whether the acceptance of wider mutual obligations, in the cause of mutual support, is not dictated, if for no other reason than by the necessity of self‑defense. His Majesty's Government have not failed to draw the moral from these events, and have lost no time in placing themselves in close and practical consultation, not only with the Dominions, but with other Governments concerned, upon the issues that have\n\n182 EVENTS LEADING UP TO WORLD WAR II\n\nsuddenly been made so plain.\" British, No. 10, p. 22; German, No. 271, pp. 293 f.

Germany notified Poland German renunciation of the Corridor depended on the return of Danzig and the extra­territorial connections with East Prussia. (\"Poland owed her present territorial expanse to Germany's greatest misfortune: namely, the fact that Germany had lost the World War. The decision regarding the Corridor, I [von Ribbentrop] said, was generally accepted as being the heaviest burden placed on Ger­many by the Peace Treaty of Versailles. . . . The existence of the Corridor was a thorn in the flesh of the German people, of which the sting could only be removed in this way.\" German, No. 203, pp. 211 f. Cf. Jan. 5, 26, Feb. 10, supra.)\n\nMarch 22. Germany and Lithuania signed treaty providing for the cession of Memel to the former and including a nonaggression clause.

(\"Whereas the occupation of the Czechoslovak Provinces of Bohemia, Moravia, and Slovakia by armed forces of Germany, and of the Province of Ruthenia by armed forces of Hungary and the assumption of de facto administrative control over these Provinces by Germany and Hungary renders impossible the present fulfillment by the Czechoslovak Republic of its obligations under the said Agreement;\n\n\"Whereas this condition will obtain so long as such occupation and administration continue; . . .\" State Release 1939, No. 495; p. 242. Cf. Mar. 20, supra.)\n\nGermany signed treaty guaranteeing the political independence and territorial integrity of Slovakia for 25 years.

British, No. 11, pp. 23 f.)\n\nMarch 26. Italy demanded Djibouti, the Suez Canal, and Tunisia. (Lee, p. 375. Cf. Mar. 16, supra.)\n\nPoland rejected demands on her sovereignty: i.e., extra terri­toriality proposal; presented counter technical suggestions; said \"any further pursuance of these German plans, especially where the return of Danzig to the Reich was concerned, meant war with Poland.\" (\"Today, as always, the Polish Government attach the greatest importance to the maintenance of neighborly rela­tions with the (German Reich for the longest possible period of time. . . .

Germany asked Poland to recon­sider and repeated demands of unconditional return of Danzig, extraterritorial connection with East Prussia, 25‑year nonaggression pact with frontier guarantees, joint protection of Slovakia; said Polish troop violation of Danzig would be the same as that of the Reich frontiers.

Prime Minister Chamberlain announced the Territorial Army would be placed on war footing and doubled. (\"His Majesty's Government have been impressed with the need for availing themselves still further of the spirit of voluntary service which is manifest throughout the country.

(Cf. \"New order\" policy, Nov. 3 and 30, 1938. \"The Sinnan Islands were no State's until June, 1921, when the Rasa Phosphate Co., a Japanese concern,\n\n184 EVENTS LEADING UP TO WORLD WAR II\n\nhaving made extensive investigation of the Islands since 1917, invested a considerable amount of money in the building of per­manent establishments for the development of the Islands. Their enterprise received the full authorization and support of the Japanese Government, which dispatched. a naval surveying ship, Koshu, in 1929. In April of the same year a stone monu­ment was built signifying the Japanese occupation, replacing a wooden marker built in 1919.

Prime Minister Chamberlain repeated guarantee to Poland of March 31, emphasizing its departure from traditional British ideas of policy, and mentioned the possible necessity of extending it to other countries.

Bearing this object in mind we cannot but be impressed with the view, shared by other demo­cratic countries and especially by our friends in Europe, that despite the immense efforts this country has already made by way of rearmament, nothing would so impress the world with the determination of this country to offer firm resistance to any attempt at general domination as its acceptance of the principle of compulsory military service, which is the universal rule on the Continent.\" Commons, Vol. 346, col. 1151.

The British Government thus regards war by England against Germany no longer as an impossibility, but on the contrary as a capital problem of English foreign policy. By means of this encirclement policy the British Government has unilaterally deprived the Naval Agreement of the 18th June 1935, of its basis, and has thus put out of force this agreement as well as the complementary declaration of the 17th July 1937.\" British, No. 22, p. 69; German, No. 294, pp. 313 f.)\n\nApril 28.

The reply was in all cases negative, in some instances strongly so. . . . Apart from this fact, all States bordering on Germany have received assurances and above all much more definite proposals than Mr. Roosevelt asked of me in his curious telegram. . . .

Vyacheslav Molotov replaced Maxim Litvinov as Foreign Commissar in Russia. (Indicated a trend in policy away from collective security and cooperation with the League of Nations toward a compromise with the Axis. Lee, p. 396.)\n\nMay 5. Poland rejected Germany's request for the return of Danzig and for a road through the Corridor: (\"It is clear that negotia­tions in which one State formulates demands and the other is to be obliged to accept those demands unaltered are not negotia­tions in the spirit of the declaration of 1934 and are incompatible with the vital interests and dignity of Poland. . . . The Polish Government cannot accept such an interpretation of the decla­ration of 1934 as would be equivalent to a renunciation of the right to conclude political agreements with third States and, consequently almost a renunciation of independence in foreign policy. . . . The Polish Government reject as completely without foundation all accusations regarding the alleged incompatibility of the Anglo‑Polish Mutual Guarantee of April 1939, with the Polish‑German Declaration of 1934.

We have suggested the extension of similar facilities to road traffic. . . . On the first and second points, i.e., the question of the future of Danzig and of communication across Pomorze, it is still a matter of unilateral concessions which the Government of the Reich appear to be demanding from us. A self‑respecting nation does not make unilateral concessions. In his speech the Chancellor of the Reich proposes, as a concession on his part, the recognition and definite acceptance of the present frontier between Poland and Germany. I must point out that this would have been a question of recognizing what is de jure and de facto our indisputable property. . . .

Simonds, Emeny, p. 689.)\n\nMay 19. Prime Minister Chamberlain said Britain sought support of other countries interested in peace, yet nearer to the possible seat of trouble: i.e., Turkey and Russia, in supplying new stabilizing factor for Europe. (\". . . unless some new stabilizing factor could be introduced into Europe, the dissolution of a large part of Europe might be imminent. . . .

Cf. May, 12, supra.)\n\nFinland, Norway, and Sweden declined offer of German non­aggression treaty. (\"The Swedish and Norwegian Governments have again declared to the German Government that their respective countries do not feel menaced by Germany, and that, while maintaining the principle of neutrality, integrity, and independence, they have no intention of entering into non­aggression pacts with any country.

(\"If we go in for embargoes on exports, for the purpose of keeping ourselves out of war, the logical thing to do would be to make our embargo all‑inclusive. Modern warfare is no longer warfare between armed forces only: it is warfare between nations in every phase of their national life. Lists of contraband are no longer limited to arms and ammunition and closely related commodities. They include not only those items which contribute toward making warfare possible, but almost every item useful in the life of the enemy nation. A nation at war is no less anxious to keep cotton or petroleum or, indeed, any useful product, from reaching an enemy nation than it is to keep guns and airplanes from reaching the enemy's armed forces. I doubt whether we can help ourselves to keep out of war by an attempt on our part to distinguish between categories of exports. Yet a complete embargo upon all exports would obviously be ruinous to our economic life. It therefore seems clear that we should have no general and automatic embargo inflexibly and rigidly imposed on any class or group of exports.\" State Release 1939, No. 505, p. 476. Cf.

If you deliberately isolate yourself from others by your own actions, you can blame nobody but yourself; and so long as this isolation continues, the inevitable consequences of it, are bound to become stronger and more marked. The last thing we desire is to see the individual German man, or woman, or child suffering privations; but if they do so, the fault does not lie with us; and it depends on Germany and Germany alone whether this process of isolation continues or not, for any day it can be ended by a policy of co‑operation.

Ambassador Leon Noel warned the French Foreign Office that Germany wanted the Corridor and other territories that were detached from the Reich. (\"The language used by those Germans who live in Poland, or who come here on a visit and even that which one may hear from the lips of certain close friends of Herr von Moltke, clearly confirm it; and while, of course, my German colleague personally shows himself much more prudent, nobody has ever heard him, say that the annexation of Danzig was the last of the Nazi claims.\" French, No. 159, p. 182.

In such circumstances any action taken by Poland to restore the situation would, it is suggested, be represented as an act of aggression on her part; and if her action were supported by other Powers, they would be accused of aiding and abetting her in the use of force.\n\n\"If the sequence of events should, in fact, be such as is contemplated on this hypothesis, hon. Members will realise, from what I have said earlier, that the issue could not be considered as a purely local matter involving the rights and liberties of the Danzigers, which incidentally are in no way threatened, but would at once raise graver issues affecting Polish national existence and independence.

If France intended to attack Germany for refusing to tolerate violence to its interests by Polish armed opposition to any change from the status quo in Danzig, Germany would accept war.

The proponents, including the Executive branch of the Govern­ment, at the time when the arms embargo was originally adopted called attention to the fact that its enactment constituted a hazardous departure from the principle of international law which recognizes the right of neutrals to trade with belligerents and of belligerents to trade with neutrals. They believe that neutrality means impartiality, and in their view an arms embargo is directly opposed to the idea of neutrality. It is not humanly possible, by enacting an arms embargo, or by refraining from such enactment, to hold the scales exactly even between two belligerents. In either case and due to shifting circumstances one belligerent may find itself in a position of relative advantage or disadvantage. The important difference between the two\n\n198 EVENTS LEADING UP TO WORLD WAR II\n\ncases is that when such a condition arises in the absence of an arms embargo on our part, no responsibility attaches to this country, whereas in the presence of an embargo, the responsibility of this country for the creation of the condition is inevitably direct and clear.\" Bulletin, Vol. I, No. 3, pp. 43 f.

(\". . . it would give Polish Gov­ernment some definite and new point on which to open up negotiation.\" British, No. 71, p. 160.)\n\nPremier Daladier begged Chancellor Hitler to make a final attempt at a peaceful settlement with Poland. (\"Your desire for peace could exercise its influence with full determination towards this end without detracting anything from Germany's honor.\" German, No. 460, pp. 473 f.; French, No. 253, pp. 274 f.)\n\nFrance urged direct negotiations between Germany and Poland.

It is not impossible that moderates in the National-Socialist party may find in the Russian pact fresh arguments to\n\n206 EVENTS LEADING UP TO WORLD WAR II\n\ndissuade the Fuehrer from going to war, by calling his attention to the unlimited economic possibilities of the Reich's collabora­tion with the Soviet. Time presses, . . .\" French, No. 246, p. 271.)\n\nPoland promised to consult Britain and France before making any important decision, to answer attacks on economic rights with suitable nonmilitary retaliation, to act immediately without previous consultation where delay would be dangerous following unpredictable situation.

Times, Aug. 27, 1939, p. 31.)\n\nAmbassador Horinouchi told Secretary of State Hull Japan had decided to \"abandon any further negotiations with Germany and Italy relative to closer relations under the anti‑Comintern Pact to which they have been parties for some time.\" (\". . . the change in affairs in Europe made this course manifest, and, fur­thermore, it was plain that his Government would find it impor­tant to adopt new foreign policy in more or less respects.\" Peace, p. 481. Cf. Aug. 23, supra.)\n\nYugoslav Government announced Serb‑Croat accord. (Ac­cepted by Prince Paul as basis for new National Union Cabinet. Times, Aug. 27, 1939, p. 1.)\n\nAugust 27. Chancellor Hitler wrote Premier Daladier war seemed in­evitable. (\". . . no nation with a sense of honor can ever give up almost two million people and see them maltreated on its own frontiers. I therefore formulated a clear demand: Danzig and the Corridor must return to Germany. The Macedonian condi­tions prevailing along our eastern frontier must cease. I see no possibility of persuading Poland, who deems herself safe from attack by virtue of guarantees given to her, to agree to a peaceful solution. . . . I see no possibility open to us of influencing Poland to take a saner attitude and thus to remedy a situation which is unbearable for both the German people and the German Reich.\" German, No. 461, pp. 476 f.; French, No. 267, pp. 285 f.); that objectionable as his methods were in revising the dictate of Versailles, he found solutions without bloodshed acceptable to others. (\"By the manner in which these solutions were accom­plished, statesmen of other nations were relieved of their obliga­tion, which they often found impossible to fulfill, of having to accept responsibility for this revision before their own people.\" Ibid., p. 284; German, No. 461, p. 475.)\n\nBritish Ambassador reported German allegations of ill treat­ment of German minority gross exaggeration. (\"In any case it is purely and simply deliberate German provocation in accordance with fixed policy that has since March exacerbated feeling between the two nationalities. I suppose this has been done with object of (a) creating war spirit in Germany, (b) impressing public opinion abroad, (c) provoking either defeatism or apparent aggression in Poland. . . . In face of these facts, it can hardly be doubted that, if Herr Hitler decides on war, it is for the sole purpose of destroying Polish independence.\" British, No. 55, pp. 124 f.)\n\nEVENTS LEADING UP TO WORLD WAR II 207\n\nBritain suggested Poland get the Pope to act as intermediary. (To approach Germany with suggestions of neutral observers and exchange of populations. Ibid., No. 72, p. 616.)\n\nFrance notified Belgium that she would respect the letter's neutrality as long as another Power would. (\"The Government of the Republic have neglected nothing that might contribute to the maintenance of peace. If their efforts should fail, the French Government know that the Belgian Government would act in exact conformity with their international obligations.\" French, No. 270, p. 287.); also Luxemburg. (Ibid., No 279, p. 292.) Britain sent identic notification. (Belgium, p. 70.)\n\nAugust 28. Britain told Germany they would welcome a mutual dis­cussion and agreement after a peaceful settlement of German­-Polish differences by negotiation which would safeguard the essential interests of Poland and secure international guarantee of the settlement. (\"A just settlement of these questions between Germany and Poland may open the way to world peace. Failure to reach it would ruin the hopes of better understanding between Germany and Great Britain, would bring the two countries into conflict, and might well plunge the whole world into war. Such an outcome would be a calamity without parallel in history.\" British, No. 73, 74, pp. 161‑165; German, No. 463, p. 479; French, No. 277, pp. 290 ff )\n\nAmbassador Henderson told Chancellor Hitler he must choose between England and Poland. (\"If he put forward immoderate demands there was no hope of a peaceful solution.\" British, No. 75; p. 167.) Chancellor Hitler wanted return of Danzig and the whole Corridor and a rectification in Silesia (because of post­war plebiscite. Ibid., p. 167); indicated willingness to negotiate. The Ambassador said the Prime Minister could carry Britain in a policy of friendship for Germany and the possibility of a German-­British alliance need not be excluded. (\"If he [Hitler] were prepared to pay the price of the latter by a generous gesture as regards Poland, he could at a stroke change in his favor the whole of public opinion not only in England but in the world.\" Ibid., p. 168. Cf. French, N. 287, pp. 295 f.)\n\nBelgium and The Netherlands offered their good offices to Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. (\". . . in the hope of averting war.\" British, No. 134, p. 242; French; No. 284, p. 294.)\n\nPoland called up more reservists.

(\". . . the written communi­cation received from the British Government gives them [the German Government] the impression that the latter also desire a friendly agreement along the lines indicated to Ambassador Henderson. The German Government desire in this way to give to the British Government and to the British people a proof of the sincerity of the German intention of arriving at a state of permanent friendship with Great Britain.\" German, No. 464, p. 481; British, No. 78, p. 177; No. 79, 80"
