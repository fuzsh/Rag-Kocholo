In two other cases, on Nov. 6, both relating to taxes and both unanimous, the rulings were also in favor of the Ad¬ ministration. In one case the court held, through Justice Black, that the Glenn L.

The O'Keefe decision permitted New York for ernment airplanes. the In other court, the Chief Justice Hughes, refused to let the State of State to tax the salary of Three cases, involving of 000,000 would probably be approached some next calendar year.

Enlargement of the European war area through the Rus¬ sian attack upon Finland, on Nov. 30, brought further state¬ ments by the United States Government which have a bear¬ ing upon our neutral position. When it appeared on Nov. 29 that the quarrel forced by Russia upon Finland was reaching the acute stage, Secretary of State Cordell Hull proclaimed the readiness of the United States to ex¬ tend its good offices for a pacific settlement.

When the Russian invasion of Finland started, on Nov. 30, President Roosevelt addressed identical messages to the Russian and Finnish Governments deploring the ruthless bombing of civilians from the air and appealing for avoidance of such \"inhuman barbarism\" in the conflict then begun.

The spring season has opened slowly due to the inability of buyers and manufacturers to agree upon price. Distributors, mindful of the disappointing retail trade this fall, are hesitant to pay advances, whereas manufacturers are faced with a 10% to 20% increase in costs.

Under the law, the Agricultural Adjustment Admin¬ istration must announce quotas in December of each year times, a the for this year, as revised The quota following year. July 11, was 6,755,000 tons. On Sept. 11, as the result of hoarding and sharply advancing prices immediately fol¬ lowing the outbreak of the European war, President Roose¬ velt announced a temporary suspension of the quota sys¬ tem. In compliance with the law the Cuban duty was automatically increased from 0.90c. to 1.50c. per pound. Thus, pending definite information as to whether the quota system is to be revived for 1940 or some steps to lower the Cuban duty are be be taken, producers were reluctant to make offerings on a liberal scale. It was also pointed out in some quarters that the war influence, although tem¬ porarily dormant as a market factor, has unquestioned longterm bullish potentialities. Sales of Cuban raw sugars were of light volume and consisted of the following, all c. & f. exclusive of duty: On Nov. 10 prompt shipment at 1.80c.; on Nov.. 27 prompt shipment at 1.70c. and 1.72c., and on Nov. 30 prompt shipment at 1.73c.

During the last week of the month senti¬ ment improved again because of the settlement of the pro¬ tracted strike in the Chrysler plants, and growing nervous¬ ness over the increasing number of sinkings in the war zone, and the resulting decision of the Dutch Government to temporarily cancel sailings from Holland.

Retail business made a fairly gratifying showing as increased factory payrolls as well as fears of further price advances stimulated con¬ sumer buying, notably in the industrial sections. Reports from farming districts were somewhat less auspicious, due to adverse weather conditions prevailing in parts of the country. Wholesale trading experienced » a seasonal let¬ down, with retail merchants confining their purchases to The textile trades were quiet, sonal influences and in part due to the scattered fill-in orders on holiday items, and month-end with prepara¬ forming another handicap to business. Prices held fairly steady, although less was heard of delivery difficulties previously encountered in a number of staple items.

Although rates under the new loan program are below current price levels, the belief was held in some quarters that a good many growers will put their product into the loan stock instead of selling it.
