        "text": "1) Compare an Amiga to a NES is a nonsense (in every aspect)\n\n2) Compare a computer of the 80's with a console of that era is a nonsense\n\n3) Saying this : \"Unless you want to suffer through poor game design, terrible controls, horrible ports, do yourself a favor and dismiss the Amiga all together\" is a nonsense (except maybe for Arcade games ported by US Gold )\n\n1 and 2: Saying \"It's nonsense\" and leaving it at that seems like very poor reasoning. People have been comparing games from wildy different systems for a huge variety of reasons since... well, the beginning.\n\nLet's pick one example:\n\nDouble Dragon on Amiga and on NES are completely different beasts. The Amiga might have larger sprites, more colors and higher quality sound effects and voice clips, but the NES has actual music during gameplay and plays a bit smoother (not much because Technos loved their 30 FPS on most of their games, for some reason).\n\nThe Amiga version has multiplayer, while the NES version has an RPG-like system where your character learns new moves as your score raises, chaging how you progress and approach the game. And the level design is veeery different between both.\n\nYou get basically two different experiences by playing each one. And that's just one example. We're not talking about comparing systems, but the games themselves.\n\nAnd about 3) That can be said about every system. NES/Famicom had very poor games too, just like Mega Drive, Super Nintendo, PlayStation and computers. PlayStation 2's library is, basically, made of mostly mediocre games or flatout cashgrab trash, but not many people will think about that when they talk about that system as in their mind they have the decent games.\n\nBad games are a constant wherever you look. Ironically the best ratio of good vs bad games would go for something like the Virtual Boy thanks to having very few games and most being actually okay.\n\nYou are missing all the other \"dungeon crawlers\" that the system had that we can play at the very least in english nowadays, like the Megami Tensei and Deep Dungeon series. Romhacking has been doing an invaluable service to retro gaming by making it possible to play and understand hundreds of games we never could before.\n\nAnd the Super Nintendo has a fair share of such games too, like most of the Wizardry series on it, even an exclusive one with Wizardry Gaiden IV which is really, really neat. And a bunch of Megami Tensei games too. I can't really say much about Mega Drive, because I only remember Dungeon's & Dragons: Warriors of the Eternal Sun and Shining in the Darkness, and the first one is a hybrid of different genres.\n\nBut sure, certain systems usually stand out for specific genres, like the Mega Drive and PC-Engine with Shoot'em Ups, and Super Nintendo with jRPGs, for example. Which is exactly why I like exploring each system's library and try to find all sorts of games that I could enjoy, there's usually a lot more than what's on the surface.\n\n----\n\nAs I said on my previous post, at this point we have an \"infinite\" amount of retro games to swim through. Each of us has their own tastes and ways to look and value things, yet talking and debating on a healthy way about game versions is fun and useful.\n\nPS: Now that I mentioned Wizardry, I feel the need to recommend Wizardry: The Tale of the Forsaken Town on PS2. One of the most fun dungeon crawlers I've played purely based onf exploring the dungeon itself and how many events you can witness, and the battle system being quite fun with allied actions.\n\n@CrashMidnick\n\nOk. The price tag was 1 reason the Amiga didn't sell well. One thing not possible in those days was to pirate console (Nintendo, Sega, NEC, SNK) software, which we all know was abused for the Commodore and Sinclair.\n\nThe gaming developers for the Amiga knew this was a problem but could not do anything about it, as a result, great effort was not put forth in developing top tier quality.\n\nI know who did thier thing... Team 17, Gremlin, Bitmap and few others made top quality games. At the end of the journey, Amiga is a taste of perfection but riddled with glaring issues for 85-90% of the gaming library.\n\nI think dismissing the NES as an infant console is a common misconception to those who are young or never experienced the truly great library it has. If were going to compare apples to bananas, the NES is the holy grail of all gaming systems, console or computer!!! Period!\n\nI don't dislike the Amiga, further from the truth. However, when i play so many poor efforts the Amiga has to offer compared to other systems, it really is disgraceful knowing how much power and ability were never used.\n\nHere i leave you with text/ini files of Art Covers. These are for Wii WiiFlow plugin compatibility. Please let me know if i am missing any games that are not covered. My ignorance of Amiga must get better, but is impossible when the same 30 games are always mentioned in a 12.000 game library.\n\nThe game list is quite complete for stock Amiga's, I would add those 80+ (you missed some very good ones such as AB3D2, wrath of the deamon, EVILS DOOM, LOTR, Genetic species...) :\n\nAlien Breed 3D 2 (AGA)\n\nAmegas\n\nAmnios\n\nAthanor 2 (OCS/AGA)\n\nBarbarian Plus (AGA)\n\nBattle Chess 2\n\nBlack viper (OCS/AGA)\n\nBlack Dawn series\n\nBlack sect\n\nBombJack Beer edition\n\nCenter court 2 (AGA)\n\nCombat Air Patrol\n\nDangerous Street (AGA)\n\nDeep core\n\nDenis (AGA)\n\nDetroit (OCS/AGA)\n\ndragons lair 1\n\ndragons lair 2\n\ndragons lair 3\n\nEvils Doom (AGA)\n\nFighting Spirit (AGA)\n\nInviyya\n\nTime Gal (OCS/AGA)\n\nFull contact\n\nGem stone Legend\n\nGenetic Species\n\nGloom Deluxe\n\nGuardian (AGA)\n\nHeart of the alien\n\nIkari Warriors\n\nIndigo\n\nJurassic Park (OCS/AGA)\n\nKatakis\n\nKickOff3 (AGA)\n\nKnightmare\n\nlords of the realism (AGA)\n\nMaria Renard’s Revenge\n\nMetal Gear\n\nMEMO (AGA)\n\nNEONnoir\n\nNicky Boom 2\n\nNucleus\n\nOath\n\nObitus\n\nPinball mania\n\nPremiere\n\nRampage\n\nRoad Avenger (OCS/AGA)\n\nRotator\n\nRubicon\n\nRygar AGA\n\nSaint Dragon\n\nShaq Fu (OCS/AGA)\n\nSmash Tennis (IDEA)\n\nSpace Ace 1\n\nSpace Ace 2\n\nSuperC\n\nSuper Cars 2 AGA\n\nSuper Sprint (AGA)\n\nTiny Bubble\n\nTiny galaga\n\nTiny Invaders\n\nTangram\n\nTynius\n\nTrolls\n\nTurrican II AGA\n\nUNSquadron\n\nWrath of the Deamon\n\nVideokid\n\nViolator\n\nWhizz (AGA)\n\nWonderboy (ARCADE)\n\nXevious1200\n\nXP8 (OCS/AGA)\n\nAdventure of quik & silva\n\nDragon tiles 1\n\nDragon Tiles 2\n\nGreen berret\n\nIncaman\n\nKilling Machine\n\nMega twins\n\nMercs\n\nNinja spirit\n\nRackney\n\nRed Zone\n\nSlayer\n\nZaxxon\n\nI did not put all PC ports such as Doom, Doom 2, W3D, Quake, Quake2, Exhumed, Duke Nukem 3D, Blood... or heavy RTG games. And of course all games from de 060/PPC era such as Wipout 2097 that the Wii will not be able to emulate.\n\n1 and 2: Saying \"It's nonsense\" and leaving it at that seems like very poor reasoning.

One of the most fun dungeon crawlers I've played purely based onf exploring the dungeon itself and how many events you can witness, and the battle system being quite fun with allied actions.\n\nI will repeat once again and one last time so that it will be clear (I hope) : I like to play games on each system (including the NES). so that you two understand, I have all Nintendo consoles at home and all Amiga's You can check my posts here I am on pretty much all Nintendo sub forum, I can send you a picture if you want to do child play. On top of that, I now the NES romset very well. FOR ME it is really bad (japanese translations or not). But this is MY opinion, respect that. I will respect yours.\n\nBut, once again, I posted here because I saw the \"trash\"' 1st post. I cannot let future readers to see that without saying anything. I am done with all of this now.\n\nAnd yes comparing the NES to an Amiga is a nonsense, poor reasoning or not from your point of view. If it makes sense, then you will end up with this (I took the best one according to this site https://retrododo.com/best-nes-racing-games/):\n\nHonestly, if that's what Retrododo thinks it's the best racing for the platform, they've made a rather poor job of research... And also not a great way to make an argument.\n\nThere are more interesting options to check out. No disrespect to F1-Race as while it might look too simple for today, for its time was a very respectable attempt to bring that sort of visual trickery to the Famicom without the use of any special mapper, and one example of how important HAL Lab and Satoru Iwata were to Nintendo so early.\n\nAnyway... Besides things more well known like the two Rad Racers, which play well and are pretty smooth, you also have more experimental and... Let's say \"deeper\" gameplay like Formula One - Built to Race and Taito Grand Pix - Eiko no License (which is playable in english through a fan translation).\n\nBoth games offer a rather meaty experience for 8 Bits. You go around a large map with several cities, each one has their own racing tournaments of varying difficulties and other services like shops where you can customize your car. The games have you taking licenses to take part in harder challenges, improving your vehicle and are pretty smooth playing, and hey, they also have music during gameplay, which is infinitely better than listening to the constant sound of the car engine in many, many racing games out there.\n\nYou could sort of call them CaRPGs, even. And then you have weird stuff like Eliminator Boat Duel with different gameplay styles throughout the race. And 3D Hot Rally is also pretty cute, although less smooth than the other games framerate-wise.\n\nOf course Lotus Turbo Challenge looks nice, those 3d-ish effects where it goes through tunnels lool really slick; and seems smoother than a large number of games that you could find in systems like the Mega Drive or SNES, but the experience that it provides is a much more straightforward and simple, closer to your Outron styled-game compared to the games I mention, trying to make up for their simple visuals with different mechanics and some sort of progression system.\n\nAnd there must be more out there, I do not know every single NES/Famicom racing game.\n\nWith all that said; I have to agree that RunningSnakes' comment was too generalized, even if they are his honest feelings. That is what I think is the core of the entire hangup going on here.\n\nFIRST, I Want to say like to say I LIKE RunningSnakes for what he said, and like him:\n\nThe AMIGA UAE on WII is outstanding because is MUCH Easier to use than UAE on PC that hasn't got the same Ergonomy, the ERGONOMY of this Emulator on PC has ALWAYS BEEN SHIT, compared it to the wii AMIGA EMU!!\n\nTHE DEV OF UAE SHOULD TAKE IN CONSIDERATION WHAT THE DEV OF THIS EMU DID, because they have something blocked somewhere toward simplicity, I Still think the pc version of UAE is not a good feeling as it should be.\n\nAlso, I must say, AMIGA had some ergonomy issue with joystick and the copies of games and many other things, it was often a pain in the neck like there was many problem with the ATARI ST too but we had to go through them! A bit like the WIIU had many problematic Ergonomic and questionnable points! ^^\n\nAlso, I'm understand the point of view, and like Tetsuo I mostly agree with Runningsnakes on a somes points.\n\nThing is, mostly, at that Time, many had an Amiga, and were ATTACHED to it!! IT's simple, many people had a lot of pirated games and could play it!!! Whereas it wasn't the case on NES or MASTER SYSTEM, people could have had those consoles at around the same time, but games prices were VERY High!!! I Doubt a standard kid would have had more than 20 Games at that time considering the prices, also, people were using their game AND EXPLORING it to the END!!!! IT wasn't BINGE VIDEO GAME Watching like TODAY!!! You had to be amaze to what you were seen because their was nothing else, you hadn't much choice of video game to play like today!!\n\nI think you are less age than a couple of us, RunningSnakes, so that's why you were less Attached to your amiga than some of us responding to you , question of time, many that loved the Amiga Are around age More than 45 Now\n\nAll considered, only a few games remain, some exclusives:\n\nHired GUN, FLOOD, Populous 1&2, Shadow of the Beast I&II&III, Dungeon Master, Supercars 2, Apydia, PRoject X, HYBRIS, Silkworm, ring of medusa, bloodmoney, Nebulus, Legend of Faerghail, Captive, Sensible world of soccer and my FAVORITE OF ALL MULTIPLAYER GAME: BOMBERMAN (with 4 Players ADAPTER) Were JEWELS at that time and still are\n\nI've played many games on it, and some games are still not as good on PC nowadays!!\n\nAlso, some DEV have developed recently quite interesting games on it (SolomonsKey2, The \"New\" Rygar, the \"new\" TinyGradius!\n\nOn the POINT&CLICK adventure Game, I think you're right they were \"almost\" all bad on AMIGA, with HORRIBLE Loading time, the Pc was King for this I must Admit.\n\nI would compare the Amiga to consoles but more to WHAT THE PC WAS AT THAT TIME, OF COURSE!!\n\n\"except maybe for Arcade games ported by US Gold\"\n\n=> US GOLD People Should be ASHAMED Reading THIS!! Sooo True!\n\nRunningSnakes VS CRASHMIDNICK, no need to have kinda fight, you are both right ;-)​\n\nRunning, don't forget, many are more \"nostalgic\" than you are and knew the amiga system better....This variable has a bit scrambled your omni radar conclusive mind device, nostalgia isn't a crime, but I understand your overall conclusion.\n\nThe Sega/Nintendo legacy is amazing on both side, it's more \"users related\" on the Amiga.\n\n@CrashMidnick: Thanks!! I Didn't remember of Videokid!!! Ninja Spirit was better on the atari ST to me, arcade version is underrated like Dragon Breed. Like you, I owned many consoles, and I do like all like youl.Sometimes, we must admit some systems had drawbacks even at the time, even I loved my A500 and A1200 (which wasn't even fully compatible of backward compatible like the PS5 should have been with all PS XX). You remind me Luffy with the Queen Merry, makes you loyal ^^\n\n@Maeson Yes, for me too, Wizardry: The Tale of the Forsaken Town (PS2) is one of the best dungeon crawler yet, and we don't even find anything as good nowadays? What a joke!! I like the mystery, I like this better than Zelda, question of taste I suppose, This was gaming for me!"
