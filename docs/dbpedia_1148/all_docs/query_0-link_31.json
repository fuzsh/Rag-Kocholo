        "text": "22. Pizza Tower (PC) [Finished September 6th, 2023] - 8.5:\n\nPizza Tower had me feeling a certain way that I never really have with games. Theoretically it should be a perfect game to me, but something about starting it up often gave me a feeling I can only compare to anxiety. It's definitely a mood game, or more like an anti-mood game, I wouldn't recommend it if you're tired or not in the mood for a fast paced game. But when you get into it, it's really good. It's probably the most \"perfect\" indie game I've ever played, polished to perfection and with an art style that is uniquely its own. Focusing on the best parts of crude cartoons (notably, very little disgustingness), it creates one of the more eclectic and ecentric platforming worlds. The only thing I can really think of as a \"negative\" - and it's not really a negative per say - is that the gimmicks in this game are used in a somewhat strange way. They're not really \"power ups\" and more like the transformations from Yoshi's island, but the level-specific transformations and forms you get to use for Peppino don't really improve your move set or challenge the player in any major way. Peppino is so versatile as a character already that a lot of the transformations don't really have you do anything better than you have before, just slightly different. It's not really a problem though, just something that I think is an interesting observation.\n\nOne actual complaint I do have is the soundtrack. The soundtrack for Pizza Tower has become one of the most famous in indie game history in the span of just a few months, and it's easy to see why. It's very powerful, and any track by itself could easily be one of the more memorable in another game. But I kind of think too many of them belong in the same vein of overly catchy fast paced melodic tunes, to the point that a lot of it ends up being less impactful than it probably should be. It's still great, and there's usually a point in a stage where you'll think \"oh fuck myself, this song IS just as good as the last one\". But I found myself wishing there was more songs like the tutorial's Funiculi Holiday, which is fairly relaxing compared to the rest of the soundtrack even at its most explosive, or Tombstone, Arizona, which has one of the most amazing build ups in video game music history. Still, this is hardly a complaint seeing as two songs have already entered my top 30 game songs of all time. I look forward to replaying this next year and hopefully getting over my weird issues. Highly recommended.\n\n23. Super Mario Bros (NS) [Finished September 6th, 2023] - 8.0:\n\nGrowing up, I wasn't a fan of 2D Mario. In fact, I didn't like Mario platformers in general. So I was curious to see what I'd think revisiting the games now that I'm older and tenuously excited for the upcoming Super Mario Wonder release.\n\nThere's two things that clued me in that I might like Mario 1: I loved Mario Maker 2, which was for all intents and purposes is a 2D Mario game, and I liked Mario Flash as a kid. This game is so charming in so many ways. Perhaps the most obvious is that early NES vibe it has, which has created one of the most iconic pixel art styles of all time. There's a lot of charm to just how rudimentary it is, but most of all, how imaginative it is relative to the time and even today. Things like going on the top of the screen to access a warp pipe, the multitude of different environments, the way the physics interact with the enemies, etc. But beyond that, the simplicity of the game also means that the soundtrack has to be extremely melodic, as is the case with many NES soundtracks, and it's especially true here. 1-1 might be overplayed, but for my money, it's still a much better opener than Mario 3's opening theme, and less repetitive than Bomb-omb battlefield.\n\nIt even has, somehow, one of the greatest platforming levels I've ever played (the cheep cheep level), despite being 30+ years old. Most of all, I think the fact that the games levels are generally open enough, and that the games controls are generally more rigid than later games, allows it to exist in this cool middle ground between Mario 3 and Super Mario World retroactively. It has the linearity of Mario 3, but without the fuck you physics and less bottomless pits and enemy traps, allowing for more player expression and experimentation. At the same time, it isn't as open as Super Mario World, so there can be some actual degree of challenge to its linearity. It's a great in-between that makes me wish more Mario games were like this. My only real complaint is that the game starts running out of ideas by the middle point, and that 7-4 and 8-4 are some of the worst levels I've ever played. But that's typical for an NES game, right?\n\n24. Super Mario Bros 2 (NS) [Finished September 8th, 2023] - 8.0:\n\nNow that I've played it, put me firmly in the camp that thinks this game is underrated. I know it gets a lot of praise and acclaim for being a good platformer and probably the least contentious of the big three NES sequels (Mario 2, Zelda 2, Castlevania 2), but to me it deserves even more than that - this really deserves to be its own series under Nintendo. The mixture of adventure style gameplay with puzzle platforming is infectious, and I love it to bits. Granted if you were to break down what you were doing at any given moment, truthfully speaking it wouldn't be all that interesting. A lot of the spontaneity of Mario is gone with this sequel, which I do think upon further reflection is a bit of a shame. Most of what you'll be doing is getting on top of an enemy, throwing it, clearing a path to a vine or area you need to jump to, getting on it, dogging enemies, then rinse and repeat. Mario might sound formulaic in general under this methodoly of explanation, but the key difference is that no one jump feels the same in Mario because its a physics based platformer. Mario 2, despite being quite frantic at times, places the least importance on the spontaneity of Mario, and that probably could have been balanced out better with the advent puzzle platformer aspect.\n\nBut man, that adventure puzzle platformer aspect. Never before has playing an NES game and figuring out what to do by yourself been so gratifying. Levels are somehow big without being easy to get lost in, and throughout my playthrough I never had to use a guide except for in the very beginning when I didn't realize the vases were basically pipes, which is ironically untrue for both Mario 1 and 3 despite this being the exploration based game. There are some problems though. For one, the bosses in this game aren't great and it can be really frustrating how tiny their attack window is, or how small the explosion is of bombs, both in and outside of combat. Two, the way the heart mechanic is executed is kind of terrible, if really interesting conceptually. Mario has to hold the potion and use it to get to the other world and get the heart, but some of the levels place the hearts later from where you get the potion, meaning you have to carry it around and can't use your hands. This is theoretically an amazing game design concept - making it so you can't use your hands and are preoccupied. But in execution what this actually means is that you have to go on a scavenger hunt for where to place the potion, which is terrible because if its wrong its used up, on top of not being able to defend yourself. This mechanic would actually work better in a standard Mario game, you could make Mario weighted down with smaller jumps, that way you can still defend yourself but you have to be more careful and time things correctly. But the worst part of it really is how arbitrary it is, having to search for where to use it properly is a terrible mechanic. And of course, I'm sure everyone who's played this has faced some frustration at not being able to stomp on enemies, at one point or another, you're going to eventually face a claustrophobic environment where you can't kill enemies properly. Those digging parts are atrocious.\n\nFrankly if this game didn't also run out of ideas at about the halfway point, while also being 2.5x longer than Mario 1, it would probably be the better game, but alas that repetition is hard to overlook. Mario 1 just benefits a lot from being a pick up and play game. As it is, it's a toss up. I really like them both, and I have a lot of love for how quirky of a game this is. Also, I love that you get transported to a surreal dark Mario world that plays the 1-1 theme. Best use of the theme ever.\n\nI'm too tired, I'll talk about how Mario 3 is bad in the morning.\n\n1.

I played 2 when it came out around halfway and then got distracted. Then when 3’s release was impending, I picked 2 back up finished it and then played 2 and was on this Xenoblade high as I went into 3. Which I eventually stopped at a climactic point, and then now as Tears is impending I picked 3 back up, put in like 30 more hours (115 total I believe) and then finished it’s story DLC. But no I’m on a Xenoblade high again and I’m trying really hard not to dive right into the first game’s DE on switch because I know it’ll get lost again bc of Zelda and I’m not trying to have a 3rd dropped playthrough of it on a new system. But I need something to distract myself in the run up to May 12. Maybe it’s a good time for Prime\n\nOk big update\n\n8) Tears of the Kingdom - Incredible game that I don’t think I can rate as separate from Breath of the Wild because of how instrumental that game is in what Tears is and does. Probably as a pair one of my top video game experiences of all time\n\n9) Metroid Prime Remastered - another incredible game that was my first time playing it after having only played some of fusion and most of dread. I’ve got the trilogy on WiiU though so if get around to them before updated releases I’m excited to play 2 and 3\n\n10) What remains of Edith Finch - A game I bought a while ago and just never got to. The shorter play time and narrative focus was a nice change up from the last 2 games and had some cool ideas going on. Didn’t have too many expectations going in and was pleasantly surprised\n\n11) Disco Elysium: The Final Cut - What an amazing experience this was, the way the world and it’s people would change based on my decisions was super cool, felt like playing an actual table top RPG. It also had me doing lots of pondering and I got really attached to some of the characters, Kim <3. But truly like what a masterclass in interactive storytelling, had a great time diving in to and really unearthing the world and it’s themes, some really powerful moments in there.\n\n12) Pikmin 4 - I love love Pikmin and oatchi was so cute that despite trying to wait to get it I caved sooner, and while there’s still lots of Pikmin goodness in there I think it left me wanting more of what 3 was doing. The shift of all multitasking to the caves only and making the maps more exploration focused would’ve been fine if they had some way to integrate them better but entering the caves ruined any flow I had going on above ground to the point that I’d just leave all the caves for last for each level and then do them one after another which got grating. To the point that I don’t have an desire to do the final cave and boss (still completed it though )\n\n13) Ty the Tasmanian Tiger - Dug up my PS2 and started playing this one Saturday and ended up investing a decent few hours into 100%ing the first few levels and then in the following days got further than I ever did as a child. I needed 3 more thunder eggs to unlock the final boss which I never saw before but I think I’ve gotten my fill with the revisit\n\n14) Bombrush Cyberfunk - What a fun game to just play and move around in. The trick system made it great to just mess around in the overworld and the soundtrack was a Cherry on top, lots of songs entering my playlists. Had never played Jet Set before but this made me interested although from my understanding this is an evolution of that, so would be interested in I go back and see the origins. Excited for any future plans with the franchise if they exist.\n\nWhen I first posted in this thread one of my intentions was to make a decent dent in my backlog and well, except for Edith Finch and Ty all the other games in this update were ones that I bought recently. Trying to decide what to play next and I’m torn between old things I haven’t gotten to yet and new used games I bought of stuff I’ve always wanted to play. Too much to play and too little time, but that’s always how it goes~\n\n1. Desperados III [ PC ] - 9\n\n2. Ace Attorney Investigations: Prosecutor's Path ( Replay ) [ DS*] - 10\n\n3.

[ PC ] - 7.5\n\nReally like this and a new life from Angela He, bittersweet stories with a nice mechanic that integrates a more gamey element with these short visual novels with some adventure game elements without spoiling much or lack of a better term. Short but sweet titles, could have had more to it in some sequences tho, think a new life feels more well rounded as a story despite both being around the same lenght.\n\n41. Peakmin 3 ( Replay ) [ NS ] - 10 - First Switch playthrough, 5th overall.\n\nI like time limits, specifically some form of deadline, the good Atelier games, Pikmin 1 and 3, Lightning Returns, Majora's Mask, Unsighted, Potionomics, etc.\n\nThe adrenaline of being on the clock, and the context given for it elevates these experiences, Pikmin for example, it bolsters the aspect of survival, Olimar due to his life support system, and the captains of 3 trying to save their planet from extinction due to the lack of resources, a moon threatening to destroy Termina in 3 days, etc.\n\nWhile Pikmin 3's \"day limit\" or limit measured by the fruits you collect, is eventually trivialized by the amount of juice you get out of them (despite that I will say the first week or so has a decent amount of tension, and depending on your exploration, it does the same near the end when your resources get stolen later on in the game) I think there is an aspect of adding a hard timer or schedule system to these types of games that doesn't get brought up, is that once you apply a deadline like this to finish the game, developers have to pace it so it doesn't become frustrating to start over, these games have really good pacing, almost fully pure meaningful content with almost no fat, and become very replayable, which at least to me offsets any comment about being \"too short\" whatever that means to each person.\n\nWhile there are elements that I think are too streamlined in Pikmin 3, the fact that your pikmin seemingly can't be deflowered by wind gusts or enemies pushing them away is something that trivializes certain enemy attacks since there isn't any consequence for not timing your whistles, more so if the Pikmin aren't vulnerable to elemental attacks and such. Pikmin speed is a bit too high so that leaflings aren't as much of a nuisance to control around, they don't trip anymore, etc. this is otherwise Pikmin at its best mechanically, and really good showcase of time management and efficiency, even if partly optional. One can go through the game without using the 3 captains efficiently, but that does mean less time to do things, just mastering 2 is a good time saver, and with 3 it means having mastery on the game and its mechanics that accentuates the moment to moment strategy element of the series.\n\nPresentation wise is still my favorite of the series counting 4, I love the photorealism and I think that is better achieved in this game than 4, the camera angles and detail gives most frames of the different locations feel like they could be those nature postcards, the textures on the enemies give it a realistic finish that makes great contrast with their otherwise cartoony looking designs, the lighting in the cave areas, everything looks beautiful.\n\nMusic is fantastic with a lot of great atmospheric tracks with a catchy melody that encapsulated that feeling of being out in nature so well, and by the end its more unnerving tracks are a highlight of the series.\n\nSome of those streamlined elements and the lower difficulty, combined with a less punishing timer are aspects that the first Pikmin game does better, the only thing holding back the original is some very specific unnecessary jankiness, made me think of giving it a 9 and most of the experience is like that, equal to the first game in its own way. But that last area man, the whole ending sequence of Pikmin 3 remains the series' best moment on all aspects, the storytelling, the culmination and celebration of the stories of 1 and 2 as they get intertwined with 3's, the unnerving and bizarre elements of Pikmin being brought to the front full force, and on a gameplay level, a fantastic showcase of multitasking, efficiency and level design of what makes Pikmin so good, easily the best cave in the series, plus a great boss fight coupled with a great battle and ending credits theme as a nice bowtie to the whole experience. Definitely the factor that gives the edge to 3 for me.\n\n42. Eternal Darkness [ GC ] - 8.5\n\nA very unique game, very ambitious which are both its strenghts and weaknesses. It definitely has that skeleton of great mechanics that needed a different focus to be fully fleshed out, maybe more development time or a remake/sequel.\n\nThe combat for example, have a great variety of both melee and ranged weapons thanks to the game taking place across multiple time periods, plus it has a pretty extensive magic system, ranging from shields, magic attacks, recovery spells, and summons of different kinds of enemies you encounter in the game, plus you can lock on to different parts of the enemies and cut off those parts, like the head of a lot of undead enemies so they don't absorb your health/magic/sanity, hit their weak points, or aim for non armored parts. It has a lot of depth on paper but there a good lack of enemy variety to take full advantage of those systems, they basically serve to exist as a helping hand if you are struggling too much, or stuff to mess around and experiment, but you can get through most of the game with melee, aim for the head, and occassionally use recovery spells, plus a lot of enemies can be walked around or skipped with decent mobility.\n\nA mechanic that is used welll through the game is the stamina, you can't tell from a bar how much you have left, so you have to measure yourself how much you'll run before your character starts getting tired, low health will also make you limp, so recovering is always a priority during combat encounters. also each character has a different amount of stamina/health/magic/sanity/ meter on top of the variety of weapons, making each of them feel distinct enough.\n\nThe game is like an action adventure game with psychological horror elements, is not really purely survival like a Resident Evil, there is a ton of ammo, the level design and progression is pretty linear the whole way through, can save anywhere, but that psychological aspect and the ambition of its setting is what makes it stand out as something to be played at least once even today.\n\nThe game consists of 12 chapters with short intermissions in between, the intermissions and a couple of chapters you take control of the main character Alexandra as she explores the mansion and reads the tome of Eternal Darkness, the other chapters consists of many moments in the lives of people that had the tome and fought against the arrival of the Ancients into the world, bunch of cosmic horror creatures. Get to see some changes across 4 main locations across time and with different context given the character you are using, is a pretty cool set up for any game really.\n\nThere is also the thing that most people know from it which are the sanity effects, they are still really cool and managed to surprise me more than once with some of them.\n\nThe game has multiple endings but I don't know if I'll get to that anytime soon, the linearity and design of the game makes it feel less replayable than other horror games, tho the game does change the element that gets absorbed from you during enemy attacks plus some boss encounters are different, is basically your difficulty selection, picking green to have enemies absorb your sanity is the least difficult and honestly the better choice to go for on a first playthrough, it will pretty much enable you to experience all the sanity effects more easily and having your sanity reduced to 0 won't kill you, picking red is like a hard mode, because obviously having 0 health causes a game over and enemies will absorb that.\n\nAlso peak presentation, there is something I love about the production values of Gamecube games, always comes off as more impressive to me than most modern games today, the level of detail for the time, the atmosphere and vibes a title like Eternal Darkness can produce, there is something timeless and endearing about all of it.\n\n13. Starfield (XBX)\n\nWhen starfield was first announced I was instantly interesting even though I was fully aware of how risky it was to be excited for a Bethesda game that'll be at risk of be a jankfest. The hype only went up as they showed it off, reaching a peak this passed Summer Games Fest. So I was more than excited to start the game up when it went live on Gamepass.\n\nAnd finally the adventure began. Except it didn't lol. The marketing for the game promoted this idea of freedom. The main story even forces you to join a group called The Constellation, which focuses on exploring. At first exploring the large amount of systems, planets and moons is fun and interesting, but eventually the fun turns into a slog. Not a lot of variety between the planets and moons and constantly being forced to deal with load screens to take off, fly to another place, then land is tiring. It takes way to long to do these things(and other things as well). And speaking of planets, Earth is boring. What they did with Earth is nothing short of unimaginative and nonsensical. Don't bother going out of your way to check it out.\n\nThe other things that encumber this freedom, is well, encumbrance. It's more of a nuisance in the beginning of the game but that's a part of the game where it shouldn't be one. Did I mention load times? The menu is slow, especially after playing for hours in one game session. You will have to close the game down and then boot it back up from time to time. Gives Pokemon Scarlet/Violet vibes. Other things that slow the game down are your companions. They don't shut up. About to go up against a team of mercs? Your companion may just keep asking to talk to you where they tell you their life story. At one point I couldn't continue the main story unless I finished a side quest for my companion. Now I probably could've kicked her out of the crew but the fact I'd have to do to that is weird.\n\nThe next complaint has to do with the role play aspect of the game. It's lackluster. I assume it depends on the character background and if I had to guess Bounty Hunter, Pirate and Soldier probably bring the best RP. I tried to rp my character but between The Constellation arc and my character background there wasn't much to it. Not a lot of dialogue options for you to feel immersed, however there was a bright spot with the Neon Street Rat trait. I wonder if it is my fault and not so much the game so it'll be interesting to see what I get when a decide to go the pirate or bounty hunter route.\n\nThe game isn't that buggy. There are a few weird bugs here and there but nothing too terrible. Game crashed a couple times but the game itself autosaves enough to lessen the impact.\n\nNow I went on a lot with what I didn't like. So you may be shocked to know that I have finished the game and continued onwards to a NG+ and will start a new file in the future to play a different character. I did reach a point in the game where I almost stopped playing. Eventually I decided to stop getting distracted and just focus on the main story. And it was the best decision. About half way through the main story the game finally shows you what it's actually about and it doesn't let up ending in what I thought was an enthralling and immersive final two missions. It's a bit weird to say but I don't really think this is a game about exploring and enjoying space. But rather, the game seems more about enjoying the idea of space and the questions it poses to humanity. And I can respect that even with my gripes. The story is interesting and even the characters you meet a long the way are as well. They are all well written and developed.\n\nStarfield is an imperfect game exploring the imperfect beauty and nature of space along with its meaning to us. There is a great game to be had here but the game itself goes out of its way to stop it. It's actually frustrating how close it comes to being great but it never reaches it's potential. (7/10)"
