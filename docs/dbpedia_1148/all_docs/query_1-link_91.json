The graphics are pretty well done, the story is fascinating, and the gameplay is pretty good. I played and loved it. So has anyone else around here played this game? And what did you think of it?\n\ni have it, its quite very nice indeed. i loved it and still go back to it once in a while. great graphics, really great soundtrack, good gameplay.\n\ni recomend prince of persia: sands of time, if you like action games, i know its a different game but surprised me as much as rigar.\n\nI remember playing the original, but never got around to trying the PS2 update. Been meaning to though- afterall, that they actually dug up Rygar in of itself is worth at least a play."
