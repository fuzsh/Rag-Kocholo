        "text": "Inscryption!!! While I think it sold pretty well, it's definitely not a game most people are familiar with outside of indie enthusiasts on a gaming forum.\n\nView: https://youtu.be/uAn7OxLub9Y?si=WpeXDNfpUfzD2l2D\n\nI don't like roguelikes or deck-builders, but I adore this game. It's so much more than that because it's a wild, experimental combination of excape room, horror, deck-building, roguelikes, found footage, with various artstyles that are dramatically different and a whole mess of secrets that even bleed into the real world to discover everything. It's just so creative, cool, and fun. If you're the kind of person that looks for games that do something different, absolutely give it a shot.\n\nView: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1092790/Inscryption/\n\nShadow of Destiny. It's about a guy time-traveling in the past to find out who keeps on killing him in the future. I can't describe why I like it. I guess it was just something new to me (concept-wise) at the time that clicked with me. It's a game that I look upon fondly.\n\nShadow of Destiny. It's about a guy time-traveling in the past to find out who keeps on killing him in the future. I can't describe why I like it. I guess it was just something new to me (concept-wise) at the time that clicked with me. It's a game that I look upon fondly.\n\nA fantastic shout. I need to replay it; I did all endings, but I genuinely can't remember like 95% of the game these days.\n\nIt's called Shadow of Memories here in the UK though, if anyone from here is interested in looking it up.\n\nMonster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom became one of my favorite Metroidvanias thanks to the shoutout it received in GOTY awards from Digital Foundry the year that it released, and up to that point, I had zero interest in ever playing it.\n\nIt's because IMO the gameplay is really satisfying—every transformation and its abilities feels fun to use as you progress, the core combat and platforming has a nice sense of polish and tuning that feels just right, and I love the the vibrant and hand drawn presentation. The music is also catchy—it's the only game in its series that I've played and I only did a single 100% playthrough of the game but tracks from the game still get stuck in my head.\n\nIt's such a charming and satisfying gem.\n\nEight of my top 10 all time are unranked, but as of this writing Wide Ocean Big Jacket and Norco are 1 and 2 in that order. Wide Ocean Big Jacket is about a camping trip, Norco is about finding your brother, who's gone missing shortly after the death of your mother.\n\nOne free-to-play game I typically shoutout in these kinds of threads is Alien Squatter. In it you play as a homeless alien trying to get by in a synth grunge version of Japan. It's thoughtful, it's bizarre, it's humorous, it's resentful, it's charming, it's bleak. Has so much to say about class and privilege, the dark underbellies of society, and the systems that are meant to protect just to swallow you up every chance they get. Highly recommended if you want to painstakingly manage your resources as you make your way through an impressive and imposing world, or if you just wanted to eat a bowl of curry only to end up adopting a piglet that somehow survived being cooked.\n\nShadow of Destiny.

I guess it was just something new to me (concept-wise) at the time that clicked with me. It's a game that I look upon fondly.\n\nFor sure agree with you. Good game!\n\n999 - puzzle game with a great story\n\nI've not beaten 999 yet, but every body I know says VLR is good. Most I knew were mixed on ZTD though.\n\nFor me..\n\nSave 52% on Arcade Paradise on Steam\n\nManage profits, pick up gum, do the laundry and get coin to unlock arcade units and flip the family laundromat business to become an Arcade Paradise!\n\nSave 50% on Citizen Sleeper on Steam\n\nRoleplaying in the ruins of interplanetary capitalism. Live the life of an escaped worker, washed-up on a lawless station at the edge of an interstellar society. Inspired by the flexibility and freedom of TTRPGs, explore the station, choose your friends, escape your past and change your future.\n\nFor older games/titles I find underrated, but maybe underlooked too...\n\n- Rygar: The Legendary Adventure\n\n- Mister Mosquito\n\n- The Sword Of Etheria\n\n- God Hand\n\nI say Backbreaker Vengeance in every one of these threads and I'm not about to stop now.\n\nIt's an obstacle course game with an american football coat of paint. Super satisfying game feel and hilarious ragdoll physics. It shines as a two-player vs experience.\n\nIt continues to be fully overlooked based on the amount of replies I get, either in interest or agreement. And it's a damn shame because it's so much more fun than it seems like it should be.\n\nView: https://youtu.be/yOK0Qc4WNBs?si=-2GvMzGDmAZV5Zm7\n\n- YouTube\n\nEnjoy the videos and music you love, upload original content, and share it all with friends, family, and the world on YouTube.\n\nThe Hobbit. It was a Zelda-clone for Xbox, GameCube and PS2. It did a great job at capturing the essence of the book and made the world of Middle-Earth feel alive and charming. Good music, good gameplay, and pretty good voice acting too imo. The combat could have used some more work, but it was awesome wielding Bilbo's walking stick, Sting, throwing rocks, and eventually The One Ring while traveling through most of the locales featured in the books. It's complete with dungeons, collectibles, and so forth.\n\nIt's very likely the best licensed LOTR video game, although I've never played The Third Age.\n\nEight of my top 10 all time are unranked, but as of this writing Wide Ocean Big Jacket and Norco are 1 and 2 in that order. Wide Ocean Big Jacket is about a camping trip, Norco is about finding your brother, who's gone missing shortly after the death of your mother.\n\nOne free-to-play game I typically shoutout in these kinds of threads is Alien Squatter.
