It was sent to the show by Spencer Hollingsworth.\n\nEpisodes[]\n\nNES Weird\n\nWeirdly Sexy\n\nButt Nightmares\n\nJoin Forces with Rygar!\n\nFinale\n\nGame Information[]\n\nRygar, released in Japan as Arugosu no Senshi: Hachamecha Daishingeki (アルゴスの戦士 はちゃめちゃ大進撃?) is a fantasy-themed action-adventure platform game with action RPG elements developed by Tecmo for the Nintendo Famicom.[3] It was released on April 14, 1987, in Japan and later that year in the United States for the NES. A European release came in 1990.\n\nGameplay[edit] The player sends the title character (who did not have a proper name in the Japanese version) through a number of fantastic settings with the ultimate goal of defeating the evil King Ligar in order to restore peace to the realm of Argool (Argus in the Japanese version). To accomplish this goal, Rygar/the Warrior must visit five Indora gods who present him with essential items needed for completion of the game. Each of the Indora gods is located in a different realm, and is almost always guarded by a boss. The player can choose the order in which some stages are played, but since certain items are required to reach new areas, choices are somewhat limited. After playing through the five major realms of the game, he must journey to King Ligar's flying castle for the final confrontation.\n\n\"Ligar\" (the final boss) can also be romanized as Rygar because in Japanese there is no distinction between \"l\" and \"r,\" but the name is written with the syllable ra (ラ) in katakana. The central player character is only known as senshi (the Warrior) in the Japanese version.\n\nThis page uses Creative Commons Licensed content from Wikipedia (view authors).\n\nTrivia[]\n\nArin's dad found a cartridge of the game on a busy intersection to give to Arin as a kid."
