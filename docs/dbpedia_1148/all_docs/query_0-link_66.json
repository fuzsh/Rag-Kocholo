        "text": "Previous threads:\n\nThis thread is for clearance-- not for sale items. Price reductions for clearance seem to happen on Monday, although not every Monday, but could also occur any day of the week depending on your store's price change team. Price adjustments on clearance are typically not allowed, but some have succeeded or have been able to do as return and rebuy.\n\nTarget often donates its older clearance titles to Goodwill stores, so keep that in mind when you're trying to find items. BigDirty: \"Further reduction is possible when a game's price ends with 8 cents. However, when it ends in 4 cents it will NOT drop anymore. If it ends in 9 cents, it's just on sale or on a non-clearance reduction.\" Also, note that, typically, games will drop three times-- from 30%, 50%, then to the final drop of 75% off of the original price. Some people, however, have seen further drops up to 85%.\n\nWhen games are marked down, the price change team typically find the game and scan it with their PDA/LRT to intiate the price change. However, in the case that they cannot find the game, they will either choose to not drop the price further or process the price change anyway, figuring that the game is somewhere in the store.\n\nWhen posting deals, please include game, system, price, city and state. For example:\n\nDebbie Does Skywalker, Xbox 360, $4.98\n\nMesa, AZ Power Road at Superstition Springs\n\nAlso, a great help when you're posting deals you've found is to check this post and see if your item's DPCI number is already listed. DPCI stands for Department, Class, Item-- it's Target's version of a SKU. These are a nine digit number that can always be found on your receipt and also on the red clearance tags on the item itself. DPCI numbers are handy to have when you want to check the item's price-- just go over to your scanner and punch in the numbers, if your scanners have keypads. Also, you can give these numbers to team members so they can check the availability of the item easily with their PDA scanners. Please post any DPCI numbers that are not already in the OP-- thanks!\n\nHere is a fairly easy way to check your local Target's pricing-- often price tags will not be correct. Thanks to BigDirty for this:\n\n1) Go to Half.com or a similar site. Search for the game to locate its UPC code number. It's in the gray box underneath the box art graphic.\n\n2) Go to UPC Data ,Milk.com , or UPC Database and enter the code so you can print out the UPC. Go to Target and use the price scanners to scan your printouts.\n\nThanks to Mephitical for this tool for locating clearance titles, which is located here. Go to Amazon or Target to find the item's ASIN. When you find it, replace \"B000O3IS48\" in the URL with your item's ASIN. This will take you to a page asking you for your zip code. Type in your zip code and click enter-- this will display a list of local stores and whether or not they have your item in stock. YMMV on it working properly.\n\nThe lowest known price will be posted. The item could be higher or lower at your store. Numbers in yellow are DPCI numbers, which can be used to check the prices of items on newer scanners.\n\nWii\n\n7.48\n\n[207-26-0268] Nights: Journey of Dreams (added 04-12-09) (price updated: 05-05-09)\n\n9.98\n\n[207-26-0238]Facebreaker: KO Party (added 04-30-09)\n\nGuiness Book of World Records (added 04-30-09)\n\n[207-26-0290]Imagine: Party Babiez (added 02-12-09) (price updated: 03-15-09)\n\nLooney Tunes: Acme Arsenal (added 04-14-09)\n\n[207-26-0145] Major League Baseball 2K8 (added 01-19-09) (price updated: 03-15-09)\n\n[207-26-0309] Monkey Mischief Party Time (added 01-23-09) (price updated: 03-15-09)\n\n10.48\n\n[207-26-0328] Elebits (added 04-12-09)\n\n13.98\n\n[207-26-0076] Backyard Baseball '09 (added 04-13-09)\n\n[207-26-0130] Dragonball Z Tenkaichi 3 (added 04-13-09)\n\nGuitar Hero: Aerosmith [game only] (added 04-14-09)\n\n[207-26-0289] Movie Games (added 04-20-09)\n\n[207-26-0264] Petz Dogz 2 (added 04-13-09)\n\n[207-26-0209] Samba de Amigo (added 04-12-09) (price updated: 04-20-09)\n\n14.98\n\n[207-26-0138] Endless Ocean (added 04-14-09) (price updated: 05-05-09)\n\n19.98\n\n[207-26-0307] Block Party (added 04-15-09) (price updated: 05-05-09)\n\n20.98\n\n[207-26-0202] Dancing with the Stars: We Dance!
