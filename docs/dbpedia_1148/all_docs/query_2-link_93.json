A young gladiator in training named Rygar hears her cries for help, and rushes to her rescue.\n\nArmed with a legendary device called the Diskarmor, Rygar will explore the land of Argos, destroying enemies and powerful demons, while finding items and seeking information to aid him in his search for Princess Harmonia. Once Rygar has powered up his Diskarmor, it is up to him to stop Cleopatra and Aristotle, save the Princess and all of Argos from evil.",
