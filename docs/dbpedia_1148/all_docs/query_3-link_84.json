        "text": "Unison spreads itself too thin trying to satisfy all of these criteria, and ultimately comes up short everywhere.\n\nAs Brad says, Rygar: The Legendary Adventure borrows heavily–and in some cases, outright plagiarizes-from the structure and aesthetic of Devil May Cry (DMC). The static camera angles, the save system, and even the fonts are nearly identical to DMC.\n\nIf the game were truly about volleyball, or even about forming relationships, then there would not be random screens of the girls walking up and down beaches or lying down in poses that make them appear, as a friend so aptly put it, \"freshly raped.\"\n\nSex is something of an enigma for this country. Everyone wants it, everyone thinks about it, but almost nobody wants to deal with it in a meaningful and intelligent way. This is especially true for videogames and their delayed acceptance as culturally valid media.\n\nAccording to the ESRB, this game contains: Blood and Gore, ViolenceParents don't have much to worry about with either title. Dual Hearts is completely harmless, and although Rygar does have some blood spurts when killing bugs or monstrous enemies, it's nothing that hasn't been done in a thousand other games […]\n\n2002 was a year of big-name games and even bigger hype. Some was deserved, some wasn't, but it was hard to avoid being bombarded by the media for those certain titles that shall go unpromoted in this review. Besides the discs that \"everyone\" was buying, there were a significant number of smaller efforts with gameplay as good (sometimes even better) than the so-called blockbusters.\n\nFatal Frame is a scary and original horror experience. While not a great game, it does deliver on its promise to explore the survival-horror genre from a fresh perspective.\n\nIt pains me dearly to score a Tecmo game so low, but in all good conscience I just cant let them slide. Theyve always been known for extremely fun, solid and original games despite (generally) not having cutting edge graphics. Breaking with that tradition in Fatal Frames case, the graphics arent that bad but they seem to have gone astray when it came to the gameplay department. Very, very disappointing.\n\nI'll admit that I'm not much of a fan of fighting games on consoles. I usually spent my time playing the Street Fighters and Tekkens in arcades because I believe the experience of a fighting game is much more exciting when you're actually playing against a human opponent. Considering that most of the people I hang around don't really care for video games, it's been hard for me to ever have a good experience with a fighting game at home. I always end up convinced that the computer cheats and is out to get me (which aggravates me to no end)."
