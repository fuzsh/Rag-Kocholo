        "text": "Each has different range, elemental attributes, and special attacks. Besides the combos, there's the fact that you can get three of the yo-yo like weapons. The weapon you're using is probably the best part of this game, and what makes Rygar: The Legendary Adventure somehow feel fresh even while it's a copycat of sorts. Or you can be lazy and just circle your foes, sniping at them. The controls make this possible and in theory, you can rack up combos of 100 hits. If you're surrounded by slugs, it's fun to grab one, swing it around, turn to another group, and keep moving. Simply mashing the square button will work, but if you want to do some good specials, you'll need to time your mashes and compliment the furious button pounding with some logic.\n\nThis is important because you're going to want to string together attacks. The 'x' button jumps and the rest of the four face buttons perform variations of your basic attack. As you move through, you're quickly given a run-down of the controls. The enemies aren't quite puppets, though they're spiky slugs. When you begin playing, you're in a dungeon that looks like it came right out of Devil May Cry. From elements of the story, to the general way in which the levels unfold, to the controls and the way enemies appear, this is obviously inspired by Capcom's offering. The influence is obvious the moment you begin playing and it doesn't end until the closing credits. Instead, they allowed themselves to be more heavily influenced by another great title from recent years, Devil May Cry. Tecmo easily could have made this a 2D piece similar to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. The first of those trimmings is the full 3D. Not only that, but they've managed to give us a good backstory and they've updated the series with all the trimmings you'd expect from a Playstation 2 title. Thankfully, Tecmo has kept things true to the game's roots. It was an exhilerating title, one of the best the NES saw. Sometimes the view switched and he was viewed from overhead as he crossed over rivers and so forth. And for the most part, the company has succeeded.Ä«ack in the day, Rygar was a game about a guy in a red suit who ran around with what looked like a spike-tipped yo-yo, thrashing out at turtles and other enemies while dashing about the mountains. Tecmo, now known more for its fighting games than its action games (at one point, it was one of the kings in the genre) has chosen to revive Rygar. Then he inexplicably disappeared, all but lost to memory. The last time most of you will remember seeing him, he was enjoying the glory of the 8-bit golden age. If you were trying to stick Rygar: The Legendary Adventure into one of those two categories, it would definitely fall into the latter.\n\nThere are two kinds of franchises: those that see a release every year or every other year, and those that see releases every 5 or 10 years. With generally impressive visuals and a terrific sense of atmosphere, it seldom goes wrong.\" \"Without a doubt, Rygar: The Legendary Adventure is a perfectly acceptable follow-up to its excellent predecessor, and a good title in its own right (particularly if you liked Devil May Cry and the sequel's release in 2003 seems too far away).
