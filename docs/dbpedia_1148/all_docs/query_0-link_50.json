Stay fresh!\n\nJeez, sounds like you have a huge amount of games. Welcome to the world of blogging!\n\nThanks Siver and Skyhler!\n\nYes, I've got quite a collection, haha. It started out (the NES side of things) as \"get everything notable,\" and that slowly morphed into \"get the rare stuff, too!,\" and that turned into \"well, you haven't really seen this? Sure, buy it.\" I remember when I had about 100 NES cartridges, I have no idea how I sprung all the way up to 350. But yes, I have basically \"everything notable\" at this point, and I'm really only missing some of those really rare games that are worth playing. I'd love to have DuckTales 2 or Rescue Rangers 2 or Bubble Bobble 2; I remember renting them as a kid but haven't ever seen them in the wild. I've bought a few rare ones though, like Fire n Ice. $15 at Game Craze. Worth far more, if you put a lot of stock in Pricecharting and the like. I've got a pretty extensive SNES collection, too. LOVE Ogre Battle, which that series got the recognition it deserves, and I proudly own a complete Chrono Trigger that I bought from a high school friend for $20. I remember my mom drove me over there to make the purchase, and I basically RAN back to the car because I was so excited to finally have it in my hand. This was like 1998, so it wasn't rare as heck yet, but man. What a feeling. Thanks for chiming in, guys! I don't know if there is a \"follow\" thing on here or what the deal is, but I hope you're having a good time as I'm going to as well. (And I'll think about logging some of those old, untimed completions, too, Siver!)\n\n----------\n\nWizards & Warriors (NES)\n\nThis is my first \"game entry\" on this blog, and I did a mini-review of the game. The blog portion will serve as a sort of \"extras\" type deal that a DVD/Blu-Ray might have, much looser than a review, and maybe with some backstory. My first run-in with the series was actually Ironsword, my mom was able to pick me up a $10 copy at KB or something way the heck back when. I thought it was so funny that a videogame had a PHOTOGRAPH on the front, and not a cartoon type of thing like every other game. Fabio beefily adorns the cover of Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II, but just a drawing of Kuros is the cover art for Wizards & Warriors. I do like the series a bunch, and I own Wizards & Warriors III as well, but it hasn't ever got the shake it really needs. As a kid, I think that game is far too complicated to properly undertake, and such a departure from the other two games.\n\nWizards & Warriors though, yes, that's what we're talking about here! I think I had a Scholastic subscription to some books in school, and I seem to recall getting / reading a Wizards & Warriors book. I don't remember exactly what it was about, or how faithful it was to the story, but I always thought that was pretty cool. But THIS GAME, YES, I had put in there that I beat this way back when with my friend Steve. He had such different games than I did, and I always thought that was neat. I had games like SMB/DuckHunt, Donkey Kong Classics, Life Force, Anticipation, Mickey Mousecapade. Those are some that I know my parents bought for me. I had Sky Shark, too, and I sort of wondered \"how'd this get in here?,\" haha. Maybe dad picked that one out. Cool airplane fighter game! Steve had Ninja Gaiden, Tecmo Bowl, Wizards & Warriors, etc. So we played that. And beat it. He hadn't beat it before, but we hung in there for so long. I remember when we rescued Penelope (which we pronounced \"PEEN-a-lope\"), and finally when we got to that last battle in the caves. It is a tough battle reminiscent of Whack-a-Mole, at least the way I was doing it. Is there a better way? I'm not sure.\n\nI found out on this playthrough about the secondary weapons (tertiary weapons?). I got to him with the Cloak of Darkness (which was GARBAGE), but definitely had a very powerful magic wand-type instrument earlier in the game. I should've held onto that one. Of course, I realized too late what was really going on. All in all, I feel this is how most games of the NES era were, very \"pick up and play\" without needing to know too much about what was going on. I did a project on videogames while in college, comparing the entire forced story intake you have to sit through for Wind Waker, and the \"press start and go, game is done in 20 minutes\" that is Contra. You're tossed into the middle of a forest, and you're slashing at bees within 40 seconds. The way it should be.\n\nMusic in the game is great, and as mentioned before you can hear Vomitron's version of this game (alongside some other really awesome tunes) on their 2nd NES album, NEScessary Evil. Nothing gets you pumped up for your day like the sounds accompanying Kuros' running through the woods, looking for keys. Awesome!\n\nI gave the game a 7.7 on my personal ratings. Feels about right. Not a \"great\" game, but definitely fun to play, listen to, and the play control was solid enough. Some of the boss fights took a few attempts. Keeping score in the game is appropriate until you realize that it all gets wiped when you continue, and you're going to continue A LOT. I'd like to see how the best Wizards & Warriors player in the world does things. I know it isn't me, so I'd be happy to watch a true master and their craft!\n\nAs far as \"what game do I play next?\" goes, I started this a few years ago and have restarted now. Reading issue 1 of Nintendo Power 30 yea-- 33 years later, and seeing what kinds of games are coming out, and which games were most popular in July/August 1988 was pretty cool. Wizards & Warriors ranked 15th on their Top 30 (13th for Players, 5th for Pros, and didn't even make the Dealers list), contending with juggernauts Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Super Mario Bros., Kid Icarus, and Castlevania, and also hot movie tie-in Goonies II on the Adventure Series side of things. I wonder how things will look for them in the coming issues. Since this is the first time I've done an entry this month, I guess I can include the combined Top 30 here, in case you're curious (and also a little look at what I MAY be playing soon!):\n\nNintendo Power Top 30\n\n001 July/August 1988\n\n(Rank / Points / Title)\n\n01 214 Legend of Zelda\n\n02 198 Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!\n\n03 138 Metroid\n\n04 113 Super Mario Bros.\n\n05 079 Kid Icarus\n\n06 069 R.C. Pro-Am\n\n07 055 Ice Hockey\n\n08 048 Rad Racer\n\n09 039 Top Gun\n\n10 032 Double Dribble\n\n-----------------------\n\n11 031 Pro Wrestling\n\n12 026 Castlevania\n\n13 020 Goonies II\n\n14 020 Kung Fu\n\n15 017 Wizards & Warriors\n\n16 015 Rush' N Attack\n\n17 015 Mega Man\n\n18 014 Excitebike\n\n19 013 Ikari Warriors\n\n20 012 Spy Hunter\n\n21 011 Baseball\n\n22 011 Contra\n\n23 010 Ghosts' N Goblins\n\n24 009 Side Pocket\n\n25 008 Mario Bros.\n\n26 008 Renegade\n\n27 007 Section Z\n\n28 007 Gradius\n\n29 006 Ring King\n\n30 006 Rygar\n\nI have all of these on cartridge except for Side Pocket and Section Z. I've been looking locally, if I get through the other 28 games, I'll take to eBay. In addition to Nintendo Power, I have the precursor to the magazine with the Nintendo Fun Club, issues 4-7. When Little Mac says \"Join the Nintendo Fun Club!,\" it all makes sense now! I didn't know (until a few years ago) that there was something before Nintendo Power. These are fun reads, too. Whereas Nintendo Power was all about awesome maps and tips, Nintendo Fun Club is CHOCK full of awesome 80's ads, HAHA. There is a relevance here; Acclaim had an ad for Wizards & Warriors on page 19 of issue 4 (Tyson on the cover!) where the game is described as \"THE ULTIMATE FANTASY ADVENTURE\" and also \"THE BATTLE OF LEGENDS.\" How could you not buy the game after this: \"You are Kurous the knight warriors. He is Malkil, the Supreme Wizard. Between you lie forests, catacombs, and the armies of the undead. Ahead...the battel of sword against sorcery.\" Holy smokes!\n\nA full-page ad reads:\n\nYou are Kuros, the knight warrior. Hero of the Books of Excallibur. Your journey begins deep within the woods of Elrond, where even the wind obeys the Supreme Wizard, Malkil. A wizard so great, Merlin calls him teacher. But Malkil has strayed from the path, and is now part of the dark side. Buried within the catacombs and dungeons of Elrond lies the key to your quest. The powers of levitation, the cloak of darkness, and the mysterious potions only Kuros can drink will be revealed to you. In caverns of fire, through demons that fly and crawl, against the soldiers of hte undead you must continue. No sorcery can prevail. For you are the only knight with the strength to wield the Brightsword. The prisoner of the wizard awaits. She calls to you from Castle IronSpire. But the wizard is watching you, warrior. And this tale has just begun.\n\nComing Soon: RAMBO\n\nSure, get 'em hooked on Wizards & Warriors, and then seal the deal with RAMBO. ALL CAPS. And I don't know how official all of this Excalibur and Merlin / Malkil stuff is. More research to follow here, will update!..\n\n(\"Louie Reviewee\" has a multi-page feature in issue 7 if you're interested.)\n\nI can't think of anything else. If you have specific questions about Wizards & Warriors, lay 'em on me. Up next: Rad Racer!\n\nHAHA!, alright, I'll think about it! It should be noted he didn't actually \"steal\" my name, but rather that I'd used it for years all over the place and now he's got it here. Thanks so much! :D\n\n-------\n\nRad Racer (NES)\n\nThis is not a game that I had purchased naturally for me as a kid, but rather an assortment of games that I was given by an older family friend (late teens, I think, maybe early 20's) back when I had originally got it. It was one of the more understated games; I paid far more attention to R.C. Pro-Am, Mario Bros., and my goodness, Super Mario Bros. 2, the game that I credit for getting me into Nintendo so hard. I just fawned over that game, looking so cool compared to the other Super Mario Bros. game. Loved it.\n\nBut yeah, Rad Racer. You can use 3-D glasses with it! Did you know that? Not a lot of games come equipped with that type of stuff. And I didn't really do this much as a kiddo either. I'm sure I tried it, but not enough to be like \"holy cow, they're in 3-D!\" 8 courses in this game, I probably saw about two when I was younger. I remember a series of three turns being IMPOSSIBLE when I was that age. Now that I'm packed with patience, predictive abilities, and finesse, I'm able to APPLY THE BRAKE slightly so I can finish those turns. Amazing. You'll race though multiple seaside locales, LA, SF, Greece, the Grand Canyon, and somewhere very snowy. Looks like Norway, or Switzerland. Through each of the tracks, you're accompanied by AI cars that look different. VW Bugs on the first stage, but later on you do battle against some pretty nasty Testarosas. I was never a car guy (though now I drive a pretty radical Mustang), but this was probably a pretty nice touch for gearheads and the like, identifying vehicles by their taillights and rear-end housings. Nice touch.\n\nThree stations to pick from on the radio, I went with Station #1 for this entire playthrough. I usually went with a more joyous, lighthearted one when I was originally playing this. I have fond memories doing this, and even called up my sister the other night after I beat this. \"What's that?\" She couldn't remember this game. I said \"don't you remember? You hit the signs and flip over? We built a car out of cushions on the floor and sat in it?\" I remembered.\n\nI don't think I've ever played Outrun, but when describing this game to other people recently I usually said \"like RoadBlasters -- WITHOUT guns.\" That seemed to do the trick, but not a very memorable game for the general populace, it seems? In any event, I, too, can forget about this one for a while. I drove the F1 a lot way back when, ran the sports car exclusively these attempts. I can come back for the racecar someday, but it won't be \"soon.\" At least I don't think so. I scored this a 6.0 / 60%. There's a whole lot more it can do better, but it isn't a \"terrible\" game. I'm wondering how Outrun compares directly, and how RoadBlasters will feel the next time I play that one. To be continued!\n\nUp next: Double Dribble!\n\nDouble Dribble (NES)\n\nDouble Dribble isn't a game that I remember playing too much as a kid, but definitely remember hearing about it, and it's signature \"squeaks\" of the shoes. The dunk animations were pretty funny/legendary, too, but not much beyond that. For sports games, I gravitated much more towards Tecmo Bowl, Blades of Steel, and Bases Loaded. Basketball ranks 4th for me of the Big 4 sports in the US, and similarly this game ranks well below the aforementioned three.\n\nThis time playing through I really struggled early on. I just missed a win in my first attempt (L1), tied in my 2nd game (they knotted it up in the closing seconds, 86-86, 5 minute quarters), and the 3rd game I was obliterated by a 43 point margin (L3). I thought \"what the heck, I'm never going to win..\" Buoyed by the USA's collapse / France's victory in the Olympics the other day, I thought \"hey, if France can beat the US team in the Olympics, why in the world can't I beat Fake Larry Bird?\" Welp, turns out I can. (EDIT- And how about the Milwaukee Bucks winning the NBA Championship, too? My knowledge of basketball is tied to NBA Jame's initial lineup. I don't remember where exactly Milwaukee comes into play, but I know Dallas and Minnesota are the first two, and the Bucks probably aren't far off.) My 4th game went much better, and I got a little excited at halftime leading 79-38. Surely this is in the bag, yes? Nope, not really. I barely won 120-112, they were COMING in the last minute or so. Being a player outside of a videogame, I don't have the ability like the in-game CPU coach to talk to my players to make adjustments. Each and every game the 2nd Half has gone differently for me. I don't know if Boston is historically a 2nd Half team, but my goodness, it was like fighting a steamroller in the 3rd and 4th Quarters each of those games. With a win in the bag, I called it \"beat,\" and proceeded to write my entry here. The next day I was feeling kind of weird about it, not taking the Level 3 challenge (my Win came on L2). I never set out to 100% it or anything, but it still felt \"off\" for me. So before I changed games, I took one more run at it, and was able to topple Boston, again, this time on the top level. I don't feel like I was too strict on the scoring of this game (5.4 / 50%), but I do think that there is a pretty steep learning curve between \"having fun with your friends\" and \"realistically competing against impossible computer\" sometimes. I found my strategy improving a bit, but yeah, it was tough. I think that is a factor in old games that goes ignored. You can really pick up Contra or Mega Man 2 and COMPETE, HARD, but games like this (or Kid Icarus, UGH), it is so steep to become someone who has a crack. At least in my experiences.\n\nThat next game up is Rygar. I hadn't played much of it ever, partially because I got it so late in my collection, and partially because the power has only been on one time without it glitching out. When I was just about to throw in the towel on getting it to work, I saw a slew of pixels and seconds later I had it working properly. Let there be life! I poked around a little in there, and found that...Rygar isn't ONLY side-scrolling?! Top-down in the 3rd area, whaaat? Very interesting. That'll be my next project on here, unsure exactly when I'm going to get to it though as I'll be attempting WITHOUT a walkthrough, at least initially, and time is short this week. Gotta do it all in one sitting, too. Where are the passwords?!\n\nI've already had a pretty good time writing on here, and getting back into these old games. I like this \"project\" that I'm doing as it breathes life into games I might never give a fair shake by sheer virtue of \"you've got way too many great games,\" ya know? I can tell you before last week I had NEVER given Double Dribble priority over ANYTHING, haha. And Rygar, I've talked about it more the last two days to people than I ever have prior. Cool beans. That game ranked 30th in Nintendo Power's Top 30 in Issue 1; word is that it is an underrated / underappreciated game, and I can already tell that is the case. A lot of games (EARTHBOUND) come with insurmountable hype and don't measure up to the new player (again, in my experience; I'd take at least 15 NES/SNES RPGs before Earthbound, easy). Pretty cool to tangle with a game that is better than you knew.\n\nUp next: Rygar\n\nRygar (NES)\n\nLike a lot of games that I'll be playing through here, Rygar isn't a game that I even knew of as a kid. It first came across my desk much later in life, possibly even after I had completed college. I don't remember exactly when I got it, and didn't get a whole lot of play in it even when I did. Around the time that I acquired it, I was picking up some \"rare\" stuff that I didn't see to often, and most of the time I'd just throw it in for a few minutes to make sure it worked. As told in the review, I wasn't even aware that this game had an Adventure aspect to it, thinking it a pure Action game like Castlevania. Wrong.\n\nThe game was a bit frustrating at times, but overall enjoyable. The music was really good stuff, with the exception of Dorago's Castle, I think, which was the same four notes over and over again. The fact that I can't remember it right now seems like I've successfully blocked it out after thinking \"boy, this is really bad music.\" Yuck. Good stuff everywhere else though. I got some Kid Icarus vibes throughout, mainly because of the little \"rest\" rooms with the Indora and the ability to heal sometimes, but also how the game starts out being SO difficult but you kinda breeze through it at the end. I'll get to Kid Icarus in its own right here, but that is another game that I couldn't clear the first level on for quite some time. Once I started rolling on Rygar, and remembering where to go as I logged some steps back and forth, the world \"got smaller\" and far less daunting. Similarly, I don't remember exactly how I felt with the original Zelda when I first set out, but seeing that map must've felt HORRIBLE. But once you're zipping around, taking shortcuts, whistle warping, and pushing rocks, you're gold.\n\nI had mixed feelings about the boss fights. They seemed..pretty easy for the most part, but after struggling through a tough section, do I want my head torn off by a boss? Ehhh.. Many of them fought the same, which I guess is what draws similarities between them, sorta like the bosses in Adventure Island all do the same thing, and how you fight Bowser 8 times in Super Mario Bros. Sometimes he has hammers, but most of the time he's just the same guy doing the same things. That doesn't get knocked, should these bosses?\n\nI wanted to get back to some familiarity and breeze through a game I've trounced in the past, but made the mistake of throwing Gradius in there. Why would I do that? This is a game I've struggled with before (despite being critically adept in the realm of Life Force), and I had some pretty good runs. No win to report yet, but hopefully soon.\n\nPutting a button on Rygar, I very much enjoyed the product they put out for the most part. Repetitive enemies often, but the music, play control, and graphics (especially the backgrounds) bring the score up. It felt like an 8.3 the whole time I was playing, which is a pretty good score. I think of Chrono Trigger as \"gaming perfection,\" and even that only yanks a 9.8 on my scale. 8.3 is a darn good score, and Rygar should feel proud. If it could feel. Never got a chance to play any of the recent installments, might spring for them if they hit Nintendo some day (similar to how Bayonetta released on the Wii U after Bayonetta 2 was announced). I thought a few times \"I wish this game rewarded exploration more,\" curious if they more recent games did that. Super stoked that I was able to get through the game quicker than the average here, too. I was budgeting for about 5 hours, part of the reason I got so backed up with this thing. Had I known I could've definitively dropped it in under 2 hours, I would've put it to bed some night..before bed. But that is why we report times, yeah?\n\nUntil next time - stay fresh!\n\nUp next: Gradius?\n\nIt sickens me to tell you that I haven't yet beat Gradius. I threw it in on a whim, feeling the excitement of burying Rygar, and not nearly ready for the level of difficulty AND the fact that I can't get the continue code to work for me. What the heck! Part of me thought \"I should just play this on the Switch with save states,\" but my goodness, doesn't that defeat the purpose of all of this? Yes. Yes it does.\n\nSo that has been an all-too-effective roadblock this month. I wanted to get that game knocked off, and then breeze through Side Pocket and Sector Z, my two newest games. After clearing those, I was going to cruise through Super Mario Bros. (two times) before ripping Super Mario Bros. 2 out of the ground, and chucking it like a huge turnip. I've beaten those two games before, many times, but was going to do it again for this.\n\nTonight marks the end of the July/August run for Nintendo Power, and I'll be moving onto a new focal point the next time I play. I don't know if I'll be able to pry myself away from Gradius (If you're unfamiliar, in this day and age, once you get a Nintendo cartridge working that is finicky, players like me DO NOT want to remove it for fear that it may never slide into that Absolute Zone again and work properly. It is a BATTLE sometimes.) and move onto something else, or if I'll tough it out a few more times. I'm at the point of asking for some tips on it if anyone has any. I made it to the stage with a conveyor door that closes the corridor off (without dying to that point), but haven't been beyond it. One chief complaint I have with Gradius is that when you die...you're like DONE. Chances are you died in a heavy area, and once you come back, you're at the same spot..now with pockets completely empty. If you died while fully souped up, how the heck are you going to dig your way out without even being FAST enough to dodge things? It is -- at times -- downright unfair.\n\nOk, back to Issue 1. I think it is a beaut. I love that cover, so iconic. I remember just seeing one in person years and years ago and just thinking \"WOW;\" my natural collection (hand me downs) started at Issue 4, I think, so I was used to some early stuff, but not the very first installment. Pretty cool. It comes with an awesome pull out of Zelda's 2nd Quest and locations for some items and dungeons which would've been hella rad back when I was a kid. I beat the 2nd Quest as an adult a few years ago for the first time, something I'll try to do again in the coming months.\n\nI guess that's it for now. I'll get some talkage about Issue 2 soon enough. Stay fresh, my dudes, and keep pluggin' away (I will!).\n\nI am NOT having a good time with Gradius. I don't give up on games, but I think I may need to table this one for a bit. I'll be back someday, but it has put me at a standstill for about a month. Which is ridiculous. I wanted to be dusting a game a night, or five a week, or something. Struggling with a harder than nail SHMUP is in no way conducive to making significant progress and contributing to the How Long To Beat database. So I'll pull the plug on that one. Again, not viving up -- I shall return.\n\nOnto Issue 2 of Nintendo Power, and we're almost halfway through the newsstand run. Barf!\n\nWhat a menacing cover! This is, of course, Castlevania II: Simon's Quest. A far ways from the whimsical clay sculpted Super Mario Bros. 2 just one issue before. Simon Belmont, clutching the decapitated head of Dracula, accompanied by his heart, and eyeball, and so forth. I'll pencil in Castlevania and Simon's Quest for the end of October; solid Halloween fodder! (I also try to complete a Survival run ZombiU every October since it's release. Hasn't happened yet..)\n\nNintendo Power Top 30\n\n002 September/October 1988\n\n(Rank / Points / Title)\n\nNC 01 2090 Legend of Zelda\n\nNC 02 1807 Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!\n\nNC 03 1139 Metroid\n\nNC 04 1139 Super Mario Bros.\n\nNC 05 0986 Kid Icarus\n\n---- 06 0732 Double Dragon *NEW*\n\nNC 07 0686 Ice Hockey\n\n-02 08 0611 R.C.

Expect both Zelda II and Mario 2 to climb this list. \"Editor's Note: You'll start seeing Zelda II in stores in December!\" It made the Top 30 without even being RELEASED, haha. Other games that are new (besides Double Dragon), not sure how much staying power Rambo, Kid Niki, Zanac, and Pinball have. We'll have to wait and see.\n\nFell Out:\n\n16 015 Rush' N Attack\n\n20 012 Spy Hunter\n\n23 010 Ghosts' N Goblins\n\n24 009 Side Pocket\n\n25 008 Mario Bros.\n\n27 007 Section Z\n\n28 007 Gradius\n\n29 006 Ring King\n\nWe've got a Capcom run 'n shoot, the classic shooting game, impossibly difficult Ghosts 'n Goblins, a pool game, arcade Mario, Section Z (which I WILL get to this month), F'n Gradius, and a non-Tyson boxing game. Spy Hunter and GnG sort of surprise me, I'd expect those to be around a bit, but it is sort of a schmozz towards the bottom of these standings where any game could've snuck in there with one more vote. You can see the numbers are much higher though, directly connected to subscribers and membership totals? Nintendo Power, gaining speed!\n\nSO, this month, I'm gonna try to knock off both Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 2, and the Castlevania pair in October. I'll sprinkle some other stuff around it, maybe snake one of these \"Fell Out\" games, too, unsure if and when they'll ever return. The NES was pretty rockin', the Top 30 will be hotly contested very soon! I just tried Gradius again before posting this, left dejected and disgusted, and hopefully I'll have some new for you next time, dear reader.\n\nEnjoy the night, stay safe out there!"
