        "text": "Celebrity relationships often unfold like a drama, with plot twists, denials, and cryptic social media posts serving as the script. The recent spotlight falls on the relationship involving South Korean actor Ryu Jun Yeol, whose journey from the end of one relationship to the beginning of another has sparked controversy. It all began with rumours in March as speculations swirled online about Ryu and actress Han So Hee's escapade in Hawaii. Despite initial denials from Han’s agency, the rumours grew louder when Ryu’s presence in Hawaii was confirmed, albeit without comment on the swirling rumours. The timing was impeccable, as it coincided with murmurs of Ryu’s breakup with long-time girlfriend, Girl’s Day’s Hyeri.\n\nHan So Hee and Ryu Jun Yeol vacation in Hawaii in leaked photos amid relationship drama involving Hyeri; Han’s agency to take action against malicious rumours\n\nNow, Dispatch, a tabloid in South Korea, shared a series of photos on March 18 from Ryu and Han’s Hawaii trip. They were together on most occasions and joined by a friend.\n\nAccording to the Korean tabloid Soompi, the timeline became murkier as news of his split with Hyeri surfaced back in November 2023, Han So Hee found herself embroiled in the narrative as she had attended Ryu's photo exhibition around the same time, raising eyebrows. A report from Dispatch revealed Ryu Jun Yeol and Hyeri had grown distant, dating back to June of the previous year. The absence of Ryu Jun Yeol at Hyeri's birthday celebration served as a marker of this growing rift. However, their break up was officially announced in November 2023.\n\nThe rumours deepened as social media became the battleground for subtle jabs and veiled messages. In between March 15-17, Hyeri's cryptic Instagram post, featuring a scenic vacation spot accompanied by the caption, “This is funny.” Han So Hee's subsequent post, featuring a dog holding a knife, added fuel to the fire. She wrote in Korean, as translated by Soompi, “Explain this situation… I don’t like people who have a significant other. I don’t lead them on while saying we’re just friends, I don’t take an interest in them, I don’t develop a relationship with them, and I don’t get in the way of other people’s relationships. I like the program ‘EXchange,’ but there’s nothing like that in my life.” In an apparent response to Hyeri’s post, she added, “I also find this funny.”\n\nHowever, amidst the drama, Han So Hee stepped forward to address the rumours head-on. In a lengthy statement on her blog, she confirmed her relationship with Ryu Jun Yeol but asserted that it had not overlapped with his previous romance with Hyeri. She expressed regret for her earlier Instagram post and acknowledged her lapse in judgment. “I find myself looking back on whether, because I’m living a life that focuses on the results rather than the process, I’ve lost the moment of that process. The reason you like me is probably not just a few photos or videos. So if my attitude seems conceited or arrogant, even though I don’t think it is, if it seems that way to you, then I probably already have those bad feelings to some extent. I think the time has come for me to acknowledge it and return to my original place, to find what it is that I truly wanted to do, what it is I liked, what made me happy. I don’t know if I became a mess of a person because I took my first break in two years, but like I said before, please reproach me a lot,” a part of her blog post read.\n\nOn March 16, after Han's blog post, Ryu's agency C-JeS Studios responded with the following statement which read, \"Starting with the Hawaii sighting account from yesterday, there have been many articles speculating about Ryu Jun Yeol’s personal life, so we would like to inform you of the truth. Ryu Jun Yeol and Han So Hee confirmed their positive feelings for one another and have been dating since the beginning of this year. Ryu Jun Yeol got to know Han So Hee after his breakup, and they recently confirmed their feelings [for each other]. Instead of an official confirmation of the sighting account at the vacation resort and the photos that were taken without permission [by the person who posted the account], we asked that people respect [Ryu Jun Yeol’s] privacy. But because we did not confirm their relationship, unnecessary misunderstandings and groundless speculation have been swirling both yesterday and today, and actor [Ryu Jun Yeol]’s rights are being severely violated, so we entreat you once again. In the future as well, in order to protect our actor’s basic rights, we will continue to not release a statement in response to each and every request to clarify and prove the details of his personal life. We ask for your understanding. Additionally, regarding malicious slander and insulting posts about our actor, we will be taking strong action through a legal representative in response to falsehoods, defamation of character, insults, and the violation of [his] rights.\"\n\nOn March 18, Han’s agency 9ato Entertainment released a statement stating that they will take action against malicious rumours being spread on social media. The statement read, “Han So Hee feels gratitude for the public’s attention that comes with her job as an actress, and she has worked to give back for the love and support of many people. However, being a human before being an actress, she is experiencing a very difficult time emotionally due to speculative posts and malicious comments that are being written indiscriminately. In relation to this, we will take strong action against those who write or circulate any malicious content that damages the reputation of our artist, regardless of the degree of its severity. Our company and the actress deeply reflect on the troubles caused to many people during the process of announcing her relationship. We will closely watch over our actress to ensure that she can move in the right direction and will put in our full effort to protect our artist.”\n\nMeanwhile, after much controversy, Hyeri on March 20 shared a statement on her Instagram, which she will delete soon. She said, \"First, I sincerely apologize for the speculations and controversies that arose over the past few days due to my personal emotions. I think I failed to consider the ripple effects that each of my minor actions could have. I sincerely apologize to anyone who was harmed because of me. Last November, the news was released that my eight-year relationship came to an end. It was not a decision made in a short period of time, and even after the breakup news came out, we had a conversation about talking more [about our situation]. However, we have not had any contact or met since that conversation. And four months later, I think my emotions after coming across a new article were perceived not as actress Lee Hyeri but as just Lee Hyeri. I apologize once again for causing harm with my impulsive emotions. Over the past few days, I didn’t explain the reason for my actions because I thought that our conversations were overly personal, and it would only increase fatigue [to the public]. If this caused confusion for anyone, I am also sorry for that. Moving forward, I will be more careful with my words and actions.\"\n\nALSO READ: Gyeongseong Creature Part 2 Ending Explained: Deaths, Time Travel & Lookalikes – Park Seo Joon and Han So Hee starrer season 1 ends with wildest cliffhanger\n\nBOLLYWOOD NEWS - LIVE UPDATES"
