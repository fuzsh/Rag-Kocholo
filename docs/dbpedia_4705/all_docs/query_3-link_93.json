        "text": "A recent article published by the Korean outlet TV Report compared AOA's Seolhyun and Girl's Day member Hyeri to Suzy. In the article titled, \"Suzy, Seolhyun, Hyeri, new girl group troika?,\" TV Report drew comparisons between the three acting idols.\n\nThe report cited that the three K-pop stars are within the same age bracket. Born in 1995, Seolhyun would be considered younger by international standards, but her January birthdate places were within the range of Suzy and Hyeri, who were born in 1994.\n\nWhile their age and profession may have similarities, each star has a unique style of acting. Suzy debuted with Miss A in July 2010. She experienced explosive popularity following the success of the 2011 teen musical drama, \"Dream High.\" Suzy segued from \"Dream High\" to star with Gong Yoo and Lee Min Jung in the Hong Sisters' series, \"Big.\" Her role in \"Big\" led to a Popularity Award at the KBS Drama Awards, setting the stage for her transition into two of her most iconic roles.\n\nSuzy earned her nickname as Korea's First Love, with her portrayal of the younger version of Yang Seo Yeon in the melodramatic film, \"Architecture 101.\" She followed the success of the film with her starring role as Dam Yeo Wool in the supernatural period drama, \"Gu Family Book.\"\n\nThe Miss A member will return to television in 2016 in a drama that has been tentatively called \"Carelessly Affectionate,\" which also stars Kim Woo Bin.\n\nHyeri debuted with Girl's Day in September 2010, following the departure of Jisun and Jiin. Her first acting role was a cameo appearance in the 2011 series, \"I Trusted Him.\" She experienced her official acting debut with her supporting role in the 2012 drama, \"Tasty Life.\"\n\nAfter several cameos, she landed her first starring role in the 2014 teen drama, \"Seonam Girls High School Investigators.\" She followed with a supporting role in the SBS series, \"Jekyll, Hyde and I.\" Hyeri has limited acting experience but is the focus of increased attention due to starring role in tvN's \"Reply 1988.\"\n\nSeolhyun may have less acting experience than Hyeri, but she has appeared in several high-profile roles. She debuted with AOA in 2012 and was cast in a supporting role for the KBS2 series \"My Daughter Seo Young,\" within the same year. She followed with her portrayal of Gong Na Ri in SBS' \"Ugly Alert.\" However, she received increased attention from domestic and international viewers with her role in the Lee Min Ho film, \"Gangnam 1970.\"\n\nSeolhyun recently starred in the KBS2 series, \"Orange Marmalade,\" which was based on the popular webtoon.\n\nSuzy, Hyeri and Seolhyun are all talented acting idols, but Suzy has accumulated the most experience. It could be too early to predict whether Hyeri or Seolhyun have the potential to become Korea's sweethearts or if they will take a different path."
