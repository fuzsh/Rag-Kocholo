        "text": "Industry insiders have spoken up to clarify rumors that stars Hyeri, Ryu Joon Yeol, and Han So Hee were involved in a \"transit relationship\".\n\nPreviously, Hyeri wrote that she \"had initially agreed to talk things out with Ryu Joon Yeol after the breakup reports in November [of 2023], but in the end, [they] did not meet or contact each other after that agreement.\"\n\nWhen dating reports between Ryu Joon Yeol and Han So Hee broke out last week, some netizens speculated that Ryu Joon Yeol had not ended things clearly with Hyeri before getting into a new relationship with Han So Hee, partly because of Hyeri's words that they had decided to try and \"talk things out\".\n\nHowever, according to industry insiders, Hyeri's comment that she and Ryu Joon Yeol would \"talk things out\" was in fact simply a formality, rather than any sign that the two stars had lingering feelings about their relationship.\n\nNews reports on March 21 KST claimed that Hyeri and Ryu Joon Yeol had decided to take a \"break\" from their relationship in February of 2023, when Hyeri was busy working on her film 'Victory'. The \"break\" was more or less code for a \"break up\", and by June, the secret was out of the bag when Ryu Joon Yeol did not make an appearance on Hyeri's birthday.\n\nBy July~August, media reporters began contacting Hyeri and Ryu Joon Yeol's sides to confirm rumors of their breakup. However, the two sides delayed giving a clear response. One insider commented, \"You see that with relationships that lasted a long time. It's difficult for them to be clear about the concluding point.\"\n\nFurthermore, an insider added on, \"They only met each other in-person once all of last year. They were already more or less broken up. Hyeri must have known that those words, 'let's try to talk it out,' were more of a formality than anything else. To say that it was a 'transit relationship' would be quite a stretch.\""
