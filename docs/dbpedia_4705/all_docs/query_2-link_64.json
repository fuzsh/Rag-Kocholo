        "text": "Actor Lee Hye-ri will return to the drama with \"competition in good faith.\"\n\nOn the 17th, the drama \"Goodwill Competition\" (played by Kim Tae-hee, Min Ye-ji, director Kim Tae-hee) delivered the news of Lee Hye-ri's casting along with the confirmation of the production through a press release.\n\nBased on the popular webtoon of the same name, \"Goodwill Competition\" is a high-teen mystery thriller about a close relationship between teenage girls in a harsher survival competition than the entrance exam. It depicts the story of \"Wooseulgi\" from a local nursery school, which does not fit the place, when he transferred to Chaehwa Girls' High School, where the top 1% of Korean students gathered. Covering the lives of competitive teenage girls without filtering, it is expected to be the top-rated talk of the year 2025.\n\nIn the play, Lee Hye-ri played the role of Chaehwa Girls' High School's only powerful man, Yoo J. Yu-J is a genius high school girl who occupies the top 0.1% in Chaehwa Girls' High School, where the top 1% gather, and is a truly fraudulent character with a natural appearance, high IQ, and a good family.\n\nYu-Jay, who has lived in everyone's envy since birth, knows his superiority well and is also a person with the spirituality of using it. He will show special interest in Woo Seul-ki, a transfer student, and will develop a close relationship between friendship and obsession.\n\nThrough this, Lee Hye-ri will return to the drama about three years after the 2022 drama Ildang Baekjipsa. Lee Hye-ri, who has mainly played bold and courageous characters in dramas such as \"Think of the Moon When Flowers Bloom,\" \"Lost Cohabitation,\" \"Cheongil Electronics Mitsuri,\" \"Two Cops,\" \"Reply 1988,\" and the movie \"Pansori Boxer,\" is expected to transform into a dutiful character \"Yu-J,\" who has hidden his insides in a perfect appearance in this \"good faith competition.\"\n\nMeanwhile, 'good faith competition' is scheduled to be released in 2025.\n\n[Reporter Park Rosa's \"Star Today\"]"
