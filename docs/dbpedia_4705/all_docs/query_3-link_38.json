        "text": "Actor Ryu Jun-yeol (37) and Han So-hee (29) were spotted on a date in Hawaii.\n\nDispatch flew to Hawaii and captured the scene of their date on camera, the day after they admitted to dating.\n\nDispatch said on the 18th, \"It wasn't what we expected,\" adding, \"Han So-hee looked at the public's eyes while looking at her cell phone, and Ryu Jun-yeol looked at Han So-hee without saying anything.\" \"It didn't look fun at all,\" he said.\n\nIn the photo released together, Ryu Jun-yeol and Han So-hee looked stiff and walked apart. They ate together at the same table, but they didn't look at each other affectionately. In particular, Han So-hee looked at her cell phone the whole time.\n\nRyu Jun-yeol and Hye-ri officially announced their separation in November last year, but their relationship has reportedly been estranged since June.\n\n\"The two do not share their love history,\" Dispatch said, citing interviews with her closest aide. But I feel it. I've been in touch with them all the time. The time to look at the phone gradually decreased, and Ryu Jun-yeol did not come to Hyeri's birthday party. Everyone detected an abnormal airflow,\" he said. Han So-hee added that she went to Ryu Jun-yeol's solo exhibition on Nov. 15 and greeted him for the first time, and has since developed into a lover.\n\nRumors of a romantic relationship between the two began on social media when witnesses spread that the two spent time together in a hotel swimming pool in Hawaii. At that time, Ryu Jun-yeol and Han So-hee's agency were in Hawaii, but they did not clearly state their position on the romance rumors, saying it was \"private life.\"\n\nHowever, Ryu Jun-yeol's ex-lover, singer-actor Hye-ri (Lee Hye-ri), posted a message on social media saying, \"It's fun.\" Harry was a representative long-lived couple who dated Ryu Jun-yeol for seven years.\n\nHan So-hee, a head-to-head breakthrough, posted a long message on the 16th and honestly admitted to dating. However, he strongly denied the allegations of 'transshipment relationship'. \"I heard that the time when we exchanged our hearts (with Ryu Jun-yeol) was already the beginning of 2024, and the breakup with him (Hye-ri) was concluded in early 2023, and the breakup article came out in November,\" he wrote. \"Based on this fact, I confirmed my feelings and continued the relationship.\"\n\nRegarding the 'Jeogeolgeol' directed at Hye-ri, he also said, \"It was pathetic and pathetic. I will apologize to him, and I sincerely apologize to you for not dealing with it wisely,\" he added.\n\nOn the same day, Ryu Jun-yeol also said through his agency C-Jess Studio, \"Ryu Jun-yeol has been meeting with Han So-hee since the beginning of this year after confirming his good heart. Ryu Jun-yeol said he got to know Han So-hee after the breakup and recently confirmed his feelings.\n\nHowever, their love does not seem to receive congratulations and support from the beginning. On the 17th, Ryu Jun-yeol entered the country alone through Incheon International Airport. It was not even a \"sinner,\" but it drew attention because it covered its face with glasses, hats, masks, and hoodies.\n\nOn this day, Han So-hee also blew up her blog and eventually Instagram. Rumor has it that 100,000 followers of Han So-hee's Instagram have left as suspicions of a \"transshipment relationship\" arose shortly after the romance rumors. On the other hand, Hyeri's followers increased by 300,000 from 822.8 million to 851.4 million.\n\nRyu Jun-yeol and Han So-hee are discussing starring in Han Jae-rim's new drama, \"Hidden City.\""
