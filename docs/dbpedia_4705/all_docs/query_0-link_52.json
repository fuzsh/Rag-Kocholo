        "text": "I always see discussion threads praising male actors, and it’s fine with me, but as women we should also praise and give support to our great actresses in k drama industry, that play a diversity of roles and rarely get complimented like they should be.\n\nMy favorite actress in order:\n\n#1\n\nHa Ji Won - Does her own stunts/ plays very serious roles/ Is funny when she has to be/ She’s #1 FOR ME bc I have seen from her, even the dramas that I disliked the male lead in, and the dramas where I disliked the character/role she was playing but I have to see it bc she’s that good.\n\n#2\n\nHwang Jeong Eum- Although she mainly plays kind of ‘‘comical’’ roles she has proven to be able to master serious roles. The only dramas I didn’t watched of her I blame her male lead in the drama. She’s my #2 favorite actress because when I can’t tolerate the ML or her role/character, I won’t watch.\n\n#3\n\nJUN JI HYUN - She’s amazing she has played the role of an assassin to perfection and she has played a role where she has been so funny, I laughed like a kid. Her romantic/kissing scenes are perfectly done. She has beauty and brains. She falls in third bc she waits too long to be on the k-drama scene.\n\n#4\n\nLee Min Jung- She was the one actress I first saw in K drama, and fell in love with korean dramas bc she played her role in [BIG] so exquisitely well. She has class, and she can also be funny and serious. She’s too perfect to be true. Wish she was more available in dramas. Getting married should not have stopped her from doing more dramas and that is why from being my #1 she went down to #4.\n\n#5 Suzy\n\nSuzy is one of the best young actress in K dramas and is sad that ppl don’t see her worth. I Watched her in BIG playing a spoiled brat role superb! In those singing drama (forgot titles) then I saw her in Family Gu Book? Amazing too although I hated the ending. Comes VAGABOND masterful and START UP need to say more. She’s very selective in her dramas but when she choose to be part of it she’s !00% there; professional, funny serious when she has to be and best of all makes most of her stunts unless they are too dangerous.\n\nI’ll begin with my favorites:"
