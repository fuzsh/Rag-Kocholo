Hyeri, along with Yura, joined the group in September 2010 after Jiin and Jisun left the group. She rose to fame after her appearance in the military variety show \"Real Men\" and the massive hit \"Reply 1988\" as Sung Doksun.\n\nFollowing Girl's Day's hiatus, Hyeri focused on acting in dramas and appearing in variety shows. She has since starred as the female lead in the dramas: \"Two Cops\", \"Miss Lee\", \"My Roommate is a Gumiho\", and \"Moonshine\".\n\nAfter her exclusive contract with Dream T Entertainment ended in 2019, Hyeri joined a newly set-up agency Creative Group ING."
