        "text": "Hyeri from Girl’s Day is currently the cream of the idol-turned-actress world. Not only did she hit it big with her role in Reply 1988, but she is slated for two more dramas in 2021: My Roommate is a Gumiho and When Flowers Bloom, I Think of the Moon.\n\nHyeri debuted in 2010 at 16 and by 2014 she’d done well enough, according to Koreaboo, that she could buy an apartment in Jamsil, Seoul for her family, as well as an imported luxury car for her dad.\n\nJung Eun-ji from Apink\n\nBest known simply as Eunji, she told fashion magazine Grazia about her family’s struggles with money. “I thought that once I have money, I would pay off the debt so that we could live without any worries. The time for it came unexpectedly and I gradually paid off the interest and then the principal.”\n\nShe took her mother on a trip back to where she had had her honeymoon on Jeju Island and made her a meal: “I set up a table for my mother and pushed the bankbook towards her and she cried. We embraced each other and cried together.”\n\nBesides being the main vocalist for Apink, she also appears in musicals, on soundtracks for dramas and even starred in Reply 1997 as the female lead.\n\nIU\n\nIU famously grew up with her grandmother when she was younger, due to both her parents having to work for a living. According to Koreaboo, while it was not an unhappy childhood, they were living in a basement, in a cockroach-infested room. This was due to her mother’s misfortune in signing as a guarantor of a debt and the debtee then fleeing.\n\nJo Kwon from 2AM\n\nDespite the fact that he was a ballad singer, 2AM’s Jo Kwon consistently worked hard on variety shows to prove he was also funny, often showing off his “kkap dance” that soon became a trend. KpopStarz revealed that after some dark times for his indebted family, he was able to pay off his family’s debts, and went on to buy his mother an apartment.\n\nZico\n\nChungha\n\nThough they earn millions now, kudos to all the idols out there putting their families first."
