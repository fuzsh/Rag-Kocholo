        "text": "Hyeri apologizes after Dispatch confirms the couple actually split in June!\n\nAccording to Dispatch's report on March 18, Ryu Jun-yeol and Hyeri have separated since June last year. The actor didn't even attend Hyeri's birthday party. This separation date corresponds to the timeline given by Han So Hee to deny any infidelity before deleting her blog.\n\nA close acquaintance of Jun-yeol and Hyeri said, “ Both of them rarely talk about their romantic problems. Yet we could feel it even if they didn't say anything. They contacted each other very frequently… but then it gradually diminished. Ryu Jun-yeol didn't even attend Hyeri's birthday party, so everyone could feel the unusual atmosphere between them. “\n\nDispatched revealed that Ryu Jun-yeol and Hyeri didn't have the courage to confirm their breakup because they had been dating for 7 years, which was a very long time. From June to September, the two did not contact or meet each other. So it was only at the beginning of November that they decided to break up and released an official announcement regarding the end of their relationship. Soon after, on November 15, Ryu Jun-yeol met Han So-hee for the first time at his exhibition.\n\nThe Dispatch report brought a lot of attention to Hyeri's behavior. The Girl's Day member posted a photo on her Instagram account reminiscent of Hawaii after rumors of Ryu and Han dating were relayed by the media with the only comment: \"It's fun.\" This led many netizens and fans to wonder if Ryu might have started dating Han before making his breakup with Hyeri official. Because of the singer's Story, Han had to explain himself to the public and deny any kind of emotional infidelity. His silence received a lot of criticism after the Dispatch report.\n\nOn March 18, Hyeri posted a lengthy letter on her Instagram account apologizing for her controversial Instagram Story. She wrote : \" Hi. It's Hyeri. First of all, I sincerely apologize for sparking speculation and controversy with a post expressing my personal feelings a few days ago. I didn't think about how my actions could lead to such major problems. I sincerely apologize to anyone who was hurt by my behavior.”\n\nRegarding her breakup with Ryu Jun-yeol, Hyeri explained: “In November last year, the story about the end of my 8-year relationship was reported. We didn't accept the decision after a short thought, and even after announcing our breakup to the media, we decided to talk more about our relationship [in the future]. However, since that conversation, we have never contacted or seen each other again.\".\n\nShe continued: “I believe the feelings I felt after hearing the recent news after 4 months were the feelings I felt as Lee Hye-ri, not as actress Lee Hye-ri. Once again, I am sorry that I caused harm with my emotions at that time.”\n\nHyeri added: “I actually couldn't explain my actions over the past few days because our conversation was too private and I thought it would tire me out a lot more. If this has confused anyone, I would like to apologize.\"\n\nShe ended her letter by saying: “From now on, I will be more careful with my words and actions. I will delete this post soon. THANKS. »"
