        "text": "Girl’s Day is a group I haven’t considered one of my own for very long, but a group that has been growing on me. They do sexy better than the absolute majority, and for a group that started out extremely cutely, that’s impressive. I don’t know much about them, but their latest single was great, and they’ve produced some of the more memorable dances of the last few years. Plus they’re stunning, so what’s there not to like? Let’s make this day a Girl’s Day!\n\n4. Sojin\n\nBirth name: Park So Jin\n\nStage name: Sojin\n\nBirthday: May 21, 1986\n\nOfficial height: 167 cm\n\nPosition: Leader, Lead Vocalist\n\nComment: Sojin is my second-favorite singer in the group, and a very sexy and beautiful girl. She looks very fresh and younger than she is, yet she doesn’t look immature, which I like. I have nothing whatsoever against her, it’s just that she hasn’t been able to capture me as much as the others have.\n\n3. Yura\n\nBirth name: Kim Ah Young\n\nStage name: Yura\n\nBirthday: November 6, 1992\n\nOfficial height: 168 cm\n\nPosition: Lead Dancer, Vocalist\n\nComment: Yura is so stunning. Just as I’ve said before, she’s so beautiful that it’s almost a little boring. She’s a classic kpop beauty, with a face that’s undeniable.\n\nI think she’s my favorite dancer in the group, but they’re all fairly equal to me.\n\nI see Yura as the weakest singer in the group, but she isn’t too bad. If I’m remembering it correctly, she rapped in “Female President” though, and her rapping wasn’t too bad. Not great, but not bad for a female idol.\n\n2. Minah\n\nBirth name: Bang Min Ah\n\nStage name: Minah\n\nBirthday: May 13, 1993\n\nOfficial height: 165 cm\n\nPosition: Main Vocalist, Face of the Group\n\nComment: I was completely sure that Yura’s the face of the group, but I guess I was wrong. Minah seems to be the most popular member though, so maybe this is a popularity thing and not a looks thing. Not that Minah isn’t pretty, she’s adorable. And she looks so so young. Yes, she’s only 21, which is young, but she looks about 15-16 to me.\n\nMinah is the strongest singer in the group, for sure, and hearing such a voice come out of such an adorable little bunny of a girl still surprises me. She isn’t perfect, of course, but she’s a very capable main vocalist.\n\n1. Hyeri\n\nBirth name: Lee Hye Ri\n\nStage name: Hyeri\n\nBirthday: June 9, 1994\n\nOfficial height: 167 cm\n\nPosition: Lead Dancer, Vocalist, Maknae\n\nComment: I can’t explain my attachment to Hyeri. I don’t think she’s the best singer nor the prettiest, yet she’s the one that my eyes go to. I just found out that she’s a close friend of Dalshabet’s Subin, another kpop girl that I can’t explain why I like so much. It’s a strange world.\n\nWhile I do think Yura’s the prettiest member, Hyeri’s face is my favorite. She’s very cute, but at the same time there’s something edgy about her look that makes her much more interesting than just any kpop beauty.\n\nI find her to be a bit stronger as a singer than Yura, but it’s a slim margin. Just as I find Yura to be a slightly better dancer, by an equally tiny margin.\n\nLet me know who your favorite member of Girl’s Day is in the poll!\n\nIf you have any comments, suggestions or requests for Tuesday’s review, Friday’s list of the week or next Sunday’s random post then leave a comment, send me an ask on tumblr or email me at topofthekpops@gmail.com!\n\n– Admin A"
