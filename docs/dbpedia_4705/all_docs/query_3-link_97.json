        "text": "With the recent escalating drama, aren’t you curious about what exactly happened to the 7-year long time relationship between Ryu Jun Yeol and Lee Hyeri? Recently, a shocking report revealed that Ryu Jun Yeol and Lee Hyeri had been estranged long before their breakup reports. But, was it true, though? Because apparently, with all the controversies surrounding the prominent Korean actor, Greenpeace finally steps up and take action. So, what happened in this latest update of the Ryu Jun Yeol, Han So Hee, and Lee Hyeri drama? Find out more in the following complete report.\n\nMore Update on Ryu Jun Yeol, Han So Hee, and Lee Hyeri Dating Drama\n\nA new shocking revelation circulated in the Ryu Jun Yeol and Hyeri relationship drama. According to the source, the couple had been estranged long before their breakup report went public.\n\nPreviously, rumors about Ryu Jun Yeol starting a relationship with Han So Hee surfaced last week, sparking speculation among some netizens. They wondered if Ryu Jun Yeol had cleanly concluded his relationship with Hyeri, especially after Hyeri mentioned their plan to “talk things out.”\n\nIndustry insiders, however, clarified that Hyeri’s statement about discussing their relationship was merely a formality, not an indication of unresolved feelings.\n\nOn March 21, Korean media TV Daily revealed that Ryu Jun Yeol and Hyeri had chosen to take a break from the relationship back in February 2023. This was around Hyeri’s busy schedule with her film “Victory.”\n\nThis “break” essentially meant they were breaking up, a fact that became apparent when Ryu Jun Yeol missed Hyeri’s birthday. By mid-year, reporters started inquiring about their breakup, but both parties hesitated to provide clear answers.\n\n“You see that with relationships that lasted a long time. It’s difficult for them to be clear about the concluding point.”\n\nInsider A.\n\nDenying the Unresolved Business Stated by Lee Hyeri\n\nFurthermore, these insiders—who claimed to be acquaintances of Ryu Jun Yeol and Hyeri—denied claims that Ryu Jun Yeol misled the actress when their relationship ended.\n\nAccording to these acquaintances, the couple had already seen the end coming and had only met once in the past year. Despite officially announcing their breakup in November, they had actually decided to take time to reflect on their relationship as early as February 2023.\n\nThese acquaintances also dismissed allegations that Ryu Jun Yeol had given Hyeri false hope. The controversy stemmed from Hyeri’s previous statement about intending to discuss their relationship further, a conversation that never happened.\n\n“They only met each other in-person once all of last year. So, they were already more or less broken up.\n\nHyeri must have known that those words, ‘let’s try to talk it out,’ were more of a formality than anything else. To say that it was a ‘transit relationship’ would be quite a stretch.”\n\nInsider B.\n\nNetizens Refutes the Claims\n\nImmediately after the claims went viral, Korean netizens began refuting the insiders’ accusations.\n\nOn March 21, a post on Korean online community Instiz rebutted the media’s claim that Ryu Jun Yeol and Hyeri’s estranged relationship. According to the community post, Hyeri was so busy filming “Victory” that she did not host any party to celebrate her birthday. So, how could Ryu Jun Yeol attend a party that had been nonexistent in the first place? Therefore, they believed that the insiders’ statements were lies.\n\nNot only that, but the statement saying that Ryu Jun Yeol and Hyeri broke up in June allegedly did not make sense. The post claimed no article mentioning the couple’s taking a break or breaking up at the time. And even Dispatch did not write such article. So, they believed that it was just a lie.\n\n“People think Ryu Junyeol missed Hyeri’s birthday party last year, but that’s not true.\n\nIn 2022, Ryu Junyeol actually planned a great birthday party for Hyeri, and they had a fun time with their friends. But last year, Hyeri was busy shooting her movie “Victory,” so she couldn’t have a party.\n\nDispatch got caught making up stories. They said there was a birthday party when there wasn’t. And they spread rumors that Han Sohee said they broke up in June after reading their article, but that story wasn’t even out until much later.\n\nIt looks like Dispatch is trying to make Hyeri look bad on purpose, suggesting she’s an ex-girlfriend who can’t let go. They’re just making stuff up to paint her in a bad light, and it’s not the first time they’ve done something like this.”\n\nNetizen’s claim on Instiz.\n\nA Media Play from Ryu Jun Yeol and Han So Hee?\n\nDue to these above accusations, netizens began criticizing Ryu Jun Yeol more, standing up to defend Hyeri from the escalating drama.\n\nAccording to the netizen, the reports were simply media play from Han So Hee, especially when Han So Hee already faced accusation of commissioning Dispatch.\n\n“Please stop bothering Hyeri. Why are you spreading rumors like this?”\n\n“Hyeri handled her public statement really well.”\n\n“People were blaming Han So Hee because she mentioned reading an article about their breakup in June, but no such article existed. Now, it seems like they’re writing that article just for her.”\n\n“The way they’re using the media is not fair.”\n\n“Really, just leave Hyeri alone. What’s the point of this?”\n\n“It’s too much. Hyeri deserves peace.”\n\n“Hyeri ended things in such a mature way, and yet here you are, stirring things up.”\n\n“Only met once? Do you really think Hyeri would say that if they barely saw each other?”\n\n“Was it the friend who was dating Ryu Jun Yeol and not Hyeri? How else would they claim to know so much?”\n\n“How do these ‘insiders’ have any clue about Hyeri and Ryu Jun Yeol’s private life?”\n\n“Who are these so-called insiders anyway?”\n\n“The more I hear from these insiders, the more I feel like supporting Hyeri.”\n\n“Ryu Jun Yeol, you should just come out and tell your side of the story.”\n\n“He’s making it look like Hyeri can’t let go. I’m all for supporting Hyeri.”\n\n“This media plays are just disrespectful.”\n\n“From what the ‘insider’ says, it sounds like Ryu Jun Yeol ignored Hyeri when she wanted to talk.”\n\n“It’s clear this leak came from Ryu Jun Yeol or Han So Hee’s side.”\n\n“Why did they then deny breaking up in August 2023?”\n\n“So, the insider was part of their relationship or what?”\n\nAfter Ryu Jun Yeol Problematic Scandals, Greenpeace is Taking Action\n\nFinally, because of all the problematic scandals and shocking revelations about Ryu Jun Yeol’s inconsistencies, Greenpeace Korea is reconsidering Ryu Jun Yeol’s role as their environmental ambassador.\n\nSince 2016, Ryu has been actively involved in Greenpeace campaigns and appointed as the first promotional ambassador for Greenpeace East Asia in April 2023.\n\nHowever, recent criticisms focus on his environmentally unfriendly actions, such as playing golf, using calf-skin leather bags, and frequently changing plastic phone cases.\n\nTherefore, Greenpeace is reviewing regulations related to their ambassador program in response to these concerns, emphasizing their operation on individual sponsorships without government or corporate funding.\n\n“Since 2016, Ryu Jun Yeol has been a key figure in Greenpeace campaigns and also supports the organization financially. That is why in recognition of his dedication and future commitment to environmental efforts, we named him the first promotional ambassador for Greenpeace East Asia in April 2023.\n\nHis role is entirely voluntary, driven by his personal commitment to the cause.\n\nAs of today, we’re addressing questions from our sponsors about this situation. Greenpeace relies exclusively on private donations, free from government or corporate funds. Therefore, we see this as a chance to reevaluate our ambassador program rules to better reflect our mission to elevate citizen voices for environmental change.\n\nThank you.”\n\nGreenpeace.\n\nSo, what do you think about this new revelation about Ryu Jun Yeol and Hyeri’s relationship drama? And will Greenpeace eventually terminate Ryu Jun Yeol from their ambassadorship?
