        "text": "Kapanlagi.com - Han So Hee and Ryu Jun Yeol finally admitted their relationship on Saturday (16/3/2024) after denying it the day before. This statement sparked controversy among netizens because some consider Han So Hee as the third person.\n\nThis time we look back at the journey of Ryu Jun Yeol and Hyeri's love, which according to Han So Hee's statement, actually broke up since early 2023. Not November!\n\n1. 2015\n\n(credit: tvN)\n\nIn 2015, Hyeri and Ryu Jun Yeol filmed the drama REPLY 1988 which became a hit at the time. This drama became one of the highest-rated cable TV series in history and is still often discussed until now.\n\nThe characters of Hyeri and Ryu Jun Yeol in this drama, Deoksun and Junghwan, who did not become a couple in the ending, made many people emotional. There are even many who declare themselves as Team Junghwan until now.\n\n2. 2016\n\nIn 2016, Hyeri and Ryu Jun Yeol attended the tvN10 Awards event in October. They sat at the same table and hugged each other when they both received the Popularity Awards.\n\nThey were also seen walking on stage together and even took a selfie that made Junghwan's team happy!\n\n3. 2017\n\nAfter Dispatch released photos of Ryu Jun Yeol and Hyeri's dates, they finally confirmed that they were indeed dating. Their agencies also stated that they had recently changed their relationship status from friends to lovers.\n\nOf course, this delighted the fans who have been shipping them since the Reply 1988 era.\n\n4. 2021 - Breakup Rumors\n\nHyeri and Ryu Jun Yeol were rumored to have ended their relationship. This was all because Hyeri and her co-star in the drama My Roommate is a Gumiho, Jang Ki Yong, were seen being overly affectionate, especially during a photoshoot for a magazine.\n\nThese rumors were only among netizens and there was no response from their agencies.\n\n5. 2021 - Unconfirmed Breakup Rumors\n\nContinuing from before, the breakup rumors between Hyeri and Ryu Jun Yeol were automatically debunked after netizens uploaded a photo of them having dinner together at a restaurant. Their relationship is considered to be going strong!\n\n6. 2022\n\nHyeri sent a coffee truck to the filming location of Ryu Jun Yeol's drama, MONEY GAME. Hyeri even came to the filming location herself to support her ex-boyfriend.\n\nThere was even a message that said: 'Ryu Jun Yeol, my love, happy birthday. From your number one fan.'\n\n7. Early 2023\n\nHyeri and Ryu Jun Yeol attended a reunion of the cast of REPLY 1988 in January 2023. In a photo uploaded by Lee Dong Hwi, Hyeri and Ryu Jun Yeol can be seen sitting separately. At that time, no one suspected anything about Hyeri and Ryu Jun Yeol's relationship.\n\n8. Mid-2023\n\nAccording to some netizens, during the HYEMILEECHAEYEPA event, there was a segment where Hyeri and others saw unread messages on their KakaoTalk. Hyeri was surprised when others had 100 unread messages. Hyeri then said that sometimes she doesn't receive any messages at all in a day.\n\nAt that time, some netizens felt strange and suspicious if there was something going on between Hyeri and Ryu Jun Yeol. It's strange for a couple not to chat at all.\n\n9. End of 2023\n\nWhat netizens feared finally happened. Hyeri and Ryu Jun Yeol confirmed their breakup in November 2023 after seven years (in Korean counting) of being in a relationship. Many K-Drama fans were heartbroken by this news.\n\n10. New Facts in 2024\n\nNew facts about the relationship between Hyeri and Ryu Jun Yeol were written by Han So Hee on her blog. Through a statement to confirm her relationship with Ryu Jun Yeol, Han So Hee wrote that her lover and Hyeri actually broke up since early 2023.\n\nFor your information, the love relationships between Korean celebrities are usually only reported to have ended several months after the incident. They do not immediately announce the breakup and only confirm it when the media reports it.\n\n(kpl/pit)\n\nDisclaimer: This translation from Bahasa Indonesia to English has been generated by Artificial Intelligence."
