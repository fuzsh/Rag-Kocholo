        "text": "Synopsis\n\nEarlier, when a photo of Han So-hee and Ryu-Jun-Yeol holidaying in Hawaii went viral, Yeol's ex-girlfriend, Girl's Day member Hyeri got cryptic on Instagram.\n\nSouth Korean actress Han So-hee finally broke the silence on her dating rumours with fellow actor Ryu-Jun-Yeol, a day after her agency dismissed rumours about their romance. On March 16, the ‘Gyeongseong Creature’ took to her blog and confirmed her romance with the ‘Reply 1988’ star.\n\n“I’m writing this in the hopes that I can hurt my precious fans even a little bit less. First, it’s true that we are in a relationship with positive feelings. However, I hope that people will not use the word “transfer.” Second, when we exchanged feelings for one another, it was already the beginning of 2024, and his breakup with that person was already wrapped up in early 2023,” wrote Han So Hee on the blog. She also apologised for being rude on Instagram.\n\nEarlier, when buzz about a possible romance between So-hee and Yeol broke out, the actor’s ex-girlfriend, Girl’s Day member Hyeri had made a cryptic post on Instagram. Sharing a picture of Hawaii, she wrote, “This is funny!”\n\nIn response to Hyeri’s post, the ‘Seven’ star wrote, “I also find this funny!” She had gone on to share a photo of a dog holding a knife, and wrote, “Explain this situation… I don’t like people who have a significant other, I don’t lead them on while saying we’re just friends, I don’t take an interest in them, I don’t develop a relationship with them, and I don’t get in the way of other people’s relationships. I like the program ‘EXchange,’ but there’s nothing like that in my life.” [The literal Korean title of the dating show “EXchange” is “transfer love”— a phrase that indicates ditching your partner for a new one.\n\nSo-hee also apologised for being mannerless on Instagram. “My pathetic Instagram story. It’s true, it was pathetic and lame. I temporarily lost all reason and behaved rudely. I will apologize to that person [Hyeri] regarding this fact, and I sincerely apologize to you all for not reacting wisely. Because I acted based on my emotions rather than rational thinking, I acknowledge that this is completely my fault, regardless of my reasons,” she wrote.\n\nRumours of a possible romance between the two began doing rounds on the Internet after the ‘Nevertheless’ star shared a photo of herself attending Ryu Jun Yeol’s photo exhibition. This made many eyebrows rise, as this coincided with the time Hyeri announced her separation from the ‘Believer’ star.\n\nOne of the most loved stars in South Korea, So-hee shot to global stardom after playing the love interest of K-Pop superstar, BTS ‘Maknae’ Jungkook in the 2023 hit single ‘Seven’. Some of her notable works include television series such as ‘My Name’, ‘Nevertheless’ and ‘Gyeongseong Creature’.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nWhy success of Blackstone’s repeat IT bet depends on these ifs and buts\n\nYour EV is 40% Chinese, and will remain so if this jigsaw is not solved\n\nRemember the July 19 global computer outage?
