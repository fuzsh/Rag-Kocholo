        "text": "Reply 1988 father-daughter duo Sung Dong Il and Hyeri reminisced on the past on a recent episode of Hyell’s Club. The interview was filled with both laughter and touching moments.\n\nAt one point, Hyeri asked what he originally thought of her. Sung Dong Il quipped, “I really wondered if she could act, but of course I can’t either,” causing the entire studio to erupt in laughter.\n\nShe probed further, and he honestly said she was “just normal.” However, he started seeing her differently after she told him one thing that he still remembers until this day.\n\nHyeri: But how was it? How did you feel when you first saw me?\n\nSung Dong Il: You were just normal. Your eyes are round, but I really like you. But then, it was like that when we finished working together.\n\n[Video could not be displayed]\n\nOne day, she approached him and revealed she had been wanting to tell him a secret; she had recently bought her parents a house: “Dad, I bought my parents a house. It’s so good. I really wanted to tell you, dad.”\n\n[Video could not be displayed]\n\nHer generosity and filial piety left a lasting impression on him. He hoped that his own children would grow up to develop a good personality like her.\n\nI started to see you differently then. Honestly, that was really nice of you. That’s why I told you that back then. I hope my children grow up like you, with a good personality and everything.\n\n— Sung Dong Il\n\n[Video could not be displayed]\n\nWatch the full interview below."
