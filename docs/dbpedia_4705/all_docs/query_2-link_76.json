        "text": "On May 25, the press conference for the upcoming tvN drama 'My Roommate is a Gumiho' took place. Here, Hyeri commented on playing the role of her character Lee Dam.\n\nHyeri stated, \"I initially thought Lee Dam and I had a lot of similarities, but when looking closer, I discovered that we actually have a lot of differences. I realized that I do not know a lot about the younger generation, and thus, I learned a lot through Lee Dam. I think these days, the younger people are much more subjective and confident, having clear perspectives and opinions.\"\n\nHyeri, who is really born in 1994, told the reporters, \"[The character of Lee Dam] is five years younger than me. But apparently, this is not enough to be considered a big generation gap. I decided to closely watch my younger industry juniors to see how they usually respond to different situations.\""
