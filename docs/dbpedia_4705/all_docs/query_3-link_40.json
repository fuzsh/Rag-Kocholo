        "text": "Hyeri is facing backlash for staying silent amid new revelations about her relationship with Ryu Jun Yeol.\n\nPreviously, Ryu Jun Yeol was suspected of leaving Han So Hee for Hyeri. The allegations gained credence when Hyeri uploaded a post to her Instagram alluding to the couple.\n\nHyeri Posts Cryptic Instagram Message And Unfollows Ryu Jun Yeol Amid Han So Hee Rumors\n\nIn her Instagram post, Hyeri cryptically wrote, “This is fun.”\n\nThe post immediately sparked backlash targetting Han So Hee, who refuted the accusations but did admit to her relationship with Ryu Jun Yeol. The controversy reached a fever pitch, however, when Han So Hee posted a response to Hyeri on her Instagram.\n\nNetizens Are Seated For The Drama As Han So Hee Allegedly Takes Snipe At Girl’s Day’s Hyeri\n\nAmid the controversy, on March 18, Dispatch released a bombshell article refuting allegations that Han So Hee had anything to do with the demise of Ryu Jun Yeol and Hyeri’s relationship.\n\nIn their article, Dispatch revealed that Ryu Jun Yeol and Hyeri had been estranged months before the actor ever met Han So Hee.\n\nThey grew distant around June 2023. Ryu Jun Yeol was not present at Hyeri’s birthday party either, which was in June.\n\nAs they started falling apart in June, they weren’t able to officially break up. As the summer and fall seasons passed, it was said that they barely contacted each other. It wasn’t until early November that they decided to officially part ways. Shortly after, on November 15, Ryu Jun Yeol and Han So Hee met for the first time at a photo exhibition.\n\n— Dispatch\n\nNetizens, after the Dispatch article, criticized Hyeri for her previous Instagram post and lamented her silence following it.\n\nI’m sure you knew how much power your words had… I’m not taking sides, but I am disappointed in your actions.\n\nStill, once you saw how much controversy your words caused, wouldn’t it be better to release a statement rather than be silent?\n\nEven if you felt a way, you should have kept it to yourself. It’s been months since you guys broke up. Why did you post that like a Middle School child?\n\nYou caused controversy with your words, and now you are being silent, lol. Is it fun to see Han So Hee getting criticized?\n\nWhy is she staying silent after writing that?\n\nCelebrities who break up after a long-term relationship should wait 10 years before dating someone new, or else they will be canceled, lol.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?"
