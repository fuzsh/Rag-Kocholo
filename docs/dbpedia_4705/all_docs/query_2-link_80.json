        "text": "According to Korea media outlets, Lee Hyeri, formerly associated with Creative Group ING, has decided not to renew her contract with her agency of 5 years. This decision comes a month after significant industry changes, as Creative Group ING was recently acquired by C-JeS Studio, the agency of Hyeri’s ex-boyfriend, actor Ryu Jun Yeol.\n\nPreviously, it was reported that C-JeS Studio had acquired 100% of the shares of Creative Group ING, including its management of Hyeri. Back then, things had just turned ugly over the sudden dating news between Han So Hee and Ryu Jun Yeol which quickly ended in their breakup. Given that Hyeri was the sole artist under Creative Group ING, the acquisition has brought her under the same management umbrella as Ryu Jun Yeol, which some found ironic given both artists’ past relationship as exes. On May 8, it was reported that Hyeri has chosen to leave the agency. Many applaud and support her decision.\n\nPhoto: hyeri_0609 / Instagram"
