        "text": "Updated June 10 KST:\n\nIn addition to sending a coffee truck, BLACKPINK’s Rosé prepared another surprise for Girl’s Day’s Hyeri!\n\nHyeri uploaded images of Rosé visiting her on set of “Thinking of the Moon When the Flower Blooms” (literal title) in celebration of Hyeri’s birthday, which was on June 9.\n\nHer caption reads, “Park Chaeng (short for Rosé’s real name Park Chae Young)… you… it is impossible to not love you. You who came with a giant bouquet of flowers while singing the ‘happy birthday’ song. I’m so touched. Thank you so, so much.”\n\nOriginal Article:\n\nGirl’s Day’s Hyeri showed off a sweet gift from BLACKPINK’s Rosé!\n\nOn June 10, she shared photos of herself with the coffee truck sent by Rosé. Rosé had sent the gift to Hyeri’s new historical drama “Thinking of the Moon When the Flower Blooms” (literal title). The top banner of the coffee truck reads, “Enjoy the churros, and I wish the drama will be a huge hit!” The banner on the side reads, “Everyone, churros and coffee are on Hyeri unnie today!! Good luck, ‘Thinking of the Moon When the Flower Blooms’!”\n\nHyeri wrote as the caption on Instagram, “Park Chae Young (Rosé’s real name) is awesome! My dongsaeng who always cheers for me like this. I love you. I’m so grateful that I’m crying.”\n\nThe two girl group members became close friends after Rosé made an appearance on “Amazing Saturday,” where Hyeri used to be a fixed cast member.\n\n“Thinking of the Moon When the Flower Blooms” will take place during the period of the strongest prohibition laws in Joseon history, depicting human desire and proving that prohibition is not the best option. The main characters are an inspector from the Office of the Inspector-General who has left his hometown to achieve fame in the capital Hanyang and restore his family’s status, a poor aristocratic woman who begins to make alcohol in order to pay back her debt, and a crown prince who often secretly climbs over the walls of the palace to get a few drinks. The three people have a fateful encounter in front of a secret alcohol storage, gaining a secret that could lead to death if revealed.\n\nHyeri will be taking on the role of Kang Ro Seo, who begins to make alcohol in order to pay back her debt. Contrary to her aristocratic appearance, she’s a figure who’s not afraid of working hard to make money. Though people talk behind her back about how she’s losing face as an aristocrat, she’s the real head of her household who’s helping to support her older brother, the family’s only hope.\n\nWatch Hyeri in “Two Cops“:\n\nWatch Now\n\nWhat are Cookies?\n\nWhen you visit any web site, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies.
