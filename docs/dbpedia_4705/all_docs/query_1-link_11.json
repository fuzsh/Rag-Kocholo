In 2014, the song Something from their fourth extended play Everyday 3 became their highest-charting single, peaking at No. 2 on both the Billboard’s K-Pop Hot 100 and the Gaon Digital Chart. The single’s music video also reached over a million views in just one day. In 2015, Girl’s Day ranked 13th in Forbes Korea’s Power Celebrity List.\n\nHyeri made her acting debut in the 2012 SBS weekend drama Tasty Life. In 2014, she won Best Female Newcomer at the MBC Entertainment Awards for her appearance on the variety show Real Men.
