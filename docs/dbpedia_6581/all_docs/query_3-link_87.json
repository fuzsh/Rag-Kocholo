It was quite profitable, helping the Follow The Leader album sell over 5 million copies.\n\nHere Comes Your ManPixies\n\n\"Here Comes Your Man\" is the closest the Pixies came to a hit in America. It was rumored to be about a drug dealer, but Black Francis says it's just a story about some hobos who travel by train and die in an earthquake.\n\nCandy GirlNew Edition\n\nIn the UK, the first #1 hit with a rap was \"Candy Girl\" by the American boy band New Edition in 1983.\n\nBlack Hole SunSoundgarden\n\nIt has long been speculated that the Soundgarden song \"Black Hole Sun\" came from the name of a sculpture in Seattle, but according to their frontman Chris Cornell the title came from a phrase he misheard on the news. The band's name did come from a sculpture.\n\nDon FelderSongwriter Interviews\n\nDon breaks down \"Hotel California\" and other songs he wrote as a member of the Eagles. Now we know where the \"warm smell of colitas\" came from.\n\nDan ReedSongwriter Interviews\n\nDan cracked the Top 40 with \"Ritual,\" then went to India and spent 2 hours with the Dalai Lama.\n\nSteely DanFact or Fiction\n\nDid they really trade their guitarist to The Doobie Brothers? Are they named after something naughty? And what's up with the band name?\n\n90210 to Buffy to Glee: How Songs Transformed TVSong Writing\n\nShows like Dawson's Creek, Grey's Anatomy and Buffy the Vampire Slayer changed the way songs were heard on TV, and produced some hits in the process."
