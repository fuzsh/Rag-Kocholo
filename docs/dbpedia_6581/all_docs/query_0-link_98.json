        "text": "Surprise Passenger\n\nThe next event worth mentioning was that we were very surprised to receive Mr. Winston Churchill, whom we transported to Placentia Harbour in Newfoundland, where he met Roosevelt for what is now called the Atlantic Charter meeting. We were a private ship, no flag officer carried; however we had a tremendous amount of brass present on this occasion: all the Chiefs of Staff and a myriad of staff officers who were in Churchill’s entourage.\n\nOn the approaches to the Canadian area, or at the time the Newfoundland area [not a province of Canada until 1949] we were met by three Canadian destroyers [HMS Ripley, HMCS Assiniboine and HMCS Restigouche]. This was my first opportunity to see the Canadian Navy at work. They escorted us into Placentia Harbour.\n\nShooting Crap with Roosevelt's Son\n\nOn another occasion, all the officers of the Prince of Wales were introduced to Mr. Roosevelt. He took a particular interest in me because I was at that time one of only two Canadian officers in the wardroom, the other being Ralph Ripley. As a matter of interest, a midshipman, Dick Leir, was also aboard the ship at that time; he had joined during the repair period as well.\n\nOld Man Not Amused\n\nEach evening during the crossing both going over to Newfoundland and on the way back to the UK, Churchill would come directly into the wardroom after deck, over the upper deck to the bridge structure. At one point, the Sub placed his hand on Churchill’s elbow as if to help him along, and was told in no uncertain terms, to keep his hands off him. Mr. Churchill was perfectly capable of looking after himself. He’d been to sea before this boy was born and would he please just lead him up to the bridge."
