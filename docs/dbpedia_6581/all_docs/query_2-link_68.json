Besides painting, she also enjoys creating collages, going to concerts, and traveling.\n\nRachel Sobers\n\nSophomore\n\nRachel feeds her creative soul with the words of her favorite poets. She transforms paints, pencils, and paper into works of art, writes poetry and prose for literary contests, and publishes artwork that reflects her heart. She believes in the power of purposeful contemplation. “I often display my work in art shows in the Virginia Beach area, always searching for the event with the cause most meaningful to me. I have published various poetry collections on online platforms, and I am also the designer of my own website exhibiting both writing and painting.” While art is at the core of her personal happiness, she often seeks out new adventures to conceptualize her next creative endeavor.\n\n“I am most excited to be a Curb Scholar because I believe in the power of collaboration. Opportunity, risk, creativity, and change are born from passionate conversation and observation!”\n\nAnthony Tang\n\nSenior\n\nAnthony is an intended Economics major with a passion for political advocacy which he has pursued through many avenues: researching public policy with local professors, working with a congressional campaign, and creating change through his non-profit organization, the Advocates for Civic Engagement.
