        "text": "During a period when first touring in the United States, where rowdy Stewart and his band were prohibited from staying in some hotels, the band used to masquerade as Fleetwood Mac in order acquire accommodation.\n\nAlthough he was born in England and has English blood on his mother's side, he has Scottish blood on his father's side and prefers to be considered a Scotsman. He is an avid supporter of Glasgow Celtic Football Club and the Scotland national team.\n\nA lifelong collector of model trains, Stewart maintains an elaborate outlay in an upstairs room of his Los Angeles home that stretches the length of his house. Bases his layout scale on the 1940s New York Central and Pennsylvania line.\n\nWhen then-girlfriend Britt Ekland discovered that Stewart was seeing other women, she filed a $12.5 million palimony suit, claiming that, as she had given up much of her career for him, she deserved a large portion of his income. The lawsuit was dismissed.\n\nIn an early stage of The Kinks, before future frontman Ray Davies was willing to be the lead singer, they recruited Stewart (who grew up in the same neighborhood as the Davies brothers) as a singer. After a couple of weeks of trying to be a band, Stewart and the future Kinks found that they did not get along that well, with their musical tastes being too different, and parted ways.\n\nInstead of getting married again, I'm going to find a woman I don't like and just give her a house.\n\n[on looking young] The secret is to moisturise the face. I've been doing that since I was 17 years old."
