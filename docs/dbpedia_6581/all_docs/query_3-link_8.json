        "text": "Sir Rod Stewart has showered his sister with affection as she celebrated her 95th birthday amid the festive activities of Christmas.\n\nThe 78-year-old music legend is the youngest of five children - with Mary on of two sisters, while he also had two brothers. And on Boxing Day, Sir Rod put a spotlight on his sister as she marked a rather impressive birthday.\n\nTaking to Instagram Stories the day after Christmas, Sir Rod shared a snap of himself and his sister posing together in a luxurious hotel. The Maggie May singer dazzled in a shimmering animal print evening jacket, crisp white shirt, white coloured suit vest, and pipe-straight black trousers.\n\nWhile Mary looked elegant in a dark coloured dress, and accessorised with a necklace and a chic evening handbag. Sir Rod threw the spotlight on his sibling as he uploaded the snap for his fans and social media followers to admire, while adding the caption: “Happy 95th sister Mary.”\n\nSir Rod was joined by other members of his family as they celebrated Mary’s birthday together, with son Aiden, wife Penny Lancaster, his other son Alastair and Alastair’s girlfriend Eloise May Darlington all gathering together. Sir Rod has often shared his affection for his sister - even bringing her on stage with him when he has performed.\n\nJust last year, the music legend was performing in Edinburgh when he brought Mary out to join him in front of thousands of adoring fans. He sand his 1975 song Sailing while introducing his sibling, declaring: “This is my sister!” Mary then happily waved to the audience and they sang and danced together.\n\nSir Rod then told his audience at the time: “At 94, she’s on a rock’n’roll stage and loving it. She has and continues to teach me about life.” Both of Rod’s older brothers, Bob and Don, died in September last year at the ages of 88 and 94 respectively.\n\nThe heartbroken star announced the sad news via social media at the time, declaring: “It’s with great sadness that I announce the loss of my brother Bob last night, who joins my brother Don on the great football pitch in the sky. I’ve lost two of my best mates in the space of two months. RIP Don and Bob ‘irreplaceable buddies’.”\n\nSir Rod has a large family of his own - having welcomed eight children over the years. He is the father of four daughters; Sarah, 59, Kimberly, 44, Ruby, 36, and Renee, 31 - and four sons; Sean, 43, Liam, 29, Alastair Wallace, 18, and Aiden Patrick, 12. He welcomed his eldest child, Sarah, with ex-girlfriend Susannah Boffey in the early 1960s, but wasn't part of her life for many years. He then welcomed Kimberly and Sean with his ex-wife Alana Stewart, and daughter Ruby with ex-girlfriend Kelly Emberg.\n\nStewart had two more children, His next two children, Renee and Liam, were the product of his marraige to model Rachel Hunter. And he shares his two youngest sons, Alastair and Aiden, with his wife Penny Lancaster.\n\nDiscussing fatherhood with People magazine in 2021, the star said: \"I have to be several different fathers because of the different age groups of my kids. You really have to treat all of them as individuals with individual problems. All the [older] kids went through their little bad period of drinking too much and dabbling in drugs - except for Liam; I don't think he ever did - but they all came out on the other side. As a dad, I've learned to listen and not blow my top.\""
