        "text": "1904-1907 The International Hockey League Professionals era\n\n1904 The Palestra ice arena was erected in Laurium, near Calumet; the skate surface was 180 feet by 78 feet; it was built by Nels Ulseth. It was reported to be the first structure ever built in this country specifically for hockey. It had a seating capacity of 4,000 when at the time, the population of the copper mining town of Calumet was 4,668. The Palestra name is Greek in origin, denoting \"an athletic training center\"\n\nPalestra in Laurium\n\nThe first hockey game was played in the Palestra Dec 16, 1904, between the two local representatives of the International Hockey League, Portage Lake and Calumet. Calumet won by a score of 4-3, attendance was 3,000.\n\nPlayers and Positions for this Dec 16, 1904 Game at the Palestra in Laurium:\n\nPortage Lake Position Calumet\n\nHern Goal Nickolson\n\nGibson Point MacMillan\n\nHolden C.

Gasoline Alley Body shop is located there today and the Bi-Centennial Ice Arena is just across the field on the same side of the street. In 1921, the Palestra was sold, then dismantled and transported by rail to Marquette about 100 miles away. It took just 51 days to do this and rebuild the Palestra in Marquette where it became Marquette's first indoor skate rink.\n\n1903-04 The 1904 Portage Lakes won the American Championship over the Pittsburgh Victorias and the World Championship over the Montreal Wanderers who were the reigning Canadian Champions. During this season, in 25 games, they scored 258 goals and allowed only 49, with only 2 defeats. J.L. \"Doc\" Gibson was the leading scorer for Portage Lake.\n\nPortage Lake vs Pittsburg Bankers\n\n4 Feb 1904\n\nDaily Mining Gazette\n\n1903-04 Roster & Game Results\n\nThe 1904 Portage Lake team members and managers were:\n\nBack row L-R: N.F.

Webb, manager of the Portage Lake hockey team, received a communication last night from the manager of the Wanderers of Montreal in which he challenged the Portage Lakes for the championship of the world. The Wanderers are considered to be one of the fastest teams in existence and are anxious to meet the Portage Lake aggregation at any time or place. The expense of bringing the Montreal team here will be very great, but it is thought that this difficulty will be overcome. Mr. Webb will communicate with the Wanderers' management at once and will endeavor to make satisfactory arrangement for a series of games and there is little doubt that the residents for Portage Lake will be able to witness a game for the championship of the world at the Amphidrome some time during the coming week.\" Announcement of Wanderers Challenge\n\n18 March 1904\n\nDaily Mining Gazette Newspaper Ad for\n\nWorld's Championship\n\n20 March 1904\n\nDaily Mining Gazette\n\nPortage Lake decisively won these games 8-4 and 9-2 becoming the\n\nWorld's Champions!\n\n1904 The Hancock High School team won the local Amphidrome Cup and were the Champions of Michigan.

This 1904 photograph is thought to be the first documented evidence of a black high school hockey player.\n\n\"This picture is so unique, that it is on display in the US Hockey Hall of Fame in Eveleth, Minnesota.\"\n\nCensus shows there were several families living in this area at the time with the last name of Black.\n\n1904-05 Inaugural season for International (Professional) Hockey League (IHL) consisting of five communities in the United States and Ontario: Houghton Portage Lakes with home ice in the new Amphidrome on Portage Lake and team colors of Green & White; Calumet with home ice in the new Palastra and team colors of Pearl Gray & Cardinal; Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan with home ice at their local curling rink named the Ridge Street Ice-A-Torium and team colors of Purple & White; Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario with home ice at their local Curling Rink called and team colors of Red & Black (the following year, they changed their team colors to Red & White); and Pittsburgh, PA with home ice in the Duquesne Gardens and team colors of Red & Blue. (Referees wore yellow sweaters during games.) This professional league attracted many of the best of the Canadian players from the established Canadian amateur leagues to come here to play pro in the US. Every player in the International Hockey League received a salary and some were also given lucrative jobs in the community. \"Hod\" Stuart, from Ottawa, Ontario, who was considered by some to be the \"greatest hockey player in the world\" was paid $1,800 by Calumet to play for the team and manage their rink for the 1904-05 season! Since the hockey season was only 2+ months long because of the natural ice, most Canadian players returned home to their families and regular jobs in Canada at the end of each season; requiring the IHL managers to organize a new team each season.\n\nCalumet, led by the Canadian born \"Hod\" Stuart, won the first league championship, the next two titles in 1905-06 and 1906-07 titles were won by Houghton's Portage Lakes. The Canadian Soo was the weaker club and in fact did not play in the 1905-06 IHL season.\n\nThe IHL operated for only three seasons, disbanding in the fall of 1907 when Canada established a professional league and drew many players back to Canada to play for their home crowds. Until then, keeping in the European tradition, Canada allowed only amateur status hockey and publicly scorned professionalizing athletics. As quoted in the Copper Country Evening News in 1904, John Ross Robertson of the OHA was reported to have said \"for self preservation, the stand of the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) against the professionalism of Pittsburgh, Houghton, Calumet and the Soo must be uncompromisingly antagonistic...Any player who figures on any of these teams must be banished from Ontario Hockey.\"\n\nAn excerpt from the article written by Daniel S. Mason \"The International Hockey League and the Professionalization of Ice Hockey, 1904-1907\" and presented at the 1997 North American Society for Sport History conference held at Springfield College. ...\"While the leagues in Canada had been accused of professional practices for several years, it was not until the formation of the Portage Lakes Hockey Club and the International Hockey League in 1904 that open professionalism arrived in hockey. The Portage Lakes Hockey Club would be the flagship team and would be joined by a club from Pittsburgh, which would disband the [amateur] Western Pennsylvania League in order to enter a team in the new professional circuit. During the previous season, in 1903-04, exhibition games against the Portage Lakes team had led the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) to ban both the Sault Ste. Marie towns. [the Canadian Soo and the American Soo] As a result, it was likely that the two Soo teams would join the new league, as they would be unable to compete against the Canadian amateur teams. In the fall of 1903, James R. Dee of Houghton wrote to Pittsburgh to initiate discussion on the formation of a national hockey association. By the fall of 1904 with the possible inclusion of a team from the Canadian Soo, the Sault Ste. Marie Evening News reported that the proposed league would \"adapt the name 'International' or something of similar significance\" At a meeting held on November 5, 1904, prominent business leaders from Pittsburgh, the Canadian Soo, and Northern Michigan considered franchises for a number of cities including Montreal, Detroit, Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Milwaukee, Grand Rapids, and Duluth. Eventually, the league accepted teams from Houghton, Pittsburgh, the two Soos; and Calumet, the nearby civic rival of Houghton. In addition, a revenue-sharing plan suggested by the Canadian Soo--that gate receipts be divided in a 60-40, home-visitor split--was adopted by the league. Revenue sharing would make the long journey to Pittsburgh more palatable, given the potential gate money that could be generated in that city's commodious [5,000 seating capacity] Duquesne Gardens.....\" ...\"Local businesses [in the five communities] took advantage of the league's popularity, by installing private telephones in hotels and saloons that allowed reports to be relayed directly from the arenas. [such as the Dunn Bros. of Fifth Street in Houghton] Similarly, railway companies scheduled extra excursions to and from nearby IHL communities, both before and after games, arranged for spectators to travel the longer distances for games against league rivals....\" The Copper Range Railroad charged fifty cents for fare between Houghton and Calumet, 15 miles apart; one game between the two rivals in 1905, carried eighteen cars full of passengers. The Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic RR charged six dollars for fare between Houghton and the American Soo and $6.50 from Calumet to the American Soo and back.\n\n1904-05 Portage Lakes IHL Pro Team\n\nMembers of this team were:\n\nBruce Stuart, Fred Lake, Harry Bright, Bert Morrison, Barney Holden, Charles Liffiton, William Cooney Shields, Lorne Campbell, John \"Doc\" Gibson, Joe McMaster, Ernest Westcott, Andy Haller, William Riley Hern -Goal.

During this season, the Portage Lake Hockey Team challenged the Montreal Wanderers, then Canadian champions, to a series of two games, one to be played in Houghton and other at Montreal. Portage Lake won both contests, thus they were the Worlds Champions. They sent word to the Stanley Cup Committee Board of Governors challenging Montreal to a championship; they were denied the opportunity, again, because of the Portage Lake team's professional status.\n\nMembers of the IHL Pro Calumet Team 1905-06 were:\n\nWilliam \"Cooney\" Shields, Dr. Robert Scott, Jimmy Gardner, Fred Strike, \"Harry\" Bellefeuille, Edmund Decorie, -- McDonald, Con Corbeau, Ken Mallen, James Mallen, and Goalie Billy Nicholson who played all 21 games; plus one game each for players: Lorne Campbell, -- Larson, \"Hod\" Stuart, Joe Linder, -- Milne.\n\nCalumet played 21 games with 4 Wins, 17 Losses.\n\nPlease Contact webmaster if you have a picture of this 1905-06 Calumet team.\n\nIn 1905, the Portage Lake team challenged for the Stanley Cup.
