        "text": "When Beyoncé announced her upcoming album, Cowboy Carter, with the drop of two distinctly country tracks, she broke both genre and barriers. Not only did Queen Bey continue to prove she can do just about anything, but she joined a long tradition of country music crossover albums.\n\nCountry music is, like all genres, a construct, designed by marketing companies around the advent of widely-disseminated recorded music, to sell albums. But in the roughly 100 intervening years, genre has dictated much about the who and how of music making.\n\nIn the racially segregated America of the 1920s, music was no exception. Marketing companies began to distinguish between \"race records\" (blues, R&B, and gospel) intended for Black audiences and hillbilly music (country and Western), sold to white listeners. The decision still echoes through music genre stereotypes today.\n\nBut Black people have always been a part of country music, a message that's gained recognition in recent years — in part because of advocacy work by those like Rhiannon Giddens, who plays banjo and viola on \"Texas Hold 'Em,\" one of two singles Beyoncé released in advance of Cowboy Carter.\n\nAnd since rigid genre rules' inception, many artists from Lil Nas X to Bruce Springsteen have periodically dabbled in or even crossed over to country music.\n\nIn honor of Beyoncé's foray, here are eight times musicians from other genres tried out country music.\n\nRay Charles — Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music (1962)\n\nIn 1962, the soul music pioneer crossed the genre divide to cut a swingin' two-volume, 14-track revue of country and western music.\n\nPart history lesson and part demonstration of Charles' unparalleled musicianship, Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music covers country songs by major country artists of the era, including Hank Williams, Don Gibson, and Eddy Arnold. An instant success, the record topped album sales charts and was Charles' first atop the Billboard Hot 200 charts.\n\nRingo Starr — Beaucoups of Blues (1970)\n\nThe Beatles' drummer loves country music. Ringo Starr cut this album, which sounds like something you'd two-step the night away to at a honky tonk, as his second solo project. He was inspired by pedal steel guitar player and producer Pete Drake, who worked on George Harrison's All Things Must Pass.\n\nWith Drake's help, Starr draws out a classic honky tonk sound — pedal steel, country fiddle, and bar room piano — to round out the album.\n\nBeaucoups includes a textbook country heartbreak song, \"Fastest Growing Heartache in the West,\" a bluesy ramblin' man ballad, \"$15 Draw,\" and a surprisingly sweet love song to a sex worker, \"Woman Of The Night.\"\n\nThe Pointer Sisters — Fairytale (1974)\n\nRemembered for their R&B hits like \"I'm So Excited\" and \"Jump (For My Love)\", the Pointer Sisters dropped \"Fairytale,\" a classic country heartbreak song into the middle of their second studio album, That's A Plenty.\n\nFull of honky tonk pedal steel and fiddle, the track earned the band a GRAMMY award for Country and Western Vocal Performance Group or Duo in 1975, beating out Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, Bobby Bare, and the Statler Brothers; they were the first, and to date, only Black women to receive the award.\n\nThe same year the song came out, the Pointer Sisters also became the first Black group to play the Grand Ole Opry, arriving to find a group of protesters holding signs with messages like 'Keep country, country!'\n\nTina Turner — Tina Turns the Country On! (1974)\n\nAlso in 1974, Tina Turner cut her first solo album, Tina Turns the Country On!, while she was still performing with then-husband Ike Turner as the Ike & Tina Turner Revue.\n\nContaining the seeds of the powerful, riveting voice she'd fully let loose in her long solo career after separating from her abusive husband, the album presents a stripped down, mellow Turner.\n\nShe covers songs like Kris Kristofferson's \"Help Me Make It Through The Night\" and Bob Dylan's \"Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You,\" and delivers a soaring rendition of Dolly Parton's \"There Will Always Be Music.\"\n\nTurner was nominated for a GRAMMY award for the album, but in Best R&B Vocal Performance, Female, category.\n\nThe Beastie Boys — Country Mike's Greatest Hits (1999)\n\nThis Beastie Boys cut only a few hundred copies (most reports say 300) of this spoof country album — reputedly conceived of as a Christmas present for friends and family, and never officially released.\n\nPresenting the supposed greatest hits of a slightly dodgy, enigmatic character – Country Mike, who shares a name with band member \"Mike D\" Diamond — the album sounds like vintage steel guitar country. Think Hank Williams and Jimmy Rodgers with a dash of musical oddballs Louden Wainwright III and David Allen Coe's humor and funk.\n\nCountry Mike appears just briefly in the liner notes of the band's anthology album, The Sounds of Silence, (which also includes two of the album's tracks: \"Railroad Blues\" and \"Country Mike's Theme\"), as part of an alternate universe wherein Mike temporarily lost his memory when he was hit on the head.\n\n\"The psychologists told us that if we didn't play along with Mike's fantasy, he could be in grave danger,\" the notes read. \"This song ('Railroad Blues') is one of the many that we made during that tragic period of time.\"\n\nCyndi Lauper — Detour (2016)\n\nThe \"Girls Just Want To Have Fun\" singer enjoyed herself thoroughly by deviating from her typical style with 2016's Detour.\n\nRoad tripping into country music land, Lauper covered country songs of the 1950s and 1960s, including Marty Robbins' \"Begging You,\" Patsy Montana's \"I Want to be a Cowboy's Sweetheart\" and Dolly Parton's \"Hard Candy Christmas\" with guest appearances by Willie Nelson, Alison Krauss, Emmylou Harris, and Vince Gill.\n\nJaret Ray Reddick — Just Woke Up (2022)\n\nIt might be hard to imagine the Bowling for Soup frontman, known for teenage pop-punk angst hits like \"Girl all the Bad Guys Want\" and \"Punk Rock 101\" crooning country ballads.\n\nBut in 2022, under the name Jaret Ray Reddick, he cut his solo debut, Just Woke Up. Drawing inspiration from Reddick's native Texas, the steel guitar and twang driven album features duets with Uncle Cracker, Cody Canada, Frank Turner, and Stephen Egerton.\n\nSelf-effacing and personable as ever, Reddick heads off questions about the viability of his country music with the album's first track, \"Way More Country,\" acknowledging the questions listeners might have:\n\n\"I sing in a punk rock band/ And I know every word to that Eminem song \"Stan\"/ And I've got about a hundred and ten tattoos / But I'm way more country than you.\"\n\nBing Crosby — \"Pistol Packin' Mama\" (Single, 1943)\n\nLegendary crooner of classic Christmas Carols and American standards, Bing Crosby decided to try his hand at country music with his cover of Al Dexter's \"Pistol Packin' Mama,\" the first country song to appear on Billboard's charts.\n\nThe song, which tells the story of a man begging his woman not to shoot him when she discovers him out on the town fooling around, has since also been covered by Willie Nelson, Hoyt Axton, and John Prine.\n\nHow Beyoncé Is Honoring Black Music History With \"Texas Hold Em,\" 'Renaissance' & More\n\nOne of Canada's biggest rock stars, Bryan Adams has had a massively successful and sonically diverse career that spans 45 years. With one win and 16 GRAMMY nominations under his belt, Adams' prolific output includes numerous chart-topping albums and big-name collaborations.\n\nYet, for a man who has sold over 75 million albums and wants his music to appeal to as wide an audience as possible, Bryan Adams doesn't seem to seek the limelight.\n\nHe’s not tabloid fodder, doesn’t date celebrities, and does not court controversy. While he certainly will promote his latest album or tour — and will begin his international tour on Jan. 20 in Montana — but Adams is an intensely private individual who is selective with the interviews that he gives and in what he speaks about. He is also not a flamboyantly dressed performer, preferring the jeans and t-shirt that he has carried over from his very beginnings. Appropriately enough, he often calls his band the Dudes Of Leisure.\n\nAdams’ most recent studio album is called So Happy It Hurts and recently released a 3-CD box set of live recordings of three classic albums performed at London’s Royal Albert Hall: Cuts Like A Knife, Into The Fire, and Waking Up The Neighbors.\n\nAhead of his So Happy It Hurts Tour — which will certainly see Adams perform hits \"Summer Of ‘69,\" \"(Everything I Do) I Do It For You,\" \"Can’t Stop This Thing We Started\" — read on for 10 lesser-known facts about the raspy-voiced rocker.\n\nwho has befriended and collaborated with an impressive range of artists across numerous media.\n\nHe Signed His First Contract For $1\n\nBack in 1978, when was just 18 years old, Adams signed a recording contract with A&M Records who decided to take a chance on the fledgling rocker with a \"wait and see\" attitude.\n\nThey signed him for the paltry sum of $1 which Adams insisted on receiving so he could frame it.\n\nWhile his first two albums, Bryan Adams (1980) and You Want It You Got It (1981) didn’t exactly set the world on fire, his third release Cuts Like A Knife (1983) went platinum in America and triple platinum in his native Canada, selling at least 1.5 million copies worldwide. Seems like A&M got a great return on their investment.\n\nHis Breakthrough Hit Was Written For Someone Else\n\nIn January 1983, producer Bruce Fairbairn asked Adams and songwriting partner Jim Vallance to come up with a song for Blue Öyster Cult. Their original version of \"Run To You\" did not impress the band (or Adams) and they passed — so did .38 Special and other groups.\n\nWhen Adams needed one more song for 1984’s Reckless, he pulled out \"Run\" and taught it to his band. This time, everyone including album producer Bob Clearmountain was impressed. It became the album's lead single and Adams' biggest hit, peaking at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.\n\nAlthough the previous Cuts Like A Knife had three hits singles and went platinum, Reckless spawned six hits (\"Heaven\" went No. 1) and turned Adams into a superstar, selling 5 million copies in America and reportedly 7 million more globally.\n\nHe’s Penned Dozens Of Songs For Others\n\nAdams has co-written songs for numerous other artists, many of them hard rockers. In 1982, he and Vallance co-wrote \"Rock and Roll Hell\" and \"War Machine\" with Gene Simmons for the KISS album Creatures Of The Night; and he worked with Paul Stanley and Mikel Japp on \"Down On Your Knees\" for KISS Killers.\n\nThat led to credits on albums by Ted Nugent, Motley Crue and Krokus (who used a leftover from Reckless). But the recipients of Adams’ songs span a wide range of artists including Neil Diamond, Tina Turner, Bonnie Raitt, Loverboy, .38 Special, and Anne Murray.\n\nHe Loves A Good Duet\n\nBryan Adams' duets often appear on movie soundtracks and tend to do well. His Reckless collaboration with Tina Turner, \"It’s Only Love,\" was a Top 20 hit, peaking at No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. But things got bigger from there.\n\n\"All For Love,\" his song with Sting and Rod Stewart for the Three Musketeers film soundtrack (1993) went No. 1 in at least a dozen countries, selling nearly 2 million copies globally. He’s also duetted with Bonnie Raitt (\"Rock Steady\"), Barbra Streisand (\"I Finally Found Someone\" which went Top 10), and Melanie C from Spice Girls (\"When You’re Gone\"). He’s also recorded with Chicane, Pamela Anderson, Emmanuelle Seigner, Loverush UK, and Michael Bublé.\n\nIn recent years, Adams has said that he would like to duet with Beyonce and Lady Gaga. And in case you missed it, Taylor Swift once brought him onstage to perform \"Summer Of ‘69.\"\n\nThe Reckless Video Album Is A Story Of Unrequited Love\n\nWith its six videos slightly out of order from actual release, the Reckless video compilation (1984) charts a melancholy story. In \"This Time\" (the final video from Cuts Like A Knife), Adams is seeking out a woman in a desert town who's only shown with glimpses of her legs and heels. At the end, he finds her in the back of his van and they hook up — or is it just a mirage?\n\n\"Summer Of ‘69\" intercuts black and white footage of Adams and a young woman during their teen years with color images of their separate lives today. At the end, his old flame drives by with her current boyfriend who sees her eyeing the rocker, gets angry, and violently stops the car. In \"Somebody,\" she escapes the car as he screams at her, and then she and Adams wander in different locations as they recollect one another.\n\nIn \"Kids Wanna Rock,\" Adams jumps onstage for a high energy performance, while in \"Heaven,\" his old flame’s new guy has been pulled over for drunk driving, so she ditches him to see the Bryan Adams show conveniently happening across the street. He is unaware she is there, mesmerized by him.\n\nAfter he races off the stage he finds himself locked inside the venue with snow coming down outside. In \"Run To You,\" actually the album’s first single, Adams performs in wind and snow-swept environs and fantasizes about the same woman who finally walks up to him at the end. But they never embrace or kiss.\n\nHe’s An Acclaimed Photographer\n\nAdams has been taking photos for most of his life, but it’s no longer a hobby. — he has photographed everyone from rock stars to royalty, and even himself for his own album covers. He got a lot of good pointers about photography and darkroom work when the famed Anton Corbijn shot the cover for 1987’s Into The Fire.\n\nWhile Adams’ memorable portraits of people like Pink, Mick Jagger, Amy Winehouse, Rammstein, and yes, Queen Elizabeth II, he has also published books of portraits of homeless people, wounded war veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan, images of sand from the Island Of Mustique, and American women dressed in Calvin Klein. He uses proceeds from these books to benefit various charitable causes. He also shot the 2022 calendar for the Pirelli Tire Company to help them celebrate their 150th anniversary.\n\nThese days, Adams told Louder Sound that he is \"a photographer moonlighting as a singer.\"\n\nHe’s A Longtime Vegan & Animal Rights Advocate\n\nThe singer first became vegetarian at age 28 and later turned vegan, citing animal cruelty in the face of human food consumption. Adams has said that he gets an abundance of energy from his plant-based diet, noting he no longer gets sick.\n\nAdams has promoted his lifestyle to fans through positive posts, and he joins other famous musicians who are also vegan including Paul McCartney, Billie Eilish, and Stevie Wonder.\n\nHe Is Staunchly Committed To Humanitarian & Charitable Causes\n\nAdams has lent his voice and face to a variety of causes. It all started with his appearance at the Live Aid Festival in 1985, which raised many for Ethiopian famine relief. That was followed by the two-week Amnesty International A Conspiracy of Hope tour in 1986, the 1988 Peace Concert in East Berlin, and many others. From earthquake and tsunami relief to climate change to the Mideast peace process, he has been involved in many causes, and he is an LGBTQ ally as well.\n\nIn 2006, he co-founded the Bryan Adams Foundation with the goal of improving quality of life around the world via financial grants. Funds \"support specific projects that are committed to bettering the lives of other people. The Foundation seeks to protect the most vulnerable or disadvantaged individuals in society.\" A big goal is \"to advance education and learning opportunities for children and young people worldwide.\"\n\nHe Co-Wrote A Broadway Musical\n\nAdams is known for having hit songs from movies including Don Juan DeMarco, The Three Musketeers, The Mirror Has Two Faces, and Robin Hood, Prince Of Thieves. Some people might not know that he and Jim Vallance co-wrote the score to the Broadway adaptation of \"Pretty Woman,\" which ran for 420 performances over a year starting in August 2018. It is currently touring the UK and U.S.\n\nNone of the movie’s pop songs were used; the score was entirely theirs. And it turns out he and Vallance had to audition their work to producers. Adams told Billboard in 2016 that the duo crafted three songs and presented them to the producers, who responded with a \"don’t call us, we’ll call you\" approach. Thirty minutes later, Adams got the call.\n\nHe Tours Places Other Western Artists Don't Visit\n\nBryan Adams has performed in places other Western artists don't often visit. He has toured India several times; Adams first played Mumbai in the early ‘90s and was impressed with the loyalty of Indian audiences. He was reportedly the first Western artist to play Karachi, Pakistan after the Sept. 11 attacks, and toured in Syria and Lebanon in December 2010. He said Syria had a great audience and had never hosted a Western artist before.\n\nSongbook: A Guide To Stephen Sondheim's Essential Works & Classic Tributes\n\nIt's rare that a genre can be traced back to a single artist or group, but for funk, that was James Brown. The Godfather of Soul coined the phrase and style of playing known as \"on the one,\" where the first downbeat is emphasized, instead of the typical second and fourth beats in pop, soul and other styles. As David Cheal eloquently explains, playing on the one \"left space for phrases and riffs, often syncopated around the beat, creating an intricate, interlocking grid which could go on and on.\" You know a funky bassline when you hear it; its fat chords beg your body to get up and groove.\n\nBrown's 1965 classic, \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag,\" became one of the first funk hits, and has been endlessly sampled and covered over the years, along with his other groovy tracks. Of course, many other funk acts followed in the '60s, and the genre thrived in the '70s and '80s as the disco craze came and went, and the originators of hip-hop and house music created new music from funk and disco's strong, flexible bones built for dancing.\n\nLegendary funk bassist Bootsy Collins learned the power of the one from playing in Brown's band, and brought it to George Clinton, who created P-funk, an expansive, Afrofuturistic, psychedelic exploration of funk with his various bands and projects, including Parliament-Funkadelic. Both Collins and Clinton remain active and funkin', and have offered their timeless grooves to collabs with younger artists, including Kali Uchis, Silk Sonic, and Omar Apollo; and Kendrick Lamar, Flying Lotus, and Thundercat, respectively.\n\nIn the 1980s, electro-funk was born when artists like Afrika Bambaataa, Man Parrish, and Egyptian Lover began making futuristic beats with the Roland TR-808 drum machine — often with robotic vocals distorted through a talk box. A key distinguishing factor of electro-funk is a de-emphasis on vocals, with more phrases than choruses and verses. The sound influenced contemporaneous hip-hop, funk and electronica, along with acts around the globe, while current acts like Chromeo, DJ Stingray, and even Egyptian Lover himself keep electro-funk alive and well.\n\nToday, funk lives in many places, with its heavy bass and syncopated grooves finding way into many nooks and crannies of music. There's nu-disco and boogie funk, nodding back to disco bands with soaring vocals and dance floor-designed instrumentation. G-funk continues to influence Los Angeles hip-hop, with innovative artists like Dam-Funk and Channel Tres bringing the funk and G-funk, into electro territory. Funk and disco-centered '70s revival is definitely having a moment, with acts like Ghost Funk Orchestra and Parcels, while its sparkly sprinklings can be heard in pop from Dua Lipa, Doja Cat, and, in full \"Soul Train\" character, Silk Sonic. There are also acts making dreamy, atmospheric music with a solid dose of funk, such as Khruangbin’s global sonic collage.\n\nThere are many bands that play heavily with funk, creating lush grooves designed to get you moving. Read on for a taste of five current modern funk and nu-disco artists making band-led uptempo funk built for the dance floor. Be sure to press play on the Spotify playlist above, and check out GRAMMY.com's playlist on Apple Music, Amazon Music and Pandora.\n\nSay She She\n\nAptly self-described as \"discodelic soul,\" Brooklyn-based seven-piece Say She She make dreamy, operatic funk, led by singer-songwriters Nya Gazelle Brown, Piya Malik and Sabrina Mileo Cunningham. Their '70s girl group-inspired vocal harmonies echo, sooth and enchant as they cover poignant topics with feminist flair.\n\nWhile they’ve been active in the New York scene for a few years, they’ve gained wider acclaim for the irresistible music they began releasing this year, including their debut album, Prism. Their 2022 debut single \"Forget Me Not\" is an ode to ground-breaking New York art collective Guerilla Girls, and \"Norma\" is their protest anthem in response to the news that Roe vs. Wade could be (and was) overturned. The band name is a nod to funk legend Nile Rodgers, from the \"Le freak, c'est chi\" exclamation in Chic's legendary tune \"Le Freak.\"\n\nMoniquea\n\nMoniquea's unique voice oozes confidence, yet invites you in to dance with her to the super funky boogie rhythms. The Pasadena, California artist was raised on funk music; her mom was in a cover band that would play classics like Aretha Franklin’s \"Get It Right\" and Gladys Knight’s \"Love Overboard.\" Moniquea released her first boogie funk track at 20 and, in 2011, met local producer XL Middelton — a bonafide purveyor of funk. She's been a star artist on his MoFunk Records ever since, and they've collabed on countless tracks, channeling West Coast energy with a heavy dose of G-funk, sunny lyrics and upbeat, roller disco-ready rhythms.\n\nHer latest release is an upbeat nod to classic West Coast funk, produced by Middleton, and follows her February 2022 groovy, collab-filled album, On Repeat.\n\nShiro Schwarz\n\nShiro Schwarz is a Mexico City-based duo, consisting of Pammela Rojas and Rafael Marfil, who helped establish a modern funk scene in the richly creative Mexican metropolis. On \"Electrify\" — originally released in 2016 on Fat Beats Records and reissued in 2021 by MoFunk — Shiro Schwarz's vocals playfully contrast each other, floating over an insistent, upbeat bassline and an '80s throwback electro-funk rhythm with synth flourishes.\n\nTheir music manages to be both nostalgic and futuristic — and impossible to sit still to. 2021 single \"Be Kind\" is sweet, mellow and groovy, perfect chic lounge funk. Shiro Schwarz’s latest track, the joyfully nostalgic \"Hey DJ,\" is a collab with funkstress Saucy Lady and U-Key.\n\nL'Impératrice\n\nL'Impératrice (the empress in French) are a six-piece Parisian group serving an infectiously joyful blend of French pop, nu-disco, funk and psychedelia. Flore Benguigui's vocals are light and dreamy, yet commanding of your attention, while lyrics have a feminist touch.\n\nDuring their energetic live sets, L'Impératrice members Charles de Boisseguin and Hagni Gwon (keys), David Gaugué (bass), Achille Trocellier (guitar), and Tom Daveau (drums) deliver extended instrumental jam sessions to expand and connect their music. Gaugué emphasizes the thick funky bass, and Benguigui jumps around the stage while sounding like an angel. L’Impératrice’s latest album, 2021’s Tako Tsubo, is a sunny, playful French disco journey.\n\nFranc Moody\n\nFranc Moody's bio fittingly describes their music as \"a soul funk and cosmic disco sound.\" The London outfit was birthed by friends Ned Franc and Jon Moody in the early 2010s, when they were living together and throwing parties in North London's warehouse scene. In 2017, the group grew to six members, including singer and multi-instrumentalist Amber-Simone.\n\nTheir music feels at home with other electro-pop bands like fellow Londoners Jungle and Aussie act Parcels. While much of it is upbeat and euphoric, Franc Moody also dips into the more chilled, dreamy realm, such as the vibey, sultry title track from their recently released Into the Ether.\n\nThe Rise Of Underground House: How Artists Like Fisher & Acraze Have Taken Tech House, Other Electronic Genres From Indie To EDC"
