        "text": "How old is Rod Stewart and where is he from?\n\nRod Stewart was born on January 10, 1945.\n\nHe celebrated his 77th birthday in 2022.\n\nBorn Roderick David Stewart in Highgate, North London, Rod was the youngest of five children.\n\nQUIZ: How well do you know Rod Stewart?\n\nHis parents were Robert Joseph Stewart (1904–1990) and Elsie Rebecca Gilbart (1906–1996). His father was Scottish and had been a master builder in Leith, while Elsie was English and had grown up in Upper Holloway in North London.\n\nThey married in 1928, and had two sons and two daughters while living in Scotland, and then moved to Highgate. Rod arrived eight years after his youngest sibling during World War II. He was spoiled as the youngest, and has described his childhood as \"fantastically happy\".\n\nWho is Rod Stewart's wife?\n\nRod Stewart was first married to actress and model Alana Hamilton, the former wife of actor George Hamilton, from 1979 to 1984.\n\nRod Stewart poses with wife Penny Lancaster and his three exes at daughter's 40th birthday\n\nHe then married model Rachel Hunter - who later dated Robbie Williams - from 1990 to 2006. Hunter was 21 and Rod was 45 at the time of their wedding, before separating in 1999.\n\nHe married model Penny Lancaster in 2007, and have been together since 1999.\n\nHow many children does Rod Stewart have?\n\nIn total, Rod has eight children.\n\nHis first child was Sarah Streeter, born to his art student girlfriend Susannah Boffey in 1963. Sarah was later adopted by other parents.\n\nRod Stewart is joined by all four sons, aged from 7 to 38, in a rare family photo\n\nHe had two children with his first wife Alana - Kimberly Stewart in 1979 and Sean Stewart in 1980. Kimberly is now a fashion designer, socialite and model, and has a child (Delilah, Rod's first grandchild) with actor Benicio del Toro. Sean is best known for being a reality TV star.\n\nRod then had a child with model Kelly Emberg, whom he was with from 1983 to 1990. Ruby Stewart was born in 1987, and is a fashion model and singer.\n\nHe had two children with second wife Rachel - Renée Stewart in 1992 and Liam Stewart in 1994. Liam played major junior ice hockey with the Spokane Chiefs and currently plays with the Guildford Flames.\n\nHe also has two children with current wife Penny - Alastair Stewart in 2005 and Aiden Stewart in 2011.\n\nHow many albums has Rod Stewart released?\n\nRod Stewart has released 29 solo studio albums.\n\nHis debut was 1969's An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down, and his most recent was 2015's Another Country.\n\nHis most recent regular release was his 30th album Blood Red Roses in 2018, and he scored a number one album with his collection of orchestral versions of his classic songs on You're In My Heart.\n\nWhat is Rod Stewart's net worth?\n\nRod Stewart has an estimated net worth of around £179 million ($235m), according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nWas Rod Stewart a footballer?\n\nEncouraged by his father, Rod's ambition was to become a professional footballer. In summer 1960, he had trials at Brentford FC, a Third Division club at the time.\n\nRod Stewart's 7-year-old son is already amazing at football\n\nRod says in his 2012 autobiography that he never signed to the club and that the club never called him back. He said: \"Well, a musician's life is a lot easier and I can also get drunk and make music, and I can't do that and play football. I plumped for music. They're the only two things I can do actually: play football and sing.\"\n\nWhat did Rod Stewart do before becoming a singer?\n\nRod left school at 15 and worked briefly as a silk screen printer.\n\nHe worked in the family shop and as a newspaper delivery boy, and then briefly as a labourer for Highgate Cemetery. He worked in a North Finchley funeral parlour and as a fence erector and sign writer.\n\nDid he perform the largest concert ever?\n\nAccording to official records, yes!\n\nIn 1994, Rod staged the largest free rock concert in history when he performed in front of over 4 million people in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe Guinness World Records state: \"A free concert staged by rock superstar Rod Stewart at Copacabana Beach, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on New Year’s Eve 1994 reportedly attracted an audience of 4.2 million, although this figure is believed to include those who turned up solely for the fireworks display at midnight.\n\nIs he really into model railways?\n\nOh, yes.\n\nRod is a known model railway enthusiast. He has a 23 × 124 foot HO scale layout in his Los Angeles home, modelled after the New York Central and the Pennsylvania Railroads during the 1940s.\n\nRod Stewart donates £10k to model railway club after vandals destroy life's work\n\nRod told Model Railroader magazine that it meant more to him to be in a model railroad magazine than a music magazine."
