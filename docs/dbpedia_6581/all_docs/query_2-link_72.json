Transform your boutique hotel with luxury interiors and watch your business thrive. #HospitalityIndustry #BoutiqueHotel #LuxuryDesign #GuestSatisfaction #HotelRevenue --\n\nHIDDEN GUEST: Aquahouse Hotel & Spa Aquahouse Hotel & Spa is an appealing and elegant hotel whose creators and architects ensured the architecture will remain timeless. The minimalist interior is equally impressive and typical of modern design hotels. Put together, the hotel feels impressively inviting and, more importantly, guest-friendly and well-thought-out. The hotel can stand toe-to-toe with the best meeting hotels in our comparison. Its thermal spa offer makes it a likely contender for the top spot. In addition, the hotel’s conference offer makes it perfect for all types of events. We believe incentive events suit it best. The value for money is particularly impressive. Given the Ultra All Inclusive concept, the price is surprisingly affordable, although still high for Bulgarian standards. Guests seeking world-class quality for a reasonable price should put this hotel on their list. Aquahouse Hotel & Spa has filled the gap in the Bulgarian coastal meetings offer.

Its design does not scream grand hauteur but quietly exudes elegant confidence. The interior mimics a minimalist Alpine style. With a refined interior, the ambience can be labelled traditional comfort. All materials are superb, and with an abundance of space, staying in this hotel is a delight. The hotel’s cuisine and additional offerings befit the hotel’s image of a well-designed boutique hotel. Only the personnel seems to lack a hand here and there. Should you organise a team building, a corporate educational seminar or if you want to reward coworkers in the region, this hotel is ideal. Incentive boutique hotels like this can cater to any such event. Zeitwert is an exemplary representative of hotels where modernity crosses paths with tradition. It may need a few tweaks, yet its price outweighs the decision. Compared to hotels in Graz, staying here is a no-brainer ...
