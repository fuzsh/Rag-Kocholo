        "text": "Rod Stewart is mourning the loss of one of his brothers just months after losing another brother.\n\nStewart shared via social media, “It’s with great sadness that I announce the loss of my brother Bob last night, who joins my brother Don on the great football pitch in the sky. I’ve lost two of my best mates in the space of two months. RIP Don and Bob ‘irreplaceable buddies.’”\n\nStewart is the youngest of five siblings, which include his two surviving sisters, Peggy and Mary. When his brother, Don, died in September, it came just two days before the passing of Queen Elizabeth II. At the time, Stewart issued a statement saying, in part, “It has been a devastating 48 hours. We lost my brother Don on Tuesday at 94 and today we have all lost Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II at 96.\n\nWe send our condolences to Stewart and his entire family during this difficult time.\n\nRod Stewart: Classic Images\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
