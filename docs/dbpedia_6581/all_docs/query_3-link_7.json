        "text": "During a period when first touring in the United States, where rowdy Stewart and his band were prohibited from staying in some hotels, the band used to masquerade as Fleetwood Mac in order acquire accommodation.\n\nAlthough he was born in England and has English blood on his mother's side, he has Scottish blood on his father's side and prefers to be considered a Scotsman. He is an avid supporter of Glasgow Celtic Football Club and the Scotland national team.\n\nA lifelong collector of model trains, Stewart maintains an elaborate outlay in an upstairs room of his Los Angeles home that stretches the length of his house. Bases his layout scale on the 1940s New York Central and Pennsylvania line.\n\nWhen then-girlfriend Britt Ekland discovered that Stewart was seeing other women, she filed a $12.5 million palimony suit, claiming that, as she had given up much of her career for him, she deserved a large portion of his income. The lawsuit was dismissed.\n\nIn an early stage of The Kinks, before future frontman Ray Davies was willing to be the lead singer, they recruited Stewart (who grew up in the same neighborhood as the Davies brothers) as a singer. After a couple of weeks of trying to be a band, Stewart and the future Kinks found that they did not get along that well, with their musical tastes being too different, and parted ways.\n\nContrary to popular belief, he was never a professional soccer player with Brentford Football Club before becoming a musician, this was one of many stories invented by his publicist when Rod was starting to hit the big time. Rod was successfully sued by Brazilian singer Jorge Ben Jor who claimed the tune to Rod's \"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?\" was too similar to his song \"Taj Mahal\". Ben won the lawsuit and asked Rod to donate all his profits from the song to UNICEF.\n\nHe has eight children: Sarah Thubron Streeter (born 6 November 1963) born to art student Susannah Boffey; Kimberly Stewart (born 20 August 1979) and Sean Stewart (born 1 September 1980) born to Alana Stewart (ex-wife of actor George Hamilton); Ruby Stewart (born 17 June 1987), born to Kelly Emberg, his girlfriend at the time; Renee Stewart (born 1 June 1992) and Liam McAlister Stewart (born 4 September 1994), born to ex-wife Rachel Hunter, a model; Alistair Wallace Stewart (born 27 November 2005) and Aiden Stewart (born 16 February 2011), born to wife Penny Lancaster, all of Clan Stuart.\n\nHe was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 for his solo career and in 2012 as part of The Faces.\n\nWhen asked what he had like to have as his epitaph on Episode dated 30 March 2011 (2011), Stewart quipped, \"I'm a celebrity, get me out of here.\".\n\nHe was discovered busking in a train station in the early 1960s by British blues pioneer Long John Baldry. Baldry was so impressed with Stewart's vocal prowess, he invited him to join his band, The Hoochie Coochie Men. Stewart has often admitted in interviews that he owes his great success to that chance meeting with Baldry.\n\nHe was the original lead singer of the The Jeff Beck Group. However, when the band was scheduled to appear at Woodstock he quit on the eve of the show due to the fact that his best friend Ronnie Wood, who was playing bass at the time, was kicked out.\n\nOn March 9, 2005, he proposed to girlfriend Penny Lancaster at the top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. They married according to their plan, on board his yacht \"Lady Anne MaGee\" in the Portofino harbor, Italy, after his divorce from Rachel Hunter was finalized.\n\nOver his career Stewart has been Grammy-nominated 15 times (thru 2018) and won just once for \"Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album - Stardust: The Great American Songbook, Volume III\" (2004). Ironically for a rock 'n' roll artist, his only win was for an album of classic songs by such distinguished composers as, George Gershwin & Ira Gershwin, Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers & Lorenz Hart, Hoagy Carmichael, Oscar Hammerstein II, etc.\n\nThe Scottish rock singer Fish cites Stewart as the spark to launching his own music career. He was quoted: \"I saw Rod Stewart and the Faces on telly. Rod was obviously pissed and having a fantastic time. I thought: 'That's something I could do.' So that was my dream, singing along to the mirror in my bedroom\".\n\nHe has remained close to fellow Seventies and Eighties pop superstar Elton John and gave him the nickname \"Sharon\". In 1991, he recorded a cover of John's first UK chart hit, \"Your Song\", for the all-star tribute album \"Two Rooms\". John has described Stewart as \"the best singer I've heard in rock 'n' roll\".\n\nHe was the first artist to record the Burt Bacharach and Carole Bayer Sager song \"That's What Friends Are For\" (for the movie Nightshift - Das Leichenhaus flippt völlig aus (1982)), four years before it became a number one hit for Dionne Warwick, Elton John, Gladys Knight and Stevie Wonder.\n\nHe was the fifth and youngest child of Robert Joseph Stewart of Clan Stuart (b. Scotland, Great-Britain and Ireland, 26 December 1904, d. 1990), master builder in Leith, Edinburgh, Scotland, Great-Britain and Northern-Ireland, and wife (m. 1928) Elsa \"Elsie\" Rebecca Gilbart (b. England, Great-Britain and Ireland, 14 December 1905, d. 1996), who grew up in Upper Holloway, North London, London, Middlesex, England, Great-Britain and Ireland) who lived in Scotland, Great-Britain and Northern-Ireland, and in Highgate, North London, London, Middlesex, England, Great-Britain and Northern-Ireland."
