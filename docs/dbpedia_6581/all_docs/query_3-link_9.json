        "text": "Canadian actor\n\nRob Stewart (born 23 July 1961) is a Canadian actor, known for the lead role of Nick Slaughter in the action-comedy television series Tropical Heat, and his recurring roles as Roan in Nikita and Khlyen in Killjoys.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nStewart was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada,[1] He was raised in Bramalea, a neighbourhood in Brampton, Ontario. He enjoyed playing hockey and dreamt of becoming a professional. At the age of 17, he sustained an injury that caused him to lose a kidney and subsequently turn down a number of athletic scholarships that had been offered to him.[2]\n\nHe enrolled at the University of Waterloo where he majored in Latin and English.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nIn order to put himself through university, he sang and played the guitar at local restaurants.[2] In the summers, he performed stunts and acrobatics at Canada's Wonderland amusement park.[citation needed]\n\nThroughout his career he has guest-starred in numerous television roles. One of his early notable roles was Nick Slaughter on Tropical Heat.[3] Stewart was one of the leads in the television show Peter Benchley's Amazon.[4] In 2007 he began playing the male lead in Painkiller Jane that ran for 22 episodes on the Sci Fi Channel.[2]\n\nStewart played a major recurring character, Roan, in the CW hit action television series Nikita for its first two seasons.[5] Towards the end of his run on Nikita he also had a minor role of an alcoholic movie producer over a few episodes of the Canadian series The L.A. Complex that depicts the lives of young Canadian actors struggling for work in Los Angeles.[6] This was followed by an appearance in two episodes of the long-running CBC Television series Heartland.[7]\n\nAiring on the CW, he appeared in six episodes of Beauty & the Beast as the character Mr. Chandler.[8] Soon after, Stewart appeared in an episode of the Syfy television series Defiance which was shot in his hometown Toronto, followed by another one-episode role – this time on the Canadian series Cracked.\n\nIn 2013, the documentary Slaughter Nick for President was released.[3] The film follows Stewart on his 2009 trip to Serbia, where Tropical Heat achieved notable popularity in the 1990s.[9] The same year, he was cast in Suits as corporate raider Tony Gionopoulos, appearing in five episodes.[10]\n\nFrom 2015 to 2019, Stewart played Khlyen, a significant recurring character in Killjoys.[11]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nStewart met his wife Celiana Stewart during the first season of Tropical Heat.
