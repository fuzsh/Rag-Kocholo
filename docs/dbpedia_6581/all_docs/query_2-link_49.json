St. Louis Hockey Club, L.P. was a personal injury case filed on March 17, 1998, in which the plaintiff claimed that the defendant club should be held vicariously liable for their employee’s actions that caused the plaintiff’s injury. The injury in question occurred in Peoria, Illinois during an IHL game on December 15, 1990 between the Peoria Rivermen and the Milwaukee Admirals. While the St. Louis Hockey Club technically wasn’t playing in the game, they can be held liable for the injury, as the Peoria Rivermen are a subsidiary of the club. During the third period of said game, the defendant, Stephen McKichan, a goalie for the Admirals, was both injured and rend unconscious by a body-check from a Peoria player. This body-check occurred after play was stopped due to the hockey puck floating out-of-bounds.

Training, practicing, motivation and pushing themselves to get better is what all these players put the hours into for that moment. After battling 82 games for a playoff spot, then continuing to win 4 playoff rounds, of best of seven series, they finally get to have the moment they’ve all been working and dreaming for as a kid. To raise the Cup, kiss it, scream, and then pass it to your fellow teammate. But that’s not why they do it.
