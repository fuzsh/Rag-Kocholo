        "text": "When an infant is born preterm or in need of neonatal care, the parents are usually separated from their infants directly after birth. The enforced parent-infant separation can lead to parents feeling disconnected from their infant. The University Hospital of Ghent has been performing the Concord Birth Flow since December 2023. Since then, they have experienced that, even with (complex) technological support, they can support physical and emotional closeness between baby and mother directly after birth.\n\nThe Medical University in Vienna has been performing the Concord Birth Flow since the spring of 2023. In this Concord Talk, Dr. Klebermass will share with you the considerations for adopting the Concord Birth Flow at her hospital, the best practices and key learnings gained with her team during this implementation process, and their first-hand clinical experience using the Concord Birth Trolley.\n\nAn impactful study has recenlty been published in The Lancet, confirming that waiting with clamping the umbilical cord for longer periods (>2 minutes until after the lungs are aerated) is likely to lead to a large reduction in death in preterm infants. This is concluded by the iCOMP collaboration after comparing individual patient data from 6094 preterm infants out of 47 randomized trials. In this Concord Talk, Prof. Stuart Hooper will present the results in more detail and there will be time for discussion and sharing thoughs with colleagues worldwide.\n\nIn this Concord Talk, Dr. Stein is sharing the experience of her team in implementing the Concord Birth Flow. Specifically she will share their experience in performing PBCC in cases that some other hospitals have defined as contra-indications, for example placenta praevia and multiples (twins and tripplets). The experience of UK Essen triggers an interesting discussion regarding what the actual contra-indications of Physiological-Based Cord Clamping are. We invite you to actively contribute to exchange knowledge and experience.\n\nUK Bonn has implemented the Concord Birth Flow & Trolley since March 2021, focussing its use on neonates with severe congenital lung and airway malformations. In this Concord Talk Dr. Florian Kipmüller will share the science and his experience in optimizing this more complex delivery workflow with an intact cord, including exit procedures, intubation etc.\n\nIn this Concord Talk, Dr. Kleinhout and Dr. Kooijman will share their experience on the implementation and the use of the three Concord Birth Trolley's at the St. Antonius Hospital in The Netherlands. The first hospital with a level 2 neonatal care unit worldwide to implement the Concord Birth Flow. Dr. Kleinhout and Dr. Kooijman will be sharing their considerations and motivations for adopting the Concord Birth Flow, the key learnings gained with their team during the implementation process,and today's clinical experience using the Concord Birth Trolley.\n\nThe implementation of Physiological-Based Cord Clamping / Intact Cord Stabilization involves changes in workflow for multidisciplinary teams. Additionally equipment and workplace decisions need to be made considering available room infrastructure. In this Talk, Bjorn Valentijn will share his experience of implementing the Concord Birth Flow in over 35 hospitals in 8 countries in Europe and provide guidance on things to consider before implementing the Concord Birth Flow.\n\nLearn about ideas innovating the Future of Neonatal Care. In this Concord Talk Prof. Mario Rüdiger will be speaking on “The cord is key: Why and how to perform Physiological-Based Cord Clamping” and Dr. Tim Antonius, who will be speaking about “How can technology help a baby to get the best start possible”.\n\nAfter implementing Physiological-Based Cord Clamping one year ago, Sint-Augustinus hospital will be presenting their first outcome data. Dr. Ilse van Horebeek is presenting their experience with implementing the Concord Birth Flow, what is achieved during the past year and how this translates in their first outcome data.\n\nIn this Concord Talk, three Concord Community members will share their knowledge and experience and discuss remarkable case studies:\n\nDr. Silke Brodkorb, München Klink: Neonate with hydrops\n\nDr. Neirude Lissone, Maastricht UMC: Preterm neonate with a chylothorax\n\nDr. Katharina Schwendener-Scholl, Luzerner Kantonsspital: Term neonate with a large cyctic CPAM\n\nEach of the speaker will be discussing the specific case, how the team prepared, discuss the workflow and lessons learned. There will be plenty of time for questions and discussions.\n\nNurturescience is derived out of the latest insights in developmental neuroscience. In this Concord Talk, Dr. Bergman wil clarify and present the key aspects that constitute nurturescience, followed by the science behind Zero Separation and the adverse consequences of maternal-infant separation.\n\nIn this meeting our three experts will discuss and answer many of the frequently asked questions on physiological-based cord clamping and intact cord resuscitation. There will be a full hour of discussion, allowing you to ask any question you have on this topic.\n\nIn this Concord Talk, prof. Mercer will share her latest insights on optimal cord management at the time of birth, focusing on what the cord blood offers to the newborn and how the placenta helps the newborn adjust to life after birth when there is a long wait to clamp the cord.\n\nIn this Concord Talk, Dr. Körner will share with you his considerations and motivations for adopting the Concord Birth Flow, the key learnings he gained with his team in the implementation process, and of course his first-hand clinical experience using the Concord Birth Trolly.\n\nWhy is it important to wait with clamping the umbilical cord until the baby is breathing? And can this be done in clinical practice? Prof. Mario Rüdiger and Dr. Cahit Birdir will explain the physiology of umbilical cord management and the benefits of Physiological-Based Cord Clamping from the perspective of neonatology and obstetrics. They will share their experience of implementing and performing Physiological-Based Cord Clamping as a team, at the Center for Fetal Neonatal Health in Dresden.\n\nIn this Concord Talk, Dr. Nina Höller, Prof. Berndt Urlesberger and the neonatology team from the University Hospital Graz will be sharing why and how they have implemented Physiological-Based Cord Clamping with the Concord Birth Trolley, and how they are performing 1.5 years after implementation, including practical aspects, experiences and key learnings.\n\nMore and more studies on the procedure of Intact Cord Resuscitation emerge. In this Talk, Dr. Ola Andersson will discuss whether we are sure enough of the positive effects to start implementing the procedure in term infants, or if, and what more could be needed.\n\nDuring this Concord Talk, Ronny Knol will educate us on the practical aspects how to aerate the lungs and stabilize the baby before clamping the umbilical cord, in accordance with ERC NLS 2021, and he will share feedback from involved caregivers and parents. Special guest, Bram Dees, will share his experience as a parent of the birth of his daughter Lara, who was supported on the Concord Birth Trolley at Erasmus MC."
