        "meta_description": "Doreen Jean Stewart, 80, passed away December 1, 2023. She was born in Brokenhead, Manitoba, January 13, 1943. She was a beloved wife, mother and grandmother, who dedicated her life to supporting her family.  She is survived by her husband, James Stewart; son, Rod Stewart and daughters, Michele and Carole Stewart; grandchildren, Logan Green (Jocelyn), Oliver, and Sarah Stewart-Totten, as well, her brothers in Manitoba, Norman, Donald, Kenny, James, Eddie and foster-brother, Mark Horsfall, and a vast amount of family and friends all across Canada.  Jean was predeceased by her parents, Lydia (nee Freund) and Fred Fiebelkorn; brothers, Elmer, Ronald, Clifford; sister, Joyce, and son-in-law, Tom Totten.  Jim and Jean met in Winnipeg while Jim was serving in the Canadian Military. They embarked on a lifelong journey together navigating the challenges and joys of military life and enjoyed sixty years of love and devotion. As a military wife, Jean demonstrated unwavering strength, resilience, and adaptability supporting her husband’s career and raising a family. Her sense of stability and comfort was truly remarkable. We lived in 22 homes in five different provinces and over seas. Regardless of the number of postings, she proudly transformed each place, making them into warm and loving homes.   She guided herself through life with grace and dignity, and she was always a source of inspiration and encouragement to her loved ones. With her kind and generous heart, she was an extraordinary role model, which created a legacy of strength to inspire all. Jean never hesitated to volunteer or lend a hand with anyone or any organization. She was a team leader who volunteered for the Heart and Stroke Foundation for over a decade. She recruited volunteers and also canvassed door to door in the Debert and surrounding area. She also volunteered for the Poppy Campaign.   Her family would like to extend deep thanks to the quiet heroes in our community - the first responders, volunteers, and staff at Colchester East Hants Health Centre.  In lieu of flowers, donations in Jean’s memory may be made to the Heart and Stroke Foundation.  A celebration of Jean’s life will be held on December 16th from 1-4pm in The Peg, Masstown, NS. Marty Clark-Ettinger officiating. Jean’s interment will take place in the summer of 2024 in Manitoba where her family will bring her to rest with her parents.",
