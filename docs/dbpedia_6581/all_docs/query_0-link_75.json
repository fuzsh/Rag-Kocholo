        "text": "The big cities of the east took notice of the hockey being played here and in Madison Square Garden sent Connie Smythe to Duluth to see what was going on. Connie liked what he saw, returned to New York and the New York Rangers were organized, taking Ching Johnson, Taffy Abel and Billie Boyd from the Minneapolis club as his nucleus.\n\nGus Olson will be remembered by old time hockey fans and sports writer as one of the best of the American born hockey players. He played rover in the days of seven men hockey and when the game was changed to six men he played mostly at right wing, but was powerful enough to play defense and often did. Always one of the leading scorers, he was especially noted for his clever stick work and great back checking ability which earned him the nickname of the ‘pest’. At the end of the 1919-1920 season, Gus joined the St. Paul Club to play Pittsburgh for the championship of the United States. That first year the first U.S. Olympic ten was to represent America in the [Summer] Olympic games in 1920. Four players were picked from Pittsburgh, four from Boston and four from St. Paul. In 1924, Gus was picked on the Olympic team, but was forced to turn the invitation down due to business and the fact that he was in charge of the Duluth Hornets.\n\nHe retired from playing pro hockey in 1928 on account of pressures of managing the Amphitheater and the Hockey Club. However, he still did a lot of practicing and occasionally played with the famous West End Amateur Club. The Duluth Curling Club, with a seating capacity of 1800, was the home rink at the start, but with the coming of players like Mike Goodman, Herbie Lewis, Leo LaFrance, Burr Williams, Jim Seaborn, Moose Jamieson and numerous others, all the pick of the best players an Canada, the rink proved entirely to for the crowds. In the summer of 1924, Gordon Hegardt arranged for the construction of a new rink and completed the deal, only on the condition that Gus Olson would take over the management of the rink, which he agreed to do. On December 4, 1924, the Amphitheater was opened, being the first artificial ice rink built primarily for hockey In the U.S. With an ice surface of 90 feet by 215 feet and a seating capacity of 5000, it was considered by everyone as an ideal hockey rink. This fine building with its splendid accommodations had a terrific impact and influence on the growth of hockey and other ice activities. As manager, Gus helped organize teams at Central High, Cathedral High, State Teachers College (UMD), Duluth Junior College and numerous amateur leagues. At the time the Amphitheater was built there were only two or three amateur leagues in the city. This total grew to something over fifty in a few years. All these high school and college teams received free ice time and also played their games at the Amphitheater free. The Amphitheater also paid most of the expenses for the high school and college teams, giving them bus trips away from home, etc. In 1938, Gus brought a team of Old Timers to Duluth to play the Duluth Firemen, a team composed of the best amateurs in town. The Old Timers, with players like Ching Johnson, Moose Goheen, Perk Galbraith, Moose Jamieson, Jim Seaborn , Laurie Scott, Leo LaFrance, Carl Bergl, Iver Anderson, Gus Olson, and several others who had been out of hockey for over ten years or more, but when they scored 6 goals in the first period, there was no question of their class. Gus was a member of the hockey \"Hole in One\" scoring a goal from face off, beating Cleveland 1-0 in 1925. In 1922, the Duluth Hornets beat the Winnipeg Nationals 6-0, with Gus getting all six goals (a double hat-trick).\n\nGus had the Spaulding Company make the first hockey pants with the padding over the back and kidneys in addition to the hips and thighs. He was instrumental in getting the late Gordon Hegardt to open one of the first hockey stick factories in the U.S. This factory wag located on Polk Street in West Duluth and sticks were sold to practically every hockey club in the U.S. Gus played his last game of hockey at the age of 60, playing 60 minutes in a benefit game with other old timers to raise funds for a kids team. He had continued his interest in hockey to his death in the Zenith City, being always available for hockey promotions and was an activist in building todays' Duluth DECC Arena long before construction began on the formidable arena.\n\nPART I\n\nHISTORY OF AMATEUR AND PROFESSIONAL HOCKEY IN DULUTH FROM THE 1900 's to 1934\n\nIn Scotland it is called ‘shinty’, and in Ireland ‘hurley’ but in Duluth it goes by the name of ‘ice hockey’. Although we have not been represented in any organized leagues in the last few years. Duluth still clings to its enviable reputation as one of the leading ice hockey centers of America and has often been called the home of hockey.\n\nThe hockey teams of Duluth have flaunted the banners of this city far and wide, from Canada to the Gulf and from New York to Los Angeles. Perhaps no single athletic organization in the Northwest can lay claim to having brought more credit to its home city, particularly the buzzing Hornets in the years 1919 through 1932.\n\nThe development of modern ice hockey in America can be traced to the Victoria hockey Club and McGill University in Montreal. The secretary or the former club made the first efforts toward drawing up a recognized code of laws, and for some time afterwards playing rules were agreed upon from time to time whenever an important match was played.\n\nNORTHERN HARDWARE TEAM FIRST\n\nKid rinks sprang into popularity in Duluth as early as 1900 and were mostly played at first on the bay ice in subzero weather. The writer can remember cleaning off a place to play in one of the Scott-Graff slips between the lumber piles with the temperature 35 below zero. Some folks called it ‘shinny’ in the early days but it soon outgrew that name in Duluth.\n\nProbably the first hockey team in Duluth that made a national reputation was the Northern Hardware Club in the years of 1906-1907. This team had such stars as Roy Deetz, Ray Fenton, Ed Furni, Charlie Horn, Coddy Winters, Earl and Al Cummings, Charlie Cargill and others and all were local boys.\n\nThis team won the amateur championship of the U.S. and played teams in the Copper country, Detroit and Cleveland. Coddy Winters went from here to Cleveland and under his leadership Cleve land went on to take a leading place in the hockey world. At the same time Andy Grenner had the Columbia team in Superior with many excellent players. From then until 1913 Duluth had a number of local hockey leagues with the games being played at the old Curling Club, Lincoln Park, French rink, Twenty-fifth Avenue West, Second Street and the Adams rink on the bay. The accomplishments of the Adams Athletic Club during this period deserves mention.\n\nThis club was formed in the West End and for a number of years was represented in every branch of sport including; hockey, baseball, football, bowling, indoor and outdoor baseball. They built their own on the ice at the foot of Twenty-first Avenue West – where the league played most of its games. Every one of their teams was outstanding and if this city could get four clubs organized as this one was, to take part in all sports, we would never have to worry about bringing in players for the various teams.\n\nSt. Paul had the prize of them all. Their games were played at the Hippodrome Ice Rink, one of the State Fair Buildings converted to hockey and skating for the winter. The natural ice surface was 270 x 119 ft., with the nets set out from each end about 35 feet. (Players had to be in shape; the early rules called for 30-minute halves; with no substitutions). We nicknamed the Hipp the ‘Wiedenborners Forty Acres’ after the manager of the St. Paul Club.\n\nThe rules of hockey have seen many changes. Originally the team was composed of seven players, a goalie, point, cover point, center, left and right wing and a rover. The cover point played in front of the point, who was directly in front of the goalie, and the rover played on the forward line, backing up the three forwards. About 1916-17 the lineup was changed to six men, a goalie, left and right defenses and the three forwards. This was a big improvement, as it made for more open hockey with two less players on the ice. Oftentimes I thought this was a great deal too many, the way I was checked. This is the same lineup being used today and seems to be satisfactory.\n\nUnder the seven-man lineup, forward passing was prohibited. Passes had to be made straight across the ice, which was later changed to permit the puck to be passed forward, but the player taking the puck had to be even or ‘on-side’ when the puck was passed. This sped up the game a little and later the first blue line appeared. This was 20 feet out from the goal line and permitted the defending team to pass from its end of the rink up to the blue line, but from there on it had to be played ‘on side’. About 1927 the blue lines were moved out 60 feet from the goal mouth and forward passing was permitted in each of the three zones between the different blue lines. Two or three years ago the red was added to the others, being put in the center of the rink permitting the defending team to pass from its end of the rink up to the red line. If a defending player was over his own blue line, he had to touch the puck before it crossed the red line, but if he was behind his own blue line when the puck was passed-out he was permitted to take the puck past the red line.\n\nThese rules were in effect last season and this last rule caused much argument between the players and confusion for the fans. The National League now is talking of eliminating the red line and permitting forward passing almost the length of the ice. I feel this would be a bad rule. The penalty lines also have been added in the later years, being placed 30 feet out from the goal mouths.\n\nWe used to play 30-minute halves in the old days, with no substitutions permitted. The players that started the game had to finish, and if a player was hurt so he could not continue, the opposing team had to drop a man to equalize the teams. That called for condition, and I certainly agree with Joe Gallop when he criticizes the present crop of boxers for not doing more conditioning. This also goes for hockey players, and I might say double. I can remember when we used to start active training around the first of September, working out at the YMCA at least three nights a week, running from the Y out to Thirtieth Avenue East and back each night. This was quite a grind and I recall that one night I was so tired on the way back that I turned in at the YWCA by mistake. In addition, we played baseball all summer and the boy who smoked was an exception.\n\nWe had some tough road trips in the early days. The year Milwaukee was in the league we did not have any too many players and on one trip we were to go to the Copper country for some exhibition games after playing Milwaukee. We left Milwaukee at 5:30 p.m. For the Canadian Soo, where we were to play Monday and Tuesday nights. Our train was to make connections with a diner Monday morning between Milwaukee and the Soo, but due to a snow storm missed connections and as a result, we did not get anything to eat until we reached the Soo Monday at 6 p.m.\n\nThen as we had missed the regular train across the straits we climbed into a caboose and put our trunks on the back of the engine. We arrived at the Soo and started our game about 10 o’clock. We played again Tuesday night and after the game rented two toboggans and hauled our trunks across the ice as we had to catch a train out of the American Soo at 5:30 a.m. for Marquette, where we were booked for Wednesday night. We ran into more snow and did not get our game under way that night until after 10 p.m. Then we sat up until 4 a.m. to take the train back to Duluth where we were playing a team from Winnipeg on Thursday and Friday night. That was five games in five nights with all the traveling thrown in. Incidentally, we won four of the five games and if I remember right, we only had one or two spares for this series. We had many colorful players in these years of hockey and we combed Canada from one end to the other for them. We had representatives in almost every important hockey center in Canada. For instance, Jack Leswick was splaying with the Drumheller Club in the Alberta league when I first noticed the nice write-ups he was getting in one of the Calgary papers. I contacted our party in Calgary and was advised that he was a good prospect. I got in touch with, offered him a contract of $1,200 to finish the season (one month) with us and $3,000 for the following year. He accepted and after I had forwarded transportation and expense money, he decided that he would go to Seattle instead. I found out in time and managed to get him on long distance at the railroad station in Calgary just before he was to leave and explained to him that as long as he had accepted terms from us, that he would have to play with Duluth. He changed his mind, came to Duluth and although Lloyd Turner in Seattle put in a claim to the National League for Jack, President Calder upheld us and awarded him to Duluth. Jack turned out to be one of the greatest stick handlers that this town or any other town has ever seen but if he turned out to be a dud, we would have been out $4,200.\n\nWe got the great Tiny Thompson under strange circumstances. The Calgary Canadians’ Junior team of 1923-24 had two outstanding players in Herbie Lewis and Johnny Loucks and after considerable dickering finally convinced Herbie that Duluth was the place for him. Johnny Loucks also was willing to come, but he said he had a friend goaltender playing for Coleman, Alberta, he wanted to bring with him. We told him to bring the goalie and Johnny arrived in town with a tall slim kid named Tiny Thompson.\n\nThe old master of them all, the one and only, the Muskoko Moose - Clarence Barclay ‘Moose’ Jamieson [who] came to Duluth from Cleveland. Clarence was very much out of favor with the Duluth fans when we brought him here due to the fact that Mike Goodman had been treated pretty rough by Cleveland the season before. Mike almost lost the sight of one eye in a mix-up and the fans thought Jamie was at fault. Jamie still denies it was his fault but nevertheless at the time the fans were pretty bitter against him. I had telephone call after telephone call telling me that we would lose all our fans if we brought Jamieson here and for a while it had us worried. However, after Jamieson had played a couple of games for Duluth, these same fans became his most ardent supporter.\n\nAccidents will happen in hockey due to the speed of the game. I broke my nose twice, had two operations on it. Played three games with a broken finger that I didn't know about until later. No doubt everyone has heard how Ching Johnson was cut and sewed up until he looked like a patch work quilt.\n\nIver Anderson had four of his teeth knocked out in a game with Cleveland one year. He returned to the ice, finished the game in which we scored four goals to overcome a two-goal lead to beat Cleveland. A few years later while playing with St. Louis against Duluth, Iver had his lowers knocked out to balance up the job.\n\nWhenever hockey fans get talking about the old times, there is always a discussion of this or that team considered the best. For my part, I'll take any one of the Hornet teams that Dick Carroll coached in 1925-27. These teams were well coached, well balanced, and were strong competitors.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets didn’t have such a bad team either in the season of 1924-25, with Roy Worters in goal, Lionel Conacher, Smith, Herb Drury, Hib Milks, Darragh, McCurry, Cotton, White, Sullivan and McKinnon. As to individual hockey players I have always claimed that Frank ‘Moose' Goheen of the St. Paul Club was the best all-around player I have ever seen. Goheen weighed about 185 pounds in his prime, played equally as well on defense and offense, was always in top condition and had speed to burn. He was also a fine team player.\n\nSo much for the past. How about the future? Well, Duluth needs a new rink, an artificial ice rink. I am sure city officials and all our leading citizens are pretty well agreed that Duluth should have a rink or an auditorium where hockey games can be played on artificial ice with a sufficient seating capacity. The Amphitheater could be rebuilt by a private individual.\n\nA new building could be used for hockey, basketball, boxing, etc. the year around. The seating capacity of 5,000 would be sufficient for some time to come, I am sure. Or, the city may decide to build a municipal auditorium and I can think of nothing that would be more suitable as a memorial project for the service men. The tendency all over the country is for memorials that are practical."
