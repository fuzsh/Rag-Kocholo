        "text": "This article examines the coverage of the business of sport in 1944 and 1945 in two major Canadian dailies, the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail. In particular, the sports business writing of two popular columnists, Jim Coleman and Andy Lytle, is examined in detail. The article outlines how columnists constructed categories of identity for players, owners, fans, and sports writers. I argue that the coverage of sports business, often imbued with a negative attitude, reflects a desire among sports writers to cover \"important\" issues and defend the sporting community against the excesses of capitalism.\n\nIf sport scholars are going to contribute to a critical (inter)national dialogue that challenges “official versions” of a post-9/11 geo-political reality, there is a need to continue to move beyond the borders of the US, and examine how nationalistic sporting spectacles work to promote local military initiatives that are aligned with the imperatives of neoliberal empire. In this article we provide a critical reading of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s nationally-televised broadcast of a National Hockey League game, colloquially known as Tickets for Troops. We reveal how interest groups emphasized three interrelated narratives that worked to: 1) personalize the Canadian Forces and understandings of neoliberal citizenship, 2) articulate warfare/military training with men’s ice hockey in relation to various promotional mandates, and 3) optimistically promote the war in Afghanistan and the Conservative Party of Canada via storied national traditions and mythologies.\n\nIntroduced to the Haudenosaunee version of the game by the Kanien’kehá:ka, middle-class British immigrants and anglophone Montrealers formed the Montreal Lacrosse Club in 1856 and set out to appropriate and control the image that lacrosse conveyed to Canadians. They did this by monopolizing it through a series of non-Indigenous organizations, a uniform code of rules, and new lacrosse histories. The appropriation of lacrosse as a marker of national identity by non-Indigenous Canadians and its subsequent use in residential schools as a tool to coercively assimilate Indigenous boys demonstrate how, throughout the history of Canadian settler-colonialism, a substantial method of instilling the performance of gender – the production, repetition, and “standardization” of gender identities – occurred through sport and recreation. Colonial agents attempted to re-engineer and replace Indigenous gender identities and lacrosse games became both a site and an articulation of these gendered acts, blanketed in a discourse of Canadian nationalism. One of the many Indigenous nations to experience this process was the Coast Salish Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish) Nation. Although the introduction of this performance of masculinity in the form of lacrosse was imbued with a message intended to facilitate conformity within the new gendered Canadian nationalism, the message of that performance was “interrupted” by the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh’s own interpretation of the game based on their understanding of their nationhood and identities. Introduced to the game by non-Indigenous organizers at residential schools and in the metropolis of Vancouver during the turn of the twentieth century, the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh quickly embraced lacrosse not in the pursuit of Canadian nationalism, as was the intention of the dominant society, but as an Indigenous game and as citizens of the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh Nation.
