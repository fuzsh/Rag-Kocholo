Divided into three parts focusing on each of the protagonists, the screenplay (by Laurent and co-writers Morgan Perez and Chris Deslandes) fails to take things anywhere promising once Marie is more or less removed from the picture, chronicling her demise while her sis and b.f. look on with a mix of grief, despair and hopefulness. The initial conflicts thus give way to a rather sentimental depiction of two people dealing with their loved one’s probable decline, and Laurent tends to play such scenes awfully predictably, showing her characters crying, freaking out, laughing during brief moments of respite (many thanks to Leo’s cute comic relief), and then crying some more.

Despite the lack of real narrative meat, all three leads come off rather well, even if the various sister issues – by far the most compelling aspect of the film – are given short shaft after the thirty minute mark. As the persistent and debonair Alex, Menochet (who played opposite Christoph Waltz in Basterds’ unforgettable opening scene) offers up the more understated of the performances, transforming from your typical French pickup artist into a caring surrogate father and friend. Laurent’s character, on the other hand, doesn’t see much of an evolution, and the decision to skip over essential parts of her bio (such as why she’s a single mother) makes Lisa’s plight less compelling than the filmmaker-star seems to have intended.

Tech contributions are pro, although cinematographer Arnaud Potier (Jusqu’à toi) has a tendency to cover scenes almost solely in close-ups, as if there wasn’t enough decision-making coming from the director’s chair. French musician Jonathan Morali (frontman of the electro-pop group Syd Matters) provides a pleasant soundtrack that tends to be overused, especially throughout the film’s waning denouement.
