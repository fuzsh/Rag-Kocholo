It was the third tri-annual interdisciplinary Southeast Asians in the Diaspora conference. For two-days, conference presenters and audiences explored memories (e.g., memories of homeland; memories of war; memories of childhood and growing up American; historical memories; embodied memories; intergenerational memories; technologies of memories; and imagined/ created memories) and visions (actual sightings and sites of Southeast Asian Americans and their communities, both real and imaginary). Several conditions and goals guided the planning of the conference: First, we wanted the conference to be inclusive of the diversity of Southeast Asian American communities and subjectivities, since the first two Southeast Asians in the Diaspora conferences were dominated by Vietnamese and Vietnamese American scholars, scholarship, and perspectives. We not only wanted inclusive representation of Southeast Asian American diversity, but also heterogeneity within ethnic specific heritage and national groups. One of the central goals of the 2011 conference was to separate Southeast Asian Americans from the automatic association with “refugees” from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia following the Fall of Saigon in 1975. Second, we wanted to give graduate students, community activists, artists, and young scholars an opportunity to share their work-inprogress in a safe and nurturing, yet critical environment. Third, we wanted to build bridges between academe and our communities: To open up dialogue, reconnect on shared issues and visions for positive social change. Although the conference succeeded in actualizing diverse and heterogeneous representation from among the Southeast Asian American communities, this volume did not achieve this goal to the degree that the Editorial Board had hoped. The conference had diverse coverage and representation of Southeast Asian American communities and subjects, but readers may see a higher ratio of Vietnamese and Cambodian Americans represented in this publication. This reveals several important conclusions that we must acknowledge and address: For one, there is a paucity of available published\n\nSoutheast Asian Diaspora in the United States\n\nxxi\n\nresources that comparatively examine Southeast Asian Americans and their communities. For another, more effort and purposeful work must be undertaken to increase diversity within Southeast Asian American studies in particular, and Asian American studies in general. Finally, as scholars, we need to aggressively promote newer Southeast Asian American communities and subjects, as well as non-Vietnam War refugee populations. Disclaimers aside, this is the first interdisciplinary and multimethodological volume that is solely dedicated to Southeast Asian Americans. The review process for this volume was vigorous. It included two rounds of blind-reviews. First, after the Re-SEAing Southeast Asian American Studies Conference, a call for papers was announced: sixty-four papers were submitted for consideration. The first round of blind-reviews consisted of double-blind reviews by members of the Editorial Board as well as invited specialists. From this round, twenty-two papers were provisionally accepted with revisions. The second round of blind-reviews was also a double-blind review by members of the Editorial Board and invited specialists. From this round, seventeen papers were accepted, with request for additional revisions. The chapters and contributors represent the disciplines of history, sociology, anthropology, Asian American studies, religious studies, art, queer studies, health, literature, visual studies, education, and American studies. It is my hope that this volume will start a tradition of robust and diverse publications following future Southeast Asians in the Diaspora conferences. Jonathan H. X. Lee Berkeley, CA\n\nFOREWORD MARIAM B. LAM\n\n“Socrates: serious discourse… is far nobler, when one employs the dialectic method and plants and sows in a fitting soul intelligent words which are able to help themselves and him who planted them, which are not fruitless, but yield seed from which there spring up in other minds other words capable of continuing the process forever.” —Plato, Phaedrus “The maroons know something about possibility. They are the condition of possibility of the production of knowledge in the university—the singularities against the writers of singularity, the writers who write, publish, travel, and speak. It is not merely a matter of the secret labor upon which such space is lifted, though of course such space is lifted from collective labor and by it.” —Stefano Harney and Fred Moten, “The University and the Undercommons” in The Undercommons: Fugitive Planning and Black Study (2013)\n\nIn 2005, the first Southeast Asians in the Diaspora conference, held at the University of California at Riverside (UCR), found its formulation and its funding at the intersection of Viet Nam studies, Southeast Asian area studies and Asian American studies. That first conference title, “30 Years Beyond the War: Vietnamese, Southeast Asian, and Asian/American Studies,” and its triangulated conceptualization, in part, highlighted the new initiatives and diverse methodological approaches of UC Riverside’s then young Southeast Asian studies research program, SEATRiP: Southeast Asia-Texts, Rituals, Performance, with its openness to critical terrain in arts and culture, diaspora and globalization, gender and sexuality, and race and ethnicity. The co-organizers of that conference, Fiona Ngo and I, wanted to provoke conversations between established Southeast Asian studies research agendas and, alternatively, strong ethnic studies analytics that could take both fields beyond familiar Vietnam War and Cold War paradigms, challenging existing epistemes about Southeast Asia with new engagements from the diaspora and beyond. At the same time, we wanted to recognize and highlight the divergent and circuitous\n\nSoutheast Asian Diaspora in the United States\n\nxxiii\n\nintellectual and institutional paths Southeast Asian transnational and diasporic studies had to traverse at that moment in time. We were excited by both the diversity of the presentation proposals submitted and the variety of disciplinary locations from which the scholars arrived at their research. We were also struck by the coeval enthusiasm and frustration of what appeared to be a new generation of interdisciplinary thinkers struggling to articulate their wide ranging academic interests within the familiar traditional area studies and ethnic studies models of Kant’s Universitas. The former often elided concerns with acculturation difficulties, mainstream/minority politics and geohistorical amnesias, dismissing them as simplistic obsessions with “identity politics,” while the latter often chose projects with only very recent historical timelines that began in the West and neglected larger global political and older transnational entrenchments to avoid dealing with the war altogether. In 2008, Fiona Ngo and Mimi Nguyen organized the second Southeast Asian Diaspora conference at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign (UIUC), shifting its interdisciplinary identification toward ethnic studies and Asian American studies, with an emphasis on transnational cultural studies informed by critical theories of gender and sexuality, principally due to UIUC’s institutional academic strengths and sponsorship. Many of the pieces from this venue were collected and edited by Fiona, Mimi, and myself in a Southeast Asian American Studies special issue of the journal, positions: asia critiques (2013). Together with the third tri-annual conference in 2011 at San Francisco State University (SFSU), organized by Jonathan H. X. Lee and from which this Southeast Asian diasporic critical anthology developed, the intellectual momentum marks a significant leap forward in this emerging field. All three events saw a critical mass of often younger scholars engaged with the past decade’s concerns with the neoliberal university and their own professionalization, historical omissions and silences, affective archives, continued dislocations, and cultural nationalist negotiations. Even in 2005, however, we had to assemble opening and closing keynote speakers and a plenary panel comprised of scholars who had contributed disparate, but necessary, early work in creating the conditions of possibility for the inception of Southeast Asian diasporic studies. An ethnic studies matriarch, Yen Le Espiritu, our opening keynote speaker, spoke of the intellectual, infrastructural, social and emotional difficulty and isolation of the early years of ethnic studies, the near impossibility of even imagining a Vietnamese American cohort. On the Plenary, Southeast Asian/Americanist and education scholar Khatharya Um reframed earlier work to show its shortcomings; sociologist and Asian Americanist Hien\n\nxxiv\n\nForeword\n\nDuc Do cautioned us against the failures of institutional memory and a lack of self-referentiality about our community, oral history and activist projects; and U.S. Cold War historian Mark Bradley called upon the audience to continue vigilant pursuit of more scholarship around Southeast Asian ethnic diversity, gender, and sexuality. The only moment of heated exchange arose when a Viet Nam historian suggested that Southeast Asian Americanists, and more specifically Vietnamese Americanists, did not adequately engage with Southeast Asian languages or the more controversial internal ethnic politics around such incidents as the Vietnamese American community protests of the Oakland Museum’s curatorial exhibit that took place a few years earlier, with regard to the history of the Vietnam War. To the Asian Americanists in the room, this assessment recalled the historical refusal of traditional Asian area studies to conscientiously engage with ethnic studies scholarship and Asian American politics over “heritage” or “native” language politics, or any depth of understanding about race relations, or the institutionalized educational, economic biases and privilege complicit with the military-intellectual-industrial complex. In hindsight, I can see that all of the exhausting Platonic/Socratic seed sowing, the farming or “environmental” dialogic labor of these three professional conferences, contributed to the harvesting of alternative critical subjectivities, academic positionalities and intellectual socialities. There have been casualties; professional relationships can become fractured and lines of intellectual political dialogue break down at times, whether due to the jockeying anxieties of professionalization—the insecurities embedded within an insecure state apparatus obsessively compelled to secure itself by ensuring the undercommons stay in line with efficient upward academic mobility—or due to utter fatigue and overdue respite. Despite such absence or perhaps even as a result of it, subjectivities, positionalities and identity formation have become the foci of this critical collection. The university compels its subjects—those of us marooned by its restraints and disciplining tactics—to push forward with our fugitive planning. Jonathan H. X. Lee writes in his introduction, “It is our hope that a new discourse on subjectivity will form and follow this volume, one that takes subjectivity into new terrain, exploring new variables—physical and metaphysical, seen and unseen, verifiable and non-verifiable, human and ghostly, logical and illogical, reasonable and beyond reasonable explication.” Southeast Asian area studies have been dominated by military and colonial historians and anthropological designs. Those of us working out of, within, and against the gates of Asian area studies all too often find its\n\nSoutheast Asian Diaspora in the United States\n\nxxv\n\ngates shut rather tightly and its altitude somewhat stifling. Meanwhile, we see growing attention being paid to Southeast Asia within several nation or region-specific academic markets—in particular, those of post-Cold War afflicted nations and cultures (Viet Nam, Cambodia and Hmong studies all have newly founded academic journals)—as well as growing attention to Southeast Asia by its East Asian neighbors—Korean cultural tourism throughout Southeast Asia, Japanese comparative war violence and trauma scholarship, and Chinese post-socialist cultural and economic competition. How do the transnational intellectual offspring—the harvest and the marooned—of such histories and the newer interdisciplinary epistemes prove their scholarly worth and methodological rigor and maintain a radical political sociality and playful generosity, even with the trials and tribulations of bastardized accounting, shoddy reportage, uneven oral history, and occasional mediocre aesthetics confronting us at every turn? The positionality of Southeast Asian diasporic studies within Asian Pacific American studies has also been historically unstable when visible. During early periods of 1960s and 1970s anti-war activism and ethnic studies struggles, the focus on U.S. militarization in the Pacific gave some attention to the Philippines and Viet Nam in the form of the SpanishAmerican War, the Korean War, and the larger than life “Vietnam” televised daily in American households. However, throughout the Asian economic crises and influx of Asian immigration and refugee resettlement in the 1980s and 1990s, an emphasis on “claiming America” deprioritized and further alienated Southeast Asian refugees and immigrants from academic agendas. Pilipina/o American scholarship retained some presence when aligned with U.S. imperial history or early Asian American immigration history, but the other Southeast Asian American ethnicspecific groups were only to be found in sociological studies on population growth, resettlement and assimilation difficulties, delinquency and other dire straits. As the pendulum now swings back to U.S. empire and critical American studies in times of exceptionalism and terror, we also find a return of the repressed and debt-wielding gratitude of Southeast Asian refugees and their further neglected indigenous Pacific Islander neighbors. “Southeast Asia” and “Southeast Asians” are still missing. The rest of the diaspora beyond the United States is still missing. Similarly, within global cultural studies, there is increasing anthropological and sociological interest in comparative diasporic studies and transnational cultural critique. Nevertheless, this body of scholarship often reveals the unevenness of multi-sited research, in part stemming from a lack of research funding and in part from uneven training in interdisciplinary rigor. Foundations and other research organizations\n\nxxvi\n\nForeword\n\ncontinue to privilege the most needy and pathetic nation-state victims and the United States’ perceived assistance in their rapidly growing individual economies, while turning a blind eye to all the ongoing displacements of Southeast Asians elsewhere throughout the world. Scholarship available on Southeast Asians within the diaspora straddle the proverbial line between representations of their marginalization in relation to mainstream societies and poorly living up to the imposed cult of authenticity dictated by national and ethnic origin. The paucity of diasporic scholarship resides also in the negligible educational development and attainment opportunities for those isolated diasporics who manage to both maintain some language skills for ethnographic field data and succeed into higher education. But to conclude on a more heartening upswing, an end that is but another beginning, a new for(e)ward push, I am optimistic from what we can envision from the very outset of this volume. Part One’s three chapters respond immediately to the concerns above, addressing Indonesian memory and migration narratives, Filipino anxieties of return and tourism development, and the language politics of translation and census data for Thai Americans. I delight in the sheer diversity of scholarly interests. From the earliest Southeast Asian Pacific American scholarship by Peter Kiang, Lan Pho, and Thomas DuBois of the 1980s and early 1990s, until the fall of 2014, as Vichet Chhuon and Cathy Schlund-Vials, co-organizers of the fourth Southeast Asian Diasporic studies conference at the University of Minnesota, signal a return to questions of education, institutional memory, professionalization and the archive, we must continue to seek out the joys of intellectual life and radical sociality. Southeast Asian American and diasporic critique stands out precisely because of its penetrating stance on and familiarity with contentious race relations, state legislation and global regulation policies, and a plethora of community mobilization strategies. A critical mass is now fostering and facilitating new critical discussions and relationships between Southeast Asian studies and Asian Pacific American studies; “but certainly, this much is true in the United States: it cannot be denied that the university is a place of refuge, and it cannot be accepted that the university is a place of enlightenment. In the face of these conditions one can only sneak into the university and steal what one can. To abuse its hospitality, to spite its mission, to join its refugee colony, its gypsy encampment, to be in but not of—this is the path of the subversive intellectual in the modern university” (Harney and Moten 2013). Let us proceed together, then, if you’re feeling sinister.\n\nINTRODUCTION SOUTHEAST ASIAN AMERICANS: MEMORIES, VISIONS, AND SUBJECTIVITIES JONATHAN H. X. LEE\n\nI resist deliberately citing 2010 U.S. Census data on Southeast Asian Americans as evidence of the pluralism and heterogeneity that exists within and among Asian American communities. Instead, I invite readers to re-think or re-consider Southeast Asian American subjectivities, and the implications that arise from calibrating subjectivities from the intersections and internal-alchemies of memories, histories, and visions. No one I know who is from Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, or Malaysia consciously invokes the identifier “Southeast Asian” in reference to themselves—in Asia or in America. Instead, they invoke nation-state specific identities (i.e. Cambodian, Vietnamese) or ethnic-religio specific ones (i.e. Hmong and Cham). For Americans of Southeast Asian descent, subjectivity is experienced and/or interpreted, more often than not, as being embedded in ethnic-and-nation-state specific references (i.e. Thai American, Hmong American, or Cham American). As an academic discipline, Asian American studies originated from the demand for Asian American subjectivity, to know Asian Americans through history, art, literature, social sciences, and education, and as subjects of research. Four and a half decades later, matters of subjectivity are still central to Asian American lives—inside and outside of the academe. For instance, a common topic of discussion in my Vietnamese, Chinese, Cambodian, and comparative Southeast Asian American studies courses at San Francisco State University is identity. In particular, many Southeast Asian American youth express frustration with their inability to articulate—clearly and decisively—their entanglement with existential questions about their subjectivity apropos their ethnic, national, and cultural self-awareness. Their struggle between being Asian American and their own specific ethnic identity should not be taken for granted, and should not be dismissed as obvious or superficial. These perennial tussles\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nwith self-awareness, being, existence, and form—are central matters of subjectivity: Subjectivity mattered then, and it matters today, and will matter in the future. Thus, this volume seeks to ask questions about subjectivities in general, but with particular emphasis on Southeast Asian Americans from inside-out as well as from outside-in. Identity formation is a complex process that is not lineal and not logically temporal. Identity work is the attempt, conscious or not, to define the undefinable. It does not follow a dialectical process of folding, unfolding, and synthesis, nor does it occur in the span of a certain period, but rather, over the course of one’s lifetime, and is subject to situational and relational conditions and circumstances. Identity is intelligible, yet sorely unintelligible and difficult to articulate in the vernacular or with academic jargon. This process holds much potential for creativity: from discoveries that stem from the interplay of the real and imaginary: It is the process of making the self. History, material artifacts, and cultures do not directly or explicitly, although they can, inform and inspire subjectivity, just as awareness of identity, its form and content, does not necessarily inspire creativity or creative works, although it is a potential muse. Identity is formed from the unformed, it is formed from the unspoken, it is formed from the absence of memory, it is formed in the presence of memory—it is revelation, and formed in the process of de-forming self. As such, memory—real, imagined, and faux—is central to identity work. Snippets of oral tales, cultural clues, human encounters, and moments of life are the units of memory that flow through the capillaries of visions of self in the past, present, and future. Our visions of ourselves or of others originate from dreams, trances, or ecstasies, and potentially from supernatural appearances. Our memories are encoded, stored, and retrieved from our minds, from our bodies—buried in layers of muscles and tendons—from history, from community, from institutions, and from a network of human relationships. Our memories are the building blocks of an apparatus: A web of experiences, both real and imagined, both physical and temporal, based on truths and non-truths, that anchors—securely or feebly, our own production of self, or our visions of self. Both visions and memories interface with identity work in a cyclical and multi-directional manner as visions become memories, stored or un-stored, and as memories become visions of self, which are limitless, yet limited by our exposures—actual, direct, indirect, imagined, or created. The product of identity work is not final and fixed, yet there is a strong desire for it to be continuous and stable. Identity is important because it is a window into our sense of self, our way to understand who we are in this\n\nSoutheast Asian Americans: Memories, Visions, and Subjectivities\n\n3\n\nworld in relation to others, to time, and to our environs. Our memories are encoded, stored, and retrieved from our minds, our bodies, from history, from community, and from our social relationships. From this wellspring of memories and visions we can question (and question the questions we ask of) subjectivity, and engage in what Martin Heidegger describes as a kind of “hermeneutic circle” that relies on progressive acts of interpretations. This volume provides various exploratory interpretations on Southeast Asian American subjectivities, communities, histories, creativities, and cultural expressions, as they are revealed, informed, or infused with visions, dreams, and or memories of self in relation to others, places, time, and events—historically significant or quotidian. The interaction and interplay of visions, memories, and subjectivities is the focus of examination and interpretation, either directly or tangentially. It is our hope that a new discourse on subjectivity will form and follow this volume, one that takes subjectivity into new terrain, exploring new variables—physical and metaphysical, seen and unseen, verifiable and non-verifiable, human and ghostly, logical and illogical, reasonable and beyond reasonable explication.\n\nAn Overview of Chapters Part I: Varieties of Homes In Part I, Varieties of Homes, the authors examine how “home” is assembled or re-imagined in light of political, economic, and historical formations. Home is problematically questioned in relation to selfhood. In Chapter 1, Dahlia Gratia Setiyawan examines the ways Indonesian immigrants incorporated the collective memory of late-twentieth century national trauma in their homeland in narratives concerning their reasons for migrating to the United States. Setiyawan questions the way Indonesian migrants negotiated the theoretical and practical implications of self-identifying as either “immigrant” versus “refugee.” Setiyawan questions the possibilities and problems that arise once private and public narratives of self and migration conflict. In Chapter 2, Eric J. Pido examines the role of balikbayans, specifically Filipinos who return to the Philippines after living in the United States for several decades, and their positions and relationship to the economic development of their “home” country. The Balikbayan Hotel provides an illuminating case for understanding how emerging trends within the Philippine tourism industry, aimed at exploiting return-migration, have become a crucial means for propelling economic restructuring within the\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nlarger Philippine economy. By transforming repatriating Filipinos into “retirees,” balikbayans see themselves as patrons of the state who, through decades of overseas labor, patronage, and performed duties to the Philippines, are entitled to enjoy various luxuries that they could not partake of in the United States. Pido argues that the complexities felt by balikbayans, and the ambivalence that they experience, represent the common challenges and contradictions confronting the Philippines as it attempts to situate itself in an increasingly globalized economy. Anchoring Thais in America in Chapter 3, Kanjana Thepboriruk investigates political subjectivities of Thai Americans vis-à-vis obtaining accurate Census data. Thepboriruk’s study compares instructions produced by the U.S. Census Bureau with translations produced by THAIS, Inc., a non-profit organization in Los Angeles, California. Thepboriruk shows that, in general, the Bureau preferred direct translations of Census instructions and a formal register, while THAIS, Inc. preferred indirect translation and a less formal register. The difference is critical, as the translation influences the message and the overall success of the Census in the Thai American community. The authors in this section direct our attention to individual subjectivity as an economic and political strategy of existence and as a means of governance that beckons us to reconsider and recast assumptions about the workings of collectivities and institutions.\n\nPart II: Varieties of Religiosities The five chapters in Part II: Varieties of Religiosities, provide glimpses of Southeast Asian American religious subjectivities. In Chapter 4, Janet Hoskins presents data based on recent fieldwork among Vietnamese Americans in California, and explores the meanings of the mirror that spirit mediums gaze into, and why it is a required object on altars to the Vietnamese “mother goddesses,” whose worship has just had a resurgence in diasporic communities in California. Hoskins looks at religious ways of mediating displacement and re-forming an identity in the reflected glory of Vietnam’s imperial past. In Chapter 5, Susan Needham focuses on Cambodian Americans in Southern California. Needham contends that Cambodian Americans have recreated a variety of ritual and ceremonial practices in Long Beach, California, and cites two ceremonies as case studies: a chumruen preah parit (blessing ceremony) conducted at the Wat Khemera Buddhikaram in 2000 and; a pithi sampeah kruu performed to honor teachers and guardian spirits of dance and music in 2006. Needham explores how Cambodian\n\nSoutheast Asian Americans: Memories, Visions, and Subjectivities\n\n5\n\nAmericans conceive of and interact with ancestor and guardian spirits in these ritual settings, and considers the extent to which these practices are being transmitted to a new generation. In Chapter 6, Jonathan H. X. Lee explores Thai American expressions of religious subjectivity, collective and individual, that unfolded during a community conflict between Thais in Berkeley, California, and their nonThai neighbors. Asian Buddhist communities have encountered xenophobia, American white ethnocentrism, Christian supremacy, Orientalism, and cultural imperialism, which have directly and indirectly transformed the shapes and contours of Buddhist communities and their practices in America. Working from similar themes of racialized religious subjectivity in Chapter 7, Ling Hoang, a scholar and an ordained Franciscan priest, documents Vietnamese American Catholics who employ religious work in civil protests: the Vietnamese American Catholic protest against Cardinal Pham Minh Man in Los Angeles, California; the protest against the owner of the Hi-Tek video store display of the Vietnamese flag and image of Ho Chi Minh in Orange County, California; and the protest against Bishop Pierre DuMaine on the formation of a Vietnamese Catholic parish in the Diocese of San Jose, California. The intersection and interplay between religion and politics is nested in a racial hierarchy, Hoang argues, that reveals the complex process of spatial production and the formation of subjectivity. In Chapter 8, Rossina Zamora Liu recounts the challenges she had in performing ethnographic research on Vietnamese fortunetelling and sorcery rituals in Little Saigon, Orange County, California. She examines the ways in which her family’s connections to the double murders complicated the research process and her attempts to reconstruct Ha Jade Smith’s life beyond rumors. What began as curiosity about the ritualistic nature of the crime inevitably led Liu to discover a world of magical plants that ate eggs; virgin ghosts that inhabited dolls; spells that cost $6000, and finally, despite efforts to avoid it, conflicting emic-etic roles that had to be negotiated. The inward journey begs Liu to ask questions of access: who really gets to write the story? What exactly does it mean to be an insider and outsider to a native culture that, at times, seems both foreign and familiar? How might these roles and the value systems that come with each position obscure and/or facilitate the research and storytelling processes? This chapter is about memories Liu does not have, but that she has inherited—visions of the victims’ bodies, of the white paint on their faces and hands, of their souls failing to unite with their bodies because they (the souls) could not recognize the faces to which they had belonged.\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nLiu mourns for their displacements, for the violence of being killed for multiple lifetimes, and asks for permission to tell the story. These authors show us the interplay between the individual and the community, thereby probing the dimensions and contours of intersubjectivity, revealing that religiosities provide a window into social relationships, and social existence.\n\nPart III: Varieties of Creativities Part III delves into creativity: Starting with Chapter 9, Mary Thi Pham and Jonathan H. X. Lee explore the dimensions and interplay between Cambodian American literature and the pedagogy of social justice. Pham and Lee implore both cultural producers and appreciators to retire Cambodian American “victim narratives” by examining the negative affects they have within their communities, as well as throughout U.S. society. By exploring three texts that are exemplum of “healing narratives,” Pham and Lee advocate for the production and distribution of these types of narratives in order for Cambodian Americans to seek justice, heal, and empower themselves and their communities. It is anchored in a critical pedagogy that is informed by struggles for social justice, embodied in the texts, the readers, the authors, and the classrooms. In Chapter 10, Isabelle Thuy Pelaud, a scholar-activist-artist in her own right, probes the issue of interpreting works by Asian American artists that crosses troubling ethnic categories. More specifically, Pelaud asks, is Vietnamese American artist Binh Danh’s aesthetic and spiritual engagement with Cambodian American memories and experiences a betrayal and sign of disrespect for national memories, or can his representation serve the partial and forever incomplete rendering of missing testimonies? Pelaud’s examination of Binh Danh’s artwork on the Cambodian Genocide argues that such cultural productions open a spiritual and political space that invites personal healing and reflection across national boundaries through meditative remembering. The artwork pushes viewers to critically reflect on the vexed histories of the region and complicates the ways in which we think of subjectivity. In Chapter 11, ViӋt Lê, another scholar-artist, explores creative work and works that spring from national and personal memories. Lê’s chapter is anchored within the larger context of diasporic cultural production. Lê discusses Hӗng-An Trѭѫng’s solo exhibition entitled The Past is a Distant Colony. Hӗng-An Trѭѫng’s work, Lê argues, stitches across the torn seams between memory and loss, desire and void. National and personal memories, historical traumas, and colonial desires are undone, briefly\n\nSoutheast Asian Americans: Memories, Visions, and Subjectivities\n\n7\n\npulled together, but the absences stretch open, creating an immense void. In Hӗng-An Trѭѫng’s works, the past is ever-present in archival black and white, darkness and light. The authors in this section show how creative subjects may forge or foreclose their lives to reveal that which is most urgent or most “inspiring.” They explore how people’s inner states reflect their inner experiences within a world that is chaotic yet silent, in moments of transitions and decentering, in states of exception when morality and ethics are questioned and challenged, and presumed common knowledge is not assumed. Creativity lies in these moments, in the betwixt and between, in the reflection and remembrance of shifts and cycles of normalcy and states of exception wrapped by iterations of violence and calm, drama and quotidian, passion and dispassion, love and hate, recovery and lost, hope and despair, death and survival, selflessness and selfishness, and displacement and replacement.\n\nPart IV: Varieties of Cultures The three authors in Part IV explore the intersection of cultural productions and expressions vis-à-vis memories and visions of self, home, and community. In Chapter 12, Trikartikaningsih Byas studies the heterogeneity of the Indonesian American community. Despite their diverse religious, ethnic, and linguistic backgrounds, Byas argues, Indonesian Americans come together in religious, social, and cultural organizations that assist them in their adjustment, identity formation, and cultivation of understanding and harmony in their new land. Byas cites participation in three genres of Indonesian music—gamelan, angklung, and dangdut—as the conduit for Indonesian American reproduction of self, community, and home. In Chapter 13, Linda Gerdner, a scholar and medical professional, delves into the research on Alzheimer’s disease and Hmong Americans. Research has identified Alzheimer’s disease as an important but neglected issue for Hmong Americans. Children of family caregivers often have difficulty understanding progressive memory and behavioral changes. Families expressed a need for culturally responsive learning materials addressing this issue. Gerdner discusses Alzheimer’s disease in relation to memory, personal identity, and social relationships. Gerdner emphasizes the need to promote personhood in the care of persons with Alzheimer’s disease by creating a meaningful environment that maximizes preserved abilities within the context of human relationships. Gerdner offers basic principles of maintaining personhood that are combined with general\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nthemes of family caregiver from interviews to discuss the creation of a culturally-responsive picture book for Hmong American children and family. In Chapter 14, Krissyvan Khamvongsa Truong explores how culturalcapital intersects and influences Laotian American students’ academic achievement while disassembling the stereotype of Asian American students as a racialized model minority. Truong argues that the model minority stereotype makes Laotian American students “invisible” while they struggle academically. Truong employs “social capital” as a conceptual framework to better understand the academic experiences of Laotian American students. Truong concludes that Laotian American subjectivity, as produced through ethnic “social capital,” plays a significant role in predicting Laotian American students’ potential for academic success. The authors in this section reveal that rather than being a variable, culture is relational. Culture is re-made, re-fashioned by individuals and communities—in time and through space. Subjectivity is intertwined with particular configurations of cultural forms apropos political, economic, and socio-historical circumstances. Cultural production and re-production cues us into visions of how people see themselves in relation to others.\n\nPart V: Varieties of Sexualities The two authors in Part V explore queer sexualities, an often taboo subject among immigrant communities, as well as mainstream society. In Chapter 15, Raymond San Diego provocatively explores the ways gay Filipino American men employ digital technologies to produce their own explicit sexual self-representation and self-satisfaction within a spectral and material context of racism, colonization, and heterosexism. San Diego contends that such responses have developed through the growth and accessibility of viral websites such as XTube.com, which provides space for do-it-yourself pornographers who can upload their sexual acts onto the World Wide Web and into the private spaces of voyeurs. Rather than viewing pornography through moral binaries of “good” or “bad,” San Diego utilizes Celine Parreñas Shimizu’s theory of “politically productive perversity” to extrapolate the possibilities of pornography and queer Filipino American sexual subjectivity and representations of self. Through a “close reading” of self-produced amateur pornography starring Filipino American gay men, San Diego proposes that the sexual acts can be interpreted as a technology-of-the-self that decolonizes the fetishized-andracialized bodies of Filipino American gay men.\n\nSoutheast Asian Americans: Memories, Visions, and Subjectivities\n\n9\n\nIn chapter 16, Karen Quintiliani investigates the intersection of sexuality and gender among Cambodian Americans. Quintiliani argues that to understand Cambodian and Cambodian American sexual cultures, identities, and meanings requires a historical perspective of gender varieties in Southeast Asia. Quintiliani engages with the third sex/third gender theory, which seeks to broaden the conversation about genders and sexualities to include the way social actors themselves name their bodies, actions, and identities and how societal classifications and conditions shape these meanings. For Cambodians, the social role of the khtΩΩy could constitute a third sex/third gender that she explores as a possible research trajectory. The two authors in this section investigate expressions of sexual subjectivity as technology-of-the-self. They force our gaze on the body— physical and digital. Subjectivity emerges from the contours of bodies that are penetrated by the complexity of linguistic limitation, racialization, and Western-hegemony. Unwrapping the West—its mores, its standards, and its language—potentially liberates Southeast Asian American subjects. The final chapter in the volume is an Epilogue by Cathy J. SchlundVials. Schlund-Vials situates her closing thoughts on the future of Southeast Asian American studies that buttresses her own familial history and encounters with war, relocation, and migration.\n\nReferences Agamben, Giorgio.

After living in the United States for a little over five years, predominantly as an unlawfully-present day laborer, the twenty-six-yearold ethnic Chinese Indonesian migrant was returning home. Hendra had left Indonesia during the late 1990s’ Asian Financial Crisis and collapse of the Suharto regime. As jobs dried up, inflation soared, and unrest broke out, he and some friends applied for non-immigrant visitor visas to travel to Philadelphia, not as tourists, but as temporary economic migrants. Drawn to the city’s burgeoning Indonesian enclave and its day laborer agency networks, they quickly found under-the-table employment and began sending remittances to their families in East Java. Hendra soon heard that he could adjust his immigration status to permanent residency, maybe even citizenship, by petitioning for asylum. His factory co-workers told him that, like them, he should emphasize that as a Chinese and a Christian, he was a persecuted ethnic and religious minority in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation. Subsequently, Hendra applied, citing that he had experienced discrimination growing up in Indonesia and feared returning there because he was a member of groups routinely targeted at times of national unrest. Although applying for asylum earned Hendra temporary legal residency, when his final appeal was rejected for insufficient evidence of past or future persecution, his hopes for legalization were defeated. To tell the truth, Hendra said, he never was actually afraid to return to Indonesia. In fact, he felt conflicted about the persecution narrative he had crafted and was looking forward to putting the whole thing behind him. As he gathered his bags, Hendra acknowledged that once he returned to\n\nCollective and Conflicting Memories in Narratives of Migration\n\n15\n\nIndonesia, he would likely not come back to the United States. Smiling resignedly, he said he had no regrets. Even if his petition had ultimately failed, at least he had given the American Dream a try. After legally entering the United States as non-immigrant visitors during the late 1990s and early 2000s, many of the thousands of Indonesians who had migrated overstayed their visas to work as day laborers until conditions improved in Indonesia (Adib 2010: 12; Setiyawan 2005; Setiyawan 2010).2 A significant percentage of this wave, predominantly migrants from Indonesia’s second largest city, Surabaya, went to Philadelphia. By 2002, the Indonesian community there peaked at 6,000 to 8,000 people.3 Ethnic Chinese Indonesians constituted approximately 80 percent of the community.4 Christians (largely evangelical) and Catholics were the two largest religious groups, followed by Indonesian Muslims, who were largely Javanese. Pull factors were an abundance of under-thetable employment in the area, as well as inexpensive accommodations in the working-class neighborhoods of South Philadelphia. Depictions of Indonesian migration to the United States stressed that fears for their safety prompted the primarily ethnic Chinese Indonesians to leave their homeland (Cunningham 2008: 90; Sukmana 2009). These portrayals corresponded to accounts that Indonesian Chinese, among other minorities, fled during the late 1990s economic crisis in order to escape outbreaks of ethno-religious violence (Siegel 2001: 104; Purdey 2005: 21). Such analyses were accurate, at least in part. Anti-Sinicism, traceable to the Colonial Era, was particularly strong during Suharto’s New Order regime (1966 - 1998), when outbreaks of anti-Chinese violence were “not only seen as ‘normal’ but inevitable in certain situations” (Purdey 2005: 33). Seeing that ethnic Chinese were scapegoated during the economic and political turmoil surrounding Suharto’s rise to power, anti-Chinese violence reoccurred under similar conditions during the regime’s downfall.5 In several cities, the 1998 “May Riots,” interpreted as a manifestation of social “[h]atreds associated with the ethnic Chinese as corrupt and opportunistic,” resulted in rapes, looting, and the destruction of Chinese homes and businesses (Purdey 2005: 18). While the U.S. Consulate General in Surabaya documented an increase in visa adjudications during the height of the ethno-religious unrest, the true surge came in 1999 and 2000, when the worst of the violence had passed, but as Indonesia’s monetary crisis (krisis moneter or krismon) intensified.6 Thus, contextualizing the migration wave of the late 1990s and early 2000s solely as a movement of people fleeing violence overlooks the economic push factors that drove many Indonesians,\n\n16\n\nChapter One\n\nincluding ethnic Chinese, to leave their homeland for Philadelphia and other destinations during that time. This chapter considers how, using collective memory, Indonesians have narrated their migration experiences, accounting for the factors that compelled them to temporarily live or permanently settle in the United States. A group’s collective memory of its shared past is developed within certain social frameworks that contribute to the articulation of this past and the group’s role therein (Halbwachs 1992: 38). Some scholars have emphasized that physical locations can become “the medium of transmission of…collective memories” for migrants in the diaspora (Lalich 2008: 57). Others have proposed that “migration rather than location is the condition of memory” (Creet 2011: 9). I adopt the latter perspective to show that the ways migrants evoked collective memory to (re)frame and account for their emigration to the United States can, and did, change depending on the audience of their migration narratives.7 Outside of their enclave, numerous Indonesians in Philadelphia classified themselves as refugees, albeit of a different nature than Southeast Asians who had arrived in the United States earlier.8 In their ingroup migration narratives, most self-identified as voluntary, temporary economic migrants. The refugee emphasis became the predominant narrative as numerous Indonesians began to apply for asylum. A number of the asylum petitioners who took this route indeed wished to leave Indonesia permanently because they did not trust their government to protect them should a crisis arise again (Sukmana 2009). Others had different objectives. As one participant of this study stated, asylum became “a way for people to stay here because with papers, ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents] would not arrest them” (Suparlan 2010). Original oral histories from more than thirty long-term study participants, as well as other supporting evidence, revealed that many migrants who applied for asylum sought to gain employment authorization and more time to work during krismon. They also sought the freedom to live openly and the ability to move between the United States and Indonesia that legal residency would provide. Once the risk of migrants’ unlawful presence increased following the 11 September 2001 Al Qaeda attacks on the United States (hereafter 9/11), seeking legal asylum became more urgent because pending asylum would mean exemption from the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS). NSEERS was a post-9/11 initiative that required non-immigrant males from twentyfive predominantly Muslim-majority countries to register with immigration officials between November 2002 and April 2003.9 The odds\n\nCollective and Conflicting Memories in Narratives of Migration\n\n17\n\nof being granted asylum were not in the favor of most of those who applied. Between 1998 and 2004, nearly 10,000 Indonesians across the United States filed for asylum.10 Immigration authorities approved 3,923 of their cases (U.S. Department of Homeland Security [DHS], Yearbook of Immigration Statistics: 2005 44).11 Among the many others that were denied, 1,000 applicants were formally found to have filed false claims of persecution (Prambadi 2004: 25). As per U.S. immigration law, an individual qualifies as a refugee because he or she suffered past persecution or has a “well-founded fear” of future persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion (Germain 2010: 25). Applicants must meet the burden of proof for establishing eligibility for asylum within one year of their arrival in the United States by demonstrating that there is a “reasonable possibility” that they have been or will be persecuted if they return home. Even if applicants have not experienced harm directly, by establishing a “pattern or practice” of persecution, they can demonstrate that they have a well-founded fear based on harm endured by others who faced similar circumstances. Applicants can otherwise show that belonging to a group “disfavored” by state actors makes them targets for persecution (Germain 2010: 106-7). Ultimately, applicants are deemed “credible” when they provide testimony that does not contradict generally known facts. Writing about asylum seekers’ narratives, Chowra Makaremi notes the incredible burden under which petitioners’ claims of persecution must be produced for authorities to believe the credibility of the narrative presented to them. Indeed, “narrations of memories evoked by border discourses have to confront, fit, avoid, and decode a national memory belonging to the ‘hosting’ country” (73). Accordingly, “credible narrative memory is the key to refuge and migration, yet must be produced under conditions of ‘mis/trust’ embedded in the national and political framework of controlling borders and mobility” (Creet 2011: 13). To exercise their agency in determining how they wished to portray themselves and, thereby improve their chances of gaining acceptance as refugees, Indonesians who were drawn to the United States by economic push-pull factors employed what I have termed appropriated and enhanced memories in the migration narratives they offered as testimony in their petitions for asylum. An appropriated memory is one that is taken from another source and claimed as one’s own personal experience or recollection. An enhanced memory is one that an individual did experience, but that is embellished or transposed upon a different time or context.\n\n18\n\nChapter One\n\nWhen publicly-articulated memories emphasizing Indonesians as refugees began to conflict with privately-articulated ones regarding economic migration push factors, various impacts upon the development and unity of the Philadelphia Indonesian migrant community resulted. These conflicts in turn caused tensions that would alter the community’s internal dynamics. Conflicting narratives also shaped outsiders’ perceptions of the circumstances that led Indonesians to migrate to the United States and the conditions that they faced in their homeland, promoting additional strains.\n\n‘Why We Left:’ Collective Memory in Migration Narratives Indonesian migrants in Philadelphia widely cited a volatile and collapsing national Indonesian economy as a major factor that prompted many to come to the United States as temporary economic migrants. While krismon did not affect all migrants in the same way (indeed, a very small minority claimed that they were either unaffected or were able to profit from the experience), many migrants endured hardship. Common memories concerned difficulty securing work or long-term loss of employment, trouble paying expenses, and seeing their families’ financial solvency disappear. Indah Nuritasari, a migrant of Javanese and Sundanese heritage who emigrated from Jakarta in 2002 described the crisis years this way: The economic situation was really bad [as was] the social situation… because we [were shifting] from [a] really undemocratic situation to, I think, a democratic era… we had problems everywhere. The people were losing their jobs and the prices were really high and then inflation [led to] uncertainty in many areas like economic, social, and politic [sic] so people were not sure what to do. (Nuritasari 2007)\n\nIn their migration narratives, ethnic Chinese migrants typically emphasized the more immediate trauma of the May Riots, as well as their positions as second-class citizens during the New Order, as reasons for migrating to the United States. “David,” a Chinese Indonesian migrant from Surabaya who arrived in Philadelphia in 1999, cited both the riots and an overall sense of anti-Chinese animus among his Javanese neighbors as the non-economic reasons why he migrated: “I decided to leave Indonesia in 1998, after the May Riots, because the conditions were unstable… it was a time of chaos with minorities becoming easy targets… In Surabaya there were no riots, but I still felt afraid and intimidated [because] I’ve felt intimidated and harassed since childhood” (David).\n\nCollective and Conflicting Memories in Narratives of Migration\n\n19\n\nOther Chinese Indonesians also cited intimidation and institutional discrimination (such as being denied full citizenship rights despite having lived in Indonesia for generations) to explain why they migrated to the United States. Although most remained unharmed during their country’s unrest, their strong collective memory of anti-Chinese animus during times of national trauma was enhanced by legitimate fears that they might become targets of violence. However, even those who feared future victimization ultimately stressed that they mainly saw themselves as voluntary temporary economic migrants. “Yohannes,” who came to Philadelphia from a town on the outskirts of Surabaya in 2000 with his wife, “Margaretha,” initially cited the anti-Chinese violence as his reason for migrating, but then later stated: “I did not leave because of the political crisis but because of krismon” (Yohannes). As the examples above illustrate, ethnically Indonesian migrants often began their narratives by stating that the economic crisis was the main motivation for migrating, while Chinese Indonesian migrants followed a different pattern. They initially pointed to the 1998 May Riots, as well as other state-endorsed incidences of anti-Chinese animus, as explanations for their departure, then gradually revealed that economic push factors prompted them to migrate. Indonesians who held expired visitor visas and who considered themselves temporary economic migrants faced difficulty in meeting the criteria for asylum because they had to win approval within a system that already challenged their right to inclusion. Legal parameters, therefore, forced migrants to “(re)construct their identities to gain the status that the law determines is most appropriate for them” (Aleinikoff 1995: 267). Experiencing the trauma of financial hardship during krismon, or experiences of discrimination did not amount to persecution in the eyes of U.S authorities. Thus, numerous migrants (re)constructed their migration narratives in an attempt to officially gain the status of refugees.\n\n‘Why We’ve Stayed:’ Appropriated and Enhanced Memories in Asylum Cases The best documented and most widely publicized cases of memories having been appropriated from outside sources and used in asylum claims occurred in 2004, following a two-year federal and state agency task force investigation into a trans-regional fraudulent document ring.12 One of the ring’s leading brokerages, the Chinese Indonesian American Society (CIAS), included a branch in Philadelphia (Bahadur 2004: B6). According to the government’s charges against the twenty-six defendants (fifteen of\n\n20\n\nChapter One\n\nwhom had been granted asylum), between 1999 and 2004, clients who paid upwards of $2,000 were provided with a fraudulent claim. They were then coached to “cry, plead, and avoid positive references to Indonesia” in order to elicit sympathy from asylum officers and immigration judges (U.S. Department of Justice Press Release, 2004). Chinese Indonesians were told to say that they had suffered a rape or other physical assault, robbery, or property destruction during the May Riots. The syndicate’s ringleader used a different strategy for his ethnically Indonesian clients. He instructed them to claim that they were members of pro-Suharto youth groups that political reformers persecuted following the fall of the regime (Prambadi 2004: 26).13 Although they were not CIAS clients, Yohannes and Margaretha said they submitted a case built on enhanced memories inspired by other sources. Aided by a friend, they filed for asylum in the spring of 2001. As the lead petitioner in the case, Margaretha cited her actual memories of discrimination, such as her parents’ obligation to prove their Indonesian citizenship to government authorities during the Suharto regime. However, she believed that such evidence did not constitute enough proof of persecution to satisfy U.S. immigration authorities. According to the couple, their friend, who was aware they had come to Philadelphia to look for work, recommended that they emphasize that they had suffered ethnic and religious persecution (Yohannes 2010). By enhancing memories of discrimination with fabrications of physical attacks, the narrative the couple eventually used centered upon a narrative that Yohannes and Margaretha were victims of anti-Chinese violence. By Margaretha’s account, the story that she provided to immigration officials was “forty percent true and sixty percent false” (Margaretha 2010). It was convincing enough to temporarily earn her and Yohannes work permits and Social Security numbers while their case wound through the immigration appeals process. However, the couple’s penultimate appeal was ultimately rejected on the grounds of insufficient evidence of past or future persecution. They were then given the choice to wait out the court’s final decision in an immigration detention facility or return voluntarily to Indonesia. Unhappy with either alternative, they decided to risk circumventing immigration authorities for as long as possible and keep working in Philadelphia. In 2007, Yohannes was caught in an ICE sting; after spending several months in detention he was deported. Margaretha subsequently returned to Indonesia to join him. They currently run a small business out of their home on the outskirts of Surabaya, a property paid for with earnings from their labor abroad.\n\nCollective and Conflicting Memories in Narratives of Migration\n\n21\n\nDavid initially planned to use his tourist visa to work in Philadelphia, then return to Indonesia once conditions improved; however, following his arrival he changed his plans, thinking he would have more opportunities as a minority in the United States than in Indonesia. He was also fearful of the conditions that awaited him at home in a country still recovering from the dual traumas of economic crisis and widespread unrest. In 2000, David decided to apply for asylum so that he could remain in the United States longer as a legal resident. He sought the help of an Indonesian legal consultant who, “helped make up the story” that he used in his asylum application in exchange for a $1,000 fee (David). David suggested that his account of persecution drew heavily upon appropriated and enhanced memories. He stated it was based upon forms of discrimination he had experienced and intimated that he had been the victim of anti-Chinese violence. David lost his final appeal in 2006 on the same grounds upon which the court had rejected Yohannes and Margaretha’s claim: insufficient evidence of past or future persecution. Rather than submit his case to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) or Federal Circuit Courts, he voluntarily returned to Surabaya. He is now a business owner who credits his success to the capital he accrued during his days as an undocumented factory worker in Philadelphia. Not all migrants whose persecution narratives authorities rejected ultimately were as fortunate as Yohannes and Margaretha or David. In 2001, Anwar Muhammad, a Javanese migrant from Surabaya, arrived in Philadelphia on a visitor visa with the intention of finding under-the-table work. Two years later he applied for asylum. He hoped a claim that a militant Islamic organization would persecute him if he returned to Indonesia would gain him legal residency. This was a terrible miscalculation. Arrested in 2005 as a suspected national security threat due to his self-proclaimed affiliation with an Islamic extremist group, he was imprisoned and then deported. This misfortune triggered a series of events that culminated in his children being taken into the custody of Philadelphia’s Department of Human Services and his wife being committed to the psychiatric ward of a local hospital. In 2007, Anwar recounted his ordeal for the Indonesian newsmagazine, Gatra, revealing details already well known to many Indonesian migrants in Philadelphia (Prambadi 2007). His narrative, he said, was not true, but rather had been crafted from other sources at the behest of a legal advisor. He had devised it to avoid being deported once it was discovered during the NSEERS call-in registration that he had overstayed his visa. Knowing that other Indonesian migrants in Philadelphia had successfully petitioned for asylum influenced him to try the same method to obtain legalization.\n\n22\n\nChapter One\n\nWhat he did not foresee, he said, was that unlike many of his fellow migrants, applying for asylum would not end up helping his family but destroying it.14 As these unsuccessful case outcomes reveal, increasingly fewer Indonesians applying for asylum would be as successful as earlier petitioners were between 2000 and 2003. At least two causes were at the root of this decline. First, immigration judges and the BIA found that reports of improving conditions in Indonesia following the crisis years undermined most claims of future persecution. Second, a groundbreaking legal case filed with the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals in 2005 presented an obstacle to a large segment of Indonesian asylum seekers. In Lie v. Ashcroft, the Court said there was lack of evidence that robberies a Chinese Indonesian family (Lie) had experienced were motivated by religious or ethnic hatred, thus they failed to establish “a well-founded fear of persecution” if they returned to Indonesia. The Court upheld the BIA’s decision to deny them asylum. The case set a precedent for the rejection of subsequent claims of a “pattern or practice of persecution of Chinese Christians in Indonesia” (Lie v. Ashcroft 2005). Thus ended the asylum hopes of most Indonesian petitioners in Philadelphia.\n\nConsequences of Conflicting Memories Well before immigration authorities intensified their scrutiny of Indonesians’ persecution claims, it had become common intra-community knowledge that numerous asylum applicants had submitted persecution narratives based at least in part on enhanced or appropriated memories in order to gain legal residency and authorization to work in the United States. As this occurred, certain tensions arose. On a personal level, migrants such as Hendra, whose story opened the chapter, felt conflicted about using appropriated memories to bolster their asylum cases. Others who did not engage in the practice felt uncomfortable or disagreed with those who did. Some experienced ethical dilemmas. As one Javanese Muslim religious leader in the community wrote in Gatra, “If I don’t want to help someone who has a legitimate right [to apply for asylum], then I’m wrong. But I’m just as wrong if I do help someone who has no right [to file]” (Munjid 2007: 42). Due to the significant differences between the migration narratives recounted to those outside of Philadelphia’s Indonesian enclave and the narratives known predominantly within the community, conflicting memories also resulted in intra-community fissures and mistrust. Some members of the community began to take advantage of others, as in the\n\nCollective and Conflicting Memories in Narratives of Migration\n\n23\n\ncase of the CIAS asylum fraud ring. Charging exorbitant sums of money to “help” asylum-seekers create narratives and to file their applications, the CIAS exploited fellow migrants who had non-existent, weak, or unverifiable claims of persecution, knowing that clients would simply pay for a better chance to legalize. Once some migrants were granted asylum, they occasionally used their new-found legality to threaten others. As Indah recalled: “People started fighting… ‘your case is weak and mine was real, once I get citizenship I can report you [to ICE] if you ever do anything to me’” (Nuritasari 2007). Hani White, an ethnic Betawi migrant who arrived in Philadelphia from Jakarta in 2001 concurred. Hani related that a woman who had acquired citizenship through a fabricated claim of persecution sought revenge over a workplace dispute by reporting a co-worker who was unlawfully present to immigration authorities (White). This was similar to an earlier episode instigated by a migrant named Edi, who stated to Gatra in 2004 that “Indonesians asking for asylum is getting to be too much… I’m sick of hearing about it.” He then recounted how he wrote to several U.S. immigration enforcement agencies to inform authorities of the practice (Prambadi 2004: 27). Multiple informants explained that with the increase of ICE raids targeting Indonesians in Philadelphia in the years following the call-in registration, mutual suspicions and even rumors that migrants were cooperating with the FBI to turn in visa scofflaws ran rampant. “Nobody talks about [their case details] anymore, it’s too private,” became the norm as suspicions crept up in the community due to these developments (Indah). Many Indonesians who remained in Philadelphia saw this breakdown in solidarity as one reason behind the decrease in the size and closeness of their community.15 By the early 2000s, advocates, service providers, and journalists began to view Indonesians in Philadelphia solely as refugees from violence, which influenced public response. Well-meaning, though uncritical, parties who came to the aid of Indonesians who they perceived to be persecuted ended up dividing ‘valued’ or ‘worthy’ ethnic and religious subgroups from the remainder of the population. Compounding and perhaps influencing this unbalanced support was the fact that so much of it emerged immediately after 9/11, a time when suspicion of Muslims and concerns about nations such as Indonesia ran high in the United States. In 2003, members of Philadelphia’s City Council, prompted by a leading organization that advocated for immigrants, submitted a resolution calling upon the mayor to provide Temporary Protective Status for the “mostly ethnic Chinese and overwhelmingly Christian and substantially Catholic” Indonesian migrants in the city (Cohen, Verna, and Kenney\n\n24\n\nChapter One\n\n2003: 1). The aim of the proposed resolution was to exempt “Indonesian refugees” in Philadelphia from reporting to immigration authorities as mandated by the NSEERS call-in registration (Cohen, Verna, and Kenney 2003: 1). As the petitioners argued, Indonesians’ “overwhelming” status as ethnic and religious minorities represented strong grounds for their exclusion from a registration process that predominantly targeted Muslims. Though smaller in number than ethnic Chinese Indonesian Christians, ethnically Indonesian Muslims are a visible and active presence in Philadelphia. It is thus notable that the Council members did not call the government’s profiling of all Indonesians, regardless of religion or ethnicity, unjust. This framing can be interpreted in at least two ways. At most, it seems to imply that the petitioners believed that Indonesian Muslims were not beyond suspicion, and, therefore, should register. At the very least, they appear to have been indifferent as to whether Indonesian Muslims registered or not. What is clear, however, is that the Council members directed their advocacy to the segment of the community to which they felt most sympathetic. Although the resolution proved unsuccessful, it marked an early episode of unbalanced support for Indonesian migrants in Philadelphia. Journalists also created, as well as reinforced among community outsiders, a perception that most Indonesians had migrated to Philadelphia solely to escape Muslim-perpetrated unrest. A 2003 Philadelphia Inquirer article entitled “Indonesian Refugees at a Crossroads” was one such story. Written on the eve of the call-in registration, the article addressed the dilemma of whether unlawfully present migrants should comply with the mandate to register with immigration authorities. Reporting that the 80 percent of Indonesians who self-identified as Catholic or Protestant all “fled… after [ethno-religious] violence in 1998,” the writer focused on the prevalence of “Islamic radicals” and “Muslim extremists” in Indonesia. In closing, he asked, “should they go to the Immigration and Naturalization Service and risk getting detained, go home and risk being attacked, or do nothing and hope for the best?” (Ginsburg 2003: B1). Two years later, a front-page feature story in the Philadelphia City Paper about a Chinese Indonesian family from East Java who were seeking asylum based on claims of persecution by Muslims enforced these perceptions. As stated in this City Paper piece: “These immigrants have a much more sinister fate awaiting them… A majority of Philly’s Indonesians… are Christians who fled their country because they were even more scared of the Muslims than John Ashcroft and the Justice Department” (Tobia 2011).\n\nCollective and Conflicting Memories in Narratives of Migration\n\n25\n\nWhen narratives were publicized suggesting that a “sinister fate” was the sole cause of an entire group’s migration to the United States, unity among Indonesians in Philadelphia who internally shared a different understanding of their community’s origins was challenged anew. Migrants who might otherwise have forged solidarities based on mutual experiences concretized or reformulated ethno-religious divisions, hostilities, or stereotypes. These tensions compounded the existing fractures within the community that were caused by the widespread use of appropriated or enhanced memories in asylum seekers’ persecution claims. Another outcome was that some migrants began to fear being denied reentry to their country by Indonesian authorities unhappy with their perceived willingness to malign their homeland to gain legal U.S. residency. This particular concern is perhaps most revealing about Indonesians’ objectives as migrants in the diaspora. It shows that ultimately, those who plan to return home, whether or not they applied for asylum while in the United States, wish to maintain a good relationship with their nation regardless of the memories they privately, or publicly, share.\n\nNotes 1\n\nNames that initially appear in quotation marks indicate the use of a pseudonym for an informant who has requested anonymity. 2 The 2010 U.S. Census indicates that 95,270 total respondents self-identified as Indonesian (U.S. Census Bureau, “Race Reporting for the Asian Population by Selected Categories: 2010”). This total represents a 51 percent increase from the 2000 Census, which listed a total of 63,073 self-identified Indonesian respondents (Barnes and Bennett 9). Accounting for the large number of unlawfully present temporary migrants, however, the population of Indonesian who have lived in the United States during the past decade is actually much larger. 3 The lower estimate of 6,000 is derived from totals suggested by community leaders. The higher estimate of 8,000 was first published as an “educated guess” in a social worker’s report based on outreach conducted on behalf of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia (Mendez 4). 4 In Indonesia, the ethnic Chinese are a minority group. There, demographers estimate that the approximately 3 million Chinese Indonesians constitute 1.5 percent of the total population of nearly 250 million (Suryadinata et al. 79). 5 While institutional discrimination and racism against the Chinese followed the 1965-6 purge of the political Left, the anti-communist massacres upon which Suharto rose to power were not principally directed at ethnic Chinese, who constituted no more than 2,000 of the approximately 500,000 to 1 million victims of the mass violence (Coppel 58).\n\n26 6\n\nChapter One\n\n13,959 and 17,954 non-immigrant visa adjudications were recorded for 1999 and 2000, a notable increase from the 8,812 and 10,237 adjudications of 1997 and 1998, which wa"
