        "text": "NB: Scanned on OCR – still needs editing. Read Rob’s book Duzi Fever or read it on joomag.com – page 14 of Umko 50 years.\n\nFIRST UMKOMAAS RIVER TRIP – EASTER WEEKEND 1960\n\nThe Duzi was either a paddling or walking race. Whatever the river levels were, there was an unavoidable amount of walking. The level of the Duzi benefited from local flash floods and the Umgeni River from good sustainable rains in the catchment area. These conditions were unpredictable and the race often resulted in a soul destroying foot-slog. We heard they were going to build an enormous dam – being The Inanda Dam on the Lower Umgeni and this would make things worse.\n\nWe dreamt of paddling in a river where there was virtually no portaging. We decided to plan a trip on the Umkomaas River and decide its viability for a major canoe race. We planned to start our trip on Easter weekend 1960 at The St. Josephine’s Bridge that spanned The Umkomaas River on the Richmond / lxopo Road to the Cape.\n\nPeter Marriott’s Father – Geoff Marriott had built a huge trailer with a multiple rack that could accommodate at least eight or nine canoes and he kindly ferried us to St. Josephine’s Bridge as we planned to sleep under the bridge and make an early start. We built a fire to keep us warm and hunkered down for the night, The cold woke us early and after a mug of steaming coffee and rusks we slid our canoes into the river and into the swiftly flowing current. Paddling was a dream and we basically spent the day steering more than paddling our canoes over rapid after rapid on the beautiful clean water, the river flanked on either side by smoothly rounded white boulders. On bends of the river we canoed beneath krantzes that towered above us, carved out by the passage of centuries of flood-waters passing through. Having journeyed many miles down river, stopping occasionally for a smoke break and to stretch the legs and ease our burns.\n\nWe were in the best of spirits and then Dereck Antrobus started horsing around. In losing concentration, he left it too late to bypass a projecting boulder, got caught sideways on and then in a flash, the inevitable happened: His canoe wrapped around and broke its back. We were now about ten miles up river from a small trading store known by the locals as “Fishy Fish”. We decided to head for it and wait for Dereck, who was now on foot to catch up. There being no track or footpath to follow, on many occasions he had to swim the river to bypass the insurmountable krantzes that blocked his path. A few miles above Fishy Fish the ground levelled out and he came across an Umfaan with his donkey. After parting with a shilling or two the Umfaan let him mount the donkey and about two hours after our arrival at Fishy Fish and as we were starting to worry about him, in rode Dereck grinning like a Cheshire cat astride the donkey. Before Dereck arrived we had decided it would be too dangerous for a lone canoeist to pioneer his way out of the valley. We had no idea where the bus or roads were, so we planned to sleep on the concrete floor of the stores covered verandah and on the morrow we would find the way out of The Umkomaas Valley and back to Durban. ln our canoes we carried rations to last us the expected four days we had allowed for the trip. Because of the weight limitations restricted by the canoes carrying capacities, we were unable to afford the luxury of beers and instead we carried half jacks of Cane, Vodka, Brandy and what ever the individual preference. The mixers were packets of Cool Aid topped up in a billycan of river water. Our food consisted of tins of Bully beef, Spaghetti etc. and of course coffee and rusks.\n\nTo heat up and boil water, we had four Turm Sporl mini cookers that were fuelled by methylated spirits contained in a small brass reservoir attached to the top of the Turm Sport stove. Needless to say, us being youngsters and not used to drinking “shorts” downing a billycan of Riverbrew at one go soon did the trick. lt wasn’t long before we were semi-paralytic, singing bawdy songs at the top of our voices and banging with our knives on our upturned billycans to such an extent, that we actually punched holes in them. Having flattened our half jacks, Graham who hardly ever imbibed, kept up an incessant bitching for more booze. To placate him Peter Marriott unscrewed the cap of his Turmsport Stove, and passed it to Graham saying, ‘shut up and drink this”. Graham was so out of it. He raised the stove to his lips and had a good few gulps of the purple liquid. All of a sudden, he let out a yell and then spewed the most spectacular cat I’ve ever seen all over the poor little Brakkie that was trying to beg some scraps from us. Graham hurled his boots up for a solid hour and then, thank God he fell into a drunken sleep. The following morning when we awoke, bleary eyed and buggered, the verandah looked as if a bomb had hit it; the floor was littered with the remnants of the previous night’s debauchery. Among the debris stood the dejected looking Brakkie wearing a saddle of congealed puke. Someone called Graham “Captain Honk” and this nickname has stuck ever since and might be the origination of the rapid now referred to as “Captain Honks Rapid”.\n\nThe store owner arrived, fortunately after we had sorted out the shambles and we asked him if he would look after our canoes for two weeks. To ensure his un-dying loyalty and co-operation, we proceeded to tear a number of R10 notes in half in front of him. His eyes nearly popped out of his head as we did this, and told him we would be back for our canoes in two weekend’s time and would then give him the other halves of the notes.\n\nWe bid the owner of Fishy Fish store farewell, and reminded him again to be sure to meet with us in two weekend’s time. We then set off plodding up the dirt track leading from the store to a dirt road used by the bus somewhere above, where hopefully we would be in time to hitch a ride on the bus that headed for Umkomaas.\n\nWe arrived at the top, hot and sweaty and flopped down to rest under a shady thorn tree to wait for the bus, which announced its arrival in a cloud of fine red dust. We managed to squeeze aboard and became instantly aware of the stale odour of the sweaty, unwashed bodies of the passengers. l’m sure we didn’t smell much better ourselves. As the bus journeyed on, it stopped periodically to allow passengers to alight or board. No toilet stops were made and when nature called, a male would simply hang from the running board by the driver and make like a fire hydrant. Females seemed to have mastered the art of holding on indefinitely. The bus driver made one emergency stop to replenish supplies of the local brew which did its rounds among the passengers, including us. We eventually arrived at the bus depot in Ndudut where we alighted and found that we still had to board another bus to take us to the village of Umkomaas. Where we would find this bus was another matter, but then good fortune smiled upon us as we gazed around at the sea of curious Blacks staring at us and wondering who we could ask for help or directions.\n\nMy gaze became focused on a familiar black face. I was currently employed as a pay clerk at Mobil Oil Co. The weekly paid staff had to present themselves at the pay office window on Friday afternoons to collect their pay envelopes. On arrival they would call their Company Badge Number followed by their name. the fellow I was now staring at was an employee of Mobil, whose name was Nelson. Before collecting his pay packet he would stand at the pay window and announce himself as, ” No. 5611 – Nelson – one arm, one eye, one arsehole” and amidst howls of laugher would receive his wages. I called out “5611” at the sound of which Nelson leapt around and rushed over to greet me. We told him where we had come from and he directed us to the bus that took us to Umkomaas and now to hitch to Durban. We tried to flag a motorist down with no luck. lt became apparent that nobody was prepared to stop for such a motley looking mob such as us. So we resorted to Plan B. Two of us hid out of sight behind bushes on the verge and the best looking of the three stood on the side of the road with thumb up and a fixed smile on his face. This worked. Within minutes a car stopped and as the motorist said’ “hop in”, so the other two sprang from hiding and rushed the car. We managed to arrive in Durban none the worse for our adventure.\n\nTwo weeks later we returned as promised to the Fishy Fish Store to retrieve our canoes and found the store owner eagerly awaiting our return so he could redeem the other half of the notes in his possession.\n\n===================================\n\n2nd UMKOMAAS TRIP – EASTER WEEKEND 1961\n\nHaving had a taste of the Umkomaas and realizing its potential as a future canoe race venue, we decided to undertake another exploratory trip on the river over the 1961 Easter weekend which ended on the 3rd of April. Meanwhile Verity and I had set our Wedding Date for the 4th of April 1961. It would be touch and go to make the wedding in time should any canoeing mishap occur on the river. To enable us to carry more provisions (which included the luxury of some beers) and to cope with the much bigger rapids on the Umkomaas, we built “Birddog” double canoe hulls but fitted them with single cockpits. These canoes proved to be ideal for the conditions we would encounter as they had loads of freeboard and were extremely buoyant.\n\nTwo weeks prior to our trip, Peter Marriott, Denny Sterling, Norman Dyer and myself drove to the Fishy Fish Trading Store in Pete’s Opel station wagon and dropped off provisions for our impending Easter trip. Again we tore a couple of notes in half to ensure the store owner’s co-operation and reliability. We returned to civilization up a steep and badly eroded dirt road that led out of the Umkomaas Valley.\n\nWe had planned to spend the night under the St. Josephine’s Bridge, but as light rain had started to fall we decided to spend the night at the local Richmond hotel nearby. The manager seemed overjoyed that we would help fill his vacancies, a decision I am sure he later regretted. We dumped our gear in our allotted rooms and went in search of the Pub, which as we entered, we saw was being patronized by a group of rough, tough looking individuals dressed in Khaki shirts, Khaki shorts and Vellies. As we entered they turned as one man and stared disdainfully at us. We ordered ourselves a round of beers and then to break the ice we broke into a rendition of what we thought would be an appropriate song which went like this:\n\n“Daars ‘n ou spinnekop in die kakhuis\n\nen hy val van die deksel tot die draad\n\nen as jy my nie kan wil glo nie\n\ndan kan jy in die kakhuis gaan kak”.\n\nMoments later we were all maaties and much were the jokes, singing and drinking that ensued. The pub closed and we tottered off to our respective bedrooms. The noise we were making as we said goodnight to each other was indescribable and it wasn’t long before the manager was summoned in an attempt to shut us up. Down the length of the hotel passage was a cricket mat runner. At one end stood the manager who was kakking all over poor Colin Wilson who happened to be the closest to him. The opportunity was too good to be missed and on impulse I bent down and jerked the mat from under them. They crashed to the floor like ten pins. We howled with laughter and nearly ended up spending the night in the local jail. Fortunately the manager had a sense of humour and after promising him faithfully that we would behave ourselves he condescendingly allowed us to stay over. What a Gentleman!\n\nThe following morning we were driven to the river and began our trip. The river and rapids were fantastic. The scenery was too beautiful. We shot the rapids single file and then waited at the bottom for the last canoeist to come through and then floated abreast to the start of the next rapid and so on. We must have covered a good forty miles and we began keeping a lookout for a suitable campsite for the night. We chose an ideal spot opposite a gently flowing rapid and a flat sandy bank to pull our canoes on to. Behind this was a nice grassed area to camp on. The river must have overflowed its bank in the past as in receding it had left behind a plentiful supply of driftwood, bleached pearly white by the sun. Perfect for our camp fire.\n\nFor sleeping, we planned to prop our canoes on their sides and stretch sheets of thin plastic sheeting over the top to form a waterproof roof cover. For a bed, we would dig a hollow for our hips and pack it with grass to form a mattress. The best of plans don’t always work. We discovered that the heat generated by our bodies caused heavy condensation on the underside of the plastic and we ended up soaking wet. The sheeting was definitely a bad idea.\n\nAs we were preparing to crawl into our grassy beds, one of our canoeing buddies, Denny Sterling pulled out his “Piece de resistance”. It was an “el-cheapo” luminous pink lilo. Denny waved it in our faces and bragged about the good night’s sleep he would have on it. If looks of jealousy could kill, he would have been dead. Denny proceeded to blow up his lilo which as it filled with air swelled into three equal compartments. Just to gloat, Denny kept on blowing and blowing.\n\nSuddenly, without warning, one seam of his lilo split and the lilo popped into two panels, one double size and the other normal. I was sitting next to him wearing my sheath knife. As the lilo went “kapuf”, I whipped out my knife and stabbed it. We howled with laugher, but Denny couldn’t see the funny side and slunk off into the bush with the mutters.\n\nWe were awoken from sleep by a shout from Denny who had meanwhile snuck back to our camp fire and, being cold, had gone to sleep with his damp rope soled shoes as close to the fire as possible to dry them. After they dried they began to smoulder. After that rude awakening sleep was hard to come by. I put on a brew of coffee and as I sat sipping it, so the full moon appeared over the top of the hill opposite me and as it rose above the hill, it was as if Mother Nature had suddenly switched on the lights. The river became lit up in a magnificent silvery glow. I thought of how privileged I was to witness this event. We rose early, ate rusks dunked into mugs of steaming hot coffee and we were ready for the day.\n\nWe couldn’t wait to get back into the river. Day two was a repetition of the previous days canoeing. Rapid after rapid with unbelievable scenery as we paddled past kraantz after kraantz. We were totally stoked. Again we chose a suitable spot on the riverbank with plenty of driftwood for our campfire. We soon had a roaring blaze going. For supper we ate like Kings, feasting on vacuum packed Braai chops, baked beans and potatoes wrapped in tin foil and cooked over hot coals. We washed the meal down with Castles cooled down in a cairn of river – stones we had built in the riverbed.\n\nDay three: We ate our traditional breakfast of Rusks and coffee and we got on our way. We had been fore-warned that somewhere along today’s route we would come across a huge waterfall where the river narrowed down and funnelled through a five metre gap, plunging some fifty meters into a deep pool that had been hollowed out beneath. We kept a wary eye out for signs of the waterfall fearing that we may suddenly come upon it without warning and be unable to pull out in time. Our fears were unfounded because as we rounded a bend. there in the distance about three kilometres ahead we could see a column of white spray rising up into the sky. As we approached within 500 metres the roar of the waterfall was clearly audible and the spray hung like a pall above us. As we neared the waterfall the terrain became strewn with huge boulders that had obviously been tumbled there like marbles when the river was in flood. Carrying our canoes over these boulders would be extremely difficult and unpleasant.\n\nPlaying on the sandy left bank of the river, just before the start of the boulders, were a group of Umfaans. We asked them if they would help carry our canoes around the waterfall and we were met with stony stares and a shake of heads. It’s truly amazing what the jingle jangle of coins in the pocket can do. In a flash we were inundated with more willing bearers than Dr. Livingstone and Stanley must have had. Watching them portage was sheer pleasure as we strolled along like gentlemen behind, admiring the countryside.\n\nAfter repaying their kindness we got back into the river and were soon propelled out of sight by the fast flowing current. Some miles further downstream we heard the tremendous roar of what could only be a mother of a rapid. We were right, and just as well we climbed out of our canoes to inspect it. To have attempted to shoot it would have been suicide. The water cascaded for about a hundred metres at a steep gradient over rocks and then flowed at pace along a gulley flanked on either side by gigantic grey speckled river boulders that created eddies and whirlpools on the waters surface. After studying the terrain we felt that the easiest and safest way to re-enter the river was to carry around the cascade and climb back into our canoes in the calm water that existed between each boulder and to be prepared for the sharp right hand kick of the canoe as the nose edged into the main flow.\n\nAll six of us made it safely and as we waited downstream for our last member, Claude to appear there was a lengthy delay with no sign of Claude or his canoe. We pulled our canoes onto the bank and then rushed back to find out the cause of Claude’s holdup. On reaching the boulder where we had embarked, there was no sign of him or his canoe. A feeling of panic and terror overcame us. We knew Claude was a poor swimmer and we began shouting his name above the roar of the river. lt seemed as if the worst tragedy had befallen us. I don’t know what made me do it, but I crawled on top of the huge boulder and as I lay on my stomach and looked over its edge into the river, I peered straight into the panic struck eyes of Claude, just as he emitted a scream for help. There he was, terrified and clinging for dear life to a ledge under the overhang, with his canoe being crushed by the pressure of the river against the face of the boulder beneath him. I dropped into the river and prized him off the rock. One other canoeist rescued his canoe and between us, got Claude and his canoe safely back to the river bank. After a cigarette and a shot of brandy from our emergency rations, Claude was declared fit but he decided he’d had enough and would find his way out of the valley on his own.\n\nFrom here on the rapids were gentle and we had no more drama. We now had to decide where to camp for our last night. Peter Marriott had heard that somewhere in our vicinity there was a mission. Fed up with roughing it at night, the thought of home comforts at the mission appealed to us. We started to enquire as to its whereabouts from local Blacks as we came across them. We drew a blank, until we encountered a group of umfaans playing down by the river. but who actually lived at the mission. They guided us to a footpath that led uphill and brought us out at the mission. We met the Missionary a Mr. Swanson who told us that he had built the mission many years ago and that all the building material had been brought there by river-boat long before the Rayon factory and weir on The Umkomaas had been built. It was fantastic to be able to have a wash and a drink of good clean rainwater. Mr. Swanson came along and offered us a bunch of ripe bananas which we grateful accepted and proceeded to devour with the speed of a troop of monkeys. Shortly thereafter he came back and asked if we would like to attend the evening church service. This caught us totally off guard and we tried to concoct a few lame excuses as to why we were tied up. Mr. Swanson proceeded to castigate us saying we accepted his food. but not his religion. We felt guilty and reluctantly agreed to attend the evening service. The loud ringing of a bell told us it was time to attend service so off we went like lambs to the slaughter. As guests of honour we were ushered to chairs in the front row. The church hall on our left and behind us was packed with children. Their faces shining from their recent ablutions with Lifebuoy soap. They sang a number of hymns In Zulu and finished their recital with a hymn sung in English, something about paraffin lamps, lights etc.\n\nThen horror of horrors, Mr Swanson asked us whether we would like to sing one of our hymns. There was a hush of silence as the congregation eagerly awaited our rendition. We looked from one to the other. Sad to say, not one of us knew the first words of any hymn and felt that “Barnacle Bill’ or “Mother McGinty” might not be suitable. We sat ashamed and red faced with embarrassment. The children began to titter as they realized how stupid we were. Once again we slept outside with our canoes.\n\nDay four: We couldn’t wait to leave the mission behind us. They say the best form of defence is attack, so to cover the embarrassment of the previous evening, we all agreed that Swanson was an arsehole. If he wanted to bury himself in the bush, that was his indaba, but he mustn’t try and drag us with him. We felt better having got him and his mission off our chests and we could now turn our attention to the final flat paddle to Umkomaas, with only the Rayon Factory Weir to carry around.\n\nNow for my trump card. I had kept this a close secret and told no-one. Now was the time to surprise them with the good news. Unbeknown to them, I had been in contact with the manager of The Lido Hotel in Umkomaas and had told him of our impending river trip and suggested that if he wanted publicity we would end our trip at his hotel around midday on the 3rd of April and see if we could arrange coverage with the media. He thought this was a brilliant idea and I asked him if it would be possible for him to lay on a lunch and cold beers at the end of our journey. The guys almost started singing “For he’s a jolly good fellow”. Little did I suspect that an hour or so later they would want to lynch me.\n\nWe set off in high spirits with the thought of the culinary treat that lay ahead. We began a slow paddle down the final stretch of The Umkomaas. We were well ahead on time and wanted to arrive at The Lido around midday as scheduled. As we merrily cruised along we came across a small trading store on our right bank and decided to pull in and grab a couple of Cokes. To my joy, the Coke fridge also contained bottles of Raspberry flavoured milk which was my favourite. I went berserk and in satisfying my craving, glugged down bottle after bottle to a point where I was as full as a tick and could hold no more. I tried walking to my canoe but my stomach seized in violent cramps. I would be unable to paddle in this condition, so I did the only thing possible in the circumstances. I put my finger down my throat and hurled the most spectacular pink cat.\n\nMy recovery was instantaneous. It was now time to make the finish. We paddled on slowly over the remaining couple of kilometers and arrived on schedule just before 1pm.\n\nInstead of the welcoming committee I had thought would meet us. there wasn’t a sole to greet us. What a let down. In desperation. I suggested to my now sceptical buddies, that we hike up to The Lido and confront the manager. So up we trudged. After a short walk, we arrived outside The Lido. Entrance was barred by a wooden door with a buzzer, which I pressed optimistically and then stood by with bated breath hoping for a miracle. The latch rattled and the door creaked open and there stood the manager. I could have hugged him. He welcomed us with open arms and invited us in. He asked if we could carry our canoes up the stairs to the pool terrace. I went first, head inside the canoe and started blindly carrying it up the steep and narrow staircase that led up to the pool deck. Half way up, I felt the prow of my canoe catch on something. I shoved and the next minute the light fitting I had hooked off the wall came crashing down, followed by an agitated shout from the manager, “no more canoes!”. So as a lone ranger I soldiered on – as I emerged there was a roll of drums and a voice that blared out over the microphone announcing, “the arrival of the canoeists”.\n\nI peered out from under my canoe and there I stood like a prize prick, the centre of attraction to a large gathering of Lido patrons having an al fresco smorgasbord luncheon around the swimming pool and being entertained by a live band. The voice boomed out again, “Would you please put your canoe into the pool and give us a demo”. As I obliged, my fellow canoeists dived into the pool out of sheer embarrassment, a slick of river mud oozing from their boots, cigarettes and bits of sweet wrappings floated like flotsam on the surface of the sparkling blue water. I lowered myself into my canoe which took up nearly half the length of the pool and after two strokes hit the other side. We clambered from the pool accompanied by a roll on the drums and the clapping of the spectators. The manager invited us to a small dining room downstairs and we were treated to a wonderful cold buffet and best of all, some ice cold Castles. But we were not off the hook. The manager asked if we would please say a few words to the crowd. The fixed stares of my buddies told me that I was it.\n\nWe all trooped back up to the pool deck and I was handed the microphone. My knees were trembling and I felt as though I had swallowed my Adams Apple. I coughed once or twice into the microphone and peered balefully around at the mob. There was no way out. I had better give them their money’s worth. As I got going my nervousness left me and was replaced by verbal diarrhoea. I embellished my tale with what I hoped was poetic license (another name for bullshit). We had to dodge the odd crocodile on the sandbanks, we were chased by Impis of spear wielding savages and had to swipe at the odd Mamba dangling from trees as we swept under. When I eventually ran out of bullshit and stopped talking the crowd broke into rapturous applause. It was time to make our exit while we were still on top.\n\nHaving said bye to the manager and thanked him once again for his hospitality it was time to hit the road and prepare myself for the event that would change my life forever and that was the marriage of my beautiful bride to be – Verity, to a dirty, smelly unshaven me. We were to be married at 5:30pm on the morrow. When I made it back to Durban and fell into the waiting arms of Verity she took one look at my condition and burst into tears. She thought not even a car wash could get me presentable for the wedding.\n\nWe had a memorable wedding, spent our honeymoon night in our flat on the Berea. All we had was a mattress with no linen. We departed the next morning for our honeymoon at Royal Natal National Park Hotel in my faithful 1951 Ford Prefect which I had hand painted a bright emerald green. The car had a major engine knock and overheated so I had my doubts as t whether it would survive the strenuous uphill trip to The Drakensberg. To conserve the poor thing, I had decided to switch the ignition off and coast all the major downhills, the first of which was Windmill Hill just after Hillcrest on the main road to Pietermaritzburg. In free-wheeling downhill with the engine off, I was amazed to see the speedo reaching 65mph and as I levelled out at the bottom of the hill and turned my ignition back on, so a motorist rode alongside signalling me to stop. I obliged thinking he had noticed something major wrong with my car, but all he wanted to know was how I had souped up my motor. He had never seen a Ford prefect fly along at such a speed with such a silent engine. He couldn’t believe it when I told him I was free-wheeling with the engine switched off.\n\nWe managed to make Royal Natal National Park without hitch and were shown our Honeymoon rondavel. Then tragedy struck. I developed violent toothache which turned into an abscess. For four days I lay on my bed, dying of pain and only emerged at meal times to eat and rush back to the rondavel. After four days I could stand the pain no longer and drove into Bergville where the local dentist yanked out the offending tooth. It took one more day spent on the bed recovering and the next day awoke feeling like a million dollars and fit enough to mingle with the other guests.\n\nIn explaining that our absence for five days was because of toothache they said they had observed Verity and me rushing in for a quick meal and straight back to our rondavel for five consecutive days and had deduced that I was some kind of Superman.\n\n======== END 2nd UMKO TRIP – Rob Gouldie 1961 ============\n\nIn the early days of K3 development , after the Gandy brothers had completed a Dusi in a K3 I felt that it was not designed for carrying but would be a great boat for a really big river. So I started plotting to find someone brave enough to paddle this unknown quantity with me. My old mate Dickie Edwards had declined after I swam him through No.5&6* and suddenly I discovered I had no friends. (*Read about THAT below).\n\nLuckily, two adventurous and possibly too trusting young ladies took the bait and pitched up at Hella-Hella to take on the Umko. Two nights before, Di asked if I wanted a repair kit in the boat. Well there were two rolls of tape already tied in the K3 so I said no thanks , visualising a small suitcase of stuff that she normally carries. It was already a very heavy boat and it took both of them to carry it to the pound, trying not to struggle.\n\nAt the start there was much shaking of heads and muttering about nutcases with the river level estimated at about 1.8 and having that oily, silent look except for the little rapid above the start which was throwing up a bit of spray. None of these portents worried me because driving a K3 is easier in fuller conditions.\n\nSo with the now silent girls in the back we set off as planned, right at the back of the batch, giving the racing snakes lots of space because the boat picks up speed in the Approaches like a KTM 500 through a dip. Clinging to the inside line we eased through to the bottom of the approaches and euphoria set in.\n\nAfter telling the crew we would take a middle line at Number 1 as we arrowed down the small stuff my legs suddenly turned to jelly and I called back: ”We’re going left”.\n\nMISTAKE # 1\n\nSo with no real plan, going at a comfortable 25 knots, like a destroyer trying to ram a U-boat we arrived at the lip of Number 1.\n\nMISTAKE # 2.\n\nAbout now MISTAKES #’s 3 to 5 kinda blurred together because another K2 was aiming to take out but left me no room in the narrow channel and so I jammed on left brake and got my nose inside of them but with the impetus of a cruise liner. With our nose on the bank , tail in the current, the boat swung around, we all fell out, to the oohs and aaahs of the group on the rocks.\n\nSave the boat was uppermost in my mind and with the cockpits facing upstream a wrap was imminent. It was a strong boat and no wrap happened because it was half out the water resting on the K2 which was making failing fibreglass noises. I needed help to lift but my crew had deserted me. I saw Di clinging to a rock in the middle of the drop with her knuckles turning white, slipping off and following Patricia down into the big hole at the bottom.\n\nWith the help of Guy Collyer, Nick Burden and another we fought the boat onto the bank and I ruefully surveyed the damage. Several breaks on hull and deck looked bad but so blinded by pride etc was I that we prepared to tape her up when a glassfibre patch or two would have been better. The sun was hot , the boat dried in minutes and the last batch had rattled by so I looked around for a knife to do a good job of taping. My two river-babes each fished out a vicious-looking flick knife with a serrated edge designed to cut through cockpit lips when trapped. I took a mental two steps back and had eyes in the back of my head for the rest of the trip. And so I should as I continued to treat my crew very badly. So we set off from no 1 on a couple of wings and a prayer for the finish.\n\nAt Rapid Number Two MISTAKE # 6 occurred as I tried to sneak the holes in our wounded boat , overlooking the danger of eddies snatching the nose and so we spun out, rammed the rocks on the side and cracked the deck some more.\n\nA bit more tape and off we went again. As P said in her description of events there were times when she was on top of the world and times when she was in the depths. As reargunner in a wildly flexing boat she was being thrashed up and down in the wave trains like a yo-yo. But there I was sitting sublimely up front, just missing the holes and having a lovely time and ignoring the yells from the back.\n\nThe boat got us through everything (walking Number 5&6) until that bony little rapid just above Number 7 where I dumped us in the water AGAIN. It was here I discovered something startling about Di. As we pushed the wreck to the bank she carelessly tried to knee a rock out the way and I discovered that she sinks. As I pried her little white clutching hand off the boat down she went into the depths. If it wasn’t for a quick grap on her pfd by P…………. ! Later I asked if maybe she should enhance her personal bouyancy she just looked at me with eyes like black holes.\n\nSo with P being whipped up and down and Di passing damage reports and stuff like , “water has reached my waist, now it’s reached my er….neck” and me paddling blithely on (my end was OK) we got to our nemesis ie Number 8.\n\nThe top drop had a serious wave train of vicious curling monsters and as we punched through the biggest of them the nose snatched the slack water and we went up the bank like a large croc after a wildebeest. I was so high up the bank that I stepped onto dry land. The boat was hanging together only just and so we decided to float down to the cars at the picnic spot. The second drop at Number 8 is a test even for a whole boat and with a despairing cry from P as she floated out of her seat it was end of story. The K3 was held together by cables only. So we dragged ourselves ashore like drowned rats and a very kind Gary Clarke took us out.\n\nDi and P were the first to learn one of the Golden Rules when paddling the Umko:\n\nDon’t follow Hugh!\n\nPete herewith a little more memory scrapings:\n\nIn the early ’80s I paddled behind Jimmy Potgieter in one of those Umkos that ended at Goodenoughs Weir and It escapes me whether it was two or three day race. Its not relevant to this story because although we had a good race , the last day was in focus. Jimmy did not do much training in those days, he smoked a lot of those thin little cheroots and had a reserved stool at most of the pubs in town. I was a complete beginner and although it was my Accord, Jimmy was happy to drive and I was happy to learn from the original “Iron Man”.\n\nSo we paddled away from Riverside , survived Four Foot Drop and got down to the approaches to Waterfall. Jimmy recounted his version of the Peter Peacock Incident which had me spell-bound. I have since heard Peter’s version of what happened but there is a big bit missing in the middle. I guess being unconscious leaves a gap. But I digress – we portaged the Falls with much looking back at it – very sobering. We were all alone by this stage, the field had spread out and when a lone single came into view on those flats it was quite encouraging to me.\n\nAll through Whirlpool and Gully we kept the K1 in sight and there was only No-Name rapid left according to Jimmy and then the Weir at Goodenoughs. By this time we were pulling really hard, determined to catch the “Lone Ranger”. We reeled him in eventually on those flats and Jimmy greeted him as they were old mates from early Dusi days. Still competitive as ever Jimmy (to a lesser extent me) put the hammer down as Hank would say and as we pulled away I glimpsed a little smile from Charles who had ‘only’ 15 or so Umko notches on his paddle in those days. By dint of some puffing and panting our K2 drew away a short distance and I was already rehearsing my acceptance speech for my first beer at the finish as we lined up for the last rapid.\n\nNo Name rapid, I mean it must be a push-over! But the boat bounced off a hidden rock at the very top, we toppled out and swam down to the bottom of this fairly long rapid, and with me holding the tail of the K2 in the approved fashion, paddle gone on ahead, Charles Mason came through without missing a beat. He didn’t smile too broadly but it was written in body language all over his back.\n\nCharles is a great student of the Umko and he has a saying:- The Umko is a great leveller. I believe that too.\n\nSWIMMING MAKES YOU STRONG\n\nSome years ago Dickie Edwards and I were up in front of the whole field at the Umko prize-giving at RCC. We were charged with breaking the rules of the race and were facing disqualification if found guilty. This “Kangaroo Court” was presided over by Rob Davey and his assessor Ernie Alder. Standing there, shuffling our feet and looking worried I conferred with Dickie. The mob scented blood and were baying for ours so I said “Let’s plead guilty and throw ourselves on the mercy of the “Court”. Lucky for me Dickie had so many girlfriends in the “jury” that the “Judges’ reluctantly swayed in our favour. To the extent that we were presented with a clean pair of shorts each . Dickie of course nearly blew it by dropping his rods in front the crowd and putting the fresh ones on. (ed: Would that then be called a Member of the Jury?).\n\nThe reason was of course that the river was up on that fateful day and No.5&6 was declared a compulsory portage, for everybody!! We had set off with survival in mind and proceeded cautiously through all the big stuff in our trusty Accord. Just before the dreaded 5&6 there is a drop with a big wave train followed by a right-angle turn and another wave-train. The power of the current pushed us over to the far bank with us paddling frantically to make the turn which is where we fell out. Over the years we have fallen out so often that our swim gameplan went into action faultlessly. With me tugging the tail of the boat towards the right hand bank and Dickie clutching the paddles we looked downstream. The “finger of fate ” had just the tip showing above the surging water and it was a chilling sight. We were locked in the current and going very fast. Dickie was ahead of me and closer to the bank as we passed the last take-out point and the roar of the rapid was now deafening. At this point I was still capable of a half amused shout of “help” followed by a “heeeeelp” at a couple of paddlers on the portage, knowing that they would think I was mad. But heaven-sent help was at hand. There was Richard Starr in a Topolino kayak paddling up towards Dickie. “Hold on the back”says Richard ,”I’ll pull you to the bank” he shouts and sets off with “sea anchor Edwards” clinging on. In spite of Herculean efforts Richard was going nowhere, and looking over his shoulder saw that he was about to go through the right of the finger so I heard shouts of “Let go Dickie! Let go! Geroff, Geroff!”. Dickie swept off round the finger, never to be seen again, I thought.\n\nBy this stage I was approaching the finger like a torpedo aimed straight at the huge rock and the thought of being speared by my own boat was the decider and I pushed it away saying to myself, good luck boat you’re on your own. There is rumoured to be a bit of an undercut to the “Sentinel finger” which was on my mind now and without the boat it was very dark as I submerged about 2m from it. It seemed to take ages for the PFD to bring me up. On the way up there was the sensation of passing a noisy disturbance on my right but I did not touch anything.From there it was a hectic swim dodging rocks and holes but there at the bottom waiting for me was my slightly modified boat and my slightly modified partner. He was not in a forgiving mood and only once before did he tear a strip off me (that was higher up on the Umko at “Long Drop”). So we finished the race only to face the music for swimming through a compulsory portage. Nobody said that was against the rules. Hugh Raw\n\n————————–\n\nSome things stick in one’s mind and return as disturbing flashbacks, even to the minds of those of advancing years. The year of the Umko that KCC made us walk almost out of the valley to the camp set-up at the St. Elmos overnight stop (river right) was notable for being well above the high tide mark and one other thing.\n\nArriving there at midday with a slightly mistreated boat , it was not practical to start patching until the sun had lost its heat and besides the sponsors product was cold. Charles Mason and the Pope paddled together on that day and some time later Charles volunteered to put a patch under his seat (you broke it-you fix it principle) and left Popey holding court. Maybe the long walk to the pound or Charles’ namesake influenced his hot mix but it took ages to harden. So hot mix became quick fix.\n\nI was nearby patching my own boat with my partner sitting in a chair giving helpful advice when Charles came thundering through the group\n\nwith his flaming K2, heading down to the river,with a fair amount of black smoke billowing out behind. He had made the classic mistake of hastening the gelling process with the naked flame of a gas stove. I find nowadays, plastic boats make a lot of sense.\n\n————————————\n\nHi Pete I have a little anecdote about Ernie Alder. He runs a tight ship – always has, even when in the HR department in charge of pension matters at Durban Municipality.He is to this day the stalwart of KCC race organisers. This is no doubt because he is a stickler for accuracy in all he does. It was my cavalier approach to filling in race entry forms which brought me into direct conflict with this very direct man. I don’t know why it is but when the form requires answers to questions like SEX , I write Yes Please and under name of Medical Aid I write GOD. The phone rang pretty quick after that, “You haven’t completed the entry form – you are not entered in the race yet,” growled Ernie in his “nice” voice. “What is your Medical Aid’s phone number – you got a Hot Line upstairs?” So I supplied the missing info with lots of apologies and the phone went dead. On the morning of the race at Hella Hella start I cockily asked him if I could change my entry from a K2 to a K3. In those days a K3 was a nuisance and entry forms did not cater for them. So I supplied all the extra info and with the help of The Bearded One it was sorted out. In front of the amused crowd Ernie said, “Nibble my ear”, leaning in closer to me. “What for,” I spluttered . “Just nibble my ear. I like a bit of passion when I’m being f-cked around.” QED -Cheers -Hugh Raw\n\n——————————–\n\nAllie told me that (Hugh “user friendly” Raw) did riverbank repairs for years. So I asked him about it:\n\nHi Pete,\n\nBrain, what brain. Anyway I recall that my driver , a morose but reserved man named Lucas (‘cos I could not pronounce his Zulu moniker) served for many years as my second and learned all the overnight stops and routes to them. He became expert at loading and unloading the little Sprite caravan with drums of resin and bundles of itchy glassfibre and could help a bit with technical stuff like how much hardener to put in a beer-can of resin to achieve a reasonable setting time of 60 seconds. To compensate him for many week-ends away from his several wives I had to buy a fairly constant supply of sponsors product and yet the bakkie and caravan always got home in one piece. The one time that the caravan , loaded to the gunnels with heavy stuff, failed to arrive at the overnight camp was on Peter Krause’s farm, just 2 km down river from Josephines Bridge. The drawbar (a little bit rusted away) gave in completely and there it sat at a funny angle on this horrendous farm road blocking the traffic. Ernie Alder took over command and amazingly got every nut and bolt and all the urgently needed repair stuff out of the wreck and down to the pounds.\n\nIt was a very hot place and I am sure that the rumour that the resin was setting without addition of any hardener was false. What was true was that the chopper could not take off until dusk when it had cooled down a bit. That was the year that Kenny Reynolds squirted something horrible into our mouths from a sheep dosing unit carried on his back.\n\ncheers, -Hugh\n\n————————-\n\nHi Pete – I cant compete with Rob Davey but I can learn from him. The last couple of Umkos I paddled in an unbreakable plastic boat!!!!! I have walked out from no 5&6 at least once but not sure if it was a full Umko. I had good company though – Oscar , Herman, Tony Scott – all of them barefoot and bitching all the way to No 8.\n\n> Hugh\n\n————-\n\nThis is one of many memories I have of one of the great Umko characters, Jimmy Potgieter. He was the first ‘Iron Man”, so called by the ICF big wig who watched him pounding up Burma Road with his boat and with a good chance of winning that other less famous race. I met him after he had given up competitive racing in boats and was rehabilitating after a year spent as a professional punter. He lived on meat pies and brandy and coke while he hung around bars picking up tips and strategising the “big one”. He was as strong as an ox but mild and gentle in manner but quite “woes” when pushed. I saw what he could do to his friends in the pub so I guess he had no enemies.\n\nJimmy was good with novices, he won the Dusi with Clive Hough in 1968 but my story took place on the Umko in the late 1980s. We paddled at the back of the field on many occasions but one stands out. After patting ourselves on the back for surviving # 1 and # 2 our accord was in need of an empty so he turned the boat towards the bank on a quiet stretch of the river. As we drifted silently in , a large head popped out of the water just in front of us and then submerged as we drifted over it.\n\nTwo things happened simultaneously. Jimmy exploded out of his cockpit and nearly landed on my lap making puffing noises and I , trying to ease his distress said, “its ok Jim its just a leggevaan ” when I caught sight of big coils under the boat slowly moving away in the current. Beautiful colouring told me what it was and what I saw was a girth as big as my thigh. Jimmy ,the victor of many a bar fight was difficult to get back in the boat still breathing heavily and desperate for a smoke. There was quiet for a while in the boat and then Jimmy spoke to no one in particular , ” I dont care what it was, it was bigger than me “.\n\n~~~oo0oo~~~\n\nI’m trying to think of the word.\n\nIgnominious.\n\nYes that would describe very neatly, my first taste of the Umkomaas.\n\n‘Twas a hot Summers day in late 1978 and the water flowed strong and brown. This was the ‘easy’ stretch of the river and as we stood at the start our conversation was along these lines:\n\n“I thought you were getting the buoyancy?!”\n\n“No you were supposed to get it!”\n\nSo with no buoyancy and no lifejackets we paddled off at the start of the No.8 to Josephine Race. The direction of the water has changed since then – the river turned sharp right into what is now the dry water course and into a big drop that buried the boat and spat us out. The Accord quickly filled with water and sunk like a brick. My first taste of swimming in the Umko. To Hell with the boat, I thought, just let me get to the bank without drowning.\n\nWe recovered the battered K2 and were foolish enough to attempt the next rapid. More swimming and to add to that, humiliation, as there was an audience on the bank including some pretty girls!\n\nSo from there we carried the remains of the boat down the river valley to Josephine’s arriving at the bridge many hours later. I have forgotten how we managed to cross the river but remember being constantly afraid. At the finish, tails between legs and more humiliation – an old girlfriend witnessed our sorry arrival – we bumped into another Umko newcomer in the process of completing the sale of his paddle and spraydeck.\n\n“Had enough of this shit” he said “And if you think these rapids were bad, you should see the rapids on day two of the Dusi!!”\n\nI resisted the temptation to follow suit and the rest, as they say in the Classics, is history. We went on to achieve some modest success in years to come but the sound of that big brown water still never fails to ignite the stomach – as Charlie says of the drive down to Hella-Hella- “There’s no better laxative!”\n\n~~oo0oo~~\n\nAFTER THE FLOODS – HELLA HELLA REVISITED (by Geoff Caruth)\n\n“The summer of ’89” sounds like a good title for a book and perhaps I’ll be inspired enough to write it one day. But getting back to my opening words (which are not the title of a book incidentally) the summer of ’89 saw my arrival on the Hella Hella bridge in the middle of said summer in the company of my redoubtable Kingfisher Comrades Mountford, Mellor and Bland, and ’twas not the summer heat’ alone that made the sweat trickle down our spines. The river was flowing strongly – a good 4ft by the old standard, and mindful of the many stories of drastic changes since the floods we entered the river with fluttering hearts and disturbed bowels. The first change was encountered not 100m from the bridge where a new T-junction rapid waited ready to catch the unwary. Whilst not too much of a problem in itself it could prove tricky with several dozen boats trying to take the inside line in unison! Shades of things to come! The Approach rapids were vaguely similar to the pre-flood river but with channels and boulders re-arranged.\n\nNo. 1 itself had changed little but with a sharper drop in from the left. The waves down the centre were as brutal as ever and concentration was the order of ‘the day. The pool below No. I gave us time to admire the magnificent valley with its pristine bush and sheer cliffs, but our admiration time was limited as the new Umkomaas had its first surprise in store for us not 30 seconds down the drag. Hugh and Graham led the way into what we remembered as the “Bubbly” before No. 2 and promptly disappeared over a big drop into an equally big hole. Pete and I followed tail walkingly through the new o. “If’. No. 2 lay ahead and remembering that it had been made a compulsory portage in the last Hella Hella race, we all got out and had a good look.\n\nNo. 2 is now one of the trickiest rapids on this stretch and should definitely not be shot “blind”. After much discussion fearless “Pete the Pom” Mountford picked a line and shot the beast relatively easily. However, there is little room for error with only one narrow passage from the left to centre with big trouble looming either side. The next few km’s saw several new rapids all with sharper drops and deeper holes requiring careful line picking.\n\nNo. 4 is another rapid that has acquired a sharper, meaner edge. We shot it on the right through a narrow rock- infested roller coaster shute that almost succeeded in unseating the Pom and it was agreed that No. 4 now ranks as one of the hardest tests on the river.\n\nWe all got out at No. 5 & 6 and stood high on the rocks that loom above this breaker of boats and hopes. 5 & 6 to me embody the spirit of this brooding wild section of river and remains the ultimate test of skill and luck. After much debate the singles paddlers decided to attempt a sneak on the left. Things don’t go according to plan and we both got dragged into the main stream with Pete skirting a high twisting wave and narrowly avoiding a swim but yours truly ploughing into same and biting the dust. No. 6 is not a pleasant place to swim.\n\nThereafter the valley opens out and whilst you can never relax completely, the river becomes less technical and more enjoyable. At the risk of melodrama and repetition it must be said again that the valley is magnificent with spectacular waterfalls and a wild raw African beauty that combined with the adrenalin as you roller-coaster down No. 8 makes the whole a most spiritual experience.\n\nUnfortunately as the road to Riverside is still out of commission, the 1989 Umkomaas will start below this stretch of river. In some respects this is a good thing as the Hella Hella – No. 8 section is now definitely the most technical non-plastic stretch of water in the SA Canoe calendar and as such would probably have demolished half the field (2 out of 3 of our boats would not have made the first day).\n\nYet Hella Hella is part of the great Umkomaas tradition and hopefully the section will be included next year. So gird your loins and stick your courage to the sticking post for 1990!\n\n~~oo0oo~~\n\nA small anecdote..\n\nTrue Story..\n\nOne of the races in the early 90’s. I was paddling with Pete Mountford. We approached the potentially tricky No.7 and had just negotiated the “Dragons Teeth” on the exit when we suddenly lost the rudder. We managed to get the boat to the bank and quickly identified the problem via Pete’s better-than-my eyes. For those of you who do not know No.7, it is a fairly isolated and uninhabited spot. Pete said ”We need a short length of wire”. We had nothing in the boat and our chances of getting some close by were non-existent. I looked down to stare at my feet as one often does in such moments. My face blanched in disbelief. Lying between my tackies was a short length of galvanised wire in the desert of sand and stone! I picked it up and said to Pete-“Will this do?!” He stared back and his jaw dropped. We both looked skyward! We quickly fixed the rudder and paddled on.\n\nSometimes it is really hard not to believe in Divine Intervention!\n\n. . give these fools some . . . wire . .\n\n—————————————————–\n\n(From 1997 program)\n\nTheirs not to reason why\n\nThere is a hidden spot a few hundred metres from the Hella-Hella bridge, a shallow depression in the African bush where beetles and birds are companions and the roar of the river is softened to a ‘muted whoosh by the curtain of thorn\n\ntrees. There, I am wont to wander before the start of the marathon and enjoy a moment’s peace from the tension before the race. – Last year, as the river rose, I was tempted to stay there. Undiscovered. No one would miss a lone canoeist in the bobbing orange coated throng that slipped gingerly into the seething Umkomaas. I could always say I fell asleep, lulled by the insect\n\ndrones in my shady spot and missed the start. “Oh damn – what a disappointment – I’ll just have to go home and drink Kahlua,” or “Gosh – my paddle\n\nhas a crack in it! My splash cover’s torn! I have a splitting headache. I’ve nothing to prove to anyone – so wah!”\n\nLet us pause for a moment of honest reflection. It’s the fear really, isn’t it?\n\nYes, it’s the fear. The Umkomaas does that to you. The excuses are convenient lifeboats that we may clutch to physically or at least yearn for secretly\n\neven as we take the plunge on that epic adventure. So why do we do it? Ah, the meaning of life! The desire to be a hero, and a hero you will be if you finish the Kahlua (the race that is – not the drink in your hand). Some say of course that there is no heroism, no cowardice. Just survival. Rational choices. Egotistic trade-offs. Instinctive, impulsive, drugged or forced reactions. The heroes\n\nat Rorkes Drift fought so well because they had no choice. If they chose cowardice, they chose death! So much for heroism! In the Umko you can\n\nchoose not to do the race. If you choose to do it, you value the recognition beyond the cost in fear and pain.\n\nYou can’t call yourself a paddler till you’ve done the Umkomaas!\n\nDeepdale to Hella-Hella!\n\nThrombi Gorge!\n\nThe Umgeni flood of ’87!\n\nThe limit moves forward – Kevlar Knights\n\nAfter a few years of Umko’ing one tends to get blasé about the achievement. In fact, some see the Kahlua Umkomaas as a relatively tame event – guys like Alex Rennie and Rowan Sampson – Springbok slalomists whose skill and nerve test\n\nthe outer limits. Yet they are the single digit handful and their achievements are\n\nakin to climbing Everest or running the four minute mile. The Kahlua Umkomaas remains the supreme long distance canoeing challenge, an experience in which only a tiny fraction of the population at large can ever share, with\n\nall its fears and thrills and high adventure. Even with our feet of clay, if you finish the Umko you are a cut above the batting, bowling, jogging masses.\n\nWorthy of recognition.\n\nA Kevlar (or perhaps Nylon) Knight of the Umkomaas.\n\n~~oo0oo~~\n\nREFLECTIONS – 1997 program (Caruth was credited for photographs and articles)\n\nSo China, you want to paddle the Umko?\n\nMy first encounter with said river was back in 1978. The canoe calendar of the\n\nday described the 8 to Josephines section as “an easy stretch of fast flowing\n\nwater!”. As we arrived at No 8, even my rookie eye could see that this was a very different river. The other omens also were not good – the river was full and my partner and I had the following conversation before the start – “You were\n\nsupposed to bring the buoyancy!”. “NO ways – I thought you were bringing it!”.\n\nAnyway, we entered the river without buoyancy or lifejackets and after two horrendous swims, carried the remains of our double to the finish. I almost packed up paddling after this debacle, yet persevered. But it took me almost a year\n\nto pluck up the courage to paddle the river again. By degree I graduated to the Hella-Hella stretch and then the full marathon and have since been\n\nprivileged to experience this river in its many moods. There have been many highlights and some tragedies. The marathon of 1982 marked the return to Hella- Hella and that of 1987 saw the river at the start, rise from a tame 2 foot\n\nto a chocolate brown, gut churning, poo-inducing 7 foot in the space of 15 minutes.\n\nThe light hearted chatter died back somewhat and there wasn’t any great rush to enter the water as the gun sounded!\n\nBut enough of this anecdotal banter – let’s get to the bottom line. The Umkomaas marathon has to be South Africa’s ultimate test of long distance rough water ability. It takes the use of what are essentially modified sprint boats to the\n\nabsolute edge of these and their paddlers competence. Champion Whitewater\n\npaddlers from Europe have been amazed at how South Africans use boats that most people have serious difficulty balancing on flat water, in rapids that test even the skill of Whitewater and plastic kayakers. Add to this some of the world’s\n\nmost spectacular scenery. Set in the incredible, almost indefinable African atmosphere of the Umkomaas and you have what should be recognised as one of the worlds great sporting events.\n\nSo to those who are contemplating tackling this great river, I say DO IT! Big Lifejackets, helmets, lots of buoyancy, a big pomp and lots of respect for the river are all you need (plus a little training and some river skills) – it’s not as unreachable a goal as some might have you believe and the reward of finishing this event is something you will never forget.\n\nP.S. Kahlua’s Lekker!\n\n~~oo0oo~~\n\nHANSA CANOE MARATHON\n\nCRUSADE OF THE KEVLAR KNIGHTS\n\nby GeoffCaruth (NB: OCT-scanned – needs work)\n\n“Frodo heard San muttering and groaning -‘What a place! What a terrible place! Just let me get out of this boat and I’ll never wet my toes in a\n\npuddle again, let alone a river!’\n\n‘Fear Not!’ said a strange voice behind.\n\nFrodo turned and saw Aragon, son of Arathorn, proud and erect, guiding the boat with skilful strokes, his dark hair blowing in the wind, a light in his eyes, a king returning from exile to his own land.”\n\n(Lord of the Rings – The Great River)\n\nIt has a mystery that no other canoe marathon in this land can match. It is wild with the beauty of old Africa. It can be hot and dry and boney, and\n\ntest a man to the limits of his endurance. It can be big and brown and terrifying, and gnaw at his courage and tax his skill. It is the best. It is the\n\nUmkomaas.\n\nWhy the best? Sure, the rapids are the biggest and most numerous of any of our marathons: so it follows that as a test of skill this one is the one on which you earn your paddling wings (excuse the mixed metaphors). But this is not the complete answer. Its “bestness” goes beyond the rapids, beyond its scenic beauty. Its “bestness” lies in its atmosphere which is unique and alive with pent-up danger. It is difficult to describe this on paper. You’ll know what I mean though, when you power your way through the big weir at the finish. The Umkomaas is a continuing legend. The Umkomaas is a crusade where we ordinary mortals in our safari suits become knights of St George, Riders to Agadir, Texans at\n\nAlamo – pick your own image. The Duzi, Berg, Vaal etc., great events that they are, simply do not compare. This is a last frontier, a real challenge: and not one without purpose, for it is an area that needs all the fierce partisan protection it can get. Specifically, we must fight to get this whole magnificent river and its valley preserved for all time.\n\nAn unrealistic goal? Not at all. It can be done. Read on . . .\n\nThe key to the survival of the Umkomaas lies in the Conservancy system. What is a conservancy? A conservancy is an area where an existing\n\necosystem is managed and maintained on sound conservation principles.\n\nIt is an area where agriculture, habitation and wildlife co-exist and co-operate. It is a compromise between the extreme protection afforded by a proclaimed wilderness area and the realities of man’s needs on this planet. In other words the following conversation is unlikely to happen in the future:\n\nﻡ؛؟MR CANOEIST: “Please, Minister, declare the whole of the Umkomaas\n\na wild River.”\n\nMR MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT: “O.K. Fred- no problem, it’s all yours.”\n\nSo what is the next best thing? ANSWER: The Umkomaas River National Conservancy.\n\nLet’s look at the valley. Already large areas in the\n\nUmkomaas are run as game farms or mixed game/agriculture estates.\n\nMany sections, including some in Kwa Zulu, are very rugged, inaccessi-\n\nble and totally unsuited to farming or subsistence habitation. The Natal\n\nParks Board run several areas and participate in an existing conservancy\n\nin the valley. The river is undammed from its source in the majestic Berg\n\nto its muddy end on the Natal South Coast, and as such is virtually the\n\nonly major river in the country free of these horrendeous silt traps. So\n\nhere is the ideal candidate for the country’s first “wild” river.\n\nYou may ask why we need to have it proclaimed? The answer is\n\nsimple. We need the voice of South Africans of every creed and colour,\n\nfrom all walks of life. We need not only the Dr. Ian Players, but the John\n\nSmiths, the Piet Prinsloos, the Simon Nxumalos and the Bobby Naidoos.\n\nWe need them to band together in care and concern for this hauntingly\n\nbeautiful valley and say enough is enough! We must save the little that is\n\nleft! We need to look at overcrowded Europe and see how they officially\n\nconserve more than 10% of their beautiful continent, whilst we only\n\nmanage 2″h. We need to see how particular they are in their “National\n\nParks” (which are in reality almost all conservancies) in blending the ar-\n\nchitecture of their natural heritage and history into these areas. The Swiss\n\nChalet, the Tudor mansion, the stone cottage and winding lane all weave\n\nan intricate tapestry that tells of and reflects a nation’s pride in its envi-\n\nronment. We need to develop a sense of the aesthetic, dammit!! The\n\nUmkomaas conservancy will have sections of truly wild river like the Jo-\n\nsephine’s Bridge – Riverside section – where our sons and our sons’ sons\n\nwill be able to know what it is like to s..t themselves as they approach a\n\nbig rapid in an untamed river. It will have areas settled by Zulus in\n\nthatched and beehive huts and where Zulu South Africans will be able to\n\ndisplay the beauty and majesty of their African Culture .\n\nIt will have controlled hunting areas, river raft trips, catchment protec-\n\ntion zones, and above all, the feel of old Africa. A Dream? Maybe. It de-\n\npends on what we want. What we value in life. The answer to these ques-\n\ntions is-in essence-what the Crusade of the Kevlar Knights is all about.\n\n~~oo0oo~~\n\nTHE KEVLAR KNIGHTS: THE CRUSADE CONTINUES\n\n– by GEOFF CARUTH\n\nThe Sabre lunged forward and for a moment, a fraction of a second, seemed dead still, frozen, framed as in a motor driven whirr, click, stop, suspended above the huge hole at the bottom of number eight. All was strangely silent but for the franticc flicking of my blades momentarily thrashing through the air, deprived of water, like a fish open-mouthed on dry land. Then, and I know the cliche is overworked, but all hell broke loose and the boat crashed down, down, down, to meet an explosion of white water, yes, the water was white, not brown, as is the Umkos normal raging colour, and the sound was like a huge dump truck, disgorging a 100-ton load, whoosh, crash, roar, madness and\n\nmomentarily covered and underwater and then again a brief silence, like the silence of the underwater shots on T.V., the occasional bubble, blooping and breaking the peace.\n\nI feel amazingly calm, dreamlike, holding the paddle horizontally, balancing the boat. A brief instant, and then as if this great mouth has tasted me and decided I am bitter, spits me, nay, heaves me out, and we (that is the boat and me, for we are a team, she has a personality) crash through the foam and my face glistens and has that open mouthed, dazed, slightly shocked look, (you’ll know what I mean if you’ve paddled through this), and the blue nose slices and thrusts phallic upwards and the blades break free and shed water in slow motion and muscles strain and pull grinding and expanding and still we go upwards as a Satum rocket, trailing a great plume of white and slowly settling, we latch onto the current and after shrugging off a brief disorienting sideways tug from the eddy, the style and straight arms retum and a smile slowly creases my face, the Hallelujah chorus rings in my ears, or is it the finale from the 1812, all cannons and bells ringing joyously. The music at the top though was the theme from Jaws.\n\nEngineers have studied several possible sites for the dam, including one in the Staebraes area, which would extend up river past the area known as No. 8 rapid, and have a capacity of a billion atsecs and provide water for a zillion more households, meeting the needs of the greater Durban Metropolitan area for another three years, after which a pipeline and massive pumping station could be constructed through the rock face about 5kms below the Josephines bridge in a feat of unparalled engineering skill and employing 10 000 people who would be accommodated in neat tin and asbestos huts on top of the cliff face, serviced by a new road cutting directly across the escarpment involving the blasting of a trillion tons of rock and the construction of 99 culverts and bridges using 60 000 tons of cement and enough reinforcing steel to stretch to the moon and back and …\n\nthat gorge is unbelievable – pristine wilderness, comparable to anything in the world – no roads, no people, no buildings, just vast beautiful forest and high cliffs and bushbuck barking and loeries popping and fish jumping and creepers hanging and dripping clear water. Its atmosphere soaks through you. It is a life raft in a world gone wrong.\n\nA lovely place for a factory. I tell you man, there’s room for a huge complex down there. If these rock samples are anything to go by, we could be mining and producing 10 N)0 tons by lW’and there’s labour for Africa and water and by the time the main road goes through, well there could be 20 0N people living in Bogtown by 1988.\n\nOver my dead body will they build a dam here!\n\nYou okes will cry when the next drought comes round and you can’t fill your pools – you’ve got to think ahead man!\n\nThere’s too many people – we’ve got to tackle the population problem then the rest will solve itself.\n\nPaint the bloody thing green then it will blend in with the surroundings.\n\nThe noise? You get used to the noise.\n\nAfter we broke the boat we walked through the bush until it got dark.\n\nSure we were disappointed but hell that valley is something – not a soul around us and as the sun set there was no artificial light at all just the moon reflecting faintly on the river – eerie but beautiful.\n\nWhat are you bitching about? It will be magic for sprinting, yachting,\n\npower boating and you’ll still have plenty of white water below the dam.\n\nThe Crusade Continues.\n\n————————————-\n\nThe Course and its changes over 50 Years.\n\nAs this mighty event celebrates its 50th Anniversary it is worth remembering that the Race format has changed many times over half a Century-changes sometimes planned but often wrought by Nature!\n\nSo, let us take a trip down the Umkomaas from the extremities..\n\nThe highest point at which the event has started lies a few hundred metres upstream of the Hella-Hella Bridge and the lowest point at which it has finished is a few metres short of the Indian Ocean at the old Umkomaas Ski boat Club. The race has varied in length from approximately 150 kms(in the days when men were men!) to just over 60 kilometres and has been run over 2 and 3 days with many permutations with overnight stops including Hella Hella(from the current back to front format) to Josephine’s Bridge(no such place as St. Josephine’s BridgeJ) 3 sites from Josephine’s to StElmo’s and Riverside Store,Old Campsite and Mpompomani!\n\nThe food at these venues has varied from barely edible flatulence inducing to almost Cordon Bleu but I digress-let us take an imaginary trip…\n\nFrom the Bridge at Hella Hella in the old days before the 1987 floods 6 foot at the marker or water over the old iron bridge below meant a hairy river! Above that the river cut the corner after the first pool and in one race we all followed the Pope down this “sneak” to witness the Master taking a big goof in the approaches. Old No. 1 had it’s biggest waves in the second drop until the massive Flood of ’87 moved the Rapid one stop upstream to it’s present location. No 2. was a fast Foofie Slide where things happened so quickly you didn’t get a second chance. Again after 1987 the channel widened considerably. No.5 and 6.-essentially one rapid despite the name could be snuck most of the way well on the right under full conditions until said Flood scoured the main channel leaving this dry water course well and truly dry even in big water. The other major change was at No. 8 where the river moved a hundred metres to the right. Old Number 8 was a humdinger where the single main drop started off gently and steadily increased in gradient finishing in a series of giant stoppers. The pool below sucked many a canoe to a watery grave never to be seen again. The Legendary Charlie Mason lost a boat here in the only time in.. starts that he failed to finish!\n\nThe stretch to Josephine’s saw several less dramatic changes.\n\nBelow Josephine’s we enter one of Africa’s most scenic and dramatic valleys with towering cliffs and Virgin Forests where only the paddler has access to this secret Wilderness. The Rapids are virtually non-stop but milder than the poo inducing Hella Hella stretch.\n\nThe names-Arthurs,Old Buck,Captain Honks………. reflect the experiences of the pioneers. After Riverside the valley becomes more populated and the flat stretches longer but with some serious drops in between. Whirlpool has punished some of the best in the land-our late beloved Pope had a bad swim there and luminaries such as Springbok former winner Chris Greef and ace Shaun Rice both had dramatic goofs caught on film by SABC”s TV crew with the latter performing an amazing eskimo roll in his K2.\n\nMen were men!\n\nThen there was the Waterfall-an enormous drop shot by mistake once with only one broken toe by way of injury.The portage on the left was the recommended line! Further on came Mpompomani with its difficult approach and the river funnelling into a narrow spout spilling out in a series of big stoppers.\n\nGulley was a long tricky rapid in a vast field of bedrock, with several sneaks including one near the top of the main drop-but if you missed it…!! Sadly Peter Marlin drowned here in the race of 1988.\n\nJust below Gulley came the ironically named No Name Rapid-a notorious boat breaker. If you survived this then a couple of kilometres downstream came the Finish to top all the various finishes- at Goodenoughs Weir. The crowd of supporters and seconds stood like spectators at the Forum in ancient Rome with craned necks waiting for the next gladiators to be slaughtered. There was only one spot to shoot it and the survival rate was about 50:50!\n\nThereafter the river mellowed and the challenge was aching bones and dry mouths and the endless sandbanks-unless of course you could read the river and find the channels to avoid the dreaded sound of sandpaper on the hull.\n\nAnd the sea and relief in sight.\n\nTo paraphrase Churchill – Some River, Some Trek!\n\n—————————————————————–\n\nOrigin of 5&6 being called “Robbie’s Special”\n\nI was about 14 when I lost my first boat in Robbie’s – the silly thing was paul had said: “Whatever you do don’t shoot 5 & 6 – wait for me” So being a well behaved, obedient young chap I came round this corner and realised “Oh sh1t! that looks like a real rapid” so I tried to get out on a sloping rock on the left hand side – of course when I jumped out onto the sloping rock and tried to lift my kayak I slid into the water and had a swim of all swims down the main drop of (later to be called Robbie’s Special) the rapid. My brand new kayak got wedged under the big rock in the middle – one of the very first but not the last – never to be seen again!\n\nLuckily one of the JKCC guys had also come to grief somewhere nearby – it was either Peter Gladwin or Dereck Antrobus – and he and I set off downstream carrying what was left of his Kayak. I had lost one shoe – so there I was set to walk about 10km over the hills with one shoe. Luckily about a kilometre downstream one of the umfaans on the bank was wearing my other shoe and very kindly gave it back to me.\n\nOne of my enduring memories of the Umkomaas in those days was how friendly the locals were despite all that was going on in South Africa at the time.\n\nWe ended up later that afternoon drinking “Zulu” beer with a guy called Mackenzie and his mates – in the typical manner – all seated on the ground in a circle passing the clay pot around.\n\nI only lost/broke one other kayak at Robbie’s but do swim it a few times I think.\n\nThe second time I broke my boat – we had to race in pairs in those days – so although I was still a schoolboy (about 17) I was paddling with Paul Chalupsky. He left me to make my own way to No 8 and when I got to the end I discovered that Paul and Poppa had left me to get a lift home with Charlie Mason.\n\n————————\n\nOr as Rowan Rasmussen tells it:\n\nAs I understand it the 5&6 drop ended up being called Robbie’s Special after Rob insisted on swimming rather than paddling through that obstacle. He was a young guy being shepherded down the top section with Paul Chalupsky who explained the right way to do it. Being young and knowing better, it seems Rob made his own plans and after wrapping and swallowing loads of Umkomaas a few times, they decided he needed to be forever reminded of his frailty and incompetence by having this section as a permanent reminder to him and all who followed, that nobody is bigger and better than the river.\n\n. . . or something like that!!!\n\n—————————————\n\nRobbie continues:\n\nI had in the years prior to that done trips down the Umkomaas with the KCC guys ( I think in the year before the first Marathon) – who were always good to me I and as the Duzi was what I really wanted to do I swapped to KCC.\n\nI did my first Duzi as a Dragon and maybe even my second – but then I changed to KCC – I think the last race I did with Paul was the catalyst for my move to KCC.\n\nThe Umkomaas after that was my first race as a KCC member.\n\nFuller version:\n\nHi Pete,\n\nIt is a long story.\n\nI had been a Dragon’s member since I was 13 and can remember being on the bank at Sand Grabs cheering Paul and his partner Robbie Knudsen.\n\nThey came second and there was some tension and I don’t think that Robbie was seen in a Kayak again.\n\nSo some years later I was still at school but paddling reasonably well Paul needed a partner for the Hella Hella Joshaphine’s race. Needless to say I wrapped my Kayak for the second (and last time) in Robbie’s special and walked out with Dereck Antrobus and Henry Dudley. That was the time when I retrieved my shoe from a youngster (I don’t know whether “Umfaan” is still politically correct?) about two kilometres below Robbie’s and I think Dereck found his Kayak at about the same time and decided to paddle the wreck to the end. Peter and I ended up sharing Zulu beer above No.8 with a guy called Campbell and his friends. By the time I got to the end Papa Schultz and Paul had left and the KCC guys gave me a lift home.\n\nThat was the final straw – I had been on the traditional KCC Easter trip down the Umkomaas and the KCC guys had always been friendly and were all Duzi paddlers which I wanted to do. Before my first Duzi which I raced in Dragon’s colours Charlie and Tank Rogers had given my partner and I lifts to do trips on the Duzi, so I had decided to join KCC and arrived at the start of the with my own Kayak but in KCC gear. Quite rightly Papa pointed out that I was still a Dragon’s member so I had to change shirts. It was no big deal to me and I think it was quite a wet Umko so I was very happy to be sleeping the Dragon’s tent. Paul and Papa were always good to me – so was Paul’s mom who always had some Strudel for me when we arrived back at Papa’s place.\n\nBut the rest is history – because of the Duzi and the number of trips I had done on the Duzi and Umkomaas with the KCC guys I did join KCC but then later started the Durban section of the University of Natal Canoe Club (which started under the KCC banner) so I raced for Natal Uni for quite a few years and then back to KCC.\n\nThinking back – it is one of the things I miss – I have paddled a lot with my boys – mainly in the sea here – but I really regret not having taken them down the Umkomaas for the first time.\n\nKeep well, Regards Robbie\n\n(Robbie later told a slight twist in the tale of the change from being a Dragon to becoming a Kingfisher ca.1966: He wanted to paddle the Umko race, but didn’t want to use his Duzi boat; Charles Mason loaned him a boat to paddle in; He then arrived at the race in a black T-shirt – BUT – he was still a member of the fiery Dragons! Paul or Papa objected and he had to change his shirt! – So that was probly his last race in a Dragons shirt).\n\n———————————————————————————-\n\nOn the left in No.8:\n\nRobbie: “Paddle Rowan!”\n\nRowan: “I can’t paddle I’m in a tree!”\n\n——————————————–\n\nGreat Stuff Rory!!\n\nThose were the days.\n\nI don’t remember ever being scared – we thought we were bullet proof!\n\nPoor Rowan had no say in where we went – it was down the middle every rapid!\n\nDo you remember the night Papa Schultz chased Ken Willan with a hammer? – it was either a 4lb hammer or a rubber mallet – he used it for knocking in his tent pegs. Ken was lucky Papa tripped over the same guy rope Ken had – I just remember Ken crawling away at high speed while Papa was prostrate on the ground.\n\nOr the time on the second day Dave Biggs came in half way down the field on his Lilo after breaking his boat?\n\nAnd the classic when Val MacWade and Julie Worlock were having a drink down in the Lido pre the Prize Giving- the function area with the windows that opened on to the side of the pool. The boys were skinny dipping – and I can remember meeting a very irate Val storming out of the Pub. What had happened is that you could only see the bottom half of the guys and Julie said to Val – “Look there’s Trevor” – Val took one look and said “HOW DO YOU KNOW”! Trevor was not called a donkey for nothing but I think it was his freckly legs that gave him away.\n\nThose were the days!\n\n——————————————-\n\nRowan, Remember coming round the corner into that long straight on the second day (still in 1972) and we saw the long splash right across the river? It was the cable from the punt that was dragging in the water, getting pulled downstream, then releasing and flying 20’ into the air and then come crashing down again with a huge splash. It would have cut a person, let alone a boat, in half!\n\nAnd who should be midstream, swimming with their boat but Trevor MacWade and Denis Banks? Heading straight for the cable! We offered to help but could not do much the river was going too fast – and we were winning the race at that stage and had ourselves to worry about. We headed straight for the pole supporting the cable and went under it there. It was a bit tense!\n\nAlso do you remember seeing what looked like washing draped on the grass on the bank but it was Charlie Mason and his squad hanging onto the grass watching us go past – probably to see where we went.\n\nProbably the most exciting three days of our lives!\n\nClearly remember the noise of the rocks rolling down the river bed – particularly in that first big rapid after Josephine’s. And having to be careful not to paddle into a barbed wire fence if you were cutting a corner.\n\nAnd Porky puking at the start of the second day when he saw me in a life jacket. He was still a schoolboy and I was the only person who had a life jacket, I think, but I only put it on because the waves had been knocking my breath out. We were hitting them so hard on the first day that I decided to wear it on the second day.\n\nRoly Alborough lost his boat at the overnight stop – the river had come up so much that it had got washed away!\n\nRowan and I led the race almost to the last bridge before Umkomaas. Scottie and Paul were paddling better than Rowan and I then, but by taking the tiger line on every rapid we were well ahead until we hit a bloody big rock in that last big rapid before the weir – I think we called it House Rock – I went through my footrest which meant that steering was a bit of a challenge. The only mistake we made in the race was not shooting Goodenough’s Weir – I can remember being at the bottom and jumping up and down to see if we could see Paul and Scottie – no sign of them but we struggled in the flat water after the weir with all the swirls in the river. Scottie and Paul caught us not far from the end and beat us by less than a minute.\n\nA couple of years later Pete Peacock and I were again in a good position to win the race but on the second day our boat packed up – an Accord built for the Duzi – the gunwales were too thin for the Umko and gave in.\n\nI didn’t have any luck in the Umko but we had a lot of fun.\n\nI also made a tactical error racing my Sabre on the Waterfall race in the lead up to the Umko. I should have tried it out in secret because after I did that race all the other guys decided to race in their Sabres in the marathon and I lost the advantage.\n\nI remember in that race a bunch of us were approaching Goodenough’s weir together and Clive Curson was not sure where to go – we had all slowed down doing the “swan neck” craning our necks trying to see what was on the other side when Clive got too close to the drop turned round to try to paddle away and shot the weir backwards! Being good friends we all shot the weir and paddled off leaving Clive swimming on his own.\n\nOne of the best feature of the Umkomaas was the overnight stops – the camaraderie from the shared experience was amazing. Everyone had been through a lot of excitement and was pretty hyped up!\n\n———————\n\nHey Rowan,\n\nI was just reflecting that you were a very trusting (or very stupid) friend to follow me down those rapids. You had no choice but to hang on and hope for the best.\n\nOn balance your timing is amazing taking into account that we were literally fighting for our lives.\n\nThose were the days!\n\n——————————————\n\nHi guys,\n\nI have just said to Rowan that it was the most exciting three days of paddling I had in my life!\n\nDo you remember the tension of not wanting to cut the corner too much in case you came upon a barbed wire fence in your way?\n\nThat cable across the river – the most spectacular hazard I have seen on a river.\n\nGoing round the falls – pushing our luck drop by drop, waiting to get stuck or it to look too scary – and suddenly we were at the bottom without having to get out!\n\nWas I disappointed we didn’t win? – now 35 years later I am – but at the time it was such a rush that anyone who got to the end in one piece was a winner.\n\nThe Accord that Rowan and I had built for the Duzi that year was a wonderful boat � �� when we hit House Rock it came to a dead stop I think I even came off my seat – any other boat would have folded � � the foot rest didn’t break but I think the stainless steel (maybe they were aluminium?) brackets at the side bent. The gunwales were about 25mm x 25mm Geleton the footrests were hardwood – the bottom was lined with Vinylon and it weighed almost spot on the Duzi weight limit.\n\nIt was built in my folks garage in Stirling Crescent with Vanilla Fudge and the Woodstock LP playing.\n\nThey were good days.\n\nRegards, – Robbie\n\n—————————–\n\nHi Pete, Sorry this is late but I think it is a picture of the first Hella Hella Josephine’s Race.\n\nHope the quality is OK – I will see if my daughter-in-law can scan a jpeg edition of the picture.\n\nYou can see Mercia, paul and Papa Chalupsky – forgotten the Dragon guy they are talking to but I think the chap with his head in a boat is Rob Knudsen – Paul would have to confirm.\n\nCharlie will have to help with the KCC guys names but I think it is Hamish Gerard with a Andy Cap type hat with his back to the picture on the left of the KCC group.\n\nI think it could be the day that we left before the race started because Paul got the mutters because they were waiting for some of the other paddlers to arrive. They were well mannered in those days and would wait for people they knew were on the way!\n\nIf it is then I think one of the boats in the front was mine which later in the morning I posted at Robbie’s Special.\n\nI am not in the picture – probably in the bush releasing the tension.\n\nRegards – Robbie\n\n——————————\n\nUMKO 1993 1 2917 R HERREVELD N EVANS WITS 03:14:01.00 04:24:52.00
