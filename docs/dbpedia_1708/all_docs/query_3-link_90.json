        "text": "~\n\nAll of the international flights from the Americas dumped into Aéroport Paris–Charles de Gaulle within minutes of each other, as they usually do, when I arrived in the early morning a few months ago. I shuffled into the immigration hall along with the deplaning masses, a shapeless hoard that defied order, especially since very little was provided.\n\nAfter a half hour of this incurable chaos, with border guards barking at us like sheep dogs at a herd, and our rather saucy herd barking back in various languages, the crowd suddenly began to move forward at a surprisingly fast rate. How could this be? How could the border police possibly be processing that many passports at once? When I reached the front, I realized that they weren’t. They weren’t processing passports at all. The police had opened the gates and were letting everyone through unchecked.\n\nAs an American, who has not only practiced law, but has practiced some immigration law, I was horrified. This kind of reckless laxity would never happen at our borders – and this not from a sense of patriotic superiority. The United States has many weaknesses, but border control – especially at its international airports – is not one of them. You will not find more humorless human beings than the employees of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nBy allowing foreigners to pass through unverified, the French police were not only endangering their own national security by opening their borders to shady international characters, but they were also putting the Schengen at risk. Once inside the Schengen, a foreigner can travel through any of its twenty-some member countries unchecked, as I did on this trip.\n\nA little over a week later, as I prepared to return to the U.S., Malaysian Airlines flight 370 disappeared over the South China Sea, raising questions (among many others) about two passengers onboard who were traveling with stolen passports. In the weeks since, those two passengers have been ruled out as possible terrorists. But the fact that they were able to travel on stolen passports is disturbing. According to Interpol, “In 2013, passengers were able to board planes more than 1 billion times without having their travel documents checked against Interpol’s data.”\n\nThat’s billion with a “B.”\n\n~\n\n~\n\nAt Gare du Nord (and some other stations), the Paris Metro ticket vending machines do not accept cash anymore, and now only accept credit cards with smart chip technology, which requires a PIN code for added security. Like me, most Americans don’t have smart chip credit cards (which is why an estimated 100 million Americans were put at risk when Target’s credit and debit card database was compromised). This is one sector of security in which the U.S. is terribly behind – smart chip technology, which has been used by European banks for over a decade, is only now being introduced by American credit card companies.\n\nAnd, because the SNCF (France’s national state-owned railway company) has been cutting costs (either that, or their employees were on strike), there was no attendant in the booth who could sell me a ticket in exchange for cash or coin. So I had to hail a cab, which, unlike the SNCF, accepted cash only.\n\nA couple of nights later, I was stopped by police at an impromptu checkpoint set up in the Metro to filter out freeloaders. By then, I had managed to find a Metro vending machine that accepted cash and had bought a carnet (a booklet of individual fare cards). I showed my fare and was let to pass.\n\nI entered France with an unverified passport, but was nearly immobilized because the SNCF was shy of cash transactions. I passed through French immigration control without consideration, yet was stopped by the police in the Metro over a 2€ fare.\n\nFrance: you are wonderful, delicious, and beautiful. But in many ways, you are totally effed up.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nMy time in Paris was brief. On this trip, the city merely served as a doormat to Belgium, my primary destination.\n\nBut I still managed to squeeze in three square meals in the two short days I was there.\n\nI had lunch at Antoine at 10 Avenue New York on the banks of the Seine in the 16eme.\n\nChef Thibault Sombardier had worked in the kitchens of Alain Dutournier (whose Carre de Feuillants I had visited in 2005) and Yannick Alleno (now no longer at le Meurice) before he arrived here in early 2013. In the year since, Sombardier retained the Michelin star that Antoine had earned under its previous chef and has found on-air fame as one of the cheftestants on the current, 2014 season of France’s version of the hit BravoTV series Top Chef.\n\nSombardier’s lunch tasting menu focused on the “scent of the sea” (Antoine has long been known as a seafood restaurant). My friend Laurent, who made the reservation for me, must have augmented my profile, because the kitchen sent out many extra dishes, including a buttery knot of monkfish in a frothy surf of milk foam under a blanket of shaved black truffles. It has been a particularly great season for truffles, and the truffles used here were still showing very well at the beginning of March.\n\nThere were ribbons of black mullet, cured so that the meat had gone slack and tender, garnished with house-cured bottarga. And there was a beautiful plaque of red mullet draped with silky strips of raw langoustine and dotted with tiny dried shrimp.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nIs pigeon the new beef? My lunch at Antoine was the first of five consecutive tasting menus I had on this trip to France and Belgium that included pigeon (and all but one of those meals featured the fowl as the anchor course before cheese and dessert). Like most of the plates at Antoine, the pigeon was nicely presented. Both the cooking and plating was precise in a way that would suggest that the chef is reaching for his next Michelin star. The slice of breast was rosy and juicy. The dark meat, papered over with crispy skin, pulled right off the thigh and leg bone. And there was a buttery croque filled with the pigeon’s liver.\n\nDespite Sombardier’s ambition on the plate, I suspect Antoine’s ability to climb the Michelin constellation will be limited by its interior, which is a good ten years behind the current trend. And the service, though friendly and helpful, will need to be polished up a bit too.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nI hadn’t seen my friend La Tache since we had a quick lunch together at Septime last year. This time, he proposed that we have dinner at Raquel Carina’s and Philippe Pinoteau’s cozy bistro la Baratin in the remote 20eme. Despite the fact that Anthony Bourdain taped a segment here for his show “The Layover,” the clientele (at least the night we went) was surprisingly local. There were a handful of tourists. But overall, the restaurant seemed dominated by Parisians, like the table of four guys next to us, who rolled their own cigarettes and left their wine and bag of filters on the table to step outside for a smoke break between courses.\n\nThe daily menu at la Baratin is chalked up on a board that moves from table to table. But La Tache knows Carina and he asked her to cook for us. The short Argentinean woman asked each of us to choose a main course and agreed to fill in the rest.\n\nHer ingredients were fresh and simply prepared. It’s the kind of no-nonsense cooking, focused mostly on celebrating natural flavor, that I hope will make a big come-back at the higher end of dining soon.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nA series of raw seafood dishes arrived in quick succession: tiny pétoncles served on their frilly-edged shells with some olive oil and salt; tartare of maigre with shaved beets; a powder-pink strip of chinchard, with a touch of smoked vinegar (Google is telling me this fish is also known as “Atlantic horse mackerel”); and a velvety, pea-green seafood bouillon with silky langoustines.\n\nThen, ravioli filled with ground pigeon nestled in a bowl with nuggets of foie gras melting into a warm broth of turnips. The pigeon filling was gruffer than the rest, but somehow, in that bistro, with Carina in the kitchen, it seemed strangely right.\n\nAnd, a strip of oily, salty anchovy with a bloody slice of beef made a particularly delicious pair.\n\nI love how the French do sweetbreads (Americans are such sissies about them): always a generously sized fist that’s more creamy interior than anything else. That’s what I got for my main course at la Baratin. And it was great, served with nothing more than some vegetables and browned butter.\n\nWe shared a bottle of wine and some desserts at the end (including an apple crumble that was way more crumble than apple in the best of ways), and left full and happy, having spent less on our meal than getting home in the rain (taxis being a hopeless cause in that neighborhood at that late hour – especially in the rain – and too lazy to figure out other options, we gouged our eyes out on Uber surge pricing).\n\n~\n\n~\n\nMy friend Laurent Vanparys left his fancy job to open a wine bar in Paris, which he has since left behind to co-found One Bite Consulting, a culinary consulting company that corrals chefs from Paris to Copenhagen for cooking events.\n\nWhen I told him I was heading to Paris, with a short list of Belgian restaurants on my wish list, he (a Belgian) quickly offered to be my tour guide and make all the arrangements. Our trip would be short – just over 24 hours – but full.\n\nWe left Paris in the morning by car, and was at Sang Hoon Degeimbre’s beautiful, countryside, farmhouse-restaurant l’Air du Temps by noon. (The restaurant is located near the town of Liernu in the Southern, Wallonian province of Namur.)\n\nThe farmhouse doubles as an inn, so it is possible for gastronauts visiting from afar to stay overnight.\n\nThe restaurant is divided among two dining rooms (with tables draped in leather) and a private dining room. The kitchen, which features a handsome wall of windows framing the fields beyond, turns a corner into more kitchen space. And just off that corner is another private dining room, this one, the “kitchen table.” During the day, this small, spare room, flooded with natural light, is a photographer’s dream. This is where Laurent and I had lunch.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nHaving worked in the research and development kitchen at Heston Blumenthal’s Fat Duck, Degeimbre has brought modernist cooking to the Belgian countryside.\n\nDegeimbre is a brilliant food colorist. Our meal popped with a rainbow of super-saturated colors. He ran us through a dazzling series of black towards the beginning, moving from inky squid juice to dusty ash (with which he coated scallops to appear as coals) to shiny, obsidian-like fried potato “shells” in which were tucked plump mussels – a tromp-l’oeil of the famous Belgian bistro fare, “moules frites.”\n\nThere was a snapper dish in various shades of neon orange. And there was a rosy slice of duck breast and a slick of sauce made magenta by the power of suggestion: ringed by a purple constellation of beets and red onions.\n\nWith our food came a rainbow of juices, every bit as colorful.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nBut, as visually stunning as much of the meal was, I thought a few dishes were more novel than they were delicious, like that scallop dusted in ash and wrapped in a cabbage leaf. It was a mess to eat (with our hands, as instructed), and quite frankly, I didn’t fully understand the conceit. I also thought the confetti of flower petals that decorated the top of a bowl of Vacherin Mont d’Or were not only superfluous, but an unwelcome interloper in an otherwise happy mix of creamy and crunchy.\n\nMy favorite dishes were the ones in which Degeimbre focused on flavor.\n\nFrom kiwi, he distilled the fruit’s breezy fragrance into a clear, viscous syrup to pair with the musky citrus of bergamot and the melon crispness of oysters.* Those flavors, together, were magical, indescribable, unforgettable.\n\nThere was a thigh of pigeon, glazed, and a juicy wedge of the breast, sauced with Asian flavors (heavy on the ginger) and served with a crouton fried in duck fat. It was a simple but flavorful meeting of ingredients and textures. That was a great dish. **\n\nAnd out of a hoary, freckled bowl that appeared like a moon crater leapt the bright, strong flavors of pickled and fermented summer vegetables anointed with parsley oil. The vegetables had a bit of snap, and so did the acidity. The dish came at the right time too – a refreshing break between heartier, saucier, meatier courses.\n\nAfter lunch, we took a brisk walk around the fields outside, untilled and windswept in the chill of early spring.\n\n[Disclaimer: Degeimbre is a client of One Bite Consulting. We were not presented with a bill.]\n\n~\n\n~\n\nFrom l’Air du Temps, we drove back over the border, skimming the northern edge of France and re-entered Belgium in the western Flemish province of West Flanders.\n\nIn the early evening, we pulled up to another farmhouse, this one outside the sleepy town of Dranouter. Once home to the Desramaults family, it is now Kobe Desramaults’s destination restaurant in de wulf. Here too, are rooms, where travelers can spend the night (at under 200€ a night, they are very reasonably priced). Laurent and I settled into our rooms, both of which had been recently renovated. Like the rest of the farmhouse, they were charmingly rustic, but unexpectedly luxurious. Mine had a gorgeous, wooden bathtub and a quieting view of the Belgian countryside through a set of French doors that opened onto a small, private patio.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nThe dining room at in de wulf is broad and flat, lined on one side with a stretch of large windows that runs the length of the patio outside. The inside is a mix of brick – much of it painted – and wood. I’d call it rustic if it weren’t also tidy and incredibly charming, aglow with candlelight at night.\n\nOur dinner ran for about 20 courses, starting with some snacks, moving onto a series of seafood, followed by a few courses featuring vegetables, and then a couple of meat dishes. Then, a spectacular cheese course – a wedge of knobby, blistered dough capped with a melty, pungent aged cheese called “Flamische Vieux Lille.” It was so good that Laurent asked for seconds (having eaten at in de wulf over fifty times, he was familiar with the chef and staff). The kitchen happily obliged, and I happily accepted the windfall.\n\nThe meal finished with a few, light desserts, all vegetable or fruit-based.\n\nDesramaults’s dishes showcased one or two ingredients at a time. He coaxed the best out of each one, using natural techniques - like smoking, aging, pickling, fermenting, and salt-baking - to enhance texture and flavor. Confident enough to find sophistication in simplicity, he kept garnishes and gimmickry to a minimum. I liked that. I also liked that, similar to the restaurant’s interior, Desramaults’s plating-style was clean and plain: nuggets of gelatinous cod cheeks served with a spot of creamy sauce; a hillock of North Sea crabmeat in a chilled broth of gurnard (a sea fish that inspired an article entitled “Ugly fish, tasty dish…“); and rosy slices of lamb with a little jus and a stalk of ramp.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nIn addition to that cheese course, three dishes stood out: A bowl of warm mussels (from Dunkerque) with some curly kale, frothy whipped sour cream, and white beer struck an incredible balance of salt and sour, anchored in a deep, satisfying umami.\n\nThere was also a silky strip of skate wing, glistening with a light miso made from grains. It’s rare to find skate cooked so exquisitely, with such great flavor to pair.\n\nAnd a roasted pigeon, aged whole for six weeks (disemboweled after two, then aged for another four stuffed with hay), appeared briefly at our table on a bed of hay before it was taken back to the kitchen. It reappeared, reduced to eight slices of breast meat that were ruddy, waxy, and funky.\n\nThe bread here was also super-good, an exemplar of the generic descriptor that Americans have assigned to this sort of thick-crusted type of loaf, tightly knitted with a rough-hewn crumb: farmhouse. I handily downed half a loaf by myself (with a healthy spread of butter and pork fat beside).\n\nThe wine pairings were just as fermented and funky as Desramaults’s food (the Domaine de Cavarodes, Poulsard de Chemoenot, 2012, paired with some salt-baked potatoes, smelled of something unmentionable) – some oxidized, all of it natural – the long-reaching shadows of Linda Milagros Violago’s work here some years ago. They paired very well with the food. So did the non-alcoholic pairings, which were just as untamed as the wines. They ranged from an earthy-sweet carrot-turnip juice to a jammy (and wonderfully milky tasting) lacto-fermented elderberry juice.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nThe smell of coffee and sound of eggs sizzling on a beautiful, wood-fired stove (lined in Dutch-blue tiles) greeted us the next morning in the farmhouse’s mess hall, a separate space dedicated to serving breakfast for overnight guests (breakfast is included in the room rate). Plates of cheese and cold cuts were brought to the table to share, and everyone was encouraged to visit a handsome spread of house-made bread, pastries, jams, condiments, and juices set up on the kitchen counter. Eggs were cooked to order.\n\nThe sky was low and grey that morning. The fire was crackling. I could have lingered in that farmhouse all day, with a thick sweater and a good book. As a total-package kind of experience, in de wulf is an international destination worth the trouble and expense, both for Desramaults’s cooking and the charming world that he has created around it.\n\nBefore leaving, we were shown an upstairs loft space. Formerly Kobe Desramaults’s A-frame attic abode, at the time, it was being converted to a private dining space. It should now be open for reservations.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nLocated directly in the path of advancing German troops, the ancient town of Ieper (pronounced “ee-per” in Flemish, the town is also commonly known by its French name Ypres, pronounced “ee-PRAY”) in West Flanders was the site of intense fighting in World War I. By the end of that war, the entire city had been leveled.\n\nI would never have guessed this awful fate of Ieper by the look of the town today. That’s because, in the two decades following The Great War, most of the town was restored, brick-by-brick, stone-by-stone, to its pre-World War I look.\n\nBarely a half-hour drive from Dranouter, Ieper is now home to one of Desramaults’s former cooks, Vilhjalmur Sigurdarson, whom Laurent had met on his many trips to in de wulf. An Icelander, Sigurdarson met his Flemish wife while working at in de wulf. He settled in her hometown of Ieper and, together, they opened souvenir, a small but smartly furnished restaurant in the heart of town. Souvenir had only been open a few days when we arrived that mid-day in early March.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nSouvenir is one of those restaurants that every food writer longs to find: new, unsung, far-flung, and – most-importantly – good. Actually, I would say that my lunch there was great – unexpectedly so for a restaurant that was so new, and so scantly staffed. Sigurdarson had only one other in the kitchen - a young, Flemish cook named Aster Welleman. And Sigurdarson’s wife Joke, eight-months pregnant at the time, tended the front of the house with only one other server.\n\nAt the time, the menu was prix-fixe, and shockingly inexpensive at 55€ for 5 courses (Sigurdarson sent us an additional course, for a total of six).\n\nIn many ways, souvenir was the perfect summation of my quick eating tour of Belgium. Sigurdarson’s cooking demonstrated all the precision and offered all the technicolor dazzle of Degeimbre’s modernist cooking at l’Air du Temps but showed the confident, rustic simplicity and flavor-forwardness of Desramaults’s farmhouse fare.\n\nHis food was immensely comforting, like a flaky filet of pollock buried under a steaming pile of cabbage, with some cabbage juice poured over it all. There was also a tender tranche of pork belly – the meat unexpectedly juicy, the fat surprisingly loose under its crisp surface – served with beets and bitter mustard leaf to thin out the richness.\n\n“Pigeon,” I said. “Pear,” Sigurdarson replied, “The pigeon is just the garnish.” He was joking, of course. But that pear was amazing; slightly charred, slightly softened, and soaked with flavor. Together with the pigeon, it was a showstopper.\n\nI am a happy champion for Sigurdarson and his crew. For anyone targeting Belgium for its more well-known, Michelin-starred tables, souvenir deserves to be seriously considered as well.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nLaurent and I folded ourselves back into his car and hurled ourselves south towards the awaiting rush-hour traffic of Paris. We made good time, and slipped through the rings of banlieue in time for me to catch the tail end of my friend Stephanie Biteau’s party at her beautiful studio kitchen, Cookcooning.\n\nI snacked a little there, and then slipped into the rainy night, off to dinner at David Toutain’s eponymous restaurant on the rue Surcouf in the 7eme, which opened last December.\n\nI had missed Toutain when he was at l’Agapé Substance, where he last cooked, and where he first attracted international attention. But I did have a bite of his cooking at Gastronomika in San Sebastian in October of 2012, and a few of his dishes at the Twelve Days of Christmas a few months later (some of which were repeated at this new restaurant in Paris). I was excited to finally have a meal at his table.\n\nToutain’s cooking was far more intriguing to me than it was delicious or satisfying. I found some of his combinations bizarre – smoked eel, green apple, and foie gras are fairly common friends in European haute cuisine, but Toutain put all of them in an inky black sesame purée, which I found strange. Some of them were quite lovely, like coconut ice cream cradled in a billowing cloud of cauliflower and white chocolate. And some, I recognized from other kitchens, like Toutain’s oysters veiled in a bright-green kiwi purée, a page he readily admits taking from Degeimbre’s playbook. Or, sea urchin, served in the shell, with a steadying shot of dark, bitter coffee froth, a combination I had seen before at Robuchon’s Mansion in Las Vegas.\n\nI preferred Toutain’s more familiar, more classically based dishes, like a bowl of foamed Comté, garnished with shaved ribbons of the cheese and really great, winter black truffles. There was also a terrific lamb rib chop served with mushrooms and some nuts. The rib bone had been removed, leaving the attached flap of fat standing as a visual double. That made it so much easier to eat.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nBefore leaving Paris, I swung by Télescope, a tiny coffee shop in the 2eme opened by former fashion photographer Nicolas Clerc. The cappuccinos here were great. And, yes, apparently, Paris has hipsters too.\n\nBefore I knew it, I was on a plane bound for Bergen, Norway, where I will continue this travelogue in the next blog post.\n\nHere are the places I ate in Paris and Belgium, with links to the photos of the food I had at each one.\n\nFRANCE\n\nAntoine (Paris, 16eme)\n\nDavid Toutain (Paris, 7eme)\n\nLe Baratin (Paris, 20eme)\n\nBELGIUM\n\nin de wulf (Dranouter)\n\nl’Air du Temps (Liernu)\n\nsouvenir (Ieper)\n\n~\n\n* Of my few food allergies, kiwi is the most severe. Yet, as with all of my food allergens, I always try it if it is served to me. In this case, Degeimbre’s extraction process must have eliminated the allergen in kiwi. I had no allergic reaction to this dish.\n\n** Quite a few dishes pointed to Degeimbre’s Korean heritage. He was adopted and raised by Belgians. Like his modernist cooking forebears, Degeimbre codifies his dishes with dates and provenance. This pigeon dish, for example, was entitled “Favorite 2004: Pigonneau from Jean Yves Bruyère, Asian-Style.”\n\nPHOTOS: Old coffee tins at in de wulf in Dranouter, Belgium; couples taking a selfie on the Paserelle Debilly, Paris, France; stormy weather approaches the garden of the Tuileries, Paris France; pigeon at Antoine in Paris, France; cigarette filters and wine on a table at le Baratin in Paris, France; beef with anchovy at le Baratin in Paris, France; Sang Hoon Debeimbre plating pigeon at l’Air du Temps near Liernu, Belgium; “Favorite 2010: Purple Duck version 2014″ at l’Air du Temps; pigeon, plated, at l’Air du Temps; pickles and preserves on the shelves at in de wulf near Dranouter, Belgium; spring and late-winter vegetables with an egg yolk sauce at in de wulf; the roasted, 6-week aged pigeon presented on hay at in de wulf; the wood-fired stove in Dutch-blue tiles at in de wulf; Vilhjamur Sigurdarson peeling radishes at Souvenir in Ieper, Belgium; the pork belly at Souvenir; the lamb chop at David Toutain in Paris, France; cappuccino and “Fool Magazine” at Télescope in Paris, France.\n\n~\n\nChef Christopher Haatuft pulled off the winding road that traces the craggy Norwegian coast near Askøy. The gloomy sky hung low as we got out of the car and started down a marshy trail that stretched for a while along a creek, before rising over a rocky hill.\n\nWe arrived high above a small inlet of water. There were three cooks with us: a Frenchman, a short Italian, and a Dutchman, who was unbelievably tall in the way that Dutchmen often are. I only mention the height of these cooks because, comically, the Italian and Dutchman ended up sharing the same wader, which ended badly for the poor Italian, who began hooting halfway out, when his slack suit began taking on the cold, Nordic water.\n\nThe cooks fanned out, and began looking for herbs among the low-lying brush. I followed Haatuft closer to the water, which was incredibly calm and clear, made inky only by its depth. We were there to meet his sea forager, Arne Duinker.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nAfter a worrisome wait with no sign of Duinker, Haatuft reassured me that he was on his way. Looking for him on the horizon, expecting his arrival on foot by the same trail we took, I was surprised when Haatuft pointed at the water, where Duinker surfaced, wearing a wetsuit and snorkel.\n\nArne Duinker was made for the sea. A marine biologist at NIFES (the Norwegian National Institute of Nutrition and Seafood Research), he is lean and lithe, and has an incredible tolerance for the cold. Out of the water, he stripped down naked among the rocks, toweled off, and changed into dry clothes, all the while telling us calmly about his small harvest that day, seemingly unfazed by the chilly, late-winter rain that had begun to fall.\n\nFrom his water sack, Duinker produced a variety of seaweed, pointing out the features of each, noting that some of them were getting too tough to eat. He also pulled out two beautiful sea urchins, glowing a shade of neon lavender I had never seen on that type of creature before. Carefully, he lopped off the tops of each (you’ll want to see this video), revealing the creamy gonads arranged in a star-shaped pattern within. The familiar, orange-colored ones (the ones that we are accustomed to eating) belonged to females, Duinker said. The other one had milky-white gonads, which I had never seen before. Those, Duinker pointed out, belonged to a male. The gonads of both were incredibly swollen, and looked more watery than creamy, a sign that the urchins were in mating mode.\n\nI tasted both. The female gonads were sweeter than the male gonads, which had a saltier minerality. But both were far too watery to be considered good for eating.\n\nThe rain stopped, and we took turns strapping on the waders and venturing into the water to collect more seaweed and sea snails.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nArne Duinker is just one of the many people with whom Haatuft works to understand and improve the Norwegian food supply chain. Since Norway’s population is barely over 5 million, the food community there is relatively small, and it’s stretched thinly over a large, and largely unforgiving terrain. Since the vast majority of Norwegians live along the coast, the ocean is a major source of food. As such, it has become a growing concern for Norwegians, like Haatuft, who worry about the sustainability of local aquaculture.\n\nIn fact, the reason I was in the Norwegian city of Bergen that week was because a good college friend of mine, Solveig, whose family owns one of the largest fish farming operations in the world, was there attending the North Atlantic Seafood Forum (NASF). Aware that I’ve attended a couple of international fora dedicated to sustainable seafood, and having toured and photographed her family’s fish farms in Honduras and Mexico, which have an impressive track record for sustainability – both with regard to the environment and the communities that comprise their workforce – she asked me if I’d meet her at one of her industry’s most important events.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nBack from Askøy, Haatuft and I swung by his restaurant, Lysverket, located on the ground level of the Bergen Art Museum, to drop off his cooks and to warm up over hearty bowls of Norwegian fish soup.* More cream than broth, it was really more like a bisque, with fish quenelles, and some julienne root vegetables.\n\nAfterwards, we picked up his business partner (and co-investor in Lysverket) Fredrik Saroea (who, by the way, not only has the most eclectic collection of Japanese cartoon figurines I’ve ever seen, but is also the vocalist, guitarist and co-founder of Datarock, a Norwegian electronic rock band known for its members’ red jumpsuits), and drove two hours to Voss, stopping along the way at a small apple farm in the sleepy, seaside village of Øystese. The farm was so small, in fact, that the orchard was in the middle of a neighborhood, tucked in the bend of a switchback with a magnificent view of the sea, and snow-capped mountains beyond. It couldn’t have been more than a third of an acre at most. Here, Geir Henning Spilde grows nearly a dozen different varieties of apples, which he presses himself, making single-varietal juices, as well as blends. We tasted about a half-dozen different juices – my favorite was a particularly fragrant Summerred single-varietal. Haatuft and Saroea picked up a few bottles for the restaurant, and we continued on our way toward Voss.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nOver the past couple of decades, large-scale fish farming has arrived to the cold, North Sea waters. Halibut, trout, char, mussels, oysters, and, to a lesser extent, cod, are all raised in net cages sheltered in the calm, Norwegian fjords. Salmon, however, comprise the lion’s share of Norway’s fish farming industry. In fact, when I was in Chile last year, where salmon farming has become a major source of revenue, representatives of the Chilean fishing associations told me that they get most of their salmon eggs from Norway.\n\nThis boom in fish farming is having a negative impact on local aquaculture. The density of fish raised in these cages is increasing the level of pollutants in the water. It’s also spreading diseases to which wild fish are particularly vulnerable. Also, the further upstream the salmon cages are anchored in the fjords, the more they interfere with seasonal fish runs. Wild salmon, disoriented by the large quantity of caged salmon in the fjords, are less able to find their way back to their spawning sites upstream. Caged fish that escape are also mating with wild salmon, altering the natural gene pool, and not necessarily in a good way. Wild salmon are being weeded out.\n\nThat is why people like Geir Ove Henden are so important now. Henden works at the Voss Klekkeri, a salmon hatchery that hopes to replenish the falling wild salmon population. We drove to Voss to visit him.\n\nHenden walked us through the incubation and hatching process, starting with dozens of trays of wild salmon eggs at various stages of gestation. At some point, the eggs are submerged in a non-toxic dye that permeates the eggs’ membrane and stains the spine of the embryos within. Together, with tiny, metal tags, etched with an identification numbers, that are embedded in the mouths of young salmon, staining the fishes’ spines helps Henden and his fellow marine biologists track their salmon. Specifically, they want to know how many of their tagged salmon are able to find their way back upstream to Voss to spawn each season. Likewise, they also want to know how many of their salmon end up swimming up different streams, or not making it back to freshwater to spawn at all, possibly confused by the caged salmon in the fjords.\n\nI wondered aloud: don’t the salmon have to hatch in the wild in order to know where to return to spawn? Isn’t there some kind of magical encryption process that happens at birth whereby the coordinates of a salmon’s birth site are coded into the fish’s brain? Yes and no. According to Henden, salmon mentally record their maiden journey downstream into the ocean, and rely on this memory to find their way back years later when they are ready to spawn. So, when the Voss Klekkeri’s young salmon are ready to be released into the wild, they are put into cages upstream and then towed downstream by tugboats into the open, ocean waters, where they are released. In this way, the Voss Klekkeri’s salmon are exposed to the fresh waters of their “birth,” and able to record their journey into the ocean.\n\nAs I left the hatchery, I noticed a black and white photo, decades old, of Henden and his colleagues, with salmon larger than they. I stopped to admire the size of the fish in the picture. Henden lamented that salmon that size used to be commonplace. Now, they’re far and few between.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nBergen is Norway’s busiest port, and the country’s second-most populated city. But, it’s not very big. The city center, parts of which are registered as a UNESCO Word Heritage Site, is easily navigable by foot, although the amount of rainfall this side of Norway gets often makes it a pain to get around. It rained every day I was there, varying between light drizzle and sheets of rain that moved almost horizontally.\n\nI was only in the city for three, short days, so I didn’t get to explore the restaurant scene much. From what I gathered, both from online research and locals alike, it’s not a very exciting destination for dining (yet, anyway). But a few chefs in town, like Haatuft, and Christer Økland, chef of 1877, are striving to make it a better place to eat.\n\nMy first night in town, I ate at Økland’s relatively new restaurant, located in the city’s historic meat market (1877 opened in 2013). The restaurant offered two prix-fixe menus (3 and 5 courses). I chose the longer one (695 NOK; at the then-current exchange rate, about $110). Like Haatuft, Økland focuses on cooking with local, Norwegian products. I had king crab, inland trout, and pork from a pig farmer about whom Økland was particularly enthusiastic. I also loved the local, Norwegian cheeses he served, especially an unpasteurized blue cheese with a dusty rind. Overall, I found the cooking to be solid, the flavors bold (the meat broth poured over the king crab might have been too bold – it was awfully salty), and the presentation neat enough. There was a hearty rusticity to Økland’s food that matched the charming interior of the restaurant (which had an Old World beauty about it). But there were also glimpses of modernity that betrayed Økland’s time in more contemporary kitchens, like alinea in Chicago.\n\n(For those who don’t drink alcohol – and even for those who do – I encourage you to explore 1877’s menu of fruit juices. I ordered the blueberry juice and it was outstanding – rich and velvety, and full of flavor.)\n\n~\n\n~\n\nI heard that exciting things were happening at Colonialen. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a spare night to have dinner there. But, I did drop by its Café and Brasserie, located in the adjacent Litteraturhuset (Literature House), for lunch. In addition to offering an assortment of baked goods, the café also had a short menu of mostly cold plates. I had a terrific pig ear terrine (served on a board with mustard and pickled vegetables) and a hearty smoked salmon salad (with beets, walnuts, and tartar sauce as dressing). Together, with a bottle of water, that lunch cost me $50, which, perhaps expensive to an American, is normal by Norwegian standards.**\n\nWhile standing – pressed against a building under the eves to avoid the rain – on Østre Skostredet, admiring the psychedelic (and tastefully applied) graffiti on the buildings across the street, there came a knock on the window behind me. When I turned around, a young man inside was waving at me. At first, I thought he was shooing me from leaning on his window. He picked up my misunderstanding and quickly ran to open the door, inviting me to come in out of the rain.\n\nInside was a curious outfit. It was a large, one-room studio-slash-museum. It was completely bare, save the tiny desk at which this young man – the docent, or guide? – sat, and a strange contraption, mostly made of wood, that looked like a pipe organ collided with a victrola and a series of discs that looked like astronomy charts. I thought it might be a modern art installation. Attached to this contraption was a crank, and the young man encouraged me to turn it. When I did, the contraption came to life – the astronomy charts (which turned out to be some kind of perforated sheet music) started to turn, the bellow started to pump, and the pipes begin emitting strange, atonal sounds. This was Bergen’s Lydgalleriat (“Sound Gallery”), a non-commercial gallery space for exploring experimental sound-based art. Funded by the Arts Council of Norway, the Lydgalleriet is a testament to how strange and wonderful the world can be when people, and their government, support the arts enthusiastically. But, I suppose one’s government must be solvent before it can support the arts at all (more on this in a later post).\n\nMy unexpected visit to the Lydgalleriet of Bergen is just one example of the many curious corners of the city that I unintentionally discovered while seeking relief from the rain (the city’s famous fish market was another). A few blocks away, I ducked into a small boutique that sold magnificent raincoats made by T. Michael, a Bergan-based clothing designer. Despite the fact that Norwegians tend tall and big, and I am short and small, to my great surprise and joy, his Norwegian Rain coats fit me like a glove. If anyone out there is feeling particularly generous, I invite you to send me a double-breasted in his smallest size (XXS). I prefer any shade of blue or grey over black. Thanks.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nI had two dinners at Lysverket. The night we returned from the hatchery in Voss, we dropped in for some bar snacks. The next night, I returned with my friend Solveig for a proper meal.\n\nHaatuft cooked for us, so I am unsure how my meal might have detoured from his menu that night.\n\nUnsurprisingly, his cooking focused mostly on seafood. We had octopus, langoustine, mahogany clams, and scallops, all from local waters. Haatuft’s dishes demonstrated good cooking technique, although, since his sauces, like Økland’s, tended salty, I started to question whether the Bergen palate is accustomed to a higher level of salinity than my American one.\n\nThe three dishes that stood out the most included a beautiful, alabaster round of cod with cauliflower and sherry gastrique. There was also a terrific piece of braised veal tongue, served with radicchio marmalade and a rich juniper sauce. And, towards the end, I particularly liked his composed cheese course: “Krafkar,” a marbled blue, with poppyseed cake, cranberries, and pretty little leaflets of lettuce. Those plates were clean and neat, and focused on a few, excellent ingredients.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nThe next morning, Solveig and I boarded the famous Bergen rail line and took a magical, 300-mile journey through the snowy, Norwegian mountains to Oslo, where I will pick up in my next blog post.\n\nIn the months since, Haatuft and I have kept in touch, both of us very much inspired by the conversations we had that day with Duinker on the rocks, Spilde in his orchard, and Henden at the hatchery in Voss. Recently, Haatuft reached out to me and asked me if I would accompany an American chef to Bergen to recreate that day, and to further our cross-cultural conversation about sustainability and responsible aquaculture. The trip would culminate in a small, private dinner that the guest chef would cook at Lysverket, using the ingredients that we’d find at the various farms, fields, and fjords along the way. I happily accepted his invitation and, given Haatuft’s charge, invited Justin Cogley, chef of Aubergine in Carmel, California, to be the guest chef. Cogley has been a particularly admirable champion of sustainable aquaculture, partnering with the Monterey Bay Aquarium, as well as the Monterey Bay Abalone Co., and other entities and organizations in his region to bring more awareness to this important issue. For two years now, he has also hosted the Rediscovering Coastal Cuisine dinner series, which brings chefs from all over the country to the Monterey Bay peninsula to learn about and celebrate sustainable aquaculture. I have attended this event both years, and, like that day that I spent touring with Haatuft, they have proven to be unforgettable learning experiences.\n\nSo, next month, Cogley and I will be traveling to Bergen on a cross-cultural exchange and adventure. (The dinner, I have been told by Haatuft, has already sold out, even before it has been officially announced.) I look forward to telling you about it.\n\n~\n\n~\n\n* The Bergen Art Museum is spread over a number of buildings. Lysverket is located in KODE 4. Next door, is a terrific exhibit of Edvard Munch’s ghostly characters. It is the second-largest collection of Munch’s artwork in the world, second only to Oslo.\n\n** Like most of Scandinavia, Norway is expensive. When I arrived at the airport in Bergen, one of the first things I did was let out some cash from an automated teller. Because I had barely slept the night before, but mostly because I am very bad at math, I selected one of the pre-set withdrawal amounts and ended up with $500. When I expressed surprise to my Norwegian friends that their cash machines had pre-set withdrawal amounts that hight, they laughed. They told me that I’d likely go through $500 in a day or two without even trying. They were right.\n\nPHOTOS: Both male and female sea urchins on the rocks at Askøy; Christopher Haatuft on this mobile in the inlet at Askøy; the famous wharf in Bergen, a UNESCO World Heritage Site; the interior of Lysverket at the Bergen Art Museum Kode 4; the view from the Spilde orchard in Øystese; the interior of 1877 in Bergen; pig ear terrine and smoked salmon salad at Colonialen’s café in the Litteraturhuset in Bergen; Krafkar composed cheese course at Lysverket; the psychedelic graffiti art in Bergen; the KODE 4, in which Lysverket resides, was partially covered with scaffolding that was decorated with graffiti at the invitation of the local radio station, which invited any and all to come help decorate the museum’s plywood exterior while the museum was under renovation.\n\n~\n\nAt its highest, the Bergen Rail Line climbs 1,300 meters above sea level, making it the highest elevated rail line in Europe. Running over 480 meters (300 miles), the line anchors at both ends on the coast of Norway.\n\nWhen I last left this blog, I had boarded the train on the west coast in Bergen, and was headed to the eastern terminus in Oslo. In between those two cities, fjords and forests, mountains and valleys rushed by my big, picture window in a blur of grey and white. It was the tail of winter, but most of the Norwegian highlands remained shrouded in clouds and blanketed with snow.\n\nThe train stopped about a half a dozen times, just long enough for passengers, bundled in snow and ski gear, to offload. Outside, skimobiles, piled with people and packs, motored off towards silhouettes of cabins beyond, half-buried in snow.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nOslo was rainy.\n\nConveniently, the main train station is right next to the Oslo Opera House, where my friend Sjøgren works. I went straight from the station to meet her for a tour. Sjøgren had been a graduate student in the theater department at my university. As a part of a scholarship for costume design that I was awarded by the department, I was assigned to assist her on a production that she was designing. I later shared a class with her, before being assigned to design a show of my own, which I could not have done without her help. The last time the two of us saw each other was on my first and last visit to Norway in 2005.\n\nThe Oslo Opera House is magnificent. The building merges classical and modern opera house design concepts, drawing inspiration from famous theaters from around the world (visit the website for more). It houses the Norwegian state opera, the ballet, and a black box theater for more experimental performance art.\n\nThe building is immense. The square footage devoted to the costume shop, alone, was unbelievable, not to mention the miles of corridors lined with dance studios, changing rooms, and offices. The number of productions and the amount of traffic that this venue sees on any given week is mind-blowing. The day Sjøgren walked me through the building, the opera was opening a production of Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin, although I also found wigs and costumes in the shop tagged with La Bohême, and at least a half dozen other shows.\n\nSitting at the water’s edge, the Norwegian Opera House is built entirely on landfill, and with public funds. The vast majority of its productions and operations are supported with public funds as well. It stands as a testament to the Norwegian commitment to the performing arts. To an American, whose government nickel-and-dimes its way each year to an embarrassingly small budget for its already starved National Endowment for the Arts, the Norwegian Opera House is an enviable and inspiring sight. Whereas the Norwegians collectively agree to support and sustain the arts, in America, we rely on the generosity of wealthy philanthropists.\n\nThen again, owing to the vast fields of oil in the Norwegian North Sea, Norway boasts the second highest GDP in Europe (second only to the small Grand Duchy of Luxembourg), and is the second wealthiest country in the world, in terms of monetary value. So they can afford it.\n\n[The Norwegian Opera House cost a little over $700 million to build (this does not include its annual operating budget). The 2014 budget for the United States National Endowment for the Arts was $146 million.]\n\n~\n\n~\n\nI had three dinners in Oslo. I’d like to tell you about two of them.\n\nThe first dinner I had was at Maaemo, located in an unexpected corner of a building that was tucked on a side street near the tracks of the central train station. The restaurant is small, and, to the credit of its designers, takes advantage of its awkwardly shaped space. Spotlights trained on the generously spaced tables made them the center of attention, throwing an ambient glow onto the walls, hung with art, which was strangely alluring. It was an eclectic, but well-curated lot. (Young and upcoming artists are encouraged to submit their work for consideration here.)\n\n~\n\n~\n\nOverlooking part of the dining room from the floor above, is the kitchen. A narrow, spiral staircase, is the only means by which food and service items are shuttled between the kitchen and the dining room.\n\nNext to the kitchen, divided by a wall of glass, was the “Test Kitchen Table,” so named because, in addition to being a private dining room, with a stunning, black marble hightop that seats four (six if you don’t mind being cozy), it is also equipped to double as a kitchen. Also, diners seated in this room may receive some off-menu dishes that are still in development. Encased in glass on all four sides, Maaemo’s Test Kitchen Table is the ultimate skybox. It affords diners a view of the kitchen, the dining room below, and the glittering expanse of Oslo beyond. The room had just been completed and had only been made available for reservations the week before. To my great surprise, my friend and I were one of the first ones to be seated there.\n\n(The photo above was taken from the small landing at the top of the spiral staircase, which you can see through the glare in the glass on the lower right, that circles it’s way down to the dining room below. The Test Kitchen Table is in the room to the left.)\n\n~\n\n<\n\n~\n\nMaaemo is Finnish for “mother earth,” and it is suggestive of chef Esben Holmboe Bang’s terroir-driven cuisine. Aligned with the current wave of haute, pan-Nordic cookery, Bang’s cooking focuses on indigenous ingredients, most of which are hearty and humble: root vegetables, dairy, grains, cold-water seafood, and game. But what makes many of these Nordic chefs – like Bang – stand out is the quality of their ingredients, and the simplicity and precision with which they are presented. Very rarely outside of the Scandinavian countries have I found such a high level of ingredient quality, confidence in simplicity, and precision in execution to co-exist. (Japan is an obvious exception. But, there are many cultural similarities between Scandivania and Japan.)\n\nBang seems particularly talented at concentrating flavor in stocks and sauces. With a crisp oyster, he served a creamy emulsion of mussels and dill that tasted intensely of both. To highlight the sweetness in a meaty mignon of scallop, which was presented on its shell before being divided between my friend and me, he spooned a reduction of celeriac juice, infused with apples. And to help punch up a simple salad of charred onions and a coddled quail egg, there was a rich onion vinaigrette, woodsy with thyme.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nMy favorite dishes included a gorgeous breast of duck, roasted with birch wood and presented whole under a thick rind of fat and crackling. We were each served a strip of the breast meat, rosy and juicy, with preserved pear, kale, and a jus made from the duck legs.\n\nScandinavians are excellent bread bakers, so, unsurprisingly, the bread at Maaemo was stellar. It was served (and deserved to be served) as its own course, on traditional Norwegian matpapir – parchment wrapping paper – with whipped butter. I’ve noticed that some Nordic restaurants are baking bread in small, bite-sized molds. I like this because there is a higher crust-to-crumb ratio. On the flip side, these little nuggets cool quickly, and as they do, the dense interior stiffens. I suspect this is one of the reasons why this type of bread is typically served as its own course, and not let to sit and linger at the table over multiple courses like traditional bread service.\n\nAt Maaemo, the bread looked like it had been baked in mini muffin molds. They were cylindrical, but too short to have crowned a muffin top. The bread at Ylajali the next night was very similar. The molds there were, perhaps, slightly smaller, and the bread was allowed to crown. At Rasmus Kofoed’s Geranium in Copenhagen, where I first encountered bread service in this fashion, they were shaped like oval financiers. In all three cases, the bread was made of milled grains and encrusted with seeds and grains.\n\nAt the end of dinner, there was a wonderfully silky brown butter ice cream, plated with hazelnut crumbles and molasses, and drizzled with a syrup of brown butter. That was terrific.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nI can’t say that I loved all of the dishes at Maaemo. My least favorite ones were the porridges, like rømmegrøt, described as sour cream topped with shaved reindeer heart. These dishes, which also included a thick mushroom cream topped with “savory muesli” and a porridge of spelt and buckwheat with cheese, were extremely rich and, even though they were served in small portions, cloying. I do, however, recall Bang saying that at least one of these dishes was still being tweaked, and that ours was just a preview in progress.\n\nNevertheless, based on the meal I had, Maaemo undoubtedly deserves both of the Michelin stars it has earned (it is the highest, Michelin-ranked restaurant in Norway). Bang’s cooking has the sort of flawless consistency for which Scandinavian chefs are celebrated. (I note, however, that his staff was fairly international. At the time I ate there, there was not one Norwegian in the kitchen. Bang is Danish, and his partner and sommelier, Pontus Dahlgren, who served my friend and me most of the night, is Finnish, by way of Sweden. We were also presented dishes by cooks from the United States, Great Britain, Australia, and Asia.) The ingredients were great, the flavors were clean, and the message was clear, relatively free of superfluous shills for terroir and unnecessary theatrics (although, a fat langoustine perched on boughs of evergreen above a misting sea of dry ice was pretty dramatic). The quality of the experience, which included a magical setting and excellent service, spoke for itself. Maaemo is impressive. I look forward to experiencing Bang’s collaboration dinner with Christopher Kostow later this year at the Twelve Days of Christmas at Meadowood Napa Valley.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nOn my way to Oslo, I read “Sult” (translated as “Hunger” in English). The book, written in 1890 by Norwegian novelist Knut Hamsun, has since become a modern classic. Considered one of the first psychology-drive books, it follows a tortured, young, starving artist in his daily life in Kristiana (the former name of Oslo). His encounters with the heroine, Ylajali (to the best of my knowledge, it is pronounced ee-LY-ah-lee), are brief, but notable. And it is because of her that I read the book.\n\nOn my second night in Oslo, I had dinner at St. Olavs Plass 2, the heroine’s home address in Hamsun’s novel, now occupied by a restaurant named after her. Owing to this literary birth, the restaurant’s menu is presented as a book, with the sections of the meals broken down into “chapters.”\n\nNorwegian Even Ramsvik is chef at Ylajali. And his food falls squarely on the Nordic track, so much so that I recognized a number of his dishes based on ones I’ve seen elsewhere.\n\nA crispy tangle of fried angel hair potato, encasing chicken liver and dusted with lingonberry powder, was awfully similar to the potato and duck liver course I had at Noma in Copenhagen. Likewise, Ramsvik’s charred leek – a stalk tied at both ends and unseamed lengthwise to reveal a re-stuffed heart of melted leeks with löjrom (roe) and hazelnuts – was nearly identical to the one I had at Noma (and strangely similar to this other version at Eric Frechon’s three Michelin-starred Le Bristol in Paris). And how about this sack of bread, which I had mentioned above?\n\n~\n\n~\n\nI don’t mean to pick on Ramsvik, or accuse him of copying others.\n\nWith the internet age in full swing, the borders of originality are becoming fuzzier. Indeed, there seems to be such a great exchange of information and dialogue about food these days that the international culinary playbook has become communal, and only loosely codified. Furthermore, much of what modern chefs are doing now is revising age-old dishes that have existed for centuries. What troubles me, however, is that diners – including journalists – seem less and less interested in originality, and more and more focused on trends and personalities.\n\nIn some cases, a unique style of plating, or presentation, or pairing of ingredients has an established provenance (Michel Bras’s famous “Gargouillou,” for example, or Ferran Adria’s “Caviar Cream and Hazelnut Caviar,” or Alain Passard’s “egg” at l’Arpege).\n\nOther times, an idea evolves until it becomes something different, but with a recognizable pedigree. Ramsvik’s “wild cow” tartare might fall into this category (note: I am not saying that it does, I am saying that it might). A few years ago, Rene Redzepi of Noma was serving a plaque of musk ox tartare covered with sorrel (I found this article about the dish from 2009; in later photos, the tartare appears to be completely papered over with sorrel). In 2013, I had a wild beef tartare dish at Rodolfo Guzman’s Boragó in Chile, where the chopped meat was formed into a ball and then covered in oxalis petals. I was told that the dish was inspired by Redzepi’s, but referred to the terroir of Quintay, in Chile. At Ylajali, Ramsvik served the wild cow chopped, formed into a ball, and covered with nasturtium.\n\nAnd, with enough passage of time and facsimiles, some dishes surpass being merely a trend and become a part of popular, culinary lexicon, thereby entering the “public domain.” The molten chocolate cake – which I have heard attributed to both Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Michel Bras, although certainly countless bakers before them have accidentally half-baked a chocolate cake before – is a good example. It can now be found on dessert menus from here to the moon.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nSince I have seen a wide spectrum of international cooking over a rather long period time, it’s hard to avoid connecting dots that seem to be related. Take, for example, a rash of edible sea shells that has spread across fine dining tables recently.\n\nIs the “razor clam,” that I had at Matthew Lightner’s Atera in New York a copy of Rasmus Kofoed’s version at Geranium, which I assume is the original version?\n\nRedzepi served a smoked mussel on an edible mussel shell at Noma, pointing to the shellfish-rich waters not 100 yards from the restaurant’s front door. Sang Hoon Degeimbre served me something very similar at his farmhouse restaurant l’Air du Temps. The shell of Degeimbre’s was made of fried potato, a clever reference to the fries that are served with mussels in his native Belgium (moules frites). Certainly, both chefs had a great storyline for their edible mussel shells. But one had to come before the other. It would be awfully hard to believe that both came up with the idea independent of each other, sui generis.\n\nCoffee siphons, liquid nitrogen, ash-coating: I could continue connecting dots, but it’s probably better if I save them for a rumination. Suffice it to say, my opinion on the matter is simple: if your diners might know the origin of your copy or inspiration – and here, I’m not talking about the 99%, who probably will not know, but rather that 1% that will – it’s better to clarify and disclose. You’d rather the 1% leave your restaurant admiring you for acknowledging and crediting those who have inspired you, rather than thinking that you’ve tried to fool them.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nAs for Ylajali, Ramsvik’s cooking was technically sound, and his flavors were bold and clear, which likely accounts for the Michelin star that he was awarded just a couple of weeks after I ate there. Among my favorite dishes was a warm mushroom broth poured into a bowl of tender duck hearts and a gently cooked duck egg, still runny inside. And I was surprises by how much I likes the subsequent course, which presented a hearty slice of reindeer on a splatter of blood and truffles. I expected the dish to be extremely heavy (especially with a melting knob of butter to one side). But the meat was surprisingly tender, and the flavor of the sauce was not nearly as messy as it appeared on the plate.\n\nThe ørskog svele at the end was, perhaps, the highlight of the meal for me. These little pancakes, made from a fragrant, yeasty batter, were griddled table side, and served with hazelnut ice cream and toasted hazelnuts. It was terrific.\n\nYlajali is a lovely restaurant. The interior is elegant in its spartan simplicity, with well-worn floors, and high ceilings trimmed in crown molding. The space might have seemed a bit cold and empty, if it had not been filled with the warmth of a hospitable staff.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nOn my last morning in Oslo, my friend Sjøgren invited me to a traditional Norwegian breakfast at her place. She joked that everything was from a package. The Norwegians love their tubed meat and tinned mackerel with tomato sauce. And they love butter too.\n\nThat night, we attended an experimental dance performance mounted by a Swedish dance troupe. It involved about a dozen dancers interacting with a giant curtain of stretchable fabric. Parts of it were really engaging, but most of it was too experimental for me, especially after the curtain was dropped to the stage and the dancers began bundling it up with cords while crawling on the floor in slow motion.\n\nAfterwards, we took a walk along the docks of Tjuvholm, with the old Arkshus fortress glowing across the water. We found an Italian restaurant there on the pier – Olivia – and ducked in for a simple dinner of pizza and tiramisu.\n\nOslo is far from the most cosmopolitan city in Europe. Despite its high net worth, Norway still lags behind its peers in pop culture and fashion, as my friend Sjøgren laments. But the culinary scene there seems to be awakening, if not burgeoning. When I last visited nine years ago, only the storied Bagatelle (opened since the 1930s) passed for fine dining. Now, chefs like Esben Holmboe Bang and Even Ramsvik are putting Oslo on the culinary map, and hopefully, mentoring young chefs who will grow the Oslo dining culture in the near future. The rise of the hipster culture has even brought great, third-wave coffee roasters and brewers, like Tim Wendelboe, to the fore (you’ll find his micro roasterie and café a couple of blocks off the Olaf Ryes plass). And there were so many other exciting new restaurants, coffee shops, and bars, recommended to me by friends and locals alike, that I didn’t have time to explore on this trip. I look forward to doing so next time.\n\nHere are the restaurants that I visited in Oslo. They are hyperlinked to photos that I took at each meal.\n\nMaaëmo\n\nOlivia Tjuvholmen\n\nYlajali\n\n~\n\n~\n\nPhotos: A cabin half-buried in snow near Finse, Norway; a giant leg and sneaker as installation art in an underground parking lot in Tjuvholm, Oslo; the dark and elegant dining room of Maaemo in Oslo; Maaemo from the second-floor landing; Pontus Dahlgren steeping mushroom broth with a coffee siphon at Maaemo; Esben Holmboe Bang presents a gorgeous roasted duck breast at Maaemo; brown butter ice cream with molasses at Maaemo; the dining room at Ylajali in Oslo; Even Ramsvik presenting turbot baked in hay at Ylajali; an aromafusion of apple, tea, an tarragon at Ylajali; griddling ørskog svele (mini pancakes) at Ylajali; the Arkshus fortress at night, from the docks at Tjuvohlm.\n\n~\n\nMy only complaint about my visit to Kyoto is that it was too short.\n\nThe imperial capital of Japan for over a millennia (the capital was moved to Edo – modern-day Tokyo – in the second half of the 19th Century), Kyoto is full of history and culture. Thankfully, much of it is preserved for us to explore today. And forty-eight hours is hardly enough time to do so.\n\nBut my friend and guide, Tomo, helped maximize our hours there.\n\n[This is the long-overdue second post in a series of posts about my trip to Japan in March. You can read the first post here.]\n\n~\n\n~\n\nWe took the bullet train to Kyoto from Tokyo Station.\n\nTokyo Station is immense. It’s like an underground city unto itself. Before boarding our train, Tomo took me to Matsuri, a shop that specializes in bento boxes, which are a popular “pastime” for commuters.\n\nThe selection, which represented regional cuisines of all of the prefectures of Japan, was overwhelming. There were, easily, over a hundred different boxes (perhaps even two hundred), including one featured bento box of the month (this display of plastic bento boxes near the door offered a quick survey). The variety was incredible: meat, fish, rice, noodles, dumplings, sushi – almost anything you could imagine or want. And the packaging varied in size and shape, each one ergonomically tailored to its contents. I chose a bento box from the island prefecture of Niigata. Inside the long, narrow box were about a half-dozen mackerel oshizushi neatly wrapped in persimmon leaves. The fish, which had been lightly marinated, was fresh, and the rice was perfectly seasoned and cooked. I washed it down with some chilled, black tea, and capped it with doriyaki (think two silver dollar pancakes filled with red bean paste). I marveled that I could eat so simply, and yet so well, while watching the Japanese countryside fly by me at warp speed.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nI was told that Kyoto is so densely crowded with shrines and temples that the subway system, which is not allowed to tunnel beneath sacred ground, is not as comprehensive or accessible as it should be. In many cases, taking a bus is more practical, especially when visiting temples. (There are 17 UNESCO World Heritage sites in Kyoto.)\n\nWe devoted one day to visiting these historic, religious sites. To pack in as much sightseeing as possible, we hired a family friend of Tomo’s, who is a tour guide in Kyoto, to drive us from temple to temple. We hit three, major temples, in addition to many minor temples and shrines along the way. The Kiyomizu-dera temple, which is the most visited site in Kyoto (attracting more than 4 million visitors a year) was impressive in its scope and panoramic vistas. Perched on the side of the mountain, the temple’s hondo, or main hall, is also impressive for its network of wooden stilts and cross-beams constructed without nails. But the temple grounds were so choked with tourists that it was hard to enjoy my time there.\n\nWe found the grounds of the Kinkaku-Ji temple just as crowded, owing to its flamboyantly decked “Golden Pavilion,” which is literally covered in gold. It is breathtaking, especially when seen in double, mirrored on the pond before it. But as eye-catching as the pavilion was, I was particularly attracted to a tiny waterfall that we found along the path. Our guide explained that a tall, slender rock was positioned under the cascade to resemble a fish fighting its way up the fall. Known as the Toryumon (or the Dragon Gate Waterfall), it represents the Chinese legend that any fish that can swim up a waterfall will become a dragon.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nI preferred the secluded calm of the Ginkaku-Ji, a former Zen temple known for its “Silver Pavillion.” Unlike the Golden Pavilion, the Silver Pavilion was never finished, and remains a modest, wooden structure (which probably explains why it receives far less foot traffic than the showier temples). I especially loved the moss-covered woods just beyond the temple gardens, veined with roots centuries old.\n\nLikewise, our afternoon stroll through the immense Daitokuji Temple complex, and visit to the lovely Koto-in temple within it (an important landmark in the history of Japanese tea ceremony), was wonderfully peaceful. We practically had the place to ourselves.\n\nOur day of touring ended among the thousands of vermillion torii at the colorful Fushimi Inari Shrine. Torii are wooden gates that are most often seen at the entrances to Shinto shrines, like this one. At Fushimi Inari, they stretch for kilometers up the side of a mountain, breaking only at minor shrines along the way.\n\nIn the middle of the day, we had stopped for a quick lunch at Yubasen. As its name suggests, this restaurant specializes in yuba – the elastic “skin” that is a byproduct of making tofu. Despite the rather casual appearance of the restaurant’s interior, the food was well-made. Some of the main course options for the set lunch menu were curiously out of synch with the rest of the menu (lamb chops with red wine sauce was an option, if I recall correctly). But, I really loved the milky, soybean broth we were served, with silky tofu suspended in it. There was also a hearty stack of yuba in a warm, clear, dashi, that was pretty unforgettable.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nOn another day, Tomo and I grazed our way through the Nishiki Market, Kyoto’s largest, and most well-known market. Unlike most markets, which occupy square blocks, this one runs linearly across multiple blocks along one street. Here, we found shops and stalls devoted to a wide range of goods and foods, like forged cutlery, pickled vegetables, rice, and fish cakes. We even stumbled upon a store that focused exclusively on a type of sesame known as “golden sesame.” Tomo and I couldn’t resist ordering a cone of sesame soft serve topped with toasted golden sesame.\n\nLater, we walked through the great Arashiyama bamboo forest, marveling at the limber stalks that seemed to shoot out of a ground littered with red camellia blossoms. Their whispy tops, swaying in the wind, towered high above us.\n\nAfterwards, we lingered a while on the banks of the Hozu River, enjoying the afternoon sun, before making our way back to the train station to return to the city for dinner with friends.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nFor lunch, we stopped at Souhonke Yudofu Okutan Kiyomizu (総本家ゆどうふ奥丹清水), a restaurant specializing in tofu. The restaurant, lined in tatami – the straw mats that require guests to leave their shoes at the door – was set among wooded gardens that were meticulously manicured and beautifully framed by floor-to-ceiling windows.\n\nThe tables here were low, requiring us to kneel, or sit pan-legged on the tatami. Sunken into the middle of our table was a gas flame that was used to heat our clay pot of tofu.\n\nThe set lunch was simple, but good. It started with a few cold dishes, including a bowl of grated Japanese mountain yam. Slimy and mucousy, it had to be slurped from the bowl, helped along with chopsticks. There was a block of chargrilled tofu, glazed with a surprisingly sweet kinome and white miso paste.\n\nThe house-made tofu could be ordered in varying degrees of firmness. We ordered both the “firm” and “delicate” tofu, which came stacked in a clay pot around a small vase filled with dashi. All of it was bathed in a light broth, which kept the contents of the clay pot hot. With one hand holding my bowl, I used the other to fish out a block of tofu with a flat ladle that was perfectly designed for the job. While the texture of the two types of tofu were certainly distinguishable, I was pleasantly surprised by how soft the firm tofu was. I was also surprised by how sweet and milky the tofu tasted, reminding me of the natural sweetness of the freshly squeezed soybean milk I used to have for breakfast in Taiwan as a kid. It was incredibly fresh.\n\nDespite being known for its tofu, Souhonke Yudofu Okutan Kyomizu makes pretty good tempura too. For our last course, we were presented with a small assortment of vegetables encased in gossamer shells, including a beautifully fried leaf of shiso. With these tempura vegetables came a bowl of warm rice with pickles. It was such a gratifying end that we waved off dessert.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nRich with history and culture, Kyoto seemed like an especially appropriate place to have a kaiseki meal, a traditional, multi-course dinner that celebrates seasonal ingredients with artistic, cultural, and philosophical references. Tomo arranged for us to have two.\n\nThe first night, we ate at Ifuki in the historic, Gion district of Kyoto. That meal deserves its own blog post, which shall follow this one.\n\nThe second night, we ate at the three Michelin-starred Kichisen, near the Shimogamo-jinja Shrine.\n\nOur meal there was odd and exquisite all at once.\n\nOur party of four was seated at a table in a private room. Tomo had requested this to spare our lazy American butts and knees from having to kneel on a tatami through dinner (I was especially thankful for this, since Tomo and I had knelt on a hard, tatami floor that afternoon for a traditional, Japanese tea ceremony). The room was vast – it could easily have seated fifty or more. But that, in itself, was generosity.\n\nWhat was odd was some of the food, and the service, which, though well-meaning, at times was a bit clumsy and negligent. Especially odd was an inexplicable invasion of fruit flies, which plagued us the entire night.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nFor the most part, the food at Kichisen was well-made. At its best, it was great, like a meaty trunk of bamboo shoot, served with seaweed and garnished with kinome. There was also a comforting clay pot of rice paved with baby anchovies and decorated with rapeseed florets. And for dessert, we were all wowed by a passion fruit filled with passion fruit sorbet. The server gave us a flask of Suntory V.S.O.P. brandy and encouraged us to pour liberally into our frozen fruit cups. We had no problem following instructions. Though I’m tempted to admit that brandy probably pairs well with most fruit, it seemed to pair especially well with passion fruit.\n\nAs beautiful and stunning as some of the presentations at Kichisen were, the overall production came across as more glossy than sincere, perhaps pitched more towards a Western audience (Why wasn’t I surprised when they handed me a press packet with a DVD as I left the restaurant?). The sakura (cherry blossom) trout that arrived “sizzling” on a slice of pineapple atop a hot stone, with avocado and tomato sauce, was a good example of this. It was bit of a head-scratcher, and overcooked.\n\nNigiri were formed into cute, bite-sized balls, stacked on top of each other. These arrived under beautiful, bamboo cages. When one of our servers raised one of the cages to reveal the sushi, he knocked over the stack of nigiri, sending the balls rolling and some of the ikura spilling. Instead of offering to replace the dish, he simply apologized and left. We then realized that we had one plate of nigiri to share between two diners. This wasn’t a problem, except there were four types of nigiri, and only one of each kind on the plate. At a restaurant of this caliber and class, this seemed stingy (This happens a lot on petits fours plates, and it always irks me. Just stick another one on there so your guests don’t have to decide who gets which!).\n\nDid the service seemed detached because we literally were detached, eating in a cavernous annex far from the warmth and glow of the kitchen? Was that our mistake?\n\nMaybe, on a different night, with different servers, under different circumstances, Kichisen offers a three Michelin-starred experience. The night we went, it fell short of that standard.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nBy day, Kyoto bustled with business and tourists alike. But by night, Kyoto was magical, with its streams and bridges, and hauntingly stoic temples and shrines looming quietly in the dark. Geishas meted out a soft, steady click-clack, click-clack on their way home. And cyclist whirred past on boulevards glowing with cherry blossoms.\n\nAs I said, forty-eight hours was hardly enough. I’m not sure a lifetime would even be enough.\n\nFrom Kyoto, we headed back towards Tokyo, stopping in Osaka for one night. When I have time, I’ll continue my report there.\n\n~\n\nPhotos: A geisha in the night in the historic Gion District of Kyoto; tourists dress up in kimonos to visit the Golden Pavilion at the Kinkaku-ji Temple in Kyoto; the Golden Pavilion at the Kinkaku-ji Temple; a peaceful scene at the Koto-in Temple in Kyoto; the bamboo forest at Arashiyama, littered with camellia blossoms; tofu in a clay pot at Souhonke Yudofu Okutan Kyomizu; the entrance to three Michelin-starred Kichisen in Kyoto; peas in a sweet broth at Kichisen; two maikos, arm-in-arm, on the streets of Kyoto.\n\n~\n\nAnd finally, the twelfth night.\n\nThe last day of the Twelve Days of Christmas is fraught with mixed emotions. For the staff, there are nerves about the menu, which, year-after-year, seems to spring out of Christopher Kostow’s mind at the last minute. There’s always a marked bump in energy, as the cooks reclaim their kitchen – without a guest chef to host, the workflow seems leaner, more efficient. There’s the anticipation of the holidays, and a much needed break from the exhausting run of the dinner series. And for a few, it’s the bittersweet end of a chapter; a move, a new job, the last shift.\n\nI’m there somewhere right in the middle. Although I’ve spent the last eleven posts talking about the guest chefs, their food, the vintners, and their wine, I’m going to take some time out of this report to tell you a little about my role and my perspective at the Twelve Days of Christmas.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nI first came to the Twelve Days of Christmas three years ago as a guest, with a small part to play in collaboration. And I’ve been lucky to have returned twice now as the photographer, an observer, and in my own way, a commentator and chronicler, who has also happened to have actually eaten at most of each year’s guest chefs’ restaurants (not entirely a coincidence, of course). That added context has enriched my experience and perspective tremendously.\n\nAlthough I’m sometimes so busy during the dinner series that I forget where I am, those moments are rare and short-lived. Twenty days and twenty nights at Meadowood Napa Valley, and twelve dinners at the Restaurant at Meadowood with some of the world’s most celebrated chefs aren’t exactly burdens to bear, and I’m mindful of that nearly every waking hour. It is a magical corner of the world during a magical time of the year, and I am very, very lucky to be able to experience it.\n\nThe staff accords me all of the privileges and care of a guest on property. And yet, as I’ve gotten to know many of them over the years, I’ve been made to feel very much like one of the family as well. For a good part of my year, Meadowood, quite literally, becomes my home away from home. I’ve known chef Kostow and his wife Martina before she was pregnant, then very pregnant, and, this year, made sure Elmo sipped from the cup instead of taking a bath in it (their daughter is incredibly cute, and incredibly in love with her red, furry friend). I’ve spent Thanksgiving with them. I’ve been to all of their staff Christmas parties (which are awesome, by the way). And some of us meet up for lunches and dinners on our days off. I’ve even become friends with some of the restaurant’s regulars, who I see every December, and sometimes in between.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nAll of this is to say that, although I am very much a fly on the wall at The Restaurant at Meadowood – the hired photographer who goes back to his room every night after dinner and edits photos into the early morning hours in order to turn them around for press the next day – I am, admittedly, not an impartial one. At the end of last year, I wrote about the slowly shifting ground beneath this blog. I’d like to think that I’ve been as open as possible about those blurred lines, acknowledging them, while trying to give some shape and order to them.\n\nAnd so, I feel it’s only fair, at the end of this year’s posts about the Twelve Days of Christmas, for me to say: Yes, they pay me to photograph for them. Yes, they put me up at Meadowood Napa Valley for nearly three weeks, where the thread count on the bedsheets is so high, they’re probably bullet-proof. Yes, we’re friends. And yes, in a lot of ways, I’m on Team Meadowood.\n\nBut to be fair, there aren’t any other rules. Christopher Kostow and his team don’t tell me what to do, and they don’t tell me what to write. I move through their space unhindered at all hours. I am free to express my opinion. And I do. And the fact that they ask me for it tells me that they really care. Personal preferences aside (I don’t like everything that comes out of their kitchen, and they know it — they know, for example, that I thought Kostow’s sweetbreads dish from night five was the clunker of this year’s series), there is a mutual respect and trust among us. Underneath the reams of press, the Michelin stars, the James Beard Awards, and the façade of a mighty restaurant that calmly maintains its excellence and relevance in a cutthroat industry, is a chef who just wants to cook good food with nice people. I see that every day that I have spent at the Restaurant at Meadowood. I see it in the cooks he keeps, and the way he works with them. He demands a lot from his kitchen staff, but he also invests an incredible amount in them (if I haven’t said it before, let me say it here: the Twelve Days of Christmas is an incredible opportunity for his cooks to stage in eleven different kitchens around the world in two weeks). As a result, his team is strong. I know some of the challenges that the staff members face (both front and back of the house), and see how they industriously overcome them. I’ve been privy to some of the problems they encounter, and the professionalism with which they respond. I taste the consistency, and experience the technical flawlessness of it all, night after night. And I feel, firsthand, the enthusiasm and talent that they pour into every day and every service. It is admirable.\n\nI’m on Team Meadowood because it’s a great one. They cheer for the nice guys, and so do I. I like their mission, I like their message. It’s one of good cheer and good food, of hospitality and charity. And I have no problem helping them spread it. I wouldn’t return, year-after-year, if I did.\n\nBut working with The Restaurant at Meadowood and writing about the Twelve Days of Christmas is merely representative of the bigger picture I’ve been painting in my little corner of the internet. This blog is, and has always been, about recording and sharing this magical and blessed life I lead, filled with adventure in extraordinary places with amazing food and passionate people. Christopher Kostow and his staff at The Restaurant at Meadowood play a part in that picture, one that I hope inspires others. Aspiration makes tomorrow an exciting time. As Kostow and I have reminded each other often: the day that we lose our sense of wonder about it all is the day we’re done.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nWhen Christopher Kostow walked into the kitchen the morning of the twelfth day, he gave me a nervous look. “I don’t know if this is going to work.”\n\nMany of the dishes he and his team presented at this last dinner were untested. They were ideas and flavors that had been bounced around the kitchen in various forms. But, they were relying on their collective talent and experience to bring it all together quickly.\n\nKatianna Weiner and outgoing line cook Coleman Griffin* were in one corner, glazing squab with elderberry sauce. They had fans trained on the birds to dry the glaze and the skin, important in getting a crispy, burnished crust later.\n\nLine cook Miles Pundsack-Poe was in another corner, trimming a mound of romanesco that gardner Christine Kim had hauled in from the restaurant’s garden at Kostow’s request. Kostow had this crazy idea of roasting them whole, torching them slightly to get a little color on the prehistoric-looking exterior, and carving them, like trimming Christmas trees, in the dining room. He was really nervous about this one.\n\nIn the pastry department, Jenna Hodges and Alyssa Tokumura were venturing into uncharted territory. They were packing pearl sugar and comice pears into molds shaped like pears. The idea was to bake the molds, causing the sugar to melt and form a pear-shaped crust around the pears within. Kostow wanted to crack the molds, table side, and spoon the warm, cooked pears over acorn bread perfumed with rosemary. He was really nervous about this one too.\n\nAnd morning sous chef Oliver Antunes, who had spent some time cooking in France, including under Yannick Alleno at Le Meurice in Paris, was trying his hand at making marrons glacés. His wife Sandra, who is a server in the front of the house, explained at line-up, in her adorable French accent, that the chestnuts had to be poached gently in simple syrup every day for a week (or more), until they were candied. A proper marron glacé should have an opaque look to it, taking on a waxy coat. Oliver was setting his chestnuts on the stove for one last simmer, hoping they’d finally achieve the look and texture he wanted.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nBut, in a very Shakespearean way, all was well that ended well on the twelfth night.\n\nThose birds were beautifully bronzed. The skin was crisp, and the meat was rosy and tender. The slices of breast meat nested with tournés of pumpkin under sheets of plum gelée and a shiso leaves.\n\nThere was a bit of drama getting the “Christmas trees” to stand up straight. But they went out, looking beautiful and perky. Cooks paraded them around the dining room before landing at carving stations to debranch the romanesco. The florets were set on creamy romanesco purée, and drizzled with a spoonful of sauce musky with hawayej – a spice with a curry-like flavor.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nThose pears turned out beautifully too. The “white coats” (as the cooks are called) accompanied the servers to the tables to help them crack open the sugary shells, purple with pomace (grape must), and scoop out the steaming pears within. This was a particularly fragrant dessert, with the grape must infused into the sugar, and the woodsy scent of rosemary throughout.\n\nAnd Oliver’s chestnuts couldn’t have been better. Just as his wife had described, they were translucent and tender, just like the fabled ones I’ve had Bernarchon in Lyon, France.\n\nEven Kostow’s rye crumpets, which he griddled for the first time earlier that day with success, came out better than expected. Sturdy and spongey, with that springiness that’s peculiar to crumpets, they made the perfect, buttery mattress for a thick schmear of minced raw aji and caviar; fancy Jewish appetizing for a Christmastime feast.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nThe house was packed. With Christopher Kostow cooking, and wines provided by one of three cult wineries associated with Meadowood Napa Valley – Screaming Eagle, Harlan Estate, and BOND Estate – seats for the twelfth night are always the first to sell out (this year was BOND Estate’s turn).\n\nMost who attend the twelfth dinner are friends of Meadowood. And so, there is a particularly familial atmosphere on the last night. This year, the guests seemed especially boisterous, with diners hopping from table to table, catching up with one another between courses, and lingering well past the last course over coffee and cocktails.\n\nIn the kitchen, the staff celebrated the end to the Twelve Days of Christmas with a round of Champagne, taking a moment to enjoy a last toast before they stripped all the counters and soaped everything down in preparation for the week-long holiday closure.\n\nWhen other guests find out what I’m doing at the Twelve Days of Christmas, they always ask: don’t you get tired of doing this? Three years, thirty-six dinners later, it still feels like magic to me. Maybe it’s the Christmastime spirit. Maybe it’s the smell of fresh pine as I reflect on the day during my quiet walk home every night after service. Maybe it’s the ever-changing palette of colors and flavors in the kitchen each day. Or maybe, it’s the cheery smiles and fist bumps I get every morning from the cooks as they trickle into the kitchen. No matter what happened the day before, every day is a new day, a better day. Who could get tired of that? I’ve still got that sense of wonder.\n\nTo all of Meadowood Napa Valley, The Restaurant at Meadowood (Chef Kostow, Nathaniel Dorn, the cooks, the wine team, and the front of the house staff), and this year’s guest chefs, I extend a heartfelt thanks for making December the highlight of my year.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nBelow, you’ll find the menu from the last night of the Twelve Days of Christmas with the Restaurant at Meadowood’s very own Christopher Kostow cooking, and wines by BOND.

In that time, he has become known for his shameless attempts to get in front of my camera in a sorely misguided attempt at fame (despite my repeated assurances that neither I, nor my blog can offer him any significant noteriety, even if he were to appear in every photo). On his last night with the restaurant, Christopher Kostow and Nathaniel Dorn, the restaurant’s director, decided to ambush him with a pasta party. The ingredients were pretty simple: flour, water, and eggs. Coleman: this won’t make you famous, but here’s your long awaited debut on this blog:\n\n~\n\nAnother year is gone, and I’ve barely written about it. This is especially sad to me, since so many wonderful things happened.\n\nEvery year, I pause at calendar’s end to record and remember the anxieties and adventures that made the preceding months memorable, including an accounting of all the restaurants I visited, and my favorite meals and dishes among them. With this blog post, I initiate that annual tradition.\n\nLast year, I commemorated 2013 with an honest look at my evolving career in photography and explored the blurring edges of my relationship with the restaurant community and my place within it. I questioned whether I could write responsibly about chefs and restaurants, given my increasing professional ties with them; or, whether I should write about them at all. Although I ended that blog post with a fair sense of resolution, those issues and concerns spilled over into 2014, as I considered them anew.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nAt the end of every year, I’m convinced that I’ve peaked, that no subsequent year could possibly beat the one before. And again, I’m happy to report that 2014 was my busiest and best year yet.\n\nMy days and weeks seemed to leapfrog over one another as I criss-crossed time zones hopping the globe, circling the Earth five times in the number of miles I flew (I always say, if you never sleep, you’re never jet-lagged). In many ways, it was a particularly liberating year for me as well. With a rapidly growing demand for my attention to photography, I finally escaped the long shadow of the practice of law, cutting loose some last, tangled threads that tethered me to that safety net.\n\nAs always, my work introduced me to some amazing people this year, and has taken me to some amazing places. I found joy in forging new partnerships and friendships, as well as strengthening ones that I’ve enjoyed developing over the past few years. I’m continually blessed with the opportunity to work with some of the best in their fields, and being granted generous access to the amazing worlds they inhabit. I’m eager to tell you about these adventures below, as I skip through the highlights of my year and work, and make a few disclaimers along the way. I’ll warn you now: the list is long, the detours are many. It’s more of a record for myself than for you, so feel free to ignore it.\n\nAnd, of course, I ate very well; shockingly well, actually. In my travels, I passed through a galaxy of over 75 Michelin stars, visiting well over 250 different restaurants in eight countries on three continents. As soon as I finish this post, I’ll turn to combing through them; cherry picking my favorite dishes, desserts and meals; and preparing my annual “best of” lists. When you see the full roster of restaurants that I visited this year at the bottom of this post, you’ll know that I have a particularly challenging task ahead of me.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nI eased into 2014 with a quiet January at home in Kansas City. I spent much of it planning for the months ahead, and tinkering with a potential job offer that would set me on a different course. In many ways, that job was a dream job for me. It offered great travel opportunities and perks, and, more importantly, the opportunity and excitement of building something new, something potentially great. And, I felt uniquely well-suited to its requirements. However, I didn’t feel that I would be fairly compensated for the amount and type of work I’d be doing. More significantly, it would end my status as a free agent. I left the corporate world in hopes of building something for myself instead of for someone else. I wanted to own and make something out of the patch of earth on which I stand. I had spent enough time playing on other people’s teams, where the main incentive for loyalty and performance was a financial one. It was time for me to focus on Team Me.\n\nSo, when the formal job offer came, I walked away.*\n\n~\n\n~\n\nThe following few months put me back on the road. In February, I was in Chicago, and then in St. Helena, where I was invited to speak at the 10th annual Wine Writers Symposium at Meadowood Napa Valley (I was asked to present on the subject of photography). Coming to the symposium and subject as an outsider and novice, I relished sitting on the sidelines – a third-party observer with no pony in the race – considering the differing (and sometimes, strong) opinions and perspectives of industry leaders on a subject steeped in as much science as myth.\n\nOf particular note was the keynote address, delivered by wine titan Robert Parker to an audience of friends, admirers, and detractors alike. I can’t give the exchange justice here, so I will refer you to Jon Bonné, the resident wine writer for the San Francisco Chronicle, who issued a detailed account from a more knowledgeable (albeit, in my opinion, biased) vantage. [In that post, Bonné links to another thoughtfully written recap of Parker’s keynote address by David White of the Terroirist blog.]\n\nPerhaps I sympathized with Mr. Parker, a fellow former attorney, because I found him wonderfully articulate and rather well-prepared to take on his jury (more specifically, I was impressed that he anticipated precisely the allegations against him, and had pointed rebuttals at the ready). Or maybe it’s because I don’t wholly dislike his preferences in wine (“bombastic” isn’t such a dirty word to me). But I found some of the criticism against him unfair.\n\nBut, I also empathize with those who take issue with Mr. Parker (or the institution of taste for which he is accused of standing), and with some of what Messrs. Bonné and White had to say about those points of disagreement. At the risk of making a complete fool of myself: if I’m understanding the issues correctly, and if I may analogize the wine industry to the restaurant industry (about which I feel much more confident discussing) to show that I do, then the “Parker Effect” is sort of like that dumb San Pellegrino World’s 50 Best Restaurants list (against which I have railed on this site). The objection is not to the opinions held by these arbiters of taste, but rather with the absoluteness and authority with which their opinions are advanced and to which they are ascribed in a dangerous snowball of hype and ignorance. Adding fuel to this are the shameless wineries and chefs who see profit in advancing these opinions. They not only cater to them, but promote them as well, thereby taking advantage of a relatively uninformed and impressionable consumer base. If this is the issue, then yes, I agree, there is a problem. However, those arbiters of taste — Parker and the San Pellegrino committee – are only a small part of it. The far greater challenge, in my opinion, lies in educating consumers, so that they can be discerning judges of taste and quality for themselves. Instead of telling me what’s good, tell me what I need to know in order to determine whether it’s good. This isn’t being done enough in the food writing world.\n\n[In a last-minute effort to avoid totally embarrassing myself in the company of experts at this symposium, I read Bonné’s book “New California Wine.” It not only provided a good framework for the history of California winemaking, and mapped out the states’s geographic points of winemaking significance, but was also an informative and well-presented opinion about a growing school of preference in California winemaking and drinking.]\n\n~\n\n~\n\nMarch and April marked a high point in my year.\n\nI stopped briefly in Paris to eat and catch up with some friends before moving on to the Flemish fields of Belgium to check off a few of lingering bucket list entries. (You’ll find my post about the Paris and Belgian parts of this trip here.)\n\nAnd then, Norway. I started on the country’s rugged west coast in Bergen and worked my way east to Oslo, where I was last seen in 2005.\n\nIn the middle of March, I returned to Aubergine in Carmel-by-the-Sea to photograph the second-annual Rediscovering Coastal Cuisine dinner hosted by chef Justin Cogley. John Shields (of Riverstead Inn) returned as a guest chef, joined this year by Kyle Connaughton (of unnamed restaurant in Healdsburg, California), Dave Beran (of Next in Chicago), Blaine Wetzel (of Willows Inn on Lummi Island, Washington), Justin Woodward (of Castagna in Portland, Oregon), and Stephanie Prida (pastry chef at Manresa in Los Gatos, California). It was another terrific weekend, full of fun, food, and friends. Among the highlights was a private tour of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, where we got to feed bluefin tuna from the rafters, dropping feed from twenty feet above the circling fish. I also loved the morning we spent wading among the crystal-clear tidal pools of the windswept coast of the Monterey Bay peninsula, as well as a hike we took through the seaside cliff trails of Point Lobos State Reserve. And, of course, how could I forget a laugh-filled and breathtakingly scenic road trip down Highway 1 to Big Sur with friends? That stretch of American coastline is one of the most beautiful parts of our world. If you haven’t been, ma"
