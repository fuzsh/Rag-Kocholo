        "meta_description": "Information about upcoming pain strongly influences pain experience in experimental and clinical settings, but little is known about the brain mechanisms that link expectation and experience. To identify the pathways by which informational cues influence perception, analyses must jointly consider both the effects of cues on brain responses and the relationship between brain responses and changes in reported experience. Our task and analysis strategy were designed to test these relationships. Auditory cues elicited expectations for barely painful or highly painful thermal stimulation, and we assessed how cues influenced human subjects' pain reports and brain responses to matched levels of noxious heat using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We used multilevel mediation analysis to identify brain regions that (1) are modulated by predictive cues, (2) predict trial-to-trial variations in pain reports, and (3) formally mediate the relationship between cues and reported pain. Cues influenced heat-evoked responses in most canonical pain-processing regions, including both medial and lateral pain pathways. Effects on several regions correlated with pretask expectations, suggesting that expectancy plays a prominent role. A subset of pain-processing regions, including anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, and thalamus, formally mediated cue effects on pain. Effects on these regions were in turn mediated by cue-evoked anticipatory activity in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventral striatum, areas not previously directly implicated in nociception. These results suggest that activity in pain-processing regions reflects a combination of nociceptive input and top-down information related to expectations, and that anticipatory processes in OFC and striatum may play a key role in modulating pain processing.",

        "text": "fMRI task design.\n\nAfter calibration and training, fMRI images were acquired during eight functional runs (eight trials/run, 64 trials). The thermode was placed on a different skin site for each run, with two total runs per skin site.\n\nOn each trial, a 2 s predictive cue was followed by a 6 s anticipatory interval during which a fixation cross was presented on the screen (Fig. 1). Thermal stimulation was then delivered via the thermode for 10 s (1.5 s ramp up from baseline (32°C), 7 s at peak destination temperature, 1.5 s return to baseline) at levels calibrated to elicit ratings of high, medium, or low pain in pseudorandom order. Following thermal stimulation, a fixation cross was presented for a 14 s fixed interstimulus interval (ISI). The words “How painful?” then appeared on the screen for 4 s above an eight-point visual analog scale (VAS). Participants rated the intensity of the preceding stimulus using an fMRI-compatible track ball (Resonance Technologies) with resolution equivalent to the screen resolution (i.e., ∼600 discrete values between 1 and 8). The 14 s delay between pain offset and rating was included to maximize our ability to isolate pain period responses; pilot testing demonstrated that there was no difference in the magnitude of cue effects between ratings made immediately after stimulus offset and those made after a delay. Following the rating, a 10 s ISI concluded the trial.\n\nThere were four types of trials. On low cue plus low pain (LL) trials, low-pain cues were followed by slightly painful stimulation (level 2 based on the pain calibration procedure). On high cue plus high pain (HH) trials, high-pain cues were followed by highly painful stimulation (level 8). On low cue plus medium pain (LM) trials, low-pain cues were followed by moderately painful stimulation (level 5). Finally, on high cue plus medium pain (HM) trials, high-pain cues were followed by moderately painful stimulation (level 5). Thus, the temperatures administered in the critical LM and HM trials were identical, but cue-related expectations were that pain would either be higher or lower than what was actually administered; importantly, the discrepancy between expected and actual stimulus intensity was equal for HM and LM trials, but opposite in sign.\n\nParticipants first experienced two runs of trials evenly divided between LL and HH trials, in pseudorandom order. This phase served primarily to establish cue-outcome relationships. These were followed by six runs of trials equally divided between LL, HH, LM, and HM trials. The order of conditions was pseudorandomized so that each trial occurred at each position within a run, and runs were counterbalanced across subjects using a Latin Square design, with the stipulation that the first two trials of Run 3 be either LL or HH trials. To optimize the likelihood of observing cue-based expectancy effects within the critical medium trials, participants were never informed that medium stimulation would be delivered.\n\nIn this report, we examined brain responses evoked during the 10 s thermal stimulation period and the 8 s anticipatory period. The model used to quantify these responses is described in detail below. Contrasts between HH and LL trials examined activity across all runs (1–8), while multilevel mediation analyses of pain-evoked and cue-evoked responses (analysis 1 and analysis 2), which focused on HM and LM trials, were conducted on trials from runs 3–8. Trials on which subjects failed to register a rating were excluded from both behavioral and imaging analyses (M = 0.67, SD = 0.9).\n\nWhole-brain multilevel mediation.\n\nStandard fMRI models, such as those we use to examine intensity processing (HH−LL and HH−HM, described above) assess the relationship between experimental manipulations and brain activity or between brain activity and behavior. Mediation analyses extend the univariate model by incorporating an additional outcome variable (perceived pain in analysis 1, PPN response in analysis 2). The path model jointly tests three effects that are required if a brain region links predictive cue with the outcome: cue effects on brain activity, the relationship between brain activity and the outcome, and formal mediation effects. Each effect is described in detail below.\n\nIn the principal model we present here (analysis 1), the initial variable (X) in the path model is the experimentally manipulated predictive cue (which takes on values of 1 for high-pain cue [H], and −1 for low-pain cue [L]), and the outcome variable (Y) is the subject's series of ratings on medium pain trials (Fig. 2). The total effect of X on Y reflects the observed behavioral effects of predictive cue on reported pain and is referred to as path c. The mediating variable (M) is a single voxel's series of AUC estimates during medium pain stimulation. The direct effect of X on Y or the effect of predictive cue on reported pain controlling for the mediator (e.g., voxelwise activity) is referred to as path c′. In analysis 2, the initial variable is the same (X, H − L cue), but Y is replaced with the series of average pain period AUC estimates for PPN mediator activity. The mediating variable in analysis 2 is each voxel's series of anticipation period AUC estimates. For simplicity, the following descriptions of path effects focus on analysis 1.\n\nOne effect of interest is the effect of predictive cue on brain activity, which we refer to as path a or “cue effects.” This is equivalent to the [HM − LM] contrast in a standard GLM analysis. The path a effect therefore lines up closely with previous approaches to cue-based pain modulation (e.g., Koyama et al., 2005; Keltner et al., 2006). However, we compared two conditions with the same temperature but equal and opposite deviations from expectation, whereas in previous studies trials on which expectancies were violated (invalid cues) were compared to validly cued trials. Although this means we were not able to compare our expectancy effects to a validly cued medium intensity stimulus, with our design it was possible to test whether pain was influenced by the valence of participants' expectations, holding constant the degree of ambiguity.\n\nA second effect of interest is the association between brain activity (M) and reported pain (Y), which we refer to as path b or “report-related responses.” As is standard in directed path models, path b is assessed while controlling for X (H − L cue) so that significant relationships between brain activity and pain are assessed controlling for the experimental task manipulation. This means that path a and path b are uncorrelated under the null hypothesis of no mediation and that they identify two separable processes that are likely to contribute to cue-based modulation of perceived pain: (1) the effect of predictive cues on pain-evoked responses (path a); and (2) the relationship between pain-evoked responses and subjective pain (path b). The path b effect thereby identifies regions that predict trial-to-trial variations in reported pain, controlling for both cue and temperature—in other words, regions that predict endogenously driven variations in pain. This parametric approach is related to recent approaches to studying pain (Coghill et al., 1999; Craig et al., 2000; Bornhövd et al., 2002; Büchel et al., 2002; Mohr et al., 2005; Wiech et al., 2006; Rolls et al., 2008), economic value (Hare et al., 2008; Plassmann et al., 2008; Chib et al., 2009), and other applications that identify brain regions that predict parametric variations in behavior on a within-subjects basis. However, our path b effects provide an additional level of specificity, identifying voxels that predict variability controlling for differences associated with task effects (controlling for X). The path b test can therefore identify regions that contribute to subjective pain reports that may have little, if anything, to do with either nociception (such as those involved in decision making and evaluative judgments) or with cues. Thus, this effect provides complementary yet quite distinct information to traditional parametric analysis or conjunctions across parametric regressors and is closely aligned with recent work examining relationships between prestimulus fluctuations in ongoing brain activity and variability in reported pain (Boly et al., 2007; Ploner et al., 2010). We note that this component of the path model is essentially correlational and, unlike with path a, we cannot make strong claims about causality, as neither brain activity nor reports are directly manipulated. We therefore included tests of models with reversed directionality (e.g., cues affect reports, which affects brain activity) in key PPN mediator regions to assess qualitative differences in path coefficients; however, strong inferences about the causality of PPN-pain report relationships are beyond the scope of this paper and are best addressed by invasive manipulation of the brain (Schnitzler and Ploner, 2000; Lefaucheur et al., 2001; Graff-Guerrero et al., 2005; Bestmann et al., 2008; Nahmias et al., 2009).\n\nFinally, a mediation test provides inference on whether the inclusion of brain activity (M) in the model explains a significant amount of the covariance between pain predictive cue (X) and reported pain (Y). In the case of single-level mediation, this is equivalent to testing the product of the path coefficients a × b (Baron and Kenny, 1986; Shrout and Bolger, 2002; Kenny et al., 2003), i.e., c-c′ = a × b (MacKinnon et al., 1995). The mediation test thus assesses whether the mediator explains a significant amount of the effect of the manipulated variable on the measured outcome. It involves tests comparing the strength of the relationships between variables across two separate regression equations rather than testing unique variance associated with two regressors in the same model.\n\nWe have developed a multilevel formulation of the path model that provides a voxelwise, mixed-effects mediation analysis that assesses relationships between the task design, brain activity, and behavior and treats the participant as a random effect (see Wager et al., 2009 for details of the method). This analysis can provide information about brain-behavior relationships at two levels. The first level accounts for the relationships between dynamic variations across time (within individual participants) in cue-evoked expectancy, brain activity, and pain reports. Previous work has examined dynamic report-related activity in the context of manipulated expectancies (Koyama et al., 2005). Mediation analysis extends this research by testing whether activity in voxels formally links cue-based expectancy effects to reports. Controlling for cue (path b) ensures that brain activity actually predicts variations in report, avoiding regions whose activity covaries with reports simply because both are independently affected by cues with no direct brain-behavior relationship. The second level tests for consistency across individuals, allowing population inference, and accounts for known sources of variations in individual pathway strength (i.e., person-level moderators) (Kenny et al., 2003). Multilevel mediation analysis differs from standard between-subjects brain-behavior correlations, because correlations across subjects only capture whether individual differences in brain activity (e.g., average reductions in PPN responses under placebo) and behavior (e.g., average reductions in reported pain) are related. They cannot provide a full account of the mechanisms by which expectancies dynamically modulate behavior (e.g., links between expectancy, brain activity, and trial-by-trial pain reports within subjects). Multilevel mediation analysis provides more direct evidence of the ongoing relationships between pain-predictive cue, brain activity, and reported pain within subjects.\n\nCritically, the a × b mediation test in a multilevel path model is not equivalent to testing whether the conjunction (intersection) of both path a and path b effects are significant. In a single-level path model, the mediation test is significant in a subset of models that show both a and b effects. However, multilevel mediation can identify regions that show evidence for mediation even if the average a and b effects are not significant alone because of an additional component for the covariance (cov) of path a and path b estimates. This is expressed concisely by Kenny et al. (2003) in their Equation 9, which captures the following relationship: mean(a × b) = mean(a) × mean(b) + cov(a,b). Hence, the a × b effect can be driven by two different sources: the product of the means of a and b and the covariance between a and b. Thus, part of what creates a significant mediation effect is whether path a (cue effects) and path b (report-related responses) show reliable relationships; but another part is whether the individuals who show strong path a effects also show strong path b effects. This allows us to identify voxels that contribute to the overall relationship between cue and pain report but show individual differences in each of these paths (i,e. differences in regression slopes). In the case of positive mediation driven by covariance, subjects who show greater activity in response to high-pain cues also report greater pain with greater activity in the region, while subjects who show less activity in response to high-pain cues report greater pain with less activity. The functional significance of such regions, which contribute strongly to the positive relationship between cues and reported pain in both cases, would never be identified through standard regression analyses of path a or path b alone, which only identify regions with consistent effects across subjects. These patterns may point to the existence of a second-level moderator (i.e., individual differences variable) that might explain the covariance between the paths; here, we test whether individual differences in pretask expectancy help explain variations in within-subjects pathway strength.\n\nWe implemented the multilevel path analysis in a voxelwise analysis framework that we have termed “mediation effect parametric mapping” (MEPM) (Wager et al., 2008, 2009) using a custom Matlab toolbox (T.D.W.). MEPM was conducted as by Wager et al. (2008, 2009), with additional facilities incorporated to address the multilevel case. We used bootstrap significance testing, which provides more sensitive tests of mediation (Bollen and Stine, 1990; Stone and Sobel, 1990; Efron and Tibshirani, 1993; Shrout and Bolger, 2002). In our second-level analysis, we employ Efron's bias-corrected, accelerated bootstrap (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993) to test the significance of all effects (a, b, and a × b). We estimated distributions of subject level path coefficients by randomly sampling with replacement 10,000 observations (rows) from the matrix of [a b a × b] path coefficients for each voxel. Two-tailed, uncorrected p values were calculated from the bootstrap confidence interval.\n\nIn sum, the multilevel MEPM framework allowed us to test mediation effects on each voxel in a search region and identify brain voxels that show path a, path b, and mediation (a × b) effects. In analysis 1 we identified brain voxels whose heat-evoked responses mediated cue effects on reported pain, focusing on mediators identified within the PPN. In analysis 2, we searched for voxels whose anticipatory responses contributed to (i.e., mediated) cue effects on the PPN mediators identified in analysis 1."
