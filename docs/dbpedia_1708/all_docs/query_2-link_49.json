        "text": "Respiratory muscle weakness in critically ill patients may result from hyperinflation, neuropathies, myopathies, metabolic abnormalities, decreased oxygen delivery, and medications [29]. Myopathies are subdivided into several categories that include critical illness myopathy, sepsis-associated myopathy, ventilator-associated respiratory muscle injury, disuse atrophy, metabolic disturbances, and medications [29]. Another classification based on histology may be useful [21] but consideration of muscle unexcitability without muscle structural disarrangement is also possible [30]. In the sickest patients, it is likely that multiple factors take effect simultaneously. In addition, some factors (sepsis, injuriously high inspiratory efforts) present before admission in the ICU can contribute to diaphragm weakness and may in fact precipitate the need for mechanical ventilation. Certain patient factors may also prevent diaphragm weakness: one experimental model suggested a protective role for obesity [31]. We now summarize the complex interplay of contributors to diaphragm weakness before admission and during the ICU stay (Fig. 3).\n\nMechanisms of diaphragm weakness at the time of ICU admission\n\nHypercapnic respiratory failure\n\nAcute hypercapnia increases neural drive through chemoreflex activation; its effects on diaphragm contractility during spontaneous breathing are conflicting. In one study conducted in healthy subjects exposed to acute changes in CO2, diaphragm force was reduced [32]. Separately, hypercapnia did not intensify long-lasting fatigue but slightly reduced diaphragm contractility immediately after maximum voluntary ventilation [33]. However, no significant change in twitch pressure was reported while subjects breathed CO2 [34] or produced maximal contraction [33]. In vitro, respiratory acidosis induces diaphragm weakness in non-ventilated rats whereas metabolic acidosis has no effect [35]. In clinical practice, acute hypercapnia could contribute to clinical deterioration by favoring diaphragm weakness.\n\nCardiogenic shock\n\nCardiogenic shock is associated with both an increase in diaphragm work and a reduction in diaphragm oxygen delivery. The imbalance between oxygen supply and demand can ultimately result in diaphragm fatigue. This was demonstrated in dogs exposed to cardiogenic shock with tamponade, in which a marked reduction in Pdi was noted after 1 h despite an increase in central drive, ultimately causing death [36] (Fig. 4). Low cardiac output impairs respiratory muscle blood flow and the diaphragm may shift to anaerobic metabolism resulting in muscular lactate production [37]. Mechanical ventilation and muscle paralysis spare a large fraction of cardiac output used by the working respiratory muscles [38]. In one study highlighting the critical importance of respiratory muscle failure in shock states, spontaneously breathing dogs with cardiogenic shock were much more likely to die from ventilatory failure compared to mechanically ventilated dogs [37].\n\nSepsis\n\nBoth severe diaphragm weakness and increased susceptibility to injury and fatigue have been documented in animal models of sepsis [39,40,41]. Sepsis impairs diaphragm force apart from any effect on muscle mass or architecture [41], suggesting an important role for systemic inflammation. Sepsis acts at two levels [42]. First, disturbances in different steps of the chain of muscular energy supply including altered blood flow distribution (hypoxic ischemia) and use (cytopathic ischemia). Second, direct impairment of the contractile proteins resulting from the action of septic mediators such as cytokines can also result in dysfunction. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) has been shown to mediate the detrimental effects of endotoxin administration on the contractile function of the diaphragm [43].\n\nSystemic inflammation also renders the diaphragm more sensitive to load-related injury, possibly by increasing sarcolemma membrane fragility [44]. In septic rats undergoing controlled mechanical ventilation, sepsis exacerbated diaphragm weakness resulting from controlled mechanical ventilation [45]. In the ICU, patients with sepsis are more likely to exhibit diaphragm atrophy [46]. Sepsis can be present early during the ICU stay as a primary reason for admission or later, complicating the course. Interestingly, experimental findings suggest that mechanical ventilation could alleviate the harmful effects of sepsis on diaphragm function [44]. Sepsis is associated with diaphragm weakness in more than half of mechanically ventilated patients [2, 19], and the potential interactions between sepsis and mechanical ventilation on diaphragm function require greater attention.\n\nSurgery\n\nAbdominal surgery, in particular of the upper abdomen, is associated with postoperative respiratory complications in which diaphragm dysfunction is frequently implicated [47, 48]. Although pain or general anesthesia may contribute to the phenomenon, pain relief does not ameliorate postoperative diaphragm force [49] and general anesthesia performed for lower abdominal surgery does not lead to diaphragm weakness. The attenuated phrenic nerve output following stimulation of visceral or somatic phrenic afferent pathways during surgery has been proposed as a possible alternate mechanism [29]. Diaphragm weakness has also been reported after coronary bypass surgery [48, 50]. In this case, the phrenic nerve can be directly injured (surgical manipulations, ischemia, cardioprotection) leading to left hemidiaphragm or bilateral weakness with important clinical consequences.\n\nRisk factors for diaphragm weakness during ICU course\n\nSedatives, steroids, and neuromuscular blocking agents\n\nSedatives may have direct adverse effects on the diaphragm as well as promoting disuse. In patients undergoing anesthesia for elective surgery, propofol induces a decrease in the diaphragm’s capacity to generate pressure [51]. In ICU patients, the dose of propofol was correlated with the severity of diaphragm weakness [52]. Volatile anesthetics, some not in use anymore [53], have also been shown to cause diaphragm weakness [54].\n\nCorticosteroids have been associated with the development of critical illness myopathy [25, 55]. Corticosteroids may affect contractile function of striated muscles by inhibition of protein synthesis and activation of protein degradation pathways. Nevertheless, the effects of corticosteroids on the diaphragm are not entirely predictable and may vary according to the regimen of administration, the specific corticosteroid, muscle fiber type, and possibly species. Importantly, corticosteroid doses administered in animal studies are often much higher than doses employed in clinical practice [56]. The effects of corticosteroids on diaphragm in ICU patients are therefore complex, but it is likely that diaphragm weakness is more severe with higher doses and a longer duration of exposure. Accordingly, administration of corticosteroids should be carefully guided by judicious evaluation of expected benefits and harm. While neuromuscular blockers are used to adapt patients to the ventilator, they render the diaphragm inactive and may contribute to diaphragm disuse and consequent atrophy. A particular concern exists when neuromuscular blockers are administrated in conjunction with glucocorticoids [55]. In animal models, rocuronium (aminosteroidal non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker) exacerbates diaphragm weakness induced by controlled mechanical ventilation [57]. By contrast, cisatracurium (a non-steroidal benzyl isoquinoline non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker) does not exacerbate the effects of ventilation on diaphragm force [58]. Importantly, when used for a short period (48 h) at the early phase of ARDS, cisatracurium did not induce ICU-acquired limb muscle weakness and increased ventilator-free days [59].\n\nMechanical ventilation\n\nMechanical ventilation has been clearly identified as a contributor to diaphragm weakness. It can be associated with adverse effects on respiratory muscles through two potentially competing mechanisms (Fig. 3): (1) disuse atrophy secondary to diaphragm inactivity from excessive ventilatory support, (2) load-induced injury due to insufficient ventilatory support and (3) hypercapnia under controlled mechanical ventilation.\n\nDisuse atrophy\n\nJust a few hours of fully controlled mechanical ventilation leads to rapid-onset atrophy and decreased contractile force both in vitro and in vivo [60–63]. Conversely, partially assisted mechanical ventilation mitigates atrophy and diaphragm weakness [61, 64]. Findings from animal models are difficult to replicate in critically ill patients who are frequently exposed to many risk factors for diaphragm injury. The first evidence in humans came from a study in 1988 by Knisely et al. who reported diaphragm atrophy in a postmortem series of neonates requiring long-term ventilation [65]. Twenty years later, Levine et al. found histological evidence of diaphragm atrophy among 14 adult brain-dead organ donors after meeting brain death criteria for 18–69 h [28]. Importantly, pectoralis muscle was unaffected in these patients over the same period of inactivity, suggesting that the rapid atrophy is specific to the diaphragm [28]. Diaphragm muscle fiber dysfunction is not only due to loss of muscle mass in these patients: the reduction in myofibrillar contractility also arises from deranged cross-bridge formation [66]. Diaphragm biopsies obtained from a heterogeneous group of ICU patients demonstrated the development of muscle fibers atrophy, activation of proteolysis, enhanced number of inflammatory cells in the muscle, and development of muscle fiber weakness [66]. Interestingly, force-generating capacity of the muscle fibers was reduced even after correction for loss of contractile protein, demonstrating the development of contractile protein dysfunction [66]. Although studies in animals and brain-dead patients suggested an important role for mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in the development of diaphragm dysfunction during mechanical ventilation [28, 67], mitochondrial morphology and function appeared normal in the diaphragm of ICU patients [68]. In addition, markers for oxidative stress and antioxidant enzymes in the diaphragm were not different between ICU and control patients [68].\n\nTwo studies reported a progressive decline of diaphragm force in vivo with increasing duration of mechanical ventilation [4, 52]. In a series of 76 patients, Dres et al. found that although the duration of mechanical ventilation from intubation to weaning was associated with the occurrence of diaphragm dysfunction, this effect did not persist in a multivariable analysis incorporating other risk factors [5]. More than mechanical ventilation itself, it is the unloading of the diaphragm under mechanical ventilation which is the critical contributor of diaphragm weakness. While the precise mechanism underlying disuse atrophy is debated [69], the deleterious effects of diaphragm unloading are strongly supported by experimental [60, 61] and clinical [70] data demonstrating that diaphragm atrophy and weakness can be attenuated by maintaining some level of respiratory muscle loading during ventilation.\n\nAssuming that atrophy may be detected with ultrasound, Grosu et al. described a time-dependent decrease in diaphragm thickness in seven patients [71]. It was confirmed in larger cohorts [70, 72]. Goligher et al. reported a rapid decrease in diaphragm thickness in over 40% of mechanically ventilated patients [70]. Importantly, diaphragm atrophy occurred quickly and the largest magnitude in the change of diaphragm thickness was achieved by day 4. Moreover, the change in diaphragm thickness over time was related to the level of inspiratory effort [70]. Importantly, diaphragm thickness was relatively stable on days when diaphragm thickening fraction (a measure of inspiratory effort) was consistent with normal resting breathing [70].\n\nExcessive loading\n\nExcessive respiratory muscle loading can result in diaphragm injury, as demonstrated in both animal and human studies [73]. Tracheal banding (prolonged resistive loading) in hamsters resulted in ventilatory failure associated with diaphragm injury characterized by susceptibility of myofibrillar complexes to calpain-mediated degradation [74]. Diaphragm injury in this context is characterized by myofibrillar disarray and inflammatory infiltration [73]. Sepsis appears to sensitize the sarcolemma to stress-related injury (membrane hyperfragility) [44]. Load-induced diaphragm injury has also been demonstrated in humans, manifesting as a prolonged loss of force production after resistive loading [75] and sarcomere disruption on histology [76].\n\nEccentric contractions—where the muscle contracts as it is lengthened—may be particularly injurious [77]. Eccentric contractions may occur in the context of patient–ventilator dyssynchrony [77]. Contractile activity of the diaphragm during expiratory diaphragm lengthening was recently demonstrated in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure [78]. Whether eccentric contractions are sufficiently frequent and severe to cause diaphragm weakness in mechanically ventilated patients is unknown.\n\nThe concept of load-induced injury may explain recent findings showing increases in diaphragm thickness—possibly reflecting muscle inflammation and edema—in a subset of mechanically ventilated patients associated with high levels of inspiratory effort [70]. Insufficient or delayed unloading of the respiratory muscles in the context of acute respiratory failure may therefore contribute to diaphragm injury.\n\nHypercapnia under controlled ventilation"
