(Paris: Gallimard, 2006), 1:70\n\n[Lady Carbury] had taken to the writing of a novel ­because [her publisher] had told her that upon the w ­ hole novels did better than anything ­else. She would have written a volume of sermons on the same encouragement, and have gone about the work exactly ­after the same fashion. The length of the novel had been her first question. It must be in three volumes, and each volume must have three hundred pages. But what fewest number of words might be supposed sufficient to fill a page? The money offered was too trifling to allow of very liberal mea­ sure on her part. She had to live, and if pos­si­ble to write another novel,—­and, as she hoped, on better terms, when this should be finished. . . . ­Whether the work might have been better done she never asked herself. I do not think she prided herself much on the literary merit of the tale. But if she could bring the papers to praise it, if she could induce Mudie to circulate it, if she could manage that the air for a month should be so loaded with ‘The Wheel of Fortune’ as to make it necessary for the reading world to have read or to have said that it had read the book,—­then she would pride herself very much upon her work.

He c­ ontinues, “Narrative is, by a vertiginous trick, the repre­sen­ta­tion of the very contract on which it is based: in the example of ­these stories, narration becomes the (economic) theory of narration: . . . ​stories are told as a means of exchange, and this transaction becomes the subject of the story itself: narrative is at once product and the means of production, merchandise and commerce.”1 Narrative, Barthes suggests, is an economic commodity in an ­exchange which contains a rec­ord of its own transactional agency. ­Stories nowadays have indeed become big business, in a financial as well as a meta­phorical sense. We describe narrative in terms of business deals: we buy a story just as easily as we buy milk from the corner store. We sell a line, swap an anecdote, trade jokes. Publishers may set prices, but readers buy the stories; the pro­cess requires an exchange that implies at least temporary agreement on a value for literary output. Readers invest time in a text in the expectation of a return and call the pro­cess “taking an interest.” The act of buying the story turns the ­c redibility of the narrative into the creditworthiness of the author. And ­authors respond, by following fashions or by challenging them, in order to create markets for their own works, and in d ­ oing so they leave an imprint of the pro­cess in what they have written. Narrative is just as much an economic commodity as a creative act, and the issues Barthes raises are fundamental to any consideration of narrative as an economic activity.2\n\n2\n\nSelling the Story\n\nBarthes is, however, better at asking questions than answering them. How do we judge the “value” of texts? How can we relate economic to aesthetic value? What role does the reader, or the author’s perception of the reader, play in establishing value? And how can the text itself provide clues to its own economic activity? That is the subject of this book. I explore narrative as a self-­reflexive commentary on the conditions of its own production. I ask w ­ hether a detailed examination of the story (récit) itself can provide evidence of how an author conceived of its value, constructed its value, and manipulated its value. By focussing on the text itself as an economic instrument, I want to develop a pragmatic, rather than theoretical, approach to an underrecognised area of literary analy­sis, that of economic criticism.\n\nThe Role of Economic Criticism Discussing the economic context of artistic production has never been easy. The very notion of commercial influence on art has been repeatedly denied, treated as relevant only to populist output, pigeonholed as belonging to a par­tic­u­lar po­liti­cal viewpoint, or regarded simply as an offshoot of biography. Even t­ oday, our growing appreciation of the value of historical context still hesitates to include the economic dimension fully. Attempts over the past thirty years to develop “economic criticism” as a distinct point of view have largely found­ered through attempts to impose a theoretical framework or through perceived po­liti­cal bias. More recently, and more in some lit­er­a­tures than in ­others, ­there has been a revival of interest in the role of economics in literary criticism, not from any theoretical standpoint but as a practical reflection of the need to under­ stand how the commercialisation of artistic production affects the pro­cess of aesthetic creation itself. Economic criticism has been far more extensively developed as a critical tool in some disciplines than in ­others.3 In the field of En­glish lit­er­a­ture, analy­sis of the under­lying economics of the publishing industry, the growth of literacy, and the evolving tastes of the reading public began early with, for example, Richard Altick’s investigation of mass readership in nineteenth-­century E ­ ngland in The En­glish Common Reader, first published in 1957.4 This established the groundwork for a discussion of the role of economics in lit­er­a­ture that focussed, in part, on how novels represented external economic developments and sys-\n\nIntroduction: The Economics of Narrative 3\n\ntems of po­liti­cal economy and, in part, although to lesser extent, on how the repre­sen­ta­tion of economics affected the act of writing itself. An early and influential contribution to the latter debate was made by John Vernon’s 1984 Money and Fiction, which drew parallels between the failure of traditional stores of economic value, such as money, to deliver predictable value, and the failure of fiction to mimic real­ity.5 T ­ hese twin tracks have begun to converge, and ­there now exists a flourishing array of critical lit­er­a­ture, produced largely by scholars in the United Kingdom and the United States, on the repre­sen­ta­tion of external economic conditions in prose fiction, on the relationship between lit­er­a­ture and po­ liti­cal economic theory, and, increasingly but from a very narrow base, on my par­tic­u­lar area of focus, narrative as a commentary on the conditions of its own production. I return to all of ­these ­later. Studies in French lit­er­a­ture and economics have taken a rather dif­ fer­ent turn. The development of the publishing industry was documented at an early stage, in par­tic­u­lar by Claude Bellanger’s 1969 Histoire générale de la presse française6 and Roger Chartier and Henri-­Jean Martin’s four-­volume Histoire de l’édition française, published from 1982 to 1986.7 This early work revealed a rich seam of investigation on the economic, social, and cultural history of publishing which has almost developed into its own discipline. René Guise’s 1975 thesis established the importance of the roman-­feuilleton as an economic driver of the periodical in the 1830s;8 Jean-­Yves Mollier documented the histories of the key publishers of the nineteenth ­century;9 Françoise Parent-­Lardeur the role of the cabinets de lecture.10 Current work on journalism and its relationship to popu­ lar culture is being led by Dominique Kalifa, Philippe Régnier, Marie-­Eve Thérenty, and Alain Vaillant, most recently in a wide-­ranging and much-­needed survey entitled La Civilisation du journal.11 Guillaume Pinson has explored the growing interaction between the worlds of journalism and the novel throughout the nineteenth ­century.12 Judith Lyon-­Caen has investigated con­temporary reader reception as evidenced by readers’ letters.13 Christophe Charle has supplied complementary research into economic history and culture,14 while ­others, in par­t ic­u­lar Martin Lyons15 and Vaillant, have successfully compiled statistical databases and applied techniques of economic analy­sis to aspects of literary consumption.16 Most recently, Edmund Birch’s work on the two-­way interaction between the press and the novel has done much to dispel e­ arlier hierarchical assumptions that\n\n4\n\nSelling the Story\n\n“lit­er­a­ture” could remain unaffected by its increasing proximity to the commercial press.17 But in the area of lit­er­a­ture as a reflection of theories of po­liti­cal economy, French criticism has historically been heavi­ly influenced by a long tradition of Marxist analy­sis in French lit­er­a­ture, dating back at least to the influence of György Lukács, whose 1916 Die Theorie des Romans and series of articles on Honoré de Balzac in 1934–1935, translated into French as Balzac et le réalisme français in 1951, had proposed a method of showing how Balzac’s exuberant, totalising, and commercial perspective could be taken as a realistic portrayal of a society in the throes of cap­i­tal­ist disintegration, despite the author’s opposite personal convictions.18 This seems to have resonated with French aesthetic hierarchies, already established in literary criticism from the time of Charles Augustin Sainte-­Beuve and his excoriation of “industrial lit­er­a­ture” (la littérature industrielle), which rejected popu­lar art and lit­er­a­ture as an appropriate subject for academic study ­unless other­w ise redeemed by a po­l iti­cal justification.19 The Marxist focus is vis­i­ble in a wide range of so­c io­log­i­cal, critical, and economic perspectives, from Pierre Bourdieu’s concepts of cultural capital,20 to Pierre Barbéris’s notion of the text as the home of the proletariat,21 to Jean-­Joseph Goux’s proposition of counterfeit coin as the founding meta­phor for a debased society.22 Even more recent works, such as Alexandre Péraud’s 2012 Le Crédit dans la poétique balzacienne, which explores the relationship between financial debt and moral bankruptcy, acknowledge a debt to a long Marxist tradition.23 Although the influence of this viewpoint now seems to be on the wane, over time it has, I think, rather restricted the scope of French critical thinking and perhaps hindered the development of new approaches to economic criticism. In Rus­sian scholarship, even the basic tools for economic analy­sis are underdeveloped. It was not always thus: in fact, the ur-­texts appeared much e­ arlier than in many other Eu­ro­pean countries. Mikhail Kufaev’s 1927 History of the Book in Rus­sia in the 19th ­Century (Istoriya russkoi knigi v XIX veke)24 and Mikhail Muratov’s 1931 Publishing Trade in Rus­sia in the 19th and 20th Centuries (Knizhnoe delo v Rossii v XIX i XX vekakh)25 provide the foundation for analy­sis of the evolution of the readership and the role of changes in printing technology, distribution mechanisms, and economic inputs, but neither is as comprehensive as its equivalents in the En­glish or French market. For almost half a c­ entury, ­l ittle more was\n\nIntroduction: The Economics of Narrative 5\n\nadded ­until William Mills Todd III’s 1978 Lit­er­a­ture and Society in Imperial Rus­sia, 1800–1914, which began the pro­cess of filling some of the “serious lacunæ in the study of Rus­sian lit­er­a­ture as a social institution” identified by his analy­sis in its very first sentence.26 In part this is due to real evidential voids—­for example, in literacy statistics ­until the first census of 1897, or in central bibliographical rec­ords of publications (despite Rus­sia’s having more continuous censorship laws than anywhere ­else in Eu­rope). In part it reflects a genuine absence of original basic research into what is, or might be, available in terms of the publishing history, the readership, and the social culture of the nineteenth c­ entury. The relative absence of basic research has complicated efforts to develop a more sophisticated debate on economic and literary interactions. Nonetheless, advances have been made in understanding the readership and the culture of reading, most notably by Abram Reitblat 27 and Jeffrey Brooks.28 Todd has done the same for the role of serialisation in Rus­sian periodicals;29 Louise McReynolds for the development of the mass-­ circulation press;30 Deborah Martinsen for that of literary journals;31 Boris Mironov in the field of social history and so­c io­log­i­cal change;32 and Susanne Fusso for the role of that most influential of all Rus­sian publishers in the nineteenth ­century, Mikhail Katkov.33 But economic criticism as a separate branch of study has yet to become established. A seminal 1999 text, which I ­shall discuss l­ ater, entitled The New Economic Criticism: Studies at the Intersection of Lit­er­a­ture and Economics, edited by Martha Woodmansee and Mark Osteen,34 was indeed published in the Rus­sian journal Novoe literaturnoe obozrenie in 2002, along with contributions to the economic debate by Todd, Mikhail Makeev, Séamas O’Driscoll, Kirill Postoutenko, and Lev Usykin.35 Postoutenko also published other articles on the topic around the same time.36 But I can find ­l ittle more. Economic criticism is hardly a new phenomenon, even though it has only recently begun to be recognised as a separate branch of interdisciplinary study. It has always been difficult to define. When Woodmansee and Osteen launched their attempt to establish it as a distinct discipline, their introduction suggested a redefinition by reference to four separate “approaches to the economics of literary texts.” “Production” meant a focus on the “social, cultural and economic contexts in which . . . ​works have been produced”: a branch of New Historicism focussing mostly on the external conditions of production, though oddly they barely mention\n\n6\n\nSelling the Story\n\nthe publishing industry itself. “Internal circulation” argued that the repre­sen­ta­tion of money, finance, and transaction within a work can not only provide clues as to the author’s own hierarchy of value but can also mirror and critique external economic conditions both through content and through stylistic device. “External circulation and consumption” considered the economics of reception, the pro­cess of canonisation, and the impact of changing tastes, as well as the author’s “debt” to precursors from all pos­si­ble intertextualities. Lastly, “metatheoretical” provided a heading ­under which the methodology and theory of economic criticism could itself be discussed.37 In the intervening years, the increasing volume of works on and around the subject of economic criticism (particularly in En­glish lit­er­a­ ture), and parallel evolution in other aesthetic disciplines such as the fine arts and m ­ usic, has allowed revised definitions to emerge from ­actual practice. Mary Poovey, writing in 2008, presages a reformulation when she suggests three broad categories: “one that treats economic ­matters as ideas (or ‘thought’), logics, meta­phors or structural paradigms; one that focuses on the economic prob­lems of Literary production, and one that deals with the formal, generic, and commodity features that have allowed Literary writing to attain a degree of relative autonomy since the late eigh­teenth ­century.”38 In practical terms, what has actually happened is the emergence of a far greater degree of economic awareness across three largely preexisting approaches. The oldest of t­ hese is the “lit­er­a­ture as commerce” approach. In its earliest incarnations, this almost always takes a pejorative line, representing the threat posed to aesthetics by populism—­Paul Delany provides a good summary of the origins of this approach in Lit­er­a­ture, Money and the Market, from Plato’s preferment of ascetic Sparta over consumerist Athens to recent Marxist criticism.39 The influence of economics on narrative was implicitly admitted by its very rejection, as witness Rémy de Gourmont’s 1907 argument that serious art was essentially incomprehensible to the populace at large.40 More recently, Theodor Adorno’s reading of aestheticism and art-­for-­a rt’s-­sake discourses, in his posthumous Ästhetische Theorie, argues that, despite their claims to despise the commercial market, ­these remain wholly dependent on it.41 The original approach has long since given way to serious analy­sis of the business of publishing, and, at least in France and ­England, a solid database of information about the growth of publishing as an in-\n\nIntroduction: The Economics of Narrative 7\n\ndustry and about the evolution of the readership now exists. The one area in which all ­these analyses are still lacking is that of the availability and sources of capital to finance growth. We know from other industries, particularly transport, how vital an enabling tool this is; publishing is l­ ittle dif­fer­ent save in scale, and more information on this point would give us another mea­sure of value for literary production. The second strand of current economic analy­sis is the “lit­er­a­ture as economic critique” approach. This divided historically into two closely related subfields: “lit­er­a­ture as socioeconomic commentary,” which saw lit­er­a­ture, and in par­tic­u­lar realist and naturalist lit­er­a­ture, as a critique of the social and economic conditions of con­temporary society, and “lit­ er­a­ture as po­l iti­cal economics,” which saw lit­er­a­ture ­either through the prism of a po­liti­cal or economic interpretation imposed by the critic, as in much of Marxist criticism, or as a repre­sen­ta­tion of a con­temporary theory of po­l iti­cal economy. The early foundations of both w ­ ere laid by studies of the way in which realist writers depicted the society they lived in through the prism of fiction. Thus modern criticism of Balzac, for example, begins with extensive analyses showing how Balzac’s fictional repre­sen­ta­tion of the emergence of a commercialised and consumerist bourgeoisie corresponded to the historical and so­c io­log­i­cal evidence. Jean-­Hervé Donnard’s 1961 Balzac, les réalités économiques et sociales dans “La Comédie humaine” is, as its title suggests, a good example of this approach,42 but many of the ­earlier critical works, such as Bernard Guyon’s analy­sis of Balzac’s po­l iti­cal and social thinking,43 André Maurois’s biography,44 or Harry Levin’s survey of how realist writers write realism,45 tend t­ owards this perspective. At around the same time, economists and sociologists ­were examining literary repre­sen­ta­tions of society as evidence of public attitudes, as, for example, in Louis Chevalier’s Classes laborieuses et classes dangereuses à Paris pendant la première moitié du XIXe siècle (1958),46 which compares the available evidence about the lower classes from economic, so­c io­log­i­cal, and scientific observations against their repre­sen­ta­tion in con­temporary works of lit­er­a­ture, in par­ tic­u­lar by Balzac, Eugène Sue, and Victor Hugo, as well as against con­ temporary theorists of po­l iti­cal economy such as Henri de Saint-­Simon, Charles Fourier, and Pierre-­Joseph Prou­d hon. The same evidence was also repurposed by other critics to impose a reading from a po­liti­cal economic perspective. For de­cades the link between po­liti­cal economics and lit­er­a­ture had been close. Po­liti­cal\n\n8\n\nSelling the Story\n\neconomics had explained, and was explained by, literary creation: Lukács 47 and Walter Benjamin48 reinterpreted Balzac and Charles Baudelaire in the light of urban commodity capitalism, while Karl Marx used Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s Faust to articulate his theories on the power of money.49 The dangers of this approach ­were amply demonstrated by the ­wholesale imposition of Marxist theory in the Soviet Union between the early 1930s and the early 1980s, a move that severely ­limited the value of much Soviet criticism during this period. But new attitudes ­were also evolving. Regenia Gagnier’s Insatiability of ­Human Wants: Economics and Aesthetics in Market Society, published in 2000, traced the shift in nineteenth-­century po­liti­cal economic thinking from “notions of Economic Man as producer (Smith, Ricardo, Mill, and Marx) or reproducer (Malthus) to a view of Economic Man as consumer [(Jevons, Menger)].” She illustrated this with examples from con­temporary lit­ er­a­ture to show how artistic products both w ­ ere subject to and could represent this transition, and in d ­ oing so she provided an intellectual basis for considering reception theory as an economic force.50 It was now thinkable to enquire in more detail about how demand for aesthetic products could be produced and, more importantly, manipulated by their creator to be made even more desirable. At the same time, the field of lit­er­a­ture as economic critique was also undergoing radical change t­owards a final category of economic criticism that I call “lit­er­a­ture as economic self-­commentary.” To an extent, this dates back to the very emergence of the extended debate about realism as si­mul­ta­neously repre­sen­ta­tion and critique of the conditions of its own conception: the very form of realism is seen as a necessary condition of its ability both to represent the realities of nineteenth-­century industrial society and to attract readers to read that repre­sen­ta­tion. The inflection point at which economic critique becomes economic self-­ commentary is clearly shown in Christopher Prendergast’s Order of Mimesis, which treats narrative as an item in an economic exchange with readers in which readers have an expectation of a profitable return on both their time and their investment of trust in the narrative credentials. In his chapter on Balzac, Prendergast uses Balzac’s repre­sen­ta­tion of transaction and commerce as a way of asking what we can infer from this about the transaction between narrator and reader.51 At the same time, the scope of literary criticism and its ability to access economic tools also underwent a significant change. Terry Ea­gleton’s\n\nIntroduction: The Economics of Narrative 9\n\n1983 Literary Theory: An Introduction called into question all received attitudes to literary criticism and to lit­er­a­ture itself.52 Vernon’s comparison between prose fiction and categories of texts that ­were then only beginning to be considered as part of the literary system, such as banknotes,53 highlighted the benefits of a broader horizon, particularly when combined with the then recent reception theories of Wolfgang Iser54 and Hans Robert Jauss.55 Albeit slowly, this led to Poovey’s proposition that virtually all forms of writing, from banknotes to treatises on po­l iti­cal economy, should be treated as genres within a broad definition of narrative.56 In turn this has legitimised the application of literary criteria to financial narratives and that of economic criteria to aesthetic repre­sen­ta­tion. But this new form of interdisciplinary criticism needed more input from the economics side. Pioneers such as Marc Shell and Goux had become overfascinated by the correspondence between linguistic and economic systems, as Delany argues, and had failed to develop a broader model for bringing the literary and economics together.57 Catherine Gallagher, in The Body Economic: Life, Death, and Sensation in Po­liti­cal Economy and the Victorian Novel (2006), proposes a model which brings together an understanding of how the literary repre­sen­ta­tion of a po­liti­cal economy can influence the composition and style of the narrative itself. She uses the example of Charles Dickens’s Hard Times, which she argues is an attempt to represent and critique Benthamite po­liti­cal economy. The attempt, she contends, is reflected in the style of the work itself. “The prose d ­ oesn’t just mime the monotony of the environment but announces that the novel is both product and produce of the severe workfulness it seems to criticize. Hard Times relentlessly belabors its effortful prose and its unhappy (in both senses of the word) allegories. Workfulness is not just an attribute of ­people of this novel, it is a mode of repre­sen­ta­tion and an ­a ngle of vision on the world in general.”58 This is perhaps the closest example I have found to an illustration of my perspective, in that it shows clearly how the act of composition could be influenced by an economic objective. In this case, as she argues it, it is the repre­sen­ta­tion, in fiction, of an economic theory rather than the variation of the perceived value of the text by the reader that is being achieved, but the princi­ple is the same. Literary historians have also started to make similar use of stylistic analy­sis. Franco Moretti’s The Bourgeois: Between History and Lit­er­a­ture\n\n10\n\nSelling the Story\n\n(2013) argues that the rise of the bourgeois in nineteenth-­century Eu­ rope is reflected in the evolution of literary devices. Changing patterns of adjective use, for example, reflect a shift from the descriptive purposes of eighteenth-­century prose to the “incrustation of value judgements over ­matters of fact” that, Moretti argues, characterise Victorian fiction. The new technique of “filler” narratives around the main plot offers “the kind of narrative plea­sure compatible with the new regularity of bourgeois life” (Moretti’s emphasis). The implication is that the act of composition itself is influenced, ­whether consciously or not, by external economic and social ­factors.59 Even so, both Gallagher and Moretti miss a point. As the tone of Gallagher’s analy­sis makes clear, she evidently thinks that the resulting stylistic changes have not improved the book’s readability—in other words, its value to the reader. Many subsequent critics have agreed with her. Yet at the time of its publication in 1854, Hard Times succeeded in doubling the circulation of House­hold Words. John Ruskin thought it one of Dickens’s finest.60 What does this tell us about the literary and stylistic devices that made it attractive or valuable to the con­temporary reader? Is t­here evidence to suggest Dickens was aware of what some now see as the novel’s shortcomings and, if so, are countermea­sures vis­ i­ble in subsequent works? Gallagher’s approach concentrates on the po­ liti­cal economy a­ ngle and successfully demonstrates the interrelationship between theory and narrative structure, just as Moretti’s links social to stylistic evolution, but both omit the additional ­a ngle that an appreciation of lit­er­a­ture as commerce might have brought. My own approach, and the one I want to explore in this book, is to treat the text as something that its author is, typically, trying to “sell” to the reader, in both a strictly economic and a meta­phorical sense—­the title of the book, Selling the Story, encapsulates this very duality. The text itself ­w ill show the evidence of this activity both in the author’s choice of subject and in his or her choice of style, genre, or literary device. This is what I mean when I say that e­ very narrative is, in some part, a self-­ reflexive commentary on the conditions of its own production. I suspect this may be true of all narratives, whenever produced, but my focus ­here is on the nineteenth-­century “professional turn,” the point at which the writing of prose fiction became a commerce and writers ­were able to make a living, of sorts, from the business of selling narratives. An author’s output encountered a commercial market where consumers, often through power­ful publishing intermediaries, defined the par­\n\nIntroduction: The Economics of Narrative 11\n\nameters of value and influenced, at times even dictated, the terms of trade. It is only to be expected that what is produced w ­ ill reflect an awareness of what sells. Even the asserted absence of a commercial objective is itself a form of commentary. Understanding the market into which an artistic product is launched thus becomes part of understanding the work itself. How creators define the value of their products—­and ­there are many yardsticks of value, from economic, to critical, to posterity-driven—is related to the reception of ­those products in target markets. Understanding market context, in terms of both con­temporary conditions and emerging trends, can alert a modern critic to authorial strategies used to modify the value of an artistic production. Such strategies, particularly if commercial and related to canonical works, are rarely recognised in current critical discourse. Exposing them can reveal a hitherto underevaluated and underappreciated awareness of, and responsiveness to, economic influences. This, then, is the starting point for my investigation. The pro­cess ­relies on three rather basic analytical steps, which I ­w ill discuss in more detail ­later. ­These can be summarised as follows. Understanding the context—­economic and cultural, but most specifically the publishing context—of a given work provides the tools to detect the pressures of artistic production at work on the author. An awareness of ­t hese pressures helps to recognise pos­si­ble authorial responses in the text. Unbundling the role of transaction in narrative is the next step. At an obvious level, nineteenth-­century novels frequently use transactions—­ monetary, l­egal, psychological—as essential ele­ments of plot. B ­ ehind this, though, the narrative itself can be viewed as the object of a real transaction between author and reader in which the reader trades time against the anticipation of textual gratification. An awareness of both roles for transaction allows the reader to ask all sorts of rather down-­to-­ earth questions more normally associated with commerce than with creativity: “What am I being sold? Why should I buy it? How much? How do the in-­story characters value the very same narrative? If they buy the story, should I?” Analysing narrative as transaction helps to isolate the economic effects of literary devices more normally approached in aesthetic terms. Fi­nally, the two prior steps lead directly to a discussion of the constituents of literary value. ­Here I am less interested in the subjective reader response than in gathering evidence from the text itself of how the\n\n12\n\nSelling the Story\n\nauthor tried to mediate or manipulate the value of the narrative to the reader, and thence attempting to deduce how the author might have conceptualised literary value. The result is a rather practical approach to literary value that I call the point of sale perspective, which focusses on mining the text for what it reveals about the author’s understanding of transaction and anticipated reader response at the point of composition. It prompts a series of questions about what tools authors have to mediate value, where the tools came from, w ­ hether ­there is textual evidence of their use, how effective they have been, and how effectiveness is itself to be judged. In isolation, none of ­these steps is particularly original. Woodmansee and Osteen’s suggested approach in The New Economic Criticism contains all of t­ hese ele­ments.61 What is dif­fer­ent is my focus on the synchronic viewpoint of the author at the point of sale, to the extent demonstrable from con­temporary evidence including the text itself, as a way of examining how economic considerations might have influenced the composition of the same text. The role of the economic critic is to identify ­these economic d ­ rivers (or, indeed, their absence) and to link them to textual structures such as genre, subject, or literary device, which can be shown on the basis of con­temporary evidence to influence reception. It is not, in my view, necessary to demonstrate authorial intention or awareness in this pro­cess, although in many cases evidence of an all too acute consciousness of the author’s economic standing is clear. Fedor Dostoevsky and Balzac, for example, are famously and vocally indigent, while Gustave Flaubert and the ­later Dickens are just as demonstrably aware of their financial in­de­pen­dence. The implication, though, is that ­because no writer exists in­de­pen­dently of his or her economic context, their works ­w ill also be in some mea­sure a self-­reflexive response to that context. Texts can reveal conscious authorial strategies to address economic issues of reach and reception, while reception, both immediate and through posterity, can reveal economic effects that may have been far from conscious at the point of sale. More, the act of writing itself compels e­ very author to become, in effect, a character in his or her own novels responsible for mediating reader reception. Economic criticism is an effective way of identifying and analysing this phenomenon. To an extent, this dif­fer­ent viewpoint affects every­t hing ­else: the focus of my perspective on transaction, for example, is on the vari­ous negotiating strategies an author can adopt depending on his or her per-\n\nIntroduction: The Economics of Narrative 13\n\nception of how readers assess literary value. It is impor­tant to emphasise, though, that this is not a work of critical theory and it makes no claims to stand as such. My economic perspective is just that, a dif­fer­ent point of view informed by experience of another discipline that can, I think, provide a new approach even to major canonical texts that have been exhaustively analysed within existing critical frameworks. It is, emphatically, not exclusive: economic criticism complements aesthetic approaches and seeks to add rather than to supplant. Since it is essentially a pragmatic approach, it is best illustrated by demonstration of its application. For reasons discussed more fully ­later, I have chosen three authors from across the nineteenth c­ entury and from across widely separated geographies and cultures, each represented by canonical works already familiar to critical attention: Balzac’s Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes, Dostoevsky’s ­Brothers Karamazov, and Emile Zola’s L’Argent. But first, a better understanding of my three analytical steps is perhaps required.\n\nThe Importance of the Publishing Context Changes in the wider economic and cultural contexts can have far-­ reaching effects once translated to the publishing environment. One of the themes I s­ hall follow is the divergent evolution of the book as a publishing format in dif­fer­ent countries. My chapters on Balzac, Dostoevsky, and Zola ­w ill examine this in greater detail, but a general overview ­w ill provide a summary of the overall publishing context. In E ­ ngland the early phases of the Industrial Revolution had created a literate m ­ iddle class with enough spare time and money to buy and read the works of Samuel Richardson, Jane Austen, and Walter Scott, as well as an economy with enough access to capital to invest in printing technology and distribution. Demand for all forms of printed ­matter grew as literacy, education, and new publishing technologies expanded the market. Railways arrived to reach new readerships at ever-­growing speed. This thriving market could support multiple publishing formats, from newspapers to periodicals to stand-­a lone books, most notably the nine-­hundred-­page, forty-­five-­c hapter, three-­volume “triple-­deckers” required by Mudie’s and bemoaned by Lady Carbury in my introductory quotation from Anthony Trollope’s Way We Live Now. Indeed, triple-­ deckers remained an impor­ tant publishing format throughout the\n\n14\n\nSelling the Story\n\nc­ entury ­until the mid-1890s despite competition from serialised novels, cheap “yellowback” reprints, and eventually cut-­price book-­format editions of original works. Other formats ­were able to coexist and grow alongside the book, including periodical miscellanies such as Blackwood’s Magazine, more literary weeklies such as Dickens’s House­hold Words, and the mass-­market newspapers such as the Daily Mail introduced by the Harmsworth f­amily in the 1890s. Authors had access to, or at least direct experience of, multiple and evolving formats, and the most successful, like Dickens, could even dictate their own choice of format.62 By contrast, authors in nineteenth-­century France ­were confronted by a rather dif­fer­ent publishing environment. In comparison to E ­ ngland’s economy, that of France started the c­ entury in a less developed state and continued to grow more slowly. Both population and productivity growth ­were weak; industrialisation and urbanisation took longer to happen; education and literacy followed suit. The publishing industry found itself in a vicious circle of high costs, low productivity, intrusive censorship, piracy, and slow growth in the readership, which led to widespread failures and a government bail-­out of Pa­ri­sian printer-­ publishers in 1830. When, in 1836, the first lower-­priced periodicals appeared on the market, the industry found itself in no state to support competing formats. For the next half c­ entury, the book format would remain subservient to the dominance of the periodicals and the newspapers. Not that the book dis­appeared as a format; rather, the readership penetration achieved by the roman-­feuilleton at the foot of the first page of a popu­lar periodical or newspaper was so much higher than that of a stand-­alone book, unsupported by the shop win­dow of the periodical, that it became far less profitable for authors and publishers to choose the book format ­unless in­de­pen­dently wealthy. Not u ­ ntil the late 1870s would technological advances and the development of a mass readership change the equation and allow the book format to return as the leading marketplace for new, original prose fiction. The virtual requirement, during the entire ­m iddle of the ­century, to publish in a journalistic medium, in serialised format, in physical proximity to the news and scandal of the day that sold newspapers, in return for payment by the line or column, is of inescapable importance in understanding French authors of the period, even ­t hose who, like Flaubert, could afford to buy their way f­ ree of the system.63\n\nIntroduction: The Economics of Narrative 15\n\nThe Rus­sian market was, as usual, idiosyncratic. Its size, geography, and economic backwardness created vast barriers to the development of a mass readership. It had developed its own hybrid publishing format, the “thick journal,” a monthly periodical often of several hundred pages in bound hardback-­book format, containing entire chapters of novels alongside essays on subjects from science to farming, which reached readerships of rarely more than a few thousand. Since the days of Peter the ­Great, much of its aristocracy, thus a substantial proportion of the potential book market, had looked to the West for imported taste, manners, and technology. The link with France was particularly close, though it remained very much a one-­way street from France into Rus­sia ­until late in the ­century. Publishers appropriated the latest developments in the French publishing market and applied them to a Rus­sian market which lagged far ­behind in the development of its readership. Authors throughout the ­century found themselves addressing a readership a fraction the size of that in France which their publishers w ­ ere attempting to develop using tools designed for a wholly dif­fer­ent market. Nonetheless, the French market had demonstrated the potential of a mass market yet to come. So which market should an author address? I think it is difficult to understand an impor­tant aspect of nineteenth-­century Rus­ sian lit­er­a­ture without an appreciation of this point.64 Writers themselves document the translation of general economic trends into specific publishing strategies or pressures. Wilkie Collins, writing in House­hold Words in 1858, rec­ords his surprise at discovering “a reading public of three millions which lies right out of the pale of literary civilisation,” evidenced by the proliferation of penny journals as urban population growth and literacy begin to explode.65 The relentless domination of the French press by the periodical and newspaper sector is chronicled and satirised by, among many o ­ thers, Balzac in Illusions perdues (1837–1843), the Goncourt b ­ rothers in Charles Demailly (1868), and Guy de Maupassant in Bel-­Ami (1885). Zola fi­nally, and virtually singlehandedly, overcomes the power of the periodical, reestablishes the book as a profitable economic entity in its own right, and documents the pro­cess, as I s­ hall argue, in L’Argent. The publishing context acts as filter and focus, bringing the implications of wider economic and cultural changes for the business of producing lit­er­a­ture into sharper relief.\n\n16\n\nSelling the Story\n\nLit­er­a­ture as Transaction The notion of transaction implies a pro­cess, an act, and an account of both.66 The pro­cess involves a negotiation through time to discover value and the levers that affect value, to compare the values of dif­fer­ent commodities in an iterative pro­cess which may involve modifications and repeated reassessments, and fi­nally to reach a point of compromise at which the parties to the transaction agree on an equivalence of value between two dif­fer­ent commodities. The act involves the completion of an exchange between two or more parties or, alternatively, the completion of a performative pro­cess that results in a transfer of value even without a counterparty, as, for example, through a ­legal pro­cess, as in a ­w ill or a dowry, or through coercion, as in theft or extortion. Both cause a discontinuity, a sudden and radical change of state occasioned by, for example, a signature on a contract. Fi­nally, transaction can be seen as an account, a narrative of itself, as in the transactions of a learned society; not merely the act but the story of the act as well. Since Barthes we have become used to thinking of narrative as a commodity and of the récit as a contract between author and reader that can credibly be described as an a­ ctual transaction. The author offers a narrative in exchange for the reader’s attention, often mediated by a publisher who establishes a monetary equivalent for the initial value of the narrative. The author’s perception of value may extend beyond the reception of an immediate readership ­towards pos­si­ble ­f uture readers and a concept of f­uture value. The text becomes a commodity capable of establishing a form of exchange rate between the Marxist value of the author’s ­labour, Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s concept of the absolute or perpetual value of art, and the Jevonian marginal utility value of the work’s reception over time. Georg Simmel discusses w ­ hether relationships based on a transfer of intellectual property can qualify as genuine exchanges in The Philosophy of Money. He establishes two criteria for defining what is, and what is not, exchange. Each party, he says, must offer to the other more than he or she possessed before; and each party must sacrifice a good in order to obtain the commodity he or she wants. The author-­reader exchange satisfies both conditions: each reader, pre­sent and ­future, offers “reach”—­a larger audience and the possibility of eventual canonisation—­a nd, indirectly via the publisher, a financial return to the author, who has sacrificed time to create the narrative as the com-\n\nIntroduction: The Economics of Narrative 17\n\nmodity of exchange. The author offers to the reader the prospect of enjoyment or education to be derived from the narrative: the reader sacrifices time and attention to achieve ­these objectives. In Simmel’s terms, it seems clear that the author-­reader exchange would qualify as a genuine transaction.67 It seems justifiable, therefore, to think of lit­er­a­ture as a form of transaction. In part this simply reflects real­ity; in part the discipline of allocating an economic category to a creative pro­cess provides a useful tool for unbundling the economic agency of individual parts of that pro­cess. It also provides an alternative lexicon for describing narration and narrative types that is sufficiently unfamiliar as to force us to reappraise previous commonplaces. It also allows us to apply some of the same techniques to a literary text as would be applied to the analy­sis of a transaction, by seeking to establish how the reader assigns value to the text, what methods the author uses to mediate that value, and ­whether the value of the story as perceived by its characters is the same as that adjudged by its readers. It seems particularly appropriate to apply ­t hese techniques to the prose fiction of the nineteenth ­century in the light of the commercial revolution, which tracked its industrial counterpart across Eu­rope at varying speeds over the course of the ­century. In France the sale of state-­ owned assets (biens nationaux) in 1789 and 1792 was prob­ably the single largest series of connected transactions of that or the following ­century. Robert Gildea argues that the opportunity this created may have been the catalyst for the rise of the commercial bourgeoisie in France.68 In Rus­sia the pro­cess of commercialisation began far ­later: arguably, the negotiation of land reform that followed the 1861 emancipation of the serfs fulfilled a similar function to that of the sale of the French biens nationaux in making transaction an issue of national rather than merely individual significance. The development of lit­er­a­ture from an aristocratic hobby into a profession required authors to transact with publishers. The “industrialisation” of lit­er­a­ture through its assimilation for extended periods of time by the newspaper or periodical industry required many authors to become part-­time journalists, aware quite literally of the value of their product per column inch. An author’s personal experience of transaction was likely to become more frequent, more intensive, and more intrusive as the ­century progressed. It seems plausible that this should be reflected in lit­er­a­ture, particularly in the\n\n18\n\nSelling the Story\n\nprose narratives of novelists claiming in many dif­fer­ent ways to offer a realistic portrayal of the money-­obsessed, speculative, and deal-­d riven world in which they found themselves. Considering narrative as a form of transaction also has the advantage of recognising the importance of the recipient of the narrative as an equal and necessary partner in the exchange. Lee Erickson, in The Economy of Literary Form, describes the pro­cess in terms that many economists would find familiar: “Since readers read within a framework of desire, the economy of literary forms can be described from the perspective of reception as well as that of production. In this way, literary forms can be viewed as historical, aesthetic products of market forces reaching a momentary equilibrium between the aspirations of writers and the desires of their audiences.”69 Erickson’s perspective is essentially diachronic, and he sees reception as a pro­cess that follows on from the publication of a literary text by means of criticism, appraisal, or approval: a transaction only revealed as such by the distance of history. My more synchronic approach looks at the “point of sale” itself (a definition to which I s­ hall return) and asks three questions: How does the author represent transaction within the story? How do the in-­story characters construct the narratives they tell to o ­ thers? What techniques do they use to modify its value and what effect do they have on the credibility of the narrative in the eyes of the recipient? How are the pro­cesses of negotiation and completion represented? Understanding how the author conceives of and portrays the pro­cess of transaction gives us a yardstick with which to judge how he or she might approach the broader transaction of selling the narrative to the reader. What clues does the story afford about how the author approaches the transaction with the reader? What techniques does the author use to make the narrative more attractive or valuable to the recipient? Has the author introduced dissonances or gaps between the way the characters perceive the value of a narrative and the way the reader perceives it, and what can this tell us about how narrative value is created and manipulated? Is ­there evidence within the text of the inclusion of devices that demonstrably created narrative value in related publishing formats (most obviously the periodical or newspapers within which the texts ­were usually published and where the link between narrative value and increased subscription or copy sales could be demonstrated with some accuracy)? How has the author reacted to external f­ actors—­censorship,\n\nIntroduction: The Economics of Narrative 19\n\nediting, the pro­cess of serialisation? Building a comprehensive picture of the tools used by an author to mediate narrative value is the practical aim of this part of the analytical pro­cess. How does narrative value change with time? Within the author’s creative lifetime, what evidence can be deduced from the alterations in the tools used by a novelist to create value? In par­tic­u­lar, is ­there evidence of a cycle of feedback from readers, publishers, critics, or other market forces within the publishing market? Many writers, including all three in this study, leave evidence of such exchanges in correspondence or diaries. Serialised works or works written over an extended period provide particularly compelling evidence of shifts within an established value hierarchy. Anticipated changes in the composition of the readership can also cause shifts or conflicts within systems of narrative value: what pleases one generation w ­ ill not necessarily please the next. Over longer periods, changing tastes alter perceptions of literary value, allowing the formation of a literary canon and creating a notion, to which I s­ hall return, of “posterity” or “perpetuity” value. At this point the synchronic and diachronic axes fuse temporarily, in that authors can and do “write for posterity”—­a llowing their views about the eventual reception of their works by posterity to act as a direct influence on current output. Of course, not all authors, or even critics, would agree with the proposition that literary value is created through a pro­cess of transaction. William Words­worth, for example, evidently thought that the artist could prescribe his or her own literary worth and said so emphatically in the extended preface to his Lyrical Ballads of 1815: “­Every author, as far as he is ­great and at the same time original, has had the task of creating the taste by which he is to be enjoyed.”70 But t­here are dif­fer­ent types of transaction which can take account of differing perceptions of value creation, and this is perhaps the moment to introduce three categories that I w ­ ill ­later use extensively in my examination of all three of the authors I ­shall discuss. The approach I explore categorises texts according to their mode of economic agency. Most nineteenth-­century prose fiction can, I believe, be usefully considered within a framework that describes its economic functions in relation to three fundamental methods of “value discovery”: prospectus, auction, and speculation. The categories are intended only to serve as a grille de lecture, one further perspective among many o ­ thers\n\n20\n\nSelling the Story\n\nthat may usefully clarify one par­tic­u­lar aspect of the text. They are not proposed as a theoretical approach to e­ ither novelistic construction or reception. Prospectus The prospectus approach reveals value through assertion by author, narrator, or character, just as a prospectus typically advertises goods in relation to a value fixed by the offeror. The recipient or buyer’s task is simply to decide ­whether to buy the offered commodity at the price stated; the opportunity to bargain or to assert a revised view of price is ­either absent or ­l imited within a range defined by the seller. All didactic and most sacred texts would typically belong to this category, as would any form of rhe­toric that seeks to persuade, from ­legal argument to business opportunity. The category thus incorporates extremes, from credo to credit, and provides a useful tool for testing the economic agency of concepts not generally considered in an economic framework. At one end of the scale, for example, it would include Mikhail Bakhtin’s definition of “authoritative discourse” as assertion outside the dialogic pro­cess. Bakhtin neither relates this to economic function nor perceives it as part of a continuum with other forms of utterance, but the ability to classify religious texts as a form of prospectus ­w ill lead to a new perspective when we come to Dostoevsky.71 At the other extreme, prospectus, ­because of its ability—­indeed, propensity— to lie, is far closer to fiction that is generally assumed, as Poovey points out in Genres of the Credit Economy, which, in a sense, licensed an expansion of the notion of genre to include “financial writings” such as prospectus.72 The prospectus of the nineteenth ­century differed radically from our modern notion of a formal ­legal document. Its antecedents would have linked it to fraud and speculation in the shape of eighteenth-­century stock exchange crashes such as the South Sea ­Bubble of 1711 or John Law’s 1720 Mississippi Com­pany failure, which had led to a general financial crash in the French market. The demand for huge volumes of capital to finance the investments of the Industrial Revolution across Eu­ rope in the nineteenth ­century led to a proliferation of share and debt issues, all sold by prospectus. Even new literary works w ­ ere advertised by prospectus, as we s­ hall see in the case of Balzac’s La Comédie humaine. Many literary journals ­were themselves sold by prospectus and subscrip-\n\nIntroduction: The Economics of Narrative 21\n\ntion. In essence, the prospectus was a story about a story, a narrative asserting value that its readers w ­ ere expected to evaluate and decide ­whether they bought the story. It was associated with hyperbole and sensation, genres that also characterised the popu­lar press for much of the ­century. Con­temporary readers, I think, must have been well aware of the prospectus’s ability to proj­ect false as well as genuine value and of their own role as arbiters. Auction The auction approach is, in many ways, the opposite. It recognises that in many circumstances authors have no way of knowing the value of their work other than through reader reception. The author thus offers his or her narrative via a pro­cess of value discovery, akin to an auction, which allows readers to establish the value of the narrative in competition amongst themselves. Goux argues in Frivolité de la valeur that the shift from fixed values to market-­driven prices determined by t­ hose who had previously been the price-­takers is an intrinsic f­actor in the emergence of the realist novel in nineteenth-­century France, represented both in its pages and by its existence. “­Every activity, ­every thought, ­every product of the intelligence or the imagination is dragged into a market, a stock exchange, where in [Marie-­Esprit-­Léon] Walras’s model its value, which has no other basis than its exchange rate from moment to moment, is determined by ‘open outcry.’ ”73 In France, at least, auctions would have been a thoroughly familiar method of sale, since the sale of the biens nationaux following the revolution had been conducted using this technique, with reduced lot sizes to ensure maximum reach amongst the population. Even in a literary context, value is established as much by financial results as by critical response, in the shape of increased copy or subscription sales, translated into cash by the intermediation of the publisher. Much of nineteenth-­ century prose fiction is affected, not least ­because narratives published in a journalistic context—­most serialised novels of the ­century, for example—­become auction texts by default through their participation in the sales strategy of the publication. Speculation Fi­nally, the speculative approach recognises that neither author nor reader may be able to assign value to a given narrative on anything but\n\n22\n\nSelling the Story\n\na transient basis and that values may fluctuate significantly at each repetition as the narrative travels through time. It relies on iteration, ­either in the hope that multiple valuations are, over time, more representative than any methodology relying on a single point or simply in recognition of the inevitability of value change over time. Again, it is a motif drawn from a­ ctual experience: con­temporary accounts reveal, rather surprisingly, that by the 1870s Paris had become the most speculative bourse in Eu­rope, its longer settlement periods, more favourable options terms, and high liquidity giving it a decisive edge over the more staid London market.74 The gaming resorts of Eu­rope, from Bad Hombach to Monte Carlo, where the first casino opened in 1856 (­a fter, of course, raising money by prospectus), w ­ ere well known to travellers from as far afield as Rus­sia and feature in correspondence from Dostoevsky and Ivan Turgenev among ­others. Speculation has close links to narrative value. Thomas M. Kavanagh, tracing the history of speculation in France, quotes evidence that roulette players invent systems to beat the wheel despite knowing that none exists and that, by definition, their solutions are pure fictions that have value only to their authors.75 The narrator of the Arabian Nights is clearly aware that narrative has variable value and that iteration of similar narratives can change the cumulative perception of their worth, but has no real guide as to the impact of each individual narrative iteration on overall value. Over the c­ entury, the figure of the gambler, epitomised in tales such as Dostoevsky’s Gambler (Igrok, 1867) and Paul Bourget’s Autre joueur (1884), shows how narrative outcomes, just as much as the player’s wallet, can fluctuate with each roll of the dice. The distinction between prospectus, auction, and speculative narrative seeks to identify, from the evidence of the text itself, how authors perceive their own ability to value their output. The framework proposed is comprehensive, in that all transactions other than gifts must fit at least one of the three types.76 It differs from approaches that rely on subsequent reader reactions to texts, in that it focusses on evidence about the author’s behaviour and state of knowledge at the point of composition. It is behaviourally credible, in that it corresponds with most p ­ eople’s personal experience of transaction and with established distinctions between transaction formats. Fi­nally, it is particularly relevant to the nineteenth ­century, in that t­ here is ample con­temporary evidence of the existence of each transaction type in both commercial and lit-\n\nIntroduction: The Economics of Narrative 23\n\nerary sources, from prospectuses for railway shares to Dostoevsky’s Roulettenburg.\n\nThe Notion of Literary Value If lit­er­a­ture is to be seen as a form of transaction, then we w ­ ill need a practical method for understanding what we mean when we talk about literary “value.” For all the difficulty of definition, a closer understanding of the concept is essential to bridge the difficult gap between economic value and aesthetic worth. The idea of text as a repository for the transmission of value is one that takes root in the growth of literacy which characterised the nineteenth ­century across much of Eu­rope, represented axiomatically by paper money, which exchanges value into the narrative of value. The French Revolution brought with it a revolutionary currency in the shape of assignats, a paper currency issued by the Assemblée nationale from 1789 to 1796 backed by the security of the property expropriated from the Catholic Church. Doubts over both legality and liquidity soon led to the assignats trading at substantial and growing discounts to their face value. The prospectus, or assertion of value, on the face of the notes was routinely reassessed and translated into a fluctuating valuation that formed the basis for exchange transactions. A similar experience occurred in Rus­sia, where the paper rouble, the assignatsiya, had collapsed in 1817. Jillian Cooper, in Economies of Feeling, argues persuasively that the continuing changeability of the value and form of paper money in Rus­sia during Dostoevsky’s lifetime finds aesthetic expression in his repre­sen­ta­tion of the fantastic.77 In E ­ ngland the gold standard had temporarily been abandoned during the Napoleonic Wars for almost twenty-­ five years, from 1797 to 1819. The previously gold-­backed currency had been replaced by competing paper “fiat” currencies issued by both the Bank of ­England and a variety of local banks.78 Users had to act, in effect, as literary critics, comparing the value of one story of solidity and respectability with another to establish methods of differentiating value. Banks, meanwhile, discovered that by enhancing the credibility of the paper they circulated, they could also boost their creditworthiness. The motto of the London Stock Exchange, “My word is my bond” (Dictum meum pactum), perhaps the ultimate assertion of the equivalence of credibility and credit, dates from 1801.\n\n24\n\nSelling the Story\n\nIt did not take long for the association of text and economic value to become established in more formally literary texts. Thomas Bridges, writing in 1770–1771, casts a twenty-­pound note as the hero of his Adventures of a Bank-­Note, implying that this symbol of value could also function as a focus of narrative interest and cannily taking advantage of a popu­lar fad for “object narratives” to enhance the value of his own.79 Goethe, perhaps with tongue rather in cheek, represents the economic agency of inscription as Mephistophelean alchemy in the second part of Faust (published 1832): To whom it may concern, this note is worth a thousand crowns. It is secured by a specific pledge over untallied buried trea­sure in the Emperor’s lands. Now let it be provided that this rich trea­sure, once lifted from the ground, ­shall serve as quittance.80\n\nThe dev­i lry may lie rather in the implied equation between narrative as financial value, as offered to and accepted by the in-­story characters, and the same narrative as literary trea­sure offered to Goethe’s readers. By the time of Trollope’s Melmotte in The Way We Live Now (1875), dev­ilry had become sleaze, and the story’s ability to carry economic value had sloughed off any last reliance on Goethe’s under­lying security, vergrabnes Gut, as his narrator acerbically observes: “As for many years past we have exchanged paper instead of ­actual money for our commodities, so now it seemed that, u ­ nder the new Melmotte regime, 81 an exchange of words was to suffice.” The role of narrative as a carrier of value had been so well established that it could even be parodied: an article by Dickens’s subeditor, W. H. ­Wills, in House­hold Words entitled disingenuously “Review of a Popu­lar Publication: In the Searching Style” turns out to be a critique of a Bank of ­England banknote as a work of lit­er­a­ture: “Few can rise from a critical examination of the literary contents of this narrow sheet, without being forcibly struck with the power, combined with the exquisiteness of the writing. It strikes conviction at once. It dispels all doubts, and relieves all objections. ­There is a pithy terseness in the construction of the sentences; a downright, direct, straight-­forward, coming to the point, which would be widely imitated in much of the contemporaneous lit­er­a­ture that constantly obtains currency (though not as much).”82 The professionalisation of the business of writing and the rise of journalism throughout the ­m iddle of the ­century and more or less across\n\nIntroduction: The Economics of Narrative 25\n\nEu­rope offer another way of attaching financial value to literary production. Balzac, writing to Eveline Hanska in 1836, is so explicit about the equivalence as to be worth an extended quotation: Over a 15-­day period I sold 50 columns to the Chronique for a thousand francs, one hundred and twenty columns to La Presse for eight thousand francs, 20 columns to a Revue musicale for a thousand francs, an article to the Dictionnaire de la conversation for a thousand francs, which makes eleven thousand francs in a fortnight. I worked 30 nights without ­going to bed, and I completed La Perle brisée (for the Chronique, out already), and La Vieille Fille (for La Presse, out tomorrow). I did Le Secret des Ruggieri for Werdet. In a c­ ouple of weeks the last two volumes of Etudes de Moeurs ­w ill be published, then I’m quits. I sold my third dizain for two thousand francs (so that makes 13,000fr.) Then I’m g­ oing to do La Torpille and La Femme supérieure for La Presse, and Les Souffrances de l’Inventeur for the Chronique. At the same time I’m in the pro­cess of selling, for 18,000 francs, the reprint rights to La Torpille and La Femme supérieure, together with Un ­grand homme de province [à Paris] and Les Héritiers Boirouge, both begun, which makes a total of thirty-­one thousand francs. Then, since I ­don’t have to rely on that rotten plank of a Werdet any more, I’m g­ oing to do a deal with a rich, solid publishing h ­ ouse for the 14 remaining volumes of Etudes de mœurs, volumes 12 to 26, which should be worth up to 56 ­thousand francs for the author’s rights, out of which I’d want 30,000 up front. If that all comes off, I’d have raised 63 thousand francs through the last two deals, which I’m ­going to put my back into, and that would save me from every­thing. Not only would I be f­ree of debt but I’d even have some money over. But I’ll need to work day and night for six months and then at least 10 hours a day for two years.83\n\nAs a love letter this may lack finesse, but it shows convincingly how conversant Balzac was with the details of lit­er­a­ture as a business, from the value of journalistic writing compared to prose fiction to the structure of contracts with publishers. Dostoevsky, who habitually ends his letters with a request for money or a complaint about its absence, was variously publisher, editor, and contributor to his own and o ­ thers’ periodicals, as well as novelist. Dickens established his own weekly publications, House­hold Words followed by All the Year Round, partly in order better to control the commercialisation of his own literary production, a move that was evidently successful, to judge by a comment from the Economist in 1852: “The works of Dickens are [as] sure to be sold as the bread which is baked is sure to be sold and eaten.”84 Trollope’s autobiography contains a list of all his works to that date and the money he had made from each, totalling £68,939 17s. 5d: a l­ater biographer refers\n\n26\n\nSelling the Story\n\nto it as the “profit-­and-­loss account of his life and work.”85 Even in­de­pen­ dently wealthy writers like Flaubert and Tolstoy seem to have been acutely aware of the financial value of their output—­Flaubert broke with his publisher, Michel Lévy, in a ­bitter disagreement over Lévy’s interpretation of the terms for the publication of Salammbô.86 Tolstoy gifted the copyright to some of his works, in tacit acknowledgement of their financial value, to support the migration of the Dukhobor sect to Canada. Writing had become a business, lit­er­a­ture had become a traded commodity, and its value was regularly and pragmatically established by publishers. Many contested that financial reward could ever be a proxy for aesthetic worth and advanced other criteria for defining literary value.87 In E ­ ngland the Lakeland poets asserted their right to prescribe the nature of reader reception, and thus to control the mode of valuation for their output, according to an abstract notion of absolute aesthetic value, but fell foul of their own need for income, the declining popularity of poetry in the 1820s ­after Lord Byron’s death, and the vagueness and subjectivity of their surrogate value yardsticks. But their insistence on the incommensurability of aesthetic and economic value announces a common theme across other Eu­ro­pean cultures that ­w ill eventually lead to vari­ous permutations of the argument for a separate dimension of aesthetic activity capable of being valued only on its own, self-­referential terms. In E ­ ngland the public debate between Walter Besant, Henry James, and Robert Louis Stevenson in the pages of Longman’s Magazine in 1884 attempted to define the laws of fiction as they related to the repre­sen­t a­t ion of real­ity—­a nd thus, presumably, to a value hierarchy based on compliance with ­those laws.88 In France, contested rules that promoted artistic values over accurate repre­sen­ta­tion would pit Théophile Gautier, the Goncourt b ­ rothers, and eventually Joris-­Karl Huysmans and Stéphane Mallarmé against the realist and naturalist schools. The enthusiastic and influential participation of literary critics in ­t hese debates— ­Sainte-­Beuve in France,89 Ruskin in E ­ ngland,90 and 91 Stepan Shevyrev in Rus­sia, to name but a few—­suggests yet another definition of value in the shape of the critical appreciation of “lit­er­a­ture” as selected by a self-­appointed elite. Ruskin adds further to the list with claims for pedagogical value, through the transmission of information and the power to excite noble emotions or intellectual visions, as he puts it in Munera Pulveris (1872)—­a combination of informative and moral value.92 He also, importantly, recognises the importance of posterity\n\nIntroduction: The Economics of Narrative 27\n\nvalue, distinguishing in his 1864 Sesame and Lilies between “books of the hour” and “books of all time.”93 Other critics extend the list still further, as, for example, Pierre Bourdieu does with his claim for lit­er­a­ture’s ability to confer social or cultural capital on its recipients.94 This hardly helps in arriving at a workable definition of literary value. The list of the dif­fer­ent approaches to value is too long—­fi nancial, artistic, critical, pedagogical, moral, social, or cultural—­a nd the criteria are too woolly and subjective. Nor do more purely economic models help in practice. A commercial definition of literary value would, I think, be based on a calculation of “reach over time,” or the cumulative number of readers of any given work, in all media, since its first publication. Our current definition of the literary canon can prob­ably be seen as a nonscientific way of evaluating the relative penetration of the overall (and evolving) readership over an extended time between dif­fer­ent works. In theory some kind of proxy framework for relating readers to copy sales (in what­ever format) might then give us a financial approximation of literary value. But ­there are too many holes in this approach for it to be genuinely useful. The time period required for assessment is too long to deal accurately with any but the older works in the canon. Reach is difficult to define—­does reading, for example, an anthologised extract from a longer work count? Do we need to make adjustments, for example to reflect smaller pos­si­ble readerships for e­ arlier works? And how should we now deal with ­free distribution, made pos­si­ble by the internet, as works fall out of copyright? So all formulations of literary value, w ­ hether aesthetic, ethical, philosophical, or economic, have their prob­lems. The definition that I have found most helpful, and that I ­shall by and large retain ­here, is based on what I call the point of sale. It asks how an author might have assessed the “value” of a manuscript as he or she creates it. It is pragmatic and empirical. It admits dif­fer­ent forms of value, from the aesthetic, through the reputational, to the commercial. It is synchronic and thus sufficiently restricted in time to be more capable of delimitation and definition than diachronic approaches that seek to address value in the longue durée. It can be supported by con­temporary evidence of market, culture, and readership. Perhaps most importantly, it attempts to re-­ create the ­actual tensions between economic and literary value that confront ­every author and to deduce from the evidence of the text how the author dealt with the issue.\n\n28\n\nSelling the Story\n\nPart of the authorial assessment would, for any author dependent on publishing as a main source of income, be based on the financial value of the work in pro­gress, as expressed in terms of reasonably vis­i­ble and predictable income streams—­for example, from serialisation, from publication in book format, from the sale of foreign rights, from theatrical royalties if the work could be turned into a play, and even from merchandise sales for the most popu­lar works. As we have seen in Balzac’s letter quoted ­earlier, this exercise certainly produced a definition of literary value of practical use, in that it not only paid the bills but gave authors a fairly clear guide as to how to vary their output to increase their income, if they w ­ ere so inclined. Another part, closely connected to the first, might be based on perceived initial reach. It relates specifically to the expectations of the author or publisher (who might have dif­fer­ent views) around the initial publication of a work of prose fiction as to the size of readership it could reach over a l­ imited period of time—­typically the duration of its serialisation plus the initial publication in book format. We know that publishers w ­ ere prepared to pay for texts that expanded circulation and attracted new readers, so to an extent “reach value” overlaps with financial value. But it is not just a financial or economic mea­sure of literary value. Authors self-­ evidently had their own reasons for seeking increased reach, perhaps as a way of broadcasting text that they wished to be recognised for its aesthetic, intellectual, or, indeed, purely entertainment qualities, perhaps as a mea­sure of influence or prestige. Zola’s spirited defence of the commercialisation of publishing in an article entitled “L’Argent dans la littérature” for both Rus­sian and French periodicals in 1880 included a clear recognition of the impor­tant part that increased reach had played in the development of the market: “As a first step, the spread of education creates thousands of new readers. Newspapers get everywhere; even in the countryside ­people buy books. Inside half a ­century the book, which used to be a luxury item, becomes an everyday consumable.”95 And Zola’s own nineteen attempts to be elected to the Académie française seem to indicate that he thought the reach he had achieved had created a right to have its value publicly recognised. Fi­nally, an author might be aware of pre­ce­dents which indicated that substantial changes to the readership ­were likely in the foreseeable ­future, even though they could not affect conditions at the time of publication. Stendhal’s dedication of four of his works—­P romenades dans\n\nIntroduction: The Economics of Narrative 29\n\nRome, Le Rouge et le noir, La Chartreuse de Parme, and Lucien Leuwen—to the “Happy Few” is usually taken to be a reference to a f­uture readership able to comprehend his works. Dostoevsky’s ability to compare the French publishing market, where the development of a mass readership was u ­ nder way, with that in Rus­sia, where the pro­cess had yet to begin, is crucial to understanding his relationship with his Rus­sian readers. The initial panning that L’Assommoir received led Zola to look to posterity for redress, as he writes to the critic of Le Gaulois: “Perhaps it is necessary for the vast ensemble of novels to which I have dedicated myself to be completely finished for it to be understood and judged. And I’ll happily wait another ten years.”96 This creates a third component of value: posterity or perpetuity value, itself a mea­sure of ­future reach based on the anticipation of a mass, or simply a more receptive, readership to come. The concept of reach, ­whether immediate or over time, is far more than a purely financial or economic yardstick. Authors write for many reasons: to achieve artistic expression, to illustrate moral or philosophical concepts, to describe the ­human condition—­the list is long and the grubby business of making enough money to live on may be well down the hierarchy even for journalists. But ­every author needs reach, for without it the writer is a voice crying in the wilderness. Broad reach suggests a work’s ability to travel across geography, across social bound­ aries, across intellectual barriers, and through time. Reach is a mea­sure of reception, a pro­cess of evaluation and classification that builds forms of temporary or more durable consensus out of multiple subjective experiences. The dif­fer­ent manifestations of reach, from the canonical novel to the viral blog, are far beyond the scope of this book to investigate, save to observe that each manifestation ­w ill commonly imply, though it does not presuppose, a financial return, even if this takes time or rewards o ­ thers apart from the author, as many recipients of the work ­w ill be prepared to pay for the benefit they expect from reading it. Reach, as I have suggested, is best determined in terms of the cumulative volume of readers over time, insofar as this can be mea­sured or, more likely, approximately deduced. Several alternative definitions of literary value would insist on a further component, a mea­sure of the quality of reach. Critical value, for instance, relates to reception within a small (but influential) subset of the pos­si­ble readership; pedagogical value to another subset. When we distinguish between “literary” and “nonliterary” texts, we implicitly create a value-­based hierarchy between\n\n30\n\nSelling the Story\n\ndif­fer­ent subsets of readers. I have chosen not to incorporate ­these distinctions into my definition of literary value, partly ­because their subjectivity undermines their usefulness, but mostly ­because in the long run it seems to me that many of the differences they seek to highlight are, in fact, captured by a rolling concept of reach. Critical value merges over time with posterity value as assimilation into the literary canon proceeds or fails. Harry Potter may be as widely read as Shakespeare for a period, but reach over time is the only effective means of establishing a long-­term yardstick of value. So when I refer to the “literary” or “narrative” value of a text for publication, as w ­ ill frequently be the case in ­these pages, I mean a mea­sure of value based on reach over time. In nineteenth-­century France and Rus­sia, it is implicitly (though still only partially) an economic concept, in that novels published by serialisation in newspapers or journals relied on the economic success of their vector to achieve initial, short-­term reach. Subsequent medium-­term extensions of reach could be achieved if the initial platform had provided enough penetration, through dif­ fer­ent formats, markets, or media. It also includes the longer-­term potential reach that could be anticipated given con­temporary trends in demographics, the evolution of the readership, and publishing strategies. Authors, I think, write by and large for the readership they can see at the point of sale plus the new readers they think they might acquire as a result of reasonably foreseeable developments in the readership over a relatively short time horizon—­a few de­cades, a ­century at most. “I’m writing this, I hope without lying or pulling the wool over my eyes, just like a pleas­ur­able letter to a friend. I won­der what that friend ­w ill think of it in 1880?” asks Stendhal in Vie de Henri Brulard.97 All three metrics are proxies for reader reception that allow the author to form a view of the value of his or her enterprise. The first asks how early reader reception translates into short-­term economic gain and provides an immediate exchange rate between reception and monetary value. The second allows market analy­sis by subsegmenting reception between dif­fer­ent demographics or reader communities. The third allows forward projection—­business planning—by rationalising assumptions about market evolution, or changes in reception. Importantly, my definition recognises the transactional nature of the exchange in that it explic­itly allows for both the vendor’s and the buyer’s perspectives of value. Serialisation provides an unparalleled oppor-\n\nIntroduction: The Economics of Narrative 31\n\ntunity for reader response, and ­there are copious examples across the nineteenth ­century of letters to authors, from complete strangers as well as from friends, offering advice, criticism, requests, and even their own personal stories as plot. Prendergast estimates that the four hundred surviving letters from readers to Sue in response to his enormous and hugely successful Les Mystères de Paris represent only about a third of the likely total volume.98 The mea­sure is, of course, crude: none of the three components of value can be estimated with precision, nor do they share a common unit of mea­sure­ment, nor can they be satisfactorily summed. But they do, on the other hand, accurately reflect the practical issues facing an author or a publisher who intends to create or distribute a text and who must find a way to add apples and oranges. Life is, perhaps, simpler for a publisher prepared to reduce additional reach to a direct proxy for further financial returns, and more complex for an author or con­temporary critic worrying about the quality of that reach—­w ill the work reach the “right” readers?—­but the essential need to make impor­tant judgements based on a combination of anticipated return and reach does not vary. If my definition seems to insist overly on the economic aspects of reception and reach, it is ­because this perspective has been largely ignored in critical debate. My intention in foregrounding it is to rectify the balance rather than to suggest that novelists write only for money. The artistic, philosophical, metaphysical, religious, and biographical influences and objectives of each of my chosen authors have all been extensively analysed. All have demonstrably played impor­tant roles in artistic creation. But in analysing an era when writing prose fiction was becoming a profession, a modern critic ignores the impact of economics on the very text itself at his or her peril. The economic approach complements, rather than excludes, aesthetic and intellectual assessment. It is, in fact, essentially interlinked with artistic evaluation. In many instances economic d ­ rivers have direct aesthetic effect, as, for example, when financial considerations influence a choice of genre or literary device, and all three chapters on the chosen authors ­w ill discuss this interrelationship at length. My definition may also seem rather subjective and prone to “intentional fallacy” objections, but in fact each of my three components of value can, I think, be adequately supported by external evidence. An author’s perception of financial value can be deduced from many dif­fer­ent\n\n32\n\nSelling the Story\n\nsources—­f rom correspondence, as we have seen in the case of Balzac; from the terms of contracts with publishers; from con­temporary comparisons of payments per page, column, or line, which we know obsessed some authors. Strategies to increase reach can be evidenced by a comparison between t­hose works and con­temporary lit­er­a­ture in its broadest sense, comprising both journalism and fiction, to identify trends in reporting and repre­sen­ta­tion that can then be compared with the author’s output to detect w ­ hether and how the author has imported, for example, devices of proven popularity in other media. Awareness of posterity value can be implied from the speed of change in the readership, as evidenced by growth in literacy; improvements in reader access to printed materials (most notably, in the nineteenth ­century, by the extension of the railway and road networks); the growing affordability of publications through efficiencies, technological advances, or rises in disposable income and leisure time; and the invention of new publication formats, such as the boulevard newspapers of the mid-1860s in both France and Rus­sia, specifically designed to address a growing mass readership. A crucial advantage of my point of sale approach is that, by postulating a mea­sure of literary value at a point in time that coincides with the creation of the text in question, it allows us to see narrative device as a direct means of modifying that value and to identify and analyse ­these mechanisms in terms of economic value creation. Further, it allows us to recognise how frequently authors discuss and represent concepts of narrative value within their texts. On occasion they write directly about the value of literary or artistic production, as Balzac does in Illusions perdues, or Zola in L’Œuvre. More often they describe in-­story characters telling and receiving stories and show the mechanisms that determine credibility from the points of view of a story’s narrator and of its recipient. Entire genres—­detective stories, crime novels, courtroom dramas—­depend on this device. The external reader is required to become involved as critic of ­t hese mimetic narratives, attributing more value, for example, to the narrative of one character than another, modifying the perception of value as new narratives are presented, and understanding, even if intuitively rather than explic­itly, what it is that has caused value to shift. Assessing the value of a literary narrative, even if we do not express it in ­those terms, is something that we all do routinely. So when I talk of value in this intratextual context, I am essentially describing another layer of textual reception. Just as the value of an en-\n\nIntroduction: The Economics of Narrative 33\n\ntire text depends on its reception over time, so authors use the building blocks of that text as tools to manipulate value and provide their own repre­sen­ta­tions of the functioning of this pro­cess within the text. An author’s choice of literary device can affect the economic value of the overall text. We see examples of this e­ very day in, for example, the dif­ fer­ent treatments of the same subject between broadsheet and tabloid newspapers: stylistic variation is used to maximise demand within dif­ fer­ent target readerships. In this way the traditional tools of critical analy­sis can be repurposed to show how an author uses literary device to manipulate value. Plot, for example, has an evident economic function in acting as “the motor forces that drive the text forward,” as Peter Brooks describes it in Reading for the Plot.99 A more accurate description might be “the motor forces that drive the reader through the text” and thereby create demand for the product. Brooks barely admits an economic dimension in his entire discussion, but some of his examples show economic agency at work. Balzac’s ambitious heroes, from Rastignac to Rubempré, impel readers to read on to the very end to find out what happens. The rambling plots of Sue’s Les Mystères de Paris, serialised daily over almost eigh­teen months, suggest that equivalent value could be created simply by persuading readers to read to the end of a single episode rather than requiring the conclusion of the entire work. Detective stories increase demand by deliberately frustrating their readers’ desire to know the end. Authors whose works subvert plot, as Brooks argues of Flaubert’s L’Education sentimentale, describing it as a novel of “tenuous readability,” may pay an economic price if their readers get bored.100 Genre is also a power­ful driver of economic value. At the very core of the shift from romanticism to realism, and thence to naturalism, lies an economic motive force. Reaction against the remoteness of romanticism to a broadening readership, the attraction of the taboo-­breaking novelty of realism, the increasing influence of periodicals and newspapers as the carriers of prose fiction, and the influence of developing journalistic techniques of sensation seem to have coalesced into a product that attracted readers from an ever-­w idening demographic. Similar stories unfurled across Eu­rope: Scott gave way to Dickens, François-­René de Chateaubriand to Balzac, Nikolai Karamzin to Nikolai Gogol and Aleksandr Pushkin. T ­ here is no mistaking the intimate connection during the nineteenth ­century between the evolution of literary genre and the expansion of the readership as literacy and demand grew. The\n\n34\n\nSelling the Story\n\ncircularity of the relationship confers real economic agency on genre: improvements in literacy and education produce more readers, who in turn fuel demand for new or evolving genres of reading material, which in turn attract more readers. Critical opinion, though, has taken some time to come around to this point of view. Tzvetan Todorov typifies the more traditional point of view when he describes the link between genre and society as principally constative rather than performative, more a ­simple reflection of society than an agent for change: “Genres bring to light the constitutive features of the society to which they belong.”101 In Qu’est-ce qu’un genre littéraire? Jean-­Marie Schaeffer admits no economic dimension to his entire discussion.102 Poovey, on the other hand, argues that we can extend generic classification much further to encompass not just imaginative genres but ways of creating money (monetary genres, including the role of bank notes and bills of exchange as narrative in their own right) and ways of talking about money and economics (financial writing, including journalism about finance).103 In an era when the bound­aries between fact and fiction ­were not easy to define, when the real value of bank notes belied the stories on their face, when prospectus became puffery, when reporting blended with invention, the use of genre as a tool to mediate economic value was widespread. Much the same can be said of other aspects of literary construction. Format is, to a large degree, a response to economic pressures. Robert Darnton’s history of the publication of Denis Diderot’s Encyclopédie shows just how impor­tant a part the competing quarto and octavo formats played in ensuring the penetration of this key tool of the Enlightenment. “[The documentary evidence] show[s] how the book changed in shape as the publishers adapted it to an ever-­w idening audience and how publishing consortia succeeded one another as the speculators scrambled to exploit the biggest best seller of the ­century.”104 Serial publication enabled newspapers and periodicals to exploit the evident commercial attractions of prose fiction in a journalistic format to drive subscriptions and copy sales. It also functions, as Todd has pointed out, as a means of shifting economic and ethical risk between publisher, censor, and author.105 Boulevard newspapers catered to a mass readership in a similar way to modern tabloids, though, as Tim Farrant has pointed out, their contribution to the fragmentation of lit­er­a­ture through serialisation and mass distribution may eventually have had the opposite effect by reinforcing the aesthetic and moral standing of the novel when it reemerged\n\nIntroduction: The Economics of Narrative 35\n\nas a separate format.106 The Rus­sian “thick journal” grew out of one publisher’s attempt to devise a monthly compendium with content broad enough to attract urban and provincial readers in a format that could be distributed in the provinces without falling apart before it reached its readers: such are the practicalities of publishing. Fi­nally, many everyday literary devices can also be shown to have economic influence. My discussion of Dostoevsky relies in part on the economic power of iteration—­the repetition of a single story over and over again in dif­fer­ent narrative modes in order to maximise the chances of attracting readers, the literary equivalent of a reinsurance contract. In the case of Zola, I argue that his appropriation of journalistic devices, in par­tic­u­lar hyperbole and compression, plays a crucial role in the development of a literary style that enabled the book to reemerge as an eco­nom­ically ­v iable format.\n\nBalzac, Dostoevsky, and Zola If my thesis of the novel as an implicit commentary on the conditions of its own production is to hold ­water, then it must be flexible and broadly applicable. In choosing works by Balzac, Dostoevsky, and Zola as my test beds, I hope to be able to show that the concept is relevant across time, geography, and culture. To avoid spreading the butter too thinly, I have concentrated on the French and Rus­sian literary markets of the nineteenth c­ entury. The core of this book consists of three extended and interlinked chapters, one on each of the three writers, in which I have approached three major works from the economic perspective I have set out h ­ ere. All three authors have been extensively covered in critical analy­sis, and each chapter ­w ill discuss the critical context of each. The combined volume of works about them would dwarf their own output, which is perhaps another comment on literary value. In Chapter 1, “Balzac: Narrative as Business,” I show how Balzac’s own commercial experience is reflected in his narratives. The large majority of his writing occurs at the precise moment of the migration of prose fiction from book format to that of the serialised roman-­feuilleton in the periodical, from the mid-1830s to the mid-1840s. The interaction between fiction and format is traceable throughout his works. The fact that his works also depict an unmistakeably Balzacian plethora of transactions affords a par­tic­u­lar opportunity to study the relationship between\n\n36\n\nSelling the Story\n\nthe repre­sen­ta­tion of transaction as a subject for fiction and the rapidly changing external realities of transacting with publishers and readers to sell his output. His own constant financial difficulties, ­until the final years of his life, lead to a well-­evidenced concern for his own financial solvency throughout his writing ­career, which translates, as we have seen, into an acute awareness of the economic value of narrative. His head-­to-­head rivalry in the early 1840s with Sue, possibly the most financially successful writer of his generation, allows a side-­by-­side contrast of very dif­fer­ent approaches to creating literary value. Given this perspective, Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes (Splendeurs) suggests itself as the text of choice. The span of its composition, over twelve years from 1835 to 1847, covers seminal changes in the French publishing market and in the demographics of the readership, Balzac’s own move into fiction as a serialised format in a journalistic context, and his painful evolution from serial debtor to established and, once married to Eveline Hanska, solvent chevalier of the Légion d’honneur. Of Balzac’s major works, it is the only one to have been written ove"
