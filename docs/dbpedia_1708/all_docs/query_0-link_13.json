        "meta_description": "Nociceptive stimuli disrupt sleep, but may, or may not, entail an arousal. While arousal reactions go along with the activation of a widespread cortical network, the factors enabling such activation remain unknown. Here we used intracranial EEG in humans to test the relation between the cortical activity immediately preceding a noxious stimulus and the capacity of such a stimulus to trigger arousal. Intracranial EEG signals were analyzed during all-night sleep in 14 epileptic patients (4 women), who received laser stimuli slightly above their individual pain threshold. During 5 s preceding each stimulus, the functional correlation (spectral phase-coherence) between the main spinothalamic sensory area (posterior insula) and 12 other brain regions, grouped in four networks, as well as their spectral contents, were contrasted according to the presence of a stimulus-induced arousal, and then fed into a logistic regression model to assess their predictive value. Enhanced prestimulus phase-coherence between the sensory posterior insula and neocortical and limbic areas increased significantly the probability of arousal to nociceptive stimuli, in both slow-wave (N2) and rapid eye movements/paradoxical sleep. Furthermore, during N2 sleep, arousal was facilitated by stimulus delivery in periods of attenuated slow-wave activity. Together, these data indicate that sleep micro-states with enhanced interareal communication facilitate information transfer from sensory to higher-order cortical areas, and hence physiological arousal.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Sleep is commonly subdivided into stages based on specific electrophysiological characteristics; however, within each single sleep stage, the functional state of the brain is continuously changing. Here we show that the probability for a phasic noxious stimulus to entail an arousal is modulated by the prestimulus interareal phase-coherence between sensory and higher-level cortical areas. Fluctuations in interareal communication immediately before the noxious stimulus may determine the responsiveness to incoming input by facilitating or preventing the transfer of noxious information from sensory to multiple higher-level cortical networks.",

        "text": "Patient selection\n\nFourteen patients with refractory partial epilepsy were included in the study (10 men, 4 women; mean age 28 years, range 19-51 years). They were consecutive patients agreeing to participate in the study, in accord with their physician in charge and having at least one electrode contact in the posterior insula together with contacts in areas belonging to at least two other networks (see below). To delineate the extent of the cortical epileptogenic area and to plan a tailored surgical treatment, depth EEG recording electrodes (diameter 0.8 mm; 5-15 recording contacts 2 mm long, intercontact interval 1.5 mm) were implanted according to the Talairach space (Guénot et al., 2001; Isnard et al., 2018). The procedure aims at recording spontaneous seizures but also includes the functional mapping of potentially eloquent cortical areas using evoked potentials recordings and cortical electrical stimulation (Ostrowsky et al., 2002; Mazzola et al., 2006). In agreement with French regulations relative to invasive investigations with direct individual benefit, patients were fully informed about electrode implantation, iEEG and evoked potential recordings, and cortical stimulation procedures used to localize the epileptogenic cortical areas, and gave their consent. The laser stimulation paradigm was approved by the local and regional Ethics Committee (CPP Sud Est IV no. 2006-A00572-49).\n\nSpinothalamic-specific laser stimulations were performed during one full night after a minimal delay of 5 d after electrode implantation; at that time, any “first-night” effect had faded away, and antiepileptic drugs had been stopped or tapered down with daily small doses (Table 1). None of these patients reported pain symptoms before or after the recording session.\n\nElectrode implantation\n\nIntracerebral electrodes were implanted using the Talairach's stereotactic frame (Talairach and Bancaud, 1973). A cerebral angiography was performed in stereotactic conditions using an X-ray source located 4.85 m away from the patient's head. This eliminates the linear enlargement because of X-ray divergence and allows a 1:1 scale so that films could be used for measurements without any correction. In a second step, the relevant targets were identified on the patient's MRI, previously enlarged to a scale of 1:1. As MR and angiographic images were at the same scale, they could easily be superimposed, so as to avoid damage to blood vessels and minimize the risk of hemorrhage during electrode implantation.\n\nAnatomical localization of recording sites\n\nThe localization of recording contacts was determined using two different procedures. In 7 patients implanted before the year 2010, MRI could not be performed with electrodes in place because of the physical characteristics of the stainless-steel contacts. In these cases, the scale 1:1 postimplantation skull radiographs performed within the stereotactic frame were superimposed to the preimplantation scale 1:1 MRI slice corresponding to each electrode track, thus permitting to plot each contact onto the appropriate MRI slice of each patient to determine its coordinates (MRIcro software) (Rorden and Brett, 2000). In the other 7 patients, the implanted electrodes were MRI-compatible and cortical contacts could be directly visualized on the postoperative 3D MRIs. In both cases, anatomic scans were acquired on a 3-Tesla Siemens Avanto Scanner using a 3D MPRAGE sequence with the following parameters: TI/TR/TE 1100/2040/2.95 ms, voxel size: 1 × 1 × 1 mm3, FOV = 256 × 256 mm2.\n\nIntracortical electrode contacts were mapped to the standard stereotaxic space (MNI) by processing MRI data with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). Anatomical T1-3D images before and after implantation were coregistered and normalized to the MNI template brain image using a mutual information approach and the segmentation module of SPM12, which segments, corrects bias, and spatially normalizes images with respect to the MNI model. Then, the cortical localization of electrodes was performed using a regional atlas (WFU Pickatlas version 3) in MRIcron®. In the 7 patients with MRI-compatible electrodes, the cortical contacts could be directly visualized on the postoperative normalized 3D MRIs. In the 7 patients without MRI-compatible electrodes, the coordinates of contacts were determined on their own preoperative MRI according to the procedure described above, thus permitting to plot each contact onto the appropriate MRI slice of each patient (MRIcron software) to determine its MNI coordinates. Figure 1A illustrates the 91 cerebral contacts from which iEEG signal was recorded and analyzed.\n\nNociceptive-specific laser stimulation\n\nRadiant nociceptive heat pulses of 5 ms duration were delivered with a Nd:YAP-laser (Yttrium Aluminum Perovskite; wavelength 1.34 µm). The laser beam was transmitted from the generator to the stimulating probe via an optical fiber of 10 m length (550 µm diameter with sub-miniature version A-905 connector). Perceptive and nociceptive thresholds were determined in each patient immediately before the recording session. Nociceptive thresholds to Aδ stimuli were determined as the minimal laser energy producing a pricking sensation, compared with pulling a hair or receiving a boiling water drop in at least two of three stimuli. They were obtained in all subjects with energy densities between 80 and 100 mJ/mm2, which are within the usual data range observed in our laboratory and those reported by others using Nd:YAP lasers (Cruccu et al., 2008). These parameters have been validated as being able to activate selectively the spinothalamic system in humans (e.g., Garcia-Larrea et al., 2010; Perchet et al., 2012; La Cesa et al., 2018), including during sleep, where they arouse subjects in ∼30% of the cases (Bastuji et al., 2008; Mazza et al., 2012).\n\nData acquisition and recording procedure\n\nIn each patient, there were two runs of 10-15 stimulations each. Interstimulus interval was pseudo-randomly adjusted online and varied between 10 and 20 s. Stimulus energy was set at the individual nociceptive threshold previously determined and applied to the skin in the superficial radial nerve territory, on the dorsum of the hand contralateral to the hemispheric side of electrode implantation. The heat spot was slightly shifted over the skin surface between two successive stimuli to avoid both sensitization and peripheral nociceptor fatigue. Eight patients were stimulated on the right hand, and 6 on the left hand. Then the patients were allowed to sleep at their own time, and no further laser stimulation was delivered until a minimum of 20 min of continuous sleep had been obtained. The identification of the different sleep stages (N2, N3, and PS) was done online by one of the investigators (H.B.) expert in sleep studies. If one stimulus awoke the sleeper, the stimulation sequence was immediately discontinued. A second investigator entered the room and delivered nociceptive pulses transmitted through the optic fiber from the laser stimulator. The 10 m optical fiber transited under the door separating the recording and sleeping areas and allowed to stimulate conveniently the dorsum of the hand despite movements of the subjects during the night. Both the sleeping subject and the investigator wore eye protections. Runs of stimulations were delivered during the different sleep stages up to 6:00 A.M. Recordings were performed during all night in referential mode, the reference electrode being chosen for each patient on an implanted contact located in the skull. The iEEG signal was recorded continuously from 96 to 128 channels at a sampling frequency of 256 or 512 Hz, amplified and band pass filtered (0.33-128 Hz; –3 dB, 12 dB/octave) to be stored in hard disk for offline analysis (Micromed SAS).\n\nSleep scoring and arousal reactions\n\nCriteria of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine adapted to intracerebral recordings (Magnin et al., 2004; Bastuji et al., 2012; Claude et al., 2015) were used for iEEG data. Hypnograms based on 30 s epochs allowed determining the vigilance state during which stimuli were delivered. As already observed in previous studies, laser stimuli delivered during sleep phase N3 induced quite systematically a shift to N2 sleep stage (Bastuji et al., 2008, 2012); therefore, only recordings from sleep stage N2 and PS are presented here. Following the American Academy of Sleep Medicine criteria adapted for intracerebral recordings (Bastuji et al., 2012), “cortical arousals” were defined as bursts of waking cortical activity lasting at least 3 s, and labeled “awakenings” if they persisted >15 s. These arousal reactions (cortical arousal and awakening) were considered as stimulus-related if they occurred within 10 s after noxious stimulus onset. Signals obtained when stimuli were delivered during an arousal period were rejected.\n\nInterareal functional connectivity\n\nThe main steps of iEEG signal processing are illustrated in Figure 1C–F. Using Brain Analyzer software, FFT of the 5 s iEEG signals preceding the stimuli was applied in three spectral bands: δ-θ (0.5-7.5 Hz), α-σ (8-15 Hz), and β-γ (16-40 Hz), which were labeled “low,” “intermediate,” and “high” frequency bands, respectively. Higher γ frequencies were not included, as they are less involved in long-range coherence relative to lower frequencies (von Stein and Sarnthein, 2000) and are often “nested” within slower oscillations (Lisman and Jensen, 2013). In each patient, iEEG spectral content was computed for all the brain contacts explored, during both sleep N2 and PS, and stored separately according to the presence (A) or the absence (NA) of an arousal or an awakening reaction after the stimulus. All contacts located within the epileptic network and/or in lesional tissues were excluded from the analysis.\n\nFunctional connectivity was studied using iEEG phase-coherence analysis, the sensory posterior insula acting as “seed region” with respect to the rest of the cerebral areas analyzed, grouped in four networks (MNI coordinates in Table 2). The posterior insula was chosen as the reference area, since this region receives the most important sensory projections from the spinothalamic system (Dum et al., 2009) and exhibits the earliest cortical nociceptive signals in humans (Frot and Mauguière, 2003; Bastuji et al., 2016). Networks selected for phase-coherence analysis were extracted following consensual literature on functional commonalities, and comprised the following: (1) a central “executive” network, including dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) areas; (2) a “salience” network, including the anterior insula, ACC, mid-cingulate cortex, and supplementary motor areas; (3) a “late-integrative network,” including the posterior cingulate-precuneus, the perigenual cingulate cortex, and hippocampus; and (4) an “emotional” network joining orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, and, again, the perigenual cingulate cortex (Neugebauer et al., 2009; Doucet et al., 2019). Phase-coherence was computed after FFT of the 5 s signal, in referential mode, for each spectral band power. The phase-coherence value was calculated as the quotient between correlation and autocorrelation for each frequency and each channel pair and underwent Fisher's z transformation before statistical analysis, to transform the sampling distribution of coherence values so that it becomes normally distributed (Nunez et al., 1997). Coherence values were computed by calculating the cross-spectrum (a measure of the joint spectral properties of the two channels) normalized by their auto-spectrum (the power spectrum of each channel), as follows: Coh(c1,c2)(f)=|Cov(c1,c2)(f)|2|Cov(c1,c1)(f)||Cov(c2,c2)(f)| with Covc1,c2f=Σc1,if–moyc1fc2,if–moyc2f\n\nIn the second formula, totaling is conducted using the segment number i. The average is obtained with reference to the segment with a fixed frequency f and a fixed channel c.\n\nStatistical analyses\n\nDuring N2 sleep, individual phase-coherence values between posterior insula and the different brain networks were submitted to a three-way mixed design ANOVA with “arousal” (yes/no) and “frequency band” (low, intermediate, high) as repeated measures (“within” factors), and the four cerebral networks as between factor. A similar ANOVA was performed with phase-coherence values obtained during PS. Post hoc tests (Holm-Sidak test corrected for multiple comparisons) were applied in case of significant effects following ANOVAs. The reported effect size measure was η2 in ANOVA and Cohen's d in t tests.\n\nSpectral power was normalized by dividing each value by the average of all spectrum values in a given patient, and this for each network and sleep stage. Individual spectral power values obtained during N2 sleep were submitted to a three-way mixed ANOVA with “arousal” and “frequency band” as within factors and “cerebral network” as between factor. The latter factor included the four previous networks and the posterior insula. A similar ANOVA was performed with power values obtained during PS. Post hoc tests (Holm-Sidak test corrected for multiple comparisons) were applied in case of significant effects following ANOVAs. The reported effect size measure was η2p for ANOVA and Cohen's d for t tests.\n\nA logistic regression model was used to investigate to what extent a combination of explanatory variables would classify iEEG prestimulus periods as predicting arousal versus nonarousal. The default variables introduced in the model were those having shown a significant individual association with the two outcomes in ANOVA, on the condition that there were not themselves mutually correlated.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 8 and StatView softwares."
