        "text": "French music was much encouraged by British concert promoters in London during World War Two. Plans for a Festival of English and French Music had to be abandoned as a result of the Fall of France, but the planning was an ambitious instance of musical entente cordiale which is explored in the first part of this study. In 1942 General de Gaulle and the Free French start to sponsor a series of 'Concerts de musique française' at the Wigmore Hall. They were organized by Tony Mayer (for the Free French and, later, at the French Embassy) and by Felix Aprahamian, whose deep knowledge of French music and whose contacts with London musicians enabled him to arrange marvellous programmes, performed by musicians such as Maggie Teyte, Benjamin Britten, Peter Pears, Michael Tippett, Reginald Goodall and the Griller String Quartet. After the liberation of Paris, the concerts featured several of the greatest French composers and performers of the time such as Francis Poulenc, Olivier Messiaen, Pierre Bernac, Gérard Souzay, Ginette Neveu, Pierre Fournier, Maurice Gendron, Monique Haas and Yvonne Loriod. This monograph also includes a complete listing of the 'Concerts de musique française' from 1942 to 1947.\n\nDuring the period preceding the First World War, the E.A. Mario's work as a critic, poet and composer shows and catalyses a new attention to the 'canzone di guerra' (war song), a genre characterised by specific poetics, aesthetics, linguistic, and formal parameters. With the outbreak of the World War I, this leaning influences the whole Neapolitan song industry. The song contests announced by journals and publishers become now 'patriotics'. The 'canzone di guerra' is conceived to increase the group identity and dispel the fear of death, as well as to provide moral support to the soldiers. With this aim, E.A. Mario composes Canzone di Trincea and Marcia 'e Notte, two songs which the author himself brings to the troops on the front line. A couple of songs frame the Italian military and cultural history related with the World War I. Serenata all'Imperatore is a piece written in 1915. It is an artistic answer to an ironic statement by the Emperor Franz Joseph I about the Italian military organisation. La Leggenda del Piave, composed in 1918 after the 'battaglia del solstizio' (solstice battle), is concerned with the most significant episodes of the Italian military history during the First World War. At a later stage, the song will become the Italian national anthem. The most important songs of the repertoire related with the war will be collected by E.A. Mario in Il libro grigio-verde. By the analysis of the coeval literary and musical documents, this study aims to draw attention to the relevant features which characterise the poetics and the aesthetics of the 'canzone di guerra' in the work of E.A. Mario during the World War I (a well-known artistic aspect which has never received an in-depth analysis). Through an investigation of the historical, musical and literary interconnection, this work tries to answer some significant questions: what kind of interrelation exists between the E.A. Mario's work and the World War I? In which ways his activity as a critic and author influences the aesthetics and poetics parameters of the song of this period? Which is the critics reaction to this process? Which are the meanings attributed to the 'canzone di guerra' during the critical phase of the First World War?"
