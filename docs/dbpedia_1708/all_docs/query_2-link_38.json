The Upper Rhine GrabenÂ (URG), located in France and Germany, is bordered by northâsouth-trending faults, some of which are considered active, posing a potential threat to the dense population and infrastructures on the Alsace plain. The largest historical earthquake in the region was the M6.5Â±0.5 Basel earthquake in 1356. Current seismicity (M>2.5 since 1960) is mostly diffuse and located within the graben. We build upon previous seismic hazard studies of the URG by exploring uncertainties in greater detail and revisiting a number of assumptions.

Uncertainties in faults' moment deficit rates, on the observed seismic events' magnitudeâfrequency distribution and on the momentâarea scaling law of earthquakes, are also explored. Assuming a purely dip-slip normal faulting mechanism associated with a simplified model with three main faults, MmaxÂ maximum probability is estimated at Mwâ6.1. Considering this scenario, there would be a 99â% probability that Mmax is less thanÂ 7.3. In contrast, with a strike-slip assumption associated with a four-main-fault model, consistent with recent paleoseismological studies and the present-day stress field, Mmax is estimated at Mwâ6.8. Based on this scenario, there would be a 99â% probability that Mmax is less thanÂ 7.6.",

        "text": "The Upper Rhine GrabenÂ (URG), located in France and Germany, is bounded by northâsouth-trending faults, some of which are considered active, posing a potential threat to the dense population and the industrial and communication infrastructures of the Alsace plain (Fig.Â 1). The largest historical earthquake in the region was the 1356Â Basel earthquake with a maximum intensity equal to or greater thanÂ IX (Mayer-Rosa and Cadiot, 1979; FÃ¤h et al., 2009), an earthquake presently associated with a magnitude between M6.5Â±0.5 (Manchuel et al., 2018) and M6.9Â±0.2 (FÃ¤h et al., 2009). Current seismicity (M>2.5 since 1960) is mostly diffuse and located within the graben (Doubre et al., 2022), hence the difficulty of attributing individual events to a given fault segment. The bordering faults themselves are relatively quiet except for the southeastern section of the graben, near MulhouseâBasel, where natural seismic sequences (Rouland et al., 1983; Bonjer, 1997) and induced seismicity (Kraft and Deichmann, 2014) have been observed. Seismic activity actually varies along the URG with an increasing rate of events towards the south (Barth et al., 2015). The relative rate between small and large events (bÂ value from the GutenbergâRichter law) also increases towards the south, indicating a surplus of small earthquakes or a deficit of large events roughly south of Strasbourg (Barth et al., 2015). Focal mechanisms of earthquakes suggest that the region is subject to a strike-slip regime with some normal component (Mazzotti et al., 2021), consistent with the large wavelength strain inferred from geodetic data (Henrion et al., 2020). Characterizing the slip rates of the graben's faults based on geodetic data remains challenging. Indeed regional glacial isostatic adjustments, local subsidence and low tectonic strain rates result in a heterogeneous velocity field with values below 0.2âmmâyrâ1 and often within measurement uncertainties (Fuhrmann et al., 2015; Henrion et al., 2020).\n\nThe seismic hazard of the URG has been evaluated by multiple studies at the national/European scale (GrÃ¼nthal et al., 2018; Drouet et al., 2020; Danciu et al., 2021). Furthermore, the seismic hazard of the southern region of the URG in particular has recently been assessed by Chartier et al.Â (2017) with a focus on the Fessenheim nuclear power plant (Fig.Â 1). This study evaluates the seismic hazard using a fault-based approach, taking into account the network of potentially active faults characterized by Jomard et al.Â (2017). This fault-based work involves a moment budget approach, which involves comparing the rate of moment release by seismicity and the rate of moment deficitÂ (MDR) accumulating along locked portions of faults between large earthquakes (i.e.,Â the tectonic loading rate of each fault). Since the period of seismological observation (a few centuries) is too short to be representative of the long-term behavior of seismicity, Chartier et al.Â (2017) instead built a seismicity model assumed to be representative of the long-term magnitudeâfrequency distributionÂ (MFD) of earthquakes, a method similarly used in former studies (e.g.,Â Molnar, 1979; Anderson and Luco, 1983; Avouac, 2015). Earthquakes below Mwâ5 are disregarded (Bommer and Crowley, 2017; Chartier et al., 2017). Earthquakes between Mwâ5 andÂ 6 are assumed to follow the MFD of the catalog of earthquakes they consider. This catalog integrates several sources of instrumental and historical earthquakes including sources from the Laboratoire de DÃ©tection et de GÃ©ophysique of the Commissariat Ã l'Ãnergie Atomique et aux Ã©nergies alternatives (CEA-LDG; http://www-dase.cea.fr/, last access: 19Â JanuaryÂ 2024) and from the FPEC (French Parametric Earthquake Catalogue; Baumont and Scotti, 2011), the Institut de Radioprotection et de SÃ»retÃ© NuclÃ©aire (IRSN) contribution to SHEEC (SHARE European Earthquake Catalogue; Stucchi et al., 2013). MFDs are estimated based on a French seismotectonic zoning scheme defined by Baize et al.Â (2013). Earthquakes with magnitudes above Mwâ6 are assumed to occur on the fault planes (Jomard et al., 2017). Chartier et al.Â (2017) consider two types of model: (1)Â each fault ruptures only as its maximum-magnitude event, which is controlled by the surface area of the seismogenic fault segment (characteristic earthquake model); (2)Â events follow the GutenbergâRichterÂ (GR) law with a bÂ value equal toÂ 1, and the maximum magnitude,Â Mmax, is fixed as in the previous model. The recurrence times of the Mw>6 events are then calibrated so that the rate of moment released by the seismicity models matches the MDR estimated from neotectonic data (Chartier et al., 2017; Jomard et al., 2017). The authors explore different fault geometries (e.g.,Â dip and seismogenic depth) using a logic-tree methodology and then proceed to the probabilistic seismic hazard assessmentÂ (PSHA) of the region, providing a map of the probability of exceedance of peak ground accelerationÂ (PGA) within a time period.\n\nA number of strong assumptions are made within this framework. As mentioned previously, a simplified fault network is used (Jomard et al., 2017), which constrains the seismogenic area available for ruptures. Expert choices have also been made to distribute slip rates (i.e.,Â loading rates) originally attributed to faults that have been removed from the initial fault network (NiviÃ¨re et al., 2008) on other fault segments. On a number of faults, no estimates of neotectonic slip rate are available (e.g.,Â West Rhenish Fault) and the authors have chosen to apply slip rates equivalent to those from other nearby faults (0.01Â to 0.05âmmâyrâ1). The neotectonic data are actually only along-dip slip rate estimates. No along-strike slip rates have yet been published due to the lack of markers to quantify horizontal offsets along faults, and this component has thus been ignored. In addition, Chartier et al.Â (2017) do not consider continuous probabilities as they apply a logic-tree method. Chartier et al.Â (2017) fix the bÂ value toÂ 1, choose the seismogenic depth to be either 15Â or 20âkm, and do not take into account multi-segment ruptures when estimating MmaxÂ for each fault segment.\n\nIn this study, we build upon Chartier et al.Â (2017) seismic hazard evaluation of the southern URG by exploring uncertainties in greater detail, revisiting a number of assumptions. We use the methodology from Rollins and AvouacÂ (2019) and Michel et al.Â (2021), which allows us to evaluate the seismogenic potential of faults in a probabilistic fashion and explore uncertainties for parameters such as the bÂ value orÂ Mmax. We use the fault network and slip rates taken into account by NiviÃ¨re et al.Â (2008), disregarding the West Rhenish Fault, for which, to our knowledge, no slip rate data are available. We assume faults can rupture simultaneously (i.e.,Â multi-segment rupture). In the following sections, we start by describing the concepts and methods we use to constrain the seismogenic potential of the URG, and then we describe the data available before discussing the robustness of our results.\n\nWe use the methodology from Michel et al.Â (2021) in order to estimate the seismogenic potential of the upper Rhine Graben, includingÂ Mmax and its recurrence time. As in Chartier et al.Â (2017), we produce seismicity models representative of the long-term behavior of earthquakes. We assume that the MFDs of background earthquakes follow a GutenbergâRichter power law up toÂ Mmax. We define background earthquakes as mainshocks, as opposed to their subsequent aftershocks. We assume that their timing of occurrence is random, following a Poisson process. Each model is controlled by three parameters: (1)Â Mmax; (2)Â the recurrence time of events of a certain magnitude,Â Ïc; and (3)Â the bÂ value. We use two types of model, namely the tapered and truncated models (Rollins and Avouac, 2019; Michel et al., 2021; Fig.Â S1 in the Supplement). The tapered model type assumes a non-cumulative power-law MFD truncated atÂ Mmax, which gives rise to a tapered MFD in the cumulative form (i.e.,Â the traditional display when representing the GutenbergâRichter law). The truncated model type assumes instead a MFD with a distribution truncated atÂ Mmax in the cumulative form.\n\nThe seismicity models are then tested against three constraints: (1)Â the moment budget, as in Chartier et al.Â (2017), which implies that the moment released by slip on the fault should match the moment deficit accumulating between earthquakes over a long period of time; (2)Â the momentâarea scaling law, an empirical scaling law relating rupture area to slip for each earthquake; and (3)Â the MFD of observed seismicity. Each of these constraints is described in more detail in the following sub-sections. The data and associated uncertainties used for the constraints are discussed in the following section (i.e.,Â Sect.Â 3).\n\n2.1âMoment budget\n\nA moment budget consists in comparing the rate of moment released from slip events (seismic or aseismic),Â mË0Total , with the moment deficit rate,Â mË0def , accumulating between slip events. The moment deficit rate is defined by the equation mË0def=â«Î¼DËdefdA , where Î¼Â is the shear modulus, AÂ is the area that remains locked during the interseismic period (i.e.,Â the potential seismogenic zone) and DËdef Â is the rate at which slip deficit builds up. Since the distribution of locked segments of faults and their associated loading rates cannot yet be determined for the URG from geodetic measurements, AÂ is assumed to be homogeneous along-strike for each fault, while we consider it possible for the seismogenic width to change from one fault to another. The rate at which slip deficit builds up,Â DËdef , is evaluated based on neotectonic information (see Sect.Â 3.1). The total moment released, mË0Total ,Â is calculated based on the rate of moment release of the long-term seismicity model. Since the long-term seismicity model only considers mainshocks, we included a fourth parameter,Â Î±s, that represents the proportion of moment released by background seismicity (Avouac, 2015),Â m0Bckgrd , relative to the total moment released (including aftershocks and aseismic afterslip). If mË0def=mË0Total=mË0Bckgrd/Î±s , then the moment budget is said to be balanced.\n\nThe cumulative MFDs for tapered and truncated seismicity models achieving a balanced moment budget have an analytical form and are a function ofÂ Mmax, b, mË0def andÂ Î±s (see Rollins and Avouac, 2019, and references therein). We can therefore estimate the probability of a seismicity model balancing the moment budget,Â PBudget, by sampling the aÂ priori distributions of those parameters.\n\n2.2âMomentâarea scaling law\n\nAccording to global earthquake statistics, the moment released by an earthquake,Â m0seis , is proportional to the area of its rupture,Â Aeq, such that m0seisâAeq3/2 (Wells and Coppersmith, 1994; Leonard, 2010; Stirling et al., 2013). We use this scaling to evaluate whether a seismic event of a given magnitude has a rupture area that fits within the seismogenic zone. By considering the spread of the empirical distribution of magnitude vs. area, we assume the probability distribution function of an event of magnitudeÂ Mw to be probable considering this scaling,Â PScaling. We use here the self-consistent scaling law, and related uncertainties, as defined by LeonardÂ (2010) in the dip-slip equation (the strike-slip equation is in any case almost the same).\n\n2.3âEarthquake catalog\n\nWe test whether the observed MFD from earthquake catalogs may be a sample of the distribution of the long-term seismicity models we are building. Effectively, we evaluate the likelihood of our observed MFD given the distribution of the models. Since we only consider mainshocks, we define the likelihood of the observed seismicity catalog,Â PCat, as PCat=âiPpoissonMi , where PpoissonMi Â is the probability of observing nobsMi Â events within the magnitude binÂ Mi that occur during the time periodÂ tobsMi , assuming the long-term mean recurrence of events isÂ ÏmodelMi :\n\n(1) P poisson M i n obs M i , t obs M i , Ï model M i = t obs M i / Ï model M i n obs M i n obs M i ! e - t obs M i / Ï model M i .\n\nEffectively, for a given seismicity model, we randomly generate 2500Â declustered earthquake catalogs. We evaluate the likelihood of each catalog and defineÂ PCat as the average of these likelihood values.\n\nNote that we follow the recommendation by FelzerÂ (2008) while exploring magnitude uncertainties and correct the magnitudes of each event by ÎM=(b2Ï2)/(2log10(e)) , where bÂ is the declustered catalog bÂ value, ÏÂ is the standard deviation for the event's magnitude and eÂ is the exponential constant.\n\n2.4âSeismicity model probability and marginal probabilities\n\nFinally, the probability of a seismicity model is defined as PSM=PBudgetPCatPScaling, which depends, among others, onÂ Mmax andÂ b (Michel et al., 2021). The evaluation of the parameters to estimateÂ PSM is discussed in Sect.Â 3. Marginal probabilities such asÂ PMmax , the probability ofÂ Mmax, andÂ Pb, the probability of the bÂ value, can be estimated based onÂ PSM. We also define P(Ïmax|Mmax) as the probability of the rate ofÂ Mmax, andÂ P(Ï|Mw) as the probability of the rate of events with magnitudeÂ Mw, which accounts for all earthquakes from all of the models (i.e.,Â not onlyÂ Mmax). Probabilities needed for estimating seismic hazard (e.g.,Â PSHA) such as the probability of having an event above magnitudeÂ Mw for a time periodÂ T, P(M>Mw|T), can likewise be evaluated.\n\nWe present in this section the data and their associated uncertainties used to evaluate each constraint. Hereafter, the UÂ and NÂ symbols will stand for uniform and normal distribution, respectively. TableÂ 1 summarizes the uncertainties taken for each parameter.\n\n3.1âNeotectonic data, seismogenic along-dip width and moment deficit rate\n\nIn order to evaluate the MDR for the moment budget constraint (Sect.Â 2.1), we must infer estimates of the loading rate (i.e.,Â DËdef ) for each fault taken into account. The slip rate on each fault is taken from NiviÃ¨re et al.Â (2008) for the Rhine River, Black Forest, Weinstetten and Lehen-SchÃ¶nberg faults (the Landeck and West Renish faults are not considered). Their slip rates rely on estimates of the cumulative vertical displacement of the faults based on PlioceneâQuaternary sediments thickness variations measured from 451Â boreholes, assuming that the accommodation space opened by tectonic motion is completely balanced (or over-balanced) by sedimentation. However, potential erosional periods due to the piracy of the Rhine River might bias the measurements; thus the values are to be interpreted as maximum displacement estimates. NiviÃ¨re et al.Â (2008) inferred vertical slip rates of 0.07Â and 0.17âmmâyrâ1 from the age of the sediments for the Rhine River and Weinstetten faults, respectively. The Lehen-SchÃ¶nberg Fault slip rate reaches between 0.04Â and 0.1âmmâyrâ1. While borehole observations do not allow us to conclude on the PlioceneâQuaternary slip rate of the Black Forest Fault, this structure is suggested to be inactive during this time period, and the deformation is now accommodated by the other aforementioned faults (NiviÃ¨re et al., 2008). Note that these are vertical slip rate estimates and the along-strike component is for the moment neglected. For the moment rate calculation, we project vertical slip rates on the along-dip direction considering the dip angles of each fault.\n\nThe seismogenic down-dip extent of a fault depends on the temperature gradient (e.g.,Â Oleskevich et al., 1999), among other parameters. Indeed, between the isotherms 350Â and 450ââC, quartzo-feldspathic rocks undergo a transition in frictional properties (Blanpied et al., 1995) from a rate-weakening (<350ââC), potentially seismogenic behavior to a rate-strengthening (>450ââC), stable sliding behavior (Dieterich, 1979; Ruina, 1983). The geothermal gradient below the URG is higher than in the surrounding regions due to its tectonic history (Freymark et al., 2017). Based on borehole temperature measurements from Guillou-Frottier et al.Â (2013), we estimate the envelopes of the geothermal gradient in the southern URG (Fig.Â S2), assuming a linear temperature gradient with depth, and show that the frictional property transition would occur between depths of 6âkm (shallowest position of the 350ââC isotherm; Fig.Â S2) and 18âkm (deepest position of the 450ââC isotherm; Fig.Â S2). In this study, we define the PDF of the seismogenic down-dip extent as a uniform distribution between 0Â and 6âkm depth associated with a linear taper down to 18âkm. The linearity of the taper implies that the position of the fault's transition to a fully rate-strengthening behavior (>350â450ââC) has a uniform probability of falling between 6âkm (shallowest position of the 350ââC isotherm according to Fig.Â S2) and 18âkm depth (deepest position of the 450ââC isotherm; Fig.Â S2), i.e.,Â rateâââstrengthening transitionâââU(6,Â 18)âkm.\n\nAdditionally, the southern part of the URG is the site of a potash-salt evaporitic basin (Lutz and Cleintuar, 1999; Hinsken et al., 2007; Freymark et al., 2017), which reaches a maximum depth of â¼2âkm. Such formations may not accumulate any moment deficit as the yield stress of evaporites is very low (Carter and Hansen, 1983). We assume that each fault is potentially impacted by this formation, hence modulating the seismogenic thickness and in turn the seismogenic area available for a rupture. The resulting PDF for the seismogenic thickness is the convolution of the PDF of the down-dip extent of the seismogenic zone with the PDF of the evaporitic basin thickness taken as U(0,Â 2)âkm. Combining both temperature and salt basin assumptions leads to a PDF of the along-dip seismogenic width, which is uniform down to â¼5âkm and decreases linearly until â¼17âkm (Figs.Â S3âS6).\n\nThe moment deficit is then the product of the length of each fault, their seismogenic width, the neotectonic long-term slip rate and the shear modulus that we fix to 30âGPa (same as in Chartier et al., 2017). Each fault is assumed to have its own seismogenic width. The moment deficit rate of each fault is shown in Fig.Â 1. The PDFs for each of the fault's constitutive parameters are shown in Figs.Â S3âS6. By considering the range of the fault's geometrical parameters, which also considers the Black Forest Fault even though it is assumed to be non-active, we obtain the momentâarea constraint shown in Fig.Â 2. Events of up to Mwâ6.5 are equiprobable, while those above Mwâ7.7 are extremely improbable.\n\n3.2âInstrumental and historical seismicity catalogs\n\nTo constrain the MFD of the long-term seismicity models with an observational seismicity catalog, as described in Sect.Â 2.3, we need to evaluate from the observational catalog the number of events per magnitude binÂ nobsMi over a period of timeÂ tobsMi (Sect.Â 2.3). We use the earthquake catalog from Drouet et al.Â (2020). This catalog was built from multiple former catalogs. It relies mostly on the FCAT-17 catalog (Manchuel et al., 2018), which is itself a combination of the instrumental catalog SiHex (SIsmicitÃ© de l'HEXagone; Cara et al., 2015) for the 1965â2009 period and a historical catalog based on the macroseismic database of SisFranceÂ (BRGM, IRSN, EDF), intensity prediction equations from Baumont et al.Â (2018) and the macroseismic moment magnitude determination from Traversa et al.Â (2018) for the 463â1965 period. Events located more than 20âkm from the French border, not provided by FCAT-17, are based on the SHEEC catalog (Stucchi et al., 2013; Woessner et al., 2015). Finally, events between 2010 and 2016 come from the CEA-LDG bulletins (https://www-dase.cea.fr, last access: 19Â JanuaryÂ 2024). All event magnitudes are given inÂ Mw, and uncertainties are provided. Anthropic events are expected to have already been removed from the catalog (Cara et al., 2015; Manchuel et al., 2018).\n\nWe select events within the coordinates [47,Â 49.5â] latitude and [6,Â 8.5â] longitude, i.e.,Â a broad region covering the whole URG, and divide the catalog into two time periods, an instrumental period and a historical one taking events from 1980 onwards and 1850 onwards, respectively. We decluster both catalogs to compare them with the long-term seismicity models (Sect.Â 2.3). Declustering is based on the methodology of Marsan et al.Â (2017), which evaluates the probability that an earthquake is a mainshock. Declustering is applied based on a completeness magnitude,Â Mc, of 2.2Â and 3.2Â for the instrumental and historical catalogs, respectively (Sect.Â S1 in the Supplement; Figs.Â S7 andÂ S8). From the resulting catalogs, we keep events from 1994 onwards and 1860 onwards for the instrumental and historical catalogs, respectively (Figs.Â S7 andÂ S8), in order to avoid border effects from declustering. For the instrumental catalog, 1994 is also the date from which the seismicity rate appears relatively constant (Fig.Â S7). We then select events in the region of interest (i.e.,Â the southern part of the URG), taking into account only earthquakes located within a 10âkm buffer around the faults considered, including the Black Forest Fault (Fig.Â 3). Note that since no events belowÂ Mc are considered, there is a lack of events which fall in the magnitude bins directly aboveÂ Mc while exploring magnitude uncertainties. Thus, when applying the earthquake catalog constraint (Sect.Â 2.3), we take events with Mwâ¥2.8 and Mwâ¥4.3 for the instrumental and historical catalogs, respectively (Felzer, 2008) (Fig.Â 3).\n\n3.3âConstitutive parameters of seismicity models\n\nAs mentioned in Sect.Â 2.1, the cumulative MFD for tapered and truncated seismicity models balancing the moment budget can be defined as a function ofÂ Mmax, b, mË0def andÂ Î±s. We explore these parameters using a grid search withÂ Mmax and bÂ sampled uniformly over MmaxâU(4.5,9.9) and bâU(0.1,1.45) , respectively. Based on global statistics of the post-seismic response following earthquakes (Alwahedi and Hawthorne, 2019; Churchill et al., 2022), we assume that the PDF ofÂ Î±s is a Gaussian distribution with N(0.9,Â 0.25) (Fig.Â S9). Finally, the PDF of the MDR for each fault is assumed to be uniform betweenÂ 0 and the estimate based on the maximum slip rate from NiviÃ¨re et al.Â (2008) (Sect.Â 3.1). We thus include scenarios for which almost no moment deficit accumulates on the fault (i.e.,Â the fault slips aseismically or accumulates no strain over long periods of time). This assumption contrasts with the choice made by Chartier et al.Â (2017), who assume that each fault is fully locked over a seismogenic width terminating at either 15 or 20âkm. In doing so, we explore a broad range of possible models.\n\nThe combination of constraints (Sect.Â 2) leads to the results shown in Fig.Â 4. For the truncated model, the marginal probability ofÂ PSM in the MmaxÂ and ÏmaxÂ space is represented by the gray-shaded distribution in Fig.Â 4 (not shown for the tapered model since the models taper atÂ Mmax). The marginal probability of MmaxÂ for the tapered model (in green) peaks atÂ 6.1, while the one for the truncated model (in blue) is bi-modal with peaks atÂ 5.2 andÂ 5.8. For the truncated model (not the tapered model for the same reason as previously indicated), the marginal probability P(Ïmax|Mmax=5.8) (solid blue line on the yÂ axis) peaks at â¼1000Â years. Taking Mmax=6.6 orÂ 7.0, a number close to the estimated magnitude of the 1356 Basel earthquake, the marginal probability would instead peak at â¼16â000Â and â¼80â000Â years, respectively.\n\nThe marginal probabilities P(Ï|Mw=6.1) and P(Ï|Mw=5.8) for the tapered and truncated models (dotted green and blue lines, respectively, on the yÂ axis), which take all events from the seismicity models into account (not onlyÂ Mmax), have instead peaks at â¼16â000Â and â¼10â000Â years, respectively. The marginal probabilityÂ Pb peaks atÂ â¼0.85 and 0.9Â for the tapered and truncated models, respectively.\n\nThe effect with and without the momentâarea scaling law is shown in Fig.Â 5. Adding the scaling law constraint does not change the mode ofÂ PMmax but completely rejects scenarios with Mmax>7.8.\n\nFinally, the probabilities P(M>Mw|T) for T=100 and 10â000Â years are also shown in Fig.Â 5. As an example, the probability of occurrence for an event above Mwâ6.5 (similar to the 1356Â Basel earthquake) for an observational period of 100Â years is â¼0.1â% for both the tapered and the truncated models. For an event above Mwâ6.0 and for the same period, this probability is instead â¼1â% for both models (see zoomed-in inset in Fig.Â 5c).\n\nThe correlations betweenÂ Mmax, the moment deficit rate, the bÂ value andÂ Î±s, for both the tapered and the truncated models but without the scaling law constraint, are shown in Figs.Â S10 andÂ S11. For both models, probable MmaxÂ increases with an increasing bÂ value (Figs.Â S10a andÂ S11a), highlighting strong interdependency between the two parameters. Raising the moment deficit rate will control the minimum probableÂ Mmax (Figs.Â S10b andÂ S11b) but will also tend to exclude scenarios with a high bÂ valueÂ (>1.25; Figs.Â S10f andÂ S11f). While other trends are expected between parameters, they seem less visible likely due to the uncertainties in the parameters explored, and we thus do not pursue further analysis between those parameters.\n\nThe results if we combine the PDFs from the tapered and truncated models using a mixture distribution are shown in Fig.Â S12. PMmax has a main peak atÂ 5.9 and a smaller peak atÂ 5.2, which originates from the truncated model. P(Ï|Mw=5.9) peaks instead at â¼13â000Â years.\n\n5.1âSensibility to earthquake catalog declustering\n\nThe catalog declustering (i.e.,Â removal of aftershocks) may have a significant impact on the results (Sect.Â 2.3), influencing the shape of the observed MFD of earthquakes. In this study, we applied the methodology of Marsan et al.Â (2017), which is based on the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) framework and intrinsically assumes that background events have Poisson behavior. Other declustering methodologies are available, and here we test the one from Zaliapin and Ben-ZionÂ (2013) based on the nearest-neighbor distances of events in the spaceâtimeâenergy domain. The results from this methodology produce background seismicity catalogs with more events than the one from Marsan et al.Â (2017) (Sect.Â S2 and Figs.Â S13âS15) but imply larger bÂ values when combining the instrumental catalog with the historical one (as inferred by Fig.Â 6b). The analysis of the seismogenic potential of the URG using the Zaliapin and Ben-ZionÂ (2013) methodology results inÂ PMmax peaking at M6.3 for the tapered model and is still bi-modal for the truncated model, with peaks at M5.2 and M5.9 (Fig.Â 6). Unlike with Marsan et al.Â (2017), the peak at lower magnitude for the truncated model is more probable than the one at larger magnitude. The most probableÂ Mmax for both models are slightly shifted to lower magnitudes than the values estimated using the Marsan et al.Â (2017) methodology, but the width of the PDFs appears unchanged to first order. The resulting marginal probabilities P(Ï|Mw=5.9) and P(Ï|Mw=5.8) for the tapered and truncated models both peak at â¼8000Â years.\n\n5.2âSource of seismicity\n\nWe initially selected earthquakes within a 10âkm buffer zone around the faults to reflect the spatial strain pattern of a vertical fault blocked down to a depth of 10âkm. Nevertheless, the locking depth could potentially be deeper, down to â¼18âkm as suggested in Sect.Â 3.1. In this respect, we also provide results if events are selected within 20âkm of the faults (Figs.Â S16 andÂ S17). Under these conditions, the seismicity rates of the observational earthquake catalogs are higher and constrain the long-term seismicity models to cases that produce a higher moment release rate. PMmax Â thus favors events with a lower magnitude than the one using events within 10âkm (Fig.Â 5; Sect.Â 4). The tapered model peaks at Mwâ5.9, instead ofÂ 6.1, while the truncated model peaks twice at Mwâ5.2 andÂ 5.8, in a similar manner to the reference scenario in Sect.Â 4, except that the peak at Mwâ5.2 is now the most probable.\n\nHowever, current seismicity in the URG is seemingly diffuse and it is difficult to associate it with a fault in particular (Doubre et al., 2022). On the other hand, geodetic data are not yet able to resolve any tectonic deformation and thus to evaluate the loading rate of faults (Henrion et al., 2020). Even though the Drouet et al.Â (2020) catalog, based on the FCAT-17 catalog, is supposedly devoid of anthropic seismicity (Cara et al., 2015; Manchuel et al., 2018), one can then ask whether the current seismicity is totally representative of the undergoing long-term tectonic processes or presently modulated by surface loads such as the post-glacial rebound (e.g.,Â Craig et al., 2016), aquifer loads, erosion or incision (e.g.,Â Bettinelli et al., 2008; Steer et al., 2014; Craig et al., 2017). If so, the assumption that the main driver of seismicity is tectonic loading breaks down and our method used to assess seismic hazard must be completed by physics-based constraints of such transient stress release (Calais et al., 2016). Distinguishing seismic sources triggered by tectonic loading from other driven forces is an extremely difficult task. The earthquake catalog contribution (Sect.Â 2.3) might then not be appropriate.\n\nAdditionally, the magnitudes of historical events from the FCAT-17 catalog (before the 1960s), and thus the ones from Drouet et al.Â (2020), seem to be overestimated (or the instrumental events have underestimated magnitudes even though this seems less probable), and a bias in the MFD is thus expected (Beauval and Bard, 2022; Doubre et al., 2022). For the URG case, three bins out of seven of the observed MFD are estimated from the instrumental period. The bins estimated from the historical period have thus slightly more weight in the catalog constraint (Sect.Â 2.3).\n\nWe test an alternative constraint inferring that the possible magnitude and frequency ofÂ Mmax must be consistent with the largest observed event over the observation period (â¼146Â years), meaning that it has to be larger than or equal to the largest known event while the return period of the largest event cannot be significantly shorter than the observation period (ApproachÂ 2 from Michel et al., 2018). This constraint is equivalent to considering that no earthquakes with a magnitude greater than the largest event in the observation period occurred during the time period covered by the observed catalog. Theoretically, this constraint imposes a lower bound onÂ Mmax and its recurrence time. The results obtained using this constraint together with the moment budget and scaling law ones are shown in Fig.Â 7. Since Mmax frequency differs for the tapered and truncated models, the new constraint imposes different lower bounds for the two models. The truncated model rejects scenarios with MmaxÂ below Mwâ5.5 more strongly. PbÂ is not constrained by the observed seismicity catalog, but higher values of the bÂ value seem slightly more probable (inset in Fig.Â 7). The marginal probabilities P(Ï|Mw=5.9) and P(Ï|Mw=6.3) for the tapered and truncated models have peaks at â¼12â500Â and â¼63â000Â years, respectively.\n\n5.3âStrike-slip component\n\nIn this study, as well as in Chartier et al.Â (2017), we assume solely along-dip displacement since it is the only published neotectonic information available. Nevertheless, recent paleoseismological data on the Black Forest Fault near Karlsruhe (north of our study area) suggest 5.9âm of cumulative strike-slip faulting, in contrast to 1.2âm of cumulative vertical slip, over the last 5.9âkyr (Pena-Castellnou et al., 2023). Those displacements seem to be associated with at least three paleo-earthquakes. This suggests (1)Â that the Black Forest Fault has been active during the Quaternary period and (2)Â that strike-slip faulting might be predominant. The ratio between strike- and dip-slip faulting from the Black Forest event would be then equal toÂ 4.8. We thus test a scenario where the Black Forest Fault is associated with a maximum vertical slip deficit rate of 0.18âmmâyrâ1, as proposed by Jomard et al.Â (2017), where we multiply the maximum slip deficit rate of all faults considered byÂ 4.8. The results and the revised MDR for each fault are shown in Figs.Â 8 andÂ S18. PMmax Â peaks at Mwâ6.8 and Mwâ6.6 for the tapered and truncated models, respectively. They are associated with the marginal probabilities P(Ï|Mw=6.8) and P(Ï|Mw=6.6) that both peak at â¼16â000Â years for the tapered and truncated models. Note that Pena-Castellnou et al.Â (2023) suggest that earthquakes of potentially Mwâ6.5 occurred north of our study area. PbÂ peaks atÂ 0.7 for both the tapered and the truncated models, thus at lower values than taking into account the vertical slip component alone.\n\nThe previous scenario tested (Fig.Â 8) takes two more faults (i.e.,Â Weinstetten and Lehen-SchÃ¶nberg faults) into account than in Chartier et al.Â (2017), as these two faults are not present within the BDFA (the French database of potentially active faults; Jomard et al., 2017). The results obtained by selecting faults as defined by Chartier et al.Â (2017) and applying the strike-slip assumption are provided in Fig.Â S19. PMmax Â peaks at Mwâ6.7 and Mwâ6.6 for the tapered and truncated models, respectively, which is very similar to the scenario taking all four faults, as the moment deficit rate is dominated by the Rhine River and Black Forest faults. Note that the marginal probabilities P(Ï|Mw) and P(Ïmax|Mmax) seem to get more noisy, likely due to the shape of the MDR PDF, which skews heavily towards zero (black line in Fig.Â S18e).\n\n5.4âMulti-segment rupture\n\nIn this study we assume that all faults can rupture simultaneously. Nevertheless, the Black Forest Fault is initially taken as inactive, and the traces of the Weinstetten and Lehen-SchÃ¶nberg faults are separated by at least 7.9âkm. According to WesnouskyÂ (2006), multi-segment ruptures are associated with low probability when the inter-segment distance exceeds 5âkm. Consequently, the seismogenic potential scenario from Sect.Â 4 would be an overestimation. On the other hand, according to Pena-Castellnou et al.Â (2023), the Black Forest Fault is in fact active and seismogenic and could be assumed to rupture with other faults. Additional structures might actually link all the faults together (e.g.,Â Lutz and Cleintuar, 1999; Bertrand et al., 2006; Rotstein and Schaming, 2011). In this case, the seismogenic potential scenario from Sect.Â 4 would be interpreted as an underestimation.\n\nFinally, we only consider the faults within a finite zone, which controls the total seismogenic area of the faults (i.e.,Â the momentâarea scaling law effect), whereas the faults continue northwards and southwards to a lesser extent. According to Weng and YangÂ (2017), the aspect ratio (width-to-length ratio of a rupture) of dip-slip events barely reaches beyondÂ 8. Taking a seismogenic width of 18âkm (our maximum estimate), the maximum length of earthquakes would then be 144âkm, while the full length of the URG faults considered, including the Black Forest Fault, is â¼250âkm (â¼160âkm if the Black Forest Fault is not included). The rupture of all the faults would then be unlikely. On the other hand, strike-slip events do not seem to be capped by any aspect ratio (Weng and Yang, 2017), so Mw>7.5 events cannot be excluded in this context.\n\nIn this study, we investigate the seismogenic potential of the southeastern URG, building on the work by Chartier et al.Â (2017). Based on a complex fault network (NiviÃ¨re et al., 2008), we evaluate scenarios that have not been accounted for previously, exploring uncertainties inÂ Mmax, its recurrence time, the bÂ value, and the moment released aseismically or through aftershocks (see TableÂ 2 for a summary of the results considering the different scenarios). Uncertainties for the MDR, the observed MFD and the momentâarea scaling law are also explored. Given the four faults considered, and the scenario in which the Black Forest Fault is no longer active but where the other faults can still rupture simultaneously, the MmaxÂ maximum probability is estimated at Mwâ6.1 and Mwâ5.8 using the tapered and the truncated seismicity models, respectively. Nevertheless, PMmax Â for the truncated model has a second peak at Mwâ5.2 and the recurrence time of events of such magnitude (not onlyÂ Mmax), P(Ï|Mw=5.2)â¼2000 Â years, is much shorter than the one estimated using the main peak, P(Ï|Mw=5.8)â¼10000 Â years. Again considering the scenario excluding the Black Forest Fault, there is a 99â% probability that MmaxÂ is less thanÂ 7.3 using either the tapered or the truncated models. In contrast, when strike-slip kinematics are considered as described in Sect.Â 5.3 and the Black Forest Fault is takenÂ into account, there is a 99â% probability that MmaxÂ is less thanÂ 7.6 andÂ 7.5 for the tapered and truncated models, respectively. This is our preferred scenario as it is based on recent findings for strike-slip mechanisms, although the assumptions made in this analysis are debatable (i.e.,Â strike-slipâ/ âdip-slip ratio evaluated on a fault just north of our zone of study and applied to all faults; Sect.Â 5.3). ItÂ shouldÂ be noted thatÂ seismic hazard studies often placeÂ an upper bound on the values ofÂ Mmax considered. In the case of the URG, studies that use varying approaches to ours have yielded values comparable to, or marginally lower than, the 99thÂ percentile ofÂ PMmax of our strike-slip scenario (e.g.,Â M7.4, M7.1Â and M7.5Â for GrÃºnthal et al., 2018; Drouet et al., 2020; and Danciu et al., 2021, respectively).\n\nIn any case, within this study, strong assumptions still had to be made that certainly affected the results. These include the methodology used to decluster the earthquake catalogs, determining whether it is wise to compare the loading rate of each fault with seismicity, opting to only consider the dip-slip component despite the fact that strike-slip is highly probable, covering the possibility of multi-segment ruptures and even the choice of the faults to be considered. Further work, from paleoseismology, seismic reflection, geodesy or earthquake relocation, is needed to obtain more information on the structures tectonically involved and their associated loading rates and to better constrain the URG seismic hazard.\n\nAlwahedi, M.
