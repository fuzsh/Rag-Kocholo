        "text": "This week, our sales teams from 6 Asian Business Units specializing in hazardous waste treatment and plastic recycling embarked on an exciting 5-day journey of learning, growth, and empowerment as they gathered in Wuxi and Shanghai for intensive training at the #SalesAcademy organized by Veolia Asia. üöÄ The training, was designed to enhance our sales skills and provide our teams with valuable insights, tools, and strategies to better understand customer needs, challenge the status quo when necessary, and deliver compelling messages. The participants actively engaged throughout the sessions, and their positive feedback affirmed the program's success. üëè On the final day, our teams showcased their learnings in a panel presentation to VIPs including procurement, supply chain, and proposals directors. Their valuable insights further enriched the training experience, fostering a collaborative environment for continuous improvements. üèÜ A special shoutout to our colleagues at VWTS, who not only sent two trainees to join the bootcamp but also hosted us at their top-class water technologies factory in Wuxi. On top of that, we were truly inspired by Tim Huang¬¥s keynote presentation, which added an extra layer of expertise to our learning experience. üôå This Sales Academy training, led by the exceptional Diliana Karailieva and Arthur Choukroun who brought invaluable expertise and contagious energy, was a testament to our commitment to continuous learning and professional development. We are confident that our sales teams will leverage the acquired knowledge and skills from these amazing trainers to drive better deals and foster stronger customer relationships. üí∞ As we move forward, we look forward to witnessing the positive impact of this training on our transactional sales performance and growth in the Asian market. üåü #SalesAcademy #PlastiLoop Laurent Bickert Jeffrey YAU Tim Huang Wu Min Christophe M.\n\nWelcoming Circular PET Tsuyama Plant of Veolia Japan to the PlastiLoop, a global network of over 40 Veolia plastic recycling facilities worldwide! üåøüåç PET bottles with caps or labels left on or leftover drinks have been considered difficult for bottle-to-bottle recycling in Japan. Using Veolia‚Äôs experience and know-how, the Circular PET facility can effectively recycle such material and produce new food-grade PET bottles. Circular PET can produce 25,000 tons of food-grade recycled PET resin annually, reducing 27,500 tons of CO2 emission and meeting brand owners‚Äô increasing demand. Join us in celebrating this inauguration of Circular PET, and thank you to everyone, especially VEOLIA SOUTH EAST ASIA, who shared their know-how in plastic recycling and contributed to the facility's design! Veolia Japan #rPET #PlastiLoop Guillaume Dourdin\n\nAquaculture is the fastest-growing food industry, thanks to the increased consumption of aquatic food. To guarantee stable and sustainable production, healthy gut health is a must for all fish and shrimp in order to achieve and retain optimal health and growth. To prove this, Veolia and University Kasetsart, Thailand conducted a study to show how Entomeal and Entolipid, insect-based functional ingredients, can improve gut health, growth performance, and survival rate for different aquatic species.

Our team recently attended a 2-day GMP+ and ISO 22000:2018 training, reaffirming our commitment to upholding the highest standards in the industry. Earlier this year, Veolia Bioconversion Malaysia was officially certified as GMP+ and ISO 22000:2018 compliant. This training not only equipped our new hires with the importance of adhering to stringent GMP+ and ISO standards but also served as a valuable refresher for all existing staff. What does this certification mean for our valued customers? Rest assured, all our EntomealTM & Entolipid productions are now fully compliant with the strict EU requirements, ensuring the utmost quality and feed safety. From the moment raw materials enter our process until the final product reaches our customers, traceability remains our priority.
