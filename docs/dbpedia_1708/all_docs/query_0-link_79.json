It analyzes the dynamics underlying violence and its use as a mode of governance by state and non-state actors.

The solution to put an end to armed violence should not only be provided by the international commitment as by the United Nations or by multilateral organizations such as the European Union or African Union security policies, but also by promoting criminal justice against predators who abuse their positions in political competition while manipulating ethnic sensitivities and favoring the strategy of violence in order to gain access to natural resources and stay in power.</p>",

        "text": "2.1.1 Political instability: The rise of dinosaur’s dictatorship\n\n2.1.1.1 The chaos of independence\n\nFew months up to independence, the Congolese elected a President, Joseph Kasavubu, a prime minister, Patrice Lumumba, a senate and assembly, and similar bodies in the Congo’s numerous provinces. The Eisenhower administration had high hopes that the Republic of the Congo would form a stable, pro-Western, and central government. But those hopes vanished as the newly independent State descended into chaos and violence [9]. At that time, the Cold War was shaping geostrategic policies around the world.\n\nIn fact, disagreements appeared on how to administer this country: Moïse Tshombé and Joseph Kasa-Vubu argued for a federal state that leaves great power to the regions. Patrice Lumumba (unionist) defends a strong central state and, in fact, diminishes the influence of the territories outside the capital. From July 1960 to January 1961, the newly independent state plunged into chaos and violence as Congolese soldiers demanded a pay rise against a backdrop of conflict between the country’s leading figures: President Kasa-Vubu and Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba [9].\n\nDuring the same period, ideological divisions materialized on the ground. Katanga, a rich mining province in the south of the country represented by Moïse Tshombe, seceded and declared its independence from the Congo, followed by Albert Kalonji, the president of the Movement National Congolais (MNC)-Kalonji, removed from the central government, who proclaims the secession of the State of South Kasai [9]. And Lumumba’s death on January 17, 1961, did not put an end to political rivalries. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Defense supports the Congolese National Army-Armée Nationale Congolaise (CAN-ANC) through the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), to oppose Lumumba’s supporters (allegedly supported by neighboring African nations, the Soviet bloc and Chinese Communists) insurgency against the central government in Kinshasa threatened national unity by taking Stanleyville (Kisangani), the largest city in eastern Congo on August 4, 1964 [9].\n\nFrom these events, the Congolese post-independence crisis’s causes can be summarized as follows: the inexperience of the political leaders of the time (mismanagement of defeat and success, which continues to this day); Unpreparedness for independence, lack of initiation into the exercise of power, and the management of public affairs; The greed of foreign powers to recover lost ground; Lack of nationalism and jealousy among politicians; Tribalism and the sacrifice of competence.\n\nWhat’s more, the race for power will overshadow the resolution of serious issues such as the inter-ethnic struggles in Kivu, where the nationality of the so-called “Banyarwanda” populations and refugees from Rwanda were already paving the way for future crises.\n\nThis situation led to a coup d’état by the military high command on 24 November 1965, which gave power to J.D. Mobutu for five years.\n\n2.1.1.2 President Mobutu’s power personalized for the benefit of his clients\n\nWhen he came to power in 1965, General Mobutu took the reins of power in a country divided by political and even ethnic violent confrontations consecrated by political actors. Mobutu highly centralized the Congolese state in the image of the colonial administration, governing by decree. His absolute power had been ratified by the 24th of June 1967. Constitution which made him the head of three powers: executive, legislative, and judicial [10].\n\nThe arrival of General Mobutu at the head of Congo-Zaïre put an end to the post-independence violence. Nonetheless, the use of armed violence by public authorities, and even by the President himself through his security services, has often been recognized as a legitimate means of maintaining order and political power.\n\nIn fact, from 1965 onwards, the Congolese population celebrated a period free of war and armed violence. This means that the use of weapons was reserved solely for the security forces and the army, thus formalizing the principle of the legitimacy of violence proper to public authorities [11].\n\nAlso, Administrative institutions under Marechal Mobutu, as in the colonial period, were highly centralized. All the central authorities (with the exception of the Governor General) lived in Brussels and ran the Belgian Congo from there. Professor LOHATA TAMBWE asserts that these colonial administrative institutions influenced the administrative structures of the Second Republic, and we add that the effects are still visible today, 22 years after the fall of Marechal Mobutu’s regime [12].\n\nIn order to consolidate his power, the use of armed violence by the security services has therefore become a tool for intimidating and even eliminating political opponents, despite the authorization to resume political life.\n\nIndeed, the 1967 Constitution determines that no more than two political parties may be created in the Republic [13] (Article 4). In accordance with this constitutional provision, President Mobutu created the M.P.R. on 20 May 1967 on behalf of the government. He thus declared himself in favor of the creation of an opposition political party but, he said, “the second opposition party must be the movement of those who do not share our way of conceiving things (…), the party of those who have another program opposed to ours” [14].\n\nFurthermore, political power based on violence was reinforced by a clientelist system that willingly used the violence of army and security force structures to perpetuate the holding of power [15].\n\nAccording to Jean Claude Willame, this clientelist system is organized as a pyramid. “The different levels of this pyramid do not necessarily coincide with institutions based on a shifting, fluid reality. The MPR, the ministerial departments and the administration are merely labels concealing much more subtle hierarchies [16].\n\nAt the head of this patrimonial structure, there is a presidential clan made up of leading men who often belong to the same region, Equatorial Province. Attached to this clan are a number of major international “adventurers” who play a more or less permanent role as “advisors” to the president (he cites the American Mr. Tempelsman and the Frenchman de la Tribouille, etc.) [16].\n\nBelow them, a host of businessmen, administrators, and courtiers who owe their privileges to their ethnic or regional affiliation, or to “faits du prince.” [15].\n\nAt the bottom of the power pyramid, there is a sizeable mass of elites who form the power’s “recruitment pool” - senior civil servants, intellectuals, state or people’s commissioners, etc. - and who can overnight be the subject of a major scandal. - They can be promoted to high office overnight, or just as suddenly dismissed, beaten, tortured, or imprisoned [15].\n\nIn the final analysis, the armed violence of the Mobutu era was more a struggle for power than a civil or inter-ethnic war.\n\n“It is within this layer that there are signs of discontent, of a desire to revolt, as witnessed by the case of the thirteen Kasai deputies, representatives of regional groups politically (but not necessarily economically) outnumbered by the dominant ethnic group of the presidential clique” [16]. At the beginning of the 90s, the narrow clientelism, strongly limited to the president’s ethnic group and based on plundering, which was really at the heart of the political dynamic, was succeeded by a strategy of resistance on the part of the dictator and his clan to maintain power, despite the wind having changed with the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\nIndeed, the appearance on the world scene of the policy of “Perestroika-Glasnost” (Perestroika means restructuring, while Glasnost means transparency) [17]. In this new international order, it is problematic that a dictatorship as obscurantist as it is bloodthirsty can remain in the heart of Africa.\n\nThe eminent Congolese history professor notes that “in Zaire’s past, change has almost always been accompanied by a climate in which state violence, following in the footsteps of popular violence, has often metamorphosed into armed violence” [15, 18].\n\n2.1.2 Institutional instability: The rationality of the dinosaur’s resistance (transition period from 1990 to 1997)\n\nFollowing the rapid pace of change in the international environment, and the extent of the deterioration in the country’s social, political, economic, and security situation, on January 22, 1990, the President announced the organization of popular consultations and created the National Office of Popular Consultations, headed by Mr. Mukolo wa Mpombo. This change was enshrined in the President’s speech, delivered on April 24 1990 at the Party headquarters in N’Sele to a large gathering of delegates from the country’s various political forces.\n\nThus began a new page in our country’s political history, with the reintroduction of a multiparty political system and, later, with the convening on August 7, 1991, of a National Sovereign Conference (CNS) bringing together all the country’s leaders to prepare a new social project and a new Constitution.\n\nThe 1991–1992s period recalled the Congo of 1960: “a tragi-comedy played out by actors politically monopolized by the struggle for power, the content of which is simply the method of management. The mobilization of internal and external political energies, undoubtedly justified by the current phase of the struggle for democracy, unfortunately evacuates not only reflection and debate on the crisis, but also on the political, economic and social content of democracy. The transition period towards the Third Republic is a kind of crossroads that raises questions about the direction of transition, both in terms of prospects and alternatives.” [19].\n\nDue to the President’s Mobutu resistance against democratization, violence, including armed violence occurred and changed the political and security perspective of the country.\n\n2.1.2.1 The resistance and the fall of the dinosaur (1990-1997)\n\nOn April 24, 1990, President Mobutu put an end to the single party and the Second Republic with many contradictions:\n\nContradiction in two 2 presidential speeches which both spoke on a three-party multiparty system and of an integral multiparty system; Firstly, contradiction between the President and the opposition: Hence the creation of the presidential majority;\n\nSecondly, contradiction between the opposition itself Moderate opposition and radical opposition of Etienne Tshisekedi; Contradiction between ethnic and provincial groups: Therefore, during this period, the crisis had deepened in the country: the destruction of key infrastructures, economic meltdown, the forced deportation of civilians in Katanga, ethnic violence in North Kivu and increased tribalism. Violations of human rights also became commonplace across the entire country [20].\n\nAgainst this backdrop of institutional cacophony, a Christian march was organized by lay Catholics on February 16 and March 1 in the streets of Kinshasa to protest against the stalled work of the CNS. This march was attended by all religious denominations: Catholic, Protestant, Kimbanguist, Muslim, and Orthodox, and shook the whole of Kinshasa. Mobutu’s army reacted vigorously and violently by using arms against the demonstrators. Officially, nine people were killed and 50 wounded. Pressured from within and without, President Mobutu gave in on April 06, 1992, and the CNS resumed its work. With the adoption on July 31, 1992, of the global political compromise and that of August 04, 1992, of the Act on constitutional provisions relating to the transition period, one might have thought that the constitutional situation had been definitively settled [21].\n\nAs a consequence of political instability, violence has gained ground and reached proportions of serious human rights violations and inter-ethnic conflicts including armed attacks.\n\nCompetition for power raised in North-Kiv u province, and had become more intense as the “indigenous” communities had begun to contest the political and land rights of the Banyarwanda more openly. Against the provincial authorities dominated by the Nande and Hunde, some members of the Hutu-Banyarwanda farmers’ mutual association, the MAGRIVI, became more radical and set up small armed groups. At the National Sovereign Conference (CNS), Nande and Hunde delegates pressed for the Banyarwanda not to be allowed to take part in future elections. On the other hand, young indigenous people gathered in tribal self-defense militias (the Ngilima for the Nande and the Mayi-Mayi for the Hunde and Nyanga) tried to counterbalance the militiamen from the MAGRIVI provincial [22].\n\nFrom 1992 onwards, conflicts relating to land ownership and ethno-political murders by guns became more common and every community started to live in fear of attacks by other communities.\n\nIn 1993, Hunde and Nyanga groups in the Walikale territory believed that an attack by the Hutu Banyarwanda was imminent. In March 1993, Governor Jean-Pierre Kalumbo (of Nande origin) called on the FAZ to help the Ngilima and the Nyanga and Hunde militias to “exterminate the Banyarwanda.” On 18 March, Vice-Governor Bamwisho, from the Walikale territory, delivered an inflammatory speech against the Banyarwanda in the village of Ntoto [22].\n\nIt was against this background of crisis that the so-called war of liberation took place, bringing about Mobutu’s downfall and putting an end to the 1st transition.\n\nPreoccupied with their own internal problems, the Zairian political class failed to realize in time that the war that had been raging in Rwanda since 1994 could, at any moment, spill over into the national territory, which had not only served as a retreat for the defeated army of the former Rwandan regime but was also home to numerous Hutu refugee camps protected by France’s Operation Turquoise.\n\nThese Rwandan Hutu refugees, for security reasons, had fled the theater of war, and the spillover of the Rwandan-Burundian war, which was feared, finally came to fruition in October 1966, soon to become the war of liberation.\n\nThere were several reasons for this war, the most prominent of which were:\n\nThe Rwandan government’s intention to challenge the borders between Rwanda and Zaire as historically belonging to them. The Rwandan government called for a new Berlin Conference.\n\nA security problem for Rwanda. The genocidaires who have taken refuge in Zaire and are preparing to destabilize the Rwandan government must be prosecuted [23]. An economic problem behind this lay the United States of America, which was financing the war on the Rwandan side [24].\n\nThus, the armed opposition replaced the unarmed opposition and changed the political landscape of Zaire. The Rwandans capitalized on the Banyamulenge (Zairean Tutsi) revolt to give this war of foreign invasion a Zairean flavor under the label of the Banyamulenge rebellion which claims still fueling the instability and refugee outflows due to changes on nationality issues.\n\nIndeed, ethnic Tutsis and some others of Rwandan origin have contributed to the continued instability and refugee outflows. Changes in the law and in the application thereof related to eligibility for nationality for Rwandophones who moved from Rwanda to DRC between 1930 and 1954 [25]. Related legislation includes the Congolese constitution of 1 August 1964, the subsequent Decree-Law (décret-loi) of 18 September 1965, the Order (ordonnance-loi) No. 71/020 of 26 March 1971, Law No. 72/002 of 5 January 1972, Law No. 81/002 of 29 June 1981, and Law No. 04/024 of 12 November 2004 on Congolese Nationality. Academic and legal experts have been cited as indicating that application of laws even when they may provide for the grant of nationality may be influenced by political bias [25].\n\nA coalition of four politico-military movements was formed on October 18, 1996, in Lemera (South Kivu) under the name of The Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFLC)- Alliance des Forces Démocratiques pour la Libération du Congo-Zaïre, or AFDL for short. ADFLC set itself its objectives: to dismantle fascist rule in the Congo; to establish a democratic regime; and to bring the country back from the brink of war [26].\n\nFinally, Kinshasa fell without a fight on May 17, 1997, just hours after President Mobutu fled the country on May 16, 1997. The transition of Kinshasa to the power of L.D. Kabila thus marked the end of the Mobutu regime and of the first transition, which was the prelude to the advent of actors with heterolytic profiles.\n\n3.1.1 Laurent-Désiré Kabila and his opportunist allies\n\nThe disintegration of the political and socio-economic climate in Mobutu’s Zaire created favorable conditions for the rebellion led by LD Kabila, while at the same time serving as a pretext for Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi to advance security concerns linked to the presence of former Rwandan armed forces on Zairean soil.\n\nAn armed insurgency arose from the South-Kivu province. In addition to Laurent-Désiré Kabila Peoples’ Revolution Party-Parti de la Révolution Populaire (PRP), the ADFLC is composed by the National Council of Resistance for Democracy (CNRD) led by André Kisase Ngandu, the Revolutionary Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MRLZ) led by Anselme Masasu Nindaga, and the Democratic Alliance of the people (ADP) led by Deogratias Bugera [29].\n\nAfter suspending the constitutional provisions, the constitutional act of the transition, he promulgated the decree-law no. 003 of May 28, 1997, on the organization and exercise of power in DRC. Only the ADFLC, was allowed to operate [29].\n\nFrom then on, the ADFLC gradually became a political group around which power was organized. A rift soon developed between the party and the government. Competition between the ADFLC and the government disoriented the public, who saw the spectra of the single party re-emerge [30].\n\nThe ban on political parties further undermined the credibility of the L.D. Kabila regime. The first weeks of the new regime saw the establishment of a monolithic system. Overwhelmed by a fringe group of fighters and opportunists, President L.D. Kabila turned a blind eye to arbitrary arrests and property confiscations.\n\nTo force the new Head of State to democratize his country’s institutions, the United States of America and the European Union made their financial aid conditional on the following requirement: “economic assistance is conditional on economic, political and social reforms.” [31].\n\nAt the same time, President L.D. Kabila adopted a stance that broke with former Zaire’s traditional partners, namely the France-Belgium-United States troika [29], and revived the sulfurous friendships of the maquis years. His first trips as Head of State took him to China, Libya, and Cuba. The issue of the massacres of Hutu refugees and the revelations of human rights violations committed during the war of liberation made M’zee Laurent Désiré Kabila unacceptable in the eyes of international opinion [32].\n\nLaurent-Désiré KABILA and his Rwandan and Ugandan allies entered the war under the pretext of pursuing Rwandan Hutu genocidaires who had found refuge with their “Zairean Hutu brothers,” who were already engaged in inter-ethnic violence at home in Zaire, and who were to serve as fuel for indiscriminate attacks on civilian populations, under the watchful eye of the international community, led by the UN. The international community’s duty was to ensure the maintenance of international peace and security in the region and to protect civilian populations against massive human rights violations. At one point, however, it remained silent in the face of a rather chaotic scene unfolding in Zaire, which became the Democratic Republic of Congo with the second war of 1998, during which more than six states (Zimbabwe, Angola, Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, and Chad) were to wage flagrant war [33].\n\nRelations between the new government and the muzzled internal opposition are not much better. The internal opposition, represented by the UDPS, is calling on the new Head of State to stick to the CNS line and form a broad-based government of national unity [34].\n\nFor L.D. Kabila, “the CNS never had total freedom to decide on the country’s future. Its resolutions were therefore biased and never implemented” [35].\n\nFollowing the decision to send back home the Rwandans, Burundians, and Ugandans who had taken part in the victorious AFDL campaign, the Rwandans, Burundians, and Ugandans joined forces against Kabila to overthrow his regime. Hence the war of “aggression”.\n\n3.1.2 Laurent-Désiré Kabila against his allies\n\nThe divorce between LD Kabila and his allies, who brought him to power after the fall of Mobutu in May 1997, is taking place abruptly and with armed violence. Recourse to arms is the only option chosen by the belligerents. In August 1998, Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda invaded the DRC. Their strategy was to back some rebel groups on one hand, and on another hand, the Congolese government was backed by Zimbabwe, Angola, and Namibia [36].\n\nThe Congolese Government and its allies relied on the support of ex-FAR/Interahamawe (the former Rwandan army and its allied militias that perpetrated the genocide), ADF (the Allied Democratic Front of Uganda), and FDD (Forces for Democracy and Development from Burundi) to slow the advance of its opponents [36].\n\nIn the first place, a politico-military movement: the Rally for Congolese Democracy-Rassemblement congolais pour la Démocratie (RCD)- claims responsibility for this rebellion led by the Banyamulenges, who reproach Kabila for turning a deaf ear to their demands [30]. But there are also Rwanda’s expansionist ambitions and the covetousness of Congolese soil and subsoil riches by the Western powers under cover of Rwanda and Uganda.\n\nIndeed, some authors have argued that the wars in eastern DRC are more the result of a frantic race for the country’s riches than a struggle for democratic change. According to Euloge Boissonnade, in 1996, the Canadian company Barrick Gold (founded in 1981 by Adnan Kashoggi) financed the AFDL offensive, and George BUSH played a major role in this aggression. As a member of the company’s Board of Directors, the former US President was awarded a concession covering several thousand square kilometers that year, including the Kilo-moto gold mines in Orientale province [37].\n\nSurprised by this war, Laurent Désiré Kabila’s regime almost fell, were it not for the energetic intervention of the Angolan and Zimbabwean armies and the violent resistance of the people of Kinshasa.\n\nAt the same time, the rebel coalition is increasingly divided on the tactics to adopt on the ground. A first disagreement arose in November 1998, with the opening of a second rebel front in Equateur province, led by ex-Mobutist Jean Pierre Bemba, head of the Ugandan-backed Mouvement de Libération du Congo (M.L.C.). Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni seems to favor this new faction for one simple reason: its influence over the Goma rebels (RCD) is not as strong as that of the Rwandan army [38].\n\nThanks to these different rebel factions, the Democratic Republic of Congo will be torn into several pieces, and insecurity will be total.\n\nAs a consequence of the two wars (1996–1997 and 1998–2003), the AFDL war gave a new meaning to the violence in the country. Whereas under Mobutu, legitimate violence, including the use of weapons, was the prerogative of the State’s security forces, to preserve the power in place and its system, with the advent of the AFDL, inter-ethnic violence would be exacerbated and the use of all forms of weapons, such as sexual violence and child soldiers, would become a technique of warfare.\n\nUnder pressure from certain powers, the belligerents and their respective allies put away their weapons, leaving it to diplomacy to find a way out of a war deemed too deadly for the Congolese people.\n\nThus, summits were held with the allies of both camps under the cover of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (O.U.A.) (Pretoria Summit of August 23, 1998), Victoria Falls Summit of September 7 to 08 of the Congolese government, the R.C.D., the MLC and all Congolese political and civil organizations to organize an inclusive national dialog aimed at achieving national reconciliation and the establishment of a new political order in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the “Lusaka Agreement for a ceasefire in the Democratic Republic of the Congo” was signed on July 10, 1999 in Lusaka, Zambia [36].\n\nThe Global and Inclusive Agreement of December 17, 2002, signed between the Congolese belligerents, provided for a two-year transition period during which the country would be under collegial leadership for two years, extendable to three, and which was to be used to draw up the fundamental laws, including the new constitution, and stabilize the country by restoring the authority of the State [6].\n\nNorth and South Kivu are not exempt from the influence of neighboring countries such as Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi, given that the capital Kinshasa is located 2000 km away, while the neighboring capitals are around 150 km away in the case of Kigali (Rwanda), and 500 km away in the case of Kampala (Uganda), to which almost all the commercial and financial flows of the two provinces converge.\n\nHowever, more than twenty years on, this cycle of war has laid the foundations for the insecurity that reigns in the country’s eastern provinces. The war also uprooted entire communities and destroyed the economic fabric, not to mention providing many of the weapons and munitions that continue to traumatize civilian populations. Faced with this situation, the United Nations has deployed the largest peacekeeping operation in the world, with 19,815 peacekeepers whose mission is to protect civilians and consolidate peace.\n\nAlthough the conflicts have eased considerably, allowing, for example, the organization in December 2018 of the third cycle of democratic elections since the 2003 Sun City Agreement, the activities of armed groups, the undermining of gains resulting from political negotiations, the activism of armed groups involved not only in the trafficking of natural resources but also in sexual violence against civilians, and the enshrinement of impunity sometimes as a bonus for peace during negotiations with warlords, remain issues that still seriously threaten the stability of the DRC. To these must be added such pertinent issues as the return of Congolese refugees living in Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi, against a backdrop of denial of the right to nationality, often fueled by rhetoric as violent as it is irresponsible, not to mention the equally precarious and thorny situation of the repatriation of Rwandan refugees from 1994-1998 still present on DRC territory.\n\nSecondly, without claiming to be a panacea, we’ll be suggesting ways out of the conflict.\n\n3.2.1 The patrimonial conception of power\n\nWe’re not going back to Methuselah to talk about Eastern DRC, but instability in the Grand Kivu is due to armed violence fueled by small arms trafficking, and from the interethnic-based disputes that characterize it. These disputes are as much historical as they are inevitable, rooted in the very existence of this important part of the DRC, part of the pre-colonial as well as colonial and political history of this country of over 80 million inhabitants. It is also rooted in the problems associated with the exploitation of the DRC’s rich natural resources.\n\nThe report by the United Nations panel identified Congolese and foreign personalities incriminated in the exploitation of the DRC’s natural resources through various organized and unorganized crises. However, it would be dishonest to overlook the repercussions of the Leopold administration and colonization. First, the economic expansion pursued by King Leopold II through the use of terror in the Independent State of Congo - 1884 to 1908 - and then the period of Belgian colonization from 1908 to 1960 [41].\n\nThese factors, combined with catastrophic governance over the last 50 years since independence, have revealed the damaging effects of colonial civilization’s mission to civilize, which ignored the sociological realities of the indigenous people in their cultural, political, and economic diversity, have impoverished the people of Kivu today, exposing them to the temptation of easy gain, gratuitous violence, the exploitation of the natural resources of the eastern DRC, and the estrangement of any hope of peace for long-awaited development.\n\nThe abundant literature on the actions of the administration set up by King Leopold II informs us that his so-called “civilizing” work was carried out with the sole aim of enriching the sovereign in a European economic context dominated by the discovery of rubber as an essential element for the automobile industry, and without any attention being paid to the socio-cultural and political realities that governed these indigenous peoples [41].\n\nDenis SEMADWINGA pointed out a reality that is mostly concealed by those who deny the right to Congolese nationality to Kinyarwanda-speaking populations living in the provinces of North and South Kivu: “It’s true that dismemberment, however justified it may seem by the desire to secure the natural borders formed by the chain of volcanoes, nonetheless denotes the strict ignorance of local realities displayed by Europe’s chancellors.” [39]. In support of this assertion, which would startle many subjective objectors, he cites the regions of Busanza, Jomba, Bukoma, Bwisha, Bukumu, Kamuronza, Gishari, Mushari, Mokoto, Bwito, etc., as examples. Their incorporation into the Congo does not go back further than the first decade of this century [42].\n\nThere’s every indication that racial considerations have fueled prejudice against Africans, who are considered subhuman. The fate reserved for the Venus Noire and the tragedy of the severed hands of workers who failed to meet rubber production quotas speak for themselves [42].\n\nJean Jacques MAQUET declares that the ideology of race guided the governance of the administration under the EIC. “The reduction of African societies to a set of ethnic cleavages has been general in colonial and post-colonial literature; the particularity of the African lake region is the racial turn taken by this type of analysis. The assimilation of the so-called agricultural and pastoral categories to the meeting of two great races, the Bantu and the Hamitic, is a kind of catechism that cannot be ignored in the great mass of publications devoted to the region. It would be impossible to talk about the region’s culture and history without putting on the spectacles inherited from 19th-century Gobi ideologies” [43].\n\nThis vision has had an adverse effect on inter-ethnic relations in the region, already damaged by years of slavery followed by the chaotic administration of Leopold II.\n\nThe scandal generated by the reports and investigations of associations defending the rights of the indigenous peoples of yesteryear, such as the Swedish and American missions, demonstrated that the atrocities suffered by the indigenous populations could be prosecuted as crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity [43].\n\nDr. Motsoko Pheko’s speech on the effects of colonialism on Africa’s past and future, in support of the thesis that colonialism has done great harm to Africa, is based on a statement by Edem Kodjo, author of the book entitled “Afrique de demain,” describing the situation of the African as having been removed from his history, placed in a universe shaped by the outside world that has suppressed his values, silenced by a cultural invasion that marginalizes him. He ends by saying that the African today is the distorted picture of others [41].\n\nOther authors, notably Anglo-Saxon, have denounced the atrocities committed in the name of “Western Christian Civilization” against the indigenous populations under Leopold II. British philosopher Bertrand Russel wrote: “Each village was ordered by the authorities to harvest and bring in a certain quantity of rubber. If they failed to do so, their women were taken and kept as hostages in the harems of colonial government officials. If this failed, police troops were sent in to spread terror, if necessary killing a few men and ensuring that the right hand of every black man shot dead was taken away as a souvenir” [44].\n\nIn a study entitled “Gouvernance post-conflit du développement local au Nord-Kivu et Sud-Kivu en République Démocratique du Congo: entre enjeux locaux et nationaux,” Jules Maps BAGALWA Mapatano is more explicit about the situation in Masisi: “In Masisi, land is the fundamental reason for conflicts between the Bahunde and the Banyarwanda, and between the Bahunde themselves. They are having a detrimental effect on the lives of the territory’s inhabitants. This situation is not new. It has its roots in Belgian colonization. For economic reasons, the colonizer decreed the immigration of Banyarwanda to the Masisi territory. He favored the newcomers to the detriment of the natives as part of the colonial “divide and conquer” policy. Furthermore, he failed to achieve the cultural integration of the Banyarwanda in Masisi territory. On the contrary, it has reinforced the gulf it has created between the two ethnic groups to the point of animosity. Hence the difficulty of cohabitation and the lack of socio-cultural integration, a source of conflict including land disputes. The departure of the colonizer in 1960 coincided with the transition from latent conflict to open and even armed conflict between the two antagonists. The fire that had smouldered during colonization was given a chance to explode once the fear of colonial authority had passed and disappeared” [45].\n\nJules M. BAGALWA is not the only one to have attempted to understand the causes of the conflicts between the Bahunde and the Banyarwanda in the Masisi territory.\n\nOlivier MPIANA Kalombo, who has researched the nationality of Rwandophone populations living in the DRC, presents his analysis as follows: “In Masisi territory, the colonial government created an autonomous chiefdom, Gishari, headed by a Tutsi immigrant, Mr. BUCYANAYANDI Wilfried, who arrived in the Belgian Congo on the wave of the Mission d’Immigration des Banyarwanda (MIB). The Hunde customary authorities protested to the government; they even took steps in Brussels, where they reminded the Belgian authorities that the Rwandans had only been admitted to Congolese lands on condition that they remained under the control of the Hunde customary authorities. Brussels agreed with these authorities, represented by Mwami KALINDA André, and Chief BUCYANAYANDI was deposed and his chieftaincy abolished.” [46].\n\nIt’s clear that for the colonizer, the need for economic expansion as a European power dictated the necessary occupation and exploitation of the entire Congo-Belgium territory, and hence of most of the Congo Basin.\n\nGenerally speaking, the troubles that engulfed North Kivu in 1993 seem to have had their roots in colonial society, but were exacerbated during the Second Republic by the calculations of certain political leaders who used and fabricated the ethnic fact to gain or maintain power [47]."
