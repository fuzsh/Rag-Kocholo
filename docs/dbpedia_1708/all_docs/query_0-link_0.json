        "text": "We track closely 10 key ‚Äústage gate‚Äù orders for #LNG projects that fall into two segments: Construction Authorization Orders and Activity Authorization Orders. Rumor has it that in a pre-CeraWeek press conference, Venture Global said it plans first gas at Plaquemines in 90 days and first LNG during the summer ‚Äî on track with its projected in service in Q3. Plaquemines recently obtained a key authorization from #FERC on March 19 to commission its LM2500 Utility Systems, which are gas turbines for startup and peaking and part of its ‚ÄúPower Island.‚Äù This most recent authorization would fall under the 6th of Arbo's defined \"stage gates\" ‚Äî Energize Electrical Substations ‚Äî signifying a key transition into the second segment of orders focused on authorizing activities and significant progress with construction. As you can see below, the orders in this second segment tend to come quickly, and signify a fast approaching in-service date. ***Note that projects have historically taken much longer from the order to energize electrical substations to in-service than Plaquemines is planning ‚Äî if the project does indeed reach in-service before the end of this year.\n\n‚úÖThe results of a power flows and dynamic feasibility study confirmed that the Harmony Link onshore AC electricity interconnector between Lithuania and Poland can be a viable technical alternative to offshore HVDC link. üîéThe study was carried out by the Institute of Power Engineering, Gdansk Division, Poland, on behalf of the Lithuanian, Polish, Latvian, and Estonian transmission system operators (TSOs). In April 2023, Litgrid and PSE, the Lithuanian and Polish TSOs, cancelled the procurement of the planned offshore Harmony Link HVDC interconnector due to a significant increase in cable and converter station prices. üßëüíºImmediately after this decision, the Polish and Lithuanian TSOs started the process of preparing for new tenders and considering various technical solutions that could reduce costs and be implemented in the shortest possible time. ‚ö°One of the technical solutions considered by Litgrid and PSE was an onshore AC interconnector. This method of project implementation was initially assessed as a way to reduce the project budget and to implement the project faster. #EnergyTransformationPartners #Renewables #EnergyIndependence #Synchronisation #HarmonyLink\n\nNJIT‚Äôs New Jersey Wind Week has gotten off to a great start with a fruitful 2-day bootcamp followed by today‚Äôs start to the 2-day conference. I presented several analogies involving bridges, water pipes, and spinning tops to articulate some of the considerations when ensuring reliable grid integration of large-scale converter-interfaced projects, such as offshore wind. The need for workforce development has been a recurring theme of this event. My thoughts shared on areas of consideration for those in industry or preparing to enter the workforce: 1. Power systems and power electronics are converging fields for the power industry, offshore wind included. FACTS and HVDC systems were the main areas of overlap for many years, however increased project size and penetration levels have furthered the need for a broader knowledge base of both fields. 2. Our grid has historically had dynamics associated with physical properties of machines, providing intrinsic short-circuit currents based on the unit's sub-transient reactance, reactive power response based on the open-circuit transient time constant of the machine and its excitation system, and active power dictated by the properties of the prime mover's fuel source driven by governor response. Physical aspects, such as driving magnetic flux in the air gap or physical action of a valve opening or closing. For power electronic converters, there are still physical limits such as semiconductor current or voltage withstand, however the dynamics the grid experiences is fundamentally determined by the architecture and parameterization of its control system, not the physical properties of the device. This controlled dynamic behavior can occur rapidly. Gain familiarity with control systems and design for robustness, not boastfulness. 3. Challenges are multi-disciplinary. It is impossible to know everything. Get comfortable with being uncomfortable, that‚Äôs where growth comes. When looking at systems, inherently it involves multiple fields of specialization, be it power systems, power electronics, electromagnetics, control systems, mechanical, civil, thermodynamic ‚Ä¶ the list goes on. You don't need to be a master of all fields. You'll be surrounded by bright people. Trust they will do their role and do the best possible job with yours. 4. Focus on the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù, assume everything is wrong, and prove to yourself otherwise. Focus on first principles, the ground level of understanding. Be curious. Don't assume accuracy. Investigate and ask questions. Fluency in a language doesn't come from knowing vocabulary words or grammar rules, but the connection of these dots to make a web of knowledge. The same applies to engineering across domains, devices, and systems. Take the opportunity to connect the dots. 5. With the grid‚Äôs accelerating transformation, there is more need than ‚Äúhands‚Äù, thus an excellent time to pursue a career in power! There is no end in sight and we need more bright minds.\n\nThe vulnerability of subsea power cables, supply chain constraints and geographical limitations can pose major challenges for interconnector and offshore wind projects. Subsea power cables, that link turbines to onshore substations, are prone to failures that account for a significant portion of offshore wind insurance claims, despite representing only a small fraction of the overall costs. Additionally, the increasing demand for these cables has strained the global supply chain, making it difficult to secure production slots and installation vessels within project timelines. Furthermore, congested coastal areas and limited undersea cable corridors, further complicate the installation process, especially in regions like Singapore. So how can we address these constraints? ‚ö° Developers need to proactively secure supply commitments and production slots early in the project lifecycle to mitigate supply chain risks. ‚ö° Exploration of alternative installation techniques such as long and deep water-to-water and water-to-land horizontal directional drilling methods can circumvent geographical limitations and congested coastal areas. ‚ö° Consideration of technology such as 400kV Subsea 3-core cables and Single Core bundled cables that present a potential cost-effective solution to enhance HVAC transmission capacity within smaller corridors where feasible. ‚ö° HVDC technology offers the unique capability to build long underwater or underground cable transmission lines with low losses and limited corridor requirements"
