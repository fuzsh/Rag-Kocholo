        "text": "Identification is recognition of common origin or shared characteristics with another person or group. The process of identification also seeks to exclude the other. As Stuart Hall writes, it's a process of \"articulation\", never completed - always 'in process' (Hall 1996: 2-3). As a result, identity, a product of identification, becomes positional and strategic, constructed, deconstructed and reconstructed depending on the conditions and scenarios facing an individual or group. In this paper, I argue that if identities are constructed in relation to the \"other\", then they can also be deconstructed as a result of crimes of mass atrocity such as genocide, and then reconstructed in a post-genocide scenario.\n\nKing, R. U. & Sakamoto, I. (2015). Special Issue: When hurting helps: The role of well-being in engagement with, and desistance from, collective wrongdoing. Peace & Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology, 21(3), 378-394. Rwandans have been engaged in reconstruction and reconciliation initiatives since the end of the 1994 Tutsi genocide. How these efforts help perpetrators and bystanders (from the Hutu group) to disengage from harmdoing and work toward the peace and well-being of their collective communities remains understudied. This paper presents part of a research study that examined the role of sharing personal stories through the Healing of Life Wounds (HLW), a community-based program bringing together Tutsi and Hutu community members for mutual healing. Data utilized in the paper draw from individual interviews of 10 participants after HLW workshops, along with observation of 23 participants who completed the intervention, and self-reflective notes generated by the first author. Dialogic performance narrative method was used to analyze and interpret the data. The study results pointed to attitudes negatively affecting social relations and overall well-being of individuals and community functioning. The participants described being nyamwigendaho “minding their own business,” an attitude that limited interactions and emotional connections between survivors and nonsurvivors and even within in-groups. The participants found that the HLW program offered them the tools and the space that allowed them to challenge themselves individually and collectively to confront issues that divided them. This process facilitated the development of new understandings of the shared suffering of both Hutus and Tutsis and the roles they each play in inflicting this suffering and commitments to mutual healing. The study results highlight the importance of engaging members of opposing groups in disengaging from the legacy of collective harmdoing and its consequent emotions in order to build sustainable peace."
