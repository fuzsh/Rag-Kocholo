        "text": "Dr Christian Nührenbörger, Head of the Sports Orthopaedics Department and Consultant Head of Sports Medicine and Prevention at the Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg (CHL), has been named \"Sports Doctor of the Year 2023\" by the GOTS.Dr Nührenbörger, who is also President of the Congress of the Society of Orthopaedic-Traumatological Sports Medicine and a presenter in Luxembourg this year, has been honoured for his national achievements in sports medicine. The prize is already be the 2nd. Sharing for someone from Luxembourg - in 2016, Dr Axel Urhausen was already named Sports Doctor of the Year by the CHL.\"I have no words, it was quite a surprise. You're crazy,\" said Dr Nührenbörger, who was completely \"surprised\" by the award. \"I'd like to thank GOTS, the medical doctors, my colleagues Romain Seil and Axel Urhausen and of course my family for the support. It's a great pleasure to accept the title. \"With Dr Christian Nührenbörger, non-surgical sports orthopaedics as a mainstay of sports medical care can no longer be imagined in Luxembourg. In the meantime, even a number drawing device had to be installed in the CHL waiting room for his emergency consultation. Dr Nührenbörger studied human medicine at the Wilhelms Westphalian University in Münster (D), with periods abroad in Lille and in the USA. He completed his training as a specialist in orthopaedics at the University of Magdeburg, the Hellersen Hospital for Sports Injuries and the Orthopaedic Clinic at Saarland University in Hombourg/Saar. In 1997, he graduated with a thesis on \"fractures and dislocations of the root bones of the foot\".He obtained additional designations in sports medicine and chiropractic, as well as training in osteopathic medicine, atmospheric therapy, manual medical diagnosis and therapy for infants and disabled children.He has been working at the Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg since 2004. Starting out in containers in the clinic car park, with his tenacity he has succeeded in establishing his leading field of sports orthopaedics in sports medicine, through teamwork with Prof. Dr. Romain Seil. Dr Nührenbörger has many years' experience in providing sports medical support to clubs, associations and national teams in Germany and Luxembourg in a variety of sports - including rowing, football and triathlon - at events such as the last 3 Olympic Games for Luxembourg, as well as the European Games and the European Youth Games.But the doctor has proved his commitment and expertise not only in caring for athletes at the highest level - his dedication also applies to leisure and health sportspeople, right down to the patient who \"moves or can be moved\".He pays great attention to the fundamental ethics of the medical profession. He therefore applauds his athletic patients and welcomes good achievements, but rejects achievements at any cost. His stance in the fight against doping and the abuse of power in sport has been, and still is, clear and exemplary.Christian Nührenbörger has been a member of the GOTS since 2003, and since 2022 he has been a member of the Board of Directors, working with the Children's Sports Orthopaedics Committee and the Education Commission. In Luxembourg, he is a member of the National Olympic Committee's medical commission and the board of directors of the LIHPS Olympic Support Centre.From October, he will head up the CHL's sports medical department.\n\nRiccardo Cristiani 1, 2; Anders Stålman 1, 2; Karl Eriksson 3, 4; Per Hamberg 4, Jack Lysholm 5 & Romain Seil 6, 7 1 - Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Stockholm Sports Trauma Research Center, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden 2 - Capio Artro Clinic, FIFA Medical Centre of Excellence, Sophiahemmet Hospital, Valhallavägen 91, 11486 Stockholm, Sweden 3 - Department of Orthopaedics, Stockholm South Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden 4 - Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden 5 - Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden 6 - Sports Clinic, Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg-Clinique d’Eich, 78 Rue d’Eich, 1460 Luxembourg, Luxembourg 7 - Sports Medicine and Science, Luxembourg Institute of Research in Orthopaedics, Luxembourg, Luxembourg Link to the article Most of the relevant literature [5, 8, 15, 16, 21, 32, 37] reports that meniscal ramp lesions were first described by Strobel in 1988 [34]. Like many others, I (the first author) was under the same impression. However, during my visit to Prof. Romain Seil in Luxembourg (as a recipient of the ESSKA DePuy Knee Arthroscopy Fellowship), I learnt that these lesions were described in Sweden before by Per Hamberg, Jan Gillquist and Jack Lysholm [17]. It was back in 1983, when Hamberg et al. [17] published their study “Suture of new and old peripheral meniscus tears”. This prospective study was carried out from January 1977 to June 1980. The term “ramp lesion” had not been created at that time and that is why the authors called these lesions “vertical peripheral tears of the meniscus”. They diagnosed these tears through the Gillquist view with a 30- or 70-degree arthroscope and, if a tear was identified, a repair was performed through a mini-arthrotomy behind the posterior oblique ligament. Using their technique, the edges of the tear were debrided with a curette or a scalpel and two-to-four interrupted 2-0 Vicryl sutures were used to repair the meniscus back to the capsule. At a mean follow-up of 18 months, the authors reported clinical healing (no meniscal symptoms) in 84% of their patients. In addition, 64% of these patients underwent a second-look arthroscopy showing that all the repaired tears had healed. The authors therefore recommended the systematic exploration of the posteromedial compartment of the knee and repair of these tears, even in chronic cases, as they can be expected to heal after repair. These findings were quite revolutionary. At that time, several authors recommended total meniscectomy for peripheral tears of the meniscus in combination with ligament injuries [24, 25, 31], even though complete meniscectomy had already been associated with knee osteoarthritis and increased laxity [11, 14, 18, 26]. DeHaven et al. [12] and Cassidy and Shaffer [7] reported the healing of meniscal tears repaired soon after injury, but this was not proven by second-look arthroscopy. With their study, Hamberg et al. [17] were the first to describe the meniscus tear that was later named “ramp lesion” by Strobel [34]. According to Hamberg and Lysholm, one of the reasons why they discovered these tears was because of the routine use of the trans-patellar Gillquist portal which allowed easier exploration of the posteromedial ramp area. Even though, since the 1980s, the Swedish pioneers continued systematically to explore the ramp area and repair ramp lesions, these lesions were neither discussed nor the subject of research for almost two decades when they were eventually highlighted again in South Korea by Ahn et al. in the early 2000s [2, 3]. In a recent editorial commentary, Seil [29] hypothesised that one of the reasons for the two-decade neglect of these injuries might be that orthopaedic surgeons have focused too much on the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) itself, thereby paying less attention to the other intra- or extra-articular structures. Despite knowledge of the association of these tears with ACL injuries, the systematic exploration of the posteromedial ramp area has not been emphasised for decades.\n\nS. Cerciello 1, 2, 3 ; M.

Orthopaedic practice has evolved significantly over the last five years to address these drawbacks. The aim of the present survey was to analyze the changes in the approach to ACL reconstruction among a population of young ESSKA surgeons dedicated to ACL surgery. Methods: The survey was uploaded on the ESSKA website and was accessible to members under the age of 45. The ESSKA society has 1035 U45 members involved in multiple aspects of Orthopaedic practice. One hundred and forty questionnaires were returned. Several aspects of ACL surgery were investigated at baseline and 5 years prior. They included general details such as the volume of ACL reconstructions per surgeon per year, the graft choice in cases of low and high demanding patients, the technique for femoral tunnel drilling and the preferred device for femoral fixation. The approach to the management of damage to peripheral structures, as well as meniscal ramp and root tears were also investigated. Results: Hamstrings and quadrupled semitendinosus were the preferred graft choice in low-demanding patients (92.9%) while quadriceps tendon is gaining popularity in contact sport practitioners (from 4.3 to 10.7%). The percentage of surgeons using femoral screws had decreased from 37.9 to 29.3 while the percentage of those who used buttons increased from 52.9 to 69.3%. Extra-articular procedures (antero-lateral ligament (ALL) or lateral tenodesis have become popular. The percentage of surgeons who perform an additional peripheral reconstruction rose from 28.5 to 71.5%. Of those who perform the meniscal repair more than 50% of patients rose from 14.3 to 27.9%. Similarly, the percentage of surgeons who performed a medial meniscus ramp lesion repair rose from 29.4 to 54.7%. While the percentage of those who choose to perform a transtibial pull-out repair of lateral meniscus root tears significantly rose from 17.9 to 59.3%. Conclusions: The present survey among under 45 years old ESSKA surgeons yields some notable findings. The new evidence on the impact of injuries on peripheral structures and menisci is stimulating surgeons towards a more anatomic approach if identified at the time of ACL reconstruction. This evidence will probably influence future research and decision-making.\n\nLink to the article Malisoux L, Gette P, Backes A, Delattre N, Cabri J and Theisen D (2021) Relevance of Frequency-Domain Analyses to Relate Shoe Cushioning, Ground Impact Forces and Running Injury Risk: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Trial With 800+ Recreational Runners. Front. Sports Act. Living 3:744658. doi: 10.3389/fspor.2021.744658 Running is characterized by the repetition of many, almost identical movements with limited variations (Mann et al., 2015). During the stance phase of each step, a ground reaction force (GRF) is applied to the body. The shape of the vertical component of the GRF over time is approximately that of a mass-spring impact (McMahon and Cheng, 1990). In most runners, two distinct peaks are easily detectable on a plot of the vertical GRF vs. time (Malisoux et al., 2021). The first peak (Fz1, often termed vertical impact peak force) occurs within the first 50 ms after initial contact and is referred to as the impact peak, while the second peak (Fz2) occurring approximately at mid stance phase is referred to as the active peak. Fz1 originates from the rapid deceleration of the support leg segments at initial contact, although the magnitude of the peak mainly depends on the contribution of the rest of the body. Fz2 is associated with the active motion of the rest of the body when the center of mass reaches its minimum vertical position during the stance phase (Bobbert et al., 1991). While Fz1 may not always be visually detectable in time-domain plots in runners with specific foot strike patterns (i.e., mid-and forefoot strike), (Lieberman et al., 2010), some studies provided evidence of a vertical impact force in all strike patterns (Gruber et al., 2011, 2017). The cumulative load applied to the musculoskeletal system resulting from several thousand steps taken during each training session may lead to an overuse injury, especially if inadequate recovery is provided between stress applications (Hreljac, 2004). For decades, it has been assumed that some running-related injuries are typically associated with the landing phase (e.g., stress fracture, tendinopathy), because of the stress resulting from the collision between the body and the ground (Cavanagh and Lafortune, 1980; Bobbert et al., 1991; Wit et al., 1995). The main arguments are that forces observed during distance running are 1.5–2 times larger than those occurring in walking, a rapid increase in force immediately follows initial contact, and a runner covering 20 km per week will cumulate more than 10,000 impacts on each leg over a seven-day period. During the landing phase, eccentric contractions are observed in some of the muscles controlling the movement (e.g., ankle-dorsiflexors or plantar flexors depending on the foot strike pattern, quadriceps muscles), which may cause large forces and high internal mechanical stress (Bobbert et al., 1991). Large muscular forces may also cause high stress on the tendons and their bony attachments. Consequently, biomechanical factors related to vertical GRF have often been studied during running, with Fz1, Fz2 and loading rate being among the most investigated variables. Surprisingly, the current knowledge on the relationship between impact force characteristics, such as Fz1 or vertical instantaneous loading rate, and injury risk is still inconsistent (Nigg et al., 2015; Theisen et al., 2016; Ceyssens et al., 2019). This is mainly due to small sample sizes, as well as differences in the populations investigated and study designs in research conducted so far (Nigg et al., 2015; Theisen et al., 2016; Ceyssens et al., 2019). Grimston et al. (1991) already observed a greater Fz1 in female runners with a history of stress fracture compared to non-stress-fracture runners, although the question whether these greater forces are a cause or a consequence of having suffered a stress fracture could not be addressed with such a study design. 25 years later, a meta-analysis confirmed that loading rate was higher in runners with a history of stress fracture (van der Worp et al., 2016). A similar effect was found from the studies that included runners with all running-related injury types compared with those without injuries. However, these conclusions are mostly based on case-control designs. A prospective study investigated impact forces as a potential injury risk factor in female runners, but no difference was observed between injured and uninjured runners (Davis et al., 2016). Secondary analyses showed that Fz1 and loading rates were greater in runners with a medically diagnosed injury compared to those who had never reported any previous injury. However, these results were based on a limited sample size (n = 32), the analysis was retrospective in nature, and running exposure (i.e., distance or hours of practice) was not taken into account, which severely limits the conclusions that can be drawn. Another plausible explanation for the inconsistent evidence could be that the relationship between impact forces and injury risk, if it exists, is not linear, but U-shaped. In this case, risk factors should not be analyzed as continuous variables, as in most previous studies, but instead be categorized using certain cutoffs (Bahr and Holme, 2003), thus transforming a continuous variable into a categorical or grouping variable. According to this method, runners with values in the upper or lower range of a given variable would be compared to a reference group, e.g., those with values within one standard deviation (SD) around the mean of the entire cohort. Despite the absence of prospective evidence on the role of impact force in injury development, it has been suggested that paradigms leading to a decrease or elimination of impact forces, such as changes in strike pattern (Lieberman et al., 2010; Cheung and Davis, 2011; Daoud et al., 2012) or increased shoe cushioning (Richards et al., 2009) would reduce injury risk. For instance, a 2-week gait retraining program aiming at lowering loading rate was effective in reducing injury risk in novice runners (Chan et al., 2018a). The protective effect of greater shoe cushioning has also been recently demonstrated in a randomized trial including 800+ recreational runners (Malisoux et al., 2020), where the participants having received the Soft shoe version had a lower injury risk compared to those having received the Hard version (Sub hazard rate ratio–SHR = 1.52; 95% Confidence Interval−95% CI = 1.07 to 2.16; Soft shoe group is the reference), (Malisoux and Theisen, 2020). In the same trial (Malisoux et al., 2020), all runners were tested in the allocated study shoes at baseline on an instrumented treadmill. One of the main findings was the greater Fz1 observed in the Soft shoe version (Malisoux et al., 2021). This may appear counterintuitive with regards to the initial goal of the cushioning systems (i.e., lower Fz1), but the observation was consistent with previous studies (Baltich et al., 2015; Chan et al., 2018b; Kulmala et al., 2018). An explanation for this “impact peak anomaly” has previously been provided (Shorten and Mientjes, 2011). The vertical GRF signal is actually a superimposition of low frequency (non-impact) and high-frequency (impact) load components (Shorten and Mientjes, 2011). In other words, the true impact force that originates from the collision of the lower leg segment with the ground is superimposed to the active force which depends primarily on the rest of the body (Bobbert et al., 1991). A previous study showed that softer shoes tend not only to attenuate the magnitude of the high-frequency impact peak, but also to delay its occurrence (Shorten and Mientjes, 2011). Consequently, the higher Fz1 observed in shoes with greater cushioning results from the greater relative contribution of the low-frequency load component to Fz1. Furthermore, Fz1 and loading rate were shown to be poorly correlated with tibial load bone metrics computed using a rigid body model (Matijevich et al., 2019), which suggests that Fz1 and loading rate may be unreliable indicators of musculoskeletal loading. Thus, the magnitude of Fz1 is not an appropriate indicator of impact intensity and running shoe impact alteration (Shorten and Mientjes, 2011; Matijevich et al., 2019; Malisoux et al., 2021). The main purpose of this study was to investigate whether the protective effect of the Soft shoe version observed previously (Malisoux et al., 2020) could be explained by an alteration of decomposed impact force characteristics using frequency-domain analyses. Therefore, the first objective of the study was to investigate the effect of shoe cushioning on the time, magnitude and frequency characteristics of peak forces using frequency-domain analyses by comparing baseline data from the two study groups (i.e., participants who received the Hard and Soft shoe version, respectively). We hypothesized that the Soft shoe version would be associated with a lower impact peak force, a delayed occurrence, and a lower vertical loading rate of the high-frequency signal (Shorten and Mientjes, 2011). Consistently, we also hypothesized that frequency of peak signal power, mean frequency, as well as power sum of the high frequency signal would be lower with the Soft shoe version. However, we did not expect any difference between the experimental groups in the magnitude and timing of the peak force of the low frequency signal. Our secondary objective was to investigate which of these force characteristics measured at baseline are prospectively associated with the risk of incurring a running-related injury. We hypothesized that a lower impact peak force, a delayed occurrence, and a lower vertical loading rate of the high-frequency signal would be associated with lower injury risk. We also expected that lower frequency of peak signal power, mean frequency, as well as power sum of the high frequency signal would be associated with lower injury risk.\n\nLink to the article Lehmann T., Büchel D., Mouton C., Gokeler A., Seil R. and Baumeister J. (2021) Functional Cortical Connectivity Related to Postural Control in Patients Six Weeks After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction. Front. Hum. Neurosci.15:655116. doi: 10.3389/fnhum.2021.655116 Introduction Injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) substantially affect knee joint laxity and cause long-term consequences for injured athletes. The accompanying functional impairments of an ACL tear thereby appear to extend beyond biomechanical alterations, comprising a loss of mechanoreceptors which consequently lead to diminished afferent input to higher levels of the sensorimotor system (Courtney et al., 2005; Kapreli et al., 2009). Although ACL injuries have repeatedly been shown to cause deficits in knee function even after surgical anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), knowledge about associated mechanisms of the sensorimotor system for compensating these functional impairments is still lacking (Ageberg, 2002). A growing amount of evidence has begun identifying clinically meaningful neuroplastic changes in the sensorimotor system following ACL injury. Investigations utilizing transcranial magnetic stimulation, for instance, have detected enhanced motor thresholds in the ACL injured limb, whereas functional magnetic resonance imaging or electroencephalography (EEG) studies observed increased activations of the motor areas and lower activations of somatosensory areas in these patients (Neto et al., 2019). Along with altered somatosensory information from the ACL, decreased innervation to the primary sensory cortex (Valeriani et al., 1999), as well as different corticospinal and motor cortex excitability (Pietrosimone et al., 2015; Grooms et al., 2017; Lepley et al., 2020) have been observed in patients after ACL reconstruction. As a consequence of increased motor thresholds of the injured limb and decreased responsiveness of motor areas, greater cortico-cortical stimulation is required to evoke efferent neural signaling in the motor cortex for properly controlling motion and stability of the knee joint (Lepley et al., 2020). Thus, patients with ACL injury have been shown to recruit motor areas to a larger extent than healthy individuals, indicating that cortical adaptations may facilitate the restoration of lower limb motor functions by driving compensatory synergistic muscle patterns (Courtney et al., 2005). Whereas initial findings have identified compensatory cortical patterns in patients after ACLR during proprioceptive tasks (Baumeister et al., 2008, 2011), little is known about the cortical mechanisms behind the postural deficiencies in this population. After ACLR and the following rehabilitation, many patients exhibit significantly decreased static postural stability as implied by increased center of pressure (CoP) excursions and velocities while standing on their injured limb (Lehmann et al., 2017). Although comprehensive evidence in the early postsurgical period is missing, postural stability in patients after ACLR was reported to deviate from both the preoperative level (Gokalp et al., 2016) and healthy controls (Parus et al., 2015) after the 4th and 8th week of surgery. With respect to these functional deficiencies in patients after ACLR, postural control reflects multimodal interactions within the sensorimotor system (Shumway-Cook and Woollacott, 2012). Recent findings from neuroimaging studies suggested that active contributions from the cortex continuously maintain and restore postural equilibrium (Wittenberg et al., 2017). Collectively, these EEG investigations demonstrated variations in power spectral density of theta (4–7 Hz), alpha-1 (8–10 Hz), and alpha-2 (10–12 Hz) frequency oscillations in frontal, motor, parietal, and occipital regions of the cortex. While it is suggested that theta band oscillations reflect a general brain integrative mechanism related to short term storage and manipulation of multimodal information for a given operation, alpha oscillations are related to the active inhibition of non-essential neuronal processing (Cheron et al., 2016), with alpha-1 reflecting global alertness of cortical areas and alpha-2 being associated with task-specific sensorimotor processing (Pfurtscheller and Lopes, 1999). Modulations of oscillatory activity during postural tasks therefore conceivably reflect direct or indirect interactions within complex transcortical and cortico-subcortical loops for detecting and counteracting postural instability (Wittenberg et al., 2017). The underlying functional relationships, as quantified by statistical interdependencies among distributed cortical regions, are referred to as functional connectivity (Friston, 2011). These connections show frequency-specific modulations within a fronto-parietal theta network and a parieto-occipital alpha network in response to postural instability and varying postural demands (Mierau et al., 2017; Varghese et al., 2019; Lehmann et al., 2020). In the light of injury-related increased postural sway (Lehmann et al., 2017), patients after ACLR may require stronger interactions of functionally interconnected sensorimotor areas for properly controlling postural stability (Rosen et al., 2019; Jiganti et al., 2020), as well as hip and knee movement (Criss et al., 2020) while standing on the injured limb. Investigations of structural white matter changes following ACLR further indicated that the hemisphere contralateral to the injured leg may be particularly affected by this neurostructural reorganization (Lepley et al., 2020). Therefore, the aim of the present case-control study is to explore leg dependent patterns of cortical connectivity related to postural control during single leg stances in patients 6 weeks following ACLR. It is hypothesized that patients after ACLR may show compensatory cortical mechanisms in terms of stronger functional connections within the theta and alpha networks compared to their matched controls. Furthermore, these cortical adaptations may specifically affect the stance on the injured limb. In this way, the current investigation may gain further insight into sensorimotor changes related to postural deficiencies after ACLR.\n\nThe aim of the workshop was to gather PAMI partners as well as interested institutions to discuss the organisational aspects and the future perspectives of the initiative. The PAMI aims to collect and analyse data from orthopaedic surgeons who are treating children and adolescents with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury using an international data collection system. Through this initiative, the goal is to improve diagnosis, treatment options, surgical techniques and rehabilitation of pediatric ACL injuries. Presented during the ESSKA conference in Glasgow in May 2018, the ESSKA leadership has placed PAMI under the lead of its Basic Science Committee chaired by Caroline Mouton since May 2020. Currently, 6 partner institutions from Austria, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands Norway, and Spain are actively enrolling patients. Since the first inclusion in October 2018, 68 children have been recruited with a continuous increase of inclusion within the last months. The first data shows that the chronological age at injury for this population was in average 12 years of age (from 6 to 17 years of age). Most injuries occurred while playing football (38%). At the time of the analysis, 69% were indicated for surgery. While several developments were made in the last months to enhance data quality and user’s experience with the PAMI web portal, the preliminary analyses allowed the PAMI steering committee to highlight some technical issues in data consistency, accuracy and completeness. These issues will be specifically targeted within the next months to consolidate the database and provides efficient guidelines to PAMI partners. In 2021, the PAMI managers will also start to provide yearly feedbacks to partner institutions on their data in order to ensure the quality of data and to officially publish the first results of the PAMI. Next years will be critical for the PAMI. A request to extend the ethical approval of the project as well as financial supports is foreseen, which also gives the opportunity to evaluate and strengthen the current initiative. During the workshop, inclusion/exclusion criteria were discussed again as well as the possibility to extend the content of data gathered within the project. Please be aware that we are still looking for interested partner institutions to join us. If you are an orthopaedic surgeon or a medical doctor treating children and adolescents with ACL injury and are interesting in the PAMI, please contact us at pami@esska.org. We will keep you aware of our next workshop and symposium that we hope to be able to organise during the next ESSKA congress in Milano.
