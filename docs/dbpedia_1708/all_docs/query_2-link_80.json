CL infection is the main cause of nosocomial infection in pediatrics. Prevalence of CL infection varies a lot depending on the populations studied and there are no recent data regarding the prevalence of severe sepsis due to CL.\n\nObjective: To estimate the prevalence and identify factors associated with occurrence of severe sepsis due to CL associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) in pediatrics.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: We conducted a 4-year multicentric retrospective cohort study including all children with confirmed CLABSI from birth to 18 years old, hospitalized in all pediatric units in two university hospitals. Neonatalogy units were excluded. Patients were screened from bacteriological datas. Epidemiology and bacteriology of CLABSI were described. To find potential factors associated with severe sepsis due to CLABSI we performed univariate and multivariate analysis.\n\nResults: Over 4476 suspected CL infections, we included 372 CLABSI. The prevalence of severe sepsis due to CLABSI was 17.2% (15.25–19.16%) among confirmed CLABSI and 1.43% (0.02–2.84%) among suspected CL infections. 12 children died because of severe sepsis due to CLABSI. In univariate analysis, factors associated with the occurrence of severe sepsis due to CLABSI were antibiotic therapy within 3 weeks before, known bacterial colonization, CL daily use and hospitalization in intensive care unit when the CLABSI occurred. Tachycardia and hypotension at the initial presentation, augmentation of lactate and procalcitonin at the initial biological sample were associated with the occurrence of severe sepsis due to CLABSI. In multivariate analysis, daily use of CL, know bacterial colonization, tachycardia and hypotension were associated with the occurrence of severe sepsis due to CLABSI. We couldn’t evaluate the dosage of lactate and procalcitonin due to a lack of power. There was an augmentation of gram-negative bacillus proportion among the severe sepsis due to CLABSI.\n\nConclusion: Severe sepsis prevalence in children with documented CLABSI is close to 20%. We identified factors associated with the occurrence of severe sepsis complicating CL infection. Those factors should be tested in a prospective multicenter study, to improve our ability to identify patients at risk of severe sepsis and to prevent the evolution to septic shock. This retrospective study is the first step to a prospective multicenter study aiming to optimize the initial treatment and identify children at risk to develop severe sepsis due to CLABSI, in order to improve sepsis bundles application.\n\nReference 1\n\nNiedner MF, Huskins WC, Colantuoni E, Muschelli J, Harris JM, Rice TB, et al.

The latest international guidelines of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2020 (SSC-2020) have revised the management of paediatric sepsis, particularly concerning fluid resuscitation. Although these guidelines are important, no study has evaluated their application in pediatric emergency departments. The aim of the study was to assess physician adherence to the SSC-2020 fluid resuscitation guidelines in infants and children with suspected sepsis in Pediatric Emergency Departments (PED).\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: Fluid REsuscitation for Suspected Sepsis in Pediatric Emergency Departments (FRESSPED) was a prospective multicenter observational study conducted in 21 French hospitals over 5 sequential weeks, between November 2021 and March 2022. Children with suspected sepsis and who received anti-infectious treatment within 72 h were included. Severe sepsis was confirmed using the 2005 consensus criteria in patients admitted to PICU according to a review of each medical file by pediatric intensivist. Primary outcome was SSC-2020 fluid resuscitation guidelines adherence (low 0–24%, moderate 25–74% or high 75–100%) according to: volume of 10–20 ml/kg for each bolus; exclusive administration of balanced crystalloids at 1 h and 24 h of management; and initiation of fluid resuscitation within one hour of sepsis recognition. An electronic survey was sent to all the PEDs’physicians working to report their adherence to SSC-2020.\n\nResults: A total of 63 patients were included, 10 of whom had confirmed sepsis. Median age [IQR] was 7.9 months [2.8–35.9] and a comorbidity was present in 19 children (30.1%). Primary site of infection was respiratory in half of the cases (50.8%) and unknown in 8 (12.7%) subjects. Microbiological documentation was found in 47 (74.6%) cases. Compared to the SSC-2020 guidelines: 43 (68.3%) patients received boluses of 10 to 20 ml/kg; exclusive administration of balanced crystalloids was found in 35 (55.6%) and 34 (54.8%) children at one hour and twenty-four hours of management respectively; and fluid resuscitation was initiated within one hour of sepsis recognition in 42 (76.4%) cases. Main barriers reported by physicians to such adherence were: difficult intravenous access (43.2%); lack of team training (28.8%); workload constraints (28.0%); absence or out-of-date protocols (24.0%).\n\nConclusion: FRESSPED study found high adherence for fluid resuscitation initiation and moderate adherence for bolus volume and fluid choice. Implementation of up-to-date standardized management protocols and teaching programs could improve adherence and outcomes of suspected sepsis children.\n\nCompliance with ethics regulations: Yes in clinical research.\n\nCO-03 Epidemiology of Children admitted to Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for Sickle Cell Disease associated Complication\n\nMichael Levy1, Jérôme Naudin1, Guillaume Geslain1, Géraldine Poncelet1, Fleur Le Bourgeois1, Anna Deho1, Maryline Chomton1, Arielle Maroni1, Stéphane Dauger1, Sébastien Julliand1, Julie Sommet1\n\n1Hôpital Universitaire Robert-Debré, Paris, France\n\nCorrespondence: Michael Levy (michael.levy@aphp.fr)\n\nAnnals of Intensive Care 2013, 13(Suppl 1):CO-03\n\nRationale: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most frequent inherited diseases in France and in the world. Over the last decades, in high-income countries, an important decrease in mortality have been observed due to the improved of care. However, children with SCD can become critically ill and require admission in Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICU). Only a few studies with small samples have focused on children with SCD admitted to PICU and robust data regarding the epidemiology of these patients are missing. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of children admitted to PICU for acute complications of SCD and their outcomes.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: We conducted a single center retrospective study in a tertiary center PICU. Consecutive children with SCD admitted to PICU between January 1st, 2009 and December 31, 2019 were included. Patients with sickle cell trait (heterozygous for the causative gene) or that have been admitted following bone-marrow transplant were not included.\n\nResults: 582 children with SCD were admitted to PICU during the study period. The median age was 9.2 [5.5–13.4] years and 60% were boys. 538 (93%) were of SS genotype and the baseline hemoglobin was 8.4 g/dl. 42% had a history of PICU admission and 51% of acute chest syndrome (ACS). Patients were mainly admitted from pediatric ward (n = 440, 76%) and emergency units (n = 114, 19.5%). ACS was the main reason of admission (54%) followed by vaso-occlusive crisis (17%) and stroke (17%). 492 (85%) were treated with antibiotics, 293 (50%) patients required non-invasive ventilation and 47 (8%) invasive ventilation. Cardiovascular failure was rare (2%). 223 (38%) patients required blood transfusion and 155 (27%) exchange transfusion. The median duration of PICU stay was 3 [1–4] days. The mortality rate at PICU discharge was 1% (n = 7) and 1% (n = 8) after 6 months.\n\nConclusion: Children with SCD hospitalized in PICU were mainly admitted for acute chest syndrome and half of patients required non-invasive ventilation. The median length of stay was short and the mortality low.\n\nCompliance with ethics regulations: Yes in clinical research.\n\nCO-04 Pharmacist optimization of the therapeutic management of patients on ECMO in the pediatric intensive care unit\n\nOmar Hanafia1, Héloïse Capelle2, Julie Leonelli1, Pierre Bertault-Peres1, Stéphane Honore3, Fabrice Michel1\n\n1Hôpitaux Universitaires de Marseille/AP-HM, Marseille, France; 2CH Aubagne, Abagne, France; 3Aix Marseille Université/Faculté de Pharmacie, Marseille, France\n\nCorrespondence: Omar Hanafia (omarhanafia@yahoo.fr)\n\nAnnals of Intensive Care 2013, 13(Suppl 1):CO-04\n\nRationale: Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is a rescue technique that allows the replacement of circulatory and/or respiratory functions. The pharmacokinetic modifications generated by this circulatory assistance require a dosage adaptation of certain drugs. The objective of the study was to compare the drug prescription of patients under ECMO and to propose appropriate dosages adjustments.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: Our 6-months prospective observational monocentric study focuses on critically ill patients assisted by ECMO. Clinico-biological data were collected from the computerized patient record and by the daily presence of the pharmacist in the department. We noted the type and indication of ECMO, complications and adequacy of dosages compared to the literature for relevance.\n\nResults: Fourteen patients with ECMO were included: mean age 18 months [0 to 168 months], sex ratio = 1. Renal function was impaired in 8 patients (57%). The average duration of ECMO was 15 days [3–24 days]. 6 patients were weaned, 4 of whom were still hospitalized on the ward (43%) and 8 patients died (57%). 13 patients (93%) were on veno-arterial ECMO, following acute respiratory distress syndrome (8 cases or 61%), refractory cardiac arrest (3 cases 23%), cardiogenic shock (8%) or septic shock (8%). 1 patient (7%) was on veno-venous ECMO following acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Elevent patients (79%) developed complications related to ECMO (9 hemorrhages, 8 hemolysis, 6 oxygenation difficulties, 5 PAO, 4 stroke). Concerning the drug management of these patients, we counted 16 overdosages and 2 underdosages not justified according to the literature. There was also no dosage that would explain these discrepancies, i.e. 18 nonconformities out of 73 lines analyzed concerning Vancomycin, Gentamicin, Fluconazole, Caspofungin, Voriconazole, Ganciclovir, Heparin, Morphine, Sufentanil, Midazolam, Cisatracurium, Hydrocortisone Hemisuccinate, Methadone.\n\nDiscussion: The populations studied in the literature remain different from ours, making it difficult to discuss our clinical results.\n\nConclusion: However, following the non-conformities of dosage noted, the pharmacist proposed a table of dosage adaptation under ECMO synthesizing the literature for the studied molecules which is systematically accompanied by instructions to make a therapeutic drug monitoring.\n\nCompliance with ethics regulations: N/A.\n\nCO-05 Paediatric traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is associated with lower survival rates compared to those of medical aetiology: Results from the French national registry\n\nMarguerite Lockhart-Bouron1, Valentine Canon2, Stéphane Leteurtre1, Hervé Hubert2, Morgan Recher1\n\n1Centre hospitalier universitaire de Lille, Lille, France; 2Université de Lille, Lille, France\n\nCorrespondence: Morgan Recher (morgan.recher@chu-lille.fr)\n\nAnnals of Intensive Care 2013, 13(Suppl 1):CO-05\n\nRationale: Trauma is an important cause of paediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with a high mortality rate. The first aim of this study was to compare the survival rate at day 30 and at hospital discharge following paediatric traumatic and medical out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The second aim was to compare the rates of return of spontaneous circulation and survival rates at hospital admission (day 0).\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: This multicentre comparative post-hoc study was conducted between July 2011 and February 2022 based on the French National Cardiac Arrest Registry data. All patients aged < 18 years with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were included in the study. Patients with traumatic aetiology were matched with those with medical aetiology using propensity score matching.\n\nResults: There were 398 traumatic and 1,061 medical out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Matching yielded 227 pairs. In non-adjusted comparisons, days 0 and 30 survival rates were lower in the traumatic aetiology group than in the medical aetiology group (19.1% vs. 24.0%, odds ratio (OR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56–0.99, and 2.0% vs. 4.5%, OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20–0.92, respectively). In adjusted comparisons, day 30 survival rate was lower in the traumatic aetiology group than in the medical aetiology group (2.2% vs. 6.2%, OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.13–0.99).\n\nConclusion: In paediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients, the adjusted survival rates at day 30 for those with a traumatic aetiology were lower than those with a medical aetiology. Prioritising trauma-specific interventions that address possible reversible causes of cardiac arrest may lead to improved survival in this population.\n\nCompliance with ethics regulations: Yes in clinical research.\n\nCO-06 Incidence of refeeding syndrome in pediatric intensive care\n\nKaoutar El Fakhr1, Wissal Aissaoui1, Samira Kalouch1, Abdelaziz Chlilek1\n\n1CHU Ibn Rochd, Casablanca, Maroc\n\nCorrespondence: Kaoutar El Fakhr (kaoutarelfakhr2013@gmail.com)\n\nAnnals of Intensive Care 2013, 13(Suppl 1):CO-06\n\nRationale: Refeeding syndrome (RFS) describes a potentially fatal physiological response to the increase in energy from any source including: intravenous, oral food, enteral nutrition or parenteral nutrition following a period of starvation or severely reduced energy intake, reflecting a change from catabolism to anabolism following the release of insulin. However, data on its incidence is lacking, and the heterogeneity of diagnostic criteria and frequent electrolyte disorders in this population make its diagnosis complex. In 2020, the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) developed consensus recommendations for identifying patients at risk and with refeeding syndrome. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of refeeding syndrome in critically ill children on nutritional support.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: A prospective cohort spread over three years from January 2020-January 2023, conducted in a tertiary pediatric intensive care unit was undertaken, and additional data were retrospectively collected.\n\nResults: A total of 2058 children were included in the study, with 350 children (17%) classified as undernourished, who were at risk of refeeding syndrome (142F, 158 M). Over a period of 3 years, 50 children of these were identified as having refeeding syndrome, giving a cumulative incidence of 14.28%; IC95% [0.106–0.179], aged 12 days -17 years (median 24SD + -62.7 months). Patients with refeeding syndrome have a higher risk of mortality (odds ratio [OR], 6.75; CI, 3.18–14.3; P = 0.001). Children who were fed late > 5 days are more likely to have refeeding syndrome (odds ratio [OR], 5.33; CI, 3.13–9.8; P = 0.001), children who received early feeding < 5 days are less likely to have refeeding syndrome (odds ratio [OR], 0.18; CI, 0.11–0.32; P = 0.001).\n\nConclusion: Refeeding syndrome is a serious, life-threatening metabolic complication that can lead to increased morbidity and mortality.\n\nCompliance with ethics regulations: Yes in clinical research.\n\nCO-07 Impact of systemic causes of secondary brain injury factors on the short-term prognosis of critically ill patients with sepsis-associated encephalopathy\n\nMichael Thy1,2,3, Romain Sonneville1,2,4, Stéphane Ruckly4, Claire Dupuis5, Julien Poujade1, Lila Bouadma1,2,4, Etienne De Montmollin1,2,4, Jean-François Timsit1,2,4\n\n1Department of medical and infectious intensive care unit, Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital-AP-HP Nord, Paris, France; 2Université Paris Cité, Paris, France; 3EA 7323-Pharmacology and Therapeutic Evaluation in Children and Pregnant Women, Paris, France; 4INSERM, UMR 1137, IAME, Paris, France; 5Service de Médecine Intensive et Réanimation, CHU de Clermont-Ferrand, Clermont-Ferrand, France\n\nCorrespondence: Michael Thy (michael245thy@gmail.com)\n\nAnnals of Intensive Care 2013, 13(Suppl 1):CO-07\n\nRationale: Sepsis is complicated in about 50% of cases by an acute encephalopathy ranging from delirium to coma (sepsis-associated encephalopathy, SAE), which is associated with poor outcome. Systemic causes of secondary brain injury (SSBI), that are frequently observed in ICU patients, may worsen outcomes of SAE. We aimed to investigate the association between the presence of at least one SSBI within the first two days of intensive care unit (ICU) admission with outcomes of SAE patients.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis using data from the French OUTCOMEREA multicenter prospective database. We included consecutive SAE patients (defined by a score on the Glasgow coma scale ≤ 13 and severe sepsis or septic shock (SEPSIS 2.0 definition) criteria) requiring invasive mechanical ventilation at ICU admission. We excluded patients with infectious and non-infectious acute cerebral pathologies. For each patient, we analyzed the SSBI events (abnormal glycemia, hypotension, temperature abnormalities, anemia, dysnatremia, oxygenation abnormalities, dyscapnia) present within the first 2 days of hospitalization in ICU and the impact of their control at day 3 on day-14 mortality using a Cox-model with adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and 95% confidence interval [95% CI].\n\nResults: From 1997 to 2020, 995 patients were included in the study. Compared to decedents at D14, alive patients had significantly less SSBI events, including less hypoglycemia (< 3 mmol/L), less hypothermia (< 36 °C), less hypoxemia (PaO2 < 60 mmHg), less hypotension (DAP < 50 mmHg) and anemia (hematocrit < 21%) within the 2 first days hospitalization in ICU. After adjusting for confounders (SOFA score, type of admission, comorbid conditions), the control of the following SSBI at day 3 was significantly associated with lower day-14 mortality for blood pressure (diastolic pressure > 50 mmHg: aHR = 1.997 [1.42–2.8], p < 0.001), oxygenation (PaO2 between 60 and 200 mHg: aHR = 2.076 [1.36–3.16], p < 0.001), glycemia (glycemia between 3 and 11 mM/l: aHR = 1.604 [1.21–2.12], p < 0.001), temperature (36 °C-38.3 °C: aHR = 1.55 [1.14–2.11], p = 0.006).\n\nConclusion: We demonstrate that the control of SSBI (particularly oxygenation, arterial pressure, glycemia, temperature) improves prognosis of patients with SAE. SSBI monitoring and control should be systematically done in all septic patients with SAE.\n\nCompliance with ethics regulations: Yes in clinical research.\n\nCO-08 Sepsis at time of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation initiation is associated with early neurobiological and neurophysiological alterations\n\nChloé Tridon1, Delphine Bachelet2, Majda El Baied2, Philippine Eloy2, Sofia Ortuno2, Marylou Para2, Paul-Henri Wicky2, Geoffroy Vellieux2, Etienne De Montmollin2, Lila Bouadma2, Hana Manceau3, Jean-François Timsit2, Katell Peoc'h3, Romain Sonneville2\n\n1Hôpital Mignot, Le Chesnay, France; 2Hôpital Bichat, Paris, France; 3Hôpital Beaujon, Clichy, France\n\nCorrespondence: Chloé Tridon (chloe.tridon12@gmail.com)\n\nAnnals of Intensive Care 2013, 13(Suppl 1):CO-08\n\nRationale: Neurologic outcomes of patients under venoarterial ECMO (VA-ECMO) may be worsened by secondary insults of systemic origin. We aimed to assess whether sepsis, commonly observed during ECMO support, is associated with brain injury and outcomes in these patients.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: We conducted a single-center cohort \"exposed-non-exposed\" type study (2013–2020) in a university hospital in consecutive adult patients treated by VA-ECMO. Patients with \"sepsis\" at the time of VA-ECMO cannulation were compared with \"non-sepsis\" patients. Main outcome measures included clinical status, NSE and S100β blood concentrations, and EEG parameters measured within 72 h of VA-ECMO cannulation. We investigated the association between sepsis and poor functional outcome at 90 days (modified Rankin scale (mRS) score ≥ 4) in adjusted (logistic regression, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)) analyses. Subgroup analyses were conducted in patients with or without pre-ECMO cardiac arrest.\n\nResults: A total of 196 patients was included (“sepsis”, n = 128; “non-sepsis”, n = 68), of whom 87 (44.4%) presented cardiac arrest before VA-ECMO cannulation. Compared to the “non-sepsis” group, “sepsis” patients presented a significant increase in the S100β protein concentrations at day 1 (0.94 μg/L versus 0.52 μg/L, p = 0.03), and more frequent EEG alterations (i.e., severe slowing, discontinuous background, and a lower prevalence of sleep patterns). A poor functional outcome was observed in 99/128 (77.3%) patients of the \"sepsis\" group and 46/68 (67.6%) of the \"non-sepsis\" group (adjusted logistic regression OR 1.21, 95%CI 0.58–2.47; IPTW OR 1.24, 95%CI 0.79–1.95). Sensitivity analyses suggested that sepsis was independently associated with poorer functional outcomes in the “pre-ECMO cardiac arrest” subgroup (adjusted logistic regression OR 3.44, 95%CI 1.06–11.40; IPTW OR 3.52, 95%CI 1.68 -7.73), whereas no such association was observed in patients without pre-ECMO cardiac arrest (adjusted logistic regression OR 0.69, 95%CI 0.27 -1.69; IPTW OR 0.76, 95%CI 0.42–1.35).\n\nConclusion: Sepsis at the time of VA-ECMO initiation is associated with early biochemical and electrophysiological alterations. We observed a detrimental role of sepsis on neurologic outcomes in the subgroup of patients who had experienced pre-ECMO cardiac arrest, but not in other patients.\n\nCompliance with ethics regulations: Yes in clinical research.\n\nCO-09 Effect of adding erythromycin on mortality and sepsis biomarkers in ICU septic patients: randomized trial\n\nAhlem Trifi1, Badis Tlili1, Hounaida Galai1, Salma Ghalloussi1, Salma Kamoun1, Emir Bedhiafi 1, Ahmed Albattrawi1, Eya Seghir1, Lynda Messaoud1, Asma Mehdi1, Sami Abdellatif1, Salah Ben Lakhal1\n\n1Medical ICU, Hôpital la Rabta, Tunis, Tunisie\n\nCorrespondence: Ahlem Trifi (trifiahlem2@gmail.com)\n\nAnnals of Intensive Care 2013, 13(Suppl 1):CO-09\n\nRationale: In sepsis, the imbalance of the immune-inflammatory response is a source of organ dysfunction. Immunomodulatory therapies have been tried in order to moderate this imbalance and improve the outcome of critically septic patients. We sought to determine whether the adjunction of erythromycin (a macrolide antibiotic known to have immunomodulatory effects) in septic patients has a regulatory effect on the infection biomarkers and decreases mortality.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: We performed a single-blind randomized trial comparing erythromycin 1 gx3/d intravenously for 5 days versus placebo for 5 days in adult patients admitted to intensive care with. The exclusion criteria was death within 5 days of the protocol. Inflammatory markers (whole blood count, CRP and procalcitonin) were assayed on inclusion (D0) and on D6 (end of prescription). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality and the secondary outcomes were changes in infection biomarkers between D0-D6, vasopressor requirements, ventilation use and duration, and length of stay. [ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04665089].\n\nResults: One hundrer and nine patients were enrolled, of whom 80 were included (erythromycin group, n = 40 and placebo group, n = 40). The male sex was predominant in the first group (31 (77.5%) vs 20 (50%), p = 0.01). The other baseline characteristics were similar (age = 63 [51–78] vs 60 [50–84], p = 0.78; SOFA = 9 vs 7.5, p = 0.19; diabetes: 30% vs 50%, p = 0.11 and cardiovascular diseases: 32.5% vs 60%, p = 0.37) in erythromycin versus placebo groups respectively. There was no difference on the time of occurrence of sepsis (6.5 [5–10] d vs 5.5 [2–16] d, p = 0.16) nor on the nosocomial nature (47,5% vs 58%, p = 0.37). No favorable effect of adding erythromycin in septic patients was found compared to placebo on mortality (45% vs 37.5%, p = 0.63) nor on the other parameters. Concerning the biomarkers, they were similar at baseline. At the end of the protocol, no difference was showed. In the intragroup analysis, both procalcitonin and CRP decreased significantly from day 0 to day 6 in the erythromycin arm (from 2.47 to 1.14 ug/l, p < 10–3 and from 172 to 109 mg/l, p = 0.001 respectively). In the placebo arm, only procalcitonin decreased (attached table). No conductive disorders or QT segment abnormalities were described in the erythromycin group.\n\nConclusion: the adjunction of erythromycin did not reduce mortality but it conducted to a better control of the inflammatory response, in particular the reduction of procalcitonin and CRP.\n\nCompliance with ethics regulations: Yes in clinical research.\n\nCO-10 Interest of early mobilization by cycloergometry in patients with septic shock\n\nGaëtan Béduneau1, Valentin Harter8, Emilie Occhiali1, Antoine Dewitte2, Thierry Boulain3, Richard Galliot4, Olivier Guisset5, Julien Charpentier6, Bertrand Rozec7, Baptiste Michaux1\n\n1CHU Charles Nicolle, Rouen, France; 2CHU Groupe Hospitalier Sud Haut Lévêque, Bordeaux, France; 3CHR, Orléans, France; 4Hôpital Foch, Suresnes, France ; 5CHU Saint André, Bordeaux, France; 6Hôpital Cochin, Service MIR, Groupe Hospitalier Paris Centre, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France; 7Hôpital Nord Laennec, Nantes, France; 8Centre François Baclesse, Caen, France\n\nCorrespondence: Baptiste Michaux (baptiste.michaux@chu-rouen.fr)\n\nRationale: Acquired weakness in intensive care unit (ICU), particularly favored by multi-organ failure caused by septic shock and prolonged bed rest, is responsible for an increase in duration of weaning from mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization and morbi-mortality. In addition to the usual physiotherapy, cycloergometry sessions are proposed. A recent meta-analysis however did not show superiority of these sessions (1). The main objective of this study was to determine impact on ICU length of stay in patients with septic shock of early mobilization by cycloergometer in association with standard physiotherapy.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: This is a prospective, randomized, open multicenter study, which included patients with a septic shock, invasive ventilation and sedation, hemodynamically stabilized. At inclusion, patients were randomized in intervention group (cycloergometer (20 min/day) added to standard physiotherapy) or in control group (standard physiotherapy alone). In both groups, physiotherapy started as soon as the patients were included and was adapted to the patient's condition. Patients were randomized a second time at the first lifting of sedation. This double randomization constituted a dataset for the endpoints analysis from hemodynamic stability to the first lifting of sedations (phase I) and another dataset for unbiased endpoints analysis from lifting of sedations to the discharge from ICU (phase II).\n\nResults: We included 119 patients in eight ICU, with median SAPS II and SOFA (ICU admission) of respectively 60 [95%RR 23.9–93.0] and 9 [95%RR 2.00–15.00]. Characteristics at inclusion were similar. We followed 109 patients until the cessation of sedation (Phase I). Then, we re-randomized 107 patients until ICU discharge (Phase II). There was no difference regarding length of stay in ICU at each phase between the two groups (Figure 1A, B). The phase I median duration is 4 days for both groups. For phase II, the median is 9 days [6–15] days for cycloergometer group and 12 [6–28] days for control group. Patients with standard physiotherapy during the two phases spent 20 days in ICU [11–66] versus 13 days [8–33] for patients with cycloergonometry in phase I and/or phase II (p = 0.052) (Figure 1C). Similarly, the median duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was significantly higher for patients without cycloergometry (14 vs 9 days, p = 0,04). Another abstract proposes the results concerning the safety and feasibility.\n\nConclusion: Although we did not show significant difference between groups, a trend emerges concerning the increase in the length of stay for patients who do not benefit from a cycloergometry in either of the two phases.\n\nReference 1\n\nTakaoka A, Utgikar R, Rochwerg B, Cook DJ, Kho ME.

Adverse events in relationship with pets include bites, infections and are increasing. Bacteria most frequently involved are Pasteurella, Bartonella, Tularemia, or Capnocytophaga. The goal of the PETSEPSIS study was to report characteristics, clinical symptoms and outcomes of patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission for infection transmitted by cats or dogs.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: PETSEPSIS was a retrospective multicenter study conducted in 46 ICUs in France. Consecutive adults admitted to the ICU from January 2009 to December 2019 for sepsis after bites by cats or dogs, or due to Pasteurella spp, Bartonella spp, Tularemia spp, or Capnocytophaga spp, were included. Data analysis was descriptive, and univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify risks factors of mortality.\n\nResults: 174 patients were included; median age was 64.5 years [50.3–73.7] and SAPSII score was 41.5 [28–57.5]. 51.2% of the patients were mechanically ventilated, 53.49% needed cardiovascular drugs, 18.97% renal replacement therapy and 3.6% had limbs amputation. Duration of mechanical ventilation was 7 [4–13] days. The length of stay in ICU was 7 days [4–16]. Hospital mortality was 24.1%. Clinical presentation or severity of sepsis did not vary with bacteria, except for infections due to Pasteurella spp, for which patients seem to be older and to have more comorbidities. Contacts with cats were more often reported in Pasteurella infections whereas contacts with dogs were more often reported in Capnocytophaga and Bartonella infections. Risks factors of death were older age, worse SAPSII score, bacteriemia, chronic alcohol abuse and chronic hepatic dysfunction, need for endotracheal ventilation, vasoactive drugs and renal replacement therapy. Initial antimicrobial therapy had no impact on outcome.\n\nConclusion: This is the first and largest multicenterobservational study on severe sepsis transmitted by cats or dogs. Mortality was associated with preexisting disease and severity of organ failure, and not with bacteria identified.\n\nCompliance with ethics regulations: Yes in clinical research.\n\nCO-12 Corticosteroids and mortality in septic shock complicated by the acute respiratory distresss syndrome\n\nNicholas Heming1, Alain Renault1, Emmanuelle Kuperminc1, Miguel Carlos1, Virginie Maxime1, Rania Bounab1, Pierre Moine1, Djillali Annane1\n\n1Hôpital Raymond Poincaré, Garches, France\n\nCorrespondence: Nicholas Heming (nicholas.heming@aphp.fr)\n\nAnnals of Intensive Care 2013, 13(Suppl 1):CO-012\n\nRationale: The role of corticosteroids in the management of non COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains controversial.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: The Activated Protein C and Corticosteroids for Human Septic Shock (APROCCHSS) trial was a placebo, controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of the corticosteroids hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone, in adults with septic shock. Patients with ARDS were identified a priori as a subgroup of interest. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Key secondary outcomes included mortality at intensive care unit (ICU) discharge, at hospital discharge, at day 28 and day 180 as well as mechanical ventilation free-days within 28 days.\n\nResults: Among 1241 APROCCHSS participants, 648 met the criteria for ARDS at the time of inclusion. In ARDS patients, the mean ± SD time between ICU admission and randomization was 2 ± 4 days. There were 155/320 (48.4%) deaths at day 90 in the corticosteroid arm and 186/328 (56.7%) in the placebo arm. The risk ratio (RR) for death at day 90 was 0.85 (95%CI: 0.74 to 0.99; P = 0.04) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.74 to 1.12; P = 0.36) in patients with and without ARDS, respectively (Breslow-Day homogeneity test P = 0.45). In the ARDS subset, the RR of dying was 0.83 (95%CI: 0.69 to 0.99; P = 0.04) at 28 day, 0.82 (95%CI: 0.70 to 0.97; P = 0.02) at ICU discharge, 0.84 (95%CI: 0.72 to 0.98; P = 0.03) at hospital discharge, and 0.87 (95%CI: 0.76 to 1.00; P = 0.05) at day 180. In the ARDS subset, there was no significant difference regarding ventilator free days 8 ± 10 vs. 7 ± 9 in the corticosteroid vs placebo arm (P = 0.24).\n\nConclusion: The effects of hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone on 90-day mortality are consistent in septic shock with and without early ARDS.\n\nReference 1\n\nAnnane D et al.

However, airway pressures might not reflect the actual pressure applied to the lung. Transpulmonary pressure is the difference between airway pressure and pleural pressure, the latter is estimated by the esophageal pressure (1). This technique and measurements had been validated, initially, in healthy patients in half-sitting position, and then confirmed in different positions (2). Few studies have evaluated the impact of patient positioning on pleural pressure and transpulmonary pressure in intubated patients with ARDS. We aimed to assess the changes in esophageal and transpulmonary pressures at different positions (supine at 0° and semi-recumbent at 45°) in intubated patients with ARDS.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: Single-center, prospective study performed in a medical ICU of a tertiary care center. All patients diagnosed with ARDS in the study period and monitored with an esophageal catheter were included. We collected end-expiratory and end-inspiratory esophageal pressures, airway pressures and intra-abdominal pressure at the two positions. Inspiratory transpulmonary pressure was calculated using the elastance ratio method. Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was not modified and remained at the level set by the clinician in charge of the patient. Comparisons of values at 0° and 45° were performed using paired Wilcoxon tests.\n\nResults: We included 36 patients admitted from January to August 2022. Their median (IQR) age, SOFA score and SAPS II were 63 years (58–72), 9 (5–12) and 52 (33–69) respectively and 77% were men. Twenty-nine of them (80%) were intubated for pneumonia including seven positive to SARS-CoV2 (19%). Their median PaO2/FiO2 on the day of intubation was 96 (72–111) mmHg and 33 (92%) had moderate or severe ARDS. At the time of measurement, set and total PEEP were 12 [10;14] and 13 [11;15] cmH2O respectively. Comparisons of the airway pressures, esophageal pressures and transpulmonary pressures are shown in Table 1. Intra-abdominal pressure also significantly increased from 10 [7;13] to 20 [16;25] cmH2O when changing position from 0° to 45° (p = 0.001).\n\nConclusion: Keeping PEEP stable and changing the patient position from supine at 0° to semi-recumbent at 45° significantly increases all airway pressures and decreases the esophageal pressure. The relative changes led to a non-significant increase in transpulmonary plateau pressure but a significant increase all transpulmonary pressures (end-inspiratory; end-expiratory) and driving pressures.\n\nReference 1\n\nCoudroy R, Chen L, Pham T, Piraino T, Telias I, Brochard L.

Setting external positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) regarding the presence of a CAC and the level of airway opening pressure (AOP) is still debated. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of CAC in ventilated-ARDS patients and its evolution over time.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: We conducted a bicentric study including all adult patients with moderate or severe ARDS between August 2021 and August 2022. We detected Complete airway closure and measured airway opening pressure using low-flow pressure–volume curve (from PEEP 0 cmH2O) every day, in the absence of patient’s inspiratory effort.\n\nResults: Here are preliminary data of 25 patients, corresponding to 89 PV curves. The prevalence of CAC with AOP > 5 cmH2O was 32% (8/25 patients) and 2 patients (6%) developed once during the follow up. The median AOP was 5.3 cmH2O on day 1, 6.2 cmH2O on day 2, and 4.7 cmH2O on day 3. The average weight gain during the follow-up was significantly higher in patients with CAC compared to those without CAC (8.0 [0.5–16.5] kg vs. 1.5 [0.0–9.0] kg, p = 0.019). CAC with an AOP > 5 cmH2O was more common in patients with focal than in non-focal ARDS (50% vs. 6%, p = 0.025).\n\nConclusion: The CAC is a frequent and dynamic phenomenon in ARDS patients. The occurrence of CAC seems to be influenced by hydrolytic balance and chest CT pattern. Repeated measurements seem to be a requisite for personalized lung protective ventilation.\n\nCompliance with ethics regulations: Yes in clinical research.\n\nCO-15 Prone positioning effects on oxygenation and respiratory mechanics according to the R/I ratio in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome\n\nCassilia Dei1, Laurent Bitker2, Driss Laghlam3, Nicolas Bele4, Alexandre Robert5, Raphaël Devanlay5, Giovanni Bousquet6, Antoine Goury7, Hervé Hyvernat1, Clément Saccheri1, Jean Dellamonica1, Lucas Morand1, Mathieu Jozwiak1\n\n1CHU de Nice, Nice, France; 2Hôpital de la Croix Rousse, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France; 3Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, site COCHIN, Paris, France; 4Centre hospitalier de la Dracénie, Draguignan, France; 5CH de Cannes Simone Veil, Cannes, France; 6Hôpitaux Universitaire de Marseille Nord-APHM, Marseille, France; 7Hôpital Maison Blanche-CHU de Reims, Reims, France\n\nCorrespondence: Cassilia Dei (cassilia.dei@live.fr)\n\nAnnals of Intensive Care 2013, 13(Suppl 1):CO-015\n\nRationale: A non-invasive method called \"Recruitment to inflation ratio\" (R/I ratio), has been proposed to assess the potential of recruitment in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and then to titrate and personalize the level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to ensure lung recruitment while limiting lung hyperinflation. Prone positioning (PP) is recommended in most severe patients with ARDS. The effects of PP on oxygenation and respiratory mechanics according to the R/I ratio remain to be determined.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: This multicenter and prospective study was conducted in 7 French intensive care units and included patients with ARDS requiring prone positioning. The R/I ratio as well as oxygenation parameters and respiratory mechanics were recorded just before and during the 16-h PP session and after supine repositioning. The respiratory rate, the PEEP level and the inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) remained unchanged during the study period. The median R/I ratio before PP in our cohort was used to classify patients as high and low recruiters.\n\nResults: Overall, 41 patients were included: 24 (58%) were men, the median age was 63 (57–70) years old and 32 (78%) had ARDS related to SARS-CoV-2 pneumoniae. The median R/I was 0.50 (0.30–0.84): R/I ratio was 0.24 (0.06–0.35) in low recruiters and 0.83 (0.58–1.00) in high recruiters (p < 0.001). Baseline characteristics, partial arterial pressure of oxygen over FiO2 (PaO2/FiO2) ratio, partial arterial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and respiratory mechanics did not significantly differ between high and low recruiters. In high recruiters, PP induced a significant decrease in R/I ratio (p < 0.0001) and increase in PaO2/FiO2 ratio p < 0.0001), while the driving pressure, the compliance of the respiratory system and PaCO2 were unchanged. The PP-induced decrease in R/I ratio persisted after supine repositioning, while the PP-induced increase in PaO2/FiO2 diminished as early as 2 h after supine repositioning but the PaO2/FiO2 ratio did not differ between 2 and 4 h after supine repositioning. In low recruiters, PP induced a significant increase in PaO2/FiO2 ratio (p < 0.0001), while the R/I ratio, the driving pressure, the compliance of the respiratory system and PaCO2 were unchanged. As in high recruiters, the PP-induced increase in PaO2/FiO2 diminished as early as 2 h after supine repositioning but the PaO2/FiO2 ratio did not differ between 2 and 4 h after supine repositioning.\n\nConclusion: The effects of PP on oxygenation and respiratory mechanics appear to differ in high and low recruiters.

Prospective observational EVALPRO Study\n\nChristopher Lai1, Rui Shi1, Ludwig Jelinski1, Florian Lardet1, Marta Fasan1, Hugo Belotti1, Nicolas Biard1, Laurent Guérin1, Nicolas Fage1, Quentin Fosse1, Thibaut Gobé1, Arthur Pavot1, Guillaume Roger1, Alex Yhuel1, Tai Pham1, Jean-Louis Teboul1, Xavier Monnet1\n\n1Hôpital Bicêtre, Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, France\n\nCorrespondence: Christopher Lai (christopher.lai@aphp.fr)\n\nAnnals of Intensive Care 2013, 13(Suppl 1):CO-016\n\nRationale: One of the beneficial respiratory effects of prone position in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome related to Coronavirus disease 2019 (C-ARDS) could be secondary to improvement in lung mechanics. However, these improvements are inconstant. The objective of the study was to investigate whether an improvement of the compliance of the respiratory system (Crs) and reduction of the driving pressure at the end of a prone position session could be predicted by the potential of lung recruitment at baseline in supine position.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: In this prospective, observational, monocentric study in patients who underwent prone position for C-ARDS, from January to May 2021, respiratory variables were assessed just before prone positioning and at the end of the session. Respiratory variables included mechanical ventilation settings and variables of respiratory mechanics, including the recruitment-to-inflation ratio (R/I), an estimate of the potential of lung recruitment compared to lung overinflation.\n\nResults: In 41 patients, 156 prone position sessions lasting 18.9 ± 2.7 h, were evaluated. Mortality at day 60 was 49%. Neuromuscular blockade agents were used in 91(58%) sessions. At baseline, tidal volume was 6.1 ± 0.5 mL/kg of predicted body weight, PEEP was 14 ± 3 cmH2O and plateau pressure was 29 ± 4 cmH2O. The median of the R/I ratio was 0.53 (0.31–0.79), separating low- and high-recruiters. The airway opening pressure was present in 76 (49%) patients and was 6 (5–9) cmH2O in these patients. At the end of the prone position session PaO2/FiO2 increased from 111 ± 31 mmHg to 165 ± 67 mmHg (p < 0.001), with an increase > 20 mmHg in 96 (62%) sessions. The driving pressure decreased from 14.3 ± 4.4 to 13.7 ± 4.7 cmH2O (p = 0.045) and Crs increased from 32 ± 11 to 34 ± 11 (p = 0.037) ml/cmH2O. Whereas the PaO2/FiO2 improved to the same extent in both low- and high-recruiters, driving pressure and Crs improved only in high-recruiters (from 14 ± 4 to 12 ± 4, p = 0.027, and from 34 ± 11 to 38 ± 13, p = 0.014, respectively).\n\nConclusion: Whereas oxygenation improves to the same extent in low- and high-recruiters with prone position in patients with C-ARDS, driving pressure and Crs improve only in high-recruiter patients. The benefits of prone position could be thus even greater in these patients.\n\nCompliance with ethics regulations: Yes in clinical research.\n\nCO-17 Physiological Effects of Volume Assist Control, Pressure Regulated Volume Control and Airway Pressure Release Ventilation at post-acute phase of acute respiratory distress syndrome\n\nMathilde Taillantou-Candau1, Alice Vuillermoz1, Mathilde Lefranc1,2, Elise Yvin1, Arnaud Lesimple1,2, Antonin Courtais1, Dara Chean1, Bertrand Pavlovsky1, Alain Mercat1, Jean-Christophe Richard1,2, François Beloncle1\n\n1Vent’Lab, Medical Intensive Care Unit, University Hospital of Angers, University of Angers, Angers, France; 2Med2Lab, Antony, France\n\nCorrespondence: Mathilde Taillantou-Candau (m.taillantou@gmail.com)\n\nAnnals of Intensive Care 2013, 13(Suppl 1):CO-017\n\nRationale: The optimal ventilation mode after the early phase of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) when spontaneous ventilation (SV) is resumed is still debated. Volume Assist Control (VAC) is the most frequently used mode, but Pressure regulated volume control (PRVC) has been proposed to limit dyspnea and asynchrony and Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV), a non-synchronized mode, has been suggested to decrease the risk of ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) and improve compliance, gas exchange and respiratory variability. We hypothesized that APRV may promote SV and respiratory variability without altering gas exchange, dyspnea and respiratory effort.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: In this prospective, cross-over study, APRV, PRVC and VAC were randomly applied as soon as SV reached 20 to 30% of minute ventilation. For each mode, the ventilator was set to obtain similar positive end-expiratory pressure, tidal volume and respiratory rate. Airway and esophageal pressure and volume distribution in electrical impedance tomography (EIT) were continuously recorded. Gas exchange, hemodynamics, dyspnea (IC-RDOS score), P0.1 and pressure–time product (PTP) were assessed at the end of application of each mode. Tidal volume and PTP variability were assessed by the respective coefficients of variation (standard deviation divided by the mean value).\n\nResults: Twenty ARDS patients were included and data were analyzed in 19 patients (one patient discontinued the study because of clinical deterioration). Main ARDS cause was pneumonia in 17 patients (89%). The duration of ventilatory support was 12 (5–19) days before inclusion. Minute ventilation did not differ between the three modes. Sedative drugs were unchanged during the study and RASS (Richmond agitation sedation scale) was similar among the three modes. Gas exchange, hemodynamics, IC-RDOS score, ventilation distribution, P0.1 and PTP did not significantly differ among the three modes. Tidal volume variability was significantly higher in APRV than in VAC and PRVC, PTP variability was significantly higher in APRV than in VAC but did not differ between APRV and PRVC.\n\nConclusion: When SV is resumed after the early phase of ARDS, gas exchange, hemodynamics, dyspnea and respiratory effort did not differ among APRV, VAC and PRVC. Respiratory variability was higher in APRV than in VAC but did not differ between APRV and PRVC.\n\nCompliance with ethics regulations: Yes in clinical research.\n\nCO-18 Acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with hematological malignancies: a nationwide cohort study\n\nPierre-Nicolas Bris1, Sami Hraiech1, Vanessa Pauly3, Veronica Orleans3, Laurent Boyer2\n\n1CHU Nord-Assistance publique des Hôpitaux de Marseille, Marseille, France; 2Faculté de médecine Timone, Marseille, France; 3CHU Conception-Assistance publique des Hôpitaux de Marseille, Marseille, France\n\nCorrespondence: Pierre-Nicolas Bris (pierrenicolasbris@free.fr)\n\nAnnals of Intensive Care 2013, 13(Suppl 1):CO-018\n\nRationale: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurring in patients with hematological malignancies (HM) is a life-threatening condition with specific features. Mortality rate remains high but improvement has been described over the past several years. We aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes of ARDS in HM patients admitted during one year in French ICUs (Intensive Care Units).\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: Data for this nationwide cohort study were collected from the French national hospital database (Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d’Information (PMSI)). All patients (18 years or older) admitted to French ICUs in 2017 and with an ICD-10 diagnosis of ARDS were included. Diagnosis of HM or solid cancer was detected using an algorithm provided by the Institut National du Cancer (INCa). Three groups were determined and compared according to the presence of an HM, a solid cancer or absence of cancer. Primary endpoint was ARDS mortality (in ICU or at day 90). Secondary endpoints were ICU characteristics (duration of mechanical ventilation, prone positioning, the use of high flow nasal cannula or vasopressors, the use of renal replacement therapy), ARDS characteristics (associated infections) and mortality predictors.\n\nResults: A total of 12 846 ARDS patients were included. Among them, 990 had HM and 2744 had a solid cancer. The main malignancies were non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (28.5%), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (20.4%) and multiple myeloma (19.7%). Day-90 mortality in patients with HM was higher than patients with no cancer (64.4% vs 46.6% p = 0.0001) but there was no significant difference when comparing to patients with solid cancer (64.4% vs 61.4%, p = 0.091). Intubation rate was lower in patients with HM in comparison with both groups (87.7% vs 90.4% p = 0.017 for patients with solid cancer and 87.7% vs 91.3% p = 0.0002 with no cancer) and SAPSII at admission was higher in this population (49 vs 42.3 p < 0.0001 in solid cancer patients and 49 vs 42.7 p < 0.0001 in no cancer patients). Independent predictors of mortality for patients with HM were a diagnosis of NHL or AML, age, a high SAPS II score, a renal replacement therapy and a septic shock. Bacterial pneumonia and extrapulmonary sepsis causing ARDS were protective.\n\nConclusion: Mortality remains high in patients with HM admitted in ICU with ARDS but patients’ and ARDS characteristics evolved in comparison of older studies.\n\nCompliance with ethics regulations: Yes in clinical research.\n\nCO-19 Relationship between Arterial Oxygen and Mortality Across Critically Ill Patients with Hematologic Malignancies: result from an international collaborative network\n\nGuillaume Dumas1,4, Virginie Lemiale2, Idunn Morris4,8, Alexandre Demoule3, Geeta Mehta4, Sean Bagshaw7, Tamishta Hensman 8, Achille Kouatchet 6, Bruno Ferreyro4, Djamel Mokart5, Elie Azoulay2, Laveena Munshi4\n\n1CHU Grenoble, La Tronche, France; 2Hôpital Saint-Louis, APHP, Paris, France; 3Hôpital la Pitié Salpêtrière, Paris, France; 4Mount Sinaï Hospital, Toronto, Canada; 5IPC, Marseille, France; 6CHU Angers, Angers, France; 7Université d'Alberta, Edmonton, CANADA; 8ANZICS, Sidney, Australia\n\nCorrespondence: Guillaume Dumas (GDumasgalant@chu-grenoble.fr)\n\nAnnals of Intensive Care 2013, 13(Suppl 1):CO-019\n\nRationale: Patients with hematological malignancies are at high risk for life-threatening complications. In this context, most of the studies have focused on the initial oxygenation strategy but little attention has been paid to the impact of hyperoxemia and excess oxygen use in this population. We sought to investigate the impact of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) and administered oxygen (FiO2) on day-28 mortality in critically ill patients with hematologic malignancies.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: Clinical and oxygenation data from three international cohorts (Europe, Canada, Oceania) of critically-ill patients with hematologic malignancies who required respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula, or invasive mechanical ventilation) were obtained. We descriptively evaluated the incidence of normoxemia (paO2 between 60-120 mmHg), hypoxemia (paO2 ≤ 60) and hyperoxemia (paO2 ≥ 120). The association between PaO2 on day 1 and 28 days-mortality was first modeled using a restricted cubic spline. We used mixed-effect Cox models to estimate the effect of hyperoxemia and excess oxygen use (defined as a FiO2 ≥ 0.6 with a PaO2 > 100 mmHg on day 1 of ICU admission) on day-28 mortality.\n\nResults: 11,249 patients were included in the analysis. On day 1, 6911 patients (61.4%) had normoxemia, 1454 (12.9%) hypoxemia, and 2884 patients (25.6%) hyperoxemia. The crude day-28 mortality rate was 40.6%. Excess oxygen use was noticed in 2,201 patients (20 After adjustment, there was a significant association between PaO2 and day-28 mortality which demonstrated a U-shape relationship (p < 0.001). We found an independent association between day-1 excess oxygen use and subsequent day-28 mortality (aHR: 1.11[1.03–1.20], p-value = 0.006). On a propensity-matched analysis (n = 4,402 patients), excess oxygen use remained associated with day-28 mortality (HR:1.27[1.16–1.39], p-value < 0.001). In subgroup analysis, higher PaO2 values were associated with poor outcomes in patients admitted with neurological disorders or cardiac arrest contrary to those with sepsis.\n\nConclusion: In critically-ill patients with hematological malignancies, excess oxygen use, and high PaO2 exposure on day 1 were associated with increased mortality. These results suggest a new way to potentially improve cancer patients’ prognosis and should be confirmed in the future.\n\nCompliance with ethics regulations: Yes in clinical research.\n\nCO-20 Prognosis of critically ill allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation recipients: data from 1164 patients included in 14 French intensive care units\n\nAntoine Lafarge1, Thibault Dupont1, Adrien Joseph1, Naike Bigé2, Jean-Herlé Raphalen3, Julien Mayaux4, Djamel Mokart5, Anne Renault6, Anne-Sophie Moreau7, Emmanuel Canet8, Laura Platon9, Nahema Issa10, Muriel Picard11, Florent Wallet12, Olfa Mghirbi1, Frédéric Pène13, Elie Azoulay1\n\n1Hôpital Saint Louis, Paris, France; 2Hôpital Saint Antoine, Paris, France; 3Hôpital Necker, Paris, France; 4Hôpital Pitié Salpêtrière, Paris, France; 5Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France; 6CHU Brest, Brest, France; 7CHU Lille, Lille, France; 8CHU Nantes, Nantes, France; 9CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France; 10CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France; 11CHU Toulouse, Toulouse, France; 12CHU Lyon, Lyon, France; 13Hôpital Cochin, Paris, France\n\nCorrespondence: Antoine Lafarge (antoine.lafarge@aphp.fr)\n\nAnnals of Intensive Care 2013, 13(Suppl 1):CO-20\n\nRationale: Despite notable changes in the practice of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) in the past years, intensive care unit (ICU) admission is still associated with poor outcome in recipients. Since multicenter longitudinal data on this topic remain scarce, we analyzed reasons for ICU admission, critical care management as well as short- and long-term outcome of critically-ill Allo-HSCT recipients.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: The medical records of Allo-HSCT recipients admitted to 14 French ICU during a 6-year period from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) trajectory prior to ICU admission was specifically assessed.\n\nResults: Data from 1164 Allo-HSCT recipients admitted to the ICU during the study period were analyzed. Median age at ICU admission was 56.4 [42.7–63.6] years, 61.4% were male. Median time from Allo-HSCT to ICU admission was 84 [15–369] days and 463 (39.8%) patients were transferred to the ICU during the engraftment period. Respiratory dysfunction (461 patients, 39.6%) and shock (228 patients, 19.6%) were the main reasons for ICU admission. Seventy-nine (6.8%) patients were admitted for acute kidney injury. Median SOFA at ICU admission was 6.0 [4.0–8.0]. Six hundred and eight (52.2%) patients displayed ≥ 1 infection(s) during the ICU stay, including opportunistic infections in 228 (37.5%) patients. In the whole cohort, 221 (19.0%) patients underwent renal replacement therapy, 478 (41.1%) received vasopressors and 440 (37.8%) required mechanical ventilation. Eight hundred and sixty-two (74.1%) patients could be discharged alive from the ICU and 590 (57.4%) from the hospital. Day-90, 1-year and 3-year survival rates were 54.1%, 41.3% and 33.8% respectively (Figure 1). Age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.02 [1.01–1.03]; P < 0.001), glucocorticoid-refractory GVHD (HR 1.46 [1.22–1.75]; P < 0.001), male sex (HR 1.50 [1.14–1.98]; P < 0.001), glucocorticoids posology (HR 1.61 [1.18–2.18]; P < 0.001), vasopressors (HR 1.70 [1.27–2.29]; P < 0.001), mechanical ventilation (HR 2.67 [1.95–3.64]; P < 0.001) and renal replacement therapy (HR 3.66 [2.48–5.42]; P < 0.001) were independent predictive factors of day-90 mortality.\n\nConclusion: In Allo-HSCT recipients, ICU admission remains associated with a dismal prognosis. Beyond host factors, glucocorticoid-refractory aGVHD and organ dysfunctions requiring live sustaining therapies are the major determinants of death. Further analyses are warranted to stratify Allo-HSCT recipients based on a high risk of mortality and identify patients for whom critical care management may be aggressive but nonbeneficial.\n\nCompliance with ethics regulations: Yes in clinical research.\n\nCO-21 Cardiogenic shock in patients with malignancies: a multicenter retrospective study: the CARTOON Study\n\nMickael Lescroart1, Helene Kemp1, Olivier Imauven2, Jean Herlé Raphalen2, Laurent Argaud3, Hamid Merdji4, Guillaume Morel5, Emmanuel Canet6, Julien Schmidt7, Guillaume Lacave8, Francois Bagate11, Guillaume Louis9, Bruno Mourvillier12, Fabienne Tamion14, Maxens Decavele13, Florent Wallet15, Hadrien Winiszewski16, Nahema Issa17, Anne-Sophie Moreau18, Natacha Maquigneau19, Audrey De Jong20, Alexandre Lautrette21, Elia Azoulay1, Guillaume Dumas1, Lara Zafrani1\n\n1Hôpital Saint Louis, Paris, France; 2Adult Intensive Care Unit, Necker-Enfants-Malades University Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France; 3Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hôpital Edouard Herriot, Service de Médecine Intensive-Réanimation, 5, Place d'Arsonval, Lyon, France; 4Hôpitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Service de Médecine Intensive Réanimation, Nouvel Hôpital Civil, 1, place de l'Hôpital, Strasbourg, France; 5Service d'hématologie et d'oncologie, Hôpitaux universitaires de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France; 6Medecine Intensive Réanimation, University Hospital Center, Nantes, France; 7Unité de médecine intensive et réanimation, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Avicenne Hospital, Groupe Hospitalier Paris Seine Saint-Denis, Bobigny, France; 8Medico-Surgical Intensive Care Department, Centre Hospitalier de Versailles, Site André Mignot, Le Chesnay, Versailles, France; 9Médecine Intensive et réanimation, Centre hospitalier Régional Metz-Thionville, Mercy Hospital, 1 allée du château, Metz, France; 10Service de Réanimation Médicale, Normandie Univ, UNIROUEN, U1096, CHU de Rouen, Rouen, France; 11Service de Médecine Intensive Réanimation, AP-HP, CHU Henri Mondor, DHU A-TVB, 51, avenue du Mal de Lattre de Tassigny, Créteil, France; 12Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire de Reims (CHU), Hôpital Robert-Debré, Service de Réanimation médicale, Reims, France; 13APHP, Groupe Hospitalier Universitaire APHP-Sorbonne Université, site Pitié-Salpêtrière, Service Médecine Intensive et Réanimation (Département R3S), Paris, France; 14Service de Réanimation Médicale, Normandie Univ, UNIROUEN, U1096, CHU de Rouen, Rouen, France; 15Médecine Intensive et Réanimation, Hôpital Lyon Sud, Pierre-Bénite, Lyon, France; 16Médecine Intensive et Réanimation, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Besançon, Besançon, France; 17Réanimation médicale, groupe hospitalier Saint-André, 1, rue Jean-Burguet, 33075 Bordeaux cedex, France; Médecine interne et maladies infectieuses, groupe hospitalier Saint-André, 1, rue Jean-Burguet, Bordeaux, France; 18CHU de Lille, hôpital Salengro, service de médecine intensive réanimation, rue Emile-Laine, Lille, France; 19Service Medico-Chirurgical, Unité de soins intensifs, Centre Hospitalier de La Roche-sur-Yon, La Roche Sur Yon, France; 20Médecine intensive et réanimation, Département d’Anesthésie et soins critiques Hôpital Saint-Éloi, CHU de Montpellier, INSERM U1046, 80, Avenue Augustin Fliche, Montpellier, France; 21Medical Intensive Care Unit, Gabriel-Montpied University Hospital, Clermont-Ferrand, France\n\nCorrespondence: Mickael Lescroart (dr.lescroart@gmail.com)\n\nAnnals of Intensive Care 2013, 13(Suppl 1):CO-21\n\nRationale: Despite significant advancements in oncology/hematology over the past decades, cancer patients (CP) continue to face a significant cardiovascular (CV) burden due to both their malignancy and the toxicity of anti-cancer therapy. No data is currently available regarding the characteristics and outcomes of cancer patients (CP) admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) for cardiogenic shock (CS). We aimed to provide a contemporary cohort of cardiogenic shock in CP and determine risk factors associated with ICU mortality.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: 214 oncological patients with CS from 21 French ICUs were included between 2010 and 2022. Clinical data were extracted from medical records. The primary outcome was overall ICU survival. Secondary outcomes were the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), mechanical ventilation, and ICU length of stay. Risk factors for ICU mortality were determined through logistic regression.\n\nResults: Hemopathy (68.7%) was the most represented type of malignancy. CV risk factors were prevalent as one third of patients had a history of smoking or hypertension. The overall ICU mortality was 50% with a 37-days median survival. One hundred sixty-eight patients (78.5%) required vasopressor therapy, 140 (65.7%) mechanical ventilation and 52 (24.9%) renal replacement therapy. Independent risk factors for ICU mortality were: mechanical ventilation (OR 2.55 [1.16–5.72], p = 0.02), vasopressor therapy (OR 3.36 [1.15–11.31], p = 0.03), home medication with renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (OR 2.84 [1.06–8.17], p = 0.04), and the inotropic drug (OR for dobutamine, versus epinephrine: 0.27 [0.08–0.78], p = 0.02). Thirteen patients (6.0%) required VA-ECMO with similar survival rates (n = 7/13, p = 0.95). Among patients alive at discharge, the median survival was 418 days.\n\nConclusion: The prognosis of cancer patients admitted in ICU for cardiogenic shock remains poor with a high mortality rate and frequent need for invasive organ support. The population that could benefit from intensive care has yet to be determined.\n\nCompliance with ethics regulations: Yes in clinical research.\n\nCO-22 Do renin-angiotensin system blockers impact on the prognosis of critically ill cancer patients?\n\nDriss Laghlam1, Anis Chaba1, Tarneaud Matthias1, Julien Charpentier1, Jean-Paul Mira1, Frédéric Pène1, Clara Vigneron1\n\n1Hôpital Cochin, Paris, France\n\nCorrespondence: Clara Vigneron (claravigneron@hotmail.fr)\n\nAnnals of Intensive Care 2013, 13(Suppl 1):CO-22\n\nRationale: Increasing evidence argue for promotion of tumorigenesis through activation of renin-angiotensin system pathway. Accordingly, a benefit of renin-angiotensin system blockers (RABs) treatments has been suggested in patients with solid cancers in terms of survival. Our study aims to evaluate in-ICU survival and one-year survival in cancer patients admitted to the ICU with respect to the use of RABs.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective observational single-center study in a 24-bed medical ICU. Consecutive adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with a diagnosis of solid tumour (previously known or diagnosed during the ICU stay) requiring unplanned ICU admission were included.\n\nResults: From 2007 to 2020, 1845 patients with solid malignancies were admitted (median age 67 years [59–75], males 61,7%). The most frequent primary tumor sites were the gastrointestinal tract (26.8%), the lung (24.7%), the urological tract (20.1%), and gynecologic and breast cancers (13.9%). RABs were used in 414 patients, distributed into 220 (53.1%) with angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) and 194 (46.9%) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi). After adjustment in a multivariate model, ARBs use (OR = 0.62 (0.40–0.92), p = 0.03) and ACEi use (OR = 0.52, 95%CI (0.32–0.82), p = 0.006) were both associated with improved in-ICU survival (Figure 1). Treatment with ARBs was independently associated with decreased one-year mortality (OR = 0.6 95% CI (0.4–0.9), p = 0.02), whereas treatment with ACEi was not (Figure 1).\n\nConclusion: The use of ARBs, but not of ACEi, is associated with improved one-year survival in patients with solid malignancies admitted to the ICU.\n\nCompliance with ethics regulations: Yes in clinical research.Whole cohort survival analysis\n\nCO-23 ICU-acquired major bleeding events in critically ill patients with haematological malignancies\n\nClément Devautour1, Clara Vigneron1, Julien Charpentier1, Sandrine Valade2, Matthieu Jamme3, Frédéric Pene1\n\n1Hôpital Cochin, APHP, Paris, France; 2Hôpital Saint Louis, APHP, Paris, France; 3Hôpital Privé de l’ouest Parisien, Ramsay Générale de Santé, Paris, France\n\nCorrespondence: Clément Devautour (cdevautour@gmail.com)\n\nAnnals of Intensive Care 2013, 13(Suppl 1):CO-23\n\nRationale: Bleeding events are common complications in critically ill patients with haematological malignancies. We aimed to describe acquired major bleeding events during their ICU stay.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: We conducted an observational monocenter retrospective study including all adult patients with a history of haematological malignancy requiring unplanned ICU admission over a 12-year period (2007–2018). Non-inclusion criteria were the following: admission to secure a procedure, planned admissions following elective surgery and patients with haematological malignancies cured for more than 5 years. Endpoints were major bleeding events (WHO classification grade 3–4) acquired during their ICU stay.\n\nResults: A total of 1012 patients (age = 65 [55–76] years) were included. The main haematological malignancies were non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 339, 33.5%), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 183, 18.1%), and multiple myeloma (n = 171, 16.9%). Most patients were recently diagnosed (n = 339, 33.5%) or in progression under treatment (n = 262, 25.9%). Five hundred ninety-six (58.9%) patients were under treatment. The leading causes of admission were circulatory (n = 347, 34.2%) and acute respiratory failures (n = 287, 28.4%). Among them, 109 (10.8%) presented at least one episode of acquired major bleeding event in the ICU, mainly gastrointestinal (n = 45, 41.3%), airway (n = 13, 11.9%) and vascular catheter (n = 13, 11.9%) bleeding events. Compared to patients without haemorrhagic event, they were more likely to have been admitted to the ICU for acute kidney injury (56.9% vs. 38.1% vs p < 0.001) and haemorrhagic event (28.4% vs 2.5%, p < 0.001). Biological exams performed at ICU admission showed multiple alterations in coagulation measurements including decreased platelet count (54 vs 80 G/L, p = 0.002), prolonged prothrombin time (62.0 vs 72.5%, p < 0.001) and increased activated partial thromboplastin ratio (1.25 vs 1.18, p = 0.002), acute kidney dysfunction as assessed by increased urea (10.6 vs 8.7 mmol/L, p = 0.011) and creatinine levels (129.0 vs 102.5 µmol/L, p = 0.007), lower albumin level (23.0 vs 28.0 g/L, p = 0.026) and increased bilirubin level (17.0 vs 12.0 µmol/L, p < 0.001). They required more frequently invasive mechanical ventilation (85.3% vs 43.4%, p < 0.001), inotropes/vasopressors (67.9% vs 32.6%, p < 0.001) or renal replacement therapy (46.8% vs 21.5%, p < 0.001) during their ICU stay. Accordingly, they exhibited poorer prognosis: ICU, hospital and one-year mortality rates were 55.0% vs 18.0% (p < 0.001), 59.6% vs 23.7% (p < 0.001) and 80.4% vs 54.7% (p < 0.001), respectively.\n\nConclusion: In patients with haematological malignancies, ICU-acquired major bleeding events are associated with acute kidney injury and recent history of bleeding event. Our study revealed biological disturbances associated with those events. Patients developing major bleeding events exhibit a dismal short and long-term prognosis.\n\nCompliance with ethics regulations: Yes in clinical research.\n\nCO-24 Electroencephalography for prognostication of outcome in adults with severe herpes simplex encephalitis\n\nLina Jeantin1, Claire Dupuis2, Geoffroy Vellieux3, Pierre Jaquet4, Etienne De Montmollin5, Jean-François Timsit5, Romain Sonneville5\n\n1GHU Psychiatrie et neurosciences, Paris, France; 2Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital, Clermont-Ferrand, France; 3Pitié-Salpêtrière University Hospital, Paris, France ; 4Delafontaine Hospital, Saint Denis, France; 5Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France\n\nCorrespondence: Lina Jeantin (lina.jeantin@aphp.fr)\n\nAnnals of Intensive Care 2013, 13(Suppl 1):CO-24\n\nRationale: Electroencephalography (EEG) is recommended for the practical approach to the diagnosis and prognosis of encephalitis. We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of standard EEG (stdEEG) in adult patients with severe herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE).\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive ICU patients with severe HSE in 38 French centers between 2006 and 2016. Patients with at least one stdEEG study performed at ICU admission were included. stdEEG findings were reviewed independently by two investigators. The association between stdEEG findings (i.e., background activity, lateralized periodic discharges, seizures/status epilepticus, and reactivity to painful/auditory stimuli) and poor functional outcome, defined by a score on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 3 to 6 (moderate to severe disability or death) at 90 days, were investigated.\n\nResults: We included 214 patients with at least one available stdEEG study. The first stdEEG was performed after a median time of one (IQR 0 to 2) day from ICU admission. At the time of recording, 138 (64.5%) patients were under invasive mechanical ventilation. Lateralized periodic discharges were recorded in 91 (42.5%) patients, seizures in 21 (9.8%) and status epilepticus in 16 (7.5%). In the whole population, reactivity to auditory/noxious stimuli was tested in 140/214 (65.4%) patients and was absent in 71/140 (33.2%) cases. In mechanically ventilated patients, stdEEG reactivity was tested in 91/138 (65.9%) subjects, and was absent in 53/91 (58.2%) cases. Absence of reactivity was the only independent stdEEG finding associated with poor functional outcome in the whole population (OR 2.80, 95%CI 1.19 to 6.58) and in the subgroup of mechanically ventilated patients (OR 4.99, 95%CI 1.6 to 15.59). adjusted analyses for common clinical predictors of outcome and sedation at time of stdEEG revealed similar findings in the whole population (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.49) and in mechanically ventilated patients (OR 2.62, 95%CI 1.25 to 5.50).\n\nDiscussion: The lack of EEG reactivity to external stimuli in critically ill patients with HSE is associated with poor outcome, independently from the presence of sedation and common clinical prognostic factors in this population (including age, coma, and fever at admission). To date, little data is available about the prognostic value of stdEEG and our study assembled one of the largest cohorts of patients with HSE requiring ICU admission to assess the value of stdEEG markers for functional outcome.\n\nConclusion: Absence of stdEEG reactivity to auditory/noxious stimuli is an independent marker of poor functional outcome in severe herpes simplex encephalitis.\n\nReference 1\n\nENCEPHALITICA study group, Jaquet P, de Montmollin E, Dupuis C, Sazio C, Conrad M, et al.

To investigate the association of neurological complications diagnosed on admission neuroimaging with functional outcomes of adults with severe pneumococcal meningitis, requiring care in the intensive care unit (ICU).\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: We performed a retrospective multicenter study in 11 centers in France, between February 2005 and September 2021. We included consecutive adults with pneumococcal meningitis who required at least 48 h of ICU stay and who underwent neuroimaging assessment. Neurological complications were defined as 1) ischemic stroke, 2) intracranial hemorrhage (i.e. intracerebral hematoma, subdural hematoma, or subarachnoid hemorrhage), 3) abscess/empyema, 4) ventriculitis, 5) thrombophlebitis, 6) hydrocephalus, and 7) cerebral oedema on neuroimaging at admission. Exposure: Neuroimaging at admission. Main outcome and measures: AUnfavorable neurological outcome at 90 days after ICU admission, defined by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) > 2, indicating moderate-to-severe disability or death.\n\nResults: Among the 237 patients included, 103 (44%, 95%CI 37–50%) had an unfavorable outcome at 90 days, including 71 (30%, 95%CI 25–37%) deaths. Neurological complications at admission occurred in 68 of the 237 patients (31%) and in 70 patients (64%) during ICU stay with a majority of ischemic stroke. Using a multivariate logistic model at ICU admission, we identified four predictive markers independently associated with unfavorable outcome: chronic alcohol consumption (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR 2.37, 95%CI 1.09–5.26), focal neurological sign(s) (aOR 2.11 95%CI 1.06–4.24), neurological complications on ICU admission (aOR 3.65, 95%CI 1.83–7.47) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leukocyte count < 1000 cell/microL, (aOR 4.17, 95%CI 2.22–8.34). Competing risk analysis with death as competing risk and showed that chronic alcohol consumption was the only significant marker for the risk of persistent disability (mRS > 2) at 90 days (Cause specific Hazard Ratio 4.26, 95%CI 1.83–9.91).\n\nConclusion: In adult patients with severe pneumococcal meningitis, the identification of neurological complications on admission neuroimaging is an independent predictor of unfavorable neurological outcome. Chronic alcohol consumption is the only predictive risk of persistent disability at three months in survivors.\n\nCompliance with ethics regulations: Yes in clinical research.\n\nCO-26 Prognostic value of EEG in severe stroke patients requiring mechanical ventilation: a pre-planned ancillary study of the SPICE prospective multicenter study\n\nSarah Benghanem1,2,3, Etienne Gayat4, Nathalie Kubis5, Ambre Loiodice6, Martine Gavaret7, Tarek Sharshar8, Arnaud Foucrier9, Charles Gregoire10, David Cortier11, Samy Figueiredo12, Viviane Bouilleret13, Pierre Jacquet14, François Bagate15, Jean Pascal Lefaucheur16, Bertrand Guidet17, Emmanuelle Appartis18, Bruno Megarbane19, Lionel Naccache20, Alain Cariou1,2, Isabelle Crassard21, France Woimant21, Mickael Mazighi22, Romain Sonneville23\n\n1APHP.Centre, Hôpital Cochin, Paris, France; 2University Paris Cité, Medical School, Paris, France; 3INSERM UMR 1266, FHU NeuroVasc, Institut de Psychiatrie et Neurosciences de Paris-IPNP, Paris, France; 4APHP.Nord, Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, DMU Parabol, Paris, FRANCE; 5APHP.Nord, Neurophysiology department, Paris, France; 6Department of Biostatistics, ICUREsearch, Paris, France; 7Neurophysiology and Epileptology department, GHU Psychiatry & Neurosciences, Sainte Anne, Paris, France; 8Department of Neuroanesthesiology and Intensive Care, Saint Anne Hospital, Paris, France; 9APHP, Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, Beaujon University Hospital, Clichy, France; 10Department of Intensive Care, Rothschild Hospital Foundation, Paris, France; 11Department of Intensive Care, Foch Hospital, Suresnes, France; 12APHP, Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, Bicêtre University Hospitals, Kremlin Bicêtre, France; 13Neurophysiology and Epileptology department, Bicêtre University Hospitals, Le Kremlin Bicêtre, France; 14Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Delafontaine Hospital, Saint Denis, France; 15APHP, Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Henri Mondor University Hospital, Créteil, France; 16Neurophysiology department, Henri Mondor University Hospital, Créteil, France; 17APHP, Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Saint Antoine University Hospital, Paris, France; 18Neurophysiology department, Saint Antoine University Hospital, Paris, France; 19APHP, Department of Medical and Toxicological Critical Care, Lariboisière Hospital, Paris, France; 20Neurophysiology department, Pitié-Salpêtrière university hospital, Paris, France; 21Agence régionale de Santé Ile-de-France, Paris, France; 22APHP Nord, Department of Neurology, Lariboisière University Hospital, Paris, France; 23APHP Nord, Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France\n\nCorrespondence: Sarah Benghanem (sarah.benghanem@aphp.fr)\n\nAnnals of Intensive Care 2013, 13(Suppl 1):CO-26\n\nRationale: We aimed to investigate the prevalence of early EEG abnormalities in adult stroke patients requiring mechanical ventilation and their predictive value for functional outcome.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: We conducted a pre-planned ancillary study of the prospective multicenter SPICE cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03335995, study protocol PMID: 32026446). We included patients from the SPICE cohort with at least one EEG study performed during intensive care unit (ICU) stay. The primary endpoint was poor functional outcome at one year, defined by a score of 4–6 (severe disability or death) on the modified Rankin scale (mRS).\n\nResults: Among the 364 patients prospectively enrolled in SPICE, 153 patients (49 ischemic strokes, 52 intracranial hemorrhages, and 52 subarachnoid hemorrhages) had at least one EEG performed, after a median time of 4 (IQR, 2–7)) days. Diffuse slowing (70% vs 63%, p = 0.37), focal slowing (38% vs 32%, p = 0.15), periodic discharge (2.3% vs 3.7%, p = 0.9), and electrographic seizure (4.5% vs 3.7%, p = 0.4) rates were comparable between poor outcome and good outcome patients. After adjustment for clinical confounders (i.e. age, stroke subtype, non-neurological organ failure, Glasgow coma score), an unreactive EEG background to noise (OR 4.8, 95%CI (1.84–12.53)) or pain (OR 4.76, 95%CI (1.89–11.96)) remained independently associated with poor functional outcome. Conversely, a benign EEG (defined as continuous and reactive background, without seizure, periodic discharges, and burst suppression) was protective (OR 0.29, 95%CI (0.12–0.73)).\n\nConclusion: Unreactive and reactive EEG predicts respectively poor and good one-year functional outcomes in mechanically ventilated stroke patients.\n\nCompliance with ethics regulations: Yes in clinical research.\n\nCO-27 Aberrant brain–heart coupling is associated with the severity and prognosis of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury after cardiac arrest\n\nBertrand Hermann1, Diego Candia-Rivera2, Tarek Sharshar3, Martine Gavaret3, Jean-Luc Diehl1, Alain Cariou4, Sarah Benghanem4\n\n1HEGP, AP-HP. Centre-Université Paris Cité, Paris, France; 2Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle épinière-ICM, INSERM U1127, CNRS UMR 7225, F-75013, Paris, France, Paris, France; 3GHU Paris Psychiatrie Neurosciences, Paris, France, Paris, France; 4Cochin, AP-HP Centre-Université de Paris, Paris, FRANCE\n\nCorrespondence: Bertrand Hermann (bertrand.hermann@aphp.fr)\n\nAnnals of Intensive Care 2013, 13(Suppl 1):CO-27\n\nRationale: Approximately 50% of post-cardiac arrest survivors remain comatose after 72 h, a substantial proportion of which will have a poor neurological outcome, predominantly due to irreversible hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Recent findings in healthy subjects and patients suggested that autonomic nervous system activity measured by brain–heart interactions could be reliable markers of consciousness and cognitive processing. Thus, we hypothesized that brain–heart interactions are associated with the severity of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and the prognosis of these patients.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: In post-cardiac arrest patients still comatose 48 h after sedation weaning, brain–heart interaction markers were computed on 5 min of continuous EEG/ECG recording using a synthetic data generation model, gathering bidirectional interactions between EEG frequency bands (delta, theta and alpha) and heart-rate variability frequency bands (low and high frequency—LF and HF). The strength and complexity of the interactions were quantified using medians and refined composite multiscale entropy (RCMSE). Primary outcome was the severity of brain injury, assessed by: (i) standardized qualitative EEG classification, (ii) somatosensory evoked potentials (N20), and (iii) neuron-specific enolase levels. Secondary outcome was the 3-month neurological status, assessed by the Cerebral Performance Category score [good (1–2) vs. poor outcome (3–4-5)].\n\nResults: Between January 2007 and July 2021, 181 patients [116 males (64%), median age 61 years, age range 49–72 years] were admitted to ICU for a resuscitated cardiac arrest (76% out-of-hospital, 69% non-shockable rhythm). Poor neurological outcome was observed in 134 patients (74%). Qualitative EEG patterns suggesting high severity were associated with a decreased sympatho-vagal balance. Severity of EEG changes were proportional to higher absolute values of brain-to-heart coupling strength (p < 2 × 10–3 for all brain-to-heart frequencies) and lower values of complexity (all p-values < 0.05 except for alpha-to-low frequency). Brain-to-heart coupling strength was significantly higher in patients with bilateral absent N20 and correlated with neuron-specific enolase levels at day 3. This aberrant brain-to-heart coupling (increased strength, decreased complexity) was also associated with 3-month poor neurological outcome (Table).\n\nConclusion: Our results suggest that autonomic dysfunctions may well represent hypoxic-ischemic brain injury post-cardiac arrest pathophysiology. These results open avenues for integrative monitoring of autonomic functioning in critical care patients with potential prognostic applications.\n\nCompliance with ethics regulations: Yes in clinical research.\n\nCO-28 Distinct profiles of microglial activation are associated with neurological outcome in anoxic and traumatic coma\n\nBenjamine Sarton1,2, Clovis Tauber1,3, Patrice Peran2, Adrian David1, Stein Silva1,2\n\n1CHU Toulouse, Toulouse, France; 2INSERM—UMR 1214, Toulouse, France; 3Université de Tours, Tours, France\n\nCorrespondence: Benjamine Sarton (benjamine.sarton@hotmail.fr)\n\nAnnals of Intensive Care 2013, 13(Suppl 1):CO-28\n\nRationale: Coma resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) and anoxia, remains a major issue for prognostication and care. Accumulative evidence suggests that coma is due to a disconnection within a “consciousness network”: fronto-parietal cortex and subcortical structures (mesocircuit)(1). Inflammation is potentially one of the leading causes of this connectome disruption. PET imaging allows in-vivo brain inflammation insight, triggering TSPO receptor expressed by activated microglia (MA). We aimed to study acute neuroinflammation in coma and its relationship with neurological outcome. We hypothesised that (i) brain injuries triggers MA within brain structures responsible for conscious processing (ii) with distinct MA pattern for anoxic and traumatic mechanism (iii) there is a significant relationship between in-vivo MA features and patients 3 month’s neurological outcome.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: We conducted a cross sectional study of coma patients compared to controls. We included comatose adult patient, GCS < 9 with motor score < 6 induced by traumatic or anoxic brain injury (< 30 days), free from sedations. Patients and controls were excluded in case of neurological illness, anti-inflammatory medication, low affinity binding phenotype for TSPO receptor. Control group was gender and age matched. The protocol included a neurological examination, T1-MRI and TSPO PET with 18F-DPA-714 radioligand. Brain 18F-DPA-714 binding was quantified with a supervised clustering algorithm (2). Neurological outcome was assessed with Coma recovery scale (CRS-r) at 3 months. The ethic committee approved the study.\n\nResults: Seventeen coma (6 anoxic and 13 TBI) patients and 20 controls were included (2019–2022). Significant increased binding potential (BP) of 18F-DPA-714 was observed in coma patient compared to control, with different intensity and spatial distribution between anoxic and traumatic groups (Figure 1A). Anoxic patients have showed significant increased BP in the thalamus, pallidum, putamen, posterior cingular cortex, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), precuneus; and in mPFC for trauma patients. A significant higher 18F-DPA-714 binding was observed in coma patients with unfavorable outcome (Figure 1B) notably in the pallidum (p = 0,001), putamen (p = 0,02) and PCC (p = 0,004).\n\nConclusion: For the first time we have in vivo identified significant neuroinflammation in acute coma. MA is identified into networks implicated in conscious processing. Interestingly, MA profile was different between anoxic and traumatic coma. MA intensity and its spatial distribution were associated with patient’s further neurological outcome. Those results provide new insights into the characterization of neuroinflammation after severe brain injury and hold promise for personalized treatment.\n\nReference 1\n\nGiacino JT, Fins JJ, Laureys S, Schiff ND.

Currently, there is a major knowledge gap related to the covert yet potentially incapacitating higher-order cognitive impairment underpinning this disorder of consciousness.\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: The aim of the current study was to analyze the electrophysiological signatures of delirium by using a specifically designed multidimensional auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) battery to probe hierarchical cognitive processes, including automatic and voluntary attention, self-related processing and detection of arithmetic incongruences. Clinical variables and electrophysiological data were prospectively collected in controls subjects (n = 14) and in critically ill patients with (n = 18) and without (n = 20) delirium.\n\nResults: Overall, we have specifically identified in patients with delirium, both a preservation of low-level central auditory processing—notably the detection of local regularity violation (MMN and P3a or ‘local effect’)—and a coherent ensemble of covert higher-order cognitive dysfunctions encompassing the processing of global regularity violation (P3b or ‘global effect’), self-relevant stimulus (P3 to subject's own name), and simple arithmetic facts violation (P3 to incorrect results) (spatio-temporal clustering, p-cluster ≤ 0.05). In this setting, estimation of the cortical generators of the P3 response to target stimuli by source modeling identified the predominant role of the frontal lobe in control subjects, whose activation was modulated downward by delirium.\n\nConclusion: Multidomain cognitive processes involving P3 ERP responses to auditory protocols are impaired in patients with delirium and could be due to frontal brain dysfunction. We suggest that our results shed new light on the neuropsychological disorders associated with ICU-related delirium and may constitute a valuable method for patient’s bedside diagnosis and monitoring in this clinically challenging setting.\n\nCompliance with ethics regulations: Yes in clinical research.\n\nCO-30 Accuracy of tidal volume delivery by pediatric intensive care ventilators: a bench model study\n\nMeryl Vedrenne-Cloquet1,4, Samuel Tuffet2,3,5, Bruno Louis3,5, Sonia Khirani1,4,6, Charlotte Collignon1, Sylvain Renolleau1,4, Brigitte Fauroux1,4, Guillaume Carteaux2,3,5\n\n1Centre hospitalo-universitaire Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France; 2Centre hospitalo-universitaire Henri Mondor, Créteil, France; 3INSERM, CNRS ERL 7000, IMRB, Créteil, France; 4Université Paris Cité, Paris, France; 5Université Paris-Est Créteil, Créteil, France; 6ASV Santé, Genevilliers, France\n\nCorrespondence: Meryl Vedrenne-Cloquet (meryl.vedrenne@aphp.fr)\n\nAnnals of Intensive Care 2013, 13(Suppl 1):CO-30\n\nRationale: Accurate control of low tidal volumes (Vt) is crucial during pediatric protective ventilation. Vt delivery can be influenced by gas compression, humidity, temperature, and ventilatory circuit compliance, thus might be altered by the humidification system. The impact of the humidification system on the accuracy of Vt delivery during pediatric volume-controlled ventilation is unknown. The primary objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of Vt delivery by pediatric intensive care ventilators according to the humidification system. Secondary objectives were to assess: i) the accuracy of Vt delivery according to the presence or absence of an integrated Y-piece pneumotachograph; ii) the ability of ventilators to deliver and maintain the preset positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).\n\nPatients and methods/materials and methods: Six modern intensive care ventilators equipped with a pediatric mode were tested on the ASL5000 test lung. Ventilators were tested in volume-controlled mode under 4 simulated pediatric bench models (full-term neonate (NN), infant (I), pre-school kid (PS), school kid (S)) with a heated humidifier (HH) or a heat-moisturer exchanger (HME), under various loading conditions (healthy, obstructive, restrictive), and with two levels of PEEP. Three ventilators equipped with Y-piece pneumotachograph were tested with or without the integrated pneumotachograph in the NN and I models. “Accurate Vt” delivery was defined as the volume error (percentage of the preset Vt under body temperature and pressure and saturated water vapour (BTPS) conditions) ≤ 10% of absolute preset value.\n\nResults: Vt accuracy varied significantly across ventilators. The use of a HH or HME was associated with a significant difference in volume error for almost all the ventilators (p < 0.05). Ventilation with HH tended to deliver a lower-than-set Vt, the opposite was observed with HME, especially in the NN and I models. The use of an integrated pneumotachograph was associated with lower volume error in only one ventilator (p < 0.001). All the tested ventilators were able to maintain adequate PEEP levels.\n\nConclusion: The accuracy of Vt delivery is highly variable across pediatric intensive care ventilators during volume-controlled ventilation, and is altered by the humidification system, especially in the youngest patients.\n\nReference 1\n\nLy"
