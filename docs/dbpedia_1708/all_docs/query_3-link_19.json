        "text": "Capital of the French department of Somme\n\nThis article is about the city in France. For the battles which occurred nearby, see Battle of Amiens (disambiguation). For the locality in Australia, see Amiens, Queensland. For the street in Dublin, see Amiens Street.\n\nPrefecture and commune in Hauts-de-France, France\n\nAmiens (English: [3] or AM-ee-ənz;[4] French: [amjɛ̃] ⓘ; Picard: Anmien, Anmiens or Anmyin) is a city and commune in northern France, located 120 km (75 mi) north of Paris and 100 km (62 mi) south-west of Lille. It is the capital of the Somme department in the region of Hauts-de-France and had a population of 135,429,[5] as of 2021. A central landmark of the city is Amiens Cathedral, the largest Gothic cathedral in France. Amiens also has one of the largest university hospitals in France, with a capacity of 1,200 beds. The author Jules Verne lived in Amiens from 1871 until his death in 1905, and served on the city council for 15 years. Amiens is the birthplace of French president Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe town was fought over during both World Wars, suffering significant damage, and was repeatedly occupied by both sides. The 1918 Battle of Amiens was the opening phase of the Hundred Days Offensive which directly led to the Armistice with Germany. The Royal Air Force heavily bombed the town during the Second World War. In the aftermath, the city was rebuilt according to Pierre Dufau's plans with wider streets to ease traffic congestion. These newer structures were primarily built of brick, concrete and white stone with slate roofs. The architect Auguste Perret designed the Gare d'Amiens train station and nearby Tour Perret.\n\nAmiens has an important historical and cultural heritage, on which a significant amount of tourism is based. Apart from the cathedral, there is the hortillonnages [fr], the Jules Verne House [fr], the Tour Perret, the Musée de Picardie, the zoo [fr], and the quarters of Saint-Leu and Saint-Maurice. A total of 60 monuments are listed in the inventory of monuments historiques, over 1600 places and monuments listed in the general inventory of cultural heritage, and 187 objects listed in the inventory of monuments historiques. During December, the town hosts the largest Christmas market in northern France. It is known for a few local foods, including \"macarons d'Amiens\", almond paste biscuits; \"tuiles amienoises\", chocolate and orange curved biscuits; \"pâté de canard d'Amiens\", duck pâté in pastry; \"la ficelle Picarde\", an oven-baked cheese-topped crêpe; and \"flamiche aux poireaux\", a puff pastry tart made with leeks and cream.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: History of Amiens and Timeline of Amiens\n\nThe first known settlement at this location was Samarobriva (\"Somme bridge\"), the central settlement of the Ambiani tribe, one of the principal tribes of Gaul. The Romans named the town Ambianum, meaning settlement of the Ambiani people. Amiens was part of Francia starting from the 5th century.[6] The Normans sacked the city in 859 and again in 882.\n\nIn 1113, the city was recognized by King Louis VI of France, and in 1185 it was linked to the Crown of France. In 1597, Spanish soldiers held the city during the six-month Siege of Amiens, before Henry IV regained control. During the 18th and 19th century, the textile tradition of Amiens became famous for its velours. As a result of the French Revolution, the provinces of France were dismantled and the territory was organised into departments. Much of Picardy became the newly created department of Somme with Amiens as the departmental capital. During the industrial revolution, the city walls were demolished, opening up space for large boulevards around the town center. The Henriville neighborhood in the south of the city was developed around this time. In 1848, the first railway arrived in Amiens, linking the city to Boulogne-sur-Mer. During the 1870 Battle of Amiens, the city was occupied by invading Prussian forces.\n\nThe town was fought over during both the First and Second World Wars, suffering significant damage and being occupied several times by both sides. The 1918 Battle of Amiens was the opening phase of the Hundred Days Offensive which led directly to the Armistice with Germany that ended the war. In June 1944 following D-Day, Amiens was heavily bombed by the Royal Air Force. The town was liberated by British forces on 31 August. The city was rebuilt according to Pierre Dufau's plans with a focus on widening the streets to ease traffic congestion. These newer structures were primarily built of brick, concrete and white stone with slate roofs. The architect Auguste Perret designed the Gare d'Amiens train station and nearby Tour Perret.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nLocation\n\n[edit]\n\nAmiens, the regional prefecture of Picardy, also functions as the prefecture of the Somme department, one of the three departments (with Oise and Aisne) in the region. Located in the Paris Basin, the city benefits from a privileged geographical position, with close proximity to Paris, Lille, Rouen, London and Brussels. At the crossroads of major European routes of travel (A1, A16 and A29), the city is also at the heart of a major rail star.\n\nAs the crow flies, the city is 115 kilometres (71 mi) north of Paris, 97 kilometres (60 mi) south-west of Lille, 100 kilometres (62 mi) north-east of Rouen, 162 kilometres (101 mi) east-north-east of Le Havre and 144 kilometres (89 mi) north-west of Reims. At the regional level, Amiens is located 53 kilometres (33 mi) north of Beauvais, 71 kilometres (44 mi) west of Saint-Quentin, 66 kilometres (41 mi) from Compiègne and 102 kilometres (63 mi) from Laon.\n\nIn area, Amiens is the third-largest settlement in the Somme, after Crécy-en-Ponthieu and Hornoy-le-Bourg.\n\nGeology and relief\n\n[edit]\n\nThe area of the commune is 4,946 hectares (12,220 acres); the altitude varies between 14 and 106 metres (46 and 348 ft).[7]\n\nHydrography: Somme and canal, Avre and Selle\n\n[edit]\n\nThe main stem of the River Somme passes through Amiens and is generally benign, except during exceptional floods that can last up to several weeks (such as in spring 2001). It is also, on its southeastern outskirts, close to Camon and Longueau, the confluence with its main tributary on the left bank (to the south), and the Avre. The Selle enters from the northwest of Amiens, with two arms (including the Haute Selle) passing behind the Unicorn Stadium, the exhibition park, the megacity and horse racing track, then passing the end of the Promenade de la Hotoie and the zoo of Amiens, and to the right of the water treatment plant, in front of the island Sainte-Aragone, opposite the cemetery of La Madeleine in Amiens.\n\nThe city developed in a natural narrowing of the river at the level of the hortillonnages [fr], due to the advance of the rim of the Picard plateau in Saint-Pierre (ford crossing).[citation needed] The Amiens citadel is built on this limestone butte of the Picard plateau and Rue Saint-Pierre is a slightly inclined path to leave the city from the north. At this narrowing, a network of narrow canals led to the construction of bridges and buildings including textile mills in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe marshes of the old bed of the river Somme was used to dig peat. Farmers maintained rieux, canals and ditches by cleaning out the silt and used it to append to their vegetable garden plot, the hortillons. Beginning in the 20th century the descendants of hortillons stopped maintaining the canals and the areas were gradually left to lie fallow or sold to private individuals who created pleasure gardens accessible by boat.[8]\n\nThe hydrographic network has always been an important city-operated asset. The river helped shape the identity of the landscape, urban and economic territory. It is around the quarters of Saint-Leu, Saint-Maurice bordering the River Somme and most of the administrative and civil area of the current city center which the city has developed since antiquity.\n\nThe Canal de la Somme dates from the beginning of the 19th century and the bridge at the foot of the citadel was built after World War II.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nAmiens has the typical oceanic climate of the north of France, with relatively mild winters, cool summers, and rainfall well distributed throughout the year.\n\nTransport\n\n[edit]\n\nAmiens is a hub between the Île de France and the rest of northern France; Normandy and Benelux; and France and Great Britain. Amiens is not directly on principal European road and rail arteries, such as the A1 motorway and the Paris-Lille TGV train line, at present.\n\nHowever, due to its position halfway between the urban areas of Lille and Paris, Amiens has good conditions for service and accessibility, including motorways (at the junction of the A16 and A29).\n\nRail\n\n[edit]\n\nAmiens station is served by regional train services to destinations that include Rouen, Calais, Lille, Reims, Compiègne and Paris-Nord. Saint-Roch (Somme) station in the western part of the city is served by local trains towards Rouen and Abbeville. A regular bus route with the TGV Haute-Picardie station also provides access to the Charles-de-Gaulle Airport station. On the horizon of 2025,[9] the Roissy–Picardie Link will put Amiens 55 minutes from Paris Charles-de-Gaulle Airport and its TGV station.\n\nBy train, Amiens is located at:\n\n1 hour 5 minutes from Paris (16 round-trip trains per day)\n\n1 hour 15 minutes from Lille\n\n1 hour 15 minutes from Rouen\n\n2 hours 30 minutes from Brussels\n\n3 hours 30 minutes from Lyon\n\n3 hours from London\n\nRoads\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: [[:Rocade d'Amiens [fr]]]\n\nSince antiquity, Amiens has been a crossroads of important routes. The contemporary city is served by the A16 and A29 autoroutes. The Jules Verne Viaduct, 943 metres (3,094 ft) long, crosses the River Somme to the east of the city and allows circumvention of the city by motorway-type roads. The A16 and A29 autoroutes, the RN1 and the RN25 form a bypass-type motorway around the city that the population has called the Rocade d'Amiens [ring road of Amiens]. Initially constituting national roads which are downgraded today, mostly as departmental roads, the greater urban area of Amiens is served by:\n\nRN 1 to Beauvais and Paris, to the South, and towards Abbeville, Calais, Dunkirk and the Belgian border, northwest.\n\nRN 25 towards Doullens, Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise and Arras\n\nRD 1029 towards Yvetot and Neufchâtel-en-Bray to the west, Saint-Quentin and La Capelle in the east.\n\nRD 929 to Albert and Bapaume and Cambrai.\n\nRD 935 [fr] towards Compiègne.\n\nRD 919 [fr] to Mailly-Maillet and Arras.\n\nRD 933 [fr] to Bernaville and Auxi-le-Château.\n\nRD 934 [fr] to Roye and Noyon.\n\nAmiens is served by several motorways:\n\nA16 to Calais via Abbeville and Boulogne-sur-Mer\n\nA16 to Paris via Beauvais\n\nA29 to Rouen and Le Havre via Neufchâtel-en-Bray\n\nA29 to Reims via Saint-Quentin and Laon\n\nThe proposed A24 autoroute from Amiens to Lille via Doullens was cancelled in 2006.\n\nParking\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the urban transport plan (PDU) approved 19 December 2013 for the period 2013–2023 parking supply is considered abundant in Amiens.[10] Although important, demand for parking is less than what is available (capacity reserves are still 20% minimum: If the road is sometimes saturated, the occupancy rate of the underground parking remains globally less than 100%).[10]\n\nIn 2013, the city counted approximately 70,000 public parking spaces, including 8,400 in the city center and in its immediate vicinity, where 70% of places are paid.[10]\n\n4,400 spaces on highways (1,950 in the inner city, including 1,600 paid)\n\n4,000 spaces in underground parking (620 other new places are programmed in a project for the Gare La Vallée development zone).\n\nThe underground car parks in the city center are organised thus:\n\nName Accessible by Close to Number of spaces Halles Rue du Général-Leclerc Commercial Centre of Halles, belfry 468 Centrum Rue Frédéric Petit Coliseum 190 Hôtel de ville Rue de Beauvais Espace piétonnier, town hall 80 Jacobins Rue des Jacobins Espace piétonnier, prefecture 587 Saint-Leu Rue des Huchers Faculties of law, political science and economy management; cathedral 585 Trois Cailloux Rue Robert de Luzarches Espace piétonnier, courthouse, cathedral 486 Amiens 2 Boulevard d'Alsace-Lorraine, rue de la Vallée Amiens 2 commercial centre, bus station, SNCF railway station 724 Perret Boulevard de Belfort, rue Vulfran-Warmé Cinema, SNCF railway station 490 Gare La Vallée Rue de la Vallée SNCF railway station, Gare La Vallée development zone 840\n\nAs of 2007 , a residential parking system has been deployed in Saint-Anne ward to cope with congestion in the streets caused by SNCF railway station users. During the campaign for the municipal election of 2008, parking was one of the important topics of debate.[11] A year after the change of majority, the Gilles Demailly [fr] team launched a consultation with the population.[12] From 2011, residential parking was extended to the Gare-La-Vallée and Riolan neighborhoods, then in 2012 to the Noyon neighborhood and the area east of the Riolan sector. In 2014, 2,600 parking spaces[13] were affected by this system which allowed city residents more parking near their homes in order to promote a better rotation of vehicles in the streets and reduce permanent occupation of public space by the cars cluttering the highway.\n\nPublic transport\n\n[edit]\n\nAmiens was originally served by two tram lines over 10.7 kilometres (6.6 mi), opened in 1887. They intersect at Place Gambetta, one linking La Madeleine Cemetery [fr], the Church of Saint-Acheul, Cagnard bridge, Rue de Noyon and Rue Jules-Barni; the other from the Church of Saint-Pierre at the racecourse, by the streets of Saint-Leu, Frédéric-Petit and Colbert. Electrified in 1899, the network grew to seven lines totaling 19 kilometres (12 mi) in 1906. From 1932, Longueau was linked to Amiens by a bus service. German bombing in 1940 destroyed most of the city center and hit the Jules-Ferry Road tram depot [fr], totally destroying the tram fleet. Only the Longueau bus survived. A few old Parisian buses were also used in an extremely reduced service. These buses as well as the surviving bus were then converted to city gas and equipped with tanks on the roof covered by a huge white dome. This service continued until approximately 1946. There were only two urban lines: An east–west line (Saint-Acheul – Montieres) and a northeast–southwest line (Beauville – road to Rouen). It was decided after the war to serve the city by a trolleybus with one route to Longueau. This was only in part realized, serving Saint-Acheul, Rouen, La Madeleine and Saint-Pierre. In 1964, trolleybuses were abandoned and the bus became ubiquitous in Amiens transportation.[14]\n\nThe bus network is today managed by the Ametis mixed economy company [fr], whose network covers Amiens Métropole, the agglomeration of Amiens. The establishment of dedicated bus lanes began in 2006. Former Mayor Gilles de Robien had envisioned the creation of a tram, but the choice of dedicated bus lanes had been preferred for reasons of cost and patronage. His successor, Mayor Gilles Demailly [fr], had been considering the development of a in the metropolitan area. As a result of numerous studies and conferences, elected representatives voted for the creation of a tram at the municipal Council of 15 November 2012. The project had been endorsed by the Communauté d'agglomération Amiens Métropole on 18 December 2012 and the commissioning of a first north–south tram route [fr] was scheduled for 2018/2019.[15] Following the elections of 2014 [fr], which were a defeat for most municipal and community carriers of the project, the new mayor of Amiens Brigitte Fouré, and by extension the new president of Amiens Métropole Alain Gest, decided to suspend the project at least during the time of their respective mandates, thus applying a campaign promise (the tram was at the heart of debate)[16] and despite a project announcement of trams on tyres (of TVR type).[17][18] Improvement of public transit would then be only by that of the bus network. Indeed, in December of the same year, the Community Council approved funding for a study (the sixth in 20 years)[19] relating to the establishment of a rapid transit bus network [fr] (BHNS), which should enter into service in March 2019, and whose vehicles could be electric.[20]\n\nThe Place Gambetta: An important hub of the former tram network of Amiens at the beginning of the 20th century\n\nThe lycée de jeunes filles and tramway, Rue des Otages, now Lycée Madeleine-Michelis\n\nA bus of the network of public transport in Amiens [fr]\n\nCycle networks\n\n[edit]\n\nAmiens has developed two bike services: Buscyclette and Velam [fr].\n\nBuscyclette is a service of rental bikes on demand, created in May 1999. In 2014, nearly 2,400 \"green bikes\" are available for rent, essentially city bikes but also electric bikes (VAE), folding bicycles and specific bikes (kids bikes, child trailers, mountain bikes, cargo bikes, tandems, etc.). The rental period varies from half a day to one year.\n\nVelam [fr] is a bike sharing system (VLS) created on 16 February 2008, an adaptation of the Cyclocity [fr] system managed by JCDecaux, similar to Vélo'v in Lyon and Vélib' in Paris. Vélam [fr] offers 313 bikes distributed every 300 to 400 metres in the center of Amiens and 26 stations.\n\nIn 2012, Amiens Métropole had 100 kilometres (62 mi) of routes for cyclists.[10] Despite the development of a bicycle plan in 1997 which was planning the development of 500 kilometres (310 mi) of equipped cycleways, the network of the territory in terms of paths is still incomplete.\n\nThe blueprint of the bicycle facilities of the agglomeration (SDAC) provides, over a period of 10 years (2014–2024),[10] for 188 kilometres (117 mi) of cycle routes and equips 490 sites for the parking of bikes. This plan also includes the deployment of parking facilities over the entire territory of the city, close to the facilities frequented by bikers, as well as cyclist right-turns [fr] at traffic lights or even the maintenance of existing facilities.\n\nRailways\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are three railway stations:\n\nTwo stations on the Paris-Boulogne and Amiens – Rouen lines:\n\nThe Amiens station, main station, known as Gare du Nord, in memory of the Compagnie du Nord who created it. Every day, 15,000 travelers use its seven lines.[21]\n\nThe station of Saint-Roch\n\nConnections from these two stations include to Lille via Arras and Douai, to Boulogne via Abbeville, to Paris-Nord via Creil or Compiègne, to Reims via Tergnier, and to Rouen.\n\nA station located on the Paris – Lille line in Longueau serving south of Amiens and the communes of Longueau, Cagny, Boves, etc.\n\nLongueau station, a passenger station of the historic railway hub in Longueau. Every day, 2,500 travellers use its two lines.[21]\n\nMontieres station [fr], station assigned to the freight traffic, it serves only the industrial zone of Amiens. This station is located on the former railway line of Doullens.\n\nMany regional and extra regional links (Normandie, Grand Est and Île-de-France) pass through Amiens, especially by TER Hauts-de-France.\n\nA station located 45 kilometres (28 mi) from Amiens, the Haute-Picardie TGV station, allows access to the TGV network. It is served by buses from Amiens. Its isolated character earned it the name of gare des betteraves, or gare betteraves, at the time of its construction.[22]\n\nGare du Nord (old postcard published by Caron No. 328, postmarked in 1909)\n\nInside Saint-Roch railway station (postcard postmarked in 1905)\n\nGare Saint-Roch\n\nGare de Longueau\n\nAir transport\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to Amiens – Glisy Aerodrome, bordering the town's eastern edge 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) from the center, there are several airports nearby.\n\nAlbert – Picardie Airport is located 20 minutes northeast of the city.\n\nBeauvais-Tillé Airport, the ninth largest French airport by usage, located 45 minutes by car south of the city, and served by a bus service from Amiens.\n\nLille Airport, reachable by train or by road using the A29 and A1.\n\nParis-Charles de Gaulle Airport, reachable by train or by road using the A29 and A1, or A16 and N104. The creation of a railway between Creil and Roissy will put Amiens 55 minutes from Paris Charles de Gaulle airport by 2020.[23]\n\nWaterways\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Somme canal runs through the town to the English Channel. This canal is linked to the Canal du Nord (Paris to Lille metropolitan area).\n\nUrbanism\n\n[edit]\n\nUrban morphology\n\n[edit]\n\nAmiens comprises a number of neighbourhoods (\"quartiers\" in French) with their own characteristics, including Saint-Leu, St-Maurice, Henriville, and Saint-Acheul.\n\nSaint-Leu quarter\n\n[edit]\n\nSt-Leu forms part of Amiens, north of the city center. It has many older wooden and brick houses and several canals. At the foot of the cathedral, traversed by canals, this picturesque area was largely rehabilitated during the 1990s. It extends to the Somme canal, located more to the north, at the foot of the Coteau Saint-Pierre on which the fortress of Jean Errard, called Citadelle, was built. Historically, it was the poor quarter of the city, where butchers, tanners and dyers gathered.\n\nAmiens University's Faculty of Sciences, present since the 1960s, has been renovated and expanded on occasion. The Faculty of Law and Economics has also been transferred since the mid-1990s from the campus (offset to the south of the city) to its new location at the foot of the cathedral.[note 1] The open-air parking it replaces was a \"gap\" in the landscape dating from World War II. Nonetheless, it allowed an unobstructed view of the cathedral. Most of the buildings have been renovated and transformed into housing much of which is for students, many of whom are in the quarter.\n\nThe area became the heart of the Amiens people's evenings, with many establishments (bars, restaurants, etc.) on Place du Don and Quai Bélu.\n\nThe church is found at Rue Saint-Leu, located just between the Faculty of Science and Law-Economy (UPJV).\n\nTwo theatres were established in the quarter, that of the Chés Cabotans (puppet shows in the Picard language) and the Maison du Théâtre at the foot of the Saint-Leu Church. There is also La Lune des Pirates, a concert hall.\n\nPlace du Don: The River Somme and cathedral\n\nSaint-Leu: Rue du Hocquet\n\nSaint-Leu: Rue d'Engoulvent and Rue des Majots\n\nSaint-Leu: Rue d'Engoulvent\n\nSaint-Leu: Place Aristide Briand\n\nCanal in the Saint-Leu quarter\n\nQuai Bélu on the banks of the Somme, near the old market on the waterside\n\nThe Samarobriva footbridge from the Sport Nautique d'Amiens to Saint-Pierre Park in 2009\n\nSaint-Maurice quarter\n\n[edit]\n\nLocated to the west of the Citadelle, and east of the La Madeleine Cemetery [fr], this very old working-class quarter of Amiens acted as an industrial center in the 18th century. It is currently undergoing significant housing renovation and development.\n\nBordered by the Canal de la Somme, it offers a stopover for leisure boats, which must go through a lock.\n\nThe walls of the city's former dye factory are now those of the École supérieure d'art et de design d'Amiens [fr] (ESAD) as well as those of the Faculty of Arts. The École supérieure d'ingénieurs en électronique et électrotechnique (ESIEE) is in the same quarter. As the Citadelle, it will be renovated by the architect Renzo Piano to accommodate the university departments (UFR) of: letters, history and geography, languages, the École supérieure du professorat et de l'éducation [fr] (ESPE), the House of Languages, the House of Research and the University Library in 2015.\n\nThe Jardin des plantes [fr], known as the Jardin du Roy within the city, is also located in this quarter.\n\nHenriville-quarter\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Henriville neighborhood was mostly built during the 19th century after the demolition of the city wall. It lies at the south of the town center. It has numerous bourgeois houses and townhouses, predominantly in brick, blending architectural styles of the period, including neoclassical, troubadour and neo-Gothic. There are also private mansions, such as the Acloque mansion and the house of Jules Verne.\n\nSaint-Acheul quarter\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Saint-Acheul quarter ( IPA: [sɛ̃t‿aʃœl]) existed before Amiens' inception, as people have lived there since prehistoric times. This is where archaeological excavations in the nineteenth century discovered prehistoric tool sets typical of the \"Acheulean\" prehistorical era, named after this neighborhood (also spelled Acheulian, pronounced [aʃœljɑ̃]). Civilians can freely visit the archaeological garden there.\n\nNot to be confused with the commune of Saint-Acheul situated 37 km (23 mi) to the north, the quarter of Saint-Acheul is the site of a military cemetery from the First World War (1914–1918).\n\nIt also contains the Church of Saint-Acheul, and the former normal school of teachers which became the Lycée Robert-de-Luzarches. A number of famous people are buried in the former Saint-Acheul cemetery such as the creator of Bécassine J.P. Pinchon, and many resistance fighters. Part of the quarter includes a so-called \"English neighborhood,\" with typical English style houses. At the feet of this area lie the hortillonnages [fr], a marshy area criss-crossed by canals.\n\nOther neighborhoods\n\n[edit]\n\nAmiens, like other big cities, has its large HLM high-rise tower blocks:\n\nNorth of the city the quarters du Pigeonnier, which is famous for its weekend market, Messenger, Mozart, Fafet-Brossolette-la Cité, Balzac, Léo Lagrange-Schweitzer, etc.;\n\nSoutheast of the city: Victorine-Autier, Philéas Lebesgue, Condorcet, Pierre-Rollin.\n\nWest: Etouvie and Montières (an ecodistrict is provided in this industrial space, where there are 19th century in brick buildings).[24]\n\nEast: Saint-Acheul-la-Cité and the Clos de l'Avre.\n\nThese areas experience a lot of social troubles and have regularly been the place for riots. The northern quarters were the scene of violent events in 1994, 1999 and 2000 (clashes between several districts of the city and between the neighbourhoods of Amiens and the districts of Creil), in 2006 and 2008 (in the wake of incidents in the Paris suburbs)[citation needed] and more recently in August 2012 following a conflict between youth and the police. The cost of the latest vandalism to occur in the north of Amiens would amount, according to Gilles Demailly [fr], to between four and six million euros. These extremely violent riots caused sixteen police officers to be injured.[25]\n\nAn extensive programme of redevelopment of these neighborhoods began recently, with demolition of HLM tower blocks and new infrastructure having been built, especially for schools. In 2009, the public transport network of the Amiens agglomeration was significantly modified.\n\nHousing\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2017, the total number of dwellings in the municipality was 73,541, while it was 63,178 in 1999.[26]\n\nAmong this housing, 88.7% were primary residences, 2.1% of secondary residences and 9.2% vacant housing. These dwellings were 35.6% of houses and 63.4% of apartments.[26]\n\nThe proportion of principal residences, which were the properties of occupants, was 31.9%, down from 2007 (34.4%). The share of empty rented HLM homes (social housing) was up: 29.8% against 29.4% in 2007, their number increased from 18,268 to 19,431.[26] However, this percentage remains much greater than the rate of 20% required by the law on solidarity and urban renewal [fr] (SRU) for cities and agglomerations of more than 50,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe identity of the city is strongly marked by the specificity of its housing stock, consisting in a large proportion of detached houses, semi-detached, single or bourgeois: the amiénoises. These traditional houses in the suburbs, in brick, were intrinsically linked to the expansion of the city during and after the Industrial Revolution.\n\nThe amiénoise simple includes a window on the ground floor and floors for attic and basement. It is built on a plot of a few metres wide but is very deep, and includes a garden, forming hearts with green islets and sparse areas. The amiénoise double has two windows at each level. The grandes amiénoises and townhouses rise to at least two floors with large rooms. They can have a gate opening onto a paved courtyard.[27]\n\nThe official buildings or mansions regularly use brick façades on a sandstone base, decorated by stone window and door frames.\n\nThe Chanoines quarter has stone façades exclusively.\n\nIn historic areas such as the Saint-Leu [fr] quarter, façades widely use wood, half-timbered or siding, and wattle and daub.\n\nDevelopment projects\n\n[edit]\n\nAmiens 2030: Amiens, in the context of the Communauté d'agglomération Amiens Métropole, is developing a master development plan called Amiens 2030.[28] This strategic outreach project is centered around the priority issues of economic, social and cultural development of the agglomeration. The whole process of reflection will determine the development of the metropolis by 2030.\n\nLa Citadelle [fr]: This flagship project for the agglomeration involves the amalgamation of units of training and research from the University of Picardie in letters, languages, history, geography, philosophy, sociology, psychology and the College teaching and education [fr] (ESPE) on the site of La Citadelle. It is to be set on 18 acres (7.3 ha) on the outskirts of downtown. This university construction program is intended to strengthen regional competitiveness and the development of higher education and research. The project, entrusted to the Italian architect Renzo Piano, will be accessible to all inhabitants.\n\nZAC Gare-la-Vallée: The project intends to strengthen Amiens in its role as the regional capital and allow the creation of a genuine business district in the heart of the city. With a budget of €157 million, the project combines tertiary activities, shops and a habitat walk from the station and the inner city. The first buildings were inaugurated in 2008. The second phase of development extended from 2012 to 2017. Under the control of the Chief Architect, Paul Chemetov, the quarter must accommodate 2,000 homes, 200,000 square metres (2,200,000 sq ft) of offices and two urban parks creating a visible link between downtown, the Somme and the Hortillonnages [fr].[29]\n\nZAC Intercampus: This new housing and services quarter in the south of the city is projected to host 1,900 dwellings by 2030.[30] A first tranche of 850 dwellings must be delivered in 2015. Located in the immediate vicinity of the campus and the CHU d'Amiens, it will be served by a future TCSP. The ecodistrict of 80 hectares (200 acres) is projected to provide green spaces and gardens, with 60% of its total area to not be built-up. It will include 12 hectares (30 acres) of gardens.[31]\n\nZAC Paul Claudel: This new housing and services quarter of 40 hectares (99 acres) is located at the southern entrance to the city. Intended as a small neighborhood, it must accommodate 1,400 units and 1,800 square metres (19,000 sq ft) of commercial space. Designed in 4 slices, together with its inhabitants, it entered its final phase of development in 2013.[32]\n\nZAC Renancourt: This new quarter must ensure the development of the city to the west. Located between the Grâce Valley, the Selle Valley, the Renancourt quarter and its suburb, this planning area is a natural viewpoint over the city. It is also adjacent to emblematic facilities of the city: The Zenith of Amiens, the Stade de la Licorne and the megacity [fr]. By 2018, this residential area is projected to accommodate 1,400 houses, a hotel, facilities and shops.[33]\n\nBus rapid transit (BRT): A project of three BRT lines is under consideration for commissioning in 2019, at the end of two years of work. Estimated at €85 million excluding taxes, and spanning 44 kilometres (27 mi), the project would include the construction of a new bus depot and four park and ride stops.[34] This project follows the cancellation of a tram project, which was endorsed by the municipal team in place between 2008 and 2014.\n\nToponymy\n\n[edit]\n\nThe toponym is derived from the name of the local Gallic people, the Ambiani, which in the 4th century, replaced the old name of the town Samarobriva [fr] (the bridge on the Samara – Somme). Amiens then became the episcopal headquarters.[35] In Picard, Amiens is called Anmyen.\n\nPolitics and administration\n\n[edit]\n\nPolitical trends and results\n\n[edit]\n\nMunicipal administration\n\n[edit]\n\nThe number of inhabitants is estimated between 100,000 and 149,999, and the number of members of the municipal council is 55.[36]\n\nAs a result of the French municipal elections of 2014, the distribution of seats is as follows:\n\nMunicipal council of Amiens (2014–2020)[37] List Party President Seats Status Groupe \"Rassemblés pour Amiens\" (RPA)\n\n[Group \"Gathered for Amiens\"] UDI-UMP-MoDem Brigitte Fouré 42 Majority Groupe des élus socialistes\n\n[Group of Socialist elected officials] PS Didier Cardon 5 Opposition Groupe Europe Écologie Les Verts\n\n[Group Europe Ecology – The Greens] EELV Thomas Hutin and Marion Lepresle\n\n(joint presidents) 2 Opposition Groupe des élus municipaux communistes\n\n[Group of communist elected officials] PCF Jacques Lessard 2 Opposition Groupe Amiens Bleu Marine\n\n[Group Amiens Navy Blue] FN Yves Dupille 4 Opposition\n\nThe cantons\n\n[edit]\n\nAmiens is divided into seven cantons:\n\nCanton Constituency Departmental councillors Party Population Cantonal code Canton of Amiens-1 Fully within the commune of Amiens Claude Chaidron and Dolorès Esteban FG 26,762 80 06 Canton of Amiens-2 Formed from a part of Amiens and the communes of Allonville, Bertangles, Cardonnette, Coisy, Montonvillers, Poulainville, Querrieu, Rainneville, Saint-Gratien, Villers-Bocage Zohra Darras and Francis Lec DVG – PS 23,827 80 07 Canton of Amiens-3 Formed from a part of Amiens and the communes of Aubigny, Bussy-lès-Daours, Camon, Daours, Lamotte-Brebière, Rivery, Vecquemont Marion Lepresle and Jean-Claude Renaux EELV -PCF 27,020 80 08 Canton of Amiens-4 Formed from a part of Amiens and the communes of Blangy-Tronville, Cachy, Gentelles, Glisy, Longueau, Villers-Bretonneux Nathalie Marchand and Jean-Louis Piot PCF – PS 24,853 80 09 Canton of Amiens-5 Formed from a part of Amiens and the communes of Boves, Cagny Philippe Casier and Blandine Denis PS – EELV 24,535 80 10 Canton of Amiens-6 Formed from a part of Amiens and the communes of Dury, Hébécourt, Rumigny, Sains-en-Amiénois, Saint-Fuscien Hubert de Jenlis and France Fongueuse UDI 25,969 80 11 Canton of Amiens-7 Formed from a part of Amiens and the communes of Pont-de-Metz, Saleux, Salouël, Vers-sur-Selles Margaux Delétré and Olivier Jardé UMP – UDI 27,188 80 12\n\nDeputies\n\n[edit]\n\nAmiens is divided into two legislative districts:\n\nSomme's 1st constituency (including Amiens II North-West, Amiens IV East, Amiens VIII North): François Ruffin (Picardie Debout, NUPES)\n\nSomme's 2nd constituency (including Amiens I West, Amiens III North-East, Amiens V South-East, Amiens VII South-West, Amiens VI South): Barbara Pompili (RE)\n\nList of mayors\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 4 April 2014, Brigitte Fouré (IDU (NC)) succeeded Gilles Demailly [fr] (PS).

The Court of Appeal of Amiens has jurisdiction over the three departments of Picardy, with nine high courts [fr].\n\nMore recently, Amiens has become the seat of:\n\nThe national court of disability and the pricing of insurance for work accidents [fr].[39]\n\nAn administrative tribunal [fr] whose rulings may be appealed [fr] to the administrative court of appeal [fr] of Douai.\n\nThe Regional Chamber of Auditors [fr] of Picardy.\n\nEnvironmental policy\n\n[edit]\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\n\n[edit]\n\nAmiens is twinned with:[40]\n\nDortmund, Germany (1960)\n\nGörlitz, Germany (1971)\n\nDarlington, England, United Kingdom (1973)\n\nTulsa, United States (2006)\n\nAmiens also has friendly relations with Mianyang in China and Amiens in Australia.[40]\n\nPopulation and society\n\n[edit]\n\nDemography\n\n[edit]\n\nThe inhabitants of Amiens are called the Amiénois[41] and their blason populaire is Chés maqueux d'gueugues (the eaters of nuts).\n\nThe population of Amiens has risen sharply since the mid-19th century: Its population doubled between 1850 and 1960, from 50,000 to 100,000 inhabitants, i.e. a gain of 50,000 people over this period of 110 years, and gaining about 30,000 others since (over 50 years only this time).\n\nDemographic evolution\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2017, the commune had 134,057 inhabitants.[42]\n\nHistorical population\n\nYearPop.±%179340,000— 180041,279+3.2%180639,853−3.5%182141,107+3.1%183145,001+9.5%183646,129+2.5%184147,117+2.1%184649,591+5.3%185152,149+5.2%185656,587+8.5%186158,780+3.9%186661,063+3.9%\n\nYearPop.±%187263,747+4.4%187666,896+4.9%188174,170+10.9%188680,288+8.2%189183,654+4.2%189688,731+6.1%190190,758+2.3%190690,920+0.2%191193,207+2.5%192192,780−0.5%192691,576−1.3%193190,211−1.5%\n\nYearPop.±%193693,773+3.9%194684,761−9.6%195492,506+9.1%1962105,433+14.0%1968117,888+11.8%1975131,476+11.5%1982131,332−0.1%1990131,872+0.4%1999135,501+2.8%2007134,737−0.6%2012132,727−1.5%2017134,057+1.0%\n\nFrom 1962 to 1999: Population without double counting; for the years following: municipal population.\n\nSource: Ldh/EHESS/Cassini until 1999[43] and INSEE (1968-2017)[42]\n\nAge structure\n\n[edit]\n\nAmiens is distinguished by the youthfulness of its population. In 2017, more than 25% of the population of the city was less than 20 years old. The rate of people of an age over 60 years (19.3%) is also lower than the national rate (25.5%) and the departmental rate (25.4%). Like national and departmental allocations, the female population of the municipality is greater in number to the male population, with a rate of 52.5%, whereas the national rate is 51.6%.\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nPrimary and secondary education\n\n[edit]\n\nEducational institutions of the city fall under the supervision of the Academy of Amiens [fr][45] which develops curriculum according to the Inspection académique la Somme.\n\nOn 1 September 2010, 10,658 children were enrolled in the Amiens public schools: 4,341 in nursery school and 6,317 in elementary school [fr].[46]\n\nIn 2011, the Amiens agglomeration included 46 nursery schools, six elementary schools and 54 primary schools including eleven private. It had nine public colleges and six private colleges. Amiens has 24 schools:\n\nVocational high schools: Acheuléen, Édouard-Branly, Edouard-Gand, La Providence (private), Montaigne, Romain Rolland, Sacré-Cœur [fr] (private), Saint-Martin (private), Saint-Rémi (private) and Saint-Riquier (private).\n\nGeneral and technological high schools: Robert de Luzarches, La Hotoie, Jean Baptiste Delambre, La Providence (private), Sacré-Cœur [fr] (private), Saint-Martin (private), Saint-Rémi (private), Saint-Riquier (private) and Sainte-Famille (private).\n\nGeneral secondary schools: Louis Thuillier [fr], Madeleine Michelis (former high school for girls, established in 1883 by Marie Hugonin, wife of Charles Eugène Bertrand, mother of Paul Bertrand and niece of Bishop Flavien-Abel-Antoine Hugonin [fr], Bishop of Bayeux and Lisieux – the inaugural speech was delivered by Jules Verne.)\n\nTechnological lycées: Édouard-Branly, Édouard-Gand.\n\nHigher education\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Amiens metropole welcomes one of the largest student populations in France. In 2013, the city had 26,000 students (3,300 in short-term)[47] and 800 researchers[48] who are divided into some 40 institutions of higher education, 32 laboratories, and 10 units associated with the National Scientific Research Centre or the French Institute of Health and Medical Research.\n\nHealth\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) or, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire of Amiens Picardie, is organized around four sites:\n\nSouth Hospital, Avenue René-Laënnec\n\nNorth Hospital, Place Victor-Pauchet\n\nSaint-Victor Centre, 354 Bis Boulevard de Beauville\n\nObstetrics and Gynaecology Centre, 124 Rue Camille-Desmoulins\n\nSince 2014, the four sites have been gradually gathered on the current site of the South Hospital, with the exception of the long stay units for the elderly remaining in the Saint-Victor Centre. This merger will be completed in 2016 and allow the CHU of Amiens to increase its national and inter-regional dimension. This group represents the largest hospital construction of France and one of the most important in Europe with more than €630 million for work and equipment.

Point of pain confusion, here, point of exaggeration or smell. It is absolutely empirical of supreme swelling.\n\nAmiens Cathedral deserves the name given by M. Viollet-le-Duc, 'the Parthenon of Gothic architecture'.\n\n— John Ruskin, The Bible of Amiens\n\nThe city is famous for its Notre-Dame Cathedral, masterpiece of Gothic art and one of the largest cathedrals in the world by its interior volume (200,000 m3 (7,100,000 cu ft)).[74] The largest religious and medieval building of France, its interior could twice hold Notre-Dame de Paris.[75]\n\nThe cathedral measures 145 metres (476 ft) long and its spire rises 112 metres (367 ft) high. The vaults of the central nave, finished in 1247, are 42.3 metres (139 ft), close to the maximum limit for this architecture.\n\nDating back to the 13th century, its construction is due to the wealth of the city in the Middle Ages and to the fire of the Romanesque cathedral which stood previously. Three architects, including Robert of Luzarches succeeded to complete the construction.\n\nAmiens Cathedral is notable for the coherence of its plan, the beauty of its three-tier interior elevation, the particularly fine display of sculptures on the principal façade and in the south transept, and inlays of its floor. It is also described by John Ruskin as \"Gothic, clear of Roman tradition and of Arabian taint, Gothic pure, authoritative, unsurpassable, and unaccusable.\"\n\nRegarded as the archetype of the classic Gothic style, the cathedral also presents some elements of the radiant Gothic style and flamboyant Gothic. The speed of construction, barely 70 years for the shell (1220 to 1269), explains this remarkable homogeneity of style. Its façade is decorated with more than 3,000 statues, gargoyles and chimeras.\n\nRegistered since 1981 as a World Heritage Site of UNESCO, it is a \"masterpiece of world heritage\". For a second time in 1998, it is a monumental step on the Camino de Santiago. Despite the two World Wars of the 20th century, which severely affected the city, it managed to stay intact.\n\nA show of the reproduction of the original polychromy[76] of façades, discovered as a result of recent laser cleaning, is given annually for free in December and during the summer period. The show is a projection on the façade of slides in color.\n\nThe zodiac [fr] is a set of reliefs on the foundations of the western façade formed series of quatrefoil medallions, carved in a representative agrarian calendar and the signs of the zodiac.\n\nThe statue of the weeping Angel [fr] that is on a tomb carved by Nicolas Blasset [fr], and the reliefs evoking Saint-Firmin and St. John the Baptist, are some of the well-known works of the cathedral.\n\nAt ground level lies the intact labyrinth [fr] of 234 metres (768 ft) long.\n\nOn the north side of the cathedral is the former Palace of the Bishop of Amiens [fr], occupied by the École supérieure de commerce [fr] in Amiens.\n\nThe cathedral seen from the Rue André\n\nWest entrance\n\nEntrance\n\nThe labyrinth\n\nThe choir\n\nColumns\n\nMausoleum of Charles de Vitry\n\nTomb of Canon Lucas\n\nBelfry\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Belfry of Amiens [fr]\n\nThe origin of the Belfry of Amiens dates back to the establishment of the commune of Amiens by Louis VI. It is mentioned for the first time in an arbitral award issued by the chapter of Amiens in 1244.\n\nSymbolizing the independence of the commune, it was formerly used for meetings of the notables of the city and then as archive rooms, weapons store and prison. A spotter nearby monitored arrivals and warned the population of the external dangers. During the Middle Ages, the building was repeatedly engulfed by fire.\n\nThe belfry is composed of a base in white cut stone, built in the 15th century between 1406 and 1410, a stone superstructure bell tower built from 1749 with Baroque volutes at its base, and a dome covered with slate and then the renowned arrow weather vane. At the time, a huge 11-ton bell was installed inside, it was later destroyed along with the dome, whose copper component melted, in the bombardment and fire of the city on 19 May 1940. Abandoned and devoid of a roof since World War II, the monument was fully restored between February 1989 and July 1990.\n\nLocated on the Place au Fil, the old central square of the city before the arrival of the railway and the rise of the Rue des Trois Calloux, the belfry is adjacent to Les Halles and the back of the city hall.[77] At a height of 52 metres (171 ft), it rings every hour of the day.\n\nSince July 2005, the belfry of Amiens is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as part of a set of 56 Belfries of Belgium and France which were inscribed because of their architecture and their importance in the rise of municipal power in Northern France and Belgium.[78] The belfry is also recorded in the inventory of Historic Monuments.\n\nCirque Jules-Verne\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Cirque Jules-Verne [fr]\n\nIn 1845, the traditional fair of Saint-Jean, formerly held at Place René Goblet, was transferred to Place Longueville. It is a wide esplanade that took the place of the Longueville bastion, after the demolition of the city walls in the early 19th century. Each year, a temporary circus is established for this occasion.\n\nIn 1865, a circus company emerged to claim a permanent circus, which would be built in wood by the Schytte contractor in 1874. However, expensive maintenance prompted the municipality to consider the construction of a new building. The decision was made in 1886 under the leadership of Mayor Frédéric Petit and the work began.\n\nThe Chief Architect of the Somme, Émile Ricquier [fr], a disciple of Gustave Eiffel, was responsible for its construction. It was inspired by the Cirque d'hiver of Paris but with a cast metal frame, supplemented by brick from the local countryside. The architect of civil buildings, Charles Garnier, claimed that the frames should be hidden with a plaster imitating stone. The \"moderninst\" design of Ricquier, who chose to display the structure, and to favor local material such as brick, is visible at the rear of the monument.\n\nWith its 16-sided polygonal shape and a diameter of 44 metres (144 ft), it includes lodges and stalls in its enclosure. As a completely modern project, it hosted two steam engines, dedicated to fully electric lights and central heating. Since its construction, it was also the first circus which included a buffet and a refreshment bar. The cost of the construction of the building finally reached double the forecast.[79] In 1888, the new city councilor responsible for festivals and celebrations, Jules Verne, was responsible for monitoring the work, and it was he who opened it on Sunday 23 June 1889, for the opening of the fair and the centenary of the French Revolution:[80]\n\nThe new circus is a work of art that your municipal administration wanted to build with all of the enhancements of modern industry. It is the very best, undoubtedly, it is also the most comprehensive, with its facilities and equipment, to have been built in France and abroad.\n\nThe roof was damaged by a shell in 1916. The circus was the setting for Federico Fellini's The Clowns (1971), and the film by Jean-Jacques Beineix, Roselyne et les lions (1989), with Isabelle Pasco as lead actress. The largest of the circuses of the province with its 3,000-seats, the building has acquired a multidisciplinary use for decades of performances of theatre, dance, concerts, galas, sports and public meetings.\n\nRenovated in 2003, it now bears the name of Cirque Jules Verne. After hosting the performances of Cirque Rancy [fr], it hosts resident Cirque Arlette Gruss [fr].\n\nSince 1 January 2011, the circus has been labelled \"national hub circus and street arts\", managed by an EPCC [fr]. It is one of seven in France and is still in use today.[81]\n\nThe house of Jules-Verne\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1882, Jules Verne and his wife, Honorine, rented the house at the corner of Rue Charles-Dubois and Boulevard Longueville until 1900. Acquired in 1980 by the city, the house is labeled Maisons des Illustres by the Ministry of Culture. Restored in 2006, thanks to the work of the Centre international Jules-Verne [fr], this 19th-century mansion, listed in the supplementary inventory of historic monuments [fr], traces through the exhibition of more than 700 objects, the personality, the sources of inspiration and memories of Jules Verne.\n\nTour Perret\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Tour Perret (Amiens)\n\nOpposite the Gare d'Amiens, is located the Tour Perret (from the name of its architect Auguste Perret). Over 100 metres (330 ft) high, it was one of the first skyscrapers built in Europe, and the highest for a long time.[82]\n\nThe Church of Saint-Leu\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Église Saint-Leu d'Amiens [fr]\n\nThis church was built at the end of the 15th century, on the model of the hall-churches. It is dedicated, as its district, to Saint Leu, referring to the 7th century bishop who was exiled to the Vimeu. It has three naves. A flamboyant portal adorns the base of the steeple. The latter, struck by lightning, had to be rebuilt at the beginning of the 16th century. The ends of beams are carved. Stone and wood statues date from the 17th century. The choir houses the glory of the Duthoit brothers.\n\nOther notable buildings or monuments\n\n[edit]\n\nArchitecture from antiquity\n\n[edit]\n\nNumerous archaeological excavations have uncovered remains from proto-historic times to the Roman era. Two skylights cut in the last development of Place Gambetta, allow observation of a few remains of the forum. And, important remnants of a large Gallo-Roman theatre uncovered in early 2007, have been dismantled and stored in accordance with the rules of archaeological conservation, during the redevelopment of the Gare quarter in March 2007.[83]\n\nThe archaeological garden of Saint-Acheul testifies to the presence of Paleolithic man in the Somme Valley some 450,000 years ago.
