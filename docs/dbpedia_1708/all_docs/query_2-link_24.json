After developing expertise in Leveraged Buyouts (LBO) operations within BNP Paribas and Crédit Agricole Groups, he has more recently built a strong reputation in the Real Estate sector.\n\nIt was during his most recent role as the Head of Corporate Finance at Indosuez in Luxembourg that he crossed paths with Patrice Cavalier, with whom he shared common projects and ambitions. Specifically, Nicolas played a crucial role in the search for the initial funds required to launch the boutique hotel division, 369° Hôtels-Maisons. He then naturally joined the team as the Chief Financial Officer of this emerging division in 2017.\n\nIn 2019, following a major strategic operation between Grand M Group and Brookfield, Nicolas was appointed as the head of the Finance department of HPC, which became Patrice Cavalier’s family holding company, a company he had contributed to shape and develop over the years into the diversified multiactivity group we know today. His current mission encompasses overseeing the entire group structuring process, as well as negotiation and execution of financings, whether they are bank loans, bonds, or equity.\n\nNicolas has been supporting Patrice Cavalier for over 8 years, and the continuous growth of the Net Asset Value of the group is a testament to their successful partnership around a shared strategic vision.
