        "text": "Objective\n\nTo evaluate return to work and sport rates of young athletic patients following knee osteotomy, including the highest level of sports participation and satisfaction with activities.\n\nMethods\n\nWe performed a cross-sectional study of patients of age 45 years or younger who underwent realignment osteotomy of the knee between 2005 and 2015. Data concerning work activities, sports participation and satisfaction were collected by a survey including the modified Naal and Weiss questionnaires, Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of satisfaction and Net Promoter Score (NPS).\n\nResults\n\nAnalysis of data from 60 patients with a median age of 38 (15–45) was performed. Of those 60 patients, 95% returned to sports following surgery, of whom 74% could return to their main preinjury sport or to a different sport of higher impact. The main preoperative sport types involved 65% high-impact, 23% intermediate-impact and 12% low-impact activities. The highest level of sport participation preoperatively was 13% professional, 7% varsity and 80% amateur (58% competitive, 42% recreational). Postoperatively 5% returned to professional level, 4% varsity and 91% amateur (14% competitive, 86% recreational), and at follow-up 22% of patients had retired from sports. At follow-up 88% of patients were still working, with 61% at the same activity level and 12% at a higher level than before surgery. The median NRS satisfaction score with activities in general was 6 (0–10), and with activities of daily living, work and leisure time 9 (0–10), 7 (0–10) and 6 (0–10), respectively. The main reasons for dissatisfaction were persisting knee pain (67%) and lack of range of motion (29%). The NPS was 14, indicating that patients would recommend the surgery to friends or family.\n\nConclusion\n\nYoung athletes can return to work and sport activities following realignment osteotomy of the knee. Although their levels of sports participation significantly decreased and satisfaction with their activity level was limited, we disagree with the opinion that a knee osteotomy directly leads to the end of an athlete's sporting career.\n\nLevel of evidence\n\nLevel III, prospective cohort study.\n\nknee\n\nOsteotomy\n\nosteoarthritis\n\ncartilage\n\nligament\n\nWhat are the new findings\n\n•\n\nYoung athletic patients can return to work and sport activities following realignment osteotomy of the knee.\n\n•\n\nAlthough their sport levels significantly decreased and satisfaction with activities was limited, they would recommend this procedure to family and friends.\n\n•\n\nThus, we disagree with the opinion that a knee osteotomy directly leads to the end of an athlete's sporting career, and so waiting until patients have already retired from their athletic careers should not always be preferred.\n\nIntroduction\n\nYoung athletic patients with knee injuries are a challenging population to treat. First, knee injuries can eventually lead to the early onset of symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA). Second, younger patients mostly expect to resume demanding physical activities, in both work and sports. Lastly, in younger patients a so-called ‘treatment gap’ for OA has been recognised.\n\n1\n\nLi CS\n\nKarlsson J\n\nWinemaker M\n\net al.\n\nOrthopedic surgeons feel that there is a treatment gap in management of early OA: international survey.\n\nDue to high expectations, non-surgical treatment options for OA are unlikely to offer sufficient and lasting improvements to young patients with knee OA.\n\n2\n\nSutton PM\n\nHolloway ES\n\nThe young osteoarthritic knee: dilemmas in management.\n\nFurthermore, surgical treatments such as arthroscopic debridement or knee replacement have limitations in long-term efficacy or appropriateness for the stage of the disease.\n\n1\n\nLi CS\n\nKarlsson J\n\nWinemaker M\n\net al.\n\nOrthopedic surgeons feel that there is a treatment gap in management of early OA: international survey.\n\n,\n\n3\n\nLondon NJ\n\nMiller LE\n\nBlock JE\n\nClinical and economic consequences of the treatment gap in knee osteoarthritis management.\n\nRealignment osteotomy is effective in offloading the affected arthritic compartment by performing a valgus or varus correction for a medial or lateral disease, respectively. Literature mostly concerns high tibial osteotomy (HTO) for medial compartment OA, which shows that both medial open-wedge and lateral closed-wedge HTO can reliably relieve pain and provide functional restoration,\n\n4\n\nMaquet P\n\nValgus osteotomy for osteoarthritis of the knee.\n\n,\n\n5\n\nAglietti P\n\nRinonapoli E\n\nStringa G\n\net al.\n\nTibial osteotomy for the varus osteoarthritic knee.\n\n,\n\n6\n\nGiuseffi SA\n\nReplogle WH\n\nShelton WR\n\nOpening-wedge high tibial osteotomy: review of 100 consecutive cases.\n\n,\n\n7\n\nSchallberger A\n\nJacobi M\n\nWahl P\n\net al.\n\nHigh tibial valgus osteotomy in unicompartmental medial osteoarthritis of the knee: a retrospective follow-up study over 13-21 years.\n\n,\n\n8\n\nSchröter S\n\nMueller J\n\nvan Heerwaarden R\n\net al.\n\nReturn to work and clinical outcome after open wedge HTO.\n\n,\n\n9\n\nBirmingham TB\n\nGiffin JR\n\nChesworth BM\n\net al.\n\nMedial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy: a prospective cohort study of gait, radiographic, and patient-reported outcomes.\n\n,\n\n10\n\nMcNamara I\n\nBirmingham TB\n\nFowler PJ\n\net al.\n\nHigh tibial osteotomy: evolution of research and clinical applications–a Canadian experience.\n\nwith survivorship of 95%–98% after 5 years and 56%–71% after 15 years.\n\n7\n\nSchallberger A\n\nJacobi M\n\nWahl P\n\net al.\n\nHigh tibial valgus osteotomy in unicompartmental medial osteoarthritis of the knee: a retrospective follow-up study over 13-21 years.\n\n,\n\n11\n\nNaudie D\n\nBourne RB\n\nRorabeck CH\n\net al.\n\nThe install award.

Therefore, the purpose of our study was to determine the rate of return to work and sport in athletic patients of age 45 years or younger undergoing either HTO or DFO at a minimum of 1 year after surgery. Furthermore, the level of sports participation and the level of satisfaction with activity levels were investigated.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy design\n\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study by administration of a survey that included questions concerning work, sports participation and satisfaction with activities. The survey was performed by telephone interview from March 2016 until December 2016.\n\nStudy participants\n\nAthletic patients of 45 years or younger at the time of surgery who underwent either HTO or DFO to correct the coronal or sagittal plane alignment (or both) were included. Patients were treated by one of three fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeons at our clinic, a tertiary care centre specialising in orthopaedic sports medicine surgery. Exclusion criteria were a follow-up of less than 1 year and lack of correct contact information. Also, patients with known revision to knee arthroplasty (KA) during follow-up were excluded. The rationale was that, although conversion to KA has typically been used as a failure endpoint for osteotomy, osteotomy survivorship was not of interest as an outcome for this study, neither was return to sport of a patient cohort following knee osteotomy converted to KA. The following baseline characteristics were collected: follow-up from the time of surgery to the time of survey, age at the time of surgery, sex, osteotomy type, osteotomy indication, performed additional surgeries and osteotomy fixation devices used.\n\nSurgical procedures\n\nAll three surgeons used similar surgical techniques. The desired angles of correction were preoperatively calculated with the use of long-leg standing weight-bearing radiographs, according to the principles of deformity correction of Dugdale et al.\n\n25\n\nDugdale TW\n\nNoyes FR\n\nStyer D\n\nPreoperative planning for high tibial osteotomy. The effect of lateral tibiofemoral separation and tibiofemoral length.\n\nThe osteotomy was performed with a single or biplanar cut, using both flexible and rigid osteotomes, under fluoroscopic guidance. Different fixation devices were used for HTO, depending on the degree of correction, stability of the osteotomy, possible concomitant ligamentous reconstruction and according to the surgeon's preference (table 1). All patients stayed at least one night in the hospital, and postoperative management included a hinged knee brace with early active full range of motion exercises. Depending on the indication and fixation method, 2–6 weeks of only toe-touch weight-bearing with crutches was allowed, gradually increasing to permitted full weight-bearing from 6 to 12 weeks, according to clinical and radiological evidence of osteotomy union. Plate removal was only performed when indicated.\n\nTable 1Baseline characteristics of participating knee osteotomy patients (n=60)\n\nVariableFollow-up (years), median (range)4.9 (1.4–11.3)Age (years), median (range)38 (15–45)Sex, n (%) Male38 (63) Female22 (37)Osteotomy type: HTO (n=51, 85%),\n\nn (%) Medial opening wedge41 (80) Lateral opening wedge7 (14) Lateral closing wedge1 (2) Anterior opening wedge1 (2) Anterior closing wedge1 (2)Osteotomy type: DFO (n=9, 15%),\n\nn (%) Lateral opening wedge4 (44) Medial closing wedge3 (33) Lateral closing wedge1 (11) Medial opening wedge1 (11)Osteotomy indication: OA (n=44, 73%),\n\nn (%) With ligamentous deficiency24 (55) Post-traumatic (clear history of trauma)11 (25) Primary (no clear history of trauma)9 (20)Osteotomy indication: other than OA (n=16, 27%), n (%) Compartment unloading9 (56) Cartilage pathology8 Meniscal transplantation1 Instability7 (44) PCL/PLC injury2 Multiligamentous injury2 Recurvatum1 ACL injury1 Patellofemoral instability1Additional surgery\n\n*\n\nAnything else other than knee arthroscopy±partial meniscectomy.\n\n: HTO (n=17), n (%) ACL5 (29) ACL-R5 (29) Bone grafting (first-stage ACL-R)2 (12) ACL-R and microfracturing OCL1 (6) Meniscal transplant1 (6) ACL-R and osteochondral allograft1 (6) Multiligamentous surgery1 (6) Distalising TTO1 (6)Additional surgery\n\n*\n\nAnything else other than knee arthroscopy±partial meniscectomy.\n\n: DFO (n=2), n (%) ACL-R1 (50) Removal of loose body1 (50)Osteotomy fixation device: HTO (n=51), n (%) Locking compression plate\n\n†\n\nTomoFix High Tibial Plates (DePuy Synthes, West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA) (n=27).\n\n‡\n\nContourLock (Arthrex, Naples, Florida, USA) (n=3).\n\n30 (59) Non-locking plate, wedged19 (37) Richard staples1 (2) PEEK implant1 (2)Osteotomy fixation device: DFO (n=9), n (%) Locking compression plate\n\n**\n\nTomoFix Distal Femur Plates (DePuy Synthes).\n\n9 (100)\n\nACL, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; ALC-R, anterior cruciate ligament revision reconstruction; DFO, distal femoral osteotomy; HTO, high tibial osteotomy; OA, osteoarthritis; OCL, osteochondral lesion; PEEK, polyether ether ketone; PCL, posterior cruciate ligament; PLC, posterolateral corner; TTO, tibial tubercle osteotomy.\n\nOutcome measures\n\nFew instruments are designed to capture sports priorities of individual patients, especially those involved in high-demand sporting and recreational activities.\n\n26\n\nNoble PC\n\nDwyer M\n\nBrekke A\n\nCommonalities, differences, and challenges with patient-derived outcome measurement tools: function/activity scales.\n\nTherefore, our questionnaire consisted of a modification and combination of the Naal and Weiss questionnaires.\n\n27\n\nNaal FD\n\nImpellizzeri FM\n\nLeunig M\n\nWhich is the best activity rating scale for patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty?.\n\n,\n\n28\n\nNaal FD\n\nFischer M\n\nPreuss A\n\net al.\n\nReturn to sports and recreational activity after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.\n\n,\n\n29\n\nWeiss JM\n\nNoble PC\n\nConditt MA\n\net al.\n\nWhat functional activities are important to patients with knee replacements?.\n\nAdditionally, we included the Marx Activity Rating Scale (MARS) to objectively measure activity levels.\n\n30\n\nMarx RG\n\nStump TJ\n\nJones EC\n\net al.\n\nDevelopment and evaluation of an activity rating scale for disorders of the knee.\n\nMARS includes four items that assess the frequency of running, cutting, decelerating and pivoting, based on the subject's ‘healthiest and most active state in the past year’. Each item is scored on a scale ranging from 0 (less than 1 time per month) to 4 (4 or more times a week), resulting in a total score ranging from 0 to 16. For work activities we asked for their occupation, and for their work activity level as a ‘no activity’ (mostly sitting, desk work), ‘light’ (some walking, standing), ‘moderate’ (mostly walking/standing, some bending/lifting) or ‘high’ activity (all-day walking/standing, squatting/bending/lifting) job. To assess satisfaction, we used a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) where patients were asked to rate the levels of satisfaction with activities in general and of the activities of daily living, work and leisure time, including sports. An NRS general satisfaction score of lower than 6 was classified as dissatisfactory, referencing to the Dutch ten-point grading system . We also administered the Net Promoter Score (NPS), which is an overarching one-question measure of patient satisfaction widely used in service industries, recently introduced into the National Health Service, UK. This ‘friends and family test’ assesses the likelihood of the patient recommending the healthcare received to another and is seen as a discriminator of healthcare performance.\n\n31\n\nHamilton DF\n\nLane JV\n\nGaston P\n\net al.\n\nAssessing treatment outcomes using a single question: the net promoter score.\n\nThree categories of responders are identified and classified as ‘promoters’, ‘passives’ and ‘detractors’. An overall group score is calculated from the percentage of promoters minus the percentage of detractors (excluding the passives).\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nFor both baseline and outcome variables descriptive statistics of the SPSS V.21 software package were used to calculate continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages were calculated for nominal variables. Changes at the group level between the preoperative and postoperative work levels and the highest sports level were tested by using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (two-tailed).\n\nResults\n\nPatient demographics\n\nFrom January 2005 until January 2015, 353 knee osteotomies were performed on 313 patients. The median age at the time of surgery was 48 (15–70) years and 126 patients were 45 years or younger. Of these 126 patients, 4 were excluded because of revision to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) during follow-up and 33 patients because of unavailable correct contact details. The cohort of 89 eligible patients was called and emailed on at least three separate occasions, and 60 patients were reached and willing to participate (response rate 67%) (table 1).\n\nWork activities\n\nAt the time of surgery, 95% of the participants had paid employment. At the time of survey 88% of the patients were still working, so the return to work rate was 93%. Since osteotomy, the work activity level of 61% was unchanged, 26% worked at a lower activity level and 12% could work at a higher level following surgery (figure 1). Altogether, the work activity levels preoperatively versus postoperatively were not significantly different (z=−1.181; p=0.238).\n\nSport activities\n\nAll participants were active in sports before surgery. The main sport before knee symptoms restricted them from performing involved a high-impact sport in 65%, intermediate-impact in 23% and low-impact in 12%. Ice hockey was the most favoured sport (22%), followed by soccer (12%), skiing (10%), basketball (8%), American football (7%) and baseball (7%) (figure 2). Following osteotomy only three patients (5%) answered that they were not able to perform sports anymore, of whom one was already thinking about retiring from sport for reasons other than his knee. All three were HTO patients, indicated for osteotomy because of OA. Of the 95% of patients who returned to sport (n=57), 60% returned to their preinjury sport or to a sport of similar impact, and 14% to a sport of even higher impact. The highest impact of sport they could return to after surgery was for most patients a high-impact sport (53%), while 19% could return to an intermediate-impact sport and 28% to a low-impact sport (figure 3). At the time of follow-up (median 4.9 years), 22% had retired from sport, but 71% of the patients with a follow-up of more than 10 years were still performing sports. At the time of survey 37% of participants were still performing their main sport, of whom one patient could play ice hockey more than 10 years following his HTO. Considering indications and return to sport, we saw that 100% of the patients treated with osteotomy for indications other than OA could return to sport.\n\nThere were 8 participants (13%) who were professional athletes before knee osteotomy; 4 (7%) were varsity athletes and 48 (80%) amateur athletes, of whom 58% participated at a competitive and 42% at a recreational level. Of the 57 patients who returned to sport post knee osteotomy, only 5% still performed sport at a professional level, 4% at a varsity level and 89% at an amateur level, of whom only 14% were competitive and 86% on a recreational basis (figure 4). This decrease in highest sports level preoperatively versus postoperatively was significantly different (z=−4.702; p<0.001). The median MARS score at follow-up was 3.6 (0–14). Comparing osteotomy indication groups, the median MARS score of the OA group was 3.4 (0–14) and for the other indications 4.1 (0–11). The median MARS score of patients who could perform high-impact sports since surgery (n=28) was 5.9 (0–14).\n\nSatisfaction\n\nOf all participants (n=58; 2 missing: 1 DFO and 1 HTO), the median NRS general satisfaction score was 6 (0–10). A dissatisfied score (of lower than 6) was given by 24 patients (41%; 25% of DFO patients and 44% of HTO patients), of whom 79% underwent osteotomy secondary to OA. The main reasons for dissatisfaction were persistent knee pain (67%) and a lack of range of motion (29%) (table 2).\n\nTable 2Reasons for general dissatisfaction (NRS score <6) following knee osteotomy\n\nReasons for dissatisfaction (NRS general <6)n=24Medical issues, other than my operated knee4 (17%)Persistent knee pain16 (67%)Lack of range of motion in my knee7 (29%)Advice from my orthopaedic surgeon (who advised against returning to the activities I like to perform following osteotomy)4 (17%)Other11 (46%) Other knee issues/knee surgeries\n\n4 Instability2 Fear of reinjury/not trusting the knee2 Fracture1 Weakness in the leg1 Complications after surgery (not further mentioned)1\n\nNRS, Numeric Rating Scale.\n\nNRS satisfaction levels of activities in daily living, during work and of leisure time of all participants (n=59, 1 missing) and by indication are presented, which were all higher in patients with osteotomy indications other than OA (figure 5). The overall NPS for knee osteotomy was 14, and there were no patients who would ‘definitely not’ recommend the procedure to family or friends (table 3). The five patients who would ‘probably not’ recommend it (ie, 8% of the total group) were all HTO patients, all indicated for osteotomy because of OA. As expected, these patients also scored a low NRS of satisfaction about activities in general, with a median of 2 (0–7).\n\nTable 3Net Promoter Score of knee osteotomy (n=59, 1 missing)\n\nHTO (n=50)DFO (n=9)Total (n=59)Net Promoter Score103314 Definitely yes, n (%)21 (42)4 (44)25 (42) Probably yes, n (%)13 (26)4 (44)17 (29) Unsure, n (%)11 (22)1 (11)12 (20) Probably not, n (%)5 (10)0 (0)5 (8) Definitely not, n (%)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)\n\nDFO, distal femoral osteotomy; HTO, high tibial osteotomy.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this athletic patient cohort of 60 participants who underwent realignment osteotomy of the knee at age 45 or younger, 95% could return to sports following surgery within a median follow-up of 4.9 years. Of them, 74% returned to their preinjury sport or to another sport of the same or higher impact, but the highest sport level since osteotomy significantly decreased. At the time of follow-up 22% retired fully from sports, but 88% of patients were still working, with no significant change in working level. Satisfaction was limited, but only 8% would probably discourage the use of the procedure to family and friends.\n\nKnee osteotomy in athletes\n\nCongenital or acquired malalignment exacerbates the problems associated with repetitive overload and knee trauma.\n\n15\n\nWarme BA\n\nAalderink K\n\nAmendola A\n\nIs there a role for high tibial osteotomies in the athlete?.\n\nOA was the main indication for realignment osteotomy (ie, in 73% of our cohort), but offloading damaged compartments as an adjuvant procedure to joint restoration, or as an adjuvant procedure in instability cases, is also a good indication for knee osteotomy. The procedure provides both an offloading component as well as a more favourable mechanical environment in the presence of ligament laxity. In our young patient cohort, the return to work rate was 93%, which is comparable with the highest reported rates in the literature.\n\n32\n\nHoorntje A\n\nWitjes S\n\nKuijer P\n\net al.\n\nHigh rates of return to sports activities and work after osteotomies around the knee: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\nEvidence on the possibility of returning to professional or competitive levels of sports following knee osteotomy is sparse.

Moreover, 100% of the patients indicated for osteotomies other than OA could return to sport. In our cohort, there were eight patients who used to be professional athletes. Although a significantly decreased postoperative sports level was found, two of them (one basketball player and one skier) were still able to perform their sport at a professional level following osteotomy. Not ignoring the fact that at the time of follow-up 22% of our cohort retired from sports, one should take into account that many of those included in our cohort had complex knee pathology (table 1). In contrast to the high percentages of return to work and sport, the NRS satisfaction scores are not very high, indicating the high demands of our athletic patient cohort. Altogether, we disagree with the opinion that knee osteotomy itself directly leads to the end of an athlete's sporting career.\n\nKnee osteotomy for OA\n\nThere is increasing incidence of patients presenting with symptomatic OA at ages and activity levels less ideal for knee replacement.\n\n36\n\nPrice A\n\nBeard D\n\nThienpont E\n\nUncertainties surrounding the choice of surgical treatment for ‘bone on bone’ medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee.\n\nGiven the good results of HTO and the potential risks of wear, loosening or periprosthetic fractures related to sports activity with the use of KA,\n\n37\n\nSchmalzried TP\n\nShepherd EF\n\nDorey FJ\n\net al.\n\nThe John Charnley award. Wear is a function of use, not time.\n\nit is reasonable to consider HTO first when suitable indication criteria are present.\n\n38\n\nAmendola A\n\nBonasia DE\n\nResults of high tibial osteotomy: review of the literature.\n\nA key advantage of HTO over knee replacement is that HTO may allow unlimited activity following surgery, including running, jumping, cutting and pivoting. The results of our survey seem to support this concept. Comparing return to sport after TKA, unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA) and knee osteotomy, systematic reviews and meta-analyses show that patients after knee osteotomy participate in more sports following surgery, and they also perform sports of higher impact than after TKA and UKA.\n\n32\n\nHoorntje A\n\nWitjes S\n\nKuijer P\n\net al.\n\nHigh rates of return to sports activities and work after osteotomies around the knee: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n,\n\n39\n\nWitjes S\n\nGouttebarge V\n\nKuijer PP\n\net al.\n\nReturn to sports and physical activity after total and unicondylar knee arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\nAltogether, joint preservation techniques such as osteotomy might be able to at least delay knee replacement until the patient reaches an age at which the longevity of a knee replacement implant matches life expectancy.\n\nLimitations and strengths\n\nSome limitations of our study have to be acknowledged. First, a survey inherits the risk for recall bias concerning preoperative sports participation. By asking only about their preoperative main sports, we tried to reduce this bias. Second, we were not able to include all eligible patients at age 45 or younger at the time of surgery, since 33 were not contactable and 29 patients refused to join the survey, resulting in a follow-up rate of only 47%. This reflects the tertiary referral nature of the practice. However, incorrect contact information should not be a confounder of our outcome. Only the loss to follow-up by those who refused to participate could have been a possible self-selection bias,\n\n40\n\nKristman V\n\nManno M\n\nCôté P\n\nLoss to follow-up in cohort studies: how much is too much?.\n\nsince non-cooperating patients were not asked about the reasons why they declined to participate. The response rate of reachable eligible patients was 67%, which can be considered as fairly good and still resulted in a large number of patients of our interest. Third, the minimum follow-up time was chosen at 1 year. While this does not include the standard 2-year follow-up for clinical studies, the median follow-up of our survey cohort was 4.9 years and only three patients had a follow-up of less than 2 years (17, 19 and 22 months). All three patients had returned to sports by this time. Therefore, expenting the follow-up time will have no bearing on the main results. Another limitation of this cross-sectional study is that we do not know the exact time of when those 95% of patients who reported to have returned to sport since their osteotomy actually did return. Also, we do not know how long they were able to practise those sports, as we showed that during follow-up another 17% retired from sports. Lastly, we included both HTO and DFO in the analysis. While these are two different operations, with different short-term rehabilitation and surgical techniques, the ultimate goal is the same: to change the mechanical alignment of the knee. Since our hypothesis was that a change in mechanical alignment would have no bearing on return to work or sport activities, both HTO and DFO were included. This is supported by our results, in that 100% (n=9) of DFO patients and 94% (n=48 of 51) of HTO patients returned to sport. All patients returned to their main or to another sport of the same impact, of which 55% concerned a high-impact type of sport. The strength of our study is that we analysed a relatively large number of a specific patient cohort of interest treated in one single centre. Also, the generalisability is high since we included all types of knee osteotomies, on all indications, fixated with different stabilising devices and performed by three different sports orthopaedic surgeons.\n\nConclusion\n\nYoung athletic patients are able to return to work and sport activities following realignment osteotomy of the knee, and often to their main preinjury sport or to another sport of at least the same impact. Although sport levels decreased and satisfaction with activity levels was limited, most patients would recommend the procedure to their family and friends. Thus, this study does not support the reluctance of performing knee osteotomy in athletes.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe gratitude of the authors goes to the participants who made this study possible.
