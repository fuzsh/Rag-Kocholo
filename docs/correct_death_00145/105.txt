George Carlin (born George Denis Patrick Carlin on May 12, 1937 in Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA - died on June 22, 2008 in Santa Monica, California, USA) was a five-time Grammy-winning American stand-up comedian, social critic, actor, voice actor, producer, writer and author.

He played Mr. Conductor and his evil twin in Shining Time Station.

On June the 22, 2008, Carlin died of heart failure at a hospital in Santa Monica, California, at the age of 71. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered, without any religious ceremonies, as he wished. Following his death, Britt Allcroft and Rick Siggelkow wrote tributes to him, giving fond memories of working on the show with him and knowing him personally.

While Carlin usually insulted most of the shows that he did due to issues like directors (like his time on his own television series The George Carlin Show), he usually spoke very fondly of both Shining Time Station and Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends. He claimed in various interviews and in his posthumous book "Last Words" that he loved working on the show for various reasons. He wanted people to see a more gentle side to him, it helped his career and it brought him more out of his shell as Britt Allcroft explained in her tribute to him. Both shows helped George connect with Britt on how the two had lonely childhoods despite having siblings.

Trivia

He, Ringo Starr, and Alec Baldwin have hosted "Saturday Night Live" and made guest appearances on The Simpsons. Brian McConnachie has worked on both shows as well.

He was good friends with Russell Means, who played Billy Twofeathers in "Thomas and the Magic Railroad". He was also friends with Jerry Hamza, who helped produce all of Carlin's HBO stand-up comedy specials for thirty years and wrote a biography on Carlin as well.

He starred in the 1976 film "Car Wash" along with Leonard Jackson, who played Harry Cupper in Shining Time Station.

George has referenced Shining Time Station twice in his comedy works after his time on the show. The first time in his 1999 HBO special You Are All Diseased where he was talking about children by saying: "And remember this is Mr. Conductor talking, I know what I'm talking about!". The second time was in his book and audiobook "More Napalm and Silly Putty" where he repeated the same subject.

George's work on Shining Time Station was referenced in "Blue Water" Comics Tribute Issue to him, on the page showcasing his biggest roles in the 1990s.

The reason he didnâ€™t reprise his role as Mr. Conductor in Thomas and the Magic Railroad is because after narrating the fourth series, Carlin left the series to do several explicit comedy specials and pursued other projects.
