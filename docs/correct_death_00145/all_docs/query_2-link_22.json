Though Mr. Carlin attended the church school as a child, he was an atheist for much of his life, and his vulgar remarks about the Catholic Church turned off school officials.\n\n“The sign will stand about 75 feet to the right of where we wanted it, so the children are safe,” Mr. Bartini told the New York Times.\n\nMr. Carlin’s views on faith were a focal point of the ceremony- he was “a priest to all the damaged Catholic people,” comedian Colin Quinn told DNAinfo.\n\nAmong the other comedy heavyweights who attended the ceremony were Gilbert Gottfried, Judah Friedlander and Robert Klein.\n\nBut it was the lesser-known speakers who led to some of the best moments, according to the Times.\n\nCouncilman Mark D. Levine, who represents the Morningside Heights District, exclaimed “motherfucker” at one point during his speech- fitting, since it’s one of Mr. Carlin’s seven dirty words.\n\nAnd after the ceremony, Mr. Carlin’s 83-year-old brother Patrick smoked a joint in Morningside Park."
