        "text": "Hi Bob:\n\nGeorge Carlin was one of the nicest people I ever knew. I will miss his humor, and the rare talks we would have over the years about comedy, music, family and life.\n\nI met him in 1983 as he was in the comeback mode after years battling addiction and health issues. He had just released an album called CARLIN ON CAMPUS, and I was the young promotion man working it at radio in the North East and I was about 21 years old.\n\nI remember calling his office, because I had a ton of AOR radio programmers and morning show producers calling me to get a shot at an interview or a live on the air visit to the many stations that were playing his first album on his own label called EARDRUM RECORDS.\n\nAgain, I was a kid, a huge fan, and I called his office and this guy answered the phone, and I said something like \"Hi, this is Joe Reagoso and I have some radio requests around the new project, and I was calling to see if Mr. Carlin would be available to give us some help………etc.\" Then this person who answered the phone said something to the effect of \"No problem, Joey…..I will ask Mr. Carlin and get back with you.\" I gave the fellow my information, and then I asked him his name and he said \"This is George Carlin.\" I almost died. Here is my favorite comedian in life calling me \"Joey\" and actually speaking with me and clowning around.\n\nWe met at Lafeyette University near Allentown PA, in a school locker room after the show, his backstage area.\n\nWe talked about the album, radio op’s, retail stuff, and then the topics shifted to the likes of Rudy Ray Moore, Redd Foxx, Lord Buckley, and so on…then family, neighborhoods, music, etc. He always wanted to know how the family was. A very family kinda guy for sure.\n\nSince I was a student of comedy recordings, he and I became very good friends over the years, exchanging a lot of material, tapes, cds, etc. He at one time sent me a box of cassettes with some of the raunchiest shit I ever heard, and I couldn’t stop laughing. I still have some of them in my IPOD and it will always be a reminder who hipped me to the routines. He collected a lot of this stuff, archived it. He had roasts and early beatnick rap stuff, and comedy from all eras.\n\nFor the next three decades, I went to a bunch of his concerts and casino shows. Never using the same material, always a new and fresh presentation, Carlin was a true American original.\n\nHe taped all of his shows, he analyzed his material, always striving and creating the best he could do, and it worked, look at the run he had. It never peaked, he was always doing something new and challenging for both himself, but more so for his worldwide audience.\n\nI can cite several shows where even I wanted to shrink and hide, I was so embarrassed. I mean the guy would explore taboos unknown to other comedians or actors. Once he was going into something edgy in Atlantic City, and I was with some family, and I knew it was time to either get the hell out of the place, or just pretend I didn’t hear what he just said. I mean the guy knew how to make you laugh, but maybe it wasn’t the kind of stuff we should be laughing at….that was the unique quality of his comedy.\n\nHe would call me when he was in a city nearby, and we would hook up at the gigs, and I would usually take a friend or someone in the music field with me, and they would just freak out, because I would never tell them that we were going to meet him. One time, I was at a very very lame MCA Records convention in 1999 in Vegas, and I was flying over the town, and I saw a huge sign \"CARLIN at the MGM GRAND\".\n\nI called him as soon as the plane landed and I said I was in town, and he he asked me how many tickets I needed, and I said \"I am at this very lame convention, and I have a staff of about 20 folks\", and he said \"Great….bring them to the gig and then we’ll meet up after the show.\" Well, it was about 120 degrees that night, I snuck about 20 promotion folks out of the convention, and we walked over to the MGM GRAND. I didn’t really tell them what we doing up until the moment we left the convention, and they almost shit.\n\nGeorge, put us all in the first row seating area….and he was doing a very heavy show that night, for a casino, so that made it even more cool, and then as the gig ended, everyone thought we were going back to the convention, but I said, \"Hey Guys, we need to walk this way thru the greenroom.\" So, without telling anyone what was next, we all walked back to the green room area, and George walks out with his usual greeting to me \"Hey Joey…You Fuck.\" The promotion staff went bonkers. They had no idea that I even knew this guy, and here they were now, getting handshakes, autographs, pictures taken with the legend, etc. George was a very nice guy to do things like that, and it wasn’t rare. A very nice man indeed.\n\nHe actually put my wife and I in one of the final episodes of his George Carlin Show on FOX in the 90’s. I will never forget that as long as I live. I called him one time, and asked if he could put me in his show as a bar matron, or whatever, you know…wanting to have something for posterity. Well….we flew into Warner Studios and he brought my wife Karen and I through the whole process. I mean, we were at the production meetings, we saw the writing sessions, the rehearsals, the live audience tapings, the pre-show tapings, etc. The episode featured Tommy Chong, and if you could imagine this shit, George Carlin and Tommy Chong getting a delivery of pot mailed to Carlin’s address by mistake….I mean it was a once in a lifetime scripts and t.v. moments. At any rate, he put me and the wife in the bar scene throughout the entire show! Then several transition scenes too, like walking by him on the street and waving hi to us…. It was very heavy for me. I have to be honest with you. I never expected him to give us the royal treatment. I just thought I would be in it for a second or two….. no….you know what George did as well….he put us in the national t.v. commercial announcing the new episode, which ran for a week, and then during the very big Sunday Night Football program on FOX, so everyone I knew in life was calling me in disbelief.\n\nDisbelief, that is the feeling I have today. I got a call from Michael Lessner at Live Nation, missed the call, opened up my email, and then I got the NY TIMES headline and my heart sunk. Shocked somewhat, numb and bummed out, yes. He was a friend for life. He and I had some very amazing conversations over the years that will live on in my heart and memory for the rest of my life. He was a caring guy, took me under his wing, when I was a kid, and never forgot about me, my family, my friends or my label compadres. He loved music, loved comedy, loved his family. If you knew him, he was the same guy you saw on television, he was a funny funny man. No doubt about it.\n\nI remember a year ago, you had seen the HBO special, and you were analyzing it, and I sent it over to George. There was a segment in that show called \"Uncle Dave\", and before he died, probably the last time I saw him in Long Beach, right when I moved here, I told him that this routine was a very heavy piece of comedy that actually brought some tears to my eyes. It was about how the average guy who gets fucked over his whole life, by his boss, by school mates, by his friends, by ill health, by bad shit all around, and then how it happens when you die that all of the great ones come back like Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and all the other \"Uncle Daves\" finally get their just break. They finally get the pay raise, they finally get recognition, etc. I mean it was like a 45 minute piece in artistry, that I never heard anyone do since or probably never be able to do. I remember telling him how in the beginning, it sounded like a typical funny bit, but then it turns into this serious piece of commentary which takes you to the next level. George stood up for the Uncle Daves in this world. Maybe that is why we all dug the man.\n\nGeorgie….I miss you man! God is watching over you now. May God Bless you and your wonderful family. Our prayers are with you.\n\nYour old bub,\n\nJoe Reagoso"
