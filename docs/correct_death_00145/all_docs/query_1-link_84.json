        "text": "If there’s a definitive illustration of the adage that whatever doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, it might be the early years of George Carlin’s stand-up-comedy career.\n\nCarlin swam mightily through the lukewarm ooze of American pop culture, opening for lounge acts like Joey Heatherton, Barbara Eden and Robert Goulet. He appeared on regrettable television shows, the kinds of things that will play on every television station in hell: “John Davidson at Notre Dame”; “Perry Como’s Holiday in Hawaii”; “The Tony Orlando and Dawn Rainbow Hour.” He became a grizzled, bankable survivor. A weird anger began to light him, like an ingested lava lamp, from within.\n\nCarlin died on June 22, 2008 — a dark day for those who sought regular injections of his word-drunk, reflexively anti-authoritarian humor. Carlin already has had a busy afterlife. His “sortabiography,” “Last Words,” written with Tony Hendra and published last year, turned out to be better, chewier, more touching than it had any right to be. On the horizon is an oral history, compiled by his daughter, Kelly Carlin McCall.\n\nIn the meantime we have “Seven Dirty Words: The Life and Crimes of George Carlin,” a biography from entertainment journalist James Sullivan. It’s a bantamweight book, thinly sourced. Its wordplay is more John Davidson than Bob Dylan. But it fills in, and complicates, our mental image of Carlin, and it isn’t long or distinctive enough to generate a genuine dislike.\n\nSullivan, whose previous books are “The Hardest Working Man: How James Brown Saved the Soul of America” and “Jeans: A Cultural History of an American Icon,” has bravely avoided padding out his book with quotations from Carlin’s stand-up routines.\n\nHe has succeeded too well. You miss Carlin’s voice. (“If crime fighters fight crime and firefighters fight fire, what do freedom fighters fight?” he asked, in a quotation that is provided.) The scarcity of direct quotation prevents you from getting a clear sense of how Carlin’s acid comic voice developed.\n\nThis book gets the story told, however, and Sullivan convincingly makes the case that for 50 years Carlin “may well have produced more laughs than any other human being.”\n\nCarlin was born in 1937 and grew up in the Morningside Heights section of Manhattan, a neighborhood he called White Harlem. His father, who’d been born in Ireland, was a talker, a newspaper ad salesman who won a national Dale Carnegie public speaking contest in 1935. He was a drunk, though, and Carlin’s mother fled with her children while George was still a baby.\n\nCarlin began a lifelong pot-smoking habit when he was a teenager. He began hanging out on street corners. He dropped out of high school at 16. Everyone who met him, though, recognized one thing. “The kid,” Sullivan writes, “had a mouth on him.”\n\nDuring a rocky stint in the Air Force he began to work at a radio station, KJOE in Shreveport, La. Listeners liked him. He had more going for him than a nice baritone. He also worked at stations in Boston, Texas and California before turning to stand-up comedy.\n\nCarlin had been weaned on Mad magazine and later the brainy, subversive patter of comics like Lenny Bruce and Mort Sahl. After working the club circuit, he began appearing on Mike Douglas’ and Merv Griffin’s TV talk shows. He began popping up on Jack Paar’s “Tonight Show,” and then Johnny Carson’s. He would ultimately appear with Carson more than 100 times.\n\nAs the 1960s dragged on, Carlin began to realize he was aiming at the wrong demographic, parents — not the new generation of college-age baby boomers. He changed his act. It got druggier. He began taking on the Vietnam War and politics. He became an admirer of Paul Krassner’s counterculture magazine, The Realist. He grew a beard and let his hair grow.\n\nHis career briefly took a step back before leaping forward. He began playing hip clubs and college theaters instead of Las Vegas lounges, taking comedy to a rock ‘n’ roll audience. He also released several popular comedy albums. He first performed his landmark routine, “Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television,” in 1972. It got him arrested in Milwaukee. When a New York radio station played it at lunchtime, the FCC issued on order prohibiting the routine’s language as “indecent.”\n\nThe case went to the Supreme Court, which upheld the ruling. But the controversy put Carlin permanently on the map. Lenny Bruce, he said, “was the first one to make language an issue, and he suffered for it. I was the first one to make language an issue and succeed with it.”\n\nCarlin was the first guest host on “Saturday Night Live.” For a generation he defined satirical late-night humor. His gifts were reminiscent not just of Bruce and Sahl but of Mark Twain and H.L. Mencken and Kurt Vonnegut and Hunter S. Thompson. In the late ’70s he began doing free-form concert specials for HBO, a series he would continue until shortly before his death.\n\nSullivan writes well about Carlin the comic’s comic, a man of vast productivity who took pride in writing his own material. Many comics manage to stretch a few thin bits into entire careers; Carlin wrote a new show from scratch every year or two.\n\nYou won’t get a strong sense from “Seven Dirty Words” of what Carlin was like offstage. We learn about his drug use and, later, his obsession with good red wine. He was married to his first wife, Brenda, for 36 years, until her death. But Sullivan suggests there might not have been that much to know. Carlin was a workaholic, usually on the road or at his desk, working on his next show.\n\nWhat got him, in the end, was his ticker. He died of heart failure, after suffering his first heart attack in 1978.\n\nCarlin wasn’t big on reverence. To Civil War re-enactors he said, “Use live ammo.” He did a riff about how we devote a moment of silence to the dearly departed, and why there aren’t variations on that theme. “How about a moment of muffled conversation,” he asked, “for the treated and released?”\n\nWell, here’s a cockeyed salute, then, a moment of dazzled mental genuflection for a comic who, every once in a while, felt like the most alive human being on the planet."
