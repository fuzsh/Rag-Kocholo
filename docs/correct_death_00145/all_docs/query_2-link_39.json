        "text": "George Carlin — whose routines including a lengthy riff on death and dying — will still be making fans laugh from the great beyond, as his estate is planning a significant relaunch of the comedian’s website, complete with the promise of previously unreleased or rare audio recordings.\n\nThe revamped site will kick off on March 27, coinciding with the hanging of a Carlin portrait in the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery.\n\nThe first of the recordings featured will be from the 1972 Milwaukee Summerfest concert at which Carlin – who died in 2008, at the age of 71 – was arrested for performing his “Seven Dirty Words” routine.\n\nCarlin’s daughter, Kelly, is currently working on a memoir about her life growing up with him, “A Carlin Home Companion,” which will be released by St. Martin’s Press. She recently performed a one-woman show predicated on the material at the Falcon Theatre in Burbank, and oversees the estate along with Carlin’s longtime manager, Jerry Hamza.\n\nThe hoped-for Carlin renaissance will also include an influx of additional material for SiriusXM, which will offer the first of the comic’s 14 HBO specials, “On Location: George Carlin at USC,” in its entirety on April 1.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nBelow are clips culled from the Summerfest concert, in which Carlin — hardly at his best — is stoned, distracted and dealing with a restless audience. The “Filthy Words” routine, as it was actually titled, and the debate over whether it qualified as obscenity, ultimately went to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1978."
