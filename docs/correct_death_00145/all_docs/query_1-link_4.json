        "text": "Acerbic stand-up comedian and satirist George Carlin, whose staunch defence of free speech in his most famous routine Seven Words You Can Never Say On Television led to a key US supreme court ruling on obscenity, has died.\n\nCarlin, who had a history of heart trouble, went into St. John's Health Centre in Santa Monica, California, yesterday afternoon complaining of chest pain and died later that evening, said his publicist, Jeff Abraham.\n\nHe had performed as recently as last weekend at the Orleans Casino and Hotel in Las Vegas. He was 71.\n\n\"He was a genius and I will miss him dearly,\" Jack Burns, who was the other half of a comedy duo with Carlin in the early 1960s, told the Associated Press.\n\nActor Ben Stiller called Carlin \"a hugely influential force in stand-up comedy. He had an amazing mind, and his humour was brave, and always challenging us to look at ourselves and question our belief systems, while being incredibly entertaining. He was one of the greats.\"\n\nCarlin's jokes constantly breached the accepted boundaries of comedy and language, particularly with his routine on the Seven Words - all of which are taboo on broadcast TV and radio to this day.\n\nWhen he uttered all seven at a show in Milwaukee in 1972, he was arrested on charges of disturbing the peace, freed on $150 bail and exonerated when a Wisconsin judge dismissed the case, saying it was indecent but citing free speech and the lack of any disturbance.\n\nWhen the words were later played on a New York radio station, they resulted in a 1978 supreme court ruling upholding the government's authority to sanction stations for broadcasting offensive language during hours when children might be listening.\n\n\"So my name is a footnote in American legal history, which I'm perversely kind of proud of,\" he told the Associated Press earlier this year.\n\nDespite his reputation as unapologetically irreverent, Carlin was a television staple through the decades, serving as host of the Saturday Night Live debut in 1975 - noting on his website that he was \"loaded on cocaine all week long\" - and appearing some 130 times on The Tonight Show.\n\nHe produced 23 comedy albums, 14 HBO specials, three books, a couple of TV shows and appeared in several movies, from his own comedy specials to Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure in 1989.\n\nHe won four Grammy Awards, each for best spoken comedy album, and was nominated for five Emmy awards. On Tuesday, it was announced that Carlin was being awarded the 11th annual Mark Twain Prize for American Humour, which will be presented November 10 in Washington and broadcast on public television.\n\nCarlin started his career on the traditional nightclub circuit in a coat and tie, pairing with Burns to spoof TV game shows, news and movies.\n\nPerhaps in spite of the outlaw soul, \"George was fairly conservative when I met him,\" said Burns, describing himself as the more left-leaning of the two. It was a degree of separation that would reverse when they came upon Lenny Bruce, the original shock comic, in the early '60s.\n\n\"We were working in Chicago, and we went to see Lenny, and we were both blown away,\" Burns said, recalling the moment as the beginning of the end for their collaboration if not their close friendship.\n\n\"It was an epiphany for George. The comedy we were doing at the time wasn't exactly groundbreaking, and George knew then that he wanted to go in a different direction.\"\n\nCarlin was born on May 12 1937, and grew up in the Morningside Heights section of Manhattan, raised by a single mother. After dropping out of high school in the ninth grade, he joined the US air force in 1954.\n\nHe received three court-martials and numerous disciplinary punishments, according to his official website.\n\nWhile in the air force he started working as an off-base disc jockey at a radio station in Shreveport, Louisiana, and after receiving a general discharge in 1957, took an announcing job at a station in Boston.\n\n\"Fired after three months for driving mobile news van to New York to buy pot,\" his website says.\n\nFrom there he went on to a job on the night shift as a deejay at a radio station in Fort Worth, Texas. Carlin also worked various temporary jobs including a carnival organist and a marketing director for a peanut brittle.\n\nIn 1960, he left with Burns, a Texas radio buddy, for Hollywood to pursue a nightclub career as comedy team Burns & Carlin. He left with $300, but his first break came just months later when the duo appeared on Jack Paar's Tonight Show.\n\nCarlin said he hoped to emulate his childhood hero, Danny Kaye, the kindly, rubber-faced comedian who ruled over the decade that Carlin grew up in - the 1950s - with a clever but gentle humour reflective of its times.\n\nOnly problem was, it didn't work for him, and they broke up by 1962.\n\n\"I was doing superficial comedy entertaining people who didn't really care: Businessmen, people in nightclubs, conservative people. And I had been doing that for the better part of 10 years when it finally dawned on me that I was in the wrong place doing the wrong things for the wrong people,\" Carlin reflected recently as he prepared for his 14th HBO special, It's Bad For Ya.\n\nEventually Carlin lost the buttoned-up look, favouring the beard, ponytail and all-black attire for which he came to be known.\n\nCarlin is survived by wife Sally Wade; daughter Kelly Carlin McCall; son-in-law Bob McCall; brother Patrick Carlin; and sister-in-law Marlene Carlin."
