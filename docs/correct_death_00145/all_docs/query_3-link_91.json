        "text": "After a lengthy battle, George Carlin is finally getting his Way.\n\nThe late irreverent comedian had a street in Morningside Heights named in his honor Wednesday — a block away from where he grew up because of a dispute with a local church.\n\nThe 400 block of West 121st Street was designated as “George Carlin Way” in a bill that Mayor de Blasio signed into law during a City Hall ceremony.\n\nThe Corpus Christie Church on the 500 block of West 121th Street objected to sharing a street name with its former student and neighbor, because the church became the punch line of many of his barbed jokes.\n\n“I don’t think we have to open their minds to the debasement of the English language and attacks on religion,” Corpus Christi Church pastor Rev. Raymond Rafferty said in 2011, referring to the church’s students.\n\n“His early comedy made mockery of Corpus Christi parish and its priests.”\n\nTo accommodate the church, the honor was shifted by a block.\n\nIn a move that almost gave Carlin the last laugh, bureaucrats mistakenly drafted the legislation to name two blocks for the comedian– including the one with the church.\n\nOfficials said the error would be corrected in the fall and the Carlin Way sign will only be erected on the 400 block.\n\nCarlin, a five-time Grammy winner, died in 2008."
