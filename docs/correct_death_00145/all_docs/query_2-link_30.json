        "text": "Before George Carlin would tragically pass away on June 22, 2008, Texas would be extremely lucky to catch some of the final performances from the legendary comedian. There's really not much that needs to be said about George Carlin's career; he was & continues to be considered one of the greatest comedians that has ever lived. Not to mention the \"7 Words\" is still looked at as one of the most important pieces of comedy ever told.\n\nBefore George's passing in 2008, 3 Texas cities were lucky enough to see him during his last few performances.\n\nWhich Texas cities got to see George Carlin before he passed away in 2008?\n\nAs listed on Concert Archives, George would perform at:\n\nThe Bass Performance Hall in Fort Worth, Texas on March 22\n\nHouston's Verizon Wireless Theater on April 11,\n\nand amazingly El Paso got to see George just 1 month before he died; the Plaza Theater on May 17. We know he also performed in El Paso back in the 70s as this April 24, 1976 ticket stub shows the UTEP Gym was the location of this show.\n\nSome of the material he used was from his comedy special, It's Bad For Ya, but you'd find other classics like \"There is No God\", \"Keeping People Alert\" & and of course, the \"Seven Dirty Words\".\n\nGeorge Carlin has had quite a history with Texas during his life & career too\n\nGeorge actually lived in Fort Worth for about 6 months in 1959; that's where he met Jack Burns who worked for Radio WEZE in Boston before he became a comedian. And let's not forget some of the jokes he made about Texas too. Like the one you'll find on his audiobook, Napalm & Silly Putty:\n\n\"You know the good part about all those executions in Texas? Fewer Texans.\" - George Carlin\n\nAnd yet... George still came to Texas to perform plenty of times during his lifetime going back as early as 1972. While there's not much footage of him performing IN Texas, there is this piece of footage of him performing in Beaumont on June 10, 2007.\n\nWherever you are George, I hope you're screaming up at us. Even a decade later, we still miss your comedic genius. R.I.P. George."
