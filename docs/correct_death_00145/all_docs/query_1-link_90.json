        "text": "About the Book\n\nThe autobiography that Carlin had nearly completed before he died, \"Last Words\" chronicles the late comedian's illustrious career and includes commentary from Carlin's fellow comedian, Hendra.\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nFor the last 14 years of his life, the brilliant, caustic, and hilarious George Carlin worked on his autobiography--now, written with bestselling author Tony Hendra and posthumously published, Carlin has proven that even after death, he is still one of the funniest men who ever lived. One of the undisputed heavyweight champions of American comedy, with nineteen appearances on the Johnny Carson show, thirteen HBO specials, five Grammys, and a critical Supreme Court battle over censorship under his belt, George Carlin saw it all throughout his extraordinary fifty-year career, and made fun of most of it. Last Words is the story of the man behind some of the most seminal comedy of the last half century, blending his signature acerbic humor with never-before-told stories from his own life, including encounters with a Who's Who of 1970s celebrity--from Lenny Bruce to Hugh Hefner--and the origins of some of his most famous standup routines. Carlin's early conflicts, his long struggle with substance abuse, his turbulent relationships with his family, and his triumphs over catastrophic setbacks all fueled the unique comedic worldview he brought to the stage. From the heights of stardom to the low points few knew about, Last Words is told with the same razor-sharp wit and unblinking honesty that made Carlin one of the best-loved comedians in American history.\n\nReview Quotes\n\n.\"..frank and insightful...\"\n\n--\"Time\" magazine\n\n.\"..what \"Last Words\" ultimately reveals is how Carlin became a political protester, slam poet, cynic, polemicist and performance artist whose messages were delivered under the veneer of humor.\"\n\n--\"Washington Post\"\n\n\"\"Last Words\", a posthumous autobiography from George Carlin, is a jazzy, inward-looking piece of work...as a chronicler of the working of his own mind, Carlin is terrific.\"\n\n-- \"The New York Times\"\n\n\"[\"Last Words\"] sounds as if he is still with us, rested and ready to ridicule the latest cultural hypocrisies.\"\n\n--\"The Washington Times\n\n\"\n\n\"For comedy fans, this book is vital. It's easily worth its weight in gold for the biting observations on showbiz and its personalities.\"\n\n--\"San Francisco Chronicle\"\n\n\"Seven particular words are associated with the late comedian George Carlin, and sentimental is not one of them. But that's the surprising portrait that emerges from \"Last Words\".\"\n\n--\"Houston Chronicle\"\n\n\"The book is at turns biting and touching, and often both, which is what you would expect from a man for whom the sacred was profane and the profane, sacred.\"\n\n--\"Entertainment Weekly\"\n\n\"This is not a collection of setups and punch lines, but a candid, fearless accounting of his life and art...\"Last Words\" shows a comic master at the height of his storytelling powers and with no limit to what he had left to say.\"\n\n--\"L.A. Times\n\n\"\n\nAbout the Author\n\nBorn in New York City in 1937, George Dennis Patrick Carlin was one of the greatest and most influential stand-up comedians of all time. He appeared on The Tonight Show more than 130 times, starred in an unprecedented thirteen HBO Specials, hosted the first Saturday Night Live, and penned three New York Times bestselling books. Of the twenty-three solo albums recorded by Mr. Carlin, eleven were Grammy nominated and he took home the coveted statue five times, including a 2001 Grammy win for Best Spoken Comedy Album for his reading of his bestseller Brain Droppings. In 2002, Carlin was awarded the Freedom of Speech Award by the First Amendment Center in cooperation with the US Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colorado, and he was the named eleventh recipient of The Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in June of 2008. George Carlin passed away at age seventy-one on June 22, 2008 in Santa Monica, California. Tony Hendra was once described by The Independent of London as \"one of the most brilliant comic talents of the post-war period.\" He began his comedic career with Graham Chapman of Monty Python, appeared six times on the Ed Sullivan Show, was one of the original editors of National Lampoon, edited the classic parody Not The New York Times, starred in This Is Spinal Tap, and co-created and co-produced the long-running British satirical series Spitting Image for which he was nominated for a British Academy Award. He has written or edited dozens of books, most of them satirical, with the exception of two New York Times bestsellers: Brotherhood (2001) and Father Joe (2004). He is a senior member of the Board of the nation-wide story-telling community, The Moth."
