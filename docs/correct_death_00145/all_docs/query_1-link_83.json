        "text": "George Carlin was born on May 12, 1937 in the Manhattan neighborhood known as Morningside Heights. Randy Jurgensen was a year older, and met George when they were around 12 or 13 years old. The two were part of a group of seven kids who became lifelong friends. But while George went on to become a rebellious entertainer, Jurgensen took the opposite path, joining the NYPD. As a cop, Jurgensen worked narcotics and homicide, including solving a case that inspired the Al Pacino film Cruising — Pacino’s character was based on Jurgensen. After his time in the NYPD, Jurgensen became a film consultant and actor, appearing in movies including Superman, The French Connection, and The Godfather, where he played one of Sonny Corleone’s tollbooth assassins.\n\nWhile working the Cruising case, Jurgensen was asked to help on another, which led to him wearing a wire at New York’s Cafe Au Go Go in 1964 to capture “lewd and indecent” comedian Lenny Bruce in the act.\n\nJurgensen spoke to me about his lifelong friendship with George, the Lenny Bruce arrest, and how that pivotal moment in comedy history affected their friendship. Here is an edited version of that conversation.\n\nRANDY JURGENSEN: I was born and raised in Manhattan, on Amsterdam Avenue and 122nd Street, and attended a Catholic grammar school called Corpus Christi. George and I went there together. He was one grade behind me. Every nun in the place knew George. Maybe five of them knew me because they taught me, but every single one of them knew George. Everybody knew George.\n\nWe became tight when I got into the seventh grade and George was in sixth. There was always a group of us, a crew of about seven. George always had a wit about him. He was the kind of person that, you taught him something at 9:00 in the morning in school and 25 years later, he remembered it. He never had to do homework. If there was a circle of about four or five guys hanging out on the stoop, nine times out of 10 it was George that was talking. And George was the first one to smoke pot. He brought it into the neighborhood when he was around 12.\n\nWhether we played basketball, softball, stickball, whatever, George never played. He stayed on the sidelines and announced it, and you would’ve thought it was Abbott and Costello. He would say things like, “Now coming to the plate is left-hander Jurgensen. He doesn’t know where his left hand is. No, that’s not your left hand, that’s your left hand.”\n\nLARRY GETLEN: George once told me that when he was 11 years old, he would take the subway down to Times Square and sneak into theaters.\n\nRJ: Yeah, we did that too. And it was a dynamite plan, because we didn’t pay on the subway. We timed it so when we got there, four or five of us would run and get in just before the doors closed. One time, we went onto the Double Decker bus, about three or four of us, and we didn’t pay. A guy would come around with a big coin machine, and you were supposed to put a nickel in there. And we weren’t paying. He was like, “You’re going to pay!” And the people on the bus were like, “Leave the kids alone! Leave them alone!” And George stood up and did a big, “Thank you!”\n\nThere was a milk company on 125th Street, and the milk truck would come up Broadway. The back of it didn’t have doors — it had a canvas and chains on the outside. So one of us would get in front of the truck and slow it down, or hope for a red light, and we would run up behind it, get in there, and take the milk. We also got caught swimming bare-assed in the Hudson River. It was George, me, and four others. They were holding our clothes when we got out — they gave us our underwear to put back on. There was a radio call and a youth squad there, and they threatened to call our parents. So the word was, when they get to you, don’t give your right name. So they go down the line. I gave a name. I don’t remember what. Then Doc gave a name, then Ray Ray. And then they got to George. You know what name George gave them? Randy Jurgensen. Honestly. The squad cop said, “What?” And George is like, “Yeah, it’s j, u, r, g, e,…” I questioned him long after that, and he just broke out in a big smile.\n\nLG: Later on, George became a radio DJ and nightclub comedian, and you became a cop in New York.\n\nRJ: I went into the Army at 16 — I lied about my age — and wound up in Korea. Then I came back and became a cop in 1957, at 21 years old. I was assigned to Spanish Harlem, then about five, six years later, I found myself working undercover narcotics, where I stayed for 18 months. I would buy $75 half-loads.\n\nLG: What’s a half-load?\n\nRJ: A load would be 12 bags.\n\nLG: Heroin?\n\nRJ: Yeah. I would buy half-loads for about $75. You had to work in Harlem, East Harlem, Alphabet City, Bedford-Stuyvesant. You had to work these [then dangerous] neighborhoods, and your stomach told you when something wasn’t right. This one time, I go to make this buy in Alphabet City, and after I make the buy, I’m going down the stairs and I see hands and sneakers coming up, and I know I’m in trouble. So I beat it back up the stairs and get to the roof, I jump a couple of roofs and I go down a fire escape. By this point, I’ve totally lost my backup. I come out onto Delancey Street. And when I came out, I saw people wandering aimlessly, and standing in front of Ratner’s [restaurant] where they were looking at this black and white television. But I had the drugs, so I went into the 7th precinct just off Delancey, and the sergeant was behind the desk. There was nobody in the precinct. I gave the sergeant the narcotics, and gave him certain code numbers that only another cop would understand. And he shook his head up and down. I said, “What’s going on? What’s wrong?” And he looked at me and said, “Where the fuck you been? They just shot the president of the United States.” That was the last buy I made in narcotics.\n\nTwo weeks later, they called me in at midnight and told me they were setting me up in an apartment in Greenwich Village, and that I was going to work on catching a team that was assaulting, shaking down, and scamming gay people. There was even a couple of killings. I stayed on that for six months. Later on, they would make a motion picture inspired by that called Cruising.\n\nWhile I was working that case, I had a star above my right eye. Just a little flourish. After about a month or so, I got the nickname “Sparkle.” That’s what I was called in that world.\n\nLG: What kind of star are we talking about?\n\nRJ: When I went into the Village, I was looking for killers. So I didn’t go in there wearing a badge. I started wearing a leather jacket, because that was a different scene. I dressed casually, never raised my voice, was totally clean shaven. I met people who ingratiated me into that scene. And I was told that I should take on a persona. The guy next door helped me. So there was a star over my right eye and he put sparkles in there, and that’s how I went out at night. This got me admitted into the various clubs where there were performances going on. After six months, I got them. I got the gold shield [made detective] on that.\n\nBut while I’m doing this, the Manhattan DA’s office called me in one night at midnight and said, there’s a complaint from the Greenwich Village community that there’s a lewd and indecent act being performed in one of the nightclubs. So while I’m chasing killers, they pull me back and send me up to the Cafe Au Go Go wearing a wire. The opening act was Professor Irwin Corey, and the main act was Lenny Bruce.\n\nLG: What were some of the things Lenny was talking about?\n\nRJ: It was the curse words.\n\nLG: But in what context?\n\nRJ: Well, he would tell a story, and then he would go into, “Can you fucking believe that these cocksuckers were…” and it was raw. That’s where it would get going.\n\nLG: So they wanted him arrested not because of the themes he was talking about, but because of the words themselves — because he was using the F word?\n\nRJ: Yes. So I stood there the whole night. I knew of Lenny Bruce, I believe there had been an arrest in Chicago. [Bruce was arrested for obscenity in San Francisco in 1961, and in Los Angeles and Chicago on the same charge in 1962.] I didn’t find the act to be lewd and indecent.\n\nLG: Was it a packed crowd?\n\nRJ: Oh, yeah.\n\nLG: How did the crowd react to him?\n\nRJ: They knew more about Lenny’s history than I did. They knew what happened in Chicago. They knew what the act was about. I did not. Now look, just to give you an idea, when The Beatles came to Carnegie Hall, I was assigned to [New York governor Nelson] Rockefeller’s wife, Happy Rockefeller, who was pregnant. So I was up on the stage with The Beatles, and I never saw The Beatles, because I never took my eyes off Happy Rockefeller. So when I wore this wire, I never took my eyes off Lenny Bruce. I wanted to make sure I was getting this. But I brought the recording back to the district attorney’s office and went back to my other assignment, and a week later, I got called back to the DA’s office again at midnight. They said they couldn’t transfer the wire. It was inaudible. So I wore a wire again the next week and I went back to the club. But this time, I noticed there was a console there with a reel-to-reel tape going. The act had been taped. That’s a K & M — “keeping and maintaining” — and also A & P, “allowing and permitting.” So I went back, turned in my wire, and told them about this. Then we went back to the club, and Lenny was arrested. I went back in with them — it’s called continuity. I pointed out Lenny and the console with the tapes on it.\n\nWhile we were taking him out, Irwin Corey said to me — knowing the publicity that was coming — “Detective, would you arrest me?” I said, no, not today. So we took the reel-to-reel and issued summonses to the owners.\n\nLG: So you didn’t handcuff Lenny Bruce, but you pointed out who he was.\n\nRJ: Yes. I was still undercover. I had to go back to my apartment on Bleecker Street. I was very much aware, looking at the audience, that I didn’t know these people. But even if I did, they would have thought I was just one of the crowd watching Lenny Bruce.\n\nLG: Did you still have the star by your eye, or did you wash that off?\n\nRJ: No, I had to undo that. What you don’t want to do when you’re wearing a wire and you’re in a crowd is stand out. You want to blend in. That’s what I did.\n\nSo within a week, I got a phone call from George, and he said, “You locked up Lenny Bruce.” I said, “George, I didn’t lock him up. This was a complaint from the Greenwich Village community. They’re the complainant.” He didn’t [initially] know I was there that night. You don’t blow your cases by blowing that you’re undercover. So I never told anybody that I affected that arrest. He was talking about the police department. He said, “How could your fucking police department lock this guy up? How could you lock up Lenny Bruce like that?” And that’s when I made the mistake of saying, “George, I didn’t lock up Lenny Bruce. This is the way that it happened.” That’s when George realized I was there.\n\nLenny passed away soon after that. From that point on, George always accused me, tongue-in-cheek, of locking up Lenny Bruce.\n\nOne night in the 1990s, George performed at Foxwoods. George never forgot the neighborhood, never forgot where he came from. Wherever he appeared here on the east coast, at least 15 of us would go, we would bring our wives and so forth. And of course, George took care of the tickets. So we’re at Foxwoods one night, and he comes out and does what he does, and then he says, “I have to introduce a few people in the audience.” He introduces Jackie Mason, and they put a light on Jackie Mason. Then he introduces Robert Klein. Then he says, “And now, my boyhood friend who grew up to be a pretty famous detective, Randy Jurgensen!” So I stand up and the spotlight comes on me, and I got my family and everybody there, and then George says, “And do believe that he fucking locked up Lenny Bruce? Could you believe he locked up Lenny Bruce?” The audience was booing like hell.\n\nI saw Jackie Mason once while I was sitting outdoors in Little Italy with my wife, my son, and my daughter. Jackie was on the corner, I don’t know how many yards away from me, and we waved at each other. And Jackie starts saying, “See that man over there? That man locked up Lenny Bruce!”\n\nIn 1999, I was an associate producer on a movie called Goosed. Robert Klein co-starred, and I would pick him up every other day and drive him to the set. And Robert, who was in the audience at Foxwoods, would talk to me about locking up Lenny Bruce. He never let me forget that I locked up Lenny Bruce. I never got away from that night.\n\nGeorge was pissed off at the arrest. He definitely was pissed off at the arrest. But George was never, ever pissed off at me. I’m telling you that right now. My brother was in Vegas. I got my brother on the security detail for Elvis Presley. And George and my brother would sit and talk, and my brother would say George never, never, nope, George never turned against the neighborhood. When I went out to California on business, I stayed with George. When George was in Vegas, he had a condo there, I went out there. We always saw George.\n\nOne of the guys in our crew was Eric “Doc” Strom. You talk about two people being inseparable, that was him and George. George would announce the stickball games, and Doc had the chalk. He never played either. He kept the score. George was in California when Doc died, destitute. So when Doc died, George flew in from California and buried Doc. He paid for everything, and never told anybody.\n\nWhen George passed away, I was one of the people, along with his brother Pat and his daughter Kelly, who took his ashes and dropped some of them in the 712 Bar, where we used to hang out. We dropped some ashes over by the building he lived in, which was basically right alongside Corpus Christi. We went up to Riverside Drive where we all used to go and smoke pot and we dropped ashes there. We dropped some on Broadway. We might have also dropped some by the Hudson River.\n\nGeorge was a friend of mine. And we had this Lenny Bruce thing between us. From the day of his arrest until the state forgave him, it went on with me and George. I became known as the cop that locked up Lenny Bruce, according to George Carlin.\n\n###"
