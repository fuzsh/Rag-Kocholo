        "text": "George Carlin dropped a new comedy special on Tuesday, an impressive feat given he died in 2008. The stand-up comedian appears to have artificial intelligence to thank for the hourlong special, called George Carlin: I’m Glad I’m Dead. In it, he’s in signature provocateur mode, putting his usual satiric spin on modern phenomena from social media to smartphones, streaming services and mass shootings.\n\n“Other countries are fine killing one person at a time with guns, but this is America, where we do things bigger and better, and more often,” Carlin seemingly cracks. “There are so many mass shootings in America, it’s replaced bad traffic as the No. 1 excuse for being late. ‘Sorry I missed the morning meeting. A maniac with an AR-15 shot up my son’s preschool.’”\n\nThe hour-long special, which you can watch below, comes courtesy of Dudesy, which bills itself as a comedy AI that created and writes a podcast and YouTube show hosted by Will Sasso and Chad Kultgen. Sasso’s a comedian best known as a five-season cast member on Mad TV, and Kultgen’s a producer, novelist and journalist.\n\nThe pair describe their setup as a media experiment aimed at exploring AI’s creative limits and potential. They say they’ve given the AI access to their personal emails, text messages, social media accounts and online purchase and browsing histories and that the AI uses that information to create comedy segments tailor-made for them. Some on Reddit and beyond, however, have speculated that Dudesy isn’t really an AI, but just an AI-generated voice spouting words written by the podcast’s co-hosts. (In an interview with Business Intelligence for B.C., Sasso denied the AI is fake and said he can’t reveal the company behind the AI system due to an NDA.)\n\nRegardless of how much AI actually drives Dudesy, and how much of it is curated by humans, it’s now branched out into impersonating Carlin, a cussing ​anti-establishmentarian famous for his biting cultural commentary.\n\n“I tried to capture his iconic style to tackle the topics I think the comedy legend would be talking about today,” Dudesy says in a YouTube description of the video. “The chaos of the current American political landscape and class system, the influence of reality TV, and the increasing role of technology in society as AI is poised to change humanity forever are just a few of the subjects I cover.”\n\nThe title of the new special, I’m Glad I’m Dead, reflects Carlin’s posthumous eye-rolling at the state of the world. AI-generated images illustrate his rapid-fire, f-word-laced observations.\n\n“The current state of technology makes it a great time to be alive, especially if you’re dead,” he says, going on to talk about all the enlightening ways people could use technology, but don’t.\n\n“Right now, every single person in the connected world could be watching Harvard philosophy lectures for free on YouTube or listening to Nobel Prize-winning physicists explain the fundamental nature of reality on iTunes or reading about the history of literally anything on Wikipedia,” the resurrected Carlin says in the special. What are they doing instead? Using the powerful computers in their pockets “to watch monkeys jerk off with frogs.”\n\nThis is the second comedy special from Dudesy. The first, out in April 2023, featured retired NFL quarterback Tom Brady joking about football and dating apps after splitting from former wife Giselle Bündchen. Brady didn’t take kindly to his animated joke-cracking doppelganger, threatening legal action if Sasso and Kultgen didn’t take the special down.\n\nCarlin’s daughter, producer and screenwriter Kelly Carlin, is similarly unenthusiastic about algorithm-driven versions of her father’s work.\n\n“My dad spent a lifetime perfecting his craft from his very human life, brain and imagination. No machine will ever replace his genius,” she said in an email. “These AI-generated products are clever attempts at trying to recreate a mind that will never exist again. Let’s let the artist’s work speak for itself.”\n\nSome George Carlin fans leapt to support the comedian’s daughter when she posted the same statement to X, formerly known as Twitter. “I have zero interest in watching an AI version of your beloved dad or anyone else for that matter. Make it stop,” one wrote. Other fans have heaped adjectives like “incredible,” “astonishing” and “fantastic” on the new comedy special.\n\n“That was hands-down the best George Carlin hour I’ve ever seen. Amazing,” one wrote on YouTube.\n\nWrote another: “Man, this made me miss Carlin even more than I already did. Thanks Dudesy, this was something special. Totally brightened my rainy day.”\n\nIn the Dudesy podcast below, also posted Tuesday, Sasso and Kultgen share their own thoughts after watching I’m Glad I’m Dead. “That sounded exactly like George Carlin,” Sasso said, adding that he’s “still a little bit speechless at what we just saw.”"
