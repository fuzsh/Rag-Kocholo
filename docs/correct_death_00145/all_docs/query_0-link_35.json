        "text": "Are pre-hospital deaths from accidental injury preventable?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHussain, L. M.; Redmond, A. D.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE--To determine what proportion of pre-hospital deaths from accidental injury--deaths at the scene of the accident and those that occur before the person has reached hospital--are preventable. DESIGN--Retrospective study of all deaths from accidental injury that occurred between 1 January 1987 and 31 December 1990 and were reported to the coroner. SETTING--North Staffordshire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Injury severity score, probability of survival (probit analysis), and airway obstruction. RESULTS--There were 152 pre-hospital deaths from accidental injury (110 males and 42 females). In the same period there were 257 deaths in hospital from accidental injury (136 males and 121 females). The average age at death was 41.9 years for those who died before reaching hospital, and their average injury severity score was 29.3. In contrast, those who died in hospital were older and equally likely to be males or females. Important neurological injury occurred in 113 pre-hospital deaths, and evidence of airway obstruction in 59. Eighty six pre-hospital deaths were due to road traffic accidents, and 37 of these were occupants in cars. On the basis of the injury severity score and age, death was found to have been inevitable or highly likely in 92 cases. In the remaining 60 cases death had not been inevitable and airway obstruction was present in up to 51 patients with injuries that they might have survived. CONCLUSION--Death was potentially preventable in at least 39% of those who died from accidental injury before they reached hospital. Training in first aid should be available more widely, and particularly to motorists as many pre-hospital deaths that could be prevented are due to road accidents.

Objectives To (1) examine the characteristics and location of death among hospitalised children, (2) investigate yearwise trends in these characteristics and (3) test the hypothesis that professional ethical guidance from the UK Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (1997) would lead to significant changes in the characteristics of death among hospitalised children. Methods Routine administrative data from one large tertiaryâlevel UK children's hospital was examined over a 7âyear period (1997â2004) for children aged 0â18â years. Demographic details, location of deaths, source of admission (within hospital vs external), length of stay and final diagnoses (International Classification of Diseasesâ10 codes) were studied. Statistical significance was tested by the KruskalâWallis analysis of ranks and median test (nonâparametric variables), Ï2 test (proportions) and CochranâArmitage test (linear trends). Results Of the 1127 deaths occurring in hospital over the 7âyear period, the majority (57.7%) were among infants. The main diagnoses at death included congenital malformations (22.2%), perinatal diseases (18.1%), cardiovascular disorders (14.9%) and neoplasms (12.4%). Most deaths occurred in an intensive care unit (ICU) environment (85.7%), with a significant increase over the years (80.1% in 1997 to 90.6% in 2004). There was a clear increase in the proportion of admissions from inâhospital among the ICU cohort (14.8% in 1998 to 24.8% in 2004). Infants with congenital malformations and perinatal conditions were more likely to die in an ICU (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.65 to 3.55), and older children with malignancy outside the ICU (OR 6.5, 95% CI 4.4 to 9\n\nA pediatric death audit in a large referral hospital in Malawi.\n\nPubMed\n\nFitzgerald, Elizabeth; Mlotha-Mitole, Rachel; Ciccone, Emily J; Tilly, Alyssa E; Montijo, Jennie M; Lang, Hans-Joerg; Eckerle, Michelle\n\n2018-02-21\n\nDeath audits have been used to describe pediatric mortality in under-resourced settings, where record keeping is often a challenge. This information provides the cornerstone for the foundation of quality improvement initiatives. Malawi, located in sub-Saharan Africa, currently has an Under-5 mortality rate of 64/1000. Kamuzu Central Hospital, in the capital city Lilongwe, is a busy government referral hospital, which admits up to 3000 children per month. A study published in 2013 reported mortality rates as high as 9%. This is the first known audit of pediatric death files conducted at this hospital. A retrospective chart review on all pediatric deaths that occurred at Kamuzu Central Hospital (excluding deaths in the neonatal nursery) during a 13-month period was done using a standardized death audit form. A descriptive analysis was completed, including patient demographics, HIV and nutritional status, and cause of death. Modifiable factors were identified that may have contributed to mortality, including a lack of vital sign collection, poor documentation, and delays in the procurement or results of tests, studies, and specialist review. Seven hundred forty three total pediatric deaths were recorded and 700 deceased patient files were reviewed. The mortality rate by month ranged from a low of 2.2% to a high of 4.4%. Forty-four percent of deaths occurred within the first 24Â h of admission, and 59% occurred within the first 48Â h. The most common causes of death were malaria, malnutrition, HIV-related illnesses, and sepsis. The mortality rate for this pediatric referral center has dramatically decreased in the 6Â years since the last published mortality data, but remains high. Areas identified for continued development include improved record keeping, improved patient assessment and monitoring, and more timely and reliable provision of testing and treatment. This study demonstrates that in low-resource settings, where reliable record keeping is often difficult\n\nNear-Death and Other Transpersonal Experiences Occurring During Catastrophic Events.\n\nPubMed\n\nLawrence, Madelaine\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThe purpose of this article is to describe examples of near-death and other transpersonal experiences occurring during catastrophic events like floods, wars, bombings, and death camps. To date, researchers have limited their investigations of these transpersonal events to those occurring to seriously ill patients in hospitals, those dying from terminal illnesses, or to individuals experiencing a period of grief after the death of a loved one. Missing is awareness by first responders and emergency healthcare professionals about these transpersonal experiences and what to say to the individuals who have them. Some responders experience not only deaths of the victims they assist, but also deaths of their colleagues. Information about these transpersonal experiences can also be of comfort to them. The examples in this article include a near-death experience during the Vietnam War, an out-of-body experience after a bomb explosion during the Iraq War, a near-death visit to a woman imprisoned at Auschwitz, and two after-death communications, one from a person killed in Auschwitz and another from a soldier during World War I. Also included are interviews with two New York City policemen who were September 11, 2001 responders. It is hoped the information will provide knowledge of these experiences to those who care for those near death, or dying, or grieving because of catastrophic events, and encourage researchers to further investigate these experiences during disasters.\n\nChronic Liver Disease is One of the Leading Causes of Death in Bangladesh: Experience by Death Audit from a Tertiary Hospital.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbedin, Mohammed Forhad; Hoque, Mohammad Mahfuzul; Md Sadequl Islam, Abu Saleh; Islam Chowdhury, Md Forhadul; Chandra das, Dulal; Begum, Syeda Anwara; Mamun, Ayub Al; Mamun-Al-Mahtab; Rahman, Salimur; Saha, Anup Kumar\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn industrialized countries, the audit has become an integral part of medical care. The experience from developing countries like Bangladesh is still inadequate. This study had been carried out to find out relation among some factors like age, sex, causes, diurenal variation, duration of hospital stay with death and errors in certification process. It was a cross-sectional study conducted at the Department of Medicine, Sir Salimullah Medical College (SSMC) and Mitford Hospital from March 2010 to August 2010. Information of consecutive 100 deaths was collected in a predesigned clinical data sheet within half an hour of every occurrence. Necessary data were collected from hospital case records (admission registrar, case files and death certificates) using structured checklist. Patients who were brought dead were excluded from the study. Among 100 deaths, 48% were males (n = 48) and 52% were females (n = 52). Within this group, 66.7% were males and 33.3% were females. First day (within 24 hours of admission) death accounted for 46% (n = 46) of all death and by the second day 23% (n = 23) of all deaths occurred. The highest underlying cause of death was cerebrovascular diseases (29% of total death), infectious disease contributed 20%, chronic liver disease 13%, malignancy 7%, poisoning 6%, cor pulmonale 5%, while others were 20%. In this studychronic liver disease was found to be one of the leading causes of death in our hospital and most of them occurred due to hepatic encephalopathy. So, early detection of hepatic encephalopathy and treatment is necessary to reduce hospital mortality.

This study aimed to describe hospitalization and death due to diabetes among treatment-seeking illicit drug users. Methods: Information of 4817 treatment-seeking drug users (3365 men and 1452 women) aged 11â65âyears (mean 24.5âyears) was linked to the Finnish national hospital discharge register and the national death registry to identify those clients who were hospitalized or died from diabetes mellitus during 1997â2013. Results: Fifty-three persons (42 men and 11 women) had primary diagnoses of diabetes, with a total of 146 hospitalizations (121 among men and 25 among women). The total length of stay among men (1183âdays) far exceeded those of women (138âdays). Overall, type 1 diabetes was the main contributor to hospitalizations (67%, nâ=â98/146). The proportion of Type 1 diabetes with complications was 31% in men (nâ=â37/121) and 44% in women (nâ=â11/25). All cases of deaths due to diabetes (nâ=â7) occurred in men. Conclusion: Diabetes hospitalizations were mainly due to Type 1 diabetes. Longer length of hospital stay was observed in men, and all diabetes deaths occurred among men. Male drug users and drug users in general would require more support to reduce morbidity and mortality due to diabetes.\n\nClinical presentation and in-hospital death in acute pulmonary embolism: does cancer matter?\n\nPubMed\n\nCasazza, Franco; Becattini, Cecilia; Rulli, Eliana; Pacchetti, Ilaria; Floriani, Irene; Biancardi, Marco; Scardovi, Angela Beatrice; Enea, Iolanda; Bongarzoni, Amedeo; Pignataro, Luigi; Agnelli, Giancarlo\n\n2016-09-01\n\nCancer is one of the most common risk factors for acute pulmonary embolism (PE), but only few studies report on the short-term outcome of patients with PE and a history of cancer. The aim of the study was to assess whether a cancer diagnosis affects the clinical presentation and short-term outcome in patients hospitalized for PE who were included in the Italian Pulmonary Embolism Registry. All-cause and PE-related in-hospital deaths were also analyzed. Out of 1702 patients, 451 (26.5Â %) of patients had a diagnosis of cancer: cancer was known at presentation in 365, or diagnosed during the hospital stay for PE in 86 (19Â % of cancer patients). Patients with and without cancer were similar concerning clinical status at presentation. Patients with cancer less commonly received thrombolytic therapy, and more often had an inferior vena cava filter inserted. Major or intracranial bleeding was not different between groups. In-hospital all-cause death occurred in 8.4 and 5.9Â % of patients with and without cancer, respectively. At multivariate analysis, cancer (OR 2.24, 95Â % CI 1.27-3.98; PÂ =Â 0.006) was an independent predictor of in-hospital death. Clinical instability, PE recurrence, age â¥75Â years, recent bed rest â¥3Â days, but not cancer, were independent predictors of in-hospital death due to PE. Cancer seems a weaker predictor of all-cause in-hospital death compared to other factors; the mere presence of cancer, without other risk factors, leads to a probability of early death of 2Â %. In patients with acute PE, cancer increases the probability of in-hospital all-cause death, but does not seem to affect the clinical presentation or the risk of in-hospital PE-related death.\n\nImproving hospital death certification in Viet Nam: results of a pilot study implementing an adapted WHO hospital death report form in two national hospitals.\n\nPubMed\n\nWalton, Merrilyn; Harrison, Reema; Chevalier, Anna; Esguerra, Esmond; Van Duong, Dang; Chinh, Nguyen Duc; Giang, Huong\n\n2016-01-01\n\nViet Nam does not have a system for the national collection of death data that meets international requirements for mortality reporting. It is identified as a 'no-report' country by the WHO. Verbal autopsy reports are used in the community but exclude deaths in hospitals. This project was undertaken in Bach Mai National General Hospital and Viet Duc Surgical and Trauma Hospital in Viet Nam from 1 March 2013 to 31 March 2015. In phase 1, a modified hospital death report form, consistent with the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, was developed. Small group training in use of the report form was delivered to 427 doctors. In phase two, death data were collected, collated and analysed. In phase three, a random sample (7%) of all report forms was checked for accuracy and completeness against medical records. During the 23â months of the study, 3956 deaths were recorded. Across both hospitals, 222 distinct causes of deaths were recorded. Traumatic cerebral oedema was the immediate cause of death (15% of cases, 575/3956 patients), followed by septic shock (13%, 528/3956), brain compression (11%, 416/3956), intracerebral haemorrhage (8%, 336/3956) and pneumonia (5%, 186/3956); 67% (2639/3956) of patients were discharged home to die and 33% (1314/3956) of deaths were due to a road traffic accident, or injury at home or at work. This study confirms the viability of implementing a death report form system compliant with international standards in hospitals in Viet Nam and provides the foundation for introducing a national death report form scheme. These data are critical to comprehensive knowledge of causes of death in Viet Nam. Death data about patients discharged home to die is presented for the first time, with implications for countries where this is a cultural preference.\n\nCauses of Death after a Hospitalization with AKI.\n\nPubMed\n\nSilver, Samuel A; Harel, Ziv; McArthur, Eric; Nash, Danielle M; Acedillo, Rey; Kitchlu, Abhijat; Garg, Amit X; Chertow, Glenn M; Bell, Chaim M; Wald, Ron\n\n2018-03-01\n\nMortality after AKI is high, but the causes of death are not well described. To better understand causes of death in patients after a hospitalization with AKI and to determine patient and hospital factors associated with mortality, we conducted a population-based study of residents in Ontario, Canada, who survived a hospitalization with AKI from 2003 to 2013. Using linked administrative databases, we categorized cause of death in the year after hospital discharge as cardiovascular, cancer, infection-related, or other. We calculated standardized mortality ratios to compare the causes of death in survivors of AKI with those in the general adult population and used Cox proportional hazards modeling to estimate determinants of death. Of the 156,690 patients included, 43,422 (28%) died in the subsequent year. The most common causes of death were cardiovascular disease (28%) and cancer (28%), with respective standardized mortality ratios nearly six-fold (5.81; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 5.70 to 5.92) and eight-fold (7.87; 95% CI, 7.72 to 8.02) higher than those in the general population. The highest standardized mortality ratios were for bladder cancer (18.24; 95% CI, 17.10 to 19.41), gynecologic cancer (16.83; 95% CI, 15.63 to 18.07), and leukemia (14.99; 95% CI, 14.16 to 15.85). Along with older age and nursing home residence, cancer and chemotherapy strongly associated with 1-year mortality. In conclusion, cancer-related death was as common as cardiovascular death in these patients; moreover, cancer-related deaths occurred at substantially higher rates than in the general population. Strategies are needed to care for and counsel patients with cancer who experience AKI.

Univariate analysis showed that every year of age increase resulted in a 2% greater risk of death. If the patient had been intubated at the scene of the accident, this risk was increased 4.3-fold. Every point of increase in the Triage Revised Trauma Score (T-RTS) reduced the risk of death by 30%. A similar (but inverse) tendency was found for the HTI-ISS score, with every point of increase resulting in a 5% greater risk of death. There was a clear relationship between the base excess (BE) and hemoglobin (Hb) levels and the risk of death, the latter being increased by 8% for each mmol/l drop in BE, and reduced by 22% for each mmol/l increase in Hb. The risk of death occurring was 2.6 times higher in cases with isolated neurotrauma. These associations hardly changed in the multivariate analysis; only the relation with having been intubated at the scene disappeared. The risk of severely injured accident patients dying after arriving in hospital is mainly determined by the T-RTS, age, presence of isolated neurological damage, BE and Hb level. Skull/brain damage and hemorrhage appear to be the most important causes of death in the first 24 h after the accident. The time interval between the accident and arrival at the hospital does not appear to affect the risk of death.\n\nThe epidemiology of Scottish trauma: A comparison of pre-hospital and in-hospital deaths, 2000 to 2011.\n\nPubMed\n\nMorrison, Jonathan J; Yapp, Liam Z; Beattie, Anne; Devlin, Eimar; Samarage, Milan; McCaffer, Craig; Jansen, Jan O\n\n2016-02-01\n\nTo characterise the temporal trends and urban-rural distribution of fatal injuries in Scotland through the analysis of mortality data collected by the National Records of Scotland. The prospectively collected NRS database was queried using ICD-10 codes for all Scottish trauma deaths during the period 2000 to 2011. Patients were divided into pre-hospital and in-hospital groups depending on the location of death. Incidence was plotted against time and linear regression was used to identify temporal trends. A total of 13,100 deaths were analysed. There were 4755 (36.3%) patients in the pre-hospital group with a median age (IQR) of 42 (28-58) years. The predominant cause of pre-hospital death related to vehicular injury (27.8%), which had a decreasing trend over the study period (pÂ =Â 0.004). In-hospital, patients had a median age of 80 (58-88) years and the majority (67.0%) of deaths occurred following a fall on the level. This trend was shown to increase over the decade of study (pÂ =Â 0.020). In addition, the incidence of urban incidents remained static, but the rate of rural fatal trauma decreased (pÂ <Â 0.001). Around a third of Scottish trauma patients die prior to hospital admission and the predominant mechanism of injury is due to road traffic accidents. This contrasts with in-hospital deaths, which are mainly observed in elderly patients following a fall from standing height. Further research is required to determine the preventability of fatal traumatic injury in Scotland.

In absence of pre-hospital care, the injury mechanism and cause of death is difficult to characterise. Injury characteristics of pre-hospital deaths (PHD) versus in-hospital deaths (IHD) were compared. Using our trauma surveillance database, a retrospective, descriptive analysis of children (<18 years) presenting to Kamuzu Central Hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi from 2008 to 2013 was performed. Patient and injury characteristics of pre-hospital and in-hospital deaths were compared with univariate and bivariate analysis. Of 30,462 paediatric trauma patients presenting between 2008 and 2013, 170 and 173 were PHD and IHD, respectively. In PHD and IHD patients mean age was 7.3Â±4.9 v 5.2Â±4.3 (p<0.001), respectively. IHD patients were more likely transported via ambulance than those PHD, 51.2% v 8.3% (p<0.001). The primary mechanisms of injury for PHD were road traffic injuries (RTI) (45.8%) and drowning (22.0%), with head injury (46.7%) being the predominant cause of death. Burns were the leading mechanism of injury (61.8%) and cause of death (61.9%) in IHD, with a mean total body surface area involvement of 24.7Â±16.0%. RTI remains Malawi's major driver of paediatric mortality. A majority of these deaths attributed to head injury occur prior to hospitalisation; therefore the mortality burden is underestimated if accounting for IHD alone. Death in burn patients is likely due to under-resuscitation or sepsis. Improving pre-hospital care and head injury and burn management can improve injury related paediatric mortality.\n\n38 CFR 3.800 - Disability or death due to hospitalization, etc.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n... 38 Pensions, Bonuses, and Veterans' Relief 1 2010-07-01 2010-07-01 false Disability or death due...

Retrospective observational survivorship study. We analysed all admissions to the English National Health Service (NHS) during the financial year 2009/10, following up all patients for 30 days after admission and accounting for risk of death associated with diagnosis, co-morbidities, admission history, age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, seasonality, day of admission and hospital trust, including day of death as a time dependent covariate. The principal analysis was based on time to in-hospital death. National Health Service Hospitals in England. 30 day mortality (in or out of hospital). There were 14,217,640 admissions included in the principal analysis, with 187,337 in-hospital deaths reported within 30 days of admission. Admission on weekend days was associated with a considerable increase in risk of subsequent death compared with admission on weekdays, hazard ratio for Sunday versus Wednesday 1.16 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.18; P < .0001), and for Saturday versus Wednesday 1.11 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.13; P < .0001). Hospital stays on weekend days were associated with a lower risk of death than midweek days, hazard ratio for being in hospital on Sunday versus Wednesday 0.92 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.94; P < .0001), and for Saturday versus Wednesday 0.95 (95% CI 0.93 to 0.96; P < .0001). Similar findings were observed on a smaller US data set. Admission at the weekend is associated with increased risk of subsequent death within 30 days of admission. The likelihood of death actually occurring is less on a weekend day than on a mid-week day.\n\nEffect of cause-of-death training on agreement between hospital discharge diagnoses and cause of death reported, inpatient hospital deaths, New York City, 2008-2010.\n\nPubMed\n\nOng, Paulina; Gambatese, Melissa; Begier, Elizabeth; Zimmerman, Regina; Soto, Antonio; Madsen, Ann\n\n2015-01-15\n\nAccurate cause-of-death reporting is required for mortality data to validly inform public health programming and evaluation. Research demonstrates overreporting of heart disease on New York City death certificates. We describe changes in reported causes of death following a New York City health department training conducted in 2009 to improve accuracy of cause-of-death reporting at 8 hospitals. The objective of our study was to assess the degree to which death certificates citing heart disease as cause of death agreed with hospital discharge data and the degree to which training improved accuracy of reporting. We analyzed 74,373 death certificates for 2008 through 2010 that were linked with hospital discharge records for New York City inpatient deaths and calculated the proportion of discordant deaths, that is, death certificates reporting an underlying cause of heart disease with no corresponding discharge record diagnosis. We also summarized top principal diagnoses among discordant reports and calculated the proportion of inpatient deaths reporting sepsis, a condition underreported in New York City, to assess whether documentation practices changed in response to clarifications made during the intervention. Citywide discordance between death certificates and discharge data decreased from 14.9% in 2008 to 9.6% in 2010 (P < .001), driven by a decrease in discordance at intervention hospitals (20.2% in 2008 to 8.9% in 2010; P < .001). At intervention hospitals, reporting of sepsis increased from 3.7% of inpatient deaths in 2008 to 20.6% in 2010 (P < .001). Overreporting of heart disease as cause of death declined at intervention hospitals, driving a citywide decline, and sepsis reporting practices changed in accordance with health department training. Researchers should consider the effect of overreporting and data-quality changes when analyzing New York City heart disease mortality trends.

It can guide local health policy and help in setting priorities. Incomplete and inaccurate DC data, on the other hand, can significantly impair the precision of a national health information database. In this study we evaluated the accuracy of death certificates at a tertiary care teaching hospital in a Karachi, Pakistan. A retrospective study conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan for a period of six months. Medical records and death certificates of all patients who died under adult medical service were studied. The demographic characteristics, administrative details, co-morbidities and cause of death from death certificates were collected using an approved standardized form. Accuracy of this information was validated using their medical records. Errors in the death certificates were classified into six categories, from 0 to 5 according to increasing severity; a grade 0 was assigned if no errors were identified, and 5, if an incorrect cause of death was attributed or placed in an improper sequence. 223 deaths occurred during the study period. 9 certificates were not accessible and 12 patients had incomplete medical records. 202 certificates were finally analyzed. Most frequent errors pertaining to patients' demographics (92%) and cause/s of death (87%) were identified. 156 (77%) certificates had 3 or more errors and 124 (62%) certificates had a combination of errors that significantly changed the death certificate interpretation. Only 1% certificates were error free. A very high rate of errors was identified in death certificates completed at our academic institution.

We sought to identify characteristics associated with in-hospital death. Case series. Commercially insured patients with cancer who died between July 2010 and December 2013 and who had at least two outpatient visits at a tertiary cancer center during the last six months of life. Patient characteristics, healthcare utilization, and in-hospital death (primary outcome) were ascertained from institutional records and healthcare claims. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were used to evaluate the association of in-hospital death with patient characteristics and end-of-life outcome measures. We identified 904 decedents, with a median age of 59 years at death. In-hospital death was observed in 254 patients (28%), including 110 (12%) who died in an intensive care unit. Hematologic malignancy was associated with a 2.57 times increased risk of in-hospital death (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.91-3.45, pâ<â0.001), and nonenrollment in hospice was associated with a 14.5 times increased risk of in-hospital death (95% CI 9.81-21.4, pâ<â0.001). Time from cancer diagnosis to death was also associated with in-hospital death (pâ=â0.003), with the greatest risk among patients dying within six months of cancer diagnosis. All significant associations persisted in multivariable analyses that were adjusted for baseline characteristics. In-hospital deaths are common among commercially insured cancer patients. Patients with hematologic malignancy and patients who die without receiving hospice services have a substantially higher incidence of in-hospital death.\n\nUse of Rapid Ascertainment Process for Institutional Deaths (RAPID) to identify pregnancy-related deaths in tertiary-care obstetric hospitals in three departments in Haiti.\n\nPubMed\n\nBoyd, Andrew T; Hulland, Erin N; Grand'Pierre, Reynold; Nesi, Floris; HonorÃ©, Patrice; Jean-Louis, Reginald; Handzel, Endang\n\n2017-05-16\n\nAccurate assessment of maternal deaths is difficult in countries lacking standardized data sources for their review. As a first step to investigate suspected maternal deaths, WHO suggests surveillance of \"pregnancy-related deaths\", defined as deaths of women while pregnant or within 42Â days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of cause. Rapid Ascertainment Process for Institutional Deaths (RAPID), a surveillance tool, retrospectively identifies pregnancy-related deaths occurring in health facilities that may be missed by routine surveillance to assess gaps in reporting these deaths. We used RAPID to review pregnancy-related deaths in six tertiary obstetric care facilities in three departments in Haiti. We reviewed registers and medical dossiers of deaths among women of reproductive age occurring in 2014 and 2015 from all wards, along with any additional available dossiers of deaths not appearing in registers, to capture pregnancy status, suspected cause of death, and timing of death in relation to the pregnancy. We used capture-recapture analyses to estimate the true number of in-hospital pregnancy-related deaths in these facilities. Among 373 deaths of women of reproductive age, we found 111 pregnancy-related deaths, 25.2% more than were reported through routine surveillance, and 22.5% of which were misclassified as non-pregnancy-related. Hemorrhage (27.0%) and hypertensive disorders (18.0%) were the most common categories of suspected causes of death, and deaths after termination of pregnancy were statistically significantly more common than deaths during pregnancy or delivery. Data were missing at multiple levels: 210 deaths had an undetermined pregnancy status, 48.7% of pregnancy-related deaths lacked specific information about timing of death in relation to the pregnancy, and capture-recapture analyses in three hospitals suggested that approximately one-quarter of pregnancy-related deaths were not captured by RAPID or routine surveillance.

The Public Health Agency of Canada estimates that 4 million episodes of foodborne illness occur each year in Canada due to 30 known pathogens and unspecified agents. The main objective of this study was to estimate the number of domestically acquired foodborne illness-related hospitalizations and deaths. Using the estimates of foodborne illness for Canada along with data from the Canadian Hospitalization Morbidity Database (for years 2000-2010) and relevant international literature, the number of hospitalizations and deaths for 30 pathogens and unspecified agents were calculated. Analysis accounted for under-reporting and underdiagnosis. Estimates of the proportion foodborne and the proportion travel-related were incorporated for each pathogen. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to account for uncertainty generating mean estimates and 90% probability intervals. It is estimated that each year there are 4000 hospitalizations (range 3200-4800) and 105 (range 75-139) deaths associated with domestically acquired foodborne illness related to 30 known pathogens and 7600 (range 5900-9650) hospitalizations and 133 (range 77-192) deaths associated with unspecified agents, for a total estimate of 11,600 (range 9250-14,150) hospitalizations and 238 (range 155-323) deaths associated with domestically acquired foodborne illness in Canada. Key pathogens associated with these hospitalizations or deaths include norovirus, nontyphoidal Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., VTEC O157 and Listeria monocytogenes. This is the first time Canada has established pathogen-specific estimates of domestically acquired foodborne illness-related hospitalizations and deaths. This information illustrates the substantial burden of foodborne illness in Canada.\n\nAn Analysis of Deaths Due to Tuberculosis at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBandele, E.O.; Olude, I.O.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nAn analysis was made of deaths from tuberculosis in the Lagos University Teaching Hospital from 1976 to 1980. Of the 320 patients assessed, 240 were determined to have died from tuberculosis. Tuberculous meningitis was the main cause of death. Forty-two percent of the deaths occurred in the age group of 0 to 10 years old, and 47.5 percent of the patients died within one week of diagnosis. Potentially avoidable factors contributing to death include late reporting by patients to medical personnel, lack of bacillus of Calmette and Guerin (BCG) vaccine, irregular taking of medications by patients, and late referral of patients to specialized hospitals. There is a need for improved education of patients and medical personnel about the management of tuberculosis in Lagos.

A comparative study between hospital doctors and general practitioners.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nArmour, A.; Bharucha, H.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nWe aimed to audit nosological inaccuracies in death certification in Northern Ireland and to compare performance of hospital doctors and general practitioners. Nosology is the branch of medicine which treats of the classification of disease. 1138 deaths were registered in Northern Ireland in a 4-week period commencing 3/10/94. 195 of these were either registered by HM Coroners (HMC) or required further investigation by their staff; these cases were excluded from the study. The remaining 943 were analysed for wording and formulation inaccuracies according to the revised notes (1974), Northern Ireland Medical Certificate of Cause of Death. These are issued in book form by the Registrar of Births and Deaths. The commonest inaccuracies in death certification occur in the areas of poor terminology, sequence errors and unqualified mode. One or more inaccuracies were found in 317 (33.6%) of cases. In 13 of these (4%) cases, the inaccuracies were serious enough to warrant referral by the Registrar of Deaths to HM Coroner. The numbers of general practitioners and hospital doctors were recorded, with general practitioners being responsible for 122 (38%) and hospital doctors being responsible for 195 (62%) of inaccuracies.

Retrospective cohort study. Our study population comprised 10,285 patients with a record of first ever prostate biopsy between 2009 and 2013 on computerized acute hospital discharge or outpatient records covering Scotland. Using the general population as a comparison group, expected numbers of admissions/deaths were derived by applying age-, sex-, deprivation category-, and calendar year-specific rates of hospital admissions/deaths to the study population. Indirectly standardized hospital admission ratios (SHRs) and mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated by dividing the observed numbers of admissions/deaths by expected numbers. Compared with background rates, patients were more likely to be admitted to hospital within 30 days (SHR 2.7; 95% confidence interval 2.4, 2.9) and 120 days (SHR 4.0; 3.8, 4.1) of biopsy. Patients with prior co-morbidity had higher SHRs. The risk of death within 30 days of biopsy was not increased significantly (SMR 1.6; 0.9, 2.7), but within 120 days, the risk of death was significantly higher than expected (SMR 1.9; 1.5, 2.4). The risk of death increased with age and tended to be higher among patients with prior co-morbidity. Overall risks of hospitalization and of death up to 120 days were increased both in men diagnosed and those not diagnosed with prostate cancer. Higher rates of adverse events in older patients and patients with prior co-morbidity emphasizes the need for careful patient selection for prostate biopsy and justifies ongoing efforts to minimize the risk of complications.

This was a cross-sectional study conducted in 38 internal medicine and geriatric wards in Italy participating in the Registro Politerapie SIMI (REPOSI) study during 2008. The subjects were 1,332 inpatients aged 65 years or older. Clusters of diseases (i.e., two or more co-occurrent diseases) were identified using the odds ratios (OR) for the associations between pairs of conditions, followed by cluster analysis. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the effect of disease clusters on in-hospital death and adverse clinical events. A total of 86.7% of the patients were discharged, 8.3% were transferred to another hospital unit, and 5.0% died during hospitalization; 36.4% of the patients had at least one adverse clinical event. Patients affected by the clusters, including heart failure (HF) and either chronic renal failure (CRF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, had a significant association with in-hospital death (OR, 4.3;95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-11.5; OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.1-8.3, respectively), as well as patients affected by CRF and anemia (OR, 6.1; 95% CI, 2.3-16.2). The cluster including HF and CRF was also associated with adverse clinical events (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.5-7.8). The effect of both HF and CRF and anemia and CRF on in-hospital death was additive. Several groups of older patients at risk of in-hospital death and adverse clinical events were identified according to disease clustering. Knowledge of the relationship among co-occurring diseases may help developing strategies to improve clinical practice and preventative interventions.\n\nHospital-Based Mortality in Federal Capital Territory Hospitals-Nigeria, 2005 - 2008\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPreacely, Nykiconia; Biya, Oladayo; Gidado, Saheed; Ayanleke, Halima; Kida, Mohammed; Akhimien, Moses; Abubakar, Aisha; Kurmi, Ibrahim; Ajayi, Ikeoluwapo; Nguku, Patrick; Akpan, Henry\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Cause-specific mortality data are important to monitor trends in mortality over time. Medical records provide reliable documentation of the causes of deaths occurring in hospitals. This study describes all causes of mortality reported at hospitals in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) of Nigeria. Methods Deaths reported in 15 secondary and tertiary FCT hospitals occurring from January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2008 were identified by a retrospective review of hospital records conducted by the Nigeria Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Program (NFELTP). Data extracted from the records included sociodemographics, geographic area of residence and underlying cause-of-death information. Results A total of 4,623 deaths occurred in the hospitals. Overall, the top five causes of death reported were: HIV 951 (21%), road traffic accidents 422 (9%), malaria 264 (6%), septicemia 206 (5%), and hypertension 194 (4%). The median age at death was 30 years (range: 0-100); 888 (20%) of deaths were among those less than one year of age. Among children < 1 year, low birth weight and infections were responsible for the highest proportion 131 (15%) of reported mortality. Conclusion Many of the leading causes of mortality identified in this study are preventable. Infant mortality is a large public health problem in FCT hospitals. Although these findings are not representative of all FCT deaths, they may be used to quantify mortality in that occurs in FCT hospitals. These data combined with other mortality surveillance data can provide evidence to inform policy on public health strategies and interventions for the FCT.

Fifteen percent of the disabled workers died within 18-24 months of initial eligibility; 34 percent died within 5 years. Older disabled workers had higher probabilities of death and hospitalization. Males were two times as likely to die as females, but no more likely to be hospitalized. Black persons also had a higher risk of death but no greater risk of hospitalization than other races. Additional health insurance had no influence on survival, but was differentially associated with inpatient care. Married males were more likely to survive. Physical functioning capacity had no influence on survival or hospitalization. Respiratory, circulatory, and digestive disorders increased the probability of hospitalization and mortality.

The primary goal of this commentary was to evaluate the causes of early posttraumatic inpatient deaths over an extended period. Although early posttraumatic in-hospital death remains multifactorial, severe traumatic brain injuries are the dominant cause and have increased in proportion over time. Other traditional causes of death have also decreased owing to improved clinical care. PMID:29806810\n\nAdjusted hospital death rates: a potential screen for quality of medical care.\n\nPubMed\n\nDubois, R W; Brook, R H; Rogers, W H\n\n1987-09-01\n\nIncreased economic pressure on hospitals has accelerated the need to develop a screening tool for identifying hospitals that potentially provide poor quality care. Based upon data from 93 hospitals and 205,000 admissions, we used a multiple regression model to adjust the hospitals crude death rate. The adjustment process used age, origin of patient from the emergency department or nursing home, and a hospital case mix index based on DRGs (diagnostic related groups). Before adjustment, hospital death rates ranged from 0.3 to 5.8 per 100 admissions. After adjustment, hospital death ratios ranged from 0.36 to 1.36 per 100 (actual death rate divided by predicted death rate). Eleven hospitals (12 per cent) were identified where the actual death rate exceeded the predicted death rate by more than two standard deviations. In nine hospitals (10 per cent), the predicted death rate exceeded the actual death rate by a similar statistical margin. The 11 hospitals with higher than predicted death rates may provide inadequate quality of care or have uniquely ill patient populations. The adjusted death rate model needs to be validated and generalized before it can be used routinely to screen hospitals. However, the remaining large differences in observed versus predicted death rates lead us to believe that important differences in hospital performance may exist.\n\nReduced hospitalization cost for upper gastrointestinal events that occur among elderly veterans who are gastroprotected.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbraham, Neena S; Hartman, Christine; Hasche, Jennifer\n\n2010-04-01\n\nDespite prescription of gastroprotection among elderly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) users, residual bleeding can still occur. We sought to determine the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) on hospitalization and resource use among veterans in whom an upper gastrointestinal event (UGIE) occurred. We identified from national pharmacy records veterans > or =65 years prescribed an NSAID, cyclooxygenase-2 selective NSAID (coxib), or salicylate (>325 mg/day) at any Veterans Affairs (VA) facility (01/01/00-12/31/04). Prescription fill data were linked longitudinally to a Veterans Affairs-Medicare dataset of inpatient, outpatient, and death files, and demographic and provider data. Among veterans in whom a UGIE occurred, we assessed the effect of prescription strategy on hospitalization, using a multivariate logistic regression model. A total of 3566 UGIEs occurred among a cohort that was predominantly male (97.5%), white (77%), with a mean age of 73.5 (SD, 5.7). Hospitalization occurred in 47.5%, and gastroprotection was associated with a 30% reduction in hospitalization compared with no PPI. Five-year pharmacy costs associated with the PPI strategy exceeded the no-PPI strategy ($742,406 vs $184,282); however, a substantial reduction in medical costs was observed with PPI ($9,948,738 vs $18,686,081). Even if an NSAID-UGIE occurs in the PPI-protected older veteran, the reduction in need for hospitalization results in a cost saving to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

There are no published studies on NDEs in general hospital populations, and studies have been mainly conducted on critically ill patients. We assessed the prevalence of NDEs and its associations in a multi-religious population in a general hospital in Sri Lanka. A randomised sample of patients admitted to the Colombo North Teaching Hospital was assessed using the Greyson NDE scale and clinical assessment. Out of total 826 participants, NDEs were described by 3%. Compared to the NDE-negative participants, the NDE-positive group had a significantly higher mean for age and a ratio of men. Women reported deeper NDEs. Patients of theistic religions (Christianity, Islam and Hinduism) reported significantly more NDEs compared to patients from the non-theistic religious group (Buddhism). NDE-positive patient group had significantly higher reporting of a feeling 'that they are about to die', the presence of loss of consciousness and a higher percentage of internal medical patients. This is the first time that NDEs are assessed in a general hospital population and NDEs being reported from Sri Lanka. We also note for the first time that persons with theistic religious beliefs reported more NDEs than those with non-theistic religious beliefs. Medical professionals need to be aware of these phenomena to be able to give an empathic hearing to patients who have NDE.\n\nAutomated comparison of last hospital main diagnosis and underlying cause of death ICD10 codes, France, 2008-2009.\n\nPubMed\n\nLamarche-Vadel, Agathe; Pavillon, GÃ©rard; Aouba, Albertine; Johansson, Lars Age; Meyer, Laurence; Jougla, Eric; Rey, GrÃ©goire\n\n2014-06-05\n\nIn the age of big data in healthcare, automated comparison of medical diagnoses in large scale databases is a key issue. Our objectives were: 1) to formally define and identify cases of independence between last hospitalization main diagnosis (MD) and death registry underlying cause of death (UCD) for deceased subjects hospitalized in their last year of life; 2) to study their distribution according to socio-demographic and medico-administrative variables; 3) to discuss the interest of this method in the specific context of hospital quality of care assessment. 1) Elaboration of an algorithm comparing MD and UCD, relying on Iris, a coding system based on international standards. 2) Application to 421,460 beneficiaries of the general health insurance regime (which covers 70% of French population) hospitalized and deceased in 2008-2009. 1) Independence, was defined as MD and UCD belonging to different trains of events leading to death 2) Among the deaths analyzed automatically (91.7%), 8.5% of in-hospital deaths and 19.5% of out-of-hospital deaths were classified as independent. Independence was more frequent in elder patients, as well as when the discharge-death time interval grew (14.3% when death occurred within 30 days after discharge and 27.7% within 6 to 12 months) and for UCDs other than neoplasms. Our algorithm can identify cases where death can be considered independent from the pathology treated in hospital. Excluding these deaths from the ones allocated to the hospitalization process could contribute to improve post-hospital mortality indicators. More generally, this method has the potential of being developed and used for other diagnoses comparisons across time periods or databases.\n\nMedical practice, procedure manuals and the standardisation of hospital death.\n\nPubMed\n\nHadders, Hans\n\n2009-03-01\n\nThis paper examines how death is managed in a larger regional hospital within the Norwegian health-care. The central focus of my paper concerns variations in how healthcare personnel enact death and handle the dead patient. Over several decades, modern standardised hospital death has come under critique in the western world. Such critique has resulted in changes in the standardisation of hospital deaths within Norwegian health-care. In the wake of the hospice movement and with greater focus on palliative care, doors have gradually been opened and relatives of the deceased are now more often invited to participate. I explore how the medical practice around death along with the procedure manual of post-mortem care at Trondheim University Hospital has changed. I argue that in the late-modern context, standardisation of hospital death is a multidimensional affair, embedded in a far more comprehensive framework than the depersonalized medico-legal. In the late-modern Norwegian hospital, interdisciplinary negotiation and co-operation has allowed a number of different agendas to co-exist, without any ensuing loss of the medical power holder's authority to broker death. I follow Mol's notion of praxiographic orientation of the actor-network approach while exploring this medical practice.\n\nThe quality of medical death certification of cause of death in hospitals in rural Bangladesh: impact of introducing the International Form of Medical Certificate of Cause of Death.\n\nPubMed\n\nHazard, Riley H; Chowdhury, Hafizur Rahman; Adair, Tim; Ansar, Adnan; Quaiyum Rahman, A M; Alam, Saidul; Alam, Nurul; Rampatige, Rasika; Streatfield, Peter Kim; Riley, Ian Douglas; Lopez, Alan D\n\n2017-10-02\n\nAccurate and timely data on cause of death are critically important for guiding health programs and policies. Deaths certified by doctors are implicitly considered to be reliable and accurate, yet the quality of information provided in the international Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (MCCD) usually varies according to the personnel involved in certification, the diagnostic capacity of the hospital, and the category of hospitals. There are no published studies that have analysed how certifying doctors in Bangladesh adhere to international rules when completing the MCCD or have assessed the quality of clinical record keeping. The study took place between January 2011 and April 2014 in the Chandpur and Comilla districts of Bangladesh. We introduced the international MCCD to all study hospitals. Trained project physicians assigned an underlying cause of death, assessed the quality of the death certificate, and reported the degree of certainty of the medical records provided for a given cause. We examined the frequency of common errors in completing the MCCD, the leading causes of in-hospital deaths, and the degree of certainty in the cause of death data. The study included 4914 death certificates. 72.9% of medical records were of too poor quality to assign a cause of death, with little difference by age, hospital, and cause of death. 95.6% of death certificates did not indicate the time interval between onset and death, 31.6% required a change in sequence, 13.9% required to include a new diagnosis, 50.7% used abbreviations, 41.5% used multiple causes per line, and 33.2% used an ill-defined condition as the underlying cause of death. 99.1% of death certificates had at least one error. The leading cause of death among adults was stroke (15.8%), among children was pneumonia (31.7%), and among neonates was birth asphyxia (52.8%). Physicians in Bangladeshi hospitals had difficulties in completing the MCCD correctly. Physicians routinely made errors in death\n\nWhen a desired home death does not occur: the consequences of broken promises.\n\nPubMed\n\nTopf, Lorrianne; Robinson, Carole A; Bottorff, Joan L\n\n2013-08-01\n\nEvidence shows that most people prefer to die at home; however, the majority of expected deaths occur away from home. Although home deaths require family caregiver (FCG) commitment and care, we understand very little about their experiences in this context. The study's aim was to gain a better understanding of the experiences of FCGs when circumstances prevented a desired home death for a family member with advanced cancer. An interpretive description approach was used. Data collection involved semistructured interviews. Field notes and reflective journaling aided interpretive and analytical processes. The study was conducted in western Canada and included 18 bereaved FCGs. FCGs were committed to the promises made to care for their family member at home until death. These promises were challenged by a lack of preparedness for caregiving, difficulty accessing professional support and information, and frustration with the inadequate help they received. The events that precipitated dying family members leaving their home for hospital or hospice were unexpected and often influenced by FCGs' lack of situation-specific knowledge and ability to cope with complex caregiving responsibilities. FCGs found it extremely challenging to reconcile with breaking their promise to care at home until death and many were unable to do so. FCGs' despair about not being able to keep their promise for a home death was related to complicated bereavement. Prospective studies of the experiences of FCGs who are aiming for home deaths are needed to identify both short- and long-term interventions to effectively support death at home.\n\nDeterminants of hospital death in haematological cancers: findings from a qualitative study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMcCaughan, Dorothy; Roman, Eve; Smith, Alexandra G; Garry, Anne; Johnson, Miriam; Patmore, Russell; Howard, Martin\n\n2018-01-01\n\nObjectives Current UK health policy promotes enabling people to die in a place they choose, which for most is home. Despite this, patients with haematological malignancies (leukaemias, lymphomas and myeloma) are more likely to die in hospital than those with other cancers, and this is often considered a reflection of poor quality end-of-life care. This study aimed to explore the experiences of clinicians and relatives to determine why hospital deaths predominate in these diseases. Methods The study was set within the Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRNâwww.hmrn.org), an ongoing population-based cohort that provides infrastructure for evidence-based research. Qualitative interviews were conducted with clinical staff in haematology, palliative care and general practice (n=45) and relatives of deceased HMRN patients (n=10). Data were analysed for thematic content and coding and classification was inductive. Interpretation involved seeking meaning, salience and connections within the data. Results Five themes were identified relating to: the characteristics and trajectory of haematological cancers, a mismatch between the expectations and reality of home death, preference for hospital death, barriers to home/hospice death and suggested changes to practice to support non-hospital death, when preferred. Conclusions Hospital deaths were largely determined by the characteristics of haematological malignancies, which included uncertain trajectories, indistinct transitions and difficulties predicting prognosis and identifying if or when to withdraw treatment. Advance planning (where possible) and better communication between primary and secondary care may facilitate non-hospital death. PMID:28663341\n\nForensic medicine experts' opinion on medico-legal autopsies in hospital deaths: a questionnaire survey.\n\nPubMed\n\nD'Souza, Deepak Herald; Pant, Sadip; Menezes, Ritesh George\n\n2013-10-01\n\nMedico-legal autopsy is conducted routinely in some countries and selectively in others in hospital deaths. This study was conducted to evaluate the views of the forensic medicine experts regarding this matter. A questionnaire pro forma was sent to sixty-five forensic medicine experts practicing in different medical institutions all around India. Designations and experiences of the participants were noted by requests in the same questionnaire. Their specific experience in conducting medico-legal autopsy in hospital deaths was also requested for. Responses were charted in frequency distribution tables and analyzed using SPSS, version 17.0. One-third of the participants felt that a medico-legal autopsy was necessary in all the hospital death cases as defined in the present study. Ten percent of the participants opined that a medico-legal autopsy was unnecessary in hospital deaths. The majority of the experts mentioned finding the cause of death, followed by finding the manner of death and collecting the evidentiary materials, as the reasons for medico-legal autopsy in hospital deaths. Twenty percent of the participants felt that internal findings at autopsy poorly matched with the case records. All the experts agreed that external autopsy findings matched with the hospital case records. Nearly two-third of the participants felt that it was difficult in some cases to interpret the autopsy findings without case records from the hospital where the deceased was treated. Our findings suggest that the exercise of carrying out medico-legal autopsy routinely in every hospital death as evident in the Indian framework is often unnecessary as per the experts' opinion. Autopsy findings in hospital deaths often correlate with hospital case records.\n\nUsing National Inpatient Death Rates as a Benchmark to Identify Hospitals with Inaccurate Cause of Death Reporting - Missouri, 2009-2012.\n\nPubMed\n\nLloyd, Jennifer; Jahanpour, Ehsan; Angell, Brian; Ward, Craig; Hunter, Andy; Baysinger, Cherri; Turabelidze, George\n\n2017-01-13\n\nReporting causes of death accurately is essential to public health and hospital-based programs; however, some U.S. studies have identified substantial inaccuracies in cause of death reporting. Using CDC's national inpatient hospital death rates as a benchmark, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) analyzed inpatient death rates reported by hospitals with high inpatient death rates in St. Louis and Kansas City metro areas. Among the selected hospitals with high inpatient death rates, 45.8% of death certificates indicated an underlying cause of death that was inconsistent with CDC's Guidelines for Death Certificate completion. Selected hospitals with high inpatient death rates were more likely to overreport heart disease and renal disease, and underreport cancer as an underlying cause of death. Based on these findings, the Missouri DHSS initiated a new web-based training module for death certificate completion based on the CDC guidelines in an effort to improve accuracy in cause of death reporting.\n\nIncidence and predictors of in-hospital non-cardiac death in patients with acute heart failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nWakabayashi, Kohei; Sato, Naoki; Kajimoto, Katsuya; Minami, Yuichiro; Mizuno, Masayuki; Keida, Takehiko; Asai, Kuniya; Munakata, Ryo; Murai, Koji; Sakata, Yasushi; Suzuki, Hiroshi; Takano, Teruo\n\n2017-08-01\n\nPatients with acute heart failure (AHF) commonly have multiple co-morbidities, and some of these patients die in the hospital from causes other than aggravated heart failure. However, limited information is available on the mode of death in patients with AHF. Therefore, the present study was performed to determine the incidence and predictors of in-hospital non-cardiac death in patients with AHF, using the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Syndromes (ATTEND) registry Methods: The ATTEND registry included 4842 consecutive patients with AHF admitted between April 2007-September 2011. The primary endpoint of the present study was in-hospital non-cardiac death. A stepwise regression model was used to identify the predictors of in-hospital non-cardiac death. The incidence of all-cause in-hospital mortality was 6.4% ( n=312), and the incidence was 1.9% ( n=93) and 4.5% ( n=219) for non-cardiac and cardiac causes, respectively. Old age was associated with in-hospital non-cardiac death, with a 42% increase in the risk per decade (odds 1.42, p=0.004). Additionally, co-morbidities including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (odds 1.98, p=0.034) and anaemia (odds 1.17 (per 1.0 g/dl decrease), p=0.006) were strongly associated with in-hospital non-cardiac death. Moreover, other predictors included low serum sodium levels (odds 1.05 (per 1.0 mEq/l decrease), p=0.045), high C-reactive protein levels (odds 1.07, p<0.001) and no statin use (odds 0.40, p=0.024). The incidence of in-hospital non-cardiac death was markedly high in patients with AHF, accounting for 30% of all in-hospital deaths in the ATTEND registry. Thus, the prevention and management of non-cardiac complications are vital to prevent acute-phase mortality in patients with AHF, especially those with predictors of in-hospital non-cardiac death.\n\nComplications Requiring Hospital Admission and Causes of In-Hospital Death over Time in Alcoholic and Nonalcoholic Cirrhosis Patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Hee Yeon; Kim, Chang Wook; Choi, Jong Young; Lee, Chang Don; Lee, Sae Hwan; Kim, Moon Young; Jang, Byoung Kuk; Wo, Hyun Young\n\n2016-01-01\n\nData on the epidemiology of alcoholic cirrhosis, especially in Asian countries, are limited. We compared the temporal evolution of patterns of alcoholic and nonalcoholic cirrhosis over the last decade. We retrospectively examined the inpatient datasets of five referral centers during 2002 and 2011. The study included patients who were admitted due to specific complications of liver cirrhosis. We compared the causes of hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths between patients with alcoholic and nonalcoholic cirrhosis. Among the included 2,799 hospitalizations (2,165 patients), 1,496 (1,143 patients) were from 2002, and 1,303 (1,022 patients) were from 2011. Over time, there was a reduction in the rate of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) as a cause of hospitalization and an increase in the rate of hepatocellular carcinoma. Deaths that were attributable to HE or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) significantly decreased, whereas those due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) significantly increased over time in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. However, in patients with nonalcoholic cirrhosis, hepatic failure and HRS remained the principal causes of in-hospital death during both time periods. The major causes of in-hospital deaths have evolved from acute cirrhotic complications, including HE or SBP to HRS in alcoholic cirrhosis, whereas those have remained unchanged in nonalcoholic cirrhosis during the last decade.\n\nDeterminants of hospital death in haematological cancers: findings from a qualitative study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcCaughan, Dorothy; Roman, Eve; Smith, Alexandra G; Garry, Anne; Johnson, Miriam; Patmore, Russell; Howard, Martin; Howell, Debra A\n\n2018-03-01\n\nCurrent UK health policy promotes enabling people to die in a place they choose, which for most is home.

We estimated vaccine effectiveness for prevention of serious influenza complications among older persons by using methods to account for underlying differences in risk for these complications. We conducted a retrospective cohort study among Ontario residents aged â¥ 65 years from September 1993 through September 2008. We linked weekly vaccination, hospitalization, and death records for 1.4 million community-dwelling persons aged â¥ 65 years. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated by comparing ratios of outcome rates during weeks of high versus low influenza activity (defined by viral surveillance data) among vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects by using log-linear regression models that accounted for temperature and time trends with natural spline functions. Effectiveness was estimated for three influenza-associated outcomes: all-cause deaths, deaths occurring within 30 days of pneumonia/influenza hospitalizations, and pneumonia/influenza hospitalizations. During weeks when 5% of respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza A, vaccine effectiveness among persons aged â¥ 65 years was 22% (95% confidence interval [CI], -6%-42%) for all influenza-associated deaths, 25% (95% CI, 13%-37%) for deaths occurring within 30 days after an influenza-associated pneumonia/influenza hospitalization, and 19% (95% CI, 4%-31%) for influenza-associated pneumonia/influenza hospitalizations. Because small proportions of deaths, deaths after pneumonia/influenza hospitalizations, and pneumonia/influenza hospitalizations were associated with influenza virus circulation, we estimated that vaccination prevented 1.6%, 4.8%, and 4.1% of these outcomes, respectively. By using confounding-reducing techniques with 15 years of provincial-level data including vaccination and health outcomes, we estimated that\n\nAssociation between preoperative characteristics and risk of anaesthesia-related death in dogs in small-animal referral hospitals in Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nItami, Takaharu; Aida, Hiroko; Asakawa, Makoto; Fujii, Yoko; Iizuka, Tomoya; Imai, Ayako; Iseri, Toshie; Ishizuka, Tomohito; Kakishima, Kei; Kamata, Masatoshi; Miyabe-Nishiwaki, Takako; Nagahama, Shotaro; Naganobu, Kiyokazu; Nishimura, Ryohei; Okano, Shozo; Sano, Tadashi; Yamashita, Kazuto; Yamaya, Yoshiki; Yanagawa, Masashi\n\n2017-05-01\n\nTo explore the major risk factors linking preoperative characteristics and anaesthesia-related death in dogs in referral hospitals in Japan. Observational cohort study. From April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2011, 4323 dogs anaesthetized in 18 referral hospitals in Japan. Questionnaire forms were collated anonymously. Death occurring within 48 hours after extubation was considered as an anaesthesia-related death. Patient outcome (alive or dead) was set as the outcome variable. Preoperative general physical characteristics, complete blood cell counts, serum biochemical examinations and intraoperative complications were set as explanatory variables. The risk factors for anaesthesia-related death were evaluated using chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, followed by multivariable logistic regression analysis of the data. Significance was set at pÂ <Â 0.05. Thirteen dogs that died from surgical error or euthanasia were excluded from statistical analysis. The total mortality rate in this study was 0.65% [28/4310 dogs; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.41-0.89]. Furthermore, 75% (95% CI, 55.1-89.3) of anaesthesia-related deaths occurred in dogs with pre-existing diseases. Most of the deaths occurred postoperatively (23/28; 82.1%; 95% CI, 63.1-93.9). Preoperative serum glucose concentration <77Â mgÂ dL -1 (6/46; 13.0%; 95% CI, 4.9-26.3), disturbance of consciousness (6/50; 12.0%; 95% CI, 4.5-24.3), white cell count >15,200Â Î¼L -1 (16/499; 3.4%; 95% CI, 1.9-5.5) and American Society of Anesthesiologists grade III-V (19/1092; 1.7%; 95% CI, 1.1-2.7) were identified as risk factors for anaesthesia-related death. Intraoperative hypoxaemia (8/34; 23.5%; 95% CI, 10.7-41.2) and tachycardia (4/148; 2.7%; 95% CI, 0.7-6.8) were also risk factors for anaesthesia-related death. The results revealed that certain preoperative characteristics were associated with increased odds of anaesthesia-related death, specifically low serum glucose concentration and disturbances of consciousness.

Overreporting of heart disease has been documented in New York City (NYC) and nationwide. Our objective was to evaluate the immediate and longer-term effects of a cause-of-death (COD) educational program that NYC's health department conducted at 8 hospitals on heart disease reporting and on average conditions per certificate, which are indicators of the quality of COD reporting. From June 2009 through January 2010, we intervened at 8 hospitals that overreported heart disease deaths in 2008. We shared hospital-specific data on COD reporting, held conference calls with key hospital staff, and conducted in-service training. For deaths reported from January 2009 through June 2011, we compared the proportion of heart disease deaths and average number of conditions per death certificate before and after the intervention at both intervention and nonintervention hospitals. At intervention hospitals, the proportion of death certificates that reported heart disease as the cause of death decreased from 68.8% preintervention to 32.4% postintervention (P < .001). Individual hospital proportions ranged from 58.9% to 79.5% preintervention and 25.9% to 45.0% postintervention. At intervention hospitals the average number of conditions per death certificate increased from 2.4 conditions preintervention to 3.4 conditions postintervention (P < .001) and remained at 3.4 conditions a year later. At nonintervention hospitals, these measures remained relatively consistent across the intervention and postintervention period. This NYC health department's hospital-level intervention led to durable changes in COD reporting.\n\nUse of primary diagnosis during hospitalization in the Unified Health System (Sistema Ãnico de SaÃºde) to qualify information regarding the underlying cause of natural deaths among the elderly.\n\nPubMed\n\nCascÃ£o, Angela Maria; Jorge, Maria Helena Prado de Mello; Costa, Antonio JosÃ© Leal; Kale, Pauline Lorena\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIll-defined causes of death are common among the elderly owing to the high frequency of comorbidities and, consequently, to the difficulty in defining the underlying cause of death. To analyze the validity and reliability of the \"primary diagnosis\" in hospitalization to recover the information on the underlying cause of death in natural deaths among the elderly whose deaths were originally assigned to \"ill-defined cause\" in their Death Certificate. The hospitalizations occurred in the state of Rio de Janeiro, in 2006. The databases obtained in the Information Systems on Mortality and Hospitalization were probabilistically linked. The following data were calculated for hospitalizations of the elderly that evolved into deaths with a natural cause: concordance percentages, Kappa coefficient, sensitivity, specificity, and the positive predictive value of the primary diagnosis. Deaths related to \"ill-defined causes\" were assigned to a new cause, which was defined based on the primary diagnosis. The reliability of the primary diagnosis was good, according to the total percentage of consistency (50.2%), and fair, according to the Kappa coefficient (k = 0.4; p < 0.0001). Diseases related to the circulatory system and neoplasia occurred with the highest frequency among the deaths and the hospitalizations and presented a higher consistency of positive predictive values per chapter and grouping of the International Classification of Diseases. The recovery of the information on the primary cause occurred in 22.6% of the deaths with ill-defined causes (n = 14). The methodology developed and applied for the recovery of the information on the natural cause of death among the elderly in this study had the advantage of effectiveness and the reduction of costs compared to an investigation of the death that is recommended in situations of non-linked and low positive predictive values. Monitoring the mortality profile by the cause of death is necessary to periodically update the\n\n[Death by starvation in French psychiatric hospitals during the occupation].\n\nPubMed\n\nCaire, Michel\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe author reports the tragic event which happened in the psychiatric hospitals where several thousands patients died by starvation during the occupation. He treats with a judicial inquiry in the wake of the death of fifteen patients in the psychiatric hospital of Toulouse.\n\nEstimated reductions in hospitalizations and deaths from childhood diarrhea following implementation of rotavirus vaccination in Africa.\n\nPubMed\n\nShah, Minesh P; Tate, Jacqueline E; Mwenda, Jason M; Steele, A Duncan; Parashar, Umesh D\n\n2017-10-01\n\nRotavirus is the leading cause of hospitalizations and deaths from diarrhea. 33 African countries had introduced rotavirus vaccines by 2016. We estimate reductions in rotavirus hospitalizations and deaths for countries using rotavirus vaccination in national immunization programs and the potential of vaccine introduction across the continent. Areas covered: Regional rotavirus burden data were reviewed to calculate hospitalization rates, and applied to under-5 population to estimate baseline hospitalizations. Rotavirus mortality was based on 2013 WHO estimates. Regional pre-licensure vaccine efficacy and post-introduction vaccine effectiveness studies were used to estimate summary effectiveness, and vaccine coverage was applied to calculate prevented hospitalizations and deaths. Uncertainties around input parameters were propagated using boot-strapping simulations. In 29 African countries that introduced rotavirus vaccination prior to end 2014, 134,714 (IQR 112,321-154,654) hospitalizations and 20,986 (IQR 18,924-22,822) deaths were prevented in 2016. If all African countries had introduced rotavirus vaccines at benchmark immunization coverage, 273,619 (47%) (IQR 227,260-318,102) hospitalizations and 47,741 (39%) (IQR 42,822-52,462) deaths would have been prevented. Expert commentary: Rotavirus vaccination has substantially reduced hospitalizations and deaths in Africa; further reductions are anticipated as additional countries implement vaccination. These estimates bolster wider introduction and continued support of rotavirus vaccination programs.\n\nA multi-country study of the âintrapartum stillbirth and early neonatal death indicatorâ in hospitals in low-resource settings\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGoldenberg, Robert L.; McClure, Elizabeth M.; Kodkany, Bhala; Wembodinga, Gilbert; Pasha, Omrana; Esamai, Fabian; Tshefu, Antoinette; Patel, Archana; Mabaye, Hillary; Goudar, Shivaparasad; Saleem, Sarah; Waikar, Manjushri; Langer, Ana; Bose, Carl L.; Rubens, Craig E.; Wright, Linda L.; Moore, Janet; Blanc, Ann\n\n2013-01-01\n\nObjective To determine the feasibility of introducing a simple indicator of quality of obstetric and neonatal care and to determine the proportion of potentially avoidable perinatal deaths in hospitals in low-income countries. Methods Between September 1, 2011, and February 29, 2012, data were collected from women who had a term pregnancy and were admitted to the labor ward of 1 of 6 hospitals in 4 low-income countries. Fetal heart tones on admission were monitored, and demographic and birth data were recorded. Results Data were obtained for 3555 women and 3593 neonates (including twins). The doptone was used on 97% of women admitted. The overall perinatal mortality rate was 34 deaths per 1000 deliveries. Of the perinatal deaths, 40%â45% occurred in the hospital and were potentially preventable by better hospital care. Conclusion The results demonstrated that it is possible to accurately determine fetal viability on admission via a doptone. Implementation of doptone use, coupled with a concise data record, might form the basis of a low-cost and sustainable program to monitor and evaluate efforts to improve quality of care and ultimately might to help to reduce the in-hospital component of perinatal mortality in low-income countries.
