While her\n\ndeftly-engineered love songs may feel heavy and heartbroken at first listen,\n\nit is clear during a live performance that the stories whittled out of the\n\nmusic more closely resemble aging photographs one would leaf through in a\n\nsecond-hand shop than scars that still weigh heavily on Cole. Whether she’s\n\nbehind a grand piano at an ornate theater, or sitting with a keyboard on her\n\nlap at a cozy house show, Kaylee Cole is a true entertainer who leaves no\n\naudience member without an impression.\n\nSPREADING THE WORD for 12 YEARS!\n\nTongue & Groove\n\nSunday July 31\n\n6-7:30 pm\n\nThe Hotel Cafe\n\n1623 1/2 N.
