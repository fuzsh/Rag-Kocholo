He was famous for them!\n\nA tribute from a grandchild:\n\nLetter to the Editor about Grandpa Ace, Wyalusing Rocket August 2001\n\nTo most of you, he was a beautiful, talented, friendly man. To me, hes just grandpa. A grandpa who loved his family. A grandpa who taught me how to put a worm on a hook, catch a fish and then take the fish off the hook. A grandpa who was always interested in what we were doing and achieving. A grandpa who never had a bad word about anyone or anything, even things he didnt always agree with. A grandpa who always loved and cared for us, no matter what. He was more than any kid could ever ask for in a grandfather. Whats even better, he was the Great-Grandpa to my children (or Pa as we\n\ncalled him). A Great-Grandpa who brought the same joy and teachings to my children as he did to me. Not only did he help hunt for salamanders, but a grandpa who made the best animal shaped pancakes in the world, (his talents went way beyond pen, paper and wood). By not being a part of your local community, I didnt have the privilege of knowing my grandfather in the way that many of you did, nor was I aware of the many ways in which he has touched this community. As I said, to me, hes always just been my grandpa. And he was just as good of a grandfather as he was a good member of your community. He will be missed in many ways. His memories will always be cherished. I thank each and every one of you who loved my grandfather. All of these things we read and hear, mean so much to us.\n\nCorinne Sherman Mt. Holly Springs, PA.\n\nDaily Review on October 29, 2011\n\nRhea Ace, age 85, Tewksbury Hollow Road, Laceyville, Pa., passed away suddenly at home early Friday morning, Oct. 28, 2011.

He was the son of George W.

When her son provided the proper information that there was a space left in the lot to bury his mother, Angie Barrett next to her beloved husband second husband James Barrett as she had planned, she was moved on the following Monday August 2nd. There was confusion as to how many deceased persons were actually buried in the lot. Six were already buried there but two children were buried in the same lot. The lot, lot number 98 is alleged to be comprised of the following deceased people: a Goodwin child, which died in 1921, Angie and James Barrett, Fred and Mabel Goodwin, and the two Johnson children, Jerry and Sylvia which are buried in the same grave lot\n\nAngie inherited her mothers cemetery lot, which we assume was purchased about the same time the infant passed in 1921. Her mother was Mabel Rought. Mabel , she was married twice, first to Harry Thomas Herman and second to Fred Lee Goodwin. On a marriage license to James Barrett, Angies father is listed as Harvey Thomas Herman. We know his name was Harry Thomas Herman so why the discrepancy, we do not know.

We have only to question why Joseph Beaumont born about 1825 was buried here? One explanation for his burial here might be is that he was related to the Fowlers. Effie Fowler, his daughter in law, is the daughter of Leonard and Hattie Brewster Fowler. She married on March 16, 1898 to Joe Beaumont Jr. Leonard is buried here at Beaver Meadows and his wife Hattie in the Rushville Cemetery. Joe Beaumont Jr. was born March 11, 1859 and passed May 04, 1942. He is buried in Stevensville with his first and second wife. His third wife was Nora Taylor who later married Lewis Barber who is buried here at Beaver Meadows. There are plenty of broken flagstone pieces near where Leonard Fowler is buried at Beaver Meadows to account for Joe and Amanda. There are no records to prove either way where they are buried. He is probably buried in this section of the cemetery which was active then, but not many headstones. Money was very tight then.\n\nLot 95, A. R .

His stepdaughter Vivian Herlichy told me he was buried next to his mother where he always wanted to be. She was the daughter of his last wife. The Bell Family Bible which is in the possession of Sandy Yurgatis Voda records he was married first to Blanch Mullinex October 20, 1933, second to Bertha V. Fargo March 20, 1948. She died October 24, 1950. He married a third time to a lady named Rose September 27, 1953. She died September 4, 1968 and is buried in the Vestal Hills Memorial Park. He was married to Irene Bennett Briggs at the time of his death. She was 97 years young then. They were married June 6, 1970. She passed away March 7, 2002 at the age of 101 years and was buried in the Nanticoke Valley Cemetery, Union Center, New York.

She was born September 28, 1903. Aunt Norie, as local folks graciously referred to her as was first married on May 28, 1921 to George Anthony Marcy, and second to Lester Cooper in September 1962. She was the natural mother of Helen Fassett Wimberly, the adopted daughter of Olin and Helen Mae Hawley Fassett. While married to Mr. Marcy, Leonora bore the following children: Richard Glenn Marcy born August 1, 1922, Helen Louise Marcy born May 14, 1924, Beatrice Kathryn Marcy (who legally became Helen Fassett after her adoption) born September 19, 1925, Harry Sylvester Marcy born September 16, 1926 and Ruth Virgil Bell born December 9, 1928. I include the dates as a formality; these children were all adopted out. They may some day have relatives looking for their ancestor.\n\nNote: Helen Beatrice Fassett, the child of Leonora Bell was actually the child of Floyd Hawley. This is no secret as told to me by Caroline Fassett Ellsworth. Leonora wrote to me in 1997 that she intended to be cremated when the time came, and that she wanted to be buried in the Bell lot. She passed away in Florida March 24, 2001. Her ashes were spread in the Halifax River in Daytona Beach not far from the senior assisted living apartment complex she lived at located at 600 S. Beach St Daytona Beach, FL. May 5, 2001.\n\nThere is another interesting story recorded in the Bell Bible concerning Leonora. Leonora also told me this story. At the age of nine years, her grandparents Jerome and Joan Smith kidnapped her and headed north to New York State. Paul and May Keifer returned her to her father Jud Bell via the depot at Geneva, New York on August 7, 1912. Joan or JoAnn was a Pawnee Indian, she was the natural mother of Judson Bell. Joan married Jerome Smith for her third husband. Joan had previously been married to a Mr. Webster.\n\nThe X in this photo marks the Bell family graves.\n\nThe photo is courtesy of Helen Fassett Wimberly\n\n1920 United States Federal Census\n\nName: Martha E Rosencrans\n\nHome in 1920: Auburn, Susquehanna, Pennsylvania Age: 34 years\n\nEstimated birth year: abt 1886\n\nBirthplace: Pennsylvania Relation to Head of House: Wife\n\nSpouse's name: Darl (Daniel)\n\nFather's Birth Place: Pennsylvania\n\nMother's Birth Place: Pennsylvania\n\nMarital Status: Married Race: White\n\nSex: Female\n\nAble to read: Yes\n\nAble to Write: Yes Image: 76\n\nHousehold Members: Name Age\n\nDarl Rosencrans 51\n\nMartha E Rosencrans 34\n\nCecil M Bell 12\n\nThe next burials are those of the Bennett Families.\n\n* Historians note: There will be references in this book made to the Bennett Genealogy regarding many of the Bennett and Culver families.

Dorothy did much to preserve our local history.\n\nDaily Review March 23, 2000\n\nDOROTHY ANNE BENNETT, 68, of Wyalusing, passed away on Tuesday, March 21, 2000, at the Memorial Hospital in Towanda. Dorothy was born Aug. 2, 1931 in Sayre, daughter of the late Wayne C. and Ruth Sharer Bennett, who were at the time residents of Capital Heights, Md. As her mother died a few days after her birth, she grew up in the home of her grandparents, L. E. and Angeline Sharer on Clapper Hill, Stevens Township. Dorothy attended Stevensville Elementary School and the Camptown High School. In 1947, she moved with her father to Gaylord Street in Wyalusing and graduated from the Wyalusing Valley High School, a member of the class of 1949. She graduated from the Pennsylvania State University in 1955 with a BA in liberal arts. She remained an avid Penn State football fan. After working part-time as a feature writer for the Wyalusing Rocket, and serving as secretary for Wyalusing Borough, in 1962, she joined the staff of the Bradford County Assistance Office as a caseworker. She later became a supervisor and was the Agencys income maintenance manager when she retired in 1991. In 1970, Dorothy moved to Hornbrook, Sheshequin Township, where she lived until 1986, when she purchased a home on Front Street, in Wyalusing. She vividly remembered the June day in 1972 when her home, along with thousands of others, fell victim to the Hurricane Agnes flood. Since her retirement, Dorothy has continued her involvement with local civic organizations. She was the founder of the Wyalusing Valley Museum Association and served for a number of years on its board of directors, holding the office of president, vice-president and secretary. She was a member and past president of the Wyalusing Lioness Club. Dorothy was an active member of the Wyalusing United Methodist Church, where she served as the churchs outreach chairman and historian and in several other offices. She was very active with the Girl Scouts and a volunteer for the Red Cross and a former member of the Towanda Branch AAUW. The funeral service will be held on Friday, March 24, 2000, at 11 a.m. at the P. Dean Homer Funeral Home, 1 Groverdale Lane, Wyalusing, with the Rev. Beverly Davenport, her pastor, officiating. Interment will be in the Beaver Meadows Cemetery. Friends may call at the P. Dean Homer Funeral Home, 1 Groverdale Lane, Wyalusing, on Thursday, March 23, 2000, from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Memorials are directed to the Wyalusing Museum Association, Wyalusing, Pa.; Wyalusing United Methodist Church, or the charity of ones choice.\n\nDorothy Anne Bennett (Photo from the Bennett Genealogy)\n\nI would like to add a little precious memory of Dorothy by Toot Cobb\n\nCarol,\n\nI didn't know Dorothy all that well, but I recall on incident that happened at the Wyalusing High School, the old two story building. When she came to the school, she of course had to use crutches. All of upper grade classes were located on the second floor. The principal at that time called about 8 of seniors in to his office and showed us how to make a chair linking our hands together so we could carry her from the building when we had a fire alarm.\n\nOn the first time that the alarm sounded after that another fellow and myself happened on to her standing at the top of the stairs. We formed the chair and step up behind her to lift her up to take her out of the building, unfortunately the principal hadn't informed her of what was to take place. The scream that issued forth was enough to raise the dead up from their grave at the Wyalusing Cemetery.\n\nAfter we got her calmed down and explained what was going on thing went along just fine. It was that year that I graduated from school and went off to the military. For all intents and purposes, I have been absent from the Wyalusing area since that time. My wife, Ruth, and I were married on March 7, 1953. I left the area shortly afterwards to work near Phila, then to school at Penn State. Going to teach in southern PA and then on to Wellsboro. I think the scream was the start of my hearing lose, but I chuckle when I think of what happened and what she must have thought when our hands came up behind her knees.\n\nLot 6, D. D.

There is a headstone in the Beaver Meadows Cemetery, however it is probably monument only. Ferris and his wife Nancy Black Bennett are alleged to be buried in Fowler Hill Cemetery, Rush Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. There is no proof either way but there are stones near Lucy Bennetts marker there in Fowler Hill that record Mother and Father.The Bennett Genealogy records Rev. John Soapworth married Ferris Bennett and Nancy Black September 1, 1823 in Wyalusing, Pennsylvania. The Tuscarora Township Historical Society records they were married by the Justice of the Peace John LaPorte. I do not know which is correct. Dorothy Bennett recalls the story being told by two of his grandchildren that Ferris Bennett was married twice. Since he was about 22 years old when he married Nancy Black, he could have been married previously. Crafts History of Bradford County reveals that a Ferris Bennett married Betsey Haywood Stone. The Bradford Argus dated March 13, 1873 records Ferris Bennett of Stevensville married on March 5, 1873. did not say WHO? Betsey allegedly died in 1885 and is buried alongside her husband Calvin Stone who had passed March 27, 1869. They are buried in the East Herrick Cemetery, however she is not on a cemetery listing there. Betsey Haywood was born January 05, 1801 in Westminster, Massachusetts. She is not on 1880 census as Betsey Stone in Herrick Township Bradford County, PA.

Because Flo was a schoolteacher, they had to keep their marriage a secret. In that day and age married women were not allowed to teach!\n\nThere is a large family headstone etched BENNETT on the lot. Glenn decided just before Florence died that they would etch their names, dates and marriage date on the base, no need to buy a headstone when one already exists was his remarks to me.\n\nChildren: Robert Glenn, Suzanne Mary (Mrs. Alfred Sagrati), Dr. John Very, and James George. All are deceased except Suzanne Sagrati. Dr. John Bennett passed away July 18, 2013 in Atlanta, Georgia. He was cremated.\n\n* Historians note: Mr. Glenn, as I joyfully refer to him was responsible for keeping many of the church and cemetery records. He was the first man to try to straighten out the burials in the cemetery. His handwriting is most prevalent in the original plot book. It appears that Mae Fassett and Mr. Glenn collaborated in her search for history also. He retired from church and cemetery work in the late 1970s. Ive enjoyed a few nice visits with this talented historian. He will be quoted many times in my church historical records. He has shared with me what ever he could remember at his advanced age from 1994  2000.\n\n* Historians note: I found a site on the Internet by his grandson Thomas Bennett that refers to the Bennett Homestead on Clapper Hill as the Castle.http://www.mindspring.com/~tbennett/index.html\n\nMany treasured memories are shared and kept by his children and many grandchildren at the Castle.\n\nThe Bennett home known as the Castle in July 2006.

He was born May 6, 1905 in Tuscarora Township in the house on Clapper Hill Road across the road from his present residence on Bennett Acres, a designated century farm. He was a son of Very Bennett and Mary Woodruff Bennett. Glenn attended local schools and graduated from Laceyville High School, Class of 1923 and from Mansfield Normal School, Class of 1924. He began his career as a teacher at the age of 19 in the one-room schoolhouse on Clapper Hill in 1924, and had 17 students at the time. He later taught history and English in Skinners Eddy, was an English teacher for many years and the principal at Laceyville High School for two years until consolidation. He taught English to the upper grades at Wyalusing Valley High School for over 15 years. His combined total was 44 years of teaching.\n\nGlenn met his wife-to-be, Florence Beckman of Coudersport, Pa., during summer school at Penn State, and on May 6, 1932 Glenn and Florence were married. Since the Depression had begun, they kept the fact a secret in order for Florence to keep her job. By 1938, there were three small children in the house and Glenn needed to complete his degree so he took classes at Mansfield State Teachers College while Florence taught in his place at Laceyville High School. The couple also managed a lunch-counter gas station at Powers Corner near Mansfield. Florence was a Spanish, Latin, French, science, social studies and chemistry teacher for many years, retiring from Wyalusing Valley High School in 1969. Mr. and Mrs. B., as the couple were affectionately called by students, were exceptional teachers and a devoted couple. They enjoyed a long retirement together, traveling to visit family and remodeling their home. Glenn and Florence were married 63 years before Florence passed away on Dec. 18, 1995. An avid reader and farmer, Mr. Bs interests and memberships over the years include: Beaver Meadows United Methodist Church, the Mayflower Society, John Howland Society and the sons of the Civil War and a member of the Masonic Lodge. Surviving are: his sons, Robert Glenn Bennett of Camarillo, Calif., Dr. John Very Bennett of Atlanta, Ga., and James George Bennett of Columbus, Ohio; his daughter, Suzanne Marie Bennett-Sagrati of Cincinnati, Ill.; and 21 grandchildren and 32 great-grandchildren.
