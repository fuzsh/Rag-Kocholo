        "text": "George Denis Patrick Carlin was born in Manhattan, New York.[5][6] He was the younger son of now defunct New York Sun advertising manager Patrick Carlin (1888â€“1945) and secretary Mary Bearey (born c. 1905). He came from a Catholic family of Irish descent, though Carlin himself rejected religion. (Patrick was an immigrant from Donegal, Ireland.) His parents separated when he was two months old. Mary subsequently raised George and his older brother Patrick Jr. (born October 1, 1931) herself.[1] His maternal grandfather, Dennis Bearey, was an Irish immigrant who worked as a New York City policeman. One immigrant grandmother's maiden name was originally O'Grady, he recalled, but it changed to Grady before she reached America. \"They'd dropped the O in the ocean on the way here,\" he said. He would later name his character on The George Carlin Show O'Grady as an homage.[7] Carlin said he picked up an appreciation for the effective use of the English language from his mother,[8] with whom he had a difficult relationship; he often ran away from home.[9]\n\nHe grew up on West 121st Street, in a neighborhood of Manhattan he said he and his friends called \"White Harlem\", because that \"sounded a lot tougher than its real name\" of Morningside Heights. He attended Corpus Christi School, a Roman Catholic parish school of the Corpus Christi Church, in Morningside Heights (now closed as of 2002?) After three semesters, Carlin involuntarily left Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx at age 15. He briefly attended Bishop Dubois High School in Harlem and the Salesian High School in Goshen, NY. He spent many summers at Camp Notre Dame on Spofford Lake in Spofford, New Hampshire. He regularly won the camp's drama award, and specified that after his death a portion of his ashes be spread at the lake.[\n\njoined the United States Air Force when he was old enough (age 18+) and was trained as a radar technician. He was stationed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier City, Louisiana. He also began working as a disc jockey at radio station KJOE, in nearby Shreveport. Labeled an \"unproductive airman\" by his superiors, Carlin was discharged early on July 29, 1957. During his time in the Air Force he had been court martialed three times, and also received many nonjudicial punishments. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carlin\n\nU.S., Social Security Death Index, 1935-2014\n\nName: George Denis Carlin\n\nLast Residence:\n\nBORN: 12 May 1937\n\nDied: 22 Jun 2008\n\nState (Year) SSN issued: New York (1951\n\nObituary:\n\nComedian Great! George Carlin, the dean of counterculture comedians whose biting insights on life and language were immortalized in his \"Seven Words You Can Never Say On TV\" routine, died of heart failure. He was 71.Carlin, who had a history of heart trouble, performed as recently as last weekend at the Orleans Casino and Hotel in Las Vegas. It was announced Tuesday that Carlin was being awarded the 11th annual Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. Carlin constantly pushed the envelop with his jokes, particularly with the \"Seven Words\" a routine called \"The Seven Words You Can Never Say On TV .\"When Carlin uttered all seven at a show in Milwaukee in 1972, he was arrested for disturbing the peace. And when they were played on a New York City radio station, they resulted in a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1978 upholding the government's authority to sanction stations for broadcasting offensive language .\"So my name is a footnote in American legal history, which I'm perversely kind of proud of,\" he said earlier this year. He produced 23 comedy albums, 14 HBO specials, three books, a couple of TV shows and appeared in several movies. Carlin hosted the first broadcast of \"Saturday Night Live\" and noted on his website that he was \"loaded on cocaine all week long. \"When asked about the fallout from the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show that ended with Janet Jackson's breast-baring \"wardrobe malfunction,\" Carlin said: \"What are we, surprised?\" \"There's an idea that the human body is somehow evil and bad and there are parts of it that are especially evil and bad and we should be ashamed. Fear, guilt and shame are built into the attitude toward sex and the body,\" he said. \"It's reflected in these prohibitions and these taboos that we have.\"\n\nCarlin was born May 12, 1937 and grew up in the Morningside Heights section of Manhattan, raised by a single mother."
