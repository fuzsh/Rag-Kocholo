        "text": "You may have seen in the news recently that scientists analyzed the DNA in Beethoven’s hair. The stories seemed to be bit short on details. But I just found one that provided more insight, and you can read it here. If you want to read the full original scientific paper, you can find it here.\n\nHere are some interesting take-aways I got from reading these articles.\n\nThe claim that Beethoven’s deafness was caused by lead poisoning, possibly from the cup he drank from, is now in question. This claim was based on an earlier study of a lock of hair known as the Hiller lock. It turns out that the Hiller lock is not Beethoven’s hair. How do we know? In the current study, eight hair samples were examined that were claimed to be from Beethoven. Five were from the same person, and study of the provenance (the chain of ownership from origin to now) of these samples indicates that they are likely to be authentic Beethoven samples. The Hiller lock, the basis for the lead poisoning claim, was not among these five. In fact, scientists found out that the Hiller lock came from a female. So, two of the eight hair samples were from people who were not Beethoven, and one was so poorly preserved that results were inconclusive. The current study is based on the five matching samples.\n\nBeethoven’s genealogy on paper does not match his DNA genealogy. The DNA of relatives of Beethoven who are currently alive, whose relationship to him was established using legal records, was compared with Beethoven’s DNA. It turns out they are not genetic relatives of Beethoven. The discrepancy appears in Beethoven’s paternal line, although it is not clear when it happened. This was described as an “extra-pair paternity event.” What this means is that a male ancestor of Beethoven’s may have been the result of an extramarital affair. Scientists could not determine the identity of the unexpected ancestor.\n\nThe exact cause of the Beethoven’s persistent gastrointestinal problems is still unknown, but some disorders have been ruled out. Beethoven frequently commented about the misery he was in due to gastrointestinal problems. Scientists were able to determine that celiac disease, lactose intolerance, and irritable bowel syndrome were not probable causes.\n\nScientists found genetic risk factors for liver disease and an incident of hepatitis B. Historically, it has been thought that Beethoven suffered from liver disease and died of cirrhosis. Risk factors for liver disease were found in his DNA, as well as evidence (in the hair itself) of hepatitis B infection. The authors of the study also cite Beethoven’s alcohol consumption as a contributing factor to his liver dysfunction.\n\nIt is possible that advances in DNA analysis will yield more information in the future. And you can’t help but wonder if similar studies could be done on locks of hair from other historical persons (once they’re authenticated, of course). One late-night TV host suggested cloning Beethoven in Jurassic Park fashion!\n\nEven if it were possible, the cloned Beethoven would never create the masterpieces of the original Beethoven. Cloned Beethoven would live in the 2000s, not the 1800s, absorbing the influences and knowledge of the time that has passed since his predecessor (including the changing opinions about his predecessor’s works). The works of each would be influenced by their life experiences, good and bad.\n\nWe sometimes think of Beethoven as a brooding figure, scowling at us from portraits. What if he were light-hearted? Can you picture Beethoven laughing? With that in mind, here is a Beethoven confection, Andante Favori in F WoO 57 played here by Balázs Szokolay.\n\nWant more? See my post on Beethoven’s Cavatina, or Haiku Wednesday: Beethoven.\n\nTonus peregrinus is an ancient plainchant mode. It differs from other modes in that the first half of the verse begins on one note of the scale, and the second half begins on a different note (this was a deviation from the norm at the time). Here’s what the chant looks and sounds like in its basic form.\n\nThe name means “wandering tone,” or as I saw it described in one source “pilgrim’s tone.” Of course, both names work. The phrases “wander” to an extent that is unusual for plainchant. Christian pilgrims wandered their way across Europe to the Holy Land. It has also been suggested that this rule-bending chant mode may have come from Eastern Christian religious practice, or perhaps an even more ancient form of chant. So, it appears to have done a bit of wandering itself.\n\nHere is an example of the use of the tonus peregrinus, which is typically used in the singing of Psalm 114. In this example it is sung in English with organ accompaniment.\n\nI haven’t written much here on the blog lately because I have been doing a bit of peregrination myself of late, physical and virtual, as a number of changes have occurred around me.\n\nI have helped no fewer than three sets of folks move their belongings from one household to another, some over long distances. Anyone who has ever moved knows it is not just the physical moving of stuff that is exhausting—it is all the paperwork, and details, and the sheer mental adjustment to new surroundings (where did I put the light bulbs? where is the nearest bank?). Thankfully, my only challenge was lifting things and finding my way from point A to B. GPS made my peregrinations much easier than those of the pilgrims of old.\n\nEarlier in the year, a place where I spent a great deal of time as a child passed from family hands, so the places where I once walked were no longer mine to tread, my steps redirected from once familiar paths. Rooms deprived of their furniture echo differently. The tone is shifted, slightly, but perceptibly.\n\nThe elderly relative who had lived there is living a contented life, but can no longer clearly identify other family members. They are familiar, perhaps, on a good day, but, as they say, the mind wanders.\n\nEven more changes: recently, our choir director retired. While we are sad to see him step down from the podium, we are happy that he will enjoy a well-deserved retirement. When the new director signals the downbeat, some of the music will be the same, but we know it may sound a little different. After all, Glenn Gould’s Chromatic Fantasy (Bach) is different from András Schiff’s Chromatic Fantasy, and Wanda Landowska’s Chromatic Fantasy (and of course, Gould’s Goldberg Variations are different from … Gould’s Goldberg Variations).\n\nAlso, recently I performed a piece of music that I had written. It was first set to paper five years ago. It has undergone some changes since then, though the basic tune remained the same.\n\nTonus peregrinus. Things change, they shift in unexpected ways. And we continue to meet new challenges and new opportunities. It may not be clear how things will turn out, or where we’ll end up. But we keep wandering anyway.\n\nIn my search for examples of tonus peregrinus, I stumbled upon a work by Perotin on an album by the group Tonus Peregrinus. The work, Beata viscera, is not an example of tonus peregrinus; it is a monophonic conductus, a work for one voice, typically used in processions. This was probably sung at Notre Dame in Paris–it too will return, but be not quite the same. The twisting and turning of the melody, beautiful and haunting, made it a perfectly imperfect accompaniment to this post. Here is Beata viscera by Perotin, performed by soprano Rebecca Hickey.\n\n_____\n\nImage attribution: Procession of the Youngest King, also known as Journey of the Magi, by Benozzo Gozzoli [Public domain] via Wikimedia Commons, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gozzoli_magi.jpg.\n\nWhere would you go now\n\nTo escape your cares and woes?\n\nIf you could go now?\n\nWould it be some isle,\n\nWarm, sunny, a sandy beach,\n\nAn azure ocean?\n\nA forest clearing\n\nOverarched with leafy trees\n\nAnd dappled sunlight?\n\nA remote cabin,\n\nSoft rainfall gently tapping\n\nThe windows and roof?\n\nA cityscape with\n\nHumming traffic and lively\n\nNightlife, full of fun?\n\nA snowy mountain,\n\nGlistening in the moonlight,\n\nSilent and peaceful.\n\nYou can see it now,\n\nCan’t you? It’s in your mind’s eye.\n\nOr maybe you’re there.\n\nI hope you find peace\n\nWherever you may be now\n\nOn your joyous isle.\n\nIn 1904, Claude Debussy vacationed on the island of Jersey with his mistress (and later, second wife) Emma Bardac. It was there that he put the finishing touches on the composition L’isle joyeuse. Debussy deliberately used the English isle instead of the French ile to allude to Jersey.\n\nThis piece was influenced by the paintings of Jean-Antoine Watteau, in particular, L’Embarquement pour Cythera, pictured above.\n\nHere is a fine performance of L’isle joyeuse by Marc-André Hamelin.\n\nI hope you find your joyous isle, even for just a little while.\n\n____\n\nReferences\n\nFor more information on Debussy’s sojourn in Jersey, see http://www.litart.co.uk/index.htm , in particular, the page on L’isle joyeuse.\n\nAlso see https://notesfromapianist.wordpress.com/2012/10/03/j-is-for-joyeuse-debussys-lisle-joyeuse/\n\nImage attribution\n\nL’Embarquement pour Cythera by Jean-Antoine Watteau [public domain], via Wikimedia Commons, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:L%27Embarquement_pour_Cythere,_by_Antoine_Watteau,_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg\n\nMutter Rattelein\n\nSchau mal! Was hast du getan?\n\nFür deine Kinder,\n\nIn der alten Burg,\n\nMachtest Du ein Bettelein\n\nVon alten Seiten.\n\nBisschen bei Bisschen,\n\nDu hast die Musik zerriss’n\n\nIn kleine Stücke.\n\nDu hast ein weiches\n\nNest für die Kinder gewebt\n\nSo wären sie warm.\n\nKinder, Ihr nicht wisst\n\nSie war Komponist eines\n\nRatzenwiegenlied.\n\nWee Mother Rat, look\n\nNow what you have done here, look!\n\nFor your small children,\n\nIn the old castle,\n\nYou made a soft little bed\n\nFrom some old pages.\n\nBite by tiny bite,\n\nYou rendered all the music\n\nInto small pieces.\n\nYou wove the music\n\nInto a softly lined nest\n\nSo they would be warm.\n\nYour babes didn’t know\n\nYou were the composer of\n\nA rat lullaby.\n\nI would like to tell you today the story of Gottfried Heinrich Stölzel. He lived about the same time as Bach, and was much admired by his contemporaries. He was highly regarded by most people…but perhaps not so much by his successor as Kapellmeister in the court at Gotha, Georg Benda.\n\nBenda wrote that he had saved the best stuff, and separated it from the “junk.” That “junk” was stored in a castle attic, where it was mostly destroyed by rats.\n\nWhile I suppose it’s possible that rats could have eaten the manuscripts, I recall a time that mice got into my outdoor garden shed. I found that they had nibbled the owner’s manual for my mower into long, neat strips, and made them into a nest. And this is what I pictured that they had done with poor Stölzel’s music.\n\nThere is good news and bad news about our composer and his repurposed compositions. An obituary listed his prolific output, which included 1,358 cantatas, a passion, oratorios, masses, instrumental works, and five operas.\n\nOf perhaps thousands of works composed in Gotha, only about a dozen survive. His operas are gone.\n\nLuckily, however, some of Stölzel’s music was published, and works he had written for the court at Sondershausen were preserved. However, even there, Stölzel’s music was disrespected: his manuscripts were found in a box behind the organ in 1870.\n\nA few of Stölzel’s compositions were reworked by Johann Sebastian Bach, including the aria Bist du bei mir, which for many years was attributed to Bach himself. This aria, found in the Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach, was an aria from Stölzel’s opera Diomedes. He also performed some of Stölzel’s cantatas in Leipzig. One of Stölzel’s works, a minuet can be found in Bach’s Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach.\n\nRecently, I heard a piece of Stölzel’s music performed live (where I first heard the story of his music), and what struck me was how lively and engaging it was. It’s hard to feel “meh” about this music—it grabs you by the hand and makes you run with it. Let me give you some examples to choose from:\n\nHere is the Concerto grosso a quattro cori in D.\n\nAnd a Concerto for Trumpet in D major.\n\nHow about a trio sonata for organ!\n\nHere’s another sonata\n\nEven this religious work, a Te Deum, is lively.\n\nHere is a discussion thread of enthusiastic commentary about Stölzel on the Bach Cantatas website. And here’s a video to introduce folks to Stölzel’s Brockes Passion.\n\nBut this article would not be complete without the one work Stölzel is known best for. Here is a beautiful rendition of Bist du bei mir. I hope you will enjoy it.\n\nWith thanks to the Rebel Ensemble for their wonderful performance and the Stölzel story.\n\nReferences\n\nGottfried Heinrich Stölzel, Wikipedia.org, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Heinrich_St%C3%B6lzel.\n\nFritz Hennenberg.

There are no words to describe the experience, but I’ll try.\n\nThe sound of the piece is stunning, the visual perception of the performance, no less so. The hands cross over one another, the fingers move so fast, they can be a blur to the human eye. And as hundreds, perhaps thousands, of notes roll by, you realize the pianist has memorized all of them. And that is only one part of it. The first hurdle is technical—being able to physically play the piece. The second is expressive—and that’s where the piece comes to life, and the pianist adds his own interpretation.\n\nRavel based this 1908 piece on a collection of poems, Gaspard de la Nuit, by Aloysius Bertrand. If you read French, you can find the book of poems here (free on Project Gutenberg). If you want to see the three poems that Ravel used (in French and English), you can see them here.\n\nThe first movement is about a water nymph that tries to tempt the listener to join her in her underwater realm. The second movement is a depiction of a hanged man on a scaffold in the desert. The third movement depicts the antics of a goblin, Scarbo, as he capers through the night.\n\nHere is Ravel’s Gaspard de la nuit, performed by Lucas Debargue.\n\nIf you want to read the sheet music to see what the pianist has read (and memorized) to perform this piece, you can follow along here to a performance by Benjamin Grosvenor.\n\nThere is a masterclass on YouTube for Gaspard de la Nuit, taught by Vlado Perlemuter, who studied with Ravel and recorded all of Ravel’s solo piano music.\n\nIn the third movement of Gaspard, Ravel had the intention of creating a piece of music more difficult that Balakirev’s Islamey, written in 1869. Balakirev drew his themes from folk music of the Caucasus and Crimea.\n\nHere is Balakirev’s Islamey, performed by Giuseppe Mentuccia.\n\nHere is a masterclass on Islamey taught by Lang Lang. It’s worth noting that the person performing the piece in the masterclass is 17 years old.\n\nIn watching these masterclasses, one thing that stands out is that the comments laser-focus in on specific measures, specific phrases. As I said earlier, when you learn music at this level, you don’t just learn the notes; that’s just the first step. Then, you consider the execution of phrases, their speed, the speed of separate sections of a given phrase, how connected, smooth, a phrase should be, how the volume evolves over a phrase. And that’s just one phrase.\n\nMost of us may never be able to play Islamey, or its equivalent for the instrument we play. And some of us do not play instruments. But thinking about the music in this detail, listening for these nuances, will make the music richer, fuller, and more enjoyable.\n\nWe may not make it to Everest, but even the view from the foothills is worth the trek.\n\n_____\n\nImage attribution: Elisa Tomellini plays a grand piano at a concert given on top of a mountain in the Alps, setting a world record for the world’s highest piano concert (4460 meters), via http://dmajor.tv/2017/07/11/elisa-tomellini-the-highest-piano-concert-the-world/.

But the inspiration for the post is Charles-Valentin Alkan’s Funeral March on the Death of a Parrot.\n\nOddly, this is not the first time I’ve done a post on music written about a bird, or even for a dead bird. Mozart had a starling whose song may be heard in his music, and for whom he wrote a poem. Telemann wrote the Cantata of Funeral Music for an Artistically Trained Canary-Bird Whose Demise Brought the Greatest Sorrow to His Master.\n\nSo, there’s precedent (and decedent for that matter). But the subject of this post is Alkan’s funeral march. It has been said that he was inspired to write this after the appearance of Rossini’s opera The Thieving Magpie [La gazza ladra] in Paris.1 In his score, Alkan advises lovers of La gazza ladra not to attribute any “impertinence” to the dead parrot’s song, you know, not that he was parodying Rossini or anything.\n\nIn this funeral march, the soloists sing “As-tu déjeune, Jaco”, which is roughly equivalent to the English “Polly want a cracker?”\n\nAlas, it is too late. Here is Alkan’s Funeral March on the Death of a Parrot.\n\nHere is Monty Python’s Dead Parrot sketch.\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://www.allmusic.com/composition/marcia-funebre-sulla-morte-dun-papagallo-for-chorus-3-oboes-bassoons-funeral-march-for-a-dead-parrot-mc0002396751\n\nToday’s a good day\n\nTo get to know Charles Gounod,\n\nThe French composer.\n\nAve Maria\n\nIs the only thing most know\n\n(and the Hitchcock theme).\n\nBut he wrote over\n\n600 pieces; one, a\n\nNational anthem.\n\nAnd so, I urge you\n\nTo get to know Charles Gounod,\n\nThe French composer.\n\nIf you ask people what they know about Charles Gounod, you’re likely to hear about his adaptation of Bach’s Prelude in C Major, the Bach-Gounod Ave Maria.\n\nSome might mention his opera Faust (here’s a short excerpt).\n\nSome might remember that he wrote The Funeral March of a Marionette, known to some readers of a certain age as the theme to the television show Alfred Hitchcock Presents.\n\nThen it gets very quiet.\n\nAnd yet Gounod wrote over 600 pieces, including two symphonies and the delightful Petite Symphonie for woodwinds.\n\nGounod wrote several masses, his best-known being the Messa Solennelle de Saint-Cecile. Gounod’s Marche Pontificale became the national anthem of Vatican City.\n\nA rather unusual piece (and instrument) that you need to see is Gounod’s Concerto for piano-pédalier and orchestra. It is a grand piano equipped with pedals like an organ. Here is the first movement.*\n\nWant more?

In his lifetime, his firm installed or reconstructed around 500 organs in churches in Europe, Great Britain, and Latin America.\n\nCavaillé-Coll was responsible for a number of technical innovations and for the introduction of organ voices that imitate various instruments in the orchestra. This led to these organs being called “symphonic organs.” Franck said, “My new organ? It’s an orchestra!” and Widor praised the responsiveness of the organ and variety of new orchestral voices.1\n\nThe organ builder worked closely with composers, and modified his designs based on their input. One might suggest that organ compositions might also have been influenced by the opportunities provided by Cavaillé-Coll’s instruments.\n\nThe best known of the Cavaillé-Coll organs is at the Church of Saint-Sulpice in Paris, France. The church has two organs, the main, and the choir organ. It is said that sometimes Widor and Fauré (Saint-Sulpice’s choir director at the time) would improvise at the same time at the two organs and try to confound each other with abrupt key changes.2\n\nCharles-Marie Widor’s most widely-known organ work is his Toccata, which is the final movement of his Organ Symphony No. 5 (he wrote ten). Here is a live recording of Widor’s Toccata played on the Cavaillé-Coll organ at Saint-Sulpice by Ethan LaPlaca. While the video was never meant to be a final-cut video (people talking in the background, light distortions, a camera tilt oops), I picked it for the sheer exuberance of playing and the brilliance of the sound. The page turner to the organist’s right is Daniel Roth, the current organist of Saint-Sulpice, the same post Widor and Marcel Dupré held before him.\n\nHere is a recording of Charles Widor playing his Toccata on the Saint-Sulpice organ when he was 88 years old. Fierce debates rage about the tempo—is the tempo Widor used in the recording the one that he intended for the piece, or was it influenced by his advanced age? Do some organists play it too fast? Here is a very fast performance. You be the judge.\n\nThere is a documentary, The Genius of Cavaillé-Coll, which comes as a box set that includes video from 15 different organs, music CDs, and a book of technical specifications.\n\nA number of Cavaillé-Coll organs have been digitally sampled so that one can reproduce the sound using a virtual pipe organ (an electronic organ using recorded samples of an actual pipe organ via computer software, typically Hauptwerk or the free open-source program GrandOrgue). While it will not be the same as sitting at the console in Saint-Sulpice, it’s a little closer to home. Here is a Cavaillé-Coll virtual pipe organ performance of Henri Mulet’s Carillon Sortie performed by David Lines.\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristide_Cavaill%C3%A9-Coll\n\nDuchen, Jessica.
