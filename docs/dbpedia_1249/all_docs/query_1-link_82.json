Twice Rustam won the Presidential Award for Talented Youth; in 2015 he was awarded with the PianoForum Magazine Award and Russian Music Union Prize \"for a brilliant performance at the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory\".\n\nAutumn Concert 2019\n\nOur concert on 24th November played to an almost full house at St Philip’s. The audience was warmly appreciative, and Fr Younis and the members of his church were as hospitable as usual. All were glad to welcome H.E. the High Commissioner for Sri Lanka, who attended in support of the collection on behalf of orphans of the bomb attack at St Sebastian’s Church in Sri Lanka. We hope she was also enticed by the varied programme, which included two works by past or present members of the orchestra, plus works Beethoven and Rossini! It was good to hear afterwards that she had thoroughly enjoyed the evening.\n\nWho could fail to have their sprits raised by Rossini’s overture to The Barber of Seville? It is bursting with tunes and includes two of his signature crescendos. This piece is a virtuoso challenge for any orchestra and was performed with verve and panache. Peggy Wu on the podium applied gentle pressure on the brakes when the energy needed curbing, and exciting bursts of acceleration as the piece galloped to its exuberant ending.\n\nThe two new works provided interesting contrasts; one (by Daniel Nazir-Hill) offered changing moods; solemn, playful and lyrical in turn, with especially colourful writing for the wind section. The Sri Lankan Rhapsody by Andrene Da Silva was more homogeneous in tone, moving with warmth and grace to a stirring climax, and offering a powerful blending of voices and orchestra.\n\nThe concert finished with Beethoven’s matchless 7th symphony. The orchestra played with great rhythmic energy when needed, but in the slower second movement, the string section, in particular, played with remarkable sensitivity and beauty.\n\nIn the interval we were treated to unusually excellent finger food. At the end, a presentation was made to Alison Manos, who was principal flute for many years and was also the orchestra’s irreplaceable secretary/administrator. The work she used to do for the orchestra is now being divided between at least three members of the committee, so the word “irreplaceable” is not being used lightly.\n\nFinally, hundreds of pounds (the final figure is not yet certain) were raised to help provide care for two orphans of the bombing. That rounds off a pretty satisfactory evening.\n\nThe next concert will be at 7.30 on 15th March 2020 at St John’s Church, Sylvan Road, Upper Norwood. The programme will consist of Mozart’s overture to Don Giovanni, Chopin’s Piano Concerto Number 1, and Beethoven’s Third (“Eroica”)Symphony.\n\nSpring Concert 2020\n\nThere was serious doubt about the viability of our March concert, due to the fast-changing situation with regard to coronavirus. However, after careful consideration of the Government guidelines, it was decided to go ahead, with the clear understanding that any performer who felt they needed to avoid such gatherings was absolutely supported in their decision not to play. We were glad we did go ahead, since clearly a good number of our loyal audience had earmarked the date, and attendance was gratifying. Our thanks to our hosts at St John the Evangelist, Upper Norwood.\n\nThe programme for the evening was appropriately stirring. We opened with the overture to Don Giovanni. Mozart pulls out all the stops for this dramatic showpiece, with its sinister chromatics, sudden key changes, and driving energy. It is a real test for any orchestra, and St Bart’s rose to the challenge of Peggy Wu’s racing baton.\n\nOur soloist for Chopin’s piano concerto No 1 showed the sort of mastery that allows the audience to relax and enter the music wholeheartedly, knowing that they are in safe hands (literally). The orchestra is, for much of the time, the self-effacing accompanist, but all sections (and especially the woodwind) come out of the shadows at times for some lovely interplay with the soloist. It was a pleasure to see the way soloist and orchestra were in eye contact so much of the time.\n\nThe slow movement of the Chopin was, in a sense, the peaceful heart of a programme which was otherwise full of drama. Beethoven’s third symphony almost epitomises energy and struggle, though with moments of serenity and humour. This piece is an unusually physically demanding work for the musicians, both orchestra and conductor, and their commitment seemed to be reflected in the very positive audience response.\n\nMention must be made of the delightful encore offered by soloist and conductor, who sat together at the piano to play part of Faure’s Dolly Suite. This will be best known to older members of the audience as the theme tune of Listen with Mother from the BBC Home Service days. What a treat !"
