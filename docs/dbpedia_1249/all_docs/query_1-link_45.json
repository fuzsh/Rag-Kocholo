We LOVE listening to music and have a few playlists that we listen to daily that I thought I'd share.\n\nFirst up is our \"Sounds Like Summer\" playlist - this is something that we'll have on while we swim and hang out outside - it's upbeat, fun and for sure a mix ;)\n\nDave and I LOOOOVE country (specifically nineties/2000s country - hahaha) and have been slowly converting our kids :)\n\nHere's some of our very favorite Christian music - this is what we listen to on the way to school every day.\n\nWhen we're just hanging out and playing or doing and need something a little lower key we listen to this...\n\nWhen we're in the mood for classical or jazz these are our go-to's...\n\nHAPPY Wednesday and happy listening, friends!!!"
