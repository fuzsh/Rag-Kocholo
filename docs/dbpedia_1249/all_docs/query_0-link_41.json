        "meta_description": "On the Shoulders of the Great Bear by Andrew Cronshaw, released 01 January 2000\n\n1. Ema Haual / Hällilaul (the mother at the grave / Lullaby)\n2. Hullu Sakari (Crazy Zachary)\n3. Halullinen Sielu (The lustful soul)\n4. The vale of Keppoch is desolate\n5. Itku Polska (Weeping polska) (1)\n6.

Song of the Beavers\n\n&quot;Cronshaw&#39;s musical wanderlust drew him to Finland for 1993&#39;s “The Language of Snakes”, a connection that this long-awaited follow-up develops further. The most obvious link is between his zither and the Finnish kantele, but Cronshaw takes the connection further by introducing the marovantele, a hybrid of kantele and marovany, the Malagasy instrument familiar to him from his work with Madagascar&#39;s excellent Tarika. When that instrument is used to suspend twinkling trails of notes behind Ian Blake&#39;s meditative soprano sax figures, as on “Ema Haual/Hällilaul”, the effect is utterly enchanting. \r\nThe tunes are mostly taken from traditional Finnish and Ural airs, along with a few others of Celtic derivation, but in each case Cronshaw blurs the borders to produce something unique, whether it is the layers of shawm, sax and concertina adding warm, Celtic textures to “Halullinen Sielu/Käin Minä Kaunista”, or the Finnish singer Jenny Wilhelms offering a vocal interpretation of a Gaelic lament. \r\nMost striking of all is the title track, a reference to Finland&#39;s place in relation to Russia, in which jew&#39;s-harp sets up a hypnotic resonance behind the bizarre growled rap that Heikki Laitinen constructs from mythological runic imagery. Even at this early stage, it&#39;s safe to say you&#39;ll hear nothing else like it all year.\r\n\r\nPerhaps as a result of our being such a mix’n’match culture to begin with, British musicians excel in the subtle art of hybridisation. The average American muso, faced with the task of reconciling apparently disparate cultural modes, is more likely to use them as separate, ethnically “correct” sections in some grandiose multipartite composition that has as little to do with the notion of combination as American society has with the notion of a “melting pot” culture. We Brits, on the other hand, are fortunate enough to live in a culture that, rather than viewing other cultures with suspicion, exults in their very difference and seeks to introduce their music into our native strains.\r\n\tThere are few more specific indicators of a country&#39;s culture than its folk music, yet as far back as the mid-Sixties, the likes of the Incredible String Band were introducing such exotic elements as sitar and gimbri into their Celtic-mystic whimsy, with unparalleled commercial success. The zither virtuoso Andrew Cronshaw is, in some ways, the ISB&#39;s direct descendant. He has sought in his records to find some rapprochement between folk and New Age music, while his performances have struck out from folk&#39;s traditional bar-room home - in the early Nineties, for instance, he did a tour of English village churches.&quot;\r\n\r\n- Andy Gill, THE INDEPENDENT\r\n\r\n(The liner notes for individual tracks are on the Bandcamp page for each track.)",
