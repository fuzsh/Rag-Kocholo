        "text": "Preface\n\nMany composers who write in the 20th century seem to be very concerned with burying the past in order to create something that is new. Their effort is not only directed at creating new music and new sounds, but it also seems to be directed to developing new notation when their music is still composed for traditional instruments that have been used for the last 400 years. Even the well-known composer, Igor Stravinsky, once said that “the compositional techniques still generally\n\ntaught are about as useful as spare parts for machinery last manufactured about 75 years ago.” I emphasize that 20th century composers are trying to achieve new sounds, but that does not always indicate that what they write requires “contemporary” notation. After all, both the audience and many musicians are concerned with listening to the music. Some composers have also required the performing musicians deliver to the audience motions and actions that they think will amplify the direction that the music will convey. Thus, some composers have confused gimmicks with sound in order to convey their intentions. They seem not to understand that any visual inspiration\n\nthat accompanies the work they composed is not always shared by the aural effect that reaches the audience, let alone the musicians that are performing the work.\n\nHayg Boyadjian creates remarkable music. It is clearly 20th century music, but does not rely on extemporaneous effects to generate a reaction from the audience. His compositions employ new harmonies to be sure, and they are pleasing to hear, thus, the pages of his compositions do not create disorder upon those who hear his significant music. Creativity and individualism are the ranking elements of his music.\n\n– Robin McNeil, retired Professor of Music and Musicology at University of Colorado.\n\nIt was with great trepidation that I contemplated writing a set of variations for piano on a theme by Bach. The part that came easy was the choice of the theme, which in my set of variations comes only at the end of the composition. I planned to follow in the footsteps of Bach as to the structure of the variations and also in keeping the harmonic language to a great degree in the realm of traditional harmonies with modern harmonies used very sparingly so that the composition makes an almost direction towards the music of Bach. It is — in my musical output — a piece that stands completely outside of my normal harmonic language. There is a very close resemblance to the music of Bach but infused with elements of modern musical language. Even these infusions are kept at a minimum so as to keep the general tendency of the work connected to the music of Bach.\n\nI had not originally determined the number of variations that I would be composing, but I thought of Beethoven’s 32 Variations for Piano, thus to give humble homage to two of music’s giants. Thus the 32 Variations on a Theme by Bach was born with a duration of approximately 45 minutes. For the present CD recording I decided for practical reasons to reduce the length of the piece to about half its original duration, thus in this recording there are now 20 variations. Of course it took me a long time of thinking as to which variations to keep and which to remove and still keep the composition sounding as if this is the original version.\n\nLike the 32 variations version, this present 20 variations version follow the same compositional patterns that Bach uses in his variations. Each new variation grows out of the previous one. Each has a specific harmonic language such as: in counterpoint, in fugues, basso ostinatos, canons, chaconne, etc. If one listens carefully, one can hear the music of Bach and the Bach’s theme of the variations.\n\nI would like to quote a passage from a review of my variations by the renowned pianist, music professor, musicologist, and critic Robin McNeil (retired from teaching): “Keep in mind that this is a 21stt century piece… relying on the use of a Baroque period counterpoint. Boyadjian makes use of retrograde, inversion, variations of rhythmic figures and ornamentation, and canon. As the piece progresses, it begins to sound more and more familiar in spite of the avant-garde harmonies and enharmonic writing… It truly is an epiphany.”\n\nArtist’s Statement\n\nThe artist’s function is to project in his/her art a reflection of contemporary life transmitted via one’s lifetime personal experiences. Taking into account to transmit these experiences into a format that is not only comprehensible but also original. That the artist would be influenced by the past is logical, but the artist must not imitate the past, he/she should adapt the past and give it a new direction, a new life.\n\nThe artist should have two obligations. First, the belief in the sincerity of one’s artistic creation, formulated by work and inspiration. And the second, is in considering that one’s contribution to the present aesthetic, derived from the aesthetics of the past, will become the seed from which will be born the aesthetic of the future.\n\n— Hayg Boyadjian\n\nAfter hearing a performance of Hodkinson’s piano Episodes, Dr. Boyd Jones, Organ Professor at Stetson University, suggested that some of those pieces would also work well on organ. Hodkinson was willing to give it a shot, and in 2009 he completed his Organmusic, a series of six “tableaux” or “drawings” for organ that includes two sections based on the earlier piano work. Jones then premiered the work in 2011, and is the performer on this recording.\n\nThe title’s typography (conflating two words without a space) insinuates a German grammar that isn’t entirely surprising in music for organ. The movement titles themselves conjure a combination of liturgical inspirations (“Introit, Vesper”) with para-liturgical organ genres (“Toccata”), plainchant performance (“Signals and Responses”), and secular stimuli (“Swing Shift” and “Zephyr”). But the actual musical characters of the movement are sometimes delightfully ironic in a manner not often found in the works of Buxtehude or Bach.\n\nHodkinson notes that the opening “Introit” functions as the summoning of an “organ muse.” Two different tempi and moods alternate throughout the movement: a nervous, jaunty figure, and a more haunting, wandering temperament that recalls Erik Satie’s “Rosicrucian” organ works. This acts as a prelude to “Swing Shift,” which is actually less overtly secular than the title suggests. “Swing Shift” is characterized by wedging pitch clusters and anxious, spikey interjections, both ideas growing out of single repeated notes that have a hint of ritual about them.\n\n“Signals and Responses” is adapted from the third of Hodkinson’s piano Episodes. There the score is marked “Suspended, indefinite,” conjuring a sense of the numinous. Sparse, ascetic, chant-like passages in octaves are played with mutation stops on the organ that create parallel harmonizations in the style of medieval organum. Interspersed between these passages are melancholic tremolos on misterioso harmonic progressions.\n\nHodkinson warns that “Zephyr” requires nimble fingers, but it is the agility of lightness and breath rather than muscular virtuosity. The title refers, of course, to gentle breezes, but is also a reminder that the organ is itself technically a wind instrument, and this movement plays on the organ’s “breath” as a leading timbral element. The melodic swirls and eddies are as transient as the breeze itself, passing through without announcing a conclusion.\n\nIf the title for “Swing Shift” sounded more secular than the music itself, then Hodkinson compensates with “Vesper,” where the music is a touch more worldly than the title implies. Vespers is one of the last of the daily liturgical Offices, and while the chant-like melody and open harmonies conform to medieval practice, the persistent grace notes in the melody and jazz colorations in the harmony put a more contemporary spin on the ancient rite.\n\nThe final “Toccata” is based somewhat on the last of Hodkinson’s piano Episodes (where it is titled “Exuberant”). Concluding a keyboard collection with a toccata may indicate a gentle nod to Ravel’s Le Tombeau de Couperin — in the baroque period, toccatas typically began multi-movement works instead of concluding them. Here the unusual 14/16 meter produces asymmetrical patterns of moto perpetuo 16th-notes and jaunty rhythms that are not too dissimilar from Jehan Alain’s organ Litanies. The changing organ registrations allow this movement enhanced opportunities for timbral contrast over its piano cousin, coupled with an increased dynamic range."
