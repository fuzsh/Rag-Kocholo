This may not be in the Education sector that I would normally focus on, but it is always important to look outside of your sector to understand some of the art of possible. Many comparisons with the issues that Higher Educational institutions are grappling with 💡 Elsevier, a leader in information analytics, was facing technical debt and was looking for a game changer. Enter Freshservice 😎 In just 8 weeks, Freshservice transformed Elsevier's IT landscape, from re-establishing the service desk to fostering a culture of innovation. 🌟 Today, with 700 agents and 9500 employees, Freshservice powers Elsevier's journey from reactive to proactive support, achieving exceptional results. How did we do this? - embracing digital transformation - partnering with the research community - leveraging data-driven approaches for unprecedented efficiency Read the inspirational story below: #Freshworks #Freshservice #Elsevier #ITSM\n\n𝟏𝟎𝟎 𝐃𝐚𝐲𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐃𝐨𝐜𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐫: 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐇𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐡𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐟𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐬 On June 13th, we marked 100 days since the launch of Docxplorer, and I found myself reflecting on the incredible journey we've embarked on. Let me share the story of these 100 days, the lessons I've learned, and my vision for the future.The idea for Docxplorer came to me one day, inspired by the fusion of \"Doctor\" and \"Explorer.\" Though it’s a platform for all healthcare professionals, the name felt perfect. The core idea was born from a belief that the healthcare system needed a strong support network. As a medical student and student leader with many friends in the healthcare field, I've had the privilege to connect with many brilliant and innovative minds. My curious nature drives me to constantly seek out new mentors, new methods, and new applications of skills. I see potential in people and understand the skills needed to climb life's ladders from watching experts in their field and reading about the lives of many who have been able to achieve so much with the little time we have on earth. I decided to build Docxplorer on three cornerstones: Mentorship, Networking, and Utilization of Resources. This includes professional training,social media skills for healthcare professionals and demystifying research in healthcare. Our journey began with a step-by-step design, recognizing that the healthcare system, especially in Africa, needs a push to see things differently and realize that significant projects and professional growth are possible at all career stages. I firmly believe that healthcare workers need a support and growth system that caters to their interests. That's why Docxplorer has two slogans: \"The Medic’s Haven\" and \"Investing in People.\" I also believe that if we care for healthcare workers, we will have a better healthcare system with improved outcomes. Through networking in the healthcare space, we aim to reach more minds that can make us stronger and better individuals. After 100 days, I am proud to say we have built a strong team and a budding community with active learning and training underway. It's a beautiful beginning, and by God's grace, we will realize our plans bit by bit for a prosperous future in the healthcare system.

Hailing from Indonesia, Rio is currently making waves as a Data Engineer/Machine Learning Engineer at Cloudflare in London. His journey to where he is today is nothing short of inspiring! When I asked Rio about his path to landing this exciting role, his story left me truly amazed. In the midst of the post-COVID era around 2022, Rio embarked on a bold adventure. He decided to cast his net wider and applied for opportunities overseas. And guess what? Not only did he secure the job, but he also relocated to London to chase his dreams. What an incredible journey of growth and exploration! From our interaction, I've gathered some key takeaways that I believe are worth sharing: 1. Build Skills and Experience: Rio's journey underscores the importance of honing your skills and building a strong foundation of experience. His background as a Principal Data Engineer at LinkAja prepared him for the demand of his current role at Cloudflare. 2. Embrace a Global Mindset: Our career may begin locally, but that doesn't mean we can't dream big on a global scale. Rio's getting the role and move to London demonstrates the power of having a global perspective and the courage to explore new horizons. 3. Take the Leap: Rio's story reminds us all to take a chance and step into the unknown! Sometimes, incredible opportunities await where you least expect them. After all, you'll never know unless you try! As Richard Branson once said, \"If somebody offers you an amazing opportunity but you are not sure you can do it, say yes – then learn how to do it later!\" Rio’s journey embodies this spirit of seizing opportunities and embracing the unknown. So here's to many more “Rios” 😀 and all the dream chasers out there! Let's continue to build our skills, keep our dreams alive, and dare to take those leaps of faith. After all, the journey of pursuing our dreams is a story worth telling 😉 #dreamchasers #inspiration #chasingdreams #globalmindset #seizetheopportunity\n\nWe are happy to announce our first company for Career Day FSS 2024; TNO!

Real energy in the room tonight as our final year students demonstrated their projects to visitors from industry. The hubbub as students discussed the finer points of their projects with experienced technology graduates was great to hear, especially considering that this class started in the covid period. Almost 50% of the class obtain their first position from their Year 3 industry placement which is really a 6 month long period where employers get to understand what talented students can really deliver and student get to understand what industry expectations are - much more efficient and effective for recruitment than interview loops and high-stakes whiteboarding test which don't always give talent a time to shine. If you are interested in discovering and nurturing new ICT talent through either our work placement programme or have software/ cloud computing/ IT Management /AI Skills requirements feel free to reach out to Barry Feeney or Seán McHugh at TU Dublin. A special shout out to IBM's Gary D. and the IBM mentors who mentored a lucky selection of students in their final year projects. 14 years and counting shows a real commitment to giving back in a really impactful way. Shout out also to Ergo, EVAD Technology Group, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Fidelity Investments, Workday, John Mc Quillan (Founder & CTO Fathom), Julio Santana, Ghada Zakaria, David OToole BSc,MSc and many more industry visitors I didn't get to speak to directly! Final call to action - if you are interested in growing ICT talent, giving back and perhaps solving your long term ICT talent needs, feel free to reach out! #WeAreTUDublin #ICTCareers #YoungTalent #EnterpriseComputing\n\nI am excited to share that I successfully completed the 6 weeks Artificial Intelligence Career Essentials (AICE) by alx_africa . Initially I was skeptical about enrolling because of the demanding nature of alx_africa ' s program ( I failed to complete the software Engineering program last year, 2023😅) but I took a bold step despite being committed with industrial attachments and it transformed my life. Throughout the intensive training I gained valuable knowledge and skills in Artificial Intelligence (what it is, how and why it works and its limitations) and Google workplace skills (docs, sheets, email, googlemeet and calendar 🗓) The program equipped me with essential workplace skills such as work planning, resource allocation, effective communication and an AI toolkit😊. The major highlight of the program was the relaunch of VacAI( an application for vacation planning which had failed two weeks after launching due to customer dissatisfaction). The project was tackled by Identifying the problem, forming a dynamic team, assigning roles, updating stakeholders (emails and presentations) on our progress and successfully relaunching the vacation planning app. This experience sharpened my project management and teamwork🤝🏻👥️🤼♂️ abilities. I am already using the skills gained 🤩. thanks alx_africa for the transformative learning Journey #Cohort_1_AICE #doing_hard_things #Artificial_Intelligence #Workplace_Skills #Continous_Learning"
