        "text": "The trio run their own ghost-hunting agency, but things get dangerous very quickly when a new investigation comes along.\n\nBased on the books by Jonathan Stroud, the Netflix series could also return in the future, with writer and director Joe Cornish previously telling RadioTimes.com that he'd be up for two more seasons.\n\nIn the meantime, fans have got season 1 to keep them going, with a spectacular cast, spooky hauntings and some cracking music.\n\nMore like this\n\nSpeaking about the show's soundtrack at a Q&A, Cornish explained: \"Personally I have a thing about needle drops because they're often overused and they're used to give you a boost of familiarity and energy...\n\n\"So we try to use them sparingly and we've gone for some contemporary music but really, a lot of early- to mid-80s goth - Bauhaus, The Cure. Because even though Lockwood & Co feels like it's set in the present day, it's a parallel reality where the digital revolution never happened.\"\n\nHe continued: \"We thought leaning into that moment in the mid-80s, where youth culture was a bit dark, that sort of mid-Thatcherite gloom that hung over Britain, was not dissimilar to what's happening in Lockwood, and a lot of that music expresses that romantic doom that the show tries to capture.\"\n\nRead on for everything you need to know about the Lockwood & Co soundtrack.\n\nLockwood & Co soundtrack: Full list of songs\n\nTitle track: Can’t Leave the Night - Bad Bad Not Good\n\nLockwood & Co episode 1 soundtrack\n\nBela Lugosi’s Dead - Bauhaus\n\nSick Child - Siouxsie and the Banshees\n\nAll We Ever Wanted Was Everything - Bauhaus\n\nLockwood & Co episode 2 soundtrack\n\nStigmata Martyr - Bauhaus\n\nA Forest - The Cure\n\nLockwood & Co episode 3 soundtrack\n\nPeer Gynt Suite No.2 Solveig's Song - Balazs Szokolay\n\nLockwood & Co episode 4 soundtrack\n\nSong to the Siren - This Mortal Coil\n\nLockwood & Co episode 5 soundtrack\n\nNo Love Lost - Joy Division\n\nLockwood & Co episode 6 soundtrack\n\nA55 - English Teacher\n\nParty Fears Two - The Associates\n\nTears Run Dry - The Flight\n\nLockwood & Co episode 7 soundtrack\n\nCruel World - Phantogram\n\nLockwood & Co episode 8 soundtrack\n\nCan’t Leave the Night - Bad Bad Not Good\n\nHomesick - The Cure\n\nLockwood & Co is streaming now on Netflix.
