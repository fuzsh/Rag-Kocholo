        "text": "This twelfth release in the Toccata Classics exploration of the music of Ferenc Farkas (1905–2000) once again puts his chamber music with flute in the spotlight – here with an oboe chaser. As with previous albums in this series, the music highlights the characteristics that make Farkas’ music so appealing: catchy tunes, transparent textures, buoyant rhythms, a fondness for Baroque forms and a taste for the folk-music of his native Hungary that marks him out as a true successor to Bartók and Kodály. The works in this recording are almost all reworkings – by Farkas or the two soloists here – of music first written for different forces and now taking on a new lease of life.\n\nAndrás Adorján, flute (Tracks 1–15)\n\nLajos Lencsés, oboe (Tracks 15, 19–22), oboe d’amore (Tracks 23–26), cor anglais (Track 27)\n\nAndrás Csáki, guitar (Track 12)\n\nBalázs Szokolay, piano (Tracks 1–11, 13–21)\n\nAntal Váradi, organ (Tracks 22–27)"
