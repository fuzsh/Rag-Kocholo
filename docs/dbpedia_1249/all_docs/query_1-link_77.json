        "text": "The 60-minute concert theatre performance of Bartók: In Motion invites you on a journey through time, in which Balázs Szokolay 'Dongó' plays folk wind instruments alongside eight singers of the Saint Ephrem Male Choir. Bartók's male choirs and the folk music that frames them form a narrative, taking us on an adventure to the stations and spiritual stages of a man's life: they reinforce the snapshots taken at milestones of awakening, meeting the fairer sex, struggles, reflections and death, and the folk music collected between the stations prompts us to think further.\n\nBéla Bartók is deservedly one of the most famous Hungarian composers, who left an indelible mark on 20th century music history with his unique musical language. His works for piano and orchestra, as well as chamber music, have, however, been little known alongside his male choirs. Bartók composed only six of these works between 1903 and 1935, and to this day they have not found their rightful place in the repertoire of concert halls around the world, mainly because of their linguistic and extreme technical complexity. With the concert theatre performance Bartók: In Motion, the Saint Ephrem Male Choir aims to present these little-known masterpieces in an enjoyable and accessible way for the general public.\n\nThe piece is based on the concept of Tamás Bubnó, Liszt Prize-winning Artist of Merit, and was created by the Saint Ephrem Male Choir, in which movement is primarily used to visualise the solos and musical material, and this is sometimes combined with the presentation of the content of folk songs.\n\nThe performance was presented by the Saint Ephrem Male Choir on 25 March 2021, the 140th anniversary of Bartók's birth, in the Hungarian Heritage House, as part of an online broadcast. On 13 May 2022, the 20-year-old St Ephrem Male Choir and Balázs Szokolay “Dongó” will perform the Bartók: In Motion spectacle for the first time in front of a live audience.\n\nWith the participation of: Balázs Szokolay Dongó\n\nSt. Ephraim Men's Choir\n\nBalázs Edgár\n\nBubnó Lőrinc\n\nBubnó Márk\n\nTamás Bubnó\n\nOláh Marcell\n\nPapp Viktor\n\nPeter Toth\n\nRácz Ambrus\n\nAssistant director: Veres Borcsi\n\nSound: Mihály Kádár\n\nScreening: Bubnó Lőrinc\n\nCostume design: Schilling Colos\n\nPhoto: ODPictures Art Studio - Domonkos Orbán, Bálint Kertész\n\nStaged by Tamás Bubnó\n\nProducer: Bubnó Lőrinc\n\n____"
