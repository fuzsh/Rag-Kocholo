        "text": "I've owned volumes 1 and 2 for a few years, so unless newer pressings\n\nhave been revised, the following should still apply. All tracks in\n\nvolume 1 match (by ear) to either Dubravka Tomsic (various budget\n\nlabels; my copy is Sonia Classic CD 74537) or Bal√°zs Szokolay (Naxos\n\n8.550252, a 1989 release not part of their ongoing complete series).\n\nHere's the rundown (the Tomsic disc uses Longo numbers):\n\n\"Hatto\" track 1: K. 162 = Tomsic (L. 21)\n\nTrack 2: K. 198 = Szokolay\n\nTrack 3: K. 380 = Szokolay\n\nTrack 4: K. 87 = Szokolay\n\nTrack 5: K. 259 = Tomsic (L. 103)\n\nTrack 6: K. 159 = Tomsic (L. 104)\n\nTrack 7: K. 466 = Szokolay\n\nTrack 8: K. 481 = Szokolay\n\nTrack 9: K. 135 = Szokolay\n\nTrack 10: K. 146 = Tomsic (L. 349)\n\nTrack 11: K. 11 = Tomsic (L. 352)\n\nTrack 12: K. 1 = Tomsic (L. 366)\n\nTrack 13: K. 19 = Tomsic (L. 383)\n\nTrack 14: K. 14 = Tomsic (L. 387)\n\nTrack 15: K. 39 = Tomsic (L. 391)\n\nTrack 16: K. 551 = Tomsic (L. 396)\n\nTrack 17: K. 9 = Tomsic (L. 413)\n\nTrack 18: K. 141 = Szokolay\n\nStated timings are identical to the originals or nearly so, so there\n\ndoesn't appear to be any significant time-manipulation. In most cases\n\nI could identify unique (or most likely unique) elements like\n\nfingerslips, a particular pattern of accents or ornaments, or (in one\n\ncase) an audible edit, all of which matched to the second. Sometimes I\n\nhad to rely on less specific factors like phrasing and dynamics, but\n\nam still confident about the matches-though would be interested to\n\nknow if anyone else who's able to make comparisons hears anything\n\ndifferent.\n\nIn a few cases, the perpetrator(s) could have copied the same sonata\n\nfrom either disc, so their choices are perhaps revealing. For example,\n\nSzokolay's K. 146 (Allegretto in some editions) is considerably more\n\nanimated (2:39 with repeats) than Tomsic's (3:26 with repeats) and\n\nwould not have sounded out of place here, but it was Tomsic's\n\nmoderately-paced version that was used. On the other hand, for K. 466\n\n(Andante moderato), Szokolay's (4:42, second repeat omitted) was\n\nchosen over Tomsic's (8:42, both repeats), even though the latter\n\nseems to me more atmospheric and evocative. The K. 159s (Allegro) have\n\nnearly identical timings (2:10 vs 2:09), and here Szokolay seems a\n\nlittle more interesting: he adds a slight ritard in the first section\n\ncadence and shifts a couple of LH notes down an octave in the second\n\nsection. Yet again it was the less distinctive version (Tomsic here)\n\nthat was chosen.\n\nSound on the \"Hatto\" disc seems \"softened\" compared to the originals,\n\nboth of which have a little more bite and detail, and this also helps\n\nto make the performances less distinctive. In particular, Tomsic\n\n(whose Scarlatti I like a lot-in the original) often uses accents and\n\nsubtle dynamic shadings to good effect, but these are somewhat\n\nobscured in the Hatto-ized versions. As John Gavin pointed out in\n\nanother thread, the results are not really objectionable, but as\n\npresented here, everything sounds a little more...homogenized.\n\nI've tentatively identified the source for most of vol. 2: a\n\nrelatively obscure recording on a French label with a pianist who,\n\naccording to Google, has been mentioned in only four previous threads\n\non r.m.c.r! Details to follow when I can confirm them....\n\nSeth Adelman"
