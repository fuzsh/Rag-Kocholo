Further episodes will also deal with Pride month, World Refugee Day, and the Ocean Race.\n\nThe final episode will be broadcasted on July 26, when the one-year countdown to the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics begins.\n\nScott Young, Vice President of Content and Production, Warner Bros. Discovery Sports Europe, said: “The power of sport lies in its ability to unite people around the world through diversity, competition and, above all, the sacrifices made by athletes who inspire fans to achieve outstanding performances. As we prepare for what promises to be a particularly exciting summer in the world of sports, our goal is to get to know the athletes on a deeper level with the fans and tell their stories, with which we go far beyond content limited to live broadcasts.”\n\nThe first season of The Power of Sport was launched spring 2022 and featured more than 60 reports, including interviews with Janja Garnbret (Olympic sport climbing champion), Susie Wolff (CEO of ROKiT Venturi Racing), Tim Gajser (three-time motocross world champion) and with Bartosz Zmarzlik (two-time slag engine world champion).

Rethinking the use of high sugar-accumulating varieties, e.g. Gray friendly, also about the new trends, and we could taste, for example, natural wines and orange wines.\n\nExhibited wines to taste by wineries as follows: 5 Ház Borbirtok Somló – Androsics Estate – Barcza Winery – Bezerics Vineyard – Dobosi Estate – Éva Dóka Winery – Dörgicsélő – Feind és Feind Winery Ltd. – Garamvári Vineyard – Istvándy Winery-Badacsony – Balázs Káli – Károly Kolonics – Laposa Badacsony – Lázár Cellar – Mórocz Winery – Nagy & Nagy Winery – Nivegy-Völgyi Borgazdaság Ltd. – Yári Pince – Petrányi Cellar – Rádpuszta Vineyard – Tagyon 730 Bormanufaktúra Vineyard – Taverna Winery – Tornai Winery – Villa Gyetvai Winery.\n\nA short description the region’s new winemaker Tagyon 730 wine factory, which is located above Zánka at the foot of Tagyony, Szentantalfai hill.

At the wine tasting table had a glance on a bottle of wine not seen label earlier, called “Bizsergés” – “Tingling”. It was produced from ottonel muscat/yellow muscat 2020 – AL12%.

For years, they have been consciously working to be at the forefront of the retail market in the development of beer products, and the results of the past years have confirmed that they are in the right direction when transforming the product range. Five years ago, small-brewery beers gave 6.5% to their permanent and temporary supply, but today this proportion has increased six times. According to the data and experience of the past years, in volume although the beer product category is no longer growing significantly, consumers are more selective about which type of beer they give thumbs-up … more consciously, within different types. He also added that the Downtown Beer Festival is a great opportunity to draw the attention of discerning beer consumers to the craft products available in their stores all year round, as well as the specialties of excellent domestic small-scale breweries. At SPAR, everyone can find a beer that suits their taste, whether it’s a large-scale product or even unique series-produced, small-scale product.\n\nDániel Kurucz – Downtown Beer Festival main organizer said they are pleased that the festival attracted the interest of one of the country’s largest retail chains. They have been working for years to present the diversity of beer, encourage consumers to drink quality beers and try new products, which are supported by Hungarian craft breweries. Even during the beer festival, these beers ont he spot are also reachable on the shelves at the SPAR stores.\n\nIn addition to the traditional brands of bottom and top-fermented beer the rising new stars, flavored and unflavored non-alcoholic and low-alcohol beers, of which 75000 hectoliters, i.e. 15 million cans, were in the summer season have also sold out – said Dr. Sándor Kántor – Hungarian Beer Brewers.\n\nGyenge Zsolt – President of the National Association of Small-Scale Breweries,told their association, representing the interests of small-scale breweries, their main task to promote domestic breweries’ access to the market. He added that they maintain an excellent relationship with the Agricultural Marketing Center, with whom they expect to co-operate even more closely from the coming Fall. The products will be presented to the professional audience in Finland, Belgium and Germany, and they will be brought together with domestic producers and potential customers at B2B meetings.\n\nAt the end of the presentations the media representatives were taken on a beer tour, whereas visited 6 beer stands and welcomed to taste their beers. See those snaps @ slideshow.\n\nThe 6th Downtown Beer Festival as said above began today, and SPAR Ltd. Hungary has been its main sponsor since this year. The domestic chain has been helping small domestic businesses, including small-scale breweries, to get their unique products onto the market for a long time and encouraging quality beer consumption.\n\nHungarian small-brewery beer was difficult for the general public to access for a long time, since they could typically only get access to unique craft products by ordering online or at a gastronomic festival. The SPAR made up to end this gap when it embraced Hungarian small-scale breweries a few years ago and has continued to support Hungarian small-scale breweries ever since, the permanent and seasonal selection of beers are on its shelves. With the special offer, the supermarket chain offers an alternative to quality instead of quantity consumption, and this is the only principle further strengthened by the fact that SPAR has become the main sponsor. The SPAR’s goal is to further popularize the rich domestic beer culture.\n\nAll those who come to the Beer Festival @ the Szabadság Square be sure to pick up your own special addition beer glass and most sure gonna find your taste of beer and enjoy your loving day.\n\nSlowly we are facing ending to the summer, but there are still more warm days and evenings to enjoy being outdoor around the wonderful environment and for many to still ease their thirst having “liquid bread” as we Hungarians call the beer… who else brought this grand 6 days together for togetherness than the SPAR … Cheers.\n\nAll the 6 days on the tap daft beers and packaging canned beer may reach everyone’s taste.
