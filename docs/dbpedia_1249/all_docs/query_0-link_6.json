        "text": "Learning about (and learning to truly appreciate) great music exposes our children to the cultures and histories of people around the world.\n\nRecently, in one of our SQUILT LIVE! lessons, a student said to me, \"You didn't tell us this was going to be a geography lesson!\".\n\nA-ha! No, I didn't - but I am SO glad they noticed! (I hope they also realize that I'm sneaking in literature, history, science, and MORE through our lessons as well.)\n\nAs we learn about Mendelssohn's \"Fingal's Cave\" overture, we travel to Scotland and read about the mythical giant, Fingal. When we sail to the Caribbean we encounter a blend of African, European, and Indigenous influences that created a unique musical style.\n\nEach piece of music, each musician, each instrument - they all tell a story of a time and place that is new to children. What a beautiful, organic way to foster understanding, empathy, and a love of beauty.\n\nOur approach at SQUILT Music is to broaden your children's world through exposure to music from all over the world, a diverse array of performers, and lesser known composers and musicians. Very few stones are left unturned as we give children a comprehensive music appreciation.\n\nWorld Music\n\nWhen we teach our children about music from different corners of the world, it is inevitable that their horizons and tastes are broadened. In the past few years we have included lessons from the following locations:\n\nVenezuela\n\nMali\n\nScotland\n\nRome\n\nGermany\n\nRussia\n\nUkraine\n\nThe Caribbean\n\nFrance\n\nAustralia\n\nJapan\n\nIndonesia\n\nSouth Africa\n\nAmerica\n\n(and MORE!)\n\nThese lessons include prominent musical styles, folk music, performers, and composers. We listen to authentic performances and explore the geography and history of the region. It is impossible to fully appreciate a piece of music unless you know these things!\n\nPerformers\n\nUsing a piece of music is a wonderful starting point with children, but oftentimes I love to use a PERFORMER as a starting point. There is so much to be learned from a musician's STORY that leads children to an appreciation of their music.\n\nConsider the following musicians we have learned about:\n\nItzhak Perlman\n\nYo Yo Ma\n\nWynton Marsalis\n\nGustavo Dudamel\n\nChristian Sands\n\nTrombone Shorty\n\nFigures from the Harlem Renaissance\n\nVladimir Horowitz\n\nAndrea Bocelli\n\nThe Three Tenors\n\nGuest STUDENT artists who share their talents with their classmates\n\nLesser Known Composers/Musicians\n\nOf course we will learn about the \"obvious\" greats of music. Composers such as Bach, Vivaldi, Beethoven, Mozart, Brahms, Copland, John Williams, and others are definitely worthy of study.\n\nWe have an opportunity, however, to highlight lesser known musicians - which gives the children a chance to dive deeper than the \"mainstream\" music history allows.\n\nConsider the following musicians we have studied:\n\nAmy Beach (we have a free lesson about her!)\n\nFlorence Price\n\nClara Schuman\n\nFanny Mendelssohn\n\nWilliam Grant Still\n\nmusicians of our Armed Forces ensembles\n\nCharles Ives\n\nprofessional guests from symphonies, opera companies, and folk groups\n\nResources for Music Appreciation\n\nCheck out our archive of over 170 recorded lessons (with 2 new live lessons being taught each month!) in the SQUILT LIVE! PLUS membership. The fun thing about these lessons is that they are in a SEARCHABLE database, so you can find lessons to coordinate with your current studies.\n\nWe also have a free Spotify playlist with a fabulous sampling of much of the music that has been taught in our lessons over the past SEVEN years! This playlist gives your children a variety of eras, styles, and performers - something fun to play in the background or in the car!\n\nAnd of course you are welcome to join us at any time in our LIVE lesson membership! You can investigate plans, read testimonials, and get your questions answered on the"
