        "text": "In the ‘70s, Márta Sebestyén’s spirited work with the venerable Hungarian folk ensemble Muzsikás pioneered the renaissance of her homeland’s musical tradition of táncház or dancehall tunes. Her soundtrack for The English Patient and collaboration with Deep Forest on Boheme in the ‘90s brought her deserved acclaim. But Sebestyén’s album I Can See the Gates of Heaven is the crown in her distinguished discography.\n\nOn this powerful 2009 release, Sebestyén turned to her inherited culture of the Carpathians. Expanding from more improvisational ideas of performance, she explored what is called explores “folk-inspired chamber music.” The album’s eight tracks, sung in sacred spaces all over Europe, recall the troubadours, and radiate warmth and sorrow. The Budapest-born singer recalls singing its final song for her father’s funeral in a village churchyard that had survived seven centuries.\n\nSebestyén’s voice resonates through its experimental quality and melodic range. With Muzsikás, it dipped and floated over the intricate, melancholy or joyful ensemble of native instruments. On this solo effort, her vocals stand out more dramatically. Accompanied by only two musicians, rather than four or five of her previous band, the tunes and her voice stand out more prominently in the more intimate setting.\n\nThe expert accompaniment is by Balázs Szokolay Dongó, who plays bagpipes, shepherd’s flutes, tárogotó, saxophone and zither, and Mátyás Bolya, on oriental fretless lute and zither. In contrast with Muszikás, their sound is based less in Hungarian folk and comes more from Central Asian and medieval Christian influences. Their performances are polished, but a rawer strain of energy pulses beneath the surface.\n\nThe album adapts Hungarian songs from secular and sacred sources, staying rooted in the past while eager to play with the present. It engages with the possibilities of world music in a deft, inventive and energetic fashion. Each song tells a story any listener may easily visualize.\n\nBlustering in from Siberian steppes, “Vision” starts harshly before relaxing into a folksy tune. “Heritage” reminds us of the Central Asian origins of the Hungarian nation and stretches into the Far East with a delicate melody. With its winding guitars, “Flower Gatherers” suggests a Budapest counterpart to the ‘60s British jazz-folk quintet Pentangle.\n\n“Driving Away Sorrow” wanders back to a hunter on the icy plateau with overlays of throat-singing and deep chanting, reminiscent of Tuvan tribesmen, while “Invocation” offers a more contemporary touch with woodwinds and a jazzier, introspective mood. This tone continues with “Valiant Knights,” as a dramatic mass of horns usher in what is effectively a wall of Renaissance sound. The knights take quite a musical journey that begins with klezmer and a danceable tango and follows a gentle Japanese rhythm before it circles back to Hungary.\n\nTwo Christian tunes conclude this musical journey across. “Good King Matthias” turns part-troubadour in its flutes, part-dance floor with frenetic strums, while “Evening Prayer” blends the “Kyrie Eleison” and “Gloria” smoothly into an elegant hymn that any listener, no matter will admire, no matter their creed.\n\nI Can See the Gates of Heaven was produced with great care, from its rich production values to its thorough French-English liner notes. The album offers a controlled musical energy that honors the elegance of its sources. Honed by four decades of singing Magyar music, Sebestyén has complete emotional command of the material. Anyone interested in world music should hear her voice."
