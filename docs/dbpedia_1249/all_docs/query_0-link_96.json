        "text": "Lommel, Arle. 2008. ‘The Hungarian Duda and Contra-Chanter Bagpipes of the Carpathian Basin.’ Galpin Society Journal 61:305–21. The Carpathian Basin region of Europe is a center of bagpipe diversity, with a group of instruments characterized by multiple chanter bores with at least one serving the function of a ‘kontra’, a variable drone that sounds the tonic or the dominant below the tonic. The paper argues that contra-chanter bagpipes are historically derived from parallel double-chanter bagpipes of the Balkans. It presents a typology of contra-chanter bagpipes, with further information on Hungarian types and discusses the playing technique, musical repertoire, traditional usage, and post-1970 revival.\n\nUp to the present, no detailed synthesis of the musical accompaniment of folk dances in the Hungarian language area has been written. The main reason is that the attention of folklorists only gradually turned from textual folklore to folk music, and then to folk dance. Moreover, even within each field there may be delays of several decades, at times centuries, between the publication of collections or descriptions on the one hand and their scientific processing on the other. Hungarian folk music research reached the level of scholarly analysis and systematization, as well as interethnic comparison, in the first half of the 20th century, through the contribution of Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály. However, the examination of folk music from the angle of dance could not be initiated until ethnochoreology had come abreast of ethnomusicology in the 1960s...\n\nSince ethnomusicologists are tuned to focus on music, and since, on the other side, players of folk music instruments are scarce, eminent individuals in their communities, the ethnomusicological literature tends to interpret them along the lines of their musical artistry and dedication to music-making. Accordingly, when meeting Pavo Gadanyi, the last inheritor of precious yet disappearing musical knowledge, we expected to find such an individual captivated by music. But the main lesson we learnt from him bears upon the artistry of building social communication among people. He has never played bagpipes just for himself, he has always been eager to play in company, for the amusement of others. This does not mean that, following Gadanyi’s understandings and approaches, we may make conclusions about the whole scene of pre-revival bagpipers, but certainly his ways of musicking should not be neglected either. His case testifies both the merits and limits of an ethnomusicology of the individual. Besides, it recalls yet other important ethnomusicological theories, such as Blacking’s argument on the cultural creativity that springs from social cooperation and loving interaction or Turino’s notion of participatory performance, in contrast to presentational one.\n\nThe dance house and folk artisans movements have developed into such a youth subculture in the cultural scope of the socialist Hungary, which the Kádárian cultural policy could support only partially, it was rather placed at the borderland between the ‘tolerated’ and ‘banned’ categories. The so-called Nomadic Generation was attached to the developing domestic dissident opposition just as well as to the cross border Hungarian intelligentsia through many threads, which seemed to be undesirable for those in power. This study outlines a general picture on the characteristics of the folklorist-movement of the 1970s and 1980s, thought to be dissident in nature, then it will show through examples of different life courses and case studies how the search for new paths materialized in folk handicrafts, and what impact this era exerted on the folk artisanship in the period after the political transition.\n\nThe paper aims to look at those community-organizing phenomena that provided al- ternatives to officially supported, mandatory youth activities and played a vital role in the everyday life of young people in socialist Hungary in the 1970s and 80s. The urban folk dance and music revival, the so-called táncház (dance house) movement, is highlighted. The authors argue that the dance house as a subculture with its con- cept of “authenticity” was able to create common identity with the intrinsic notion of oppositional stance. Parallels are drawn between sports, rock music, literature and the dance house. The process of disintegration and folkloristic discovery of tra- ditional peasant culture in Hungary and in Transylvania, communist peasant policy, and the connections between cities and villages are discussed alongside the phenomena of revival and issues of identity. Keywords: communist peasant policy, socialism, disintegration, folklorism, folk music and dance revival, urban youth movement, authenticity, Transylvania, solidarity, rock music\n\nThis chapter presents folklore, the heritage of peasant culture, and ethnographic activities as a form of oppositional culture and counterculture during the period of socialism in Eastern Europe. This chapter is not, however, a study of how ethnography as an academic discipline constructed images of peasant traditions or folk culture as an expression or form of opposition to communist rule. Its goal, rather, is to explore how various social groups appropriated folklore and ethnography in order to carve out alternative cultural spaces of their own. The main purpose of this chapter is to show how ethnography, folklore activities, and the cultural heritage of the peasantry created the sense of a unified community and alternative modes of thought in the period of socialism, even if the application of folklore was multi-faceted in the socialist period and ethnographic studies and folk culture activities were mobilized to service the ideological needs of the state and state policies inten...\n\nIn the Hungarian folk revival, Hungarian Roma (Gypsies) serve as both privileged informants and exotic Others. The musicians of the revival known as the táncház (dance-house) movement rely heavily on rural Rom musicians, especially those from Transylvania, as authentic sources of traditional Hungarian repertoire and style. Táncház rhetoric centres on the trope of localized authenticity; but the authority wielded by rural Rom musicians, who carry music both between villages and around the world, complicates the fixed boundaries that various powerful stakeholders would place on the tradition. Drawing on media sources and on fieldwork in Hungary and Romania, I examine how authenticity and ‘Gypsiness’ are presented and controlled by the scholars, musicians, and administrators who lead the táncház movement, in particular in the context of camps and workshops dedicated to Hungarian folk music and dance. Organizers often erect clear boundaries of status, genre, and gender roles through such events, which, among other things, address the anxiety raised by Rom musicians’ power in liminal spaces. In addition, I look at how Rom musicians both negotiate with the táncház’s aesthetic of authenticity and challenge it musically. Finally, I discuss how musicians and the crowds that gather to hear and dance to their music together create a carnival atmosphere, breaking down some of the boundaries that organizers work so hard to create. Throughout, I demonstrate that liminality is an extraordinarily pertinent lens through which to view Roma participation in the Hungarian folk music scene."
