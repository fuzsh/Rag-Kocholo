        "text": "EMERGING CONCERT ARTIST SERIES ST JUDE'S BOWRAL\n\nOur ECAs are highly dedicated and passionate. Their freedom to curate without boundaries encourages innovative programming, including creating new compositions. Audiences are surprised and delighted by the outstanding levels, often virtuosic, and the depth and range of musicianship. Access to artistic excellence and innovative programming is particularly appreciated in regional communities.Â Our program offers an environment where sharing the joy of music is the emphasis, bringing to life the appreciation the broader community has for their music. Being paid provides an essential validation for their work - the concerts contribute to a progression path and nurture the possibility of a music career.\n\nWe respect and acknowledge the Traditional CustodiansÂ GundungurraÂ andÂ TharawalÂ people, Elders past and present, and extend that respect to other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.\n\nPROGRAM\n\nBach & Schubert: The Intellectual and Enlightenment\n\nJ.S. Bach Sonata for solo violin in C major no. 3,Â Â I Adagio,Â Â II Fugue\n\nFranz Schubert, Fantasie for violin and piano D. 934\n\nMEET THE ARTISTS\n\nJimmy Park, an emerging young Canberra violinist, is pursuing his master's degree in violin under the renowned Pr. Ole Bohn at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. Commencing his violin journey at the age of 5 under the tutelage of Koen Rens in Brussels, Belgium, Jimmy's journey with the violin began in the Suzuki Method. Relocating to Canberra, he studied with Rowan Harvey-Martin, receiving the 3rd Prize in the Animato International Violin Competition and becoming the youngest member of the 2014 Australian Youth Orchestra.\n\nJimmy then continued his music studies in the prestigious pre-university \"Rising Stars\" program at the Sydney Conservatorium under Pr. Bohn as a scholarship recipient. In 2015, he won the First Prize at the National Youth Concerto Competition, the Australian Composition Prize at the Kendall National Violin Competition, and the Most Promising Player Award at the Gisborne International Music Competition.\n\nJimmy's recent achievements include Fourth Prize in the 2023 Kendall National Violin Competition, First Prize at the 2022 Princess Galyani Vadhana International Ensemble Competition with the Elan Trio, and securing the 2nd Prize in the 2021 Whitworth-Roach ANU Classical Music Performance Competition. Notably, he advanced to the semi-finals of the prestigious 2023 Lipinski International Violin Competition. Having worked with renowned\n\nviolinists and pedagogues in masterclasses with Leon Spierer, Raine Sonne, Gregor Sigl, Sylvia Rosenberg, and others, Jimmy is a featured artist in the Oslo City Museum Concert series. His passion for chamber music resonates in recent performances, including renditions of the Schubert and Bruch Octets with members of the Metropolitan Opera and Cincinnati Orchestras in Brazil and an arrangement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 2 in Norway alongside members of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nAn eminent pianist, Alexander Yau has developed himself as a versatile and serious musician, incorporating his many musical talents as a chamber musician, vocalist, clarinetist, conductor, composer, and music arranger. Pianist Balazs Szokolay writes, \"His artistic taste is good enough not to make any kind of \"show\" even in the most brilliant parts of great masterworks.\"\n\nA multiple-prize winner of many international competitions, he has appeared with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and Queensland Symphony Orchestra, performing the first three piano concertos of Rachmaninov and the mighty Brahms Concerto no.2. He has been invited to perform in the Canberra International Music Festival, Government House, Polish the Embassy of Australia, Phoenix Central Park and City Recital Hall in Sydney, as well as international unique venues such as Grieg's home Troldhaugen in Norway, Villa Mosconi Bertani on the outskirts of Verona, Alice Tully Hall, Shanghai Expo, Google Headquarters in San Francisco, Alice Tully Hall and Peter Jay Sharp Theatre at Lincoln Centre where he gave the US Premiere of Grete von Zieritz's Piano Sonata (1928) at the FOCUS festival last year.\n\nAlex has been accepted to the Pehlivanian Professional Opera Academy, held in Slovenia from July 23rd to August 15th. He will work with Maestro Pehlivanian on Puccini's La Boheme and the Slovenia Festival Orchestra, conducting a tour of 10 concerts.\n\nAttending this academy would be a life-changing experience and a starting point for Alex to develop a career overseas as a conductor. Therefore, he would be immensely grateful if you would consider donating any amount to fund his expenses to attend this academy in the European summer (including academy fee, housing and airfare). For more information and or to donate,Â please visit theÂ Australian Cultural Fund\n\nEMERGING CONCERT ARTIST SERIESÂ -Â A COMMUNITY INITIATIVE AND PARTNERSHIP\n\nThis series is presented through a partnership between St Jude's Music Association and Inspire Music Australia. We sincerely appreciate the sponsorship of community members that make the program possible. We also value the sponsorship of Highlands FM107.1, which helps us promote the concerts and engage our artists in radio interviews and live-to-air performances - a valuable process for young performers.Â\n\n."
