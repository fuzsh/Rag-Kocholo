        "text": "You may have seen in the news recently that scientists analyzed the DNA in Beethoven’s hair. The stories seemed to be bit short on details. But I just found one that provided more insight, and you can read it here. If you want to read the full original scientific paper, you can find it here.\n\nHere are some interesting take-aways I got from reading these articles.\n\nThe claim that Beethoven’s deafness was caused by lead poisoning, possibly from the cup he drank from, is now in question. This claim was based on an earlier study of a lock of hair known as the Hiller lock. It turns out that the Hiller lock is not Beethoven’s hair. How do we know? In the current study, eight hair samples were examined that were claimed to be from Beethoven. Five were from the same person, and study of the provenance (the chain of ownership from origin to now) of these samples indicates that they are likely to be authentic Beethoven samples. The Hiller lock, the basis for the lead poisoning claim, was not among these five. In fact, scientists found out that the Hiller lock came from a female. So, two of the eight hair samples were from people who were not Beethoven, and one was so poorly preserved that results were inconclusive. The current study is based on the five matching samples.\n\nBeethoven’s genealogy on paper does not match his DNA genealogy. The DNA of relatives of Beethoven who are currently alive, whose relationship to him was established using legal records, was compared with Beethoven’s DNA. It turns out they are not genetic relatives of Beethoven. The discrepancy appears in Beethoven’s paternal line, although it is not clear when it happened. This was described as an “extra-pair paternity event.” What this means is that a male ancestor of Beethoven’s may have been the result of an extramarital affair. Scientists could not determine the identity of the unexpected ancestor.\n\nThe exact cause of the Beethoven’s persistent gastrointestinal problems is still unknown, but some disorders have been ruled out. Beethoven frequently commented about the misery he was in due to gastrointestinal problems. Scientists were able to determine that celiac disease, lactose intolerance, and irritable bowel syndrome were not probable causes.\n\nScientists found genetic risk factors for liver disease and an incident of hepatitis B. Historically, it has been thought that Beethoven suffered from liver disease and died of cirrhosis. Risk factors for liver disease were found in his DNA, as well as evidence (in the hair itself) of hepatitis B infection. The authors of the study also cite Beethoven’s alcohol consumption as a contributing factor to his liver dysfunction.\n\nIt is possible that advances in DNA analysis will yield more information in the future. And you can’t help but wonder if similar studies could be done on locks of hair from other historical persons (once they’re authenticated, of course). One late-night TV host suggested cloning Beethoven in Jurassic Park fashion!\n\nEven if it were possible, the cloned Beethoven would never create the masterpieces of the original Beethoven. Cloned Beethoven would live in the 2000s, not the 1800s, absorbing the influences and knowledge of the time that has passed since his predecessor (including the changing opinions about his predecessor’s works). The works of each would be influenced by their life experiences, good and bad.\n\nWe sometimes think of Beethoven as a brooding figure, scowling at us from portraits. What if he were light-hearted? Can you picture Beethoven laughing? With that in mind, here is a Beethoven confection, Andante Favori in F WoO 57 played here by Balázs Szokolay.\n\nWant more? See my post on Beethoven’s Cavatina, or Haiku Wednesday: Beethoven.\n\nIt’s been a tough time, folks. I hope you are well.\n\nEven if you haven’t experienced illness or loss personally in this last year and a half (and I hope you haven’t), it has been pervasive, in the air. The world changed. It was inescapable. Demoralizing. We had to halt so many activities, and it has been difficult to begin again. But begin again we must.\n\nSo we put one cautious foot in front of another. We try to figure out where we left off before we were so abruptly interrupted. In some cases we go back to square one.\n\nMusically speaking, we go back to scales. We go back to training. We start again. We do the best we can, even if it’s a little at a time.\n\nAnd we groan. Because starting from scratch can be tough. And scales are not…exciting. Repetition is not thrilling. Necessary? Yes, absolutely. Worthwhile? Indeed. But not the thing you might rush to do.\n\nI decided to start running again, especially now that it is a little cooler here in the northern hemisphere. One foot in front of another. And, as was my habit before, I queued up some Renaissance polyphony.\n\nOr at least I wanted to, but my old phone had failed, and my new phone doesn’t have any music on it yet. I relied on a streaming service, and it served up what it thought I would want to hear.\n\nAbout mile 3 (running some, walking some, just keep going), I heard music I had never heard before that made me stop to listen. Prominent in the melody was part of a scale. So simple. One note after the other. Repeated, echoed, shifted, a moving line. Simple, but lovely.\n\nThe piece was Corde natus ex parentis. It is a Christmas hymn, and the words are ancient, penned by the Roman poet Aurelius Prudentius (348-413 CE). It was then coupled to a plainchant melody, Divinum mysterium, which dates to the tenth century, though the two were not connected until the 1800s.\n\nHere is what I heard. This ethereal rendition of Corde natus ex parentis is performed by Voces8, and the arrangement is by Christian Forshaw.\n\nBe safe, everyone, do what you can to protect yourself, those you love, and those around you. And let the music play on!\n\nThe genealogy research website MyHeritage has been rolling out new photo enhancement tools over the last few months that allow you to enhance (sharpen and clean up) and colorize old photographs. Their latest addition has now gone viral.\n\nYou can now animate old photographs with their Deep Nostalgia feature. An ancestor you never knew can blink, move their head, and smile at you. It can be eerily accurate, depending on the photo.\n\nSome folks, however, are animating more than just family photos. Classicfm.com has presented on its website a video of composers brought to life with this new technology. And they didn’t just use photographs: Bach has been reanimated from one of his portraits, as has Mozart. You can see the video here. Be aware that the music is a little loud when you hit play.\n\nI tried my hand with family photos and drawings, with mixed results–it all depends on the resolution of the original, head angle, and shadowing, in particular (you’ll see that with the Clara Schumann animation in the video mentioned above). There’s a fellow I’ve written about before here, the mystery pianist Granville Reynolds, Here is his animation. Somehow, the animation makes him even more mysterious. What could he be thinking about?\n\nThe echoes of nostalgia and remembrance are complicated, and that is what I hear in the piece that I give you in closing. Here is an animation of Chopin. Here is his Mazurka, Op. 56 No. 3, played by Daniil Trifonov.\n\n_____\n\nImage attributions: Photograph of Granville Reynolds, family photograph. Enhanced, colorized, and animated by MyHeritage.com.

It’s getting colder. Fall seems to be taking on greater gravity this year. It’s been a tough year. It’s not over. We don’t know what next year will bring.\n\nComing soon are the Christian observances of All-Saints Day, All-Souls Day. The Day of the Dead. November brings Armistice Day, or Remembrance Day, known as Veterans Day here in the United States.\n\nAll are observances of loss and remembrance. So many have lost friends and family just in this year. My heart goes out to all of you. As societies, we look at losses suffered, and wonder at our way forward.\n\nOur motion is perhaps unsteady, perhaps uneasy. There is trepidation in our steps. And yet, we resolve to move forward, somehow.\n\nOne thing is certain. The sun will rise. We may not see it clearly, but after a long darkness, there will be light.\n\nAll of this was in mind when I came across this video of a performance of Lux Aeterna. It is from Edward Elgar’s Enigma Variations. It is a small solace, a balm, a moment of calm amidst the storm. We all need a moment of peace.\n\nAnd because we all deserve another, here is a performance by a virtual choir of Eric Whitacre’s Lux Aurumque.\n\nWishing you health and peace.\n\n______\n\n*My Latin might be a little shaky, but what I meant to say was: On a new day/The sun will rise and/It will be dawn. On a new day/We will find a way/And we will go forward.\n\nImage attribution: Jpogi at English Wikipedia, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Yellow_sunrise.JPG\n\nHi! It’s nice to talk to all of you again. I hope that you and your families are safe and in good health.\n\nI found something interesting for you today. For some of you this will be a trip down Memory Lane; for others, it may be an adventure in time travel.\n\nInternet Archives, in collaboration with the Boston Public Library, is digitizing the library’s extensive collection of vinyl albums. And it is a wide-ranging collection, including classical music, jazz, country, spoken word, international music, and category-defying LPs (I’m thinking of Music for Baton Twirlers and sound effects records, among others). There are even language-learning LPs (I stumbled upon one set I used to own!).\n\nOver 15,000 albums have already been digitized. Of these, over 7000 are classical music. You can narrow your search by genres and subgenres (Baroque, Romantic) or by composer.\n\nFor works that are still under copyright, you can hear 30-second samples, and in some cases you can use the provided Spotify link (which plays on the Internet Archives website) to hear an entire track (or album). Over 2,500 are “unlocked,” meaning you can download the album in uncompressed 24-bit FLAC format, meaning at full fidelity (there are plenty of programs to convert to MP3 if needed). You can also download album art. Cherubini’s Medea with Maria Callas included a full bilingual libretto and liner notes.\n\nA caveat: quality may vary. I heard some albums with wonderful clarity; others had the clicks and snaps typically associated with old vinyl recordings. Those with the inclination and a little tech savvy could probably run their downloads through an audio program like Audacity (which is free) and clean them up a bit.\n\nYou can find the albums at https://archive.org/details/vinyl_bostonpubliclibrary. Here is an article about the project (quick takeaway: each operator digitizes 12 albums at a time in real time; after about 20 minutes, the operator flips each record on its turntable and records the second side—it’s a time-consuming process!). If you derive value from this project, please consider supporting Internet Archive’s efforts with a tax-deductible donation.\n\nAnd while you’re at the Internet Archive, check out the mind-boggling variety of material available at the site. You’ll find books and audio, but you’ll also find films, tv programming, courses, old software and games…just go look, you’ll be amazed.\n\nEven if you can’t go to your local library, you can still get to this one online.\n\n_____\n\nImage attribution: Vinyl record by Meul, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Disque_Vinyl.svg\n\nTimes are tough. We all need to find a way to get through, and the right music definitely helps. Here are some recent finds. Humor, flexibility, and great ingenuity are hallmarks here.\n\nHave you seen the No Corona version of Nessun dorma by Daniel Emmet?\n\nHow about the Covid-19 Bach fugue by Nicholas Papdimitriou? This is incredible.\n\nAnd now, a great concert for you! Pianist Alexander Krichel gave a live drive-in classical piano concert that you can now see online. Car horns and flashing headlights replace applause (it works better than you’d think). The upside? No coughing, cell phones ringing, or candy wrappers crackling (other than perhaps from your family members, whom you can probably shush). Krichel introduces the pieces in German, there are no subtitles available, but there is captioning of the title at the beginning of each piece. You can see it at: https://www1.wdr.de/mediathek/video/radio/wdr3/video-autokino-meets-klassik–alexander-krichel-spielt-beethoven-und-liszt-100.html\n\nWhen life gives you lemons, don’t just make lemonade, make lemon sorbet.\n\nHere’s another tip, not necessarily a musical one, but one you might consider. A friend who lives far away and I have started exchanging photos. Typically, it’s flower pictures (they have a tremendous rose garden), but not always. It doesn’t have to be flowers, it could be a meme, or an animal picture, a photo you take on a walk (if permitted) (added benefit: your picture-taking gets better), a happy memory photo, or a link to some great music, whatever works for you. It doesn’t need to be every day–no pressure (we have enough)! And you know what happens? You end up looking for beauty, or levity, and actually start seeing it amidst gloom and chaos. If you know someone who might be interested in this, why not suggest an informal exchange? Wouldn’t it be nice to see something happy in your inbox or on your phone?\n\nAnd as Daniel Emmet says in his aria, vinceremo [we will win]!\n\nThanks to reader Paul B for alerting me to the fugue!"
