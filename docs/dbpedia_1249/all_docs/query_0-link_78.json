        "text": "by Mike Telin\n\nFollowing the Sixth Session of the Second Round on Sunday afternoon, July 25, PianoCleveland announced the names of the eight pianists who will advance to the Semifinals of the 2021 Cleveland International Piano Competition. Having reached this point through videos recorded at locations around the globe, they will now be performing live in Cleveland.\n\nThose four sessions will be held in Gartner Auditorium at the Cleveland Museum of Art.\n\nThursday, July 29 at 7:00 pm — Ying Li (China) and Honggi Kim (South Korea).\n\nFriday, July 30 at 7:00 pm — Jiarui Cheng (China) and Yedam Kim (South Korea).\n\nSaturday, July 31 at 2:00 pm — Rafael Skorka (Israel) and Martín García García (Spain).\n\nSunday, August 1 at 2:00 pm — Byeol Kim (South Korea) and Lovre Marušić (Croatia).\n\nFor more information, visit the PianoCleveland website. Purchase tickets here, and download the competition program book here.\n\nNew to 2021\n\nA new addition to the semi-final required repertoire is the inclusion of a virtuosic popular music transcription made by Alexey Kurbatov. “I was introduced to him in 2011 when I was playing a concert in Moscow,” CIPC president Yaron Kohlberg told us in March. “He has the ability to take familiar pieces and make them into super-difficult pianistic pieces.”\n\nKohlberg also sees the popular song requirement as audience building. “We want to create a space for people who already love classical music, as well as a space for the audiences of tomorrow — no matter what background or age. When people hear a melody that they know, they may be more inclined to listen to other things.”\n\nContestants can choose from four arrangements commissioned by CIPC: Themes from Mission Impossible (Lalo Schifrin), Bohemian Rhapsody (Queen), America (Leonard Bernstein), and the Olympic Fanfare (John Williams).\n\nAnother edition to the 2021 Semi-Finals is the duo-piano round. Teams may choose either the Schubert Fantasie in f, or the Mozart Sonata for Two Pianos in D.\n\n“We wanted to give the semi-finalists the opportunity to play twice,” Kohlberg said. “This will also give the jury and the audience a chance to get to know the contestants better. We see this as a great opportunity to form friendships and collaborations, and develop the feeling that we are all in this together. It also reveals a different aspect of one’s playing.”\n\nWhat will you hear?

These include Beachwood Community Center, Julia de Burgos Cultural Arts Center, Judson Manor, Maplewood at Chardon, Greater Cleveland Chinese Chamber of Commerce (hosted at the Gilmour Academy), Broadway School of Music, and Normandy Manor.\n\nAnd for the first time, the Semi-Finalists will also be connecting with specific immigrant communities in Cleveland based on their own national heritage through these concerts.\n\nTwo events of interest\n\nHave you ever wondered what is going through a juror’s mind when they’re listening to a contestant’s performance? Join the Jury Roundtable on ​​Saturday, July 31 at 10:00 am in CMA’s Gartner Auditorium.
