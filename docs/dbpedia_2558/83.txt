Niantic‘s augmented reality game “Pokémon Go” is getting a new feature that will make it easier to capture photos of Pokémon in their natural habitats, the developer announced on Monday.

Go Snapshot lets a person take a photo of any Pokémon in their storage. They can access the new photo mode while looking at a specific Pokémon or accessing the camera in their item bag, Niantic said. Once they select a Pokémon, tapping on the screen will release the creature at that spot. They can then move the Pokémon around to find the best angle for their photo or even brush a finger across it to get its attention if it’s distracted.

All of the photos taken with Go Snapshot are saved to a person’s device automatically, Niantic said. Of course, it will be easy to upload those pictures to social media as well, and Niantic has created the #GOsnapshot hashtag for fans who want to share.

There’s no word yet on when Go Snapshot will make its way into “Pokémon Go.” Niantic only said it’s arriving “soon.”
