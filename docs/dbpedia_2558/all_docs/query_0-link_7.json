        "text": "Hello readers/fellow WayFarers‚Ä¶ I find you here today because I find myself at a loss regarding my efforts to improve the images being utiliezed for different Pok√©stops/Gyms in my neck of the woods. I come bearing multiple examples of what has me truly puzzled, not to mention a bit discouraged from continuing my genuine efforts to improve the landscape for all players who might touch upon any of them‚Ä¶\n\nAs can be seen in the first two images, sometimes I submit a new picture, and it goes through almost immediately and the old one is immediately switched out.\n\nWhereas, other times, even when, dare I say, the image I‚Äôve submitted is blatantly the better choice to use, it gets thrown right in the backseat, never to really be seen or noticed by anybody who doesn‚Äôt happen to tap into it to see the additional pictures that are on hand for a particular location, which I honestly know of few to none who actually do that.\n\nPlease reference images 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 for what I‚Äôm getting at. And note the in the 7th image, tapping the in the game has never seemed to make a difference ‚Äì granted that I‚Äôm probably the only one who‚Äôs actually gone ahead and done so.\n\nAnd FIANLLY, ones like this final one, example number 8 are the most offensive/problematic to me as far as upholding acceptance criteria goes‚Ä¶\n\nSo not only was the old mural on this wall literally PAINTED OVER and done away with 2-3 YEARS ago at this point, but it was renamed as well, and the name being switched from the title of the old mural to the title of the new one went through no problem, HOWEVER, quite unfair to the credit of the new artist, the old mural is still kept as the primary, but with the NAME of the OLD artist‚Äôs piece. I submitted the new image, and there it sits in the backdrop, as if it‚Äôs just an alternative view of the same exact thing. As bothersome as it is cringe-worthy to someone like me who cares very much about ACCURACY.\n\nSo please, fellow trainers, can anyone please shine some light on this silliness for poor, determined me?\n\nThanks to all who have read this post that bordered on being a bit of a rant.\n\nOkay I got a bit lost, but I see that you have discovered the on the photo to suggest you like that one. If you tap on the individual photos, you should see how many are on each photo. The one with the most will be the disc photo‚Ä¶\n\nUNLESS\n\nOnce upon a time, Ingress was the database for all Niantic games. Photos could only be changed by likes in Ingress. When the Lightship database was created and photo likes could be added from Pokemon Go, Ingress likes stopped counting for PoGo. BUT when they changed the mechanic, some votes became trapped. Even if the vote is removed from the portal, it still counts as a vote for that photo in PoGo, and this cannot be seen anywhere. On more recent Pokestops, this should not be a problem.\n\nIf you need more votes on a better photo to get the disc photo to change, your friends who are level 38 (yes 38) or higher can the better photo from a gift you send them or a postcard they save.\n\nHey there CyndiePooh, thanks for sharing that perspective on what I‚Äôm inquring about here‚Ä¶\n\nThought I appreciate that quick and thorough reply that gets at some of my conundrum, it still doesn‚Äôt explain how to have a COMPLETELY incorrect image not merely switched out to become the secondary, but eliminated completely as the last example highlights where it‚Äôs just straight-up WRONG to have displayed.\n\nAnd while I comprehend the words that you‚Äôre speaking and you clearly know what you‚Äôre talkingt about, the aspect of the system of Likesüëçüèª working with POIs that are simply younger in age/more recent and not on ones that have already been around for some time is just inherenrtly an issue that needs correcting, because how does something like that really help us adamemt wayfarers in upholding not only the regultions set out for all ofd us to follow, but just the overall correctness of the map that we all collectively navigate?"
