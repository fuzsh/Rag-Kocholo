        "text": "Riding a wave of 90s nostalgia, augmented-reality-based mobile app Pokémon Go has skyrocketed to the top of the App Store over the past week and has added billions of dollars to Nintendo’s market value. The game, which uses a smartphone’s G.P.S. and camera to allow players to capture, collect, and battle digital creatures while walking around in the physical world, has become a phenomenon: players are meeting up by the hundreds, in some cases, at the real-life landmarks where Pokémon often appear, to catch them together in person. Niantic, the San Francisco-based software company behind Pokémon Go, currently makes money off of users by offering in-app purchases of virtual goods that can be used in the game. But soon, its creators hope to make even more money off of its millions of users with a creative secondary revenue strategy: letting advertisers sponsor geotagged meet-up locations within the game.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, Niantic C.E.O. John Hanke said that “sponsored locations” are coming to Pokémon Go. “There is a second component to our business model at Niantic, which is this concept of sponsored locations,” Hanke said, in which businesses “pay us to be locations within the virtual game board—the premise being that is an inducement that drives foot traffic.” Already, some businesses are becoming unofficial Pokémon gyms and Pokestops, rewarding retail-store owners, restaurants, and bars with an influx of players. Currently, being designated as Pokestop is a matter of luck—the game itself decides which locations are important, based in part on a combination of landmarks and geotagged photos from Google Maps (Niantic began as an internal start-up within Google, before it was spun out in 2015). But entrepreneurial retail owners have also begun taking advantage of the game’s in-app-purchase model to reap their own benefits, buying Pokémon “lures” and placing them on the stops at or near their stores to attract customers. Sponsored locations would simply formalize what these more savvy business owners have already begun to do. Hanke told the Financial Times the company would charge advertisers on a “cost per visit” basis."
