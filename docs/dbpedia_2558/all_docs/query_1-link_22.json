        "text": "EAST LYME, Conn. (WFSB) - Giant rent increases are shocking tenants in one shoreline community.\n\nEast Lyme is now considering forming a fair rent commission.\n\nThe Windward Village Apartments is under new ownership.\n\nEyewitness News spoke to a few tenants who have just had their rent increased between $800 - $900 monthly, about a 60% increase.\n\nThey say most of the residents are elderly or disabled on a fixed income, and many won’t be able to afford an increase from $1,400 to $2,200 a month for their two-bedroom apartment.\n\nTonight, residents packed town hall for tonight’s board of selectmen meeting.\n\nFor three years, Tonya Harris paid $1,450 for a cozy two-bedroom apartment at Windward Village.\n\nBut when rent was due August 1, new ownership demanded she pay an extra $800 if she wanted to stay.\n\n“I gave them everything I had. I’m on social security and I’m disabled. I gave them everything I had, and I don’t have any more to give. So as of now, I don’t know if I’m going to be able to stay in my house,” said Tonya Harris, Niantic.’\n\n“It’s really sad, it’s very sad,” said Phyllis Lawrence, Niantic. “Where do I go, you know? And if I can’t be here, where do I go?”\n\nLawrence is 84 years old.\n\n“I fought for people overseas. I want somebody to fight for us. We need it today,” said John Vasko, Niantic.\n\nVasko is a a Vietnam war veteran who lives in Windward Village in a 600-square-foot, one-bedroom apartment. His rent is being increased from$1,000 to $1,900 a month.\n\nThere are very few protections for renters in Connecticut. There is no rent cap.\n\nYou must either file a lawsuit or hope your town has a fair rent commission to take complaints and help you.\n\nThe move by new owners, Alpha Capital, is being called cruel and evil by tenants who packed town hall for tonight’s board of selectmen meeting to demand the town form a fair rent commission.\n\nA fair rent commission is only required in towns or cities with more than 25,000 people.\n\nThere are fewer than that in East Lyme, but residents are hoping a commission can be formed.\n\nThey are on the right track tonight with the board close to drafting up an ordinance to form the commission and expressing support for the tenants.\n\n“I think it’s up to us to set the tone here in East Lyme that this type of behavior isn’t something we want here,” said Candice Carlson, Board of Selectmen."
