        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — There are video games that go viral overnight, causing people to coop themselves up in their homes for days to play.\n\nBut the opposite has happened with Pokémon Go, a free smartphone game that has soared to the top of the download charts: It has sent people into streets and parks, onto beaches and even out to sea in a kayak in the week since it was released. The game — in which players try to capture exotic monsters from Pokémon, the Japanese cartoon franchise — uses a combination of ordinary technologies built into smartphones, including location tracking and cameras, to encourage people to visit public landmarks, seeking virtual loot and collectible characters that they try to nab.\n\nBoon Sheridan, a resident of Holyoke, Mass., has seen the activity firsthand. His home, a converted gable-roofed church that once attracted worshipers, had without his knowledge been designated a Pokémon “gym,” a place where players who reach Level 5 in the game must go to train their Pokémon characters. In the last week, as the game became the most downloaded and top grossing app, he has been wondering how to explain to neighbors all the people who congregated on the sidewalk and pulled up at odd hours.\n\nOn Sunday, San Francisco’s parks and downtown were crawling with Pokémon Go players while in Washington, the White House and the Pentagon have been designated official Pokémon gyms. A bar in Harrisonburg, Va., was offering a 10 percent discount to Pokémon Go players on a specific team, while a tea shop in Japantown in San Francisco offered a “buy one tea, get one free” deal to Pokémon Go players. The number of daily active users on Android devices in the United States alone was closing in on the usage of Twitter, the data analytics firm SimilarWeb estimated.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
