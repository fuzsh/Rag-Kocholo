        "text": "I started playing this game because my nine-year-old grandson played it and I wanted to know what he was doing and what the game was all about and how it would affect him and what was the messages being sent and I didnât think I was gonna have a good feeling about it to be honest with you but after playing it and doing PokÃ©mon GO not only have I become a fan, but I see some redeeming qualities in the game educationally in addition to the âthrill of the huntâ and the camaraderie of taking down a gym together. I do have some major issues however. I understand all electronic anything is going to have glitches. But Iâve played since September 2023 and rarely complained. Maybe thrice. My third one was in response to the meteorite that did NOT show up in a timely manner and I had multiple players trying to sort it out righ up until and after the time ran out. Niantic did nothing. This last raid set with Lucario. 1/10 chance????? 38!!!!! Not a single shiny! Iâm not the only one. And then somebody gets 6 shinies. I did 38. I handle some glitches as âjust part of the processâ but 38 no shinyâ¦1/10 odds. Like I said. I wasnât the only one. It was the number 1 Complaint I heard. Iâm a faithful pokemaner my jeep grand Cherokee sports wonderballs on a he hubcaps and Squirt on the gas tank. Faithful players should be treated better. JS ninjanana\n\nI love how much work you guys have done. This is by far my favorite game Iâve ever played. People have to force me off of it just to pay attention to other things. You guys make sure your players donât get bored so you are many many events. I live off of PokÃ©mon go. I have bought merch, auto catchers, and many other stuff. I have one problem though. My friends and I always play PokÃ©mon go but we always run out of mega energy doing raids. One thing that I know a lot of people want are rare mega energy. Same thing as rare candy and rare candy XL, but for PokÃ©mon that can mega evolve. Normally you see PokÃ©mon in mega raids and they are out for a while. And a lot of them are legendary PokÃ©mon. So you donât see them for even longer. And you have to wait so long when you donât have mega energy and you are waiting for the rest period. But you can walk with them as your buddy to get more. But for legendary you have to walk 20km to get only 100 mega energy. But to fix the problem you can add rare mega energy/rare primal energy. Then the players can mega evolve easier for raids, battling friends, and battling team leaders. Please add it. Itâs especially hard for people have have PokÃ©mon that they want to mega evolve but live in places with almost no gyms. Please add it. It would make peoples lives a lot easier."
