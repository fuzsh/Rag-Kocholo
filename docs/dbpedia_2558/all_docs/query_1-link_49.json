Having announced the very first playable opportunity for Monster Hunter Wilds™ back in June, the publisher confirms a number of other world-first hands-on opportunities coming to the show in Cologne this month.\n\nThe Capcom show floor will feature more than 60 playable demo stations for Monster Hunter Wilds over 900 square meters. The first time it has been made playable to the public, Monster Hunter series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, executive director and art director Kaname Fujioka, and director Yuya Tokuda, will also be present to deliver even more insights on Capcom’s very own Gamescom stage. Monster Hunter Wilds will release in 2025 for PlayStation®5, Xbox Series X|S, Windows and Steam.\n\nAttendees of the Capcom booth will also be able to get the global first hands-on with the newest, and first-ever guest character in the Street Fighter™ series, Terry Bogard, from SNK’s Fatal Fury series. Fans can get to grips with Terry and try out his moves ahead of his release in Autumn this year. Terry Bogard, the Legendary Hungry Wolf, can be purchased individually with Fighter Coins or unlocked for players who own or purchase the Year 2 Character Pass or Year 2 Ultimate Pass. Street Fighter™ 6 is available now across PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam.\n\nVisitors to the Capcom booth will also be able to get a first hands-on with Ace Attorney Investigations™ Collection, which will release later this year on September 6th. Ace Attorney Investigations Collection brings together two classic titles Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth and Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor’s Gambit in one highly anticipated collection! Initially released for Nintendo DS™, the titles return with new and improved features. And for the first time ever, Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor’s Gambit will be available in the West after only being available in Japan.\n\nThe recently released Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess™ will also be playable, giving attendees a chance to experience the thrills of its unique Kagura Action Strategy. As the protagonist Soh, it is the player’s duty to rescue villagers and restore peace along with the Maiden of the mountain, Yoshiro, by purging the defilement that infects their land on Mt. Kafuku. Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is available now across Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Windows, PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, and Steam.\n\nRounding off the line-up is Monster Hunter™ Now!
