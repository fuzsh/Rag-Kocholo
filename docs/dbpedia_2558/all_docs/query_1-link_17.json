        "text": "Since its release three weeks ago, Pokémon GO has become the most popular mobile game of all time, with one in 10 Americans playing the app daily. In the process, Pokémania is building up a treasure trove for marketers as enticing as an 825 CP Dratini: geolocation data on what we’re buying, where we’re going, and how we’re getting there.\n\nThat’s right. Your geolocation data?\n\nNiantic is catchin’ it all.\n\nGeolocation Data And Why It’s Useful\n\nSmartphones and GPS-tracking technologies can give marketers a wealth of information about you, including where you live and work, who you visit, what stores and restaurants you frequent, how often you travel, and even your socioeconomic background. Advertisers are using it to identify audience segments, track their interests, and monitor their real-time movements.\n\nWith geospatial data, marketers can predict your buying habits and digitally tailor advertising to your preferences through a process known as geotargeting, which can double the click-through rate of various kinds of marketing methods, according to data from the LSA Insights database.\n\nThere are multiple companies getting information off your phone at all times, including Yelp, Facebook, Foursquare, Apple, and of course, Google. But the data Niantic is collecting through Pokémon GO offers a valuable level of detail that gives the company the opportunity to be a major player in this small and highly coveted space.\n\n“A dataset like that—there aren’t very many of them,” says Adam Dorfman, Vice President of Product and Technology at SIM Partners. “They have a robust, crowdsourced set of local data, which is very, very difficult to get.”\n\nIn addition to location data, Niantic also has access to any demographic information tied to your email account. After a controversial “outing” of Pokémon GO’s broad access to the personal emails of its users, the company released a statement of apology to the public and reined in its access permissions.\n\n“Since then, they just need an email address, and that’s all that they’re asking for,” said Dorfman. “However, with that email address, they have a key to who you are—they can start tracking your history and everything that you’ve done. They have all that information on their servers,” says Dorfman, who predicts that Facebook integration may also be on the horizon soon.\n\nCommercial Applications\n\nWhile Pokémon GO is already raking in millions a day through in-app purchases of lures and special Pokémon gear, with the volume of geolocation data that it’s gathering, there are many other methods of monetization that Niantic could take advantage of.\n\nSome 70% of consumers are willing to share their location information if they believe they are getting something of value in return, like coupons or loyalty points, according to LSA’s Local Mobile Search Study. In light of this, some experts speculate that Pokémon GO may soon introduce a mobile wallet that will allow players to collect coupons from sponsored Pokéstop locations.\n\nNiantic CEO John Hanke has already announced sponsorship opportunities of Pokégyms, with McDonald’s slated to roll out the first one. The first brands to introduce sponsored locations could fare well with consumers, though Niantic risks a lower-quality user experience if the app becomes oversaturated with marketing.\n\nMarketers could also target players of the game with location-aware advertising—particularly aiming for millennials, who are more likely to be active daily users. Potential marketing opportunities could range from restructuring mall layouts in order to maximize consumer foot traffic, to arranging targeted product placements in popular destinations.\n\nImplications Beyond Advertising\n\nThere are also a broad range of uses of geolocation data beyond advertising.\n\nOne example: Greg Sterling, Vice President of Strategy and Insights for the Local Search Association, cites the geolocation advertising company NinthDecimal, which was able to predict the closure of Sports Authority based on a 39% decline in real-time visitation rates.\n\n“You can make certain predictions about the health or vitality of a retailer based on foot traffic over time…the same way you might look at website traffic over time,” he says – information of great interest to investors. The same dataset could also be used for competitive purposes. According to Sterling, “If you’re Walmart or if you’re Target or if you’re Burger King…you're going to want to know, where else are people going?”\n\nDavid Shim, the CEO of Placed, says his location analytics company has determined that Pokémon GO players are 75% more likely to visit Hot Topic, 36% more likely to visit Victoria’s Secret, 27% more likely to go to Taco Bell, 18% less likely to go to Home Depot, and 2.5x more likely to have other gaming apps like Clash of Clans installed on their phones, among other statistics.\n\nHowever, Shim cautions that the dataset is skewed because it incentivizes players to traverse to locations out of their usual path in order to catch Pokémon. “It’s changing behavior,” said Shim. “From an analytics perspective, it’s going to tell you what people are going to do when they’re in Pokémon GO, not necessarily what they [naturally] do throughout the entire day.”\n\nNevertheless, the tremendous success of Pokémon GO has reinforced the blurring of the digital and physical worlds, and caught the attention of marketers worldwide. “Big brands that didn’t take the digital side of location-based marketing seriously are now paying more and more and more attention to this phenomenon,” notes Sterling."
