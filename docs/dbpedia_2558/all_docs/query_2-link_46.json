        "text": "Microsoft Corp. unveiled an augmented reality version of its popular Minecraft game that lets mobile users construct, view and collect game elements that appear as 3-D images imposed on real-life surroundings.\n\nCalled Minecraft Earth, invitation-only tests of the game start this summer. Gamers can sign up beginning Friday — the 10th anniversary of the release of the original Minecraft — to be selected for the initial tests, although Microsoft declined to say when the game will be released to the public at large. Gameplay will let users collect resources found on their daily travels and create constructions with friends that can be placed in real-world surroundings."
