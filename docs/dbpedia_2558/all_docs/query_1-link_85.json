        "text": "Ingress [Redacted]\n\nNovember 2012 - September 2019\n\nCan Only Be Revived By Love's First Kiss\n\nIngress has been compared to geocaching and capture the flag. Players are called “agents” and have to choose to join one of two teams called “factions” to compete in regions called “cells” by drawing triangles called “fields” to influence the populations living under those fields called “mind units.”\n\nJourney to the Magic Gems\n\nOctober 2022 - January 2023\n\nThey're Always After Me Lucky Charms\n\nIn what could only be described as an absolutely groundbreaking partnership, General Mills and Niantic really outdid themselves with this one. Who would have thought that a breakfast cereal could be the key to unlocking the future of augmented reality gaming?\n\nMARVEL World of Heroes\n\nSeptember 2022 - June 2023\n\nWas Announced\n\nIt’s a relief that we weren’t the interns assigned to replace all the Harry Potter images in the source code with X-Men. It was a huge year for Niantic as they secured two major deals with the NBA and Disney. Niantic only had to deliver a quality and bug-free video game to the public. The marketing video showcased three kids who develop superpowers and begin fighting.\n\nXgress\n\nDecember 2016 - January 2024\n\nThe Calculus Changes Dramatically\n\nXgress was a frontend for a database containing the scraped data of Ingress agents from 2016 until 2024. The tool had a limited free version and a premium version with access to the complete dataset, a helpful IITC plugin to access portal history, and a telegram bot that would provide realtime tracking information of your favorite agents. Although Niantic didn’t produce Xgress, Xgress relied on Niantic’s data.\n\nCommunity Forums\n\nJune 2019 - April 2024\n\nA Place Where You Can Be Conveniently Ignored\n\nRemember yelling into the void on Google+, only to be met with the deafening silence of Niantic’s social media team? Well, fret no more! Those days of inefficient public outreach are over. Niantic offers a whole new level of delightful frustration: official community forums! That’s right, folks. Why settle for the vibrant discussions and helpful advice on platforms like Twitter or Reddit when you can experience the exquisite joy of being lectured by Niantic’s very own officially labeled XM Ambassadors?\n\nTruffel\n\nMarch 2023 - Not Dead Yet\n\nYou Don't Need A Hog To Find This\n\nNiantic launched Truffel at SXSW 2023 and described it as “Niantic’s new app that brings a city’s hidden gems to life.” It’s as if they merely blew the dust off Field Trip, their earlier virtual tour guide application for recommending nearby landmarks and other points of interest, and gave it a fresh coat of paint.\n\nCampfire\n\nMay 2022 - Not Dead Yet\n\nInvite Only\n\nAfter locking down the markets for virtual pets and imaginary sky triangles, Niantic needed a new market to enter. Their executives had never heard of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Discord, Slack, or Telegram. So they decided to build on the success of the Comm feature in Ingress and created their own social network.\n\nHouse of the Dragon: DracARys\n\nJune 2022 - Not Dead Yet\n\nuni apps morghūlis\n\nMaybe we’re giving Niantic too much credit because it will be Warner Bros. Discovery who decides to pull the plug on this one. WB licensed Lightship from Niantic to build this dragon-themed virtual Tamagotchi game. You get a dragon egg, you hatch it, you speak Valyrian to it, you cry when the app stops working because you got attached to your dragon friend and they shut down the servers, etc …\n\nIngress Prime\n\nNovember 2012 - Not Dead Yet\n\nLimping Towards Death\n\nIngress has been compared to geocaching and capture the flag. Players are called “agents” and have to choose to join one of two teams called “factions” to compete in regions called “cells” by drawing triangles called “fields” to influence the populations living under those fields called “mind units.” Following the success of Pokémon Go, Niantic knew that the community wanted flashier graphics and CPU-intensive animations that would drain their batteries faster than ever before, and Ingress Prime was born.\n\nMonster Hunter Now\n\nApril 2023 - Not Dead Yet\n\nNot A Bad Idea\n\nCapcom announced its partnership with Niantic to create an AR version of Monster Hunter. While some may be skeptical of the collaboration, it’s worth noting that Niantic has plenty of experience in adapting Japanese video games that involve hunting monsters. They should be able to get 90% of the way there by applying this regular expression s/sneakers/weapons/ against the NBA All-World codebase. Can Niantic screw it up? We have faith they will. But, if we’re being fair, Monster Hunter is a good fit for Niantic.\n\nPikmin Bloom\n\nApril 2021 - Not Dead Yet\n\nStepping Towards Eternal Sleep\n\nNiantic partnered with Nintendo to develop a game that’s not much more than a pedometer. A cute pedometer. A cute pedometer that has reportedly delayed the delivery of notifications like SMS messages since the beta."
