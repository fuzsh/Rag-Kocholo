        "text": "East Lyme ― Reports of power surges prompted Eversource to shut off electricity to residential customers in the Riverview Road area for about two hours Monday afternoon.\n\nThe utility found “faulty line equipment” caused the surges, according to Fire Marshal Bill Bundy.\n\nNick and Maryana Chahine said a power surge in their 10 Riverview Road home caused electronics, including their children’s computers and light fixtures, to “blow up” before they turned off power to the home and called 911.\n\nMaryana Chahine said the walls of the home were hot to the touch.\n\n“If I wasn’t home today, my house would’ve gone up,” Nick Chahine said.\n\nPower to about 118 Eversource customers was shut off around 3 p.m. and restored by 5:20 p.m. to all but the four residences where surges were first reported, Bundy said. Those four customers are having their homes checked by electricians before their power is restored, he said.\n\nBundy said the call from the Chahines came in at 1:44 p.m. and that another from nearby 14 Riverview Road was received at 3:07 p.m. as the residents complained of the smell and heat of burning wires.\n\nHe said responding firefighters from East Lyme Fire Services and the Flanders, Niantic and Waterford fire departments found no fires or fire hazards.\n\nAround 3:15 p.m., an Eversource worker could be seen across from the Chahine home in a bucket lift examining the power lines.\n\nBundy said firefighters visited houses on Riverview Road between Roxbury and Forest roads to make sure there were no hazardous situations.\n\nOn the corner of Riverview and Forest roads, Josh Wright and Liz Walcott said two separate power surges led to “popping and fizzing” in the electrical outlets. They said their clothes dryer, dehumidifier and possibly their refrigerator were ruined in the surges.\n\ne.regan@theday.com"
