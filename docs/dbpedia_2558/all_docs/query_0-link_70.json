        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nThere's a new \"Pokémon\" game coming to your iPhone/Android this week: \"Pokémon GO,\" an entirely new type of game from the long-running series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Pokémon GO\" is already available in Australia and New Zealand, and people all over the world are about to get their hands on it. Here's everything we know so far:\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Pokémon\" has long been an incredibly popular video game franchise, but this is the first time those cute little pocket monsters are coming to smartphones!\n\n\"Pokémon GO\" is an \"augmented reality\" game, which means you'll aim your phone's camera at the real world and Pokémon will appear on your screen as if they are hanging out on the sidewalk with you. Like this:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlayers will also be able to visit \"PokéStops\" — hubs located around your area that will sell special Poké Balls and other items, like eggs that will hatch after you take a certain amount of steps. Talk about workout motivation!\n\n\"Pokémon GO\" is free, but for those who don't wish to earn in-game currency through playing, real world money can be used to purchase additional coins.\n\nFor example, this is a \"Great Ball,\" a more powerful version of the standard red-and-white Pokéball that can be used to capture more powerful Pokémon. Once you capture a Pokémon, you can use it in battle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis time around, Pokémon don't evolve merely from being used in battle. You collect different kinds of candy for each Pokémon around the world to evolve them. Here, a player just evolved their Charmeleon into a Charizard.\n\nThese PokéStops are \"located at interesting places such as public art installations, historical markers, and monuments.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, as you walk around town, you'll be able to see a map of nearby Pokémon and PokéStops.\n\nYou'll also be able to design the look of your very own Pokémon trainer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlayers can also battle for control over \"Gyms\" around town, which act as major hubs for Pokémon trainers. This one is located near \"Big Heart on the Rock\" in San Francisco:\n\nAt Gyms, you can engage in Pokémon battles with other players. These battles are quite different from what fans have come to expect in other \"Pokémon\" games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of the turn-based battles from other \"Pokémon\" games that can last several minutes, \"Pokémon GO\" has a simplified system where you swipe to attack and dodge in battles that are much shorter.\n\nDiehard Pokémon fans out there can purchase this bluetooth wristwatch accessory, which lets you play \"Pokémon GO\" without looking at your phone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemember, look both ways before you cross the street to catch a wild Pikachu when you snag \"Pokémon GO\" (for free!) this week!\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.
