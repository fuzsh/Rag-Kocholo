        "text": "... to make these changes? We all appreciate anti-cheat measures, but this new coin system - which should actively discourage spoofing, 'cause what's the point of taking over remote gyms if you can't collect - goes way to far.\n\nYou are punishing legit players instead! Cheaters will always find a way, or find new ways to mess with the rest of us.\n\nJust recently I had managed to collect from 8-10 gyms a day on a regular basis, which was nice (although I have spent quite a few $ on the game as well, I have to admit). I did that by learning to prestige, and as I moved up to level 35, maxing out a nice collection of strong attackers and defenders. And now - it's all for nothing.\n\nToday I collected exactly 2 coins as my snorlax came home (I think that wasn't enough for the amount of time he was in the gym, but even if it were 50, that's still not enough). I spent time and several revives/potions taking down a valor gym. Several teammates joined for free (that's OK, I don't have a problem with that), but all I get for my efforts is 2 lousy coins? And although I have 10 other mon in gyms right now, I couldn't collect a dime on them as they are stuck there now until the cows come home (or rivals bother to kick them out, if they bother - there's not much in it for them either).\n\nI appreciate anti-cheat initiatives, really I do, but why are you punishing dedicated legitimate players instead?\n\nPlease reconsider. I would hate to have to quit (probably won't, because it's the best exercise app ever), but I'll try to minimize spending real money on your game now. Because, what's the point? We don't need strong defenders, we don't need strong attackers, we don't get any rewards.\n\nPlease don't ruin this game! It's just too good, and had (has?) so much potential."
