        "text": "Franken, privacy experts raising issues of security.\n\nBy Jim Spencer\n\nSeptember 18, 2016 at 1:57AM\n\nWhat the makers of Pokemon Go know about players begins with location. But it also includes access to \"photo, media and files on the device, camera and contacts,\"; Pokemon Go creator Niantic recently told U.S. Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota. (Aimee Blanchette/Star Tribune)\n\nFranken has proposed a location privacy bill that requires app users to give specific permission for location data to be collected, a process called opt-in.\n\nThe security of information storage for popular apps like Pokemon Go is another issue. Identity theft by hackers is a possible risk, Johnson said.\n\n\"The National Security Agency got hacked,\" he noted. \"If the NSA can't protect its information, how can we expect Niantic to? If the information is valuable enough, there's a chance someone will try to steal it.\"\n\nFinally, there is the matter of selling information to third parties. Niantic told Franken it does not do that. But Johnson and Gartland, who each read the Pokemon Go players' release agreement, said some terms of use are open-ended.\n\nJohnson, who directed cybersecurity in the financial services industry for 15 years, describes himself as \"pro-business.\" But he also knows that the business model of smartphone app developers and distributors is to \"monetize data.\"\n\n\"If they weren't regulated [by government],\" Johnson said, \"they would collect everything.\"\n\nJim Spencer • 202-662-7432\n\nJim Spencer\n\nWashington Correspondent\n\nWashington correspondent Jim Spencer examines the impact of federal politics and policy on Minnesota businesses, especially the medical technology, food distribution, farming, manufacturing, retail and health insurance industries.\n\nSee More"
