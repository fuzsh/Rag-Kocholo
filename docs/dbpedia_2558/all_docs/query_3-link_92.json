        "text": "Niantic Labs, the augmented-reality game company that made Pokemon Go really go and soon will work its magic on Harry Potter, scored $245 million in a Series C fundraising round, giving the Google spinoff a valuation of nearly $4 billion, Niantic said in a release.\n\nThe round was led by IVP, with other funding participants including Samsung Ventures, CRV, Causeway Media Partners, aXiomatic Gaming, and Battery Ventures.\n\nAt the start of the month, Niantic also sold an undisclosed amount of equity for $190 million, it reported in a separate SEC filing.\n\nNiantic's origins date to 2001 as Keyhole, which Google acquired in 2004 and renamed its mapping technology as Google Earth. In 2010, Niantic Labs was created as a startup within Google, focused on mobile devices and mapping for gaming. The company's first game was Field Trip, followed soon after by Ingress, which was a mild hit.\n\nIn 2015, Niantic spun out of the renamed Alphabet, and launched Pokemon Go in July 2016. The mobile augmented-reality game based on Nintendo's beloved franchise spent the rest of that summer as a cultural phenomenon, drawing millions of fans onto city streets to capture digital beasts overlaid on views of their actual neighborhoods through Niantic's tech.\n\nWithin months, Pokemon Go passed more than $1 billion in revenue, making it easily the most successful augmented-reality title ever. Though fan ardor eventually cooled, and the game went through a rough patch in 2017, it rebounded strongly in 2018.\n\nNiantic said the game has been downloaded more than 800 million times since its release. And analyst SensorTower estimated the game's revenues in November alone had hit $80 million, up 2.5 times from the year before, with annual 2018 revenues totaling $795 million globally.\n\nWarner Bros. Entertainment Chief Digital Officer Thomas Gewecke, who is overseeing the Niantic Harry Potter game's development on behalf of the AT&T subsidiary, told me in November that Wizards Unite would feature far more components than a rehash of Pokemon Go featuring Fantastic Beasts from J.K. Rowling's books and movie franchise.\n\nThe company's investors have ambitions beyond gaming, too. IVP's Sandy Miller said in a release that Niantic would ultimately be \"delivering an operating system for applications that unite the digital world and the physical world. It's a rare opportunity to partner up with a company that is already highly profitable at this stage, which is another reason we're so bullish on Niantic.\"\n\nNiantic reportedly is planning to make available more of its augmented-reality frameworks and mapping data for third-party developers that would create other AR games and other applications. The company said it would invest in machine learning and its Niantic Real World Platform, and \"broaden its game offerings.\""
