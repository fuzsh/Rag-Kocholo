        "text": "Rock Paper Reality Partners with Chronic Cellars to Bring First-of-its-Kind Personalized AR Sommelier to Life\n\nTue 31 October 2023 10:30 pm Leave a Comment\n\nRPR brings AI-powered NPC trend into the commercial world, creating opportunities for brands across all sectors\n\n[PRESS RELEASE] World-leading immersive agency Rock Paper Reality (RPR) has teamed up with web-based reality development platform 8th Wall, AI NPC character engine Inworld AI and winemaker Chronic Cellars to deliver a first-of-its-kind, AI sommelier in Augmented Reality.\n\nRPR had previously worked with Chronic Cellars in 2022, transforming the winery’s iconic character — a 2D illustration of a skeleton called Purple Paradise — into an on-label 3D AR game. Now, RPR has used 8th Wall’s newly released generative AI Modules to evolve this character into an interactive and extremely personalized AR avatar.\n\nCLICK HERE TO TRY THE EXPERIENCE, AVAILABLE FOR A LIMITED TIME\n\nThe sommelier can converse, answer questions and present relevant information related to Chronic Cellars’ product line, which includes a portfolio of wines from California’s Paso Robles winegrowing region. From recommendations and tasting notes to seasonal recipes and secrets from the cellars, audiences can engage directly with an AI-powered, deeply knowledgeable representative that fully embodies the brand’s personality. It is powered using Inworld, while the voice was cloned from Chronic Cellars’ original character using ElevenLabs.\n\n“Wine can be perceived as intimidating, especially by those who are new to the category, so we see this as a valuable opportunity to break down barriers for consumers by allowing them to ask questions to an expert without fear of judgment,” said Patrick Cramb, Vice President of Brand Marketing for Chronic Cellars’ parent company, WX Brands. “This AI sommelier experience is totally in-line with Chronic’s mission to deliver unpretentious, delicious wines to a diverse range of consumers. We continue to be impressed with the innovations at Rock Paper Reality that engage our audience with the latest technologies in immersive and AI. We believe this is transformational technology for the future of wine.”\n\nAI-powered NPCs are a big talking point right now, but as a trend more frequently associated with the gaming space. This application brings the concept into the commercial marketplace, opening up countless possibilities for businesses looking to elevate their branding. With this new offering, brands can deliver a uniquely engaging user touchpoint. As is the case of Chronic Cellars, RPR can bring an existing company character into the 3D world and then rig, animate and train it to be a multimodal expression of the brand’s identity.\n\n“We are experiencing a paradigm shift in how brands and agencies can connect with their audiences through generative AI. The power to weave narrative-rich, lifelike conversations and visuals into AR experiences is no longer a futuristic concept. We are excited to see Chronic Cellar’s AI Sommelier experience come to life—it’s a great example of how generative AI is reshaping the landscape of interactive marketing and ad experiences.” – Amanda Whitt, Senior Product Manager at Niantic\n\nThese assets possess a tailored, deep knowledge of the brand or data set, and can be deployed cross-platform for web and augmented reality. Typical use cases might include: a virtual sales assistant, brand ambassador, educator, or a virtual tour guide. They could also be embedded into complex story arcs within gamified experiences.\n\n“It’s quite magical to see Purple Paradise, the winery’s iconic 2D character, being brought to life through the power of webAR and Inworld’s advanced Character Engine. We are eager to see the impact of this emotionally intelligent virtual sommelier and eagerly anticipate this new era of immersive brand engagement where brands leverage the power of conversational AI to connect with their consumers.” – Joana Flor, Executive Producer at Inworld\n\nThis technology is brand new, but has progressed rapidly over the past few months since its inception. We anticipate that virtual assistants and AI brand ambassadors will become the standard for how brands engage with their audience, setting a new customer expectation for personalization. We’re here to help brands embrace this new technology and deliver enhanced experiences for their customers.\n\n“Collaborating on this pioneering project with 8th Wall, Inworld, and Chronic Cellars represents a synergy not just of technology, but of visionary storytelling within the commercial sector,” says Omead Sinai, Head of Strategy at Rock Paper Reality. “This is a transformational shift in branding, bringing Chronic Cellars’ Purple Paradise to life and morphing him from a static character into an engaging, AI-enhanced sommelier. This venture showcases the transformative power of AR and generative AI in crafting personalized, dynamic interactions with consumers, setting a new benchmark in immersive experiences. At RPR, we aim to stay at the forefront of storytelling and leverage the latest technology and partnerships to do so, redefining what’s achievable in immersive marketing.”\n\nAbout Rock Paper Reality\n\nFor over 16 years, Rock Paper Reality’s leadership has shaped the future of 3D and immersive storytelling, growing a best-in-class team of immersive experts.

Creating unique experiences that both stoke your audience’s imagination and signal your brand’s value can be the difference between building lasting relationships with customers and wasting budget on campaigns that just get ignored.\n\nThe global extended reality (XR) market is growing, expected to increase in value to over 100 billion USD by 2026 from 29 billion in 2022. It’s not surprising as we look at younger generations, especially since 93% of Snapchat users are interested in using AR for shopping.\n\nThanks to Geospatial Creator, building and publishing immersive content experiences has just become easier. Powered by ARCore and Google Maps Platform, developers can visualize real environments and produce world-anchored augmented and mixed reality products, opening up creative opportunities for brands across the globe.\n\nWhat is Geospatial Creator?\n\nGeospatial Creator is a tool that enables developers to access the 3D geometry of real-world locations and build augmented reality (AR) experiences for both Android and iOS devices. Available in Unity and Adobe Aero, creators can select a place and build, preview and publish 3D digital content that can then be accessed by end users in the physical world.\n\nGoogle’s geospatial tools draw upon more than 15 years’ worth of Google Maps data. Accurate localization is made possible with Google’s Visual Positioning Service (VPS) — the same technology that has been powering Google Maps Live View since 2019 — while Scene Semantics, Photorealistic 3D Tiles and Rooftop anchors enable developers to identify and understand the unique components within a scene and anchor digital content in real time and space.\n\nImage: T-Mobile Holiday Mode, Time Square, New York, Geospatial Creator powered by ARCore and Google Maps Platform, Google\n\nWhy does Geospatial Creator matter for brands?\n\nSo what does this mean for brands?\n\nIn basic terms, you can now deploy cross-platform, world-anchored immersive experiences with significantly more coverage and without having to scan the physical space yourself. Calling upon the gargantuan coverage of Google’s existing location data speeds up the process of overlaying digital content onto the physical world. It’s important to note that this is not the first instance of VPS — similar capabilities can be found through Niantic Lightship VPS or Sturfee — though these have relied on different data capture techniques such as in-person location scanning, crowdsourcing or satellite imagery.\n\nWhat’s particularly exciting about Google’s offering here is its accessibility. With integrations in Unity and Aero, developers can build high-quality, accurately anchored and geometrically realistic experiences without needing to physically visit the location themselves, and audiences can access them natively in-app or app-less via Aero.\n\nAccording to Ben Sax, Augmented Reality Producer at Adobe, “This is the moment that AR has been waiting for. Creators can now build and deploy digital experiences with the world as their canvas.”\n\nAs we move towards a more widely accessible and friction-less digital layer, the commercial possibilities really are endless. Brands have the opportunity to elevate the way their audiences discover and engage with their products, beyond the limitations of print and conventional digital media.\n\nAs brands seek to develop immersive experiences built in Adobe Aero with Google’s Geospatial Creator, it’s important to work with premiere agencies that have deep knowledge around designing and developing for XR. Rock Paper Reality has become one of our most trusted collaborators and have helped us push our platform and the medium to the edge of what’s possible.”\n\nBen Sax, Augmented Reality Producer at Adobe\n\nRPR: The specialist immersive agency for Geospatial projects\n\nImage: RPR experience for Ben & Jerry’s on Adobe Aero\n\nThe team at Rock Paper Reality has over 15 years’ experience in the augmented reality space and has delivered projects for clients including Red Bull, Lenovo, Amazon Studios, Motorola and Microsoft.\n\nLast year we teamed up with Adobe and Ben & Jerry’s to build an AR game to promote the launch of new Sundae pints. After creating a unique 3D world from modeled assets, we deployed the interactive experience via Aero, where customers could learn about the product and even request a customized Sundae to their door. It enabled users to explore the layers and ingredients in a whole new way and won the People’s Voice Webby for Metaverse, Immersive & Virtual Food & Drink earlier this year.\n\nImage: Digital origami dragon and tree developed by RPR for Paper Tree\n\nWe’re also currently collaborating with Adobe Aero and paper craft supplier Paper Tree. The project will use Google’s geospatial technology to transform Japantown in San Francisco with 3D digital origami artwork, creating a virtual guide to the stores in the plaza and showcasing the history and culture of the space. Using Adobe and Google’s geospatial technology enables us to integrate the AR experience directly into the physical location, without the need for image targets or tracking.\n\nIf you’re ready to launch your first Geospatial Creator experience, we’d love to hear from you. Get in touch to get the conversation started."
