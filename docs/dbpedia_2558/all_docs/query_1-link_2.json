        "text": "In my area, not too many players have the required level to submit or to like photos. Because of this, most of the displaying photos in wayspots are 10 years old, and quite a lot of them were taken at night, for some reason.\n\nAs they’re the oldest, they inevitably have gathered the most likes (not too many, though, the most popular ones have like 12 likes). So, when submitting new (and better) photos, it’s very unlikely that they will gather enough likes to be the displaying photos. I’m okay with that, as it is only a matter of time, but it does bug me a little when I submit nice photos and the current displaying photo is a 10 year old picture that was taken with a greasy Nokia 3310 at 3 AM.\n\nWhen reviewing photos in wayfarer, I usually get to choose between two photos. How does that work? How are the photos users review chosen? As far as I know, there’s no way to report certain photos, so I’m guessing that photo reviews happen when a user submits a new photo. A popular waystop near me has around 6 photos, being half of them (and the displaying one) taken with a potato-phone. If I submit a new photo, which of the 6 photos will be reviewed by, well, reviewers? What would the best course of action be for improving waystops in this case?"
