        "text": "Every organization and business setup has unique capabilities and resources that make it successful in achieving its set business goals and objectives. The resources and power are responsible for giving an organization a competitive advantage over rival firms. When the capabilities and resources are many and match the needs that a company seeks to meet, an organization can attract a significant market share (Mat, Mohamed, and Mohamad). The resources and capabilities are accessed by VRIN analysis, which involves bringing out the value, rareness, imitability, and non-substitutable characteristics. This paper will reveal the VRIN analysis for Niantic Inc.’s product, Pokémon Go.\n\nResource Analysis\n\nBoth Apple and Android can access the Pokémon Go phone application. It enables the phones to fly and connect to locations with games’ features and attributes. It works in a simulated environment as people move from place to place and interact with the environment (Mattheiss et al.). The game players pass through the stimulating environment. Their phones detect the games automatically and capture the user by acting as if they can be played outside mobile phones. Games integrated with Pokémon ensure the users can successfully train and learn the games as if they are the original copies of Gameboy’s (Huff).\n\nNiantic Labs was started in 2010 and was named after a boat anchored in San Francisco during the 1849 Gold Rush period. An American software developer, John Hanker, founded Niantic Labs. The organization was developed as per Google’s Internal features but was later separated and started functioning independently in 2015. Since its independence, Niantic Labs has faced an excellent percentage growth rate. As per 2015 statistics, the firm made sales of $206.5 million with over 130 million game downloads since 2015, when the firm became an independent game director.\n\nNiantic International company’s previous reputation as the most renounced and famous original video game developer helped it make huge sales across the globe (Simmons). The development of the Pokémon Go application was a spin-off that gained an excellent reputation in history. The game has played a vital role in returning several shared memories of the initial fans. The positive part that favors the Niantic international company’s growth is that the firm currently has enough substantial ability to finance its developments and innovations once it can afford the production of premium games compared to its competitors (Huff). This has made Niantic company realize the number of margins that the firm has used to expand the firm.\n\nPokémon Go phone application, as developed by Niantic International, enjoys unique artificial intelligence-enabled video games. The application has brought people together by building a community of users who are loyal to the firm. Consequently, this has resulted in a continuous expansion of the market share served by Niantic International in the artificial intelligence technology business (Mattheiss et al.). The Pokémon Go phone application is an immersive gaming application that enhances the users’ social experience. The application has been in the lead in ensuring the target market and the general users are fit. Once, the firm was an autonomous company that ensured other phone ecosystems became available for everyone to access and use (Simmons). The firm does not have enough worldwide glitches and caps; hence, when frustrations occur in the initial servers, they are deployed.\n\nNiantic International has invested a lot in research activities and product development to ensure that the applications are accessible from hackers and cheaters. Cheaters and hackers can mislead those playing the Pokémon Go game, making them fail the game rather than helping them win by directing them in the victory direction. The company’s set strategies to foresee the cash flow cycles are weak. This is because the competitors of Niantic Company took advantage of the game by collecting a lot of revenue at the expense of the Pokémon Go game Niantic Company. The firm had to redesign the game by removing some features to reduce third-party game visibility, a move that disappointed most gamers. The newly developed Pokémon Go game has better features that attract many users since it applies artificial intelligence technology, which sets a unique standard compared to rivalry and substitute games (Simmons). The game’s new features meet most customers’ needs, tastes, and preferences; hence, they meet the game demands and characteristics of the target markets in the gaining sector.\n\nTo play the Pokémon Go game, one has to be in the location and site where the game is installed. People will always want to win even when traveling or moving from one place to another; hence, they will always try to find and settle in areas with Pokémon stops. Niantic Inc. has ensured that they have installed as many poke stops as possible (Chacar). They have developed a map within the application to provide the users with a guide of the areas they can access and play the Pokémon Go games. The company has achieved this by integrating the game with Google map characteristics with actual photos of places where one can play the game to meet the growing game demand.\n\nThese features have made the game authentic and helped gamers complete their games by finding a perfect place to stop. The firm has ensured active social media platforms to communicate their game catches or failures to the product users. Most customers of Pokémon Go want to share their gaming activities with friends and game competitors; hence, social media integration plays a crucial role in sharing each gaming result. Niantic Company has successfully placed itself on the map, an objective that several companies are struggling to achieve. Accordingly, this has caused the firm to enjoy vast numbers of competitor turnover, primarily through social media networking, a feature that allows gamers to make money.\n\nPokémon Go has several reasons to face rivalry since it attracts vast numbers of users through gamer engagement, social networking, and winning rewards. The game has exploded all over the areas where it is installed so that users can take it, apply it, and enjoy it to attract more potential customers. More customers feel satisfied since the company directly interacts with the users to ensure they share their gaming experience (Chacar). As a result, this makes the firm attract new customers and retain the old ones. The game is designed so that a player enters a Pokémon trainers club for training activities before finding a Pokémon gym. The Pokémon trainers will help a gamer run various ways of gaming, while the gym is designed specifically for battling with other users (Huff). At the Pokémon gym, users are expected to attack each other and defend themselves.\n\nStrategies for Creating, Maintaining, or Sustaining Competitive Advantage\n\nFrom the capability and resource analysis, there are some strategies that Niantic Inc. can use to ensure that it gains a competitive advantage over rival firms. Firstly, the organization should invest in social media marketing to capture many people from the target market segment. Most of the target market for the Pokémon product is young people. Social media is advantageous for Niantic Inc. as it will easily access its target customers. Social media will lead to customer satisfaction as customers get to air their concerns and give feedback concerning the product. Social media has millions of users; hence, it will help brand awareness by making the product known to customers globally. It will help the firm understand what customers want. A social media marketing strategy can be disadvantageous since it puts the brand name at stake. Some Pokémon users may discourage others from using the product, resulting in a loss of customers.\n\nSecondly, the firm can use rewards to maintain a significant market share. This will motivate more customers to join and play the games. The winners should be awarded physical gifts. The selected winners should be shared on various social media handles. However, this strategy is disadvantageous as rewards can be expensive. Lastly, the organization can redesign or reintroduce the old attributes of the Pokémon game before the introduction and integration of Google. The changes it made to the initial product resulted in the loss of some customers as they were not pleased with the new product. Also, to redesign itself, the firm could apply artificial intelligence to ensure that it grows the market share of its development through accurate forecasting of the current market demands and needs in the gaming sector (Chacar). This strategy will ensure that Niantic Inc. develops better target market niches to collect data that they could use to ensure that all the applications the firm develops meet the market needs and expectations, hence proper selling and gaining of a significant market share at both the local and international level. Therefore, this will help attract the lost market share, thus achieving a competitive advantage. However, this is disadvantageous as it will take a lot of time. Additionally, reproducing the missing features to gain the lost customers’ trust may be costly.\n\nRecommended Strategy\n\nFrom the identified strategic options, I’d recommend the social media marketing strategy for gaining a competitive advantage over the rival firm to the CEO. Most people from the target market segment are frequent social media users and will, therefore, see social media posts as they use Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, among other platforms. Social media is used globally; hence, marketing through the platform will allow the company to access users at local and international levels. The risk of using social media is that customers may post negative reviews concerning the Pokémon game products, discouraging other potential customers from enjoying the game. In such cases, the company should ensure that any complaints and negative comments get immediate public clarification to avoid a negative brand image.\n\nConclusion\n\nNiantic Inc. has unique resources, characteristics, and abilities that make it able to produce quality products like the Pokémon Go game. The organization’s resources, such as maps and finances, bring the firm value as they have helped it thrive through the competitive pressure in the gaming sector. The firm’s resources and capabilities are rare as no firm works like Niantic Company, ensuring that it creates unique products compared to competitors. The firms do not imitate and compete with other companies when developing their products; hence, they produce excellent outcomes. The Pokémon Go game product cannot be substituted with other products; therefore, it has fewer competitors considering its uniqueness.\n\nReferences\n\nChair, Aya S. “Capitalizing On the Pokémon Go Craze”. 2017, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EwpM7XNLTvRsOfiCLzLRf3eU9pYVQDlRELZ.
