I found mine by going to Settings>Storage and USB>Images>and there was a folder for PokemonGo. I suspect there should be a slightly easier way to get to them, so if anyone finds one, please share! in the meantime, this should at least work for now!\n\nr13211\n\nNew member\n\nJul 26, 2016\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\nVisit site\n\nJul 26, 2016\n\n#3\n\nI was struggling with the same problem and surprised that there wasn't a readily available answer...but finally got this figured out--at least for me anyway, and suspect it may be your problem as well. When setting up the application, I declined most of the accesses requested, and later found that things don't quite work as they should. For example, the AR capability obviously needs access to the camera. Well, turns out that to store pictures, it also needs access to \"Storage\". Go to Settings/Applications/Application Manager/Pokemon Go/Permissions. Turn on Storage...mine was off and that was what kept pics from being stored. With that turned on (along with Camera & Location), then it works great--in AR mode, press the camera icon and then the round button to capture the scene. Pics show up in the Gallery under a PokemonGo folder.\n\nHope that helps! :^)\n\nnoone606\n\nNew member\n\nJun 6, 2013\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\nVisit site\n\nSep 27, 2018\n\n#4\n\nHas anyone actually found a fix for this or has niantic completely dropped the ball\n\nLucy Davies\n\nWell-known member\n\nMar 14, 2014\n\n1,146\n\n0\n\n0\n\nVisit site\n\nOct 5, 2018\n\n#5\n\nMy AR pictures where not saving at all which really annoyed me so after countless emails & messages to Niantic support on twitter they rolled out a new update which fixed this issue & now my AR pictures save. They even mentioned on twitter that the update fixes it."
