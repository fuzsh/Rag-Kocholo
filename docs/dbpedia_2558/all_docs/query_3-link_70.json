        "text": "Snapshot is the latest feature added to Niantic's AR-based mobile sensation Pokemon Go, and it allows players to take and share photographs of their favorite Pokemon. The Snapshot feature seems like a direct callback to the days of Pokemon Snap, the on-rails candid monster photography simulator for the Nintendo 64, albeit reworked for the modern generation. The new Snapshot features are simple to use, though taking and sharing photos does have a few steps worth learning more about. Here's how to take and share photos using Pokemon Go Snapshot.\n\nHow to use Pokemon Go Snapshot\n\nFans of Pokemon Go will not be surprised to learn just how easy it is to take and share photos using Pokemon Go Snapshot. Like most of the game's other features, Niantic has ensured that snapping photos of players' favorite Pokemon is a breeze. Here's how the process works as outlined over on the official Pokemon Go blog.\n\nTo take a photo of a Pokemon using Pokemon Go Snapshot:\n\nOpen the camera by finding it in the Bag of items. Alternatively, find a chosen Pokemon in Pokemon Storage.\n\nSelect it, then tap on the screen to throw the Poke Ball to the chosen location.\n\nAfter the Pokemon is deployed, players can move around freely to set up the photo.\n\nIf desired, brush across the Pokemon to get its attention and have it face toward the camera.\n\nFinally, press the on-screen shutter button to take the photo. All pictures will be saved to the mobile device automatically.\n\nSharing photos from Pokemon Go Snapshot is even easier. Players can simply select the photo they want to upload then choose the social channel to send it to all within the game. Of course, since all photos are saved to the mobile device, users can also share them like they would any other media â€” through Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, MMS messages, or even good old-fashioned emails. Niantic would prefer social media, of course, and they've invited players to use to he hashtag #GOsnapshot when sharing online so the developers can find and share user-submitted photos through official marketing."
