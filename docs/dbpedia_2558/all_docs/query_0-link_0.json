        "text": "Hi\n\nInspired by our lovely @26thDoctor, who have the luck to reach wonderful areas to take his ordinary pictures , I wanted to ask if you would show me (and the rest of the world ) your best wayspot photo ever ever ever.\n\nAccepted or not, only rule is: taken by yourselve, no 3. party.\n\nThat’s mine:\n\nLibel!\n\nThis because it’s not every day you randomly stumble upon something like it that has not been added yet.\n\nThis is not the greatest photography but it is a cool gift to send as an image. I had to take it from the middle of the road along the filthy, underbelly of an Edinburgh bridge where the junk1es hang out and the tourist bus doesn’t go\n\nMosaic mode.\n\nMost of them are also live in Ingress game. One rejected, some in review and some not as POI primary image.\n\nDo not know about / play other games.\n\nAll images are from Finland.\n\nNot the best photo ever but I thought this one turned out looking about as good as I could get on my phone\n\nI took it this morning and the ML approved it straight away, so I’m pretty pleased to see it live already.\n\nHere are two of my best photo submissions. I only change a phoot if the existing one really bothers me.\n\nIn this one, Spring had just sprung.\n\nThis one is a particular favorite because this sculpture was created by Altanta’s most famous architect, John Portman. The previous image was so bad, it hurt my heart to see his work be presented this way.\n\nThese are my favorite nominations and image additions that have been approved.\n\nNomination. This is part of a hiking trail…\n\nImage Addition. A pic of Madison Square Garden from the rooftop of a nearby hotel, while the Rangers were in the playoffs. I’m a Bruins fan, but I still like this photo.\n\nNomination. So many signal/electrical/traffic boxes, these are the silliest I’ve found.\n\nNomination. This is what I consider my best, track and field at a local college, during sunset. I love sending the postcards of this to people."
