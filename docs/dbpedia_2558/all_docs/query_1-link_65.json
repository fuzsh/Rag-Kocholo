        "text": "Pokemon go just got harsher with the…\n\nPokemon go just got harsher with the new \"I Agree\" clause they activated in 2024. Players will see how harsh it is once the new wave of ban strikes start showing up and people begin to complain about it. Many players will find them selves quitting in the long run.\n\nWarning: Ban strikes for heavy rocket grinders. And heavy players. Some have reported 50-60 before getting one and others max of 160. Others have reported getting ban strikes for family accounts. Being a actively strong player and just above mediocre player. The annoying part is people find loop holes in their game and abuse them to no end and many players get away with no consequences. I found one mistake in family accounts is they tell Niantic that they are a kid account. You are better off not telling them that and setting up an adult account for them with a fake b-day. The mistake is telling them.\n\nNiantic is fed up with cheaters and the innocent players get caught up in the mix. Even if you play by the rules you can get a ban any time any reason. Tension is high with players and niantic and this new I Agree clause just made them more tense. Niantic does not see this and could care less. Fewer people are joining and old long term players quitting. Niantic will ultimately crash and kill their own game. It is detouring active players and when ban waves ripple in the community I do not play at all. I mean, come on you try to play for more than an hour at a park only to get a ban strike for it. That’s ridiculous. Players have given much time to this game and many yrs of playing and don’t want to loose their buffed up accounts to crabby rules. Niantic clearly just wants lighty players and that’s it.\n\nThe game is very unpolished with a ton of bugs, loop holes, issues, unpolished events, botched events and even forgetting to turn on the events. Niantic really needs to polish up their game to run smoothly. I swear they break it every patch and it is just getting worse and worse each update. Many things have been broken for months and just getting worse.\n\nBgl is pretty bad and niantic refuses to fix it even with players complaining in their recent league competition. It's no longer worth it to use it to grind away. It's so bad that it actually takes several minutes to find an opponent now.\n\nCustomer support is terrible with this company. If you have an issue, if, and, or but about your account you’re not able to get any service from them. Niantic is just going to harass you and threaten your account. If you buy anything digitally with this game they just stole your money and will refuse to refund you. Don’t count on buying remote raid passes with real money, have the boss run away and expect a refund. Niantic are slimes and covered their tails in the new “I Agree” clause.\n\nTheir new I Agree clause is trying to make them not accountable for any scenario their players could run into and it’s covering a lot of angles.\n\nTheir program watches your phone and spies on you. It constantly watches your location, checks your browser and other things to see if you’re cheating or not. It is unsure if they are pinshing data as well. Which is a user violation right as well.\n\nGame is unplayable for rural players. When it first came out I lived in a no grid area and moved closer to the city. The game still has not allowed rural players to play remotely or at all or allow grid growth.\n\nWayfaring for pogo to generate new stops is a joke of a program. Players can nominate anything and many times things that should not go through do. And the opposite players submit things on private land but it’s a pill to get it removed and Niantic will not remove them. Their system is broken multi accouters can spam the software and if participation is low it is easy to get stops through.\n\nThe daily coin limit needs to change. This has generated behavioral patterns in players. You see the same players over and over again in the gyms. Some gyms are super aggressive if you try to kick someone out and drop others in. Some gyms you can stay up to 10+ days before getting kicked out and others less than a few minutes. No one honors the 8.5 hrs for the 50 coins. If I did not live under a gym I probably would not bother with raids or the daily coins. Due to the uncertainty when your pokemon will come back or not.\n\nDo not spend any real money on this game. The game it self is free but the company is pushing “pay to play” scenarios. I feel bad for parents where their kids racked up thousands of in game purchases only to get the short end of the stick when the digital data nerfed them some how. This company will happily steal your money and deny you refunds. Your best bet is to contact your bank and declare fraud. Don’t do it too often though. I’m glad the ftc is calling them out on some unfair practices as of late.\n\nDate of experience : August 11, 2024\n\nNiantic lost my partner's account to a hacker and won't return it\n\nAs a mega Pokémon fan, this felt like a gut-punch from Niantic. After playing for 6 years and using it while travelling the world collecting Pokémon, spending a lot in their shop. My partner was unable to log in and when asking for help from Niantic, they asked a bunch of questions which we are 100% sure were answered correctly, and even provided other information that no one would know except them (Like exact locations where she scanned stops) and they told her it wasn't correct and we should just start a new account, like it wasn't important. She spent a lot of money on Pokémon Go and all to lose her Pokémon and items from around the world. I can't believe that something that was so big has such poor customer service.\n\nIt's clear as day that they didn't even check the answers against the account or they found it was hacked and couldn't be bothered to solve problems with their product.\n\nAbsolutely lacking any care for its player base that funded them. I can't explain how angry and upset Niantic have made us. I know its just a game, but it's also a business that should provide security and what they took money for.\n\nNot to mention the clear security concerns of someone else, a hacker having access to location of players. Imagine the kids losing access and the hacker being able to work out where the kid might live just by looking at the collection of in-game \"gifts\" to see where is the most common ones are from. At the very least, they'll know where the user has been to or hangs out at.\n\nNiantic should have to do proper investigations into accounts with suspected hacks to avoid hackers knowing the locations users have been to or are at regularly. Not just a series of questions and when it means work just blocking the real owners of the account to avoid the hassle.\n\nDate of experience : July 22, 2024"
