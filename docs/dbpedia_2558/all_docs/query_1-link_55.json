        "text": "For blind and low vision people, many #VR, #XR, and #AR interfaces and interactions can be largely inaccessible. If you are #BLV and curious to know about the #accessibility of Meta Ray-Ban glasses, listen to Jesse Anderson's hardware review of the Meta Ray-Ban glasses as a legally blind user. https://lnkd.in/g98zyUjB Jesse Anderson is an assistive technology specialist and a member of our XR Access community. His YouTube channel @IllegallySighted features multiple game and app reviews from an accessibility lens. Check out more of his videos here: https://lnkd.in/gQy8Bc99\n\nGestures within mixed reality. We've always interacted with the world, but gestures are the most basic way to do so. We use them all the time in day2day life. The keyboard and mouse combo It was our first advanced way to interact with a computer interface, but it was still limited to the screen. Multi-touch in smartphones area brought gestures back in a big way, letting us tap, swipe, and pinch. Still, we were stuck interacting on a flat surface. Now, mixed reality (or spatial as you like) technology with headsets unlocking a whole new generation of interactive applications built entirely on hand tracking as the main input method. And Iâ€™d like to share a small glimpse of mixed reality experience that our team has been working on. Where we explore the ideas of gestural interaction within gameplay. Oleksandra Holovenkina, Anton Huba, Serhii Kryhin, Yelyzaveta Lisovaya! By the way, if you're curious about gestural interactions in spatial computing, Davide Zhang wrote a fantastic piece about it.

I think we made it some 2-3 years ago using Zappar. It's AR all right, and the visually very pleasing kind too! But I must admit that: 1. I do not see it 2. I am not moving it 3. it's screen recorded through an iPhone BUT... in 2024 using a MR headset this could be built so that I could totally see it and move it and do almost any kind of other stuff with it as well. This XR space is a fast moving one! Check out flyAR Augmented Reality Studio if you dig AR. #augmentedreality #experimental #ar\n\nPre-visualizing some realtime performance capture in #XR! #unrealengine #quest3 #xsens #animation My setup: Xsens body data is being recorded (for later post processing) in MVN and simultaneously streaming over Wi-Fi (via Live Link) to Unreal and the packaged Android XR app. iPhone is recording MetaHuman Animator files for high fidelity facial performance solving/retargeting. iPad is streaming Live Link ARKit Face over Wi-Fi to Unreal and to the packaged Android XR app. Unreal is recording the previz (the combined realtime face and body performance) in Sequencer as seperate takes for a quick editorial turnaround. Tentacle timecode is feeding Xsens/iPhone/Unreal. *can't share audio since this project is currently in development. :)\n\nðŸ¤– One of the strengths of MV Converter is the use of AI to improve user experience, thanks to Apple hardware + software. To improve productivity, input image format is detected by ML processing when not provided by the file format itself. And itâ€™s totally transparent for users. If you are curious, you can test it yourself for free. It works fine with sample videos provided by Insta360 in example. (Available on Titan product page on website) You can test rendering in dedicated players available on the visionOS App Store. #ArtificialIntelligence #MachineLearning #AppleVisionPro #3DMovies #VR\n\nAt an eye-watering $3,500, what will the first killer apps on the Apple Vision Pro be that will justify the price tag? I'm not talking five years from now; I'm talking now. I'll post demos over the next few weeks to showcase my shortlist, starting with the ability to relive memories. ðŸ˜‰ The video below leveraged the Wist Labs Inc. beta. I captured a video from my grandmother's 95th birthday on my iPhone. Then, a few weeks later, I let my mother relive the experience by placing the \"hologram\" of the video back on the couch with augmented reality via Meta Quest 3. Her reaction is as good as it gets. She watched it ten times. With the iPhone 15 Pro, the ability to capture spatial video is already in beta. It will eventually become the standard. And we won't look back. #vr #applevisionpro #spatialcomputing #virtualreality #augmentedreality #ai #photography #technews #future\n\nOur Head of R&D, Dilmer Valecillos á¯… just dropped a new video on his channel that explores using a WebXR tool called Mattercraft from Zappar to build a SpaceX fan prototype that runs on the Apple Vision Pro, Meta Quest 3, Magic Leap 2, Zapbox, and many other devices that support WebXR. The tool itself is easy to use and lets you build out XR experiences full of features for anyone using your app. Check out his tutorial below! #AppleVisionPro #MagicLeap2 #MetaQuest #WebXR https://lnkd.in/gsuJacje\n\nGoogle Removes the Photo Sphere Mode From the Pixel 8 Camera: Since 2012, Google Pixel phones have had a Photo Sphere Mode, allowing users to capture 360-degree images. Now, according to Android Authority, Google has dropped the feature from the Pixel 8 series with no explanation given. From the report: Photo Sphere Mode allowed you to capture panoramic 360-degree pictures by stitching multiple images together. The feature was first introduced back in 2012 on the Nexus 4 and persisted well into the Pixel era, with the likes of the Pixel Fold and Pixel 7a still offering it. The act of capturing a Photo Sphere wasn't exactly seamless owing to the sheer number of images required, although it had an admittedly intuitive UI. Significant stitching issues and exposure/white balance differences were also very common. We're therefore not surprised Google has decided to drop the feature. Even without taking the aforementioned issues into account, the mode's utility seemed limited beyond some scenarios like mapping purposes (e.g. viewing environments in Google Maps) and VR. In saying so, we hope the company rebounds with a more polished take on 360-degree photos in the future.

Importantly, the Safari app on AVP will have experimental support for WebXR, which means that Frame will \"just work\" on it on day one. Hands are the only input mechanism for the AVP (for now), and we already have hand-tracking built into Frame. Looking ahead, the latest Safari preview has support for WebGPU, which means that Apple may be serious about beefing up Safari's 3D capabilities in a big way. Apple has a long history of holding Safari back but if this is changing then it is a major \"raise all ships\" moment for the immersive web. #applevisionpro #avp #webxr #webgpu #metaverse #3d #safari #webdev"
