        "text": "When Pokémon GO was first launched more than seven years ago, in 2016, it took the world by storm, as it was becoming increasingly difficult to avoid its existence. This was due to the massive interest by a huge number of people in Niantic, Inc.’s augmented reality title, with people all across the world actually heading outside for once to play a video game and catch as many Pokémon as physically possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, like with all modern games, the hype quickly died down for GO as well, but it seems like the developer and publisher has a lot more planned for its future, which includes entering the new year with a huge event in January 2024.\n\nNiantic, Inc. and Pokémon GO Invite Players to Celebrate the New Year\n\nNiantic, Inc. announced the news on the official Pokémon GO website, describing the upcoming event as “grand,” as the developer and publisher aims to enter 2024 in pure style with the fans. During the “New Year’s event,” the studio will be introducing brand new content that players should “keep an eye out for,” which includes various fresh debuts and exciting returns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere will be nice little costumes for numerous beloved Pokémon that will be “making their debuts” in the game, along with plenty of “avatar items.”\n\nAs an additional cherry on top, the Pokémon GO event will also mark the comeback of some iconic characters that fans of the long-running franchise should instantly recognize, and the best part is that they will all be in full festive spirits while “wearing party hats.” It is commendable that even for a title as old as this, the developer is ensuring that its player base gets to welcome 2024 in the most fun way possible with the game.\n\nFor those wondering when the New Year event is scheduled to take place, it is set to start at 10 a.m. on Monday, January 1, and will go on until 8 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan 3.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe timings mentioned above are all in the “local time” of GO, so it is not exactly clear what Niantic, Inc. means by that in terms of other timezones. The two Pokémon making their costumed debuts during the event are Jigglypuff and Wigglytuff, both of whom will be “wearing a ribbon” on the top of their heads to celebrate the new year. The announcement also teases the fact that a few “lucky” players can also come across “a Shiny” variant of either of those aforementioned characters.\n\nThe Game Is Going Fully Festive With Its Upcoming Event\n\nAlong with the new content that is coming to GO, the event will also completely embrace the festive season, as “fireworks will light up the skies” in-game as well. The developer hopes that the fans “enjoy the colorful decor” that it has set up for them as the AR title enters yet another era years after its initial release.\n\nThat is not all because there are a couple of “bonuses” that are accompanying the celebration as well, both of them regarding the hatching of Pokémon eggs, but keep in mind that these “will not stack.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth iOS and Android users can set up the GO “Egg hatching widget” so that it always shows up on their devices’ home screens, and for those unaware about how to do it, Niantic, Inc. advises heading over to its post on its official “Help Center.”\n\nThere are also some terrain-specific Pokémon that will be making more frequent appearances “in the wild,” including the aforementioned ribbon-wearing Jigglypuff, Hoothoot donning a brand new festive outfit, and Darumaka. Yet another lucky encounter involves Bronzor, so it is best to keep a lookout for it too in the wilderness.\n\nEven Raids are getting their own set of Pokémon, which includes the starting elemental icons Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle all wearing cute party hats, along with Wurmple bringing his own variant to the celebration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is just the roster for the One-Star Raids, as Three-Star, Five-Star, and Mega Raids come with their own inclusions, ranging from Raticate and Nidorino to continent-specific Pokémon such as Buzzwole for the Americas and Xurkitree for Asia-Pacific. There is only one Mega Pokémon scheduled currently, which is an Ampharos.\n\nPokémon GO keeps living on.\n\nFollow us for more entertainment coverage on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube."
