        "text": "Background\n\nIn Nigeria, following the successful pilot of a community-based distribution (CBD) of injectable contraceptives programme in Gombe State (one of the country’s 36 states), a decision was taken by the National Council on Health – Nigeria’s highest decision-making body on health – to scale-up the intervention starting with expansion elsewhere in Gombe State and later extending to other parts of the country [1]. The CBD of injectable contraceptives, which was included in the national task-shifting policy, entails community-based provision of injectable contraceptives by community health extension workers (CHEWs). Scale-up was intended to ensure that benefits identified during the pilot (particularly higher contraceptive uptake) [1] were made available throughout the country.\n\nThis innovation was important in Nigeria, a country with very low contraceptive prevalence rates (CPR) - 14.6% for any method and 9.7% for modern methods (condoms, pills, intrauterine devices and implants) [2–4]. In addition, there is a wide dichotomy between contraceptive usage in the urban and rural areas – 24.1 and 10.1%, respectively [5–7]. The 2013 demographic and health survey showed only 3% of married women in Nigeria used an injectable contraceptive method, a total fertility rate of 6 per woman, and an annual population growth rate of 3.2% [7]. The low contraceptive prevalence is said to be an important contributor to the unacceptably high maternal mortality ratio of 576 per 100,000 live births with maternal deaths accounting for 32% of all deaths among women aged 15–49 years [7].\n\nIn 2014, scale-up of the CBD of injectable contraceptives, started in Nigeria with a national NGO leading the process. Scale-up started with the training of trainers (experienced nurse midwives) as well as Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) [8]. By end of 2017, large scale provision of injectable contraceptives at the community level had commenced in Gombe State (North East) and Kebbi State (North West). However, the understanding of health system factors that may facilitate or impede the successful scale-up of this innovation beyond the initial pilot site is limited.\n\nHealth system and innovation scale-up in low and middle-income countries\n\nThe importance of scaling up health interventions in order to maximise population-wide benefits has been well documented [9, 10]. Health innovation scale-up is imperative in order to achieve universal health coverage and global development goals [11–13]. Scaling up can be described in several ways but is generally agreed to mean improving the scope and magnitude of health interventions in order to reach more people in terms of number and geographical spread [9, 10, 14]. Scaling up requires commitment in terms of political will, finances, human and material resources [10, 15]. However, in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs), there is a dearth of enabling policies to support scale-up of tested interventions [16]. As alluded to by Gilson and Schneider [13], political will and a conducive policy framework are essential to successful innovation scale-up. Furthermore, sometimes scale-up is embarked upon without a thorough appraisal of health system readiness to deliver the innovations [17], resulting in limited availability of interventions of known efficacy in many low-income countries [1, 18].\n\nThe strength and absorptive capabilities of the health system affect scale-up [10, 19]. Health system factors including weak leadership and governance, inadequate human resources for health [20, 21], limited financing [11], the lack of a clear legal framework, over-centralized health systems [22] and weak stakeholder advocacy [13, 23] limit the ability of the system to utilise increased aid inflow [10] and to implement interventions on a wide scale [21]. It has been demonstrated that assessing the health system’s readiness and preparing the system to implement innovations on a large-scale is critical for successful realisation of the expected health benefits of the innovation [17]. According to Evans and Etienne [24], increasing resources will not necessarily lead to increase output in a milieu of health system fragility. This is particularly so in Nigeria, a country with a complex and weak health system [25]. According to the AIDED model of Bradley and colleagues [16], assessing the system context in which an innovation will be delivered is one of the key stages in the process of scaling up an intervention. The AIDED model conceptualises scale-up as a set of five interconnected and non-linear stages: assess, innovate, develop, engage and devolve. The Assess stage includes understanding the context (including socio-cultural and health system context) in which the innovation will be introduced [16]. An assessment of health system readiness to scale-up the community-based delivery (CBD) of injectable contraception has not been documented in Nigeria where a policy decision was taken to scale-up the CBD innovation [1].\n\nThis study is part of a broader research project applying the AIDED model [16] to explore possible barriers and facilitators of the scale-up of CBD of injectables in Nigeria.\n\nThis paper specifically explores factors in the “assess” component of the AIDED model. The paper aims to identify factors within the health system context that may support or resist the scale-up of the community-based distribution of injectable contraceptives beyond Gombe State, and to explore whether the readiness and receptivity of the health system context was considered in the process of scaling up.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study, we collected qualitative data on health system factors that may influence the scale-up of community-based injectable contraceptives in Gombe State, Nigeria. We also examined how health system challenges were dealt with within the context of the research setting. Our discussion addresses the health system concerns and implications for further scale-up of the innovation.\n\nPrincipal among factors facilitating the scale-up process was political commitment by the federal government of Nigeria. Also, the availability of a policy framework supporting task shifting of administration of injectable contraceptives from the doctors and nurses to allied health professionals like the CHEWs is another important aspect of the political commitment. However, although shifting of roles to CHEWs was necessary for a successful scale-up, it was not sufficient as the task shifting policy was rather generic and does not cover other pertinent issues like commodity supply, logistics and funding. Therefore, the lack of policy and policy implementation guidelines on how to implement the innovation in Nigeria’s health system context may explain the seeming inadequate preparedness with regards to funding, workforce planning and logistics management in the process of scale-up. According to Berlan and colleagues [29], policy formulation and proper implementation is imperative in the process of innovation diffusion. The constraints to scale-up identified in this study include shortages in human resource, poor logistics management as well as theft of commodities, resistance to the task-shifting policy from health professional groups and lack of ownership of the process by the state and local government.\n\nThe availability of a policy framework is closely associated with the political leadership. In the work of Mangham and Hanson [10] and others [13], political will and availability of a conducive policy framework were shown to be essential to successful innovation scale-up. Strong political leadership is said to be critical to the realisation of the global developmental goals [13]. Evidence abounds that a pilot project is essential in documenting best practices, creating an enabling environment for a health innovation, enhancing the quality and improving the capacity of health workers to deliver the innovation [1]. And this was borne out in this scale-up.\n\nFindings from this study show that despite an enabling task-shifting policy, there are still a number of barriers relating to funding, which may impede scale-up. Issues impeding the process particularly relate to inadequate transport for CHEWs, and logistical problems with commodity distribution. Thus, there seems to be a focus on the innovation but inattention to the delivery system. In a study done in Swaziland, on scale-up of voluntary medical male circumcision, Edgil and colleagues demonstrated that sound supply chain management is pivotal to the success of wide scale implementation of a health innovation and that it is imperative for program managers to plan and budget for this from the beginning of the process [30]. Although, the street level bureaucrats in our study demonstrated resilience and ingenuity in the face of failure of logistics to further implementation of the policy provisions, nevertheless the sustainability of their stopgap measures is questionable. Studies have shown that frontline health workers can exercise considerable discretionary powers thus making them important determinants in the implementation of policies [31, 32]. However, how much discretion these street level bureaucrats should be allowed during implementation is still a subject of debate [33]. Furthermore, in the Nigerian context where people are already stretched by high out-of-pocket expenditure on health [34], requiring that they buy injectable contraceptives, when these are not available through public facilities and channels of distribution, undermines the aim of increasing contraceptive prevalence. Political leadership (particularly as expressed through financial commitment and allocation) is needed in this context, but it is not inherently spontaneous, and rather comes through continuous advocacy and government engagements by stakeholders [13, 23]. Advocacy for improved health funding should however not leave out the private sector. The role of the private sector has been described as “large and important” in global health funding [35]. Furthermore, there is increased need for advocacy to translate the current political will into greater financial commitment and increased funding of the scale-up process. According to Gilson and Schneider, an advocacy drive should be focused and targeted at both the political leadership as well the public through lobbying in order to frame public opinion and set the agenda for policy makers [13].\n\nFindings from the study show that insufficient human resources for the scale-up contributed to overwork for the few health workers available, despite the implementation of the task-shifting policy of the federal government. Although the task-shifting policy is officially being implemented in the country, its implementation is still sub-optimal, possibly due to the passive resistance of higher cadre health workers to the process, at least at the inception. In a Malawian study to assess the human resource requirement for the scale-up of highly active antiretroviral therapy, the researchers concluded that the process is labour-intensive and that there cannot be successful scale-up without a commensurate increase in the human resources for health [36]. Thus, inadequate human resource may put significant stress on health workers who are the most important resource of the health system [37]. Scaling up health innovations in a milieu of human resource inadequacy may result in neglect of some other critical health services [38], as well as poor health service provision to citizens [39]. Similarly, in a systematic review of health systems bottlenecks to essential maternal and newborn healthcare, Dickson and colleagues [21] submitted that the principal health system blockage to scale-up of health innovations were human resource for health issues (workforce forecasting, task sharing, motivation for health workers in rural areas), limited funding, challenges in the accessibility of healthcare and unavailability of essential medical products and technologies. Further research is needed to estimate the human resource need for the scale-up of injectable contraceptives in Nigeria and possibly to assess the stress on the available health workers from the current scale-up [36, 38].\n\nStudies have established the contributions of community health workers to increasing access to healthcare and health innovations, reducing cost of care, improving the quality of care as well as contributing to community growth and empowerment in poor and underserved areas [40–42]. Although health workers in this study exercised agency to make sure the commodity gets to women, but their motivation may wane in the face of lack of ‘secure funding’ which may make the scale-up program unsustainable [40].\n\nFurthermore, program managers and policy makers should make improved budgetary provision for supply chain management [30] in the scale-up of the community-based provision of injectable contraceptives and the budget should be monitored for compliance. Likewise, practical procurement and logistics management systems should be instituted in order to ensure constant availability of contraceptive products and delays in the system should be investigated and sanctioned appropriately [21].\n\nAlso, there may be deliberate policies to attract, deploy and retain CHEWs and other health workers in the rural areas as well as to stem the tide of in- and out-migration [37]. Increasing the retirement age of health workers may also be considered [21]. Besides, participants in our study described conflicts among professional health groups around role and task-shifting which slowed down the scale-up process. However, this type of inter-professional conflict, where professions seek to guard their perceived jurisdictions, is not peculiar to Nigeria [43]. Hall [44] believes that more education for health workers about other professional groups’ ideals, philosophies, customs and conducts may help improve cooperative practice among health professional groups. Organizing interdisciplinary discourse and continuing education for professional groups aimed at enlightening health workers about the roles, values, history and cultures of lay health workers may help to limit conflicts among health worker groups [43–46]. This sort of team-building intervention should be proactively done before innovation implementation and scale-up rather than being reactive when resistance might be more difficult to deal with as seen in this study.\n\nThe findings of this study revealed some challenges in the first phase (the ‘assess’ phase) of the scaling up process of community-based distribution of injectable contraceptives in Nigeria [18]. Since the stages of the AIDED scale-up model are interconnected and non-linear, there may be adverse implications for other stages of the scale-up process if the context in which the innovation will be introduced is not properly assessed and prepared. Thus, this study points to some of the issues that could be considered in Nigeria before scaling up the community-based injectable contraceptives to more states.\n\nStudy limitation\n\nCertain limitations of this study should be highlighted: findings may not be generalizable to other local contexts in Nigeria as the country is very diverse. Nonetheless, the findings of this study provide useful insights into understanding how health systems readiness affect the scale-up of health innovations in a developing country like Nigeria."
