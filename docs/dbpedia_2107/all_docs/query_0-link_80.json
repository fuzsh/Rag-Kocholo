APC governors, who secured re-election, included Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe State, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, and Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq of Kwara State.\n\nIn addition, the ruling party retained control of states like Katsina and Jigawa, reclaimed Sokoto, and led comfortably in Ebonyi and many others.\n\nOn its part, PDP, aside re-electing Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, cleared Akwa Ibom State, and maintained unassailable lead in Delta and Rivers states, while posting controlling votes in Taraba, Bauchi, Enugu, and Abia, among states.\n\nHowever, in Adamawa State, there was palpable tension between PDP’s Governor Ahmad Fintiri and APC’s Senator Aisha Ahmed-Binani, who were locked in a tough and tight race. With just one local government, Fofure, remaining, INEC had intended to suspend collation in the state, but the people, reportedly, insisted the exercise must be concluded.\n\nAt the time of filing this report, PDP was already leading with 35,615 votes in Adamawa State, after results from two more council areas – Michika and Song – were announced.\n\nThe situation in Kebbi State was equally tight, as the two main parties – PDP and APC – were in a tie with six local governments each, before collation was suspended last night.\n\nIn Anambra State, the governor, Professor Chukwuma Soludo, reportedly maintained dominance in the House of Assembly with his All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), despite the initial intimidation of the Labour Party (LP), which had a former governor of the state as its face.\n\nSimilarly, Osun State Governor Ademola Adeleke locked down the House of Assembly for PDP, while Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello showed strength for APC in the Assembly, just as Ekiti State Governor Abiodun Oyebanji of APC neutralised his opponents with overwhelming majority in the House of Assembly.\n\nExpectedly, the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) maintained its winning streak in Kano State, leading in many local government areas, and was on the verge of repeating its record during the presidential poll.\n\nIn another development, INEC assured that it was committed to the sanctity of the electoral process, and vowed to take drastic measures against proven irregularities in any part of the country.\n\nLAGOS STATE\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State and candidate of APC was declared winner of the March 18 governorship election, after polling 762,134 votes to defeat his closest rival, Gbadebo Chinedu Rhodes-Vivour of LP, who scored 312, 329 votes. The PDP candidate, Olajide Adediran, came a distant third with paltry 62,449 votes.\n\nSanwo-Olu was declared winner of the election at 01.15 this morning by the returning officer, Adenike Oladeji.\n\nThe governor won the election with about 449,805 votes, after clearing 19 of the 20 local government councils in the state. He lost only Amuwo-Odofin to LP.\n\nGOMBE STATE\n\nINEC declared the APC candidate in Gombe State, Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya, winner of the governorship election held on Saturday. Returning Officer for the state, Professor Maimuna Waziri, said Yahaya scored the highest votes of 342,821.\n\nYahaya, who retained his seat for the next four years, was closely followed by the candidate of PDP, Mohammed Jibrin Barde, who scored 233, 131 votes.\n\nWaziri, who is Vice Chancellor of the Federal University, Gashua, Yobe State, said there was a total of 1, 575, 794 registered voters, 618, 231 accredited voters, 605,355 valid votes, 11, 390 rejected votes, and 616, 745 total votes cast.\n\nYahaya won nine of the 11 local government areas, while Barde secured two local government areas, which had 114 wards.\n\nOYO STATE\n\nGovernor Seyi Makinde of PDP won the governorship election in Oyo State. He was declared winner by INEC in Ibadan, the state capital, yesterday.\n\nMakinde won in 31 local government areas with a total of 563,756 votes to defeat his closest rival, Teslim Folarin of APC, who won in two local government areas and scored 256,685 votes.\n\nThe governorship candidate of Accord Party, Adebayo Adelabu, came third with a total of 38,357 votes.\n\nINEC State Collation Officer, Adebayo Bamire, who is Vice Chancellor of Obafemi Awolowo University, announced the results.\n\nOGUN STATE\n\nOgun State Governor Dapo Abiodun of APC was re-elected in Saturday’s election, after polling 276,298 votes to defeat PDP’s Ladipupo Adebutu, who had 262,383, while Biyi Otegbeye of African Democratic Congress (ADC) scored 94,754 votes.\n\nReturning Officer, Professor Kayode Adebowale, said Abiodun won in 12 local government areas, while Adebutu won in eight.\n\nHowever, PDP submitted a petition to INEC, asking the commission to order a rerun in some polling units, where results were cancelled due to failure of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) and violence.\n\nMeanwhile, Abiodun commended the people of the state for renewing his mandate, saying, “Power belongs to God.”\n\nAbiodun, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, described his victory as heart-warming and a “further proof that no man can play God or stop what God has ordained”.\n\nYOBE STATE\n\nYobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni of APC was re-elected.\n\nThe returning officer, Professor Umar Pate, said Buni scored a total of 317,113 votes to defeat his closest opponent, Alhaji Sheriff Abdullahi of PDP, who polled 104,259 votes. Garba Umar of NNPP polled 14,246 votes to come third.\n\n“I, Professor Umar Pate, hereby certify that Mai Mala Buni, having satisfied the requirements of the law and scored the highest number of the votes, is hereby declared winner of the election,” the returning officer said.\n\nMeanwhile, in a major upset, a 35-year-old candidate of PDP, Musa Lawan, defeated the incumbent Speaker of Yobe State House of Assembly, Hon. Ahmed Lawan Mirwa. Mirwa had been in the House of Assembly representing Nguru II since 2003, and became Speaker in 2019.\n\nLawan, a local businessman, according to residents of Nguru, received the support of his constituency who felt Mirwa was not generous.\n\nKATSINA STATE\n\nGovernorship candidate of APC in Katsina State, Dikko Radda, was declared winner of the election. The state collation officer, Muazu Abubakar, said Radda polled 859,892 votes to defeat his closest rival, Yakubu Lado of PDP, who got 486,620 votes.\n\nThe NNPP candidate, Nura Khalil, got 8,263 votes, while Imran Jino of Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) got 4,226 votes. Ibrahim Zakari of Social Democratic Party (SDP) got 1,049 votes, while Labour Party’s Abu Musawa polled 560 votes.\n\nAbubakar said the number of registered voters in Katsina State was 3,516,719, while accredited voters was 1,399,291, total valid votes was 1,365, 848, and 20,579 votes were rejected.\n\n“The total votes cast in the gubernatorial election was 1,386,427,” Abubakar, who is Vice Chancellor of the Federal University Gusau, stated.\n\nAKWA IBOM STATE\n\nPastor Umo Eno of PDP was declared winner of the governorship race in the state. Professor Emmanuel Adigio pronounced the PDP candidate winner in the contest.\n\nAdigio, who is Vice Chancellor of Nigeria Maritime University, Okerenkoko, Delta State, said Eno scored 354,348 votes to defeat the candidate of Young Progressives Party (YPP), Obong Bassey Albert, who secured 136,262 votes, while APC scored 129,602 votes.\n\nHowever, the former interim National Secretary of APC, who defected to New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) and became the party’s governorship candidate, Senator J.J Udoedehe, got 12,509 votes.\n\nTARABA STATE\n\nIn Taraba State, PDP’s Agbu Kefas maintained the lead in Saturday’s gubernatorial election as INEC declared results of two more local government areas.\n\nIn Ardo Kola Local Government Area, Kefas polled 15,034 votes to defeat NNPP’s Yahaya, who polled 14,577 votes, while the APC candidate, Senator Bwacha, polled 2,343 votes.\n\nIn Yorro, Kefas scored 11,880 votes to defeat Bwacha, who polled 5,282 votes, and NNPP’s Yahaya who scored 4,072 votes. The results of the two local government areas brought the total number of local government area results released by INEC to four, out of a total of 16.\n\nKefas had polled 20,183 votes in Zing local government to defeat Bwacha, who scored 7,299 and Yahaya who scored 2,919. In Lau, Kefas scored 13,368 votes while Yahaya and Bwacha scored 10,196 and 5,079 votes, respectively.\n\nRIVERS STATE\n\nAgents of the opposition political parties in Rivers State, yesterday, protested against the results announced in favour of PDP in the state. Led by the LP agent, Frederick Nwojie, the agents rejected the results announced so far and called for suspension of the process.\n\nThe Accord Party’s agent, Iyk Oji, complained about irregularities, violence, and inconsistencies between results being collated and those uploaded on the INEC portal.\n\nBut Returning Officer, Professor Akpofure Rim-Rukeh, Vice Chancellor, Federal University of Petroleum Resources, Efurun, said the call to stop collation could be granted, but that the agents should document their complaints and submit to him. Rim-Rukeh added that their reports and observations had been sent to the INEC national headquarters.\n\nBut the PDP gubernatorial candidate, Siminalayi Fubara, was leading in the results of 17 local government areas so far announced.\n\nANAMBRA STATE\n\nResults declared so far by INEC in Anambra State showed that the ruling APGA clinched a majority of the seats in the 30-man state Assembly.\n\nThere had been apprehension in the state, especially among members of APGA, following the overwhelming popularity of the presidential candidate of LP, Mr Peter Obi, in the state, after the presidential election three weeks ago.\n\nThere were also allegations by Governor Chukwuma Soludo that Obi had planned to set him up for impeachment if LP clinched the majority seats in the Assembly.\n\nHowever, the results declared showed that APGA clinched 17 seats in the 30-man Assembly, forming the majority.\n\nLP won eight seats, mostly in the cosmopolitan areas of the state, with high number of non-indigenes of the state.
