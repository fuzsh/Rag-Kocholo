        "text": "The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate in Gombe State, Jibrin Barde challenging the election of Governor Inuwa Yahaya of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe court, in a unanimous judgment, said the appeal lacked merit and was needless.\n\nThe Court of Appeal had two months ago affirmed the judgment of the Gombe State Governorship Election Tribunal and dismissed the petition of the PDP, seeking the overturn the re-election of Governor Yahaya.\n\nThe court upheld the tribunal’s verdict that the PDP’s case lacked merit.\n\nThe ruling came months after the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) announced Governor Inuwa as the winner of the Gombe state governorship election with 342,821 votes.\n\nBarde of the PDP was said to have scored 233,131. Unsatisfied, he took the matter to the tribunal, claiming Governor Inuwa’s win did not conform with the provisions of the Electoral Act."
