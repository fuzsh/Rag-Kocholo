        "text": "Safety and security\n\nDemonstrations\n\nDemonstrations occur frequently, especially in central Abuja and other major cities. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Telecommunications and Internet access may also be disrupted.\n\nAvoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place\n\nExpect enhanced security measures and increased security presence\n\nExpect curfews and restrictions on movement\n\nFollow the instructions of local authorities\n\nMonitor local media to stay informed on the evolving situation\n\nMass gatherings (large-scale events)\n\nNorthwestern and Northeastern states\n\nThere is a threat of terrorism, banditry and kidnapping in the following northwestern and northeastern states:\n\nAdamawa\n\nBauchi\n\nBorno\n\nGombe\n\nJigawa\n\nKaduna\n\nKano\n\nKatsina\n\nSokoto\n\nZamfara\n\nYobe\n\nBandit groups are increasingly active in the northwest, including in Kaduna state. Violent attacks involving gunfire and explosives, as well as kidnappings, are frequent. They have targeted:\n\nmotorists\n\ntransportation hubs and networks\n\nlocal communities\n\nA state of emergency has been in effect since 2013 in the states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe to account for the increase in incidents of terrorism in the area. Additional security personnel have been deployed to these states. Curfews are also in effect in cities across these states and in Maiduguri. Other curfews could be imposed in other cities in northern Nigeria or could change on short notice.\n\nLocal authorities could also interrupt telecommunication services in the northeastern states without notice and for indeterminate periods of time. Neighbouring states could also be affected by these service disruptions.\n\nStates of Plateau, Niger, Kogi and Taraba\n\nViolent incidents, including bomb attacks resulting in many casualties, occur in the Plateau, Taraba, Niger and Kogi states. Sporadic episodes of inter-communal and sectarian violence occur in the states of Plateau and Taraba. There has also been an increase in kidnapping cases in Niger State. Further attacks and kidnappings are likely.\n\nNiger Delta states\n\nThe security situation in the Niger Delta region is fragile and unstable, particularly in the states of Abia, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Bayelsa, Delta and Rivers (except in Port Harcourt, where we advise against non-essential travel). Regional and ethnic conflicts between militant groups occur in the area and have led to higher incidents of violent crime and civil unrest. Armed robbery and kidnapping pose a significant threat in the Niger Delta states. Militant activity has also been directed at foreign interests. Armed groups have carried out successful attacks on oil facilities and workers, resulting in injuries and deaths.\n\nIf you choose to remain in the Niger Delta states despite this advisory, be extremely vigilant at all times\n\nIf travelling for business, ensure that meetings are held at a secure location and that your contact is known to you\n\nSeek the advice of local authorities when planning trips and leave a detailed itinerary with family or friends\n\nCalabar and Lagos\n\nExercise a high degree of caution in Calabar, the capital of Cross River State, where the security situation is more stable and facilities are relatively well developed compared to the rest of the country. Avoid non-essential travel to the rest of Cross River State, including the outskirts of Calabar, where seven people, mostly foreigners, were kidnapped in June 2016.\n\nExercise a high degree of caution in the city of Lagos, specifically within the area covering Ikeja in the north down to Lagos Island, Victoria Island and Ikoyi, and from Mile Two (west end of Lagos) to Chevron Estate on the Lekki Peninsula (east end of Lagos). Avoid non-essential travel beyond this area. The level of criminality in Lagos is high and incidents of violent crime, including assaults and armed attacks, have occurred against foreign nationals and in areas frequented by foreigners. Avoid all unnecessary travel after dark.\n\nIf you decide to travel to these cities you should stay in secure, guarded accommodations and maintain a high level of personal security awareness at all times.\n\nIdentification\n\nCarry photocopies of your official identification at all times and safely store passports, visas and travel documents.\n\nCrime\n\nThere is a high level of crime throughout Nigeria, including armed robbery, kidnapping for ransom, home invasions, carjacking and violent assault. Robberies and muggings conducted by large, well-armed groups, in places frequented by expatriates, are common. Some have been committed by persons posing as police or military personnel, particularly in the Niger Delta.\n\nCriminal activity is high in urban areas, including the city of Lagos, as well as on the northern border with Niger and Chad.\n\nThere has been an increase in violent crime in the outer suburbs of Abuja and the Federal Capital territory since mid-2022.\n\nPetty crime\n\nPetty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs, particularly in crowded places such as public markets and popular tourist sites.\n\nEnsure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times\n\nAvoid walking alone and displaying any signs of affluence in public\n\nAvoid all unnecessary travel after dark, when crime increases\n\nDo not leave valuables or bags unattended\n\nUse caution when travelling to and from banks\n\nBe particularly discreet when using ATM’s, as criminals could follow you to rob you\n\nShould you visit a beach, particularly Lekki and Bar beaches on Victoria Island do so only during daylight and in large groups\n\nBe wary of tourist excursions. Sign up with a reputable tour company\n\nKidnapping\n\nKidnapping threat in Abuja\n\nThere is an increased threat of kidnapping in Abuja.\n\nThere is an increased police and military presence to combat crime and kidnappings in forested areas in the Federal Capital Territory, including in and around Abuja.\n\nBe extremely vigilant\n\nLimit your movements\n\nAvoid walking and hiking forested areas\n\nExercise caution and keep a low profile\n\nMonitor local media to stay informed on the evolving situation\n\nFollow the instructions of local authorities\n\nKidnappings of foreign and Nigerian nationals occur throughout Nigeria. They are a particular threat in North, North-East and Southern Nigeria.\n\nSince April 2019, several kidnappings have occurred. Those crimes, often perpetrated by small groups of armed individuals, are indiscriminate. Residents and foreigners alike have been abducted and held captive, sometimes for days, until ransom was paid. Deaths have also been reported.\n\nThroughout the Niger Delta states, numerous Westerners, mainly oil and gas facility workers, have been abducted, and, in some cases, killed. Remain especially vigilant in:\n\nWarri, Delta state\n\nin Port Harcourt, Rivers state\n\nthe states of Abia, Anambra and Imo\n\nKidnappings for ransom targeting Westerners have increased in the affluent areas of Lagos and the surrounding states of Ogun, Osun and Ondo.\n\nTerrorism\n\nThere is a threat of terrorism throughout Nigeria, particularly in the northern and northeastern areas of the country. Attacks have been conducted across the country, including in Abuja. Numerous attacks on individuals, groups and security forces have occurred since 2018. Further attacks are likely.\n\nTargets could include:\n\ngovernment buildings, including schools\n\nplaces of worship\n\nairports and other transportation hubs and networks\n\npublic areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners\n\nAlways be aware of your surroundings when in public places.\n\nBe particularly vigilant if attending sporting events and during religious holidays and other public celebrations, as terrorists have used such occasions to mount attack.\n\nCheckpoints\n\nPolice checkpoints are very frequent on roads throughout the country. Law- enforcement officers and gangs often use aggressive methods to extort bribes. This is a recurring security problem, especially along Nigeria’s borders. If you need assistance, you may contact the High Commission of Canada in Abuja or the Deputy High Commission in Lagos.\n\nCurfews\n\nNigerian authorities impose curfews as a means to restoring order after violence erupts in volatile areas. Curfews are currently in effect for parts of Maiduguri, Adamawa State, Borno State and Yobe State. Curfews and restrictions on the movement of vehicles, can be imposed, amended and lifted at short notice throughout Nigeria.\n\nRoad safety\n\nRoad conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. Drivers often drive at excessive speeds, and accidents are common. Visibility is poor due to lack of adequate lighting.\n\nRental cars are available in Nigeria, but you should avoid them. Major hotels and the customer service centres at the airports in Abuja, Kano and Lagos offer reliable car-hire services complete with drivers.\n\nBe extremely cautious when travelling to and from the airport. All arrangements should be made prior to your arrival in Nigeria.\n\nArrange to arrive at the airport during the day and be met there by reliable contacts\n\nIf transportation is not arranged by hosts or the hotel, hire cars and drivers from reputable security providers\n\nWhen arranging to hire a car and driver, be sure to agree on a price and all details before accepting\n\nCarjacking\n\nIncidents of armed carjacking occur along main roads throughout the country, however they are of particular concern on:\n\nthe roads leading to international and domestic airport\n\non main highways between state capitals\n\nin main cities, including Lagos and Abuja\n\nMany strategies are used to stop cars on the road, such as nails being scattered on the road or individuals, including pregnant women, pretending to be injured.\n\nDo not drive at night, especially outside of major cities, due to the increased likelihood of armed banditry and kidnapping. Criminals often target travellers along major transit routes such as the Abuja - Kaduna highway.\n\nKeep windows closed and doors locked at all times.\n\nFraud\n\nCredit card and ATM fraud occurs. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:\n\npay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others\n\nuse ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business\n\navoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature\n\ncover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN\n\ncheck for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements\n\nOverseas fraud\n\nFuel shortages\n\nThe country experiences regular fuel shortages.\n\nMonitor local media for indicators of the circumstances that precede fuel shortages\n\nEnsure that you have adequate supplies on hand\n\nPublic transportation\n\nYou should not use public transportation due to the risk of petty theft and armed attacks.\n\nTaxis\n\nIt has occurred that thieves hide in the trunk and emerge through the back seat once the taxi is in motion and rob the passenger.\n\nExercise caution when using taxis\n\nIf you must use a taxi, verify that you are the only one in the vehicle\n\nMotorbike taxis, known in Nigeria as “okadas,” are dangerous. In several cities, okada drivers and passengers are required to wear helmets\n\nThere have been several incidents of armed robbery at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos. Some of these cases have resulted in death.\n\nConfirm your transportation arrangements prior to your arrival\n\nBe wary of criminals posing as greeters at the airport\n\nDuring the dry season, the Harmattan wind leads to high amounts of sand and dust in the air. Air travel within Nigeria can sometimes be restricted due to limited visibility. Occasionally, flights must be rerouted from their original destinations.\n\nSwimming\n\nCoastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common. Several drownings occur each year. Follow the instructions and warnings of local authorities.\n\nWater safety abroad\n\nPiracy\n\nPiracy is an ongoing threat in the Niger Delta states. Pirate attacks, armed robbery against ships, ship hijackings, kidnappings and hostage takings occur in coastal waters in the Gulf of Guinea. Mariners should take appropriate precautions. If you are on land, avoid shoreline areas at all times.\n\nInsurgents in speedboats and equipped with high-calibre weapons pose a risk.\n\nLive piracy report - International Maritime Bureau\n\nAir travel\n\nWe do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.\n\nInformation about foreign domestic airlines\n\nHealth\n\nThis section contains information on possible health risks and restrictions regularly found or ongoing in the destination. Follow this advice to lower your risk of becoming ill while travelling. Not all risks are listed below.\n\nConsult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic preferably 6 weeks before you travel to get personalized health advice and recommendations.\n\nRoutine vaccines\n\nBe sure that your routine vaccinations, as per your province or territory, are up-to-date before travelling, regardless of your destination.\n\nSome of these vaccinations include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, varicella (chickenpox), influenza and others.\n\nPre-travel vaccines and medications\n\nYou may be at risk for preventable diseases while travelling in this destination. Talk to a travel health professional about which medications or vaccines may be right for you, based on your destination and itinerary.\n\nYellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements\n\nYellow fever is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito.\n\nTravellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection.\n\nRisk\n\nThere is a risk of yellow fever in this country.\n\nCountry Entry Requirement*\n\nProof of vaccination is required if you are coming from or have transited through an airport of a countrywhere yellow fever occurs.\n\nRecommendation\n\nVaccination is recommended.\n\nContact a designatedYellow Fever Vaccination Centre well in advance of your trip to arrange for vaccination.\n\nDiscuss travel plans, activities, and destinations with a health care professional.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites.\n\nAbout Yellow Fever\n\nYellow Fever Vaccination Centres in Canada\n\n* It is important to note that country entry requirements may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest diplomatic or consular office of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements.\n\nHepatitis A\n\nThere is a risk of hepatitis A in this destination. It is a disease of the liver. People can get hepatitis A if they ingest contaminated food or water, eat foods prepared by an infectious person, or if they have close physical contact (such as oral-anal sex) with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus.\n\nPractise safe food and water precautions and wash your hands often. Vaccination is recommended for all travellers to areas where hepatitis A is present.\n\nMeasles\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease. It can spread quickly from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nAnyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of being infected with it when travelling internationally.\n\nRegardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are fully protected against measles.\n\nMeningococcal disease\n\nThis destination is in the African Meningitis Belt, an area which has the highest rates of meningococcal disease in the world. Meningococcal disease is a serious and sometimes fatal infection.\n\nTravellers who are at higher risk should discuss vaccination with a health care provider. High-risk travellers include those living or working with the local population (e.g., health care workers) or those travelling to crowded areas or taking part in large gatherings.\n\nHepatitis B\n\nHepatitis B is a risk in every destination. It is a viral liver disease that is easily transmitted from one person to another through exposure to blood and body fluids containing the hepatitis B virus. Travellers who may be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) are at higher risk of getting hepatitis B.\n\nHepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all travellers. Prevent hepatitis B infection by practicing safe sex, only using new and sterile drug equipment, and only getting tattoos and piercings in settings that follow public health regulations and standards.\n\nMalaria\n\nMalaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease that is caused by parasites spread through the bites of mosquitoes.\n\nMalaria is a risk to travellers to this destination.\n\nAntimalarial medication is recommended for most travellers to this destination and should be taken as recommended. Consult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic before travelling to discuss your options. It is recommended to do this 6 weeks before travel, however, it is still a good idea any time before leaving.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites at all times:\n\nCover your skin and use an approved insect repellent on uncovered skin.\n\nExclude mosquitoes from your living area with screening and/or closed, well-sealed doors and windows.\n\nUse insecticide-treated bed nets if mosquitoes cannot be excluded from your living area.\n\nWear permethrin-treated clothing.\n\nIf you develop symptoms similar to malaria when you are travelling or up to a year after you return home, see a health care professional immediately. Tell them where you have been travelling or living.\n\nInfluenza\n\nThe best way to protect yourself from seasonal influenza (flu) is to get vaccinated every year. Get the flu shot at least 2 weeks before travelling.\n\nThe flu occurs worldwide.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs from November to April.\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs between April and October.\n\nIn the tropics, there is flu activity year round.\n\nThe flu vaccine available in one hemisphere may only offer partial protection against the flu in the other hemisphere.\n\nThe flu virus spreads from person to person when they cough or sneeze or by touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Clean your hands often and wear a mask if you have a fever or respiratory symptoms.\n\nRabies\n\nIn this destination, rabies is commonly carried by dogs and some wildlife, including bats. Rabies is a deadly disease that spreads to humans primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal. While travelling, take precautions, including keeping your distance from animals (including free-roaming dogs), and closely supervising children.\n\nIf you are bitten or scratched by a dog or other animal while travelling, immediately wash the wound with soap and clean water and see a health care professional. In this destination, rabies treatment may be limited or may not be available, therefore you may need to return to Canada for treatment.\n\nBefore travel, discuss rabies vaccination with a health care professional. It may be recommended for travellers who are at high risk of exposure (e.g., occupational risk such as veterinarians and wildlife workers, children, adventure travellers and spelunkers, and others in close contact with animals).\n\nPolio\n\nPolio (poliomyelitis) is an infectious disease that can be prevented by vaccination. It is caused by poliovirus type 1, 2 or 3. Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus 2 (cVDPV2) is present in this country.\n\nPolio is spread from person to person and through contaminated food and water. Infection with the polio virus can cause paralysis and death in individuals of any age who are not immune.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nBe sure that your polio vaccinations are up to date before travelling. Polio is part of the routine vaccine schedule for children in Canada.\n\nOne booster dose of the polio vaccine is recommended as an adult.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious viral disease. It can spread from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nIt is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series along with any additional recommended doses in Canada before travelling. Evidence shows that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. While vaccination provides better protection against serious illness, you may still be at risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and is at greater risk for severe disease when travelling internationally.\n\nBefore travelling, verify your destination’s COVID-19 vaccination entry/exit requirements. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are adequately protected against COVID-19.\n\nSafe food and water precautions\n\nMany illnesses can be caused by eating food or drinking beverages contaminated by bacteria, parasites, toxins, or viruses, or by swimming or bathing in contaminated water.\n\nLearn more about food and water precautions to take to avoid getting sick by visiting our eat and drink safely abroad page. Remember: Boil it, cook it, peel it, or leave it!\n\nAvoid getting water into your eyes, mouth or nose when swimming or participating in activities in freshwater (streams, canals, lakes), particularly after flooding or heavy rain. Water may look clean but could still be polluted or contaminated.\n\nAvoid inhaling or swallowing water while bathing, showering, or swimming in pools or hot tubs.\n\nCholera\n\nRisk\n\nCholera is a risk in parts of this country. Most travellers are at very low risk.\n\nTo protect against cholera, all travellers should practise safe food and water precautions.\n\nTravellers at higher risk of getting cholera include those:\n\nvisiting, working or living in areas with limited access to safe food, water and proper sanitation\n\nvisiting areas where outbreaks are occurring\n\nVaccination may be recommended for high-risk travellers, and should be discussed with a health care professional.\n\nTravellers' diarrhea\n\nTravellers' diarrhea is the most common illness affecting travellers. It is spread from eating or drinking contaminated food or water.\n\nRisk of developing travellers' diarrhea increases when travelling in regions with poor standards of hygiene and sanitation. Practise safe food and water precautions.\n\nThe most important treatment for travellers' diarrhea is rehydration (drinking lots of fluids). Carry oral rehydration salts when travelling.\n\nTyphoid\n\nTyphoid is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Risk is higher among children, travellers going to rural areas, travellers visiting friends and relatives or those travelling for a long period of time.\n\nTravellers visiting regions with a risk of typhoid, especially those exposed to places with poor sanitation, should speak to a health care professional about vaccination.\n\nSchistosomiasis\n\nThere is a risk of schistosomiasis in this destination. Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by tiny worms (blood flukes) which can be found in freshwater (lakes, rivers, ponds, and wetlands). The worms can break the skin, and their eggs can cause stomach pain, diarrhea, flu-like symptoms, or urinary problems. Schistosomiasis mostly affects underdeveloped and rural communities, particularly agricultural and fishing communities.\n\nMost travellers are at low risk. Travellers should avoid contact with untreated freshwater such as lakes, rivers, and ponds (e.g., swimming, bathing, wading, ingesting). There is no vaccine or medication available to prevent infection.\n\nInsect bite prevention\n\nMany diseases are spread by the bites of infected insects such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas or flies. When travelling to areas where infected insects may be present:\n\nUse insect repellent (bug spray) on exposed skin\n\nCover up with light-coloured, loose clothes made of tightly woven materials such as nylon or polyester\n\nMinimize exposure to insects\n\nUse mosquito netting when sleeping outdoors or in buildings that are not fully enclosed\n\nTo learn more about how you can reduce your risk of infection and disease caused by bites, both at home and abroad, visit our insect bite prevention page.\n\nFind out what types of insects are present where you’re travelling, when they’re most active, and the symptoms of the diseases they spread.\n\nChikungunya\n\nThere is a risk of chikungunya in this country. The level of risk may vary by:\n\nseason\n\nyear\n\nregion\n\nelevation\n\nThe virus that causes chikungunya is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can cause fever and pain in the joints. In some cases, the joint pain can be severe and last for months or years.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites at all times.\n\nLearn more:\n\nInsect bite and pest prevention\n\nChikungunya\n\nDengue\n\nIn this country, risk of dengue is sporadic. It is a viral disease spread to humans by mosquito bites.\n\nDengue can cause flu-like symptoms. In some cases, it can lead to severe dengue, which can be fatal.\n\nThe level of risk of dengue changes seasonally, and varies from year to year. The level of risk also varies between regions in a country and can depend on the elevation in the region.\n\nMosquitoes carrying dengue typically bite during the daytime, particularly around sunrise and sunset.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites. There is no vaccine or medication that protects against dengue fever.\n\nLymphatic filariasis\n\nLymphatic filariasis, also known as elephantiasis, is caused by filariae (tiny worms) spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can cause a range of illnesses. Risk is generally low for most travellers. Protect yourself from mosquito bites. There is no vaccine available for lymphatic filariasis although drug treatments exist.\n\nOnchoceriasis\n\nOnchocerciasis (river blindness) is an eye and skin disease caused by a parasite spread through the bite of an infected female blackfly. Onchocerciasis often leads to blindness if left untreated. Risk is generally low for most travellers. Protect yourself from blackfly bites, which are most common close to fast-flowing rivers and streams. There is no vaccine available for onchocerciasis although drug treatments exist.\n\nZika virus\n\nZika virus is a risk in this country.\n\nZika virus is primarily spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can also be sexually transmitted. Zika virus can cause serious birth defects.\n\nDuring your trip:\n\nPrevent mosquito bites at all times.\n\nUse condoms correctly or avoid sexual contact, particularly if you are pregnant.\n\nIf you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, you should discuss the potential risks of travelling to this destination with your health care provider. You may choose to avoid or postpone travel.\n\nFor more information, see Zika virus: Pregnant or planning a pregnancy.\n\nAnimal precautions\n\nSome infections, such as rabies and influenza, can be shared between humans and animals. Certain types of activities may increase your chance of contact with animals, such as travelling in rural or forested areas, camping, hiking, and visiting wet markets (places where live animals are slaughtered and sold) or caves.\n\nTravellers are cautioned to avoid contact with animals, including dogs, livestock (pigs, cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats, and to avoid eating undercooked wild game.\n\nClosely supervise children, as they are more likely to come in contact with animals.\n\nAvian Influenza\n\nHuman cases of avian influenza have been reported in this destination. Avian influenza is a viral infection that can spread quickly and easily among birds and in rare cases it can infect mammals, including people. The risk is low for most travellers.\n\nAvoid contact with birds, including wild, farm, and backyard birds (alive or dead) and surfaces that may have bird droppings on them. Ensure all poultry dishes, including eggs and wild game, are properly cooked.\n\nTravellers with a higher risk of exposure include those:\n\nvisiting live bird/animal markets or poultry farms\n\nworking with poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, domestic ducks)\n\nhunting, de-feathering, field dressing and butchering wild birds and wild mammals\n\nworking with wild birds for activities such as research, conservation, or rehabilitation\n\nworking with wild mammals, especially those that eat wild birds (e.g., foxes)\n\nAll eligible people are encouraged to get the seasonal influenza shot, which will protect them against human influenza viruses. While the seasonal influenza shot does not prevent infection with avian influenza, it can reduce the chance of getting sick with human and avian influenza viruses at the same time.\n\nMpox\n\nMpox (monkeypox) is a risk in this country. It is a viral disease that can cause serious illness in some circumstances. Risk is generally low for most travellers.\n\nMpox spreads in 3 ways:\n\nfrom animals to humans through direct contact or by eating or preparing undercooked meat of infected animals or coming into contact with an infected animal's body fluids\n\nfrom person to person through close contact, including direct contact with the skin lesions, blood, body fluids, or mucosal surfaces (such as eyes, mouth, throat, genitalia, anus, or rectum) of an infected person\n\nthrough direct contact with contaminated objects such as bedding and towels, or by sharing personal objects used by an infected person\n\nFollow recommended public health measures and avoid contact with animals such as rodents and primates to help prevent getting or spreading the infection.\n\nLassa fever\n\nLassa fever is a risk in this country.\n\nLassa fever is caused by a virus carried by rodents. Humans get sick when they inhale or come into close contact with feces, saliva, or urine of infected rodents or the blood or bodily fluids of infected humans.\n\nLassa virus can be very serious.
