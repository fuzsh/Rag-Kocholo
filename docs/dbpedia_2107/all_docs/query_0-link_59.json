        "text": "Summary\n\nNigeria is mired in a crisis of governance. Eight years since the end of military rule, the country's longest-ever stretch of uninterrupted civilian government, the conduct of many public officials and government institutions is so pervasively marked by violence and corruption as to more resemble criminal activity than democratic governance.\n\nThis report documents what Human Rights Watch considers to be the most important human rights dimensions of this crisis: first, systemic violence openly fomented by politicians and other political elites that undermines the rights of Nigerians to freely choose their leaders and enjoy basic security; second, the corruption that both fuels and rewards Nigeria's violent brand of politics at the expense of the general populace; and third, the impunity enjoyed by those responsible for these abuses that both denies justice to its victims and obstructs reform.\n\nThe four-month-old administration of President Umaru Yar'Adua has the opportunity as well as the responsibility to urgently tackle the systematic corruption and violence within the political system. The challenge is immense-his own party has helped entrench Nigeria's corrupt and violent political culture and President Yar'Adua himself was helped into office within the \"rules\" of the system. But concrete results in this area are necessary if the overall human rights picture in Nigeria is to improve and if the rule of law is to be rehabilitated.\n\nThere are signs that the government may be willing to consider real reform of Nigeria's failed electoral institutions, and the president has made a rhetorical commitment to upholding the rule of law. Such statements are welcome and important. But so long as government officials and other powerful individuals are able to throw their effort into attempting the illegal subversion of those same institutions with impunity, no amount of legislative tinkering will preserve their integrity. It is only determined action to reform key institutions and to tackle impunity that will achieve meaningful change in governance and respect for human rights.\n\nIn 1999, Nigeria's military relinquished political power after dominating the country's post-independence experience and Nigerians hoped for a turn towards democratic governance and respect for human rights. But in the years since then, Nigeria's civilian leaders at all levels have not only proven entirely unaccountable to ordinary Nigerians, but have also routinely abused their basic human rights.\n\nMany of Nigeria's ostensibly elected leaders obtained their positions by demonstrating an ability to use corruption and political violence to prevail in sham elections. In violent and brazenly rigged polls, government officials have denied millions of Nigerians any real voice in selecting their political leaders. In place of democratic competition, struggles for political office have often been waged violently in the streets by gangs of thugs recruited by politicians to help them seize control of power. In recent years, hundreds of Nigerians have lost their lives in the crossfire or as paid proxy fighters for the country's political leaders. At the same time, corruption and mismanagement have led to the waste of record-setting oil revenues that could have been expended to tackle poverty and improve access to basic health and education services.\n\nNationwide polls in 1999 and 2003 were systematically rigged and local government polls in 2004 were plagued by similar abuses. And to the dismay and shock of many Nigerians who had hoped for signs of progress, the country's widely anticipated 2007 polls proved to be another violent farce. Many seasoned observers stated that the 2007 polls were among the worst they had ever witnessed anywhere in the world. Those elections reflected deeply seated patterns of abuse that characterize the day-to-day conduct of many public officials.\n\nMany political figures openly recruit and arm criminal gangs to unleash terror upon their opponents and ordinary members of the public. In GombeState, for example, politicians openly recruited violent cult gangs to intimidate their opponents and rig the voting on Election Day. Encouraged by the prevailing climate of impunity, these gangs unleashed a wave of violence on local communities that included murder, rape, arson and other crimes. In RiversState, criminal gangs hired to rig Nigeria's 2003 elections have since become a law unto themselves, spreading violence and insecurity throughout the restive Niger Delta. Scores of civilians have either been killed or injured during clashes involving those gangs since the 2007 elections alone. No one has been held to account for sponsoring these gangs.\n\nIn some states, powerful and violent political \"godfathers\" have gained control over politicians who are dependent on those sponsors to provide protection and fight their street battles. In return, the godfathers have captured government institutions to serve their own interests. In OyoState, People's Democratic Party (PDP) godfather Lamidi Adedibu recruited gangs that sowed terror on the streets of Ibadan and other cities while fighting to preserve Adedibu's power and influence in the state. In AnambraState, a godfather whose political power may now be on the wane has nonetheless so far gone unpunished for his role in fomenting violence and corruption.\n\nGovernment institutions responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime have failed to stop this tide of violence. Public officials in Nigeria can usually expect to enjoy complete impunity for any crimes they may commit, however egregious. In Anambra State, for example, police officials told Human Rights Watch that they were helpless to act against powerful PDP gubernatorial candidate Andy Uba, even though they knew him to be mobilizing cult gangs in advance of the elections-Uba was seen as too close to then-President Olusegun Obasanjo and therefore untouchable. Former Rivers State Governor Peter Odili, among others, has not so far faced any formal investigation or sanction for his alleged role in sponsoring armed groups that have plunged Rivers into a lasting state of chaos.\n\nEight years after Nigeria's return to civilian government, rampant official corruption and human rights abuse can no longer be dismissed as the lingering after-effects of military rule. It cannot be argued that the problems will inevitably be ironed out in the course of some slow transition towards more democratic governance. Violence, corruption and impunity are not just problems that government has failed to tackle; they are systemic abuses that flow from the heart of the very same government institutions that should be working to combat them.\n\nGovernment at the federal level has seen some limited steps in the direction of reform, but federal officials have tolerated and often encouraged the rampant abuse seen at the state and local level. No real effort has yet been made to hold politicians to account for their open mobilization of violence and corruption to secure political power. Until 2007, limited efforts at investigating and prosecuting corrupt politicians focused on enemies of the Obasanjo administration, undermining if not destroying the credibility of those efforts altogether.\n\nIn addition, federal institutions including the Nigerian police have themselves been at the heart of many of Nigeria's worst abuses, including the widespread rigging of the 2007 polls. While many officials and police personnel conducted themselves in an exemplary manner and even risked their own safety to protect voters' mandates during those elections, others participated in or turned a blind eye to rigging, often with the support or even at the insistence of their superiors. While Nigeria's judiciary has consistently shown independence and impartiality in its handling of politically charged cases, the governmental forces arrayed against the courts-rather than in support of them-sharply limit the judiciary's impact.\n\nNigeria's most serious problems of governance are all underwritten by an all pervading climate of impunity that blocks change. One obvious and important place to start would be for the federal government to enact and aggressively implement the long delayed Freedom of Information Bill, which would make it possible for Nigerians to peel back the veils of secrecy that allow many government officials to conceal the evidence of their misdeeds by denying access to even the most basic government-held information.\n\nThe Yar'Adua government should also safeguard the independence of Nigeria's Electoral Reform Panel.\n\nMeanwhile, the government should launch a transparent and comprehensive inquiry into allegations of corruption, vote-rigging and sponsorship of political violence at all levels of government since the return to civilian rule, beginning with an examination of Nigeria's April 2007 elections. The inquiry should aim to uncover the architects and sponsors of such crimes and it should result in criminal investigations where there is evidence of wrongdoing. The right message could be sent by beginning with the most serious abuses, including those implicating senior government officials and senior members of the security forces.\n\nNigeria's police must make political violence an investigative priority and be given the autonomy and resources for effective and impartial investigations.\n\nThe credibility of vital anti-corruption institutions must be bolstered by new and public commitments to uphold their independence-a commitment that would be best demonstrated by allowing them to pursue some of Nigeria's most corrupt ruling party politicians.\n\nNigeria's international partners also have a role to play. Nigeria's foreign and regional partners should be more forthright in criticizing the very serious shortcomings of Nigeria's democracy that infringe upon the rights of its populace and insist upon meaningful reform. This would include urging the federal government of Nigeria to vigorously investigate and prosecute key politicians and their financial sponsors responsible for political violence during the recent elections, and to institute necessary reforms to end such practices. Nigerian politicians must come to recognize that political violence is not about who wins the next election, but that it has important implications for the rights and well-being of all Nigerians that extend far beyond election day.\n\nThe report is based largely on two four-week Human Rights Watch research missions to Nigeria in early 2007 before, during, and after the April 2007 elections. This included field research in Anambra, Delta, Ekiti, Gombe, Katsina, Lagos, Oyo, and Rivers States and interviews in the capital Abuja. While patterns of abuse in some of those states are among Nigeria's worst, they are not atypical in nature, and the federal government's failure to tackle their underlying causes is common to the whole of Nigeria. Human Rights Watch conducted more than one hundred interviews with federal, state, and local public officials; politicians from ruling and opposition political parties; journalists; civil society workers; religious leaders; lawyers; members of armed gangs and cult groups; political godfathers; and victims of human rights abuse. The names of many interviewees have been withheld to protect them from possible reprisal.\n\nRecommendations\n\nTo the government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria\n\nLaunch a transparent, comprehensive, and impartial inquiry into allegations of corruption, vote-rigging, and sponsorship of political violence during Nigeria's April 2007 elections. The inquiry should aim to uncover the architects and sponsors of such crimes, focusing especially on:\n\nThe role of elected officials and the leadership of federal institutions including Nigeria's police force and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and\n\nAllegations of improper political manipulation of the EFCC, INEC, the police and other government institutions prior to and during the 2007 election campaign.\n\nThis inquiry should be implemented by an independent body created and overseen with the input of stakeholders including civil society groups. Findings should be made public and should result in criminal investigations in which there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing. The inquiry should also result in recommendations to be taken into account by Nigeria's Electoral Reform Panel.\n\nEnact and aggressively implement the Freedom of Information Bill, which would provide Nigerians a tool to compel government institutions to make public important information including basic data concerning expenditures and government policy.\n\nRespect the independence of Nigeria's Electoral Reform Panel, ensure the transparency of its deliberations and conclusions, and publicly explain in detail the reasons for enacting each of the Panel's recommendations, or for not doing so.\n\nEnact a law requiring the president, all members of the National Assembly and all ministers in the federal cabinet to follow and sustain President Yar'Adua's example by issuing and publicizing annual declarations of the total value of all personal assets. Require senior state and local government officials to do the same.\n\nImplement the decisions of Nigeria's electoral tribunals relating to the conduct of the 2007 polls. When those rulings indicate a pervasive level of fraud, initiate investigations with a view to possible criminal prosecution of those responsible.\n\nHelp expedite all election-related litigation by directing INEC, the security services, and other institutions to readily provide all information required for the adjudication of those disputes.\n\nPublicly acknowledge and condemn political interference in the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC)'s investigations of ruling party politicians, which has impeded the EFCC's effectiveness and credibility.\n\nDirect the Nigerian police to immediately investigate serious allegations of corruption, mobilization of political violence, electoral fraud and other crimes prior to the 2007 elections. These should include allegations of criminal activity, reported by Human Rights Watch and others, implicating Alhaji Lamidi Adedibu and Governor Christopher Alao-Akala in Oyo State; Chris and Andy Uba in Anambra State; Peter Odili and Abiye Sekibo in Rivers State; current and former state government officials linked to Yan Kalare gangs in Gombe State; and current and former state government officials linked to PDP youth militias in Katsina state.\n\nPropose an Amendment to the Nigerian Constitution that would rescind the immunity from all criminal prosecution currently enjoyed by sitting governors.\n\nLaunch a transparent, comprehensive and impartial investigation into allegations of police complicity or inaction in the face of human rights abuse and fraud connected to Nigeria's 2007 elections.\n\nTo the Nigerian Police Force\n\nProactively investigate and prosecute as appropriate politicians and party officials suspected of committing criminal offenses during the 2007 election campaigns. Give particular attention to offenses that impact broadly on democratic governance in Nigeria: hiring gangs to intimidate or use violence against the opposition; distributing arms and ammunition; systematically buying votes; and engaging in bribery or other unlawful practices with government institutions such as INEC or the police.\n\nPublicly acknowledge the obligation of law enforcement to combat political violence and corruption, and adopt and enforce a new policy to proactively pursue the sponsors of political violence.\n\nTo the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission\n\nConduct comprehensive and impartial investigations and prosecute former and current elected officials credibly implicated in corruption, including the improper use of government money to subvert the 2007 electoral process. Investigate or publicly articulate the reasons for not investigating all 31 state governors described as \"corrupt\" by EFCC Executive Chairman Nuhu Ribadu before the Nigerian Senate in 2006.\n\nTo Nigeria's foreign partners\n\nExert influence on the federal government of Nigeria to take active steps to vigorously investigate, prosecute, and prevent political violence by politicians and their financial sponsors during the 2007 elections.\n\nDenounce selective investigation and prosecutions by the EFCC and other anti-corruption bodies. Take measures, including the publication of information as appropriate, to pressure the EFCC to take action against public officials implicated in corruption through the EFCC's own investigations.\n\nDeny visas to any Nigerian public official credibly implicated in systematic corruption or other serious criminal offenses.\n\nExplore means of providing greater political and material support to improve the independence and capacity of the Nigerian judiciary.\n\nExplore means of increasing support to Nigerian civil society organizations working to promote transparency, accountability, and respect for human rights in the conduct of government institutions.\n\nHistorical Background and Context\n\nNigeria is an inherently difficult country to govern. The country is an unlikely amalgam of peoples and cultures that were shoehorned into one territory by their British colonial rulers largely for the sake of administrative convenience.[1]Nigeria is home to more than 250 separate ethnic groups, many of which either had no meaningful relationships with one another or long histories of mutual antagonism prior to the advent of colonialism.[2] The country is also divided in roughly equal proportion between its two major religions-Islam and Christianity-and that religious divide often overlaps with some of Nigeria's most important ethnic and cultural boundaries.[3]\n\nMuch of Nigeria's political history has revolved around the need to devise institutions capable of governing the country's diverse population in an inclusive and equitable manner. All of Nigeria's post-independence governments have, at least in principle, adhered to some variation of Nigeria's unique and complicated conception of federalism. That model of governance enjoys wide legitimacy as the best and most inclusive possible mode of governance for the country.[4] But unfortunately, abusive, corrupt, and unaccountable Nigerian political leaders have undercut serious efforts to construct stable institutions to govern the country, solidify the rule of law, and promote respect for human rights.\n\nHistorical Overview: Dictatorship and Rigged Elections\n\nNigeria's post-independence history had been overshadowed by the depredations of a series of corrupt, abusive, and unaccountable governments. The basic contours of that history illuminate the origin of the problems described in this report.\n\nBetween independence in 1960 and 1999, Nigeria produced only two elected governments and both were overthrown in military coups before completing a second term in office. All told, Nigeria's military ruled the country for nearly 30 of its first 40 years of independence.[5]\n\nNigeria's first post-independence government, led by Prime Minister Tafawa Balewa, organized general and regional elections in 1964 and 1965. The polls returned the government to a second term in office but were characterized by widespread complaints of fraud, violence and intimidation.[6] Protest in the wake of the regional elections, which in some areas had degenerated into a violent exercise in competitive rigging, led to widespread violence and intercommunal rioting that claimed more than 200 lives.[7]\n\nIn January 1966 a group of five army majors planned and executed Nigeria's first attempted coup d'etat, seizing upon the lingering post-election crisis, corruption, and other alleged government failings as their justification. Their coup failed and the lead plotters were arrested, but the prime minister and other key government figures were murdered in the attempt.[8] General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi, an ethnic Igbo, was soon \"invited\" by the tattered remains of Nigeria's civilian government to step into the resulting power vacuum and became Nigeria's first military head of state.\n\nMany Nigerians initially welcomed the military's 1966 takeover, hoping it would bring law and order along with more honest and effective government.[9] The military retained power from 1966 until 1979 but this was not a period of stability or peace. Ironsi was murdered in a successful coup after less than seven months in office by a group of northern military officers. His death was followed by ethnic rioting across Nigeria that helped precipitate Nigeria's horrific Biafran civil war.[10]\n\nAfter the civil war ended in 1970, Nigeria's ruling military continued to be wracked with violent power struggles. Aside from Ironsi's murder the country saw one other head of state ousted in a coup and a third murdered in an attempted coup before the discredited military returned power to civilian hands in 1979.[11] The head of state who organized that transition was General Olusegun Obasanjo, who would return to power as a civilian leader twenty years later, in 1999.\n\nThe civilian government under President Shehu Shagari that was elected to office in 1979 was in place for only four years. Shagari's administration, which initially had the blessing of Nigeria's military establishment, was blamed for widespread corruption at both the federal and state levels, deepening levels of poverty and internecine political warfare that led ultimately to the electoral debacle of 1983. The elections organized that year were massively rigged in favor of Shagari and his National Party of Nigeria. The country's Federal Election Commission and the security forces were widely accused of actively colluding to rig the elections, and all parties deployed hired thugs to intimidate their opponents across the country. A nationwide outcry greeted the results and the government proved unable to quell the political chaos that ensued.[12]\n\nFour months after the 1983 elections, the military struck again, overthrowing Shagari's government and retaking control of the country under the leadership of General Muhammadu Buhari. As in 1966, the coup-plotters defended their actions by pointing to the chaotic and illegitimate 1983 elections along with massive corruption and the government's failure to meet its basic responsibilities towards ordinary Nigerians.[13]Nigeria's military then clenched power for sixteen years, until May 1999.\n\nFrom 1985 until 1998 Nigeria was governed by two military dictators, Generals Ibrahim Babangida and Sani Abacha.[14] This period proved disastrous for Nigeria, as Babangida and Abacha helped to deepen and entrench patterns of corruption and human rights abuse from which the country has since made almost no progress in escaping. Babangida was widely accused of institutionalizing corruption as a tool of political control and as much as US$12.2 billion in oil revenues simply \"disappeared\" under his watch.[15] Abacha alone is believed to have personally stolen between $1 and $3 billion while in office.[16] Both subjected their critics to abuses including intimidation, arbitrary detention, and, allegedly, murder.[17]\n\nBabangida organized elections in 1993 that were slated to pass power back into civilian hands. Today many Nigerians still describe those polls as the most free and fair in Nigerian history and as proof of the government's capacity to hold credible elections should it choose to do so. However, Babangida annulled the results of the presidential poll and imprisoned winning candidate Moshood Abiola, who ultimately died behind bars.[18]\n\nNigeria did not return to elected civilian rule until after General Abacha died in office in 1998. By then, the excesses of the Abacha and Babangida years had thoroughly discredited the military's claim on power and led to popular and international pressure for a return to civilian rule that had become impossible to resist. Abacha's successor, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, soon organized elections that ushered the military out of power and installed retired General Olusegun Obasanjo as the first president of Nigeria's FourthRepublic in May 1999.\n\nA Flawed Transition\n\nSince 1999, Nigeria's military has kept to its barracks. In that sense, the country's transition to civilian rule has been successful. But Nigeria's civilian government has failed to realize hopes that an end to military rule would lead to democratic governance, progress in combating poverty and corruption, and respect for human rights on the part of those in power.\n\nSince the end of military rule, Nigeria has only added to its history of fraudulent and violent elections. The 1999 elections that brought President Olusegun Obasanjo to power were marred by such widespread fraud that observers from the US-based CarterCenter concluded that \"it is not possible for us to make an accurate judgment about the outcome of the presidential election.\"[19]\n\nNigeria's next round of general elections, in 2003, were widely seen as a test of Nigeria's progress towards more open and accountable governance after four years of civilian rule under Obasanjo. The polls were an abject failure. The 2003 elections were more pervasively and openly rigged than the flawed 1999 polls, and far more bloody. More than 100 people died in the two weeks surrounding the voting itself, many in political clashes spawned by politicians' efforts to employ and arm criminal gangs to defend their interests and attack their opponents.[20]\n\nElections for Nigeria's 774 local government councils were held in 2004 and followed much the same pattern of violence, intimidation and fraud that characterized the 2003 general elections. Nigeria's Transition Monitoring Group observed those polls and concluded that \"It is doubtful whetherthe elections can in any way be considered to be reflective of the will of the people.\"[21]\n\nNigeria's 2007 Milestone\n\nNigeria's April 2007 elections were widely regarded as a crucial barometer of the federal government's commitment to some meaningful notion of democratic reform. But the polls marked a dramatic step backwards, even measured against the dismal standard set by the 2003 election.\n\nElected officials, alongside the very government agencies charged with ensuring the credibility of the polls, reduced the elections to a violent and fraud-riddled farce. Across much of the country armed gangs in the employ of politicians raided polling stations and carried off ballot boxes. Electoral officials reported massive turnout figures in areas where no voting took place at all. In many areas ballot boxes were openly stuffed or results fabricated out of thin air.[22] The final results bore little resemblance to the realities reported by all credible election observers, domestic and foreign, but the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) reported a landslide victory for the ruling PDP.[23]\n\nForeign observers and Nigerian civil society groups were unusually blunt in their criticism of the polls, with many Nigerian activists labeling them the worst in Nigerian history.[24] Several seasoned foreign observers said that the 2007 poll ranked among the worst conducted anywhere in the world in recent times.[25] The Head of the European Union Election Observation Mission (EUEOM) said that, \"The whole thing was not at all living up to the hopes of the Nigerian people, chaotic, and I would say it left them behind, demoralized.\"[26] The EUEOM's final report stated that \"Given the lack of transparency and evidence of fraud, there can be no confidence in the results of these elections.\"[27] The US-based National Democratic Institute (NDI) said in its post-election statement that the electoral process \"failed the Nigerian people.\"[28]\n\nNigeria's failed 2007 polls cast a harsh and very public light on patterns of violence, corruption and outright criminality that have come to characterize Nigeria's political system-and on the extent to which officials and institutions at all levels of government accept, encourage and participate in those abuses.\n\nPolitical Violence\n\n\"My duty was to send you to hell.\"\n\n-Former cult member recruited by the PDP in RiversState to prevent people from voting during the 2003 elections.[29]\n\nPolitical violence has become a central part of political competition across much of Nigeria and it takes many forms-from assassinations to armed clashes between gangs employed by rival politicians. This violence is most often carried out by gangs whose members are openly recruited and paid by politicians and party leaders to attack their sponsors' rivals, intimidate members of the public, rig elections, and protect their patrons from similar attacks.\n\nAlongside the gangs themselves, the individuals most responsible for the abuses they commit are politicians and party officials-from all parties-who sponsor and at times openly participate in acts of violence. The architects, sponsors, and perpetrators of this violence generally enjoy complete impunity because of both the powers of intimidation they wield and the tacit acceptance of their conduct by police and government officials.\n\nA spokesman for Anambra State Governor Peter Obi told Human Rights Watch, \"If you are a member of the PDP and I belong to APGA [the All Progressives Grand Alliance opposition party] we see ourselves more or less like enemies. This is carried too far and results in thuggery, assassination and arson.\"[30]\n\nThe Scale of Nigeria's Violence Epidemic\n\nPolitical violence is part and parcel of a broader epidemic of violence that has devastated the lives of tens of thousands of Nigerians since the country's return to civilian rule in 1999.[31] According to a forthcoming survey of media and other sources undertaken by Human Rights Watch and Johns Hopkins' School for Advanced International Studies, more than 11,000 Nigerians lost their lives in clashes along political, ethnic, religious, and other lines between the handover of power to the Obasanjo government and the end of 2006.[32]Nigeria's National Commission for Refugees has estimated that more than three million Nigerians were internally displaced by this strife.[33]\n\nThis devastation occurred in at least 481 separate incidents that varied considerably in character and scale.[34] In the most notorious cases, outbreaks of ethnic or religious violence claimed hundreds of lives in just a few short days-Human Rights Watch documented several of these large-scale clashes in detail.[35] At the same time, smaller-scale clashes have been so frequent as to reflect a regular feature of Nigeria's political landscape. All told, between May 1999 and December 2006 the survey recorded incidents of intercommunal and political violence at the staggering rate of one separate incident every five days.[36]\n\nSince 1999 Nigeria has also seen hundreds of intercommunal clashes that were not overtly political in nature dividing Nigerians against one another along ethnic, religious, or other intercommunal lines.[37] But in many of the worst cases it was widely believed that ethnic and religious violence resulted at least partly from the efforts of politicians and other elites to manipulate intercommunal tensions for their own political gain. President Obasanjo himself frequently advanced this belief during his tenure as president, stating on one occasion that many participants in ethnic and religious violence were in effect \"foot-soldiers to the designs and machinations of power seekers.\"[38]\n\nEven non-political violence is fueled by the same patterns of impunity that fuel violence in the political arena.[39] No one has been held to account for their role in orchestrating any of Nigeria's bloodiest episodes of intercommunal violence despite strident government promises of investigation and prosecution. That pattern of impunity is even more pronounced in the case of smaller-scale clashes, which generally has not even triggered any serious attempt at discovering or prosecuting those responsible.[40]\n\nThe Human Rights Impact of Political Violence\n\nThe pervasive role of violence in Nigerian politics has a devastating human rights impact on ordinary Nigerians. As discussed above, thousands of Nigerians have been deprived of their very right to life or have been subjected to physical assaults because of the violent nature of political competition in Nigeria. But casualty estimates, considered alone, actually understate the scale of the human rights impact of political violence in Nigeria. Violence also discourages and prevents political participation and plays a central role in denying ordinary Nigerians a say in choosing their \"elected\" leaders.\n\nThe 2007 Elections\n\nAt no point was the human rights impact of Nigeria's violence epidemic so stark as during the country's April 2007 elections. Human Rights Watch estimates that a minimum of 300 Nigerians were killed in violence linked to the 2007 elections; some credible estimates range considerably higher.[41] That death toll was higher than the reported figures from the violent 2003 elections, which saw more than 100 Nigerians killed during the weeks surrounding the voting exercise alone.[42] The violence that accompanied the 2007 polls was widespread and openly organized on such a scale as to lay bare deeper patterns of corruption and abuse in politics to an unusual degree.\n\nThe run-up to the elections saw political assassinations, bombings, and deadly clashes between rival gangs-organized by politicians and parties-that claimed at least one hundred lives. Human Rights Watch documented the patterns of these killings during the pre-election period.[43] European Union election observers subsequently estimated that some 200 people died in political violence during the two weeks surrounding the voting on April 14 and April 21.[44] Many more were injured.\n\nDuring the 2007 elections pervasive violence discouraged many Nigerians from coming out to vote, and voter turnout was very low across the country.[45] Prior to the elections Human Rights Watch interviewed many would-be voters who said that they intended to stay home rather than cast their votes. Several explained this by stating simply, \"I don't want to die.\"[46] One retiree in the town of Oye Ekiti told Human Rights Watch that \"the elderly people are scared and so are the women. They can go a step further by instructing their children, 'please keep away from that polling booth-I don't want you to die now.'\"[47]\n\nIn a town in OyoState, Human Rights Watch interviewed one opposition All Nigerian Peoples Party (ANPP) supporter whose home was besieged by a large group of pro-PDP thugs she believed to be drunk one evening shortly before the elections. The youths threw bottles at her home, fired several shots with locally made weapons that left bullets lodged in the walls, and pounded on the windows and doors demanding that she let them in. Her neighbors said that after this incident many of them decided not to come out to vote.[48]\n\nMany voters who did come out to vote faced precisely the sort of violence that led others to stay at home. Human Rights Watch witnessed gangs roaming the streets, attacking or intimidating voters, in all of the four states where it monitored the elections. In Katsina, Gombe and RiversStates, for example, groups of thugs launched attacks on polling stations throughout each state, chasing off voters and carting away ballot boxes and ballot papers. Similar scenes were reported across the country by election observers and others.[49]\n\nIn some cases voters, police officers, and electoral officials went to great lengths to try and protect the process from such violent assaults, but generally with little success. At one polling station in Mashi town in KatsinaState, Human Rights Watch observed a queue of voters wait patiently in line even as police officers attempted to fight off a gang of young men armed with sticks less than 50 meters away. One of the men in line lamented to Human Rights Watch that the gang had \"come to unleash violence. They have come to steal our votes,\"[50] but held his place in line along with most others. The thugs eventually made off with all of the ballot papers for the National Assembly elections during a successful assault on the polling booth.[51]\n\nIn the town of Iseyin in OyoState, Human Rights Watch interviewed several supporters of the opposition Action Congress (AC) party who said they had been beaten up by bands of young men in the employ of the PDP when they tried to intervene to stop ballot-box stuffing near their homes. One man who tried to assist a friend who was being beaten by a gang was himself set upon and likewise abused. \"I had to run and they pursued me,\" he said. \"At one corner, one of them kicked my leg and I fell down. After I fell down they continued to kick me and slap me.\" He filed a police report that identified some of his attackers but the police took no action on the complaint.[52]\n\nAt one polling unit in Katsina town, Human Rights Watch interviewed voters who watched as a policeman was badly beaten with his own baton after he tried to fend off four young men who invaded the polling station and ultimately stole its ballot box.[53] And one election observer in Gokana local government in RiversState told Human Rights Watch that the Presiding Officer at her polling station was kidnapped by armed men when he refused to surrender the ballot box to them. \"They took the materials and then they put him in the boot [trunk] as well,\" she said. \"People were crying but they said, 'No, he talks to us like that, now we will show him pepper!'\"[54] She and some local residents ran alongside the car begging for the young man's release as he screamed in terror from inside the boot, but to no avail.[55]\n\nLosing Control of Violence\n\nViolence unleashed by politicians and their sponsors during elections and other periods of political contestation does not simply fade away once the political battles have been decided. In many cases violence fomented for the purpose of winning elections has taken on a life and logic of its own and continued to generate widespread human rights abuses over the long term. Several Nigerian states have been plagued by enduring violence after politicians either abandon or lose control over the gangs they initially employed. As former Oyo State Governor Victor Olunloyo put it: \"My attitude towards them [political thugs] is that they are like rabid dogs. They are prepared to bite their owner and their owners cannot be confident or sure of keeping them on a leash.\"[56]\n\nIn GombeState, Human Rights Watch interviewed victims and local leaders desperate to find a way to end a reign of terror imposed by gangs employed by both the PDP and opposition parties alike since the 2003 elections. In the years after 2003 those gangs proved uncontrollable. They subjected local residents to abuses including armed robbery, extortion on the roads, rape, and murder. And in RiversState, armed groups who openly acknowledge that they were sponsored by the PDP to rig the 2003 elections have since spiraled out of all control and have contributed to the spread of violence, insecurity, and human rights abuse across the entire oil-producing Niger Delta today. The situations in Gombe and RiversStates are discussed in detail as case studies below.\n\nPoliticians, Cults and Gangs\n\nPolitical violence in Nigeria is most often carried out by gangs whose members are openly recruited, financed and sometimes armed by public officials, politicians and party officials or their representatives. These gangs, comprised primarily of unemployed young men are mobilized to attack their sponsors' rivals, intimidate members of the public, rig elections and protect their patrons from similar attacks. Often, sponsors of political violence turn time and again to the same criminal gangs, violent campus-based \"cults\" and other sources to recruit agents of political violence. Those recruited are paid, often very little, and sometimes armed for the sole purpose of carrying out violent abuses on behalf of their political sponsors.\n\nCults and Criminal Gangs\n\nNigeria's notorious \"cult\" organizations are a particular variety of criminal gang that began as benign campus fraternities, the first of which emerged in 1952 when a group of University of Ibadan students, including future Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka, organized a fraternity called the Pyrates Confraternity. They have since proliferated and evolved into violent gangs that often operate both on and off campus, with one foot each in the criminal and political spheres. Across much of Nigeria and especially in the south, \"cult\" gangs are the most widely feared criminal enterprises in the country. The power and prevalence of these groups has grown steadily over the decades and especially since 1999. Many groups maintain ties to powerful politicians, some of whom themselves have associations with cult organizations dating back to their days at university.[57] This is so even though some Nigerian states have passed laws expressly outlawing many cult groups.\n\nCult groups in Nigeria today are numerous and include groups such as the Buccaneers, the Black Axe, the Greenlanders, the Klansmen Konfraternity, and the Supreme Vikings Confraternity (or Vikings) along with many others.[58] These organizations sow terror among the student populations of many university campuses in Nigeria, forcibly recruiting new members and waging battles between one another that have included the assassination of rival cult members and the killing of innocent bystanders.[59]\n\nReliable statistics about the on-campus human toll of Nigeria's cult violence epidemic do not exist, but former Minister of Education Obiageli Ezekwesili estimated that some 200 students and teachers lost their lives to cult-related violence between 1996 and 2005.[60] Cult-related clashes on university campuses continue to occur regularly, especially in southern Nigeria.[61] Cult groups have also been implicated in widespread other abuses including extortion, rape and violent assaults.[62]\n\nThe reach of many cults has spread far beyond university campuses, with many groups involved in drug trafficking, armed robbery, extortion, oil bunkering, and various forms of street crime.[63] Alongside all of this, many politicians mobilize local cult members as the foot soldiers of political violence. Some politicians are themselves members of cult organizations.[64]\n\nHuman Rights Watch interviewed more than 20 current and former members of cult groups and ordinary criminal gangs not associated with cult organizations who had been recruited by PDP politicians either during the 2003 elections or in the run-up to the 2007 polls in Oyo, Anambra and RiversStates. Many spoke candidly about being paid to target the political opponents of their sponsors or to attack and intimidate ordinary voters.\n\nMany of the interviewed cult and gang members described their work in graphic terms. One former cult member told Human Rights Watch that his group was recruited by the PDP in RiversState to prevent people from voting during the 2003 elections. \"My duty was to send you to hell,\"[65] he said. Members of one Ibadan-based gang acknowledged having ties to OyoState political godfather Lamidi Adedibu and said that they had been paid to carry out political assassinations.[66] And just ahead of the 2007 elections, one member of the Buccaneers cult in Anambra State told Human Rights Watch matter-of-factly that, \"If there is a need to cause commotion during the election, they [local politicians] will call us.\"[67]\n\nIn some cases, cult and gang members claimed that they merely provided \"security\" for electoral campaigns, but described that work as involving violent clashes with members of communities along the campaign trail. Two members of the Vikings cult group in AnambraState, for example, told Human Rights Watch that during the PDP primaries in late 2006 they and many other Vikings members from the University of Nnamdi Azikwe campus in Awka had been recruited by PDP aspirants in several southeastern states to accompany them on the campaign trail:\n\nIn some areas we played like a security roleWe went to other states, like Enugu-we went there for security for the PDP. Also in EbonyiYou go to some places to do voting and the local people, they don't understand anything, they just start fighting youOne community burned a vehicle, maybe because they did not like the candidate, they said he had done nothing for them. So we provide security for the PDP in those places.[68]\n\nA few of the cult and gang members interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that they had been paid only to attend rallies in support of their patron candidates. But they admitted that they routinely attended such events armed and prepared to fight. One gang member in Ibadan told Human Rights Watch during the 2007 election campaign that \"I go to PDP rallies every day to get a little something. It's survival, it's an investmentto go to rallies we prepare with machetes, clubs and AK-47s. You never know what can happen.\"[69]\n\nOther Perpetrators of Political Violence\n\nWhile cults and other criminal gangs are often at the front lines of political clashes in Nigeria, they do not by any means have a monopoly on the market for hired thugs. In some states, politicians have drawn upon the membership of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) for paid thugs. NURTW theoretically represents the collective interests of commercial drivers and other workers tied to the industry but some of its chapters have been largely converted into reservoirs of thugs for local politicians.\n\nIn EkitiState, Human Rights Watch interviewed a group of NURTW members days ahead of the 2007 elections. They acknowledged that they had been hired by a PDP politician from their community to attack and chase away would-be voters in order to stuff ballot boxes and rig the 2003 elections but said they would not do so again in 2007. \"We need to show people that we are not thugs,\" one of them told Human Rights Watch. \"We are not ready to do it. But there is a likelihood that they [politicians] will approach us. It is left for us not to accept their offer.\"[70] But in OyoState, NURTW members have been at the forefront of a bloody and protracted period of election-related violence that continued well-past the closing of the polls. The central role of NURTW in political violence in Oyo is discussed in the OyoState case study below.[71]\n\nIn some cases the link between government officials and their hired thugs is formalized to some degree. In Katsina for instance, the state government under current president Umaru Yar'Adua maintained several thousand \"PDP Youth\" on a monthly stipend that was paid with state government money. Credible sources maintain that many of those youth were allegedly involved in violence linked to the 2007 elections.[72] The links between the state government and the PDP youth organization in Katsina are discussed in greater depth below.[73]\n\nIn some cases members of the police have themselves been implicated in acts of political violence. One state's commissioner of police acknowledged to Human Rights Watch that \"[t]here are even policemen and soldiers who can be used by people in power to do what thugs would normally do.\"[74] One man from Oyo State, for example, told Human Rights Watch that at a voting collation center on election day in April, a PDP candidate accompanied by several mobile police officers arrived on the scene, fired into the air to scare off INEC officials and civilian bystanders, and then ordered the police officers to beat those who had not run away. \"I fell down,\" he said, \"and the MOPOL [mobile police] met me on the ground and started beating me with their gun butts.\" He was taken to the hospital and at the time of his interview with Human Rights Watch days later, his legs were bandaged and bruised. \"My leg was not broken but the pain was so much I thought it was broken,\" he said.[75]\n\nJustifying and Taking Violence for Granted\n\nMany Nigerian politicians see violence-both as an offensive weapon and as a component of personal security-as a necessary part of any political campaign. As the traditional ruler of Awka town in AnambraState put it in an interview with Human Rights Watch, \"Here [in Anambra] elections are connected to how much money you have put into your ability to intimidate others.\"[76]\n\nSome politicians argue that they must maintain some capacity to unleash violence as a measure of self-defense. Senator Ben Obi-who ran as the opposition Action Congress' Vice-Presidential candidate in the 2007 elections-explained to Human Rights Watch during an interview at his home in Awka during the campaign that:\n\nEarlier I had 20 boys here to see me. If anyone tries to attack me my boys will unleash terrorI help them to secure a little patronage from government or to start small businessesIt is not possible to have a campaign without your boys. If you are around, they too must be around.[77]\n\nIn practice the line between self-defense and violent aggression is blurred at best. Senator Obi, for example, told Human Rights Watch that during an unsuccessful attempt to strip him of the Senate seat to which he was elected in 2003, he told one of the alleged architects of the move against him that \"If you come to Awka you will not leave here alive. Because I will not hold my boys back. They would skin him alive.\"[78]\n\nIn other cases politicians explain their use of political violence by pointing out the ineffectual or partisan response of law-enforcement agencies to violence that targets them. In January 2007, for example, a group of thugs linked to a powerful Oyo state godfather figures attacked and nearly killed former Senator Lekan Balogun on the steps of the Oyo State House of Assembly.[79] One month later, he complained to Human Rights Watch that the police had held no one to account even though he could identify his assailants and said that:\n\nI will fight back. If the law will not address the issue I will fight back using the same means...If the law fails to address the issue I would mobilize thugs too. There are boys that I know. I don't like them, but it's not that anybody has a monopoly on violence. Anybody can do it. Students are waiting to be mobilized.[80]\n\nThe situation in OyoState is discussed in detail as a case study in a later section of this report.\n\nBox 1: Drawn into Violence in Ekiti\n\nDr. Kayode Fayemi is a prominent and widely respected activist who ran for the governorship of EkitiState in southwestern Nigeria on the platform of the opposition Action Congress. Dr. Fayemi's campaign elicited a great deal of excitement among Nigerian civil society because of his distinguished record as a campaigner against government abuses under military rule and since 1999.\n\nSeveral days before the April 14 elections Human Rights Watch interviewed Dr. Fayemi in Ado Ekiti. He alleged that his opponent from the ruling PDP, Segun Oni, was recruiting cultists and other thugs to rig the elections and terrorize his supporters on election day. Asked how he would respond to that threat, Fayemi replied:\n\nThere is no question we can't rely on above-the-board tactics alone. I know this is not a tea-party and there are things I will have to do that are not acceptable to my core principles. Or things that others in the AC will do that are beyond my control-for me this may just be a competition but for some of them it is a life-or-death matter.[81]\n\nAsked to elaborate, Dr. Fayemi denied that he would condone the use of violence. But many of the AC members working on the elections clearly considered that stand impractical. One AC candidate who was running for Ekiti's State House of Assembly frankly admitted to Human Rights Watch that he had recruited his own boys as a \"counterbalance\" to the alleged efforts of his PDP rival to intimidate him and his supporters.[82] And one high profile supporter of Dr. Fayemi in Ekiti told Human Rights Watch: \"It's fire for fire. We are prepared to neutralize their efforts to rig the elections. If they are preparing to rig violently, we will react violently.\"[83]\n\nElection day in Ekiti reportedly saw gangs of PDP thugs hijacking ballot boxes, and some of Dr. Fayemi's own supporters also engaged openly in violent tactics. One journalist who witnessed the elections in Ekiti told Human Rights Watch that \"Fayemi's thugs were out as well. We saw them dragging people out of their cars and beating the shit out of them.\"[84] Most of the violence and ballot box snatching reported by observers was carried out by Fayemi's opponents in the PDP, who were declared winners of the election amid widespread evidence of intimidation and vote rigging.[85] Fayemi challenged the results of the election before the Election Tribunal.\n\nCorruption, Godfatherism and the Funding of Political Violence\n\n\"Most of these politicians are linked to cult groups-they finance them, they maintain them, they sustain them. And all that is out of the use of government funds.\"\n\n-Academic and former RiversState opposition candidate, Port Harcourt, August 15, 2007\n\nDespite record-setting government revenues in recent years, corruption and mismanagement remain a major cause of Nigeria's failure to make meaningful progress in improving the lot of ordinary Nigerians. These financial factors are closely entwined with the rampant political violence in Nigeria. Public revenues are not only stolen and misused, but often pay for the services and weapons behind the political violence. Because violence and corruption make political competition a very expensive endeavor in Nigeria, many politicians are far more accountable to powerful and violent political godfathers who sponsor them than they are to their constituents.\n\nCorruption and Poverty in Nigeria\n\nCorruption pervades all levels of government in Nigeria. In 2006 the head of Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Nuhu Ribadu, estimated that Nigeria lost some US$380 billion to corruption between independence in 1960 and the end of military rule in 1999.[87]Nigeria's corruption epidemic has continued since then. Exact figures are impossible to come by, but some western diplomats estimate that Nigeria lost a minimum average of $4 billion to $8 billion per year to corruption over the eight years of the Obasanjo administration.[88] That figure would equal between 4.25% and 9.5% of Nigeria's total GDP in 2006.To put those numbers in perspective, a loss of 9.5% of the United States' GDP to corruption in 2006 would have translated into $1.25 trillion in stolen funds or $222 billion (GBP 108.6 billion[89]) in the case of the United Kingdom's economy.[90]\n\nHuman Rights Watch has documented the human rights impact of systemic corruption and mismanagement in RiversState-Nigeria's largest oil producer and the wealthiest state in the nation.[91] In Rivers the state and local governments have failed to make meaningful improvements in the state's badly dilapidated primary health and education sectors in recent years despite per capita spending far in excess of many West African countries at the state level alone.[92] Instead, an unprecedented influx of revenue into state and local government coffers has been squandered or stolen. At the same time, the rising financial stakes have helped push struggles over political office to become more violent.[93] The 2007 elections in Rivers surpassed even the dismal nationwide norm in their brazen rigging by government officials.[94]\n\nThe situation in Rivers is by no means unique. While Nigeria's government earned an estimated $223 billion during the eight years of the Obasanjo administration alone, between 50 and 90 million Nigerians live on less than one US dollar a day and per capita income stands at one-third the level it had reached in 1980. Nigeria also has some of the worst socio-economic indicators in the world.[95] The link between violence and corruption that has become so vivid in RiversState is now reflected throughout many parts of Nigeria.\n\nNigeria's Political Godfathers\n\nNot all aspirants to political office in Nigeria can raise on their own the substantial resources usually necessary to compete in the country's violent and corrupt political system-especially if they do not enjoy control over public resources to begin with. As a result, in many parts of Nigeria, successful candidates are often those who are \"sponsored\" by wealthy and powerful individuals known in Nigerian parlance as political godfathers.[96]\n\nThese godfathers are not mere financiers of political campaigns. Rather they are individuals whose power stems not just from wealth but from their ability to deploy violence and corruption to manipulate national, state or local political systems in support of the politicians they sponsor. In return, they demand a substantial degree of control over the governments they help bring into being-not in order to shape government policy, but to exact direct financial \"returns\" in the form of government resources stolen by their protgs or lucrative government contracts awarded to them as further opportunities for graft. Godfathers also require their sponsored politicians to use government institutions to generate patronage for other protgs.\n\nFormerOyoState governor Victor Olunloyo explained the relationship between politicians and their \"godfathers\" this way:\n\nMoney flows up and downthese honorable members [of the Oyo State House of Assembly], during the election period, they want the patronage of the puppeteer. Afterwards money will flow in the opposite direction-back from the puppet to the puppeteer.[97]\n\nIn some cases godfathers are themselves public officials, using their access to public funds to sponsor lower-level officials.[98]\n\nGodfatherism is both a symptom and a cause of the violence and corruption that together permeate the political process in Nigeria. Public officials who owe their position to the efforts of a political godfather incur a debt that they are expected to repay without end throughout their tenure in office. Godfathers are only relevant because politicians are able to deploy violence and corruption with impunity to compete for office in contests that often effectively, and sometimes actually, exclude Nigeria's voters altogether. But their activities also help to reinforce the central role of violence and corruption in politics by making it even more difficult to win elected office without resorting to the illegal tactics they represent. Nigeria's godfatherism phenomenon is not unique to the ruling PDP, but as with many of the other abuses described in this report it is seen most often in the conduct of PDP officials as both a cause and a result of the party's success in maintaining itself in power.\n\nThis report provides detailed accounts of human rights abuses fueled by the activities of two of Nigeria's best-known political godfathers. The OyoState case study below describes the power wielded by Chief Lamidi Adedibu. Adedibu, a dominant figure in the PDP in Oyo, has been instrumental in preventing free and fair elections and placing violence and corruption at the heart of politics in his state. The AnambraState case study discusses another of Nigeria's iconic political godfathers, Chris Uba, who is a member of the PDP's national Board of Trustees.\n\nCorruption and the Funding of Political Violence\n\nThere is a direct relationship between corruption and political violence-many public officials use stolen public revenues to pay for political violence in support of their ambitions. As one Niger Delta academic who maintains that his 2003 Senate campaign was derailed by the violent efforts of the PDP to intimidate voters and rig the vote told Human Rights Watch, \"Most of these politicians are linked to cult groups-they finance them, they maintain them, they sustain them. And all of this is out of the use of government funds.\"[99] In GombeState, a leading lawyer and former minister in the federal government published allegations in the national press that the state government was funding the activities of \"Kalare\" thugs using public money.[100]\n\nThe Price of Violence\n\nThe money that is poured into mobilizing political violence in Nigeria is substantial, even if the amounts that filter down to low level thugs sometimes are not. As one civil society leader in KatsinaState explained to Human Rights Watch, \"They [local politicians] will just come and gather the youth to cause mayhem-not even for N5000 ($38), just N1000 or 500. To someone who is doing nothing, N50 (38 cents) can be something to him.\"[101] Or as one former cult member in Port Harcourt put it: \"The youth have no money-if you show them the bag of money or the bag of guns, they will work for you.\"[102]\n\nThe amounts paid to violent actors become less trivial higher up in the chain of command or for more important operations. One engineering graduate student in Anambra State told Human Rights Watch that he had been paid N25,000 ($190) by the campaign office of PDP gubernatorial candidate Andy Uba to help organize thugs that chased elected delegates away from polling areas on the day of the PDP gubernatorial primaries in late 2006. He said that he was bused to the voting centers along with at least two to three busloads full of other cult and gang members who received the same payment. As of then, N25,000 was more than three times the starting monthly wage of many civil servants in AnambraState.[103] \"We are contracted to do this,\" the man said. \"I earn money through my civil engineering and through politics. I get more money in politics.\"[104]\n\nThe leader of an armed gang whose primary stronghold stretches across part of Port Harcourt told Human Rights Watch that in 2003 he and numerous other cult and gang leaders had been paid between N3 million and N10 million ($23,000 to $77,000) each to \"disrupt the election in favor of our governor [Peter Odili][w]e stood at the election grounds so people would not come [to vote],\" he said. \"There was no election.\"[105] Similar payments were reportedly handed out during the 2007 elections in Rivers.[106]\n\nThe use and funding of political violence is by no means restricted to the PDP-the 2007 elections saw violent abuses committed on all sides. As one prominent lawyer in OyoState put it: often rival politicians \"are fishing from the same pond. They all make use of thugs.\"[107] A group of young men affiliated with the outlawed O'odua People Congress (OPC) told Human Rights Watch that they would work for anyone able to pay them to carry out acts of violence ahead of the 2007 elections.[108] \"We are not interested in your writing,\" one of them told Human Rights Watch. \"Your writing does not feed us. Bring money, bring guns, bring the logistics. It is war now and we want to see action.\"[109] But because the PDP controls the machinery of state in much of Nigeria, it is often better positioned to mobilize the resources necessary to fund political violence than other parties.\n\nOne former cult member in Port Harcourt, who had been involved in violence on behalf of the PDP during the 2003 elections, explained to Human Rights Watch that most armed groups in RiversState prefer to work for the PDP even where alternative sponsors present themselves:\n\nThe PDP has ruled for eight years and so they have the money and they have the powerOther parties say, when we are in government you will enjoy money-but the PDP will pay you immediately, so people prefer this. What the PDP is, is guns and money.[110]\n\nOther individuals interviewed by Human Rights Watch also expressed skepticism about the rewards involved in working against the PDP. One police officer in OyoState expressed contempt for what he saw as an effort by the opposition Action Congress to buy the sympathy of the police in the state. He said that one official allegedly linked to the party's campaign efforts in the state gave cash to police commanders to be distributed throughout the force. \"Every junior officer got N200,\" he said. \"I left the money with my boss; it's not even enough for one beer!\"[111]\n\nFalse Promises\n\nMany politicians lure unemployed young men into committing acts of political violence by making extravagant promises of employment or other forms of illegal government patronage that those officials are unlikely, and perhaps unable, to deliver. Members of one criminal gang in Oyo State who said they had performed contract killings and other acts of violence for the PDP in 2007 told Human Rights Watch that they expected to be awarded \"contracts for security, construction and logging\" after the 2007 elections. One of the gang members added, \"There is one man [another gang member] I know in Ogun state, he got a logging concession, he gets nine million Naira per month.\"[112] And another member of the same gang expressed an even more unlikely expectation of the possible rewards for carrying out electoral violence:\n\nThe best thing you can get is a multiple entry visa to the UK. If a godfather promised you that, you would do anything. To get a visa you need to submit bank statements but the godfathers are multi-millionaires, they can do it for yougodfathers usually give out around 20 [visas] per campaign for the top cult members and loyalists.\n\nHe laughed and added, \"That is why you get the worst Nigerians in London!\"[113]\n\nThe failure of politicians to deliver on such extravagant promises-all of which would be entirely illegal in and of themselves even were they honored-has had lasting consequences. In RiversState, for example, state government officials armed and mobilized criminal gangs to rig the 2003 election in favor of the PDP.[114] Many of those groups feel that they were subsequently \"dumped\" when the officials they helped rig into office failed to honor promises of government jobs and other forms of patronage. This has led to a breakdown in relations between armed cult groups and their former sponsors. Many of those former political thugs have put the arms and experience they acquired rigging the 2003 elections to use in more generalized forms of violent crime. This has given rise to a long and ongoing wave of uncontrolled criminal violence in the state. The situation in Rivers is discussed in more detail below.\n\nBox 2: Direct State Sponsorship of Thugs in Katsina\n\nIn at least one Nigerian state, Katsina, the state government paid money directly to gangs of youth who were accused of carrying out widespread political violence in return for those payments. Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua served as Governor of Katsina State for eight years until being elected president in April 2007. According to former state government officials, civil society activists and PDP Youth members, his administration used state government money to maintain several thousand \"PDP Youth\" on a regular monthly stipend of N5000 ($38). One former state government official told Human Rights Watch that this PDP youth organization was essentially a perversion of an initiative to empower unemployed youth in the state:\n\nBefore 2003 the idea was brought at a Government House meeting to establish television viewing centers in all of the wards. Some of us vehemently opposed this on the basis that this was not an acceptable legacy to bequeath on the youth. [We] suggested computer training centers. The idea was accepted but [later] this thing suddenly became, \"Let's give them a N5000 allowance.\" [These youth] have since become a reservoir of thugs.[115]\n\nThe same official told Human Rights Watch that the stipends were normally paid out of the state government's security vote.[116] The security vote is a budget line that is meant to act as a source of discretionary spending that the executive arms of government can use to respond quickly and effectively to threats to peace and security in their jurisdictions. However the use of those funds is notoriously opaque; there is generally no requirement that governors or local government chairpersons account for their use of those funds. In many cases security vote money has been used by state and local governments to foment violence and co-opt political opponents or has been lost to graft and patronage.[117]\n\nThe PDP youth organization had chapters in local governments throughout the state and its members had no formal obligation to perform any kind of service in exchange for their stipends.[118]\n\nDuring the 2007 elections, opposition supporters complained that PDP youth members were used as political thugs throughout the state, intimidating opposition supporters and voters. On election day itself Action Congress and ANPP supporters pointed to the PDP youth in several local governments as having been involved in widespread attacks on polling stations that saw many ballot boxes stolen by gangs of PDP supporters.[119]\n\nHuman Rights Watch interviewed two members of the PDP youth organization in Katsina town. Both acknowledged that they were paid N5000 per month and said that this money came to their superiors in the organization from Government House. They also said that some of their members had received other forms of patronage from government. \"If we have a building they want to complete or want to buy a motorcyclethe government helps us.\"[120]\n\nThe two said that in return for the stipends they were expected to \"go out for rallies, go out for campaigns, to follow the politicians.\"[121] They denied being used to attack or intimidate members of the opposition, saying that during the elections they were deployed as party agents to polling units throughout the city. However they did acknowledge that they had been involved in several violent clashes with ANPP supporters in the run-up to the elections. In one instance, they fought with supporters of ANPP presidential candidate Muhammadu Buhari at a rally in Katsina town two days before the 2007 gubernatorial elections. \"When Buhari came in for his campaign, he came in with thugs who had been smoking hard drugs,\" one of PDP youth members claimed. \"They wanted to force people to raise their right hand for Buhari, so we had to react to the situation.\"[122] By contrast, press accounts of the clash reported that the fighting began when a group of PDP thugs arrived at a Buhari campaign event and began harassing people.[123]\n\nEntrenching Impunity: Federal Government Complicity, Human Rights Abuse and Corruption\n\n\"Many people have been killed in this system and no one has been held to account for it.\"\n\n-Hon. Ben Chuks, AnambraState\n\nDuring its eight years in power the Obasanjo administration made little significant effort to ensure that government officials and members of the security forces implicated in violations of civil and political rights, including election-related violence, were held to account. While only a small minority of the human rights abuses documented in this report were directly carried out by federal government officials, the federal government's failure to combat widespread impunity for abuses orchestrated by government and PDP officials at the state and local level has fostered the unabated continuation of those abuses.\n\nImpunity and Governance in Nigeria\n\nThroughout Nigeria there exists a deeply entrenched culture of impunity that developed at all levels of Nigeria's government under military rule and remains as a source of the country's worst human rights abuses since the return to civilian rule in 1999. On several occasions since then, the Nigerian military has carried out misdirected reprisals against civilian populations, destroying entire communities and murdering hundreds of Nigerian civilians.[124] No one has been held to account for ordering or participating in those atrocities. The Nigerian police routinely torture criminal suspects and others who fall into their custody. President Obasanjo's rhetorical acknowledgement of the problem of police torture in 2005 was not followed up by any meaningful action to bring those responsible to account or prevent future abuses.[125]\n\nMore than 11,000 Nigerians were killed in hundreds of separate outbreaks of intercommunal and political violence during the Obasanjo administration.[126] Many of those deaths came about in large scale and apparently highly organized massacres along ethnic and religious lines. No one has been held to account for their role in organizing or inciting those massacres.[127] During the same period several high profile Nigerians were assassinated in attacks widely believed to be politically motivated, including Attorney General Bola Ige in December 2001.[128] No one has been held to account for any but one of those killings-and the government's claim to have \"solved\" Ige's murder days before Obasanjo left office provoked widespread skepticism.[129]\n\nNigeria's police force has the reputation of being a notoriously corrupt and ineffective institution whose failures lay at the heart of government failure to take effective action against impunity. In one recent public opinion survey carried out across Nigeria, respondents overwhelmingly voted the police to be the country's most corrupt public institution.[130] At the same time, the police's capacity to carry out criminal investigations is extremely lacking. As the director of one civil society organization that works to monitor police conduct in Nigeria put it: \"The police do not have the capacity to move forward with a case unless they were there when it happened. If you say you saw someone hanging around an armed robbery, they will get that person and torture him. If not, they suspect no one.\"[131]\n\nThese failures are tremendous, but in fact the Nigerian government has done far worse than simply fail to address the problem of impunity effectively. Through many of its actions the federal government has encouraged the commission of human rights abuses at the state and local levels and has thereby undercut its own limited efforts at promoting reform and accountability. In many cases federal institutions have worked actively to prevent individuals accused of human rights abuses from being held to account.\n\nRewarding Abuse and Corruption\n\nMany individuals facing credible allegations of human rights abuse and corruption have been rewarded with positions of influence and power by the government and the PDP. AnambraState political godfather Chris Uba-whose alleged crimes are detailed in the Anambra case study of this report-remains a member of the PDP board of trustees. Chris Uba's brother Andy received the presidency's political support for his bid for the governorship of AnambraState despite his implication in corrupt activities and his campaign team's open recruitment of cult gangs to intimidate his electoral opponents. OyoState political godfather Lamidi Adedibu has retained his position of political power within the PDP and Oyo politics as a whole despite his open involvement in fomenting political violence in the state. The situations in Oyo and AnambraStates and the roles of the Uba brothers and Adedibu are discussed below in this report.[132]\n\nCorruption at the top\n\nTop-level government officials have not only failed to rein in the corruption at lower levels; they have repeatedly been implicated in scandals themselves and escaped any form of sanction. Sunday Ehindero, Nigeria's Inspector General of Police until June 2007, had publicly stated his commitment to combat corruption within the police force and address serious police abuses. When he stepped down as inspector general some of Ehindero's aides were reportedly caught trying to smuggle N21 million in stolen money ($161,000) out of police headquarters and many reports indicated that the money was being taken on Ehindero's behalf.[133] No charges have been brought against him as of the time of writing and no public response to the allegations has been forthcoming from any federal government institution.\n\nPresident Obasanjo himself was implicated in a number of scandals during his last years in power, including an alleged attempt by his aides to bribe members of the National Assembly to support Obasanjo's bid for a third term. Days before leaving office, Obsanjo controversially sold off two of Nigeria's three troubled oil refineries to a consortium of investors including Transcorp, a corporation that has purchased a number of high profile government and other assets since its formation in 2004.[134] Transcorp has itself been a target of controversy since it became known that Obasanjo had acquired 200 million shares of its stock by unknown means.[135] The Obasanjo administration's last-minute sale of the refineries to Transcorp aroused such controversy that it played a minor part in triggering a nationwide strike in June 2007.[136]\n\nImpunity and the 2007 Elections\n\nNigeria's fraudulent 2007 elections provided a vivid illustration of the unshakable confidence many Nigerian public officials and politicians have in their own impunity. Just as remarkable as the massive scale of the fraud that characterized the polls was the openness with which violence, vote theft and other abuses were carried out. Human Rights Watch and election observer groups reported ballot box stuffing, intimidation and other abuses carried out in the most public manner possible.\n\nIn some cases political leaders openly bragged about their plans to rig elections and unleash violence on their opponents. In the town of Funtua in KatsinaState, for example, residents complained that their local government chairman gave a public address several days before the elections during which he bragged that the elections would be rigged in favor of the PDP. One woman present at the event told Human Rights Watch that:\n\nThe chairman was stating publicly that people should just burn ANPP posters and that even if they cut ANPP supporters nothing will happenHe said Funtua is PDP and any other party is inconsequential and the PDP will win no matter what happens. He said whether through hook or by crook he had taken a promise to do whatever it takes to deliver Funtua. He said, \"INEC is ours, the police is ours.\" The hoodlums follow him wherever he goes.[137]\n\nThe PDP won the statewide elections in Funtua by a landslide and after the first round of voting the town erupted into violence between PDP and ANPP supporters. Several buildings including the local government secretariat were burned to the ground.[138]\n\nNo one has been investigated, let alone held to account for the systematic rigging of Nigeria's 2007 elections. Addressing this failure depends upon President Yar'Adua and those around him. The dilemma, however, is that they all owe their offices to those same fraudulent elections.\n\nThe Nigerian Police and Impunity for Political Violence\n\nThe Nigerian police often lacks the capacity to work effectively and is riddled with corruption that dilutes its effectiveness further still. But just as important as the police's shortcomings as an institution are political pressures that often prevent the police from investigating abuses connected to politicians or other prominent allies of the ruling party. As one prominent politician from southwestern Nigeria said to Human Rights Watch, \"Political crimes are not ordinary crimes. In such cases the [state's] Commissioner [of Police] becomes a messenger from above-he requires a nod from higher authorities to function effectivelyso what needs to change is the mindset in Abuja.\"[139] One Lagos-based activist noted that \"there is a lot of second-guessing also. Even if the president does not issue a directive [not to investigate someone], people try and guess what he would and would not like.\"[140]\n\nThe effects of the police force's equivocal commitment to accountability were clearly evident during the months surrounding the 2007 elections. Rather than attempt to investigate and bring to account sponsors of election-related violence, the leadership of the police force largely fell into a pattern of refusing to respond to incidents of political violence orchestrated by leading politicians or influential members of the PDP.\n\nHuman Rights Watch interviewed then-Inspector General of Police Sunday Ehindero, an appointee of President Obasanjo, during the run-up to the election. Asked about the police response to scores of widely publicized instances of election-related violence, Ehindero said that he knew of \"only one\" incident of election-related violence that had taken place during the entire pre-election period-an incident that happened to occur in his physical presence.[141] That level of public unconcerncoming from Nigeria's top police official was remarkable, especially considering that lower-level police officers had promised robust investigations of many other clashes and attempted murders at the time.[142]\n\nSimilarly, after the elections had come and gone the Commissioner of Police in Oyo State at the time, Jonathan Johnson, insisted to Human Rights Watch that \"there was no violence in Oyo State\" during the entire electoral period aside from \"a few areas of ballot-box snatching\" on the days of actual voting.[143] In fact, Oyo was one of the bloodiest theaters of political violence in the whole of Nigeria before, during, and after the elections and the architects of much of that violence were widely known.[144]\n\nIn several cases, police officials interviewed by Human Rights Watch lamented these problems but said that they were helpless to overcome the political resistance to investigations of prominent politicians responsible for violence and other abuses (see box 3 below). The Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in one town in Rivers State told Human Rights Watch that he witnessed a mob led by a local politician attack his police station on election day, destroying or stealing all of the election materials that had been stored there and driving off the officers inside. Human Rights Watch interviewed him hours after the incident at his home, where he had shed his uniform and was drinking beer in the early afternoon to calm his nerves. Asked if he would make any arrests since he knew some of the individuals involved, he replied, \"No, it's impossible. The thing has come and gone. The only thing to do is to pray.\"[145]\n\nBox 3: A Commissioner of Police Discusses Impunity\n\nThe following is an excerpt from an interview with the Commissioner of Police in a state in southern Nigeria, conducted in advance of the April 2007 elections. The name and other identifying details of the commissioner have been withheld to protect him against possible reprisal:\n\nDefinitely cult members will be used by politicians [during the elections], without question. They know how to get at them There are even policemen and soldiers who can be used by people in power to do what thugs would normally do\n\nOne should expect by now that issues like cultism should have been taken seriously, very seriously, by the governmentbut the reverse appears to be the caseFrom what I can gather they have accepted cultism as a normal thing that should be expected in the universities. This is in spite of the fact that some of these cultists are murderers and armed robbers and they can be recruited easily by politicians to commit violent acts-they are like a cheap market, they are there in large numbers at all times to be recruited. So there is nothing actually to deter students from continuing to enlist in these various cult groups.\n\nWe learned that some politicians-I don't want to mention names- have empowered one of the cult groups-[name withheld]-and they were used in one of the recently concluded party primaries as touts to ensure that certain candidates were elected.\n\nLaw enforcement must be empowered to do the proper thing. If government is serious it is not that difficult. But where a policeman has not fed since the previous day, what can he do? In the past year the police in [this state] have lost 42 men, 28 of them killed violently. And it's nothing. It doesn't mean anything. It's not news that policemen are dying on a continuous basis.\n\nIf I had a way of paying my children's school fees I think I might just put in my resignation letter and retire.[146]\n\nSelective Use of Anti-Corruption Institutions\n\nNigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) was set up by the Obasanjo government in 2003 to investigate and prosecute financial crimes, including fraud and corruption. The EFCC earned plaudits from many Nigerians and from the international community in its first few years for aggressively pursuing corruption allegations against a range of prominent government officials including several sitting governors. One of the EFCC's greatest and most unprecedented successes came in securing the conviction of former Inspector General of Police Tafa Balogun on charges of corruption in 2005.[147]\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2007 elections, however, the Obasanjo government manipulated the EFCC into selectively pursuing opposition politicians and opponents of President Obasanjo within the PDP.[148] This was done so openly that it destroyed much of the institution's credibility and effectiveness as both a deterrent and a mechanism of accountability.[149]\n\nMost controversially, the EFCC sought to bar a long list of candidates from standing in the April elections by cooperating in government efforts to issue so-called \"indictments\" on charges of corruption that made no pretense of adhering to basic standards of due process. Almost all of those on the EFCC's now-infamous \"list\" were members of the opposition or well-known opponents of Obasanjo within the PDP.[150]\n\nAt the same time, prominent and notoriously corrupt members of the PDP have been left untouched by any sort of EFCC investigation. Many of the individuals who have escaped the attention of the EFCC are faced with credible evidence of precisely the kind of corruption that fuels many of the abuses described in this report. To cite just a few of many examples:\n\nChristopher Alao-Akala, then the PDP nominee for governor in OyoState, was reportedly put on the EFCC list of candidates deemed \"unfit\" to run in the 2007 elections but then taken off in response to political pressure. The same allegations were made regarding current Nigerian Vice President Goodluck Jonathan, then serving as governor of BayelsaState.[151]\n\nAn investigation into allegations of corruption by PDP chieftain Olabode George during his time as head of the Ports Authority was allowed to die without any convincing explanation on the part of the EFCC.[152]\n\nThe EFCC refused to investigate widespread allegations of corruption against Andy Uba, a powerful aide to President Obasanjo and ultimately the PDP candidate for Governor of Anambra State, even after he was caught by US customs officials attempting to smuggle $170,000 in cash into the United States on board Nigeria's presidential jet.[153]\n\nThe EFCC made no real attempt to investigate credible allegations that officials in the presidency attempted to bribe members of the National Assembly into voting in favor of Obasanjo's abortive attempt at changing the constitution to allow himself a third term in office.[154]\n\nWhere the EFCC did exercise its power under Obasanjo, it was often for the purpose of coercing individuals into acquiescing to the will of the presidency. In AnambraState, for example, PDP officials combined bribery with the threat of EFCC investigation to coerce legislators into impeaching opposition Governor Peter Obi. One of the legislators involved, who ultimately yielded to the demands being made of him, said \"The way we see it, the EFCC, it has nothing to do with whether you have committed any offense or not. They will come and arrest a person for any reason and keep him behind bars until he succumbs to what they want him to do.\"[155] Similar situations reportedly surrounded the impeachment of BayelsaState governor Diepreye Alamieyeseigha and attempts at impeaching several other PDP Governors seen as hostile to the Presidency.[156]\n\nCase Study A: OyoState\n\nThis is where democracy starts in Nigeria. This place hosted the first university in West Africa. Everything started here. But the situation is deteriorating and now we have a government of illiterates, we have a politics of hooliganism, of violence, of moneybags. These are the kinds of people Adedibu brought into all levels of government.\n\n-Senior Advocate of Nigeria (name withheld), Ibadan[157]\n\nNigeria's southwestern state of Oyo calls itself Nigeria's \"pace setter,\" reflecting a deeply held pride in the state's reputation as a leader in the fields of commerce and education. Oyo's capital city of Ibadan is one of the largest commercial centers in West Africa and the University of Ibadan is Nigeria's oldest and one of its finest. But in recent years, Oyo has also pushed the frontiers of violence and corruption that characterize Nigeria's nascent \"democracy.\"\n\nThe Godfather of Ibadan\n\nChief Lamidi Adedibu has been involved in Oyo politics since the 1950s. His many detractors allege that he got his start as a small-time organizer of political thugs for the Action Group party of Chief Obafemi Awolowo.[158] By the late 1980s, however, he had emerged as a powerful political force through a combination of populist politics, patronage, violence, and extortion.[159]\n\nAdedibu is an iconic figure in Nigerian politics, an example of the kind of power to which political godfathers aspire.[160] When Human Rights Watch visited Adedibu's Ibadan compound in the run-up to the 2007 elections, he held court sprawled across a large chair underneath a tin roof adjacent to his car park, which was crowded with a long-line of would-be supplicants. Adedibu's every word brought nods or cheers from those who crowded around to listen, and several people who walked across his field of vision immediately prostrated themselves as a gesture of deference when he glanced up in their general direction.\n\nAdedibu flaunts his political power quite openly, telling Human Rights Watch that, \"I sponsor them, all of the politicians [in the state.]\"[161] Oyo's current governor, Christopher Alao-Akala, is a protg of Adedibu's and told Human Rights Watch that \"Chief Adedibu has sponsored everybody. Everybody who is who and who in OyoState politics has passed through that place [Adedibu's compound in Ibadan].\"[162] Adeolu Adeleke, Speaker of the Oyo State House of Assembly until April 2007, eventually became an opponent of Adedibu's but confirmed that he had initially obtained his sponsorship in order to get elected. \"I did go to Baba and he did sponsor me,\" he said. \"I believed I could not do anything contrary to him. Some of my colleagues [in the House] also went to him.\"[163]\n\nAdedibu's power flows primarily from his tremendous ability to mobilize violence and money in support of the politicians he sponsors. He also distributes cash and food to supplicants on a daily basis from his Ibadan home, a brand of patronage frequently referred to as \"amala politics,\" after a traditional dish common to Nigeria's southwest.[164]\n\nMany residents of Oyo prefer to use harsher terminology. As former PDP Senator Lekan Balogun put it: \"He is notorious. He threatens people he wants to have vote for [his candidates] with machetes. His stock in trade is blackmail, violence and intimidation and everyone knows it.\"[165]\n\nAdedibu's War Against Ladoja\n\nRashidi Ladoja served as Governor of Oyo State from 2003 to 2007. Adedibu supported Ladoja as the PDP candidate in the 2003 elections Adedibu helped to rig, partly by providing the muscle needed to fix the polls. Ladoja confirmed this fact to Human Rights Watch but said that once he was in office, he tried immediately to break free of Adedibu's influence.\n\nLadoja told Human Rights Watch that he fell out with Adedibu shortly after coming into office in 2003 because he refused to allow Adedibu access to the treasury-he alleges that Adedibu ordered him to turn over 25 percent of the government's security vote-or roughly N15 million ($115,000) per month-directly to him.[167] Ladoja also refused to allow Adedibu to name the Commissioners who would serve in his cabinet.[168]\n\nIn an interview with Human Rights Watch, Adedibu described Ladoja as an \"ingrate.\"[169] Current Governor Christopher Alao-Akala agreed. \"Ladoja should have involved him in forming the government,\" he said. \"You cannot exclude this man from decision-making.\"[170] Former state Governor Kolapo Ishola, who met with Human Rights Watch at Adedibu's home, expressed a similar view: \"The problem with Ladoja-he did not consult Baba on appointments, he did not ask whether he had candidates for appointments, for patronage, for contracts. Adedibu did not have a say, he was angry.\"[171]\n\nViolence Engulfs the Legislature\n\nBy August 2005 tensions between Ladoja and Adedibu had caused the State House of Assembly to split in two, with a majority of 18 out of 32 members publicly supporting Adedibu in every matter related to his struggle with Governor Ladoja for control of the state government. The legislature largely ceased to function as a single house.[172]\n\nAt the end of 2005 the so-called \"G-18\" of pro-Adedibu lawmakers set about trying to impeach Governor Ladoja. Their first attempt failed and resulted in an armed melee on the floor of the State legislature. One pro-Adedibu lawmaker stabbed one of his rivals with a knife and several others were also wounded; some lawmakers reportedly drew firearms and fired into the air to ward off attackers from the opposing camp.[173] The police made no arrests.\n\nJust over one week later, armed policemen escorted the G-18 lawmakers to the State House of Assembly for a second try at moving the impeachment motion.[174] An hours-long gun battle erupted between the police and armed thugs supporting Ladoja who sought to prevent the pro-Adedibu legislators from entering the House. At least one civil servant was wounded in the crossfire and the fighting caused panic to spread throughout Ibadan.[175]\n\nEventually the G-18 legislators broke into the locked House of Assembly and voted, on their own, to constitute a panel of inquiry to investigate allegations of misconduct including corruption against Ladoja. Immediately following the vote a large group of anti-Ladoja thugs stormed Government House and ran rampant through the premises, looting and destroying the Governor's office. Some of this was captured on film by the thugs themselves.[176] The police made no arrests in connection with the sponsorship of any of this violence. Three weeks later the G-18 voted unanimously to remove Ladoja from office, replacing him with Deputy Governor and Adedibu loyalist Christopher Alao-Akala.\n\nThe attempt to impeach Ladoja ended in failure. In December 2006 Nigeria's Supreme Court reversed the move as illegal because his removal was not supported by the required two-thirds majority of the legislature.[177]\n\nRival Armies of Political Thugs\n\nAfter Ladoja resumed office in late 2006, the political struggle between the governor and Adedibu was waged mainly in the streets through regular battles between proxy gangs. Many of those thugs were armed with machetes and locally manufactured small arms that were-according to interviews with government officials, police officers and civil society activists-provided or paid for by their sponsors.[178] The depredations of those groups exacted a heavy toll on ordinary civilians who were subjected to violent crimes and looting, while few of the thugs and none of their sponsors were ever held to account.\n\nBoth Ladoja and Adedibu turned to OyoState's chapter of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) as a primary source of political thugs. NURTW has several thousand members in Oyo alone and is meant to represent the collective bargaining interests of drivers of commercial passenger vehicles. There is considerable evidence that NURTW's Oyo chapter has long been used as a tool of political violence by Adedibu and others. Some longtime members complain that the union has been largely captured by violent motor park \"touts\" who loiter about the motor parks harassing drivers and passengers alike.[179]\n\nFormerOyoState Senator Lekan Balogun told Human Rights Watch that \"I would call for the complete proscription of NURTW. They do not have any purpose. They are available for negative activities including thuggery and they [politicians] draw their thugs from there.\"[180] The senator was beaten and nearly killed by a group of NURTW thugs loyal to Adedibu while attempting to mediate the dispute between Ladoja and Adedibu in January 2007.[181]FormerOyoState Governor Victor Olunloyo echoed these sentiments, adding, \"It has always been that way, it was like that when I was governor.\"[182]\n\nThe Deputy Secretary of one NURTW branch in Ibadan acknowledged his members' involvement in \"politics,\" explaining that, \"We are supposed to be a separate body but the way they are playing politics in Nigeria, if you want to be anything you cannot rule out the godfather system. You must be somehow political. If one is elected they will want to thank us.[183]\n\nAdedibu and Ladoja each supported rival factions of NURTW under two different leaders. The pro-Adedibu faction was led by Lateef Akinsola, commonly known as \"Tokyo.\" In 2003, Ladoja's Attorney General charged Tokyo with several counts of murder and kept him in detention without bail for more than two and a half years while trying to convict him.[184] During Tokyo's detention Ladoja backed a rival named Wasilu Adegboyega, commonly known as \"Tawa,\" to usurp Tokyo's role.\n\nTokyo was released from prison in February 2006 under Akala's watch, just weeks after Ladoja's temporary \"impeachment.\"[185] He immediately moved to reassert his leadership over NURTW in violent fashion. Tokyo's supporters, along with other thugs loyal to Adedibu, took over the car parks by force after violent clashes with supporters of Tawa's faction. Several people were injured and at least one killed.[186]\n\nHuman Rights Watch interviewed one man who said he was attacked with machetes at the time of Tokyo's resurgence because he had led NURTW members in a prayer at the ceremony that had seen Tawa invested as NURTW chairman two years earlier. \"I saw four or five people and they just attacked me, all carrying cutlasses,\" he said. \"They really beat me, all of the women were shouting. There was all blood everywhere and I had to take my car and go to the hospital.\"[187] He said that two people had died in the fighting at his motor park that day, and that he had not reported the incident to the police lest the pro-Tokyo union leadership bar him from working out of the motor parks altogether.[188] The police reportedly did not intervene or hold to account any of those responsible for that violence.[189]\n\nWith Tokyo back in control of NURTW, Tawa and his supporters were exiled from most of the motor parks in Oyo. Some of them, including Tawa, took up residence inside the compound that includes the governor's lodge for mutual protection. Governor Ladoja acknowledged this in an interview with Human Rights Watch.[190]\n\nBy this point, Ladoja and Adedibu were jockeying for position ahead of the 2007 elections. Ladoja sought to regain the PDP nomination for governor to run for a second term while Adedibu, along with President Obasanjo in Abuja, supported Deputy Governor Christopher Alao-Akala in his bid to obtain the party's ticket. The result was a series of bloody clashes between supporters of Adedibu and Ladoja. The Tokyo and Tawa factions of NURTW were again at the front lines of these clashes.\n\nPre-Election Escalation\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2007 elections, Ladoja and Adedibu's factions fought each other regularly. On the weekend of February 4, 2007, the two factions at a PDP rally in neighboring Osun state when the party hierarchy formally awarded the ticket to Akala"
