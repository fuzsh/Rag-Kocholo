        "text": "The gubernatorial candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in Gombe state Mr. Keftin Amuga, has unveiled his four points agenda for the state, stating that his administration is posed to tackling the political problem in the state.\n\nAccording to him, tackling homegrown and external insecurity, addressing women empowerment, youth unemployment as well as drug abuse and restiveness will be given special attention by his administration.\n\nMr. Amuga who disclosed this at a press briefing in Abuja added that the pursuit of Justice, equity and fairness in the conduct of government activities will be prioritized under his government.\n\nHe said, “restoring honor, respect and dignity to our traditional institutions, which for most of the ethnic nationalities, is a symbol of sovereignty and independence. In addition, the Labour Party Government in Gombe State will address the issue of injustices affecting the various ethnic nationalities, including also the Tangle Chieftaincy matter and restore Justice, Equity and Fairness to the affected,” Amuga stated.\n\nWhile urging residents in Gombe to shun the money politics of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Amuga tasked them to adopt the politics of issues that will shape the future and destiny of the state.\n\nHe called on the residents to see LP as their opinion and reject the age-long oppressors. He said, “embraced and vote the LP where your future and that of the generation yet unborn will be Secured and Guaranteed”.\n\nHe also disclosed that he was contesting for the seat of the state governor to redeem and restore the fortunes and destinies of the oppressed peoples of the state.\n\nHe said, “As you may all be aware, Gombe State which was created in 1996, is an amalgam of the former Gombe Native Authority (NA) and the Tangale-Waja Native Authority (NA). The two entities were both created in about 1935 by the British Colonial Masters and given equal status in accordance with their distinct historical and political antecedents.\n\n“However and sadly, since the creation of Gombe State in 1996, now 26 years ago, we have observed the entrenchment of an institutionalized practice of discrimination against the citizens of the State on the basis of place of origin, ethnicity and religious beliefs by the two Major Political Parties of PDP and APC, that have ruled Gombe State, ever since,” Amuga stated."
