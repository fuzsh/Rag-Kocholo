Niger State - 76,363 km²\n\nDate created: 3 February 1976\n\nCapital: Minna\n\nTotal area: 76,363 km²\n\nWhich state is the largest state in Nigeria? Niger is the largest state in the country. It is located in the country's north-central area and has three political zones: A, B and C.\n\nIt has twenty-five Local Government Areas. They include Agaie, Agwara, Bida, Borgu, Bosso, Chanchaga, Edati, Gbako, Gurara, Katcha, Kontagora, Lapai, Lavun, Magama, Mariga, Mashegu, Mokwa, Munya, Paikoro, Rafi, Rijau, Shiroro, Suleja, Tafa, and Wushishi.\n\nDuring a discussion with Evans Osabuohien, an Economics Professor at Covenant University and a seasoned researcher, he emphasised that effectively channeling land, as an economic resource, into productive use is crucial for ensuring the prosperity of the state.\n\nA state with a large landmass does not determine if it will be more economically productive than others (those with a small landmass), for example, Lagos State is the smallest in the country, yet it has the largest economic prowess. If you look at the top ten largest states by landmass in Nigeria, not many of them are among the top ten states in terms of GDP (gross domestic product) or economic prowess or empowerment.\n\nA state that has such a large landmass should be able to attract some productive activities in its mining and quarrying and maybe have a space for real estate development. But how that is determined depends on the kind of incentives and economic atmosphere created by the state to attract such investment.\n\nIn addressing the management and equal balance of rural and urban development in these states, Professor Evans emphasised the importance for state governments to prioritise inclusive growth. He suggested the implementation of a deliberate plan to ensure that every region of the state actively participates in the growth process.\n\nFor example, a state that has a road network connecting urban to rural areas will be better in terms of transporting the produce from the rural areas to the urban areas. And also, the input from the urban areas is supplied to the rural areas.\n\nMuch more so, another point is that a state that has some level of amenities, such as power supply and electricity in almost every part of the state, will invariably have easy distribution across every part of the state because everybody can stay anywhere and still enjoy a little bit of comfort without going to the urban areas compared to a state where their activities are only at the centre, which will create another crisis: the popular rural-urban migration and the issue of urbanisation and overpopulation in the urban areas.\n\nIn summary, there should be a deliberate way to balance the whole process, and that can be done through the use of incentive infrastructure so that economic actors can stay anywhere in the state and still have access to basic amenities and contribute his or her quota to the growth process. In that way, the growth of that state can be much more inclusive than in other states that don’t make such deliberate attempts.\n\nProfessor Evans also recommended that the federal government has devised strategies capable of unlocking the full potential of states for sustainable growth. Among the strategies he highlighted are:\n\nOperation Feed the Nation (OFN)\n\nBack to Farm policy\n\nBetter Life for Rural Women\n\nThe Directorate of Food, Roads, and Rural Infrastructure (DFRRI)\n\nFADAMA (this is a Northern Nigerian dialect that means irrigable lowland launched in 1992 by the federal government)\n\nThe Green Alternatives\n\nThe Agricultural Transformation Agenda (ATA)\n\nNational Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS)\n\nHe emphasized that some of these strategies should be \"reactivated\" to ensure their proper implementation, clarifying that:\n\nOne of the ways land becomes effective is through the use of agriculture and real estate. When there is a backward-and-forward linkage between the rural and urban communities, there will be more elements of inclusive growth, distribution, and much more. Everyone can stay anywhere and contribute because, wherever they are, they will have what is needed to contribute.\n\nFor example, the Chinese economy has made available basic amenities in the areas where production (like buttons) take place can focus on their productive activities and those who need to buy the buttons can purchase from them with ease; thus, reduce the cost of production and eventual average cost. So the input comes to you, and the output goes from you. If we have that in place (such as in Nigeria), farmers or those involved in the agricultural sector can focus on their core and leave the issue of marketing, distribution, branding, and packaging to the value chain; this could be one way to ensure equitable growth.\n\nWhich are the 36 Nigerian states by land mass?\n\nBelow is a table of the states in Nigeria, ranked from the largest state to the smallest.\n\nStateCapital Total area in km²Niger StateMinna76,363Borno StateMaiduguri70,898Taraba StateJalingo54,473Kaduna StateKaduna15,053Bauchi StateBauchi45,893Yobe StateDamaturu45,502Zamfara StateGusau39,762Adamawa StateYola36,917Kwara StateIlorin36,825Kebbi StateBirnin Kebbi36,800Benue StateMakurdi34,059Plateau StateJos30,913Kogi StateLokoja29,833Oyo StateIbadan28,454Nasarawa StateLafia27,117Sokoto StateSokoto25,973Katsina StateKatsina24,192Jigawa StateDutse23,154Cross River StateCalabar20,156Kano StateKano20,131Gombe StateGombe18,768Edo StateBenin City17,802Delta StateAsaba17,698Ogun StateAbeokuta16,762Ondo StateAkure15,500Rivers StatePort Harcourt11,077Bayelsa StateYenagoa10,773Osun StateOsogbo9,251Enugu StateEnugu7,161\n\nBelow is a table of the states in Nigeria.\n\nStateCapitalTotal area in km² Akwa Ibom StateUyo7,081Ekiti StateAdo-Ekiti6,353Abia StateUmuahia6,320Ebonyi StateAbakaliki5,670Imo StateOwerri5,530Anambra StateAwka4,844Lagos StateIkeja3,345\n\nWhich state is the smallest in Nigeria?\n\nLagos is Nigeria's smallest state, with only 3,345 square kilometres.

Waterbodies cover over a quarter of the state's land area, with lagoons, creeks, and rivers dominating.\n\nEach of the top ten largest states in Nigeria by land mass is distinguished by geography, culture and population. They are also subdivided into various Local Government Areas.\n\nREAD ALSO: How many international airports are in Nigeria: List with locations\n\nA list of Nigeria's international airports and locations was recently published on Legit.ng.
