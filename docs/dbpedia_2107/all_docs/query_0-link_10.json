It is home to around 250 distinct cultural groups, the most prominent of which are the Hausa/Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo.\n\nWhen the British Protectorates of Northern and Southern Nigeria were combined in 1914, the area that is now known as Nigeria became a colony of the United Kingdom. Independence was achieved in 1960, and republic status was attained in 1963.\n\nThe nation is located in Africa on the coast of the Gulf of Guinea, and its capital and political center is the city of Abuja.

Nigeria has a total land area of 356,669 square miles (923,768 sq km).\n\nIn terms of government, Nigeria is divided into six geopolitical zones. Each zone is made up of at least six states, and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, is the center of government. Nigeria is a federation of 36 states and capitals and one Federal Capital Territory in West Africa.\n\nRelated: The 9 Provinces in South Africa and Their Capital Cities\n\nWhat are the Nigerian 36 states and capital and their slogan?\n\nThe Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria says that each of Nigeria’s 36 states is a semi-autonomous political unit that shares power with the federal government. Each state has its own government and constitution.\n\nBefore it gained its independence, Nigeria was divided into only three areas: the northern, the eastern, and the southern divisions. The nation is home to three main ethnic groups and languages: the Hausa, the Igbo, and the Yoruba, with English serving as the country’s official language.\n\nThe most important nation Christianity (Protestant, other Christians, and Roman Catholic), Islam, and traditional beliefs are the many forms of the faith.\n\nFor the sake of our conversation, we are going to zero in on the many slogans that are associated with her states and capital, as well as the names of her states and capital.\n\nYou will have a better understanding of the names of Nigeria’s 36 states, as well as its capital and slogan, after you have finished reading this page.

Eight states – Anambra, Bayelsa, Edo, Ekiti, Imo, Kogi, Ondo, and Osun – were excluded from the transformative events.

It was renamed “Land of Honour” in April 2019.\n\nCross River is the only state with a tourist destination in nearly every LGA, which is why the state’s slogan is “The People’s Paradise.”\n\nIbadan, the capital of Oyo state, is greater than Ekiti, Abia, Lagos, Imo, Anambra, and Ebonyi combined.\n\nBornu state’s tagline, strangely, is “The Home of Peace”.\n\nNasarawa has at least 20 identified natural resources.

Imagine the map of Africa; Nigeria is like a heart, beating in the western section of the continent. It is a country with various landscapes and an extensive heritage of culture, making it a really unique location on our lovely planet.\n\nNigeria is located between latitudes 4° and 14° N and longitudes 3° and 15° E. This means we’re nestled just above the equator, which adds to our warm and tropical environment. To the west, we have in common borders with Benin, while to the east, we share borders with Cameroon. We are bounded to the north by the enormous expanses of Niger and Chad, and to the south by the blue waves of the Atlantic Ocean. This strategic standing not only provides us with a diverse range of landscapes, but also places us at a cultural crossroads.\n\nThe Nigerian Map Showing All 36 States & FCT\n\nNigeria is enormous! In actuality, it is Africa’s 14th largest country, having an area of around 923,768 square kilometers. Because of its size, it is home to a wide range of landscapes, from the Sahel savannah in the far north to the lush rainforests in the south. Plateaus and hills characterize the central area, with the famed Jos Plateau standing proudly as a natural fortress in the heart of our country.\n\nFinally, Nigeria is not only geographically diverse; it is also culturally diverse. From ancient trade routes to imperial influences, our strategic location has played an important part in defining our history.\n\nNigerian 36 States and Capital and Their slogans (summary)\n\nNigeria has more than 220 million people, which is about the same as Brazil’s population.
