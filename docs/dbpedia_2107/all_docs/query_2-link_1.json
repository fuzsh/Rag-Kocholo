        "text": "The Gombe State Independent Electoral Commission (GOSIEC) has declared that the All Progressives Congress (APC) won all 11 chairmanship seats and 114 councillorship positions in the just-concluded LG elections.\n\nAnnouncing the election results, Saidu Shehu, GOSIEC chairman, said out of 19 registered political parties, only five participated in the election.\n\n”The parties that participated are APC, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Accord, Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) and Young Progressives Party (YPP),” he said.\n\n“APC cleared the 11 local government areas including Kaltungo and Shongom where the party won unopposed.\n\n“Other parties didn’t have candidates for the councillorship seats; candidates of the APC were returned elected.”\n\nThe newly elected and returned local government council officials are to be sworn in by Inuwa Yahaya, governor of the state, on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, the Gombe state chapter of the PDP was said to have rejected the outcome of the exercise, alleging that it was a “distortion of democracy and mere drama”.\n\nThe party added that it is planning on what appropriate redress mechanisms to use.\n\nPDP WINS ALL SEATS IN OYO\n\nIn the same vein, the Oyo State Independent Electoral Commission (OYSIEC) has announced that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) won all chairmanship seats in the 33 LGAs in the council polls held on Saturday.\n\nThe results were announced at the conference hall of the commission in Agodi, Ibadan, the state capital.\n\nHowever, the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state described the council election as a sham capable of causing the state untold disrepute.\n\nThere are allegations that election did not take place in some wards in Ibadan north, Ibadan south-west, and some parts of Saki in the Oke Ogun axis of the state."
