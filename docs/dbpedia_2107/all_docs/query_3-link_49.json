The symbols on the Seal shall be of primary colours of Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black [“CMYK”]\n\nThe descriptions of each symbol on the Seal are interpreted as follows:\n\nSymbol/Colour Meaning\n\nWhite Cap “Keremesi” – It denotes the symbol of authority common to most areas of the State\n\nAkoko Leaves – These signify longevity. It is universally used at the installation of Obas and Chiefs in Lagos State and all over Yorubaland\n\nCowries – They signify the earliest medium of exchange in the State. The background indicates foreshore sands common to all parts of the State.\n\nWheel – It signifies industry and the red background indicates flame generating power\n\nFishing Activity – It denotes the traditional occupation of the people and inhabitants of State.\n\nCoconut Palm – This represents one of the main agricultural products of the State.\n\nMotto: Justice and Peace – “Justice” signifies the necessity in the State to give every man his due without fear or favour, affection or ill will while “Progress” signifies the hopes and aspiration of the people of State\n\nThe Three lines – These represent the present, the past and the future.\n\nPROFILE OF LAGOS STATE\n\nLagos State was created on May 27, 1967 by virtue of States [Creation and Transitional Provisions] Decree No. 14 of 1967 which restructured Nigeria’s Federation into 12 States. Prior to this, Lagos Municipality was administered as a Federal Territory by the Federal Government through the Federal Ministry of Lagos Affairs as the regional authority, while the Lagos City Council governed the City of Lagos. Equally, the Metropolitan areas [Colony Province] of Ikeja, Agege, Mushin, Ojo, Ikorodu, Epe, and Badagry were then administered by the Western Region Government. The State took off as an administrative entity on April 11, 1968 with Lagos Island serving the dual role of being the State and Federal Capital respectively. However, with the creation of the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja in 1976, Lagos ceased to be the capital of the State, as this was moved to Ikeja. Similarly, with the formal relocation of the seat of the Federal Government to Abuja on 12th December, 1991, Lagos ceased to be Nigeria’s political capital. Nevertheless, Lagos remains the nation’s economic and commercial capital. According to extant political records, “Lagos is to the people of Nigeria, what the head is to the body of an individual”\n\nLOCATION/EXTENT\n\nThe State is located on the South–Western part of Nigeria, on the narrow plain of the Bight of Benin. Lying approximately on longitude 20 42’E and 32 2’E respectively, and between latitude 60 22’N and 60 2’N, Lagos State is bounded in the North and East by Ogun State of Nigeria, in the West by Republic of Benin, and stretches over 180 kilometers along the Guinea Coast of the Bight of Benin on the Atlantic Ocean. Its territorial extent and political jurisdiction encompasses the city of Lagos and the four administrative divisions of Ikeja, Ikorodu, Epe and\n\nBadagry collectively referred to as IBILE and covering an area of 358,862 hectares or 3,577 sq. km. which represents 0.4% of Nigeria’s territorial land mass of 923,773 sq. km.\n\nRELIEF\n\nThe dominant vegetation of the State is the swamp forest of the fresh water and mangrove swamp forests, both of which are influenced by the double rainfall pattern of the state, which makes the environment a wetland region. Generally, the State has two climatic seasons: Dry [November-March] and Wet [April-October]. The drainage system of the State is characterized by a maze of lagoons and waterways, which constitutes about 22% or 787 sq. km. [75.755 hectares] of the State’s territory. The major water bodies are the Lagos and Lekki Lagoons, Yewa, Ogun, Oshun, and Kweme Rivers. Others are Ologe Lagoon, Kuramo Waters, and Badagry, Five Cowries and Omu Creeks respectively.\n\nDEMOGRAPHY\n\nLagos State is the smallest state in Nigeria yet, it has the highest urban population, which is 27.4 % of the national estimate [UN-Habitat]. According to the 2006 National Census, Lagos State has a population of 9,013,534 in relation to the National count of 140,003,542. However, based on the UN-Habitat and international development agencies’ estimates, Lagos State is said to have about 24.6 million inhabitants in 2015. Of this population, Metropolitan Lagos accounts for over 85% on an area that is 37% of the land area of the State, and the fact that Lagos population is growing 10 times faster than that of New York and Los Angeles, and more than the population of 32 African nations combined, the State population is expected to hit the 35 million mark in 2020.\n\nTHE LAGOS MEGACITY\n\nLagos, Nigeria’s lagoon city, Africa’s leading NEPAD City and World’s sixth megacity is a bourgeoning global urban agglomeration which attained megacity status in 1995 when its population soared to over 10 million people, per UN-Habitat. From its global city ranking of 31st in 1985, Lagos population exploded to 13.4 million in Y2000 to become world’s sixth megacity and Africa’s foremost urban centre and hub of national, regional and global socio-economic and political activities. The Megacity region, which approximates to 17 of the State’s 20 Local Government and 37 Local Council Development Areas and impinges imperceptibly on four local government areas of the adjoining Ogun State of Nigeria, is geographically disjointed [maze of islands/mainland], located on poor soil [wetlands] and overwhelmed by its growth [6% – 8% urbanization rate].\n\nPEOPLE\n\nLagos State is essentially a Yoruba environment inhabited by its sub-nationality of Aworis and Ogus in Ikeja and Badagry Divisions respectively, with the Ogus being found mainly in Badagry and the Awori forming the indigenous population of Lagos where there are, nevertheless, other pioneer immigrant settlers – Edos, Saros, Brazilians, Kannike/Tapa, etc collectively called Lagosians but more appropriately referred to as the Ekos. For Ikorodu and Epe Divisions, the local populations are mainly the Remos and Ijebus with pockets of Eko-Awori settlers along the entire State coastland and riverine areas. However, despite its Yoruba indigeneity, the State is a global socio-cultural melting pot attracting Nigerians, Africans and foreigners alike. The situation is attributable to its sound economic base, strategic maritime location and socio-political importance which induced a high rate of migration to the State.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE DIVISIONS [IBILE]\n\nWith a territorial land area of 351,861 hectares, Lagos State is made of five administrative divisions, namely: Ikeja, Badagry, Ikorodu, Lagos [Eko] and Epe. The divisions were created in May 1968 by virtue of Administrative Divisions [Establishment] Edict No. 3 of April 1968. The Divisions are further divided into 20 Local Governments and 37 Local Council Development Areas respectively, in accordance with Nigeria’s federal structure and the need to bring governance, development and participatory democracy to the grassroots.\n\nIKEJA\n\nIkeja Division, a predominantly Awori enclave and the cradle of its civilization, consists of eight local government authorities namely: Agege, Ifako-Ijaiye, Kosofe, Mushin, Alimosho, Oshodi-Isolo, Somolu and Ikeja which serves as both the seat of the State Government and the divisional headquarters. The LCDAs include Agbado/Oke-Odo, Agboyi-Ketu, Ayobo-Ipaja, Bariga, Egbe-Idimu, Ejigbo, Igando-Ikotun, Ikosi-Isheri, Isolo, Mosan-Okunola, Odi Olowo-Ojuwoye, Ojodu, Ojokoro, Onigbongbo and Orile Agege. Ikeja is the state capital and administrative center of Lagos State Government. The division has a concentration of both medium and large scale industries within the Mushin-Isolo-Oshodi and greater Ikeja industrial complex, while also having a large agricultural area in its rural Alimosho, Kosofe and Agege districts. A fledging Central Business District [Alausa/Agidingbi] and Nigeria’s biggest and busiest international airport [Murtala Mohammed Airport] are situated in the divisional headquarters, Ikeja. There are over fifty settlements in the division notable among which are: Isolo, Isheri-Oshun, Ikotun, Isheri-Olofin, Meiran, Ejigbo, Egan, Ketu, Ojota, Shangisha, Oworonshoki,Mushin, Abesan, Magodo, Egbe, Igando, Idimu, Ayobo, Iju, Ifako, Abule Egba, Agboyi, Ikosi, Okota, Somolu, Ipaja, Abesan, Abesan, Oregun, Isheri-Oke, Oshodi, Oke-Afa, Ojodu, Ogudu, Bariga, Ilupeju, Obanikoro, Akowonjo, Agege, Ijegun, Alagbado, Aboru, Olota, Ojokoro, Ikola, Ajasa, Baruwa, Ewu, Abule-Onigbagbo, Odi-Olowo, Shasha, Mende, Ipodo and Alimosho.\n\nBADAGRY\n\nBadagry Division is a zone of culture mix between the Ogu and Awori as well as an international border region. It consists of four Local Governments, including: Ojo, Amuwo-Odofin, Ajeromi-Ifelodun, and Badagry as well as six Local Council Development Areas namely: Iba, Ifelodun, Olorunda, Oriade, Badagry West and Oto-Awori. Badagry serves as the divisional headquarters. The Division enjoys a pride of place in Nigerian history, especially as regards early European contacts with West Africa. Being a coastal town on the western littoral, Badagry was a major slave outpost and market during the pre-colonial era and also the entry point of Christianity in Nigeria being the place where the Bible was first preached in 1842, under the Agia Tree. The original name of the town, Gbagi, a contraction of the word ‘Ogbagleme’ means a ‘farmland near the swamp’ in Ogu language. The word, ‘Ogbagleme’ was later coined to Agbadarigi by Yoruba settlers and later corrupted to Badagry by the Europeans. Major settlements in the Division include: Badagry, Ajara [a collection of villages], Iworo, Ajido, Akarakunmo, Gbaji, Aseri, Egan, Agonrin, Ahanve, Epe, Pota, Mowo, Itoga, Shibiri, Ekunpa, Aradagun, Kankon, Mosafejo, Gayingbo-Topa, Apa, Moba, Ropoji, Oranyan, Tafi-Awori, Yeketome, Pota, Seme, Iyagbe, Ajegunle, Aiyetoro, Festac Town and Satellite Towns, Iba, Kirikiri, Agboju-Amuwo, Okokomaiko, Ojo, Amukoko, Alaba-Oro, Ijofin, Igbanko, Imore, Ijegun, Ibeshe, Oto, Ijanikin, Ilogbo Eremi, Ilado, Abule-Ado and Odan Group of Villages [Soba, Onireke, etc].\n\nIKORODU\n\nIkorodu lies approximately 36 km north of Lagos and derives its name from ‘Oko-Odu’ meaning vegetable farm. This farmland was the first place where Oga, the crown prince of a Remo King and supposed founder of the town settled hence, the reference to the town as Ikorodu Oga. The Division consists of Ikorodu Local Govenment, and five Local Council Development Areas including: Igbogbo-Baiyeku, Ikorodu North, Ikorodu West, Imota and Ijede. By virtue of its location, the Division serves as the gateway to the country’s hinter-land. It is also an active commercial/energy center and national broadcasting gangway as the transmitters of the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria [FRCN], Voice of Nigeria [VON] and those of the State Broadcasting Corporation, [Radio Lagos/Eko F.M. and LTV], are located there.\n\nThe population of the Division consists of predominantly of the Ijebu and Remo groups that inhabit Ikorodu, Egbin, Igbogbo, Imota, Ijede, Maya Adio, Odogunyan, Isiu, Igbokuta, Ewu-Elepe, Baiyeku, Oreta, Ofin, Gberigbe, Erikorodo and Igbalu. However, along the riverine fringes of Ipakodo, Ibese, Ebute, Majidun, Itowolo, and other coastal communities, there is a strong presence of Eko-Awori population. The indigenes of Ikorodu Division are mostly traders and farmers with fishing thriving mostly along the Lagos Lagoon foreshore on the Cradoo [Ikorodu] Lake waterfront, Ipakodo, where a Nigerian Ports Authority Lighter Port Terminal is situated.\n\nLAGOS [EKO]\n\nThis is the core of Lagos State and a highly urbanized Division. It consists of five Local Government Councils, vis: Lagos Island, Lagos Mainland, Surulere, Apapa and Eti-Osa, as well as eight Local council development areas which include: Lagos Island East, Yaba, Itire-Ikate, Coker-Aguda, Ikoyi-Obalende, Apapa-Iganmu, Eti-Osa East and Iru/Victoria Island with the City of Lagos being the pivot of an ever expanding Megacity and the divisional headquarters. The center and the most developed of this island chain, Lagos Island, is called ‘Eko’ by the indigenes. The name ‘Lagos’ is a derivative of a Portuguese imposition of ‘Lagos de Curamo’ or ‘Rio Lago’ on account of its wetland topography and network of lagoons. The Island is the cultural watershed of the White Cap [Idejo] Chieftaincy and metropolitan Lagos with the Oba of Lagos as the paramount monarch and primus inter pares of the State traditional authorities.\n\nLagos is the chief commercial, financial and maritime nerve-center of Nigeria with seaports at Apapa, Tin Can Island, Roro Terminal Ports and Ijora Container Terminal. It has an ever-expanding Central Business Disrict in Tinubu and Victoria Island. As the economic capital and major port of Africa’s most populous nation, Lagos has attracted immigrants from all over Nigeria and beyond, as well as commercial entrepreneurs and industries from Africa, Europe, Asia and the Americas. Major settlements in the Division are: Tarkwa Bay, Victoria Island, Iru, Lagos Island, Ikoyi, Obalende, Oto, Ijora, Apapa, Ebute-Meta, Yaba, Ido, Sangotedo, Mayegun, Ogombo, Ogoyo, Okun-Ibeju, Moba, Alaguntan, Ado, Langbasa, Ilasan, Igbo-Efon, Ikota, Itire, Coker-Aguda, Ikate-Elegushi, Ajiran, Ilasan, Tomaro, Abagbo, Igbo-Ejo [Snake Island], etc.\n\nEPE\n\nThe Division is made up of two Local Government Councils, namely: Epe, Ibeju-Lekki while the three Local Council Development Areas are: Lekki, Ikosi-Ejirin and Eredo with Epe serving as the divisional headquarters. It lies about 89kms north-east of the City of Lagos. Urakaloye was the man reputed to be the ancestral founder of Epe, a name derived from black ants, which invaded Urakaloye’s hunting homestead. Hence, the town’s name, Epe, means the forest of black ants. Epe Division consists of Epe, Orugbo-Iddo, Agbowa-Ikosi, Ilara, Odo-Ayandelu, Odoragunsin, Igbooye, Naforija, Igbodu, Ejinrin, Poka, Itoikin, Idotun, Ita-Oko, Omi, Temu, Ise and Debojo. Others are Apawa, Aba-Titun, Abomiti, Afere, Apakin, Abalaye, Origanrigan, Kayetoro Eleko, Yeunda, Okunraye, Keta, Arapagi, Aiyeteju, Okun-Folu, Osoroko, Olomowewe, Ibeju, Lekki, Akodo, Otolu, Magbon-Alade, Oriba, Iwerekun, Iberekodo, Idado, Okun Igando-Orudu, Tiye, Awoyaya, Ote-Omi, Bogije, Siriwon, Idaso, Orimedu, Olorunkoya, Ojota, Ode-Ifa, Ofin, Igbesibi and Igbolomi, among others.\n\nA peculiar feature of Epe is the presence of a long range of hills, which demarcates the coastal town into equal parts. However, in Ibeju-Lekki, artisanal fishing, sandy beach and coconut fringed Atlantic coastlines are distinctive features of the environment which has enormous tourism potentials. Fishing and farming form the major occupations of the inhabitants of the Division, which also includes the Eko Aworis.\n\nLAGOS STATE ECONOMY\n\nLagos State plays a pivotal role in the Nigerian economy and as a nation’s commercial nerve centre, remains the focal point of economic activities. The Lagos Gross Domestic Product [GDP] accounted for 26.7% of Nigeria’s total GDP and more than 50% of non-oil GDP. Over 50% of Nigeria’s non-oil industrial capacity is located in Lagos. Lagos is also Nigeria’s financial hub with all major banks having their headquarters in the City. It is also home to the Nigerian Stock Exchange [NSE]. It accounts for over 80% of the country’s foreign trade flows, and generates over 50% of Nigeria’s port revenues. The estimated GDP of Lagos was put at N27.125trillion [$145.141billion] in 2016 by the Lagos Bureau of Statistics and is expected to rise to N628trillion [$157.728billion] by 2018 with projected average annual growth rate of 4.2% up to 2018. Lagos economy, with an estimated population of 24million is larger than any other economy in the ECOWAS sub-region despite the rebasing of Ghana’s GDP.\n\nFuelled by Public-Private investments, as well as an estimated population of over 24million, Lagos diverse economy is the leading contributor to Nigeria GDP. A 10% growth is expected in the local economy as the State plans to widen the tax base and improve collection methods to boost Local Tax Receipts towards at least NGN360bn by 2017 up from N200bn in 2012, edging towards 80% of annual revenues from 70% of income in the late 2000.\n\nLagos State remains the economic, financial and commercial nerve centre of Nigeria and the ECOWAS. Regionally, her Gross National Product [GNP] is three times that of any West African Country, thus making Lagos State ECOWAS economic hub and the springboard for innovation and development in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nLagos in Nigeria’s Economy\n\n29 Industrial Estates and 4 Central Business Districts [CBD]\n\nLargest market in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nHome of the Nigerian Capital and Money Market [Financial Hub]\n\nWest Africa Oil/Gas Pipeline Project and National Power/Energy Load Centre\n\nHome to Nigeria’s Chief Ports – Apapa & Tin Can Island [70% of total National cargo freight]\n\nMedia hub and international telecommunication gangway [over 50% of Nigeria’s PTO/GSM subscribers]\n\nLocation of Nigeria’s busiest international/regional aviation hub – Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja [over 70.61% of international and 58.30 % of domestic traffic]\n\nHome to 70% of the Country’s total industrial investment and 65% of its commercial activities.\n\nHighest Vehicular Density – over 222/km [National 11km]\n\nInternally Generated Revenue accounts for over 60% of State’s annual budget skewed in favour of capital expenditure.\n\nHome to over 200 financial institutions\n\nLagos in Africa’s Economy\n\nGNP, 3 times that of any West Africa Country [World Bank, 2001]\n\nHub of West/Central Africa Maritime and Aviation\n\nNode of West African Gas Pipeline Project\n\nNigeria’s Nexus of Trans-African Highway\n\nSub-Saharan African largest ICT Market\n\nLagos – The Financial Hub\n\nLagos State is the hub of Nigeria and West Africa’s regional financial system which is dominated by mega banks, insurance firms, micro-finance/community banks; discount houses; and the capital market. Indeed, the Nigerian Government’s vision 20:20:20 and the National Financial Sector Strategy [FSS] has envisioned Lagos as the nation’s financial hub with its automated headquarters of the Nigeria Stock Exchange, the largest and most active exchange in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, there exist The Investments and Securities Tribunal established by the Investments and Securities Act [ISA], 2007 to adjudicate on all capital market disputes.\n\nThe Lagos position as regional financial hub is acknowledged globally especially since ‘despite the relocation of the Central Bank of Nigeria’s [CBN] Headquarters to Abuja, Tinubu Square [Lagos Island Central Business District] still holds so much potential. As a further demonstration of this, Lagos State, as the gateway to Nigeria’s and ECOWAS economy, houses the headquarters/regional offices of national financial and professional regulatory authorities.\n\nState Vision: Making Lagos State Africa’s Model Megacity & Global Economic and Financial Hub\n\nState Policy Thrust: Poverty Eradication and Sustainable Economic Growth through Infrastructural Renewal and Development\n\nLagos State Development Plan: Consolidation of All High Policy Documents and Postulation of where Lagos will be by 2025\n\nPolicy Focus/Driving Values\n\nPublic-Private Partnership\n\nPrivate Sector-led Growth\n\nRule of Law, Transparency and Accountability\n\nGood Governance and Participatory Planning\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability\n\nGender and Socio-Cultural Sensitivity\n\nHuman Capital Development\n\nPolicy Documents\n\nLagos State Development Plan [LSDP] 2012-2025\n\nLagos Economic Survey Report, 2010, Lagos State Government/GDP\n\nLagos Household Survey Report, 2012, Lagos State Government\n\nReports of the Annual Lagos State Economic Summit [Ehingbeti] [7 Editions]\n\nTen-Point Agenda [TPA]\n\nLagos State Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy, [LASEEDS]\n\nLagos Local Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy, [LALEEDS]\n\nAnnual State Budget Estimates and Presentation Addresses\n\nMillennium Goals Report 2010 – 2011\n\nInvestment Opportunities in Lagos State, 2008\n\nProfile of Lagos NEPAD City, UN-Habitat/Lagos State Government, 2004\n\nState of Lagos Megacity and Other Nigerian Cities Report, 2004, Lagos State\n\nCore Investment Areas\n\nHousing [New Towns Development, Mortgage Financing, Site and Services Schemes]\n\nIntegrated Mass Transport System: Bus Rapid Transit, Light Rail/Metro-line, Ferry Services and Transport Terminals\n\nRefuse Collection and Waste Recycling Plants [Environment and Sanitation]\n\nPower Supply and Development [IPP and Gas Plants]\n\nRefineries and Petrochemicals\n\nWater Supply and Development [Mini/Micro Waterworks]\n\nTechnology Incubators/Business Parks\n\nAgro-industrial products [Coconuts, Citrus Fruits, Rice, Oil Palm, Maize and Fishery]\n\nWater Transportation [Ferry Services]\n\nCeramics and Glass manufacture\n\nInformation and Communication Technology [Digital Villages, Resource Centres]\n\nHealth Facility Improvement and Development\n\nCircular Roads/Bridges Development and Tolling\n\nTourism Development [180km Coastland/Waterfronts]\n\nDevelopment of Free Trade and Export Processing Zones [EPZ]\n\nPorts Development [Lekki, Ojo and Badagry]\n\nHeliport/Airport Development.\n\nSolid Minerals – Clay [Tiles, Blocks and Pottery]; Silica [Ceramics/Glass products]\n\nInvestment Incentives\n\nFiscal Measures\n\nThe Federal and State annual Appropriation Laws [Budget] provides a range of fiscal measures to encourage new investments and existing ones to maintain high capacity utilization.

In line with the extant law, the Policy thrust of Lagos State is to provide land at affordable rate with the provision of infrastructural facilities for residential, commercial, industrial, water front land and agricultural purposes. Leasehold interest of between 25-99 years with opportunity of renewal of such leases are usually created in respect of allocated land by the State.To ensure proper development of the State, well articulated Development Plans have been prepared to lay-out the following Government schemes for Residential, Commercial and Industrial purposes.\n\nList of Schemes\n\nGolden Jubilee Estate, Sangotedo, Lekki Ikorodu III\n\nSafe Court Garden, Ijanikin Mosafejo Aradagun\n\nValley View, Agbowa Ikorodu II\n\nRock View, Imota Orisan Waterfront\n\nOgudu Garden valley Amuwo Odofin [Residential]\n\nEwu- Elepe Amuwo Odofin [Commercial]\n\nLekki I Lekki II\n\nIsheri-North Abijo GRA\n\nFortune Garden Sunnyfield\n\nCrystal Ipaja/Alagba\n\nMagodo GRA Ikorodu II\n\nTo enhance effective and efficient implementation of the land policies, and also to ease the way of doing business in the State, land administration process has been computerized with the introduction of the Electronic Document Management Service [EDMS]. The Land Registry has been upgraded and restructured, and its business processes has also been reviewed tremendously. The laybout of the Lands Registry has been redesigned to ensure easy flow of processes and transactions which in turn leads t faster processing of documents. The work-flow interface with customers in all Directorates in Lands Bureau has been collapsed into four occasions: Applicant submits application – Applicant collects Demand Notice – Applicant submits revenue receipts – Applicant comes back to collect reistered title documents.\n\nThe State has created a new land allocation system for schemes such that it ensures easy access to allocated land and prompt issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy within 30 days of payment of all land charges. It has also embarked on the computerization of all processes with the aim of being fully ICT compliance in the nearest future.
