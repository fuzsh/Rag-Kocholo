        "text": "masinboko@gmail.com or call 08065388408 PREFACE Gombe state was lucky to have had Danjuma Goje. In 2003, Goje became the Governor with overwhelming support from the people. His government had no legitimacy crisis just as he also identified with the needs of the people. He embarked on massive developmental projects. Goje was a charismatic and selfless leader who did not allow private motive to dominate his public life and this automatically endeared him to the people. Goje not only informed, instructed but also persuaded the people to a common objective and the people willingly followed him, knowing that doing so was for their own good. Danjuma Goje was succeeded by former Accountant General of the Federation, Dr. Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo. There was no succession dispute and Goje lived up to expectation as he did not disappoint either his successor or the people. Goje laid a solid foundation for other leaders in Gombe to build on. Goje is an exemplary, visionary, selfless, courageous and a transformational leader. When he was in power in the western region, some of his numerous achievements include establishment of Gombe state University, School of Nursing and Mid-wife, Federal University Kashere, Gombe State Transport Corporation, Gombe State International Airport later renamed as Sani Abacha International Airport, Ultra-Modern Pantami Township Stadium, Gombe International Hotel, provision of safe, clean and portable water, constant and stable electricity, creation of 9000 jobs, construction and renovation of over 200 schools as well as free and compulsory primary education, roads networks among others.As we have pointed out earlier, the singular job of a leader is to lead which implies giving the people the vision that is needed for them to move from where they are to where they ought to be. Leadership is a herculean task but it is possible only for those who understand the nitty-gritty that is involved in it.\n\nPolitical leadership can be a crucial ingredient for the development of sub-Saharan Africa. The region has been going through important transformations, with both political landscapes and economic trajectories becoming increasingly diverse. The changes underway include the role of leadership and its broader impact. This volume argues that, on the whole, African leaders and the way they reach power generally do contribute to shaping their countries&#39; progresses and achievements. It also zooms in on some influential African leaders who recently emerged in key states across the continent, illustrating and explaining the individual paths that brought them to power while reflecting on the prospects for their governments&#39; actions. Far from the simplistic stereotypes of immovable, ineffective and greedy rulers, the resulting picture reveals dynamic and rapidly evolving political scenarios with key implications for development in the region.\n\nThis book Politics, Governance and Development in Africa is fascinating in many ways. It is based on African case studies. Many of the case studies are recent. It is based on field research and many of contributors are experienced research and scholars from across the globe. Many development partners are increasingly calling for good politics, guided by democratic principles. Countries which have good and smooth transition in Africa such as Botswana, Ghana, South Africa and Zambia also tend to make great strides in development. Good governance is obtained under efficient, accountable and transparent structures and institutions. Readers will be fascinated with this book Politics, Governance and Development in Africa because it covers new ground in the understanding of politics and governance dynamics and how they affect development in Africa. There is a recent realization that many of the development challenges in Africa would be a thing of the past if politics were managed properly. On the other hand, we need proper governance structures and institutions in order to manage public affairs efficiently and in more transparent and accountable manner. The arguments advanced in this book is that Africa needs good, positive and development politics and not grandstanding and antagonistic politics played out along ethnic or religious lines. What is missing in many studies is the linkage between politics and governance, which this books has done through myriad of articles presented here. Readers will be excited to read about examples from many parts of the world, with a call for fair politics and good structures and institutions of governance. This book is a useful addition to knowledge on politics and governance in Africa and is useful for all libraries where learners are studying Africa, and for all students and scholars who study Africa. It is relevant for humanities, arts and social sciences.\n\nIn today’s democracies, citizens, elect individuals to represent them, a concept known as delegated power. However, a crisis of confidence seems to emerge between citizens and existing governance systems and the leadership. This paper explores “Africa`s Development” from an African democracy context and interrogates its successes as well as challenges. A description of pre-colonial and post-colonial forms of governance paths are postulated with their key set-ups. To augment this, the traditional, social and political governance systems as well as international institutions and their implications on African development have been expounded. Further, a characterization of contemporary African democracy alongside its key features is featured with a comparative analysis with best practice examples. A raft of common approaches are advanced that can be employed to put Africa on its right development path."
