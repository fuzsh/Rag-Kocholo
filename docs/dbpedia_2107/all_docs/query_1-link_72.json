        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nBovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a chronic infectious and contagious zoonotic disease of domestic animals, wild animals and humans [1]. It also occurs in a wide range of mammalian species [2]. It is characterized by the formation of granulomas in tissues, especially in the lungs, lymph nodes, liver, intestines and kidney [3]. Tuberculosis is a major health problem with 8–9 million new cases and 3 million deaths annually worldwide [4]. The majority of these occur in the developing nations. In Nigeria, there have been limited studies to determine the prevalence or relationship between bovine and human TB, especially with the emerging culture of eating improperly cooked beef and mutton, along with the drinking of unpasteurized fresh milk [5]. According to a previous study, an economic loss of N13, 871,014/annum due to bovine tuberculosis (7.95%) as a result of condemnations in some abattoirs in -Nigeria has been reported [6]. Another study reported an annual socioeconomic loss of N14-24 million/annum because of carcass condemnation in the abattoirs in Northeastern, Nigeria [7].\n\nBovine tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium bovis which is a member of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex [8], [9]. The organism may be transmitted by aerosol or droplets of exudates containing the bacilli. It can be transmitted by ingestion of feed and water contaminated with urine, faecal material or exudates that contain the tubercle bacilli from diseased animals [10].\n\nIn developing countries, especially Nigeria and particularly the northeastern region, there is paucity of information on the prevalence of bTB and though, it is a notifiable disease in many countries, the lack of effective disease surveillance and disease reporting system and the insidious nature of the disease has contributed to decreased recognition and reporting, leading to a lack of effective and sustainable measures for its control. This study was therefore conducted to determine the prevalence of bTB in Gombe, Northeastern Nigeria [11].\n\nThe actual impact of animal bTB on human health is generally considered low in developing countries like Nigeria which may be based on the rare identification of Mycobacterium bovis isolates from human patients [12]. However, zoonotic bTB is present in most developing countries where surveillance and control activities are often inadequate or unavailable [13]. The human cases of tuberculosis associate with M. bovis infection, both pulmonary and extra pulmonary have been described in Nigeria [14], [15], [16]. From the limited survey conducted in Nigeria, on life tissues and lymph nodes of cattle from abattoirs and slaughterhouses have yielded M. bovis in majority of cases with few other Mycobacteria such as M. tuberculosis and M africanum as occasional findings [16]. Nigeria is one of the African countries where bTB is widespread in both cattle and human [17]. This research will contribute in providing epidemiological data of bTB in Gombe Township Abattoir for epidemiological surveillance, baseline for academics and improving veterinary education, and human and animal health.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe importance and impact of meat inspection as diagnostic and preventive tool in our local abattoirs cannot be overemphasized. Apart from the provision of epidemiological information on life threatening zoonotic diseases of meatborne origin, such as the bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis, and other toxicoinfections. It also provides standards, ensures hygienic and wholesome meat free from infections and other toxicoses of inorganic sources (including heavy metals and chemicals used in Nigerian abattoirs/meat processing industries, like the use of vehicle tyres in burning carcasses). Thus, this study also aimed at determining the sensitivity and reliability of meat inspection as preventive tool and vital source of epidemiological data, surveillance and monitoring of meatborne zoonotic diseases like bTB, if proper records keeping would be ensured in our abattoirs.\n\nThe reason for the lower prevalence (0.34%) in 2011 found in this study may be attributed to high number of cattle slaughtered together with low number of bTB recorded during that particular year. This may also be attributed to the sources of the animals and limited access to the former source (Maiduguri axis) of animals for slaughter and majority of the animals were from the Adamawa and Cameroon border that might have less prevalence of the disease as reported before [22].\n\nThe results indicate the highest prevalence (1.04%) of bTB in 2015. This may be due to breach in public health measures and a resultant escalating activity of insurgency – “Boko Haram” in the northeastern states (Borno, Yobe, and Chad). The political tension in the country had contributed to the movement of the herdsmen/nomadic difficult which gave favorable condition for the spread of bTB among cattle due to increase in contacts, overcrowding and malnutrition as potential risk factors of the disease.\n\nThe overall (2008–2015) prevalence rates of 0.78% obtained in this study for bTB was lower than the previous studies conducted in the same Gombe Town by Adang et al. [23] who reported a prevalence of 26.60% using postmortem confirmed by histopathology; Madaki et al. [24] who reported a prevalence of 18.33% using lateral flow technique; and Salisu et al. [25] who reported a prevalence of 15.53% using lateral flow. These disparities could be due to lower sensitivity of the meat inspection procedure compared to detailed PM examinations, histopathology or culture of the tubercle lesions, different techniques and time frame used in the various studies. These are not unrelated with the fact that the prevalence rate recorded in this retrospective study may be an underestimation of the true prevalence prospectively.\n\nHowever, a retrospective studies conducted by Aliyu et al. and Abubakar et al. [22], [26] revealed a relatively higher prevalence of 12.27% in Gombe State as compared to the findings in this study. This could be due to an improved awareness and herd health management practices among the herdsmen and other animal rearers in the vicinity [27].\n\nThe findings of 1202(0.78%) bTB suspected lesions and total prevalence rates, among the slaughtered cattle examined at the State abattoir had emphasized the importance of PM meat inspection as a vital tool for detecting and reducing some zoonotic diseases of public health importance like bTB. Bovine TB became an endemic problem in Gombe and Nigeria at large [22], [27], [28]. This agreed with the report of Cadmus et al. [29], as post-mortem examination still remains the immediate diagnostic tool to be used in endemic slaughter houses and abattoirs in the states of Nigeria. However, the records based on the abattoir meat inspection (recorded as bTB cases over time), may provide significantly underestimated figures of the true prevalence of the disease under study, taking into account the possibilities of missing data, paucity of information, and lack of sustainable surveillance and disease reporting network. Nevertheless, the obtainable data recorded in this work were from the NADIS/AU-IBAR report books from the State Area Veterinary Office with accuracy and could be used as a baseline epidemiological information of the disease in that region as well as being useful for academic purpose.\n\nThe disease also had seasonality trend as a risk factor that confounded the occurrence of the disease in the region. This is in line with the pathophysiology and immunology of the bTB as a chronic one with a delayed hypersensitivity that could be manifested in rainy season due to associated immunocompromization. According to previous reports, there is also a seasonal related increase in the prevalence of bTB in the Northern parts of the country [30], [31]. It has also been speculated that, season has a significant influence of bTB in the northeastern region of Nigeria; they explained that, Fulani herdsmen brought their cattle to the southern part of Nigeria to graze and move back up north once the rain begins, and that possibly, these cattle might have acquired the infection before coming to the south as latent bTB [32]."
