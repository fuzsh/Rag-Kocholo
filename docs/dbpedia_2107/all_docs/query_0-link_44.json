Leaders > President > Profile <p>Goodluck Jonathan inherited the presidency in May 2010 on the death of his predecessor, and went on to win elections in April 2011.</p> <p>International observers gave the 2011 elections their general approval. Other elections since the end of military rule in 1999 have been widely condemned for state-sponsored manipulation.</p> <p>However, the announcement of the results was followed by violence in the northern stronghold of his main opponent, General Muhammadu Buhari.</p> <p>The election results revealed a geographical divide, with Mr Jonathan scoring well in the predominantly Christian south, and Gen Buhari sweeping many of the Muslim-dominated northern states.</p> <p>Mr Jonathan was elected as vice-president to Umaru Yar&#039;Adua in 2007, and had to serve as acting president as Mr Yar&#039;Adua&#039;s health declined.</p> <p>Mr Jonathan has expressed his commitment to fighting corruption. In November 2011, he sacked the head of the country&#039;s anti-corruption agency, accusing her of not doing enough to tackle the problem.</p> <p>The increasing militancy of the northern-based radical Islamist group Boko Haram has also proved to be a major headache for the president. After a series of bloody attacks on Christmas Day 2011, Mr Jonathan vowed that the government would do all in its power to bring the perpetrators to justice. </p> <p>Despite this, in 2012 more than 600 people were killed in attacks blamed on Boko Haram, and President Jonathan went on to declare a state of emergency in three northern states and deploy a large number of troops in May 2013.</p> <p>Mr Jonathan was born in 1957 in Bayelsa, a state in the oil-rich Niger Delta. Unlike his predecessor, who was a Muslim from the northern Katsina state, he is a Christian from the south.</p> <p>After studying zoology at university, he worked as an education inspector, lecturer and environmental protection officer before going into politics in 1998.</p> <p>Elected deputy governor of his native Bayelsa state in 1999, he was promoted when the governor was impeached on corruption charges in 2005.</p> <p>Two years later, he was hand-picked to be Mr Yar&#039;Adua&#039;s running mate in the 2007 election, which the ticket won amid allegations of widespread vote-rigging.</p> <p>Barack Obama, a Democrat and America&#039;s first black president, was re-elected for a second term in November 2012 after a bitterly-fought campaign against Republican challenger Mitt Romney.</p> <p>The Democrats kept control of the Senate and the Republicans remained in control of the House of Representatives, leading to political gridlock in Congress on the budget in late 2013.</p> <p>The campaign focused on the ailing US economy. In his inaugural speech in January 2013, Mr Obama called on Democrats and Republicans to work together to sustain the country&#039;s fragile economic recovery. He also pledged an end to &quot;ten years of war&quot;, signalling the departure of US troops from Afghanistan in 2014.</p> <p>First term challenges</p> <p>The worst economic crisis in the US since the Great Depression of the 1930s dominated much of Mr Obama&#039;s first term. The president pursued an aggressive policy of economic stimulus, including bail-outs of major car makers.</p> <p>He made reform of the healthcare system to extend coverage and reduce ballooning costs one of his top domestic priorities.</p> <p>Despite a tortuous drafting process and vociferous Republican opposition, Mr Obama and Democrats in Congress finally succeeded in passing a health care bill in March 2010.</p> <p>However, the health reform, along with the $787bn stimulus package passed in February 2010 to shore up an ailing economy, galvanised opposition among opponents to Mr Obama&#039;s agenda.</p> <p>The American Right in particular worried about what it saw as moves to extend the role of the state in the economy, and the threat of excessive public debt.</p> <p>Tea Party boost for Republicans</span> <p>The rise of the conservative Tea Party movement in 2009 re-energised the Republicans and helped them to capitalise on popular discontent at the slow pace of America&#039;s economic recovery.</p> <p>The Republicans made sweeping gains in mid-term elections in November 2010, regaining control of the House of Representatives.</p> <p>In autumn 2011 anti-capitalist protestors took to the streets of major cities, marching under the slogan &quot;Occupy Wall Street&quot;, against &quot;corporate greed&quot; and increasing government debt. The protests inspired marches in other cities worldwide in October 2011.</p> <p>Bin Laden operation</span> <p>In May 2011, Mr Obama was widely applauded domestically - including by the Right - for his decision to order the operation that killed Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. </p> <p>Barack Obama was born in 1961 in Hawaii, the son of a black Kenyan father and a white American mother. After attending an elite Hawaiian academy and Columbia University in New York, he went on to Harvard Law School, where he graduated in 1991.</p> <p>Mr Obama practiced law and did community work in Chicago, where he also became active in the Democratic Party. He won a seat in the Illinois state senate in 1996, and followed this up by winning a US Senate seat in 2004.</p> <p>He emphatic victory over his opponent John McCain in the 2008 presidential election ended eight years of Republican rule in the White House.</p> <p>Mr Obama ran for president on a ticket promising change, and came to office riding a wave of high expectations from his supporters, both at home and abroad.</p> <p>He is widely acknowledged to be a charismatic figure and is noted for his stirring oratory. </p> Role of head of state Executive Executive General government final > Consumption expenditure > Current US$ per capita 149.67$\n\nRanked 88th. 6,299.75$\n\nRanked 14th. 42 times more than Nigeria Democracy > Presidential elections > Registered voter turnout 52.3%\n\nRanked 79th. 67.4%\n\nRanked 55th. 29% more than Nigeria Start-up procedures to register a business > Number 9\n\nRanked 97th. 80% more than United States 5\n\nRanked 154th.
