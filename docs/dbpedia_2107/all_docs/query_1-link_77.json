        "text": "The much-publicised nationwide protest against bad governance began across states of the federation on Thursday in different magnitudes and dimensions.\n\nThe protest with hashtag #EndBadGovernanceinNigeria is planned to end on 10 August.\n\nIt is aimed at calling Federal Government’s attention to the economic hardship facing Nigerians.\n\nMost states experienced the gathering of protesters, empty roads, deserted markets, malls, shops and heavy presence of security operatives.\n\nHowever, the protest’s momentum differed across states with some recording peaceful protests, some others minor violence and others remarkable violence with loss of lives and vandalism.\n\nIn Lagos, the protest, which held at the Peace Park and the Gani Fawehinmi Freedom Park were peaceful and recorded large turnouts.\n\nSecurity personnel exhibited professionalism and escorted the protesters.\n\nA Lagos State High Court had, on Tuesday, restricted the protest to the state to the two parks.\n\nAlso, in Ogun, the protest was peaceful, with security agents, including the police and personnel of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, giving protesters protection.\n\nIn Abuja, hundreds of #EndBadGovernanceinNigeria protesters blocked the Abuja-Keffi Expressway, demanding end to bad governance in the country.\n\nThe protesters caused gridlock, forcing motorists to take alternative routes.\n\nThey burnt tyres at various points near Orange Market, a hitherto busy place.\n\nThere were counter-protesters, opposing the #EndBadGovernance protest.\n\nThe counter-protesters, also large in number, carried placards with inscriptions such as “We want peace in FCT”, “FCT is for development” , “We don’t want protests’’.\n\nIn Plateau, a former Minister for Youth and Sports Development, Solomon Dalung, and Isa El-buba, a Christian cleric, were among the protesters in Jos.\n\nThe protesters, largely youths, matched on major streets of Jos, chanting solidarity songs.\n\nIn Borno, the police said Boko Haram elements infiltrated protesters on Baga Road in Maiduguri, killing four persons, while 34 others suffered various degrees of injuries.\n\nThe state Commissioner of Police, Yusuf Lawal, said many minors, mostly almajiris, took over the Maiduguri-Kano Road, vandalising public property.\n\nHe said in spite of police persuasion, the crowd turned riotous, forcefully breaking police barriers, pelting stones at officers and advancing toward the city centre.\n\nThe violence compelled imposition of 24 hours curfew on Maiduguri by the state government.\n\nIn Kano, hoodlums armed with various weapons took to the streets in parts of Kano metropolis, attacking shops and offices and looting property.\n\nThey hoodlums were seen carting away office furniture, air conditioners and metal signboards.\n\nThe state Governor, Abba Yusuf, imposed a 24-hour curfew on Kano following the violence and massive looting.\n\nThe Digital Industrial Park of the Nigerian Communications Commission Office in Kano is among public property vandalised.\n\nHoodlums also vandalised offices in Kaduna State during the #EndBadGovernanceinNigeria protest.\n\nThe vandalised places include the premises of the Kaduna State Traffic and Law Environmental Authority and Investment Promotions Agency.\n\nThe protesters also burnt police Armoured Personnel Carrier and attempted to invade the Kaduna State Government House, according to ASP Mansir Hassan, the spokesperson for the police command in the state.\n\nIn Sokoto, hundreds of youth barricaded major streets in Sokoto metropolis as well as the state Government House, chanting protest songs.\n\nThey held placards with different inscriptions, calling on the Federal Government to re-introduce fuel subsidy and revert the Naira exchange rate to N400 per U.S. dollar.\n\nHowever, a combined team of security operatives prevented them entry into the government house.\n\nIn Gombe, shop owners and traders in major markets joined hired vigilantes and hunters in securing their shops against vandals.\n\nThe traders, vigilantes and hunters barricaded major entry and exit points at the markets.\n\nSome of the barricaded places are Gombe Main market, Gombe Local Government Shopping Centre and the Old Market.\n\nIn Delta, the protest turned violent about 11. 20.a.m. when suspected thugs began to attack and disperse protesters.\n\nThe suspects also attacked four journalists.\n\nThe journalists are those from Punch, The Guardian and Pointer reporters and an Asaba-based investigative journalist.\n\nIn Niger State, at least four persons died due to the protest.\n\nAbubakar Muti of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps confirmed in Minna that the deaths occurred in Suleja.\n\n“We have confirmed the death of four persons so far, although an unconfirmed report is saying that the death toll has risen to eight,” he said.\n\nMr Muti said trouble started when some youth tried to vandalise public property in the area during the protest, prompting security agencies to mobilise to defend the facilities.\n\nThe police in the state also apprehended 11 protesters for allegedly burning a part of Tafa Local Government Secretariat and looting valuables.\n\nThe command’s spokesperson, Waisu Abiodun, a superintendent of police, said in Minna that the suspects also burnt two vehicles and vandalised two others.\n\nIn Edo, some hoodlums infiltrated protesters and looted bags of rice loaded in a truck at Urora community in Ikpoba-okha Local Government of Edo.\n\nThe truck was parked on an untarred road through which protesters marched.\n\nIn Nasarawa, 50 protesters were apprehended in four local government areas for allegedly causing breakdown of law and order and attacking police personnel.\n\nRamhan Nansel, Police Public Relations Officer in the state, said 25 suspects were arrested in Lafia, 16 in Karu, six in Keffi and three at Mararaba Udege of Nasarawa council area.\n\nHowever, in Ekiti, the residents shunned the protest by adopting a sit-at-home approach.\n\nIn Ado-Ekiti and other major towns such as Ikole-Ekiti, Oye-Ekiti, Ikere-Ekiti and Emure-Ekiti, the residents largely failed to participate in protests.\n\nMajor roads were empty and the general atmosphere was peaceful at the time of this report.\n\nOffices, shops and markets were deserted, while many civil servants stayed at home for fear of uncertainties.\n\nIn Kwara, the residents also ignored the protest. As at 11:00a.m., no protesters were seen in Ilorin as residents were going about their daily activities.\n\nSecurity agents were seen in front of Kwara Government House and Central Bank of Nigeria office.\n\nBanks and shops were opened for businesses as security agents patrolled major roads.\n\nAlso in Enugu, the residents shunned the protest and stayed indoors while many malls and shops in the state capital were locked.\n\nThe roads were empty while the coal city remained calm, prompting the police command in the state to laud the residents for peace.\n\nREAD ALSO: Police may join forces with military to block violent protest Police IG\n\nIn Cross River, socio-economic activities were on standstill although there was no visible sign of protest as of the time of the report.\n\nPolice personnel were seen in large numbers patrolling roads in the state capital, Calabar, while vanks, markets and other businesses places were closed."
