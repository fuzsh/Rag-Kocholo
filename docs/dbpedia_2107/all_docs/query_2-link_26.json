        "text": "The Mosaics Against Goje: Gombe 2007 Race for Gubernatorial Election\n\nBy\n\nU.K. Umar\n\nKumbia Kumbia Qtrs. Gombe\n\nuukada@yahoo.com\n\nThe Mosaics against Goje: Gombe 2007 Race for Gubernatorial Election By U.K Umar Kumbia Kumbia Qtrs. Gombe Politics is played most beautifully when separated from bitterness. This is to unquote the legendary politician Late Alhaji Waziri Ibrahim of the then GNPP. These are my words in presenting this piece to the people of Gombe. I have made this my introduction because of those who for one reason or the other might misunderstand the pattern I play. Mine here, is to speak the truth and nothing but the truth. Therefore, my first prayer is to be counted among those who have eyes that see, as opposed to those who in foolishness close their eyes, or in arrogance switch off the light of divine guidance. Let me therefore begin, for the sake of argument and without prejudice to the possibility of returning to this point later, by pleading guilty to all the charges that may be leveled against me as a person. I have in so many of my write-ups indicated the possibilities and willingness of Gojes Administration to perform not just because of the enormous elitists opposition surrounding him; and not simply because He knew very well how He mounted the throne, but because He has divinely been assigned and tagged as the Messiah of the time. These are facts that no one can deny and whichever parametric tool one intends to use in order to measure and define the extent of Gojes successes, particularly on initiating and executing infrastructure development and people oriented projects, such an individual is bound to fail and be short of substance to illustrate how these numeric achievements comes about. The claim that the Governor uses the Local Government funds to carry out his projects is a fabricated one because the Government of Gombe State by a valid federal statistics, is among the best three in the whole country that is transparent in handling the Joint Local Governments funds and even if the allegation is true, the end justifies the means. Perhaps, these track records were what won for the State the current seat of the Federations Accountant-General. Prior to the democratic dispensation, we had Milads and Sole Administrators for the State when the local government funds flowed under the total control of military Administrators dictatorship, but there were no remarkable achievements. What then, can one say, happened to those vanished funds? It is unfortunate that majority of the populace cannot see the slight difference between a mishap and a disaster. The reason is on the general inflation in the country that is so tragic, inflicting untold hardships to the citizen which was a result of so many factors not necessarily associated with the leadership style in Gombe but the common belief to a layman is that -Goje has to share the blame. It is a remarkable achievement, even though infrastructural developments alone do not guarantee an end to poverty. This should be food for thought to all my people. Some still point accusing-fingers to the Governor on the sour relationship that exists between him and the political class in the State. Laying claim that there was lack of peace. My understanding is that the type of peace that guarantee growth in a democratic environment, is one that allow for mutual coexistence among the organs of government on one hand and the smooth running of government daily business on the other. It is not however, measured by the mere hangover of political antecedents as insinuated by these aggrieved persons. Of course, every political group has its own motive regarding its opponent. This is a common technique in politics; otherwise the winner will not be allowed to lead. The former Government seemed to fight the feudal class of Gombe emirate using all mechanisms to destabilize the emirate and when Goje came he launched a counter attack.  Who do you blame? Every one like I said has purpose, and above all, this does not concern the poor, down trodden or the neglected class. The concern of the common man is education, medical facilities, drinking water, good roads and electricity. This present government has averagely attended to all these factors. If however, a traditional ruler is carelessly removed and replaced by his brother, uncle or cousin, it is up to the families to reconcile among themselves, afterall the dividend still goes to the family circle. It does not in any way affect the peace of the people living in that particular area. In the Jihad days, when people were under the leadership of kings and emirs with strict adherence to the rule of law bonded by faith, people could go to war if a kingdom is attacked. Those were days when the traditional rulers take full charge.\n\nThis is one man whose spitefulness adjudged his muamalats nevertheless, demonstrated equity, fairness and distributive justice in the appointments to key positions of His administration. His, is about the only administration in Gombe since its creation that has so far carried on board all the constituents indigenous tribes as part and parcel of his core administration. According to a recent survey, the rankings of the participation of the various tribal groups in Gombe follow thus: Fulani (25%); Hausa/Kanuri (25%); Tera/Bolawa (25%); Tangale/Waja (20%); Others (5%). Looking at the distribution above, one can see that the Governor himself hails within the lowest category and this goes to show that Goje did not invite his family folks or tribe to come and exploit booty-so-found, unlike the crews that have passed over time. Some still, could say was due to short genealogy, but whatever the interpretation, it is a credit score. Considering the above and the fast ticking clock of 2007 race, it is about time to reflect on those persons who in some quarters indicated various interests in the game. The people of Gombe should open their eyes to choose the best out of those that may be paraded during the race; persons of integrity whom against all odds can perform like Goje, at least or even better, in case Goje is not predestine to make a come back or still, if changing hands for political position is better than perpetuating a single person to a particular seat of power. For now, most of the seeming aspirants except few that are not yet known to the political scenario have in one capacity or the other demonstrated their inability to deliver, both at home along family line, places of work or to the country at large. Those were mostly, people that exhibited themselves to have political Godfathers either in Minna or elsewhere in the country and such type of people should be regarded as sub standards, because the politics of Godfatherism is nothing but a politics of complex and lack of ingenuity to prove oneself before the electorate. If one has to marathon in-between the Minna-Hills simply to retain a minister-ship position or seek a human favour, forgetting the very existence of his creator, then, it is really unfortunate and such a person is hopeless, deluded and have clearly demonstrated his inability to perform especially, in his capacity as a minister much less of being a Governor. We in Gombe are not ready to be in the situation in which the Ngiges and the Ubas of Anambra found themselves.\n\nPlease vacate the race.\n\nWonders shall never end! This is usually an exclamation, preceded by clapping of hands to emphasize the magnitude of bewilderment or astonishment. The situation has made mouth agape, women standing akimbo and men resting their two clutched hands on their chest alongside the streets of Gombe metropolis. All these are nothing but manifestations of surprise. This time around, the people of Gombe could not believe it when one of the seeming aspirants suddenly dropped his Special Assistant who is an in-law to the State Governor not for lack of merit, performance or a twitch of subdued disloyalty but in readiness to wear boxing globes to face the battlefield squarely. Some say that the action was in preparation to the 2007 game, which he feels so vulnerable working with the in-law to the Governor, in times when the battle line had been drawn and therefore, needs to maximise his secrets in a bid to use the famous Abuja-based five-planners, who claimed the victory of the 2003 Gubernatorial election, to uproot the incumbent. Whether the planners will agree to give him their maximum support is one thing, and if given, the chances of making the journey is another thing, because one-third of these planners may equally be warming up for the race.

Other reliable sources also say that one of the reasons for this aggrieved action was because of the S.As intention to study L.L.M at the Jos University, in case the master happened to be swept away by the Obasonjo cabinet re-shuffle. This shattered his trust on the S.A and people regarded it as callous because, no excuses appear convincing enough to justify the action of the master. Take the last act, rather sensational: If a servant makes investment for himself against the mere fall of his master, will it be right for the servant to be punished? What about a farmer who detect drought during his weather focus and decides to hoard his stuff against the embarrassment of hunger during the next season? Will he be said to have committed a sin? My conviction is that unless professional performance, value-ethics and culture-orientation are compromised our leaders have duty to provide for posterity a moral compass to guide our conduct in the society. Let us embrace the freedom God has given to us in our choices and stop being pettish. This single act garners a great disservice to the masters credibility. In conclusion, I am pleased to say, at the risk of sounding arrogant (which I can very well afford since I have pleaded to the charge of being guilty of arrogance), objective advice is what anyone who aspires to be an intellectual voter must employ.\n\nSubjective ones are for the intellectually challenged."
