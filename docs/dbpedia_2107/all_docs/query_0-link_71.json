        "text": "Boni Haruna: An Emerging Emperor\n\nBy\n\nJauro Garry Maigaskiya\n\njauwro@gmail.com\n\nAmongst the people of the old Fombina (to which the present Adamawa State was part), the elders admonished the younger ones with the famous saying  the extent to which the elder sees, a toddler can never see, even if he climbs a tree; meaning what the wise may forecast, may not be apparently clear to the younger ones.\n\nEarly in the life of the present administration in Adamawa State, sometimes in 2000, a business associate, friend and mentor visited from Europe as a member of his regional trade mission, to explore business opportunities in our country, Nigeria. While Adamawa State was never in his iternary, I jokingly asked him why they did not include my state, Adamawa, in their programme. Laughingly, he said to me that their business intelligence report at that time showed that there might be nothing forthcoming from that area in term of business opportunities to be tapped! They only consider serious areas. I, however, challenged him, and reminded, him that the Vice-President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is from that State, and was in fact, the Governorelect, before doling out the stool to the present Governor, Mr. Boni Haruna. And I said to him, my friend, knowing the VP well, as I used to know him, he might request them to visit the state to explore areas that might be of mutual interest to the visitors and the state.\n\nAnd it turned out that the VP, after the courtesy call on him, truly requested my friend, even if he alone, to visit Adamawa! A private plane was arranged for him to go to Yola, the state capital, where he had a meeting with His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Adamawa, Boni Haruna (Makaman Mubi).\n\nMy friend never came back to Abuja to tell me what transpired in Yola, or what was the outcome of the visit or what was the way forward. He simply admonished us to watch out; an empire may emerge from that area (Adamawa)! He predicted that someone will turn the state into an empire, and nothing meaningful and worthy of contributing to the welfare of the citizenry will come out of those he met and those in charge of that beautiful state (to use his words).\n\nI never took his words and prediction serious until one looks at the situation now. Simply put, Adamawa, as it is now, is an emerging empire, with Boni Haruna as the emerging Emperor! Whether this emerging empire will nurture itself into a full empire before 2007 and beyond, or crumble before then, only God can determine.\n\nEvery action of Boni Haruna depicts a typical emperor-like behaviour and character. I know his apologist may call me names; term me as one of the paid agents of destabilization; or even declare me an enemy of the State. But this is a reality and it is there for everyone who cares to check and find out for himself.\n\nAdamawa is bedeviled with so much backwardness, while almost everything required to make it great is available in abundance. Be it human resources or otherwise. A look at a list of who is who in the State tells it all that the state is endowed with great human resources (Intellectuals, businessmen, administrators etc), amongst other resources. There is Paul Wampana (Vice-Chair PDP NE), Jubril Aminu (Professor, Senator & fmr Ambassador), Bamanga Tukur ( Ex-Gov & Minister), Mahmud Tukur (PhD & fmr Minister), Nuhu Ribadu ( Chair EFCC), Ricky Tarfa ( the only SAN from the state), Danladi Zakari (Rtd Gen. & Ex-MILAD), Ibrahim B.M. Haruna (Rtd Gen.), Ednah Aleiyedenoh, A. Bawa Garba (ABG), Paul C. Tarfa (Rtd Gen), Muhammadu Gambo Jimeta (Fmr IG), Dahiru Bobbo, (DG National Boundary Commission), Chriestie Miyada, Buba Marwa (Rtd Gen and chair Albarka Airlines), Gidado Tahir ( Prof & Exec Sec UBE), HamaTukur Saad (Prof & VC FUT Minna), Adamu Modibbo (Ex-Bank Chief), Bashiru Tukur (Fmr MD & Banker), Inuwa Bakari (fmr Minister), Michal Bongi, Bala Zakari (Chairman and Insurance guru), Musa Bello (Kaduna Mafia), Maxwell Gidado (Presidential Asst), Kwairanga Jada (Bank Chief), Sallau Gidado (Business Mogul), Modibbo Hamidu (Investment Guru), Umaru Modibbo (Stocks Guru) Boss Mustapha (Administrator), Zainab Maina (NCWS),Fati Balla (Ambassador), Dijatu Balla (Educationist), Fibi Nada (Educationist), Nathaniel Yaduma (Presidential Assistant) Ahmed Joda (Ex-Super Perm Sec, Technocrat and one time Most Indebted Individual in Nigeria! Yes.), Lawal Bello (Ex-Chair M-Tel), Murtala Nyako (Rtd Gen and President Farmers), Adamu Bello (Agric Minister), A. Y. Ribadu (Prof & VC FUTY), Musa Yakubu (Bank Chief & Lawyer of Repute), Aliyu Kama (Rtd Gen and ex-Gov), Hananiya Haladu ( Rtd Gen & FRSC Boss), but to mention a few.\n\nThe list could go on and on. Each of these men and women mentioned above are either ex-this, ex-that or currently hold one position or another in the country.\n\nIt could be recalled that during Shehu Shagaris first year in office, 1979, indigenes of the present Adamawa held sway in the nations security portfolio, with Professor Iya Abubakar (Defense Minister), Gibson S. Jalo ( Army Chief), Abdullahi Dominic Bello (Air force Chief) and late Adamu Suleiman (Inspector General of Police).\n\nWhy has Boni failed to bring these great men and women, gentlemen and women together to move the state forward? Why is he perpetually alienated from these people? Why does he find it difficult to accommodate their divergent views? Why does he think that he knows more and better than any of these and other people? Why does he fear their coming close to him? Why does he make it difficult for them to contribute to their people and chart a new course for the State? These and other traits are characters of like minds.\n\nEvery movement, speech, step, action, programme, etc of Boni points towards the tendency of wanting to emerge emperor.\n\nA few examples for the reader. And believe me the things mentioned in this article are real and not imaginary! They are there for whoever wishes to check for himself. They may not be listed in chronological order; however they have happened or are in the pipeline.\n\nBonis desire to transform Adamawa into an empire manifested itself a couple of months ago with the dethronement of the Bachama Kingdom and traditional structure, followed by the conferment of first class status to the new Hama Bachama, Asaph Zadok, a former fire brand student leader. The uplifment of the chiefdom from second to first class was done single handedly by Boni. Not even those that are supposed to know ever got a wind of the elevation until he pronounced it at the venue of the coronation and installation and handing over of staff of office to the new Hama Bachama (King of the Bachamas). Even his boss, the Vice President expressed some surprise, although it was said he all along knew about it. The effect and shock it generated was so terrific that it shook the entire traditional leadership within the state. Ask the Lamido of Adamawa, if only he can confess! Ask the Emir of Mubi. Ask even the Wali of Adamawa, who was said to have left the venue unceremoniously, along side the Emir of Mubi. And behold, it was even said that the speech read by Emperor Boni was hand written and was brought out from his pocket right at the point of delivering the speech. By giving the Bachamas and their neighbors first class status, Boni has set full machinery in motion for his anointment as the Emperor of Adamawa. It is reliably gathered that between eight and eleven other first class kingdoms are in the offing, including one in my area. But that is not to say that I have anything against the Bachama, Bwatiye, Chamba or any other kingdom or their Kings or subjects, whatsoever.\n\nPart of the programme for achieving the strategic status as Emperor is the renovation and rehabilitation of the Government House Yola. Indeed Boni has commenced the rehabilitation and renovation of the Government house, Yola. Yes, in preparation for 2007 and beyond, the government house is being renovated and rehabilitated to give it a completely new look, commensurate with the emerging entity and status desired by Boni. He has just ruled and ordered that visitors to the Yola Government House (accommodating both Governors Office and Residence) should be re-directed to an obscure gate, re-created and erected at an obscure and remote corner of the government house complex. This is to say apart from him and his immediate family members nobody else will enter the seat of the government through the majestic main gate! Everyone else should use the new gate, which ultimately leads to the same arena. It is accessed through a dangerously winding corner which by all standards has security and safe driving implications. In fact it was the first and former entrance to the government house before it was re-oriented to its current (again former) location.\n\nWhat is the pride in using the only major and main entrance to the seat of the government of a state? Indeed, in many a state, the first families use the small or side gates as private entrance, and allow visitors and other people, dignitaries inclusive, to access the seat of the government through the main gate which is usually monumental.\n\nIt is so in Gombe, Taraba, Borno, Bauchi, Kano, Sokoto, Niger, etc, where visitors are welcomed to the government houses through main gate and not side entrance!\n\nRecently, during his face-off with a presidential aspirant, Buba Marwa, Boni repeatedly told and reminded his interviewer that he is the governor, leader, boss etc in Adamawa, more than 30 times during that interview (Leadership tabloid). He laboured hard to justify his position, whereas the issue is not beyond a case to be handled by a protocol officer in the government house! What is the function of the state party hierarchy? Why could Boni waste his energy and state resources fighting an imaginary power! He does not want to loose his emerging empire! Boni could stoop so low to fight an ant. He had caused the Yola North Local Government Guest house to relocate their main gate (on Justice Buba Ardo Road) to face Mayo Ine Street, simply because that is his route to and from town centre, and therefore does not want obstruction from guest and other users of the guesthouse. Infact efforts were made to force other properties located on that road to also relocate their entrances but it was not just possible to implement that wish. Even the police station facing the government house gate had its main entrance relocated to a small corner, to the disadvantage of orderly traffic control, so that it turns away from Bonis view when he is coming out or going into the Government house.\n\nAnother interesting arena is the government house chambers in which Boni receives his August visitors. Behold, what you always see is a Governor (sorry, an emperor), sitting alone, on an Executive high back swivel chair; on raised Dias, overlooking his subjects (sorry, Visitors) and lecturing them. Yes, lecturing them, I mean it, because Boni is never diplomatic or rather soft in his speeches. He speaks with authority and intimidation.\n\nAsk Tony Iredia of the NTA, as Boni was recently on Tonys programme Point Blank. Governor Victor Attah of Akwa Ibom State was also recently on the same programme, and it was a delight listening to him talk and answer questions during the programme. But my emperors session was like an interrogation session with the Nigerian Police!\n\nIndeed my first close encounter with Boni was a couple of years ago during a dinner party organised in honour of Ricky Tarfa (SAN) at the Sheraton Hotel Abuja. He was to deliver a keynote address. Instead of that and in line with the programme of the day, Boni simply spoke on imaginary Abuja Politicians. Not a few were disenchanted with the event, in its totality. Watching or listening Boni making a speech is like finding ones self in an early morning NYSC drill or even military parade, where one is just bound to listen to yelling, whether sweet or sour, orders and answer in the affirmative, yes sir!\n\nBack to the Governors chambers, such venues are meant to serve as one-on-one meeting place. Not where power and arrogance are exhibited. Rather it is a place where diplomacy is brewed. Simply check many a government houses. They are simply conducive and pleasing. One would not find such domineering enclaves. Have you not noticed that even the Israeli cabinet meeting room of Arial Sharon is a simple room with no dais. CNN has shown that many a times.\n\nThe first executive action Boni took in 1999, as the governor of Adamawa , was to revoke infill plots allocations within the GRA in Jimeta- Yola. He did that, according to him, in the interest of the public. However, and ironically, the only 2 properties Boni publicly admitted owning are built on infill plots, carved out of the land belonging to Federal College of Education, Yola! And how come some members of his cabinets and some civil servants are now fighting between themselves over who should get allocations of the same plots he revoked? The rest is for the public to judge.\n\nBoni can be remembered as the only who Governor pontificates so much about completion of abundant projects. How many he has successfully completed is what I am trying to catalogue.\n\nIn any case, some of the projects that got his executive knocks were the State Secretariat and House of Assembly. Exercising so much power, he terminated the contract of the state secretariat and took over control of the project as the Project Manager until its so-called completion. I say so-called because it still remains to be fully completed.\n\nAmongst the successes of his project management techniques, Boni caused abundant surface-wired electric cabling. I am not kidding. Anyone can go to any of the offices completed by Boni and see for himself. The original blocks completed by the original main contractors are however free from flying cables. I do not intend to discuss the House of Assembly project, however, because the first victim of that project, late Bappa Madagali (the then Commissioner for Works), is now deceased. Only aspiring and emerging Emperors detest challenges.\n\nAnother interesting phenomenon with Boni Haruna is his love for grandeur. Boni rides in Peugeot 607 super executive & BMW 7 series vehicles, reminiscent of the Arab or Royal kings of the Middle East. Boni has fleet of these vehicles in both Yola and Abuja; even though he could not ride comfortably in Yola as a result of neck deep potholes on all roads within the town, except those leading to and around the private residences of his boss, the Vice-President. Even these roads were privately rehabilitated by a state-patronised road construction company, as its contribution during the wedding of the daughter of the VP. Please note that even the road leading to the Government House, Yola is not free from 65% potholes, some of them upto 50cm deep. And there is no water to even mix materials to repair the roads!\n\nAdamawa State would have advanced beyond its present diminishing level, if Boni has been giving listening ears to good advice and constructive criticism. But he considers every criticism destructive criticism. Many good tidings came by way of the state, but were blocked by Boni through his indirect action and through direct obstruction of his sub-ordinates. Many are aware of a proposal by a group of young Adamawa medical doctors working in the U.K, who through their association offered to donate a container load of medical consumables to the state government for distribution to medical health centers in the state, but were frustrated and blocked from seeing Boni. When the representative of the group came, he did his best to see the governor, but was told that he could only see the Commissioner of Health, who apparently then was only trying to claim credit for what he know nothing about. Before being asked to see the commissioner, the highest ranking official he saw was a protocol officer, who claimed that, His Excellency, has given them mandate to handle such matters and it is not worth trying to reach him, Boni. That is how the state lost such valuable items to another state in the North West, whose governor gladly welcomed the gift! He even went to the U.K to attend an occasion organized by the group at a later day.\n\nMany people are also aware of a proposal brought to the government for the leasing and upliftment of the Yola International Hotel by a group of hoteliers and investors from Europe. That proposal and idea suffered the same fate as the groups representative was prevented from seeing Boni throughout his two-week stay in Yola. Only emperors block subjects from seeing them directly.\n\nIgnorance is a problem that pervades Adamawa. People remain ignorant of events and action of the government, even though nothing actually is happening.\n\nDuring one of my visits to the state library to obtain current data on the states economic blueprint (which I later understand does not exist), I was referred to the Hon. Commissioner of Information as the only person that can authorize the released of such information to me! I later even pretended to be undergraduate student, looking for data to complete my undergraduate project. But I was denied that little information I needed.\n\nSubsequently when I complained to one of my friends in the Ministry of Information, to see if he can assist, he simply advised that I see the Secretary to the State Government, then, as nobody would want to go contrary to His Excellencys order! What an attempt to keep citizens ignorant.\n\nThe Government may claim to have Adamawa Broadcasting Corporation (ABC and Adamawa Television (ATV), dishing out what the government feels it is its information, enlightenment and education programmes. But anybody who has been to Yola knows that it is not a state which enjoys public service broadcast. The reason is that both ABC and ATV operate skeletally due to epileptic power supply by the almighty newly born Power Holding Company of Nigeria (although the people in Adamawa already call it Power Hiding Company!). There is simply no power to do anything. Power is only available to ABTI-American University which is owned by the VP because they have a dedicated service line. Yola enjoys some power only if the VP comes to town. Check it out! Also, the only radio programme every one enjoys listening in Yola is the one called Katakore named after its producer. It is simply an entertainment programme and nothing more. If Boni had been strong willed, with his people in his mind, Adamawa would have been a great state now. Imagine, it is only in Adamawa that, telecommunications with all its advancement, is still epileptic, simply nauseating. Even the GSM networks did not find it easy coming to Adamawa. While Governor Ahmadu Adamu Muazu of Bauchi practically enticed V-Mobile and Glo to extend their services to Bauchi with attendant incentives, Boni stopped the erection of some GSM masts by some of the operators, even ordering the police commissioner to arrest anyone seen near their proposed sites. He even paid several personal visits to some of these sites to order stoppage of work. Their offence? They probably did not pay homage to him in his office upon arrival to town. There could be no other reason, as, then, another network had already erected its own mast along the same axis near the Federal College of Education Yola! Only an emerging emperor could personally go to this extent. Some people say he is thinking of expanding the Jimeta  Yola road, thus this decision. What is the function of the state Ministry of works and Urban Planning authorities? Who in the first place approved initial spot for the mast?\n\nOne would have thought that with Ahmed Joda as Chairman of Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) and Lawal Bello as chairman M-Tel (then), the state would have been an investors heaven in telecommunications. It is far from that. As I write this piece, M-Tel does not function properly in Yola. They have been off since probably February 2005. Nitels fixed land lines dont work better either. Where and when they work, they just are just inaudible as you simply cannot hear the other party clearly because of poor voice quality. It has been like that ever since. If anyone is in doubt, simply dial any number you know in Yola and confirm if you dont have to shout above your voice before being heard at the other end. The State had the opportunity to be a telecoms paradise, but Boni made non-sense of that dream.\n\nBonis quest for power does not ever allow him to ponder and think before exercising his authority. It is common for leaders to talk on issues at every given opportunity. But it is not common to talk policies and politics during condolence visits. During one of his condolence visits to Mubi town recently, Boni used the opportunity to tell the Emir and his subjects that the bad roads in the area are not his fault. Who said it was his fault in the first place, when Boni did not even repair or maintain the only 2 major roads leading the government house Yola. Repair the roads in Yola before making promises to others.\n\nBehold the Emperor, who took control of every aspect of governance, including specification and procurement of equipment and consumables for Ministries for their day-to-day operations. He alone knows the source of required items and what is required.\n\nBoni, during the first years of his accession (remember it was his Boss that vacated the stool for him) took control of powers from his sub-ordinates and placed orders for construction equipment for the Ministry of Works and others for the so-called Direct Labor Team. I say so-called, again, because the equipment bought did not serve their purpose. They ended up being leased to selected government patronized contractors, who in the first instance claimed they possessed similar equipment. Anyway, the equipment was delivered. But, alas what did we get? My answer is refurbished Second World War Right Hand (yes, Right Hand! Because I know my left and right) driven vehicles! They are there at the various yards for all to see. So you see Emperors are always wiser than the citizens. Saddam gave his people sophisticated weapons to fight the enemy, while Boni gave World War Vehicles to his people. And he ordered that the equipment be leased out to his competent contractors. I said competent contractors, because he alone knows who is competent and who is not.\n\nBoni had always boasted of knowing contractors better than anyone else. And he always awarded contracts to those contractors known only to him and him alone. Probably that explain why indigenes are not considered in contract awards, because he knows who can and who cannot perform.\n\nConsider this: The contractor handling the Bekaji road expansion project, in Jimeta, when asked why gutters were not provided early enough during the course of construction, simply blew hot that he was waiting for the rains to fall, so that he will know the direction of the storm water flow. Does it take anything to determine direction of flow of storm water? Who designed the road in the first instance? This episode was aired live on a state TV news programme! This contractor was imported from outside the state as in other projects. Indigenes are mostly sidelined in the award of major contracts. The indigenous contractors simply sit back and watch the emperor savour his chop. Let Boni publish the list of all contracts and the beneficiaries and you will know who is who is in the business. Why talk of SEEDS then?\n\nNow that the almighty party registration has just taken place, Emperor Boni, must be biting his fingers and licking his wounds at the same time. The whole exercise took him and his team off guard.\n\nBoni had strategised to knock out every imaginable enemy and troublemaker during the exercise in Adamawa when unknown to him the Abuja group were un to the contrary. The most unimaginable happened; and Senator Jubril Aminu was given the task to register PDP members in Adamawa. For those who know not, Boni had earlier confessed confiscating the PDP member register for Adamawa for keeps in his bedside cabinet. This he had confirmed in his numerous interviews and rantings in various National dailies when the fight with Buba commenced. It appears Bonis empire in now twice wise.\n\nIt is generally known that Emperors adhor filth and dirt. But our Boni does not care at all about the capital of his empire, Yola. Without any iota of fear or contradiction, I say Yola qualifies as dirtiest state capital in Nigeria. No elaboration required. Come and see it yourself. It is only in Yola that filth is generated right at the back yard of the government house. And Boni does not care. Or does he not know? I say this because he hardly stays in Yola as it is rather regarded as his second office. His first office is at Maitama  Abuja. He only visits Yola when he has a lecture to give to visitors or visiting delegates or when the monthly federal allocation matures.\n\nIt is common knowledge to most of us who pass through Jos, Bauchi and Gombe towns on our way to Yola that the roads in these capitals were systematically or co-coordinately repaired, no matter their location.\n\nThe roads in Yola were not that lucky, as His Majesty Emperor Boni decided not to blink an eye on the condition of these roads, until most recently. Even now only a few strategic roads are being rehabilitated though Boni is quick to tell whoever cares to listen that he is doing well in that sector.\n\nEven with these and other monumental blunders and failures, Boni wants to repeat his session as the Sole Emperor of Adamawa, not minding that his failure deserves expulsion or withdrawal and not a repeat. Boni has become so stubborn that his Head Master, Mr Vice-President, is also openly complaining about him as we are made to understand. The renovation of the Government house may, again, mean Boni is trying to be a good tenant. Post occupancy renovation is usually attributes of good tenants. Who knows?\n\nWe however remain to see the result of the PDPs maneuvers in Adamawa state and what its effect will be on Bonis triumph launch into Empire establishment.\n\nIn any case what the state needs is motorable roads, potable water, energy, security, good schools, agricultural incentives etc, etc."
