        "text": "masinboko@gmail.com or call 08065388408 PREFACE Gombe state was lucky to have had Danjuma Goje. In 2003, Goje became the Governor with overwhelming support from the people. His government had no legitimacy crisis just as he also identified with the needs of the people. He embarked on massive developmental projects. Goje was a charismatic and selfless leader who did not allow private motive to dominate his public life and this automatically endeared him to the people. Goje not only informed, instructed but also persuaded the people to a common objective and the people willingly followed him, knowing that doing so was for their own good. Danjuma Goje was succeeded by former Accountant General of the Federation, Dr. Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo. There was no succession dispute and Goje lived up to expectation as he did not disappoint either his successor or the people. Goje laid a solid foundation for other leaders in Gombe to build on. Goje is an exemplary, visionary, selfless, courageous and a transformational leader. When he was in power in the western region, some of his numerous achievements include establishment of Gombe state University, School of Nursing and Mid-wife, Federal University Kashere, Gombe State Transport Corporation, Gombe State International Airport later renamed as Sani Abacha International Airport, Ultra-Modern Pantami Township Stadium, Gombe International Hotel, provision of safe, clean and portable water, constant and stable electricity, creation of 9000 jobs, construction and renovation of over 200 schools as well as free and compulsory primary education, roads networks among others.As we have pointed out earlier, the singular job of a leader is to lead which implies giving the people the vision that is needed for them to move from where they are to where they ought to be. Leadership is a herculean task but it is possible only for those who understand the nitty-gritty that is involved in it."
