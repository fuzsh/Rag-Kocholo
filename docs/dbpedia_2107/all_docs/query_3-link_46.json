        "text": "Overview\n\nSecurity status\n\nAvoid Non-Essential Travel\n\nLatest Travel Alert\n\nElections are scheduled to take place in Imo, Kogi and Bayelsa states on November 11th. There is an increased risk of protests and unrest both during the period leading up-to and following the elections. Irish citizens are advised to be vigilant and keep up to date with local developments and avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings. If you become aware of any nearby protests, leave the area immediately and monitor local media for up-to-date information.\n\nGeneral Travel Advice\n\nWe advise against all travel to the following areas:\n\nAdamawa state\n\nBauchi state\n\nBorno state\n\nGombe state\n\nYobe state\n\nThe coastal and river areas of the Niger Delta states (Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Delta, Cross River and Rivers states).\n\nKaduna state\n\nKatsina state\n\nKogi state\n\nNiger state\n\nZamfara state\n\nWe advise against all but essential travel to the following areas:\n\nAbia state\n\nBayelsa state\n\nDelta state\n\nKano state\n\nKebbi state\n\nJigawa state\n\nPlateau state\n\nNasarawa state\n\nRivers state\n\nSokoto state\n\nSecurity Advice:\n\nAll citizens present in Nigeria are encouraged to register their presence with the Embassy.\n\nThe security situation remains uncertain in many parts of Nigeria and there is a high threat of domestic terrorism. Be aware that there is an ongoing threat from the Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) insurgencies, which has caused substantial loss of life over the last decade.\n\nRallies, protests, demonstrations, and riots are common and may occur at any time. The security forces may use tear gas and/or live ammunition for crowd control. Keep up to date with local and international events and avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings. If you become aware of any nearby protests, leave the area immediately and monitor local media for up-to-date information.\n\nThere is a high risk of kidnapping throughout Nigeria. We advise to take security precautions along the lines mentioned further below. In addition, when arranging appointments in Nigeria, ensure that the attendees are known to you and that the meeting is held in a secure location. Many kidnappings in Nigeria are commercial in nature, are often opportunistic, and can happen in any part of the country. There have been recent terrorist kidnappings, and while these have occurred mainly in northern Nigeria previously, they could now also occur elsewhere. Terrorist groups, including Boko Haram and ISWAP are likely to carry out kidnappings, and several foreign nationals and humanitarian workers have been targeted previously. Banditry and outbreaks of inter-communal violence have occurred frequently throughout Nigeria, and particularly in the North West in recent years.\n\nThe Middle Belt states often experience outbreaks of localised violence, linked to civil unrest, farmer-herder disputes and elections, and such outbreaks can occur at short notice. Such occurrences can often be quickly followed by localised curfews imposed by the authorities. You are advised to avoid large crowds, political rallies, demonstrations and any large public protests or gatherings.\n\nIn the event that you encounter difficulties in the areas where the Department advises against all or all but essential travel to, the assistance that the Department of Foreign Affairs or our Embassy in Abuja may be able to provide, is likely to be extremely limited. Before considering travel to these areas, we advise you to take professional security advice.\n\nFor all other areas, we advise you to take additional security precautions. These might include:\n\nhaving the name and phone number of the driver collecting you at the airport;\n\nbeing wary of any last-minute driver changes;\n\nplanning in advance how you are getting to and back from each meeting;\n\nconsidering a security escort if travelling in rural areas or at night-time;\n\nvarying your routines;\n\nkeeping others informed of your travel plans;\n\nfollowing the security advice of your employer;\n\nstaying only in secure accommodation;\n\nreviewing your security measures regularly.\n\nTravellers to Nigeria should bear these factors in mind and pay careful attention to local news prior to and during travel to/in Nigeria. Visit the ‘Safety and Security’ tab for more information.\n\nIrish citizens require a visa to enter Nigeria.\n\nA valid passport is required for travel to Nigeria. Irish passports should have a minimum validity of 6 months. Passport cards cannot be used.\n\nFor more information on visas and passports, please see the Additional Information tab.\n\nVisitors to Nigeria are advised to follow the guidance of national and local authorities and stay fully informed of what's going on by monitoring local news and social media.\n\nCitizens can also follow the Embassy on social media (Twitter and Facebook)to ensure access to relevant updates and alerts.\n\nEmergency Assistance\n\nThe best help is often close at hand so if visitors have problems, try talking to local contacts, tour operator representative or hotel management.\n\nVisitors can contact the emergency services in Nigeria by dialling 199.\n\nOur tips for Safe Travels:\n\nGet comprehensive travel insurance that covers all your planned activities.\n\nRegister your details with us so that we can contact you quickly if there’s an unforeseen crisis like a natural disaster or a family emergency.\n\nFollow us on twitter @dfatravelwise for the latest travel updates.\n\nRead our ‘Know Before You Go’ guide.\n\nSafety and security\n\nThe risk of domestic terrorism, including suicide bomb attacks, is high. A number of groups operate in Nigeria, including the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) and Boko Haram. These groups have been responsible for a high number of attacks, including suicide bomb attacks at markets, motor parks (public transport depots), schools and religious institutions. These occurred mainly in north-eastern Nigeria but there were several high profile attacks in Abuja between 2011 and 2015, and a higher threat level within Abuja FCT in 2022.\n\nAttacks can be indiscriminate and could strike a variety of targets including; government, security, and educational institutions; international organisations; and public venues and areas, such as restaurants, bars, markets, hotels, shopping centres, places of worship and other areas frequented by expatriates, foreign tourists and business travellers. Travellers to Nigeria should take precautions, pay careful attention to local news and be prepared to change their travel plans at short notice.\n\nDue to the threat of domestic terrorism, under no circumstances should you travel to the north-eastern states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe, and their neighbouring states of Bauchi and Gombe. There is an on-going insurgency in north-eastern Nigeria which has the potential to spill-over into surrounding states. Moreover, borders between Nigeria and Cameroon, Chad and Niger are extremely porous, which facilitates the movement of criminal gangs, drug traffickers and radical groups.\n\nIf you have essential business in the northern or Middle Belt states of Nigeria we advise you to contact the Embassy of Ireland in Abuja well in advance of your trip\n\nCrime\n\nViolent crime, including muggings, kidnappings, car-jackings and armed robberies are prevalent throughout Nigeria and Irish citizens travelling in Nigeria are strongly advised to take precautions, including refraining from conspicuous displays of wealth. You should also take care after dark within cities, avoiding secondary roads and areas where other traffic is light. Travel at night in the outskirts of cities and towns should also be avoided. You are advised to be particularly vigilant when sitting in traffic jams or at traffic lights at night. Keep your car windows and doors locked and valuables out of sight.\n\nKidnapping\n\nThere is a significant risk to western travellers in Nigeria from kidnappers, particularly to those working in the oil and gas sectors. Kidnapping in Nigeria is carried out both by criminal gangs for financial reasons and also by terrorist groups.\n\nWestern travellers in Nigeria are advised to take particular precautions to avoid kidnapping including:\n\nAvoid travelling at night, particularly inter-city\n\nAvoid travelling alone\n\nWhen driving, ensure all car doors are locked\n\nVary routes and departure times – avoid patterns which could be tracked\n\nPay careful attention to local media for reports of kidnapping activities\n\nHave the name and phone number of the person collecting you from the Airport\n\nFraud\n\nIrish nationals should be aware of the risks presented by social media, email and text message scammers. A range of scams are used to encourage victims to part with money which usually involve building trust with victims over a period of time before announcing an emergency which requires funds urgently. There are many different scams and they almost always involve a relationship formed across social media. In some cases, Irish citizens have been told that funds are urgently needed, such as a child requiring emergency hospital treatment or the online girlfriend or boyfriend needs funds to pay their university fees or a friend in Nigeria has been arrested and money must be urgently transferred to the police. Be very wary of online relationships including those formed via Christian dating websites. Do not transfer funds or give personal information to anyone that you have only ever met online. Further useful information on Advance Fee Fraud in West Africa is available from the website of the Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. For security as well as commercial reasons, business people travelling to Nigeria to be hosted by a new local partner should check the background of the partner before finalising their arrangements.\n\nMaritime Security\n\nThere have been armed robberies and kidnapping attacks against ships that anchor in Nigerian waters, as well as in rivers and ports in the Niger Delta. We advise mariners and sailors to take appropriate caution whilst in these areas and to ensure that their employer has a contingency plan for such an occurrence.\n\nLocal Travel\n\nThe majority of roads in Nigeria are in poor condition with many unpaved, unmarked and without street lighting. Inter-city roads in particular tend to be poorly maintained. Local drivers can behave more erratically than in Ireland and accordingly a high degree of caution when travelling by road in Nigeria is advised.\n\nThere are high numbers of authorised and unauthorised vehicle checkpoints throughout Nigeria. Some are for security checks, others to extort small payments of money. You should slow down at any type of checkpoint and use common sense at all times. The number of these checkpoints increases at night.\n\nPublic transport is dangerous and we advise against its use. Taxis and long distance buses are poorly maintained and travellers who use them expose themselves to the risk of theft or attack from drivers and other passengers. Travellers should in particular ensure that they have pre-arranged travel from their destination airport before travelling to Nigeria and should avoid using public transport from an airport. Make sure that you have the name and phone number of the person collecting you from the Airport.\n\nSwimming\n\nOcean currents are very strong along the coast, and many swimming accidents are caused by rip tides.\n\nAir Travel\n\nTravellers should note that there are concerns about the safety and reliability of some airline companies operating domestic flights within Nigeria. Irish citizens should carefully evaluate the implications for their security and safety before deciding to undertake domestic air travel. Also, domestic flights are frequently cancelled at short notice and travellers should consider direct international flights in to Nigeria rather than transiting domestically. There are often lengthy flight delays, particularly flights later in the day.\n\nLocal laws and customs\n\nRemember, the local laws apply to you as a visitor and it is your responsibility to follow them. Be sensitive to local customs, traditions and practices as your behaviour may be seen as improper, hostile or may even be illegal.\n\nNigeria is a federal republic divided into 36 states and a Federal Capital Territory. The Federal Government exercises jurisdiction throughout the country on certain issues while State Governments exercises jurisdiction on other issues. The Nigerian Police Force is a federal, national police force. In recent years, some southern states have set up official law enforcement bodies but they are not officially recognised by the Federal Government.\n\nConditions in Nigerian prisons and detention facilities fall below the standards that would be observed in Ireland and can be extremely unpleasant.\n\nThe public display of a same sex relationship is illegal under federal law. Prosecutions can result in custodial sentences of up to 14 years imprisonment.\n\nDrug related offences in Nigeria can attract heavy prison sentences.\n\nTaking photographs of government buildings is illegal and can lead to detention.\n\nIt is illegal to export African artefacts and antiques from Nigeria without written authorisation from the Department of Antiquities.\n\nNigeria formally retains the death penalty for a number of offences.\n\nSharia Law\n\nA number of northern Nigerian states which are predominantly Muslim have adopted Sharia Law. These are: Zamfara, Sokoto, Kano, Niger, Katsina, Bauchi, Borno, Jigawa, Kebbi and Yobe. Sharia Law is an Islamic body of law and moral code. Penalties for Muslims convicted under Sharia Law in northern Nigeria can be very severe, particularly for offences such as theft and adultery. Where travellers have essential business in these states, they should dress conservatively and women are advised to cover their legs, head and arms. Nigeria is a deeply religious society and travellers to all parts of Nigeria should respect local religious traditions and avoid offending local sensitivities.\n\nHealth\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs strongly recommends that you obtain comprehensive travel insurance which will cover all overseas medical costs, including medical evacuation, before travelling to Nigeria. You should check any exclusions, and that your policy covers you for the activities you want to undertake. Travellers should note that the Irish Government does not provide funds for emergency medical repatriation or for repatriation of remains.\n\nIn most parts of Nigeria, medical facilities are very basic and even in major population centres the level of available medical care is quite limited, and payment must usually be made up-front. Accordingly, medical evacuation to Europe or South Africa is frequently required for anything more than a minor accident or illness.\n\nWe advise travellers to Nigeria to consult a GP and take medical advice before travelling. Medical practitioners advise travellers to receive a large number of vaccinations which would not normally be required in Ireland. A Yellow Fever vaccination and a valid WHO approved Yellow Vaccination Book are required for entry to Nigeria – travellers who are unable to provide evidence of Yellow Fever vaccination are liable to deportation by the Nigerian Immigration Service.\n\nMalaria\n\nMalaria is a major public health problem in Nigeria, and can be fatal without medical attention. You should consult your GP about malaria prophylaxis prior to travel. The use of anti-insect spray/cream and/or insecticide treated mosquito nets can also reduce the risk of contracting malaria.\n\nHIV/AIDS\n\nHIV/AIDS is prevalent and travellers should exercise appropriate precautions.\n\nPolio\n\nPolio is no longer endemic in Nigeria, but is not yet considered eradicated. There are regular outbreaks of cholera, measles, lassa fever, and meningitis throughout the country.\n\nNigeria experiences heavy rainfall during the rainy season (June - September), during which time there is an increased risk of water-borne diseases like cholera, and flash flooding can occur. You are advised to maintain a supply of clean bottled water at all times and to avoid purchasing sachets of water on the street.\n\nZika\n\nThere is currently no known outbreak of Zika Virus (a dengue-like mosquito-borne disease) in Nigeria. However, there have been cases in the recent past and it is present in the wider region. For this reason Irish Citizens, especially those with a weakened immune system or women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, are advised to follow guidance available on the website of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC)."
