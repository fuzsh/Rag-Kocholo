        "text": "With multiple cities boasting populations exceeding one million, it's no wonder that Nigeria is one of the most populous countries in the world. Its biggest city, Lagos, contributes 9 million residents to the total population, while there are also 79 cities with a minimum population of 100,000 and 249 cities with populations that surpass 10,000. Nigeria has a total of 36 states, and 774 Local Government Areas that are spread across the 39th most populous country in the world.\n\nOver half of Nigeria's population live in rural areas -- 52% to be exact. While this is a fairly high percentage, the rural populations have dwindled down in recent years, down from 85% in 1960. This reduction in numbers is likely due to problems faced in the rural areas of Nigeria, which includes a lack of or sporadic electricity, sanitary conditions, and of course, the lack of industry. Many natives are moving into urbanized, developed areas to take advantage of job opportunities and to avoid a life of poverty found in many of the smaller cities and villages in the country."
