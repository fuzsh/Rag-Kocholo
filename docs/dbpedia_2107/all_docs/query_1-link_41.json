        "text": "The attention of the Management of National Bureau of Statistics has been drawn to an online publication titled “NBS Recruitment 2023/2024 Job Application Form Portal” and hosted on https://recruitmentfile.net/nbs-recruitment/, purporting that the Bureau will soon commence recruitment exercise, and advising prospective candidates on the process for the recruitment.\n\nThe general public may wish to note that the publication did not emanate from the Bureau and that the content seeks to mislead unsuspecting jobseekers. It has therefore become imperative to refute the information.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Bureau would like to emphasize unequivocally that it is not currently recruiting.\n\nThe general public is strongly advised to be wary of any such job offer, particularly one obtained online, and to report such offers to the appropriate law enforcement organizations without delay.\n\nSigned\n\nManagement."
