        "text": "Further anti-government protests and counter-protests are likely through at least Aug. 10. Anti-government activists rallying under slogans such as \"End Bad Governance\" and \"Tinubu Must Go\" have planned a series of actions through Aug. 10 over several demands, including electoral and anti-corruption reforms and reduced electricity and fuel tariffs.\n\nSince Aug. 1, well-attended anti-government protests occurred in Abuja, Benin City, Edo, Gombe, Gusau, Ibadan, Jos, Kaduna, Kano, Lagos, Maiduguri, Port Harcourt, and Yenagoa, among other affected locations. Demonstrations along major roads such as the Abuja-Kaduna and Abuja-Keffi highways caused traffic gridlock. Looting and vandalism incidents occurred in several areas across the country. Police fired tear gas to disperse multiple gatherings, including in Abuja and Lagos. As of Aug. 5, at least 13 casualties have been reported in Abuja and Kano, Niger, Borno, Kaduna, and Jigawa states. Additionally, more than 700 protesters have been arrested by security forces across the country.\n\nIn response, activists supporting the government under the slogan \"Protect Nigeria\" have announced similar actions through Aug. 15. Earlier gatherings saw little participation and occurred mainly in Lagos and Abuja; some minor clashes were reported between rival protesters.\n\nAs of Aug. 5, curfews are in place in various locations:\n\nYobe State: A 12:00-17:00 curfew is in effect in the Potiskum, Gashua, and Nguru Local Government Areas (LGAs).\n\nKano State: A statewide 08:00-1400 curfew is in place.\n\nKatsina State: A 24-hour curfew is imposed in the Dutsin-Ma LGA, while a 19:00-07:00 curfew applies in the remaining parts of the state.\n\nJigawa State: A 18:00-05:00 curfew is in place in Babura, Birnin Kudu, Dutse, Gumel, Hadejia, Kazaure, Kiyawa, and Roni LGAs.\n\nPlateau State: A 24-hour curfew is in effect in Jos.\n\nKaduna State: A 24-hour curfew is in effect in Kaduna and Zaria.\n\nGovernment officials or governors may implement similar curfews and other restrictions ahead of the protests or in the event of significant local, state, or nationwide unrest.\n\nIn the event of future protests, likely gathering locations include city centers of state capitals, notably near governor's offices, government buildings, such as the National Assembly in Abuja, major roads, including highways, and those from city centers to airports. Counter-protesters may attempt to gather in similar areas, raising the risk of confrontations between demonstrators.\n\nAn increased security presence and localized travel delays are likely near all gatherings, particularly in city centers of state capitals near government buildings and transport hubs. The potential for clashes between rival activists or with security forces is elevated, particularly if officials ban the anti-corruption gatherings and activists block major roads, including those connecting airports."
