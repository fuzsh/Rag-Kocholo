It is also the year that we proved that our big bet – that malnutrition treatment can be done better and cheaper than traditional implementers have been able to – was right. Check out some of the highlights below, or read the full report here: https://lnkd.in/dwBV-gTB\n\n🌟 Learn With Us! 🌟 Are you curious about what it takes to transition an early-stage nonprofit into a successful ramp-up phase? Our founders, Abubakar Umar and Justin Graham sat down with Tosca Bruno-van Vijfeijken on the #NGOSoulAndStrategy to chat about what we've learned along the way! 🚀 We delve into maintaining the essence of start-up culture while scaling up policies, systems, and processes. Plus, we discuss the importance of fostering an evidence-based culture in nonprofits! Tune in tomorrow, Friday, May 24! Don't miss out on this opportunity to learn from Five Oaks Consulting, Inc. and Tosca Bruno-van Vijfeijken! #Taimaka #SocialSectorLeadership #Podcast #NonprofitSuccess\n\n🌟 Reflecting on Taimaka's Time at Skoll 🌟 We recently had the opportunity to attend the Skoll Foundation World Forum! Here are a couple of our takeaways: 1️⃣ Breaking Down Power Dynamics: One of our favorite parts of Skoll was the opportunity to engage in candid conversations that helped break down the (otherwise intimidating!) doer vs. donor power dynamics. We’re hugely grateful to Kevin Starr's insights on swapping pitches in favor of conversations (see: https://lnkd.in/d5ZwC2tC also grateful to our partner – MIGHTY ALLY – for helping us concisely communicate about the exciting things that we've been up to! 2️⃣ Making New Friends: We were thrilled to host an event alongside Operation Fistula and Lafiya Nigeria, where we brainstormed integrating our diverse maternal and child health interventions. By pooling our resources and expertise, we aim to offer more holistic and more cost-effective services that address the needs of those we serve. 3️⃣ Normalizing Risk for Impact: We participated in some fantastic workshops and interactive panels that illuminated the power of normalizing risk for doers. Donors like the AB InBev Foundation (s/o to Connective Impact for hosting) and the Risk Pool Fund are helping lead the way by proactively asking \"What challenges do you face?\" rather than “Do you have any challenges?” – which fosters more open dialogue and collaboration! 4️⃣ Strengthening Partnerships: It was rewarding to reconnect with our partners, including the Dovetail Impact Foundation and The Agency Fund. Nurturing these relationships in person reinforces our shared commitment to achieving cost-effective impact! Want to trade notes? Say hello! external@taimaka.org. #Philanthropy #Impact #Collaboration #MaternalHealth #ChildHealth #Taimaka\n\nHeading to Skoll this year? 🌟 Weary from panels amongst the dynamic schedule of Skoll and just want an honest and down-to-earth conversation? 💡 Join Taimaka, Operation Fistula, and Lafiya Nigeria for a brunch to bridge gaps in women and children's health! ☕ Each year Skoll convenes a global community of social impact leaders and activists, chief among whom are dedicated champions in maternal and child health. We're co-hosting a unique but relaxed morning gathering at The Café in the Levine Building of Trinity College, Oxford on April 11th, designed for these passionate individuals to engage and connect. If you're a doer, bring a donor! And if you're a donor, bring a doer! We want everyone to have a seat at the table. Spaces are limited, so sign up quickly! https://lnkd.in/d9QpCE22 #SkollWorldForum"
