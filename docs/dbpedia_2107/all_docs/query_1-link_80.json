        "text": "Usually, postal codes and zip codes are used to facilitate the delivery of packages via post (mail). In some countries like the U.S., zip codes are used while in countries like Nigeria postal codes are used.\n\nNigeria is divided into six geopolitical zones, each zone sharing the same ethnic origin, the same cultural practices, and the same history. Geopolitics has contributed to the efficient allocation of resources by the government and was created during the reign of President Ibrahim Babangida.\n\nThe six geopolitical zones are; North-East region composed mainly of the Kanuri ethnic group and has six states; Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, and Yobe. The North-West region is mainly made up of the Hausa Fulani ethnic group and has seven states; Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, and Zamfara.\n\nThe North-Central region, also known as the middle belt and which has the largest number of states, is predominantly made up of the Tiv ethnic group and has seven states; Federal Capital Territory, Benue, Kogi, Kwara, Nassarawa, Niger, and Plateau. The South-East region consists mainly of the Igbo ethnic group and has the fewest states, five states are in the Southeast region; Abia, Anambra, Enugu, Ebonyi, and Imo.\n\nThe South-South region is made up of the Ijaw ethnic group and has six states; Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River State, Delta, Edo, and Rivers. The final geopolitical area is the South-West region is mostly dominated by the Yoruba tribes, made up of states such as Ekiti, Oyo, Ogun, Lagos, Osun, and Ondo.\n\nHow to Decode Nigeria Postal Code?\n\nNigeria postal codes are made of numbers, consisting of six digits. NIPOST, the Nigerian Postal Service, divides the country into nine regions, which make up the first digit of the code. The second and third digits, combined with the first, are the dispatch district for outgoing sorting.\n\nThe last three digits represent the delivery location. A delivery location can be any of the following; a post office facility, a rural area, or an urban area.\n\nPostal Codes For Nigeria\n\nLagos has the lowest postal code 100001. The main postal head office in each region in Nigeria has a postal code ending with 0001. So, Garki Main HO in Abuja has zip code 900001, Lokoja in Kogi has 270001 and Port Harcourt has 500001. The lowest postcode is 100001 and the highest is 982002.
