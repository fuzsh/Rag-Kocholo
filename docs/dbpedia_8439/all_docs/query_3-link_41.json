        "text": "When Franklin Delano Roosevelt created the first presidential library, he hoped future generations would travel there to understand the extraordinary times through which he and his generation were passing. Those times included the Great Depression, the New Deal, and, eventually, a second World War. The era also included the seeds of the modern civil rights movement, a movement influenced in direct and indirect ways by Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt’s lives before, during, and after their twelve years in the White House. How they evolved on the issue of race in America was in large part shaped by their relationships (both political and personal) with African American leaders, as well as by the Black members of their household staffs in Hyde Park, Washington, D.C., and Warm Springs, Georgia. Those remarkable figures are the focus of a new study that the Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site commissioned from the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard University.\n\nIn his rise to the presidency, FDR would be pressed to divulge where he stood on matters of race by the executive director of the NAACP Walter White. Republican Herbert Hoover’s dismal tenure in the White House gave FDR, candidate for the Democrat ticket, an opening to Black voters, who were suffering from four years of the Depression, but remained loyal to the Party of Lincoln. Roosevelt faced a major challenge right away. The New Deal era had its own versions of Black Lives Matter and debates over gun safety: chiefly, the scourge of lynching and the wariness of President Roosevelt to take it on directly for fear of alienating more powerful interests who held the keys to sweeping economic reforms he hoped to push through Congress. FDR tried to convey how, though he was horrified by the brutality of lynching, his hands were tied politically. Eventually, a gap would open between FDR and Eleanor over the gruesome and deadly practice.\n\nWhile FDR felt constrained, ER would go public in an increasingly vocal way. The racial fallout over ER’s Arthurdale, West Virginia, homestead experiment was a perfect example of New Deal racial injustice that altered ER’s thinking. It also would spark her evolution from an employer of Black domestic employees to an advocate of equal rights and a partner of Black activists. Though the Black press called out FDR for his failure to act on racial injustice and inequality, it also zeroed in on the fact that twenty-three out of the Roosevelts’ twenty-five White House household staff members were Black. Among them were the couple Irvin (“Mac”) and Elizabeth (“Lizzie”) McDuffie, FDR’s personal valet and a maid, respectively. Several profiles of the staff ran in the Black press, and Mac was interviewed on the record for at least one of them. He attested that FDR thought only in terms of “Americans,” not with the labels Black and white. “We feel like one large family,” said Lizzie McDuffie, who was the only member of staff FDR allowed to clean his room. Lizzie would establish herself as an effective ambassador for the Roosevelts in Black communities across the country when FDR ran for reelection in 1936 and 1940.\n\nPersonal testimonials like those from the McDuffies were part of an effective communications strategy, revealing FDR’s political dexterity in appealing to African American voters through the Black press while placating the conservative white southern base of his party on the level of policy. It became a precedent future presidents would follow, even as the delicate political bargain between northern liberals and southern white Democrats rapidly disintegrated over the question of civil rights.\n\nNo one exacerbated this fracture among the White House and white southerners more than Eleanor Roosevelt herself, who only increased her advocacy of African American rights during these years. African American civil rights leaders applied intense pressure before and during the United States’ official entry into the war to end Jim Crow discrimination in the defense industry and military. The key figure here was A. Philip Randolph, founder of the most powerful Black union in the nation, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. Politically, FDR needed the support of Randolph’s union, and the support of labor more generally. Randolph pushed FDR to the brink on the subject, vowing to organize and lead a March on Washington unless the president signed an executive order banning Jim Crow in the mobilization effort. This political chess match was the most dramatic example in FDR’s entire tenure of Black activists successfully lobbying the president to act and negotiating with him backed by their own fair share of political leverage—leverage that threatened to expose the nation’s racial hypocrisies at a time when FDR was trying to hold the moral high ground in his struggle for his celebrated Four Freedoms and against fascism. At the same time, Black journalists at the Pittsburgh Courier announced the launch of their “Double V Campaign” to hold the administration to account as it sought to project democratic values abroad while bowing to Jim Crow at home."
