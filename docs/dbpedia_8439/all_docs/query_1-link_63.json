        "meta_description": "Examine the powers of the Executive Branch with these video segments from Ken Burns' The Roosevelts. Presidents Theodore and Franklin Delano Roosevelt expanded the powers of the executive branch as few other presidents before them had. Their administrations played key roles in the evolution of Americans’ relationships with the government and the United States' role on the world stage.\r\nIn the activity that follows, students will analyze the powers granted to the presidency as detailed in in Article II of the U.S. Constitution, and consider how past presidents have used this power in practice. Students will discover that the powers of the presidency are sometimes a matter of interpretation and circumstance. Students will analyze the ways in which the Roosevelts exercised presidential power during their respective terms in office. \r\nLearning Objectives:\r\n\r\nConsider what role the government should play in the regulation of business and the economy;\r\nIdentify the powers granted to president in the Constitution’s Article II;\r\nAnalyze the extent to which both Presidents Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt exercised their power in domestic and international affairs, and how they expanded presidential power beyond the traditional interpretation of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nOpening Activity:\r\nStudents will consider the powers of the executive branch from two different perspectives: the literal and the pragmatic. In this activity, students examine presidential authority as defined in Article II of the Constitution. Students will match this outlined authority with the responsibilities of a president. \r\n1. Divide the class into think-pair-share groups or have students complete the activity individually.\r\n2. Distribute copies to students of the Handout: “Understanding the Powers of the President” and review the directions with students.\r\n3. Review Article II of the Constitution, making sure students understand the language of the article and its content. Then, have students review the “Roles and Responsibilities of the President” to identify where these responsibilities are enumerated in Article II.\r\n4. When students have finished the activity, review their answers with the answer key.",
