        "text": "“What is my proposal? It is simply this: whenever a judge or justice of any federal court has reached the age of seventy and does not avail himself of the opportunity to retire on a pension, a new member shall be appointed by the president then in office, with the approval, as required by the Constitution, of the Senate of the United States.\n\nThat plan has two chief purposes. By bringing into the judicial system a steady and continuing stream of new and younger blood, I hope, first, to make the administration of all federal justice, from the bottom to the top, speedier and, therefore, less costly; secondly, to bring to the decision of social and economic problems younger men who have had personal experience and contact with modern facts and circumstances under which average men have to live and work. This plan will save our national Constitution from hardening of the judicial arteries.\n\nThe number of judges to be appointed would depend wholly on the decision of present judges now over seventy, or those who would subsequently reach the age of seventy.\n\nIf, for instance, any one of the six justices of the Supreme Court now over the age of seventy should retire as provided under the plan, no additional place would be created. Consequently, although there never can be more than fifteen, there may be only fourteen, or thirteen, or twelve. And there may be only nine.”\n\nWhat is President Roosevelt proposing?\n\nWhat are two reasons Roosevelt gives to justify his plan?\n\nAccording to Article III in the U.S. Constitution, who decides the number of Supreme Court Justices authorized to sit on the bench?\n\nThen have students read this quote, also from FDR’s plan, and discuss in small groups:\n\n“But since the rise of the modern movement for social and economic progress through legislation, the Court has more and more often and more and more boldly asserted a power to veto laws passed by the Congress and by state legislatures in complete disregard of this original limitation which I have just read.\n\nIn the last four years the sound rule of giving statutes the benefit of all reasonable doubt has been cast aside. The Court has been acting not as a judicial body, but as a policymaking body.”\n\nWhat are FDR’s real motives for his Court enlargement plan?\n\nWho would appoint the six new Justices?\n\nHow would appointing new Justices affect how the Supreme Court treats FDR’s New Deal legislation?"
