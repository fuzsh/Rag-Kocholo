        "text": "Wise Man Christopher, with his usual fervour, issued his message which he titled, ‘The Weapons Of Our Warfare’ to the congregation and cited many portions of the Bible to make his case clear. In his words, the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but spiritual through God in pulling down every demonic stronghold. The Word, he clarified, is not on the written page of the Bible but in the lips of the believers. As Christians, you need to fill your mind and heart with the Word to speak it. In Matthew 4 : 1-11, Jesus gave Christians the battle plan when He spoke directly to the devil in the wilderness. You need to learn the value of God’s Word on your lips to confront the devil victoriously. In Ephesians 6:17, the Bible tells us that those who overcome satan will be required to use the power of the spoken Word. David, in 1 Samuel 17:45 – 50 used the Word of God in his heart as a weapon to defeat Goliath. David’s first victory was therefore in the choice of the right weapon, which was the Word of God on his lips. As Christians, Jesus has given us the Word of God as a special weapon that no power of satan can withstand. Whatever your giant or mountain, you, as a Christian, can address it with the Word of God and achieve total victory. Prayer in the power of the Holy Spirit is the most formidable weapon, the wise man concluded his message.\n\nWOMAN EFFECTUALLY DELIVERED FROM EATING HER HAIR\n\nA week after her deliverance, Mrs Josephine Eseme Jimmy, standing beside her husband, happily gave thanks to God for her deliverance as, according to her, the urge to eat her hair had completely disappeared. Josephine came to The SCOAN the previous Sunday for deliverance from addiction to eating her hair, including those on her head, armpits and private parts. She said the addiction took form after she heard a voice ordering her to eat her hair. The unusual behaviour was cultivated before her marriage and had continued since then for a length of 23 years. After her confession, Josephine was delivered in the mighty name of Jesus by Prophet T.B. Joshua who told her that she was free and would not eat her hair anymore. She said that in her dream two days after the deliverance, the demon appeared to her to lure her to the old act but immediately, the man of God also appeared and the demon ran in fear. The man of God then held her and she woke from sleep. That was the end of her addiction to eating her hair. The couple thanked the prophet one more time for being used by Jesus to bring about her deliverance. In reaction, the prophet once more established the difference between authority and power. In his words, knowing facts about Jesus does not change your relationship with Him. He however added that your reward for a relationship with Jesus is power.\n\nSPIRITUAL HUSBAND’S HOLD RELEASED IN JESUS’ NAME\n\nA video clip on the events of the previous Sunday service showed Wise Man Daniel as he laid hands on the congregants. A woman among them,Mrs Alberta Boakye from Ghana reacted by manifesting the spiritual husband in her.\n\nThe spirit, speaking through her, said Alberta was his wife who disobeyed her to marry an earthly husband. The spirit added that it had destroyed the husband’s ministry for that reason. The spirit also said their second child could not learn because of the punishment by the spiritual husband. She was then delivered after prayer from Wise Man Daniel. Standing by her pastor husband as she gave her testimony, Alberta revealed that she sensed the spiritual husband in her life at the age of 16 when it used to have sex with her in her dreams. The spirit had been a thorn in their marriage of ten years, causing her to inflict emotional pain on her husband all the time. Under the influence of the spirit, she became the husband and took delight in issuing orders to her husband and beating him. She was however relieved to be free after her deliverance.\n\nIn response to the prophet, Pastor Nicholas the husband chronicled all the shameful treatment his wife inflicted on him under the influence of the spiritual husband. She would wake up and ask her husband in the dead of night to clean the house and wash the dishes. When she knew it was fasting time for her husband, she would deliberately set food before him to break the fast unjustifiably. Either she would meet the husband in the church to fight and embarrass him or prevent him by force from going to church after he was ready. On such occasions, the pastor whose church had branches in other countries, would call his fellow pastors in the church to ask them to carry on as he was still ‘waiting on God’. He lost his congregation to other churches and the branches closed because of the wife’s abnormal behaviour. A king of the community who attended his church withdrew his membership because of the wife’s behaviour. After praying for the deliverance of the pastor, Prophet T.B. Joshua assured him that he would assist him to reactivate his ministry and re-open the branches. Asked to comment on her husband’s confession, Alberta, in unmistakable remorse said, ‘I feel bad and sad’ and bemoaned satan for all that her husband had suffered in her hands. Prophet T.B. Joshua ended the episode by explaining that it was the evil spirit inside the wife that was responsible and now that she was delivered, her husband should not remind her of the past.\n\nMAN DELIVERED FROM THE SPIRIT OF MASTURBATION\n\nA man from Delta, Nigeria, Solomon Ogheneovo by name, told the congregation of himself as a victim of the spirit of masturbation for 24 years. He thought that getting married would stop the embarrassing act but in fact, it continued. Even after marriage, he masturbated at least every day. After unsuccessful efforts, which included fasting and prayer, on his part to stop it, he finally decided to seek the face of the Lord in The SCOAN. After receiving the Anointing Water, he gathered his family and they prayed with it. That prayer, according to him, marked the end of his masturbation. He thanked God for using the prophet to bring an end to this torment in his life.\n\nANOINTING WATER RESTORES MENSTRUATION\n\nMrs Mercy Anthony told listeners how she regained her menstruation which ceased for seven years, completely unresponsive to her efforts to reactivate it. She said a good Samaritan gave her a virtually empty bottle of the Anointing Water which she topped with water, prayed with and ministered on herself. Following that, her menstruation miraculously reappeared. She ended her testimony by advising all her listeners to trust God who has an answer to whatever problems they might have.\n\nANOINTING WATER RESTORES MEMORY AND FETCHES PROMOTION\n\nRahamat Yusuf Suleiman had an accident in April which, among other injuries, affected her memory. This affected her reading and preparation for her promotion examination in her workplace. The result was that she failed the examination and was denied promotion. After efforts elsewhere to find a cure had failed, she sent a friend to The SCOAN for the Anointing Water.\n\nOn receiving the Anointing Water, she prayed with it and sprayed it on herself, particularly her forehead. Soon after, to her amazement, she vomited an earthworm. The Anointing Water gave her total healing and following her prayer with it before going for another promotion examination in her workplace, she found the questions the same as the ones she had read, making her pass the examination with ease. As she gave her testimony, Rahamat displayed her promotion letter which was the outcome of her success in the examination. Rahamat advised her listeners to go to the Lord always for a solution to their problems.\n\nCHRISTMAS GIFTS FOR THE AGED, DISABLED AND CHILDREN WORLDWIDE\n\nThe Emmanuel TV Team and Partners as usual filled trailers with gifts of rice, flour and other food items and transported them to the elderly and physically challenged both within Nigeria and internationally.\n\nTwo of the many states in Nigeria that were visited by The Emmanuel TV Team were Yobe and Borno in the far north of the country. The team set off with two trailers each filled to capacity with rice and flour, in addition to cash gifts. The venue for the meeting with the Emmanuel TV Team was General Hospital Leprosy Centre, Maiduguri. People gathered from all around Borno State to attend the meeting.\n\nThe team sent by T.B. Joshua presented the community leaders with cash gifts and the bags of rice were distributed among everyone, regardless of race, faith or background. The Bible teaches us that we should love our neighbours as ourselves. In the same vein, various gifts were also dispatched to the needy and elderly people in Kremenchuk, Ukraine. In the Asian continent, Lahore, Pakistan was also visited with bags of rice, flour and other gift items.\n\nFINANCIAL AID TO VISUALLY IMPAIRED STUDENTS\n\nIn the course of the service, five visually impaired students from the University of Jos were led to the platform where they narrated their financial problems as students, one after another.\n\nYakubu, a student of Special Education and Rehabilitation Sciences, was the first to bare his mind about his financial needs as a student and concluded that he needed the sum of N92,000.00 to pay his school fees and solve other problems as a student. The rest, in turn, also spoke, explaining that as students, even the money to release their results was hard to come by. Upon listening to their complaint, the prophet directed that their needs be met. Consequently, a total sum of N284,300.00 and bags of rice were disbursed among them.\n\nMASS PRAYER FREES ALL\n\nPraying in the power of the Holy Spirit, Prophet T.B. Joshua led the congregation and viewers worldwide in a powerful time of mass prayer. Many vomited the poisons long buried in their systems, thus receiving their freedom. The prophet prayed for the total release of his listeners in many areas of their lives, including their finances, businesses, marital lives among others. He also prayed for the restoration of their destinies and health. In the course of the mass prayer, the prophet issued prophecies to some people who, in reaction came forward to confirm the prophecies. Confirming that the entire congregation had been delivered and was free, the prophet proceeded to say the grace and bring the service to a close.\n\nIn a few remarks of advice before opening the topic of his message, Wise Man Racine reminded the congregation of the protection the righteous man enjoys in the hand of God. In his words, the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord. He advised them to be happy whereas there is nothing to be happy about on the outside. Some people, he went on, complain, lament and murmur in spite of being Christians. The cause, according to him, is that they are centred on what they are doing. Taking a cue from this, the wise man entitled his sermon, ‘See Beyond Your Situation’ and opened to Psalm 91:14 as his proof text. The Lord, he said, has given assurance to all believers of His protection. Troubles, he continued, do not require any invitation before they come. However, when they come, we should be determined because we are not alone. The devil uses our situation to tempt us. Temptations to sin are the most grievous because they are messengers of satan. You should not listen to them because you are not alone. Situations make people act out of character. How do you handle temptations? God, according to him, uses foolish things to prepare us for new things in life. He first humbles those he intends to honour so that they will not be conceited. He cited Daniel in the lion’s den, Joseph and his travails and Anna’s barrenness for years as Biblical cases to buttress his point. He assured his listeners that their problems were meant to prepare them for the blessings of God. He also echoed Prophet T.B. Joshua’s advice to listeners to be careful when entering temptations allowed by God so as not to think it strange and doubt their Guard. When temptations come, there is a purpose. They are meant to draw you closer to God. As a man of faith, victory is yours. A man of faith is led by an indwelling Spirit of grace that is greater than him. He does everything out of a heart of peace, not for sheer popularity. He believes that when he is weak, he is strong. Any confidence that is based on the outside cannot stand the test of time. Jesus is my Healer whether he heals me or not. This is confidence based on faith. With the Word of God in our heart, our confidence is settled and nothing can change us. The heart must be grounded and rooted in the Word of God. If you must speak, you must think first and in accordance with the Word of God. The words we speak create the curses or blessings that come our way. Your words dominate your life because they express your thoughts which are the seeds of your life. You cannot be above your words. A poor man acting poor and enjoying the company of poor people will remain poor. My words need cleansing because my heart needs cleansing. Our heart is cleansed by focusing on the Word of God. Faith focuses on God, not on the situation. Your faith is your personal situation focused on God and His sufficiency. When difficult times come your way, examine all things in the light of God’s Word and listen to the testimonies of your conscience. God’s Word points you to life though your situation may point you to death. The answer to your situation is the Word of God. The Word of God is sure, eternal and cannot fail. You should see beyond your situation where there is God’s purpose for your life. Your situation is meant to draw you closer to God. Once you believe the Word of God, success is yours, the wise man concluded.\n\nOVERCOME YOUR DOUBT\n\nAfter commending the message given by Wise Man Racine, Prophet T.B. Joshua turned to the viewers under the influence of the telecast and assured them that once they listened; their prayers would answer, adding that distance was no barrier. The prophet gave a sermon, which he entitled, ‘Overcome Your Doubt’ and told his listeners that the best saints have need for the help that can make their faith stronger. He drew his listener’s attention to some Biblical characters to make his point. According to him, Abraham in Genesis 15:6, Gideon in Judges 6:36-37 and John the Baptist in Matthew 11, needed signs to make their faith stronger. Though he believed, John the Baptist wanted concrete signs to make his faith set that Jesus was the expected Messiah. Many people in the Bible who we consider pillars of faith had moments of doubt. This however, does not mean that they had less faith but that their faith was challenged in a new way. Moments of doubt arise when unusual things come one’s way. If you are genuinely seeking salvation from God in the midst of doubt, He will not mind because at the end, your doubt will move you closer to God. When situations in life challenge your faith, they should move you closer to God, not farther away from Him. In situations of poverty, sickness and the like, one seems to be tempted to doubt His ability or desire to help. When one’s faith is challenged in a new way, what one has not experienced before in one’s life cropping up will generate panic, anxiety, worry and doubt in one’s faith. John the Baptist, Peter and many Biblical heroes struggled with many doubts. However, doubt can become a sin if it leads you away from God to scepticism, cynicism and then to hard-heartedness. As you move closer to God, you will find the strength to trust God. One of satan’s strategies or tactics is to get you to doubt God’s goodness. One should be patient because God’s time is the best. Satan tries to make you forget all that God has given you and focus on what you do not have. If you spend your time thinking about what you do not have, you may be slipping into unhealthy doubt. Today, we only acknowledge the immediate goodness of God when we receive and thereafter, we never mention that miracle or blessing. The sickness you had in the past, others had it and died while many others are still on the sickbed. You may think it was an ordinary sickness but people die of the sickness every day. Do not doubt God’s desire or ability to help you. When David, a rustic boy (1 Samuel 17:37) was brought to the king to defend his cause, he simply testified to how God delivered, saved and rescued him from the mouth of lion and bear at his tender age. Today, people will mention only the immediate ones and forget those at their tender age. God gives everyone plenty of evidence to believe in Him. Doubt comes when we fail to stop long enough to observe all the evidence. Once in a while, we should create time to reflect over God’s track record in our lives. Many who are from poverty-stricken and sickness–ridden families are able to live above all that today. We are like a man who prayed that he had no shoes and when God gave him money, he went to the market and met another man who had no legs. You should review God’s track record in your life and you will realise that many of you have come from nowhere to somebody. When you take time to review God’s track record, it would grow confidence that He would work in your present situation. Your situation is not like others’ but for the glory of God. You will grow confident that a solution is forthcoming and that God will never fail or abandon you because He never did so in the past. Be patient and let God answer your questions on His own schedule, not on yours. God’s time is the best. At His time, it is all good.\n\nWOMAN DELIVERED FROM INSATIABLE SEXUAL URGE\n\nAt the instance of the prophet, some of the striking incidents and prophecies of the previous Sunday service were visited on video. In course of the mass prayer, the prophet issued a message that there was a woman in the congregation whose sexual urge remained unsatisfied after she had a love encounter with a dog in her dream and he asked the woman in question to come out for deliverance. The woman having been delivered the previous Sunday, re-emerged accompanied by her husband as directed for a testimony. In her testimony, the woman who went by the name Tina Ekezie, narrated her encounter with a dog in her dream after which her marriage was destroyed. She had prayed and fasted but all to no avail. Her marriage after that lacked love for her husband and witnessed much quarrel and hatred. She however, added that after the deliverance her admiration for her husband fully surfaced again. In his testimony, the husband, Eugene Ekezie told the congregation that the radiance displayed by his wife was the function of his money when he was doing well as a kerosene dealer. Since his downfall however, his wife’s attitude and affection for him had become zero, causing a cat and dog relationship between them. Mrs Tina Ekezie knelt before her husband in apology for her past misbehaviour and promised a positive change. The man of God however promised to counsel them on their economic downturn, which seemed to have partially dissipated Tina’s affection.\n\nABANDONMENT LED WOMAN TO PROSTITUTION\n\nAnother clip revealed the prophet issuing a prophecy to a Kenyan lady as he laid hands on the congregation. In the prophecy, he saw the woman living where men were coming to her for sex. She was living as a harlot. The prophecy also added that her father abandoned her as a child and that frustration had led her to that style of life. It concluded that her father owed her an apology for all that. The lady who bore Nelly Wangari as her name confirmed the entire prophecy as true and she was delivered. She retold the prophecy and recounted all the hardship and name calling she went through because of her father’s behaviour. The man of God consoled her, told her that all was past, that God was her Father and that she would soon know why God allowed that suffering in her life.\n\nMAN SENT HIS WIFE PACKING BECAUSE OF RUMOUR\n\nThe next video clip unfolded the prophet as he issued a prophetic message to a man who sent his wife away on the rumour that she was enjoying an extra-marital relationship. The prophecy ended in two questions. The man was asked whether he was sure he had not sent an innocent woman away and how had his life been since he ejected his wife from the marital home. A man who called himself Emmanuel and the suspected wife emerged from the congregation to say the prophecy referred to them. In his testimony, the man said that neighbours used to tell him when he came home that his wife had developed the habit of going out often and coming in late and that she might have a lover outside. That was the basis of his action. The man of God however, told him that the wife was innocent and that the husband was to blame for the challenges that made her go out. In her testimony, Janet, the suspected wife said her husband sent her out because he suspected her with one man. The prophet confirmed her innocence and promised to reconcile them.\n\nMAN RECEIVED ONE MILLION NAIRA FOR HIS BURNT HOUSE\n\nA fairly aged man, Kayode by name, mounted the platform with a photograph of his burnt building and started by apologising to the man of God and the congregation that he had not been paying his tithes. He then added that his house was burnt because of the carelessness of one of his tenants with a generator. The entire roof of the storeyed building was burnt and needed rehabilitation. The man of God blamed him for his failure to contribute to the growth of the church in spite of his wealth. A cash gift of one million naira was given to him to put the building in order.\n\nANOINTING WATER ENDS TWELVE YEARS OF BARRENNESS\n\nA couple who named themselves as Mr and Mrs Oghobo mounted the stage to say they had been barren for twelve years before they received the Anointing Water. They prayed over the Anointing Water after fasting and met as a couple. That very month, according to the man, the woman missed her period. They had gone to many places and medical doctors in search of a pregnancy but without success. The man of God commended them for fasting before ministering the Anointing Water quite unlike many who would just gulp it as soon as they received it. Thanking God for His mercy on their lives, the couple wished their listeners the same fortune in the hand of the Lord.\n\nMIRACLE BABY CAME AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS OF BARRENNESS\n\nMrs Linda Chinwe and her miracle baby mounted the podium next for their testimony. According to her, she had been barren for fifteen years. Her sister in-law brought her to The SCOAN to collect the Anointing Water. It was that, according to her, that ended her infertility because as soon as they met as a couple, she became pregnant. At the time of the testimony, her baby was five months old. She thanked God for His mercy and advised her listeners to have faith in God.\n\nANOINTING WATER ENDS A SEASON OF MISCARRIAGES\n\nMr and Mrs Ani-Nweke climbed the platform to tell their listeners about their ugly experience with miscarriages. They said they came to The SCOAN to meet the man of God for that very reason and he gave them the Anointing Water. They met as a couple after ministering the Anointing Water and the wife became pregnant. They thanked God for His mercy in their lives.\n\nWOMAN DELIVERED SAFELY AFTER PROPHECY\n\nThe video clip revealed a prophecy given by Wise Man John Chi to a pregnant woman in which he reminded her of her unpleasant experience with her earlier pregnancy and her recent dreams in which she used to eat and see dead people. He told her that a similar misfortune might befall her, if she was not delivered. After delivering her, the wise man told her to go home and enjoy a safe delivery. At the end of the video clip, Mr and Mrs Chukwuma climbed the platform to say that the clip was about them. Mrs Chukwuma retold the story as already told on the clip and added that it was on the 14th of August, 2011 that she was in The SCOAN. Her husband added that she delivered her baby safely on the 6th of September, 2011. Both thanked God for His mercy and advised their listeners to take time to remember the way God had worked in their lives.\n\nANOINTING WATER CHANGED MANY LIVES IN INDIA\n\nThe next clip revealed how the Anointing Water worked wonders in the Church of Signs and Wonders, India where Pastor Narula ministered it. Practically everybody who received a spray of the Anointing Water fell down in deliverance. Many cases of healing and deliverance were recorded there, like in the other places where it had been ministered.\n\nSCHOLARSHIPS FOR CHILDREN OF WIDOWS AND PHYSICALLY CHALLENGED\n\nWidows and their children of school age trooped to the platform to receive cash gifts from the prophet to pay their fees for the term. Their spokespersons praised the man of God for making it possible for them to enjoy formal education without tears despite being orphans and seized the opportunity to appeal to other well-to-do Nigerians to emulate the good gesture of the prophet. Among those who spoke were Ebele, Ossai and Caroline Akinpelumu. One Alfred R. among them had physically challenged parents. A total sum of 6 million naira was disbursed to them. As usual, we always have cause to praise the Lord for His marvellous blessings in our lives. May His mighty name be extolled forever!\n\nAfter the choir had prepared the atmosphere with tunes for the Holy Spirit, Wise Man Christopher emerged for the Sunday message. Greeting the congregation warmly and wishing them easy transformation from darkness to light, he proceeded to pray with them. ‘I believe in your Word’, he went on, as the congregation repeated after him. ‘In your Word is my salvation, redemption and victory’, the wise man took the congregation through a length of heart- lifting prayer to the Lord. Beginning with a short story of a Christian friend who wondered why he had trials in his life in spite of his devotion to the work of God, the wise man advised that trials and tribulations were part of Christianity. In his words, the Bible says everyone who works with the Lord will have testing but that as a child of God, your trouble is not like others’; it is for the glory of God. Trouble comes not because of any wrong step but because we are in a complex and contradictory world. The children of God, according to him, are passing through this world to a place prepared for them. This Is Not Heaven, he aptly titled his message. Citing John 16:33 as his proof text, the wise man said Jesus overcame for us and so we shall overcome, though there will be disappointments, as said in the proof text. In 2 Corinthians 12:7-10, Apostle Paul derived strength from the Lord. My grace is made perfect in your weakness. Though Apostle Paul was tormented by a thorn in his flesh, the grace of Christ was sufficient for him and so for us, the wise man affirmed. Continuing, he said the thorn of Christ makes easy and sanctifies our thorns. Jesus took our place in afflictions. Troubles are designed for our spiritual development and to advance our course. Our situation could be to humble us but to leave us dignified at last. Spiritual burdens are ordered to cure spiritual pride. He allows poverty and setback to humble us. He will however, prepare us for it. Those God calls for service, He makes fit for it, Deuteronomy 28:7. The enemies will come in a united manner but they will be confounded and routed by the superior power of the Holy Spirit. Jesus is greater than all the combined forces of hell. He has conquered death for our sake to bring us to the Father. To hope is to look forward to a Heavenly home that will last forever. Stones were hurled at Stephen but his affection for God’s command was regular because of his hope, Acts 7:54. In Romans 8:35-39, Paul advised Christians to keep the solid front in the face of sickness. The rich should not concentrate on their wealth or the poor on their situation because a man may be poor, yet be a candidate of Heaven. Citing Luke 6:20- 26, the wise man recited the beatitudes. Don’t doubt the genuineness of your spiritual experience or question your sonship of Christ because of your situation. The promise of God can only be appropriated by faith which comes through hearing and obeying the Word of God. We were elected before the foundation of the world to inherit the Kingdom of God. Faith is a necessary condition to access Heaven. Faith purifies and justifies us and removes the guilt of sin. The opening of our eyes of faith is the silencing of our fears. Fear not, for those who are fighting for you are more than those out to destroy you. Because you know that Heaven is your permanent Home, let everything that has to do with you be redeemed now and forever, the wise man prayed in conclusion.\n\nTHE OBJECT OF FAITH IS GOD\n\nA lot of Christians, Prophet T. B. Joshua said, after commending the message, grumble and despair about their situation because their lives are centred on how they are doing. How clearly, he asked, do we really see our lives? When you look at your life, what do you see? Do you see your life the way Jesus sees it? Continuing, the prophet added, ‘A man I met yesterday told me that the Holy Spirit gave him an idea but advised him not to take the credit.’ Don’t take the credit, he echoed, is a Word from the Holy Ghost. It is all about Jesus, he said. All we do is to give back what we have received from His generous hands. Don’t take the credit, he reminded his listeners. Citing Mark 11:1, he said whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be removed’, and does not doubt in his heart, it will be done. The prophet emphasized the prayer of faith. The object of our faith is God. Have faith in God, Jesus said, according to him. Teaching today, he went on, encourages believers to have faith in faith. On the contrary, he maintained, it should be on the finished work of Jesus. Because He is good all the time, I can bring my request to Him and cast my cares upon Him. Why complain, murmur or despair? Realising that He is God and I am not; that He is a Father and I am but a child; He is a Shepherd; I am a straying sheep, I should have faith in God. We often hear, he continued, that prayer changes things but this is not entirely true. Prayer, he corrected, changes us; faith causes things to happen. Advising his listeners to have faith in God, he added, today we pray but lack the necessary faith to release the belief in our hearts. There is power in our mouth; the belief in our heart is released by faith out of our mouth. Faith requires us to speak the Word before we feel or see the result. The object of faith, he concluded, is God.\n\nTOTAL DELIVERANCE FROM EATING SAND\n\nDelivered the previous Sunday from the spirit of eating sand and mattress, Ammen in company with his mother appeared on the platform to confirm the deliverance after the video clip refreshed viewers’ minds. Mrs Izah, the mother joyfully told the congregation that her son no more had no appetite for those things after the deliverance. Confirming her mother’s testimony in response to the prophet’s questions, Ammen said that he wanted to be a pastor to pray for the sick, so that they would not die and agreed to submit himself to the fasting and prayer demanded by the profession.\n\nA woman from Anambra, Nigeria and her 14 year-old son took the platform and told the congregation that the son had been eating sand and mattress since the age of four. She added that her watching the deliverance of a girl from Tanzania on Emmanuel TV, fuelled her visit to The SCOAN regarding their plight. Enlightening his listeners on his affliction, Onyeka Ibiano said that at night, an object appeared to him and that caused the addiction to sand and mattress since that time. After touching and staring at him for a while, the prophet declared him free.\n\nMAN DELIVERED FROM THE SPIRIT OF ROBBERY\n\nA video clip revealed Wise Man Racine as he laid hands on worshippers and asking one man among them, ‘Who are you?’ ‘Nobody’, the man responded. Worried that the man’s deliverance was not thorough as he never opened up, the prophet insisted on his re-deliverance. Confirming that he never opened up, Chukwemeka Paul, accompanied by his wife, agreed to open up and told the story of his life. He admitted being a cultist in a group of boys who delighted in drinking, robbing and raping girls. Threatened in Nigeria, he went to Ghana where he discovered that security awareness was even higher and he decided to go into computer training. He married in Ghana but did not approach lovemaking in a normal way, afflicted by the spirit of raping. In a way he never quite understood, he found himself in The SCOAN and after his second deliverance, he demanded to know from the prophet whether the wife who had had twins by him was his God-given wife. He explained that they enjoyed no peace in their marriage and the wife often nagged, calling him a baby especially because of his age. He added that he enjoyed peace more with other women than with his wife. The wife narrated that the man lured her into cultism after she married him. They came into the relationship through a call given to her by the erroneous tapping of just a digit by the man who had intended to call his sister. She was not surprised because her church had told her that her prospective husband would locate her in such a manner. She however complained about the raping approach of her husband to lovemaking. The man of God delivered them and declared their marriage sanctified from Heaven.\n\nYOUNG LADY DELIVERED FROM MANY EVIL SPIRITS\n\nThe osude family from Anambra, Nigeria, though resident in Lagos, appeared on the platform for their testimony. According to the spokesperson among them, they came for the Monday service where Wise Man Christopher prayed and laid hands on them. But on Wednesday, they noticed that their sister, Ikechukwu started to display signs and antics of evil attacks causing her to be violent. It was in that state of violence that they brought her back to the church. As the wise man laid hands on Ikechukwu on the Monday in question, she opened up in a smile and Wise Man Christopher told her that he knew her and she knew he knew her. In her testimony after the second deliverance in the prayer line, she told her listeners that after the Monday service, she began to behave funnily and talk nonsense by Wednesday and so her family brought her to The SCOAN on Thursday. She said she possessed many evil spirits which gave her all sorts of powers that she used to wreck the lives of her parents and siblings. She said her misbehaviour began at the age of five, when she was afflicted with the spirits of lust and gluttony among others. At the age of five, she was fond of watching herself act before a mirror, where a woman appeared to her and asked her whether she would be her friend. She agreed and thereafter, she played with the woman often, though unnoticed by other people. She started having meetings in the spirit world and had astral powers by which she visited many parts of the world effortlessly. She attacked members of her family one after the other. She afflicted her father with high blood pressure and made him a debtor. She wrecked her mother’s business and rendered her sisters jobless in spite of their very good degrees in International Relations. At the end of her breath-taking and most surprising confession, she pleaded with the man of God to deliver her family from all the evils of the devil for the past 50 years.\n\nANOINTING WATER DELIVERS THE WORLD\n\nThe miraculous work of the Anointing Water in the four corners of the earth was shown on Emmanuel TV. In country after country where the Anointing Water was administered, the atmosphere became charged with anointing that set the devil and all its evil spirits in confusion and disarray. Many of the faithful in such locations became delivered from ailments which many prayers of yesteryears were yet to free them from. In eager anticipation of the miracles associated with the Anointing Water, congregants besieged the venues in their thousands before the appointed time of service. To the glory of God, they were not disappointed because many left the scene with testimonies of deliverance and healing. That was the picture in London, UK; Athens, Greece; Cape Town, South Africa; Accra, Ghana and other locations where the Anointing Water was ministered. In Cameroon, where the man of God had just okayed a house fellowship for a family about a month before, the congregation was so much that the man of God, in his surprise, never knew how to classify it. Equally amazing, according to the family granted the concession, was the dumbfounding work of the Anointing Water in deliverance and healing.\n\nWRISTBAND WRIGGLES POLICE OFFICER FROM DEATH\n\nMr John Mark of Kogi State but working in Katsina as a chief superintendent of police also mounted the platform for his testimony. He said he had come to The SCOAN on 31st December for a breakthrough service during the candle night. He added that the man of God prophesied about violence in the country and advised worshippers to obtain both the Anointing Water and the Wristband, which he did. On a date in May 2011, water came out of his Wristband unusually like sweat. Not quite sure how to react to the situation, he stayed put in his office until his phone rang and a voice asked him to take one of the vehicles for patrol on one of the major streets. He noticed that as he came out of the office, the sweat on the Wristband stopped. He never knew that at that time, hoodlums had come to plant bombs in the police premises. As soon as he drove out for the patrol, he had a terrible sound of the detonated bomb that brought the entire office down in rubbles. To his surprise, the portion of the office block where he hung the portrait of the man of God and the Anointing Water stood strong and unaffected by the bomb blast. The panel of investigators who had earlier suspected that he had secret knowledge of the blast before it happened, in view of the fact that it was just ten minutes after he left when the blast occurred, became convinced that his safety was the work of God when they saw the Anointing Water and the portrait still hanging safely. Before then, the service provider had no record too of the voice that invited him out of the office. It was the Holy Spirit, they then realised, that took him out of the office and death by that call. Thanking God for His mercy, Mr John Mark remarked that he had become a different person and that his life was no more his. As regards the breakthrough for which he came for the candle light service, Mr John told his listeners that he got it in many areas of his life.\n\nCEASED MENSTRUATION REVIVED AFTER LAYING HANDS\n\nMrs Ogeshi Okeke from Imo State joyfully mounted the podium to tell her listeners that after the hand- laying ceremony of the very day, she went to the ladies to check herself following the sensation she received when Wise Man Racine laid hands on her. She had, since her miscarriage last December, lost her menstruation and was longing for it. In the ladies, she saw that her menstruation had miraculously surfaced and she thanked God most spiritedly for the miracle, reassuring her listeners that everything happen at the opportune time and that nothing is beyond God. It is all praise to God almighty as we watch the miracles which we read in the Bible happening again ceaselessly in our time.\n\nIn the midst of the melodies from the choir, which set out to enhance the spiritual tune of the auditorium, Wise Man Daniel emerged to deliver his message. The wise man assured the congregation that God is always with them. In his words, our heavenly Father is concerned about us. He wants us to be physically healed and spiritually saved. We are here for a relationship forever with Him. Hard times cannot affect the relationship. It is in the mind of God to answer prayers. We may not understand Him because of our limitations. He tells us to be patient because there is time for everything. In a situation that seems to project failure, you should be careful to find out God’s opinion so that you will not end up rejecting His purpose for your life. The wise man entitled his message Let His Will Be Done. He cited Daniel 6:7, 9 – 11 as his proof text. Great men simply have great habits, the wise man remarked after reading the proof text. Commenting further, the wise man said Daniel never allowed the situation on ground to dictate his prayer. What a man of faith he was! He knew the danger involved in praying to his God yet he never allowed it to change his habit of praying daily to his God. Daniel had no reason to doubt God’s ability to deliver. He saw premature death as an early escape from this wicked world. He believed that physical death enhances spiritual transition towards God. Death, to a good man, is a release from this world to the enjoyment in Heaven. The best man in this world holds his position, honour and integrity no longer than God keeps him in it. By His grace, we are what we are.\n\nLET LOVE LEAD\n\nProphet referred the congregation to the words on The SCOAN Anointing Sticker : ‘Let Love Lead’ as he dwelt on the theme of love in his message. Drawing his listeners’ attention to 1 John 4, he advised them not to believe every spirit but to test the spirit whether it is of God. Citing verse 16 as a good summary of the ch apter, he added that God is love and he, who abides in love, abides in God for God is love. Citing 1 Corinthians chapter 13, the prophet averred that only three things will last on this earth; namely, faith, hope and love. The greatest, he said, is love. In his words, love looks around to see who is in need. We begin to succeed with our lives, he added, when the hurts and problems of others matter to us. The wound of one is the wound of all. Love frees us in the present. It is the present situation that presents problems. It is only through love that we are able to respond to God and to others in the present. First, you must forgive yourself and your neighbour. This is why Paul, the apostle made it clear that faith works by love in Galatians 5:6. What a danger, the prophet continued, is a religion of words, if there is no corresponding action! You have nothing but a mental assent without action. How does the love of God work in a man who only thinks and works with empty words, idle words? If you give everything you own to the poor but you do not love, no matter what you say, believe or do, you are bankrupt without love. Let love lead, the prophet re-echoed. Concluding, the prophet enjoined the congregation to pray that God will give them the grace to act on the message and do what the message says.\n\nDELIVERED FROM FEEDING ON SAND\n\nSylvia and Veila, delivered from addictions to foam mattresses and uncooked rice were in attendance in the service and testified that the spirits of addiction had not disturbed them in any way since their deliverance the previous Sunday. The prophet revealed that after witnessing their deliverances, many viewers with similar addictions had sent emails in throughout the week and many were present in the church that morning. One of those with a similar attack, according to his mother who brought him for deliverance, was Al Ammen, a son of a professor in Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria. As the mother put it, Al Ammen, now six years old, had been eating sand and foam mattress and all beating to stop him failed. He was also stubborn and rude, shouting at his parents without restraint in his wish to be in total control. Confirming his mother’s revelation, Al Ammen added that a strange voice of a man urged him to eat sand and foam mattress and he enjoyed eating them as food. He admitted shouting at his parents because, according to him, they disturbed him. Al Ammen was delivered by mere verbal interaction with the prophet who pronounced him free, in Jesus’ name. ‘Thank You, Jesus! I am free!’ Al Ammen reacted at his deliverance, telling the congregation that he used to eat sand and foam mattress but he would no more eat them. He also voiced a wish to become a .\n\nANOINTING WATER AROUND THE WORLD\n\nThe Anointing Water coupled with the miracles that go with it was also visited on the screen. This took Emmanuel TV viewers to many countries and places such as Cincinnati in Ohio, USA; The SCOAN branch in London, UK; Athens in Greece; Cape Town, South Africa and Accra, Ghana. In each and all of these locations, the power of God, the Almighty was clearly in evidence. Many people who had been held in bondage by contrary spirits were seen reacting to the ministration of the Anointing Water by shaking visibly and uncontrollably while others among them were vomiting or emitting all sorts of sound in deliverance. Among them were Shannon from Ohio, USA, Shannon who was healed of stomach problems and Patricia Ishemon from Texas who was set free from a witch doctor’s curse. She had nursed plans to visit The SCOAN in Lagos, Nigeria but when she heard the Anointing Water was nearby, believed that distance was not a barrier and received the touch she desired. Considering the distances the many bottles of the Anointing Water had travelled overseas from their source in The SCOAN, Lagos nevertheless their effectiveness was left unaffected, as the man of God aptly remarked, ‘What is of God is above all’.\n\nANOINTING WATER BRINGS FORTH A BABY\n\nMr Fidelis Chukwuka of Delta, Nigeria and his wife, Theresa with her baby mounted the platform for their testimony. The head of the family narrated that in June last year, he visited The SCOAN for the Anointing Water for his family that was barren for fifteen years. Their problems, as he revealed, were low sperm count on his part and irregular menstruation on the part of his wife; problems which 15 years of patronage of witch doctors and modern medicine could no solve. A month after receiving and administering the Anointing Water, according to Fidelis, his wife conceived. He happily told his listeners that they had come to thank God for their new baby whom they had named, Victory – for God Almighty had given them victory through the Anointing Water!\n\nPRAYER DISPLACES OPERATION\n\nMrs Helen Idahosa accompanied by her husband, Kenneth also mounted the platform for her testimony. Told that the only option she had in delivering her baby was through operation, Helen came to The SCOAN in fear, to seek the face of the Lord. Having been prayed for by Wise Man Racine and prophesied to of the safe delivery of a baby boy, Helen travelled back home relieved. When it was time for her to deliver, the same doctor who had prescribed operation assisted her in a natural delivery, made possible only through the prophetic word spoken by Wise Man Racine. As well as confirming his wife’s testimony, Kenneth thanked God for His blessing in his family.\n\nDELIVERED FROM HEALTH EFFECTS OF SPIRITUAL WIFE\n\nMr Pius from Cameroon but resident in the Republic Benin as a lecturer later ascended the platform. He narrated that something had fallen from him as one of the wi se men prayed for him in the prayer line. His problem, according to him, was that a spiritual wife appeared to him in the dream and destroyed his life. She would appear in different forms and while making love with him, Pius discovered that his manhood would appear very large. When he woke up from the dreams, he would discover that physically it would become smaller until it eventually became unusually small. He would also find himself in bruises and stripes as if he had been beaten, making him weak and feel robbed of affection for his earthly wife. Before the nightmares began, he continued, he used to weigh about 106 kilogrammes but currently weighed a mere 85 kilogrammes. His urine was coming out in many colours and sometimes it would appear as if he was menstruating. The problem began after he had a verbal argument with another man over a woman. He had sought the assistance of his wife and her father for his cure but to no avail. After a short interview, the man of God stretched his hand towards him in prayer in the power of the Holy Spirit and declared him free, in Jesus’ name.\n\nCOUPLE RECONCILED\n\nCaptain Godwin Amrorighoye and his wife, Mercy whom the man of God had revealed in a prophecy as having a cat-and-rat marital relationship and who had engaged in a fight before coming for the service of the previous Sunday, mounted the platform to narrate their story to the congregation. The woman accused her husband of wasting his money on women after he received a promotion and transfer to Bayelsa State, following prayer with the Anointing Water from The SCOAN. Even though by the promotion he became entitled to free accommodation, free feeding and a government car in his job, Godwin, his wife revealed, was going into debt. The wife wondered why he should owe anything with all the fringe benefits his recent promotion has brought to him. While they were together in Delta, he never owed a debt even with his smaller salary. All this fuelled the wife’s suspicion that he was involved in an extra-marital affair. That was the reason for the soured relationship between them, the woman submitted. In spite of his denial, Captain Godwin Amrorighoye unfortunately received a phone call from a woman in the presence of his wife. He answered the phone call hurriedly and harshly because of his wife who was watching with concern. Later, the wife had access to the phone number and replied the woman.\n\nThe prophet recapitulated many points and quotes from the message of the day’s service to advise the couple, the church and especially Captain Godwin Amrorighoye to appreciate the need for mutual respect for each other in a marriage, so that no partner in the marital union would feel belittled. He thereafter delivered Captain Godwin Amrorighoye from the contrary spirits that threatened the peace of their marriage.\n\nWithout doubt, the entire congregation of The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations worldwide and viewers of Emmanuel TV cannot thank the Almighty God enough for this opportunity to visit the days of Christ on earth in this Church. May the Lord’s name be praised forever!\n\nIn full radiance for the festivities of Easter and located on a dais replete with artistic decorations that speak for the season, the choir crooned melodies to put the congregation in mood and spirit for the day’s worship after which Wise Man Christopher mounted the altar to give the message. Describing Easter as a period set aside to commemorate the resurrection of Jesus Christ who paid the supreme sacrifice for the forgiveness of our sins, the wise man added the Lord died, rose and reigns in power for us. Citing Romans 5:6, Wise Man Christopher asserted that Christ’s resurrection is the foundation of our Christian faith. But for His resurrection, he maintained, our faith would have been futile. In his message entitled, ‘He Has Risen’, the wise man maintained that when the eyes of our faith are opened, we see God. We know God’s opinion about ourselves and others. By his rising, death is swallowed up in victory. All our worries and troubles are swallowed up in victory. His death accomplished salvation for mankind. The death of Christ makes it unnecessary for anyone to suffer any affliction. God sees trouble as an opportunity to glorify His name. ‘What is your trouble?’ He asked.\n\nElaborating on specific strands of the wise man’s message, Prophet T. B. Joshua informed the congregation that there was no peace by His chastisement but by His blood shed on the Cross. He advised his listeners to follow Jesus bearing His cross, reproach and patiently submit to all His suffering. When Jesus was suffering, some of His best friends were but spectators and onlookers, the prophet added. Jesus was delivered up to be crucified and at crucifixion, He said, ‘Father, forgive them.’ Using the expression, ‘Father, forgive them’ as his foundation, the prophet urged the congregation to imbibe the virtue of ‘forgiveness’ in their daily living.\n\nTWO MEMBERS OF MY PEOPLE’S FC DOMINATE SOCCER IN EUROPE\n\nThe prophet announced the arrival of two members, Messrs Sani Emmanuel and Onazi Ogenyi of My People’s Football Club from Italy where they had been after signing a contract with Lazio – a renowned football club in Italy – which was clearly impressed with the skill of the duo in the game of football after watching them in course of their trials there. In the league match with Premavera where they took part, the two were very instrumental for the victory of their team as Sani scored the first goal within ten minutes of the first half and the second goal in the second half. The other team was awarded a penalty but they lost it. However, they later scored one goal to make it 2-1. Along the line, Mr Onazi scored the third goal while a teammate scored the last goal with a penalty giving them a 4-1 win over the other team. In the last four matches where the duo featured, they constantly defeated their opponents ignominiously. According to the man of God who foresees a very bright future for the duo in their chosen career, he had decided to imbue them with an international outlook in football by sponsoring them to visit reputable clubs overseas and practice with renowned players to make them develop more confidence in themselves regarding soccer. In this regard, the duo were sponsored to Sweden where they joined Boden BK Football Club. They were also in Switzerland where they equally hobnobbed with Young Boys Club, St Gallens, Basel FC. In the same way, they visited Chelsea Football Club, Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, Panathinaikos FC in Athens and SS Lazio FC in Italy where they signed a contract after trials, in which they impressed their host club. After a month, Mr Onazi was privileged to join the first team and also participated in the match against Napoli FC. The prophet told his listeners that he would not count costs in ensuring that the boys’ full potentials were exploited to make them among the best in the world in the game of football. He added that they had just arrived from Italy to give thanks to God in the Synagogue for their brilliant performances and victories in the matches they played in Italy.\n\nThanking the man of God for his unwavering commitment to their development in football, Mr Sani Emmanuel, who by extraction hails from Edo State, re-echoed the prophet’s promises to see them through to the ‘promised land’ in their chosen career as a father and mentor. He recalled his days in My People’s FC in Lagos when, by the grace of God, he took part in the Under 17 World Cup in 2009 playing for Nigeria. It was there, according to him, that he was honoured with the title, Most Valuable Player (MVP). It is worth recalling that he was the second highest goal scorer in that tournament. Since then, he asserted, the man of God had remained indefatigable in ushering them from one football club to another in Europe to have their skills honed. In the same vein, Onazi Ogenyi, a Nigerian from Benue State, thanked the prophet as the source of the confidence for all their feats and victories in football. By the prophet’s unfathomable magnanimity, he went on, they had visited a catalogue of teams in Europe through which they had the privilege to hobnob with renowned players such as Drogba of Ivory Coast and Peter Croach of Tottenham Hotspur among others. He specially thanked God for His grace on them in their chosen career.\n\nTHE ANOINTING WATER IN THE US\n\nRegarding the new Anointing Water, the prophet intimated that prayer line would hardly be necessary if the Anointing Water were applied as directed. In endorsement of the wish of the congregation to watch the Washington DC edition of the miraculous powers of the Anointing Water, the prophet directed that the video clip be activated. The clip revealed an array of faithful who were gathered in eager anticipation of the Anointing Water about which they had gleaned much from the Emmanuel TV. Many of them said they used to worship with Emmanuel TV before they would go to their original churches of worship. In the activated video clip, they surged forward in turns to receive an administration of the Anointing water after which they thanked God for their immediate healing. Many of them with contrary spirits found themselves writhing on the floor following the spraying of the Anointing Water on them. On deliverance, they would get up and thank God. A lady among them, who confessed she had attempted to commit suicide and was consequently hospitalized, received deliverance after being sprayed with the Anointing Water and testified to her freedom from depression and other ailments after the deliverance. Another woman who complained of stomach pain was also healed with the Anointing Water. The same was true of another lady named Mary whose case was difficulty in walking. According to Mary, for five years she had consulted five doctors but her problem remained intractable until it faced the healing fire of the Anointing Water. Many others were healed from ailments of varied descriptions and all thanked God for the Anointing Water.\n\nFORGIVENESS AS A PANACEA FOR THE PROBLEMS OF IVORY COAST\n\nOn the unbelieving stance of many African leaders, the prophet recalled how the past Ivorian President had responded to his prophecy regarding the recent political turmoil in Ivory Coast, telling the prophet in reaction that, of all the men of God he had consulted, only Prophet T. B. Joshua foresaw the impending crisis in his country.\n\nThe prophet took advantage of this to sound a note of warning to the incumbent president, advising him to embrace the virtue of forgiveness if he wanted to succeed as a ruler in his country. In the prophet’s words, Ouattara will succeed by forgiving and forgetting. He should solicit the support of everybody. Unless he does this, there will be trouble. It is a generational curse and only forgiveness can break it. The prophet saw a few pockets of antagonism in the country continually disturbing the peace and only a general amnesty can undo them.\n\nANOINTING WATER BREAKS THEIR BARRENNESS\n\nMr Ologbenga Folunronsho whose wife had been diagno-, diagno-, diagno-, diagno-, diagnOSED with multiple fibroids which rendered them barren for a long time happily came to the platform accompanied by his wife carrying their baby for a testimony. They had tried many other places for a solution to their barrenness but to no avail before they finally visited The Synagogue Church Of All Nations where their solution had been awaiting them. As soon as the wife received administration of the Anointing Water, she was compelled to make the toilet her home where she discharged the fibroid piecemeal. This over, she embraced her husband in a spousal intimacy and conceived the same month. They came to the church brimful with gratitude to God for their bouncing baby girl. The entire church got up in unison to dance in thankfulness to God for the gift of a baby to the very famous couple. In view of the continuation service scheduled for 10am Monday, the congregation conceded to the grace to bring the service to a close.\n\nAfter the songs of praise and worship by which the day’s service commenced were over, Wise Man Daniel proceeded to give the message entitled, ‘Trusting In Christ’s Suffering’ by which he reminded the congregation that Christ died on the Cross to provide our needs which he said were healing, deliverance, blessing among others. He cited 1st Peter 2:21-24 as his proof text. Dwelling on the significance of Palm Sunday, he averred that that the Lord’s instruction regarding the donkey was characteristically not vague. Jesus is a Man of vision who says what He means and means what He says. His was instruction in boldness, certainty, righteousness and power. His rebuke was for our peace. His death was miserable and His disciples must be ready to bear His cross. By His suffering there is assurance of life for us.\n\nANOINTING WATER STOPS ISSUE OF BLOOD\n\nAfter the prophet’s usual introductory remarks about the new Anointing Water, there was a surge of congregants wishing to testify to the instrumentality of the Anointing Water. The first person to enjoy the opportunity of giving a testimony was Mrs Elizabeth Aghachiebonam of Ebonyi State, though resident in Abuja. Her problem, according to her, was the issue of blood for two years. She recounted the trouble her husband had taken to find a solution for her in hospitals and churches without hitting any success. The problem started as internal heat and generated pain all over her body making her pass through sleepless nights. While people would be sleeping at night, she would see herself restless and reeling in pain. Coming to The SCOAN on the Thursday preceding the Sunday of testimony, she said she received the Anointing Water immediately on arrival and administered it on herself in compliance with the instruction. As soon as she applied it, the bleeding stopped. She happily told the congregation that she had started enjoying her nightly sleep and comfort of body following the staunching of the blood. She seized the opportunity to advise her listeners to have faith in the Lord, their Creator who is always there for them in times of need.\n\nANOINTING WATER OBVIATES OPERATION\n\nThe next testimony was given by the Akhere family. Mrs Akhere had been told by her doctor that she would require operation to deliver her baby because of her tight cervix. She therefore visited The SCOAN to seek the face of the Lord. She received the Anointing Water and administered it on herself in prayer for safe delivery. After this, she delivered her baby safely without operation. They named their baby Harry after Wise Man Harry. They profusely thanked God with whom, they recognized, nothing is impossible.\n\nANOINTING WATER AND GOD’S OMNIPRESENCE\n\nThe omnipresent nature of God was demonstrated with the Anointing Water in many parts of the world. The video clips revealed the work of the Anointing Water in other countries of which Greece was one. The clip showed a woman, Shaze Qualli who for twelve years depended on crutches for movement. The Anointing Water dispelled all the darkness in her and delivered her from all pain and infirmity. Another man who depended on crutches for movement was also delivered in the same way. There were many who, hitherto in the throes of contrary spirits, fell down under the anointing of the Holy Spirit and were delivered with the administration of the Anointing Water.\n\nA similar feat was revealed in Ghana where a woman who had not been able to walk for years was declared free by an evangelist spraying the Anointing Water on her and she responded immediately by standing up to walk. A young man was also freed from evil spirits and he thanked God having been delivered through the medium of the Anointing Water. Mr John, a sergeant in the Ghanaian army, had for five years been incapacitated because of an injury he sustained in an accident. Spraying the new Anointing Water on him, an evangelist declared him free and he resumed walking immediately.\n\nANOINTING WATER RESTORES HEAD TO SHAPE\n\nWhile the congregation was engrossed watching these miracles from other countries, an evangelist in The SCOAN had seen a young man in the church arranged in the prayer line because of a development in his head which made the head assume a very abnormal shape. The evangelist proceeded to spray the new Anointing Water on the head and, soon after, pus began to ooze from the head miraculously. In no time the head regained its normal shape after all the pus had come out. This was possibly the greatest miracle of the day as the evacuation of the pus left no mark or scar on the head after restoring the head to shape.\n\nMARITAL UNDERSTANDING ACHIEVED\n\nThe next was the reconciliation of Mr and Mrs Elizabeth Aghachiebonam as hinted in the previous service. The next paragraph entitled MISUNDERSTANDING WORDS OF PROPHECY was their story in a nutshell at the end of service the week before. But to the glory of God, the couple reappeared on the platform this Sunday to thank God for their successful reconciliation and for the grace of understanding and appreciating each other the more as a couple. The very striking element of the reconciliation was the dream, Stella, the wife had in which she was told by Prophet T. B. Joshua to remove the ring and bangle on her hand. Contrary to her thinking that she never had those ornaments on her body to remove, the prophet proceeded beyond her skin into her bone to dislodge those ornaments which were an attestation to her union with a spiritual husband. The removal of these ornaments by the prophet marked a turning point in her marital relationship with IK, her earthly husband. The prophet once more appeared to her in a second dream and advised her to relate well to her husband and make ‘forgiveness’ a watchword in their marriage as there is no perfect person or relationship on earth. By the time she wanted to react to the prophet in the dream, he had vanished having laid a formidable spiritual foundation for the marriage. In his reaction, Mr Ikechukwu thanked the prophet for the effectual reconciliation. He added that they had been to the Mountain to pray in the effort to restore peace and love to their marriage. He once more thanked God and the man of God for the restored peace in their marriage.\n\nMISUNDERSTANDING WORDS OF PROPHECY\n\nThe next video clip was among other reasons activated to correct the culpable presumptions among the congregants regarding the import of prophecies issued to them. In the said repartee between Wise Man Christopher and Mrs Ezekwelome,the latter corrected the wise man erroneously about her marital status. When Wise Man Christopher cautioned her to be careful about disappointments, the lady misinterpreted the expression and promptly told the wise man that she was already married. Making himself clearer, the wise man told her that he knew that. He was, on the contrary, simply warning her about the possible collapse of the marriage if care was not taken. Luckily for the wise man, her husband was around to add that he had sent her home the previous week because of her perceived misdemeanour. Defending herself on the last score, Mrs Ezekwelolome, a non working housewife, deprecated the repression she suffered in the hands of her husband who additionally habitually made her account for every kobo she received from him. She strongly felt that her views and wishes to engage in some private business deserved consideration by her husband. In his defence, the husband stated that apart from taking full charge of her education, he had sponsored her trips to France, Egypt and the United States of America. Her recent wish to go to Dubai for business in gold would put the entire family at risk apart from rendering him the sole caretaker of the children. Speaking on behalf of the womenfolk, about four women in the congregation expressed support for the husband and praised him for his consideration for the welfare of the entire family while advising the wife to be contented with the contributions of the husband to her well-being. The prophet, while inviting them to a reconciliation meeting, expressed the view that a marriage where both participants saw themselves as equally gifted in sophistication and intelligence and neither was ready to bow to the other was indeed a difficult one to manage but with God all things are possible.\n\nMAN DELIVERED FROM IMPOTENCE\n\nMr Ameni Shabani of Congo DRC mounted the platform to confirm his deliverance from impotence last Sunday during the service. He had lost his wife to a houseboy because of his inability to dose sexual gratification to her. He lost his sexual virility when he was made to drink some concoction and wash himself with the water. He said his wife accused her of not finding time for her but added that he spent all his time looking for money for his wife in order to make the home comfortable. Both his wife and the houseboy took advantage of his loss of virility to redefine their relationship and started a sexual intimacy resulting in the loss of the wife to the houseboy. Mr Shabani added that his eloped wife later told him that only one of the two children they had together was his. It was for that reason he decided to leave both children for her till when he hoped to establish his paternity by DNA. Both ex-wife and houseboy now live together in South Africa. In answering the prophet’s question, Shabani stated that it was painful to lose his wife to a houseboy but in his state of loss of manhood then, there was nothing he could do. He was however happy for his deliverance which has put him in a position to consider getting married again. He expressed the hope of coming to The SCOAN after marriage on ‘a thank you mission’ with his new wife. He thanked God and the man of God for his restoration.\n\nINTREPID JOURNEY TO SEE PROPHET\n\nThe next testimony was given by a young man, Mr Jeff Katanga from Zambia who came all the way from Zambia crossing not less than seven countries in a very long, tortuous and dangerous journey to Nigeria. The young man in question lost both parents recently in quick succession and found himself the caretaker of his siblings. The only hope for him in the present situation when he suddenly became the father of his siblings was Prophet T. B. Joshua. He saw the prophet as the only man who could offer him and his siblings financial help, going by what he had gleaned from Emmanuel TV. It was for that reason that he borrowed money from a widow and travelled from Zambia through Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Sudan, Chad and Cameroon to Nigeria. He particularly had challenges in Sudan which was half way between his country and Nigeria because of the civil war there. He was encouraged in his state of penury and physical exhaustion by the fact that if he could get to the Prophet, his condition would change for the better. He spent a total of thirty days on the way before getting to Nigeria on 19th January 2011. Unlike what many would do, he never wanted to shout to the man of God for help but decided to remain prayerful and fasting till God would reveal him to the prophet. He had decided not to be led by his situation because, as he learnt from Emmanuel TV, in every situation God is saying something. He deliberately took refuge in the vicinity of the church till God would reveal him in his plight to the prophet. Truly, when the prophet became aware of him, he welcomed him with the words, ‘You are in your Father’s house’ and promised him that when he would go back, he would enjoy a flight in contradistinction to the risky manner in which he had travelled to Nigeria. In response to the question on what he would have done supposing he never saw the prophet on arrival, he said he would have nigerianized rather than repeat that ordeal back to Zambia. The man of God praised him for his faith, courage and dogged will to succeed in life assuring him that he could see a bright future for him. The man of God however made it clear that his warm reception of the young man should not serve as an incentive for other young men to embark on such risky journeys. Assuring the congregation of prompt resumption of prophetic worship at 10 am the following day, he piloted the service to a close.\n\nIn his message entitled, ‘Find out the truth’, Wise Man Harry referred the congregation to excerpts from the Bible to make his case, underscoring John 7:11-18 as the proof text. In Thessalonians 5:21 we are advised to test everything and hold fast to the truth. Jesus is the truth. He speaks the truth; He is not out to confuse us. To know the truth is to know Jesus. NEW ANOINTING WATER HEALS WOMAN OF DIABETES\n\nAs soon as the message was over, Prophet T.B. Joshua re-echoed the potency of the new Anointing Water and that immediately attracted testimonies by those who received it in the previous service. The first among them, Madam Patience from Sokoto who had suffered from diabetes for nine years, said that after receiving the new Anointing Water, she prayed over it and administered it as instructed. She went to bed for the night rest after administering it. According to her, she slept peacefully like a baby and woke up hale, hearty and strong. She was more or less recreated during her sleep and all the infirmities and aches which used to be part and parcel of her frame gave way for the freshness and agility brought about by the new Anointing Water. She used to urinate four or five times in the night but after administering the new Anointing Water, she urinated only once. At present, she hardly remembers whether she urinates at all in the day. She stopped all her medication for the week without sensing any adverse effects on herself. In her unmistakeable joy, she christened the Anointing Water, ‘The father of fathers’ and thanked God profusely for her miraculous healing.\n\nNEW ANOINTING WATER WINS CONTRACT\n\nEmmanuel from Rivers State mounted the platform for his testimony. According to him, he had been jobless for the past two years but the miracle in his life came after he had administered the Anointing Water. The contract he had applied for and been waiting for the past two years was miraculously approved. Displaying the contract agreement papers as he gave his testimony, he informed the congregation that it was an N18,000,000.00 contract. He thanked God and Prophet T.B. Joshua for the wonderful opportunity to transform his life brought about through the medium of the Anointing Water. NEW ANOINTING WATER SAVES MAN IN ACCIDENT Christopher from Delta State was one of those who received the new Anointing Water. He always prayed with it and sprayed it on his family and himself. On the fateful day of testimony, he watched Emmanuel TV and was struck by the phrase, ‘Stop satan from killing and stealing’, which made him touch the screen in faith. After work the same day, he decided to travel to his village. He travelled in a commercial bus which unfortunately was involved in a head-on collision with another vehicle. This caused his vehicle to somersault a number of times. Ten people died in the bus but luckily for Christopher, he was tossed from the seat behind the driver which he had taken, to the boot of the bus where he saw himself in a flat posture. He lay alive, hale, hearty and without any injury all because of the new Anointing Water which was his celebrated antidote. The other vehicle also recorded some deaths as a result of the accident. Thanking God for his safety, he aptly remarked that but for the new Anointing Water, he would have been in the mortuary. We join him indeed in thanking God for the new Anointing Water which veered his path from the mortuary. NEW ANOINTING WATER STOPS BEDWETTING Priscilla from Ghana also mounted the rostrum for a testimony in praise of the new Anointing Water. Her problem had been bedwetting for which reason she had been to many places in her desperation for a cure but all to no avail. As soon as she heard of the new Anointing Water, she and her husband came to The SCOAN where she received a vial of the new Anointing Water. She applied it after prayer as instructed and her bedwetting promptly stopped. The problem of many years was wiped away without effort by the new Anointing water. Priscilla and her husband thanked God profusely for her miraculous healing. ANOINTING WRISTBAND HEALS ANKLE-SHIFT Miss Ozidzor Jay from Ghana had the problem of ankle shift in January. In February, a friend brought her the new Anointing Wristband from The SCOAN. She apparently undermined it and kept it somewhere until the prophet’s voice from Emmanuel TV told her that she had the solution to her problem but she kept on complaining. In reaction, she immediately brought out her Anointing Wristband and wore one on her ankle and the other on her wrist. The result was immediate and miraculous healing. She was among those who celebrated automatic healing on the platform. PROPHET’S PRAYER REPLENISHES NGO’S PURSE Christaline Vekabiart from Namibia has put in place an NGO which goes by the name Mount Sinai Centre. The NGO cares for HIV patients and the needy. Her NGO takes care of the needy and children of those who are HIV infected. They take it as their duty to supply the children of the HIV patients with milk as a way of shielding them from HIV infection which they would get from their biological parents through breast feeding. Finding it difficult to keep up with the pace of demands owing to dwindling fortunes, Christaline appealed to the man of God for prayer in this regard through her sister-in-law who was visiting The SCOAN on a Friday. On Saturday night, Christaline had a dream in which the man of God laid hands on her and prayed for her. The result was that soon after that, they got a donation of $100,000.00. With this generous donation, they became better placed for effectiveness in their mission. This good news spurred the man of God who added twenty thousand dollars to their funds. Christaline thanked God for His love and mercy advising that as children of God, we should led love lead. FOOT ULCER HEALED AT PRAYERLINE About the time for the prayer line, the man of God, to lift people’s faith up, caused a video clip of Christian Amadi to be activated. A diabetic patient at the beginning, Christian was unfortunate to develop an ulcer in his foot. The ulcer did a lot of damage to his foot, causing it to rotten and disfigure with puss and festered flesh. It was at that stage that he came for prayer in The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations and Wise Man Daniel prayed for him at the prayer line. Now, Christian is completely healed and came forward to confirm the healing. He joyously stamped the foot on the ground and touched it to demonstrate the miraculous work of God. His case was good enough to give patients of ulcer in the prayer line hope as truly, our problems do not embarrass God because He has all the solutions. INTERNATIONAL CRIMINALS RECLAIMED Chidi, the international armed robber who vomited an egg some three weeks before in course of the mass prayer and who finally was delivered from the spirits of destruction, killing and stealing, was asked by the man of God to go home to bring his parents as part of his final integration into society after he had been counselled and fed with the Word of the Lord in the church. It is to be recalled that Chidi and his gang of armed robbers had called at The SCOAN as they went to the eastern part of the country to assassinate a pastor. They met their waterloo in the scheme and Chidi was the only survivor in the gang. As he called at the church again to wreak vengeance on the prophet suspected by him to be the cause of their failed mission, he was arrested in the church by the Holy Spirit. Chidi fetched his father whom he had not seen for six years as he was fully involved in his life of robbery and human wastage. The father, Michael Odeh, accompanied the son to the church after his full explanation of T.B. Joshua’s wish to see members of the family. The mother however, never came because of her disbelief in her son, Chidi. The father recounted the suffering he had been through in the hands of those his son had wronged. He however thanked God for using Prophet T.B. Joshua to recover his son from bad ways into a decent lifestyle. The prophet gave Chidi the sum of N200,000.00 and five bags of rice in addition to a scholarship if he was interested in furthering his education. The next rescued criminal is one Emmanuel Ogbonnah who at a stage in his life of hooliganism wanted to use his parents for a money ritual. Lured to the church by the happenings he watched on Emmanuel TV, he decided to have a personal experience of the church by attending a Sunday service in the church. He too had been arrested in the church by the Holy Spirit and had been hosted for about three weeks in the church during which time he enjoyed a diet of Biblical instruction and related lessons. He too was sent home to his parents to invite them to come and be part of the ceremony of his reintegration in society after being certified free from criminal intentions and capable of contributing to the growth and safety of the same society. His mother and sister who had lost contact with him for three years accompanied him to The SCOAN in response to the prophet’s invitation after the initial fear and hesitation. According to the mother, Emmanuel went out of control at the death of his father in 1995 to take to robbery. The mother, Mary Ogbonah by name, disclosed that Emmanuel was the sixth out of eight children they had in their marriage. The sister added that after the death of their father, their relations who should help them to restrain Emmanuel from evil ways abandoned them to their fate. Emmanuel knelt down in apology to his mother and sister as enjoined by the man of God for the bad life he had lived in the past and the pain that had been to the family. In his own testimony, Emmanuel disclosed how humane and people friendly he had become after his deliverance. Before he was delivered, he used to see human beings like animals that could be killed at will. On behalf of Emmanuel TV and Partners, the prophet gave Emmanuel the sum of N200, 000.00, three bags of rice and a scholarship. STUDENT OBTAINS SCOLARSHIP FOR ROOMMATE A moving scene it was when a video clip of last Monday’s noon service was activated and revealed a young man currently a student of Niger Delta University, Wilberforce Island pleading with the man of God for financial assistance for his roommate, a 300 level student of Geology who had not been able to resume school in the session because of financial constraints. The roommate in question lost his father in 1994 and had been taking care of his education by his sole efforts. This session, he decided to abandon his studies as he never had the sum of N49,500.00 required to pay his school fees. His plan was to come to the school, pack his books and call it quits to university education. His roommate and friend, Sipi took it upon himself to bring him to The SCOAN where he cried to the man of God to have pity on his friend and render him all the financial assistance he needed to be able to resume studies. In his characteristic quick response to the call of the needy, the prophet gave Sipi’s friend twice the amount of money that he needed for registration this session when he released the sum of N100,000.00 and three bags of rice to him. They both thanked God, the prophet and Emmanuel TV and Partners for the gesture. EMMANUEL TV RELEASES PRISONER AND ENRICHES HIM Mr John Okoh whose death sentence was commuted to life jail and then a miraculous release after spending 22 years in Calabar prison as told in The SCOAN’S Sunday service records of last Sunday also mounted the platform for blessing and reward by the man of God. Mr John who at 45 had spent half of his life in jail was given the sum of N200,000.00 and five bags of rice for which he thanked the man of God promising to spend the money judiciously as he goes to start a new life. FIRE VICTIM GETS CASH GIFT FROM PROPHET Another family that benefited from the church through The Emmanuel TV and Partners was that of Frank Odjugo. On Tuesday of the previous week about 8pm, his attention was drawn to two motor-cycles in flames by the storey building he stayed in. Unknown to him, it was the fire from the ground floor of the building that ignited the motor-cycles. Before long, his children informed him of the inferno in the storey building and they rushed down to save their lives. The fire razed the building to the ground to render the family as a people without a roof over their heads. The man had to immediately look for a make -shift structure to shelter his family until he could recover sufficiently from the shock to plan his life again. He received a cash gift of N500,000.00 and seven bags of rice from the prophet in the interim. The congregation was happy to learn about the continuation of the service on Monday noon where many of them hope to enjoy a closer interaction with the prophet.\n\nThe prefatory adoration melody over, Prophet T.B. Joshua mounted the altar to minister to the congregation. He assured the assembly that God was with them and that they should be in the attitude of prayer as the message for the service was being delivered, reminding them that the message would deliver them. Soon after, Wise Man Daniel took over the baton to deliver the message. In the same fervour as the prophet, Wise Man Daniel evoked ebullience in the Church, in the presence of the Lord.\n\nIn the words of the Wise Man, the Bible makes us understand that the name, Jesus Christ has authority and power among those committed to His glory. Christ’s duty is to raise us from death and restore the wholeness and fellowship between God and man. Power comes through the Holy Spirit to those who accept Jesus. In His name you can! A Christian, according to the Wise Man, should depend entirely on the power of Christ, if he must overcome satan. Citing Mark 16:15-20, the Wise Man told the Church that the name, Jesus can drive out demons and poison will not have the power to harm believers. Those who depend solely on God’s power show the evidence of this power in them. They are also the people who can move mountains in His name. Citing Mark 16:17, he said the text advises us to kick the devil out of our lives and the lives of others. Ephesians 1:21 says Christ has dominion over all powers and authorities on earth and in Heaven. In His name you can make wonderful things happen!\n\nMounting the altar once more, Prophet T.B. Joshua cited Matthew 9:18-32, where a man who could not talk was brought to Jesus and He cast out the demon (rather than heal the man) and the man spoke. The prophet remarked that there is the spirit of bondage which causes affliction. The sin of the soul is the cause of sickness, poverty and other problems and when you are delivered, you are free and blessed and this is why, he said, everybody needs deliverance. If one is healed without the spirit being delivered, the healing is only momentary as the spirit will cause a relapse of the ailment. To be blessed effectually, you need deliverance because there is a spirit of bondage from which you need deliverance. Deliverance is taking one from the dark kingdom to light. It is making one a channel of light where there is darkness. When your sins are forgiven, you are delivered.\n\nTESTIMONIES RESTORED\n\nThe prophet looked in retrospect at the major events of the previous Sunday service and remarked that man treats but God heals. One of those who received their miraculous healing was,\n\nMr Isiaka Sadik Fache, an ulcer patient from Okene, Kogi State. He got not merely a healing but also a replacement of his tibia. The leg in question (right leg) sustained a fracture and was rotten to the bone as a result of the ulcer that became chronic in defiance of treatment in both hospitals and traditional medical homes for two years. At a stage in the hospital, iron was fixed in the leg but it never gave the relief much sought after. Consequently, both the hospital authorities and his relations considered amputation as wise and inevitable. Fache, however resisted the idea, being used to the miracles relayed on Emmanuel TV. Much against the advice of his people, Fache came to The Synagogue and he was arranged on the prayer line. As soon as the prophet stretched his hand at him and declared him free on the prayer line, the excruciating pain which propelled the ulcer disappeared. He went home and watched the gradual healing of the leg. As he was having a bath at home, he saw that some bone in the affected area fell off. He became afraid that that might be another problem to contend with. Contrary to his fears however, the Lord was doing something about his effectual healing. The Lord was supplying a spare part to replace the damaged bone and in truth, Mr Fache became healed with a new bone. Mr Fache displayed the damaged and rejected bone on a sheet of newspaper as he told his story to the congregation that listened with rapt attention. Today, Mr Fache can contest in a game of 100 metres with anybody!\n\nThe next testimony came from a couple whose male partner received a prophecy in the Church that the wife, like her own mother, had the spirit of lust and that it was a generational curse. As the prophecy was being issued, the man called his wife, Adeola whom the prophecy referred to. On her way to meet her husband in response to the call, she was enmeshed in a web of spiritual frenzy, declaring herself a queen. She told the prophet that she was a queen of the river and that her husband was her wife much to the consternation of all. She vowed never to recognise the authority of her husband as she was a queen. This satanic assertion apparently sent cold shivers down the spine of the husband and the man of God had cause to tell him not to be afraid. Reeling on the floor in the frenzy of the manifestation, she displayed uncanny bravado in utterances and unwillingness to relent. On his part, the husband voiced his refusal to continue with the relationship as he had contracted a new relationship with another lady, who incidentally was present in the Church at the time. The husband accused Adeola of infidelity both outside the matrimonial home and even defiling the marital bed when he travelled. On account of her marital malfeasance, the husband decided to abort the marriage.\n\nThe prophet however, advised him to reconsider his decision because the Adeola who misbehaved as a mermaid in the past was quite different from the delivered Adeola who had become an epitome of love and care for him and the children. He added that the new relationship with the other woman should be discontinued even though it had advanced almost too far to contemplate that idea. The man of God assured the new lady, whom he never allowed to come out, that he would point her way to success and more marital bliss than she could ever get from the present man. On that note, Adeola and her husband were delivered from a marriage of insolence, insubordination and infidelity to the much desired spate of conjugal bliss in a capsule propelled by the trio of prophecy, deliverance and reconciliation.\n\nPicking a strand from the web of interlocking factors for broken homes, the prophet asserted that demons are the causes of broken homes. Accusing individual members of the family of wrongdoing, does not hit the root of the problem. According to him, families should be reconciled and put on the right course. It was the demonic spirit in Adeola that committed the crime and so the person of Adeola should not be punished. Jesus came to restore the relationship and fellowship between God and man.\n\nANOINTING WATER TESTIMONIES\n\nMr and Mrs Paul Udeh gave a startling testimony about The Anointing Water. According to Paul, his case differed from that of others who had low sperm count. In his own case, there was no sperm cell in his semen. That was the reason the couple remained barren for twelve years as no hospital or traditional medicine could provide a solution. He, wise enough, came for The Anointing Water and got one which they applied and soon after, his wife, Nicky became pregnant and bore him a son. By that, he became happy as his penis was no more for urinating alone but also for procreation. They named their miracle son, Treasure. His wife, he added, nursed the pregnancy for nine months without complications. At the time of the testimony, Treasure was only ten months but Nicky was already pregnant again. The bitterness which plagued the family for twelve years has turned to joy, thanks to The Anointing Water. In her testimony, Nicky told the assembly how people had spoken to her in the shadows to void the marriage as she would not bear children. Her patience and prayers have paid off, thanks to The Anointing Water.\n\nThe family of Folunrosho Olugbenga also came out to give their testimony concerning The Anointing Water. For many years, the couple were barren ‘til they collected and applied The Anointing Water. After that, the wife urinated continually because of the diagnosed fibroid. Soon after the fibroid was wiped out, the wife became pregnant and by God’s grace, they hope to be parents soon.\n\nMrs Ann Nwaobi was the next to give her testimony. In her words, she had been married for four years but had had no child because of fibroid. When she got The Anointing Water and applied it as directed, she experienced an unusual flow of the menstrual blood that very month. When she went for test after the menstrual flow, the fibroid had disappeared. She thanked God for the miracle she got through The Anointing Water.\n\nMiss Powerfree Andrew from Cameroon also came to testify to the power of The Anointing Water. She, once a brilliant student, began to wane in academic performance. In one of her examinations, she passed only two courses out of the twelve that she wrote. It was certainly a big issue that needed attention. So, she came to The SCOAN to collect The Anointing Water to remedy the situation. As soon as she applied The Anointing Water as instructed, she noticed a positive change in her memory power. Consequent on her improved academic performance, she got admission in London School of Commerce and also a scholarship thus reaping prosperity from the Prosperity Anointing Water she collected in April.\n\nIn course of t he second servi ce, the prophet, in a vision, saw a man who hid a gun in the Church premises. He called the young man out and he led the prophet to where he had hidden the gun. The prophet recovered the gun and asked the Church to watch out for the man and his mission in the following Sunday’s service adding that the recovered gun would be handed over to the police.\n\nThe service ended on a happy note as all participants were assured of total deliverance from the hands of satan and its agents.\n\nAnother Sunday Service at The Synagogue, Church of All Nations and all we have to say is ‘Thank You Jesus’! From touching family reconciliations, shocking satanic confessions to remarkable healing testimonies, it was yet another action-packed riveting service that proved beyond all doubt that Jesus is alive and His power is still at work today. Full of practical lessons for life, faith-building experiences, words of wisdom and the raw, real power of God, both the thousands of congregants at The SCOAN and the multitudes of viewers on Emmanuel TV would agree unanimously after these extraordinary events that Jesus is truly the same yesterday, today and forever!\n\nIn an enlightening message titled ‘The Name Of Jesus Has Power’ drawn from the scripture in Mark 9 detailing the account of the father of the demon possessed boy and his encounter with Jesus, Prophet T.B. Joshua explained, “There is power in the Name of Jesus indeed, but only among those who are committed to the glory of God.” He spoke of the need to have absolute trust in God, stating that some measure of trust would only enable us to do some, not all. “When we express the necessary trust in Christ Jesus, His duty, I mean, His work is to raise us from death to life and then restore the wholeness and fellowship,” he admonished. Speaking on the purpose of God’s power and its incredible effects on a person’s life, TB Joshua said, “One of the reasons God gives us His power is to confirm that what we are speaking is from Him… Once the supernatural power of God comes upon you, then something is going to happen to you that cannot be explained by the human mind.” It was a powerful message backed up by the prophet’s own extensive experience in the ministry. “When you see a good doctor, he should be able to explain himself when he gets to the laboratory,” he noted.\n\nAfter hearing God’s Word, it was time to move on to a more practical aspect – the ministry of reconciliation. In lieu of the recent confessions of families whose homes have been torn apart due to varying allegations and different situations, yet another touching case was brought to the light. It was that of Mrs Better Keke who had come to The SCOAN with a whole horde of villagers who had been sent to ascertain the truth from God. Before listening to their story, TB Joshua reminded the people of the need not to judge those they were about to hear from but rather learn from them. “Our response to someone who makes a mistake can also be a mistake,” he emphasised.\n\nIt all began, Mrs Keke explained, after the tragic death of a young man in a car accident. “At his funeral, a voice suddenly spoke to me telling me to confess I was the one who killed him,” Keke said. As the strange voice continued to speak to Better over the coming days telling her to confess what she did not do, her musical leader Evan. Elvis Osita confronted her that she had a confession to make, a revelation he said he came to after 30 days of fasting and prayer. As the voice grew within grew stronger, subsequent events led Mrs Keke to publically confess in a church that she was a witch and responsible for countless atrocities in the village, including the accident that killed the young man. In the same vein, she also accused one of her close friends, a teacher by profession, of witchcraft, an event that led to parents pulling children out of her school. In a whirlwind of events, others accused Evan. Elvis of masterminding the boy’s death and being a wizard. The situation had grown so serious that the king of their village in Delta decided to hear God’s opinion and find out who-is-who. Thus the large party had set out to The SCOAN to hear from Prophet TB Joshua the voice of God which would put a rest to the endless rumours and counter-accusations.\n\n“When you look at your family, you have the traces of mental disorder,” the prophet said. Mrs Keke confirmed that one of her aunties was afflicted with a severe mental problem. “The spirit speaking to her is not that of witches or wizards – it is a brain problem. She’s not a witch,” T.B. Joshua declared. “If you ask her, she will tell you she has a chronic headache, and sometimes her eyes will be bringing water,” he prophesied. She confirmed it to be a reality. T.B. Joshua then prayed for her in the power of the Holy Spirit, commanding the spirit of mental disorder to leave. The truth had finally been revealed. As for Evan. Osita, the prophet said he has no trace of evil in him and was innocent of the accusation, but warned him about jumping to conclusions based on feelings and packaging them as spiritual revelations. The teacher who had further been accused, Mrs Gloria Uduarighe, was also vindicated by the man of God, who further assured her that the children would return to her school now the truth had been revealed. “My people of Delta, what they are saying against this lady are pure lies,” he announced. Hon. Alex Izogo, one of the representatives sent by the king, capped off the experience with a final word. “This thing has torn our community apart. But what you have said now is the final solution to this problem.”\n\nMore cases of broken homes and subsequent reconciliation followed, including that of Jubili Umerere whose two children had confessed responsibility for the calamities that had befallen their entire family. Her husband had gone to the extent of purchasing acid with the intent of killing the children said to have rendered them homeless and jobless, before they came to The SCOAN. The issue had severely affected the extended family, with the kids also confessing responsibility for the barrenness of Mrs Umerere’s sister Blessing Obarhua. After listening to their experiences, T.B. Joshua revealed that the children were not witches, but their images were simply being used by evil forces. He concluded in prophesying that Mrs Blessing would give birth to a baby girl, and the fortunes of the family were bright.\n\nFollowing reconciliation came a time of prayer for deliverance. “There are th"
