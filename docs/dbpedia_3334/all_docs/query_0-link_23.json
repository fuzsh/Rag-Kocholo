        "text": "Prophet T.B. Joshua continues to fly the flag for Nigeria abroad, having been selected to choose three young leaders who will represent the nation at an internationally renowned conference across Asia and Europe.\n\nAccording to a post on Joshua’s official Facebook Page, Humanitarian Affairs, “an international NGO that aims to empower young people who are passionate about social change to make a real impact in the world”, selected the pastor for his dedication in developing ‘leaders of tomorrow’.\n\nJoshua has been designated to “select three Youth Leaders between 18-35 years old to represent Nigeria in the 7th University Scholars Leadership Symposium (USLS),” to be held in August 2016 in Hanoi, Vietnam, who “will share the secrets behind his extensive humanitarian efforts around the world”.\n\nT.B. Joshua is well known for his charitable work over the decades, especially the provision of scholarships to students such as Mary Jean Nleya who was sponsored to Harvard University, Yinka Oduwole to the University of Oxford and thousands more to academic institutions worldwide.\n\nHumanitarian Affairs, a member of the United Nations Global Compact, will bring together over 1,000 leaders and world leading experts from more than 60 countries at the USLS.\n\n“Ultimately, the Organisation envisions building an international network of inspired, empowered and proactive young leaders who will be influential change-makers and decision-makers of the future,” their website states.\n\nOne of the keynote speakers at the event, Mr Haoliang Xu, Assistant Secretary General, United Nations, said, “I think Humanitarian Affairs has created such a wonderful platform for you to gather together to discuss leadership, to discuss your own actions and to deal with humanitarian and development challenges that the world faces.”\n\nJoshua has spearheaded numerous global humanitarian projects including relief in disaster-hit countries such as Haiti and Philippines, alongside support for the physically challenged, widows, little people, orphans and elderly.\n\nAdditionally, he founded a football club for the less-privileged called My People FC, which discovered the likes of SS Lazio and Nigerian midfielder Ogenyi Onazi and FIFA U-17 World Cup MVP Sani Emmanuel.\n\nHe was also ranked among the most famous prophets in history by American website ranker.com, given the highest ranking by Google for institutions within Nigeria and awarded the ‘Yoruba Man of the Decade’.\n\nJoshua’s television station Emmanuel TV recently surpassed 300,000 subscribers on YouTube, making it one of the most subscribed Christian channels worldwide."
