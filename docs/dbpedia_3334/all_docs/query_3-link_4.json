This systematic review aims to establish clear indications and compare outcomes versus standard-of-care chemotherapy. We conducted an electronic literature search across three databases and identified 2033 articles, including three phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCT). The review adhered to PRISMA 2020 guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO (no. CRD42022379817). Despite varying patient selection methods, surgery plus chemotherapy demonstrated significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy alone. However, overall survival outcomes were inconsistent: while GOG-0213 did not show extended overall survival, recent studies with stricter defined criteria for surgery (SOC-1 and DESKTOP-III) reported improved overall survival with the addition of surgery. Morbidity and mortality rates were low, with no difference in quality of life between the surgery and no-surgery groups. In conclusion, cytoreductive surgery presents a promising option for recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer treatment. Nonetheless, well-defined selection criteria appear crucial for achieving increased overall survival compared to conventional treatment.

Currently, GP 2250 is under phase I clinical trial in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). GP-2250 in combination with Gemcitabine displays a high synergistic capacity in various primary and established pancreatic cancer cell lines. Additionally, in the eight PDX models tested, the drug combination was superior in reducing tumor volume with an aggregate tumor regression (ATR) of 74% compared to Gemcitabine alone (ATR: 10%). Similarly, in a PDX maintenance setting following two weeks of treatment with nab-Paclitaxel plus Gemcitabine, the combination of GP-2250 plus Gemcitabine resulted in outstanding tumor control (ATR: 79%) compared to treatment with Gemcitabine alone (ATR: 60%). Furthermore, GP-2250 reduced the ratio of tumor-initiating CD133+ markers on the surface of PDAC cells in spheroid cultures, indicating a possible mechanism for the synergistic effect of both substances. Considering the high tolerability of GP 2250, these results may open up a new approach to maintenance therapy with GP-2250/Gemcitabine combination following nab-Paclitaxel plus Gemcitabine as first-line treatment.

However, it has been associated with an increased frequency of neurocognitive adverse events (NAEs). Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the NAEs related to lorlatinib therapy in NSCLC patients. PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and prominent conference proceedings were searched for eligible studies of lorlatinib in NSCLC patients. NAEs included cognitive, mood, speech, and psychotic effects. A total of 1147 patients from 12 studies were included; 62% had brain metastases. A pooled analysis of NAEs showed frequencies of cognitive effects of 14.57% (95% CI, 8.37 to 24.14, I2 = 84%), mood effects of 11.17% (95% CI, 5.93 to 20.07, I2 = 84%), speech effects of 7.24% (95% CI, 3.39 to 15.20, I2 = 72%), and psychotic effects of 4.97% (95% CI, 3.27 to 7.49, I2 = 21%). Clinical trials reported a significantly higher frequency of mood effects than was indicated by real-world data. These results highlight the importance of educating patients and healthcare professionals about lorlatinib-related NAEs for early detection and management to improve NSCLC patients’ quality of life.

Besides advances in diagnosis and promising results of pre-clinical studies, established curative therapeutic options for HCC are not currently available. Recent progress in understanding the tumor microenvironment (TME) interactions has turned the scientific interest to immunotherapy, revolutionizing the treatment of patients with advanced HCC. However, the limited number of HCC patients who benefit from current immunotherapeutic options creates the need to explore novel targets associated with improved patient response rates and potentially establish them as a part of novel combinatorial treatment options. Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein (GITR) belongs to the TNFR superfamily (TNFRSF) and promotes CD8+ and CD4+ effector T-cell function with simultaneous inhibition of Tregs function, when activated by its ligand, GITRL. GITR is currently considered a potential immunotherapy target in various kinds of neoplasms, especially with the concomitant use of programmed cell-death protein-1 (PD-1) blockade. Regarding liver disease, a high GITR expression in liver progenitor cells has been observed, associated with impaired hepatocyte differentiation, and decreased progenitor cell-mediated liver regeneration. Considering real-world data proving its anti-tumor effect and recently published evidence in pre-clinical models proving its involvement in pre-cancerous liver disease, the idea of its inclusion in HCC therapeutic options theoretically arises. In this review, we aim to summarize the current evidence supporting targeting GITR/GITRL signaling as a potential treatment strategy for advanced HCC.

Because of the different biology of solid tumors compared to hematological tumors, response rates of CAR-T cells could not be transferred to solid entities yet. CAR engineering has added co-stimulatory domains, transgenic cytokines and switch receptors to improve performance and persistence in a hostile tumor microenvironment, but because of the inherent cell type limitations of CAR-T cells, including HLA incompatibility, toxicities (cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity) and high costs due to the logistically challenging preparation process for autologous cells, the use of alternative immune cells is gaining traction. NK cells and γδ T cells that do not need HLA compatibility or macrophages and dendritic cells with additional properties such as phagocytosis or antigen presentation are increasingly seen as cellular vehicles with potential for application. As these cells possess distinct properties, clinicians and researchers need a thorough understanding of their peculiarities and commonalities. This review will compare these different cell types and their specific modes of action seen upon CAR activation.

We retrospectively analysed PD-L1 expression in diagnostic biopsy and resection samples from RC patients treated at our centre between 2000 and 2020. PD-L1 immunostaining (22C3 clone) was evaluated according to tumour proportion (TPS), immune cell (ICS), and the combined positive score (CPS). Eighty-three patients were included. At diagnosis, PD-L1 expression ≥1%/≥5% was observed in 15.4%/0%, 80.7%/37.4%, and 69.2%/25.6% of patients based on TPS, ICS, and CPS, respectively. At surgery, the respective figures were 4.6%/1.5%, 60.2%/32.5%, and 50.7%/26.2%. Using the 1% cut-off and regardless of the scoring system, PD-L1 was less expressed in surgery than biopsy samples (p ≤ 0.04). In paired specimens, PD-L1-ICS reduction was especially observed following neoadjuvant long-course (chemo)radiotherapy (p = 0.03). PD-L1-ICS of ≥5% in surgical samples (HR: 0.17; p = 0.02), and a biopsy-to-surgery increase in PD-L1-ICS (HR: 0.19; p = 0.04) was predictive for longer disease-free survival, while the PD-L1-ICS of either ≥1% (HR 0.28; p = 0.04) or ≥5% (HR 0.19; p = 0.03) in surgical samples and the biopsy-to-surgery increase in PD-L1-ICS (HR: 0.20; p = 0.04) were associated with better overall survival. Our study suggests that PD-L1 expression in RC is largely reflective of immune cell infiltration, and its presence/increase in surgical samples predicts better outcomes.

The aim of this study was to evaluate if minimally invasive liver surgery (MILS) may result in less hepatic injury than open hepatectomy by assessing the differences of postoperative ALT levels. Methods: Patients who underwent MILS between 2009 and 2019 at our unit were included and compared with open liver resections. Median ALT levels was measured on postoperative day (POD) 1, 3 and 5. Postoperative peak transaminase (PPT) of ALT was determined on POD 1. The stabilized inverse probability treatment weighing (SIPTW) process was used to balance the two groups. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to analyze factors associated with high PPT. Results: After SIPTW, 292 MILS were compared with 159 open resections. Median ALT levels on POD 1, 3 and 5 were significantly higher in the open group than in the MILS group (301 vs. 187, p = 0.002; 180 vs. 121, p < 0.0001; 104 vs. 60, p < 0.0001; respectively).

Nevertheless, the evidence supporting this practice remains limited and weak, and in vitro studies examining the mitogenic effects of TSH in cancerous cells used supraphysiological doses of bovine TSH, which produced conflicting results. Our study explores, for the first time, the impact of human recombinant thyrotropin (rh-TSH) on human PTC cell lines (K1 and TPC-1) that were transformed to overexpress the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR). The cells were treated with escalating doses of rh-TSH under various conditions, such as the presence or absence of insulin. The expression levels of TSHR and thyroglobulin (Tg) were determined, and subsequently, the proliferation and migration of both transformed and non-transformed cells were assessed. Under the conditions employed, rh-TSH was not adequate to induce either the proliferation or the migration rate of the cells, while Tg expression was increased. Our experiments indicate that clinically relevant concentrations of rh-TSH cannot induce proliferation and migration in PTC cell lines, even after the overexpression of TSHR. Further research is warranted to dissect the underlying molecular mechanisms, and these results could translate into better management of treatment for PTC patients.

However, increased fracture risk in skeletal sites with no bone metastasis has been observed in patients treated with Ra-223. Both luciferase- or green fluorescence protein (GFP)-labeled osteoblast reporter mice were used to monitor the effect of Ra-223 on resident osteoblasts and normal bone structure. Upon Ra-223 treatment, 70% of resident osteoblasts were reduced within 2 days, and the osteoblast reduction lasted for at least 18 weeks without detectable recovery, as measured by in vivo bioluminescent imaging. In GFP-labeled osteoblast reporter mice, Ra-223 mainly reduced osteoblasts localized in the trabecular bone areas; the osteoblasts in the growth plates were less affected. Micro-computed tomography analyses showed that Ra-223 significantly reduced bone mineral density and bone microstructure in the trabecular area of femurs but not in the cortical bone. Tumor-induced bone was generated by inoculating osteogenic TRAMP-BMP4 prostate cancer cells into the mouse femurs; Ra-223 treatment significantly reduced tumor-induced osteoblasts. Our study shows that Ra-223 affects bone structures that are not involved in bone metastasis. Strategies that improve bone health may reduce fracture risk in patients receiving Ra-223.

In this retrospective study, we analyzed patients treated by SRT for a single BM during their first SRT session and we compared two subgroups: “Cohort 1” with patients did not undergo cerebral re-irradiation and “Cohort 2” with patients received at least one subsequent SRT session for cerebral recurrence. Methods: We included patients who received SRT for a single BM between January 2010 and June 2020. Cohort 1 comprised 152 patients, and Cohort 2 had 46 patients. Results: Cohort 2 exhibited younger patients with higher Karnofsky performance status (KPS). Median overall survival was considerably longer in Cohort 2 (21.8 months) compared to Cohort 1 (6.1 months). Local and cerebral recurrence rates were significantly higher in Cohort 2 (p < 0.001), attributed to patient selection and longer survival. The combined score of age and KPS proved to be a predictive factor for survival, with patients under 65 years of age and KPS > 80 showing the best survival rates in the overall population. Conclusion: This retrospective study highlights that the combined score of age and KPS can predict better survival, especially for patients under 65 years with a KPS score above 80. Further research involving larger and more diverse populations is essential to validate and expand upon these findings.

The aim of the study is to investigate whether being diagnosed with HBOC syndrome is itself a risk factor for sexual dysfunction. Methods: An ad hoc questionnaire, including baseline demographic and clinical data, and the Sexual Function Questionnaire 28 (SFQ28) were administered to HBOC female carriers (study group) and to a control group. Results: After propensity score matching (1:1), we enrolled 202 women, 101 in the study group and 101 in the control group. In a multivariate analysis, we finally found that menopausal status was the only risk factor for a significant low score in the domains Desire (HR 0.66; CI95% 0.47–0.93; p = 0.017), Arousal (Lubrication) (HR 0.52; CI95% 0.34–0.80; p = 0.003), Arousal (Cognitive) (HR 0.64; CI95% 0.44–0.95; p = 0.027), and Orgasm (HR 0.33; CI95% (0.16–0.70; p = 0.004), independent of risk-reducing surgery for gynecological malignancy. Psycho-oncology support is a protective factor for the Enjoyment domain (HR 1.38; CI95% 1.05–1.81; p = 0.022). Conclusions: HBOC syndrome itself does not affect SFQ28 domains, while menopausal status significantly influences sexual health, with potential mitigating effects of psycho-oncological support.

These IFs present diagnostic and management challenges, potentially causing unnecessary anxiety and further invasive diagnostic procedures for patients. This review article provides an overview of IFs encountered in LDCT, emphasizing their clinical significance and recommended management strategies. We categorize IFs based on their anatomical locations (intrathoracic–intrapulmonary, intrathoracic–extrapulmonary, and extrathoracic) and discuss the most common findings. We highlight the importance of utilizing guidelines and standardized reporting systems by the American College of Radiology (ACR) to guide appropriate follow-ups. For each category, we present specific IF examples, their radiologic features, and the suggested management approach. This review aims to provide radiologists and clinicians with a comprehensive understanding of IFs in LCS for accurate assessment and management, ultimately enhancing patient care. Finally, we outline a few key aspects for future research and development in managing IFs.

In rare cases, other tumors or non-tumorous lesions can mimic peripheral nerve tumors clinically or radiologically. Based on data from the multicentric German Peripheral Nerve Tumor Registry (PNTR), which encompasses current information on 315 surgically treated patients from three high-volume centers, we present 61 cases of rare tumors and lesions that mimic tumors associated with peripheral nerves. This cohort displays considerable heterogeneity, featuring a broad spectrum of morphological features and biological potentials. Histopathological diagnoses include various intrinsic peripheral nerve tumors such as malignant peripheral nerve tumors (MPNSTs) (n = 13), perineurioma (n = 17), and hybrid nerve sheath tumors (HPNSTs, comprising schwannoma/perineurioma and schwannoma/neurofibroma) (n = 14), as well as atypical neurofibromatous neoplasm with unknown biological potential (ANNUBP) (n = 1). Additionally, the cohort encompasses extrinsic tumorous lesions like lymphoma (n = 3), lymphangioma (n = 2), hemangioma (n = 2), solitary fibrous tumor (n = 2), metastatic disease (n = 1), and single cases of other rare tumor entities (n = 6). An overview of the underlying pathology, imaging features, and clinical presentation is provided, with a brief description of each entity. A definitive preoperative differentiation between benign peripheral nerve tumors and rare intrinsic and extrinsic tumors is often not possible. Clinical examination and subtle imaging clues can at least indicate the possibility of a rare entity. The basic requirement is close cooperation between radiologists, neurologists, neuropathologists, and neurosurgeons at a specialized center to develop a multidisciplinary concept and offer the patient the best therapeutic approaches.

Most of the published articles were small multicenter series or phase 2 studies. To our knowledge, a systematic review that comprehensively outlines the range of treatment options available for patients with metastatic RCC who do not respond to first-line ICIs has not yet been conducted. Our aim was to synthesize evidence on second-line therapies for patients with metastatic RCC after initial treatment with ICIs and to offer recommendations on the best treatment regimens based on the current literature. Material and Methods: We conducted a search in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library on 29 February 2024, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We selected articles that met the predetermined inclusion criteria (written in English, retrospective observational studies, prospective series, and randomized trials reporting second-line therapy for metastatic RCC after failure of ICI-based therapy). Relevant articles were identified in the reference lists. The main endpoint was the overall response rate (ORR), with the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as secondary endpoints. Results: We included 27 studies reporting the outcomes of 1970 patients. Salvage therapies were classified as targeted therapy (VEGFR TKIs) in 18 studies and ICIs in 8 studies. In studies where TKIs were the second line of choice, the pooled ORR was 34% (95% CI: 30.2–38%). In studies where ICIs, alone or in combination with TKIs, were used as second-line therapies, the ORR was 25.7% (95% CI: 15.7–39.2%). In studies where TKIs and ICIs were the second-line choices, the pooled median PFS values were 11.4 months (95% CI: 9.5–13.6 months) and 9.8 months (95% CI: 7.5–12.7 months), respectively. Conclusions: This systematic review shows that VEGFR TKIs and ICIs are effective second-line therapies following an initial treatment with anti-PD(L)1 alone or in combination. The treatment choice should be personalized, taking into account the patient’s response to first-line ICIs, the site of the disease, the type of first-line combination (with or without VEGFR TKIs), and the patient’s overall condition.

Prior research shows clinician-reported chemotoxicity (i.e., grading scales or diagnostic codes) predicts rehospitalization and cancer survival. However, a comprehensive synthesis of clinician-reported chemotoxicity is still lacking. Objectives: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine chemotoxicity’s prevalence and risk factors in CRC. Methods: A systematic search from 2009 to 2024 yielded 30 studies for review, with 25 included in the meta-analysis. Results: Pooled prevalences of overall, non-hematological, and hematological moderate-to-severe toxicities were 45.7%, 39.2%, and 25.3%, respectively. The most common clinician-reported chemotoxicities were gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (22.9%) and neuropathy or neutropenia (17.9%). Significant risk factors at baseline were malnutritional status, frailty, impaired immune or hepato-renal functions, short telomere lengths, low gut lactobacillus levels, age, female sex, aggressive chemotherapy, and low QOL. Age was associated with neutropenia (β: −1.44) and GI toxicity (β:1.85) (p-values < 0.01). Older adults (>65 y.o.) had higher prevalences of overall (OR: 1.14) and GI (OR: 1.65) toxicities, but a lower prevalence of neutropenia (OR: 0.65) than younger adults (p-values < 0.05). Conclusions. Our findings highlight the importance of closely monitoring and managing chemotoxicity in CRC patients receiving chemotherapy.

Various attempts have been made to classify ICC subtypes with varying prognoses, but a consensus has yet to be reached. This systematic review aims to gather relevant data on the multi-omics-based ICC classification. The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for terms related to ICC and multi-omics analysis. Studies that identified multi-omics-derived ICC subtypes and investigated clinicopathological predictors of long-term outcomes were included. Nine studies, which included 910 patients, were considered eligible. Mean 3- and 5-year overall survival were 25.7% and 19.6%, respectively, for the multi-omics subtypes related to poor prognosis, while they were 70.2% and 63.3%, respectively, for the subtypes linked to a better prognosis. Several negative prognostic factors were identified, such as genes’ expression profile promoting inflammation, mutations in the KRAS gene, advanced tumor stage, and elevated levels of oncological markers. The subtype with worse clinicopathological characteristics was associated with worse survival (Ref.: good prognosis subtype; pooled hazard ratio 2.06, 95%CI 1.67–2.53). Several attempts have been made to classify molecular ICC subtypes, but they have yielded heterogeneous results and need a clear clinical definition. More efforts are required to build a comprehensive classification system that includes both molecular and clinical characteristics before implementation in clinical practice to facilitate decision-making and select patients who may benefit the most from comprehensive molecular profiling in the disease’s earlier stages.

Herein, we explored the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) secretome as a mediator of resistance to KRAS silencing. CRC cell lines HCT15, HCT116, and SW480 were cultured either in recommended media or in conditioned media from a normal colon fibroblast cell line (CCD-18Co) activated with rhTGF-β1 to induce a CAF-like phenotype. The expression of membrane stem cell markers was analyzed by flow cytometry. Stem cell potential was evaluated by a sphere formation assay. RNAseq was performed in KRAS-silenced HCT116 colonospheres treated with either control media or conditioned media from CAFs. Our results demonstrated that KRAS-silencing up-regulated CD24 and down-regulated CD49f and CD104 in the three cell lines, leading to a reduction in sphere-forming efficiency. However, CAF-secreted factors restored stem cell marker expression and increased stemness. RNA sequencing showed that CAF-secreted factors up-regulated genes associated with pro-tumorigenic pathways in KRAS-silenced cells, including KRAS, TGFβ, NOTCH, WNT, MYC, cell cycle progression and exit from quiescence, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and immune regulation. Overall, our results suggest that resistance to KRAS-targeted inhibition might derive not only from cell-intrinsic causes but also from external elements, such as fibroblast-secreted factors.

However, prostate cancers frequently relapse, and the underlying resistance mechanism remains incompletely understood. This study seeks to investigate whether long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to the resistance against the latest antiandrogen drug, darolutamide. Our RNA sequencing analysis revealed significant overexpression of LOC730101 in darolutamide-resistant cancer cells compared to the parental cells. Elevated LOC730101 levels were also observed in clinical samples of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) compared to primary prostate cancer samples. Silencing LOC730101 with siRNA significantly impaired the growth of darolutamide-resistant cells. Additional RNA sequencing analysis identified a set of genes regulated by LOC730101, including key players in the cell cycle regulatory pathway. We further demonstrated that LOC730101 promotes darolutamide resistance by competitively inhibiting microRNA miR-1-3p. Moreover, by Hi-C sequencing, we found that LOC730101 is located in a topologically associating domain (TAD) that undergoes specific gene induction in darolutamide-resistant cells. Collectively, our study demonstrates the crucial role of the lncRNA LOC730101 in darolutamide resistance and its potential as a target for overcoming antiandrogen resistance in CRPC.

Methods: An exploratory analysis was conducted to investigate the association between the response to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) combined with stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) and the potency of circulating T cells to be activated. Blood-derived lymphocytes from 14 patients were stimulated ex vivo with, among others, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) and compared to healthy controls (HCs). Patients were grouped into responders (>median progression free survival (PFS)) and non-responders (<median PFS). The expression of the T cell activation marker CD69 and intracellular cytokines (IL-2, IFNγ, TNFα) in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in response to stimulation was measured using flow cytometry. In addition, serum levels of BAFF, IFNγ, and IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) were measured by Luminex. Results: At baseline, a higher percentage of activated CD8+ T cells (15.8% vs. 3.5% (p = <0.01)) and IL-2+CD69+CD8+ T cells (8.8% vs. 2.9% (p = 0.02)) was observed in responders compared to non-responders upon ex vivo stimulation with SEB. The concurrently measured serum cytokine levels were not different between responders and non-responders. Conclusion: Baseline blood CD8+ T cell activation potency, measured by intracellular cytokine production after ex vivo stimulation, is a potential biomarker to discriminate responders from non-responders to SBRT combined with ICI.

This study aimed to establish an orthotopic mouse model for CCA and monitor tumor growth using PET/MR imaging. Murine CCA cells were implanted into the liver lobe of male C57BL/6J mice. The imaging groups included contrast-enhanced (CE) MR, CE-MR with static [18F]FDG-PET, and dynamic [18F]FDG-PET. Tumor volume and FDG uptake were measured weekly over four weeks. Early tumor formation was visible in CE-MR images, with a gradual increase in volume over time. Dynamic FDG-PET revealed an increase in the metabolic glucose rate (MRGlu) over time. Blood analysis showed pathological changes in liver-related parameters. Lung metastases were observed in nearly all animals after four weeks. The study concludes that PET-MR imaging effectively monitors tumor progression in the CCA mouse model, providing insights into CCA development and potential treatment strategies.

Bevacizumab and its biosimilars are currently marketed in over 130 countries. Given the wide usage of Bevacizumab in current oncological practice, it is very important to compare the “real-world” results to those obtained in controlled clinical trials. This study aims to describe the clinical experience of using Bevacizumab in a large cohort of cancer patients in “non-controlled real-world” conditions with regard to effectiveness, safety, and cost of therapy. Methods: For this purpose, we conducted an open, observational, retrospective study involving all patients treated for solid malignant tumors in the Bucharest Institute of Oncology with “Prof. Dr. Al. Trestioreanu” with Bevacizumab-based systemic therapy, between 2017 and 2021. Results: The study consisted of 657 treatment episodes in 625 patients (F/B = 1.62/1, with a median age of 57.6 years) which were treated for malignant tumors (majority colorectal, non-small cell lung, ovarian, and breast cancer). First-line treatment was administered in 229 patients, and the rest received Bevacizumab as second or subsequent lines of treatment. The overall response rate to Bevacizumab-based therapies was around 60–65% across all indication except for subsequent treatment lines in colorectal and ovarian cancers, where lower values were recorded (27.1%, and 31.5% respectively). Median PFS for the entire cohort was 8.2 months (95% CI 6.8–9.6), and the median OS was 13.2 months (95% CI 11.5–14.9). Usual bevacizumab-related toxicities were observed, including bleeding, hypertension, wound-healing complications, gastrointestinal perforation, other types of fistulas, septic complications, and thromboembolic events. Although the clinical benefits are undeniable, the addition of Bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy increased the overall treatment cost by 213%. Conclusions: Bevacizumab remains a high-cost therapy, but it can add to clinical benefits (like overall survival, progression-free survival, and response rate) when used in conjunction with standard chemotherapy. Similar results as those presented in various controlled trials are observable even on unselected cohorts of patients in the uncontrolled conditions of “real-world” oncological practice. Off-label usage is encountered in clinical practice, and this aspect should be monitored given the potential adverse effects of the therapy.

However, outcomes with chemotherapy are dismal, and the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disease is an unmet need in this setting. Methods: Patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC who were candidates to receive osimertinib in the metastatic setting at our Center from 2015 to 2022 were retrospectively evaluated to identify patients who received standard platinum-based chemotherapy post-osimertinib. Data were collected on treatment outcomes, with a focus on brain metastases and progression patterns. Results: A total of 220 patients received indication for osimertinib in the study period; n = 176 had adequate follow-up data. Overall, n = 117 patients experienced disease progression on osimertinib. The median time to osimertinib progressive disease (PD) was 15 months (95% confidence interval CI 13–18). Of them, 51 patients (45%) had no access to further treatments. Of the remaining patients, n = 8 received experimental treatments, and n = 55 received standard platinum-based chemotherapy and were considered for this study. Median duration of chemotherapy was 3 months (95% CI 2–5); the best responses among 53 evaluable patients were observed as follows: 15% partial response/complete response (PR/CR), 40% stable disease (SD), 45% PD. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3 (95% CI 2–5) and 10 (95% CI 6–15) months, respectively. All patients had baseline and follow-up brain radiologic assessments, and n = 23 had brain metastases at the start of chemotherapy. With a median follow-up of 13 months, intracranial PD occurred in 47% patients, being the first site of PD in 59% of cases. The median time for intracranial (IC) PD was 2 months (95% CI 2–7). IC PD occurred as oligometastatic in 29%, whereas in 71% of cases, it was associated with systemic PD. Conclusions: Access to subsequent treatments and CNS progression are confirmed unmet needs in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients. Clinical and CNS-specific outcomes in patients receiving standard chemotherapy after the failure of osimertinib are dismal. Novel upfront treatment options with demonstrated prolonged PFS and better CNS outcomes may help address this important issue.

When an insufficient number of hematopoietic stem cells have been stored from the initial harvest, remobilization is necessary. Here, we aimed to analyze the efficacy and safety of different doses of cytarabine (total 800 vs. 1600 vs. 2400 mg/m2) for remobilization. Sixty-five patients, 55% male, with a median age at remobilization 63 years, were included. Remobilization was performed with cytarabine_800 in 7, cytarabine_1600 in 36, and cytarabine_2400 in 22 patients. Plerixafor rescue was used in 25% of patients receiving cytarabine_1600 and 27% of those receiving cytarabine_2400. Patients administered cytarabine_800 were not rescued with plerixafor. Remobilization was successful in 80% of patients (57% cytarabine_800; 86% cytarabine_1600; 77% cytarabine_2400; p = 0.199). The yield of collected CD34+ cells did not differ between the different cytarabine doses (p = 0.495). Patients receiving cytarabine_2400 were at the highest risk of developing severe cytopenias, requiring blood product support, or having blood-stream infections. One patient died of septic shock after cytarabine_2400. In summary, remobilization with cytarabine is feasible in most patients. All doses of cytarabine allow for successful remobilization. Cytarabine_2400 is associated with higher toxicity; therefore, lower doses (800 or 1600 mg/m2) seem to be preferable.

In total, 319 patients were enrolled at a planned ~1:1:1 ratio across StI:II:III. Most tested biomarkers were programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1; 58% expressing), Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS; 22% positive), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; 18% positive). Of 115/98/106 StI/II/III patients, 82%/85%/36% underwent surgery, followed by systemic therapy in 9%/45%/47% of those [mostly chemotherapy (ChT)]. Unresected treated StIII patients received ChT + radiotherapy [43%; followed by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in 39% of those], ICI ± ChT (35%), and ChT-alone/radiotherapy-alone (22%). Treatment was initiated a median (interquartile range) of 24 (7–39) days after histological confirmation, and 55 (38–81) days after first medical visit. Based on exploratory analyses of all patients newly diagnosed with any stage NSCLC during 2018–2021 at 14 of the sites (N = 7846), 22%/10%/25%/43% had StI/II/III/IV. The total number was not significantly different between pre-COVID-19 (2018–2019) and study-specific COVID-19 (2020–2021) periods, while StI proportion increased (21% vs. 23%; p = 0.012). Small differences were noted in treatments. In conclusion, treatments were aligned with guideline recommendations at a time which preceded the era of ICIs and targeted therapies in the (neo)adjuvant setting.

However, these therapies are also associated with typical immune-related adverse events due to the enhanced inflammatory and immune response. These toxicities can arise at any time during treatment but are more frequent within the first few months. Any organ and tissue can be affected, ranging from mild to life-threatening. While some manifestations are common and more often mild, such as dermatitis and colitis, others are rarer and more severe, such as myocarditis. Management depends on the severity, with treatment being held for >grade 2 toxicities. Steroids are used in more severe cases, and immunosuppressive treatment may be considered for non-responsive toxicities, along with specific organ support. A multidisciplinary approach is mandatory for prompt identification and management. The diagnosis is primarily of exclusion. It often relies on imaging features, and, when possible, cytologic and/or pathological analyses are performed for confirmation. In case of clinical suspicion, imaging is required to assess the presence, extent, and features of abnormalities and to evoke and rule out differential diagnoses. This imaging-based review illustrates the diverse system-specific toxicities associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T-cells with a multidisciplinary perspective. Clinical characteristics, imaging features, cytological and histological patterns, as well as the management approach, are presented with insights into radiological tips to distinguish these toxicities from the most important differential diagnoses and mimickers—including tumor progression, pseudoprogression, inflammation, and infection—to guide imaging and clinical specialists in the pathway of diagnosing immune-related adverse events.
