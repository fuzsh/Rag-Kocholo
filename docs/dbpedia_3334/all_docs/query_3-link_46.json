        "text": "Recommendations for involving the family in developmental care of the NICU baby\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCraig, J W; Glick, C; Phillips, R; Hall, S L; Smith, J; Browne, J\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFamily involvement is a key to realize the potential for long-lasting positive effects on physical, cognitive and psychosocial development of all babies, including those in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Family-centered developmental care (FCDC) recognizes the family as vital members of the NICU health-care team. As such, families are integrated into decision-making processes and are collaborators in their baby's care. Through standardized use of FCDC principles in the NICU, a foundation is constructed to enhance the family's lifelong relationship with their child and optimize development of the baby. Recommendations are made for supporting parental roles as caregivers of their babies in the NICU, supporting NICU staff participation in FCDC and creating NICU policies that support this type of care. These recommendations are designed to meet the basic human needs of all babies, the special needs of hospitalized babies and the needs of families who are coping with the crisis of having a baby in the NICU.

F.; Pietz, Kenneth; Richardson, Peter; Draper, David; Hysong, Sylvia J.; Thomas, Eric J.; Petersen, Laura A.; Gould, Jeffrey B.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: NICUs vary in the quality of care delivered to very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. NICU performance on 1 measure of quality only modestly predicts performance on others. Composite measurement of quality of care delivery may provide a more comprehensive assessment of quality. The objective of our study was to develop a robust composite indicator of quality of NICU care provided to VLBW infants that accurately discriminates performance among NICUs. METHODS: We developed a composite indicator, Baby-MONITOR, based on 9 measures of quality chosen by a panel of experts. Measures were standardized, equally weighted, and averaged. We used the California Perinatal Quality Care Collaborative database to perform across-sectional analysis of care given to VLBW infants between 2004 and 2010. Performance on the Baby-MONITOR is not an absolute marker of quality but indicates overall performance relative to that of the other NICUs. We used sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the composite indicator, by varying assumptions and methods. RESULTS: Our sample included 9023 VLBW infants in 22 California regional NICUs. We found significant variations within and between NICUs on measured components of the Baby-MONITOR. Risk-adjusted composite scores discriminated performance among this sample of NICUs. Sensitivity analysis that included different approaches to normalization, weighting, and aggregation of individual measures showed the Baby-MONITOR to be robust (r = 0.89â0.99). CONCLUSIONS: The Baby-MONITOR may be a useful tool to comprehensively assess the quality of care delivered by NICUs.

Nurses are in a key position to support these families as they deal with the psychological, emotional, and financial impact of the NICU experience. Understanding how families perceive the NICU environment and their grief in losing the desired healthy baby provides the NICU nurse with the knowledge to engage in self-reflection on her or his interpersonal style and caregiving attitudes. Utilizing the concepts and principles of family-centered care and relationship-based practice, nurses can work together with the families to determine how to best meet the families' needs and to find the resources to support them. Families and colleagues appreciate nurses who demonstrate expertise in this approach to family-centered care. This appreciation leads to greater job satisfaction and decreased job-related stress.\n\nCommon NICU Equipment\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... care unit (NICU) > Common NICU equipment Common NICU equipment E-mail to a friend Please fill in ... understand how they can help your baby.

It examined 15,624 newborns in the WBN (13,676) and NICU (1948) screened for congenital HL using AABR. The variables analyzed in it were the screening rate, referral rate, follow-up rate, diagnostic rate and diagnostic age, prevalence rate, degrees of congenital bilateral HL. The study was approved by the hospital's institutional review board (13MMHISO23). The screening rates were 99.8% and 99.6% in the WBN and NICU groups, respectively, without significant difference. The referral rates were 0.7% and 2.8% in the WBN and NICU groups, with significant difference. Furthermore, the diagnostic follow-up rates were 76.7% and 89.1% in the WBN and NICU groups, without significant difference. The average initial diagnostic ages were 1.9 months and 3.8 months in the WBN and NICU groups, with significant difference. The prevalence of congenital bilateral hearing loss were 0.27% and 1.6% in the WBN and NICU groups, with significant difference. The screening, referral and follow-up rate in the WBN and NICU groups were equivalent to the quality indicators. For NICU group, screening and diagnostic follow up were performed later than those in WBN group; however the lower referral rate in our NICU group was successfully achieved in this study and can be applied clinically. The prevalence of congenital bilateral hearing loss was higher in the NICU group than in the WBN group.\n\nRecommendations for peer-to-peer support for NICU parents\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHall, S L; Ryan, D J; Beatty, J; Grubbs, L\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPeer-to-peer support provided by âveteran' neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) parents to those with current NICU babies is a legitimate and unique form of support that can complement or supplement, but not replace, services provided by professional NICU staff. Peer support can be delivered through hospital- or community-based programs that offer one-to-one in-person or telephone matches, or support groups that meet in-person or via the Internet. Issues in program development, volunteer training and program operation are discussed. Recommendations for offering peer support to all NICU parents as an integral component of family-centered care and comprehensive family support are presented.

Yet, few NICUs offer staff education that teaches optimal methods of communication with parents in distress. Limited staff education in how to best provide psychosocial support to families is one factor that may render those who work in the NICU at risk for burnout, compassion fatigue and secondary traumatic stress syndrome. Staff who develop burnout may have further reduced ability to provide effective support to parents and babies. Recommendations for providing NICU staff with education and support are discussed. The goal is to deliver care that exemplifies the belief that providing psychosocial care and support to the family is equal in importance to providing medical care and developmental support to the baby.

NICU mental health professionals (NMHPs) should interact with all NICU parents in providing emotional support, screening, education, psychotherapy and teleservices for families. NMHPs should also offer educational and emotional support for the NICU health-care staff. NMHPs should function at all levels of layered care delivered to NICU parents. Methods of screening for emotional distress are described, as well as evidence for the benefits of peer-to-peer support and psychotherapy delivered in the NICU. In the ideal NICU, care for the emotional and educational needs of NICU parents are outcomes equal in importance to the health and development of their babies. Whenever possible, NMHPs should be involved with parents from the antepartum period through after discharge.

Stress levels were assessed using Parental Stressor Scale: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (PSS: NICU) questionnaire among 100 NICU mothers by doctors between 6 and 8Â d of admission. Maternal stress was quantified using Likert scale as low (1-2.9), medium (3-3.9) and high (4-5). The data was analyzed using SPSS Ver.16. The mean scores for the subscales sights and sounds, looks and behaviour and alteration in the parental role were 2.55, 4.1 and 4.12 respectively. Increased maternal age, prematurity of baby, longer NICU stay and inability to directly breastfeed the baby were associated with higher stress levels. NICU mothers are under significant stress and appropriate counseling targeted towards specific stressors is required.\n\nExperience with Kangaroo mother care in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Chandigarh, India.\n\nPubMed\n\nParmar, Veena Rani; Kumar, Ajay; Kaur, Rupinder; Parmar, Siddharth; Kaur, D; Basu, Srikant; Jain, Suksham; Narula, Sunny\n\n2009-01-01\n\nTo study the feasibility and acceptability of Kangaroo mother care (KMC) on the low birth weight infants (LBWI) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) by the mothers, family members and health care workers (HCW) and to observe its effect on the vital parameters of the babies. A observation in the NICU. A total of 135 babies (74 boys and 61 girls) who completed minimum of 4 hrs of KMC/day, were included. The mean birth weight and gestation were 1460 gm and 30 week respectively. 47% babies started KMC within first week of age. Mean duration of KMC was 7 days (3-48) days. The O(2) saturation improved by 2-3%, temperature ( degrees C) rose from 36.75 +/- 0.19 to 37.23 +/- 0.25, respiration stabilized (p<0.05 for all) and heart rate dropped by 3-5 beats. No episodes of hypothermia or apnea were observed during KMC. KMC was accepted by 96 % mothers, 82% fathers and 84% other family members. 94% HCW considered it to be safe and conservative method of care of LBWI. Benefits of KMC on the babies' behavior and on maternal confidence and lactation were reported by 57%, 94% and 80% respectively. A decline in use of heating devices in the NICU was reported by 85% and 79% said it did not increase their work load. KMC was found to be safe, effective and feasible method of care of LBWI even in the NICU settings. Positive attitudes were observed in mothers, families and HCW.\n\nSafe sleep practices and sudden infant death syndrome risk reduction: NICU and well-baby nursery graduates.\n\nPubMed\n\nFowler, Aja J; Evans, Patricia W; Etchegaray, Jason M; Ottenbacher, Allison; Arnold, Cody\n\n2013-11-01\n\nOur primary objective was to compare parents of infants cared for in newborn intensive care units (NICUs) and infants cared for in well-baby (\"general\") nurseries with regard to knowledge and practice of safe sleep practices/sudden infant death syndrome risk reduction measures and guidelines. Our secondary objective was to obtain qualitative data regarding reasons for noncompliance in both populations. Sixty participants (30 from each population) completed our survey measuring safe sleep knowledge and practice. Parents of NICU infants reported using 2 safe sleep practices-(a) always placing baby in crib to sleep and (b) always placing baby on back to sleep-significantly more frequently than parents of well infants. Additional findings and implications for future studies are discussed.\n\nPerformance of two hearing screening protocols in NICU in Shanghai.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Zheng-Min; Cheng, Wen-Xia; Yang, Xiao-Lin\n\n2011-10-01\n\nTo study the sensitivity and specificity of targeted neonatal hearing screening for the single-session distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) technique and the combined DPOAE/automated auditory brain-stem response (AABR) technique. 3000 high-risk newborns were studied at Children's Hospital of Fudan University. They were required to take two different screening procedures separately. The first procedure consisted of DPOAE alone and the second consisted of DPOAE combined with the AABR. Based upon the etiology in high-risk babies, they were divided into four groups. In group I there were 670 very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) newborns (1340 ears), and in group II there were 890 preterm babies (1780 ears). 850 babies (1700 ears) suffered from hyperbilirubinemia in group III, whereas 790 babies (1580 ears) with asphyxia were in group IV. The babies in groups II, III, and IV came from the neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU) of our hospital. The study protocols consisted of the DPOAE alone and DPOAE combined with AABR hearing screening at an age of less than 1 month, and a diagnostic stage at the age of 2 months. With single-session DPOAE screening, the referral rate (8% of the NICU babies), the false-positive rate (4.96%) and the false-negative rate (0.8%) were higher. The different etiologies in NICU babies had significantly different referral rates (F-test, p<0.01). A 4.46% referral rate of hyperbilirubinemi babies was much lower. The combined DPOAE/AABR screening technique revealed a referral rate of 5.03%, a false-positive rate of 2% and a false-negative rate of 0.06%. The false-positive rate was well below the suggested 3% of the American Academy of Pediatric. Comparisons of the referral rate, false-positive rate and false-negative rate of two hearing screening protocols (DPOAE alone and combined DPOAE/AABR) revealed significant differences (t-test, p<0.05, p<0.01, p<0.01). 91 infants (3.03% of the NICU babies) who failed the combined DPOAE/AABR screening were\n\nFamily Perspectives on Prematurity\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nZero to Three (J), 2003\n\n2003-01-01\n\nIn this article, seven families describe their experiences giving birth to and raising a premature baby.

Qualitative, descriptive design. Two university-affiliated level-III NICUs in Canada. A purposive sample of 10 medical and nursing managers, nurse educators, lactation consultants, and neonatal nurse practitioners. In-depth, semistructured interviews transcribed and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Participants valued breastfeeding and family-centered care yet identified numerous contextual barriers to Baby-Friendly care including infant health status, parent/infant separation, staff workloads and work patterns, gaps in staff knowledge and skills, and lack of continuity of breastfeeding support. Facilitators included breastfeeding education, breastfeeding champions, and interprofessional collaboration. Despite identifying numerous barriers, participants recognized the potential value of expanding the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) to the NICU setting. Recommendations include promoting BFHI as a facilitator of family-centered care, interdisciplinary staff education, increasing access to lactation consultants, and establishing a group of NICU champions dedicated to BFHI implementation.

Smoking practices were examined in families with a high respiratory risk infant (born at very low birth weight; ventilated > 12 hr) in a Houston, Texas, NICU. Socioeconomic status, race, and mental health status were hypothesized to be related to SHSe and household smoking bans. Data were collected as part of The Baby's Breath Project, a hospital-based SHSe intervention trial targeting parents with a high-risk infant in the NICU who reported a smoker in the household (N = 99). Measures of sociodemographics, smoking, home and car smoking bans, and depression were collected. Overall, 26% of all families with a high-risk infant in the NICU reported a household smoker. Almost half of the families with a smoker reported an annual income of less than $25,000. 46.2% of families reported having a total smoking ban in place in both their homes and cars. Only 27.8% families earning less than $25,000 reported having a total smoking ban in place relative to almost 60% of families earning more (p < .01). African American and Caucasian families were less likely to have a smoking ban compared with Hispanics (p < .05). Mothers who reported no smoking ban were more depressed than those who had a household smoking ban (p < .02). The most disadvantaged families were least likely to have protective health behaviors in place to reduce SHSe and, consequently, are most at-risk for tobacco exposure and subsequent tobacco-related health disparities. Innovative SHSe interventions for this vulnerable population are sorely needed.\n\nThe myth of the miracle baby: how neonatal nurses interpret media accounts of babies of extreme prematurity.\n\nPubMed\n\nGreen, Janet; Darbyshire, Philip; Adams, Anne; Jackson, Debra\n\n2015-09-01\n\nImproved life sustaining technology in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) has resulted in an increased probability of survival in extremely premature babies. Miracle baby stories in the popular press are a regular occurrence and these reports are often the first source from which the general public learn about extremely premature babies. The research from which this paper is drawn sought to explore the care-giving and ethical dilemmas of neonatal nurses when caring for extremely premature babies 24 weeks gestation and less. This current paper aims to outline the views of neonatal nurses on miracle baby stories in the media. Data were collected via a questionnaire to 760 Australian neonatal nurses with 414 returned, representing a response rate of 54.4%. Narrative was collected from semi-structured interviews with 24 experienced neonatal nurses in NSW, Australia. A qualitative approach utilising thematic analysis was utilised to analyse the data. The theme the myth of the miracle baby is seen as generating myths and unrealistic expectations on the part of vulnerable families and the public. Neonatal nurses, as the primary caregivers for tiny babies and their families, viewed popular media publications with suspicion, believing published reports to be incomplete, inaccurate and biased towards the positive.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of NICU orientation program on the anxiety of mothers who had preterm newborns hospitalized in NICU. Methods: This study was a randomized clinical trial (three parallel groups). Participants included 99 mothers with preterm newborns hospitalized in NICU of Al- Zahra hospital, affiliated to Tabriz University of Medical Sciences in 2015. Mothers were randomly assigned to one of three groups (film, booklet, and control). Mothers completed the State- Trait Anxiety Inventory before entering to the NICU, and then mothers in the experiment groups became familiar with the NICU environment through watching a film or reading booklet. After the first NICU visit, all mothers completed the STAI and Cattell's Anxiety Questionnaires. Data were analyzed using SPSS ver. 13 software. Results: There was no significant difference between three groups regarding state- trait anxiety before the intervention. After the first NICU visit, a significant reduction in maternal state anxiety was seen in the both experiment groups. There was no statistical significant difference regarding trait anxiety. Data obtained from Cattell's anxiety questionnaire after intervention, showed significant difference in state anxiety between groups. Conclusion: Employing film and booklet orientation strategy after preterm delivery can reduce the motherâs anxiety and beneficent for the mother, baby, family and health care system.

An examination of such disparities in a population-based sample across multiple dimensions of care and outcomes is lacking. Prospective observational analysis of 18â616 very low birth weight infants in 134 California NICUs between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014. We assessed quality of care via the Baby-MONITOR, a composite indicator consisting of 9 process and outcome measures of quality. For each NICU, we calculated a risk-adjusted composite and individual component quality score for each race and/or ethnicity. We standardized each score to the overall population to compare quality of care between and within NICUs. We found clinically and statistically significant racial and/or ethnic variation in quality of care between NICUs as well as within NICUs. Composite quality scores ranged by 5.26 standard units (range: -2.30 to 2.96). Adjustment of Baby-MONITOR scores by race and/or ethnicity had only minimal effect on comparative assessments of NICU performance. Among subcomponents of the Baby-MONITOR, non-Hispanic white infants scored higher on measures of process compared with African Americans and Hispanics. Compared with whites, African Americans scored higher on measures of outcome; Hispanics scored lower on 7 of the 9 Baby-MONITOR subcomponents. Significant racial and/or ethnic variation in quality of care exists between and within NICUs. Providing feedback of disparity scores to NICUs could serve as an important starting point for promoting improvement and reducing disparities.

Past research has primarily focused on Caucasian women. Mexican-Americans are the fastest growing ethnic population in the U.S. with the highest fertility rate; therefore, the purpose of this grounded theory study was to gain a better understanding of the NICU experience for Mexican-American mothers. Fifteen women were recruited and data were collected through semi-structured interviews. A theoretical model, taking care of my baby, was developed. The mothers' experiences began with the unexpected event of having an infant admitted to the NICU and played out in a context that fluctuated between being supportive (making meaningful connections) or inhibitive (struggling to mother). The women developed strategies to help them take care of their babies during the NICU stay: balancing responsibilities, leaving part of me with my baby, and watching over. The process concluded in one of two ways: bringing my baby home or losing my baby. These findings offer insight for neonatal nurses who provide care for Mexican-American NICU mothers and may help inform their practice. Further research is needed with this growing population to ensure supportive nursing care and influence positive outcomes.\n\nRates of Complications After Newborn Circumcision in a Well-Baby Nursery, Special Care Nursery, and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.\n\nPubMed\n\nSrinivasan, Mythili; Hamvas, Corrine; Coplen, Douglas\n\n2015-10-01\n\nTo determine rates of complications after newborn circumcision by performing a retrospective chart review of patients circumcised at a well-baby nursery, neonatal intensive care units (NICU), and special care nursery (SCN) from 2007 to 2012. A total of 5129 babies (73%) were circumcised at the well-baby nursery and 1909 babies (27%) at the NICU and SCN. Forty-seven patients (0.67%, 95% CI 0.49% to 0.89%) had circumcision-related complications: 5 (0.07%) patients with acute and 42 (0.6%) with late complications. Babies in the NICU/SCN had increased odds of complication (OR 4.00, 95% CI 2.23 to 7.19) compared with those in well-baby nursery. There were increased odds of complications in babies with Caucasian ethnicity (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.48 to 4.89) compared with African American babies and in babies with private insurance (OR 4.0, 95% CI 2.1 to 7.5) compared with nonprivate insurance. The rates of complications after newborn circumcisions were low. Babies in the NICU/SCN had increased odds of complication.

The purpose of this initiative was to generate large-scale simultaneous improvements in multiple domains of care in a large neonatal network through a program called the \"100,000 Babies Campaign.\" Key drivers of neonatal morbidity and mortality were identified. A system for retrospective morbidity and mortality review was used to identify problem areas for project prioritization. NICU system analysis and staff surveys were used to facilitate reengineering of NICU systems in 5 key driver areas. Electronic health record-based automated data collection and reporting were used. A quality improvement infrastructure using the Kotter organizational change model was developed to support the program. From 2007 to 2013, data on 422â877 infants, including a subset with birth weight of 501 to 1500 g (n = 58â555) were analyzed. Key driver processes (human milk feeding, medication use, ventilator days, admission temperature) all improved (P < .0001). Mortality, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, bacteremia after 3 days of life, and catheter-associated infection decreased. Survival without significant morbidity (necrotizing enterocolitis, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, severe retinopathy of prematurity, oxygen use at 36 weeks' gestation) improved. Implementation of a multifaceted quality improvement program that incorporated organizational change theory and automated electronic health record-based data collection and reporting program resulted in major simultaneous improvements in key neonatal processes and outcomes.

Study Design: This prospective study documented, by means of institutional review board-approved questionnaire survey protocols, the perceptions of parents and staff from two contrasting NICU environments. Result: Findings showed that demographic subgroups of parents and staff perceived the advantages and disadvantages of the two facility designs differently. Staff perceptions varied with previous experience, acclimation time and employment position, whereas parental perceptions revealed a naivetÃ© bias through surveys of transitional parents with experience in both NICU facilities. Conclusion: Use of transitional parent surveys showed a subject naivetÃ© bias inherent in perceptions of inexperienced parents. Grouping all survey participants demographically provided more informative interpretations of data, and revealed staff perceptions to vary with position, previous training and hospital experience.

Addressing these questions would be of value to hospital staff, administrators and designers alike. Study Design: This prospective study documented, by means of Institution Review Board-approved protocols, the progress of patients in two contrasting NICU designs. Noise levels, illumination and air quality measurements were included to define the two NICU physical environments. Result: Infants in the SFR unit had fewer apneic events, reduced nosocomial sepsis and mortality, as well as earlier transitions to enteral nutrition. More mothers sustained stage III lactation, and more infants were discharged breastfeeding in the SFR. Conclusion: This study showed the SFR to be more conducive to family-centered care, and to enhance infant medical progress and breastfeeding success over that of an open ward.

High neonatal mortality is a prominent and persistent problem across the globe. Non-availability of trained staff and infrastructure are the major recognized hurdles in the quality care of these neonates. Hourly progress growth charts and reports are still maintained manually by nurses along with continuous calculation of drug dosage and nutrition as per the changing weight of the baby. iNICU (integrated Neonatology Intensive Care Unit) leverages Beaglebone and Intel Edison based IoT integration with biomedical devices in NICU i.e. monitor, ventilator and blood gas machine. iNICU is hosted on IBM Softlayer based cloud computing infrastructure and map NICU workflow in Java based responsive web application to provide translational research informatics support to the clinicians. iNICU captures real time vital parameters i.e. respiration rate, heart rate, lab data and PACS amounting for millions of data points per day per child. Stream of data is sent to Apache Kafka layer which stores the same in Apache Cassandra NoSQL. iNICU also captures clinical data like feed intake, urine output, and daily assessment of child in PostgreSQL database. It acts as first Big Data hub (of both structured and unstructured data) of neonates across India offering temporal (longitudinal) data of their stay in NICU and allow clinicians in evaluating efficacy of their interventions. iNICU leverages drools based clinical rule based engine and deep learning based big data analytical model coded in R and PMML. iNICU solution aims to improve care time, fills skill gap, enable remote monitoring of neonates in rural regions, assists in identifying the early onset of disease, and reduction in neonatal mortality.\n\nMothers' experiences expressing breast milk for their preterm infants: does NICU design make a difference?\n\nPubMed\n\nDowling, Donna A; Blatz, Mary Ann; Graham, Gregory\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThis study examined differences in outcomes of provision of mothers' milk before and after implementation of a single-family room (SFR) neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and described issues related to long-term milk expression. The sample included 40 mothers (15 in the original NICU and 25 in the SFR NICU). Descriptive comparative. Mothers were recruited 2 months before and 3 months after opening an SFR NICU. Nutritional data were collected throughout hospitalization. Mothers used a milk expression diary during hospitalization and completed a survey, \"My Experiences With Milk Expression\" immediately before infant discharge. Seventy-five percent of mothers planned to express breast milk or breastfeed before delivery. The majority of the mothers (55%) were most comfortable pumping in their own homes because of the increased privacy. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups regarding the place where they were most comfortable pumping or where they usually pumped, although more mothers pumped in their babies' rooms in the SFR NICU. The majority of the mothers reported concern about their milk supply at some time during hospitalization and 47.5% reported having breast problems. At discharge, 71.8% of the total group was providing some breast milk and 44.7% of the total group was providing breast milk exclusively. There were no significant differences between the groups in outcomes concerning the provision of breast milk. Individual mother's needs for privacy need to be determined and interventions to support mothers' feeding plans throughout hospitalization and at discharge need to be developed.\n\nRandomized controlled trial of Family Nurture Intervention in the NICU: assessments of length of stay, feasibility and safety.\n\nPubMed\n\nWelch, Martha G; Hofer, Myron A; Stark, Raymond I; Andrews, Howard F; Austin, Judy; Glickstein, Sara B; Ludwig, Robert J; Myers, Michael M\n\n2013-09-24\n\nWhile survival rates for preterm infants have increased, the risk for adverse long-term neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes remains very high. In response to the need for novel, evidence-based interventions that prevent such outcomes, we have assessed Family Nurture Intervention (FNI), a novel dual mother-infant intervention implemented while the infant is in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Here, we report the first trial results, including the primary outcome measure, length of stay in the NICU and, the feasibility and safety of its implementation in a high acuity level IV NICU. The FNI trial is a single center, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial at Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital for mothers and their singleton or twin infants of 26-34Â weeks gestation. Families were randomized to standard care (SC) or (FNI). FNI was implemented by nurture specialists trained to facilitate affective communication between mother and infant during specified calming interactions. These interactions included scent cloth exchange, sustained touch, vocal soothing and eye contact, wrapped or skin-to-skin holding, plus family-based support interactions. A total of 826 infants born between 26 and 34Â weeks during the 3.5Â year study period were admitted to the NICU. After infant and mother screening plus exclusion due to circumstances that prevented the family from participating, 373 infants were eligible for the study. Of these, we were unable to schedule a consent meeting with 56, and consent was withheld by 165. Consent was obtained for 150 infants from 115 families. The infants were block randomized to groups of Nâ=â78, FNI and Nâ=â72, SC. Sixteen (9.6%) of the randomized infants did not complete the study to home discharge, 7% of those randomized to SC and 12% of FNI infants. Mothers in the intervention group engaged in 3 to 4 facilitated one- to two-hour sessions/week. Intent to treat analyses revealed no significant difference between groups in\n\nRocking & Rolling: Supporting Infants, Toddlers, and Their Families.

This investigation was a prospective cohort study comparing satisfaction survey results for parents who responded to a commercially available parent NICU satisfaction survey following the provision of NICU care in open-bay and single-family room facilities. A subset of 16 items indicative of family-centered care was also computed and compared for these two NICU facilities. Parents whose babies received care in the single-family room facility expressed significantly improved survey responses in regard to the NICU environment, overall assessment of care, and total survey score than did parents of neonates in the open-bay facility. With the exception of the section on nursing in which scores in both facilities were high, nonsignificant improvement in median scores for the sections on delivery, physicians, discharge planning, and personal issues were noted. The total median item score for family-centered care was significantly greater in the single-family room than the open-bay facility. Parental satisfaction with care in the single-family room NICU was improved in comparison with the traditional open-bay NICU. The single-family room environment appears more conducive to the provision of family-centered care. Improved parental satisfaction with care and the potential for enhanced family-centered care need to be considered in decisions made regarding the configuration of NICU facilities in the future.\n\n[Supporting parents and newborns hospitalized in a NICU: interest of group setting].\n\nPubMed\n\nHays, M-A; Millet, C\n\n2009-07-01\n\nThis article exposes the work realized in a NICU, in a small group of parents and their hospitalized premature or ill newborns. The group has a containing function, regarding the effects of the traumatism that occurs when such babies are born. It allows sharing affects and emotions that are filtered and softened through singing. Actually, the parents themselves propose songs or lullabies. The group process is described regarding parents and babies: close infant observation is an essential part of the process.\n\nThe NICU Lighted Environment\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRea, Mark S.; Figueiro, Mariana G.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nLighting technologies are rapidly evolving, creating many opportunities for good lighting within the NICU. With the widespread adoption of advanced solid-state lighting technologies, lighting no longer needs to be static. Rather, lighting systems can be more easily adjusted to the different and changing visual and non-visual needs of the professional staff, infants and family members throughout the 24-hour day. This paper provides a conceptual framework for defining good lighting in the NICU, recognizing the needs of various constituent groups, each with very different needs from the lighting. Several other papers on the topic of lighting for various constituent groups at different times of the day in the NICU are summarized. Attention is given specifically to the Recommended Standards for Newborn ICU Design, a consensus standard developed by a wide range of experts, to help the reader translate this conceptual framework to practice.

The cross-sectional study was conducted with 340 mothers whose babies were in the NICU. Data were collected with a questionnaire, a Participation in Caregiving Observation Form, the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Problem-solving Skills Evaluation Form. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis were used in the evaluation of the data. The mothers were with their babies an average of 6.28âÂ±â2.43 (range: 1-20) times a day, participating in many basic procedures of care. A negative correlation was found between the mothers' scores on the Participation in Caregiving Observation Form and their State and Trait Anxiety Inventory scores (respectively, râ=â-0.48, pâ<â0.001 and râ=â-0.12, pâ<â0.05), but a positive correlation was observed between the Problem-solving Process (râ=â0.41, pâ<â0.001) and the Baby Care Skills (râ=â0.24, pâ<â0.001) Subscale scores. The study revealed that mothers participated in many basic caregiving procedures in the NICU and this participation resulted in reduced state and trait anxiety levels and an improvement in the mothers' problem-solving skills with respect to baby care and related problems.\n\nStaff Nurse Perceptions of Open-Pod and Single Family Room NICU Designs on Work Environment and Patient Care.\n\nPubMed\n\nWinner-Stoltz, Regina; Lengerich, Alexander; Hench, Anna Jeanine; OÊ¼Malley, Janet; Kjelland, Kimberly; Teal, Melissa\n\n2018-06-01\n\nNeonatal intensive care units have historically been constructed as open units or multiple-bed bays, but since the 1990s, the trend has been toward single family room (SFR) units. The SFR design has been found to promote family-centered care and to improve patient outcomes and safety. The impact of the SFR design NICU on staff, however, has been mixed. The purposes of this study were to compare staff nurse perceptions of their work environments in an open-pod versus an SFR NICU and to compare staff nurse perceptions of the impact of 2 NICU designs on the care they provide for patients/families. A prospective cohort study was conducted. Questionnaires were completed at 6 months premove and again at 3, 9, and 15 months postmove. A series of 1-way analyses of variance were conducted to compare each group in each of the 8 domains. Open-ended questions were evaluated using thematic analysis. The SFR design is favorable in relation to environmental quality and control of primary workspace, privacy and interruption, unit features supporting individual work, and unit features supporting teamwork; the open-pod design is preferable in relation to walking. Incorporating design features that decrease staff isolation and walking and ensuring both patient and staff safety and security are important considerations. Further study is needed on unit design at a microlevel including headwall design and human milk mixing areas, as well as on workflow processes.\n\nFussy Babies, Worried Families, and a New Service Network\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGilkerson, Linda; Gray, Larry; Mork, Nancy\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe authors document the conceptualization, over time, of \"fussy baby syndrome\" and the establishment of a Fussy Baby Clinic.

Cultures taken from 1090 babies shortly after birth showed that 65 (6%) were colonised with the streptococcus. Thirty of these babies were assigned to group 1. Bacteriological samples were taken from babies and mothers at birth and at four, eight, and 12 weeks, and also from fathers and siblings. Fifty uncolonised babies and their families were similarly studied and served as controls (group 2). In group 1,28 of the 30 mothers and 14 of the 28 fathers examined were colonised by group B streptococci. In group 2 the streptococci were isolated from three babies, 12 mothers, and 11 out of 45 fathers during follow-up. These findings suggest that group B streptococci are carried predominantly in the lower gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. Most families are lightly colonised, but in others maternal colonisation is stable and heavy and the incidence of paternal colonisation high. Results of serotyping suggest that sexual transmission occurs, which may explain the difficulty in eradicating the organism during pregnancy.

Overall, fifteen infections were identified among 11 newborns in the NICU: septicaemia (five cases), purulent conjunctivitis (three), urinary tract infection (two), meningitis (two) and cellulitis (one). Three newborns in the nursery had three infections: purulent conjunctivitis (two cases) and omphalitis (one). Thirteen of 14 babies recovered fully but one died from S. marcescens meningitis and septicaemia. All infections were traced to intrinsically contaminated baby shampoo introduced to the units five days before the first reported case. The outbreak terminated following withdrawal of the shampoo product. Copyright Â© 2011 The Healthcare Infection Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To conduct a feasibility study that aims to understand the preferences of smartphone and Internet use by parents of infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) related to information seeking and active participation in infant care, with a focus on pain management interventions. A paper-based survey was distributed to 90 parents in a tertiary-level NICU from September to November 2013. Response rate was 80% (72 of the 90). Ninety-seven percent accessed the Internet daily, 87% using their smartphone, and ranked it as an important source of NICU information (81%), more than books (56%) and brochures (33%). Participants reported a desire to have more information on how they could provide general comfort (96%), as well as greater participation in comforting their baby during painful procedures (94%). Parents in the NICU want more information and greater involvement in their infant's care and pain management and place a higher value on the Internet compared with traditional resources. Researchers and clinicians should work together to determine the quality of online resources to better support and evaluate parent use of the Internet as a health information resource. Future studies should examine parental preference regarding the optimal balance between online sources and face-to-face interactions.\n\nThe family health, functioning, social support and child maltreatment risk of families expecting a baby.\n\nPubMed\n\nLepistÃ¶, Sari; Ellonen, Noora; Helminen, Mika; Paavilainen, Eija\n\n2017-08-01\n\nTo describe the family health, functioning, social support and child maltreatment risk and associations between them in families expecting a baby. Finland was one of the first countries in banning corporal punishment against children over 30Â years ago. Despite of this, studies have shown that parents physically abuse their children. In addition, professionals struggle in intervention of this phenomenon. Abusive parents should be recognised and helped before actual violent behaviour. A follow-up case-control study, with a supportive intervention in the case group (families with a heightened risk) in maternity and child welfare clinics. The baseline results of families are described here. Child maltreatment risk in families expecting a baby was measured by Child Abuse Potential Inventory. The health and functioning was measured by Family Health, Functioning and Social Support Scale. Data included 380 families. A total of 78 families had increased risk for child maltreatment. Heightened risk was associated with partners' age, mothers' education, partners' father's mental health problems, mothers' worry about partners' drinking and mothers' difficulties in talking about the family's problems. Risk was associated with family functioning and health. Families with risk received a less support from maternity clinics. Families with child maltreatment risk and related factors were found. This knowledge can be applied for supporting families both during pregnancy and after the baby is born. Professionals working with families in maternity clinics need tools to recognise families with risk and aid a discussion with them about the family life situation. The Child Abuse Potential, as a part of evaluating the family life situation, seems to prove a useful tool in identifying families at risk. The results offer a valid and useful tool for recognising families with risk and provide knowledge about high-risk family situations.

A descriptive study was carried out using a qualitative approach and interviews were conducted at a NICU in the interior of the State of SÃ£o Paulo. Results showed new expectations on the part of parents and professionals regarding the role of NICU nurses. The knowledge identified as necessary were a family-centered approach, interpersonal relations techniques, and differentiation between technology and scientific knowledge. The conclusion is that NICU nurses need to play a more incisive role in the nursing care process, adjusting the use of technological advances to human knowledge, particularly in the area of interpersonal relationships between family members and staff, which includes activities of continuing education, such as specialization courses.\n\nDoes the architectural layout of a NICU affect alarm pressure? A comparative clinical audit of a single-family room and an open bay area NICU using a retrospective study design.\n\nPubMed\n\nJoshi, Rohan; Straaten, Henrica van; Mortel, Heidi van de; Long, Xi; Andriessen, Peter; Pul, Carola van\n\n2018-06-30\n\nTo determine differences in alarm pressure between two otherwise comparable neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) differing in architectural layout-one of a single-family room (SFR) design and the other of an open bay area (OBA) design. Retrospective audit of more than 2000 patient days from each NICU cataloguing the differences in the number and duration of alarms for critical and alerting alarms, as well as the interaction of clinicians with the patient monitor. Two level 3 NICUs. A total of more than 150â000 critical and 1.2âmillion alerting alarms were acquired from the two NICUs. The number of audible alarms and the associated noise pollution varied considerably with the OBA NICU generating 44% more alarms per infant per day even though the SFR NICU generated 2.5 as many critical desaturation alarms per infant per day. Differences in the architectural layout of NICUs and the consequent differences in delays, thresholds and distribution systems for alarms are associated with differences in alarm pressure.

Exploratory, qualitatively driven, mixed-methods design. A 50-bed U.S. academic medical center, open-bay NICU. Forty-six parents completed questionnaires, 14 of whom were also interviewed. Questionnaires, interviews, and observations with parents of newborns in the NICU were used. The qualitative investigation was based on constructivist grounded theory. Quantitative measures included ratings and free-text responses about the likelihood of speaking up in response to a hypothetical scenario about lack of clinician hand hygiene. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were integrated in the final interpretation. Most parents (75%) rated themselves likely or very likely to speak up in response to lack of hand hygiene; 25%Â of parents rated themselves unlikely to speak up in the same situation. Parents engaged in a complex process of Navigating the work of speaking up in the NICU that entailed learning the NICU, being deliberate about decisions to speak up, and at times choosing silence as a safety strategy. Decisions about how and when to speak up were influenced by multiple factors including knowing my baby, knowing the team, having a defined pathway to voice concerns, clinician approachability, clinician availability and friendliness, and clinician responsiveness. To engage parents as full partners in safety, clinicians need to recognize the complex social and personal dimensions of the NICU experience that influence parents' willingness to speak up about their safety concerns.

Maintaining intravenous access to relieve the infant's pain, communicating sensitively to the family, and creating precious, everlasting memories are goals that should be part of every dying infant's care. The nurse's ability to partner with the family in caring for the infant is integral to helping the family take the first steps in their grief journey. Evidence-based literature provides NICU nurses with the knowledge that they are the facilitators of end-of-life care for dying infants. New mothers and fathers are not aware of the caring parental tasks they can perform for their dying baby. They look to and depend on their infant's nurses to encourage them. The guideline included here provides nurses with a tool for ensuring that families have the opportunity to create memories that will not only help them with their immediate pain, but also comfort them for a lifetime.\n\nSpiritual and religious components of patient care in the neonatal intensive care unit: sacred themes in a secular setting.\n\nPubMed\n\nCatlin, E A; Guillemin, J H; Thiel, M M; Hammond, S; Wang, M L; O'Donnell, J\n\n2001-01-01\n\nWe hypothesized that spiritual distress was a common, unrecognized theme for neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) care providers. An anonymous questionnaire form assigned to a data table in a relational database was designed. Surveys were completed by 66% of NICU staff. All respondents viewed a family's spiritual and religious concerns as having a place in patient care. Eighty-three percent reported praying for babies privately. Asked what theological sense they made of suffering of NICU babies, 2% replied that children do not suffer in the NICU. Regarding psychological suffering of families, the majority felt God could prevent this, with parents differing (p = 0.039) from nonparents. There exists a strong undercurrent of spirituality and religiosity in the study NICU. These data document actual religious and spiritual attitudes and practices and support a need for pastoral resources for both families and care providers. NICU care providers approach difficulties of their work potentially within a religious and spiritual rather than a uniquely secular framework.\n\nFormative infant feeding experiences and education of NICU nurses.\n\nPubMed\n\nCricco-Lizza, Roberta\n\n2009-01-01\n\nTo explore the formative infant feeding experiences and education of NICU nurses. An ethnography was undertaken over 14 months in a level IV NICU in a free standing pediatric hospital in the Northeastern U.S. Purposeful sampling was used to select informants. General informants included 114 NICU nurses who were observed and informally interviewed an average of 3.5 times. Eighteen of these served as key informants and each was formally interviewed once with an additional average of 12 observations/informal interviews. Descriptions of feeding experiences and education were coded and analyzed for recurring patterns using NUD*IST software. The NICU nurses identified a norm for formula feeding during their formative experiences as children. The nurses described increased exposure to varied feeding methods during their adulthood, but breastfeeding was often associated with difficulties among their families and friends. The nurses in this study recounted minimal exposure to breastfeeding in nursing school. The nurses' personal experiences with breastfeeding were laden with strong emotional reactions intertwined with their feelings about motherhood. Nurses' past experiences and education must be addressed if efforts are to be made to promote breastfeeding in the NICU. Breastfeeding education programs for nurses should include reflective components to help nurses identify structural barriers and reframe any negative personal experiences.\n\nBringing baby home together: examining the impact of a couple-focused intervention on the dynamics within family play.\n\nPubMed\n\nShapiro, Alyson F; Nahm, Eun Young; Gottman, John M; Content, Kristi\n\n2011-07-01\n\nThe transition to parenthood brings with it challenges to a couple's relationship, which in turn are likely to negatively impact coparenting and overall family process. The focus of the current study was to examine the effects of the Bringing Baby Home psycho-educational intervention at the first postintervention follow-up for promoting positive coparenting and family process within the mother-father-baby family system. Expectant parents (N = 181) were recruited from the greater Seattle area to participate in a longitudinal random clinical trials study. Families were randomly assigned to a control, workshop, or workshop plus support group. Observational coding indexed both parent and baby contribution to family interaction during the Lausanne Triadic Play procedure. Principal components analysis was used to create summary factors describing the family play. Results of intent-to-treat analyses indicated that the Bringing Baby Home program was successful in promoting less competition during family play. There also was an effect of workshop timing, suggesting that fathers who took the workshop prebirth were less likely to exhibit intrusiveness during mother-baby focused play than those who received it postbirth. Implications for promoting the formation of positive family-level relations are discussed.

In particular, the experience compromises the establishment and maintenance of optimal mother-infant relationship, the subsequent development of the infant, and the mother's emotional well-being. These findings highlight the importance of investigating early interventions that are designed to overcome or reduce the effects of these environmental insults and challenges. This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with blinded assessment comparing Standard Care (SC) with a novel Family Nurture Intervention (FNI). FNI targets preterm infants born 26-34 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) and their mothers in the NICU. The intervention incorporates elements of mother-infant interventions with known efficacy and organizes them under a new theoretical context referred to collectively as calming activities. This intervention is facilitated by specially trained Nurture Specialists in three ways: 1) In the isolette through calming interactions between mother and infant via odor exchange, firm sustained touch and vocal soothing, and eye contact; 2) Outside the isolette during holding and feeding via the Calming Cycle; and 3) through family sessions designed to engage help and support the mother. In concert with infant neurobehavioral and physiological assessments from birth through 24 months corrected age (CA), maternal assessments are made using standard tools including anxiety, depression, attachment, support systems, temperament as well as physiological stress parameters. Quality of mother-infant interaction is also assessed. Our projected enrolment is 260 families (130 per group).

However, previous studies of this population have been mainly cross-sectional and have focused on very preterm infants. Although moderate- to late-preterm infants generally thrive, the possible psychological toll on their mothers has not yet been sufficiently examined. In the current study, we used a longitudinal design to investigate whether mothers of moderate- to late-preterm infants experience elevated rates of psychological symptoms during the infant's hospitalization in the NICU and 6Â months later. Results indicated that these mothers did show elevated depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms, and that symptom levels were similar in mothers of moderate- versus late-preterm infants. Mothers of moderate- to late-preterm infants hospitalized in the NICU appeared to experience these symptoms steadily over a 6-month period after giving birth. These findings suggest a need for greater support for these mothers while in the NICU.\n\nThe Baby Boomers' intergenerational relationships.\n\nPubMed\n\nFingerman, Karen L; Pillemer, Karl A; Silverstein, Merril; Suitor, J Jill\n\n2012-04-01\n\nAs Baby Boomers enter late life, relationships with family members gain importance.

Twenty-three mothers in the intervention group received the home visiting discharge education while 12 mothers in the control group received the routine, hospital discharge education. Baseline data was collected in both groups one day after delivery. The intervention group received the home visiting discharge education while the control group did the routine hospital-based discharge education. The questionnaire including the data on maternal self-esteem, attachment, postpartum depression and family function were collected within 1 week after the discharge by mail. The scores of maternal self-esteem, and attachment were significantly increased, and the postpartum depression and the family function score were decreased after the home visiting discharge education in intervention group. There were no changes in these variables before and after the routine hospital-based discharge education in control group. These results support the beneficial effects of home visiting discharge education on the maternal role adaptation and family function of the mothers of NICU infants.\n\nHead Start Combats Baby Bottle Tooth Decay Among Native American Families.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPhillips, Margaret G.; Stubbs, Phyllis E.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nPresents current developments concerning nursing bottle caries--\"baby bottle tooth decay\"--and spotlights a program funded by Head Start to reduce the prevalence of these painful and disfiguring, but preventable, children's dental diseases among American Indians and Alaska Native families.

Parents' information in NICU.\n\nPubMed\n\nBellieni, Carlo V; Coradeschi, Caterina; Curcio, Maria R; Grande, Elisa; Buonocore, Giuseppe\n\n2018-05-14\n\nInforming the patient is a base of modern medicine; nonetheless, a great discrepancy exists between hospitals on the way this information should be administered. This is particularly important when the patient are babies: the information should be given to their parents who should approve or disapprove the treatment. Aim of this study is to assess the adequacy of the information administered to the parents of babies admitted into the Neonatal Intensive Care Units. We analyzed the consent forms of center-north Italy NICUs. To this aim, we assessed if the forms had acceptable length and other features; we then asked some volunteers to simulate an information process and to score the forms for their easiness, comprehensibility and explicability to others. Twenty-one NICUs accepted to participate. Only 7 out of 21 had an adequate information form; the other 14 could be described as \"waiver of responsibility \" (WOR), because they were too prolix and contained too many hypothetical procedures. The overall level of easiness, comprehensibility and explicability to others was suboptimal, being lower in those forms we defined WOR. The results are far to be optimal. More care should be devoted to the process of informing parents at the admission into the NICU: an information overload should be avoided and information should be tailored on the baby's state. Further analysis should be devoted to whether the use of WOR is routine in other countries.\n\n[The relationship between early neo-maternal exposure, and maternal attachment, maternal self-esteem and postpartum depression in the mothers of NICU infants].\n\nPubMed\n\nAhn, Young-Mee; Kim, Mi-Ran\n\n2005-08-01\n\nThis study was performed to investigate the quantities of three neo-maternal exposures; visiting frequency, auditory contact and physical contact, and to examine the relationship between the quantities of each exposure and maternal attachment, maternal self-esteem and postpartum depression in 40 mothers of NICU babies during the first week in the NICU. Each neo-maternal exposure was counted at every mother's visit to the newborn and maternal attachment, maternal self-esteem and postpartum depression were measured using the maternal attachment inventory, the maternal self-report inventory and Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) on the first and seventh day in the NICU. The Mean of each neo-maternal exposure was 8.77(2.81) for the visiting frequency, 5.82(3.66) for the auditory contact and 5.60(2.89) for the physical contact during 7 days in the NICU. No significant changes were found in the scores of maternal attachment, maternal self-esteem and postpartum depression between the first and the seventh day in the NICU. The quantities of neo-maternal exposures were positively related to the scores of maternal attachment and maternal self-esteem but not related to postpartum depression. The results of the study suggest the lack of early neo-maternal exposure in cases of NICU hospitalization negate its beneficial effects on maternal psychological well-being in increasing maternal attachment and self-esteem. More efforts are needed for the neo-maternal interaction and the reevaluation of NICU visitation hours in order to promote maternal-infant interaction.\n\nImplementing a Systematic Process for Consistent Nursing Care in a NICU: A Quality Improvement Project.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcCarley, Renay Marie; Dowling, Donna A; Dolansky, Mary A; Bieda, Amy\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe global aim of this quality improvement project was to develop and implement a systematic process to assign and maintain consistent bedside nurses for infants and families. A systematic process based on a primary care nursing model was implemented to assign consistent care for a 48-bed, single-family room NICU. Four PDSA cycles were necessary to obtain agreement from the nursing staff as to the best process for assigning primary nurses. Post-intervention data revealed a 9.5 percent decrease of consistent caregivers for infants in the NICU â¤ 28 days and a 2.3 percent increase of consistent caregivers for infants in the NICU â¥ 29 days. Although these findings did not meet the goal of the specific aim, a systematic process was created to assign bedside nurses to infants. Further PDSAs will be needed to refine the process to reach the aim.\n\nMedical Equipment at Home After the NICU\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

The survival rates of critically ill infants and hospitalization in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) have improved over the past 2 decades because of technological advances in neonatology. The design of NICUs may also have implications for the health of babies, parents, and staff. It is important therefore to articulate the design features of NICU that are associated with improved outcomes. The aim of this study was to explore the main features of the NICU design and to determine the advantages and limitations of the designs in terms of outcomes for babies, parents, and staff, predominately nurses. A systematic review of English-language, peer-reviewed articles was conducted for a period of 10 years, up to January 2011. Four online library databases and a number of relevant professional Web sites were searched using key words. There were 2 main designs of NICUs: open bay and single-family room. The open-bay environment develops communication and interaction with medical staff and nurses and has the ability to monitor multiple infants simultaneously. The single-family rooms were deemed superior for patient care and parent satisfaction. Key factors associated with improved outcomes included increased privacy, increased parental involvement in patient care, assistance with infection control, noise control, improved sleep, decreased length of hospital stay, and reduced rehospitalization. The design of NICUs has implications for babies, parents, and staff. An understanding of the positive design features needs to be considered by health service planners, managers, and those who design such specialized units.\n\nRecommendations for palliative and bereavement care in the NICU: a family-centered integrative approach.\n\nPubMed\n\nKenner, C; Press, J; Ryan, D\n\n2015-12-01\n\nTechnological advances have increased our ability to detect a life-threatening, life-limiting or lethal problem early in pregnancy, leaving parents months to anticipate a death or a prematurely born infant. Babies can also be born with unanticipated problems that could lead to death. In either scenario, perinatal palliative care should be offered as a strategy for family support. Since the preponderance of professional training focuses on saving lives, many health professionals are uncomfortable with palliative care. This article's purpose is to define best practices for the provision of family-centered perinatal and neonatal palliative care and provision of support to bereaved families experiencing anticipated and unanticipated life-limiting conditions or death of their infant. An overview of core concepts and values is presented, followed by intervention strategies to promote an integrated family-centered approach to palliative and bereavement care. The concluding section presents evidence-based recommendations.\n\nScoping Review of the Mental Health of Parents of Infants in the NICU.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoque, Ariane Thaise Frello; Lasiuk, Gerri C; RadÃ¼nz, Vera; Hegadoren, Kathleen\n\nTo synthesize and summarize evidence regarding the mental health of parents of infants in the NICU. Thirteen electronic databases were searched in October 2014 using the following terms individually and in combination: postpartum woman, mother, NICU, preterm birth, depression, anxiety, acute stress disorder (ASD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and parental stress. We examined the published research regarding the experiences of parents who have infants admitted to the NICU, the mental health problems that parents may develop, the tools that have been used to identify such problems, and factors related to parental mental health. After the exclusion of articles according to preset criteria, we included 66 articles in the full review. Mental health issues are common in parents of infants in the NICU across diverse ethnocultural groups and countries. Parents report feelings of guilt and shame, high levels of stress, mood and anxiety symptoms, and the positive influence of specific coping strategies and social support. The ethnocultural meanings of these experience and thus nursing interventions may differ widely. Ongoing assessments of the mental health of parents should be part of routine NICU care. Identification of mood and anxiety symptoms and testing innovative interventions to address at-risk or affected parents is imperative to ensure that there are culturally appropriate policies and services in place to respond to the mental health needs of NICU families.

In addition, ground breaking advances in the treatment of premature infants, with specific interest in the role of human milk, are now available. New information was presented by leading international researcher, Professor Meier, at an international symposium earlier this year. This article seeks to share this insightful information and provide support to those working in or around the NICU.\n\nNurses' beliefs and values about doing cue-based care in an NICU in Taiwan.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiaw, Jen-Jiuan; Chen, Shu-Yueh; Yin, Ying-Ti\n\n2004-12-01\n\nAlthough advances in medical technology have increased the survival rate of preterm infants, science is no cure-all for these high-risk patients. A growing number of studies report that caregiving interventions cause physiological and behavioral distress in such infants. The results have prompted changes in caregiving practices, attempting to reduce stress and strengthen protection for the infants, in order to promote their stability and development in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) . This study uses qualitative research methods to grasp the richness and diversity of nurses' beliefs and experience in the taking care of preterm infants. Ten groups of questions explore how NICU nurses take care of premature infants, nurses' perspectives on cue-based care, and the extent to which NICU nurses practice cue-based care. The results generated three themes: (1) timely and skillful management of the preterm infants; (2) compassionate and holistic care for the infants and their highly stressed families; and (3) the relationship between good nursing care and meeting the needs of preterm infants, families, physicians, units, and the environment. It is apparent that the approach to care delivery in NICU practice is still clinical-based, and that there are some obstacles to the delivery of cue-based care. The reasons for this include lack of knowledge, incomplete collaboration with team members, and insufficient support from the administrative systems. To improve the quality of nursing care and preterm infant outcomes, it will be necessary to educate NICU nurses on cue-based care, to enhance collaboration among all team members, to reduce their non-nursing workload, and to re-design NICUs for optimal cue-based care.\n\nNurses' Experiences of End-of-life Photography in NICU Bereavement Support.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartel, Sara; Ives-Baine, Lori\n\n2018-06-07\n\nTo qualitatively explore neonatal intensive care nurses' experiences with end-of-life photography as part of their bereavement support work with families. An Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis with data collected through a focus group (nâ¯=â¯6) and one semi-structured interview (nâ¯=â¯1) with neonatal nurses from a Level 3/4 NICU in a Canadian pediatric hospital. Participants' comfort with EOL photography developed over time through exposure to bereavement scenarios and positive experiences with families. Participants' experienced a feeling of pressure to balance the photography with clinical responsibilities and find the right time to introduce photography while being sensitive to family experiences. Participants experienced EOL photography as something tangible to give families and were satisfied knowing the images might play an important role in the family's healing after the NICU. All participants had come to value EOL photography as a positive and meaningful part of their work with bereaved families. Identified challenges related to balancing the practice with the unpredictable flow and demands of critical care and to developing an appreciation for and comfort with the photography as part of their healing and the families' healing. Findings contribute insight into care-provider experience that can inform best practices, training, and staff support for palliative and bereavement work in neonatal and pediatric settings. The findings suggest a need to support nurses emotionally and clinically in carrying out this photography as part of their care for families. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The design of NICUs has begun to shift from open-bay to single-family rooms. Both designs present unique advantages and challenges that impact babies, families, and caregivers. One NICU design was analyzed using the functional scenario (FS) analysis method. For the FS, users' needs were determined through literature review, interviews with NICU providers and parents, and a review of published design guidelines. Quantitative metrics were developed for each FS, so that characteristics of the NICU design could be analyzed to determine how successful they were in meeting the users' needs. The results were graphically represented to visualize the success and considerations of the design. A total of 23 FSs and 61 spatial metrics were developed. FSs for babies focused on infection prevention, minimizing exposure to environmental stimuli, and supporting enriching care activities. FSs for family members focused on direct access to the baby, and privacy and adequate space for daily activities. FSs for providers and caregivers focused on infection prevention, care activities, care zones, and visibility. Using an FS approach highlights design characteristics in the NICU that need to be addressed during the design process to more successfully meet the needs of the different users. Additionally, using this approach can inform design professionals' decision-making by presenting them with the design characteristics that impact the needs of the user groups.\n\nThought stopping and supportive therapy can reduce postpartum blues and anxiety parents of premature babies.\n\nPubMed\n\nLaela, Sri; Anna Keliat, Budi; Mustikasari\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe parents of premature baby tend to be at risk undergoing postpartum blues and anxiety. It is due to many problems faced by postpartum mother of premature baby. This research is aim to identifying influence of thought stopping and supportive therapy of postpartum blues and anxiety parents of premature babies. This is quantitative with quasi-experiment with control group pretest-posttest design and consecutive sampling method. Sample in this research are 62 postpartum mothers of premature babies in perinatal NICU (neonatal intensive care unit). The results show that there is significant decrease of postpartum blues and anxiety (p value = 0.000) in the group that was treated by using nursing intervention, thought stopping and supportive therapy and greater significant decrease than the group that was only treated by nursing intervention. Thought stopping and supportive therapy are able to decrease postpartum blues and anxiety parents of premature babies. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L.U.

FCC is conceptualized as a philosophy with a set of guiding principles, as well as a cohort of programs, services, and practices that many hospitals have embraced. Several factors drive the pressing need for family-centered care and support of families of infants in NICUs, including the increase in the number of infants in NICUs; growth in diversity of the population and their concurrent needs; identification of parental and familial stress and lack of parenting confidence; and gaps in support for families, as identified by parents and NICU staff. We explore the origins of and advances in FCC in the NICU and identify various delivery methods and aspects of FCC and family support in the NICU. We examine the research and available evidence supporting FCC in the NICU and offer recommendations for increased dissemination and for future study. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.

NICU births are often associated with maternal risk factors such as previous preterm or low birth weight delivery, maternal infections, chronic disease states, substance abuse and/or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Accordingly, Johns Hopkins HealthCare provides a disease management approach for the prevention of NICU births through \"Partners With Mom.\" This maternity disease management program identifies pregnant women that could potentially generate high-dollar claims. The mission of the program is to reduce hospital/NICU admissions related to pregnancy complications and improve maternal/neonatal outcomes. If an NICU birth does occur, multiple avenues are pursued to control costs. By working in concert with Partners With Mom, the NICU Disease Management Program utilizes a multifaceted approach by tracking maternal risk factors, optimizing levels of required inpatient neonatal care and pursuing other avenues of revenue enhancement.\n\nImplementing NICU critical thinking programs: one unit's experience.\n\nPubMed\n\nZimmerman, Denise; Pilcher, Jobeth\n\n2008-01-01\n\nCritical thinking is the hallmark of today's nursing practice environment. Nowhere is this more critical than in the high-tech environment of the NICU. Despite the importance of critical thinking in nursing practice, there is limited information on the process of teaching new NICU nurses to think critically. Based on the principles of adult education, orientation and continuing education for NICU nurses should be goal directed, build on the learner's prior experience, and build in opportunities for active participation, reflection, and experiential learning. This article reviews the principles of adult education and their application to the process of teaching critical thinking in the NICU. One unit's experience of critical thinking education is used to provide concrete examples of how NICU education can be transformed from a traditional didactic methodology to a more dynamic experiential approach.\n\nPaternal and maternal concerns for their very low-birth-weight infants transitioning from the NICU to home.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarfield, Craig F; Lee, Young; Kim, Hyung Nam\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis study examines qualitatively the concerns and coping mechanisms of fathers and mothers of very low-birth-weight (VLBW; <1500 g) neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) infants as they transition to home from the NICU. In-depth, semistructured phone interviews were conducted with a sample of fathers and mothers of VLBW NICU infants in the Chicago area who had transitioned home, and parental concerns were examined during the transition to home. Phone interviews lasting 30 to 60 minutes were transcribed verbatim, and all interviews were coded using content and narrative analysis. Twenty-five parents (10 fathers, 15 mothers) of 16 VLBW infants who had an average gestational age of 29.5 weeks and an average NICU stay of 58.38 days completed the interview.
