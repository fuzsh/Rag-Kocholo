        "text": "Of the 16 U-17 World Cup tournaments to date, Africa has produced seven winners and numerous stand-out performers, but there are various factors which explain why those successes at youth level have never been matched by the continent's senior national teams.\n\nNigeria claimed five crowns between 1985 and 2015, and Ghana won in 1991 and 1995, with the duo reaching the final on five further occasions. Mali, Burkina Faso, and Ivory Coast have also finished on the podium.\n\nThe likes of Cesc Fabregas, Toni Kroos, and Landon Donovan have previously won the tournament's Golden Ball award for the best player, but no nation has produced as many winners as Nigeria, with Philip Osundu, Sani Emmanuel, Kelechi Iheanacho, and Kelechi Nwakali all claiming the coveted prize.\n\nIn recent years, Macauley Chrisantus, Souleymane Coulibaly, and Victor Osimhen have all finished the tournament as top scorer, while various other continental wonderkids have shone in the competition, with Nii Lamptey memorably dazzling spectators in Italy in 1991.\n\nHowever, this dominance at youth level, where the continent's starlets have so regularly outclassed their counterparts from Europe and South America, has resulted in precious little success at senior level.\n\nOsundu, Daniel Addo (the best player in 1993) Coulibaly, Chrisantus, and Emmanuel never represented their nations at senior level, while Kroos, Fabregas, and Donovan have well over 300 caps - and two World Cup winner's medals - between them.\n\nAdmittedly, not all of the tournament's non-African stars have gone onto glittering careers - Florent Sinama Pongolle famously failed to deliver on his undisputed promise at youth level following a star turn for France in 2001 - and we're still waiting to see whether Borja Baston and Julio Gomez can realise the careers they appeared destined for in 2009 and 2011 respectively.\n\nYet, the success rate of Africa's Under-17 stars is depressingly low.\n\nOf the 10 starlets to win an individual award at the competition since 1990, arguably only Wilson Oruma realised his potential, although prospects are good for Iheanacho, Nwakali, and Osimhen.\n\nThere is a litany of factors that have prevented the pick of Africa's youth stars, and those in the tiers below, from realising the promise they displayed as youngsters, and even more reasons to explain why the continent has consistently failed to replicate its U-17 success at the World Cup proper.\n\nIn a recent interview, Emmanuel Amuneke - a Super Eagles legend and the head coach of Nigeria's U-17 World Cup-winning team - outlined why he believed the continent's youngsters failed to build on their successes at youth level.\n\n\"After the U-17 World Cup, we continue to dwell on the players' talent, we forget that they should continue to develop and groom them to be better players,\" he began, as per The Hindu.\n\n\"In football, mostly in Europe and South America, when the U-17 championships end, players join clubs and continue to grow, continue to get transformed.\n\n\"Unfortunately, in Africa, this link is missing.\"\n\nCertainly, historically at least, the continent's wonderkids either do not have the infrastructure in their own countries to continue their development, or face the obstacles that accompany a move to another continent, another climate, and another culture.\n\nThe aforementioned Lamptey - one of Africa's most infamous failed wonderkids - is a pertinent example.\n\nTipped by Pele as his successor, he outshone Juan Sebastian Veron, Marcelo Gallardo, and Alessandro Del Piero to inspire Ghana to the title in 1991, but struggled to adapt to life in England after originally thriving in Belgium, and wholly failed to combat the unrealistic expectations that accompanied his meteoric rise.\n\nIn an interview with The Guardian in 2008, Lamptey discussed how - away from his home and his support network - he was exploited ruthlessly in England, while the toll of playing so many matches, both at his clubs and at youth level for Ghana, led to a burn out.\n\nLamptey never had the kind of mentors and guides who could ensure that he was protected, both as a player and as a person.\n\n\"We are dealing with U-17 players, they are young players,\" Amuneke added. \"The most important thing is to make sure they see you as someone chosen to head them, not as a coach.\n\n\"You should try as much as possible to guide them. There are a lot of distractions going on in their mind, so see that you can bring them to the level where they can compete with the rest of the World Cup teams.\"\n\nLamptey, alas, never had such a guiding hand to help him through the myriad of obstacles he faced after leaving West Africa.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC in 2010, Chrisantus also outlined how the devastating trio of culture shock, expectations, and injuries derailed his progress after swapping Hearts of Abuja for Hamburg in 2007.\n\nThere is also the hope that a swathe of new academies across the continent can help to ensure that African players can continue their development in an environment that's more conducive to both their talent and their well-being.\n\nOf the two recent fantastic young generations of Malian talents, many players graduated from Jean-Marc Guillou's network of JMG Academies - established in 2002 and following in the footsteps of his success with ASEC Mimosas - including Adama Traore, Yves Bissouma, and Hamari Traore.\n\nSimilarly, the Samuel Eto'o Foundation, Diambars, and Generation Foot in Senegal, and Algeria's Paradou AC are also overseeing the development of promising youngsters into players who can make a consistent impact in Europe's major leagues.\n\nThese environments allow players to mature both on the field and off it before moving on to try their hand in Europe.\n\nAnother major problem affecting the continent's game at youth level is age fraud, with Ghana and Nigeria among the nations hit with 'age scandals' in recent years.\n\nFour years ago, players from Nigeria, Ivory Coast, and Congo-Brazzaville were prevented from playing in the U-17 World Cup after MRI scans revealed them to be older than their birth certificates suggested.\n\nOne of those excluded - Wilfred Ndidi - is currently impressing in the Premier League for Leicester City, demonstrating remarkable composure for a 20-year-old.\n\n\"It has been a big problem and still is,\" former Nigeria international Jonathan Akpoborie told BBC Sport in 2014. \"Some of them played at the Under-17 level and then a few years later retire because they can't run any more.\n\n\"When you look at the African players playing for the Under-17s, maybe one or two years later they have retired because they can't produce what they produced at Under-17 level because they are so old.\n\n\"The wrong players are being given the platform.\"\n\nFilippo Maria Ricci wrote amusingly in 'Elephants, Lions and Eagles: A Journey Through African Football' about the African youth player who infamously changed his date of birth five times. And the U-17 forward who bore more than a striking resemblance to the attacker who had represented the U-20 side five years previously.\n\nThese tales betray the negligence of too many of the players and teams that have underpinned Africa's greatest successes in youth competitions.\n\nAge cheating helped young players get noticed after excelling against their peers, and it also helped under-pressure youth team coaches forge stronger teams, yet this short termism ultimately came to the detriment of the continent's senior sides.\n\nAs it becomes easier for African talents to get noticed at a young age - within the right environment - and as testing becomes more advanced, more widespread, and stricter, the hope is that the practice will diminish.\n\nA Nigerian policy to number school children in order to establish a database for players in junior leagues should also reduce the potential for obscurity, which has allowed older talents to feature in youth tournaments.\n\nIt's fast becoming too risky for federations to cheat the system, or even turn a blind eye to uncertainties over age or providence, and Africa's players - and their national sides - should benefit.\n\nUltimately, the true success of FIFA's policies, African academies, and increased age testing will not be judged by the performance of the continent's sides at youth tournaments, but by how many career titles, individual awards, and senior caps that Africa's finest prospects can amass during their careers."
