        "text": "Christian Charles Philip Bale was born in Pembrokeshire, Wales, UK on January 30, 1974, to English parents Jennifer \"Jenny\" (James) and David Bale. His mother was a circus performer and his father, who was born in South Africa, was a commercial pilot. The family lived in different countries throughout Bale's childhood, including England, Portugal, and the United States. Bale acknowledges the constant change was one of the influences on his career choice.\n\nHis first acting job was a cereal commercial in 1983; amazingly, the next year, he debuted on the West End stage in \"The Nerd\". A role in the 1986 NBC mini-series Anastasia (1986) caught Steven Spielberg's eye, leading to Bale's well-documented role in Das Reich der Sonne (1987). For the range of emotions he displayed as the star of the war epic, he earned a special award by the National Board of Review for Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor.\n\nAdjusting to fame and his difficulties with attention (he thought about quitting acting early on), Bale appeared in Kenneth Branagh's 1989 adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry V. (1989) and starred as Jim Hawkins in a TV movie version of Die Schatzinsel (1990). Bale worked consistently through the 1990s, acting and singing in Die Zeitungsjungen (1992), Swing Kids (1993), Betty und ihre Schwestern (1994), Portrait of a Lady (1996), Der Geheimagent (1996), Metroland (1997), Velvet Goldmine (1998), All the Little Animals (1998), and Ein Sommernachtstraum (1999). Toward the end of the decade, with the rise of the Internet, Bale found himself becoming one of the most popular online celebrities around, though he, with a couple notable exceptions, maintained a private, tabloid-free mystique.\n\nBale roared into the next decade with a lead role in American Psycho (2000), director Mary Harron's adaptation of the controversial Bret Easton Ellis novel. In the film, Bale played a murderous Wall Street executive obsessed with his own physicality - a trait for which Bale would become a specialist. Subsequently, the 10th Anniversary issue for \"Entertainment Weekly\" crowned Bale one of the \"Top 8 Most Powerful Cult Figures\" of the past decade, citing his cult status on the Internet. EW also called Bale one of the \"Most Creative People in Entertainment\", and \"Premiere\" lauded him as one of the \"Hottest Leading Men Under 30\".\n\nBale was truly on the Hollywood radar at this time, and he turned in a range of performances in the remake Shaft - Noch Fragen? (2000), Corellis Mandoline (2001), the balmy Laurel Canyon (2002), and Die Herrschaft des Feuers (2002), a dragons-and-magic commercial misfire that has its share of defenders.\n\nTwo more cult films followed: Equilibrium (2002) and Der Maschinist (2004), the latter of which gained attention mainly due to Bale's physical transformation - he dropped a reported 60+ pounds for the role of a lathe operator with a secret that causes him to suffer from insomnia for over a year.\n\nBale's abilities to transform his body and to disappear into a character influenced the decision to cast him in Batman Begins (2005), the first chapter in Christopher Nolan's definitive trilogy that proved a dark-themed narrative could resonate with audiences worldwide. The film also resurrected a character that had been shelved by Warner Bros. after a series of demising returns, capped off by the commercial and critical failure of Batman & Robin (1997). A quiet, personal victory for Bale: he accepted the role after the passing of his father in late 2003, an event that caused him to question whether he would continue performing.\n\nBale segued into two indie features in the wake of Batman's phenomenal success: The New World (2005) and Harsh Times - Leben am Limit (2005). He continued working with respected independent directors in 2006's Rescue Dawn (2006), Werner Herzog's feature version of his earlier, Emmy-nominated documentary, Flucht aus Laos (1997). Leading up to the second Batman film, Bale starred in Prestige - Die Meister der Magie (2006), the remake of Todeszug nach Yuma (2007), and a reunion with director Todd Haynes in the experimental Bob Dylan biography, I'm Not There (2007).\n\nAnticipation for The Dark Knight (2008) was spun into unexpected heights with the tragic passing of Heath Ledger, whose performance as The Joker became the highlight of the sequel. Bale's graceful statements to the press reminded us of the days of the refined Hollywood star as the second installment exceeded the box-office performance of its predecessor.\n\nBale's next role was the eyebrow-raising decision to take over the role of John Connor in the Schwarzenegger-less Terminator: Die Erl√∂sung (2009), followed by a turn as federal agent Melvin Purvis in Michael Mann's Public Enemies (2009). Both films were hits but not the blockbusters they were expected to be.\n\nFor all his acclaim and box-office triumphs, Bale would earn his first Oscar in 2011 in the wake of The Fighter (2010)'s critical and commercial success. Bale earned the Best Supporting Actor award for his portrayal of Dicky Eklund, brother to and trainer of boxer \"Irish\" Micky Ward, played by Mark Wahlberg. Bale again showed his ability to reshape his body with another gaunt, skeletal transformation.\n\nBale then turned to another auteur, Yimou Zhang, for the epic The Flowers of War (2011), in which Bale portrayed a priest trapped in the midst of the Rape of Nanking. Bale earned headlines for his attempt to visit with Chinese civil-rights activist Chen Guangcheng, which was blocked by the Chinese government.\n\nBale capped his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Dark Knight Rises (2012); in the wake of the Aurora, Colorado tragedy, Bale made a quiet pilgrimage to the state to visit with survivors of the attack that left theatergoers dead and injured. He also starred in the thriller Auge um Auge - Out of the Furnace (2013) with Crazy Heart (2009) writer/director Scott Cooper, and the drama-comedy American Hustle (2013), reuniting with David O. Russell.\n\nBale will re-team with The New World (2005) director Terrence Malick for two upcoming projects: Knight of Cups (2015) and an as-yet-untitled drama.\n\nIn his personal life, he devotes time to charities including Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Foundation. He lives with his wife, Sibi Blazic, and their two children.\n\nSteve Carell, one of America's most versatile comics, was born Steven John Carell on August 16, 1962, in Concord, Massachusetts. He is the son of Harriet Theresa (Koch), a psychiatric nurse, and Edwin A. Carell, an electrical engineer. His mother was of Polish descent and his father of Italian and German ancestry (Steve's grandfather had changed the surname from \"Caroselli\" to \"Carell\"). Steve was educated at The Fenn School, an all-boys private school in Concord, Massachusetts, then at Middlesex School in Concord. After graduating from Denison University in Granville, Ohio, he moved to Chicago where he taught an improvisational comedy class and performed with The Second City troupe, alongside Stephen Colbert.\n\nCarell made his film debut as \"Tesio\" in Curly Sue - Ein Lockenkopf sorgt f√ºr Wirbel (1991). In 1996, he became a cast member of The Dana Carvey Show (1996), and provided the voice for Gary, opposite Colbert in \"The Ambiguously Gay Duo\". This animated short series produced by Robert Smigel continued on Saturday Night Live (1975), but Carell has joked that he auditioned for SNL and lost the job to Will Ferrell. Carell made a number of guest appearances on such shows as Come to Papa (2004), Just Shoot Me - Redaktion durchgeknipst (1997), and Watching Ellie (2002), before landing a regular stint as a correspondent on The Daily Show (1996) from 1999 until 2005.\n\nCarell played Evan Baxter opposite Jim Carrey in Bruce Allm√§chtig (2003), and Uncle Arthur opposite Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell in Verliebt in eine Hexe (2005). He broke out as a leading man after starring in the summer box-office hit Jungfrau (40), m√§nnlich, sucht... (2005), which he also co-wrote; the film was chosen as one of the Top Ten movies of 2006 by the American Film Institute. He next starred in the critically acclaimed Little Miss Sunshine (2006), an indie dark comedy which became a surprise hit and earned four Oscar nominations, and won two (Best Supporting Actor for Alan Arkin and Best Screenplay for Michael Arndt). In 2007, Carell reprised his role as Evan Baxter, filling Jim Carrey's leading-man shoes as a politician asked by God to build a giant ark in Evan Allm√§chtig (2007), the second installment of the \"Almighty\" franchise, co-starring Lauren Graham and Morgan Freeman. In 2008, he re-united with Jim Carrey in the highly successful animation hit Horton h√∂rt ein Hu (2008), then appeared as Agent Maxwell Smart in the popular comedy Get Smart (2008).\n\nThroughout this time, Carell maintained a successful career in television, starring as Michael Scott in the American remake of the Britain's existential comedy, Das B√ºro (2005). He received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in Television Comedy for this leading role in 2006, and earned both Emmy and Golden Globe nominations each consecutive show until he departed in 2011.\n\nIn 2010, Carell announced he was leaving \"The Office\" to concentrate on his film career, and has made steady appearance in such films as Date Night - Gangster f√ºr eine Nacht (2010), Ich - Einfach unverbesserlich (2010), Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011), and Auf der Suche nach einem Freund f√ºrs Ende der Welt (2012). Carell's most recent roles are the comedies Ich - Einfach unverbesserlich 2 (2013), Anchorman - Die Legende kehrt zur√ºck (2013), and Die Coopers - Schlimmer geht immer (2014), and the drama Foxcatcher (2014), and the more serious Beautiful Boy (2018) and Vice - Der zweite Mann (2018).\n\nSteve Carell has been enjoying a happy family life with his wife, actress Nancy Carell, whom he met when she was a student in an improv class he was teaching at The Second City comedy troupe in Chicago. The couple have two children, daughter Elizabeth (born in May 2001), and son John (born in June 2004). Steve Carell lives with his family in Los Angeles, California.\n\nFew actors in the world have had a career quite as diverse as Leonardo DiCaprio's. DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom Unser lautes Heim (1985) and low budget horror movies, such as Critters 3 - Die Kuschelkiller kommen (1991), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such as William Shakespeares Romeo & Julia (1996) and Titanic (1997), to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such as Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan.\n\nLeonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born in Los Angeles, California, the only child of Irmelin DiCaprio (n√©e Indenbirken) and former comic book artist George DiCaprio. His father is of Italian and German descent, and his mother, who is German-born, is of German, Ukrainian and Russian ancestry. His middle name, \"Wilhelm\", was his maternal grandfather's first name. Leonardo's father had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late 'Harvey Pekar', a friend of George's. Leonardo's performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name \"Lenny Williams\", DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs.\n\nDiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in small roles in a number of television series, such as Roseanne (1988) and Lassie (1989), but it wasn't until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in Critters 3 - Die Kuschelkiller kommen (1991), a low-budget horror movie. While Critters 3 - Die Kuschelkiller kommen (1991) did little to help showcase DiCaprio's acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel, and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcom Unser lautes Heim (1985), in which Leonardo was cast in the \"Cousin Oliver\" role of a young homeless boy who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio's stint on Unser lautes Heim (1985) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring DiCaprio into the public's attention and, after the sitcom ended, DiCaprio began auditioning for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops.\n\nLeonardo took up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth in Gilbert Grape - Irgendwo in Iowa (1993), a young gunslinger in Schneller als der Tod (1995) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date, Jim Carroll in Jim Carroll - In den Stra√üen von New York (1995), a role which the late River Phoenix originally expressed interest in. While these diverse roles helped establish Leonardo's reputation as an actor, it wasn't until his role as Romeo Montague in Baz Luhrmann's William Shakespeares Romeo & Julia (1996) that Leonardo became a household name, a true movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers, Titanic (1997), which went on to beat all box office records held before then, as, at the time, Titanic (1997) became the highest grossing movie of all time, and cemented DiCaprio's reputation as a teen heartthrob. Following his work on Titanic (1997), DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in Der Mann in der eisernen Maske (1998) and the low-budget The Beach (2000) being some of his few notable roles during this period.\n\nIn 2002, he burst back into screens throughout the world with leading roles in Catch Me If You Can (2002) and Gangs of New York (2002), his first of many collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the natural environment. As someone who has gone from small roles in television commercials to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continued to defy conventions about the types of roles he would accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all-star casts in action thrillers such as Departed: Unter Feinden (2006), Shutter Island (2010) and Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010), DiCaprio continues to wow audiences by refusing to conform to any clich√© about actors.\n\nIn 2012, he played a mustache twirling villain in Django Unchained (2012), and then tragic literary character Jay Gatsby in Der gro√üe Gatsby (2013) and Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street (2013).\n\nDiCaprio is passionate about environmental and humanitarian causes, having donated $1,000,000 to earthquake relief efforts in 2010, the same year he contributed $1,000,000 to the Wildlife Conservation Society.\n\nClaudio Santamaria is born in Rome. His career begins on the big screen in 1998, but his big break arrives in 2001, when Gabriele Muccino casts him for \"L'Ultimo Bacio\". Throughout the years he appears in many movies and in 2005 he wins the Nastro D'Argento for Best Actor for \"Romanzo Criminale\" directed by Michele Placido. The Italian and international movies that highlighted his career include: \"Il Cartaio\" by Dario Argento, \"Torneranno I Prati\" by Ermanno Olmi, \"Casino Royale\" by Martin Campbell, \"600 Kilos d'or pur\" by Eric Besnard and \"Pauline D√®tective\" directed by Marc Fitoussi. He voiced Christian Bale's Batman in Italian in \"Batman Begins\", \"The Dark Knight\", \"The Dark Knight Rises\" and Batman in \"The Lego Movie\", \"LEGO Batman - The Movie\", The LEGO Movie 2 - The Second Part\" and in the Spotify Podcast \"Batman - Un'autopsia\". He is beloved from the tv audience for his performance in the biopic of the famous Italian singer \"Rino Gaetano - Il Cielo √® Sempre Pi√π Blu\" and being himself a great musician he performed all the songs in this series. In 2015 he appears as the protagonist, Orlando Mieli, in the TV series \"√à Arrivata la Felicit√†\", a romantic comedy acclaimed by the Italian public since the pilot episode, this is why the second season was confirmed in 2017. The past few years he works in theatre, acting in \"Occidente Solitario\" by Martin McDonagh directed by Juan Diego Puerta Lopez and \"Gospodin\" by Philipp Lohle directed by Giorgio Barberio Corsetti. In 2017 he acts as Enzo Ceccotti in \"Lo Chiamavano Jeeg Robot\", directed by Gabriele Mainetti: It was thanks to this role that he wins the David Di Donatello as Best Actor. In the meantime he debuts as a director with the short movie \"The Millionairs\"; his cinematic journey proceeds throughout the next few years with \"Brutti e Cattivi\", first movie by Cosimo Gomez, \"Rimetti a Noi i Nostri Debiti\" by Antonio Morabito, \"Tutto il Mio Folle Amore\" directed by Oscar Wininng director Gabriele Salvatores presented in the 76th Venice International Film Festival. He continues his creative journey with the director Gabriele Muccino working on \"Gli Anni Pi√π Belli\" released in 2020. In 2021 he is presented in the 78th Venice International Film Festival with the Film \"Freaks Out\" directed by Gabriele Mainetti where he acts as \"BeastMan\" affected by hypertrichosis with super-human strength. In 2022 he is Matteo, Postulator of the Vatican, in the Sky series \"Christian\" directed by Stefano Lodovichi and Antonio Nicastro, manager of the daily newspaper \"L'Ora - Inchiostro contro Piombo\" directed by Piero Messina, Ciro D'Emilio and Stefano Lorenzi. He also voiced the brave monster hunter Jacob Holland in Italian in the animated Netflix show \"Il Mostro Dei Mari\". In 2023 he acts as Franco in the drama \"Educazione Fisica\" directed by Stefano Cipani and presented as preview in the National Film Festival in Rome, he returns in the second season of the series \"Christian\" as Matteo, and is the voice of Super Mario in the animated movie \"Super Mario Bros - The Movie\".\n\nHugh Michael Jackman is an Australian actor, singer, multi-instrumentalist, dancer and producer.

In his spare time, Jackman plays piano, golf, and guitar, and likes to windsurf.\n\nChristoph Waltz is an Austrian-German actor. He is known for his work with American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, receiving acclaim for portraying SS-Standartenf√ºhrer Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds (2009) and bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz in Django Unchained (2012). For each performance, he won an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Additionally, he received the Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film Festival and a Screen Actors Guild Award for his portrayal of Landa.\n\nChristoph Waltz was born in Vienna, Austria, into a theatrical family, his mother Elisabeth Urbancic, an Austrian-born costume designer, and Johannes Waltz, a German-born stage builder. He has three siblings. His maternal grandmother was Viennese Burgtheater actress Maria Mayen, and his step-grandfather was fellow Burgtheater actor Emmerich Reimers. His maternal grandfather, Rudolf von Urban, was a psychologist and psychiatrist who wrote the 1949 book \"Sex Perfection and Marital Happiness\".\n\nWaltz attended the Theresianium and Billrothstrasse in Vienna. Upon graduation, he attended the Max-Reinhardt-Seminar before going to New York to the Lee Strasberg Institute. While in New York, Christoph met his first wife, and moved back to Vienna, then to London.\n\nDuring the 80s, Christoph worked primarily in theatre, commuting from his home in London to Germany. Slowly Waltz began to work in TV, taking one-off roles in series, and TV movies. Film roles soon followed. Attempts to break into English-speaking film and TV were, however, unsuccessful. Waltz has expressed his gratitude to have been able to make a living and support his family through acting. For thirty years he worked steadily, tirelessly, in this manner.\n\nIt was not until he met Quentin Tarantino that his career in Hollywood took off. The role of Colonel Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds (2009) catapulted Waltz from a lifetime working in German TV/film to the new life of an international superstar and Academy Award-winning actor. He won 27 awards for his performance as Hans Landa, including the Cannes prix d'interpretation Masculin for 2009, the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor, the BAFTA Best Supporting Actor award, and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (which he won again for 2012's Django Unchained (2012)).\n\nHe also has portrayed computer genius Qohen Leth in the film The Zero Theorem (2013), American plagiarist Walter Keane in the biographical film _Big Eyes (2014), and 007's nemesis and head of SPECTRE Ernst Stavro Blofeld in _Spectre (2015)_. In Quentin Tarantino's 2009 film Inglourious Basterds, Waltz portrayed SS-Standartenf√ºhrer Hans Landa, aka \"The Jew Hunter\". Clever, courteous, and multilingual - but also self-serving, cunning, implacable, and murderous. Waltz played gangster Benjamin Chudnofsky in The Green Hornet (2011). That same year, he starred in Wasser f√ºr die Elefanten (2011), Roman Polanski's Der Gott des Gemetzels (2011), and a remake of Die drei Musketiere (2011). He played German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz in Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained (2012), a role Tarantino wrote specifically for Waltz.\n\nWaltz resides in Berlin and Los Angeles. His wife is costume builder Judith Holste.\n\nBritish actor Clive Owen is one of a handful of stars who, though he is best known for his art house films, can handle more mainstream films with equal measures of grace and skill. Owen is typically cast as characters whose primary traits are a balance of physical strength, intellect, conflicting soul but forceful will. He is best known to film audiences for his work in Children of Men (2006), Hautnah (2004) and his breakout part in Der Croupier (1998).\n\nBorn in Coventry, in England's West Midlands county, on 3 October 1964, Owen is the fourth of five brothers. He is the son of Pamela (Cotton) and Jess Owen, a country and western singer. His father abandoned the family when he was three years old, and Owen was subsequently raised by his mother and stepfather. He attended Binley Park Comprehensive School and joined the youth theater at 13 after playing the scene-stealing role of the Artful Dodger in a production of \"Oliver!\"\n\nActing was not his first choice as a profession, but he changed his mind and went on to graduate from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1987. Owen proceeded to join the Young Vic Theatre Company, where he honed his craft while performing in a number of Shakespearean productions.\n\nClive made his film debut in the British-made Vroom! - Ab in die Freiheit (1990) co-starring with David Thewlis as two fellows who restore a classic American car and take off on the road. Within two years, Clive became a full-fledged TV star playing devilish rogue Stephen Crane in Chancer (1990). However, the now-sought-after Clive abandoned the star-making part at the height of the show's popularity because of unwanted invasion of privacy and his fear of typecasting. His next project raised more than a few eyebrows when he filmed Schlie√üe meine Augen - Begehre oder T√∂te mich (1991) in which he played a brother who acts on his incestuous desires for his older sister. Clive's reputation as a lovable shyster was completely shattered and he lost profitable commercial endorsements following the film's release. Offers fell off for the next two years as a result. But the persistent Clive carried on with stage work, including the role of a bisexual in a production of No√´l Coward's \"Design For Living.\" He returned to TV at that time as well and played a number of roles in both mini-movies and series.\n\nIn 1997, Clive had a huge hit on the London stage with \"Closer,\" a cynical, contemporary ensemble piece about relationships. Controversy surrounded him again in the film role of Max in Bent (1997) playing a brash, reckless homosexual lothario in decadent pre-war Germany who finds unconditional love while interned in a Nazi war camp. His biggest film break, however, was in Mike Hodges' Der Croupier (1998), as a struggling writer-turned-casino employee who gets in over his head with a femme fatale scam artist. English audiences stayed away in droves but the U.S. embraced the film and Hollywood took notice of Clive, who was virtually unknown outside of England. Despite playing detective Ross Tanner in a series of successful \"Second Sight\" mini-movies and finding critical acclaim on stage with \"The Day in the Death of Joe Egg\" in 2001, Clive has focused primarily on film, including the offbeat Brit romantic comedy Greenfingers - Harte Jungs & zarte Triebe (2000), the classy and popular Robert Altman period piece Gosford Park (2001), the Matt Damon star-vehicle Die Bourne Identit√§t (2002), and the title role in King Arthur (2004). He has since reached the top rungs of the Hollywood ladder with the film version of his stage smash Hautnah (2004), in which he received an Academy Award nomination and won both the Golden Globe and BAFTA awards for \"Supporting Actor.\" He also had noteworthy roles opposite Denzel Washington in Inside Man (2006); and Julianne Moore and Michael Caine in Children of Men (2006), as well as handling a few biopics, playing Sir Walter Raleigh opposite Cate Blanchett's Elizabeth I in the film Elizabeth - Das goldene K√∂nigreich (2007) and Ernest Hemingway (Emmy nomination) in Hemingway & Gellhorn (2012) also starring Nicole Kidman.\n\nMore recent films include starring roles in The International (2009), Duplicity - Gemeinsame Geheimsache (2009), The Boys Are Back - Zur√ºck ins Leben (2009), Trust - Blindes Vertrauen (2010), Intruders (2011), Blood Ties (2013), Last Knights - Die Ritter des 7. Ordens (2015), The Confirmation (2016) and Anon (2018). He also played Claudius in a retelling of \"Hamlet\" per Ophelia's perspective in Ophelia (2018); and played in support to Will Smith in the sci-fi thriller Gemini Man (2019).\n\nOwen is married to former actress Sarah-Jane Fenton, who played Juliet to his Romeo at the Young Vic in 1998. The couple has two daughters.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. has evolved into one of the most respected actors in Hollywood. With an amazing list of credits to his name, he has managed to stay new and fresh even after over four decades in the business.\n\nDowney was born April 4, 1965 in Manhattan, New York, the son of writer, director and filmographer Robert Downey Sr. and actress Elsie Downey (n√©e Elsie Ann Ford). Robert's father is of half Lithuanian Jewish, one quarter Hungarian Jewish, and one quarter Irish, descent, while Robert's mother was of English, Scottish, German, and Swiss-German ancestry. Robert and his sister, Allyson Downey, were immersed in film and the performing arts from a very young age, leading Downey Jr. to study at the Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center in upstate New York, before moving to California with his father following his parents' 1978 divorce. In 1982, he dropped out of Santa Monica High School to pursue acting full time. Downey Sr., himself a drug addict, exposed his son to drugs at a very early age, and Downey Jr. would go on to struggle with abuse for decades.\n\nDowney Jr. made his debut as an actor at the age of five in the film Pound (1970), written and directed by his father, Robert Downey Sr.. He built his film repertoire throughout the 1980s and 1990s with roles in Love-Fighters - Tuff Turf (1985), L.I.S.A. - Der helle Wahnsinn (1985), Das dreckige Spiel (1989), and Die Wonder Boys (2000) among many others. In 1992, Downey received an Academy Award nomination and won the BAFTA (British Academy Award) for Best Actor for his performance in the title role of Chaplin - Das Leben der unsterblichen Filmlegende (1992).\n\nIn Robert Altman's Short Cuts (1993), he appeared as an aspiring film make-up artist whose best friend commits murder. In Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers (1994), with Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis, Downey starred as a tabloid TV journalist who exploits a murderous couple's killing spree to boost his ratings. For the comedy 4 himmlische Freunde (1993), Downey starred as a young man with a special relationship with four ghosts. In 1995, Downey starred in Zeit der Sinnlichkeit (1995), with Hugh Grant, Meg Ryan and Ian McKellen, directed by Michael Hoffman. Also that year, he starred in Richard III (1995), in which he appears opposite his Zeit der Sinnlichkeit (1995) co-star McKellen.\n\nIn 1997, Downey was seen in Robert Altman's The Gingerbread Man (1998), alongside Kenneth Branagh, Daryl Hannah and Embeth Davidtz; in One Night Stand (1997), directed by Mike Figgis and starring Wesley Snipes and Nastassja Kinski; and in Hugo Pool (1997), directed by his father, Robert Downey Sr. and starring Sean Penn and Patrick Dempsey. In September of 1999, Downey appeared in Black and White (1999), written and directed by James Toback, along with Ben Stiller, Elijah Wood, Gaby Hoffmann, Brooke Shields and Claudia Schiffer. In January of 1999, he starred with Annette Bening and Aidan Quinn in Jenseits der Tr√§ume (1999), directed by Neil Jordan.\n\nIn 2000, Downey co-starred with Michael Douglas and Tobey Maguire in Die Wonder Boys (2000), directed by Curtis Hanson. In this dramatic comedy, Downey played the role of a bisexual literary agent. In 2001, Downey made his prime-time television debut when he joined the cast of the Fox-TV series Ally McBeal (1997) as attorney \"Larry Paul\". For this role, he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television, as well as the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male in a Comedy Series. In addition, Downey was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.\n\nThe actor's drug-related problems escalated from 1996 to 2001, leading to arrests, rehab visits and incarcerations, and he was eventually fired from Ally McBeal (1997). Emerging clean and sober in 2003, Downey Jr. began to rebuild his career.\n\nHe marked his debut into music with his debut album, titled \"The Futurist\", on the Sony Classics Label on November 23rd, 2004. The album's eight original songs, that Downey wrote, and his two musical numbers debuting as cover songs revealed his sultry singing voice and his musical talents. Downey displayed his versatility in two different films in October 2003: the musical/drama The Singing Detective (2003), a remake of the BBC hit of the same name, and the thriller Gothika (2003) starring Halle Berry and Pen√©lope Cruz. Downey starred in powerful yet humbling roles inspired by real-life accounts of some of history's most precious kept secrets, including Richard Linklater's A Scanner Darkly - Der dunkle Schirm (2006) in 2006 co-starring Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder and Woody Harrelson, and Fell - Ein imagin√§res Portrait von Diane Arbus (2006) co-starring Nicole Kidman, a film inspired by the life of Diane Arbus, the revered photographer whose images captured attention in the early 1960s. These roles exhibited Downey's momentum from the previous year of 2005, in which he starred in the Academy Award¬Æ-nominated feature film Good Night, and Good Luck. (2005), directed by George Clooney and in Shane Black's action comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) co-starring Val Kilmer. In 2007, he co-starred in David Fincher's suspenseful Zodiac: Die Spur des Killers (2007), alongside Jake Gyllenhaal and Mark Ruffalo, about the notorious serial killer who haunted San Francisco during the 1970s.\n\nIn May 2008, Downey achieved critical acclaim and worldwide box office success for his starring role in Iron Man (2008), Jon Favreau's big-screen rendering of the Marvel comic book superhero. The film co-starred Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard. In August of 2008, Downey starred with Ben Stiller and Jack Black in the comedy Tropic Thunder (2008), and went on to receive an Academy Award¬Æ-nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his, Kirk Lazarus.\n\nIn December 2009, Downey starred in the action-adventure Sherlock Holmes (2009). The film, directed by Guy Ritchie, co-starred Jude Law and Rachel McAdams and earned Downey a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical in January of 2010. In early Summer 2010, Downey re-teamed with director Jon Favreau and reprised his role as \"Tony Stark/Iron Man\" in the hugely successful sequel to the original film, Iron Man 2 (2010), starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson and Mickey Rourke.\n\nDowney next starred in Stichtag - Schluss mit gem√ºtlich (2010), a comedy directed by Todd Phillips, in which he plays the role of an expectant father on a road trip racing to get back in time for the birth of his first child. Stichtag - Schluss mit gem√ºtlich (2010), starring Hangover (2009)'s Zach Galifianakis, was released in November 2010.\n\nDowney was honored by Time Magazine's \"Time 100\" in 2008, an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world. His laurels include two Academy Award nominations, three Golden Globe wins, numerous other award nominations and wins, and tremendous popular and commercial success, particularly in his roles as Sherlock Holmes and Tony Stark (the latter of which he has so far played in Iron Man (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), The Avengers (2012), Iron Man 3 (2013), and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015). For three consecutive years, from 2012 to 2015, Downey has topped the Forbes list of Hollywood's highest-paid actors, making an estimated $80 million in earnings between June 2014 and June 2015.\n\nIn 2005, Downey Jr. married Susan Downey, with whom he has two children. Downey also has another son, Indio Falconer Downey, born 1993, from his first marriage to Deborah Falconer, from whom he was officially divorced in 2004.\n\nRobert has jump-started the Team Downey Production Company with wife Susan Downey.\n\nActor Ralph Nathaniel Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes was born on December 22, 1962 in Suffolk, England, to Jennifer Anne Mary Alleyne (Lash), a novelist, and Mark Fiennes, a photographer. He is the eldest of six children. Four of his siblings are also in the arts: Martha Fiennes, a director; Magnus Fiennes, a musician; Sophie Fiennes, a producer; and Joseph Fiennes, an actor. He is of English, Irish, and Scottish origin.\n\nA noted Shakespeare interpreter, he first achieved success onstage at the Royal National Theatre. Fiennes first worked on screen in 1990 and then made his film debut in 1992 as Heathcliff in Emily Bront√´'s St√ºrmische Leidenschaft (1992), opposite Juliette Binoche. 1993 was his \"breakout year\". He had a major role in the controversial Peter Greenaway film Das Wunder von Macon (1993), with Julia Ormond, which was poorly received. Later that year he became known internationally for portraying the amoral Nazi concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth in Steven Spielberg's Schindlers Liste (1993). For this he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. He did not win, but did win the Best Supporting Actor BAFTA Award for the role, as well as Best Supporting Actor honors from numerous critics groups, including the National Society of Film Critics, and the New York, Chicago, Boston, and London Film Critics associations. His portrayal as G√∂th also earned him a spot on the American Film Institute's list of Top 50 Film Villains. To look suitable to represent Goeth, Fiennes gained weight, but he managed to shed it afterwards. In 1994, he portrayed American academic Charles Van Doren in Quiz Show (1994). In 1996, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as Count Alm√°sy the World War II epic romance, and another Best Picture winner, Anthony Minghella's Der englische Patient (1996), in which he starred with Kristin Scott Thomas. He also received BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations, as well as two Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Award nominations, one for Best Actor and another shared with the film's ensemble cast.\n\nSince then, Fiennes has been in a number of notable films, including Strange Days (1995), Oscar und Lucinda (1997), the animated Der Prinz von √Ñgypten (1998), Istv√°n Szab√≥'s Sunshine - Ein Hauch von Sonnenschein (1999), Neil Jordan-directed films Das Ende einer Aff√§re (1999) and Der Dieb von Monte Carlo (2002), Roter Drache (2002), Manhattan Love Story (2002), Der ewige G√§rtner (2005), Br√ºgge sehen... und sterben?

His nephew, Hero Fiennes Tiffin played Tom Riddle, the young Lord Voldemort, in Harry Potter und der Halbblutprinz (2009). Ralph also appears in the James Bond series, in which he has played M, starting with the 2012 film Skyfall (2012).\n\nIn 2011, Fiennes made his directorial debut with his film adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy political thriller Coriolanus (2011), in which he also played the title character, opposite Gerard Butler and Vanessa Redgrave. Fiennes has won a Tony Award for playing Prince Hamlet on Broadway.\n\nIn 2015, Fiennes played a music producer in Luca Guadagnino's A Bigger Splash (2015), starring opposite Tilda Swinton and Matthias Schoenaerts, and in 2016, Fiennes starred in Joel and Ethan Coen's Hail, Caesar! (2016).\n\nSince 1999, Fiennes has served as an ambassador for UNICEF UK.\n\nFilm and stage actor and theater director Philip Seymour Hoffman was born in the Rochester, New York, suburb of Fairport to Marilyn (Loucks), a lawyer and judge, and Gordon Stowell Hoffman, a Xerox employee, and was mostly of German, Irish, English and Dutch ancestry. After becoming involved in high school theatrics, he attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, graduating with a B.F.A. degree in Drama in 1989.\n\nHe made his feature film debut in the indie production Kreuzfahrt vor Manhattan (1991) as Phil Hoffman, and his first role in a major release came the next year in My New Gun (1992). While he had supporting roles in some other major productions like Der Duft der Frauen (1992) and Twister (1996), his breakthrough role came in Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights (1997).\n\nHe quickly became an icon of indie cinema, establishing a reputation as one of the screen's finest actors, in a variety of supporting and second leads in indie and major features, including Todd Solondz's Happiness (1998), Makellos (1999), Der talentierte Mr. Ripley (1999), Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia (1999), Almost Famous - Fast ber√ºhmt (2000) and State and Main (2000). He also appeared in supporting roles in such mainstream, big-budget features as Roter Drache (2002), Unterwegs nach Cold Mountain (2003) and Mission: Impossible III (2006).\n\nHoffman was also quite active on the stage. On Broadway, he has earned two Tony nominations, as Best Actor (Play) in 2000 for a revival of Sam Shepard's \"True West\" and as Best Actor (Featured Role - Play) in 2003 for a revival of Eugene O'Neill (I)'s \"Long Day's Journey into Night.\" His other acting credits in the New York theater include \"The Seagull\" (directed by Mike Nichols for The New York Shakespeare Festival), \"Defying Gravity,\" \"The Merchant of Venice\" (directed by Peter Sellars), \"Shopping and F*@%ing\" and \"The Author's Voice\" (Drama Desk nomination).\n\nHe was the Co-Artistic Director of the LAByrinth Theater Company in New York, for which he directed \"Our Lady of 121st Street\" by Stephen Adly Guirgis. He also directed \"In Arabia, We'd All Be Kings\" and \"Jesus Hopped the A Train\" by Guirgis for LAByrinth, and \"The Glory of Living\" by Rebecca Gilman at the Manhattan Class Company.\n\nHoffman consolidated his reputation as one of the finest actors under the age of 40 with his turn in the title role of Capote (2005), for which he won the Los Angeles Film Critics Award as Best Actor. In 2006, he was awarded the Best Actor Oscar for the same role.\n\nOn February 2, 2014, Philip Seymour Hoffman was found dead in an apartment in Greenwich village, New York. Investigators found Hoffman with a syringe in his arm and two open envelopes of heroin next to him. Mr. Hoffman was long known to struggle with addiction. In 2006, he said in an interview with \"60 Minutes\" that he had given up drugs and alcohol many years earlier, when he was age 22. In 2013, he checked into a rehabilitation program for about 10 days after a reliance on prescription pills resulted in his briefly turning again to heroin.\n\nWhen hunky, twenty-year-old heart-throb Heath Ledger first came to the attention of the public in 1999, it was all too easy to tag him as a \"pretty boy\" and an actor of little depth. He spent several years trying desperately to sway this image, but this was a double-edged sword. His work comprised nineteen films, including 10 Dinge, die ich an Dir hasse (1999), Der Patriot (2000), Ritter aus Leidenschaft (2001), Monster's Ball (2001), Gesetzlos - Die Geschichte des Ned Kelly (2003), Brothers Grimm (2005), Dogtown Boys (2005), Brokeback Mountain (2005), Casanova (2005), Candy - Reise der Engel (2006), I'm Not There (2007), The Dark Knight (2008) and Das Kabinett des Doktor Parnassus (2009). He also produced and directed music videos and aspired to be a film director.\n\nHeath Ledger was born on the fourth of April 1979, in Perth, Western Australia, to Sally (Ramshaw), a teacher of French, and Kim Ledger, a mining engineer who also raced cars. His ancestry was Scottish, English, Irish, and Sephardi Jewish. As the story goes, in junior high school it was compulsory to take one of two electives, either cooking or drama. As Heath could not see himself in a cooking class he tried his hand at drama. Heath was talented, however the rest of the class did not acknowledge his talent. When he was seventeen he and a friend decided to pack up, leave school, take a car and rough it to Sydney. Heath believed Sydney to be the place where dreams were made or, at least, where actors could possibly get their big break. Upon arriving in Sydney with a purported sixty-nine cents to his name, Heath tried everything to get a break.\n\nHis first real acting job came in a low-budget movie called Blackrock (1997), a largely unimpressive clich√©; an adolescent angst film about one boy's struggle when he learns his best mate raped a girl. He only had a very small role in the film. After that small role Heath auditioned for a role in a T.V. show called Sweat (1996) about a group of young Olympic hopefuls. He was offered one of two roles, one as a swimmer, another as a gay cyclist. Heath accepted the latter because he felt to really stand out as an actor one had to accept unique roles that stood out from the bunch. It got him small notice, but unfortunately the show was quickly axed, forcing him to look for other roles. He was in Home and Away (1988) for a very short period, in which he played a surfer who falls in love with one of the girls of Summer Bay. Then came his very brief role in P.C. - Ein Genie auf vier Pfoten (1997), a film which existed solely to cash in on guitar prodigy Nathan Cavaleri's brief moment of fame, where he was the hottest thing in Australia. Heath played a student in the film, involved in a stage production of a Shakespeare play, in which he played \"Oberon\". A very brief role, this offered him a small paycheck but did nothing to advance his career. Then came Two Hands (1999). He went to the U.S. trying to audition for film roles, showcasing his brief role in Conor, der Kelte (1997) opposite then unknown Vera Farmiga.\n\nThen Australian director Gregor Jordan auditioned him for the lead in Two Hands (1999), which he got. An in your face Aussie crime thriller, Two Hands (1999) was outstanding and helped him secure a role in 10 Dinge, die ich an Dir hasse (1999). After that, it seemed Heath was being typecast as a young hunk, which he did not like, so he accepted a role in a very serious war drama Der Patriot (2000).\n\nWhat followed was a stark inconsistency of roles, Ledger accepting virtually every single character role, anything to avoid being typecast. Some met with praise, like his short role in Monster's Ball (2001), but his version of Gesetzlos - Die Geschichte des Ned Kelly (2003) was an absolute flop, which led distributors hesitant to even release it outside Australia. Heath finally had deserved success with his role in Brokeback Mountain (2005). For his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar in in the film, Ledger won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor and Best International Actor from the Australian Film Institute, and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and for the Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\nLedger was found dead on January 22, 2008 in his apartment in the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo, with a bottle of prescription sleeping pills near-by. It was concluded weeks later that he died of an accidental overdose of prescription drugs that included pain-killers, sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication. His death occurred during editing of The Dark Knight (2008) and in the midst of filming his last role as Tony in Das Kabinett des Doktor Parnassus (2009).\n\nPosthumously, he shared the 2007 Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award with the rest of the ensemble cast, the director, and the casting director for the film I'm Not There (2007), which was inspired by the life and songs of American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. In the film, Ledger portrayed a fictional actor named Robbie Clark, one of six characters embodying aspects of Dylan's life and persona.\n\nA few months before his death, Ledger had finished filming his performance as the Joker in 'The Dark Knight (2008). His untimely death cast a somber shadow over the subsequent promotion of the $185 million Batman production. Ledger received more than thirty posthumous accolades for his critically acclaimed performance as the Joker, the psychopathic clown prince of crime, in the film, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a Best Actor International Award at the 2008 Australian Film Institute Awards (for which he is the second actor to win an acting award posthumously after Peter Finch who won an Oscar for Network (Best Actor 1977)), the 2008 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor, the 2009 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture, and the 2009 BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nAmerican actor, filmmaker and activist Edward Harrison Norton was born on August 18, 1969, in Boston, Massachusetts, and was raised in Columbia, Maryland.\n\nHis mother, Lydia Robinson \"Robin\" (Rouse), was a foundation executive and teacher of English, and a daughter of famed real estate developer James Rouse, who developed Columbia, MD; she passed away of brain cancer on March 6, 1997. His father, Edward Mower Norton, was an environmental lawyer and conservationist, who works for the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Edward has two younger siblings, James and Molly.\n\nFrom the age of five onward, the Yale graduate (majoring in history) was interested in acting. At the age of eight, he would ask his drama teacher what his motivation in a scene was. He attended theater schools throughout his life, and eventually managed to find work on stage in New York as a member of the Signature players, who produced the works of playwright and director Edward Albee. Around the time when he was appearing in Albee's Fragments, in Hollywood, they were looking for a young actor to star opposite Richard Gere in a new courtroom thriller, Zwielicht (1996). The role was offered to Leonardo DiCaprio but he turned it down. Gere was on the verge of walking away from the project, fed up with the wait for a young star to be found, when Edward auditioned and won the role over 2000 other hopefuls. Before the film was even released, his test screenings for the part were causing a Hollywood sensation, and he was soon offered roles in Woody Allen's Alle sagen: I love you (1996) and Larry Flynt - Die nackte Wahrheit (1996). Edward won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Zwielicht (1996). In 1998, Norton gained 30 pounds of muscle and transformed his look into that of a monstrous skinhead for his role as a violent white supremacist in American History X (1998). This performance earned him his second Oscar nomination, this time for Best Actor.\n\nHe received his third Oscar nomination, for Best Supporting Actor, for his work in Birdman oder (Die unverhoffte Macht der Ahnungslosigkeit) (2014).

Law has been nominated for two Academy Awards and continues to build a prolific body of work that spans from early successes such as Gattaca (1997) and Der talentierte Mr. Ripley (1999) to more recent turns as Dr. John Watson in Sherlock Holmes (2009) and Sherlock Holmes - Spiel im Schatten (2011), as Hugo's father in Hugo Cabret (2011) and in the titular role in Dom Hemingway (2013).\n\nDavid Jude Law was born on December 29, 1972 in Lewisham, London, England, to Margaret Anne (Heyworth) and Peter Robert Law, both of whom taught at comprehensive schools; his father later became a headmaster. Law has said that he was named after both the book Jude the Obscure and the song Hey Jude.\n\nIn 1992, Jude began his stage career. He starred in many plays throughout London, and was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award of \"Outstanding Newcomer\" After doing the play \"Indiscretions\" in London, he moved and did it again on Broadway. This time, he was alongside Kathleen Turner. He then received a Tony Nomination for \"Outstanding Supporting Actor\". He was then rewarded the Theatre World Award. After Broadway, Jude started on the big screen, in many independent films. His first big-named movie was Gattaca (1997), with Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke. He also had a good role in Mitternacht im Garten von Gut und B√∂se (1997). Jude's latest rise to fame has been because of Der talentierte Mr. Ripley (1999), in which he plays Matt Damon's obsession. The film did very well at the box office, and critics loved Jude's acting.\n\nFollowing the success of Gattaca (1997) and Der talentierte Mr. Ripley (1999), Law's feature film career continued to gain momentum throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s with roles in such films as Duell: Enemy at the Gates (2001), Road to Perdition (2002), I Heart Huckabees (2004), Aviator (2004) and many others. Law is one of three actors, along with Colin Farrell and Johnny Depp, to take over acting responsibilities in the Terry Gilliam project Das Kabinett des Doktor Parnassus (2009) following Heath Ledger's death.\n\nLaw is a partner in the production company \"Natural Nylon\".

He was raised in Florida. He dropped out of school when he was 15, and fronted a series of music-garage bands, including one named 'The Kids'. When he married Lori A. Depp, he took a job as a ballpoint-pen salesman to support himself and his wife. A visit to Los Angeles, California, with his wife, however, happened to be a blessing in disguise, when he met up with actor Nicolas Cage, who advised him to turn to acting, which culminated in Depp's film debut in the low-budget horror film, Nightmare - M√∂rderische Tr√§ume (1984), where he played a teenager who falls prey to dream-stalking demon Freddy Krueger.\n\nIn 1987 he shot to stardom when he replaced Jeff Yagher in the role of undercover cop Tommy Hanson in the popular TV series 21 Jump Street: Tatort Klassenzimmer (1987). In 1990, after numerous roles in teen-oriented films, his first of a handful of great collaborations with director Tim Burton came about when Depp played the title role in Edward mit den Scherenh√§nden (1990). Following the film's success, Depp carved a niche for himself as a serious, somewhat dark, idiosyncratic performer, consistently selecting roles that surprised critics and audiences alike. He continued to gain critical acclaim and increasing popularity by appearing in many features before re-joining with Burton in the lead role of Ed Wood (1994). In 1997 he played an undercover FBI agent in the fact-based film Donnie Brasco (1997), opposite Al Pacino; in 1998 he appeared in Angst und Schrecken in Las Vegas (1998), directed by Terry Gilliam; and then, in 1999, he appeared in the sci-fi/horror film The Astronaut's Wife - Das B√∂se hat ein neues Gesicht (1999). The same year he teamed up again with Burton in Sleepy Hollow (1999), brilliantly portraying Ichabod Crane.\n\nDepp has played many characters in his career, including another fact-based one, Insp. Fred Abberline in From Hell (2001). He stole the show from screen greats such as Antonio Banderas in the finale to Robert Rodriguez's \"mariachi\" trilogy, Irgendwann in Mexico (2003). In that same year he starred in the marvelous family blockbuster Fluch der Karibik (2003), playing a character that only the likes of Depp could pull off: the charming, conniving and roguish Capt. Jack Sparrow. The film's enormous success has opened several doors for his career and included an Oscar nomination. He appeared as the central character in the Stephen King-based movie, Das geheime Fenster (2004); as the kind-hearted novelist James Barrie in the factually-based Wenn Tr√§ume fliegen lernen (2004), where he co-starred with Kate Winslet; and Rochester in the British film, The Libertine - Sex, Drugs & Rococo (2004). Depp collaborated again with Burton in a screen adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel, Charlie und die Schokoladenfabrik (2005), and later in Alice im Wunderland (2010) and Dark Shadows (2012).\n\nOff-screen, Depp has dated several female celebrities, and has been engaged to Sherilyn Fenn, Jennifer Grey, Winona Ryder and Kate Moss. He was married to Lori Anne Allison in 1983, but divorced her in 1985. Depp has two children with his former long-time partner, French singer/actress Vanessa Paradis: Lily-Rose Melody, born in 1999 and John Christopher \"Jack\" III, born in 2002. He married actress/producer Amber Heard in 2015, divorcing a few years later."
