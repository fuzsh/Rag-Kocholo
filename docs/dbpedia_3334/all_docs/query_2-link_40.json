        "text": "Naidu: from India to California on a vine\n\nJune 17, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nWe are always inspired by people who leave established careers to pursue the art of making wine. On one hand, it seems reckless, but on the other hand it is a gutsy leap of faith that a better life awaits you. And sometimes it does.\n\nThe reasons always vary. We know of wealthy people who just wanted their friends to see their name on a label or they wanted a house that overlooked a vineyard. Lofty, ego-driven goals without a good business plan are doomed to fail. But, for those who give up a solid career to dedicate themselves to becoming involved in making a wine as well as making a profit persevere through hard work and diligence.\n\nSuch is the case with Raghni Naidu, who grew up in Punjab, India. Vineyards are very scarce in India, so it’s improbable that she would make this a business. However, she was influenced by her mother who had an adventurous spirit for culinary experiences from around the world.\n\n“My mother was passionate about global cuisine,” Naidu told us in a recent phone interview. “There were so many basic things that weren’t a part of the Indian diet. She traveled and brought back seeds for vegetables she grew and shared with family and friends.”\n\nWhen her brother pursued a hospitality degree in Australia, he brought home wines to share with the family and that’s where her interest in wine began. She moved with her husband to California in 2006 and the landscape quickly changed as those memories around the family dinner table flooded back. After some travel to southern France, Naidu turned her dreams to winemaking.\n\nIn 2018 she bought nearly 5 acres of an existing pinot noir vineyard close to Sebastopol, and began to fulfill her dream with hard work and a commitment to quality. Today, Naidu wines are in a three-star Michelin restaurant and are featured in many Indian restaurants.\n\nHer new venture wasn’t without challenge. The COVID-19 pandemic brought operations to a near standstill. Then came the Sonoma Glass Fire in 2020 when she dropped fruit instead of sacrificing quality. But she was determined.\n\n“I wanted to build a legacy for my children by making wines that are authentic and representing who I am,” she said.\n\nHer story as the only Indian-born female winemaker and owner has served as inspiration to other women, particularly among minorities who see her commitment as a path that can be followed.\n\nNaidu kept the original pinot noir vines, but looked to other grapes to expand her portfolio – viognier, cabernet franc, grenache blanc and chardonnay. She purchased grapes from other producers in Sonoma and Russian River Valley. She grew production from 75 cases in 2020 to 2,000 cases this year without reducing quality.\n\nShe admitted it was a “huge risk” to start Naidu in such a competitive environment but always remained confident of success. Like a vine struggles to get through hardpan and rock, a good producer can blossom into something great under duress.\n\n“Stress often brings out the best in people. There is likeness in life and struggle,” she said.\n\nHere are several of her wines we enjoyed:\n\nNaidu Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir 2021 ($75). Using the two original vineyard clones, the pinot noir is aged in French oak barrels for 15 months to give it some nice texture and complexity. Raspberry and cherry flavors abound with hints of dried rosemary and spice.\n\nNaidu Catie’s Corner Vineyard Russian River Valley Chardonnay 2022 ($50). This single-vineyard chardonnay gets limited malolatic fermentation to preserve the acidity and bright fruit character. Ripe melon notes highlight a food-friendly wine.\n\nNaidu Catie’s Corner Vineyard Russian River Valley Viognier 2022 ($50). Viognier is a challenge because it more about aromatics than flavor, but this version has both. Generous aromas of stone fruit followed by tropical fruit flavors and a dash of clove.\n\nNaidu Cassata Vineyard Sonoma Valley Cabernet Franc 2022 ($65). Cabernet franc also can be one-dimensional and commonly plays a supporting role in red blends. But in the right soil and climate, it can blossom into something special. We enjoyed the blackberry, blueberry and cassis notes.\n\nRhys\n\nWe recently tasted a series of pinot noirs and chardonnays from Rhys Vineyards, an extraordinary producer that is sourcing grapes throughout the Santa Cruz Mountains and Mendocino County under the direction of founder Kevin Harvey.\n\nWhat was remarkable in our tasting is that these wines don’t follow the over-extracted, over-oaked, over-ripe style that has been a roadmap for many California producers in the past. The chardonnays are crisp and balanced; the pinot noirs are subtle and beguiling, much like a burgundy.\n\nHarvey immersed himself in fine wine, viticulture, enology and geology before growing pinot noir in his backyard near the border of the Santa Cruz Mountains in 1995. Eventually, he expanded his vineyard and the rest is history, as they say. Instead of buying existing vineyards, he believed it was best to plant vineyards from scratch. He planted seven small estate vineyards.\n\nIn particular, we liked the Rhys Mt. Pajaro Vineyard Santa Cruz Mountain Chardonnay 2021 ($95). The vineyard is perched at 900 feet a few miles from Monterey Bay. The proximity to ocean breezes cools the grapes at night and lets them mature more evenly. We liked the citrus and lemon meringue notes in this balanced wine.\n\nThe 2021 pinot noir from this vineyard is equally stellar with young and fresh black cherry and raspberry fruit flavors.\n\nRhys also draws grapes from the Anderson Valley. Its’ Bearwallow Vineyard Pinot Noir ($105) is an extraordinary expression of this grape variety with aging potential. Full body with red fruit and earthy character.\n\nAlthough expensive, the chardonnay and pinot noirs from the Horseshoe Vineyard in the Santa Cruz Mountains show intensity. The chardonnay has an intriguing honeysuckle component and a full body.\n\nWine picks\n\nJ. Lohr Syrah Estates South Ridge Syrah 2022 ($15). You can’t beat the price of this juicy and spicy wine with cherry notes.\n\nGoosecross A Rose for Lucy 2023 ($39). This enjoyable Carneros rose made from pinot noir has strawberry and raspberry notes with a bit of citrus and balanced acidity.\n\nTenuta Calimaia Vino Nobile di Montepulciano 2019 ($25). From Frescobaldi, this beautiful sangiovese is well worth every penny. Generous red fruit aromas with dried herbs are followed by cherry flavors with a hint of spice. Very young and lively on the palate, it is a great match to grilled foods.\n\nIt’s hot — break out those roses\n\nJune 10, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nIt has been years since rosé finally got a good grip on consumer wallets. Once the exclusive product of southern France and then the darling of the white zinfandel craze of the 1980s, rosé has finally earned a respectable place at the table.\n\nBut despite its durability on the market, it has become a victim of its own success. Today nearly every producer in every country makes rosé from just about every grape variety. So, if you can find rosés from Spanish tempranillo, California pinot noir, Italian corvina or Argentine malbec, what is the definition of rosé?\n\nWe first associate rosé with southern France, a region where rosé relies on a handful of grapes cultivated for generations of farmers whose sole goal is to make rosé. It is here where producers have been perfecting the summer quaff for centuries. Many of them, such as Domaine Ott, make nothing but rosé. While many producers use whatever grape varieties are in their vineyards, their products contribute to what some French producers derisively have called a “swimming pool” of rosé. France has its own swimming pool of plonk, but they aren’t as quick to admit it.\n\nEvery year we taste our way through dozens of rosés from every country, and the differences are often remarkable. In the typical rosé, the crushed grapes soak with their skins for only a few hours, which gives the wine its pink hue and simple flavors. Those that have a deeper red color have been left to soak for more than 24 hours. So, any red grape variety will work, but the French varieties give the wine its classic lively red fruit character.\n\nWe think the French have it right by choosing grenache, syrah, cinsault, mourvedre and rolle grapes. These are grapes that perform remarkably well in the heat of Provence and Bandol. These rosés – usually a blend of these grape varieties – have the right acidity, color and fresh fruit character. Many even have complexity but they come at a price. Put them alongside other rosés made from different grape varieties and they stand out.\n\nWe’ll write about the rosés from outside France in a future column. For today, feast your eyes on these exceptional rosés from southern France:\n\nDomaine Ott Chateau de Selle Rosé 2022 ($68). This exquisite and layered rose leans on grenache and cinsault with a little syrah and mourvedre thrown in to keep it interesting. It opens with citrus, vanilla and minerality. White peach and lemon flavors round off a beautiful, intense rosé. Two years ago we visited with Jean-Francois Ott at his Provence tasting room and saw his dedication to making the best rosé in the world.\n\nChateau de Fabregues Costieres de Nimes 2022 ($17). A blend of syrah and grenache, this rosé from southern France has lively acidity, medium body and understated raspberry, apple and white peach notes.\n\nLEOS Cuvee Augusta L’Isle-sur-la-Sorgue 2023 ($19). The Perrin family has teamed up with Nicolas Jaboulet – another great winemaking family – to produce this unique rosé that adds bourboulenc and vermentino to grenache. The result is a highly floral rosé with good concentration and lots of fresh strawberry fruit. This was one of our favorites of the year.\n\nChateau La Mascaronne Cotes de Provence Rosé 2022 ($30). Fresh strawberry and peach notes with a good dose of citrus quickly develop in this bright and tantalizing blend of cinsault, grenache, syrah and rolle grape varieties.\n\nM. Chapoutier Belleruche Cotes-du-Rhone Rosé 2023 ($18). One of our perennial favorites, this classic blend of grenache, syrah and cinsault is an expressive display of stone fruit and citrus notes with a hint of anise.\n\nMinuty Prestige Cotes de Provence Rosé 2023 ($25). Twenty-five years ago, producers Jean-Etienne and Francois Matton wanted to produce a signature wine to a wider audience with a reasonable price. We have enjoyed it for years. Strawberry and raspberry notes with a dash of stone fruit and citrus come from this blend of grenache, syrah, rolle and cinsault.\n\nChateau Minuty Rosé et OR 2023 ($35). Lots of fresh citrus and red fruit notes with a dash of mineral. The blend is grenache (80 percent), syrah, cinsault and tibouren.\n\nMathilde Chapoutier Selection ORSURO Cotes de Provence 2023 ($21). This Rhone Valley producer is really into rosés with three selections. This one is a blend of primarily grenache noir and syrah with a bit of cinsault, cabernet sauvignon, clairette and rolle to round out a broad palate of flavors.\n\nChateau d’Escalans Whispering Angel Rosé 2023 ($18). This fav of many consumers, Whispering Angel was an overnight success. It is found on restaurant wine lists and at wine warehouses for a lot less. From Provence, it is semi-dry which may be its reason for success. Smooth with grapefruit and citrus notes and a dash of clove.\n\nMiraval Cotes de Provence Rosé 2023 ($23). The subject of an ugly divorce between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, this wine is successful despite the acrimony between the Hollywood couple. It is a classic blend of cinsault, grenache, syrah and rolle. We always have this one sitting in our refrig, begging for a plate of cheese. Raspberry and citrus notes with lively acidity and a dash of orange peel and minerality.\n\nEsprit Gassier Cotes de Provence Rosé 2023 ($20). Grenache, cinsault, syrah and rolle combine to make a delicately appointed rosé with peach notes.\n\nChateau La Coste Vin de Provence Rosé 2023 ($25). There is some nice complexity in this classic blend of grenache, syrah, cinsault and cabernet sauvignon. Red fruit with a dash of peach and citrus.\n\nFamille Perrin Cotes du Rhone Reserve 2022 ($15). The family behind Chateau Beaucastel has been making another tier of wines for a long time – just waiting to be discovered. This blend of cinsault, mourvedre, grenache and syrah has rasberry notes with crisp acidity.\n\nHecht & Bannier Provence 2023 ($14). Two friends formed this company in 2002 and have been making some terrific rosés since. This one from the Languedoc has strawberry notes and a great mouthfeel.\n\nWine picks\n\nClockwise Sauvignon Blanc Russian River Valley 2023 ($30). Steve MacRostie, who makes wine under his family name, and winemaker Heidi Bridenhagen, launched this brand a decade ago as a playground for new varieties and regions. This simple and aromatic sauvignon blanc is a great sipper on a summer afternoon. Citrus, grapefruit and freshly mown grass dominate. We look forward to what else they produce.\n\nLucia by Pisoni Soberanes Vineyard Chardonnay 2022 ($55). Jeff and Mark Pisoni have a series of chardonnays and pinot noirs that continue to impress us. This one has dense and effusive stone fruit and apple aromas with velvet pear flavors and a distinctive hint of minerality. We also like the pure and rounder estate cuvee chardonnay that sources its fruit from Soberanes and Pisoni vineyards.\n\nSome very special wines for dad\n\nJune 1, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nEach year we examine some of the best red wines from Napa Valley as suggestions for Father’s Day. We know these are very expensive, but we theorize that this is a very special occasion that calls for a very special wine. Perhaps you can split the cost with your siblings to make it more affordable. Just don’t expect him to share it with you – June 16 is his day.\n\nWe also offer some good alternatives if these prices are out of range. Here are our top 10 cabernet sauvignons for Father’s Day:\n\nChappellet Hideaway Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($175). Hideaway was formerly planted to chenin blanc, but in 2007 the producer planted six blocks of cabernet sauvignon on this secluded 13-acre plot. Ever since then, this mountain wine has been a homerun. Said winemaker Phillip Titus, “When grown the correct way in the right soils, mountain cabernet gives you more of almost everything – complexity, more power and more tannins.” This is an immense wine with concentrated black fruit notes and hints of herbs and pepper.\n\nFlora Springs Napa Valley Trilogy 2021 ($100). The family sold this historic St. Helena winery in 2019, but kept 20 acres of prime vineyards to make its own wine with a greater interest in reducing back production nearly in half. They also revitalized 20 acres in its prized Komes Ranch Vineyard in Ruthford, the primary source for this beautiful wine. This Trilogy -- a blend of cabernet sauvignon, petit verdot and malbec -- continues a label that is nearly 40 years old. It has concentrated black fruit flavors with hints of mint, coffee and cola.\n\nTurnbull Amoenus Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($145). Most of the vineyards used by this respectable Napa Valley producer are from the Oakville AVA, but the Amoenus Vineyard is on the rolling hills of Calistoga. Floral and spicy aromas hand off to a beautiful tapestry of ripe blackberry and cherry flavors that are enveloped by soft, fine tannins.\n\nBeringer Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon 2020 ($175). We have tasted enough of Beringer’s top marquee wine that are 10-15 years old to know that these wines can age – just like dad. Always big and concentrated, the 2020 has floral and blueberry aromas, classic dark cherry, plum and currant fruit flavors, hints of vanilla and spice, and plenty of tannins to complement that grilled steak.\n\nBeaulieu Vineyards Georges de Latour Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon 2020 ($160). BV’s private reserve was a collector’s prize as soon as it was first released in 1940. We have tasted different vintages of this wine since the 1980s and enjoyed every one of them, including some that have been decades old. It is dense, complex and full of that great Napa Valley fruit. Black cherry and plum notes dominate the palate experience.\n\nDouble Diamond Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($90). This is a colossal but approachable wine from the Schrader house. Aggressive black fruit and cassis aromas with plum and black cherry flavors, hints of tea, earth and vanilla.\n\nAcumen Mountainside Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($85). This Napa Valley producer has a stunning array of cabernet sauvignons ranging from this one to its dense and opulent PEAK Edcora Vineyard. Maybe it’s had to call the Mountainside a “bargain,” but it stands tall with anything else in this ranking. It is more expressive than the PEAK cousins, which have a classic style reminiscent of those old-style, age-worthy cabernets from the 1970s. The Mountainside has a fruit-forward personality with merlot and malbec to round off the tannins. Ripe plum mingles with chocolate and mocha on the palate. Floral, violet aromas add to the black cherry notes.\n\nEhlers Estate Jean Leducq Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($160). Named for French entrepeneurs and philantropists Jean and Sylvia Leducq, this top-shelf wine from St. Helena is an iron fist in a velvet glove. Made only in the best vintages, it will be drinking nicely well into the future, but can be enjoyed now. We tasted it alongside the more concentrated 1886 Cabernet Sauvignon ($120) from the same vintage. The 1886 date is when the winery was founded by Bernard Ehlers. It was purchased by the Leducq Charitable Trust in 1996.\n\nSullivan Coeur de Vigne Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($100). This tribute to Sullivan Rutherford Estate’s historic location is a colossal wine with classic Napa Valley character. A blend of cabernet sauvignon (80 percent), merlot and petit verdot, it utilizes the personality of each grape variety to achieve a well-structured, balanced wine with blackberry, black cherry and blueberry flavors. This wine can be enjoyed now, which means dad doesn’t have to get any older to enjoy it.\n\nPriest Ranch Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($60). Generous red cherry aromas, flavors of dark fruity, licorice and mocha.\n\nLess expensive alternative wines:\n\nHahn Family Wines California Cabernet Sauvignon 2022 ($16). Always a decent value, this expressive wine has cherry aromas and a hint of leather with ripe black fruit flavors.\n\nTrue Myth Paso Robles Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($24). This inexpensive cabernet sauvignon from California is a decent wine for everyday drinking. Easy, quaffable with smooth ripe red fruit.\n\nTenuta Luce Lucente 2021 ($29). One of our favorite wines year after year, this super-Tuscan blend combines merlot with the local sangiovese to present a delicious, round and ripe berry flavored wine that would go with ribs, burgers and other grilled meat.\n\nDomaine Bousquet Cabernet Sauvignon 2022 ($13). For the price, you get a lot of juicy and ripe red berry flavors and supple tannins to make this a decent match with grilled beef. This Argentine producer is making some the best values on the market today.\n\nQuerciabella Chianti Classico DOCG 2019 ($32). A very complete Tuscan red wine. Plum and dried cherry elements present in a smooth soft tannin wine. Good now but can age a few years.\n\nWine picks\n\nQuinta da Fonte Souto Branco White 2022 ($27). This wine from the Alentejo region of Portugal has Symington’s stamp of quality. Made mostly from arinto grapes, the wine benefits from being fermented and stirred on its lees. There is a soft texture and extracted fruit that may otherwise have been lost. Good complexity.\n\nJ. de Villebois Sancerre Rosé 2023 ($30). Lots of strawberry and raspberry notes in this semi-dry rosé from Sancerre.\n\nGarofoli Podium Anniversario Verdiccho dei Castlli di Jesi 2021 ($30). From Italy’s Marche region, this pleasant and quaffable verdiccho has elegant citrus notes.\n\nFire up that grill and enjoy a glass of wine\n\nMay 27, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nNothing excites the senses more than a Sunday afternoon behind the grill. Many people enjoy year-round grilling temperatures, but others are trapped indoors and too timid to brave the elements for a grilled steak. But with Memorial Day behind us, barbecue season is officially under way.\n\nA sizzling burger over fire puts us in a summer mood. It is the ideal time to invite friends and family over to the house for an outdoor meal. Serve a rosé or a prosecco as you fire up the grill and invite guests to help plate the meal.\n\nWhile stews and chili are the fare for winter meals, lighter fare such as fish and grilled vegetables make more sense in warmer months. The goal is to keep it simple and fresh.\n\nChoosing a wine to go with your entree shifts in warmer months just as much as the food. Cabernet sauvignon is good for beef and lamb, but most grilled foods call for lighter wines. A ketchup-based sauce on that pulled pork or ribs calls for something fruity – merlot, syrah, and especially zinfandel. Keep it simple if burgers are the choice: beaujolais, valpollicella, or chianti\n\nAn elegant dinner of duck, salmon or tuna allows you to explore a serious pinot noir. Although often pricey, pinot noir has the heft to complement many entrees with red-based sauces. Ketchup and tomatoes are usually a part of barbecue sauces, so lighter red wines do well.\n\nWhite fish opens the door to many choices, chardonnay being our favorite. Any sauce with citrus as a base calls for sauvignon blanc or pinot gris.\n\nWe like rosé with grilled chicken because it is so fruity and adaptable to many sauces. Sauvignon blanc works well here, too, but don’t forget the white wines from Portugal, Italy and Spain for adventure and variety. Try a vinho verde from Portugal, an albarino or verdejo from Spain, or soave or gavi from Italy. Any of these are great sipping wines but can join a plate of fresh vegetables or cheese.\n\nHere are 12 suggested wines – many good values -- to officially launch barbecue season:\n\nDomaine Bousquet Premium Organic Malbec 2022 ($13). Using fruit from the Uco Valley, this malbec has the right amount of juiciness to complement marbled beef and other grilled fare. Red berry aromas and soft tannins make it as easy drink. This producer makes some of the best value-driven wines. Great with beef.\n\nRombauer California Zinfandel 2021 ($38). The dash of petite sirah in this wine gives it more heft and color. Juicy and ripe blackberry notes with a dollop of clove and vanilla. Think ribs, burgers and pizza.\n\nDomaine Bousquet Cabernet Sauvignon 2022 ($13). For the price, you get a lot of juicy and ripe red berry flavors and supple tannins to make this a decent match with grilled beef. Tasted blind, this wine has gotten a lot of accolades in our circle.\n\nLyric Monterey County Pinot Noir 2022 ($20). We thought it was impossible to find a good pinot noir under $50, but this one proves us wrong. Bright red berry flavors, medium body and a smooth finish. It would do well alongside grilled veggies and simple entrees such as burgers, salmon and pork.\n\nOrin Swift Cellars Abstract 2022 ($45). This beautiful blend of grenache, syrah and petite syrah is an ideal match with almost any grilled meat or barbecue sauce.\n\nOrin Swift 8 Years in the Desert 2022 ($53). Ripe tannins and oodles of sweet blackberries and spice make this a delicious yet serious wine to pair with beef.\n\nJ. Lohr Estates South Ridge Syrah 2022 ($15). Ripe blackberry compote with notes of black cherries and spice, this syrah has a seductive mouthfeel. Perfect for pasta, meats, ribs and pizza.\n\nJ. Lohr Estates Seven Oaks Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($17). Another great value from J. Lohr, this wine has plum, black currant and cassis notes.\n\nQuinta do Vesuvio Comboio do Vesuvio DOC 2020 ($25). Some of the best values in wine today come from Portugal. The train on the label recognizes the track that runs alongside this vineyard. Its constant rumble obviously doesn’t disturb the vines. It is an almost equal share of touriga franca, touriga nacional and tinta roriz grapes. It is not aged in oak, which makes this fruit-forward quaff easy to drink alongside everyday fare. Youthful strawberry aromas with ripe plum and cherry flavors with a hint of clove and ripe tannins. This is a versatile wine that would do well with meats, pasta, tuna and just by itself.\n\nMarco Felluga Mongris Collo Pinot Grigio DOC 022 ($21). With grapes grown in mineral-rich but poor soils in the Collio region of Italy, this pinot gris has bright and fresh floral aromas with apple and pear flavors. Think fish, poultry and aperitif.\n\nBerona Crianza 2019 ($15). We have seen this wine on many restaurant lists and it is a good value. Bright and simple red berry notes with a dash of tobacco and vanilla.\n\nTenuta Whitaker Mozia Grillo Sicilia DOC 2022 ($25). We like grillo as an alternative to pinot grigio and even chardonnay. It has good acidity, pure fruit character with stone fruit and apple notes accented with minerality.\n\nWine picks\n\nInama Carmenere Piu IGT 2021 ($22). A blend of carmenere and merlot, this wine from the Veneto region of northeastern Italy has a broad range of red and dark fruit flavors, medium body. It is easy to drink alongside a nice steak.\n\nChappellet Signature Chenin Blanc 2023 ($75). We don’t think we have ever tasted a California chenin blanc this good. This site on Pritchard Hill has been producing chenin blanc before Donn and Molly Chappellet purchased the property the late 1960s and has become an institution as several winemakers have passed through here. Delicious is a word that doesn’t do it justice. Fermented in French oak barrels and stainless-steel tanks, it has a strong personality with effusive pear and apple aromas and melon, citrus flavors.\n\nPapapietro Perry Russian River Valley Pinot Noir 2021 ($61). This pinot noir from wind-swept Sonoma Coast exudes hedonistic pleasure. Raspberry and floral aromas are followed by vibrant black cherry and plum flavors.\n\nChoices to celebrate Chardonnay Day\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nMay 26 is World Chardonnay Day, a good time to recognize the most prolific and most prestigious white grape in the world. Considered to have started in France, chardonnay is the grape variety that is the foundation of great burgundies and chablis. Yet, despite its popularity, it is the grape variety to fashionably hate.\n\nNot us.\n\nChardonnay is grown almost in every wine growing region in the world because, unlike pinot noir and riesling, it is a variety that adapts well to most soils and environments. Over the years, styles of chardonnay have come and gone, the most notable of which were the oaky versions from Australia and California. Today, chardonnays undergo various levels of malolatic fermentation, a process that converts malo acid to lactic acid in order to reduce acidity and increase creaminess. This method, used judiciously, has made chardonnay more appealing to consumers than the often tart, acidic sauvignon blanc.\n\nOak barrels in fermentation and aging also have influenced style. A wine with 24 months of oak will be more complex – and more expensive. Oak can add a melange of flavors, including toasted almonds, coconut, vanilla and even butterscotch.\n\nHere are a few California chardonnays we recently liked:\n\nDecoy Limited Sonoma Coast Chardonnay ($30). You get a lot of warm opulence in this chardonnay for the money. Peach and apricot flavors are topped off with an array of aromas starting with lime and ending with spice. Very viscous and enjoyable.\n\nMer Soleil Chardonnay Monterey County Santa Lucia Highlands 2021 ($30). Another winner from the uber-successful Wagner family of Caymus fame. Luscious tropical fruit notes of mango and pineapple with perfectly balanced toasty oak notes. A classic big boned California chardonnay.\n\nGoosecross Napa Valley Chardonnay 2022 ($46). This restrained, balanced and food-friendly chardonnay has everything you want in a chardonnay. Tropical fruit, pear and lemon aromas give way to peach and apple flavors.\n\nBeringer Private Reserve Napa Valley Chardonnay 2022 ($50). One of the best chardonnays we’ve tasted in this group, the Beringer PR is full bodied with luscious tropical fruit flavors and touches of toast, apple and spice. Very long on the finish.\n\nChateau Montelena Napa Valley Chardonnay 2021 ($75). We liked the great balance in this exquisite wine. The fruit is ripe but overly so. There is good acidity and minerality to balance the ripe melon and lemon curd flavors. Broad aromas of apple and stone fruit.\n\nRhys Horseshoe Vineyard Santa Cruz Mountains Chardonnay 2021 ($125). Excellence comes with a price and this is the case here. From the often-overlooked Santa Cruz corner of the world, this elegant wine gets full barrel fermentation for 12 months and an additional 6 months in stainless steel. The oak notes are fleeting and don’t overpower the rich honeysuckle and citrus flavors. This chardonnay will only intensify as it ages, much like the chardonnays from Burgundy, but it pairs well with food now.\n\nMacRostie Sonoma Coast Chardonnay 2022 ($28). This is a great value in this group of extraordinary chardonnays. Sourcing grapes from the Sangiacomo and Ricci vineyards in Carneros, the producer has crafted a wine with effusive citrus aromas, richness and layers of apple and tropical fruit flavors.\n\nJ. Lohr Estates Riverstone Chardonnay 2022 ($14). The producer is celebrating its 50th anniversary and has a brand new look for its popular chardonnay. A blossomed-theme label teases you into a bouquet of apple and spice followed by stone fruit flavors. One of the best values in chardonnay.\n\nTalley Vineyards San Luis Obispo Coast Chardonnay 2022 ($38). Brian Talley led the 2022 effort to make this region an AVA. Having the coolest temperature in California AVAs, the Pacific breezes make it ideal for both chardonnay and pinot noir. We enjoyed it for its unique flavor profile. Lots of apple notes.\n\nBaldacci Family Vineyards Carneros Chardonay 2022 ($55). Apple aromas and tropical fruit flavors with a dash of spice and a soft-mouthfeel. Delicious.\n\nCuvaison Chardonnay Kite Tail Chardonnay 2022 ($70). This luxurious chardonnay from Los Carneros is very impressive. Stone fruit and apple notes are cloaked in elegance and smoothness. A touch of mineral adds to a very expressive and delicious wine.\n\nBenziger Family Winery Chardonnay 2022 ($16). A pioneer in biodynamic farming, Benziger makes a reliable chardonnay for the value price. Ripe pear notes with a creamy finish.\n\nLandmark Damaris Reserve Chardonnay Sonoma Coast 2022 ($50). Landmark, founded by Damaris Deere Ford, is celebrating its 50th anniversary with this redesign label for its top chardonnay. Apricot aromas with pear and white peach flavors accented by spice and oak.\n\nCunat Family Vineyards Mattera Chardonnay 2021 ($36). From the Oak Knoll District of Napa Valley, this well-balanced and creamy chardonnay is from a producer new to us. Lots of stone fruit and citrus notes with a hint of almonds.\n\nWente Morning Fog Chardonnay 2022 ($18). Still one of the best bargains in chardonnay, this mass-produced Wente wine has persistent apple flavors, good acidity and is not over oaked.\n\nAlma Rosa El Jabali Chardonnay 2021 ($33). From the fabulous Sta. Rita Hills area, this wine taps into one of the best vineyards in Santa Barbara. Nice mineral notes.\n\nAustralian chardonnays\n\nPenfolds Bin 311 Chardonnay 2022 ($40). Penfolds uses several regions to source this austere and food-friendly chardonnay. The mineral notes come from Tasmanian grapes. Added are white peach and citrus notes and a dash of almonds.\n\nVasse Felix Margaret River Chardonnay 2021 ($48). We loved this opulent yet elegant chardonnay from one of the most interesting wine-growing regions in Australian. Stone fruit flavors abound under a cloak of minerality, melon and citrus.\n\nHandpicked Regional Selections Yarra Valley Chardonnay 2022 ($25). This chardonnay seemed to have unusual flavors that we found attractive but hard to describe. We definitely spotted peach with maybe a dash of apricot. Soft mouthfeel.\n\nWine picks\n\nBaldacci Proprietary Red Blend Napa Valley 2021 ($70). Merlot comprises 30 percent of this wine, but also in the blend is a good of cabernet sauvignon plus cabernet franc, malbec and petit verdot. The merlot gives the wine a soft landing on the palate. Lots of plum notes with a dash of spice.\n\nOur Daily Cab 2023 ($11). This inexpensive cabernet sauvignon from California is a decent wine for everyday drinking. Easy, quaffable with smooth ripe red fruit.\n\nTruth Myth Paso Robles Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($24). No sulfites and gluten free, this wine has a lot of stuffing for the price. Blue fruit aromas with ripe plum, blackberry flavors with a hint of dark chocolate.\n\nFew of the historic wineries are family owned\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nEver since we have been writing this column, we have witnessed a lot of turn over in winery owners. You want legendary wineries to stay in the families forever, but sadly that’s not always the case. In France and Italy, owners are several generations deep, but not in California where deep-pocketed entrepeneurs who fancy wine dangle big money in front of tired families.\n\nAlthough the majority of Napa Valley wineries are still family owned, many of the icons have changed hands multiple times as offsprings choose not to pursue the passions of previous generations. Whether these changes have led to a drop in quality or just a sense of remorse is up for debate. In our opinion, those classic cabernet sauvignons of the 1980s are not the same today, in part because trends have taken then in new directions and in part because the bottom line has become more important.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the “big four” wineries in Napa arguably were Beaulieu Vineyards, Inglenook, Charles Krug and Louis Martini. Only two of them – Charles Krug and Inglenook – are still family owned, although that is in spite of an acrimonious fight between brothers Robert and Peter Mondavi and a painful restoration of Inglenook by Francis Ford Coppola.\n\nThe lineage of the families of the other three is byzantine. Inglenook, made famous by Gustav Niebaum in 1897, endured several owners, including United Vintners, Heublein, Constellation and most recently The Wine Group. During many of those phases the product suffered despite having some of the best vineyards in Napa. In 1975, Francis Ford Coppola acquired the estate – but not the brand name until 2011.\n\nBeaulieu, founded in 1900, was in the family until Heublein bought it in 1969. Then came Nabisco, Grand Metropolitan and Diageo. Treasury Estates has owned it since 2016.\n\nLouis Martini founded in the 1930s was bought by Gallo by 2002.\n\nCorporate owners are business people who keep a close eye on the bottom line. Most of them increased production and changed the numbers of wines offered. In some cases, the vineyards that produced these classic wines aren’t used in current wines. Not always have these steps led to improved quality, although BV’s Georges de Latour remains a powerhouse.\n\nWe recently tasted a number of aged cabernet sauvignons from several iconic houses, including one of the four mentioned above. There were remarkable achievements, especially the 2014 Robert Mondavi Maestro.\n\nThe Mondavis sold their winery to Constellation in 2004, but this wine still has the patriarch’s signature. It was concentrated, dense and still showing tannin. “Maestro” recognizes the opening of Mondavi’s To Kaon Cellar in 2000 when Robert led an orchestra in celebration. He was a great leader in Napa Valley.\n\nAlso notable in our tasting was the 2008 Louis Martini Lot 1. Most of the fruit is from Mount Veeder and only 375 cases were made.\n\nWe sampled the 2007 Chateau Montelena estate cabernet sauvignon, but it seemed to be in a dumb stage. Given its pedigree, we have no doubt it will be spectacular. Bo Barrett still owns this winery, but there was a brief dalliance with Cos d’Estournel that fell through.\n\nThe 2007 Beringer Private Reserve, an epic wine that we thought had fallen in prestige over the years, was colossal. It held the classic character of the Napa giants: dense, fragrant, and long living.\n\nThose of you with old wines in your cellar from these great wineries shouldn’t fear that ownership chaos always results in a depreciation of quality. The answer is in the bottle.\n\nThree Sticks\n\nThree Sticks Wines in Sonoma County California was founded in 2002 by William S. Price III. It produces a line of estate chardonnay and pinot noirs that consistently score high marks with wine writers and the public at large.\n\nWe recently tasted its estate-bottled, single-vineyard wines. All of these vineyards are owned by Three Sticks and two of them are considered in the elite of Sonoma County. Caps Crown and Durell vineyards produce grapes for Three Sticks as well as some of the stars of Sonoma County for the likes of Kosta Brown, Kistler, Patz and Hall and others. In some cases, these wines sell for significantly more that their Three Sticks’ cousins.\n\nFollowing are our brief tasting impressions:\n\nThree Sticks Chardonnay Sonoma Mountain One Sky Vineyard 2017 ($50). Dark yellow color and presenting baked apple, butterscotch and vanilla notes.\n\nThree Sticks Chardonnay Sonoma Coast Gap’s Crown Vineyard 2021 ($75). A delightful mélange of apple, mineral, tropical fruit and butterscotch. Our favorite.\n\nThree Sticks Chardonnay Russian River Valley Alana Vineyard 2021 ($80). Not as open as the two previous chardonnays, it presented orange, apple notes and a creamy smooth mouthfeel.\n\nThree Sticks Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast Durell Vineyard 2020. ($80). Our favorite of the pinot noirs. Ripe deep cherry and chocolate. A keeper that will age well.\n\nThree Sticks Pinot Noir Russian River Valley William James Vineyard 2021 ($85). A bit brighter than the others with strawberry and rhubarb jam elements.\n\nThree Sticks Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast Gap’s Crown Vineyard 2021 ($80). Blueberry and mocha dominate a very well-constructed pinot noir. A very close second to the Durell Vineyard sample.\n\nWine picks\n\nCK Mondavi and Family Buttery Chardonnay California 2022 ($8). Buttery, indeed. If you like this style, this inexpensive wine has rich, tropical fruit flavors.\n\nAntica Corte Valpolicella Ripasso Classico Superiore 2021 ($24). This silky wine is made entirely of corvina grapes fermented in the ripasso method. Red berry flavors and medium body.\n\nEsporao Reserva Red DOC Alentejo 2021 ($23). We love this wine from southern Portugal. It is a blend of cabernet sauvignon, aragonez, alicante bouschet and trincadeira grapes. Broad in flavors, it has jammy blueberry and plum flavors with hints of coffee and black pepper.\n\nWines to cheer up mom on her special day\n\nApril 29, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nMother’s Day is approaching and if you’re a father, you better have something planned. Hopefully, it’s a day off – no chores or obligations and that includes dinner. If you’re taking mom out to a Sunday brunch, the challenge is less onerous than cooking a meal at home.\n\nRestaurants will have sparkling wine to offer mom, but it might be nice to buy her a bottle to share at home. In our circle, women love champagne and sparkling wine. The bubbles that dance off the tongue make her feel special and happy.\n\nNothing will make her feel happier than a bottle of French champagne. Our favorite is Champagne Billecart Salmon Rose ($90), a luxury cuvee of chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier.\n\nHere are some less expensive sparkling wines that would make mom feel special:\n\nJ Brut Rosé ($50). From the Russian River Valley, this delightful and consistent rosé is one of the best the region has to offer. Delicate raspberry and strawberry notes with a dash of orange.\n\nArgyle Vintage Brut 2019 ($30). You get a lot of quality in this simple but well-made sparkling wine from the Willamette Valley. Good acidity and a thread of mineral make it an exception wine to pair with appetizers or just to sip.\n\nOrin Swift You Go First ($60). Pinot noir, pinot meunier and chardonnay go into this enjoyable sparkling wine from Orin Swift. Apple and citrus notes dominate the palate.\n\nJosh Prosecco Rosé ($15). Josh is ubiquitous but this sparkling wine is different. The producer uses glera grapes – the same ones used to make Italian prosecco – but adds some pinot noir to the mix.\n\nAnd give some thought to rosé, a year-round favorite of many mothers. Here are a few we like:\n\nMathilde Chapoutier Cotes de Provence Aurisso Sainte-Victoire 2023 ($28). Mathilde is the daughter of the renowned Michel Chapoutier and traveled around France before settling on Provence for her new label. An eighth generation to make wine, Chapoutier rolls together a tapestry of grenache noir, syrah, cinsault and rolle to create a richer rosé that you usually find from Provence. Raspberries, strawberries and citrus abound with a nice touch of mineral.\n\nOne Stone Rosé of Pinot Noir 2023 ($18). Part of the Ancient Peaks family of wines, this very nice wine pays tribute to all of the women who moved mountains, one stone at a time. A portion of each bottle is donated to Dream Big Darlings, a non-profit that provides educational opportunities and mentorship programs for the next generation of female leaders in the wine and spirits industry. Crisp acidity and raspberry, melon and citrus notes.\n\nHogwash California Rosé 2023 ($18). A good value, this wine has fresh strawberry and grapefruit notes with a dash of mandarin orange. Hogwash also packages this wine in 250-ml cans that come two to a pack for only $11. These are great to throw in a cooler or just sip around the pool.\n\nMixed drinks with sparkling wine\n\nProsecco from northern Italy is a bit sweet, which appeals to a lot of consumer palates. For something different, try a drink that is commonly seen through Europe – the Aperol Spritz. Not only does the Aperol give the glass a beautiful strawberry color, but it adds a nice dose of citrus to make it a great quaff before dinner or at brunch. Here’s a recipe:\n\n3 oz. Prosecco\n\n2 oz. Aperol\n\n1 oz. Club soda\n\nGarnish with a slice of orange.\n\nDirections: put ice cubs in glass. Pour in the prosecco and add Aperol and soda.\n\nAvissi makes a good prosecco and offers this alternative recipe for a Sparkling Cosmo:\n\n1 1/2 oz. vodka\n\n½ oz. Triple Sec\n\n½ oz. Cranberry juice\n\n½ oz. Fresh squeezed lime juice\n\n2 oz. Prosecco\n\nDash of simple syrup or agave\n\nDirections: combine vodka, triple sec, cranberry juice, lime juice and ice in a cocktail shaker. Shake until very cold. Taste and if the mixture seems too tart, add more simple syrup or agave. Strained into a glass and top with prosecco. Garnish with orange twist.\n\nElement AL\n\nBogle Family Wines has a series of wines packaged in aluminum cans that are not only better for the environment but quite convenient. Glass production leaves a huge carbon footprint, so many environmentally forward producers are turning to aluminum and cardboard to package their wine.\n\nElement AL’s container is 80 percent lighter than glass for the same 750-ml amount of wine. It is recyclable.\n\nThe chardonnay we tasted from northern California vineyards was pleasant with stone fruit and pear notes. It sells for $17 a bottle and also comes in rose, pinot grigio and pinot noir.\n\nWine picks\n\nHardy Tintara Reserve Shiraz 2019 ($25). A classic old school ebullient Australian shiraz featuring bold berries, mocha and spice in the nose and mouth. Pair with any bold meat dishes.\n\nDow’s Late Bottled Vintage Port 2018 ($30). This is a real find for port lovers. Vintage port is usually bottled after 2 years in barrel. This Late Bottled Vintage port is held in barrel for 6 years, accelerating the aging process while retaining the unique characteristics of the excellent 2018 vintage. Berry and plum notes abide with a hint of licorice. Ready to drink and enjoy now while you wait 15-20 years for the vintage version to mature.\n\nChateau Ste Michelle Horse Heaven Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc 2021 ($14). We’ve seen this on sale for much less at many stores. It’s a great quaff with varietal grapefruit and citrus notes.\n\nTrivento Golden Reserve Malbec 2020 ($20). This is a stunning malbec for the price. From the Lujan de Cuyo, it has nice tannins to give it weight and longevity. But it also has a lot of forward and juicy strawberry, cherry and raspberry flavors. Delicious.\n\nThe great pinot noirs from Sta. Rita Hills\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nWe have always admired the pinot noirs from Santa Barbara County. But, as we have gratefully learned, there’s more to this region than “Santa Barbara.” The more than 280 wineries here are broken into seven American Viticultural Areas. They have unique terroirs and weather to distinguish them from their neighbors.\n\nWe like all of these pinot noirs, but hold a special place in our heart for those from the relatively small Sta. Rita Hills, and AVA designated in 2001 and oddly abbreviated to resolve a protracted legal battle with the Santa Rita winery in Chile. Tucked inside the larger Santa Ynez Valley AVA, Sta. Rita Hills benefits from its proximity to the Pacific Ocean. But the mineral, limestone and marine sediment soil also provide unique flavors.\n\nFor Samra Morris, Sta. Rita Hills is the premiere location for pinot noir and chardonnay, but the area is also gaining an attraction for grenache and syrah.\n\nMorris is the winemaker at Alma Rosa, founded in 2005 by the legendary Richard Sanford and owned by Bob and Barb Zorich since 2014. The mountains here run east to west, unlike the rest of the region where they run north to south. That funnel from the Pacific brings thick morning fog and cool nights – ideal conditions to give a rest to sensitive grape varieties such as pinot noir.\n\nMorris was born and raised in Bosnia, but moved to California after her American husband was transferred from eastern Europe to Travis Air Force Base in northern California. Always wanting to be a winemaker after studying food and vinification sciences at the University of Sarajevo, she started in a tasting room in nearby Napa Valley before working at St. Supery and Michael Mondavi Family Estate. She took a job as assistant winemaker at Alma Rosa in 2019 and stepped into the head winemaker’s role just before harvest.\n\n“They decided if I can survive a war, I can survive this,” she laughed.\n\nHer wines are lovely and pure, which she attributes to the soil and climate. She likes the pinot noirs for their “rose petal nose, vibrant red fruit, raspberries, wild strawberries, orange peel and chalky tannins.”\n\nClones are very important to pinot noir. Morris favors the 943 clone, which produces small clusters she calls “super cute.” These concentrated clusters produce very intense flavors.\n\nThe Santa Barbara AVAs are terrific tourist destinations as well. We have traveled the winding roads many times, stopping at tasting rooms known and unknown. The town Los Olivos plays host to many tasting rooms and the iconic Fess Parker Winery and Inn. Other beautiful tasting rooms are at Alma Rosa, Foley Estates, Melville and Sanford.\n\nMorris calls 2021 a “perfect vintage.”\n\nHere are 10 pinot noirs from Sta. Rita Hills that we really liked. Alas, they are generally expensive from this AVA.\n\nAlma Rosa Caracol Pinot Noir 2021 ($90). With grapes taken from a knoll top planted in 2015, this vineyard blend of clones and rootstocks shows off a broad array of raspberry and strawberry flavors with a touch of orange peel and mineral. Good acidity and balanced tannin make it a perfect quaff.\n\nAlma Rosa Barrel Select Pinot Noir 2021 ($90). Using grapes from a vineyard 750 feet in elevation, this tightly structured wine has bing cherry, cranberry and spice notes with chalky tannins to make it a good complement to serious foods.\n\nFoley Estates Barrel Select Pinot Noir 2021 ($80). This is a serious pinot noir with big tannins and bold dark cherry and plum flavors. Hints of pepper, spice and oak make it a well-rounded wine for current drinking alongside a steak or it can be aged for a few years.\n\nMigration Peake Ranch Vineyard Pinot Noir 2022 ($75). Bing cherry, raspberry and violet aromas are followed by concentrated red berry flavors with a dose of spice. Very opulent in texture.\n\nKosta-Browne Pinot Noir 2022 ($78). This well-respected producer makes some of the best – and most expensive – pinot noirs in Sta. Rita Hills. But this blend of several vineyards is a good introduction. Blackberry, pomegranate and strawberry notes with a dollop of spice.\n\nSanford La Rinconada Pinot Noir 2020 ($85). This venerable producer makes some of the best pinot noir in all of California. They have depth, concentration and gout de terroir. Many of them far exceed the price of the La Rinconada. This wine has generous raspberry and fennel aromas to lead off a broad spectrum of red fruit and spice.\n\nFess Parker Pinot Noir 2022 ($35). This is the most reasonably priced pinot noir from this region you’ll probably find. It’s simple and approachable with blueberry, cranberry and strawberry notes. Medium-bodied.\n\nSea Smoke Southing Pinot Noir 2021 ($95). A lot of care and attention goes into this concentrated and juicy pinot noir. Classic cherry notes with bright strawberry aromas and a thin thread of minerality to keep it interesting.\n\nSandhi Sanford & Benedict Pinot Noir 2019 ($45). Another reasonably priced pinot noirs from Sta. Rita Hills, this is medium bodied, very delicious and approachable with juicy black cherry flavors.\n\nRockhound Radian Vineyard Pinot Noir 2022 ($90). Launched just last year, this producer is Reed and Megan Skupny, the second generation of Lang & Reed. From a very special vineyard, the pinot noir is a co-ferment of three Burgundian clones aged for 16 months in French oak. It is an exquisite wine with black cherry and plum flavors.\n\nConsumers drinking less wine, less alcohol\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nWhen we began writing this weekly wine column in the 1980s, France was the envy of the wine industry. Not only had their people been making wine longer than the United States, but they were making it better. And, the French coveted their wine like they coveted their cheese. Having a couple of glasses of wine at dinner was commonplace, partly because French tap water was so bad but mostly because wine was ensconced in French culture.\n\nHow times have changed. Americans – and winemakers from other European regions – are making great wine using the same grapes indigenous to France. Moreso, the shine has worn off wine consumption in France. It’s no longer de rigueur.\n\nNo longer is wine given to French kids in canteens as they go to school. Only one in 10 people in France drink a glass of wine every day – a far cry from the 1980s when half of France’s adult population drank wine daily.\n\nThere are many reasons the French are no longer wedded to this custom and the reasons aren’t much different than those cited by Americans.\n\nFirst, the medical community is reversing the conception that wine in moderation improves health. We now read that any consumption of alcohol increases health risks. French President Emmanuel Macron sought to reverse this image when he boasted on television that he drank two glasses of wine a day. He was being supportive of one of his country’s most important economic engines, but French doctors and health advocates were appalled.\n\nNow, 37 percent of the French do not drink wine. Sacre bleu!\n\nSecond, the cost of the best local wine has skyrocketed in France. With demand dropping at a time when production is increasing, producers are dumping grape juice in the streets or turning it into cleaning fluids as the government seeks to stabilize prices.\n\nAlso influencing the decline in wine consumption is a generational change that looks more favorably on craft beer and cocktails – if anything at all. The same is the case in the United States when younger people are no longer enamored with getting drunk.\n\nWine marketers are trying to uplift the industry with confidence that this market trend will change. They are focused on projecting the industry as being environmentally sensitive – and it is. More and more producers have adopted biodynamic and sustainable farming. We are starting to see packaging change as well from the carbon-sapping heavy glass bottles to cardboard and aluminum containers. Still, it’s an uphill struggle now to project wine as a safe, healthy and affordable daily quaff.\n\nWhich brings us to the point that it may not matter for too much longer. Scientists are suggesting that 70 percent of the world’s vineyards may be unsustainable at the end of this century if climate warming continues on its trajectory. Maybe milk will make a comeback.\n\nShopping for wine\n\nFriends and acquaintances often ask us for wine suggestions and we’re hard pressed to answer. We sample wine constantly, dump a lot and find a few to recommend. Unfortunately, we have no idea whether some of our favorite wines are available in their local stores. Most of the gems we discover are not mass produced. So, we tend to recommend labels – Wente for chardonnay, Decoy for almost anything, La Crema for pinot noir, Bogle and J. Lohr for red, Columbia Crest for cabernet sauvignon. These wines are widely available in grocery stores and liquor outlets.\n\nBut we also try to steer people to regions, such as Paso Robles in California, Portugal, Spain, southern France, Sicily and parts of Italy. Even so, wines from even these bargain regions are priced more than $25 a bottle.\n\nFinding a good wine in a sea of labels is a challenge that isn’t likely to change. But don’t despair; the journey is fun. Like champagne but can’t afford it? Try prosecco or a Spanish cava at a fraction of the cost. Mix it with Aperol if you aren’t satisfied with its taste. Like Prisoner and all of its spinoffs but can’t afford them? There are tons of zinfandels from Lodi that will slake your thirst for this jammy quaff. Don’t like to spend big money on prestigious wines but won’t settle for less quality? Drink less, but drink better.\n\nWine picks\n\nDouble Diamond Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($90). This is a colossal but approachable wine from Schrader. Aggressive black fruit and cassis aromas with plum and black cherry flavors, hints of tea, earth and vanilla.\n\nMount Langi Ghiran Billi Billi Shiraz 2021 ($16). From Victoria, the fruit for this shiraz produces lively and delicious black berry character with a hint of spice. Simple, yet delicious.\n\nDAOU PATRIMONY 2020 ($300). In our conversations with Daniel Daou, there was never a hesitation in declaring Paso Robles the best region to make wine from Bordeaux’s noble grape varieties. Napa Valley producers disagree, but the Daou brothers are unrelenting with this most expensive luxury wine from Paso Robles. It has continued to score 95-plus scores from critics and old bottles are fetching more than $500 – if you can find one. But let’s not call the 2020 a bargain. It is an excessive luxury few can afford. Using cabernet sauvignon grapes from a few special rows on an exclusive mountain vineyard, the full-bodied wine is aged in custom French barrels to achieve a special richness and complexity. The brothers recently sold the winery to Treasury Wine Estates for $1 billion but remain involved in the winemaking.\n\nM. Chapoutier Belleruche Cotes du Rhone Blanc 2021 ($15-18). Crafted from a blend of classic white Rhone varieties such as roussanne, viognier and grenache blanc. Mineral and peach notes dominate in a very nice easy to drink white wine.\n\nBodega Renacer Punta Final Reserva Cabernet Franc Organic Argentina 2021 ($20-25). This cabernet franc reminded us of a very well-made chinon from the Loire Valley. Ripe berry fruit with a hint of fresh herbs makes for a very interesting and quaffable package.\n\nWine production up, consumption down\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nMore has been done to study wine drinkers in recent years as producers try hard to introduce the beverage to more consumers. Alas, consumption is down significantly in almost every country, particularly among young people who eschew all alcoholic beverages or who prefer spirits and beer in moderation. Boomers, like us, continue to hold our own because we were around when “60 Minutes” aired its impactful segment on red wine’s benefit to heart health.\n\nRecent studies have darkened the glow that surrounded the boom years in wine consumption, but results vary so much that it is impossible to conclude that wine consumed in moderation is either good or bad. But the projectory of sales year after year shows that the attraction to wine as a health benefit is long gone.\n\nOn top of this decline is a wine glut in Europe that has resulted in an effort to put less wine on the market in hopes of holding prices. In France the government is paying growers to rip up vines; elsewhere, wine or juice is being dumped. For savvy consumers, there are bargains to be found as competition heats up. We’ve read that prices are likely to drop dramatically for the 2023 vintage yet to be released.\n\nThe Wine Market Council did a recent study to assess consumer interest. It found that the glow has worn off the covid binge buying and a tight economy is discouraging discretionary buying. Dining out is more important than a $50 bottle of wine.\n\nOut of the nearly 4,500 U.S. consumers they surveyed, about 34 percent drink wine; 13 percent drink wine exclusively over other alcholic beverages.\n\nAlthough baby boomers command the consumption lead, high-income millennials (now 27 to 42 years old) are a very important target for producers. Wealth has a lot to do with consumption for all age groups – more than half of those surveyed who earn more than $100,000 annually drink wine, but only 15 percent of those earning less than $50,000 annually do so.\n\nScarcity drives prices\n\nWe were listening to a podcast on the power of persuasion the other day and was struck by one of the first elements in convincing someone to buy a product: the principle of scarcity.\n\nIf you have used Amazon before and noticed that an item has “only three left” or if a store salesman said “this is the last one left,” you know the persuasive power of scarcity. Numerous tests have shown that people are driven to buy something if they feel it may not be available if they wait overnight.\n\nIt’s a principle that works in the wine industry just as well.\n\nScreaming Eagle is the poster child, but there are hundreds of wine producers who drive up prices and sales by limiting production. In many cases, there is a waiting period just to lay your hands on a wine that can cost more than $300 a bottle. If they increased production, there would be no scarcity and thus no stampede to their door.\n\nThat was the case with iconic wines like Silver Oak, Caymus and even Dom Perignon whose productions were once small. When popularity encouraged owners – often new and larger owners – to ramp up production, popularity waned. Their collector status gave way to cult wines with smaller productions. We are always stunned to find new wines on the market that sell for well over $100 a bottle when they debut.\n\nWe got an offer from de Negoce, a reseller of wine launched by Cameron Hughes many years ago. The Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon was available from the producer for $195. Hughes was selling it for $27 — he gets the same wine from the producer with the understanding he won’t identify the source.\n\nHe wrote, “The winery bottled their portion and sold us the rest of the blend out of the tank so we have the exact same 100% Cabernet Sauvignon blend as the original bottling.”\n\nIn short, the original producer didn’t want to increase production and reduce the notion of scarcity.\n\nWith sales down, we question whether these cult producers will be able to maintain their lofty price points.\n\nBig Bottles\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law a bill that will allow the purchase of wine in glass containers up to 15 liters. This is surely good news for those of us who want to buy a couple of methuselahs (6 liters) or maybe a family size balthazar (12 liters).\n\nWe assume these large-format bottles were banned earlier out of fear that alcoholics will drop a straw in them and carry on their madness. It was nonesense and we’re happy to see the governor do away with the ban. However, we are puzzled by his comment made at the bill signing.\n\nHe said, “In Florida, we are always looking for ways to reduce regulation and improve our residents’ qualilty of life.”\n\nIt’s a bit of exaggeration to say that a grande-size bottle of wine will improve the quality of life in the Sunshine State.\n\nWine picks\n\nHanna Sauvignon Blanc 2022 ($20). This simple and quaffable wine from the Russian River Valley is a great value. Fresh citrus and pineapple notes.\n\nTenuta Sant’Antonio Monti Garbi Valpolicella Ripasso Superiore 2020 ($23). A great value, this wine is made in the traditional ripasso method with dried grape skins used with fresh grapes in the secondary fermentation. Bright red fruit, medium body and easy to drink. It is aged 12 months in barrel to add complexity. Delicious.\n\nTenuta Sant’Antonio “Antonio Castagnedi” Amaroni della Valpolicella DOCG 2018 ($50). This is the bigger version of the Monti Garbi and showcases the best from Veneto. Big yet elegant, it is a blend of corvina, rondinella, croatina and oseleta grapes. Rustic cherry flavors with fine tannins and a long finish.\n\nThe values from Portugal\n\nApril 1, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nThe wines from the Alentejo region of Portugal continue to impress us and represent some of the best values in the wine kingdom. Although consumers may not recognize the indigenous grape varieties, they will enjoy the lively, fresh and unique white wines as well as the simple and versatile red wines.\n\nAlentejo is a large region of Portugal and represents about 13 percent of the country’s vineyards and 18 percent of the its wine production. The Portuguese drink about 67 liters per capita; in the U.S. per capita consumption is only 12 liters. Most of the production stays in the country, but we’re finally seeing more labels in the United States.\n\nPortuguese wine makers embraced sustainable farming before it was popular. They are well ahead of other wine-growing regions that are adopting environmentally friendly farming practices.\n\nHere are some of the wines we liked:\n\nHerdade de Malhadinha Nova Antao Vaz da Malhadinha 2022 ($30). Antao Vaz is the most popular white wine grape in this region and produces wines that are fruit-forward, smoothly textured and redolent of peach, melon, citrus and mineral. No oak is used.\n\nQuinta da Fonte Souto Branco 2021 ($29). This is a tasty blend of arinto and verdelho grapes sourced from two Portalegre vineyards located at just over 1,640 feet. Citrus and herbal aromas with creamy texture and stone fruit and citrus flavors.\n\nJMF “Jose de Sousa” Tinto 2017 ($19). This red wine is a blend of grand noir, touriga francesa and touriga nacional. The grapes are foot-trodden in small lagares and then fermented in 100-year-old talhas, an ancient clay amphorae. These vessels are moistened several times a day to keep the temperatures between 50 and 60 degrees. Strict standards must be met for a wine to be declared a DOC Vinho de Talha. This wine has raisiny red fruit flavors with tobacco and spice aromas and a hint of oak.\n\nFitaPreta Tinto 2021 ($27). From the Evora area, this medium-bodied red wine is a blend of aragones, alicante bouschet, trincadeira and castelao grapes.\n\nHerdade Sao Miguel Colheita Seleccionada Tinto 2018 ($16). A blend of alicante bouschet, touriga nacional, syrah and cabernet sauvignon, this assemblage is well-integrated with red fruit character. Alicante bouschet, a cross between grenache and petit bouschet, is the most recognized red grape variety here.\n\nHerdade de Rocim Alicante Bouschet 2021 ($23). All alicante bouschet from the Vidigueira region, this smooth wine has a floral bouquet with mature red fruit flavors and a dash of spice.\n\nQuinta da Fonte Souto Branco Portalegre Alentejo 2021 ($26). This Symington product has citrus and apple notes as well as a mid-palate creaminess that made a fine package. Mostly made from the renowned arinto grape.\n\nQuinta da Fonte Souto Red Portalegre Alentejo 2019 ($26). This is a skillful blend of alicante bouschet, syrah and alfrocheiro grapes. Big rich and elegant with berry fruit notes as well as hints of pepper, mocha, and licorice. Very impressive.\n\nDouro\n\nThe wines from Portugual’s northern regions should also bear attention. We have been fans of port, fortified wines that came of age in the 1700s as trade with England required a stable wine that could survive a lengthy sea voyage. Dominating the port trade is the Symington Family owners, producers of Dow’s, Graham’s, Warre’s and Cockburn’s. But they also produce table wines from their estates in the Douro Valley and a new entry from the Portalegre region in Alentejo.\n\nSymington produces a value-oriented line of wines titled Vale do Bomfim. A red and white are available and are sourced from indigenous grapes from the Quinta do Bomfim vineyard which also is the source of grapes for their renowned vintage port. The Vale do Bomfim wines are priced at $15 per bottle which puts them squarely in bargain territory.\n\nThe Vale do Bomfim DOC Douro White 2022 ($15) is crafted from indigenous white grapes and creates a quaffable balanced white wine with lemon and grapefruit notes that is similar to a well-made sauvignon blanc.\n\nThe Vale do Bomfim DOC Douro Red 2020 ($15) is made from the same indigenous red varieties of grapes that make up their vintage port. This is a potential summer barbecue wine that would delight with a little chill. Cherry notes with an accent of black pepper make an easy to drink wine.\n\nPrats and Symington is a partnership with the Prats family of Bordeaux fame. Prazo de Roriz is produced by the group and is another value-oriented wine. We really enjoyed the Prazo de Roriz DOC Douro 2021 ($18) vinted from indigenous Portuguese grapes and made in an easy and ready to drink style. Cherry and raspberry notes dominate with a black pepper accent and should also make a nice summer sipper.\n\nWe also like Prats and Symington’s Post Scriptum de Chryseia Douro 2021 ($28). This is the second wine to $100+ Chryseia and is very impressive. Very fresh and with less oak than the Chryseia this wine is drinking well now. Fresh berry and cherry notes dominate and make a very smooth drink.\n\nWine picks\n\nCantini Pellegrino Gazzerotta Nero d’Avola Sicilia 2021 ($23). This simple wine with soft and bright red fruit character makes for a good sipper or a companion to pasta and grilled meats.\n\nCloudy Bay Marlborough Pinot Noir 2021 ($43). This beauty displays fresh, rich blackberry and cherry notes with a hint of oak. If you like some of the pinot noirs from California, try this one.\n\nCol Solare Cabernet Sauvignon Red Mountain Washington State 2019 ($145). Created from a partnership between Marchesi Antinori and Chateau St. Michelle winery. This excellent red wine is crafted from 95 percent cabernet sauvignon and 5 percent cabernet franc grapes. Cassis and berry notes dominate with elements of eucalyptus and cedar. Very smooth and elegant.\n\nDoes wine really have minerals in it?\n\nMarch 25, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nA California wine producer recently recounted an experience in his tasting room that is humorous on its surface but ponderous underneath. A young visitor was reading the tasting notes of a chardonnay and was intrigued.\n\n“At what stage do they add the apricot juice?” she asked.\n\nOf course, there is no apricot in wine – it just tastes like it. Pinot noir tastes like black cherries, old burgundies smell like a barn, chardonnay tastes like tropical fruit, and sauvignon blanc reminds one of freshy mowed grass. As absurd as some of these descriptors, they are handy in communicating what our brains perceive when we taste wine.\n\nOne of the most controversial descriptors of late is “minerality.” Chemists and professionals argue that you cannot taste mineral in a soil because a vineyard root sucks up water and there isn’t time for elements like potassium and zinc to flavor it. Yet we often see descriptors for wines from Chablis and Loire Valley like “wet stone,” “gunflint” and “chalk” as synonyms for “mineral.” It is used for both the smell and taste of wines.\n\nChampagne vineyards are known for their limestone soil and occasionally we will see a tasting note reflect the steely flavor of limestone. Same goes for many pinot noirs that smell of “forest floor” when the vineyards are no where near a forest.\n\nThe tasting notes we write reflect what we recall from our time in the kitchen or an orchard. A person who has never had a currant, for instance, is not likely to think of it when tasting a cabernet sauvignon. A person who does not know the difference between lavender and rosemary is not likely to use either one in describing a wine from Cotes du Rhone, yet these words summarize what the French call “garrigue.”\n\nWine descriptors are not just helpful in communication; they are also helpful in matching wine with food. The minerality typically found in Chablis, for instance, signals a good match with oysters and scallops. A wine with acidity offsets the fattiness of a steak. White wine is not associated with fish because of its color – it is because of its acidity and white fruit flavors that are a better match than red fruit and tannins found in red wines.\n\nHere are five white wines commonly associated with minerality:\n\nDomaine Drouhin Vaudon Chablis 2020 ($30). Grapefruit, citrus, dry and minerally.\n\nDomaine Vacheron Sancerre 2019 ($45). Green apple, lemon rind, grapefruit and minerally.\n\nSurrau “Branu” Vermetino di Gallura 2021 ($20). Peach, lemon and minerals.\n\nInama “Carbonare Soave Classico 2020 ($30). Old vine Garganega grapes make this a unique wine with apple and pear notes and zesty acidity.\n\nLa Valentina Pecorino Colline Pescaresi 2021 ($18). Known more in U.S. for its cheese, pecorino also is known for its austere, steely wines with good acidity, citrus and melon notes.\n\nCool Australia\n\nAustralia’s cool regions produce some excellent chardonnays and pinots that won’t break the bank. Here are a few we recently enjoyed:\n\nAngove Chardonnay 2021 ($20). Produced from grapes grown in the Mount Lofty range east of McLaren Vale, this pure chardonnay has citrus and apple notes with a long finish. We liked it because it wasn’t over-oaked and had good balance.\n\nYering Station Pinot Noir 2019 ($35). From grapes grown in the oldest vineyard in Victoria, this Yarra Valley pinot noir is a steal. The cool climate keeps this wine fresh and fruity with black cherry notes.\n\nMount Langhi Ghiran Billi Billi Shiraz 2021 ($16). From Victoria, the fruit for this shiraz produces lively and delicious black berry character with a hint of spice. Simple, yet delicious.\n\nPick up the spirit\n\nWe tasted two new spirits recently and were sufficiently impressed to record our impressions. Neft Vodka from Austria ($30-35 750ml) comes packaged in unbreakable white mini steel oil barrels and is distilled from rye. Austrian mountain spring water is added to adjust the proof to 80. The vodka is very clean with attractive fruity notes some spice, and a hint of vanilla.\n\nWe also tasted and enjoyed Drakes Organic Spiced Rum ($20 750ml) distilled from organically sourced Columbian sugar cane. Very expressive clove cinnamon, and butterscotch dominate with a hint of vanilla. Add this to cream for a great eggnog or simply enjoy straight or over ice.\n\nWine picks\n\nCockburn’s Special Reserve Port N/V ($24). Not overly sweet, this port is aged for 5 years in oak to produce an eminently drinkable port. Not overly complex this port features dark sweet cherry notes with a hint of mocha. Good value.\n\nVara Garnacha Gold Label Vino Tinto Espanol 2020 ($34). Vara was founded in 2012 in New Mexico but it wasn’t until recently its wines were nationally distributed. Its unique concept is to draw grapes across borders and blend them with grapes grown in the United States – a blend of culture and product. Artist Xavier Zamarripa and wine veteran Doug Diefenthaler recruited several established winemakers to craft special wines, including this delicious garnacha. Blended with carinena, monastrell, mencia, and a little caberent sauvignon, merlot and syrah – all from various locations in Spain and California -- it is round with ripe cherry, red currant and raspberry notes with a floral nose and soft mouthfeel.\n\nPriest Ranch Snake Oil 2019 ($110). The name comes from the cure-alls that were sold in Napa Valley in the 1800s. This wine may not cure any of your ills, but it will put you in a good mood. From estate-grown cabernet sauvignon, it is classic Napa Valley. Layers of blueberry and blackberry with a hint of mocha notes.\n\nNew Zealand’s pinot noirs worth a try\n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR New Zealand’s recognition as a wine producing country has come a long way since its debut in U.S. wine markets in the mid-1980s. The commercial wine industry in New Zealand had just yielded its first international success with the Cloudy Bay Winery’s sauvignon blanc from Marlborough. Since then, New Zealand has become synonymous with sauvignon blanc, and Marlborough is New Zealand’s dominant wine area with about 70 percent of the country’s total wine output.\n\nA good deal of New Zealand’s wine exports are sauvignon blanc table wines that are available at reasonable costs in the mid-teens. This price point -- and an over all drinkability -- has made these wines winners for consumers.\n\nCitrus and grapefruit notes as well as herbal, grassy nuances are sauvignon blancs’ calling card here. Easy-to-find brands such as Kim Crawford, Brancott and Oyster Bay are household names among imbibers in the U.S.\n\nMost of the many wines that we have reviewed are the more moderately priced sauvignon blancs. However, recently we tasted two current releases from Cloudy Bay that showed the new depths of New Zealand wines.\n\nThe 2023 Cloudy Bay Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc ($35) is priced a bit more than many New Zealand sauvignon blancs, but we believe it delivered the goods. A very well-balanced wine, it featured a complex mélange of lemon and lime notes, bright refreshing acidity along with grass and melon elements.\n\nPinot noir is making a name for itself in the cooler climate of new Zealand and we have been impressed with several efforts that we have tasted. The 2021 Cloudy Bay Pinot Noir Marlborough ($43) is a wow. This beauty displays fresh, rich blackberry and cherry notes with a hint of oak. If you like some of the pinot noirs from California, then try this one.\n\nVilla Maria Winery is another iconic New Zealand producer of Marlborough sauvignon blanc. Most of its production sells in the mid-teen range and offers good value. In addition, Villa Maria has produced a super-premium sauvignon blanc showcasing its touch with growing the grape in a non-traditional way. The 2021 Villa Maria Woven Sauvignon Blanc Marlborough ($50) was aged in 1-to-2-year-old French barrels of different types and further aged on its lees in stainless steel for 6 more months. Most New Zealand sauvignon blanc is only aged in stainless steel before release. The result of this special attention is a very complex and enjoyable wine with an herbal grassy nose followed by mineral, citrus and a hint of passion fruit in the mouth. The finish is creamy.\n\nWe also enjoyed Juggernaut from Marlborough. The 2023 sauvignon blanc – the producer’s first -- has the classic bright acidity and grass aromas with grapefruit and lemon flavors. From the Bogle Family Wine Colllection, it’s a great value at $16.\n\nAlcohol ranked by state\n\nThe National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has ranked each state according to the amount of wine consumed. We suppose it’s an effort to show which states have the worst drinking problem, but those who live there may see it as a badge of honor.\n\nCalifornia, a state with the most vineyards and tasting rooms, consumed the most wine. In second place was Florida with Texas close behind. These are populus states, so it is not surprising to see them atop the heap. South Dakota, West Virginia and Wyoming held down the basement. Maryland was about in the middle of the pack.\n\nWhen measured per capita, Washington, D.C., where lawmakers are literally wined and dined, consumed the most wine. Delaware was second. Maybe there is nothing else to do there.\n\nWine picks\n\nTapestry Paso Robles Red Blend 2021 ($25). New to the Beaulieu Vineyard portfolio, this blend of cabernet sauvigon, syrah and petit syrah is classic Paso Robles. Ripe and rich dark fruit flavors with distinctive mocha and chocolate notes with a dash of spice and cassis. Full in the mouth and easy to drink. The label reflects the the flora and fauna common to the region.\n\nFrank Family Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($60). Some merlot, petit verdot and cabernet franc go into this well-structured and complex wine. Broad aromas of floral, expresso, cedar and tobacco accent the rich dark berry fruit flavors.\n\nEleven Eleven Pinot Noir Sonoma County Russian River Valley Bacigalupi Vineyard 2019 ($65). Expensive but awesome, put this in the special occasion category. Cherry and plum notes with vanilla and spice notes in a beautiful fruity mélange.\n\nConde Valdemar Rioja Crianza 2018 ($20). This is an everyday pop and pour for a weekday meal. Berry fruit notes and no overbearing oak keeping this wine clean and refreshing.\n\nDuca di Salaparuta Duca Enrico Nero D’Avola Sicilia DOC 2018 ($50-60). One of the best red wines that we have recently tasted from Sicily. The wine presents a bold expression of berry and plum notes with a hint of vanilla and sweet oak.\n\nSome unusual gems from Italy\n\nMarch 11, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nItaly, the largest wine producing country in the world, is the home to a plethora of grape varieties. The Italian government has authorized more than 350 grape varieties for commercial grape production out of about 500 varieties grown there. Compare this to the second largest grape growing country in the world (France), where about only 60 grape varieties are commercially grown.\n\nTwo of the more obscure red Italian grape varieties are lagrein and schiava. Mention these grapes to most wine consumers, even Italian wine aficionados, and you can expect a blank stare in return. Grown in Trentino in northeastern Italy, this area is better known for the ubiquitous usually bargain priced slaker of thirsts, pinot grigio. This cool climate growing area lies hard against the Dolomite and Alps mountain ranges. Although the majority of residents speak Italian, fully a third speak German due to the region’s former pre-war Austrian government.\n\nSchiava grapes produce a lighter style of red more akin to pinot noir than cabernet sauvignon, while lagrein yields a more fruity wine akin to syrah.\n\nFollowing are our tasting notes:\n\nAbbazia Di Novacella Schiava Alto Adige 2022 ($20-25). This light-colored red wine exhibited a light ruby color. Very much in the style of a pinot noir but with more acidity. No oak all stainless steel. A spicy nose with cherry motes and a hint of cedar. Delicious!\n\nTramin Schiava Suditrol Alto Adige DOC 2021 ($20-25). Very light in color almost like a dark rose. Notes of pomegranate dominate with bracing, palate-cleansing acidity in this wine aged in stainless steel. Colterenzio Lagrein Suditrol Alto Adige DOC 2021 ($22-25). This wine displays a plum nose with dried cherries and pomegranate notes on the palate. Soft tannins and a very pleasant mouth feel. Elena Walch Vigna Castel Ringberg Riserva Alto Adige ($55-60). A hint of flowers with ripe black cherries. Very full and rich. Our favorite but it isn’t fair to compare a riserva with a non riserva\n\nExploring Italy we keep discovering odd bits of wine trivia as we taste its wines. Recently, we came across another wine region that produces wines worth considering.\n\nNestled in southern Tuscany immediately below Montalcino lies Monteccuco. It doesn’t even show up on many wine maps of the region. Maybe that is because it was only recognized in 1998 as a DOC and achieved DOCG status in 2011. Sangiovese, as in most of Tuscany, is the star here and proved to us that it is worthy of recognition. Vineyards here only produce about 3 tons per acre and grow in volcanic soils from an ancient eruption.\n\nThese wines can be hard to source. However, we believe they are worthy of consideration due to their mostly modest pricing and distinctive quality.\n\nWe recently tasted three wines from this region. The first was a Montecucco Rosso the Poggio Stenti Montecucco Rosso DOC 2021 ($15-18). Montecucco Rosso must contain at least 60 percent sangiovese grapes. This example is also blended with a bit of cabernet sauvignon and aged in stainless steel tanks. The result is a delicious black cherry elixir that is just plain fun to drink.\n\nThe La Banditaccia Vigna Allegra Riserva Montecucco Sangiovese DOCG 2018 ($20-25) was a classic Tuscan wine with dried cherry notes and a hint of cedar in the finish. Aged in large Slavonian wood casks for 14 months, it is somewhat reminiscent of a good quality Rioja reserva.\n\nOur favorite of the trio was the Cartacanta Basile Montecucco Sangiovese DOCG 2018 ($15-20). This wine featured less wood than the La Banditaccia, presenting ripe cherry notes in a delicious fresh package. A great value.\n\nOther Italian gems\n\nSallier de la Tour Nero d’Avola Sicily 2020 (($16). Nero d’Avola rules Sicily and this one has fresh red fruit character with a dose of licorice and spice. Its firm tannins make in an inexpensive choice to serve alongside beef and other grilled meats.\n\nSurrau Isola dei Nuraghi IGT 2020 ($27). From Sardina, this eclectic blend of indigenous grapes offers a a medium-bodied, fruity wine with bright red fruit character. Included in the blend is cannonau, muristellu and carignano grapes. Very unique and pleasant.\n\nTenuta Regaleali Lamuri Nero d’Avola DOC 2019 ($21). This wine from Tasca Conti d’Almerita is a classic expression of Sicily’s top indigenous grape. Soft tannins, good balance, and loads of accessible dark fruit flavors with an earthy feel. Delicious to drink on its own or to pair with a meat-based pasta.\n\nSodale Merlot Cotarella IGP Lazio 2020 ($25-30). We really enjoyed this very soft expression of merlot from the region around Rome. A very enjoyable table wine featuring cherry and berry notes with very soft tannins.\n\nWine picks\n\nEl Coto Coto de Imaz Reserva Rioja 2018 ($20-25). 100 percent tempranillo grapes this red wine balances that knife edge of oak and fruit that some Riojas get wrong. Ripe plums and cherries with a hint of mocha makes for a terrific drink.\n\nGoosecross State Lane Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley ($90). This albeit expensive red wine delivers. A total package that offers cassis, black cherry, and a hint of mocha satisfies. Fantastic!\n\nDecoy Red Blend Limited Alexander Valley 2021 ($30). The merlot and cabernet sauvignon come together nicely in this smooth and rich blend from a top growing region for Bordeaux grape varieties. The merlot rounds off the cabernet tannins. Effusive aromas of cherry, clove and cinnamon hand off to ripe blackberry and black cherry flavors.\n\nLocal people make it big in California wine\n\nMarch 4, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nIf you’re a parent, you have probably worried when a son or daughter chucked a four-year degree in science to strike out for something fun. Perhaps your beloved child wanted to tour Europe for a year, become a tennis coach or just surf a California beach before getting serious about a career.\n\nFor some, the fun choice – and the career choice -- was wine.\n\nOver the years, we have found a few people in the Annapolis area who have either abandoned a promising career to pursue winemaking or match their skills as artists to create labels for wine producers.\n\nMark Davis, for instance, graduated from the University of Maryland with a degree in chemical engineering. He found a good government job shortly after that, but grew bored of it pretty quickly. His interest in chemistry provoked him to make wine in his parents’ house in Bowie – he said it wasn’t very good but the fermentation experiment encouraged him to strike out for California. He did an internship at a small facility, which was satisfying enough to provoke him to apply to University of California at Davis. Two years later he was participating in harvests all over Napa Valley.\n\nShe wrote to us in an email, “Winemaking is fascinating. It’s an intersection of science, craft, art and a little sprinkle of magic. I was able to draw a lot of parallels between winemaking and ceramics – both very alchemical and physical art forms that require meticulous attention to detail.”\n\nHer label graced the 2021 Desparada Vela Sauvignon Blanc from the Chelle Mountain Vineyard – a wine that scored an amazing 97 points from the Wine Advocate. We had to get our hands on the wine from an internet source and we’re thankful we did. It is a well-balanced and elegant sauvignon blanc with a lot of dimension and character.\n\nElena said label art for each bottle comes from a group brainstorming session in which participants are encouraged to doodle what they feel when they drink the wine. Historically, they have chosen illustrations of women from old French paintings, but lately the focus has been a celebration of more figures and forms.\n\nFor more information, see www.desparada.com.\n\nJeff Baker, son of Mary Lou Baker of Annapolis, is also a label designer. He has done labels for Kosta Browne, one of the most respectable wine producers of California pinot noir.\n\nWine picks\n\nTenuta Frescobaldi Castiglioni Toscana IGT 2018 ($26). This was a recent crowd favorite at a party. A blend of cabernet sauvignon, merlot, cabernet franc and the local sangiovese, it bursts with blackberry flavors with layers of licorice, cloves and black pepper.\n\nBinomio Montepulciano d’Abruzzo Riserva DOC 2019 ($52). A partnership of Inama and La Valentina, this beautifully textured wine uses an unusual clone of montepulciano to achieve a rustic quality and concentrated red grape flavors.\n\nJ.Lohr Flume Crossing Sauvignon Blanc 2023 ($14). This is one of the most pleasurable and different sauvignon blancs we have tasted in a long time. Aged 30 percent in neutral acacia barrels, it offers a less acidic and tart personality than many of its competitors – it certainly isn’t for those who love their New Zealand sauvignon blancs. Classic grapefruit and citrus notes, but there is also a dash of spice and a load of palate richness.\n\nBracaia Il Tre 2021 ($25). There is nothing complicated in this Tuscany blend of sangiovese, merlot and cabernet sauvignon – but, oh, what a pleasurable quaff to sip or share with a burger or slice of pizza. Lots of red fruit and mulberry flavors.\n\nYou can afford Bordeaux with these choices\n\nFebruary 26, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nRed Bordeaux wines are often considered to be too costly. Prices for some of the top tier of Bordeaux wines make headlines usually focused on first growth grand crus, such as Chateaux Lafite Rothschild or Chateau Margaux. Today more than 7,000 chateaus produce wine in Bordeaux even though only 61 were included in the 1855 classification of grand crus. Although many of the classified growths can be expensive, thousands of them are not. The average consumer can afford Bordeaux. Bordeaux’s 57 appellations produce more appellation controlee wines than any other wine growing area in France. A plethora of wines from these many non-grand crus are available in the U.S. and savvy consumers can find high quality, relatively low-cost enjoyment. Labels for these value-oriented wines vary, but in general look for Bordeaux, Bordeaux Superior, Cotes De Bordeaux or simply Medoc.\n\nHistorically, only six red grapes were allowed in Bordeaux red wines. Cabernet sauvignon, merlot and cabernet franc make up 89 percent of the grapes cultivated. Merlot dominates at 66 percent. Petite verdot, malbec and carmenere round out the group. But in the last couple of years new, heat- and disease-resistant grape varieties were introduced to accommodate climate changes.\n\nRecently, we tasted three red Bordeauxs from the excellent 2018 vintage. The three spanned both banks of the Gironde estuary and were constituted with different grape combinations to offer an interesting glimpse of the region. All were typical of our past tastings of moderately priced Bordeaux and confirmed our belief in their terrific price value. Chateau de Panigon Medoc 2018 ($20). Almost an equal split between cabernet sauvignon and merlot with a dash of petite verdot, this wine showed more structure and was a bit reticent – maybe because of its significant use of cabernet sauvignon. Cherry and black currant notes, soft tannins suggest improvement with a little aging.\n\nChateau Hyot Cotes de Bordeaux Castillon 2018 ($15). Cotes de Bordeaux Castillon abuts St. Emilion and uses a similar mix of grapes. Mostly merlot with a bit of cabernet franc, this wine displays bright cherry notes with a slight floral note.\n\nChateau de Ribebon Bordeaux Superior 2018 ($15). This is another Right Bank offering with plum and cherry elements and a hint of leather. Composed of 80 percent cabernet franc, this wine was our favorite.\n\nHere are two other inexpensive Bordeaux from the current 2019 vintage:\n\nMadame de Beaucaillou 2019 ($25). Using grapes entirely from the Haut-Medoc, this wine from Ducru-Beaucaillou has spirited fresh cherry and currant flavors.\n\nMargaux de Brane 2019 ($25). From Henri Lurton of Brane-Catenac, this vibrant, merlot-driven wine has youthful red fruit character and worth every penny.\n\nDough Wines\n\nDough Wines is a part of the Distinguished Wines’ collection assembed by several wine growers that includes Markham, Argyle, MacRostie and Textbook. We were unfamiliar with the reasonably priced Dough Wines brand but excited to share our impression.\n\nDough Wines Chardonnay North Coast, California 2020 ($18). This is a very well-made balanced chardonnay featuring pineapple and citrus notes and a hint of spice. Very reasonably priced.\n\nDough Wines Pinot Noir Oregon 2021 ($22). A beautifully crafted Oregon pinot noir that offers a bit more fruit than many pinot noirs. Sweet and tart cherries are balanced in this friendly wine.\n\nDough Wines Cabernet Sauvignon North Coast California 2019 ($22). This wine features a cornucopia of fruit notes. Cherry, berry, plum and even a hint of mocha all combines to create a very drinkable wine.\n\nWine picks\n\nArgle Spirit Hill Vineyard Blanc de Noirs 2019 ($60). Composed of 85 percent pinot noir and 15 percent pinot meunier, this sparkling wine from one of the most respected producers in the Willamette Valley scores big with freshness and depth. Aged entirage for 43 months, it has a lot of boldness with bright cherry and grapefruit flavors and a hint of spice.\n\nYalumba The Y Series Pinot Noir South Australia 2022 ($15). A nice surprise from Australia that’s not known for its pinot noir production. Strawberry with a bit of cranberry is present with very soft tannins. A bigger style of pinot noir than many but a very pleasing package.\n\nAnakena Nuna Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon Chile 2020 ($12-15). A terrific value for the quality of this fine wine. A very serious wine that proffers plum and cherry notes and easy drinking moderate tannins.\n\nGaja Sito Moresco Langhe 2019 ($55). Everything Angelo Gaja touches turns to gold and this simple yet serious nebbiolo from Piedmont sports cherry and raspberry flavors.\n\nPoggio al Tesoro Sondraia Bolgheri Superiore 2019 ($90). Who says Italian wine producers can’t make great wine using the noble grapes of France? This blend of cabernet sauvignon (65 percent), merlot and cabernet franc show off youthful, bright dark fruit with richness and complexity. It will age for another decade but tastes great now with beef.\n\nMacRostie Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir 2022 ($38). This reasonably priced pinot noir is nice to just sip by itself, but its generous black cherry, plum and cranberry notes give it great depth to match with a wide range of foods.\n\nMiraval Provence Rosé 2022 ($21). Despite the acrimoniously split between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt that engulfed this estate, the Miraval continues to outperform in the rosé category. A lively blend of cinsault, grenache, syrah and rolle, this juicy wine has copious citrus the strawberry notes.\n\nChateau St. Jean Los Carneros Chardonay 2021 ($43). The cool winds off San Pablo Bay provides a long and improved growing season for chardonnays from the Carneros. We enjoy them for their richness and elegance but also for this one’s tropical fruit mineral flavors.\n\nComing up with the right words to describe a wine\n\nFebruary 19, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nWhen we began to seriously taste wines in the 1980s we found ourselves grasping for descriptors. We understood elements like tannin and body, but the difference between cranberry and cherry eluded us. It turns out we weren’t the only ones swirling wine in our glasses and struggling for the right words to describe it.\n\nNot until the 1970s did wine tasters, including wine makers, derive a system to put to paper what the palate was telling us. Ann Noble, now a legend in creating a wine aroma wheel, realized the need for a wine lexicon while teaching a class at University of California at Davis. Few students were able to express what was in the glass, so she listed more than a hundred items in the house that could offer help. Most of these descriptors involved food. From there, she developed the ubiquitous wheel that narrows the decision from, say, stone fruit to white peach. We used the wheel a lot in our early years, but there were descriptors like quince and red currants we could not pick up because we never tasted them.\n\nAnyone who wants to be able to describe a wine needs to spend time in the kitchen. We knew one professional who asked her daughter to pick a dried herb and let her smell it while she closed her eyes and tried to recognize it. It was a terrific method to identify rosemary, sage, thyme, basil and other herbs commonly found in wine. The same goes for fruit – can you blindly distinguish between an apricot and a peach without tasting them? What about a red cherry from a black cherry?\n\nWine enthusiasts often ask, for instance, if the olive flavor in a cabernet sauvignon means olives were added. We know that sounds stupid, but the question lends to the confusion of how a wine made from grapes can taste of olives. The general explanation is that the flavor reminds us of olives because that is what our palates have recorded over the years.\n\nWe have a friend who worked around trucks who couldn’t describe wine if his life depended on it, but he guessed right when he said an Alsace riesling smelled of petrol. Diesel fuel was part of his daily life.\n\nIn more recent years professional wine tasters have found that there is actually a science to some of these terms. In other words, there sometimes are chemicals that are shared by wine and fruit or vegetable. That petrol smell, in fact, is a chemical compound called TDN.\n\nPerhaps a better example is pyrazines, a class of compounds commonly found in plant-based foods, particularly green pepper and bell pepper. They explain why some cabernet sauvignons are often described as having a bell pepper flavor. Pyrazines are in grape skins as well. Once considered a flaw, many people like the additional layer of flavors in moderation.\n\nWe happen to like a particular cru bourgeois from Bordeaux that is known for its green pepper notes, but some critics consider it a flaw.\n\nScientists have found other compounds that help explain why a wine smells or tastes a certain way. For instance, we often find vanilla in oaked chardonnay and freshly mowed grass in the aromas of New Zealand sauvignon blanc. It turns out those elements come from aldehydes.\n\nThere also are additives intended to mask a wine’s flaw that in turn introduce new flavors that are not natural to the grape. You probably like that cheap red wine because the wine producer has added Mega Purple or another grape concentrate that makes a wine smooth and sweet. Its dials back raging acidity and underripe grapes, plus it appeals to America’s Coca-Cola palate. It is estimated that every botte costing less than $20 have been laced with grape concentrate. That’s what allows big producers to make an appealing wine without the added expense of choosing only the best grapes and fermenting them in expensive oak barrels. But you won’t find this on the label or in the winemaker’s tasting notes.\n\nYou don’t have to be a scientist to enjoy wine, of course. Many of you don’t want to bother with descriptions. But those of you who enjoy the challenge should experiment if you want to learn more. See if you can pick a cheap chardonnay from an expensive one. Smell a sprig of rosemary and see if you can pick up the herb. It’s the best way to learn.\n\nSt. Supery\n\nSt. Supery has been producing remarkable wines in Napa Valley for decades. We particularly like its sauvignon blancs which take this grape variety to a new level. But we also enjoy the red wines from this producer. Here are a few we recently tried:\n\nSt. Supery Dollarhide Sauvignon Blanc 2022 ($40). Creamier on the palate than most sauvignon blancs, this perennial favorite of ours has varietal grapefruit and citrus notes but with a dollop of pear to give it more dimension.\n\nSt. Supery Cabernet Sauvignon 2019 ($58). Blackberry, raspberry and plum notes with a dash of oak and black pepper.\n\nSt. Supery Rutherford Merlot 2019 ($70). Classic plum notes with interesting hints of cocoa powder, pepper and dried herbs.\n\nWine picks\n\nTrivento White Malbec 2023 ($11). Wow, this was a nice surprise. You probably have tasted red malbec from Argentina, but this is a bold experiment in using the grape to make a white wine. By picking the grapes early to retain acidity and pressing them immediately to avoid skin contact, the wine is clear. This wine is tart, crisp and remarkable for its green apple flavor with a touch of effervescence.\n\nBinomio Montepulciano d’Abruzzo DOC Riserva 2019 ($52). We loved this dense, concentrated and delicious gem made from an ancient biotype of montepulciano called the “Africa clone.” Ripe dark fruit flavors are easy to enjoy now, but this wine can age.\n\nCanvasback Red Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon 2020 ($44). Napa Valley’s Duckhorn added this Washington state property to its impressive portfolio in 2012. Winemaker Joseph Czarny has crafted a powerful wine with firm tannins and complexity from mountain fruit. Merlot and malbec are blended with 82 percent cabernet sauvignon to form a bordeaux-esque blend with plum and black cherry flavors and hints of spice, mineral and black currants.\n\nMore to southern Rhone than Chateauneuf du Pape\n\nFebruary 12, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nMost people who think of southern Rhone Valley think first of Chateauneuf du Pape, but for us we think first of the eight other crus that represent better values. Don’t get us wrong: we have collected Chateauneuf du Papes for decades and are still drinking the fabulous 2007s. But for current drinking, we turn to the wines from Gigondas, Vacqueyras, Rasteau and Cotes du Rhone.\n\nSouthern Rhone is mostly flat, but the wines from Gigondas are from vineyards on a slope as high as 1,000 feet, which provides the grapes a longer matura"
