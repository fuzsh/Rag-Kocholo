Arc’s role in the $71 million landmark project was the relocation and upgrade of the existing level crossing on Stock Road. The project has created a 4.3-kilometre connection between Great Northern Highway and Tonkin Highway. The upgraded Stock Road – which opened on Thursday, 7 September – features a bridge over Ellen Brook stream, upgraded rail crossing with boom gates, five T-intersections and a roundabout at Great Northern Highway. This significant piece of transport infrastructure creates new opportunities for development in the Bullsbrook industrial areas, and is set to unlock significant economic potential. Third Party Project Lead Justin Rapp said the project had involved the hard work of a number of teams. “I want to acknowledge everyone involved at Arc, especially Third Party Projects, Midwest Region, engineering, and signalling teams for their fantastic work. “The role of our Third Party Projects team is to engage with key stakeholders such as the City of Swan, and facilitate or support their key projects however we can. “We have more projects in the pipeline with the City of Swan and we welcome opportunities to take a collaborative approach and achieve great outcomes for the community,” said Mr Rapp. The Australian Government provided $16.67 million in funding to make the project a reality.

In this guide I will walk you through the do’s and don’ts of craps etiquette. Let’s get started! 1. Never Hand Cash to the Dealer In a game of craps, it’s important to remember that you should never hand cash directly to the dealer. This isn’t a personal slight, but rather a standard casino rule. If you want to buy-in, wait for a pause between rolls, place your cash on the table, make eye contact with the dealer, and say, “Change, please.” 2. Keep the Dice Visible When you’re the shooter (the person rolling the dice), always keep the dice visible. Don’t remove them from the table or hide them from the dealer. This is to ensure fair play and maintain the integrity of the game. 3. Don’t Buy-in During a Roll Never attempt to buy-in or exchange cash for chips when the shooter has the dice. Wait for the dealer to indicate when it’s okay to place bets and when you should not. If you’re playing, ensure the dealer confirms any bet you’re trying to place before the shooter rolls the dice. 4. Respect the Pace of the Game As the shooter, you control the pace of the game. When it’s your turn, just shoot the dice. Avoid unnecessary delays, such as blowing on the dice, which can also spread germs. If you don’t feel like shooting, you can always “pass right” and let the next player take their turn. 5. Passing Right If you don’t want to shoot, it’s perfectly acceptable to pass the dice to the player on your right. To do this, open your hand with the dice in your palm and indicate them towards the next player in a clockwise manner. 6. Hands High When the dealer says, “Hands high” or “the dice are out”, lift your hands off the table. This ensures you’re not interfering with the play and the dice can be passed to the shooter without obstruction. 7. Be Respectful to Other Players Good manners are essential at the craps table. Avoid hanging your hands over the edge of the rail or resting drinks on the rail. Excessive drinking can lead to disruptive behavior, so it’s best to drink responsibly. Keep the table clean and free from drinks and cigarette ashes. 8. Ask the Dealer for Help If you’re unsure about the different bets or any aspect of the game, feel free to ask the dealer for help. However, don’t rely on the dealer to coach you throughout the game. The craps table can get crowded, and dealers need to focus on managing the game. 9. Don’t Forget to Tip Tipping the dealer is a common courtesy, regardless of whether you win or lose. Never hand a dealer money directly. Instead, place money or chips on the table for tipping purposes and clearly state what the money is for. You can also place a bet for your dealer as a tip. Craps is an exciting and engaging game that brings together people from all walks of life. Understanding and practicing proper craps etiquette not only enhances your gaming experience but also contributes to a friendly and respectful atmosphere at the table. Remember, the goal is to have fun and enjoy the game. By following these craps etiquette guidelines, you’ll be able to participate in the game smoothly, make new friends, and create memorable experiences. So, whether you’re a seasoned player or a newbie, step up to the craps table with confidence and respect, and let the good times roll!\n\n{ \"date\": 1708884006000, \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2024-10\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947474641.34/warc/CC-MAIN-20240225171204-20240225201204-00797.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.899060607, \"token_count\": 839, \"url\": \"https://www.artofcraps.com/craps-basics/craps-etiquette/\" }\n\nBelow is an extract from a web page.

After easing his pace near the end, the Finn crossed the finish line 7.2 seconds ahead of reigning double world champion Fernando Alonso. The Spaniard's rookie McLaren teammate, Lewis Hamilton, completed his impressive debut weekend with a podium. Hamilton was one of the stars of a race that saw most of the action take place behind the leaders. The Briton, fourth on the grid, jumped to third at the start as Alonso was forced to back off and dropped to P4 while fighting with Nick Heidfeld's BMW for second place. At the end of trouble-free first lap - Anthony Davidson's Super Aguri seemed to stall at the start, but the former Honda tester was able to continue -Raikkonen already led Heidfeld by 1.2sec, with Hamilton, Alonso, Robert Kubica in the second BMW, Renault's Giancarlo Fisichella, Red Bull's Mark Webber and Toyota's Ralf Schumacher rounding out the top-eight. Raikkonen's teammate Felipe Massa gained four spots at the start, moving up to 18th. The Brazilian had started last, after qualifying 16th due to gearbox problems, then losing 10 grid spots with an engine-change penalty. Despite being on hard tires versus Heidfeld's soft compound - as a novelty in the 2007 regulations, drivers are obligated to use both tire variations during the race - Raikkonen had no trouble in pulling away from the German in a rate of over half a second per lap. By the time Heidfeld kicked off the first round of pitstops for the frontrunners, on lap 14, he trailed Raikkonen by over eight seconds. Before that, however, Christijan Albers had the dubious honor of being the first driver to retire in the 2007 season, and in a bizarre manner. The Dutch driver missed a braking zone inexplicably, crashing his Spyker against the tire barriers. Afterwards, Albers admitted he got distracted while adjusting the car's radio. Meanwhile Massa's recovery drive came to a halt when he reached the 16th spot and the Hondas of Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello. The Briton, with a heavy fuel load, slowed down both Brazilians for eight laps before being overtaken by Barrichello on lap 14 and by Massa two laps later. Catch up on the latest Formula 1 developments each month in RACER. Check out our look at how Kimi Raikkonen settled in at Ferrari over the winter in our April issue, on sale now! Raikkonen pitted early, on the 18th lap, giving Hamilton the opportunity to lead five laps on his maiden race. The rookie came in on the 23rd, one lap after teammate Alonso, and the top-three positions remained unchanged. Heidfeld was the biggest loser in the initial round of stops, dropping to fifth, behind teammate Kubica. Massa, for his part, didn't pit until the 29th of 58 laps, giving away a one-stop strategy to make up for the lost time. Button's miserable weekend continued in the meantime, with the Honda man being awarded a drive-through penalty for pitlane speeding. On the same lap, American Scott Speed, who ran as high as 17th, had to park his Toro Rosso after an off due to tire problems. Eight laps later, Kubica's fine run came to an end when he drove his BMW into the garage with gearbox problems, an issue that had plagued the Swiss-German team all through winter testing. Another top-team newbie wasn't having as much of a stellar run: after a couple of brief offs, Renault's Heikki Kovalainen spun but managed to rejoin on lap 41. Also spinning on lap 44, when the second round of pit stops was under way, was local favorite Mark Webber, who managed the feat while entering the pits. The Australian lost time, but was able to continue unscathed. Ditto for Raikkonen, whose tranquil run was spiced up by a small off-road excursion on lap 47. The second round of pits produced the final main change in the order, as Alonso was able to emerge of the boxes ahead of Hamilton to gain P2. From then on, the only piece of headlining action came from a dive-bomb move by Red Bull's David Coulthard on Alex Wurz's Williams on lap 51 in a fight for the 13th spot. The Scot's overly optimistic maneuver on the inside caused both cars to touch wheels, launching DC's RB3, which just barely missed running over Wurz's helmet. Both men retired at the spot. Seven laps later, Raikkonen crossed the finish line for his first win since 2005. Heidfeld rallied to finish fourth, ahead of Fisichella, who fended off a last-gasp attack by Massa, the Brazilian's one-stop strategy paying off with a P6 finish. Williams' Nico Rosberg and Ralf Schumacher in the Toyota took the remaining Australian GP points. \"It wasn't as easy as it seemed, but we had a plan and followed it,\" Raikkonen said. \"\" We pushed hard on the opening laps and the car was perfect all day long. It's an excellent start to our season.\" Despite the defeat, Alonso was upbeat with the eight points hauled from Albert Park: \"We need to work harder if we are to win races, but we made the max out of the circumstances,\" the Spaniard felt. \"I had to focus on Heidfeld at the start and left room for Lewis to go, and that cost us. But it was a good fight.\" An elated Hamilton, the first black driver to achieve the pinnacle of motorsport, celebrated a debut that, a couple of minor offs during the race aside, was nearly impeccable: \"Leading was fantastic, a fantastic feeling really. It was tough to have the champion behind me, but the team did an incredible job getting the car ready in the off-season. I don't know what happened on the second stop, I felt like it was a good stop, but in all it was a great experience.\" The 2007 Formula 1 season resumes in three weeks' time with the Malaysian GP. The teams will arrive at the Kuala Lumpur venue one week before for a series of open tests. 2007 Australian Grand Prix results.\n\n{ \"date\": 1708883760000, \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2024-10\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947474641.34/warc/CC-MAIN-20240225171204-20240225201204-00797.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.9686005712, \"token_count\": 1390, \"url\": \"https://www.askmen.com/cars/news_60/67_news.html\" }\n\nBelow is an extract from a web page.

Maintaining good oral health impacts your body’s overall health, so it’s important to know you can regularly access dental health services that are covered by a good insurance plan. Like any service or product, though, there are many options to choose from in the marketplace and it can be tricky to know which dental benefits plan is best for you. A good place to start is understanding the basics of dental insurance. Determine your dental care needs The first consideration is to determine your needs. If you are single and younger in age, the best dental plan for you will differ from that of a married couple with several children. Cost of the dental insurance plan you choose will be determined by the type of plan that is chosen. While premiums for dental insurance are generally lower compared to conventional health insurance, dental plans generally cover 80% of costs on basic procedures such as treating cavities, removing teeth, and root canals. More serious procedures such as crowns and treatment of gum disease may only have 50% of costs covered. Most plans do cover 100% of preventative procedures such as teeth cleanings and X-rays. Three Types of Dental Insurance Plans - Indemnity or fee-for-service plans are generally the most expensive type of coverage. They will offer the largest network of dental providers to choose from and insurers will generally put a cap on the costs they’ll cover for certain procedures. Additionally, it’s not uncommon for the patient to pay the entire cost for a procedure and then file a claim with the insurer, which will provide reimbursement upon approval of the claim. - Preferred provider organizations (PPO) are one of the most common types of plans available and feature a network of dentists who negotiate fees with the insurer, resulting in lower out-of-pocket fees for the patient. Patients are able to use a dentist outside of the established network of providers, but there is usually a higher cost. - Health maintenance organizations (HMO) are similar to PPOs in that dentists join a network of providers to provide services at reduced costs. However, in an HMO the networks are usually much smaller within a constrained geographic footprint. In some cases, there may be out-of-network services these plans will allow you to access at a reduced cost. While these are generally the cheapest dental insurance plans available, they are also the most limited. Accessing dental insurance plans Most people have access to dental insurance through their employer, however, insurance can also be secured through group coverage programs that might include the Affordable Care Act Marketplace or government programs such as Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The alternative to group coverage plans is purchasing an individual plan, which can be more expensive. These plans can also be more limited in the type of procedures that are covered and there’s sometimes a waiting period of anywhere between a few months to a year before major procedures will be covered. When considering an individual dental plan, it may also be worth implementing a Health Savings Account (HSA), which can be used to set aside funds to cover costs of procedures that the plan may not cover. Regardless of the dental insurance plan chosen, it is important to check on whether it is accepted by your dentist. If the plan is an HMO or PPO, it’s also important to determine if the dentist is within the network of those plans.

Pro-LGBT formed in 2010 to promote and advocate for the advancement of LGBT rights in Albania. The two organizations work frequently and closely together, Aleanca working to build a strong base of LGBTQ people and activists, and Pro-LGBT serving as a watchdog and ‘public relations’ branch of the LGBT movement in Albania. Both organizations worked together to pass a national anti-discrimination law in 2010 and subsequent establishment of the Commissioner for Protection from Discrimination as the institution responsible for ensuring effective implementation of the law. Jointly they also formed “STREHA,” the first residential center in Albania that supports homeless LGBTQ youth 18-25 years old. STREHA also offers other services, life skills courses, and other leadership opportunities. Both organizations are actively involved in advocacy for inclusive laws and policies. Jointly they also formed “STREHA,” the first residential center in Albania that supports homeless LGBTQ youth 18-25 years old. STREHA also offers other services, life skills courses and other leadership opportunities. “Streha” shelter is the first non-public residential center in Southern Eastern Europe, which helps the LGBTI community in emergency of housing and accommodation. It started as a pilot project of Alliance against LGBT Discrimination in collaboration with United ProLGBT Cause organizations since opening its door in December 2014. Since November 2015 “Streha” is active as an independent NGO. This shelter is a concrete transition service for all LGBTI young people from age 18 to 25 that face violence and discrimination from family and/or local community (usually at the stage of coming out) making their life impossible to live. Cases under 18 years old and over 25 years old are subject of consideration of a case by case basis based on the assessment of the professional staff at the Shelter. Streha provides services of reintegration to at risk homeless LGBT through 8 staff members, in total 24 hours, 7 days a week. “Streha” shelter has a capacity of eight beds and aims to be a service and assistance to at risk homeless LGBTI youth at national level. A multidisciplinary team of the “Streha” shelter makes the initial assessment of each case, case by case and accepts the requirement for housing in the “Streha” shelter based on a clear protocol and very rigorous, designed in accordance with national standards with the assistance of USAID and Assist Impact, of the existing shelters in Albania and especially with the assistance of the shelters network of “Albert Kennedy Trust” in Great Britain that works since 1989. Streha has professional staff to serve the LGBTI Community beyond Albania based on case management treated so far.\n\n{ \"date\": 1708885397000, \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2024-10\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947474641.34/warc/CC-MAIN-20240225171204-20240225201204-00797.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.9601065516, \"token_count\": 578, \"url\": \"https://www.astraeafoundation.org/location/albania/\" }\n\nBelow is an extract from a web page.

When the What happens when a client asks to create or design that is something out of this world? Something that has never been done before. That people have never experienced. When the real world is insufficient, we turn to worlds beyond our imagination. We turn to fictional worlds – books, films, anime, manga, video games, comics, and everything in between. For these worlds to become creatively useful, beyond inspiration, we must find ways to benchmark and compare them with our own. - Where do you look for never-before-seen, never-before-done experiences, designs and creativity? - What is the use of fictional worlds in the creative process? - How do you compare the impossible worlds of fiction with our own and how do you find value in doing it? - What do strange contexts tell us about incentives, storytelling and user experience?

Has the stress of a new school year got you reaching for that extra glass of Rosé or pint of beer? We totally understand how 2020 may have seen an increase in your alcohol consumption. Does your Uber Eats driver see you more than their own family? Zoom calls, bubble busting anti-maskers, neck kinks from looking down at social distancing arrows. This year has been a bitch. And to get through it we have been tipping back a lot of delicious, frothy beverages. Sometimes it’s the idea of indulging that settles your brain. Knowing in that first sip you are going to get a hit of hops, a sparkle of citrus, or a burst of barley. You don’t have to miss out on that if you are looking to dial it back this Fall. Beer can still be enjoyed without the warm buzz and fuzzy brain. If you love the actual taste of beer as much as I do I have the perfect substitute; Partake Brewing. Partake is the leading non-alcoholic craft beer brand in Canada. No, this isn’t your big breweries lightened up version of their already incredibly light beer. This is craft to its core. Focused on providing a healthy alternative Partake Brewing doesn’t skimp on flavour either. If you are trying their IPA, they want you to taste an IPA. With five styles there is an option for everyone. Starting with the lightest in the group this ale is perfect for beginners. Lots of bread, grain and slight citrus notes on the palate. Light, crisp and refreshing. When I drink a red ale I expect to taste lots of caramel, brown sugar, nuts and dried fruit like figs and prune. This beer doesn’t disappoint. With its clear and copper hue you will quickly forget you are not drinking a full-strength beer. A classic American style, this beer pours deep gold and surprises you with lots of depth in flavour. Resinous, citrusy and floral on the taste buds with a bright finish. IPA drinkers are a fickle bunch. This version will gain many fans. Punchy with bright aromatic and bittering hops like the classic Citra, Cascade and Amarillo you get bursts of orange, honey sweetness and the pithiness of grapefruit all IPA lovers expect to find. Dark chocolate, coffee, a little nuttiness and smokiness Partake Stout is a dark beer lover’s dream. Still full-bodied and creamy this is the perfect sipper on a cool summer evening. You don’t have to give up alcohol to enjoy non-alcoholic choices. Sometimes we just need a break. And having a variety of choices in your fridge for your abstaining friends or those who can’t drink makes you a great hang. Especially with choices like Partake Brewing.\n\n{ \"date\": 1708882520000, \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2024-10\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/segments/1707947474641.34/warc/CC-MAIN-20240225171204-20240225201204-00797.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.9350915551, \"token_count\": 600, \"url\": \"https://www.auburnlane.com/taking-a-break-with-partake/\" }\n\nBelow is an extract from a web page.

Articles published August 4, 2020 by Ben Killion Outdated software, network outages, and data breaches are only a few of the potential tech issues that threaten to dismantle your business’s IT infrastructure and decrease productivity. An investment in a comprehensive managed IT solution, like Aureon ProCare, helps avoid these and other network disruptions before they happen. Moving to this type of automation-based system can save you time and money. Reactive Versus Proactive IT Support Solutions A business that operates with a reactive IT support mindset does not respond to problems until they happen. For instance, if your network goes down and you call someone to come fix it that is reactive care. It may take hours to solve the problem and in the meantime, you’re losing money. A business that operates with a proactive IT support mindset invests in 24/7 network monitoring and automated services that ensure IT systems stay patched, updated, and secure. The focus is on detecting and defending against security threats for PCs and network issues before they happen. What Should You Look for in a solution like ProCare? While all businesses can benefit from proactive monitoring and maintenance, identifying the maturity level of your IT infrastructure may help determine what kind of support you need. Common features for this type of solution that provide benefits for any size organization include: - Network monitoring and proactive maintenance of key network points - Automated patching to keep your systems current - Responsive remote and onsite IT support options - Secure data backup and disaster recovery - Comprehensive network security solutions Aureon ProCare combines 24/7 network monitoring and maintenance with innovative backup and security technologies to monitor your IT infrastructure and designated devices. The scalable service options allow you to select the level of cybersecurity support your organization needs. How Can ProCare Benefit Your Business? An investment in ProCare-type technology provides several direct and indirect benefits that will increase IT system efficiencies and boost your bottom line. Here are a few highlights. 1. Enhanced Security Network security should be top of mind for any business, regardless of industry. Proactive IT support typically involves the deployment of antivirus protection and data encryption technology. Network security solutions may include firewall management, content filtering, and intrusion protection. Secure cloud backup and disaster recovery offer advanced protection. 2. Increased Productivity Modern businesses rely on technology to stay competitive. Most of your employees cannot even perform their jobs without a stable network connection. If your network goes down unexpectedly, a remote or onsite team who is already familiar with your IT infrastructure will work to quickly find a solution. Less downtime ensures that employees can get back to work and stay productive. 3. Better Planning Because your network is being monitored and maintained around-the-clock, there is less of a chance for unexpected IT expenses to occur that can easily derail your annual budget. Reporting options on technology performance provide accurate records of where your IT infrastructure stands. They will also help you plan your IT budget for the next fiscal year to achieve your goals. Don’t Get Caught Off Guar"
