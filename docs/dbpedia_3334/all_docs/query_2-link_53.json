        "text": "“Reach out with the little you have and see whether it will not multiply…”\n\nThe Bible says that every man has received something from God that is capable of being planted.\n\nRemember, we should see giving as a reason for our relationship, just as we see receiving as a reason for our relationship as well. Luke 6:38 says that giving is the beginning of receiving. If you give in truth, you are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to you. So, as you give to the Lord, we pray that God will open the windows of heaven and pour out for you such blessings that you will not be able to contain it (Malachi 3:6-10).\n\nReach out with the little you have and see whether it will not multiply!\n\nIf you would like to plant into the ministry of The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations and join us in our aim to reach out and touch millions of lives through the Word of God – the Gospel of Jesus Christ, please follow these instructions:\n\nTO MAKE A MONTHLY DONATION:\n\nTO MAKE A ONE TIME OFFERING: ACCOUNT NUMBER ( )\n\nTO MAKE A BANK WIRE TRANSFER:\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SEED. STAY IN FAITH IN HIM!\n\nLike Loading...\n\nTemitope Balogun Joshua (born June 12, 1963), commonly referred to as T. B. Joshua, is a Nigerian Pastor, televangelist and philanthropist.
