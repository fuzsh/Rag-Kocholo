        "text": "ABRAMOVIC, JOHN Basketball-Military-Business\n\nJohn, or \"Brooms\" as everyone knew him, made a tremendous mark in the basketball world. As a junior and senior at Salem College in West Virginia (1942-1943), he led the entire nation in scoring. He averaged nearly 30 points per game, which was unheard of at that time. He made First Team All American in 1942 and 1943 and still holds the Salem College record of most points in a game (57), and in the season (777). He was the first player In college history to score 2,000 points in a career. After spending three years in the Navy during World War 11, he signed and went on to play professional basketball for several teams in the National Basketball League, and the Basketball Association of America. These two leagues formed the National Basketball Association (NBA) the year after \"Brooms\" retired. He was inducted into the West Virginia and the Pennsylvania Sports Halls of Fame. In addition to his basketball career, John played professionai baseball and also was an avid golfer and bowler during his lifetime. He was also a high school and college basketball referee. He was very involved in coaching, and raising his two children. He was a school board member for six years with the Mars, Pensylvania area school district, and he was a parttime scout for the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball organization. John \"Brooms\" Abramovic, Jr., 81, died on June 9, 2000 at Memorial Hospital-Ormond, FL. He was a lifelong member of Guardian Angel Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge 4, Etna, Pennsylvania. At the time of his death he had been a member for 63 years. John moved to Ormond Beach with his wife, Jessie, in 1981, after retiring from his family business, Etna Broom and Mop Mfg. Co., which he owned and operated with his brothers. He worked as a starter at Riverbend Golf Club for a number of years. He is survived by his loving wife, Bessie; son, John III and daughter-in-law, Cindy, Ormond Beach; daughter, Wendy and son-in-law, David McFadden, Ormond Beach; stepdaughter, Jeanne Russell, Boyton Beach; and four grandchildren, Andrew Ehrman, Ormond Beach, Christie and Jonathan IV Abramovic- Ormond Beach, and Anna Sultety of Boyton; three brothers, William of Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Joseph and Albert, both of O'Hara Township, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was preceded in death by his parents, John and Dorothy Frketic Abramovic.\n\nABRAMOVICH, ROKO Tamburitza Hall of Fame\n\nRoko Abramovich, musician, technician, and arranger, was born in Eureka, Utah, on August 15, 1909. He spent the next 18 years of his life with relatives back in Croatia, and came to Chicago area around 1927. In Chicago, Roko mastered the farkash brac, and played with the \"Selacka Stranka\" orchestra, under the direction of Aloise Jaksa. All of the other tambura instruments were added to his credits in the next years to come, and for a time Roko played with the Rotkovich family, filling in on the bugaria. During the war, Roko filled in a number of times on bugaria, for Louie Kapugi also. For a few years he was a member of the old Yavor Orchestra, and played with the likes of the late Vaso Bukvich, and people like John Krilcich, Steve Vucinic, Tom Stefancic, and Elizabeth Plasay. Later in the forties and fifties, Roko played with the Dave Zupkovich Orchestra, where he featured on the prima. For those avid collectors of the old 78 records, it is Roko who plays the lead in unforgettables like Daniela, Cudo Jada, and the note perfect Caralama Kolo. In those years, Roko played with Ernie Maty, Carl Schutzman, Steve Paulich in the Neven Orchestra also. Later in the fifties and sixties we find him merging with Nick Skertich to form the ever popular Veseljaci Orchestra, whose members from time to time have been Mickey Kusecek, Ray Jankovich, Bucky Bukvich, and Ray Ratz. Roko was married to the late Mary Bertovic in May 1934, and from that marriage they were blessed with two beautiful daughters, Ann Marie and Marlene. Retired from the Steel Mills, but not from music, Roko continues to contribute to the tamburitza field by teaching two junior groups, the Chicago Juniors of the Croatian Fraternal Union, and the Sacred Heart Juniors of South Chicago. He continues to fill in with the Veseljaci Orchestra from time to time, and enjoys spending most of his time with his six grandchildren. Roko has and will always be known to Chicagoans as \"Mr. Brac.\"\n\nABRANOVIC, ANTHONY Military-News\n\nHe was born November 4, 1909, in Croatia, to Anton and Mary (Yankovic) Abranovic. Tony was a U.S. Army veteran of WW 11. He started \"Kittanning News\" in 1949, and retired in 1980 when he turned the business over to his two sons, Mark and Anthony.

He came to this country in 1912. A fisherman, he followed this profession, first in the State of Washington, later moving to San Pedro. He married Milica, nee Lucev, and they had seven children. During his fishing career, Jerko was the owner of several fishing boats, and fished from Alaska to Mexico.\n\nAGICH, PAVAO Tamburitza\n\nBorn in Djakovo, Croatia in 1873. He was a barber and founder of Croatian Singing Club \"Preradovich\" in Djakovo, Croatia. He had traveled with tamburitza orchestras all over Germany in the period from 1902-1903. He has worked for several years as a barber in London, British Columbia and in Portland, Oregon. He lived in San Francisco since 1914 and was a member and manager of the Croatian Tamburitza Orchestra in San Francisco. He is also an active member of Knights of Columbus organization.\n\nALAGA, GAJA Scientist\n\nOne of our best theoretical physicists was Prof. Gaja Alaga (1924-1988). He worked not only in Zagreb, Croatia, but also at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, University of California, Berkeley, and Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich.\n\nALAGA, NICHOLAS FBI Agent-Attorney\n\nNicholas Alaga was born May 21, 1912 in Watsonville, California. His field is Law, and is a graduate of the University of Santa Clara. He received his LL.B. in 1937 from Stanford University. He was a special agent in the FBI and currently practices law in San Francisco. He is presently residing in San Francisco, and is a member of the Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI.\n\nALAGA, NICHOLAS N. Apple Grower and Packer\n\nAn extensive shipper of apples, who is also his own grower and packer, is Nicholas N. Alaga, of 114 Maple avenue, Watsonville. Like many others in this locality, he was born in Dalmatia, Croatia February 18, 1874, his parents being Nicholas and Mary Lettunich. Nicholas N. Alaga had rather a hard time acquiring his education after he had gone through the lower grades of the home schools, but has gained a good knowledge of affairs since coming to the United States at the age of seventeen years. After spending two years in San Francisco he went to Santa Clara valley, where he lived a similar length of time. On the 14th of July, 1894, Mr. Alaga came to Watsonville and went to work for his uncle, Mr. Lettunich, acting as his foreman for some time. Having saved a little money he then embarked in business for himself as a buyer and shipper of fruit in 1898. From this small start, Mr. Alaga has attained to his present prosperity. He is a member of the Chamber of Commerce and is a third degree Knight of Columbus and a member of the Austrian Benevolent Society. Mr. Alaga was married in 1911 to Miss Teresa Farlan, a native of Eureka, Humboldt county, California, and they have two sons, Nicholas Jr., and Lloyd.\n\nALUJEVICH, ANTON Boilermaker\n\nAnton was born in Split, Dalmatia in 1887.

His wife Franka, nee Poklepovich and Anton taught their daughters Bozica (Nathalie) and Madeline to be proactive in the Croatian-American community.\n\nANCHICKS, LOUISE Army Nurse-Prisoner of War\n\nLouise M., Captain Army nurse Retired., WWI and II, died in Palo Alto on October 30, 1977; beloved wife of Eli S. PrudHomme; loving sister of Dorothy Smith of Riverside, Illinois and Earl Anschichs of Dowers Grove, Illinois; also survived by neices and nephews; a 52 year member of American Legion, a member of Nurses Post No. 452; served at Bataan and Corregidor, Prisoner of War, P.O.W., Santa Tomas prison three years.\n\nANCICH, JOHN Fisherman\n\nThere arent many people left in Gig Harbor, Washington who can do what John Ancich Sr. can with thin knotted rope. Practitioners of the maritime art of net-mending  once found in nearly every harbor home  are now scarce. But when commercial fishing dominated the community, that skill was standard. Understanding the subtleties of sea nature was once a standard-issue skill for most locals. Now only a slim fraction of the Peninsula populace could have accomplished the specialized repair job the 87-year-old Ancich performed Monday on the Fishermens Memorial at Jerisich Park. Ancich, just out of the hospital following a serious fall, got wind of the damage through his community fishing contacts. He decided to mend the net on the memorial that bears the names of eight local fisherman lost at sea. The name at the top is that of his only child, John Ancich, Jr. The younger Ancich, like his dad, uncles, and grandfather, was a fisherman from the get go. They all started going out on voyages in their teens and kept at it through their lives. Thats about all I did, John Sr. said. John Sr. and his brothers Joe and Peter, both deceased, were well-known as the owner and operators of Voyager, a sardine seiner  considered one of the most productive local boats during its heyday in the 1930s, 40s and 50s, said local maritime historian Lee Makovich. John Sr. fished for nearly 60 years. His son, who skippered several of his own boats, put in about 20 years. He died from insulin shock aboard his ship, Heritage, in Hawk Inlet, Alaska, about 20 miles southwest of Juneau, two years ago yesterday, at age 36. Its been tough, said John Sr., who has no other family locally. Its been hard to take. In Gig Harbor, Ancichs maritime spirit showed itself in several venues. He became a leader in the fishing community and publicly advocated the preservation of maritime culture through art. He was among a handful of long-haul backers who made the Fishermens Memorial a reality. While working on that project, Ancich likely had the name Scott Tyree on his mind. Tyree died in 1995 aboard Courageous, a boat skippered by John Jr. that capsized in Canadian waters. He brushed aside the potential peril as simply a regular part of being a fisherman, a matter of course  like knowing how to mend a net. I patched it the best I could,  he said. I just did the best I could. (Patrick 2003)\n\nANCICH, MARTIN AND ANNA Fishermen\n\nAnna came to the United States when she was six years old in 1900. Her mother made the long journey from Croatia to her brother's home in Tacoma accompanied only by her three small daughters. She did not speak English at the time. When her husband Martin passed away, Anna Ancich had to find a way of supporting her large family. She inherited the boat, George A., which she chartered out for some years to local people. Then, in 1937, Anna took a most unexpected action. She ordered the construction of a commercial fishing boat! The vessel, a 75' sardine style purse seiner was built at the J. M. Martinac Shipyard in Tacoma. As an ongoing reminder of her initiative and enterprise, it was named the Anna A. Widows often retained ownership of a commercial fishing boat. Anna did more than that. She chartered her boat to fish processing interests in Seattle and to canneries in Alaska. She negotiated all leasing and charter contracts herself. Her skill in making these transactions was recognized and respected. At various times, her sons Antone and George operated the Anna A. for her. Under her management, the business continued to prosper. The Anna A. was sold in 1967. Anna died in 1968.\n\nANCIC, MARIO Tennis\n\nWimbledon, England: Centre Court observers were pleasantly surprised to see a 6-foot-4 Croatian, Mario Ancic, giving Roger Federer a spirited match Tuesday. Then they noticed that he actually was destroying Federer, to the tune of 6-3, 7-6, 6-3. And they realized how much the 18-year-old reminds them of Ivanisevic, last year's champion and a longtime Wimbledon favorite. Ancic is right-handed, and apparently without the eccentric sense of humor, but everything else speaks of a kid who grew up idolizing Ivanisevic. It helps that they have the same build and hail from the town of Split, Croatia and many of Ancic's mannerisms are vintage Goran. He came into the tournament as a qualifier, playing only his second tour-level match of the year. Now he's the kid who knocked off the eighth-seeded Federer, conqueror of Pete Sampras at last year's Wimbledon. In his press conference - and of course, he sounds like Ivanisevic, too - Ancic said he's been hanging around his idol for years. \"We always hit, even when I was 10,\" he said. \"We played some Davis Cup together, Olympic doubles; he has always been like my bigger brother. But Goran is Goran. I am me. I don't have the three personalities (laughter). Still one.\" 2002.\n\nANDRETTI, MARIO Wine Maker-Auto Racing\n\nMario Andretti is putting his celebrity marque on a wine bottle. Andretti, the four-time Indy 500 winner, owns 13 percent of AWG (short for Andretti Wine Group), which recently bought a bankrupt 53-acre vineyard and winery in Napa County, California and is looking for other properties. Like racing, Andretti said, theres a lot of romance to this business. Since his boyhood, Andretti has been a wine fan and has made many visits to Californias wine country. In 1994, a San Diego promotions firm called Best Regards got Louis Martini Winery to produce 15,000 cases of specially labeled Andretti cabernet sauvignon to commemorate the Arrivederci Tour, Andrettis final full season of racing. In 1995, Joseph Phelps produced 2,000 cases of Andretti chardonnay. To continue, we saw that we needed our own base of supply, said Andretti. Best Regards principals Phillip Dias and Sarla Perkins then got into the wine business. One of their plans was to convert auto-racing fans from beer to wine. Last January, Dias and Perkins merged their infant wine company with an inactive public company called American Arum Corp. Buying a shell company is a quick and easy way to go public without the other and disclosure of requirements of a full public offering. They changed the name of the company to AWG and its trading symbol to VINE. Andretti said from his office in Nazareth, Pennsylvania, that he has an eyeball on another property and wants to establish a stronger supply base. The plan is to produce $12 to $19 premium wines and even get into tours and tastings. The family name in Istria is Andretic.\n\nANDRIJASEVICH, PETER Goldminer-Saloon-Grocery\n\nPeter Andrijasevich, ( wife, Yela Mirko ) came via the Alaska goldmines. When he arrived in Aberdeen, Washington in 1904 he bought a saloon in the downtown but was unhappy there so he sold out and opened a grocery store at the corner of Curtis and West Boulevard. He was a man who believed in helping others and being active in community affairs. He played an important part in the organization of two Croatian lodges.\n\nANDRICH, LUKA Bartender-Cultural\n\nLuka, as he was called by his friends, was a pleasant member around our Slavonic Cultural Center. He attended our meetings and socials regularly and was always a pleasant person to visit with. At our January meeting he served on the election committee. Prior to his retirement he worked at Maye's Oyster House and was in the culinary trade for over 40 years. It wasn't long ago that he prepared one of our quarterly dinners. He leaves his wife Iva, daughter Kathy, son Andrea, and daughter-in-law JoAnne. We will all miss this pleasant and kindly gentleman. Luka died on March 11, 1995 in San Francisco and was born in Dalmatia, Croatia.\n\nANGELICH, MATE Bridge Builder-Auto Dealership\n\nMate \"Mike\" Angelich, aged 97, of Fort Salonga, Long Island, New York, died recently in Huntington (N. Y) Hospital. He was born September 8, 1902 in the village of Medici, Sinj, Croatia to Ante and Ruzica Andjelic. Mate came to the United States in the 1920's. One of his earliest jobs was that of a high iron worker. He was part of the construction crew that built the George Washington Bridge in New York City. He strung the suspension cables 600 feet above the Hudson River. At age 97, he was probably the last surviving member of the bridge's construction crew. He went to school in New York City to learn auto mechanics, and opened Grand Central Motors in Jackson Heights, Queens. Before permanently settling on Long Island 50 years ago he lived in Tucson, Arizona and Miami, Florida. Later, he expanded his business activities by opening Three Star Auto in Huntington, N.Y - an auto dealership that sold imported cars such as Borgwards, Daimlers, Singers and Morgans. He also owned Mike's Service Station in Northport. When he \"retired\", he began a nursery and raised thousands of beautiful azaleas, and made his own wine. He also took a strong interest in cow breeding at the family farm in New Hampshire. He was an active member ofthe Croatian New Yorker Club - where every year at the annual picnic he was responsible for the Bar-B-Que. He was one of the first people interviewed for the Croatian Fraternal Union - Croatian New Yorker Club Oral Histories Project.

Place and date: Near Cisterna di Littoria, Italy, 24 May 1944. Entered service at: St. Clairsville, Ohio, Birth: St. Clairsville, Ohio. G.O. No.: 89, 19 October 1945. Citation: Near Cisterna di Littoria, Italy, he charged 200 yards over flat, coverless terrain to destroy an enemy machinegun nest during the second day of the offensive which broke through the German cordon of steel around the Anzio beachhead. Fully 30 yards in advance of his squad, he ran into withering enemy machinegun, machine-pistol and rifle fire. Three times he was struck by bullets and knocked to the ground, but each time he struggled to his feet to continue his relentless advance. With one shoulder deeply gashed and his right arm shattered, he continued to rush directly into the enemy fire concentration with his submachinegun wedged under his uninjured arm until within 15 yards of the enemy strongpoint, where he opened fire at deadly close range, killing 2 Germans and forcing the remaining 10 to surrender. He reorganized his men and, refusing to seek medical attention so badly needed, chose to lead the way toward another strongpoint 100 yards distant. Utterly disregarding the hail of bullets concentrated upon him, he had stormed ahead nearly three-fourths of the space between strongpoints when he was instantly killed by hostile enemy fire. Antolak is probably Antoljak and many are found in Croatia.\n\nANTONOVICH, MICHAEL D. State Assemblyman\n\nCalifornias youngest and best-known Croatian-American lawmaker is Assemblyman Michael D. Antonovich of Glendale. The name Antonovich (Antunovic) is hardly new to California. The family began immigrating from the Konvali region with Florio Antunovich during the 1850s. Michael Antonovichs grandfather came from Croatia to settle in Bisbee, Arizona as a goldminer. His uncles settled in Grass Valley, Fresno and Jackson. Of all the Croatian-American lawmakers in California, none is more aware of his Croatian heritage than Antonovich. His capitol office is graced with a large Croatian shield hand crafted by Luka Biondich and a map of Dalmatia. He stays abreast of Croatian politics and is a regular speaker at Croatian celebrations throughout the state. He has traced his family back to 1700 and can relate the story of his grandparents immigration in detail. He visited Croatia in 1970 and hopes to do so again in the future. Born in southern California in 1939, Antonovich attended Los Angeles City College and California State University at Los Angeles (M.A.). He served as a student body officer for four years and was president of his graduate class and his fraternity. While his academic study progressed, he also attended the Pasadena Police Academy, graduating as a reserve officer in 1967. Even with his legislative duties, he remains a reserve police officer today. From 1966 through 1972, he served the Los Angeles School District as a government and history insructor. His concern for quality education led him to seek a position on the Los Angeles City College District Board of Trustees in 1969. Out of and original field of 139 candidates, he won with a record 406,000 votes. He later served as president of that board which directs the affairs of the eight campus, 100,000 student, 100 million dollar-per-year system. Antonovich served the Goldwater campaign in 1964 and was a regional chairman for Reagan in 1970. In 1972 he easily won his own Assembly seat. He was reelected in 1974 and in 1976 no opponent could be found to challenge him. He quickly became known as the state leader in criminal justice and pro-life legislation. In 1976, at the age of thirty-six, he was named Minority Whip of the Assembly after having been chosen Outstanding Legislator of the Year, for both the 1973-1974 ad 1974-1975 sessions.\n\nANTONOVICH, RUZA Doctor-Radiology\n\nRuza Zupan was born in Barlete, Croatia.

Anthony and his older sister Pearl, were the children of Martin and Marie Arbunich, who were from the Island of Brac, Dalmatia, Croatia. Anthonys dad owned and operated a very successful restaurant at 14th and Market street. hard work and long hours soon enabled him to purchase a little cottage situated on a knoll with a sweeping view overlooking Mission Street. This was in the year 1910 and young Tony was just a year old. three days after they moved into their new home, Martin, on his way to work and only 32 years of ago, was struck by a street car that flung him to the pavement resulting in a fatal head injury. There were relatives and new arrivals from the old country and she would rent rooms to help make ends meet. The first war came and went and in the early 1920s, Maries sister died of the dreaded flu that took so many lives. Her husband owned and operated the California Grill in Santa Rosa and Marie chose to adopt her two nephews and niece. So it was that the little cottage on Gladys Street was the home of five youngsters, Marie, and a roomer or two. It was about this time that Marie had two large bedrooms added to the cottage. The home became known as the Slavonian Depot since so many people came and stayed until they became financially set. Anthony says it was always a happy place for everyone. After high school, Pearl began working for a furrier, a line for work she followed until her recent retirement. Tony went to Fremont School and Cogswell High until his junior year whe he quit school. His very first job at the age of 16 was an apprentice butcher at the old Spreckles Market. Life long friend, Jack, Radonich, several years younger than Tony, worked there also as a wrapper. In 1936, Tony went to work for the Southern Pacific Railway, working on the maintenance crews servicing the rail cars. he held this job until his recent retirement in 1975. Marie, Tonys mother, who had cared for so many, would enjoy taking her family to Slav picnics and gatherings whenever possible. Sorrowfully, in her early 60s, Marie passed on in 1938. Tony still loved seeing his old friends and attended all the picnics and gatherings...getting on the street car to the Ferry building and taking the Ferry to Oakland, then the train to Neptune beach, John Park or the various picnic grounds and gathering places. It was at an Irish picnic at Portola Park in 1947 that Tony met the lovely lady Margaret Harte, who was to become Mrs. Peggy Arbunich. So it was, and is, Tony and Peggy have lived at the happy cottage on Gladys street raising a wonderful family of three sons, Martin, Mitchel, Mark, and one daughter, Barbara. Tony has served our society for 30 years as a trustee and the passed 30 as the chairman of the board of Trustees.\n\nARKOVICH, TONY Restaurant-Saloon\n\nTony Arkovich entered the U.S.A. in 1911 at the age of 15 years. He experienced the normal reaction of most emigrants and would have returned immediately. His first job was working as a water boy in sewer construction. After witnessing the way the men had to dig up the dirt and toss it from platform to platform, they would sweat and strain to do, so he quit. Next he went to a dairy where he wore hip boots and washed bottles all day. By the end of the day he was sopping wet, hip boots or no. He left and went to work in a restaurant. In order to save his shoes he walked to work barefoot. While sweeping the floors and cleaning the booths he often found money. This added to his income. Gradually he went up the line. While he cleaned vegetables he would watch the cooks. One of them took him under his wing and he would stay 4 or 5 hours after his shift helping him. Next he was a fry cook then the chef. In 1917 Tony Arkovich, Joe Dzaich, and Andy Leko opened Joes Cafe, 613 South Olive Street, Los Angeles. Changes come about-they moved to Bohemian Grill and Bar in 1936 at Eight and Grand. Next in 1940 they moved to Eight and Fedora. During the first move Andy Leko dropped out. Tony moved on to open the Larchmont Grill in 1948. The last move was to go into business at Nickodell Melrose with Jack Ban, Leonard Beidle, and Jack Vojkovich buying the business at Nick Slavichs retirement. He retired in 1972.\n\nARNERICH, A. J. Baseball-Alameda City Council\n\nMr. Lil Arnerich was born and raised in West Oakland and now resides in Alameda with his wife, Norma. They have four children and twelve grandchildren. Mr. Arnerich attended St. Mary's College and completed additional studies at U.C. Berkeley and San Francisco State.\n\nAfter playing six years of professional baseball with the old Oakland Oaks, Lil has had a very distinguished career in public service. He became Supervisor of Athletics for the City of Alameda Recreation and Park Department where he served 34 years until his retirement in 1986. Today, he still serves as a member of the Alameda City Council. Lil has received over fifty honors by many public and private sector groups and is truly deserving of this prestigious honor and award.\n\nARNERICH, FRANK Restaurant-Goldminer\n\nAmong the rising young men of San Jose, who have accomplished much, although young in years, is Frank N. Arnerich, who started in the restaurant business when only a lad of seventeen and now owns a place of business under the name of The Oyster Loaf Restaurant. He was born on the Island of Brac, Dalmatia, Croatia on June 11, 1888, and was the son of Nicholas and and Antoinette (Chargin) Arnerich. His father came to California in the year 1875 and settled in Amador County in 1900, joining his brother, and there attended the public schools of Amador City and later went to night school in San Francisco. Having learned the business of restaurateur in San Francisco and in San Jose, at the early age of seventeen he engaged in this line in San Jose in the year of 1905, and has continued here ever since. He engaged in business for himself and with his experience in this line, he has built up a good trade, and he has since been very successful; his up-to-date restaurant, The Oyster Loaf, being both popular among the San Joses residents and increasingly profitable to himself. Mr. Arnerichs marriage united him with Miss Lucy Chargin, who was also a native of Brac, and a sister of Joseph, Jerry, and Nicholas Chargin. They are the parents of three children-Antoinette Frances, Lawrence Nicholas, and Beverly Lucille, and the family reside at 137 North Sixth Street. Mr. Arnerich is a member of the Order of Red Men, and of the Slavonic-American Society, and San Jose and is past officer in both orders. He is a member of the Chamber of Commerce, Elks, and is a charter member of the Commercial Club.\n\nARNERICH, JAMES Attorney\n\nA graduate of the University of Santa Clara, where he was a star football player, Mr. Arnerich was appointed state director of professional and vocational standards by Governor Warren in 1946. He resigned his post in 1953 after Warren was appointed chief justice of the United States, and he went into private practice. When Mr. Arnerich retired in 1980 he was general counsel of Forest Lawn Corp. in Glendale. Mr. Arnerich was a native of Los Angeles and served for four years in the Navy in World War II. Mr. Arnerich, a retired attorney, died on Wednesday at St. Francis Memorial Hospital after suffering a heart attack. He was 73. He is survived by his wife, Rita; a daughter, Mrs. Kathleen Peck of Novato; a son, Robert Theobald of Northridge; two brothers, Paul of San Francisco and Frank of Santa Clara; a sister, Marie, of San Jose; and by five grandchildren.\n\nARNERICH, MATEO Vineyard-Farm-Goldminer\n\nMateo Arnerich was born on the island of Brac, Dalmatia, Croatia in the Adriatic Sea. In 1826, when fourteen years of age, he became a sailor boy. He followed a sea faring life for fourteen years, visiting every sea and ocean. He came from China to San Francisco in 1849, and never left the State of his adoption but once, when he went, in 1872, to visit the scenes and friends of his childhood days. From 1849 to 1852 Mateo mined for gold in the Calaveras. In 1852 Mr. Arnerich came to the Santa Clara Valley, and soon after became interested in agriculture. In May, 1856, he was united in marriage with Mrs. Elizabeth (Brown) Moylan, widow of Edward Moylan. They bought property in the Narvaze grant, and opened a farm, which they occupied for twelve years. They then found that no valid title to it could be obtained, and so left the place, and by pre-emption and purchase secured 160 acres of choice land, which constitute the present family homestead in the Union District. The ranch is located in an angle of the Santa Clara and Guadaloupe road, which bounds it on the north and east. Mr. and Mrs. Arnerich commenced life on the ranch in a comfortable house, which several years ago gave place to the substantial family residence of today. Mr. Arnerich was an active, energetic man, and carried forward the improvement of his property quite rapidly. The neighborhood lost in him a citizen actively interested in all movenents tending to the general good. His death, which occurred May 3, I883, was caused by injuries received in being thrown from a buggy, near his own home. His widow and her seven children, John, Catharine, Elizabeth, Mateo, Paul, Isabelle, and Margaret all yet making their home with their mother, are quite well provided for. Mrs. Arnerich was born in County Tipperary, Ireland, in 1831. She was nine years of age when her parents, William and Catharine Brown, emigrated to Australia, whence, after a residence of ten years, they came to San Francisco. Later they becarne pioneers of Union District. Mr. Brown's death, resulting from an accidental fall, occurred in 1854. William D. Brown, the chief of police at San Jose, is a brother of Mrs. Arnerich. The first marriage of Mrs. Arnerich occurred at San Francisco in January, 1851. Her husband died of consumption ten months later. Quite a large portion of the family homestead is now devoted to the raising of grapes and fruit. A vineyard of sixty acres furnishes a general variety of wine and table grapes. In the orchard can be found olive, fig, pomegranate, orange, and lemon trees. Mrs. Arnerich and her children are members of the Catholic church.\n\nARNERICH, PAUL Weather Bureau\n\nPaul was born in Los Angeles, California and his working career was with the United States Weather Bureau where he started in Burbank and subsequently was assigned to Oklahoma, Hawaii, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco. His career was interrupted for a long time in World War Il when he was in the US Navy in the Armed Guard project - a branch of the service formed to protect American crews on Maritime vessels. In 1951, Paul and Juanita Snyder-Franchina were married in San Francisco. Paul was a quiet man but his worth and depth were known to many. Paul and Juanita enjoyed gardening and their lovely home was warm and friendly. They both loved animals and their patio hosted friendly \"little critters\" from the woodlands surrounding their home. Paul was also interested in geneology and sports. He had been a 49er fan from the time of Buck Shaw and Frankie Albert. Delving into geneology, he enjoyed many hours tracing the many Arnerichs from Brac. He was a member of the Slavonic Society of San Francisco. A true gentleman departed our midst last month just two weeks before his 84th birthday which would have been on the 20th of June. Paul died on June 1, 1996. Paul is survived by a brother, Frank and a sister, Marie. He was predeceased by a brother and his parents, as well as his beloved Juanita.\n\nARNERICH, PAUL J. State Senate-Sheriff\n\nA man of especial gifts who easily impresses others with both his natural ability and his acquirements through experience is Paul J. Arnerich, a native son, having been born near San Jose on September 23, 1869. His father was Mathew Arnerich, and he married Mrs. Elizabeth (Brown) Moylan, the widow of Edward Moylan. When fourteen years of age, Mathew Arnerich shipped as a sailor, and in the historic year of 49, he voyaged from China to San Francisco. Three years later, he removed to Santa Clara Valley and here engaged in agriculture. In 1856 he married, and purchased 160 acres in the Union district. He died on May 3, 1883, from injuries received in a fall from a buggy. Mrs. Arnerich also came from an old pioneer family, she died here about 1910. As kind parents this worthy couple provided the best training for Paul in the public schools, and when he had finished with his studies, he worked with his father on the home farm until he was twenty-one. Then, for several years, he farmed for himself, and in 1905 he ran for the State Legislature, in which he served a term. He was then appointed to the United States Marshals office as deputy marshal and discharged that responsibility for ten years, he ran for the Legislature, was elected in 1915, and in 1917 he was reelected. Next he was deputy sheriff in Alameda County for a couple of years, and finally was engaged in the real estate business for a number of years until he became deputy sheriff, serving under Sheriff Lyle of Santa Clara County. At San Jose, on February 21, 1898, Mr. Arnerich was married to Miss Eva LaMontagne, a native of Santa Clara County and the representative of another pioneer family; and four children blessed their union. They are Bernice, Francis, Genevieve and Elizabeth. Mr. Arnerich belongs to the Republican party, and when he gets tired of politics he turns for recreation to hunting and other outdoor sports.\n\nARNERICH, VINCENT G. Attorney\n\nBorn in San Jose California in 1909- graduated from Loyola University Class 1930 Magna Cum Lauda, receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree. He was chosen commencement speaker delivering the thesis in philosophy which he prepared for his degree.

Artukovich Jr., a Los Angeles-area contractor whose work included the Los Angeles aqueduct through the Mojave Desert, the Bunker Hill Redevelopment Project Tunnel and other projects across the United States, has died. He was 72. Born in Los Angeles to Croatian-immigrant parents, Artukovich lived most of his life in San Marino and Arcadia. His father founded the John A Artukovich Co. a construction firm, in 1909 and Artukovich had been president since 1952. Artukovich's sudden illness shocked his family who said he had never had to go to a hospital and was working seven days a week until he became sick. \"He was the rock in our family, a role model and mentor,\" said Anita Artukovich, his daughter. Artukovich went to Loyola High School and Loyola University in Los Angeles. He also served in the Army during the Korean War until he was given an emergency discharge after his father died. In addition to his daughter Anita, Artukovich is survived by three sons: John A. Artukovich III, Matthew and Michael.\n\nARTUKOVICH, VIDO Construction\n\nThe late Vido was born on July 15, 1892 in the village Klobuk, district of Ljubuski, Herzegovina. As many hundreds of other Croatian young men from Herzegovina, he left his native land and came to America in 1912. He permanently settled in Los Angeles and lived there until his death. The late Vido Artukovich brought with himself all the values of a Herzegovinian village: the commitment to his religion, the true love for his Croatian people, the traditional Croatian honesty, the big heart and open mind, as well as entrepreneurial spirit and perseverance at work. His beginning was very hard as the livelihood was hard to all of our immigrants, but the late Vido didn't give up. During forty years of hard and persevere work, at the beginning together with other Croatian pioneers and then at his own, he succeeded to establish the construction firm he and all of the Croatians in California should be proud of. Vido Artukovich, a prominent member of our colony, died on Tuesday, July 16, 1964, the day after his 73rd birthday anniversary. He passed away of a short illness, comforted from his wife, children and numerous grandchildren.\n\nAUSEZ, FRANK Contractor\n\nOne of the leading cement contractors in Richmond and vicinity is Frank Ausez of No. 2100 Burbeck Avenue, Richmond. He was born in Croatia on December 3, 1883, one of five children in the family of Frank and Catherine Ausez. His father was a builder and it was natural that Frank,Jr., should take to the building trade. After finishing his education in his native land, in 1905, Mr. Ausez landed in America and crossed the continent to Lafayette, Colorado, where he spent three years. After this he traveled through the northwest looking for a suitable place and in 1909 landed at Richmond, California. After some deliberation he concluded he would try his luck here and began work as a concrete and cement contractor, a business he had become competent to handle in every department. From the first he was successful and as the years have passed he has had his share of the cement and concrete work in this locality and has done considerable bridge and street work. As he has prospered he has invested in property and owns his home and is well satisfied that he cast in his lot with Contra Costa County. He became a full-fledged American citizen. In San Francisco in 1919. Mr. Ausez was married on November 9, 1913, to MIss Mary Yanezich, also a native of Croatia and a daughter of John and Annie Yanezich. She has one brother living in Richmond. Mr. and Mrs. Ausez have three children: Frankie, Annie and Frances. Mr. Ausez is a member of the Builders Exchange and takes an active interest in its meetings. He belongs to the Woodmen of the World, the Red Men and the Richmond Elks. To help boost the city of his choice he is a member of the Chamber of Commerce.\n\nAVIANI, ERNEST Restaurant\n\nOne of the first good fish eating places upon approaching Fishermans wharf is the Neptune at 2737 Taylor Street. The proprietors are Robert Soljack and Ernest Aviani from the Island of Brac, Dalmatia, Croatia. Robert Soljack claims five years of experience at Fishermans Wharf and he and Chef Aviani took over this historic location about one year ago in 1936. They renovated the building, made some changes and today have a comfortable eating house and surely a suggestion of good sea food with the open kitchen and charcoal broiler. When lunching or dining at the Neptune one may eat at the counter, or at open tables or in booths. About 140 persons can be accommodated at one time. The place is famous for its cioppino, fried crab legs, abalone, deviled crabs, charcoal broiled fish of various types, and other seafood specialties. Fish is bought from the boats when they arrive from the sea at Fishermans Wharf, and is served the same day. Menus are made out according to fish available. Some 300 meals are served daily. With such food, with such panorama of hills and bay, with such a picture of fishing scenes, a net mending, of crab cooking, of displays of fish for sale, of the teeming life of those who make their living by the sea spread before one, it is indeed a treat of treats to enjoy a fish dinner prepared as the specialists of the Neptune know how to cook it, and thus enter into one of the typical phases of life in San Francisco.\n\nBABAJKO, CHRIS Sailor\n\nChris Ito Babajko will be remembered not only by people on the Island of Olib but also by his fellow Olibljani in America as someone who did the almost impossible. Ito came to the US in 1960 when he was a 18 years old. He worked at various jobs in the Los Angeles area. In 1982, at age 40, he decided to return to Olib for a visit. Instead of flying like most people, he sailed to Olib in his 13 meter (about 40 feet long) sail boat. This was quite an undertaking. It would be quite a feat for a full crew of men to make this trip under the best of circumstances. As it turned out, Ito sailed much of the way single handed. First, a little background on Ito. He was born on Olib in 1942. When Ito was three years old he was stricken with Polio and both his legs were effected. There was no doctors on Olib to help him. Although his legs were weak even as a child, his upper body was very well developed. Today his body resembles that of a body builder. Equally, he has always had a very strong will and once he decided to do something, he did it no matter how difficult it was. It was therefore no surprise to his classmates on Olib when they heard of his adventure. Accompanying Ito on the onset of the trip were two of his American friends, a man and a woman. They all left Los Angeles and sailed to Mexico where they encountered rough waters. So they docked at the Mexican city of Puerto Vallarta where they celebrated New Years day, 1982. While in Puerto Vallarta the woman in his crew did not continue the journey. This left him with only his male crewman. The two men continued on until they reached Costa Rica. After arriving in Costa Rica, Itos remaining crewman decided against going on to Olib with him. In Costa Rica, Ito met Maria who decided to go with him to Olib. It took them 36 days to cross the Atlantic Ocean. The engine of the boat broke down while they were in Panama and they had no alternative but to use the sails for the remainer of the trip. To add to this already difficult endeavor, Maria was so sea-sick most of the trip, Ito had to tie her to the mast of the boat to keep her from going overboard. Ito had to sail this very large boat by himself from Costa Rica to Olib. Ito not only accomplished this, but he and Maria arrived safe and unharmed at the port of Zadar. The Croatian newspapers in Zadar interviewed him on his arrival. Later, Ito and Maria were married together they have a daughter. One can only say this is something to be proud of and a great deal of praise should be given to Ito for this accomplishment.\n\nBABAROVIC, JOHN Architect\n\nJohn Babarovic was director of long-range planning at American Airlines in the late 1960's. He represented the airline in the design and engineering of the Super Bay Hangars in Los Angeles and San Francisco. These were the largest in the world at the time, designed to accommodate four of the new Boeing 747's and two DC-10's under one roof. He also designed the American Airlines terminal at San Francisco. While with the firm of Harrison & Abramowitz in New York, he worked on the Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center and the Citibank headquarters. At the time of his death he was working on a double- decker docking system for the Airbus A380, a superjumbo jet that is planned to have two seating levels. Mr. Babarovic was born in Susak, Croatia, and was a graduate of St. George's College in Argentina and Syracuse University in New York. He served in the United States Army, in military intelligence, in the Korean War. John A. Babarovic died on November 2, 2001 in London, England where he lived. He was 69. He is survived by his wife, Anne Crawford Babarovic of London; a sister, Frances Baglantzis of New Rochelle, New York; two daughters from a previous marriage, Juliana Babarovic Jaynes of Newport News, Virginia, and Christina Maria Babarovic of London; and a grandson.\n\nBABICH, JOHN Baseball\n\nJohn Babich, the tall right hand pitcher whom Connie Mack grabbed off the Yankee farm at Kansas City, a year ago, might well be called: \"Jack the Yankee Killer\" for, despite the fact the Athletics finished last, Babich defeated new York five times out of six starts, and New York lost the pennant by only two games. John held the Yankees to thirty-six hits in the six contests. In the only game he lost to New York. Winning fourteen and loosing thirteen games for a team that had a percentage of only 351 at the end of the season was a great feat for Babich, especially when it is recalled that in 1936, John was believed to be through as a pitcher. In fact, that was what everyone thought except John, himself. He had developed an injury to his right elbow when with the Boston Bees and was forced to undergo an operation for the removal of a chipped bone. He went on the voluntary retired list and returned to his home in California.John had little to do but think about his future and when someone told him that George Uhle had been able to stage a comeback by reason of learning how to throw a \"slider\", John decided he would try to do likewise. He essayed to pitch for Boston again and also for Jersey City without success in '37 and was sent to the Mission team in California. Won twelve and lost eight. He became encouraged. In '38, he won nineteen and lost seventeen for Hollywood. The Bees recalled him but when the chance came to get Shortstop Miller from Kansas City, they tossed in Babich. He really staged a comeback with the Cowboys, winning nineteen and losing only six games. Despite that excellent record, the Yankees brought in Pitcher Breuer in preference to the veteran and this gave Connie Mack the chance to land the courageous Croatian in the draft, about the best bet Mr. Mack ever made in the annual selection. The training season in California was not a week old before the dean of managers knew that he secured a most dependable hurler, one who should be a regular starter. Johnny, who by the way, is a neighbor of Sam Chapman, also of the Athletics, was just eighteen when he reported to the San Francisco club for a trial. He was shipped to Globe, Arizona but recalled to win five and lose three games late in the season. The next year, 1932, he was free agent, he signed with the Missions and did so well in 1933, he was sold to Brooklyn. His trade to Boston, his injury and operation followed. Now at age of twenty-seven,Johnny finds himself really starting. More power to him.\n\nBABICH, JOSEPH G. Judge\n\nJudge Babich was first appointed to the bench as a Municiple Court Judge by Governor Goodwin Knight in 1957. He was elevated to Superior Court in February 1964, when he was appointed by Governor Edmund G. Brown Sr., and served until he retired from the bench in April 1984. During his tenure as Superior Court Judge he was reelected to that office three times. During his term as Judge, among other duties Judge Babich was elected by his fellow Judges to serve as Presiding Judge of the Municiple Court ( 1962) and also of the Superior Court (1975, 1977). Judge Babich's father, Josip was born in Runovici, Croatia and came to the United States in 1906. His mother, Helen (Skrmetta) was born in the village Bobovisca on the island Brac, Croatia and came to the United States in 1900, when she was two years old.

Sill, Oklahoma 1954-55 .\n\nBABIN, TOMO Longshoreman-Military\n\nCroatian-Americans have been a part of many different political movements in the United States. Communism was no exception. Indeed, Croatian Americans constituted in the early years of the history of the Communist Party of the United States of America one of the largest ethnic groups in the Party. Since the fall of Communism, documents have been released from various archives which shed some more interesting light on this often overlooked aspect of our history. One of the more incredible stories involves Torno Babin, born in 1901 in Preko - Poljane, near Zadar. We do not know too much about Babin's early life although after he arrived in New York he appears to have mostly worked, like many of our immigrants from the islands and Dalmatia at the time, along the docks of New York's West Side. By the early 1930s, Babin became active in Communist Party organizations and a member of the Party as well. The outbreak of the Spanish Civil War saw Babin volunteer for the International Brigades and he served as commissar of a battalion while there.\n\nAfter his return to New York, Babin assisted in organizing the Yugoslav Seamen's Club. Primarily consisting of Croatian seamen and shipyard and dockworkers, the Club was a Communist-controlled front organization. It nevertheless achieved great importance in the Croatian-American community and, during World War 11, became one of the most vocal supporters- of Tito's Partisans. During this time, Babin came to the attention of the American Office of Strategic Services, the precursor of the CIA. The OSS, and its British counterpart, the SOE, recruited several dozen primarily Croatian-Americans and Croatian-Canadians who were to be parachuted to Tito's forces. At the time the Allies had yet to establish formal contacts with the Partisans. Apparently, the OSS and SOE believed that these immigrants, all of whom appear to have been Communists, would be perfect for such activities.\n\nWhile Babin never made it to the Partisans, he engaged in surreptitious activity on behalf of Soviet Military Intelligence, known by its Russian initials as the GRU. Authors John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, in their work Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999), note that certain documents, recently released by the America's National Security Agency (and available on their website) show that Babin provided the GRU with information about his recruitment work for the OSS and SOE as well as providing it with \"a steady stream of information ... about American shipping in New York harbor.\"\n\nThe Americans never caught Babin. After World War 11, he joined Yugoslavias Ministry for Foreign Affairs and served, at least publicly, as Yugoslavia's attache for relief work and for its merchant marine at Yugoslavia's embassy in Washington, D.C. He continued to remain a liason with the Croatian-American community and is known to have had contacts with various Croatian-American and other Communists.\n\nIn 1948, however, he left the embassy after having announced his support for Stalin following the Tito-Stalin split, Babin, who had married to an American-born Croatian, sought political asylum in the United States, claiming that he would be persecuted if forced to return to Yugoslavia. However, the United States had already instituted repressive measures against Communists and initiated deportation proceedings against him. American authorities finally succeeded in deporting Babin to Poland in 1950 and he died in Warsaw in March 1956; far from both his native Preko and his wife and children in the United States.\n\nBACH, NENAD Recording Artist-Composer\n\nNenad is a recording artist, composer, and performer who has recorded for Sony, Polygram and many other labels.

The album was recorded in Nenad's own recording studio, which he also uses for his scoring and production work and which was designed to accommodate anything from acappella vocals to rock and roll to symphonic orchestras on a location.\n\nHe is currently in preproduction for a new solo album, which is due for release in Spring 2002. Nenad sang in the new recordings of \"We Are Family\" benefit for the Sept. 11th fund as well as scored the film \"The Making and the Meaning of We Are Family\". His label just signed a contract for the worldwide promotion and distribution of \"The Pharos Cantors\"(Glagolitic Chants based on Gregorian Chants). He also recently completed work as a language consultant for the literature and film project for all four of the Harry Potter books. Through his singing and songwriting Nenad's goal is to spread the message of joy and universal peace.\n\nBACHAN, LUKE G. Fruit Packer\n\nHe came from Dalmatia, Croatia where he was born February 28, 1889, the son of Luke Bachan, a hardworking farmer whom he never knew, for he passed away when the son, L. G., was about three years old. His devoted mother is still living. On October 6, 1907, he landed in New York, eager to try his fortune under the more favoring Stars and Stripes; and soon after setting foot on American soil he boarded a train and started for California. On the 13th of October, 1907, Mr. Bachan reached the Pajaro valley in Watsonville and immediately went to work. Luckily, he had been able to save a little money from his dollar-a-day income, and, though his beginning was unpretentious enough, he has been, by hard work, foresight and thrift, very successful. This is evidenced by the fact that he has just bought the Dunbar & Hansen plant, with all the equipment -a very important adjunct. His success here has developed an intense interest on his part in all that pertains to the growth and future of Watsonville. Mr. Bachan has been twice married, his first wife being Miss Tresa De Lares, by whom he has had two children, Catherine Anna and Luke George, Jr. Mrs. Bachan, who was beloved by all who knew her, died November 1, 1922, and he had subsequently married Miss Maria P. Alaga, by whom he has one child, Alice Maria. He is a republican; has attended to the third degree in the Knights of Columbus; is a Forester of America; and belongs to the Austrian-American benevolent Association.\n\nBACHMAN, JOSIP Tamburitza\n\nJosip Bachmann was the organizer and director of the Tamburica orchestra \"Croatia\" in the Croatian parish of St. Anthony's in Los Angeles. As an expert of Croatian tamburica music which interested and occupied him since his early youth in his native Osijek in Croatia. He was born January 7, 1915. In his native Croatia he belonged to the Croatian eagle Club and the Croatian Krizarsko Bratstvo. He played for Radio Osijek. Music was always a great part of Josip Bachmann's life-especially after his musical education, which he finished at the Osijek Musical Academy. Josip arrived in the United States in 1957, where he continued to contribute to the artistic life of the Croatian community in Southern California. As a conductor of the \"Croatia Orchestra\" he held many a concert-not only in the parish halls of St. Anthony but also in many of the musical institutes of the United States. In this way, many thousands Americans first heard Croatian tamburica music. He also conducted for three phonograph albums: \"Croatian melodies\", \"Croatian Sounds\" and \"Songs from Croatia.\" Many of these were difficult selections from very accomplished Croatian tamburica composers. Maestro Bachmann devoted much of his time-even as he worked regularly-to the Croatian children and young people to whom he taught the different tamburica instruments free of charge.\n\nBACICH, STELLA Fashion Designer\n\nStella Bacich, or Stella of Hollywood, became a successful fashion designer of womens sports clothes in the 1930s and was commissioned by various movie stars to design sport slacks. She was an American citizen, originally from Los Angeles. Stella was one of the youngest of Californias designers to be in business for herself. She also worked in such movie studios as Film Modes, Kay Dell Screen Modes and Dorothy Newman.\n\nBADOVINAC, JOHN Editor-President CFU\n\nJohn Badovinac, former president of the Croatian Fraternal Union, edited Bulletin (Vjesnik) of St. Nicholas Lodge No. 14 of the CFU in the late 1960s. He also edited The American Croatian Pioneer, which was issued monthly by the Lodge No. 663 of the CFU in the 1950s and 1960s, and is still a rich source of information on Croatian local history. For over ten years The American Croatian Pioneer was dedicated to the service of its members and to all CFU members in the greater Cleveland and northern Ohio areas. John Badovinac published many articles on Croatian history and ethnic history; these were published in the Zajednicar newspaper of the Croatian Fraternal Union. Johns family came from Zumberak, Croatia.\n\nBADURINA-JUSTIS, LORRAINE M Reference Librarian\n\nLorraine Badurina is a Librarian at the Oregon College of Education, Monmouth, Oregon. She was born to Croatian parents June 25, 1945 in Vancouver, Washington. Education includes Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, 1963-67, B.A.; University of Denver, Denver, Colorado, 1967-68, M.L.S. with a major field in English and a sprecialty in Librarianship.\n\nBAGARIC, DALIBOR Basketball\n\nDalibor Bagaric has changed his summer plans after a heart-to-heart with operations chief Jerry Krause, who convinced the second-year center it would be in his best interests to participate in the Bulls' summer program. Bagaric had grown so disenfranchised with a lack of playing time, he vowed to stay in Croatia throughout the summer. But Bagaric has seen more playing time since Brad Miller was traded to the Indiana Pacers, and Krause made sure Bagaric understood the importance of remaining in Chicago. ''Dali and I talked,'' Krause said. ''He's going to stay here. \"He's going to go home to get married, then come back for the summer program, like everybody else. ''He's a nice young man who was frustrated. But we never have had any problems with Dali. He's a hard worker.'' Bagaric said he has adjusted his attitude after talking to Krause, who drafted him with the 24th pick in 2000. ''[Krause] told me what I have to do and what I'm supposed to do, and I will do it,'' Bagaric said. ''We had a good talk. ''And now I'm playing more, and it's a better situation. I will be here.'' Bagaric is under contract through next season. March 10, 2002.\n\nBAHORIC, JOHN Professor\n\nBorn June 21, 1936, Chigago, Illinois.

Caroline Puskarich, a native of the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area, played in junior tamburitz groups as a child and then went on the play, dance, and sing in the well-known Duquesne University Tamburitzans. Moved to California, she married Afred Bahr in 1962 and settled in Mountain View to begin her married life. But once a tamburitzan, always a tamburitzan, and she missed the dancing, playing, and singing that she was used to. The solution was to start up a tamburitza group of her own based upon her past experience in Pennsylvania. In 1965 Caroline gathered a group of some fifteen adults who were willing to work at this new experience, found some instruments, and began teaching in various homes and in the fruit-drying shed on the Sulaver ranch in Cupertino. Shortly after that beginning Caroline started several junior groups and the era of the Veseli Seljaci and its allied groups was launched. By the mid-1980s the tamburitza and kolo groups numbered about a hundred participants. Veseli Seljaci played to enthusiastic crowds at nearly twnety national Extravaganzas and had presented yearly concerts to large audiences. There were invitations to play in Seattle, several cities in Nevada, and in southern California. During their most active period, the Veseli Seljaci recorded 4 LP records and 4 cassette tapes, and they performed at 15 Tamburitza Extravaganzas in various cities around the United States.\n\nBAJURIN, DAN Restaurant\n\nWhat more appropriate name could be chosen for a restaurant specializing in sea food than Popeye? That popular sailor popped into mind of Dan Bajurin when he planned his new eating house in September, 1936, at picturesque Fishermans Wharf, 2770 Taylor Street in San Francisco. And so, when you step past the large stove on the sidewalk where fresh lobsters, shrimps and crab are cooked, into the dining room, you meet Popeye face to face in the amusing paintings on the wall of the Popeye Fish Grotto. You see him in his various sea adventures which are delightfully intriguing. Then when you are seated in one of the comfortable open booths, he again greets you on the menu. It is always gay and interesting relaxation to go to Fishermans Wharf. The atmosphere of the sea, of fishing, of the Latin race, of the ships which sail the seas, always enfold one and carry the mind to distant shores, from whence came these men of many lands, where fishing was their calling in the old country. Quite in keeping with this are the four partners of Popeye Fisherman/s Grotto. Two of them, Dan Bajurin and Mario Zarish, are from Dalmatia. When Dan came to California in 1929 he missed his fishing adventures and decided to have a restaurant where fish would be the specialty. He has worked and had restaurants since that time in Sacramento and San Francisco. Before opening Popeye Fish Grotto, he worked in one of the most popular of the fish grottoes in Fishermans Wharf. Airy, bright, new and clean, the dinning room can accommodate as many as 92. The charcoal broiler is of the latest type and not only is broiled fish a specialty but this one eating place at Fishermans Wharf where one may feast upon tender broiled steaks and chicken. And, if some of the party desire fish and others do not care for it, each may be satisfied to his taste. The pots of chowder, Boston clam and Coney Island clam chowder, the mackerel pickled by the chef that day, the trays of freshly shelled shrimps, the great jars of newly made dressings, all were in readiness for customers.\n\nBAJURIN, NORBERT Golden Gate Yacht Club-Commodore\n\nA small San Francisco boating club known for its stiff drinks and salty characters is making an impressive and unlikely bid for the oldest prize in professional sports, the America's Cup. If it succeeds in this elite, highstakes race being waged in the waters off New Zealand, the Golden Gate Yacht Club - whose Commodore is a radiator repair businessman - could change the staid and sterIing image of yachting.\n\nNineteen members of the Golden Gate club spent the last two weeks in Auckland, New Zealand, partying with the sailors and cheering for their high-powered team - aware that bringing the Cup home would be like hosting the Olympics on the Bay. The regatta is an exclusive party the band of blue-collar boaters never imagined attending.\n\nThe Golden Gate snagged its front-row seats to the Super Bowl of sailing through an unexpected deal forged between the modest mechanic and Silicon Valley mogul Larry Ellison. The Golden Gate is the official sponsor of Oracle BMW Racing, a syndicate, bankrolled by the software billionaire.\n\nThe incongruous pairing happened after talks unexpectedly broke off between Ellison and the city's prestigious St. Francis Yacht Club. The club had balked at Ellison's requirement that three members of Oracle racing sit on the St. Francis, board. Golden Gate Commodore Norbert Bajurin, who runs Alouis Auto Radiator in San Franciscos Western Addition, says he feels like a proud parent. \"I got goosebumps walking around Auckland, seeing signs and billboards with pictures of our club burgee with the Golden Gate Bridge on it,\" said Bajurin, 46, a former Rohnert Park cop.\n\n\"Most people that I met in New Zealand believe we are a large club representing the upper crust of San Francisco society,\" Bajurin said. \"I'm proud to let people know we are a small, people-oriented club that has struggled to maintain its very existence.\" The pale-gray Golden Gate clubhouse is situated between Crissy Field and the Marina Green, about 100 yards from the St. Francis. Bajurin is credited with taking the club from a state of imminent demise to the pursuit of sailing's Holy Grail. Desperate to find sources of revenue to sustain the club, Bajurin pitched the sponsorship idea to Bill Erkelens, a Bay Area sailor who runs Ellison's racing operations.\n\nWe knew we had city-front property. We knew Larry has a house in Pacific Heights, and if hes not out on the bay sailing, he could be sitting up there watching the race. Oracle Corp. CEO Ellison, an accomplished amateur sailor and fierce competitor, is spending $ 85 million of his fortune in hopes of bringing the Cup to the San Francisco Bay. He is one of four billionaires backing syndicates. Oracle racing got what it wanted out of the sponsorship deal: a club that would allow it to manage its own sailing operations and stage its own defense if victorious. The Golden Gate secured a much needed infusion of cash. More than 100 members of Oracle racing became dues-paying club members. The club charges a $ 1,000 initiation fee and $90 in monthly dues.\n\nBAJURIN, RUZA Teacher-Croatian Activities\n\nHer death came upon suddenly in 1999. Her husband Joza passed away just few months ago, and now it seems that Ruza longed for joining her dear Joza. Ruza Bajurin was born in Zenica, Bosnia, on October 2, 1918. She attended elementary and high school in Zenica. Her parents moved to Zagreb, so she continued her education in Zagreb. She graduated in linguistics: French, Italian and Spanish. Beside those languages she was interested in Esperanto and Russian. In 1942 she was sent to Berlin as an official interpreter at the Croatian embassy. There she met her future husband Joza. She married in Berlin. The son Borna was born in Zagreb in 1943. By the end of the war the couple separated- Ruza returned to Zagreb with her son Borna, and Jozo moved from Switzerland to America. She was working and studying in America. She worked in an exclusive school in San Francisco teaching French, Russian and Latin. She founded the Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge \"1007 Ivan Mestrovich\". She was the secretary of the Lodge for many years. Furthermore, she organized the Croatian Library with an enviable number of books. She founded the Croatian language school. Ruza was a humanitarian person. She had been working for years as a volunteer in the senior's home \"Laguna Honda\". She also wholeheartedly worked to ease the pain and suffering of Croatian orphans.\n\nBAKARICH, GERALD S. Judge\n\nJudge Bakarich was appointed to the bench as Municiple Court Judge by Governor Deukmajian in January 1991. Judge Bakarich currently sits on a Superior Court, assignment in Department 98 (a criminal department). Judge Bakarich is a second generation American. His grandfather, Stjepan, was born in Udbina, Lika and emigrated to the United States to settle in Rose, Nevada and work in the copper mines until his death as a result of a mining accident. Judge Bakarich's father, Nick, was born in Rose, but as a teenager moved to Sacramento, California. Judge Bakarich received his Bachelor's degree from California State University, Sacramento in 1975 and his J.D. degree firom Lincoln Law School, Sacramento in 1982. He was admitted to the California Bar in 1982. Judge Bakarich is a Chief Warrant Officer with the California National Guard. Prior to his becoming a judge, Judge Bakarich served the City of Sacramento as a police officer and, after passing the bar, the County of Sacramento as Deputy Disctrict Attorney. He and his wife Peggy reside in Sacramento, California. Judge Bakarich has three adult children.\n\nBAKOTICH, JAKOB Stonemason\n\nMy parents Jacov (James) and Tonina (Antoinetta) Bakotich came to San Francisco Bay area in March 1905. Dad came earlier in 1900. He returned in 1905 to marry mother in her home town of Vis, Croatia on island of Vis. They were childhood sweethearts in Vis, and were married in Sveti Duh Catholic Church across the street from mom's house, which I have visited three times. They honeymooned in Split and Trieste and took a boat from there to New York, which took 30 days. The train was the next transportation to San Francisco. Mother's maiden name was Slavic and her mother's maiden name was Mare Cargotic. Dad's mother's maiden name was Tonina Puhalovic. Dad was an artisan stonemason having learned his trade from his father and older brother, Antone, who were contractors in this trade in Vis. Dad worked in the Bay area, Napa and Martinez. My sister Mary was born December 7, 1905 in Martinez. They moved to San Francisco in 1906 and were all shook up by the April 18, 1906 earthquake. They lost all but 2 blankets and a knife dad's father had given to him. They evacuated to a park near their Green St. apartment and then to Oakland to the home of friends. Later, that year 1907 they moved to South Palo Alto (Mayfield) and later bought a home on Kipling and Hawthorne Streets, Palo Alto. My brother James was born 1909, and I was born there later. Dad also later helped to bring his younger sister Lena, from Vis.\n\nBAKULICH, PETAR Fisherman\n\nIn 1921, my father, Petar Bakulich, arrived in Bellingham, Washington. I think he came to America through Canada. He was 19 years old and was born on the Island of Vis, Dalmatia, Croatia. I do not know a lot of his personal history at that time. However, he lived with his sister, Yela Mu1jat and brother-in-law, Nickola Mu1jat; who were the parents of my first cousins, Frank and Vince Mu1jat. I am writing this article to let the people of Bellingham know how this young immigrant from Dalmatia is a forgotten part of your city's history in the early 1900's. His first job in this country was during the development of your beautiful Fairhaven Park.\n\nHe pulled tree stumps after the trees were cut down to clear the area that would be used for the park. To do this, he was given two mules in a team attached to a wedge plow and with a series of chains when the setup was completed - he would give the command to the mules, and hopefully pull up the stump. If he was successful he would then go to the next stump. Sometimes the stump was too big or too deep and when he gave the command, the mules moved forward and if the plow wedge got caught under the stump the wedge plow would catapult him over the stump and he would land between the mules. This was because my father had a firm grip on the handles and was not able to release his hold in time. He would describe his displeasure in a language only another Croatian would appreciate, and not for publication in this letter. Anyway, with some thanks to my Dad, Bellingham got its Fairhaven Park and my Dad had his first job in America. At best, it was a tough job even in those days for a young man trying to find his way in America. I never visit Bellingham without passing through the park. I have a warm feeling about his contribution to the people of Bellingham. This story was repeated time and time again to my sister, my brother, and me.\n\nAfter the tree stump-pulling job, he joined the salmon fishing fleet like so many other Croatian immigrants. This was another tough job as described in early articles of the Pacific Northwest Croatian. To say that these men were only fishermen does not do them justice. These men were pioneers of the industry and innovators of supporting industries, canneries, boat builders, net manufacturers, harbor builders, and many other businesses up and down the coast, from Canada to Mexico. Together they helped develop the largest fishing industry in the world. These pioneers of that legacy should never, ever be forgotten.\n\nAround 1921-1924, my father met my mother, Mary Ru1jancich, daughter of Tomazina and Frank RuIjancich. Mom and Dad lived on 12th Street with the rest of the Dalmatian immigrants and Mom's three sisters, Pearl, Antonette, and Helen. It was an easy walking distance to the boat docks, or in my father's case, the walk to the future Fairhaven Park. My mother graduated from Fairhaven High School around 1923. She came to America with her mother and dad when she was five years old. My father didn't get along too well with his potential in-laws, in fact, they tried to discourage any relationship between the two. However, my Mom and Dad were determined to get married and plan their future together. They hopped on a train from Bellingham to Sacramento,\n\nCalifornia where my Dad had relatives. On October 28, 1925, they were married, but the marriage did not have the blessing of her parents. My mother was 19 and my father was 24. Of course the relationship between my father and his in-laws improved over time and they became good friends. Once they were married in Sacramento, they moved directly to San Pedro. There was another colony of Dalmatians who like many other fiiends and relatives from the old country, were willing and waiting to give a helping hand to a newcomer.\n\nIt was at this time he joined the San Pedro fishing fleet.\n\nWe all know that tuna and sardine boats are very large and very expensive to operate. Consequently, there were very few individuals who were sole owners of these boats. Instead, the fishermen would get together with friends and relatives, form partnerships, and then purchase a boat. My father was a partner in the following boats: the Magellan, Oakland, Betsy Ross, and the Blue Sky. All the boats are now docked in Davey Jones' Locker. No one can say that being a fisherman is an easy job. Most of the fishermen I knew had a philosophy Of \"when pulling on a rope, and if whatever you were pulling did not move, and you complained that this is too hard - they would say it couldn't be that hard, You didn't break the rope yet. \" Another bit of wisdom was given to me when I first started fishing and we had a good season. \"'Seven years good luck, seven years bad luck. Son, save your money in the good years for the bad years because you'll have them and then they won't be so bad \" Even fishermen have fun and often it's very spontaneous. Once while fishing off the coast of Mexico, about 200 miles out to sea, my father fancied a swim. He took a long dive out of the crow's nest from about fifty feet up. He made the mistake of diving with his mouth open and on impact with the sea, his false teeth popped out and he lost them. it took two months to replace them; good thing Dalmatians like soup! He never did that again!\n\nThese old timers had very little tolerance for effors or mistakes and if you made one, look out! Once again fishing for tuna off the coast of Mexico, we were in a set and caught a school of tuna mixed with about 15 tons of sharks. Since I was just getting my start I was assigned to work the skiff, when the skiff came along side the boat I was given a long boat hook and told to push the skiff away from the boat so they wouldn't bang each other due to the roll and pitch of the sea and cause damage. The rest of the crew were on deck hauling in the net. While pushing the skiff away from the boat, the hook got caught in the net and all work stopped so I could release the hook. If I didn't release the hook it might have ripped the net, and we could lose the tuna. As hard as I tried I couldn't get the hook released. My father lost his patience and took matters in his own hands. He took off his boots and jumped in the water with the sharks, pushing them out of the way with his bare hands. Then he swam through the sharks to the boat where the hook was tangled. He unsnarled the hook and swam to the skiff, he handed me the boat hook then swam back to the boat. The crew was waiting for the sharks to bite my dad, but they didn't. Then my father told me not so nicely to never make that mistake again. He was a real trooper when it came to giving someone a chewing out. After the set was over and we had the tuna aboard, one of the crew members whispered to me that, \"Even the sharks think your old man is too damned tough to eat. \"\n\nIn the early 1930's between the tuna and sardine fishing season and during the light of the moon when the fishing fleet was not fishing my dad played soccer with the local San Pedro team called the \"Jardrans\" he played with this team for a number of years and the family and relatives would go watch him play on Sunday aftemoons. In his younger days he was very spry and to prove it he would jump over the open hatch on the Betsy Ross and also he could stand along side the kitchen sink and spring jump to the top surface of the sink. Some of his fishing buddies who were friends on Vis before they came to America told me that he should never have left Vis and stayed there and became a professional soccer player. I guess it's from his side of the family that we inherited our ability to play good sports. Like my cousins Frank and Vince Mu1jat in basket ball, my cousin Anthony Brajcich, baseball; my brother Frank, Baseball; and myself, all league - Ist team basketball; and my nephew, Joe Lovitto, who was drafted at age 18 to play major league baseball for the Texas Rangers. All of these, like my dad, were above average in sports. I remember once when my neighborhood boy fiiends were out playing football in the street and my Dad came home early from working on the boat. He saw us kids playing and asked us if he could kick the ball we gave him the ball and he sent us down the street to catch the ball except when he kicked it - his foot went through the ball and it popped! There was so much excitement between us kids, that I don't remember what we played the rest of the day, probably marbles.\n\nIn the Dalmatian tradition around Easter my Dad, my uncles, and fishing buddies would get together and buy a spring lamb, slaughter the lamb, save the innards, heart, liver, lungs, and kidneys. My Mom would make a Dalmatian island stew with potatoes called \"Kulin\" in Croatian. They would sit around the table eating this stew and drink home made wine and praise God how good it tasted. \"Boga stoye vo dobro\" Drink more wine and have a good time. About 3 oclock they would all go home, the parting shot was \"We have to do this again next year.\" I think these guys liked my Moms cooking - and the wine wasn't bad. either.\n\nIn 1954 thru 1956, 1 was stationed in Ketchikan, Alaska in the US Coast Guard. In 1955 my father made his last fishing trip. I think this year he gave up tuna fishing to make one more salmon trip so that he could see me. Sadly, we were only able to spend one afternoon together; and at that time he complained about a sore he had in his mouth. When he returned to California the doctors diagnosed it as advanced cancer. He was a heavy smoker, drinker, and a tough fishing son-of-a-gun. He died on January 18, 1956. His funeral was huge even by San Pedro standards. For you and I he lives on in Fairhaven Park. So whenever you pass through Fairhaven Park, remember one of your own who helped make this park and say a prayer. (Bakulich 2000)\n\nBAKULICH, PETER JR Fisherman-Military\n\nTuna Trip Aboard the Blue Sky: By 1948 1 had been fishing for 2 years and was no longer considered a novice fisherman or deck hand, and also thanks to my father Petar Bakulich, I was also part owner of the 85-foot purse seiner, Blue Sky.\" We had a crew of eleven men, all Croatian, from up and down the Dalmatian coast and the islands of Vis, Dugi Otok, Brac, and Korcula.\n\nThe newest member of the crew was my friend Matt Milosevich. We were pals in high school and he wanted to try his luck at commercial fishing. Matt's folks - although not from any of the Dalmatian islands, they were still from Croatia up around the Area of Rijeka. Matt's father came to !the US through Canada but not into the Pacific Northwest. He came through the Northeast through Minnesota then south to Colorado, this was in the early 1900's. The folks settled in an old town on the Santa Fe Trail called Trinidad. The town was very active in the cattle drives during this extended period. Matt's Dad worked in the coal mines and he bought a 50 acre farm where Matt was raised with his 4 brothers and 3 sisters. During the depression Matt's father was also a part-time copper-smith making wine barrels in the barn to help support the family (along with some bootleg spirits that Matt doesn't like to talk about). Matt moved to San Pedro in 1942 during WW 11 and we have been friends ever since.\n\nAll the crew members of the Blue Sky were able-bodied, experienced men who could be counted on to handle any situation on a typical fishing trip. In May or June of 1948 we were getting ready to fish tuna in Mexican waters which would take 5 to 7 days traveling time before we came to the fishing grounds. After saying good-bye to our families and friends at the San Pedro fish docks, we left the Los Angeles harbor around 6 P.M. We were now under way and heading south off the California coast. Matt and I were assigned the 8 P.M. to midnight watch. At night out on the ocean around 10 P.M. there is a darkness that is darker then a midnight wine cellar. I mean you can't see anything 30 feet away - no stars were out, no moon, no nothing! I was on the helm steering the boat and Matt said he was going to go below to check out the engine room and deck. He was on his way back to the bridge when Matt saw another crew-meniber on deck. His name was \"Svetco\" an old-timer fisherman with many, many years of experience, Svetco was attempting to fetch a bucket of sea water to flush the toilet (in those days this was the only way to flush). Svetco made a very dangerous mistake that almost proved fatal. One of the first things a fisherman or any seaman learns is that you never ever wrap the end of a rope that fastens to a bucket around your wrist, because when you throw the bucket into the water, the weight of the water rushing into the bucket causes a force strong enough to pull any man over board unless he is on good solid footing. This is what happened to Svetco, he couldn't retrieve nor let go of the bucket so it pulled him over board. Matt was standing about 20 feet from Svetco and saw the whole thing, He immediately made his way back to the bridge where I was steering the boat. Very emotionally, he tried to tell me that Svetco, fell over board. I very calmly told Matt that this was his first fishing trip and to quit horsing around-we don't play that type of joke on each other and this is a serious thing to be kidding about. Boy he sure got excited then... He said, \"Pete, No I'm not kidding and go to hell, Svetco, did fall over board!\" He finally got through to me and I turned the boat around, reversed course and we woke up the crew. Then we started searching the waters with a high-power search light. We finally spotted Svetco bobbing in the water, waving his hands and shouting to be helped-he looked like a floating orange. By now Svetco, had been in the water about 10- 15 minutes. George, another crewmember, quickly went to the bow of the boat with an emergency life ring. When we came close enough to Svetco, George threw the life ring and made the perfect throw right over the arm of Svetco. I think Svetco was going down for the 3rd time. When we got him on deck, he was holding onto the life ring -for dear life-so hard that we had to pry it off. We all knew that in a few more minutes Svetco would have drowned. As it was, Svetco was suffering from cold and exhaustion. We got him undressed., dried him off, and gave him the fisherman's cure all-two shots of bourbon whiskey and put him to bed. We were all very thankful he was alive as we continued on our way to the fishing grounds in Mexico.\n\nThe next day when Svetco was almost recovered and dressed, he showed us his arm that was in the life ring. It was black and blue from his wrist to his shoulder, bruised and tender from grasping the ring so hard. He was very grateful to the whole crew but especially to Matt. He gave Matt most of the credit for saving his life and he promised Matt that when we returned to San Pedro he would buy him a nice pair of slacks from \"Brown Brothers\" the best men's store in town. Matt and old Svetco became good friends. He took Matt under his wing and spent time teaching him the fundamentals of being a fisherman. He had great gratitude to Matt for sounding the alarm and saving his life. Matt said he was a cranky old fart who complained all the time.\n\nIn about 30 days we caught enough tuna to load the boat and headed for home. Back at San Pedro after 2 days of unloading the tuna, the crew was ready to go home. Svetco was all dressed up with his polished brown shoes, nice tan pants, matching shirt and tie, and to top off this outfit he placed an expensive tan colored Stetson hat on top of his head-he really looked the part of a sharp dude, He was ready to leave the boat and told every one good-bye then told Matt he was going to town and buy him the promised pair of slacks. As he went to step off the boat onto the dock, he lost his footing and fell into the water. Oh no not again!\" This time there was no fear of Svetco losing his life, only the loss of pride and humility of this very experienced seaman falling into the water at the dockside. Most of the crew rushed to the side of the boat to watch Svetco. There he was spitting and sputtering, his nice Stetson hat floating off his head about 4 feet away. The skipper of the boat asked him, \"Svetco what the hell are you doing in the water?\" There was Svetco cussing as only a Dalmatian can, against his mother, father, God, his friends, the crew and any one else within shouting distance. The crew was hysterical with laughter, laughing so hard that we were incapable of helping him out of the water or even to throw him a rope to climb out, which made him more angry. One of the crew got hold of a small brailer and retrieved his hat that by now was soaking wet. When he finally got back on board all he could say in his fine Dalmatian accent is \"This is a voodoo-boat, a voodoo-boat, and it's trying to kill me!\" The crew went into another fit of laughter. He went into the cabin to change his clothes and we could still hear him cussing out the voodoo-boat, He finally got dried off and changed, As he was leaving the boat for the second time, someone said, \"\"Hey Svetco don't forget your hat!\" which caused another round of laughter.\n\nThe next day the crew was back on board to finish up the chore's left over from the last fishing trip and to get everything ready for the next trip. Svetco came on board a little later and called Matt over to give him the new pair of slacks, then he went into the cabin and packed his clothes into his duffel bag and left the boat. As he was leaving you could hear him say, \"damn voodoo-boat! \"\n\nFrom that day on, I've never seen Svetco again, that was over 50 years ago. Matt and I are both over 70 years old, live in Fullerton, California and play golf together 2 or 3 times a week. We still reminisce about our fishing experience aboard the Blue Sky; some how, now and then, Svetco gets into the conversation and we have a little chuckle. We don't remember the last names of Svetco, or George who threw the life ring, or even some names of the rest of the crew; but then it's not necessary. I imagine that all the crew has passed on since Matt and I were the two youngest of the Blue Sky Crew at that time. The next year, 1949, 1 moved to Bellingham, Washington and for 3 months lived with my Teta, Yela Mu1jat, on'the north side of town. I went fishing salmon on the boat, Uncle Sam with Jack Radisich. Jack died the following year from cancer. He was a very good man and skipper. After the season was over I returned to San Pedro and fished sardines and tuna for a few more years until I joined the coast guard. Matt also quit fishing and joined the army serving in Korea. After his discharge he became a successful construction contractor.
