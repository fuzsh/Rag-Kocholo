        "text": "by Samm Audu\n\nOgenyi Onazi is\n\npoised to make his Nigeria full international debut on Saturday three years\n\nafter he featured for the countrys schoolboys.\n\n\"I am here to do\n\nmy best to see that we secure a ticket to the 2013 Nations Cup on Saturday,\"\n\nOnazi declared to AfricanFootball.com on arrival for the Nations Cup qualifier in Calabar\n\nagainst Liberia.\n\nHe said it is a\n\ndream come true to be called up by the Eagles.\n\nThis is a dream come true for me\n\nbecause that has been my ultimate ambition since I started the game. It is an\n\nhonour and I will use my chance well, he said.\n\nI will say a\n\nbig thank you to God because without him, nothing is possible. To play for my\n\nfatherland is what I always wanted to do and so I now excited to now be part\n\nof the Super Eagles.\n\nI will do my\n\nbest to lift the team higher. I am sure we will be fine.\n\nIt was only\n\nthree years ago that Onazi and the Golden Eaglets reached the final of the FIFA\n\nU17 World Cup staged by Nigeria. They would lose\n\nthe top prize to Switzerland.\n\nOnazi was the Eaglets\n\ndefensive midfield anchor but following a first-half capitulation in the opening\n\nmatch against Germany, coach John Obuh was forced to drop him and draft Ramon\n\nAzeez.\n\nHe was\n\nthereafter restricted to a cameo role at the tournament.\n\nIn September\n\n2010, one of the Eaglets Class of 2009, Stanley Okoro, will win his first cap\n\nfor the Super Eagles against Madagascar in a 2012 Nations Cup qualifier.\n\nOnazi is now set to\n\nbecome the second such Eaglet to fly with the Super Eagles.\n\nThe player, whose\n\nversatility means he could play as a defensive or offensive player in midfield\n\nor defence, is riding on his showings this season for Italian club SS Lazio to\n\naim for the top.\n\nLast season, Onazi made his Lazio debut when he came on as a substitute against\n\nAtalanta. It was the breakthrough he needed to work his way into the clubs\n\nfirst team.\n\nHe has so far made\n\nfour appearances in the Italian Serie A and he has featured in all three UEFA\n\nEuropa League games.\n\nFormer Eagles striker\n\nAyo Makinwa has been mentoring Onazi in Italy, where he also featured for Lazio,\n\nand he told AfricanFootball.com the youngster has the character to go very far in\n\nthe game.\n\n\"Onazi is a\n\nlively person and good player who believes in himself and is ready to learn, I\n\nam not surprised with his progress. He will go places with his qualities and\n\ncharacter,\" remarked Makinwa.\n\nIt was only a year ago that he failed\n\nto make the cut to the FIFA U20 World Cup in Colombia after he was part of the\n\nFlying Eagles training squad in Portugal and Panama.\n\nBorn in Jos, little Onazi started with the Pepsi\n\nAcademy in Jos, where I played for just six months, before he joined El Kanemi\n\nJunior FC of Jos who produced Chelsea star Mikel Obi, Joseph Akpala, Chinedu\n\nEfugh, late Henry Ihelewere, among others.\n\nOne of the coaches\n\nwho nurtured this rough diamond, Bala Musa aka Haji B, told AfricanFootball.com\n\nthat Onazi was one of the most dedicated players in his time at El Kanemi.\n\n\"Onazi is one of\n\nthe dedicated and committed players that I have worked with. He is a hard\n\nworking player who never gives up. He is always ready to listen. He was ready\n\nto play any role on the pitch that he played as goalkeeper too, said Musa.\n\nI have always known\n\nhe will be a great player because he took his game very seriously. His hard work\n\nis now paying off. Some of his mates are Sulaiman Musa (Valerenga of Norway),\n\nLate Henry Ihelewere and Ochie Okonkwo who is in Malta. I am sure he will do\n\nwell with Eagles.\"\n\nFrom El Kanemi\n\nJuniors, the budding Onazi moved to Lagos where he featured for My People Football\n\nClub founded by Prophet T.B.Joshua, the founder of Synagogue Church of All\n\nNations.\n\nT.B. Joshua would later bankroll the\n\nsearch by Onazi and his Eaglets teammate Sani Emmanuel for a club in Europe,\n\nspanning England, Greece and eventually Italy, where Onazi has now finally\n\npitched tent and he is already waiting to excel."
