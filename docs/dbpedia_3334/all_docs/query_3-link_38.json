We have 1mâ‚¬ for transfers and we are 2,8mâ‚¬/year clear of salaries.\n\nPlayers on TL: Radivojevic (GK), Bogunovic (D RC), Miladinovic (D C), Mladenovic (DM), Raskovic (AM R/F C)\n\nI have instructed scouts to go around Balkans watching for few players, and also done some major changes in staff, terminating contracts with 4 coaches and 2 physios. Also, friendly matches list has been made, with only 3 friendlies, all away from home.\n\n15.07. â€“ Borac Banja Luka (2nd League of BiH)\n\n20.07. â€“ Pomorac Kostrena (2nd League of Croatia)\n\n27.07. â€“ Rad Beograd (2nd League of Serbia)\n\nWhat we really need is another goalkeeper, who can be a real backup to Ivan Randjelovic.\n\nBlic â€“ July, 14th\n\nLot of changes in Crvena Zvezda\n\nIn just one week Vedran Djukaric made several changes in Crvena Zvezdaâ€™s both playing and non-playing staff. He fired 4 coaches and 2 physios, while selling three players. Radivojevic is now member of Mouscron, his transfer was estimated around 100kâ‚¬, while M. Netanya picked up defender Bogunovic for around 60kâ‚¬. Obilic also bought one player, Mladenovic for 10kâ‚¬ upfront and 10kâ‚¬ over 12 months. It is widely expected to see Michael Reiziger in Zvezda, as both sides agreed on 1-year contract.\n\nUefa.com â€“ July, 14th\n\nExperienced Dutch defender finds new home in Belgrade\n\nRed Star picked up Michael Reiziger, 34, from free transfer. He signed 1-year deal and experienced defender is expected to play tomorrow in friendly against Borac in Banja Luka. After great career during which right back played for Ajax, Milan, Barcelona and PSV amongst the others, he decided to finish it in Belgrade.\n\nVecernje novosti â€“ July, 15th\n\nNew faces revealed yesterday in Crvena Zvezda\n\nAfter signing Reiziger, Vedran Djukaric didnâ€™t stop. He presented new player yesterday. Gianluca Pagliuca is 40-years old Italian keeper who played for Inter, Sampdoria and Bologna and will now fight for his position with Ivan Randjelovic. Details of deal are not known, but rumours are saying he signed 1-year contract with minimum wage. Third player revealed yesterday was Vladan Grujic, who signed contract with red-white team, but will be eligible to play once he end his current contract with Sarajevo on New Yearâ€™s Eve. He is 26-years old and plays on position of DM. It is obvious that Castillo wonâ€™t stay much longer in Zvezda.\n\nBorac (BL)-Red Star 0-3\n\nHalf-time score: 0-1\n\nGradski Stadion, Banja Luka, 1916 spectators\n\nMolina, Milijas, Puzigaca own goal\n\nMOM: Mauricio Molina (8)\n\nGlas Srpske â€“ July, 15th\n\nGreat show at Gradski Stadion\n\nAlmost 2000 people saw spectacular football played by Crvena Zvezda Beograd â€¦ Good debuts were made by Pagliuca and Reiziger, while Barcos and Trisovic got one assist each â€¦ Crvena Zvezda shown class and they will surely be even better as time goes by.\n\nBlic â€“ July, 16th\n\nMika Aaritalo â€“ Future star?\n\nCrvena Zvezda signed future star Mika Aaritalo from TPS Turku for 350kâ‚¬. Aaritalo was in Aston Villa, but failed to impress and came back to his home-country Finland. This talented player can play on both flanks and as striker and will be very important in this seasons campaign. Five years deal has been signed, during which Finnish player will earn around 300kâ‚¬ per year. Vedran Djukaric is doing great job during transfer period.\n\nRTS(National TV) â€“ July, 17th\n\nSport news\n\nVedran Djukaric didnâ€™t stopped on Mika Aaritalo. After Finnish winger, he completed four more transfers today, two in and two out of club. Defender Bojan Miladinovic left club to join Zeljeznicar Sarajevo in 150kâ‚¬ deal as he was surplus on CD position, while Milanko Raskovic, 26-years old striker signed for Belgian Mouscron. Crvena Zvezda received 300kâ‚¬ from this transfer. Dejan Mustur, 21, signed from Montenegro champions, Zeta, for 90kâ‚¬. This goalkeeper is already in national team. Most important signing is Steve Marlet. 33-years old French striker signed 2-years contract and will probably finish career in Crvena Zvezda. He played for Fulham, Lyon and Auxerre, but it is interesting to know that he started career in French Red Star 93. What is next Djukaricâ€™s move? Noone knows.\n\nAfter signing two new keepers, I decided to accept offers for Zoran Banovic. Some of our players will go on loan during this season, mostly young ones, trying to give them more first-team experience. In Champions League qualifiers 2nd leg, we will play against better from match Domzale-Astana. We hope Astana will make shocking result, as Domzale is obviously better team and harder to play against. Domzale won first leg at home with nice result of 3-0, so we have to scout them.\n\nMozart(Betting, Serbia, Official Web Site) â€“ July, 20th\n\nCrvena Zvezda and Partizan main favorites for title\n\nCrvena Zvezda is main favorite for winning Meridian SuperLiga title, narrowly followed by fierce rivals, Partizan Belgrade.

Zvezda failed to capitalize their chances and finished friendly series with record of 2 wins and 1 lost match. Next Wednesday we will see first Zvezdaâ€™s competitive game of the season, against Domzale on Marakana.\n\nUefa.com â€“ July, 28th\n\nIn-from Andjelkovic targeted by Club Brugge\n\nClub Brugge made an enquiry about Dusan Andjelkovic, Red Starâ€™s left wing-back, and it is widely expected that the deal will go on. Rumors say that Red Star will be happy to sell their first-team player if Belgian club is ready to make bid of 1.5mâ‚¬. Another player left Serbian champions. Banovic, 28-years old goalkeeper signed for Zeta in 85kâ‚¬ deal.\n\nRed Star-Domzale 1-3(1-1)\n\nScorers: Milovanovic 5â€™\n\nSent Off: Tutoric 14â€™\n\nRTS â€“ August, 1st\n\nLive match coverage: Crvena Zvezda-Domzale\n\nDespite dominating match against Slovenian champions, Zvezda lost 3-1 and it will be hard to catch up in 7 days. Early goal from Milovanovic, after assist from Koroman, gave Zvezda lead. But, Djordje Tutoric got sent off, after getting second yellow card in just 14 minutes. It only took 4 more minutes for goal, as Zahora scored his first. Zvezda had possession, but both Jestrovic and Marlet failed to score from good positions, and 1-1 was HT score. Before conceding another, Zvezda lost both Reiziger and Gueye due to unjuries and had no real CDs for last 35 minutes. But both goals from Domzale came from counter-attacks with Zvezda creating more chances. Bad luck or bad strategy?\n\nUefa.com â€“ August, 3rd\n\nDomzale or Red Star heading to Kiev in 3rd round of CL qualifiers\n\nDynamo Kiev will be looking forward to Domzale or Red Star in 3rd round, after draw made in Nion.

Total domination was crowned in 84th minute by Dejan Milovanovic who scored screamer and gave Zvezda 3rd away European win out of 3 games. It was refereeâ€™s mistake that started match since he sent off Engberg in 6th minute for, as Djukaric said, â€œnothing special, he just tackled on ballâ€. Crvena Zvezda had nice chances, with Jestrovic, Koroman and Molina one-on-one with goalkeeper, but Odenseâ€™s Onyszko made miracles on goal.\n\nBanat-Red Star 0-2 (0-1)\n\nScorers: Molina 21â€™, 68â€™\n\nMOM: Molina (8)\n\nVecernje novosti â€“ September, 24th\n\nMolina is in form as Zvezda snatched first SuperLiga away win\n\nCrvena Zvezda has beaten Banat yesterday with both goals coming from attacking midfielder, Mauricio Molina.

These were best months of my life. I have made good ties to all of staff, players and fans, and Delije are fully behind me and my moves. Thatâ€™s why it wasnâ€™t so hard for these three months.\n\nJ:You have made loads of transfers, both in or out of club. Do you think you made right moves?\n\nVDj:Yap, I have done best I could with money I had to spent. Iâ€™m sorry that I had to leave Andjelkovic and Basta, but we had no options. However, signings such Kippe, Disljenkovic, Lorenzi, Fenin and Aaritalo are great and are carrying club through this season. Iâ€™m very proud of them.\n\nJ: Yes, but youâ€™ve also signed Reiziger, Marlet and Pagliuca, players that arenâ€™t so good this season. And youâ€™ve broken contract with Pagliuca just month after he arrived.\n\nVDj:That were backup options for one year. Reiziger and Marlet are doing just fine and will be helpful this term, while Pagliuca lost all chances of being in squad after arrive of Mustur and Disljenkovic, so we had no options.\n\nJ:Your start in Red Star wasnâ€™t so bright. You lost two European games at Marakana and got only 4 points in first 4 matches in Meridian SuperLiga.\n\nVDj: Thatâ€™s true. New players needed time to adapt, and we didnâ€™t have much luck in these games. But, we were back in games in Domzale and Kiev, and so close to make dream come true, to qualify to group stage of Champions League.\n\nJ: But now, everything looks fine, Partizan and Smederevo are just 3 points clear and youâ€™ve managed to qualify for group stage of Uefa Cup.\n\nVDj:Iâ€™m pretty sure we can manage to climb onto first place in just few rounds. Our game is now brilliant, we score a lot and have very good defence.\n\nJ: What about Uefa Cup? Odense Boldklub was easy task, but now you are facing HSV, Lens, Zaragoza and CSKA Sofia in group stage.\n\nVDj:I was amazed with our great performance in both legs against OB. But, now we have HSV in first round of Uefa Cup away from home at it will be real hard,but I think we can manage to get trough this group.\n\nJ:Molina and Milovanovic are currently in best form, what can we expect from them?\n\nVDj:We can always count that they will do sensational moves when we need them, but we cannot forget other players, since Red Star is all about teamwork.\n\nJ:Thanks for interview, hope to speak with you soon.\n\nVDj:Surely, we broke ice with this one.\n\nNapredak-Red Star 0-1 (0-1)\n\nScorers: Molina 7â€™\n\nMOM: Molina (8)\n\nBlic â€“ October, 8th\n\nThird straight SuperLiga win for Zvezda\n\nNothing much to say, as Zvezda played just enough to clinch away win.

Crvena Zvezda had furious start into second half, as Filip Djordjevic scored and they had Jestrovicâ€™s goal disallowed because of offside few minutes after. Lucas was in the game, because of Castilloâ€™s injury in 62nd minute and he hit the post in injury time of second half.

Cukaricki took lead in 11th minute as Lukovic scored from penalty spot, after Kippeâ€™s handball in penalty area. Until injury time of second half, weâ€™ve only seen one chance, as Koroman hit the post, but Milovanovic saved the game in 4th minute of injury time with perfect free kick.

It was easy game for Serbian champions as they dominated the match. Only CSKAâ€™s goal was scored from clear offside, but Djukaric wonâ€™t be upset since his team qualified to knockout round, and they need only a draw in last round of group stage where they will be host to Lens. In other match of this group, Lens lost on home field 2-0. Zaragoza was better and is very close to qualifying. Only miracle can save Lens. CSKA is already out.\n\nSmederevo-Red Star 1-1 (0-1)\n\nScorers: Milovanovic 14â€™\n\nBlic â€“ December, 10th\n\nZecevic from offside for draw\n\nDjukaric just couldnâ€™t believe what happened in yesterdayâ€™s match. In a match with not much chances, Zecevic equalized in 79th minute from clear offside. After scoring winning goal earlier this season on Marakana, Zecevic scored another and is one player Zvezda doesnâ€™t want to play against. After Partizanâ€™s win in Cacak, greatest rivals are now together in lead, with Smederevo two points behind.

It was lucky win for Zvezda, as they were on wrong foot for most of the game. Stefanovic brought home team in lead early in second half, and Crvena Zvezdaâ€™s only bright period was last 10 minutes, when Barcos scored, and then hit the crossbar. Penalties, however, were smooth job for Crvena Zvezda, as they scored all 4, and Metalac missed two out of three shots.\n\nHajduk Rodic MB-Red Star 1-1 (1-1)\n\nScorers: Jestrovic 28â€™\n\nRTS â€“ December, 15th\n\nLive match coverage: Hajduk Kula-Crvena Zvezda\n\nIn a even game, another Zvezdaâ€™s draw. It is their 4th straight draw in Meridian SuperLiga, but they are still even with Partizan who also managed to get draw in last match. Hajduk got early lead, but team from Kula couldnâ€™t score more, because on goal of Zvezda was in-form Disljenkovic.

Of course, if everyone is healthy and available.\n\nVDj:Itâ€™s hard to tell, since small details can change everything in squad. But, my best eleven should play in 4-4-1-1 formation. Disljenkovic on goal, he has been great signing and played very good. In last line of defense, Frode Kippe and Ibrahima Gueye, as they are very good performers and play very good together. Fullback should be Aleksandar Pantic and Bronowicki, even they didnâ€™t play much during this part of season. Wingers should be Koroman, who is great leader and hardworker, and Mika Aaritalo. Milovanovic and Castillo as central midfielders, and Mauricio Molina, currently our best player as supporting striker. Nenad Jestrovic played very well this season, and he would be my lonely striker.\n\nJ:Thanks a lot for interview. Good luck in second part of season.\n\nVDj:Thank you, itâ€™s really nice to have support in press.\n\nFc-redstar.net â€“ December, 24th\n\nFriendly fixtures for Zvezda\n\nDuring mid-season break, Crvena Zvezda will play 8 friendly matches in which Djukaric will test several players.

It all started with cynical foul by Wiltord in 5th minute, and referee awarded him with direct red card. Goals from Castillo and Fenin in first half ensured easy game for Serbian champions, and all lines were just great. In Toulouse, home team lost to Villarreal 1-2 and is also very far from next round.\n\nPartizan-Red Star 1-1 (1-1) (Meridian SuperLiga)\n\nScorers: Burzanovic 21â€™\n\nMOM: Burzanovic (8)\n\nRTS â€“ February, 17th\n\nLive match coverage (ETERNAL DERBY): Partizan-Crvena Zvezda\n\nIt was one of the classics. Both teams ready to strike and get full package of points which will lead them to nice advantage against city rivals. Zvezda fielded Agassa and Albin for first time, while Jovetic wasnâ€™t in Partizanâ€™s starting line-up. First 10 minutes were nice to watch, but defenses did good job on preventing chances from opponent. 21st minute started when Molina sent perfect long ball, Fenin headed it to Burzanovic whose shot from edge of penalty area went into net with small help from left post. Perfect start for Zvezda. Agassa kept his team in lead with some fabulous saves, and Miroslav Djukic decided to put Jovetic in game instead of right back, Nemanja Rnic. Bullseye! Stevan Jovetic managed to get corner in injury time of first half, Rukavina passed it to Jovetic on penalty spot who assisted Knezevic. Equalizer in second minute of injury time. Second half was same, with many chances coming, but both Agassa and Radosavljevic have done miracles on goal lines. In 75th minute dubious decision made by referee, Jovetic was offside when he got his ball after Rukavinaâ€™s pass, he tried to break trough, Kippe was way too strong for him and he felt. Penalty shot for Partizan! Rukavina placed ball on spot, but his shot went wide. After that, both teams concentrated on defense and 1-1 was fair result for city rivals.\n\nRed Star-Rennes 1-2 (0-2) (Uefa Cup First Knockout Round Leg 2)\n\nScorers: Salas 72â€™\n\nSportKlub â€“ February, 21st\n\nLive match coverage: Crvena Zvezda-Rennes\n\nIf only Rennes had more luck, they could kick out Zvezda out of Europe. Crvena Zvezda fielded reserves for this match, and Rennesâ€™ Didot in 6th minute and Ekoko in 26th scored for early 2-0 lead. Agassa had great game, saving almost everything and keeping his team in Europe. During second half, when Djukaric already used all three substitutes, bringing Molina, Burzanovic and Milovanovic in, game changed pace and Zvezda took control. Delije were heavily breathing before Salasâ€™ goal in 72nd minute which was just enough for easier last 20 minutes. This was first loss for Zvezda since September, 2nd when they lost on this stadium against Smederevo 1-0. In next round Crvena Zvezda will meet Toulouse. French team won 5-3 against home team Villarreal (6-5 on aggregate) after losing 3-0 in 60th minute. Andre-Pierre Gignac was hero as he scored 4 goals, just enough to get his team into next round.\n\nRed Star-Banat 0-0 (Meridian SuperLiga)\n\nBlic â€“ February, 25th\n\nBore draw for Zvezda and Banat\n\nNothing much to say about this game, bore draw in which neither team created good scoring opportunity. Crvena Zvezda was really disappointing today, and Delije are hoping that their team will manage to pull back from this crisis, as they have managed to get only 6 points from last 6 SuperLiga games.\n\nRed Star-Napredak 2-0 (0-0) (Meridian SuperLiga)\n\nScorers: Jestrovic 50â€™; Albin 62â€™\n\nMOM: Albin (8)\n\nBlic â€“ March, 2nd\n\nZvezda records overdue victory\n\nAfter 6 straight draws, Djukaric can finally enjoy in SuperLiga win. It was really easy match for Crvena Zvezda as they won 2-0 against high-flying Napredak Krusevac on Marakana. With lot of possession and large number of chances they should win with greater margin, but goals from Jestrovic and new addition to squad, Albin, were just enough to grab all three points. Juan Angel Albin really fitted in Zvezda, as he directed the show with goal and assist and was unlucky to miss two nice opportunities.\n\nFSS â€“ March, 3rd\n\nSerbian Cup Semi Finals Draw\n\nIn Serbian House of Football, special guest, Serbian captain Dejan Stankovic, Interâ€™s starting midfielder pulled teams out of hat. Tensions were high, as there were four teams in draw, reigning winners of double, Crvena Zvezda, who were Serbian Cup winners 10 times, Partizan with 4 national cups, Smederevo who has one trophy and first league team, Srem Sremska Mitrovica.

After only 80 seconds, fantastic double pass by Castillo and Milovanovic, Castillo dribbled past Mathieu and his crossed ended on Feninâ€™s head. Great shot for Czech forward who scored his 4th goal in Uefa Cup this season. Crvena Zvezda dictated tempo and had great share of possession during first half. However, Andre-Pierre Gignac managed to score after solo moves trough the middle in 21st minute. Three minutes later, in opposition box, Nenad Jestrovic twisted his ankle and first prognosis says he will be out for a month. His substitute was Hernan Barcos. Hard time for Zvezda, as they lost key striker, but Castillo continued fabulous show scoring screamer in 28th minute. Until half-time it was even game without chances and Delije were happy with scoreline. Milovanovic was already tired and with applauses he left game in 50th minute, when Mauricio Molina got in the game. After 7 minutes new shock for Djukaric as he lost Grzegorz Bronowicki due to injury. His replacement was Lorenzy who played very good in last 35 minutes of game. But, bad news are that Polish right back wonâ€™t play for next month or two, and Zvezda lost reliable wingback for toughest period of season. Gignac was so close to another goal in 75th, when he sent ball in net, but he was in offside when Emana sent perfect ball trough the middle. Last goal of game was seen in 79th minute. Perfect teamwork was crowned by well-placed Molinaâ€™s shot. Substitute managed to score and it will be easier for Crvena Zvezda in away leg.

Loads of chances on both sides, and keepers together saved 24 shots on goal. Really impressive. Game was floating with quick tempo and great performances by both teams. Only time Radisa Ilic couldnâ€™t save, was when Frode Kippe hitted bar in 57th minute. It was shot from over than 35 meters away from goal. It was obvious that Zvezda missed Jestrovic, as Barcos just couldnâ€™t overplay Ilic.

With even possession and same amount of chances, it was Barcosâ€™ goal in 66th minute that finished this two-match game. Disljenkovic was once again superb saving everything, while defenders did their part for Red Star. Toulouse just couldnâ€™t break trough, and when they managed to break defenders, goalkeeper was there to save the day. Red Star will play against Fiorentina in next round.

Youâ€™re squad seems to have two faces.\n\nVDj:It is hard to explain, weâ€™re playing same football in all competitions, but just donâ€™t have luck to score in SuperLiga. I really hope that will change in future, so we can win domestic double, and who knows, treble is possible.\n\nJ:Is board of directors happy with Zvezdaâ€™s performances? Latest Stojkovic statement was that they want SuperLiga trophy, not hunting for glory in European competitions.\n\nVDj:Nah, youâ€™re not right. When I spoke to Stojkovic he was really happy with team and our performances and he would be delighted if we could reach final match of Uefa Cup.\n\nJ:You are still fighting on three battlefields, can you pay price and finish second in all of them?\n\nVDj:Itâ€™s possible, but my players are ready to conquer Serbian double and we wonâ€™t let Partizan take any of trophies available.

Djukaric will have to serve touchline ban, after commenting refereeâ€™s decision. Vedran Djukaric thought there was penalty in 81st minute when Ninkov pushed Lorenzi in penalty box.

Formation 5-1-2-0 didnâ€™t helped as they conceded 5 goals. Scorers were Diego Milito twice, Matuzalem, Sergio Garcia and Oscar and 3 of these goals came in injury times of first and second half. Embarassing result for Serbian champion who will probably send reserves to Spain for re-match.\n\nRed Star-Partizan 3-0 (1-0) (Meridian SuperLiga)\n\nScorers: Molina 6â€™(pen), 75â€™; Fenin 64â€™\n\nMOM: Molina (8)\n\nRTS â€“ April, 27th\n\nLive match coverage (ETERNAL DERBY): Crvena Zvezda-Partizan\n\nUefa Cup match against Zaragoza and heavy loss didnâ€™t seem to bother Zvezdaâ€™s confidence, as they trashed Partizan in Meridian SuperLiga match. It was great game with lot of chances, and Molina opened scoreline with penalty shot in 6th minute. Rukavina played with hand and it was just enough for referee to point to spot. Crvena Zvezda created more chances, but Vedran Djukaricâ€™s decision to put Agassa on goal was good decision as keeper managed to pull 4 great saves. In second half, it was easier for Zvezda as players in red-and-white shirts had high confidence. Two more goal in second period, first from substitute Fenin and then Molina managed to score his second and Zvezdaâ€™s third in this game.

Here is some pre-info:\n\nPartizan\n\nThey have beaten Vlasina, Javor Habitpharm, Borac Cacak and Smederevo to reach this final and fight for their 5th Serbian Cup trophy. Team is very good, combination of youth and experience, and Miroslav Djukic is one of best young managers in world. Most likely, he will field formation 4-2-3-1 or 4-4-2 with Antonio Rukavina as captain. Most dangerous player in his team is Stevan Jovetic, who is 18 years old and can play as attacking midfielder or striker. Zarko Lazetic was last yearâ€™s best scorer in cup, and will want to lift main trophy for first time.\n\nCrvena Zvezda\n\nDelije have most cups in their collection, 10 of them, and will be looking for 3rd straight trophy. Last final they missed was in 1998, when Partizan won against Obilic, and this is chance for Djukaric to put his name on cup. In this seasonâ€™s cup fixtures Radnicki Novi Beograd, Sindjelic Nis, Metalac Gornji Milanovac and Srem lost in their matches against Zvezda, and this is first and last real test for Serbian champions. Players are tired, as they played in Uefa cup semis, and Vedran Djukaric will put his best squad for this match. Most probably they will play in 4-4-2 or 4-4-1-1 formation. Zvezdaâ€™s captain is Dejan Milovanovic. Last yearsâ€™ best player in Serbian cup, Nenad Milijas is really tired and wonâ€™t start match for sure.\n\nRed Star-Partizan 1-1 (1-0) â€“ pen 2-1 (Serbian Cup Final)\n\nScorers: Milovanovic 43â€™\n\nRTS â€“ May, 7th\n\nLive match coverage â€“ Serbian Cup Final: Crvena Zvezda-Partizan\n\nIt was 4th and last eternal derby this season. Marakana was full and both Delije and Grobari were eagerly expecting start of the game. Pressing game was played in first half, with most chances ending behind goal line, and those shots that went into goal were stopped by goalkeepers Disljenkovic and Bozovic. But, corner kick in 43rd minute changed scoreline. Aaritalo crossed from corner and Milovanovic was there to head the ball into net. 1-0 for Crvena Zvezda and Delije were celebrating. Two minutes into second half were enough for Partizan to equalize. Bajalica made an error, passed the ball to Jovetic, who done great solo move trough the middle, lobbing Disljenkovic and getting his 3rd cup goal of the season. From that moment, game went once again into pressing situation, with only real chance coming in 83rd minute. Mika Aaritalo made perfect pass from left, Burzanovic dribbled trough central Partizanâ€™s defense, but his shot was repelled by fantastic Bozovic. Unfortunately for him ball went into Jestrovicâ€™s feet, who managed to miss empty net. Game went into overtime where nothing important happened. But, penalties were real thrill. Crvena Zvezda won 2-1 on penalties with goals coming from Jestrovic and Aaritalo, while Brnovic managed to score only penalty for Partizan.

What can you expect from substitute? Surely, Djukaric didnâ€™t expect from him to score two in first half, but thatâ€™s just what he has done. Crvena Zvezda was dominant, getting most of chances, but failed to convert them into more goal. In injury time of second half, theyâ€™ve conceded goal. Former Zvezdaâ€™s player was scorer of consolidation, Vladimir Mudric.

Team from Lucani already got relegated and wonâ€™t make much pressure on Crvena Zvezdaâ€™s road to win and title. They will most likely field defensive 4-4-2 formation against Zvezdaâ€™s attacking version of same formation. 4 key players in their squad wonâ€™t be available for squad because of injuries and suspensions. That includes starting goalkeeper Dejan Misic, central midfielder Dejan Kostic, key winger Nebojsa Prtenjak and their top scorer this season with 12 goals, Slavisa Jeremic.

He was happy after match in Hannover, as he tested 37 players and new signings fitted in well.

Attacking football has been played and both teams looked good in all lines. It took only 50 seconds for Makiese to score his first goal in Zvezda. Jovetic managed to equalize in 37th, but both teams had chances to score. When everyone thought that match will end 1-1, Mika Aaritalo broke trough Partizanâ€™s left side of defense and scored magnificent goal from edge of penalty area. But, after 45 seconds Jovetic scored another, maybe from offside and match went to overtime. Despite heavy attack on both goals, Kahriman and Disljenkovic were good on goal lines. In 106th minute corner kicked in by Molina, Frode Kippe was highest jumper and headed it in goal. Perfect! Hard pressure from Partizan in last 10 minutes, but they just couldnâ€™t score. Vedran Djukaric took another trophy, once again in front of Partizan. After 5 eternal derbies, Vedran Djukaric has perfect score, two wins in regular, one in overtime, on penalties and a draw.\n\nUefa.com â€“ July, 23rd\n\nRed Star will face Apollon Limassol in second round of UCL qualifications\n\nApollon Limassol will visit Marakana on July, 30th in second round of Uefa Champions League qualifications.

But, late Stojanovic goal was enough for celebration yesterday. It was really nice to see defenders doing their job, and many of reserve players from main squad were playing. It seems like Zvezda is getting in form. However, injury recovered captain Dejan Milovanovic didnâ€™t travel, since he rejected new contract and it is widely expected that he will leave club before match with Apollon.\n\nBlic â€“ July, 25th\n\nTumbasovic changes Novi Sad with capital\n\nMultimillion worth Janko Tumbasovic, Vojvodinaâ€™s central midfielder from Montenegro, signed contract with Crvena Zvezda.

After declining new contract he didnâ€™t travel to friendly match against Galatasaray and wasnâ€™t registered for European competitions, so everyone expected he will leave Crvena Zvezda. Toulouse was first in line, but Valencia stepped in and Milovanovic was seen as bat already. However, Vitesse gave him best contract and he moved to Holland, where he will play together with Barcos. Financial terms were not published, but rumors say it is between 5 and 11mâ‚¬.\n\nSportKlub â€“ July, 30th\n\nGabriel Torje arrived\n\nWith just couple of hours left before match against Apollon Limassol, Vedran Djukaric brought new youngster. Gabriel Torje, 18-years old right winger who played for Poli before joining Steaua will probably be first-team winger in Djukaricâ€™s squad. Steaua earned lot of money in just one season, since they bought him from Poli for 2.6mâ‚¬ and sold him to Crvena Zvezda for 4.6mâ‚¬.\n\nRed Star-Apollon L. 4-1 (1-1) (UCL Qualies Round 2 Leg 1)\n\nScorers: Bajalica 19â€™; Salas 48â€™, 90â€™+4; Molina 58â€™\n\nMOM: Salas (8)\n\nRTS â€“ July, 30th\n\nLive match coverage: Crvena Zvezda-Apollon Limassol\n\nIn front of 15.000 spectators, Crvena Zvezda played just enough to clinch 4-1 home win. Bajalica gave his team lead after corner in 19th minute. But, instant reply for Apollon as Savvidis scored after good counter-attack. Theyâ€™ve worked hard and maintained pressure on home team. Despite creating several chances Zvezda failed to score another in first half. Some tactical alternations in Zvezdaâ€™s game was just enough to dominate second half. Salas scored two goals, grabbing man of match award and Molina also got on scoresheet. In 75th minute referee disallowed perfectly clear and regular goal. It was corner kick for Zvezda, Molina made 1-2 with Aaritalo and crossed into 5-meters area where was Frode Kippe who headed it into goal. Referee said it was offside, but two Limassol players were almost on goal line.\n\nBlic â€“ August, 1st\n\nVladan Grujic â€“ golden boy for Zvezda\n\nDefensive midfielder from Banja Luka, Vladan Grujic, was just 8 months in Crvena Zvezda, as he arrived in Belgrade on January, 1st on free transfer and yesterday he signed 3-year contract with French team Caen. Zvezda will get 2.5mâ‚¬ from this transfer, but it was hard decision for Vedran Djukaric to let him go. Grujic got injured after playing only 3 matches in Zvezda and Delije were not happy with his performances in these 3 games, so he was glad to start new chapter in his life.\n\nUefa.com â€“ August, 1st\n\nTime for revenge\n\nToday in Nion was made draw for Champions League third round of qualifications. First name out of hat was Dynamo Kiev, and Djukaric put his head in hands before official representative announced that they will meet better from Apollon Limassol-Red Star match. Another tie of a round will be meeting of Spanish 4th team, Sevilla and Turkish champions, Galatasaray. Everything Djukaric said after draw was: â€œOsveta! Vendetta! Revenge!â€ and he laughed as he walked in company of Dragan Stojkovic Piksi, Stevan Stojanovic and Dule Savic towards Dynamoâ€™s delegation. They had drink and friendly chat together with president of Apollon Limassol.\n\nApollon L.-Red Star 1-1 (1-1) (UCL Qualies Round 2 Leg 2)\n\nScorers: Drulic 45â€™+2\n\nRTS â€“ August, 6th\n\nLive match coverage: Apollon Limassol-Crvena Zvezda\n\nDespite dominating from first to last whistle, Crvena Zvezda didnâ€™t win in Cyprus. Early shock in fourth minute Gergiou scored for home teamâ€™s lead. Few minutes later, it is 2-0 already, but after consulting with assistant referee decided to disallow Georgiouâ€™s second because he was offside. Then, Crvena Zvezda started playing, dominating in midfield and creating chances, but they only scored once from 14 shots on target. Goran Drulic scored in injury time of first half his first goal in Zvezda after return. Crvena Zvezda will play against Dynamo Kiev in final qualification round. Serbian champion will travel to Ukraine and will play game in Kiev on August, 13th, while game on Marakana is scheduled for August, 27th.\n\nBlic â€“ August, 8th\n\nMilos Vukovic in Ponferradina\n\nDefender Zarko Ciric got transferred earlier this summer to BBVA team Ponferradina and has called his friend Milos Vukovic, 21, to join this team in second Spanish division. Attacking midfielder accepted offer and moved in 325kâ‚¬ deal. This brings Crvena Zvezdaâ€™s total transfer income to over 18mâ‚¬ this summer.\n\nRed Star-Partizan 2-0 (2-0) (Meridian SuperLiga)\n\nScorers: Gueye 10â€™; Aaritalo 36â€™\n\nMOM: Aaritalo (8)\n\nRTS â€“ August, 9th\n\nLive match coverage (ETERNAL DERBY): Crvena Zvezda-Partizan\n\nAlmost full Marakana was expecting another great match between city rivals Crvena Zvezda and Partizan. But, they didnâ€™t expect Zvezdaâ€™s total domination and many Delije are more than happy with their teamâ€™s performance. It all started with two fantastic interventions by Damir Kahriman, as Makiese and Salas had great chances to score. In 10th minute corner kick for Crvena Zvezda, Mika Aaritalo kicked it into penalty area, there was Ibrahima Gueye and guess what? Goal! Crvena Zvezda didnâ€™t stop there, Partizan just couldnâ€™t make 3 pass in row. After great solo move Mika Aaritalo scored in 36th minute. In 44th, Makiese could add another, but his shot was stopped by crossbar. Second half was almost the same, with Partizanâ€™s players getting yellow cards and Zvezda creating chances. Kahriman was in-form and can be very unhappy with his mates in defense. Makiese had to leave field in 76th, as he done cynical foul in central circle. Anyway, that didnâ€™t stop Crvena Zvezda. They still dominated midfield, but only had one good chance, when Barazite had 1-on-1 chance, but Kahriman was great. In just one year six eternal derbies, and Djukic has to find way to beat Crvena Zvezda.\n\nBlic â€“ August, 10th\n\nZvezda lost wingback\n\nGrzegorz Bronowicki played in yesterdayâ€™s eternal derby win for Crvena Zvezda, but after match he went to Nikola Tesla airport. His final destination is St. Etienne, as everything was arranged two days ago, but media found it out after game. Transfer details are not known, but many experts are saying that deal under 5mâ‚¬ would not make Djukaric let his best wingback. During next three weeks, Zvezda will be looking list of potential players in defense.\n\nDynamo Kiev-Red Star 0-2 (0-1) (UCL Qualies Round 3 Leg 1)\n\nScorers: Makiese 30â€™; Tumbasovic 90â€™+4\n\nMOM: Tumbasovic (8)\n\nRTS â€“ August, 13th\n\nLive match coverage: Dynamo-Crvena Zvezda\n\nHistory reoccurred. Just like almost year ago, in Kiev, Crvena Zvezda won 2-0. It was hard game with lot of play in midfield, but without real chances. In 30th minute Gabriel Torje managed to get trough, crossed ball from right, Cris Makiese run onto ball and boom. Thatâ€™s a goal. Crvena Zvezda maintained the lead and was happy with result and 300 Delije which travelled to Kiev were amazed with perfect finish from midfielder. It is great lead before second leg on Marakana, which will be played in 14 days. Looks like Crvena Zvezda is ready for Champions League!\n\nRed Star-Bezanija 1-0 (1-0) (Meridian SuperLiga)\n\nScorers: Kippe 30â€™\n\nMOM: Kippe (7)\n\nBlic â€“ August, 18th\n\nGreat start for Crvena Zvezda\n\nIn not so good match yesterday, Zvezda played just enough to grab minimal win against Bezanija. Only goal was scored after corner by Frode Kippe in 30th minute. Mika Aaritalo was noted as assister. Spectators couldnâ€™t see much in this game, but Bezanija was close to equalize in 87th minute when Mihajlovic hit the post. Just one minute before Luka Elsner was sent off because of tackle from behind. He was also last man of Zvezdaâ€™s defense.\n\nUefa.com â€“ August, 20th\n\nValencia gets new player\n\nVedran Djukaric tried his best to keep Mika Aaritalo, but offers just keep coming in his mailbox. After speaking to Dragan Stojkovic Piksi, Djukaric accepted offer of 11mâ‚¬ + 50% of future transfer for Mika Aaritalo. Finnish player came in Belgrade last season, playing 41 official games for Serbian Champions and crowning himself with all three trophies in Serbia. Great piece of business for Zvezda, as winger arrived from TPS Turku for just 350kâ‚¬.\n\nVojvodina-Red Star 2-4 (1-0)\n\nScorers: Drulic 53â€™; Molina 61â€™; Jestrovic 88â€™; Gueye 90â€™+1\n\nMOM: Molina (8)\n\nSportKlub â€“ August, 23rd\n\nLive match coverage: Vojvodina-Crvena Zvezda\n\nDespite being on wrong foot for most of the game, Crvena Zvezda won match on Karadjordje. Dunjic gave Vojvodina early lead and home team kept pressure on opposition goalkeeper, but Disljenkovic was great. Second half started with goals from Drulic after solo move and Molinaâ€™s free kick. In 75th minute Trivunovic equalized and had another chance when he hit crossbar. Late goals from Jestrovic and Gueye gave Crvena Zvezda another three points, and Djukaric can be very happy with result.\n\nBlic â€“ August, 24th\n\nYoung Israelian wi"
