This article analyses focus group discussions with women who completed Healing Trauma to examine the legitimacy of developing trauma-informed practice in prisons. The womens testimonies indicate that Healing Trauma offers a mean ingful opportunity to begin to explore past victimisation that has contributed to their crim inalisation.\n\nStorm Ervin, Jahnavi Jagannath, Janine Zweig, Janeen Buck Willison, Kierra B.

Trauma-Informed Victim Services and Programs for Incarcerated Women\n\nUrban Institute. October 2020\n\nMany women bring past trauma into prison settings, where they often experience similar violence, abuse, and trauma as they experienced on the outside. As the population of women incarcerated in the US grows, so does the dire need for services that address trauma and victimization. Given that incarceration can be inherently retraumatizing and many justice-involved women have experienced trauma, correctional facilities are uniquely positioned to serve as de facto victim service providers.\n\nMany facilities rely on peer support programs and peer mentors. These may also be called survival coaches or peer navigators. Such programs allow incarcerated women to assist other women.\n\nKristen M.

This study reviewed 36 months of postrelease data for nearly 10,000 New Jersey state inmates released in 2013 to ascertain the rearrest rate of those diagnosed with mental illness, substance use disorders, both, or neither. We also examined whether certain characteristics suggestive of higher risk of psychiatric decompensation were associated with higher rates of rearrest...\n\nAamna Mohdin, Pamela Duncan\n\n# Mentally ill prisoners face months-long waits for hospital transfer\n\nwww.theguardian.com/ Sun 21 Apr 2019\n\nGovernment guidelines in England and Wales stipulate that prisoners who are acutely mentally ill should be transferred to a hospital within 14 days of the first medical recommendation. But according to an analysis of Ministry of Justice data, hundreds of prisoners a year are being left awaiting adequate treatment. The data shows that in some cases prisoners with mental health problems wait for six months from officials receiving an application for transfer of a prisoner to the prisoners eventual admission to hospital.\n\nHeather Stringer\n\n# Improving mental health for inmates\n\nwww.apa.org/ March 2019, Vol 50, No. 3\n\nThe unfortunate truth is that despite improvements over the past 30 years, the correctional system continues to struggle to meet the vast needs of the increasing number of inmates with mental health conditions... About 37 percent of people in prison have a history of mental health problems, according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Department of Justice. More than 24 percent have been previously diagnosed with major depressive order, 17 percent with bipolar disorder, 13 percent with a personality disorder and 12 percent with post-traumatic stress disorder. The numbers are even higher for people in jail, where one-third have been previously diagnosed with major depressive disorder and almost onequarter with bipolar disorder.\n\nShelby Hayne\n\n# An Analysis and Critique of Mental Health Treatment in American State Prisons and Proposal for Improved Care\n\nhttps://scholarship.claremont.edu/scripps_theses/1256, December 14 2018\n\nThe large-scale housing of prisoners is extremely expensive, with the average cost of each inmate in state prisons measured at $33,274 per year in the year 2015.

The most commonly reported healthcare cost was for primary medical care. Healthcare costs reporting varied widely, and few countries were comparable. We developed a set of guidelines for consistent and transparent reporting of healthcare costs... Few countries report the costs of healthcare services in prison. When reported, there is a lack of clarity and consistency as to what is included. Using the proposed reporting guidelines would enable national trends and international comparisons to be investigated, and any recommended benchmarks to be monitored.\n\nSebastian Schildbach, Carola Schildbach\n\n# Criminalization Through Transinstitutionalization: A Critical Review of the Penrose Hypothesis in the Context of Compensation Imprisonment\n\nwww.frontiersin.org/ October 2018\n\nIn 1939, the English scientist Lionel Penrose found an inverse correlation between the size of psychiatric inpatient clinics and the number of detainees based on cross-sectional data from diverse European countries. His assumption that the number of psychiatric hospital beds was inversely related to the size of prison populations was later termed the Penrose hypothesis. A common expression summarizing Penrose's findings is transinstitutionalization, which refers to a process where mentally ill individuals, who are discharged from, or no longer admitted to, mental hospitals, are frequently found in prisons. Even 80 years after its formulation, the Penrose hypothesis has neither been rejected nor confirmed. Despite repeated observations of transinstitutionalization, and an increase of the numbers of imprisoners, it is still unclear whether there is an association between capacities in psychiatric clinics and prison sizes.\n\nMathieu Nacher, Gulen Ayhan, Romain Arnal, Célia Basurko, Florence Huber, Agathe Pastre, Louis Jehel, Bruno Falissard, Vincent About\n\n# High prevalence rates for multiple psychiatric conditions among inmates at French Guianas correctional facility: diagnostic and demographic factors associated with violent offending and previous incarceration\n\nMC Psychiatry (2018) 18:159\n\nMentally ill detainees should benefit from effective screening, case identification and psychiatric care on arrival, ongoing care during the period of incarceration and pre-release arrangements for ongoing care in the community following release from custody. The goals of the correctional facilities and the psychiatric system are different but they may not always be antagonistic. Improved recognition and care of persons with mental illness in prison settings may improve outcomes for affected individuals and for public security.\n\nJesse T Young, Ed Heffernan, Rohan Borschmann, James R P Ogloff, Matthew J Spittal, Fiona G Kouyoumdjian, David B Preen, Amanda Butler, Lisa Brophy, Julia Crilly, Stuart A Kinner\n\n# Dual diagnosis of mental illness and substance use disorder and injury in adults recently released from prison: a prospective cohort study\n\nwww.thelancet.com/ April 18, 2018\n\nPeople with mental illness and substance use disorder are over-represented in prisons. Injury-related mortality is elevated in people released from prison, and both mental illness and substance use disorder are risk factors for injury. Effective care coordination during the transition between criminal justice and community service providers improves health outcomes for people released from prison. However, the health outcomes and support needs of people with dual diagnosis (co-occurring mental illness and substance use disorder) released from prison are poorly understood. Here we aim to examine the association between dual diagnosis and non-fatal injury in adults released from prison.\n\nHouse of Commons. Committee of Public Accounts\n\n# Mental health in prisons.

These problems are even more evident in the USA (22 beds per 100 000 population), where prisons have replaced standalone mental hospitals as the largest institutions that house people with severe mental illness.\n\nEuropean Court of Human Rights\n\n# Detention and mental health # Fr\n\nwww.echr.coe.int/ Press Unit July 2017\n\nThe [European] Court [of Human Rights] has held on many occasions that the detention of a person who is ill may raise issues under Article 3 of the [European] Convention [on Human Rights, which prohibits inhuman or degrading treatment] ... and that the lack of appropriate medical care may amount to treatment contrary to that provision .. . In particular, the assessment of whether the particular conditions of detention are incompatible with the standards of Article 3 has, in the case of mentally ill persons, to take into consideration their vulnerability and their inability , in some cases, to complain coherently or at all about how they are being affected by any particular treatment ...\n\nNational Audit Office NAO\n\n# Mental health in prisons\n\nwww.nao.org.uk/ 29 June 2017\n\nAround one in four adults are diagnosed with a mental illness during their life and many more will experience changes in their mental well-being.

The number of prisoners with mental health or well-being problems is likely to be higher, because some people may not be receiving treatment.

Similarly, 37% of prisoners and 44% of jail inmates had been told in the past by a mental health professional that they had a mental disorder. Half of prisoners (50%) and a third of jail inmates (36%) either did not meet the threshold for SPD or had not been told they had a mental health disorder.\n\nStanford Justice Advocacy Project\n\n# The Prevalence And Severity Of Mental Illness Among California Prisoners On The Rise\n\nhttps://www-cdn.law.stanford.edu/ May 2017\n\nOver 30 percent of California prisoners currently receive treatment for a serious mental disorder, an increase of 150 percent since 2000. California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) estimates that the population of prisoners with mental illness will continue to climb, increasing the need for additional psychiatric services in the years to come. Furthermore, there is evidence that CDCRs projections underestimate the current number of prisoners with mental illness. In addition, the severity of psychiatric symptoms of state prisoners is on the rise.\n\nMargaret Heslin, Lynne Callaghan, Barbara Barrett, Susan Lea, Susan Eick, John Morgan, Mark Bolt, Graham Thornicroft, Diana Rose, Andrew Healey, Anita Patel\n\n# Costs of the police service and mental healthcare pathways experienced by individuals with enduring mental health needs\n\nhttp://bjp.rcpsych.org/ The British Journal of Psychiatry, 2017, 210:157-164\n\nIn the UK, the importance of investment in the interface between National Health Service (NHS) mental health services and the criminal justice system has been highlighted, and research has identified substantial gaps between the sectors for individuals with enduring moderate to severe mental health needs. Mental health disorders are costly to society, with estimates of healthcare costs in England at around £22.5 billion per year,5 exclusive of indirect costs such as costs to the criminal justice system. In light of recommendations from key policy documents in recent years, this study aimed to map current care pathways between mental health services and the police, to estimate the costs to each sector and to explore, by decision modelling, the potential cost impacts of implementing enhanced care pathways based on key policy recommendations in recent years.\n\nFredrick E. Vars, Shelby B. Calambokidis\n\n# From Hospitals to Prisons: A New Explanation\n\nCornell Law Review Online, vol 102:101, 2017\n\nPrisons today are as atrocious for people with mental illness as mental hospitals used to be. And the remedies sought by plaintiffs in prison reform litigation could be quite expensive for the state. Alternative treatment in the community may finally be seen as the more attractive option. It will be too late for Jamie, but if our theory is correct and if prison litigation succeeds more broadly, we may incline toward a second deinstitutionalization  this time from prison rather than mental hospitals.\n\nSeena Fazel\n\n# Response to The Use of Meta-Analysis to Compare and Select Offender Risk Instruments\n\nInt J Forensic Ment Health. 2017 ; 16(1): 1617\n\nWe found potential conflict of interests common in the risk assessment literature and little transparency in whether they were declared despite journal policies. In fact, none of the 25 studies where a tool designer or translator was one of the authors of a validity study disclosed a financial or non-financial conflict interest, despite many of the journals in which these studies appeared explicitly requesting such information. We note that the current piece states, We have never advocated that assessors predict that an offender will or will not recidivate.\n\nSean Kim, Gayoung Lee, Eric Kim, Hyejin Jung, Jongwha Chang\n\n# Quetiapine Misuse and Abuse: Is it an Atypical Paradigm of Drug Seeking Behavior?\n\nJ Res Pharm Pract. 2017 Jan-Mar; 6(1): 1215.\n\nNumerous early reports and case studies focused on illicit use in incarcerated populations, which are at high risk of quetiapine MUA.[11,12,13] In most cases, MUA of AAs are shown to be associated with forensic settings such as incarceration, court-ordered hospitalization, or other oversight by the legal system. Numerous case reports and several systematic studies have shown that quetiapine MUA is not confined to penal populations; it also occurs in other settings such as psychiatric inpatients, outpatients, and patients attending drug treatment clinics...\n\nCate Graziani, Liat Ben-Moshe, Haile Eshe Cole\n\n# Beyond Alternatives to Incarceration and Confinement\n\nhttps://grassrootsleadership.org/ April 2017\n\nThe deinstitutionalization of mental health facilities in recent decades can be perceived as the most successful alternative to incarceration ever attempted in the U.S. on a mass scale... This pervasive narrative of the backlash of deinstitutionalization reduces a much more complex process and puts the blame on an easy target, deinstitutionalization, and away from discussions of neoliberal policies that led simultaneously to the growth of the prison system and to the lack of financial support for people with disabilities to live in the community...\n\nLiat Ben-Moshe\n\n# Why Prisons Are Not The New Asylums\n\nPunishment and Society 19 (3) 2017\n\nThe new asylums thesis posits that 'deinstitutionalization → homelessness → imprisonment.' I hope this paper has demonstrated that people did not become homeless because of deinstitutionalization, or because they needed to be in institutions. People are unsheltered because of economic inequalities that left them unhoused, including the shrinkage of the safety net, cuts in public services, erosion in living wages and policies that made affordable and accessible housing out of reach, especially for those already marginalized. Blaming deinstitutionalization diverts attention from these structural violence. In addition it makes it appear as if hospitalization and institutionalization were a panacea but disability based institutions and psychiatric hospitals should not be residential placements or alternatives to housing.\n\nAlejandro Calvo Schwarzwälder\n\n# Mental Disorder and Crime\n\nhttps://crimeandlawblog.com/ 18-19 enero, 2017\n\nPrison inmates have high rates of mental disorders compared with the general population. While this may imply a causal relationship between mental disorder and crime, disparate research results do not allow for such a conclusion to be drawn. However, mental disorders are intertwined with several risk factors for criminal activity, such as poverty, unemployment, lack of social support and substance abuse... Treatment alone cannot be expected to reduce recidivism and criminality. The most effective rehabilitative programmes in terms of improving criminal justice outcomes are those which address the whole social context of the offenders as well as their clinical symptoms.\n\nState of Washington Office of Financial Management\n\n# Jail Diversion for People with Mental Illness in Washington State\n\nwww.ofm.wa.gov/ November 21, 2016\n\nRecent Washington study showed that, among people entering jail who were enrolled in Medicaid or recently had been, 55 percent had a psychotic disorder a nd/or a mental health diagnosis such as depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder; this compares to just 34 percent of the general adult Medicaid population... Clearly, diverting more of these individuals from jail to community-based mental health treatment could aid them in living in the community, rather than returning repeatedly to jail. Diversion has the potential to cut crimina l justice system costs, reduce recidivism, and provide more effective mental health treatment for offenders. It also would represent a more humane response to individuals in jail who have a mental health disorder...\n\nDoris A. Fuller, Elizabeth Sinclair, John Snook\n\n# Released, Relapsed, Rehospitalized\n\nwww.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/ November 2016\n\nRehospitalization is viewed clinically as a poor outcome. Psychiatric patients who are rehospitalized experience reduced continuity of care and quality of life compared with those who are not. Their caretakers are often demoralized. Rehospitalization is also costly, and rehospitalization for serious mental illness is especially costly. Schizophrenia and mood disorders, including bipolar, account for more readmissions of Medicaid patients than any other medical conditions. Schizophrenia hospitalization alone cost $11.5 billion in 2013, of which $646 million resulted from readmission within 30 days of discharge.\n\nArthur Robinson Williams\n\n# Opportunities in Reform: Bioethics and Mental Health Ethics\n\nBioethics, 2016 May, 30(4): 221226\n\nThe burden of mental illness is even greater at the margins of society.

You will quickly discover that quetiapine rivals bupropion as an abused medication. Inmates prize its effects on sleep, and it also seems to provide a relaxing effect. Many inmates will claim to have psychotic symptoms in an effort to obtain quetiapine. For some reason, they dont seem as interested in olanzapine.\n\nGary Cordner | Community Oriented Policing Services\n\n# People with Mental Illness\n\nwww.cops.usdoj.gov/ May 2006\n\nNeither jail nor prison is a good setting for mental health treatment, if such treatment is even available. People with mental illness often get worsewhile incarcerated, and tragedies involving victimization and suicide are too common.66 In the long run, criminal justice incarceration of the mentally ill harms the lives of those people, interferes with the proper operation of jails and prisons, and accomplishes little or no long-term solution to the original crime-and-disorder problems that led to arrest and incarceration in the first place. Referral, treatment, and civil commitment for people with mental illness should be preferred over arrest and criminal justice incarceration as reasonses to minor crime-and-disorder problems.\n\nKiran Sukeri, Orlando A.

There are twenty two psychologists in all correctional centres in South Africa. None of the correctional centres have an onsite psychiatric unit. A serious implication of this is that an increasing number of mentally ill persons are incarcerated due to the lack of initial assessments...\n\nHuman Rights Watch\n\n# France: Inadequate Mental Health Care in Prisons.

When their condition deteriorates, prisoners with psychosocial disabilities are in some cases transferred to psychiatric hospitals against their will and isolated in conditions that can constitute cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment under international law, Human Rights Watch found. I prefer 1,000 times to be in a cell than in an isolated room in the hospital, my arms and feet tied down as if I were an animal, said Sarah (pseudonym), a prisoner who has previously been sent to psychiatric hospitals...\n\nHuman Rights Watch\n\n# Double Punishment.

In 1955, there was one psychiatric bed in public hospitals for every 300 people. By 2004, there was to one bed per 3,000 people and correctional facilities were housing three times more people with serious mental illness than hospitals (Torrey et al, 2010). Ironically, New York actually closed a State psychiatric hospital only to re-open the same set of buildings as a correctional facility to serve inmates with several mental illnesses\n\nPatrick R.

The first concern, in the 1980s, posited BZs as an epidemic of excessive prescribing and was frequently mentioned in books, movies, and numerous lay magazine articles. There was also concern that BZs were abused or misused, caused addiction with difficult withdrawal symptoms, or taken without medical supervision by large numbers of people.\n\nCasey Tolan\n\n# A psychologist is leading the largest jail in America and helping rethink incarceration and mental health\n\nhttp://fusion.net/ October 20, 2015\n\nCHICAGOHome to about 10,000 inmates, Cook County Jail takes up a huge swath of land on Chicagos southwest side. Its the largest single jail in America, and because about a third of its inmates are mentally ill, it also doubles as the largest mental health institution in the country. So it makes sense that the jails new warden, Nneka Jones Tapia, is a clinical psychologist.

Although the current evidence base for the effects of psychosocial interventions is sizable, subsequent steps in the process of bringing a psychosocial intervention into routine clinical care are less well defined. The data from research supporting these interventions have not been well synthesized, and it can be difficult for consumers, providers, and payers to know what treatments are effective.

This new role for them reflects, to a great extent, the limited availability of communitybased outpatient and residential mental health programs and resources, and the lack of alternatives to incarceration for men and women with mental disabilities who have engaged in minor offenses...

Less well publicized is the failure of state governments to keep up with the increasing need for hospitalization within correctional systems and in some cases the withdrawal of hospital services for mentally disordered inmates in need of this level of care.

While some committed violent crimes and remain a threat to themselves or other inmates and prison staff, many are incarcerated for minor offenses, simply because there is no place to send them for treatment. The number of mentally ill inmates has mushroomed in recent years as states have closed their psychiatric hospitals in favor of outpatient community mental health centers that typically are underfunded and overcrowded. In an attempt to reduce the influx of mentally ill inmates, some 300 specialized mental health courts have diverted them into court-monitored treatment instead of jail.\n\nSarah Glowa-Kollisch, Jasmine Graves, Nathaniel Dickey, Ross MacDonald, Zachary Rosner, Anthony Waters, Homer Venters\n\n# Data-Driven Human Rights: Using Dual Loyalty Trainings to Promote the Care of Vulnerable Patients in Jail\n\nwww.hhrjournal.org/ Health and Human Rights 17/1 on March 12, 2015\n\nDual loyalty is an omnipresent feature of correctional health. As part of a human rights quality improvement committee, and utilizing the unique advantage of a fully integrated electronic health record system, we undertook an assessment of dual loyalty in the New York City jail system.

In other words, a decrease in prison population will not go without a corresponding increase in community mental health and substance abuse services. Social voids like those created by deinstitutionalization must be filled; and with states deinstitutionalizing offenders the toll is on their corresponding communities to address the needs of those offenders who are reentering after being incarcerated. In devising a policy and practice strategy to address the projected increase in the reentry population, leadership within communities for social and supportive services to ex-prisoners, specifically treatment services should be of primary concern.\n\nHolly M.

Despite consistent scholarly attention to mental illness in corrections facilities, only two federal self-report surveys are typically cited, and they may not represent the extent of relevant data. This systematic review was conducted to develop a broader picture of mental illness prevalence in U.S. state prisons and to identify methodological challenges to obtaining accurate and consistent estimates.\n\nMarin County Civil Grand Jury\n\n# Jail Checkup: Whats the Price of a Clean Bill of Health? Report Date  June 10, 2014\n\nwww.marincounty.org/ Public Release Date  June 13, 2014\n\nSome very specific needs of the mentally ill incarcerated in our Jail must be addressed, whether or not a contractual arrangement is struck for outside medical services. Among the most challenging issues facing Jail administrators is the need to make some accommodation for mentally ill inmates who are candidates for involuntary psychiatric medication. The mentally ill, whether in custody or not, have the right to refuse medication. Without their informed consent, involuntary medication is available only in circumstances in which the patient is a danger to himself or others or in which the patient is severely disabled as a result of the mental illness.\n\nEric B Elbogen, Sally C Johnson\n\n# Violence, suicide, and all-cause mortality\n\nThe Lancet Psychiatry, Volume 1, Issue 1, Pages 6 - 8, June 2014\n\nOne of the unique aspects of this studythat violence and suicide were analysed simultaneouslyhas an important implication for how we as a society perceive people with mental illness. News coverage of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders often focuses on violence and crime. Much less attention is paid to suicide and self-harm in people with severe mental illnesses. Notably, multivariate analyses in this article showed a substantially stronger link between schizophrenia and suicide than between schizophrenia and violence.\n\nDarrell Steinberg, David Mills, Michael Romano | Stanford Law Schools Three Strikes Project\n\n# When did prisons become acceptable mental healthcare facilities?\n\nwww.law.stanford.edu/ May 2014\n\nWe can no longer ignore the massive oppression we are inflicting upon the mentally ill throughout the United States. Although deinstitutionalization was originally understood as a humane way to offer more suitable services to the mentally ill in community-based settings, some politicians seized upon it as a way to save money by shutting down institutions without providing any meaningful treatment alternatives. This callousness has created a one-way road to prison for massive numbers of impaired individuals and the inhumane warehousing of thousands of mentally ill people.\n\nShirley S.

They found a significant 45% drop in convictions for violent crime, such as homicide, assault, robbery or any sexual offense, during periods when the individuals were thought to be taking their medications, based on prescription and dispensing records, regardless of their diagnosis, compared with when they were off meds.

Thus, it may seem surprising that attempts to establish federal guidelines for mental health services under health insurance plans did not take place until the 1970s. Yet the fact that health insurance coverage for mental health services differs drastically from that of other medical services is not as startling when taking into account mental healths history, and its complete isolation from the medical field.\n\nGeorge Szmukler, Rowena Daw, Felicity Callard\n\n# Mental health law and the UN Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities\n\nInt J Law Psychiatry.

Particularly challenging under the CRPD is the scope, if any, for involuntary treatment.

Graduation from a MHC has been found to be a major predictor of reduced recidivism; yet few studies have examined factors affecting MHC graduation. This study examines what participants brought to MHC, their processing in MHC, and their behaviors during MHC. It found that noncompliant participant behaviors during MHC had the strongest impact on graduation, increasing the odds of failure to graduate and reducing, if not eliminating, the direct effects on completion of the risk factors participants brought into court.\n\nHans Joachim Salize, Juha Lavikainen, Allan Seppänen, Milazim Gjocaj\n\n# Developing forensic mental healthcare in Kosovo\n\nFront.

Since that time, studies have suggested that the mentally ill are arrested and incarcerated at levels that exceed both their representation in the general popu-lation and their tendency to commit serious crimes. Estimates suggest that 14% of offenders (more than one million people) in the criminal justice system in the United States suffer from serious mental illnesses.

A recent survey conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics concluded that about 200,000 prisoners are sexually abused each year. Most of the abused prisoners are misplaced psychiatric patients who make especially vulnerable targets because they are less able to defend themselves and to be believed if they report infractions. Although prison is clearly not the right place for psychiatric patients, almost a million are behind bars for crimes that could have been avoided if there were proper community treatment. Because there isn't, prison has become the default disposition for those patients who can't make it on their own.
