Chris C. Ibe #AYCRIB for the information and recommendation to the World Federation Against Drugs, WFAD body as Member. Being here does feel like home to me as a trained volunteer, early childhood education activist, law person and youth ambassador. It is all of our collective responsibility to fight for a drug-free world, and we must all work together to ensure that the legal and social rights of users' are never violated. Thank you WFAD for the honor and I also look forward to an engaging collaboration with everyone. Warm regards. #WFAD"
