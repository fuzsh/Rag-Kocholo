He will resign anytime this week together with others.\n\nInstead of sepaking for himself and his family, Dingombi said that the people in constituency have realized the need to align themselves with the PF government because of its development agenda.\n\nDingombi said the councillors and the party officials have decided to defect because they want to develop their area in line with the PF programmes.\n\nThe other defectors include Moses Kahyata, Kaula ward councillor who is also the constituency youth chairperson, Godfrey Hakatoka, Chitebe ward councillor and Goeffrey Kakoma who is the MMD Kabompo east constituency secretary.\n\nAnd receiving the defectors north western province minister Stephen Masumba thanked the councillors and the party officials for their bold decision and assured them that the PF party will protect their sacrifice.\n\nMr Masumba said he was happy that he was not alone who realized that the MMD has no future to meet the aspirations of the people.\n\nBy Ihechukwu Njoku\n\nNigerian Pastor T.B. Joshua, well known for his expansive philanthropic endeavours, shocked congregants at his church, The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations (SCOAN) on Sunday 18th November 2012 when it was revealed he has sponsored a Nigerian student to study a PhD in the University of Oxford to the tune of £100,000, approximately N26 million.\n\nMiss Yinka Oduwole, who introduced herself as one of the youth who was brought up in The SCOAN and worked there extensively, testified how she had gained admission to study a PhD in Engineering Science in Oxford University, UK after a successful Master’s Programme in University College London (UCL). Yinka, who was equally sponsored in her Master’s Degree in Broadband Communication in UCL in which she came out with a distinction, said Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners had paid the sum of £100,000 to enable her to study for a PhD in the prestigious Oxford University.\n\n“My advice to youth all over the world is that they should pray as if everything depends on God and work as if everything depends on them,” Yinka, also a First-Class graduate from the University of Lagos, told the congregation and viewers worldwide on Emmanuel TV, equally counselling the youth to find a job in the church and actively engage in godly activities.\n\nTB Joshua also revealed in the service how footballer Ogenyi Onazi, the SS Lazio starlet who was recently promoted to the Super Eagles of Nigeria and scored on his debut against Venezuela, was brought up in the church and worked there as well before attaining his current sporting success. Joshua revealed how he had sponsored Onazi and his colleague Sani Emmanuel to trial in clubs around the world including Premier League giants Chelsea and Tottenham, before arriving in SS Lazio, where he is currently playing for the senior team. Joshua revealed that close to $1m was spent in this process, to ensure the duo went to the right club to reach the heights of their potential.\n\nAccording to Joshua, the reward for raising up such young people to become leaders of tomorrow in every field of expertise is immeasurable in monetary or material terms. “What you make happens for others, God makes happen for you. You are raised to raise others,” Joshua exhorted the crowd, counselling them to consider the future of their own children and what they were doing with their lives.\n\nForbes estimated that Joshua has spent up to $20m in charitable activities alone in the last three years. Thousands of less privileged students are currently studying in universities across Nigeria and around the world courtesy of SCOAN’s scholarship program.\n\nhe Zambian government has embarked on a process of repealing the Statutory Instrument (bylaw) of 2010 which restricts the entry of a fourth mobile network operator into the country before it can license a new licence.\n\nTransport, Works, Supply and Communication Minister Christopher Yaluma said a team of technocrats is currently working on modalities that would ascertain the coming of the fourth mobile operator in the country.\n\nThe minister said that there was still paperwork the Zambian government was working on before it would give a licence to the fourth mobile operator and that it was just a policy pronouncement which needs to be implemented.\n\n“There is still paper work that is being worked on before we go ahead and give a licence to the fourth mobile operator, once all the paper work is done, we can allow a fourth operator to come and boost the communication sector,” Yaluma said.\n\nFrom the time the market was opened for new operators, the Zambian government has not yet received any application from any mobile operator, according to Yaluma.\n\nHe said that licence would not be given now as the regulator is first required to look at issues to do with the frequency where the operator would be operating from.\n\n“But most importantly we need to over ride the Statutory Instrument (SI) that stops the coming of the fourth mobile operator in the country,” he said.\n\nYaluma said the Zambian government would ensure that it attracts more investment to the communication sector as it plays a vital role towards development.\n\nBy Jeff Mbewe\n\nArguments, discrepancy, confrontation and conflict came into sight among a people across our nation, most of which are politicians, civil societies, youths and women; owing to the suspension of 3 judges who were to face a probe by then, allotted Malawian Judge Lovemore Chikopa.\n\nAccording to president Sata, this mission is in the nation’s best interest that is to restore judicial confidence among citizenry- a move which sprang owing to the supposedly corrupt and biased behaviour the named Judges demonstrated during the case involving DBZ vs JCN,Post Newspapers ltd & Mutembo Nchito.\n\nThose opposed Michael Sata did so because they saw the whole thing as witch-hunting technique by the ruling PF aimed at humiliating and instilling fear among opposition members. It was also seen as a gimmick aimed at helping M’membe defraud taxpayers in a fracas pertaining to the 14 billion court case- seen that M’membe’s post played a role in helping Sata into plot one by endo rsing him and denouncing the former ruling party.\n\nUntil today, judicial reform call has remained a nightmare because it has faced massive antagonism by some opposition parties, civil societies and the judiciary itself. However, our anxiety over the judicial imperfection is beyond M’membe ‘s case. And what if M’membe is not guilty??\n\nIt is very much possible that M’membe was just being reprimanded by the former ruling party under the helm of Rupiah- for not endorsing their policy of governance citing rampant corruption practised by MMD which the entire country witnessed and condemned including those who are against judicial reforms today such as HH and Milupi.\n\nWe should not hinder the wish of many people by simply denying them what they want for their nation just because we hate post and M’membe for endorsing Sata.A lot of people want to see a clean judiciary because a lot of these people have had the most cruel experiences due to our inn -equitable judiciary. Again this reform should not be about freeing M’membe nor it should be retribution or crucification- it should be about purification of the judicial system to reinstate public confidence.\n\nLet’s learn from Kenya. It seems with Zambia, judicial reforms are a very big deal but this is worisome to those of us who value democracy, rule of law and human rights. Judicial inequity is affecting the less privileged. Corruption and injustice undermines the investment climate and development effectiveness.\n\nAnd it bears especially heavily on poor people, who have fewer resources if nothing than better off to pay bribes. Impartial, dependable and reasonable speedy judicial systems and associated enforcement mechanism is important for the investment climate, and hence the economic growth of our nation.\n\nBut it is indeed disheartening to note that even civil societies who are supposedly fighting poverty, dis proportion and promoting economic growth, democracy, rule of law and human rights are against judicial reforms in collaboration with politicians and some legal scholars. Our question is what is damn wrong with Judicial Reforms??\n\nA 34-year-old man died while receiving treatment from a local traditional healer after his manhood allegedly remained up after sleeping with a married woman.\n\nThe man has been identified as Shelton Dinganga of Zaranyika Road, Mambo.\n\nAccording to neighbours, the matter which had been kept as a family secret by the man’s relatives occurred last week. The neighbours said they were shocked when they were only informed about Dinganga’s death and not his illness. They said Dinganga had sex with a relative’s wife and his sexual organ remained erect while his other private parts became swollen.\n\n“Dinganga had suddenly disappeared from public life after coming back from Kwekwe where he had visited one of the family relatives whom he was said to be flirting with. We were shocked when his family members later informed us of his death and burial arrangements on Tuesday morning,” a neighbour told the local press.\n\nThe neighbour said it was during Dinganga’s burial at Mkoba Cemetery on Wednesday last week when mourners later got the shocking news that he died when his sexual organ remained erect after having sex with a female relative in Kwekwe.\n\nWhen our news crew visited the house yesterday, Dinganga’s aunt, Ms Janet Gama confirmed the death.\n\nShe, however, refused to shed light on the causes of his death.\n\n“Why do you want to know what caused the death of our relative? Yes he died at home and he had declined to be taken to the hospital but to then narrate the whole issue about Dinganga’s illness and subsequent passing away will not bring his life back,” said Ms Gama.\n\n-myzimbabwe\n\nA woman who called herself the ‘Black Madam’ will stand trial on murder charges for allegedly performing illegal buttocks-enhancing procedures on a Nigerian-born woman,Claudia Aderotimi who later died in her Philadelphia hotel.\n\nA judge upheld third-degree murder charges during a preliminary hearing today against Padge Gordon, who is also known as Padge Windslowe, 40.\n\nThe ruling comes after a friend of the dancer testified today that she and 20-year-old Claudia Aderotimi came to Philadelphia last year and had their buttocks enlarged.\n\nWindslowe’s defense attorney argued that both girls knew his client was not a real doctor as they had visited her for the injections before.\n\nTheresa Gyamfi said the ‘Black Madam’ gave them silicone injections in their hotel room — but then fled when Aderotimi went into respiratory distress.\n\nA doctor testified that the industrial-grade, not medical grade, silicone went to Aderotimi’s blood, liver, lungs and brain.\n\nShe was rushed to a Delaware County hospital in an ambulance, but died within hours of a pulmonary embolism, according to the doctor.\n\nBut defense lawyer Christopher Mannix said he will challenge those medical conclusions at trial, along with allegations his client performed the injections.\n\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer said that prosecutors told the court she painted herself out to be a medical professional when she administered a series of injections to the two women.\n\nThis was the second time the woman went to Windslowe, paying $1,800 to $2,300 a time to have their butts enlarged.\n\nBy CECILIA ZULU | Daily Mail\n\nZAMBIA’s Sylvester Mwila has won silver at the All-Africa Olympia Body-building Championship in Harare.\n\nThe impressive Mwila, who is Mr Zambia, took the runner-up position in a field of over 250 musclemen from 12 countries. This earned him US$1,500 (about K8 million).\n\nThe competition held on Saturday drew body-builders from Botswana, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia, South Africa and hosts Zimbabwe.\n\nA South Africa took gold, a Zimbabwean was a bronze medalist and Zambia’s Moses Mwape finished fourth.\n\nOther Zambian body-builders who competed were Nduna Shanabwato, Lloyd Kyusa, Joseph Mofya and Samuel Hamiwe. They all walked away with a medal of participation for finishing in the top 10.\n\nZambia Body Building Federation (ZBBF) general secretary Lee Mukupa, who released the results yesterday, said the tournament helped to expose the musclemen to international tournaments.\n\nMukupa said the event was an eye-opener.\n\nThis was the first time that Zambian body-builders were competing in an international tournament.\n\n“This is good for body-building. At least they have gained experience. They met with different body-builders across Africa and that was good for them. They have learnt a lot from their friends,” Mukupa said.\n\nHe commended sponsors who facilitated the trip.\n\n“I thank the government through the Ministry of Sport for the support rendered to us. I also thank Matero Member of Parliament Miles Sampa and Kabwata member of Parliament Given Lubinda for their continued support towards the development of the sport,” Mukupa said.\n\n1. You Can Not Chase Money And Women At The Same Time – Even when so many fathers have made this mistake in their youthful days they still end up failing to tell their sons that one can not hunt for money and women at the same time. It is either one makes money and then start chasing women or the other way round.\n\n2. A Man Gets More Respect Based On His Pocket – This point is not trying to encourage crime or ungodly acts in other to make wealth but to face reality. It is a known fact that both within the home front and the society at large, a man is respected the more according to how comfortable and financially free he becomes.\n\n3. Women Can Make Or Ruin You – So many fathers even when they know the truth of the power of any woman, still shy away from enlightening their sons on the critical hidden powers a woman possesses. From the days of Adam, Samson, Solomon, Abacha and other notable men, we have seen how a man can either rise or fall through the power and influence of a woman. A man should therefore thread as softly as possible when dealing with a woman.\n\n4. A Woman Can Smell A Successful Man From Miles Away – Women naturally have an hidden instinct of knowing a man who is successful or have the tendency of being successful in the future. So many women have stuck to a struggling and upcoming man against their parents wish of marrying an already made man. A woman will say things like “he has a bright future”, “he has potentials” or “he will be a great man in future”. Ladies who have uttered such words and stuck by their men have never gone wrong. Example is how Michelle Obama stuck with Barack through thick and thin.\n\n5. A Woman Doesn’t Like A Weak Man – When fathers tell their sons never to give in to a woman’s pressure, they mostly advise their sons to be forceful on issues to prove he is the man of the house. When in reality, women prefer men who say less and do more, rather than the ones who keep talking but do less. The latter is the typical meaning of a weak man but fathers always advice to do such to prove he is the king of the house.\n\n6. Women Appreciate Men With Fatherly Characters – Most men always miss out on this and as such never advise their sons to be a father figure to their wives. Women are best at doing this but every woman wants a man who sits her down to advice her, reason with her, give her constructive criticisms and above all, believe in her.\n\n7. It Is Easier To Catch A Cheating Man Than Catch A Cheating Woman – Most men till date don’t know that it is far easier to get caught cheating as a man than catching a woman who cheats. A woman can make a man ‘father’ every single child she has but only her knows who the biological father is, while a man can hardly keep it as a secret from his wife when he has a love child outside the matrimonial home. Agent\n\nPRESS STATEMENT\n\nON MMD MPs UNNECESSARY BY-ELECTIONS CAUSED BY PRESIDENT SATA\n\nSaturday, November 17, 2012\n\nBY REV. JEVAN KAMANGA PROVINCIAL COORDINATOR – COPPERBELT\n\nPLEASE DO NOT KILL THE OPPOSITION\n\nAs NAREP on the Copperbelt, we are taken aback by the many inconstancies being portrayed by both the PF government and the MMD. This gives every reason why people should now start thinking of NAREP as the alternative government to break these behaviors by the so called big parties.\n\nIn 1990, we made a Decisive Decision that this Country would never again be ruled under a One Party state. We introduced plural politics which are very vital to Democracy. The current problems we are facing between PF and the Opposition is a road leading to weakening the Opposition and having a One Party State.\n\nThe appointment of Ministers from among the opposition has for the long time been done in bad faith. The aim has been to weaken the opposition in a bid to have influence in the national assembly. Constitutionally, all MPs are properties of their respective parties.\n\nWe have a very big problem especially when the President calls opposition MPs serving in his government as Deputy Ministers and after that meeting, these MPs start hinting on bye elections. Mr. President, do not kill democracy. In a multi-party dispensation, opposition plays a major role for checks and balances. We don’t think any of our Opposition leaders are any close to what HE Michael C. Sata used to do when he was in opposition. He threw tantrums and fits. We thought he will be different after being in opposition for 10 years.\n\nThe best the ruling party can do in the interest of democracy and co-existence, in the absence of a collision government clause or a government of national unity clause, is to write formally the request or interest in the named MP or MPs or offer the opposition parties some positions in government so that the respective parties can choose among their MPs suitable MPs of their choice to be part of the Cabinet.\n\nTo stop this trend of unnecessary and expensive Bye-Elections, we propose that every MP who causes a Bye-Election be barred from contesting in the Bye-Election.\n\nWe want to strongly appeal to HE President Sata to help maintain the opposition as it is vital for a Multi Party Dispensation. If Mr Sata continues with his plan of weakening the opposition, he will go down the history lane as an enemy to democracy. This country is already strained on the economy and By-elections is a shear waste of the much needed resources.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the full moon does not increase the incidence of psychological problems, researchers have revealed.\n\nA team of researchers directed by Professor Genevieve Belleville of Universite Laval’s School of Psychology examined the relationship between the moon’s phases and the number of patients who show up at hospital emergency rooms experiencing psychological problems.\n\nTo determine whether the widespread belief linking the moon to mental health problems was true, researchers evaluated patients who visited emergency rooms at Montreal’s Sacre-Coeur Hospital and Hotel-Dieu de Levis between March 2005 and April 2008.\n\nThey focused specifically on 771 individuals who showed up at the emergency room with chest pains for which no medical cause could be determined.\n\nPsychological evaluations revealed that a sizeable number of these patients suffered from panic attacks, anxiety and mood disorders, or suicidal thoughts.\n\nUsing lunar calendars, the researchers determined the moon phase in which each of these visits occurred.\n\nThe results of their analyses revealed no link between the incidence of psychological problems and the four lunar phases.\n\nThere was one exception, however; anxiety disorders were 32 per cent less frequent during the last lunar quarter.\n\n“This may be coincidental or due to factors we did not take into account,” Belleville said.\n\n“But one thing is certain: we observed no full-moon or new-moon effect on psychological problems,” she said.\n\nThe study’s conclusions run contrary to what many believe, including 80 per cent of nurses and 64 per cent of doctors who are convinced that the lunar cycle affects patients’ mental health.\n\n“We hope our results will encourage health professionals to put that idea to rest,” Belleville said.\n\n“Otherwise, this misperception could, on the one hand, color their judgment during the full moon phase; or, on the other hand, make them less attentive to psychological problems that surface during the remainder of the month,” she added.\n\nThe study is published on the website of the scientific journal General Hospital Psychiatry.\n\nChingola district on the Copperbelt has run out of meallie meal and residents are physically fighting to buy a bag of the staple food.\n\nBy late afternoon on Tuesday, only a National Milling shop had a few bags but they quickly ran out as residents literally fought to get into the shop to buy.\n\nAll the other outlets like Shoprite checkers have no meal meallie forcing residents to wander and from in search of the commodity.\n\nThe shortage of mealie meal, Zambia’s staple food, has hit the Copperbelt Province prompting the price of the commodity to rise in 48 hours.\n\nFor the first time since the last eight years of Dr Kenneth Kaunda’s rule between 1983 and 1991, Zambians are queuing for the commodity which before September 2011 was fetching for at most K40, 000 per 25 kg breakfast meal but is now pegged at over K80, 000 in areas like Chingola.\n\nMinister of agriculture Emmanuel Chenda has issued a statement accusing millers of hoarding alleging the shortage is artificial. People are back to the UNIP days by forming queues to purchase the commodity at few places where it is available.\n\nThe consumers are waking up at dawn to scout for mealie meal around the city. The milling companies on the Copperbelt are experiencing an acute shortage of the commodity forcing some to close while that are open but have no stock to sale.\n\nThis situation has created anger among Coperbelt residents who are wondering where government is taking the huge tonnages of maize that were harvested in this agriculture farming season.\n\nConsumers are wondering why there is a shortage of mealie meal even as the Food Reserve Agency announced that they bought a lot of maize in the current farming season.\n\nSome millers like Jamos Milling company have even closed their operation due to lack of stock.\n\nSome angered residents said on television; “they show us that FRA has bought tonnes of maize but where is it going? We have also heard that Zambia has produced a lot of maize and some of it from last season is even rotting, so why is there a shortage of mealie meal?”\n\nThe PF government is failing to manage the agriculture sector leading to failure to deliver input for the 2012/13 farming season on time and payment of farmers.\n\nZambia Reports\n\nDear Editor,\n\nI am a concerned parent with 2 kids at the so called Eagle School of Excellence in Nakonde. My concern is that teachers at this school work from 6hrs-16hr without getting their salaries. Some teachers called it quit last term because of this poor management. To make matters worse, the teachers are voiceless because whoever speaks out is instantly fired. Among the private schools in Nakonde, Eagle has the highest enrolment of over 450 pupils from G1-7 who pay school fees in full on the opening day.\n\nIt is owned by Allan Kaoma whose phone no. is 097******. A teacher talked to said even the salary is too little as compared to the number of pupils at school. He said he can only work hard and willingly if he was receiving what he deserves in time.\n\nThis has also affected learners despite them being innocent since they pay money in time. When our children went to Lusaka for educational tour, he demanded to keep their pocket money but where not given their money. Our children complained bitterl y that they were given sugar solution (zigolo).\n\nTherefore we appeal to people in authority to investigate this matter and help teachers who will then deliver effectively to our children. Ever since they opened schools, these teachers only got paid once and they are about to close. The minister Maloza Sichone and the Labour minister Shamenda Fuckson should come in and help please!!\n\nConcerned Nakonde resident & Parent\n\nDear Editor,\n\nI am a concerned worker at Zambia Railways Kitwe who is worried about the rate at which the Railway line is being damaged. Just here at the station (Kitwe) Jerabohs are busy digging (mining) the railway yard for mine material.\n\nThe user department says they are cleaning (screening) the traffic yard but they are not dumping the refuse they sell it for it contains Copper Concentrate ore. This is done in broad daylight in full view of the Security.\n\nIf you think it may make for good NEWS please visit the Railway station so as to inform the Nation better. The President ushered in a new CEO and if the line will be vandallised like this, he will be faced with a harder task than he invisioned cause the line is literally being moved.\n\nWhen approached by Zambia Police Officers, the Jerabohs openly answered that money had changed hands and all they have come to do is pick their product. So the State Police say they can not halt the ‘illegal’ mining but it is the state in which the line is being left.\n\nConcerned Worker"
