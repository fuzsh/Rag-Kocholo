        "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, be aware. Disclaimer, the seven-part limited series for Apple from Alfonso Cuarón, now has a teaser trailer (below).\n\nThe psychological thriller created and directed by the Oscar-winning filmmaker (Roma, Gravity) stars fellow Oscar winners Cate Blanchett and Kevin Kline, and is based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Renée Knight.\n\nTold in seven chapters, the Apple Studios series releases Oct. 11 with the first two episodes, followed by new episodes every Friday. The series marks Cuarón’s first show under his overall deal with the streamer.\n\nThe logline reads: “Acclaimed journalist Catherine Ravenscroft (Blanchett) built her reputation revealing the misdeeds and transgressions of others. When she receives a novel from an unknown author, she is horrified to realize she is now the main character in a story that exposes her darkest secrets. As Catherine races to uncover the writer’s true identity, she is forced to confront her past before it destroys both her own life and her relationships with her husband Robert (Sacha Baron Cohen) and their son Nicholas (Kodi Smit-McPhee).”\n\nThe ensemble cast also includes Lesley Manville, Louis Partridge, Leila George, Hoyeon and Indira Varma as the narrator.\n\nDisclaimer is co-produced by Esperanto Filmoj and Anonymous Content. Cuarón executive produces for Esperanto Filmoj alongside Gabriela Rodriguez. Blanchett executive produces, along with Emmanuel Lubezki, Donald Sabourin and Carlos Morales; David Levine and the late Steve Golin executive produce for Anonymous Content.\n\nKnight is co-executive producer. Lubezki and Bruno Delbonnel are directors of photography. The score is composed by Finneas O’Connell."
