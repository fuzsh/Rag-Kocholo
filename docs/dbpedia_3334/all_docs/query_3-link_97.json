My greatest debts are to the Patrizi Naro Montoro family, especially Marchese Don Corso and Donna Elisabetta. Without Don Corso’s extraordinary kindness and enthusiasm for this project, and without his willingness to share with me materials he has discovered in Palazzo Patrizi and in the family archives, much of this study would not have been possible. I am also enormously indebted to Marchese Don Innocenzo Patrizi Naro Montoro and Umberta da Passano at Castel Giuliano, as well as other members of the Patrizi family, including Marchesa Teresa Frescobaldi, Marchese Patrizio and Marchesa Flaminia Patrizi Naro Montoro, the late Donna Paola Patrizi Naro Montoro, Marchesa Donna Maddalena Patrizi Naro Montoro and Don Paolo Patrizi Naro Montoro. Particular thanks are owed to Jacopo and Florence Patrizi, for their interest in this project and their hospitality over many years. In Milan, Francesca Patrizi was generous in providing information and materials. Particular thanks are owed to Marchesa Alberta Serlupi Crescenzi for opening many doors into Rome’s cultural heritage, and to Clare Broadbent for her willingness to make connections and to explore the Campagna. I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Karin Wolfe and Tommaso Manfredi for facilitating this project in so many ways. The late Federico Zeri was for many years generous in sharing his knowlege and supporting my reseach of architectural and view painters. Other friends and colleagues I would like to thank for their help and assistance include Barbara Arciszewska, Piers Baker-Bates, Robert Gaston, Katrina Grant, Christopher M. S. Johns, Alastair Laing, Joan Barclay Lloyd, Frances Muecke, Carol Richardson, Clare Robertson, Sandra Romito, Francis Russell, Marino Serlupi Crescenzi, Mark Shepheard, John Weretka and Arno Witte. Much of the research for this book was done in the Archivio Segreto Vaticano, and I would like to thank the Most Reverend Prefect, His Excellency Monsignor Sergio Pagano, B., the Vice-Prefect, Professor Paolo Cherubini and the Segretario, Dott. Marco Grilli, with particular thanks to Dott. Francesco Lippa for his work on the edition of Cardinal Patrizi’s Letters and the staff of the Sale di Studio, always helpful and efficient. During regular xvi\n\nLibro MARSHALL.indb 16\n\nvisits to Rome over the years I have been privileged to stay at the British School at Rome, where Andrew and Jo Wallace-Hadrill made it feel like home. Valerie Scott and her team in the British School at Rome library were unfailing helpful and generous. I would also like to thank its assistant directors: Clare Hornsby, Andrew Hopkins, Helen Langdon and Susan Russell, as well as Maria Pia Malvezzi and the late Geraldine Wellington. Another fundamental resource for this project has been the Bibliotheca Hertziana in Rome, and colleagues associated with it, especially Elizabeh Kieven, Sebastian Schütze and Christina Strunck, have been especially supportive. Marga Sanchez assisted with photograph permissions. Much of the writing was done during the depth of successive Roman winters in the main reading room of the library of the American Academy in Rome, one of the finest spaces for writing and thinking that I know, and I would like to thank all the librarians there for their help. Also inspirational was my time as Paul Mellon Visiting Senior Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, in November–December 2002, which allowed me to write drafts of early chapters. I owe special thanks to Robin Appleton for her copy-editing, and to Roberto Marcucci and Maurizio Pinto at “L’Erma” di Bretschneider. Financial support for this project has been provided by the School of Culture and Communication at the University of Melbourne, where I owe particular thanks for the supportive environment provided by my colleagues there over the years, especially Dagmar Eichberger, Ann Galbally, Charles Green, Alison Inglis, Susan Lowish, Margaret Manion, Angela Ndalianis and Anthony White. Finally, I would like to thank from the heart Lisa Beaven, who encouraged me to take research in Roman family archives seriously, and who has always been my strongest supporter.\n\nDavid R.

It consisted of a residential building, the Casino, a grand staircase, various subsidiary structures, gardens, and an extensive cultivated vigna. The staircase and associated terraces and buildings were destroyed in the early nineteenth century when the garden was remodelled in the English style and it was subsequently expanded by the acquisition of the neighbouring Villa Bolognetti. The Casino was destroyed in 1849 during the defence of the Roman Republic: the Republicans, who controlled the city, fearing a French attack on the north side of the city destroyed it as a defensive measure. (In the event, the attack came on the other side of the city, on the Janiculum.) This ‘act of vandalism’1 was made easy for the Republicans because the Patrizi were supporters of the papacy, which had invited the French invasion. The Casino was promptly rebuilt to much the same external appearance, but became a victim of the land speculation and development that followed the unification of Italy in 1870 with Rome as its capital. It was demolished at the beginning of the twentieth century, when buildings housing the Ministry of Public Works and the Ministry of Transport were built on the site. The Via Nomentana was broadened into a wide avenue, and housing developments were built on new suburban streets that were once the garden of the villa.2 Romans today know it only as the name of a street, or from the engraving in Giuseppe Vasi’s Delle magnificenze di Roma antica e moderna (1760) (Fig. 1.1).3 I first became aware of the Villa Patrizi when researching the work of the painter of Roman capricci and vedute, Giovanni Paolo Panini (1692–1769). The literature on Panini routinely refers to his work at the villa, and makes passing reference to the documentation in the Archivio Patrizi-Montoro in the Archivio Segreto Vaticano. This archive was explored by Maria Barbara Guerrieri Borsoi in Introduction\n\nLibro MARSHALL.indb 1\n\nan article that focused on the identity of the artists working there.4 On following up her references, I was struck by the extent of this material. There were receipts, lists of payments and accounts associated with the building of the villa, and these seemed to be relatively complete. In addition, there were the death inventories of the various heads of the Patrizi family, which gave comprehensive descriptions of the contents of the villa in 1739, 1747, 1772, and 1814. More unusually, there were two volumes of letters from Cardinal Patrizi, who was Cardinal Legate in Ferrara from 1718 to 1727, to his brothers Mariano and Francesco. These 404 letters, written in a tight hand (when not written by a scribe when the cardinal’s gout prevented him writing them himself ), had been occasionally accessed by scholars interested in Panini, such as Leandro Ozzola, but had never been fully explored. On closer inspection, they proved to be largely about the completion and decoration of the villa (the structure of the Casino was in place when they began), and constituted one half of a weekly discussion with Mariano about the progress of the villa. (A few letters are addressed to another brother, Francesco.) Because they dealt with day-to-day matters, and frequently discussed ideas that did not eventuate, they were, however, not easy to interpret, particularly in view of the total loss of the villa. My edition of the full text of the Letters is being published by the Archivio Segreto Vaticano.5 At the time I knew the villa only from the few views that survive—primarily the engraving by Vasi and sets of paintings by Adrien Manglard and Giovanni Battista Bassi in the Palazzo Patrizi in Rome, and various nineteenthcentury images—and knew of no published plans of the Casino. It seemed, however, that given the information contained within the inventories and the exterior views it ought to be possible to obtain a fairly good idea of the internal arrangement of the villa, and therefore to understand what the discussions in the Letters were all about. I managed to work out what the plan must have 1\n\n18/11/15 17:23\n\nbeen, which was subsequently confirmed by the discovery of the original project plan and elevation drawings by the architect, Sebastiano Cipriani, belonging to the Patrizi family but then unpublished. This encouraged me to go further and to relate the documentary material more closely to this graphic data in order to produce measured drawings of each floor of the Casino as built, including the staircases, taking into account such matters as chimneys, door openings, blind windows and other such factors and the evidence for the form of the pre-existing building on the site, which seems to have been completely demolished to make way for the new structure. It was but a step from here to the task of marrying the data of the four principal inventories to these reconstructed plan and elevations. This is an exercise that is rarely attempted, but can be fruitful, since, where the plans and elevations of rooms are known, there is often only one way the objects described and dimensioned in the inventories can have been situated. I have concentrated here on a few rooms where the evidence is most complete and interesting, such as the Piano Nobile Anterooms. With a greater understanding of what the villa was like, inside as well as outside, I was able to return to the Letters and begin to try to understand what Cardinal Patrizi was discussing with Mariano. It became apparent that Mariano was effectively the supervising architect of the villa, and dealt with the patron (the cardinal), with other interested parties (principally the cardinal’s other brothers Costanzo and Filippo, and his nephew Patrizio), with the professional architect (Sebastiano Cipriani) who, from the time that the Letters commence, did not have a big role to play, and with the various capo mastri, the chief tradesmen and contractors. Most interestingly, Mariano proved to be fully attuned to the latest trends in the decorative arts, as well as being closely associated with contemporary Roman painters. He was an Accademico d’onore of the Accademia di S. Luca, and an amateur painter of some accomplishment. Likewise an amateur artist was his brother Francesco, who took responsibility for the soft furnishings and may have played a role in the planning of the Casino, since in one of his portraits he presents himself as an aristocratic architect. It emerged that the Villa Patrizi was the most important domestic building at an interesting and not well understood moment in the history of Roman architecture and decoration, a moment when it was at its most international and ‘modern’ in outlook. The designers of the villa—the cardinal, Mariano, Franceco, Patrizio and Cipriani—were looking to northern Italy, especially Bologna and Venice, and indirectly in the general direction 2\n\nLibro MARSHALL.indb 2\n\nof Paris, the source of all things modern and fashionable in the second and third decades of the eighteenth century. Their outlook was broadly speaking Arcadian—that is, taking its cue from the reformist values of the poetical and social academy known as the Arcadian Academy, of which Cardinal Patrizi was a member, which sought to temper the excesses of Marinism, the poetical style derived from Giambattista Marino at the beginning of the seventeenth century, which we might call Mannerist or Baroque—by promoting a stylistically moderate pastoralism. The Arcadian mindset, and the mindset of the builders of the villa, was anything but antiquarian, as Roman artistic culture is generally assumed to be, and which it would increasingly become from the the moment that Pope Clement XII took the throne in 1730. It therefore seemed worthwhile to attempt, by a mixture of reconstruction and discussion of comparative examples, to use a study of the Villa Patrizi as a way of more closely approaching an understanding of the nature of this ‘modern’ style that may, for want of a better term, be called barocchetto.6 The core of this book (Part 3) is therefore an attempt to relate the reconstruction of the appearance of the principal interiors of the villa to the thinking behind the decision-making process that led to them, and to contextualise this thinking by relating these interiors to those that survive. With the help of members of the extended Patrizi family, it has been possible to identify some of the furnishings of the villa that, it emerged, had been hurriedly removed before the destruction of the Casino in 1849. What also emerged from the Letters is the concern of the parties involved to provide the whole estate, or vigna, with adequate water, and to develop it as an agricultural estate that complemented the Casino and its ornamental garden. Running in parallel with this was their concern to have the villa present itself as a teatro, or theatre; that is, for it to have a significant urban presence. In part this was a consequence of its builders taking the bold— and as we shall see, dangerous—step of siting the villa outside the Aurelian walls, and so initiate the extra-urban development of this side of Rome. For Cardinal Patrizi the main danger lay in stepping outside the security of the city walls into the disease-ridden Campagna, although in the end the real danger came from its militarily strategic position overlooking the Porta Pia. This would be the cause of its destruction in 1849, and the rebuilt villa’s narrow escape from destruction in 1870, when the army of the Italian state breached the walls in the garden of the Villa Paolina diagonally opposite. Its final destruction was also a consequence of its siting, as it was subsumed by the uncontrolled development of the city, the fate of so many\n\nRediscovering a Baroque Villa in Rome: Cardinal Patrizi and the Villa Patrizi 1715-1909\n\n18/11/15 17:23\n\nvillas and gardens on the periphery of expanding cities. But before this second destruction took place, the villa lived a second life, one focused on the garden. The acquisition of the Villa Bolognetti next door, and the excitement of the new garden style, the so-called giardino all’inglese, allowed the Patrizi to create one of the grandest gardens of this type in Rome, even if it meant the destruction of the Baroque teatro. This story is the subject of Parts 4 and 5. It is in the nature of letters to bring the reader closer to the writer, and to make the reader feel acquainted with his or her personality, and to become aware of the social rules under which the writer operated. It the case of a noble Roman family in the eighteenth century, these social rules were extremely restrictive. Part 1 focuses on individual members of the Patrizi family, from Patrizio the Elder, who purchased the site in 1650, to Maria Virginia and Giovanni (died 1772), and examine the place that the villa played in the lives and ambitions of members of the family. In particular, Part 1 looks at what the Letters tells us about the relationship between the cardinal and those in his social circle insofar as it concerns the villa, and especially his relationship with his nephew Patrizio and his wife Ottavia who feature prominently in the Letters. Like any family history, it is a story of the interaction of social Introduction\n\nLibro MARSHALL.indb 3\n\nFig. 1.1.

Marshall.)\n\nstructures with individual personalities and contingencies. The result of these personalities and contingencies was that for much of the eighteenth century the Villa Patrizi was the territory of the Patrizi women. Two concluding chapters (Part 6) deal with matters not directly connected with the villa but that are discussed at length in the Letters. These are the works undertaken by the cardinal in 1721 and 1722 to create a more dignified entrance to the family’s town palazzo at S. Luigi dei Francesi, as the old one was deemed unsuitable both for a cardinal (Patrizi expected to be taking up residence there when his first term as legate in Ferrara ended in 1721) and for a lady (Ottavia Sacchetti, who married Patrizio in 1722). At the same time (1722–1723) the cardinal was undertaking work at Castel Giuliano building a connecting passageway and new upper floors. Later, in anticipation of the cardinal’s return at the end of his second term in 1724 (which did not eventuate) and especially at the end of his third term in 1727, there were extended discussions about reorganising the Piano Nobile to accommodate the cardinal. 3\n\n18/11/15 17:23\n\nRoman Villas and the Villa Patrizi The Villa Patrizi formed part of a long succession of Roman villas. As Ackerman has observed, ‘the villa is typically the product of an architect’s imagination and asserts its modernity’.7 During the Renaissance, well aware of the precedent of Roman villas, especially Pliny’s descriptions of his villas at Laurentum and in Tuscany, various villas were built around Rome.8 These were ville suburbane, in other words, on the edge of town. Chief among these were the Villa Farnesina, built for the banker Agostino Chigi by Baldassare Peruzzi in 1505/8–11 on the banks of the Tiber between Trastevere and the Vatican, and the Villa Madama, built by Cardinal Giulio de’ Medici (later Pope Clement VII, reigned 1523–34 ) when he was a cardinal to designs by Raphael on Monte Mario in 1519–27.9 Other important villas for cardinals and popes followed, including the Villa d’Este on the Quirinal, occupied by Cardinal Ippolito d’Este from 1550, which would be developed into the papal palace, the Villa Giulia for Julius III (reigned 1550–55) from 1551, the Villa Medici for Cardinal Ferdinando de’ Medici from 1564, the Villa Montalto of Pope Sixtus V (reigned 1585–90) from 1585. Frascati in the Alban hills was also popular for grand villas because of its high, and hence healthy, situation although these were too far away for a daytrip. The most impressive of these were the Villa Aldodrandini and the Villa Mondragone of the Borghese. The grandest of the suburban villas near Rome would be built by Cardinal Scipione Borghese, nephew of Paul V (reigned 1605–21), from 1605, the vast estates of which form much of the modern park. The Villa Borghese continued the tradition of the Villa Farnesina, being lavishly decorated and not really designed to being lived in, being so close to the city. The Borghese established a model of property ownership that was aspired to but could not always be emulated by subsequent papal families: a town palace in the heart of Rome; a suburban villa and another at Frascati, as well as numerous other rural properties. During the short reign of Gregory XIV Ludovisi (1621–23) the Ludovisi rapidly created an extensive villa inside the walls, the Villa Ludovisi, the gardens and buildings of which were richly furnished with antiquities in quantities that would not be seen again. The family of Urban VIII Barberini (reigned 1623–44) built a town palace on a site near the Quirinal hitherto considered more appropriate to a suburban villa. They also had a villa at Castel Gandolfo in the Alban Hills, but although they had many other rural properties they poured their resources into a town palace. The Pamphilj (Pope Innocent X, reigned 1644–55) matched the Bor4\n\nLibro MARSHALL.indb 4\n\nghese in ambition and developed a vast villa estate, the modern Villa Doria-Pamphilj, on the Janiculum on the other side of the city, with a main building by Algardi that was more artful and less traditional than the Villa Borghese, although smaller and less lavishly furnished. The family of Alexander VII Chigi (reigned 1655–67), which had strong connections with the Patrizi, were more interested in their estates near Siena, including the Villa Cetinale of Cardinal Flavio Chigi (from 1680), and their feudal palace at Ariccia in the Alban Hills. The family of Clement IX Altieri (reigned 1670–76) had focused their attention on their town palace near the Gesù, but also created a relatively modest suburban villa not far from where the Patrizi would build theirs. Subsequent villa building was less ambitious than it had been in the earlier part of the century, as papal nepotism was going out of fashion. Clement X Albani (reigned 1700–21), the pope who created Giovanni Battista Patrizi cardinal in 1715, was likewise reticent about such display, although he did build an important villa at Anzio. His short-lived successor Innocent XIII had a family villa at Poli, while Benedict XIII was uninterested in villa building. In fact, the Villa Patrizi was the only significant Roma villa suburbana of the first three decades of the eighteenth century. In subsequent decades there was more activity: the family of Clement XII Corsini (reigned 1730–40) combined town palace and villa in their palace on the Via della Lungara and its garden leading up to the Casino dei Quattro Venti on the Janiculum. Benedict XIV (reigned 1740–58) was content with a tiny pavilion in the grounds of the papal palace on the Quirinal, the Caffeaus, but his Secretary of State, Cardinal Valenti Gonzaga, built a modest but lavishly furnished villa just inside the walls near the Villa Patrizi (now known as Villa Paolina), while Clement XI’s nephew, Cardinal Alessandro Albani from 1758 built the Villa Albani nor far away on the Via Salaria outside the walls. The Villa Albani was a return to the grand vision of the Borghese and Ludovisi by another great collector, and buildings and garden were (and are) well stocked with art and antiquities. From then until the suburban development of Rome from the 1870s these three villas defined the area on either side of the walls between Porta Pia and Porta Salaria, with the Villa Patrizi and Villa Albani facing each other across the fields. The Villa Patrizi was unlike most Roman ville suburbane in that its purpose was always strongly residential. The Patrizi were not great collectors, and their villa reflected not the power, ambition, wealth and extravagance of a papal family, but the structure of a typical aristocratic family of the period. They had prospered under Cardinal\n\nRediscovering a Baroque Villa in Rome: Cardinal Patrizi and the Villa Patrizi 1715-1909\n\n18/11/15 17:23\n\nPatrizi’s father, Patrizio Patrizi the Elder (1629–89), who had benefited from the reign of the Sienese pope, Alexander VII. They had feudal estates at Castel Giuliano and Sasso, the source of their titles, but their town palace was relatively small and in a densely settled part of town, and there was neither the opportunity nor the funds to expand. This situation was aggravated by the creation of Giovanni Battista as cardinal, since cardinals needed an extensive entourage. There was nowhere to put them, and many of the Letters of Cardinal Patrizi address this issue (his solution was to rent space next door in the Palazzo de’ Spagnuoli or in a property owned by the Borghese at the back). By developing the villa, Cardinal Patrizi could provide additional, albeit duplicated, accommodation for his family, at a site not very far away, with space for gardens, carriages, and productive agriculture, as well as rooms well suited for balls and social gatherings such as conversazioni. The Ground Floor rooms were essentially a series of apartments for the cardinal’s brothers to use in summer, with a large Gallery connecting them and providing a common space, accessible from terrace and garden. The cardinal had his bedroom on the Piano Nobile, but the Mezzanine was always intended to have a strong female presence, and as matters unfolded women would become the primary occupants of the villa. The representational rooms on the Piano Nobile were designed as social spaces around a central Gallery, which was less a place for displaying pictures than an impressive space for receptions and balls, an economical version of the Galleria Colonna. Opening off this were rooms with state-of-theart decoration, intended for the more intimate kind of social activity, such as playing cards. In this way the villa Patrizi did indeed ‘assert its modernity’, and the efforts of the cardinal and his brothers to create a modern villa is the subject of the chapters that follow.\n\nIntroduction\n\nLibro MARSHALL.indb 5\n\nNotes 1. Robello, 1854, vol. 2, p. 315. 2. Throughout the text I have capitalised terms that are employed as proper names of the whole or parts of the estate under discussion. Hence the components of the Villa Patrizi include the ‘Casino’, ‘Boschetto’, ‘Giardino’, ‘Piano Nobile’, ‘Stanza delli Cristalli’, ‘Piano Nobile Gallery’ and so forth. These names are based partly on descriptions used in the documents (for example, ‘Stanza delli Cristalli’) and partly as straightforward English descriptions (for example ‘Ground Floor Gallery’). 3.

The use of this term, like period-style terms generally, often meets with disapproval from art historians because of its elasticity and absence of an agreed definition, concurrent with the enthusiastic embrace of comparable terms, such as ‘Baroque’, by cultural critics for precisely the same reasons. In my opinion barocchetto is a useful stylistic category to distinguish the art and architecture of much of Italy, and especially Rome, in the period 1700 to 1730 from that of the half-centuries on either side. It is no longer ‘Baroque’, although derived from that movement, and does not yet embrace the antiquarianism of Neoclassicism. In architecture it is almost synonymous with borrominismo (that is, descent from, or rediscovery of, the style of Borromini as opposed to Bernini). Insofar as it is a light and playful style it has affinities with the French Rococo, but the vocabulary of forms derives from the Roman Baroque, rather than France. It would be unproductive to pursue the process of definition further since the usefulness of such a term lies in its inclusiveness, rather than the strictness of its definition. It is a term that can usefully be employed to help us to conceptualise a corpus of visual data issuing from a loosely defined period. 7. Ackerman, 1990, p. 9. 8.

Originally from Siena, their fortunes had fluctuated, but they had recently been restored by Patrizio Patrizi the elder (1629–89), the father of Giovanni Battista, the builder of the villa.1 Patrizio had prospered under Pope Alexander VII, a fellow Sienese.2 He had accompanied the cardinal nephew, Cardinal Flavio Chigi on his embassy to Paris in 1664.3 Alexander had enabled him to acquire the titles of Marquis of Castel Giuliano and Sasso in 1655, following his repurchase of these estates located west of Lake Bracciano (they had been Marquises of Paganico in southern Tuscany since 1630).4 The Patrizi became one of the five marchesi del baldacchino, which entitled them, like princes, to display their baldacchino on state occasions and in their family palazzi. In addition, Patrizio married well: his wife was Virginia Corsini, a member of a powerful Florentine family that would produce a pope in the next century, Clement XII. By the end of the century the Patrizi, if not so rich as some of the papal families or the old baronial families, were doing very well. Although their assets were only half those of the Ruspoli, a family on the rise, they were double those of the Sacchetti, likewise marchesi from Tuscany and later to be linked by marriage to the Patrizi.5\n\nThe Dispositions of Patrizio’s Will Patrizio had ten children, nine of whom survived into adulthood: five sons, including the future cardinal, and four daughters. The dispositions of his will are highly revealing of the social structure of this most representative of artistocratic Roman families of the late Seicento, and of the way they viewed their physical and financial assets.6 The will was drawn up in 1688 when the youngest son, 8\n\nLibro MARSHALL.indb 8\n\nFrancesco, was 23. The family income was to be divided into six parts, the oldest son Costanzo receiving two and each of the other four sons receiving one part each. Should not all of the sons be alive at Patrizio’s death, the proportions were to be adjusted, with the eldest still receiving a double portion. But if one of his sons were to die after inheriting, his share would not pass to his children, nor would it be redistributed among the surviving brothers, but would return to the main line.7 Since the whole income of the family was about 15,000 scudi per annum it would have meant 5000 scudi for Costanzo and 2500 scudi for the other brothers.8 But the evidence points to the second son, the-then Monsignor Giovanni Battista, having inherited most of the liquid component of the family’s wealth, while the bulk of the assets were tied up in property subject to entail, and held in common. Most of these liquid assets were in the form of venal offices that Patrizio had been industrious in acquiring.9 Such offices, especially those without any duties attached, were a form of investment. The Patrizi had an exceptionally high amount of capital tied up in such investments. In 1703, thirteen such offices were valued at 107,279 scudi, but a large part of this was taken up by Cardinal Patrizi’s office of chierico di camera (64,420.47 scudi).10 This post was a stepping stone to the cardinalate, and was an important position in the Curia, the administrative heart of the papacy.11 If the incumbent were made cardinal, the office had to be resigned to the Apostolic Camera (camera apostolica) without remuneration. The Apostolic Camera would then sell it to another. If the office were sold by the incumbent it might render him ineligible to be appointed cardinal. It was, in effect, one of the costs of becoming cardinal.12 It would seem that Patrizio in drawing up his will did not anticipate this eventuality, but instead anticipated that Giovanni Battista might voluntarily resign or sell the post in order to purchase a better one, such as tesoriere generale (the treasurer of the papacy) the post held in the\n\nRediscovering a Baroque Villa in Rome: Cardinal Patrizi and the Villa Patrizi 1715-1909\n\n18/11/15 17:23\n\nearly seventeenth century by Costanzo Patrizi the Elder (1589–1623), or auditore della camera.13 Since Patrizio had purchased the post for Giovanni Battista from his own money, it formed part of his personal estate, and hence he could make dispositions about it in his will as he saw fit. He insisted that in no circumstances can Giovanni Battista be compelled to resign the post against his will. He went so far to state that if any of the other brothers attempted to do this, they would lose their portion, which would be reassigned to Giovanni Battista. This implies that the possibility that it might happen was real.14 If Giovanni Battista were to resign the office through appointment as tesoriere generale or auditore della camera, the other brothers then had to invest in the purchase of the new post that, presumably, would cost more than the chierico di camera he would be giving up. In the end Giovanni Battista did, in 1707, become tesoriere generale, just like the older Costanzo, as had evidently been intended all along.15 Patrizio specified that Giovanni Battista was to inherit, probably from his free effects, the sum of 100,000 scudi that would be raised from such readily available resources such as cash, luoghi di monte, and vacabili. More than anything this indicates the extent to which Giovanni Battista’s eccelestiastical career was planned by his father. Combined with the post of chierico di camera, he would have 16 per cent of the net assets of the family. Since much of the rest would have been tied up in property, Giovanni Battista had considerable freedom to manoeuvre in promoting his family (di suo decoroso profitto, e splendore della Casa, as Patrizio’s will puts it); more so than his older brother. This is borne out by the fact that the building activities in Giovanni Battista’s generation were directed, and largely paid for, by Giovanni Battista, not his older brother Costanzo, whereas in the previous generation such activities were centred on Patrizio, the head of the family. In short, in papal Rome, the cardinal, or potential cardinal, in the family, mattered more, and had more resources, than its head.\n\nPatrizio’s Will and the Palazzo at S. Luigi dei Francesi The principal property of the Patrizi family in the city of Rome was the palazzo facing the church of S. Luigi dei Francesi that they had acquired from the Aldobrandini in 1642.16 The next most important property was Castel Giuliano, in Lazio near Lake Bracciano. We learn much about the domestic arrangements within the city palace Part 1. The Cardinal and his Family\n\nLibro MARSHALL.indb 9\n\nfrom the dispositions in Patrizio’s will on how it was to be occupied.17 The daughters do not figure, since they were provided with dowries and either married or were established in convents. Patrizio’s youngest daughter appears to have died young, and two others became nuns, but two were married with generous dowries. For the younger, Olimpia (mia dilettissima figlia), he provided 16,000 scudi as a dowry.18 To the older, Cunegonda (altra mia amatissima figlia), he left 15,000 scudi that, however, was not as dowry (evidently she was already married to Benedetto d’Aste; she was 33 in 1688), but simply a legacy.19 Since these daughters lived elsewhere they did not affect the family’s domestic arrangements. More problematic were the entitlements of a widow. A husband naturally wanted to ensure that his widow was looked after following his death, but from that point onwards she was surplus to dynastic requirements, having played her part by producing children (and even more redundant if she had not done so), and her husband’s apartment, and the one that she had occupied during her married life, would normally pass to the next generation. Patrizio’s will made elaborate arrangements for his widow, Virginia Corsini, mia dilettissima consorte, designed to maintain her as far as possible in the style to which she was accustomed. She was left a property measuring about 9.5 rubbie (about 15 hectares) at Castel Giuliano, sopra il luogo detto volgarmento le Prataccie in faccia alla Croce, which she had developed by planting crops and trees. She was also left any other property, and its fruits, that she might have subsequently have acquired. That such ownership was in danger of going unrecognised, given that Castel Giuliano was subject to the primogeniture, was implied by the stipulation that none of the other heirs were to try to challenge this. In addition, Patrizio left her an annual income of 1500 scudi during her lifetime to be paid by his heirs in three payments every four months, in advance. In order to receive this she was not to claim restitution of her dowry or the income from it. That income contributed to the sum of 1500 scudi, but this sum was probably considerably more than the dowry alone would have generated, since it was equivalent to 4 per cent of a capital sum of 60,000 scudi, whereas her dowry was presumably more of the order of 15,000 scudi. If she did claim her dowry—that is, by remarrying—she would have lost all of this, apart from the 9.5 rubbie of land at Castel Giuliano. Her domestic arrangements as specified in the will were such as to minimise disruptions to her lifestyle, even though these would have presented difficulties for Patrizio and Virginia’s eldest son or grandson. Effectively, she 9\n\n18/11/15 17:23\n\nwould retain the apartment that she currently occupied, spelt out in precise detail. All of the rooms on the third floor from below the library on the fourth floor, from the Gallery to a room opening off the spiral staircase (lumaca) that has one window on the courtyard and two on the street, the passage and rooms opposite, four rooms on the Mezzanine occupied by her attendant women, and the colombaia (loft) above. Should she not be living at Patrizio’s death, or should she die subsequently, her eldest son Costanzo could, as he saw fit, leave the rooms on the third floor assigned to him in the will, and take those that Virginia had occupied, the rooms that he had given up being made available to the next oldest son. In addition she was to have three horses of her choosing, stabling for them, a carriage house with the black carriage she currently used as well as a widow’s carriage to be provided for her by her brothers, and a room above the stables for her huntsman (bracciere). She would also have linen, the jewels she currently possessed, and any furniture in these rooms not belonging to the primogeniture. The extent to which Patrizio could dictate the last point was clearly a grey area since he stipulated that if his heirs did not allow her to use this furniture, they had to provide something appropriate to her status, as decided by his executors, of whom Virginia was to be the padrona, and hence would have had a voice. Should she choose to live elsewhere, she was to have in addition to the 1500 scudi an additional 200 scudi per annum, as well as suitable furniture. The rest of the arrangements in the elder Patrizio’s will for the occupancy of the palazzo at S. Luigi dei Francesi reveal the delicate balance that needed to be established between Costanzo and Giovanni Battista. Patrizio acknowledged that it was not possible to make it equally comfortable for all, or to divide it equally. The ground floor, basements, stables, kitchens and cellars were to be held in common. Giovanni Battista, although not yet a cardinal, was to occupy all the rooms on the Piano Nobile from the salone grande (that is, the Camerone, room PN01 in Fig. 6.24; see Chapter 6.1) to the Chapel (PN09). The other rooms in this apartment were for the use of Costanzo. Shared space was the sala (that is, the Sala dei Palafrenieri, room PN11), the room next to the sala, and the room next to the Chapel, because these rooms divided the two apartments. On the second floor, what was not occupied by Virginia was for Costanzo’s use, and the next oldest son—Filippo, if still alive—could take Costanzo’s own rooms. On the third floor a large room facing the courtyard, previously occupied by Costanzo’s children and evidently a nursery (the younger Patrizio was four when the will was drawn up, his eldest sister seven 10\n\nLibro MARSHALL.indb 10\n\nand his youngest two), together with those on the Palazzo Giustiniani side, are for Giovanni Battista’s use, as are the library and associated rooms, and those rooms that were ‘formerly the old guardarobba’ that were then occupied by Giovanni Battista’s famiglia. Possibly these last are the rooms at the back. The remaining rooms on the third floor were for the use of one of the other sons, with the older of them having the right to choose. Various arrangements were indicated for the other brothers. Hence Patrizio’s expectation in 1688 was that, at his death, the palazzo at S. Luigi dei Francesi would be occupied by his widow, Virginia, and her attendants; Costanzo and his wife (who did not have, nor was expected to have, an apartment separate from her husband’s); Giovanni Battista and his famiglia; and the younger sons Filippo, Mariano, and Francesco. Given the numbers, it is hardly surprising that Patrizio was building upwards, adding a fourth floor at some time after his marriage to Virginia Corsini in 1649 since its cornice includes the Corsini arms.20 (Cardinal Patrizi in 1722 refers to extensive work by his father on the palazzo.) It seems not to be shown in Falda’s map of 1676 but is present in Specchi’s engraving of 1699.21 Immediately after inheriting in 1689 Costanzo set about developing the attic, or fifth, storey to the palazzo, which was underway in 1690–91. Part at least of this attic storey must have been built by Patrizio, since his will, in the passage summarised above, refers to a guardarobba and a loggia, which must have been on this level since the building works in 1690–91 involved creating rooms for Mariano and Francesco, including a painting studio for both brothers, and redoing the stuccoes in an open loggia.22 It was at this time that carriage houses and rooms backing onto the Palazzo Patrizi were rented from the Borghese (see Chapter 6.1).23 Significantly, the rental agreement was signed jointly by Costanzo and Giovanni Battista. That the balance of power between oldest son and son in the Church implied by these arrangements was weighted in the churchman’s favour is evident from the fact that the commission for the ceiling of the Camerone (now Salone da Ballo, room PN02 in Fig. 6.24) in the Palazzo Patrizi came from Giovanni Battista rather than Costanzo, and involved his favourite brothers, Mariano and Francesco.24 It seems that Giovanni Battista was actively engaged in refurbishing the Camerone and associated rooms in 1712 until August 1715, just before being appointed cardinal.25 At least some of this work may have been done in order to ready the palazzo for the wife of the grandson of Patrizio, Angela Carpegna, and so anticipates the work on the palazzo made in preparation for the arrival of the younger Patrizio’s second wife,\n\nRediscovering a Baroque Villa in Rome: Cardinal Patrizi and the Villa Patrizi 1715-1909\n\n18/11/15 17:23\n\nOttavia Sacchetti, discussed below. The marriage contract with Angela Carpegna had been drawn up in July 1715, with a codicil in January 1716: this, too, was signed by Giovanni Battista, rather than Costanzo.26\n\nFedecommesso and Primogenitura Patrizio, like other heads of noble Roman families, was preoccupied with maintaining the family wealth through entails (fedecommessi) and primogeniture (primogenitura). Primogeniture was a more specialised type of entail than the fedecommesso, and was highly restrictive.27 The bulk of the family’s assets were assigned to the oldest son, or to a nominated heir who was to continue the family line. Younger sons were left only relatively small portions, normally income, rather than assets, so that they had neither the income to marry and to create a household appropriate to their station, nor any assets to pass on to their heirs.28 The Patrizi fedecommessi and primogeniture dated from early in the seventeenth century. In proposing an inscription commemorating his renovations to the Palazzo Patrizi in 1722, discussed below, Cardinal Patrizi refers to the fedecommesso established by Francesco Patrizi, and to the primogenitura established by Costanzo Patrizi.29 Other documents refer to the primogenitura of Mariano Patrizi, and the fedecommesso of Giovanni.30 The emphasis on primogeniture went hand in hand with the restriction of marriage to the oldest son, even though the family might be large. Patrizio’s father Giovanni had had seven children, all but one sons, but only two married.31 Patrizio the Elder had ten children by his wife, Virginia Corsini. These were born every two years or so (Cardinal Patrizi would later associate this fecundity with Virgini’a hearty appetite),32 but only the oldest son, Costanzo, would marry.33 In the next generation fecundity diminished: Costanzo had three daughters and one son, the younger Patrizio. This restriction of the family wealth to a single line was designed to consolidate the family assets. It reflects the static, long-term mindset of the Roman nobility, for whom it was more important to preserve than to increase. With the Patrizi, the disadvantages of such an emphasis on primogeniture would soon become apparent. When neither of the marriages of the younger Patrizio produced a male heir there was no secondary line to fall back on. The family line was continued by the device of arrogation, by means of which Giovanni Chigi Montoro took the Patrizi name and titles as Marchese Giovanni Patrizi Chigi Montoro and married Patrizio’s daughter, Maria Virginia, Part 1. The Cardinal and his Family\n\nLibro MARSHALL.indb 11\n\n(see Chapter 1.5).34 The same thing occurred in the next generation, when Maria Virginia’s sons died young, leaving only a daughter, Porzia. She married Francesco Naro, who likewise took the Patrizi name as Marchese Francesco Patrizi Naro. There was family precedent for this, as Cardinal Patrizi observed in 1726, confronted with the childlessness of the younger Patrizio and Ottavia Sacchetti, referring to Soldrerio, who had been adopted.35 Patrizio, like others of his generation, intensified the practice of tying more and more assets to the primogeniture, as is revealed by his will. The territory of Castel Giuliano had been sold by Soldrerio Patrizi (d. 1614) before the establishment of the fedecommesso for 87,000 scudi, and Patrizio the elder had reacquired it in 1660. The money from Soldrerio’s sale came to Patrizio, he stated, from the fedecommesso of his father, Giovanni, but this must have been considered to have been alienated, since Patrizio specifies precisely how that 87,000 scudi would be returned to the ties of the primogeniture. This amounted to 1206 scudi in luoghi di monti, 30,000 scudi spent on the palazzo at S. Luigi dei Francesi, including renovations done and yet to be done, 8000 scudi for 93 rubbie (about 148 hectares) of land bought from the Duke of Bracciano, and the balance of 47,794 scudi considered to be the third part of the value of Castel Giuliano.36 The full extent of the entail arrangements established by Patrizio the elder was spelt out in his death inventory in 1689.37 Those items that were placed under the fedecommesso of his father, Giovanni, were the property at Sasso, the palazzo opposite S. Luigi dei Francesi, and the third part of Castel Giuliano just discussed (given as 47,353 scudi 32 baiocchi), the tenute of Panzanata and Otriano, and various luoghi di monte. Patrizio states explicitly his reason for doing this: so that his heirs could not fight over the estate. Entailed under the primogeniture of Costanzo and Mariano were the paintings and works of art. Patrizio’s free effects to be placed under primogeniture were the palazzo at S. Caterina dei Funari (Palazzo PatriziClementi), the castello of Paganico, the villa of Personata, and a house at Grosseto, the last three of which were bought by Patrizio. Patrizio’s free effects that were to be placed under the fedecommesso included the rest of Castel Giuliano, 30,000 scudi worth of improvements that he had made at Sasso, and palazzi in Siena. This left as free effects not to be placed under primogeniture various rural properties, a house in Rome on the way to S. Maria Maggiore, numerous items of livestock and crops, and, most importantly for Cardinal Patrizi, the vigna at Porta Pia.38 Since the cardinal’s new villa was to be built on a property that had not been incorporated 11\n\n18/11/15 17:23\n\ninto the primogeniture, it gave him freedom of action, which extended to the demolition of an older building on the site. By contrast, the property at Castel Giuliano, from which derived one of the family titles and was now subject to the primogenitura, formed an integral part of the dignity and status of the family.39 The cardinal’s new villa, nevertheless, still served a family function. The will of Patrizio Patrizi makes as universal heir (sole residuary legatee) all five of his brothers, Costanzo, Giovanni Battista, Filippo, Mariano and Francesco. Since the vigna at Porta Pia did not form part of the fedecommesso, it would have been owned in common by the five brothers, each of whom had an ‘apartment’ there, discussed below. Giovanni Battista’s later construction of a new villa was therefore by definition a joint affair, even if it were the cardinal’s initiative. This is confirmed by the fact that the papal brief that gave the right to celebrate mass in the chapel of the villa was addressed to Costanzo.\n\nNotes 1. There are no portraits of Patrizio the elder in Pedrocchi, 2000. 2. Patrizio the elder was among those who welcomed the arrival in Rome of Queen Christina of Sweden in 1655. See Minozzi, 2000, p. 31. According to Moroni Alexander VII appointed Patrizio to the post of generale delle poste of the Papal States: Moroni, 1852, s.v. ‘poste pontificie’, pp. 297–315, see p. 306 col. b. On the Patrizi and Chigi see Benocci, 2005, pp. 21–23 (essay by Irene Fosi). Patrizio participated in the civil government of Rome as a conservator in 1682; his oldest son Costanzo would likewise be one a decade later in 1692. Pietramellara, 1893–97, p. 218. 3. There are several representations of the event, including: French School (seventeenth century), The Reception of Cardinal Flavio Chigi (1631–93) by Louis XIV (1638-1715) on 29 July 1664. Pen and ink on paper. Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale. For the Gobelins tapestry of the event by Le Brun from the Historire du Roi series, see Meyer, 1980, pp. 69 ff. 4. According to Silvestrelli, 1970, vol. 2, pp. 598–601, Sasso had been owned by the Ospedale di S. Spirito in Sassia and was sold to Giovanni Patrizi, son of Francesco di Costanzo Patrizi (died 1552), in 1552. Giovanni also bought much of Castel Giuliano in purchases of 15 December 1546 (from the heir of Agostino Chigi, the Sienese banker of Julius II and ancestor of Alexander, together with the adjacent tenuta of Sambuco) and on 17 July 1547, with a further eighth part by his sons before 1568. Castel Giuliano and Sambuco were sold by Soldrerio Patrizi (died 1614) on 17 March 1609 to the Abbey of S. Paolo for 87,000 scudi. They were reacquired by Patrizio the elder on 27 October 1660, and thereafter remained the single estate of Castel Giuliano. Sasso was not sold. The title of marchese di Castel Giuliano and Sasso was created for Giovanni Patrizi and his successors in 1655. Given this chronology, Giovanni must have already intended in 1655 to reacquire Castel Giuliano, presumably with the backing of Alexander. The Chigi were invested with the Marchesate di Paganico on 5 May 1630 (ASV, Archivio Patrizi-Montori, B83 fols 5-26). 5. In 1685 the Patrizi annual income was 14,645.46 scudi; their assets in 1699 were valued at 939,030.86 scudi, and in 1703 at 931,519.04 scudi (Ferraro, 1994, vol. 1, table on 263.) (See also ASV, Archivio Patrizi-Montoro, B13, fols 209r–212v, Stato della Casa Patritij a tutto li 31 Decembre 1703 (Doc. 5.2.)) Using the figure of 4 per cent return on investments cited by Ferraro results in a figure of 40,000 scudi per annum, much higher that the figure for 1685. This may mean either a growth in wealth in the intervening decade, a larger than\n\n12\n\nLibro MARSHALL.indb 12\n\nnormal proportion locked up in non-interest earning assets such as property, or simply incomplete figures, so that the annual income may have been closer to 40,000 scudi, rather than 15,000. Where Ferraro gives both income and capital figures the 4 per cent figure works well enough. From Patrizio’s will (Doc. 5.3, see below note 6) we can deduce that in 1688 the palazzo at S. Luigi was valued at 30,000 scudi, and a third part of Castel Giuliano at 47,794 scudi, making it worth 143,382 scudi in total. (See below.) These figures compare more than favourably with other families of like rank, although generally less than past and present papal families, who had assets ranging from 800,000 to 3 million scudi, implying an income of 32,000 to 120,000 scudi. 6. ASV, Archivio Patrizi-Montoro, B4, fols 276–89, dated 19 January 1688, opened 26 October 1689. (Doc. 5.3.) 7. There were other clauses in Patrizio’s will designed to prevent these portions being alienated, for example, if one of his heirs should commit a crime (fol. 286r), or become a religious (fol. 286r). In the latter case the stipulation that monasteries or other institutions should not benefit was ‘not out of hatred of monasteries, churches, convents, or of religion and the religious … but solely in order to preserve the heredity’ (non in odio de i monasterij, chiese, conventi, e religione, religiosi, et altre, ma solo per la conservatione dell’heredità). 8. Patrizio the elder may originally have hoped that more of his sons would enter the Church. In an early version of his will, dated 26 June 1678, when several of his sons were still children, he specified an annual income of 1000 scudi per annum to those of his younger sons who entered the Church, but only 500 scudi to those who did not. ASV, Archivio Patrizi-Montoro, B41, fols 356–65. 9. See Ferraro, 1994, vol. 2, 995, table and p. 1040, note 14. Some were held by his wife, Virginia Corsini, and quite a few by his third son Filippo. Many of these offices were owned continuously within the family from 1691 to the 1730s, although Cardinal Patrizi held several cavalierati di S. Pietro that were disposed of between 1691 and 1703, and Filippo in 1733 owned several cavalieri del giglio that did not appear earlier. According to this source Filippo held the post of chierico di camera in 1733, valued the same as Cardinal Patrizi’s had been in 1703. 10. Ferraro, 1994, vol. 2, table on pp. 994–95, and pp. 1040–41, note 14. In 1626 the post of chierico di camera cost 36,000 scudi, so the price had increased over the years (Nussdorfer, 46). See also Ago, 1990. 11. See Nussdorfer, 1992, 46-47; Moroni, 1840–79, vol. 43, p. 239. 12. Ferraro, 1994, vol. 2, p. 991, pp. 1034–35 note 12. 13. Both positions, like the chierici di camera and governor of Rome, answered to the cardinal Chamberlain. Nussdorfer, 1992, pp. 46–47. 14. At the time when the will was drawn up the sons were adult (Costanzo was 34, Giovanni Battista 30, Filippo 28, Mariano 25, and Francesco 23), and there may have been personal tensions. 15. Nussdorfer, 1992, p. 46, gives the figure of 60,000–70,000 scudi for the cost of this post; presumably the price was higher by the end of the century, as it was for the post of chierico di camera. 16. Minozzi, 2000, pp. 24, 27. The family had owned other palazzi in Rome, most notably the palazzo near S. Caterina di Funari, known today as the Palazzo Patrizi-Clementi, sold in 1747. 17. See above, note 6. (Doc. 5.3.) 18. Some details of the will seem to have been out-of-date, since, according to the Sestiginiani genealogy, Olimpia had married Giovanni Battista Orlandini in 1679, with a dowry of only 28,000 fiorini (7000 scudi) (ASV, Archivio Patrizi-Montoro, B430, no. 31) (Doc. 5.1). The same source does not give the date of Cunegonda’s marriage, and gives the same figure for her dowry. Assuming Cunegonda was married when she was about 20, that is around 1675, the dispositions in the will may in fact have dated from between this date and 1679 when Olimpia married. Patrizio may have decided to give the same dowry to Olimpia as to her older sister and had failed to update his will in 1688. 19. These figures may be compared with the value of other dowries taken\n\nRediscovering a Baroque Villa in Rome: Cardinal Patrizi and the Villa Patrizi 1715-1909\n\n18/11/15 17:23\n\nfrom the Sestigniani genealogy. Patrizio the elders generation: 45,500 fiorini (11,375 scudi) brought by Patrizio’s wife, Virginia Corsini, in 1649. Costanzo’s generation: 33,333 fiorini (8333 scudi) brought by Costanzo’s wife, Porzia Gabrielli, in 1679. The younger Patrizio’s generation: 35,000 fiorini (8,750 scudi) provided for his sisters, Maddalena, Caterina, and Laura; 43750 fiorini (10,938 scudi for the daughter of Costanzo’s cousin, Vittoria Bernadini Spada Veralli; and the 22,000 scudi brought by Angela Carpegna when she married the younger Patrizio in 1716 (ASV, Archivio Patrizi-Montoro, Patrizi, B4, fols 370–74). Angela was to have been paid 16 scudi per month in pin money, so that her dowry was profitable for the family: at 4 per cent it would have yielded 73 scudi per month.\n\nwho, according to the family tree in ASV, Archivio Patrizi-Montoro B31, fol. 1, was Marchese Orlandini de’ Corsini. The distinction between titled families and those without was not, however, so very great; the fluid nature of Roman society, which before the reign of Benedict XIV lacked a ‘golden book’ defining which families were noble and which were not, meant that new families steadily acquired titles, as the Patrizi had done. As Nussdorfer (1992, pp. 98–99) points out, the essential difference was between gentlemen (gentiluomini) and titled lords (signori titolati), the latter being the old titled feudal families like the Colonna, rather than newer marchesi. Within the former, the main distinction was between old families, like the Patrizi (with Roman roots of more than about a century) and new.\n\n20. Wasserman, 1968, p. 110.\n\n34.

Patrizio had devoted many of his energies to developing it, and Costanzo would continue to regard it as his principal rural property, to which he would retire for the summer villeggiatura, and Cardinal Patrizi would make guilty references to the way he and his brothers had neglected it. See the Letter, 9 May 1722 [5], where, in the context of finishing work at Palazzo Patrizi, he expresses his guilt at not spending money on Castel Giuliano on which his father had lavished attention, which he needed to leave in a suitable condition to his father’s namesake, the younger Patrizio.\n\n25. The works undertaken in 1712-15 are discussed in Guerrieri Borsoi, 1988b, pp. 385–86; Wasserman, 1968, 110, note 66; Pedrocchi, 2000, p. 248 cat. 119; and Graf, 1995, cats 225–26. 26. ASV, Archivio Patrizi-Montoro, B4, fols 370–74. 27. The distinctions between fedecommesso and primogenitura are not, however, always made clear in the documents. As Ferraro (1994, vol. 1, p. 141) observes: ‘By the later 17th century, the principle of primogeniture has become so accepted that when persons used the term fidecommesso, they took it for granted that special control would be given to the eldest natural and legitimate heir.’ Hence in the elder Patrizio’s will he refers to the fedecommesso, rather than primogenitura, of Costanzo: ‘al fidecommesso del già Signor Giovanni Patritij nel suo testamento rogato per gl’atti del Ceccarelli sotto il di 27 febraro 1652’ (ASV, Archivio Patrizi-Montoro, B4, 283v).

The fidecommesso of Giovanni is mentioned frequently in Patrizio’s will (Doc. 5.3, see note 6 above). Giovanni (1590–1631) was the father of Patrizio and the son of Soldrerio (died 1614) by his second marriage; Mariano (1599–1654) was Giovanni’s brother. Francesco (1598–1634) and Costanzo (1589–1624) were the sons of Soldrerio by his first marriage. 31. Based on the family tree in Minozzi, 2000, pp. 14–15. 32. Letter, 16 January 1723 [3]. 33. Noble marriages in this period were highly stratified, as Ferraro (1994, vol. 1, pp. 65–66) has shown, in the period 1600–99, on average 45 per cent of marriages of marchesi were with women from families of the same rank; in the case of the Patrizi it was 55 per cent. Patrizio’s wife Virginia Corsini came from a Florentine family of marchesi, and was the aunt of Cardinal Lorenzo Corsini, the future Pope Clement XII. Of Patrizio’s children, both Costanzo and one of the two sisters who did not go into convents married into the untitled families of gentlemen: Gabrielli and D’Aste. The other sister married an Orlandini\n\nPart 1.

As Pedrocchi has suggested, it is likely that the painting was retouched later, perhaps by Mariano, to bring it up to date. A somewhat laboured bust-length version facing right might even be wholly by Mariano or Francesco (Fig. 1.4).4 What appears to be a copy or version of the three-quarter length variant has the draperies changed to the red of a cardinal’s mozzetta, although the lacework is unchanged (Fig. 1.5).5 Another three-quarter length derivation is signed by Gian Domenico Porta (who also made a signed copy of the Ceccarini portrait of Maria Virginia Patrizi) more comprehensively reworks the garments into those appropriate to a cardinal, including changes to the lacework (Fig. 1.6).6 In these portraits, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Patrizi is presented as a typical eighteenth-century prelate: one who was affable and enjoyed the pleasures of life, but who was also industrious, as is demonstrated by the way he is usually shown writing a letter.7 Giovanni Battista had a career that was in many ways typical. As the second son of a noble family he was destined for the Church, with the hope and expectation that he would obtain high office.8 After receiving doctorates of philosophy, law and theology from the University of Siena, his first step was purchased for him by his father as a family investment, the post of chierico della camera, discussed in Chapter 14\n\nLibro MARSHALL.indb 14\n\nFig. 1.2.

Innocent XII appointed him Governor of Perugia and Umbria in 1699, which Moroni considered to be a bad career move, followed by an appointment as vice-legate in Urbino. His career path as a practical administrator was now set. In 1702 Patrizi was ordained, and was given the titular archbishopric of Seleucia (6 February 1702). This was one of the bishoprics of sees that no longer existed that were routinely given to those pursuing a career in the Curia or as nuncios.10 His real job was to be nuncio (papal ambassador) in Naples from 17 February 1702 until 3 April 1708, to which was added by the post of administrator of the archdiocese of Naples.11 In Naples Monsignor Patrizi was caught up in the events associated with the War of Spanish Succession of 1708. The accession of Philip V, the Bourbon grandson of Louis XIV, to the Spanish throne in 1700 had raised the spectre of a Bourbon superpower uniting Spain and France. Pope Clement XI Albani attempted, unsuccessfully, to remain\n\nneutral while also attempting to maintain the privileges of the Church in the face of its increasing political irrelevance. Naples had long been a Spanish viceroyalty, but was now claimed by the Austrian Hapsburgs; and Naples had traditionally offered a feudal tribute to the papacy through the ceremony of the Chinea. This ceremony, held on the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul on 29 June, involved the representative of the king of Naples, the Contestabile Colonna, making the ceremonial offering of a tribute of 7000 scudi and a richly decorated white horse (or mule) to the pope.12 In 1701 the pope refused to accept the tribute since acceptance might have been construed as supporting the claim of the Spanish Bourbons. This offended Philip V, and when Patrizi arrived in Naples in the following year, without bringing with him credentials recognising Philip V (who was then resident there) as king of Naples, he was refused audience as papal nuncio. In due course he would be received, but only as the administrator of the Church’s interests in Naples, not as a diplomat representing the pope.13\n\nPart 1.

Probably based on Fig. 1.3, with the dress updated from that of monsignor to cardinal.\n\nSubsequently, the situation for the papacy worsened, and in 1707 an Austrian Hapsburg army passed through the papal states and took Naples unopposed on 7 July 1707. (It would become an Austrian viceroyalty from 1713, until the Spanish Bourbons took over again in 1735.) Patrizi was deeply involved in the diplomacy associated with these events, echoes of which are heard in Valesio’s diary.14 Then, in August 1707, it was announced that he would be promoted to the important post of Papal Treasurer (tesoriero generale),15 the same position held by his illustrious ancestor Costanzo in the seventeenth century.16 Valesio reported on Saturday 4 February 1708 that he had had an accident, but had recovered.17 He was formally appointed on 2 April 1708, and arrived in Rome on Saturday, 7 April 1708.18 On Monday, 9 April 1708 Valesio reported that he had taken up the post, the pope having separated from this office the care and governance of the Castel S. Angelo, fortresses and galleys, which were given to Monsignor Marini, auditore della camera.19 On Tuesday, 24 April, Valesio reported that Patrizi took part\n\nin a ceremony in which the papal famiglia assembled in S. Maria in Vallicella and proceeded to mass at Saint Peter’s. 20 Unlike his ancestor Costanzo, Patrizi made it to the next, and most important, step in the Church hierarchy when, on 16 December 1715, he was created cardinal in the eleventh creation of Clement XI.21 His titular church, on which he seems to have left no mark, was SS. Quattro Coronati. Almost immediately he set to work on his new villa, which rose rapidly. Then, on 10 January 1718 he was appointed cardinal legate in Ferrara, that is, the civil governor of the province of Ferrara, the northernmost component of the Papal States. This was a recognition of his administrative abilities, which were evidently considerable: Moroni refers to his ‘moderazione, gentilezza di tratto, equità, and amore del publico bene’.22 He was reappointed twice, by successive popes (on 28 May 1721 and 12 June 1724), and so was in a less useful position to advance his career further. There is no hint in the Letters that he aspired to be pope, but for all cardinals it was a possibility, a call to be answered, if not a post to be sought,\n\n16\n\nLibro MARSHALL.indb 16\n\nRediscovering a Baroque Villa in Rome: Cardinal Patrizi and the Villa Patrizi 1715-1909\n\n18/11/15 17:23\n\nFig. 1.7.
