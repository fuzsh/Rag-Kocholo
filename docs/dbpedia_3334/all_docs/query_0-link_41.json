        "text": "LIBERATED FROM A LIFE OF MEANINGLESS ACTIVITY\n\nRead this stirring account of how a twisted and tormented life can be transformed in just a moment, how a marriage on the rocks can be resurrected and how a life of bondage can be given liberation forever. Here is an Emmanuel TV story sure to stir wonder in the depths of your heart, bring a tear to your eye and leave you in awe of an awesome God.\n\nLife was literally hellish for Maria Chisanga, her volatile husband dealing her verbal and physical abuse again in a fit of drunken madness. Their marriage had not started on such a chaotic note but alcohol had slowly consumed, overtaken and destroyed him. Alex was not the same man she had first met. For the young Zambian couple, already with two kids, the situation was dire and the marriage at the point of breaking beyond repair. “I don’t know whether it was due to the money I started having”, Alex reminisced. “but the moment we had our second kid, problems started coming and I started drinking. I was going out every night with friends and they influenced me to drink. From that time, things started to go downhill. The deeper it went, the worse life became and I started drinking badly. It was uncontrollable”.\n\nAs the alcohol clouded his judgement and veiled his values, Alex started going regularly outside his marital home, eloping with different women on various occasions, including the younger sister of Maria’s closest friend. He had three children outside of wedlock. “Eventually I ran away from my house, with my wife crying bitterly. They went to my father and different pastors – still they couldn’t stop me. You know, when you are carried away – you are gone.” Alex finally left his house in disarray, with his five children from Maria becoming virtually fatherless. “I was still financially supporting my wife, but soon stopped because I was with other women. That’s when I moved completely to Botswana and forgot about taking care of her and the children completely.”\n\nEach attempted return to reconcile resulted in more strife and fights. Maria eventually made the decision to her hometown. “When my husband started drinking, it was horrible,” Maria soberly stated. “It was a time of crying, a time of crises, a very hard time for me. We were fighting and shouting at each other every day. He was beating me any time he felt like it. My children were so much affected by the drinking of their father. They came to the point of telling me, ‘Mummy – if you can leave this man, I think it would be better for you – because this man is beating you and bringing so many problems in our lives today.’ Even paying their school fees was a problem. Eating was a problem. He was beating me so much and I got tired. I prayed and prayed until I got tired and decided to leave the marriage.”\n\nIf anyone is in a position to explain the devastating and destructive effect of alcohol abuse, it is Alex Chisanga. With turmoil throughout his home and life, Alex habit of extreme drinking established itself devilishly in his life. He literally existed in a state of delirium, dependent on the next beer-binge. “There was not a day that I did not drink,” he vividly explained. “The time I am talking with you now, maybe a carton would be gone. You know, when I got paid, I would buy some cartons and put them in the fridge instead of buying food. I might go and get five or six cartons and put them in the fridge. It came to the extent that I could not even sit like this without having a beer because I would be shaking. I needed to have a beer with me. When I was going to the toilet, I would carry a beer. It came to a time when I couldn’t even cook for myself. I had to go out and buy food before I could eat. Sometimes, I would spend two or three days without food but beer was there. Even when I was going to bed, when I slept, I would be having a bottle with me. As I would be trying to sleep, I would be drinking. In the night, all I would dream of was beer. And the moment I woke up, I would start. Sometimes, the bottle would fall from my hands in the night. You would just get up in the morning and see the mess, go to the fridge and get another one. I couldn’t live without beer. Like you are sitting down now – I couldn’t. I needed to have it with me. I needed to have it in my stomach – if I didn’t, I would become something else. I would become wild.”\n\nAs to be expected, the extreme addiction had taken its toll on him both physically and psychologically, with regular thoughts of suicide whirling within his head. “Physically, I was not normal. There were times when I would feel like a mad person. All it would tell you – go to the fridge, it is there. I even went bankrupt because of my alcohol addiction. If it was not there and you didn’t have money in the bank, I would force myself to go and sell something so that at least, it would be there. It must be there. My vehicle – I sold it because of that. We had two fridges; I sold one of them. I sold everything to buy beer. I was only left with my TV and a bed to sleep in. If you came close to me, you would sense the smell of my beer. It got to the extent that my whole body smelt of beer because sometimes I wouldn’t bathe. I would start to have a headache that was unstoppable – then something would come to m and tell me to get rid of my life.” Even while performing his duties as a heavy truck driver, Alex would drive under the influence of alcohol; astonishingly however, he was able to avoid accidents. “I used to hide alcohol at work. Even when I was driving, behind my seat you would find a carton of my beer.”\n\nThe downward spiral continued for Alex, bound in what could be termed as slavery to the spirit of alcohol that had totally engulfed his existence. It was the December of 2008 – over three years since he had last seen or spoken to his wife when his life dramatically changed. “One Sunday morning, a friend of mine came to find out whether I was at home,” explained Alex, who had been drinking throughout the nights of Friday and Saturday. “He asked me if I had a decoder in my living room.” In tune with his answer, the friend entered his house and fiddled with the apparatus before tuning in to a particular television station. “He increased the volume and then joined me outside on the veranda where I was drinking. After a while, he heard the voice of the man of God preaching.” Alex’s friend had tuned to Emmanuel TV, and it was the start of a live Sunday Service from The SCOAN with Prophet T.B. Joshua. “By the time he heard the man of God say, ‘Distance is not a barrier! Let us pray for the viewers’ – he said to me, ‘Alex – you need to come and watch this.’ ” Literally forcing the reluctant drunkard to enter his house, his friend brought him before the television. “He told me: ‘Come – I need you to touch the screen’. I told him, ‘No, let me just watch the man.’ Then he just grabbed my hand and forcefully put it on the screen. At that moment, the man of God said: ‘Whatever is not of Jesus – out!’ That’s when I went out on the ground.” Rolling uncontrollably on the floor of his living room, Alex was receiving a remarkable deliverance as a church service some thousands of miles away in Lagos, Nigeria progressed. The spirits tormenting his life and family were being chased out. “I must have been there for over 10 minutes. All I remember is that the man of God shouted, ‘In the name of Jesus – you are free’ and I just woke up at once, sweating profusely.”\n\nAlex slowly got up, several neighbours having gathered due to the commotion, stared at him in amazement. The darkness that clouded his blood-shot eyes had gone. “I looked around and the first thing I asked was: ‘Where is my wife?’ My friend who had put on Emmanuel TV and all my neighbours started crying. They told me ‘Alex, your wife left you over three years ago.’ I couldn’t believe it. I went to the bedroom and started checking for my wife’s clothes. Then I discovered it was true – my wife was no longer with me. I began to cry.” Alex asked for a drink of water and a disbelieving neighbour brought out both bottles of water and beer, asking him to choose. He chose water.\n\nThe following day, Alex took a fortnight’s leave from work and started a desperate journey back to Zambia to find his wife. Discovering that his five children were scattered throughout the community and that his wife had returned to her father’s house, he set out to meet her. The passion to reunite was so deep that the journey of four days took him only two, to the point where he was 15km from the village of his father-in-law but with no transport available. “I walked the 15km on foot with the rain pouring and soaking me throughout. It was 1.00 when I finally arrived.” In the dead of night, Alex stood before his wife’s house and cried out. “When my father-in-law heard my voice, he said, ‘Alex, is that you?’ He then turned to shout, ‘Maria – your husband is here!’ ” It was a glorious moment, an unprecedented reconciliation upon 10 minutes in front of a unique television station. “Everyone was crying and we were hugging one another. In the morning, we had a meeting as a family. I had to explain to them what happened and how I got delivered through Emmanuel TV. They were surprised because what they heard about me and what they were seeing was a totally different thing. I knelt and apologised in the presence of the family, but my father-in-law stood me up and said: You remain our son. They killed a goat and we ate and celebrated together.” “It was a wonderful day,” recalled Maria. “Despite all that had happened, we were so happy to see him back in our lives – because we didn’t stop loving him. We were always praying for him and asking God to intervene in his situation – and He did!” After one week, the reunited couple returned to Botswana.\n\nAlex’s remarkable encounter with God through Emmanuel TV signalled the last alcoholic drink he took, as well as the birth of a new relationship with Maria. “It’s like we have just been married. I never realised before how beautiful my wife is! Now when I am off work, I will be in the house, working and eating together with her. I also reunited with my children, and they came back to spend holidays with us.” It can be genuinely called a total transformation. “Thank God for the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV for what they have done – they have brought life to my life. I was a dead person who had nothing in the head apart from beer – beer was my focus. If I didn’t have a beer, I didn’t have anything. But today, I am a different person, I don’t even think about beer anymore, not a single craving.” For Maria, it’s as if she has a new husband. “There is a big, big difference in his life – now he is a new man. We can share the Bible together; we can pray together, we can do all things together. No more drinking. No more fighting. No more shouting. He is even a preacher of the Word of God now! We are enjoying our relationship!”\n\nHer advice to couples about entering marriage is on the necessity of involving God. “I will advise those who are entering into marriage to invite God into their life, because a marriage without God has a limit but with God – all things are possible. To my fellow people out there, hold fast to God – our God is a good God, He never fails. Jesus is a conqueror – and once you believe in Him, you too are a conqueror with Him.”\n\nAlex’s advice, informed by an unforgettable life-experience, is simple: “Thank God that I can give you these words of advice: do not go into alcohol. Rather choose the Lord Jesus Christ, who will give you life, who will give light to your future. Not beer – beer doesn’t give life. Beer only spoils your life and kills you in a manner that the more beer you drink, the older you become, the more you destroy yourself – your life will be miserable. Let’s hold fast to God, not the things of this world. Let’s have a new life in Him that will never put us in misery, a new life that will always bring joy and happiness. God created us in His own image and He wants us to follow His ways. How lucky we are that we are given Emmanuel TV! We’ve been given the prophet – Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua. He is not the prophet of Nigeria; he is a prophet of all nations. He is a prophet that is given to us to change our lives. Like me personally speaking now – if you saw me some years ago, you would shed tears. The tears you would be shedding are tears of joy that Emmanuel TV and its partners with Prophet T.B. Joshua have brought life to me today. I, Alex, am alive today because of Emmanuel TV. All I can say is thank you! I thank Jesus for saving my life and for giving me another chance!”\n\nWise Man Christopher, with his usual fervour, issued his message which he titled, ‘The Weapons Of Our Warfare’ to the congregation and cited many portions of the Bible to make his case clear. In his words, the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but spiritual through God in pulling down every demonic stronghold. The Word, he clarified, is not on the written page of the Bible but in the lips of the believers. As Christians, you need to fill your mind and heart with the Word to speak it. In Matthew 4 : 1-11, Jesus gave Christians the battle plan when He spoke directly to the devil in the wilderness. You need to learn the value of God’s Word on your lips to confront the devil victoriously. In Ephesians 6:17, the Bible tells us that those who overcome satan will be required to use the power of the spoken Word. David, in 1 Samuel 17:45 – 50 used the Word of God in his heart as a weapon to defeat Goliath. David’s first victory was therefore in the choice of the right weapon, which was the Word of God on his lips. As Christians, Jesus has given us the Word of God as a special weapon that no power of satan can withstand. Whatever your giant or mountain, you, as a Christian, can address it with the Word of God and achieve total victory. Prayer in the power of the Holy Spirit is the most formidable weapon, the wise man concluded his message.\n\nWOMAN EFFECTUALLY DELIVERED FROM EATING HER HAIR\n\nA week after her deliverance, Mrs Josephine Eseme Jimmy, standing beside her husband, happily gave thanks to God for her deliverance as, according to her, the urge to eat her hair had completely disappeared. Josephine came to The SCOAN the previous Sunday for deliverance from addiction to eating her hair, including those on her head, armpits and private parts. She said the addiction took form after she heard a voice ordering her to eat her hair. The unusual behaviour was cultivated before her marriage and had continued since then for a length of 23 years. After her confession, Josephine was delivered in the mighty name of Jesus by Prophet T.B. Joshua who told her that she was free and would not eat her hair anymore. She said that in her dream two days after the deliverance, the demon appeared to her to lure her to the old act but immediately, the man of God also appeared and the demon ran in fear. The man of God then held her and she woke from sleep. That was the end of her addiction to eating her hair. The couple thanked the prophet one more time for being used by Jesus to bring about her deliverance. In reaction, the prophet once more established the difference between authority and power. In his words, knowing facts about Jesus does not change your relationship with Him. He however added that your reward for a relationship with Jesus is power.\n\nSPIRITUAL HUSBAND’S HOLD RELEASED IN JESUS’ NAME\n\nA video clip on the events of the previous Sunday service showed Wise Man Daniel as he laid hands on the congregants. A woman among them,Mrs Alberta Boakye from Ghana reacted by manifesting the spiritual husband in her.\n\nThe spirit, speaking through her, said Alberta was his wife who disobeyed her to marry an earthly husband. The spirit added that it had destroyed the husband’s ministry for that reason. The spirit also said their second child could not learn because of the punishment by the spiritual husband. She was then delivered after prayer from Wise Man Daniel. Standing by her pastor husband as she gave her testimony, Alberta revealed that she sensed the spiritual husband in her life at the age of 16 when it used to have sex with her in her dreams. The spirit had been a thorn in their marriage of ten years, causing her to inflict emotional pain on her husband all the time. Under the influence of the spirit, she became the husband and took delight in issuing orders to her husband and beating him. She was however relieved to be free after her deliverance.\n\nIn response to the prophet, Pastor Nicholas the husband chronicled all the shameful treatment his wife inflicted on him under the influence of the spiritual husband. She would wake up and ask her husband in the dead of night to clean the house and wash the dishes. When she knew it was fasting time for her husband, she would deliberately set food before him to break the fast unjustifiably. Either she would meet the husband in the church to fight and embarrass him or prevent him by force from going to church after he was ready. On such occasions, the pastor whose church had branches in other countries, would call his fellow pastors in the church to ask them to carry on as he was still ‘waiting on God’. He lost his congregation to other churches and the branches closed because of the wife’s abnormal behaviour. A king of the community who attended his church withdrew his membership because of the wife’s behaviour. After praying for the deliverance of the pastor, Prophet T.B. Joshua assured him that he would assist him to reactivate his ministry and re-open the branches. Asked to comment on her husband’s confession, Alberta, in unmistakable remorse said, ‘I feel bad and sad’ and bemoaned satan for all that her husband had suffered in her hands. Prophet T.B. Joshua ended the episode by explaining that it was the evil spirit inside the wife that was responsible and now that she was delivered, her husband should not remind her of the past.\n\nMAN DELIVERED FROM THE SPIRIT OF MASTURBATION\n\nA man from Delta, Nigeria, Solomon Ogheneovo by name, told the congregation of himself as a victim of the spirit of masturbation for 24 years. He thought that getting married would stop the embarrassing act but in fact, it continued. Even after marriage, he masturbated at least every day. After unsuccessful efforts, which included fasting and prayer, on his part to stop it, he finally decided to seek the face of the Lord in The SCOAN. After receiving the Anointing Water, he gathered his family and they prayed with it. That prayer, according to him, marked the end of his masturbation. He thanked God for using the prophet to bring an end to this torment in his life.\n\nANOINTING WATER RESTORES MENSTRUATION\n\nMrs Mercy Anthony told listeners how she regained her menstruation which ceased for seven years, completely unresponsive to her efforts to reactivate it. She said a good Samaritan gave her a virtually empty bottle of the Anointing Water which she topped with water, prayed with and ministered on herself. Following that, her menstruation miraculously reappeared. She ended her testimony by advising all her listeners to trust God who has an answer to whatever problems they might have.\n\nANOINTING WATER RESTORES MEMORY AND FETCHES PROMOTION\n\nRahamat Yusuf Suleiman had an accident in April which, among other injuries, affected her memory. This affected her reading and preparation for her promotion examination in her workplace. The result was that she failed the examination and was denied promotion. After efforts elsewhere to find a cure had failed, she sent a friend to The SCOAN for the Anointing Water.\n\nOn receiving the Anointing Water, she prayed with it and sprayed it on herself, particularly her forehead. Soon after, to her amazement, she vomited an earthworm. The Anointing Water gave her total healing and following her prayer with it before going for another promotion examination in her workplace, she found the questions the same as the ones she had read, making her pass the examination with ease. As she gave her testimony, Rahamat displayed her promotion letter which was the outcome of her success in the examination. Rahamat advised her listeners to go to the Lord always for a solution to their problems.\n\nCHRISTMAS GIFTS FOR THE AGED, DISABLED AND CHILDREN WORLDWIDE\n\nThe Emmanuel TV Team and Partners as usual filled trailers with gifts of rice, flour and other food items and transported them to the elderly and physically challenged both within Nigeria and internationally.\n\nTwo of the many states in Nigeria that were visited by The Emmanuel TV Team were Yobe and Borno in the far north of the country. The team set off with two trailers each filled to capacity with rice and flour, in addition to cash gifts. The venue for the meeting with the Emmanuel TV Team was General Hospital Leprosy Centre, Maiduguri. People gathered from all around Borno State to attend the meeting.\n\nThe team sent by T.B. Joshua presented the community leaders with cash gifts and the bags of rice were distributed among everyone, regardless of race, faith or background. The Bible teaches us that we should love our neighbours as ourselves. In the same vein, various gifts were also dispatched to the needy and elderly people in Kremenchuk, Ukraine. In the Asian continent, Lahore, Pakistan was also visited with bags of rice, flour and other gift items.\n\nFINANCIAL AID TO VISUALLY IMPAIRED STUDENTS\n\nIn the course of the service, five visually impaired students from the University of Jos were led to the platform where they narrated their financial problems as students, one after another.\n\nYakubu, a student of Special Education and Rehabilitation Sciences, was the first to bare his mind about his financial needs as a student and concluded that he needed the sum of N92,000.00 to pay his school fees and solve other problems as a student. The rest, in turn, also spoke, explaining that as students, even the money to release their results was hard to come by. Upon listening to their complaint, the prophet directed that their needs be met. Consequently, a total sum of N284,300.00 and bags of rice were disbursed among them.\n\nMASS PRAYER FREES ALL\n\nPraying in the power of the Holy Spirit, Prophet T.B. Joshua led the congregation and viewers worldwide in a powerful time of mass prayer. Many vomited the poisons long buried in their systems, thus receiving their freedom. The prophet prayed for the total release of his listeners in many areas of their lives, including their finances, businesses, marital lives among others. He also prayed for the restoration of their destinies and health. In the course of the mass prayer, the prophet issued prophecies to some people who, in reaction came forward to confirm the prophecies. Confirming that the entire congregation had been delivered and was free, the prophet proceeded to say the grace and bring the service to a close.\n\nWise Man Christopher opened the service by assuring the congregation that satanic authorities over their homes and businesses would be broken, in the name of Jesus Christ.\n\nHe started his message by saying that there are two classes of people seeking a solution. The first class does not identify the cause of the problem but the second does and as a result receives a permanent solution\n\nThe wise man chose ‘The Permanent Solution’ as the title of his message and opened his Bible to Mark 2:1-5 as the proof text. He explained that the permanent or lasting solution gives lasting prosperity, healing, peace and blessing forever. Citing Romans 5:12, he said man has lost the lasting relationship with God through sin. In his words, Jesus came because the relationship between God and man was broken. His mission was to restore the relationship. Jesus Christ needed love, forgiveness and grace to restore the broken relationship. This, he said, is echoed in Luke 23:24 where Christ said, ‘Father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing’. This statement, the wise man said, applies to everybody today. Building on this, Wise Man Christopher advised that we must show forgiveness in our relationships; for where there is forgiveness there is a solution. Forgiveness of sin deals with the cause of the problem. Jesus identified sin (Mark 2:2-5) as the cause of the sickness of the paralytic. Those seeking a solution to their problem should identify the cause and seek a lasting solution to it. Problems recur because people never identified the causes and dealt with them. This is why many people who are blessed today become poor tomorrow, a healthy man relapses into sickness and a landlord becomes a tenant. This is also why people bother about blessing rather than sin which is the cause of poverty; comfort rather than sin, the cause of discomfort. Sin in the soul is the cause of sickness, poverty, career failure and instability in economic life. Bothering about a problem without identifying the cause cannot give a permanent solution.God separated light from darkness (Genesis 1:3-5). When we sin, we belong to the kingdom of darkness. Jesus is the way out of darkness. In Ephesians 5:8, those in darkness because of sin were released into light in the Lord. Jesus, the glorious Light, has come to dispel all darkness. When born again, we are taken from the satanic kingdom of darkness. This is a reality, not an idle imagination. We cannot receive it by merit but by the grace of God. By grace we are called to be forgiven. King David knew this in Psalm 51 where he pleaded for God’s mercy. To King David the mercy of God was like a blank cheque for prosperity and the goodness of life. He was simply confessing his sins for the salvation of his soul. We should not doubt God’s desire and ability to help us. We should consequently not leave any sin in our heart without confessing it. Let us admit that we are guilty and trust in God’s ability to make us clean. What happens to you if you have everything while yet in sin? Whatever you have will face greater challenges that your fame cannot stand (Romans 6:2-3). Christianity is a relationship with Jesus that lasts forever. You need cleansing to enjoy the relationship and all its blessings. The comforts of this world cannot earn you peace. Many are on the sickbed in spite of their wealth and position. Jesus Christ is the permanent solution. When He heals you, He does so effectually and when He blesses you, it is forever. Follow Jesus for He is the road map to the lost, the bread to the hungry and the water to the thirsty. The wise man rounded off his message by praying for his listeners to embrace Jesus, the permanent solution.\n\nGOD IS STEPPING INTO YOUR SITUATION TODAY\n\nT. B. Joshua assured the congregation that God who makes a difference in people’s lives was stepping into their situation to make poverty, hardship, sickness, and all forms of limitation things of the past. Whatever the situation, he said, God has stepped into it to make a difference in your life. God’s power is so real, authentic and forceful that it cannot be limited by time or space.\n\nTHE HOLY SPIRIT STEPPED INTO A MARRIAGE\n\nThe congregation and viewers worldwide then listened to Mr & Mrs Onokohoa who told the tale of a troubled marriage and gave testimony to the mighty deliverance they had received after receiving prayer from Wise Man John Chi. A video clip showed an episode where Wise Man John Chi met a woman as he laid hands on the congregants. The reaction to the prayer was not from the woman but the spiritual husband in her. In anger, the evil spirit told listeners that he married the woman years back in her childhood but somebody brought her to church for deliverance against his will. The spirit went further to disclose the havoc he had done in her life, killing her child and destroying her, as she wanted to free herself from his grip. In response to the wise man’s questions, the woman, under the influence of the evil spirit, disowned her earthly husband and identified clearly with the spiritual one who even warned her not to go close to the earthly husband. The evil spirit told listeners that he had put something in her waist that disturbed the development of her unborn baby and caused her to menstruate while pregnant. As the evil spirit was commanded to leave the woman in the name of Jesus, it shouted ‘I surrender’ and she fell down. Mrs Faith Onokohoa from Bayelsa, Nigeria and her husband then came into the open to confirm the deliverance and share her experiences. In addition to confirming all the evil spirit had said, Faith said the spirit made her lose affection for her husband because it had always laid between them at night and took over the husband’s marital role. For over three months, she never had any sexual intimacy with her husband as a couple. She would also eat in her dreams. All their efforts to free her from the malevolent grip of the evil spirit remained unsuccessful until they came to The SCOAN after watching Emmanuel TV in their home. In his testimony, her husband, Mr Francis Onokohoa added that at night, he would feel the vibration and creaking of their bed even when his wife was apparently enjoying her sleep. In addition, he confessed, the evil spirit gave him weak erection. The couple however confessed that after the deliverance the relationship between them became very normal. As well as confessing feeling lighter after the deliverance, Mrs Onokohua advised all those who had similar problems to look up to God and trust Him for a solution.\n\nICE CUBES FOR BREAKFAST, LUNCH AND DINNER\n\nMrs Antoinette Koko, from South Africa mounted the platform and stunned her listeners that she had come to The SCOAN with the problem of addiction to eating ice cubes for the past fifteen years. The addiction to eating ice cubes, according to her, started in 1996 in a restaurant where she and a friend of hers used to spend time together often drinking cold drinks and eating ice cubes. It soon became a habit. However, while her friend soon dropped the habit, Antoinette’s grew stronger and led to an uncontrollable addiction. Even as a wife to a medical doctor, she kept ice cubes in her deep freezer to satisfy her appetite in disregard of her husband’s warning against it. She ate an average of 3kg of ice cubes daily and preferred to eat ice than food. She fainted twice because of the habit leading to blood transfusion on two occasions. She was however unable to stop and none of the places they went to for a solution were helpful. The congregation sat shocked as they watched a video clip of Antoinette a day earlier, consuming a whole bowl of ice cubes, crunching them just as if they were biscuits. During deliverance, the prophet invited her for a handshake with him but as she came close, her outstretched hand started shivering and later she fell down and the evil spirit that had caused this addiction in her life left her forever. After her deliverance, she was offered another bowl of ice cubes, but after putting one into her mouth, repulsed by the now unpleasant experience, she spat it out again, declaring that she no longer had the desire to eat ice cubes. “Before it was like food to me, but now it is just like water” she said, with tears in her eyes, as she glorified God for what He had done.\n\nA STRANGE DESIRE TO SNIFF AND EAT MARKER PENS\n\nIn succession to Mrs Koko, Mrs Miriam Akande of Osun State, Nigeria came forward with her daughter to plead with the pastor, Prophet T. B. Joshua for the deliverance of her daughter, Miss Miracle Akande whom she said had cultivated the habit of sniffing and eating marker pens. The mother said she was very depressed when she discovered her daughter’s habit. She said the Lord led her to The SCOAN where the Lord said a new thing would happen in her life. She added that her daughter would sniff as many marker pens as she laid her hands on, easily able to consume more than 8 pens per day. Her daughter also enjoyed the smell of petrol, kerosene and methylated spirits. In her confession, Miracle disclosed that the habit started in class when they noticed an unusual odour. Later, it was discovered that it was their teacher’s leaking marker that caused the odour. Unlike the rest of the class, Miracle enjoyed the smell, formed the habit outside the class, and enjoyed it for one and a half years. One of the results of the addiction was that her academic performance had declined. A video was shown of how Miracle would first excitedly sniff a marker pen and then chew it until all the ink had gone.\n\nT.B. Joshua then prayed for her in the power of the Holy Spirit and she fell to the ground. She stood up, delivered and free from the spirit that had been tormenting her. She was offered some marker pens but she immediately shunned the offer and then advised other children to heed the advice of their parents as they were interested in their welfare.\n\nFIBROID MELTED AND TUBES UNBLOCKED\n\nMrs Elizabeth Kanberuka of Namibia also testified to her healing from a uterine fibroid which had caused headaches and vomiting before she would menstruate. The doctor who confirmed her uterine fibroid and tubal blockage had advised her to go for an operation. She however decided to come to The SCOAN where she received the Anointing Water. After prayer at home, she ministered the Anointing Water on herself. When she went for a test later, she was told that she no longer had the problem of uterine fibroid, that her tubes were now normal and that an operation was no longer needed. She advised her listeners and Emmanuel TV viewers worldwide to believe and trust God, even in the midst of their problems\n\nTHE BEST POLICE DRIVER IN ZIMBABWE\n\nMr Innocent Mukanganwa happily addressed his listeners from the platform about the miracle he received by ministering the Anointing Water, in Jesus’ name. He entered into a competition with his five-months of driving experience among other more qualified and seasoned drivers some with many years of driving experience. Lo and behold, he clinched the prize as Zimbabwe’s best police driver of the year.\n\nTIME TO REWRITE FAMILY HISTORY\n\nProphet T.B. Joshua told viewers worldwide that now was the time to break generational curses and rewrite family histories of limitation, hardship, poverty, sickness and backwardness.\n\nHe led the congregation and the viewers as the real, authentic and forceful power of God wrought miracles, signs and wonders blessing the lives of all present and watching worldwide.\n\nThe congregation dispersed thanking God individually from the bottom of their hearts for the grace of witnessing the evidence that truly, distance, time and circumstance are no barrier to the power of God. To the Lord’s power, nothing is impossible.\n\nIn a few remarks of advice before opening the topic of his message, Wise Man Racine reminded the congregation of the protection the righteous man enjoys in the hand of God. In his words, the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord. He advised them to be happy whereas there is nothing to be happy about on the outside. Some people, he went on, complain, lament and murmur in spite of being Christians. The cause, according to him, is that they are centred on what they are doing. Taking a cue from this, the wise man entitled his sermon, ‘See Beyond Your Situation’ and opened to Psalm 91:14 as his proof text. The Lord, he said, has given assurance to all believers of His protection. Troubles, he continued, do not require any invitation before they come. However, when they come, we should be determined because we are not alone. The devil uses our situation to tempt us. Temptations to sin are the most grievous because they are messengers of satan. You should not listen to them because you are not alone. Situations make people act out of character. How do you handle temptations? God, according to him, uses foolish things to prepare us for new things in life. He first humbles those he intends to honour so that they will not be conceited. He cited Daniel in the lion’s den, Joseph and his travails and Anna’s barrenness for years as Biblical cases to buttress his point. He assured his listeners that their problems were meant to prepare them for the blessings of God. He also echoed Prophet T.B. Joshua’s advice to listeners to be careful when entering temptations allowed by God so as not to think it strange and doubt their Guard. When temptations come, there is a purpose. They are meant to draw you closer to God. As a man of faith, victory is yours. A man of faith is led by an indwelling Spirit of grace that is greater than him. He does everything out of a heart of peace, not for sheer popularity. He believes that when he is weak, he is strong. Any confidence that is based on the outside cannot stand the test of time. Jesus is my Healer whether he heals me or not. This is confidence based on faith. With the Word of God in our heart, our confidence is settled and nothing can change us. The heart must be grounded and rooted in the Word of God. If you must speak, you must think first and in accordance with the Word of God. The words we speak create the curses or blessings that come our way. Your words dominate your life because they express your thoughts which are the seeds of your life. You cannot be above your words. A poor man acting poor and enjoying the company of poor people will remain poor. My words need cleansing because my heart needs cleansing. Our heart is cleansed by focusing on the Word of God. Faith focuses on God, not on the situation. Your faith is your personal situation focused on God and His sufficiency. When difficult times come your way, examine all things in the light of God’s Word and listen to the testimonies of your conscience. God’s Word points you to life though your situation may point you to death. The answer to your situation is the Word of God. The Word of God is sure, eternal and cannot fail. You should see beyond your situation where there is God’s purpose for your life. Your situation is meant to draw you closer to God. Once you believe the Word of God, success is yours, the wise man concluded.\n\nOVERCOME YOUR DOUBT\n\nAfter commending the message given by Wise Man Racine, Prophet T.B. Joshua turned to the viewers under the influence of the telecast and assured them that once they listened; their prayers would answer, adding that distance was no barrier. The prophet gave a sermon, which he entitled, ‘Overcome Your Doubt’ and told his listeners that the best saints have need for the help that can make their faith stronger. He drew his listener’s attention to some Biblical characters to make his point. According to him, Abraham in Genesis 15:6, Gideon in Judges 6:36-37 and John the Baptist in Matthew 11, needed signs to make their faith stronger. Though he believed, John the Baptist wanted concrete signs to make his faith set that Jesus was the expected Messiah. Many people in the Bible who we consider pillars of faith had moments of doubt. This however, does not mean that they had less faith but that their faith was challenged in a new way. Moments of doubt arise when unusual things come one’s way. If you are genuinely seeking salvation from God in the midst of doubt, He will not mind because at the end, your doubt will move you closer to God. When situations in life challenge your faith, they should move you closer to God, not farther away from Him. In situations of poverty, sickness and the like, one seems to be tempted to doubt His ability or desire to help. When one’s faith is challenged in a new way, what one has not experienced before in one’s life cropping up will generate panic, anxiety, worry and doubt in one’s faith. John the Baptist, Peter and many Biblical heroes struggled with many doubts. However, doubt can become a sin if it leads you away from God to scepticism, cynicism and then to hard-heartedness. As you move closer to God, you will find the strength to trust God. One of satan’s strategies or tactics is to get you to doubt God’s goodness. One should be patient because God’s time is the best. Satan tries to make you forget all that God has given you and focus on what you do not have. If you spend your time thinking about what you do not have, you may be slipping into unhealthy doubt. Today, we only acknowledge the immediate goodness of God when we receive and thereafter, we never mention that miracle or blessing. The sickness you had in the past, others had it and died while many others are still on the sickbed. You may think it was an ordinary sickness but people die of the sickness every day. Do not doubt God’s desire or ability to help you. When David, a rustic boy (1 Samuel 17:37) was brought to the king to defend his cause, he simply testified to how God delivered, saved and rescued him from the mouth of lion and bear at his tender age. Today, people will mention only the immediate ones and forget those at their tender age. God gives everyone plenty of evidence to believe in Him. Doubt comes when we fail to stop long enough to observe all the evidence. Once in a while, we should create time to reflect over God’s track record in our lives. Many who are from poverty-stricken and sickness–ridden families are able to live above all that today. We are like a man who prayed that he had no shoes and when God gave him money, he went to the market and met another man who had no legs. You should review God’s track record in your life and you will realise that many of you have come from nowhere to somebody. When you take time to review God’s track record, it would grow confidence that He would work in your present situation. Your situation is not like others’ but for the glory of God. You will grow confident that a solution is forthcoming and that God will never fail or abandon you because He never did so in the past. Be patient and let God answer your questions on His own schedule, not on yours. God’s time is the best. At His time, it is all good.\n\nWOMAN DELIVERED FROM INSATIABLE SEXUAL URGE\n\nAt the instance of the prophet, some of the striking incidents and prophecies of the previous Sunday service were visited on video. In course of the mass prayer, the prophet issued a message that there was a woman in the congregation whose sexual urge remained unsatisfied after she had a love encounter with a dog in her dream and he asked the woman in question to come out for deliverance. The woman having been delivered the previous Sunday, re-emerged accompanied by her husband as directed for a testimony. In her testimony, the woman who went by the name Tina Ekezie, narrated her encounter with a dog in her dream after which her marriage was destroyed. She had prayed and fasted but all to no avail. Her marriage after that lacked love for her husband and witnessed much quarrel and hatred. She however, added that after the deliverance her admiration for her husband fully surfaced again. In his testimony, the husband, Eugene Ekezie told the congregation that the radiance displayed by his wife was the function of his money when he was doing well as a kerosene dealer. Since his downfall however, his wife’s attitude and affection for him had become zero, causing a cat and dog relationship between them. Mrs Tina Ekezie knelt before her husband in apology for her past misbehaviour and promised a positive change. The man of God however promised to counsel them on their economic downturn, which seemed to have partially dissipated Tina’s affection.\n\nABANDONMENT LED WOMAN TO PROSTITUTION\n\nAnother clip revealed the prophet issuing a prophecy to a Kenyan lady as he laid hands on the congregation. In the prophecy, he saw the woman living where men were coming to her for sex. She was living as a harlot. The prophecy also added that her father abandoned her as a child and that frustration had led her to that style of life. It concluded that her father owed her an apology for all that. The lady who bore Nelly Wangari as her name confirmed the entire prophecy as true and she was delivered. She retold the prophecy and recounted all the hardship and name calling she went through because of her father’s behaviour. The man of God consoled her, told her that all was past, that God was her Father and that she would soon know why God allowed that suffering in her life.\n\nMAN SENT HIS WIFE PACKING BECAUSE OF RUMOUR\n\nThe next video clip unfolded the prophet as he issued a prophetic message to a man who sent his wife away on the rumour that she was enjoying an extra-marital relationship. The prophecy ended in two questions. The man was asked whether he was sure he had not sent an innocent woman away and how had his life been since he ejected his wife from the marital home. A man who called himself Emmanuel and the suspected wife emerged from the congregation to say the prophecy referred to them. In his testimony, the man said that neighbours used to tell him when he came home that his wife had developed the habit of going out often and coming in late and that she might have a lover outside. That was the basis of his action. The man of God however, told him that the wife was innocent and that the husband was to blame for the challenges that made her go out. In her testimony, Janet, the suspected wife said her husband sent her out because he suspected her with one man. The prophet confirmed her innocence and promised to reconcile them.\n\nMAN RECEIVED ONE MILLION NAIRA FOR HIS BURNT HOUSE\n\nA fairly aged man, Kayode by name, mounted the platform with a photograph of his burnt building and started by apologising to the man of God and the congregation that he had not been paying his tithes. He then added that his house was burnt because of the carelessness of one of his tenants with a generator. The entire roof of the storeyed building was burnt and needed rehabilitation. The man of God blamed him for his failure to contribute to the growth of the church in spite of his wealth. A cash gift of one million naira was given to him to put the building in order.\n\nANOINTING WATER ENDS TWELVE YEARS OF BARRENNESS\n\nA couple who named themselves as Mr and Mrs Oghobo mounted the stage to say they had been barren for twelve years before they received the Anointing Water. They prayed over the Anointing Water after fasting and met as a couple. That very month, according to the man, the woman missed her period. They had gone to many places and medical doctors in search of a pregnancy but without success. The man of God commended them for fasting before ministering the Anointing Water quite unlike many who would just gulp it as soon as they received it. Thanking God for His mercy on their lives, the couple wished their listeners the same fortune in the hand of the Lord.\n\nMIRACLE BABY CAME AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS OF BARRENNESS\n\nMrs Linda Chinwe and her miracle baby mounted the podium next for their testimony. According to her, she had been barren for fifteen years. Her sister in-law brought her to The SCOAN to collect the Anointing Water. It was that, according to her, that ended her infertility because as soon as they met as a couple, she became pregnant. At the time of the testimony, her baby was five months old. She thanked God for His mercy and advised her listeners to have faith in God.\n\nANOINTING WATER ENDS A SEASON OF MISCARRIAGES\n\nMr and Mrs Ani-Nweke climbed the platform to tell their listeners about their ugly experience with miscarriages. They said they came to The SCOAN to meet the man of God for that very reason and he gave them the Anointing Water. They met as a couple after ministering the Anointing Water and the wife became pregnant. They thanked God for His mercy in their lives.\n\nWOMAN DELIVERED SAFELY AFTER PROPHECY\n\nThe video clip revealed a prophecy given by Wise Man John Chi to a pregnant woman in which he reminded her of her unpleasant experience with her earlier pregnancy and her recent dreams in which she used to eat and see dead people. He told her that a similar misfortune might befall her, if she was not delivered. After delivering her, the wise man told her to go home and enjoy a safe delivery. At the end of the video clip, Mr and Mrs Chukwuma climbed the platform to say that the clip was about them. Mrs Chukwuma retold the story as already told on the clip and added that it was on the 14th of August, 2011 that she was in The SCOAN. Her husband added that she delivered her baby safely on the 6th of September, 2011. Both thanked God for His mercy and advised their listeners to take time to remember the way God had worked in their lives.\n\nANOINTING WATER CHANGED MANY LIVES IN INDIA\n\nThe next clip revealed how the Anointing Water worked wonders in the Church of Signs and Wonders, India where Pastor Narula ministered it. Practically everybody who received a spray of the Anointing Water fell down in deliverance. Many cases of healing and deliverance were recorded there, like in the other places where it had been ministered.\n\nSCHOLARSHIPS FOR CHILDREN OF WIDOWS AND PHYSICALLY CHALLENGED\n\nWidows and their children of school age trooped to the platform to receive cash gifts from the prophet to pay their fees for the term. Their spokespersons praised the man of God for making it possible for them to enjoy formal education without tears despite being orphans and seized the opportunity to appeal to other well-to-do Nigerians to emulate the good gesture of the prophet. Among those who spoke were Ebele, Ossai and Caroline Akinpelumu. One Alfred R. among them had physically challenged parents. A total sum of 6 million naira was disbursed to them. As usual, we always have cause to praise the Lord for His marvellous blessings in our lives. May His mighty name be extolled forever!\n\nAfter the choir had prepared the atmosphere with tunes for the Holy Spirit, Wise Man Christopher emerged for the Sunday message. Greeting the congregation warmly and wishing them easy transformation from darkness to light, he proceeded to pray with them. ‘I believe in your Word’, he went on, as the congregation repeated after him. ‘In your Word is my salvation, redemption and victory’, the wise man took the congregation through a length of heart- lifting prayer to the Lord. Beginning with a short story of a Christian friend who wondered why he had trials in his life in spite of his devotion to the work of God, the wise man advised that trials and tribulations were part of Christianity. In his words, the Bible says everyone who works with the Lord will have testing but that as a child of God, your trouble is not like others’; it is for the glory of God. Trouble comes not because of any wrong step but because we are in a complex and contradictory world. The children of God, according to him, are passing through this world to a place prepared for them. This Is Not Heaven, he aptly titled his message. Citing John 16:33 as his proof text, the wise man said Jesus overcame for us and so we shall overcome, though there will be disappointments, as said in the proof text. In 2 Corinthians 12:7-10, Apostle Paul derived strength from the Lord. My grace is made perfect in your weakness. Though Apostle Paul was tormented by a thorn in his flesh, the grace of Christ was sufficient for him and so for us, the wise man affirmed. Continuing, he said the thorn of Christ makes easy and sanctifies our thorns. Jesus took our place in afflictions. Troubles are designed for our spiritual development and to advance our course. Our situation could be to humble us but to leave us dignified at last. Spiritual burdens are ordered to cure spiritual pride. He allows poverty and setback to humble us. He will however, prepare us for it. Those God calls for service, He makes fit for it, Deuteronomy 28:7. The enemies will come in a united manner but they will be confounded and routed by the superior power of the Holy Spirit. Jesus is greater than all the combined forces of hell. He has conquered death for our sake to bring us to the Father. To hope is to look forward to a Heavenly home that will last forever. Stones were hurled at Stephen but his affection for God’s command was regular because of his hope, Acts 7:54. In Romans 8:35-39, Paul advised Christians to keep the solid front in the face of sickness. The rich should not concentrate on their wealth or the poor on their situation because a man may be poor, yet be a candidate of Heaven. Citing Luke 6:20- 26, the wise man recited the beatitudes. Don’t doubt the genuineness of your spiritual experience or question your sonship of Christ because of your situation. The promise of God can only be appropriated by faith which comes through hearing and obeying the Word of God. We were elected before the foundation of the world to inherit the Kingdom of God. Faith is a necessary condition to access Heaven. Faith purifies and justifies us and removes the guilt of sin. The opening of our eyes of faith is the silencing of our fears. Fear not, for those who are fighting for you are more than those out to destroy you. Because you know that Heaven is your permanent Home, let everything that has to do with you be redeemed now and forever, the wise man prayed in conclusion.\n\nTHE OBJECT OF FAITH IS GOD\n\nA lot of Christians, Prophet T. B. Joshua said, after commending the message, grumble and despair about their situation because their lives are centred on how they are doing. How clearly, he asked, do we really see our lives? When you look at your life, what do you see? Do you see your life the way Jesus sees it? Continuing, the prophet added, ‘A man I met yesterday told me that the Holy Spirit gave him an idea but advised him not to take the credit.’ Don’t take the credit, he echoed, is a Word from the Holy Ghost. It is all about Jesus, he said. All we do is to give back what we have received from His generous hands. Don’t take the credit, he reminded his listeners. Citing Mark 11:1, he said whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be removed’, and does not doubt in his heart, it will be done. The prophet emphasized the prayer of faith. The object of our faith is God. Have faith in God, Jesus said, according to him. Teaching today, he went on, encourages believers to have faith in faith. On the contrary, he maintained, it should be on the finished work of Jesus. Because He is good all the time, I can bring my request to Him and cast my cares upon Him. Why complain, murmur or despair? Realising that He is God and I am not; that He is a Father and I am but a child; He is a Shepherd; I am a straying sheep, I should have faith in God. We often hear, he continued, that prayer changes things but this is not entirely true. Prayer, he corrected, changes us; faith causes things to happen. Advising his listeners to have faith in God, he added, today we pray but lack the necessary faith to release the belief in our hearts. There is power in our mouth; the belief in our heart is released by faith out of our mouth. Faith requires us to speak the Word before we feel or see the result. The object of faith, he concluded, is God.\n\nTOTAL DELIVERANCE FROM EATING SAND\n\nDelivered the previous Sunday from the spirit of eating sand and mattress, Ammen in company with his mother appeared on the platform to confirm the deliverance after the video clip refreshed viewers’ minds. Mrs Izah, the mother joyfully told the congregation that her son no more had no appetite for those things after the deliverance. Confirming her mother’s testimony in response to the prophet’s questions, Ammen said that he wanted to be a pastor to pray for the sick, so that they would not die and agreed to submit himself to the fasting and prayer demanded by the profession.\n\nA woman from Anambra, Nigeria and her 14 year-old son took the platform and told the congregation that the son had been eating sand and mattress since the age of four. She added that her watching the deliverance of a girl from Tanzania on Emmanuel TV, fuelled her visit to The SCOAN regarding their plight. Enlightening his listeners on his affliction, Onyeka Ibiano said that at night, an object appeared to him and that caused the addiction to sand and mattress since that time. After touching and staring at him for a while, the prophet declared him free.\n\nMAN DELIVERED FROM THE SPIRIT OF ROBBERY\n\nA video clip revealed Wise Man Racine as he laid hands on worshippers and asking one man among them, ‘Who are you?’ ‘Nobody’, the man responded. Worried that the man’s deliverance was not thorough as he never opened up, the prophet insisted on his re-deliverance. Confirming that he never opened up, Chukwemeka Paul, accompanied by his wife, agreed to open up and told the story of his life. He admitted being a cultist in a group of boys who delighted in drinking, robbing and raping girls. Threatened in Nigeria, he went to Ghana where he discovered that security awareness was even higher and he decided to go into computer training. He married in Ghana but did not approach lovemaking in a normal way, afflicted by the spirit of raping. In a way he never quite understood, he found himself in The SCOAN and after his second deliverance, he demanded to know from the prophet whether the wife who had had twins by him was his God-given wife. He explained that they enjoyed no peace in their marriage and the wife often nagged, calling him a baby especially because of his age. He added that he enjoyed peace more with other women than with his wife. The wife narrated that the man lured her into cultism after she married him. They came into the relationship through a call given to her by the erroneous tapping of just a digit by the man who had intended to call his sister. She was not surprised because her church had told her that her prospective husband would locate her in such a manner. She however complained about the raping approach of her husband to lovemaking. The man of God delivered them and declared their marriage sanctified from Heaven.\n\nYOUNG LADY DELIVERED FROM MANY EVIL SPIRITS\n\nThe osude family from Anambra, Nigeria, though resident in Lagos, appeared on the platform for their testimony. According to the spokesperson among them, they came for the Monday service where Wise Man Christopher prayed and laid hands on them. But on Wednesday, they noticed that their sister, Ikechukwu started to display signs and antics of evil attacks causing her to be violent. It was in that state of violence that they brought her back to the church. As the wise man laid hands on Ikechukwu on the Monday in question, she opened up in a smile and Wise Man Christopher told her that he knew her and she knew he knew her. In her testimony after the second deliverance in the prayer line, she told her listeners that after the Monday service, she began to behave funnily and talk nonsense by Wednesday and so her family brought her to The SCOAN on Thursday. She said she possessed many evil spirits which gave her all sorts of powers that she used to wreck the lives of her parents and siblings. She said her misbehaviour began at the age of five, when she was afflicted with the spirits of lust and gluttony among others. At the age of five, she was fond of watching herself act before a mirror, where a woman appeared to her and asked her whether she would be her friend. She agreed and thereafter, she played with the woman often, though unnoticed by other people. She started having meetings in the spirit world and had astral powers by which she visited many parts of the world effortlessly. She attacked members of her family one after the other. She afflicted her father with high blood pressure and made him a debtor. She wrecked her mother’s business and rendered her sisters jobless in spite of their very good degrees in International Relations. At the end of her breath-taking and most surprising confession, she pleaded with the man of God to deliver her family from all the evils of the devil for the past 50 years.\n\nANOINTING WATER DELIVERS THE WORLD\n\nThe miraculous work of the Anointing Water in the four corners of the earth was shown on Emmanuel TV. In country after country where the Anointing Water was administered, the atmosphere became charged with anointing that set the devil and all its evil spirits in confusion and disarray. Many of the faithful in such locations became delivered from ailments which many prayers of yesteryears were yet to free them from. In eager anticipation of the miracles associated with the Anointing Water, congregants besieged the venues in their thousands before the appointed time of service. To the glory of God, they were not disappointed because many left the scene with testimonies of deliverance and healing. That was the picture in London, UK; Athens, Greece; Cape Town, South Africa; Accra, Ghana and other locations where the Anointing Water was ministered. In Cameroon, where the man of God had just okayed a house fellowship for a family about a month before, the congregation was so much that the man of God, in his surprise, never knew how to classify it. Equally amazing, according to the family granted the concession, was the dumbfounding work of the Anointing Water in deliverance and healing.\n\nWRISTBAND WRIGGLES POLICE OFFICER FROM DEATH\n\nMr John Mark of Kogi State but working in Katsina as a chief superintendent of police also mounted the platform for his testimony. He said he had come to The SCOAN on 31st December for a breakthrough service during the candle night. He added that the man of God prophesied about violence in the country and advised worshippers to obtain both the Anointing Water and the Wristband, which he did. On a date in May 2011, water came out of his Wristband unusually like sweat. Not quite sure how to react to the situation, he stayed put in his office until his phone rang and a voice asked him to take one of the vehicles for patrol on one of the major streets. He noticed that as he came out of the office, the sweat on the Wristband stopped. He never knew that at that time, hoodlums had come to plant bombs in the police premises. As soon as he drove out for the patrol, he had a terrible sound of the detonated bomb that brought the entire office down in rubbles. To his surprise, the portion of the office block where he hung the portrait of the man of God and the Anointing Water stood strong and unaffected by the bomb blast. The panel of investigators who had earlier suspected that he had secret knowledge of the blast before it happened, in view of the fact that it was just ten minutes after he left when the blast occurred, became convinced that his safety was the work of God when they saw the Anointing Water and the portrait still hanging safely. Before then, the service provider had no record too of the voice that invited him out of the office. It was the Holy Spirit, they then realised, that took him out of the office and death by that call. Thanking God for His mercy, Mr John Mark remarked that he had become a different person and that his life was no more his. As regards the breakthrough for which he came for the candle light service, Mr John told his listeners that he got it in many areas of his life.\n\nCEASED MENSTRUATION REVIVED AFTER LAYING HANDS\n\nMrs Ogeshi Okeke from Imo State joyfully mounted the podium to tell her listeners that after the hand- laying ceremony of the very day, she went to the ladies to check herself following the sensation she received when Wise Man Racine laid hands on her. She had, since her miscarriage last December, lost her menstruation and was longing for it. In the ladies, she saw that her menstruation had miraculously surfaced and she thanked God most spiritedly for the miracle, reassuring her listeners that everything happen at the opportune time and that nothing is beyond God. It is all praise to God almighty as we watch the miracles which we read in the Bible happening again ceaselessly in our time.\n\nIn full radiance for the festivities of Easter and located on a dais replete with artistic decorations that speak for the season, the choir crooned melodies to put the congregation in mood and spirit for the day’s worship after which Wise Man Christopher mounted the altar to give the message. Describing Easter as a period set aside to commemorate the resurrection of Jesus Christ who paid the supreme sacrifice for the forgiveness of our sins, the wise man added the Lord died, rose and reigns in power for us. Citing Romans 5:6, Wise Man Christopher asserted that Christ’s resurrection is the foundation of our Christian faith. But for His resurrection, he maintained, our faith would have been futile. In his message entitled, ‘He Has Risen’, the wise man maintained that when the eyes of our faith are opened, we see God. We know God’s opinion about ourselves and others. By his rising, death is swallowed up in victory. All our worries and troubles are swallowed up in victory. His death accomplished salvation for mankind. The death of Christ makes it unnecessary for anyone to suffer any affliction. God sees trouble as an opportunity to glorify His name. ‘What is your trouble?’ He asked.\n\nElaborating on specific strands of the wise man’s message, Prophet T. B. Joshua informed the congregation that there was no peace by His chastisement but by His blood shed on the Cross. He advised his listeners to follow Jesus bearing His cross, reproach and patiently submit to all His suffering. When Jesus was suffering, some of His best friends were but spectators and onlookers, the prophet added. Jesus was delivered up to be crucified and at crucifixion, He said, ‘Father, forgive them.’ Using the expression, ‘Father, forgive them’ as his foundation, the prophet urged the congregation to imbibe the virtue of ‘forgiveness’ in their daily living.\n\nTWO MEMBERS OF MY PEOPLE’S FC DOMINATE SOCCER IN EUROPE\n\nThe prophet announced the arrival of two members, Messrs Sani Emmanuel and Onazi Ogenyi of My People’s Football Club from Italy where they had been after signing a contract with Lazio – a renowned football club in Italy – which was clearly impressed with the skill of the duo in the game of football after watching them in course of their trials there. In the league match with Premavera where they took part, the two were very instrumental for the victory of their team as Sani scored the first goal within ten minutes of the first half and the second goal in the second half. The other team was awarded a penalty but they lost it. However, they later scored one goal to make it 2-1. Along the line, Mr Onazi scored the third goal while a teammate scored the last goal with a penalty giving them a 4-1 win over the other team. In the last four matches where the duo featured, they constantly defeated their opponents ignominiously. According to the man of God who foresees a very bright future for the duo in their chosen career, he had decided to imbue them with an international outlook in football by sponsoring them to visit reputable clubs overseas and practice with renowned players to make them develop more confidence in themselves regarding soccer. In this regard, the duo were sponsored to Sweden where they joined Boden BK Football Club. They were also in Switzerland where they equally hobnobbed with Young Boys Club, St Gallens, Basel FC. In the same way, they visited Chelsea Football Club, Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, Panathinaikos FC in Athens and SS Lazio FC in Italy where they signed a contract after trials, in which they impressed their host club. After a month, Mr Onazi was privileged to join the first team and also participated in the match against Napoli FC. The prophet told his listeners that he would not count costs in ensuring that the boys’ full potentials were exploited to make them among the best in the world in the game of football. He added that they had just arrived from Italy to give thanks to God in the Synagogue for their brilliant performances and victories in the matches they played in Italy.\n\nThanking the man of God for his unwavering commitment to their development in football, Mr Sani Emmanuel, who by extraction hails from Edo State, re-echoed the prophet’s promises to see them through to the ‘promised land’ in their chosen career as a father and mentor. He recalled his days in My People’s FC in Lagos when, by the grace of God, he took part in the Under 17 World Cup in 2009 playing for Nigeria. It was there, according to him, that he was honoured with the title, Most Valuable Player (MVP). It is worth recalling that he was the second highest goal scorer in that tournament. Since then, he asserted, the man of God had remained indefatigable in ushering them from one football club to another in Europe to have their skills honed. In the same vein, Onazi Ogenyi, a Nigerian from Benue State, thanked the prophet as the source of the confidence for all their feats and victories in football. By the prophet’s unfathomable magnanimity, he went on, they had visited a catalogue of teams in Europe through which they had the privilege to hobnob with renowned players such as Drogba of Ivory Coast and Peter Croach of Tottenham Hotspur among others. He specially thanked God for His grace on them in their chosen career.\n\nTHE ANOINTING WATER IN THE US\n\nRegarding the new Anointing Water, the prophet intimated that prayer line would hardly be necessary if the Anointing Water were applied as directed. In endorsement of the wish of the congregation to watch the Washington DC edition of the miraculous powers of the Anointing Water, the prophet directed that the video clip be activated. The clip revealed an array of faithful who were gathered in eager anticipation of the Anointing Water about which they had gleaned much from the Emmanuel TV. Many of them said they used to worship with Emmanuel TV before they would go to their original churches of worship. In the activated video clip, they surged forward in turns to receive an administration of the Anointing water after which they thanked God for their immediate healing. Many of them with contrary spirits found themselves writhing on the floor following the spraying of the Anointing Water on them. On deliverance, they would get up and thank God. A lady among them, who confessed she had attempted to commit suicide and was consequently hospitalized, received deliverance after being sprayed with the Anointing Water and testified to her freedom from depression and other ailments after the deliverance. Another woman who complained of stomach pain was also healed with the Anointing Water. The same was true of another lady named Mary whose case was difficulty in walking. According to Mary, for five years she had consulted five doctors but her problem remained intractable until it faced the healing fire of the Anointing Water. Many others were healed from ailments of varied descriptions and all thanked God for the Anointing Water.\n\nFORGIVENESS AS A PANACEA FOR THE PROBLEMS OF IVORY COAST\n\nOn the unbelieving stance of many African leaders, the prophet recalled how the past Ivorian President had responded to his prophecy regarding the recent political turmoil in Ivory Coast, telling the prophet in reaction that, of all the men of God he had consulted, only Prophet T. B. Joshua foresaw the impending crisis in his country.\n\nThe prophet took advantage of this to sound a note of warning to the incumbent president, advising him to embrace the virtue of forgiveness if he wanted to succeed as a ruler in his country. In the prophet’s words, Ouattara will succeed by forgiving and forgetting. He should solicit the support of everybody. Unless he does this, there will be trouble. It is a generational curse and only forgiveness can break it. The prophet saw a few pockets of antagonism in the country continually disturbing the peace and only a general amnesty can undo them.\n\nANOINTING WATER BREAKS THEIR BARRENNESS\n\nMr Ologbenga Folunronsho whose wife had been diagno-, diagno-, diagno-, diagno-, diagnOSED with multiple fibroids which rendered them barren for a long time happily came to the platform accompanied by his wife carrying their baby for a testimony. They had tried many other places for a solution to their barrenness but to no avail before they finally visited The Synagogue Church Of All Nations where their solution had been awaiting them. As soon as the wife received administration of the Anointing Water, she was compelled to make the toilet her home where she discharged the fibroid piecemeal. This over, she embraced her husband in a spousal intimacy and conceived the same month. They came to the church brimful with gratitude to God for their bouncing baby girl. The entire church got up in unison to dance in thankfulness to God for the gift of a baby to the very famous couple. In view of the continuation service scheduled for 10am Monday, the congregation conceded to the grace to bring the service to a close.\n\nAfter the songs of praise and worship by which the day’s service commenced were over, Wise Man Daniel proceeded to give the message entitled, ‘Trusting In Christ’s Suffering’ by which he reminded the congregation that Christ died on the Cross to provide our needs which he said were healing, deliverance, blessing among others. He cited 1st Peter 2:21-24 as his proof text. Dwelling on the significance of Palm Sunday, he averred that that the Lord’s instruction regarding the donkey was characteristically not vague. Jesus is a Man of vision who says what He means and means what He says. His was instruction in boldness, certainty, righteousness and power. His rebuke was for our peace. His death was miserable and His disciples must be ready to bear His cross. By His suffering there is assurance of life for us.\n\nANOINTING WATER STOPS ISSUE OF BLOOD\n\nAfter the prophet’s usual introductory remarks about the new Anointing Water, there was a surge of congregants wishing to testify to the instrumentality of the Anointing Water. The first person to enjoy the opportunity of giving a testimony was Mrs Elizabeth Aghachiebonam of Ebonyi State, though resident in Abuja. Her problem, according to her, was the issue of blood for two years. She recounted the trouble her husband had taken to find a solution for her in hospitals and churches without hitting any success. The problem started as internal heat and generated pain all over her body making her pass through sleepless nights. While people would be sleeping at night, she would see herself restless and reeling in pain. Coming to The SCOAN on the Thursday preceding the Sunday of testimony, she said she received the Anointing Water immediately on arrival and administered it on herself in compliance with the instruction. As soon as she applied it, the bleeding stopped. She happily told the congregation that she had started enjoying her nightly sleep and comfort of body following the staunching of the blood. She seized the opportunity to advise her listeners to have faith in the Lord, their Creator who is always there for them in times of need.\n\nANOINTING WATER OBVIATES OPERATION\n\nThe next testimony was given by the Akhere family. Mrs Akhere had been told by her doctor that she would require operation to deliver her baby because of her tight cervix. She therefore visited The SCOAN to seek the face of the Lord. She received the Anointing Water and administered it on herself in prayer for safe delivery. After this, she delivered her baby safely without operation. They named their baby Harry after Wise Man Harry. They profusely thanked God with whom, they recognized, nothing is impossible.\n\nANOINTING WATER AND GOD’S OMNIPRESENCE\n\nThe omnipresent nature of God was demonstrated with the Anointing Water in many parts of the world. The video clips revealed the work of the Anointing Water in other countries of which Greece was one. The clip showed a woman, Shaze Qualli who for twelve years depended on crutches for movement. The Anointing Water dispelled all the darkness in her and delivered her from all pain and infirmity. Another man who depended on crutches for movement was also delivered in the same way. There were many who, hitherto in the throes of contrary spirits, fell down under the anointing of the Holy Spirit and were delivered with the administration of the Anointing Water.\n\nA similar feat was revealed in Ghana where a woman who had not been able to walk for years was declared free by an evangelist spraying the Anointing Water on her and she responded immediately by standing up to walk. A young man was also freed from evil spirits and he thanked God having been delivered through the medium of the Anointing Water. Mr John, a sergeant in the Ghanaian army, had for five years been incapacitated because of an injury he sustained in an accident. Spraying the new Anointing Water on him, an evangelist declared him free and he resumed walking immediately.\n\nANOINTING WATER RESTORES HEAD TO SHAPE\n\nWhile the congregation was engrossed watching these miracles from other countries, an evangelist in The SCOAN had seen a young man in the church arranged in the prayer line because of a development in his head which made the head assume a very abnormal shape. The evangelist proceeded to spray the new Anointing Water on the head and, soon after, pus began to ooze from the head miraculously. In no time the head regained its normal shape after all the pus had come out. This was possibly the greatest miracle of the day as the evacuation of the pus left no mark or scar on the head after restoring the head to shape.\n\nMARITAL UNDERSTANDING ACHIEVED\n\nThe next was the reconciliation of Mr and Mrs Elizabeth Aghachiebonam as hinted in the previous service. The next paragraph entitled MISUNDERSTANDING WORDS OF PROPHECY was their story in a nutshell at the end of service the week before. But to the glory of God, the couple reappeared on the platform this Sunday to thank God for their successful reconciliation and for the grace of understanding and appreciating each other the more as a couple. The very striking element of the reconciliation was the dream, Stella, the wife had in which she was told by Prophet T. B. Joshua to remove the ring and bangle on her hand. Contrary to her thinking that she never had those ornaments on her body to remove, the prophet proceeded beyond her skin into her bone to dislodge those ornaments which were an attestation to her union with a spiritual husband. The removal of these ornaments by the prophet marked a turning point in her marital relationship with IK, her earthly husband. The prophet once more appeared to her in a second dream and advised her to relate well to her husband and make ‘forgiveness’ a watchword in their marriage as there is no perfect person or relationship on earth. By the time she wanted to react to the prophet in the dream, he had vanished having laid a formidable spiritual foundation for the marriage. In his reaction, Mr Ikechukwu thanked the prophet for the effectual reconciliation. He added that they had been to the Mountain to pray in the effort to restore peace and love to their marriage. He once more thanked God and the man of God for the restored peace in their marriage.\n\nMISUNDERSTANDING WORDS OF PROPHECY\n\nThe next video clip was among other reasons activated to correct the culpable presumptions among the congregants regarding the import of prophecies issued to them. In the said repartee between Wise Man Christopher and Mrs Ezekwelome,the latter corrected the wise man erroneously about her marital status. When Wise Man Christopher cautioned her to be careful about disappointments, the lady misinterpreted the expression and promptly told the wise man that she was already married. Making himself clearer, the wise man told her that he knew that. He was, on the contrary, simply warning her about the possible collapse of the marriage if care was not taken. Luckily for the wise man, her husband was around to add that he had sent her home the previous week because of her perceived misdemeanour. Defending herself on the last score, Mrs Ezekwelolome, a non working housewife, deprecated the repression she suffered in the hands of her husband who additionally habitually made her account for every kobo she received from him. She strongly felt that her views and wishes to engage in some private business deserved consideration by her husband. In his defence, the husband stated that apart from taking full charge of her education, he had sponsored her trips to France, Egypt and the United States of America. Her recent wish to go to Dubai for business in gold would put the entire family at risk apart from rendering him the sole caretaker of the children. Speaking on behalf of the womenfolk, about four women in the congregation expressed support for the husband and praised him for his consideration for the welfare of the entire family while advising the wife to be contented with the contributions of the husband to her well-being. The prophet, while inviting them to a reconciliation meeting, expressed the view that a marriage where both participants saw themselves as equally gifted in sophistication and intelligence and neither was ready to bow to the other was indeed a difficult one to manage but with God all things are possible.\n\nMAN DELIVERED FROM IMPOTENCE\n\nMr Ameni Shabani of Congo DRC mounted the platform to confirm his deliverance from impotence last Sunday during the service. He had lost his wife to a houseboy because of his inability to dose sexual gratification to her. He lost his sexual virility when he was made to drink some concoction and wash himself with the water. He said his wife accused her of not finding time for her but added that he spent all his time looking for money for his wife in order to make the home comfortable. Both his wife and the houseboy took advantage of his loss of virility to redefine their relationship and started a sexual intimacy resulting in the loss of the wife to the houseboy. Mr Shabani added that his eloped wife later told him that only one of the two children they had together was his. It was for that reason he decided to leave both children for her till when he hoped to establish his paternity by DNA. Both ex-wife and houseboy now live together in South Africa. In answering the prophet’s question, Shabani stated that it was painful to lose his wife to a houseboy but in his state of loss of manhood then, there was nothing he could do. He was however happy for his deliverance which has put him in a position to consider getting married again. He expressed the hope of coming to The SCOAN after marriage on ‘a thank you mission’ with his new wife. He thanked God and the man of God for his restoration.\n\nINTREPID JOURNEY TO SEE PROPHET\n\nThe next testimony was given by a young man, Mr Jeff Katanga from Zambia who came all the way from Zambia crossing not less than seven countries in a very long, tortuous and dangerous journey to Nigeria. The young man in question lost both parents recently in quick succession and found himself the caretaker of his siblings. The only hope for him in the present situation when he suddenly became the father of his siblings was Prophet T. B. Joshua. He saw the prophet as the only man who could offer him and his siblings financial help, going by what he had gleaned from Emmanuel TV. It was for that reason that he borrowed money from a widow and travelled from Zambia through Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Sudan, Chad and Cameroon to Nigeria. He particularly had challenges in Sudan which was half way between his country and Nigeria because of the civil war there. He was encouraged in his state of penury and physical exhaustion by the fact that if he could get to the Prophet, his condition would change for the better. He spent a total of thirty days on the way before getting to Nigeria on 19th January 2011. Unlike what many would do, he never wanted to shout to the man of God for help but decided to remain prayerful and fasting till God would reveal him to the prophet. He had decided not to be led by his situation because, as he learnt from Emmanuel TV, in every situation God is saying something. He deliberately took refuge in the vicinity of the church till God would reveal him in his plight to the prophet. Truly, when the prophet became aware of him, he welcomed him with the words, ‘You are in your Father’s house’ and promised him that when he would go back, he would enjoy a flight in contradistinction to the risky manner in which he had travelled to Nigeria. In response to the question on what he would have done supposing he never saw the prophet on arrival, he said he would have nigerianized rather than repeat that ordeal back to Zambia. The man of God praised him for his faith, courage and dogged will to succeed in life assuring him that he could see a bright future for him. The man of God however made it clear that his warm reception of the young man should not serve as an incentive for other young men to embark on such risky journeys. Assuring the congregation of prompt resumption of prophetic worship at 10 am the following day, he piloted the service to a close.\n\nThe prefatory adoration melody over, Prophet T.B. Joshua mounted the altar to minister to the congregation. He assured the assembly that God was with them and that they should be in the attitude of prayer as the message for the service was being delivered, reminding them that the message would deliver them. Soon after, Wise Man Daniel took over the baton to deliver the message. In the same fervour as the prophet, Wise Man Daniel evoked ebullience in the Church, in the presence of the Lord.\n\nIn the words of the Wise Man, the Bible makes us understand that the name, Jesus Christ has authority and power among those committed to His glory. Christ’s duty is to raise us from death and restore the wholeness and fellowship between God and man. Power comes through the Holy Spirit to those who accept Jesus. In His name you can! A Christian, according to the Wise Man, should depend entirely on the power of Christ, if he must overcome satan. Citing Mark 16:15-20, the Wise Man told the Church that the name, Jesus can drive out demons and poison will not have the power to harm believers. Those who depend solely on God’s power show the evidence of this power in them. They are also the people who can move mountains in His name. Citing Mark 16:17, he said the text advises us to kick the devil out of our lives and the lives of others. Ephesians 1:21 says Christ has dominion over all powers and authorities on earth and in Heaven. In His name you can make wonderful things happen!\n\nMounting the altar once more, Prophet T.B. Joshua cited Matthew 9:18-32, where a man who could not talk was brought to Jesus and He cast out the demon (rather than heal the man) and the man spoke. The prophet remarked that there is the spirit of bondage which causes affliction. The sin of the soul is the cause of sickness, poverty and other problems and when you are delivered, you are free and blessed and this is why, he said, everybody needs deliverance. If one is healed without the spirit being delivered, the healing is only momentary as the spirit will cause a relapse of the ailment. To be blessed effectually, you need deliverance because there is a spirit of bondage from which you need deliverance. Deliverance is taking one from the dark kingdom to light. It is making one a channel of light where there is darkness. When your sins are forgiven, you are delivered.\n\nTESTIMONIES RESTORED\n\nThe prophet looked in retrospect at the major events of the previous Sunday service and remarked that man treats but God heals. One of those who received their miraculous healing was,\n\nMr Isiaka Sadik Fache, an ulcer patient from Okene, Kogi State. He got not merely a healing but also a replacement of his tibia. The leg in question (right leg) sustained a fracture and was rotten to the bone as a result of the ulcer that became chronic in defiance of treatment in both hospitals and traditional medical homes for two years. At a stage in the hospital, iron was fixed in the leg but it never gave the relief much sought after. Consequently, both the hospital authorities and his relations considered amputation as wise and inevitable. Fache, however resisted the idea, being used to the miracles relayed on Emmanuel TV. Much against the advice of his people, Fache came to The Synagogue and he was arranged on the prayer line. As soon as the prophet stretched his hand at him and declared him free on the prayer line, the excruciating pain which propelled the ulcer disappeared. He went home and watched the gradual healing of the leg. As he was having a bath at home, he saw that some bone in the affected area fell off. He became afraid that that might be another problem to contend with. Contrary to his fears however, the Lord was doing something about his effectual healing. The Lord was supplying a spare part to replace the damaged bone and in truth, Mr Fache became healed with a new bone. Mr Fache displayed the damaged and rejected bone on a sheet of newspaper as he told his story to the congregation that listened with rapt attention. Today, Mr Fache can contest in a game of 100 metres with anybody!\n\nThe next testimony came from a couple whose male partner received a prophecy in the Church that the wife, like her own mother, had the spirit of lust and that it was a generational curse. As the prophecy was being issued, the man called his wife, Adeola whom the prophecy referred to. On her way to meet her husband in response to the call, she was enmeshed in a web of spiritual frenzy, declaring herself a queen. She told the prophet that she was a queen of the river and that her husband was her wife much to the consternation of all. She vowed never to recognise the authority of her husband as she was a queen. This satanic assertion apparently sent cold shivers down the spine of the husband and the man of God had cause to tell him not to be afraid. Reeling on the floor in the frenzy of the manifestation, she displayed uncanny bravado in utterances and unwillingness to relent. On his part, the husband voiced his refusal to continue with the relationship as he had contracted a new relationship with another lady, who incidentally was present in the Church at the time. The husband accused Adeola of infidelity both outside the matrimonial home and even defiling the marital bed when he travelled. On account of her marital malfeasance, the husband decided to abort the marriage.\n\nThe prophet however, advised him to reconsider his decision because the Adeola who misbehaved as a mermaid in the past was quite different from the delivered Adeola who had become an epitome of love and care for him and the children. He added that the new relationship with the other woman should be discontinued even though it had advanced almost too far to contemplate that idea. The man of God assured the new lady, whom he never allowed to come out, that he would point her way to success and more marital bliss than she could ever get from the present man. On that note, Adeola and her husband were delivered from a marriage of insolence, insubordination and infidelity to the much desired spate of conjugal bliss in a capsule propelled by the trio of prophecy, deliverance and reconciliation.\n\nPicking a strand from the web of interlocking factors for broken homes, the prophet asserted that demons are the causes of broken homes. Accusing individual members of the family of wrongdoing, does not hit the root of the problem. According to him, families should be reconciled and put on the right course. It was the demonic spirit in Adeola that committed the crime and so the person of Adeola should not be punished. Jesus came to restore the relationship and fellowship between God and man.\n\nANOINTING WATER TESTIMONIES\n\nMr and Mrs Paul Udeh gave a startling testimony about The Anointing Water. According to Paul, his case differed from that of others who had low sperm count. In his own case, there was no sperm cell in his semen. That was the reason the couple remained barren for twelve years as no hospital or traditional medicine could provide a solution. He, wise enough, came for The Anointing Water and got one which they applied and soon after, his wife, Nicky became pregnant and bore him a son. By that, he became happy as his penis was no more for urinating alone but also for procreation. They named their miracle son, Treasure. His wife, he added, nursed the pregnancy for nine months without complications. At the time of the testimony, Treasure was only ten months but Nicky was already pregnant again. The bitterness which plagued the family for twelve years has turned to joy, thanks to The Anointing Water. In her testimony, Nicky told the assembly how people had spoken to her in the shadows to void the marriage as she would not bear children. Her patience and prayers have paid off, thanks to The Anointing Water.\n\nThe family of Folunrosho Olugbenga also came out to give their testimony concerning The Anointing Water. For many years, the couple were barren ‘til they collected and applied The Anointing Water. After that, the wife urinated continually because of the diagnosed fibroid. Soon after the fibroid was wiped out, the wife became pregnant and by God’s grace, they hope to be parents soon.\n\nMrs Ann Nwaobi was the next to give her testimony. In her words, she had been married for four years but had had no child because of fibroid. When she got The Anointing Water and applied it as directed, she experienced an unusual flow of the menstrual blood that very month. When she went for test after the menstrual flow, the fibroid had disappeared. She thanked God for the miracle she got through The Anointing Water.\n\nMiss Powerfree Andrew from Cameroon also came to testify to the power of The Anointing Water. She, once a brilliant student, began to wane in academic performance. In one of her examinations, she passed only two courses out of the twelve that she wrote. It was certainly a big issue that needed attention. So, she came to The SCOAN to collect The Anointing Water to remedy the situation. As soon as she applied The Anointing Water as instructed, she noticed a positive change in her memory power. Consequent on her improved academic performance, she got admission in London School of Commerce and also a scholarship thus reaping prosperity from the Prosperity Anointing Water she collected in April.\n\nIn course of t he second servi ce, the prophet, in a vision, saw a man who hid a gun in the Church premises. He called the young man out and he led the prophet to where he had hidden the gun. The prophet recovered the gun and asked the Church to watch out for the man and his mission in the following Sunday’s service adding that the recovered gun would be handed over to the police.\n\nThe service ended on a happy note as all participants were assured of total deliverance from the hands of satan and its agents.\n\nAnother Sunday Service at The Synagogue, Church of All Nations and all we have to say is ‘Thank You Jesus’! From touching family reconciliations, shocking satanic confessions to remarkable healing testimonies, it was yet another action-packed riveting service that proved beyond all doubt that Jesus is alive and His power is still at work today. Full of practical lessons for life, faith-building experiences, words of wisdom and the raw, real power of God, both the thousands of congregants at The SCOAN and the multitudes of viewers on Emmanuel TV would agree unanimously after these extraordinary events that Jesus is truly the same yesterday, today and forever!\n\nIn an enlightening message titled ‘The Name Of Jesus Has Power’ drawn from the scripture in Mark 9 detailing the account of the father of the demon possessed boy and his encounter with Jesus, Prophet T.B. Joshua explained, “There is power in the Name of Jesus indeed, but only among those who are committed to the glory of God.” He spoke of the need to have absolute trust in God, stating that some measure of trust would only enable us to do some, not all. “When we express the necessary trust in Christ Jesus, His duty, I mean, His work is to raise us from death to life and then restore the wholeness and fellowship,” he admonished. Speaking on the purpose of God’s power and its incredible effects on a person’s life, TB Joshua said, “One of the reasons God gives us His power is to confirm that what we are speaking is from Him… Once the supernatural power of God comes upon you, then something is going to happen to you that cannot be explained by the human mind.” It was a powerful message backed up by the prophet’s own extensive experience in the ministry. “When you see a good doctor, he should be able to explain himself when he gets to the laboratory,” he noted.\n\nAfter hearing God’s Word, it was time to move on to a more practical aspect – the ministry of reconciliation. In lieu of the recent confessions of families whose homes have been torn apart due to varying allegations and different situations, yet another touching case was brought to the light. It was that of Mrs Better Keke who had come to The SCOAN with a whole horde of villagers who had been sent to ascertain the truth from God. Before listening to their story, TB Joshua reminded the people of the need not to judge those they were about to hear from but rather learn from them. “Our response to someone who makes a mistake can also be a mistake,” he emphasised.\n\nIt all began, Mrs Keke explained, after the tragic death of a young man in a car accident. “At his funeral, a voice suddenly spoke to me telling me to confess I was the one who killed him,” Keke said. As the strange voice continued to speak to Better over the coming days telling her to confess what she did not do, her musical leader Evan. Elvis Osita confronted her that she had a confession to make, a revelation he said he came to after 30 days of fasting and prayer. As the voice grew within grew stronger, subsequent events led Mrs Keke to publically confess in a church that she was a witch and responsible for countless atrocities in the village, including the accident that killed the young man. In the same vein, she also accused one of her close friends, a teacher by profession, of witchcraft, an event that led to parents pulling children out of her school. In a whirlwind of events, others accused Evan. Elvis of masterminding the boy’s death and being a wizard. The situation had grown so serious that the king of their village in Delta decided to hear God’s opinion and find out who-is-who. Thus the large party had set out to The SCOAN to hear from Prophet TB Joshua the voice of God which would put a rest to the endless rumours and counter-accusations.\n\n“When you look at your family, you have the traces of mental disorder,” the prophet said. Mrs Keke confirmed that one of her aunties was afflicted with a severe mental problem. “The spirit speaking to her is not that of witches or wizards – it is a brain problem. She’s not a witch,” T.B. Joshua declared. “If you ask her, she will tell you she has a chronic headache, and sometimes her eyes will be bringing water,” he prophesied. She confirmed it to be a reality. T.B. Joshua then prayed for her in the power of the Holy Spirit, commanding the spirit of mental disorder to leave. The truth had finally been revealed. As for Evan. Osita, the prophet said he has no trace of evil in him and was innocent of the accusation, but warned him about jumping to conclusions based on feelings and packaging them as spiritual revelations. The teacher who had further been accused, Mrs Gloria Uduarighe, was also vindicated by the man of God, who further assured her that the children would return to her school now the truth had been revealed. “My people of Delta, what they are saying against this lady are pure lies,” he announced. Hon. Alex Izogo, one of the representatives sent by the king, capped off the experience with a final word. “This thing has torn our community apart. But what you have said now is the f"
