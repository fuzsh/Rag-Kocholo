As a result, students looking to the uture will walk, run, fall or crawl into a society on the cusp of massive change. Upon graduation, students will find themselves caught up in a fast-paced, ever-changing world. he Age of Information is in full-swing as technology continues to have more and more influence on the vay society works. Cell phones have become the norm as opposed to an anomaly and palm pilots are 'een more frequently every day. The Internet is not only a useful tool, but an absolute necessity for tudents, who are frequently emailed class updates and sometimes take tests and complete homework ssignments online. As a people, we have more access to international events than ever before, such as the conflict etween the Israelis and the Palestinians or the defeat of Slobodan Milosevic in Kosovo.

S tudent Life 7 FIGHT ON Trojans, young and not so young, gather omecoming is a memorable event for Trojans, both students and alumni. Although many alumni come to other football games, Homecoming gears itself specifically in welcoming back Trojans who have graced the campus in the past. For about a week before the big Homecoming game, the campus was transformed to prepare for the big bash. Bike racks! were removed; tents were set up, areas were roped off, all in preparation for the big day. On Saturday morning, the USC campus took on a large fes­ tive carnival atmosphere. Children were playing football, hop­ ing to be the next Carson Palmer. Cardinal and Gold stream balloons danced around the center of campus. A large computer made of balloons sat in the fountain across from the Student Union, reminding the visitors of the great stride USC has taken technologically. And to keep things safe and fun for all on the crisp autumn day, DPS made its rounds, ensuring that everyone had a good, safe time. Homecoming also gave alumni groups a chance to reunite and sell school spirit. From the Trojan Affiliates selling holiday gifts to the Trojan Club of the San Fernando Valley selling stuffed Traveler toys, all had the same common goal of sharing happy memories and school spirit. But alumni were not the only ones with booths. Both fra­ ternities and sororities spent much time and effort to set up Homecoming booths. Alpha Delta Pi, decked out in Mastercard spoof t-shirts, teamed up with Delta Chi, setting up a BBQ and bar. Samantha Lim, an undeclared freshman and AD Pi said that Homecoming was \"a chance to bond with sisters and meet new people.\" Becky Libby, a broadcast journalism sophomore and AD Pi agreed. \"It's great getting to experience USC's awesome tradi­ tion of homecoming.\" Campus organizations also added to the festive mood. USC Pepsters, an alumni-sponsored group that serve as university ambassadors, held a booth dedicated to the entire Trojan fam­ ily. Brooke Hardy, a sophomore majoring in communication, said that the booth was mainly for the young kids, full of face painting, arts and crafts, and other fun activities. Andrew Compton, a sophomore majoring in public policy, and Ashley Mawhorter, a senior majoring in business, made sure that the 8 Student Life @ USC kids who came to the booth did not leave without paint on their faces or cookies and candy in their hands. Overall, only happy faces populated the campus before the big Homecoming game. It was a great time to reminisce with old friends and make new ones. No matter if the fans were eight or 80, everyone was there to cheer the football team and to have fun. Even despite the loss by the football team, the day itself will be remembered as enjoyable, as all Homecoming days are. ~to1<y Ay ~ete1< #ol/e1< supporters cheer on the Spirit of Troy as they make their way to the Coliseum.

This road trip away from campus is the greatest tradition USC has and as students left the USC area, it quickly became a ghost town. Trojans utilized a variety of means for transportation to northern California - cars, airplanes, trains, and even motorhomes. At the end of the six-hour drive people found lodging with family, friends, or at some hotel nearby the Fisherman's Wharf. Some bay area Trojans decided to visit and share their home with friends from school. Most students arrived Friday night and San Francisco bars and nightclubs saw an influx of Trojans. Other students de­ cided to have a nice quiet night on the town, shopping and en­ joying some of the restaurants. Saturday was the big day for the Trojans. Students who did not attend the game watched from a sports bar or decided to explore the scenic bay area. The Haight and Ashbury district, Pier 39, Lombard Street, and the Golden Gate Bridge were places where many Trojans crossed paths. \"I like the fact that I walked through the streets of San Fran­ cisco, a place I have never been to, and see all these people I know from school, \" said Jon J uffe, an undeclared freshmen. Saturday afternoon's football game against Stanford was an opportunity for USC to post its first conference win. The crowd went through a roller coaster of emotions but remained spirited throughout. The Trojans led by a score of 30-20 with only a few minutes remaining. However Stanford rallied and were victori­ ous in the end 32-30. Although the loss was sad, it did not dampen students' spirits. The culmination of the weekend was Saturday night, when students let loose and spent time in a completely different set­ ting away from school. The relief of pressure from school is another reason the annual trip is such a popular event. People go not just to watch the game, but to get away. Students were al­ most guaranteed a good time. Some Trojans enjoyed a healthy dose of San Francisco nightlife, electing to enjoy the party scene. Jessica Pishney, a sophomore majoring in social psychol­ ogy said, \"I not only saw San Francisco but I traveled to Sacra­ mento with friends . I like northern California, it is a good break from my home on the east coast and from southern California.\" The ride home on Sunday was long and tiring. Students were fatigued from the game and had to return to campus to get ready for classes on Monday. But in the end it was worthwhile to make the long trip. Calvin Ng, a junior majoring in international relations, summed up the weekend, \"I had fun, I can't wait until next year.\" ~to1<y Ay ,Uic4aet ~alki1<ei U SC Yell Leaders get pumped up for their rally at the Hyatt Regency in San Francisco. • Trojans Head North 11 WEEK Excitement and blood pressure built as the battle drew near n honor of the long-standing rivalry between USC and UCLA, Trojans again rallied up a little school spirit and a lot of Bruin distain for this year's Troy Week. Students came out of the dorms, off of 28th Street and into Hahn Plaza for a week of concerts, competitions, prizes, movies, inter­ national food, and dancing to pump up Trojans before the big game on November 18. But before the football players ever stepped onto the field, other competitions were going on involving sister teams and organizations from both universities. The schools' newspaper staffs and marching band members played football blood bowls of their own. However, the rivalry was extremely strong and destructive this year when more than $20,000 worth of band equipment was taken from UCLA's equipment truck during a flag football game the weekend before the big game. The equip­ ment was found the next day in the yard of an apartment com­ plex near 28th Street and Orchard Avenue. \"I think pranks are great if they don't hurt or harm any­ body,\" Cynthia Cherrey, USC assistant vice president of Stu­ dent Affairs told the Daily Trojan. \"This was harmful to the UCLA band. This whole thing is a poor reflection on our uni­ versity.\" Pranks and other traditions had always marked the week before the game, but one tradition that Student Senate banned in 1997 has never been witnessed by current USC students, not even this year's graduating senior class. UCLA still has the \"Burning of the Trojan Horse,\" but USC ended the annual \"Burning of the Bruin\" when the Black Student Union com­ mented that the tradition resembled a lynching and was offen­ sive to African-Americans. Though the actual burning of the Bruin is unlikely to ever return, there is the possibility that a bonfire may take its place in the future. One tradition that has stood the test of time is the guarding of Tommy Trojan by the Trojan Knights. The members of this male spirit organization spend each night of Troy Week pro­ tecting Tommy from being splattered by coats of blue and yel­ low paint. On the last night of the week, Save Tommy Nite, more students join the Knights in Hahn Plaza for carnival ac­ tivities and performances. This year's Save Tommy Nite fea­ tured performances by the Sirens, the SoCal Vocals, the Fly Girls dance team and three student bands: Goba Listik, Listen, and Dominion Mandate. Each building government held a booth with dart games, a ball toss, popcorn, and churros. There was also an In-N-Out Burger trailer, rock climbing, and bounce houses. The night ended with USCandalicious, a dance party in 1 2 Student Life @ USC Topping Student Center sponsored by Program Board. Other activities included a spirit rally on Thursday followed by an Eve 6 concert. The band was supposed to have played for Homecoming, but had to reschedule due to rain. Students were able to see a screening of The Matrix in Hahn Plaza on Monday night, but abnormally cold southern California temperatures kept most students at home inside. Jason Alexander, who played George Costanza on \"Seinfeld,\" spoke to a full house at Bovard Auditorium on Tuesday, showing off his acting talents and his ability to play the piano, among other things. The week of abounding Trojan Pride paid off in the end.

LOOKING Students make ready for life after college W ide-eyed freshmen flooded across Trousdale Parkway, cruising from table to table, grabbing the assortment of free pens, key chains, and toys. Ambitious seniors looked to catch the eye of a potential employer, ready and eager to head off into the working world. The middle of campus was completely overrun with students and business representatives. It was the scene of the fall career fair. The fair, which is staged by the Career Planning and Place­ ment Center, is a day when over 190 companies invade the cam­ pus hoping to recruit USC students. It is a chance for students to meet with various companies and gather information. about possible career paths. \"I wanted to see what opportunities were available to me,\" naidAngelo DeSantis, a senior international relations major, who was among the many eager students. \"I was checking out the field,\" he said. The event is held each semester, and attracts over 2,000 un­ dergraduate and graduate students from all majors and disci- plines. With various companies, including some large consult­ ing firms, new dot-corns, and various advertising and public re­ lations companies, there is bound to be something of interest for everyone. \"We really try to pull in all kinds of different companies, not just engineering and business, but also non-profit, educational, and the entertainment industry who are looking for qualified people,\" said Ann Vedro, the Career Planning and Placement Center's assistant director of employee relations. For students who wanted to live out their X-files fantasies, the FBI and CIA were seeking new agents to recruit during the fair. The career fair is actually one of the many components of the Career Planning and Placement Center. Other programs that help students find their dream jobs include an online campus­ recruiting program, career counseling sessions, and a library of career guidance literature. Vedro said the purpose of the career fair component is \"to bridge the gap for students between their majors, being in school and working. And one of the stepping stones to that is to bring the folks here who can hire and tell students about the jobs.\" Many of the larger academic units on campus, such as busi­ ness and engineering, also hold separate job fairs in addition to the larger, general one. These larger fairs cater more to special­ ized fields of study. Students meet company representatives and build a base for a possible job. When the career fair day rolls around, students scramble to get their resumes spell checked, suits dry-cleaned, shoes shined, and last minute jitters out of their systems before embarking on a few hours that could affect the rest of their lives. For some this is a nerve-racking and anxious day, but for DeSantis it is a part of the college experience. \"It's good practice for interviews, fact-finding for jobs, and making the first impression. I just treat it like a big cocktail party, so there's no pressure or anything.\" Trojans Looking Beyond 1 5 WELCOME TO THE ' Trojan Island Adventure finds Catalina ick through tide pools and squish through mud as your guides help you find unique island inhabitants, the website said. You may ask yourself, \"Is this an ad for Survivor?\" No, but read on. Study the constellations, conduct a bioluminescence survey, make hot fudge sundaes, and attend a pirate party. These are just some of the activities that alumni and their families can participate in when they attend Trojan Island Adventure at Catalina, USC's new family summer science camp. The camp, which was begun this past summer, was arranged through the efforts of the USC Alumni Association and the USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental studies. The Alumni Asso­ ciation has held a family camp called \"SCAMP\" for the past few years in Fresno's Wonder Valley. The Wrigley Institute be­ gan a camp last summ~r called USC Family Science Camp on Catalina Island. \"The only camp held this year was the Trojan Island Ad­ venture, and that replaced both previous camps,\" said Steve Adcook, senior business officer. Trojan Island activities included snorkeling, kayaking, arts and crafts, nature walks, body surfing, a horse show, touch tanks, science lectures, plankton labs, a Buccaneer Bash, and special evening events for adults only. Everyone, even non-alumni, was welcome to attend the camp. Though the camp is primarily for alumni, Adcook said, and it was created as a way to reach the families of alumni, \"We consider each request for information or registration. There is no policy that excludes a non-alumnus.\" Close to 200 people attended the camp, said Adcook. There were three week long sessions and one mini-week that were all held in August. The price included transportation to and from the island, dormitory accommodations, meals, transportation around the island, and kayak, wetsuit, and all other equipment usage. In order to help the camp run smoothly, the directors in­ vited USC students to apply as counselors for a session or two. \"I saw an ad in the Daily Trojan that was very appealing. The ad included staying at Catalina and working with kids, which really caught my eye,\" said counselor Jed David, a sophomore majoring in public policy and management. \"I learned how ex­ hausting it could be to be a counselor, but at the same time ex- 1 6 Student Life @ USC tremely fun and rewarding.\" David also discovered what it feels to be a kid again. \"The best part of the experience was spending time with the kids.

II GUIDES AROUND THE - - un1vers1 New signs and a new way to enter campus U pperclassmen realize that freshmen receive the most benefit from two very recent additions to our constantly changing campus. The university has installed a main entrance into the Univer­ sity Park Campus and added new signs on the outside of each university building. The addi­ tions help all visitors, students, and staff through our enormous campus, but especially those who have never lived or worked on the campus before - freshmen. On the first day of school everyone is running around cam­ pus hurrying to avoid tardiness. These new red, gold, and silver signs display the university logo, state the building's full name, street address, and abbreviation. These signs provide a sleek new look to campus, and offer a unifying visual theme to all buildings - from the older science and engineering buildings to the newest additions on campus. The abbreviation aspect is extremely useful, as students no longer have to worry about finding out what VKC and GFS ~ludd 1--:l a II actually stand for, they can just look for the three-letter designa­ tion code on the sign. This is especially useful for freshmen who don't know what some building abbreviations represent. \"Finally I can make my first class of the semester,\" said Jonathan Alcantar, a junior majoring in Cinema-Television. The second addition that drew students' attention was the new main entrance to campus. The gate is located near the cor­ ner of Figueroa and Exposition Blvd. This beautiful entranceway was designed to enhance the USC experience for visitors. Doug Moody, a sophomore majoring in business said, \"I think that it is only appropriate that a university as picturesque as ours has an entrance to parallel its beauty.\" The entrance was constructed during the 2000 spring and summer semesters. As people drive through the entrance, they are met by a circular bed of red and gold flowers. Farther on, they are greeted by two black metal gates and a causeway of red brick. The attendant booth lights up the surrounding area and the sidewalks are lined with trees and small, narrow pools of water. The path continues on toward the Alumni House. It seems fitting that the new gate leads directly to that particular build­ ing, since USC's alumni are so involved with the inner work­ ings of the university. The new gate is more expansive than the other gates around campus. It is both regal and imposing, as opposed to the other gates, which were built primarily for functionality. Since USC was recently designated \"College of the Year\" by Time maga­ zine, it is only appropriate that the campus beauty be enhanced by the new entrance. \"The campus really looks classier with the new gate,\" said Ericka Menick, the customer service representative at Fluor Tower. Guides Around the University 19 PRESENTS Presidential Hopeful and Presidential Parent T he Republican Party came to the university in full force in March of 2000 with lectures by Senator John McCain (R-Arizona) and former President George Bush. McCain stopped by USC on his campaign College Tour with CNBC's political television program \"Hardball.\" Bush's speech was given as one of the President Sample's Distinguished Lecture Series. Though McCain eventually lost the GOP presidential nomi­ nation to Texas governor George W. Bush, McCain's interview with the show's host Chris Matthews showed that the former candidate's main concerns were in bringing about party reform and inspiring young voters to become involved in politics. \"The whole reason why I'm running for President of the United States is to connect young people again to their govern­ ment,\" McCain said. He said that he wanted to energize the younger generation and to get them \"involved in the political process so that they feel they have a stake in it.\" McCain's solution for the unmotivated, apathetic youth was to reform the Republican Party and reform politics in general. He pointed to the fact that the GOP has lost the last two presi­ dential and congressional elections. McCain theorized that this might be because many people have begun to view the GOP as an \"exclusionary\" party, thus reform is the only way out of the cycle. George Bush Sr., during his speech in Bovard, also spoke to the audience about staying involved in politics. He went on to praise USC students for their current involvement in the com­ munity by mentioning the recent Time magazine award, (USC, College of the Year). He emphasized the importance of being a part of the extremely prosperous Pacific Rim and staying in­ volved with world politics. \"You don't have to be President to help build a better future. You don't have to be the First Lady to help lift the lives of oth­ ers. All you have to do is care, roll up your sleeves, get off the sidelines and claim one of society's problems as your own,\" Bush said. Bush commented on southern California's invaluable loca­ tion along the Pacific Rim. After leaving the presidency, Bush made frequent visits to Asia. He observed China's booming economy and its growing freedom. He said he encourages trade with China and other Pacific Rim countries. Upon visiting Japan, Bush applauded the government's ef­ forts to improve the economy, 2 0 Student Life @ USC Bush also stopped in Korea on his tour of Asia. He said the United States could use the Korean work ethic as an example, but that our government \"must not listen when the selfish sirens (in Asia) call for isolation and protection.\" A whole range of students, not only those involved in poli­ tics, came to hear what these Republican representatives had to offer for the future. \"I usually try to attend all the President's Distinguished Lec­ tures because it's a chance to hear scholars and their perspec­ tive firsthand,\" Everett Weiss, a senior majoring in psychobiol­ ogy, told the Daily Trojan.

CHOWING DOWN AT New opportunities for meals and snacks T he times are changing and so are the eating possibilities at USC. To cater to the diversity of students and their tastes, there were a few new additions at various locations on campus with the Galen Center, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, and the new Popovich Cyber Cafe. The Galen Center opened its doors last year to cater to the needs of university athletes. It is located west of Heritage Hall, behind the intramural field. During the afternoon, it is open to the campus community with a variety of foods ranging from daily specials, to salads, desserts and sodas. The dining area features two big screen TV's and multiple smaller screens to enhance the sporty ambience. It is also a perfect place to \"tail­ gate\" before USC home football games, and many students take advantage of its easy access before games to do just that. Krispy Kreme doughnuts are delivered fresh each day and offer a variety of choices, including weekly specials. Often the Krispy Kreme eatery is shut down by noon, since the doughnuts are so popular and sell out quickly. Omar Sosa, a senior majoring in filmic writing, said \"I sim­ ply can't face a morning without having a doughnut and some coffee. Krispy Kreme's are great.\" The Cyber Cafe is located inside the recently opened Popovich Hall and offers a variety of selections including Starbucks coffee, Betty Crocker pastries, Colombo yogurt, fresh sandwiches, sodas, chips and many different specials. The cafe is set up so students can do homework, have a bite to eat, or simply relax with some friends. Students can sit indoors or out­ side on the patio in this small, cozy atmosphere. Located near the new Gate 2 entrance, it also provides a place for business students to grab a soda or a snack. The next addition will be a dining hall inside the Interna­ tionally-themed Residential College Hall currently under con­ struction in the space previously designated as Parkside Apart­ ments. Through different surveys and focus groups, Hospitality Ser­ vices makes recommendations on behalf of the students to the Advisory Committee including the Board of Trustees to advo­ cate new venues on campus. A chain known as Fatburger recently opened a location nearby campus. Situated near the Fraternity Row, it adds to the wide selection of fast food offered on Figueroa Boulevard. Calvin Ng, a junior majoring in International Relations, said \"I was so stoked when Fatburger came to Figueroa. It gives me a new choice instead of pasta and salads. Sure, I love orange chicken and rice, but nothing beats a Fatburger!\" Fatburger was constructed during the summer, and opened during Lhe first week of classes. It immediately became a staple of the Trojan diet and yet another hangout for USC students. ~to1ay Ay 1is. 'I-Joo Chowing Down at Hot Spo ts 2 J TRACK AWAITS - Ill Fans get a view from on high while athletes share luxury T he groundbreaking ceremony for the new Loker Track Stadium took place last June 21 at Cromwell Field. In attendance was Katherine B. Loker, who was honored for her $2 million gift, the largest donation ever to the athletic department by a single person, which will make construction of the stadium a possibility. \"Our ambition is always to be the best athletically, as well as academically,\" said President Steven Sample. \"That requires that we have top-flight athletic facilities. If we want our ath­ letes to be competitive at the highest level, we owe them the resources to achieve that level of athletic excellence. This new facility will go a long way toward reaching that goal.\" Soon men in yellow hard hats showed up on site with their tools and cranes to improve the track. In the past, the track had two entrances on the east and west sides. On the west side of the track, there was an area that consisted of a few benches for sit­ ups, push-ups, or weight lifting, as well as a few pull-up bars. Many athletes came onto the track either before or after going to the Lyon Center to do some running and conditioning. It was common to see people do pull-ups and stretches in that area and then proceed to run laps on the track. The new stadium will provide new features beneficial to athletes, coaches and fans. It has offices, locker rooms, and a team meeting area for athletes and coaches. There is also a gal­ lery for the top rated track team to display its awards and memo­ rabilia. In addition, the new bleacher system above these facili­ ties allows up to 3,000 spectators to enjoy track meets in com­ fort. Fittingly, the facility is being built during USC track and field's 100th anniversary - the perfect tribute to a heritage that includes 28 NCAA team championships, 118 individual titles, 40 Olympic gold medals and 61 world records. Joe King, a junior majoring in petroleum engineering said, \"I think it's a good idea that they're putting more stands in be­ cause there's not enough seating on the track. As it is, the seat­ ing is piddly and I would really like to go watch the team. And as good as the track team is, they deserve more recognition be­ cause they don't get enough in Heritage Hall.\" The idea of the Loker Track Stadium originated with the Athletic Department. Track members complained about the in- 2 4 Student Life @ USC adequacies of their facility as compared to other major univer­ sities. In such a productive year, when the university is being improved in many ways, the Athletic Department decided that the aged track needed some retrofitting. The new Loker Sta­ dium makes full use of the space that once was used for a few pull-ups and seated only the most devoted fans. With these fa­ cilities up and running in the early spring of 2000, the hope is that the track and field team will rise to new heights with the help of Trojan fans in the stands to cheer them on. ,tot&IJ &IJ ~4fft.e, L4fft.

RUSH HOUR I Students line up to join the ranks T here are several aspects of college life that students look forward to during the summer months, athletics, academics, and, of course, the social interaction. For freshmen, one of the biggest issues is making new friends. At many universities, students particularly freshmen, decide to become part of the Greek system primarily to meet new people. In deciding which fraternity or sorority to join, students go through a selection process known as \"Rush.\" Rush is a week-long recruitment process during which cur­ rent fraternity and sorority members, called \"actives,\" meet po­ tential members. These new members, called \"rushees,\" meet actives as they attend various events held in the fraternity or sorority houses - often including house tours, barbeques, sym­ posiums, and information forums. During these events, they get to know the house history, what philanthropy the house is in­ volved in, the social events, and other activities they will be · able to participate in. \"It's a great chance to meet people,\" said Melissa Sodetani, an active of Alpha Delta Pi. \"Rush is a good way to see where you want to spend the rest of your college years.\" Joining a fraternity or sorority is a life decision. Rather than doing a formal interview with each person, Rush is a chance for actives and rushees to get to know one another in a more re­ laxed atmosphere. \"It's a chance to know what the person is really like, instead of them telling you what you think you want to hear,\" said War­ ren Pederbone, an active of Sigma Alpha Epsilon. \"Your whole life can't be an interview.\" The Rush process concludes with the fraternity and sorority extending an invitation to join, called a bid, to the rushee. If the rushee accepts the bid, they are then admitted into Lhe fraternity or sorority of their choice as a new member. \"It is important that the rushees make the right decision when choosing which house to join,\" says Brooke Siemson, Rush Chair for Gamma Phi Beta. \"That is where all of their time will be invested.\" \"I think that Rush is good because it's a great way to meet people,\" said. Trevor Thompson, a recent Sigma Chi pledge. \"When I came to school, I wasn't planning on joining a frater­ nity, but once I went through Rush, I totally changed my mind.\" \"It's a great opportunity not only to meet different people, but also to experience different cultures,\" said Danny Bravo, an active of Lambda Chi Alpha. Greek brotherhood and sisterhood is based on the principle of a supporting network for college men and women. It is an investment many college students make not only to ensure an exciting college social life but, said Sodetani, also \"for the unity and lifelong friendships.\" Rush Hour Report 2 7 BUYS THE - 1sson Birnkrant? Parkside? Why not the Radisson? C oming off of a year when it was touted as \"College of the Year,\" USC expanded its sphere of influence in the surrounding neighborhood with the purchase of the University Village shop­ ping center and then the Radisson Hotel. The university purchased the hotel during the summer of 2000. In recent years, USC had contracted with the Radisson to rent several floors to freshmen due to limited housing space on campus. By acquiring the hotel property, the university completed its ownership of the land between Figueroa and Jefferson, which includes an overflow parking lot, a Sizzler restau­ rant, and several administrative offices. When asked why the purchase was made, Phil Chairamonte, the associate vice president of Auxiliary Ser­ vices said, \"to bring our guests high quality residential ser­ vices.\" Given its close proximity to the campus, the pur­ chase of the Radisson was an opportunity to meet the university's future needs for conferencing and housing of important visitors. Currently the building is slated to continue to operate as a hotel. There are no plans to tear it down or convert it into a dormitory facility. Jon Messenger, a senior majoring in public relations, said, \"I'd like to see the Radisson converted into a parking lot. There isn't enough parking around campus right now, and the parking that is around here is too expensive.\" \"We're just going to leave it as the Radisson Hotel for now,\" President Steven Sample said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. He continued to elaborate, saying that such purchases of land would help put USC in a position to com­ pete with other top campuses and would provide opportu­ nities for long term commercial and academic development. Despite being a very large university, USC has a limited amount of land area, especially relative to other college cam­ puses such as Stanford and UC Berkeley. Consequently, there are few options when it comes to expanding. The pur­ chase of the University Village and the Radisson Hotel will allow for quicker and easier expansion of facilities. Chairamonte also said there are plans for improvements to the restaurant facilities near the Radisson. The goal is to 2 8 Student Life @ USC have a USC ambience and an atmosphere similar to Julie's Res­ taurant, for many years a popular eatery frequented by Trojans. In the near future, we may see the Radisson property be­ come an integral part of the University Park campus, but until then it will be the hotel across the street where the university houses freshmen who cannot be accommodated by the standard housing facilities.

WIRED FOR con We've got your hookup M any upperclassmen enjoy living off campus. It gives them more independence and allows more freedom to study and socialize. However, one major drawback for living off campus in earlier years was the absence of individual phone lines and Ethernet lines. All of that changed at the beginning of the fall semester when the Housing department installed new phone lines and Ethernet lines in all university housing. Over the summer, the Housing department began the pro­ cess of line installation. Chad Kennedy, a sophomore majoring in cinema-television noted, \"The good thing about Ethernet in off-campus housing is that you don't feel so disconnected from the school.\" It's safe to say that many fellow students agree with his sentiments. With Ethernet line capability, students spend less time wait­ ing and more time surfing the Web. Plus, it does not tie up the phone line, which sometimes results in missed phone calls and potential arguments between roommates. The installation pro­ cess was a bit slow, but it's understandable considering the mag­ nitude of the job. Students were very pleased to enjoy this new connectivity. Students also received another surprise on move-in day with the addition of Direct TV. Instead of the limited channels of Media One, those living in university housing are now able to watch such offerings as the Travel Channel, the Independent Film Channel, and many international stations. \"More diverse programming makes me a better rounded and complete person,\" said Grant Blaylock, a junior majoring in cin­ ema-television. Along with these new additions, residents can still keep in touch with the thrilling adventures of Crocodile Hunter and the exciting competitions in Iron Chef Robert Geach, an exchange student from the United King­ dom noted, \"I am learning so much about American culture with Direct TV. There are a few differences in humor, sports, and presentation of certain shows, but deep down it shows how much we are all alike.\" So even the new Direct TV system echoes the proud diversity of USC by allowing students to access a broader range of programming. Overall, these improvements provide a better atmosphere for both study and relaxation. The Ethernet allows students to exchange ideas quickly, while the new Direct TV is a new source of entertainment. It is just one step of many that the Housing department has taken to make life in the dorms, apartments, and residence halls more enjoyable for everyone. ~tO►IJ AIJ ~ete► /lo/le► Wired for Success J 1 CUTE AND Trojans find homes for pound puppies I n the unforgiving urban landscape that is south central Los Angeles, stray canines and felines have a very small chance of survival. Fortunately, a group of dedicated and caring students, faculty, and staff have made it their mission to care for the stray animals in the USC community. Members work to rescue, nurse, and ultimately find loving homes for the stray dogs and cats who find their way onto the campus. The student organization, known as SC PAW (People for Animal Welfare), was founded in the fall of 1996 by graduate students Theresa Allen (sociology) and Viktoria Stamison (political sci­ ence). The organization currently includes 20 students, faculty, staff, and alumni volunteers. Since pets ( other than the swimming variety) are not allowed of students, faculty and staff reflect the benevolent spirit of the in University housing, families and other volunteers in the area university. While working to make the world a better place for offer to take the stray dogs and cats in on a temporary basis stray animals who might otherwise have no chance of survival, until fulltime care can be found.

Funding is raised from donors who sponsor the pets online ,to►y &v 1UA►h 1JAk LoKJKJet (http://www-scf.usc.edu/-animal). The university has a grand history of taking care of stray animals, dating back to 1946 when a stray dog was adopted by a Trojan Knight and brought to campus. Nicknamed George Tirebiter for his passion for chasing cars down Trousdale, a sweater was made for him with the words \"Southern Califor­ nia\" on the back, and he soon became the campus mascot. Tro­ jans today would not know the great story of George Tirebiter if it weren't for the kindness and generosity of the Trojan animal lover. Theresa Allen, co-founder and president of SC PAW, points out that times and attitudes have changed since the days of George Tirebiter. \"The school looks at animals on the campus in a much different light nowadays. Dogs are often seen as threat­ ening and bothersome,\" said Allen. \"Many of the dogs we get are pit bulls or pit mixes, so they aren't offered the empathy and regard that a dog may have had in the 40's.\" Currently, the De­ partment for Public Safety retains the animals and eventually turns them over to Los Angeles Animal Control. SC PAW is in the process of forming a partnership with DPS to take better care of the strays found on campus. Through the efforts of these hardworking members of the university community, over 300 dogs and 50 cats have been saved over the past four years.

Started in Asia, this exciting mode of transportation has gradually made its way into everyday use and has become a full-fledged fad. People from all walks of life, from little kids on the playground to big kids on campus have given in to the razor craze. Jesse Vigil, a sophomore majoring in Cinema-Production, hides, it can pose a problem,\" said Department of Public Safety gushed about his Razor. \"I saw it last year at the Santa Monica Deputy Chief Bob Taylor. \"This is especially true for pedestri­ Pier.

But \"Whenever you add another vehicle into the mix of pedes- what is a Trojan to do? Currently DPS patrols the center of cam­ trians, bicycles, rollerblades, skateboards, carts and other ve- pus from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., politely asking students to walk their bikes, scooters, skateboards, etc. Lee Sapaden, a junior theatre major, appreciates the DPS ban. \"I know some people think it's a pain to get off the bikes and scooters and walk, but it's in the best interest of all of us. The center of campus is so crowded during lunchtime, and it would be a lot more dangerous if people rode their bikes during this time. We should all pay attention when DPS officers say 'Walk Your Bike!\"' This brings up the idea of campus courtesy. Nearly every­ one has seen an accident where a biker slams into a pedestrian. A few choice words are exchanged and each party moves on his or her way. Mike Evans, a senior computer science major, gives advice concerning the ongoing battle between the two warring factions. \"If you're walking and a bike is coming toward you, keep walk­ ing! We bikers have already planned a path around you, and if you move you'll screw it up.\" The hustle and bustle of students is yet another aspect that adds to the beauty of the USC campus. We still need to cross campus to get to class. The only thing that has changed is the mode of transportation we choose to get to our destination. No matter how each decides to get to class, everyone shares the same goal - to get there on time. Unsafe at any Speed J 5 MAKING THE ARTS A collection of creativity in word and image P alaver. \"What is Palaver?\" you might ask. Thumbing through a dictionary, you would come across a definition much like this one: verb fi 1. to talk much and idly; noun fi 1. empty talk, especially that intended to flatter or deceive 2. a profuse parley; synonym fi see babble. In 1998, seven individuals took this definition and cre­ ated something new: Palaver, the only literary magazine published at the university. Featured within its pages are works of short fiction, poetry, and other creative enterprises like art and photography. The vision behind Palaver was to provide an outlet for creative expression and to open the doors of communica­ tion between students and faculty so there can be a mutual exchange and appreciation of creative work, wrote Lili Loofbourow, one of Palaver's founders. True to its name in certain respects, Palaver started with talk, though certainly not idle chatter. Loofbourow, a senior majoring in psychobiology, music, and English, re­ called, \"If you want to trace it back to its roots, Palaver started in room 335 in Marks Hall, freshman year, when Amy Boyle, Julie Chan, and I were talking about how there was no literary magazine on campus.\" From this talk came the eventual birth of Palaver, headed into its third year in 2000 with two editions under its belt. Palaver opens its submission boxes on a yearly basis to students and faculty of all disciplines. Palaver boxes are sprinkled throughout the campus so people may drop off their work completely anonymously. The staff, comprised of students with varied majors, works year round to promote, fundraise, collect, select, and finally to arrange the collection of \"reverberating ideas\" of the college community into a slim volume of 72 bound pages. In April and May, Palaver is distributed on campus and finds its way into the hands, thoughts and conversa­ tions of the community. Loofbourow explained that Palaver has been aided by a strong faculty backing. She said, \"My hope is that Palaver will become a permanent aspect of university life and that this forum for student expression will remain open after the founders graduate. Our goal is to make a signifi­ cant and lasting contribution to the university community. 3 6 Student Life @ USC Palaver staff member Nick Sowers, a third-year architec­ ture major said, \"Palaver is a wonderful tool for the student body to display their collective bodies of creative work. I strongly believe that the exchange of ideas at the college level is crucial in our lives. This place is where we learn to think on a global level, where we make connections that last throughout our lives, and where we begin to understand the creative process that leads to social change. I think all of these things start with a simple circulation of creative thoughts and makings. Palaver is about the circulation of ideas that breeds creation.\" ~tO►tJ Ay ,/1tice Lieu P alaver's simple yet elegant cover graces the campus with writings by students.

You see, he's a bit ... well goofy! · TO BE OR NOT TO ... Actors take center stage N early every aspiring actor imagines the day when he or she will pick up an Oscar. But, before those studying acting at USC can write their acceptance speeches, they must take the first steps by working on productions put on by the School of Theatre. Most students do not realize the degree of difficulty in staging a full-scale production. There is more than simply memorizing lines and cues; it is an ongoing process of research and emotional discovery. The first step in the production process is the audition. Doz­ ens of actors line up with a resume and a headshot in hand, rehearsing their monologues before the big audition. David Clark Smith, a sophomore majoring in theatre, said, \"It's a valuable experience and imperative to our future success as actors. Leaming to audition well is equivalent to having a good job interview.\" After seeing numerous actors in the open audition, the di­ rector then cuts the field to those he thinks have the talent and potential to take part in the play. Those chosen are then called back to read for specific parts. \"I think that the callback audition is even more difficult than the open audition,\" said Lee Sapaden, a junior majoring in the­ atre. \"For open auditions you have time to prepare and rehearse your monologue, but for these callbacks, you have very little time to prepare. You must rely on your talent and instinct to take you through the callback process.\" After the director has seen and heard all the actors read for certain parts, he makes the final decision and casts the play. For those who are cut at this late stage, they can be comforted by the fact that the director thought they had enough talent to be worthy of a callback. After the cast list is set, the actors begin to work. For weeks, the actors work fours hours a night and up to six hours on week­ ends. The designers and crew are busy with lights, costumes, and set construction. The weekend before the play opens, the entire cast and crew rehearse the dreaded \"10 of 12's.\" Every­ one works from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. During this time, every minute detail is rehearsed - everything from setting light cues to timing set changes. Everyone is stressed and exhausted, but they know this is part of the job. Finally, opening night arrives. Adrenaline rushes. Ulcers form. People smoke nervously in the back. \"The only way I can describe opening night is, it's magic,\" gushes Mona Chaterjee, a sophomore theatre major. \"For weeks we research, memorize, and rehearse. We form a special bond with each other because we are reaching for the same goal - a great performance. The moment I'm on stage, all my worries disappear. It's simply magical.\" As the play comes to an end, the actors appear on stage and receive the applause at curtain call. This is the climax of their many hours of work. The play process is a lengthy learning ex­ perience for actors. It teaches them the tools they'll need for the future careers. The theatre education they receive will no doubt lead to great success later in life. ~tOf&IJ ~IJ -Pete,. /lol/e1< To Be or Not to ... Lin e??

It connects students with men­ tors who can guide them through tough career and life deci­ sions. \"It's a way to better prepare students for the working world. People who have been mentored have a much higher percent­ age of being successful,\" said Anne Gladman, Business Link Programs Coordinator. \"Mentoring is right up there in the corporate world with leadership.\" Not surprisingly, the mentors show a real compassion for the students and enthusiasm for the Career Advantage Program. John Gates, a member of the class of 1969 and a Career Advan­ tage mentor since 1996 said, \"It's to share insights into success, to help someone avoid one or two turns along the way, and to impact someone's life in a meaningful way, that's why I'm a part of this program.\" Within the Business Link Office mentoring is only one of the elements that transforms students into professionals. The other components include connect­ ing students with internship oppor­ tunities, business etiquette work­ shops and various panel discus­ sions. The Business Link office also provides one-on-one career advice and resume critiquing. In its seventh year, the Career Advantage Program has over 400 undergraduate students waiting to be paired with one of the 110 execu­ tive mentors currently available. 'The program is open to all business students with an academic standing of sophomore or higher and com­ mitted in building the relationship. They are then matched accordingly with mentors in their related career interests and goals.

I The mentors serve as role models as students begin their careers and they offer advice on academic and professional pur- 1uits. The professionals are there to impart business knowledge that cannot be learned in the classroom by sharing their \"war stories\" and contributing to the growth of the student. The pro­ gram is to build nurturing relationships and to help students become well-rounded business professionals. \"It gives students a successful transition into the business w1orld, by having folks there providing guidance, avoiding pit­ falls, and answering questions,\" said Ronald E. Roberts Jr., As­ sistant Programs Coordinator of the Business Link office. the older executives and the younger students. So why do students take time out their busy schedules to spend with their mentors? The reasons are many. They include: wanting direction in life, identifying personal strengths and weaknesses, expressing fears, finding out how to become lead­ ers, and practical advise on how to land a meaningful job. \"It was a good opportunity to meet people in the business world and gave me an opportunity to learn what they did and where I want to go,\" said Jacqueline Norlin, a senior majoring in Business Administration. \"You can't learn that experience from a book.

You may have read her column in USA Today or one her books. At the university, you may have heard her stories about the 1988 presidential campaign. Susan Estrich grew up near Boston, Massachusetts. She loved to watch the political conventions on television and read politcal thrillers. In 1969, she went door-to-door in a special congressional election, a referendum on the Vietnam War. Estrich became hooked on politics when she saw that it brought people together to make change. The first cam­ paign she worked on was for Ed Brooke, a Massachusetts Republican. After attending Wellesley College and Harvard Law School, Estrich became a clerk at the U.S. Court of Appeals and for the U.S. Supreme Court. She also worked for Steve Breyer, who was then chief counsel of the Senate Ju­ diciary Committee. When Massuchusetts senator Edward Kennedy decided to run for president in 1980, Estrich joined his campaign. Working as the national campaign manager for Democratic presiden­ tial candidate Michael Dukakis in 1988, Estrich has be­ come an important figure in the Democratic Party. Working in a political campaign, even if it is a losing cause, has advantages. Estrich believes that it provides many opportunities for learning and advancement in politics. Estrich first thought teaching was not in her future, but she was open to change. She taught at Harvard Law School after Kennedy lost in the primary election and Jimmy Carter lost to Ronald Reagan in the general election. Coming to USC in 1990, Estrich brought with her knowledge of both law and politics. 4 6 Academics @ USC She is the Robert Kingsley Professor of Law and Politics. She teaches election law, gender discrimination, and criminal law. On the first day of class, Estrich tells her students that she is a Democrat and does commentary on television. Estrich goes on to say that the classroom is about \"honesty and learning,\" and therefore her media life bears no relation to her teaching. When discussing the elections, she looks at all sides and asks what the candidates could do to better their campaigns. As a friend and colleague to those in politics, Estrich tells stories of her experiences but without re­ vealing too much information. When Estrich starts with, \"Let me tell you a story,\" students know they will learn things they could never find out from watching television or reading the newspaper. \"Professor Estrich makes poli­ tics more interesting for me,\" says Rachael Bamrick, a senior majoring in cinema-television, \"because she tells real stories from her own po­ litical experiences.\" \"She's very personable,\" adds Lisa Mann, an undecided sopho­ more. \"She is the most entertaining pl.ow1 A,, ~r..Jdl 1,0114 professor I've had so far.\" Teaching gives her the freedom to stay young, to be honest, to challenge herself, and to keep thinking and learning. She wants to touch the lives of people in a positive way. \"I get to help them find themselves, figure out what they think, and fulfill their own dreams.\" During the 2000 elections, Estrich is busy teaching and giv­ ing commentary on television. When appearing on television, she may discuss the elections from a democratic view. In class, however, she will discuss campaign strategies and the debates. Regardless of her point of view, Susan Estrich gives students a chance to get inside politics - without the scandal. ~tOf&IJ ~IJ 1'Jei.~IJ ~u.qu.itt.i. S U S A /~ ­ -~ E S T .

For much of the week it is home to Erwin Chemerinsky, professor of public interest law, legal ethics, and political science. Like the many books, file cabinets, and stacks of legal documents piled high in his office, the man is a wealth of knowledge and experience, a veritable treasure-trove of fascinating sto­ ries and rich history. Rewriting LA's city charter, defending the civil rights of the indigent, and rewriting the constitu­ tion of a former Soviet bloc na­ tion is all day-to-day work for Professor Erwin Chemerinsky. The professor's humble de­ meanor and caring conversa­ tional manner betray the author­ ity of his voice in the realm of constitutional law. The author of four books, dozens of law re­ view articles and hundreds of newspaper pieces, Professor Chemerinsky has written on top­ ics as varied as constitutional law, federal jurisdiction, and professional responsibility. Even though he carries such great weight in the legal arena, Chemerinsky comes from a humble background-his origi- nal ambition in college was to be a social studies teacher. Chemerinsky grew up in the south side of Chicago as the oldest son of working class parents, neither of whom at­ tended college. After completing his undergraduate education at North­ western, Professor Chemerinsky found himself pursuing his interest in civil rights issues at Harvard Law School. He worked as a trial attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice as well as at a small public interest law office in Washington D.C. before accepting a teaching position at DePaul Uni­ versity in Chicago. Chemerinsky came to USC in 1983 and has been teaching courses in the Law School as well as the political science department ever since. Outside of the time he devotes to teaching and writing, Professor Chemerinsky pursues his passion for civil rights issues by volunteering for the ACLU of Southern California and taking several pro bono cases a year for the poor. A recent example was a pro bono case Chemerinsky took in­ volving a homeless man who stole an umbrella and two bottles of liquor from a store on a rainy day. The enhanced level of the crime allowed the person to be convicted under California's 'Three Strikes Law,' giving him a sentence of 25 years to life in prison for the cash equivalent of $43. Chemerinsky was trying to get the case heard in front of the United States Supreme Court. Professor Chemerinsky places family as a top priority. The father of four children, Chemerinsky concedes that there's \"not a lot of time left in the day between work, volun­ teering, and family.\" He enjoys spending time with his two older sons, both currently in high school, and attending sports games of all types, especially the White Sox and Bears, and Lak­ ers. \"I'm a big Lakers fan from a long time ago. They're really p~otc, Av ~r.►v ~eme►µ,.,. the only L.A. team that I have ever really rooted for,\" admitted Chemerinsky. One of his research assistants, David Saldana, gave an ac­ count of the essence of this incredible professor. \"On top of being a scary kind of brilliant, he's also one of the sweetest people I've ever met. I once had a 6 p.m. deadline to get some research to him, and my computer crashed about an hour before that, taking half of my work with it. So I wrote down as much as I could and drove to his house as fast as I could. I got there at about 8 o'clock, apologizing like crazy for being late and tried to explain what happened. He said, 'Oh, don't worry about that. You look upset. Would you like a cookie?' How cool is that?\" Very cool indeed. Erwin Chemerinsky 49 a Teaching students to think differently J ames G. Ellis, a professor in the department of market ing in the Marshall School of Business, inspires students to embrace his crazy and unconventional attitude of life and doing business. In an unorthodox spirit, Professor Ellis is one of the few professors in the business school who does not hold a Ph.D. He mixes the ideas of textbook theory with examples from his own life mistakes and successes. \"He doesn't act like a professor. He acts like a human being relating his own experiences, not like a textbook, but a lifebook,\" said Katherine Borras, a senior majoring in business administration, who was a student in his advertising and pro­ motions class. Professor Ellis started his jour­ ney with an undergraduate business degree from the University of New Mexico and then a master of busi­ ness administration degree from Harvard University. From Harvard he first traveled the world as vice president of mer­ chandising with the Broadway De­ partment Stores, then served as the president of American Porsche De­ sign, and has been involved with a number of entrepreneurial ventures with Miller's Outpost, Socks du Jour, Comfort Center Mattress, and Sideout Sports. He also serves on the board of directors for a number of non-profit organizations, including chairman of the San Gabriel Valley Chapter of Young Presidents, where he or­ ganized university education programs in Bombay, India and in Bermuda. Since coming to the university in 1997 Professor Ellis has been an assistant professor, teaching courses in advertising, sales force, retailing, and marketing management. He is also the di­ rector of the Family Business Program, an executive education program that aids family-owned businesses with family/busi­ ness issues. His colorful stories include traveling to the mountainous, 5 0 Academics @ USC outer regions of Mongolia to check the quality of cashmere on the underside of billy goats, driving into the Alps for a meeting with the Porsche family, and an annual pilgrimage to a favorite golf course in Scotland. He is most proud of his American Dia­ betes Association Father of the Year 2000 award presented by his five children. \"My passions in life are family and golf. In that order.\" In the classroom, Professor Ellis challenges students to ex­ plore their creativity. He wants students to put their egos in the back pocket and boldly try new things, to constantly look at things from different perspectives and put ideas together that at first do not make any sense. To foster creative ideas he en­ courages students to walk a new way to class, read magazines about various topics, and strike up conver­ sations with strangers while riding the elevator. He wants students to think beyond the textbook and aca­ demic setting. \"The creative process is some­ thing we don't spend enough time teaching,\" says Professor Ellis of traditional teaching in his advertis­ ing and promotions course. He stresses that creativity is one of the four cornerstones for a business to be successful and innova­ tive. The other business foundations are ethics, quality, and lead­ ership. His philosophy is \"when everybody else is going left, you go right.\" Borras said she always left class inspired \"Ellis pushed me to see my creative potential and convinced me that I don't need a lot of money to be happy.\" Professor Ellis tries to make stu­ dents believe that they can change the world. \"My job is to tum on the light, make you see the light that you're going to be successful. My success will not be measured for another 20 years, when all of a sudden when one of you appears on the cover of Time, Forbes, or Newsweek. I'm just planting the seeds, and I love it, it's fun!\" J A M E S G. E L L I S Professo'1 Marshall School of Business James G. E llis 51 PERCIVAL E V E R E T T Professo~ English 5 2 Academics @ USC Professor has no one fooled H e sits inside his office behind a large desk, his ex­ pression fixed between a smile and a scowl. His name is Percival Everett, and he is the chair of the English department here at the university. Well known for his biting wit and sarcasm, Professor Everett is both feared and revered by his students, who know that at any minute they could fall victim to his brutally honest criticism. Everett, in addition to being the chair of the department, teaches the Advanced Fiction Writing class as well as an Ex­ perimental Fiction Writing class. The author of 13 books, he is both a prolific writer and a demanding teacher. When asked why he is some­ times harsh in his critiques of stu­ dent work, Everett said, \"I take this art seriously. It's cruel to suggest to someone that they can do something when they can't. Not everybody can be a writer. Thank God.\" Despite his seemingly hard ex­ terior, Everett's students know that this is simply a facade. \"Professo~ Everett was kind of 1 scary at first, but then he started making all of us laugh,\" said Melody Robusto, a senior majoring in creative writing. \"It's not like he's attacking us personally, he just wants us to get better. I'd rather be told the truth than coddled any day.\" \"Professor Everett's the first professor I've had at this school who tells people the truth,\" said Mindee Lieske, a senior major­ ing in creative writing. \"He takes the kid gloves off and goes to work. It bothers some people, but only at first.\" Everett received his undergraduate degree in biochemistry and philosophy from the University of Miami-Florida. He played guitar in a jazz band on the side to help pay for school. He went to Brown University for graduate work, where he obtained a masters degree in creative writing. He has won several awards, including the Pen-Oakland-Josephine Miles Award for Excel­ lence in Literature in 1997 for Big Picture, a collection of short stories and the New American Writing award for his novel Zulus in 1990. After college, Everett taught math in a Miami high school for half a year. \"It's much easier to teach in college than in high school,\" he said. \"Generally, college students aren't armed.\" Everett taught at several different colleges before arriving here, including Notre Dame University, the University of Ken­ tucky and UC Riverside. He was also the visiting chair at Wyo­ ming University. \"Teaching here is different from the UC system,\" Everett said. \"All the students here are pretty much 18- 22, and the students are generally brighter and more well-read.\" Everett also notices a greater feeling of community at USC. \"I get a sense that the students in my classes like each other. It may not be different from the other places I've taught, but I notice it here.\" Among his writing influences, Everett lists Mark Twain, Walt Kelly, Ralph Ellison and Chester Hives, \"but I'm leaving a lot out,\" he said. When asked to give some advice to would-be writers Everett joked, pkoto~ A\" ~t.11~t.ll ~0 114 \"Quit, before someone gets hurt.\" He went on to say, \"The only person who can do it is you. No amount of stroking can make you a writer. I see a lot of talent and good students. There are no child prodigy writers. They need some experience first,\" he said. Everett's books are listed in the black writer's section of most bookstores. When asked if that bothered him, he replied, \"Yes. For instance, my novel Frenzy, it's about the Greek god Dionysus. The only thing ostensibly African-American about it is my photo on the back cover.\" Professor Everett is widely respected by both faculty and students. He is an excellent teacher who manages to throw his own brand of comedy into his classes, much to the delight or dismay of students.

USC can, of course. The Schools of Theatre, Architecture, Fine Arts and the Thornton School of Music all have this distinction. Not many people in southern California know this. \"We want to be considered a major cultural destination,\" said Lisa Cavanaugh, the director of the Arts Initiative. The Arts Initiative, begun by Provost Lloyd Armstrong three years ago, is finally swinging into action this fall. The basic premise of the initiative in­ volves the university working with ex­ ternal partners, such as the Los Ange­ les County Museum of Art, on differ­ ent kinds of interdisciplinary collabo­ rations and joint projects. \"Not a lot of people want to come down to USC because they don' t know what we have to offer,\" said Cavanaugh. The Arts Initiative hopes to conquer this problem by attracting visitors to the campus, increasing awareness of arti stic and cultural events, and emphasizing the school's position as a preeminent arts educator and premiere arts presenter. The initiative, consisting of the four main academic partners mentioned above and the Fisher Gallery, will host a number of events during the upcom­ ing academic year. 2000.\" It included, \"Do Art Schools Rule? Past, present and future of the California Art World,\" a symposium in November hosted by USC Spectrum. The symposium included panels, in­ terviews and discussions exploring the unique position of art schools in California. In November, the Arts Initiative, the School of Theatre and the National Repertory Theatre Foundation co-sponsored the 2000 National Play Award Playwrights Festival. This event be­ gan in 1976 under the name of \"The Los Angeles Dramatists' Award.\" This year, only five finalists were chosen out of a field of 250. The festival also included a symposium called \"Facing the Critic - Facing the Crowd,\" which focued on the relation­ ship between new art and artists, critics and viewers. The summer of 2000 was marked by a collaboration between USC and the Performing Arts Center of Los Angeles County. Together, they gave children of migrant workers a chance to dance, sing, and act in the 7th Annual Summer Migrant Education Arts Academy. This program, which began in 1993, previously was held at the county li­ brary. The camp's debut at the univer­ sity brought more than 250 first­ through eighth-graders to two, week­ long sessions. The children worked with music, dance, and drama professionals. The culmination was performances for parents and friends on the last day. Beginning in September, the School of Cinema-Television and the Arts Ini­ tiative presented the Alfred Hitchcock festival, Hitch 101. The festival, which Dean Robert Scales of the School of Theater told the Pasadena Star-News F rench horn students p/wJtc cou►te~IJ \"iko►MtcM ~cAool ol 1Hu~it provide mellow sounds in rehearsal. he hopes the tradition will continue and that the university will welcome the program back next year. \"I have never done some of these things before and it was such a good experience,\" nine-year-old Ana Lopez told the Star-News. \"I liked being at the university. It is a very big place. I was sad that it lasted only a week.\" continued through December, included film screenings in honor of the 101st anniversary of the celebrated director's birth. The festival ran concurrently with a Hitchcock class taught by Drew Casper, holder of the Alma and Alfred Hitchcock Chair. Beginning in October and running through February 2001, the School of Fine Arts teamed up with LACMA to support its exhibit called \"Made in California: Art, Image, & Identity, 1900- Artistic Worlds 5 5 A cultural explosion on campus T he arts are thriving here at the university. Perfor­ mances and exhibits are increasing and attendance records are skyrocketing. Visitors from all over the globe are frequenting our campus to get a taste of some of the best arts and cultural experiences in the west. Though the Arts Initiative, which was launched this year, helped increase the outside world's knowledge of USC arts, many of the programs were on the rise even before the initia­ tive began. Take the Thornton School of Music, for example. Two years ago the school launched a major institu­ tional and destination marketing campaign. \"The Thornton School of Music has enjoyed a considerable increase in audience attendance and media attention,\" said Walter Zooi, the public relations agent for the school. I Another USC arts program which has seen an increase inl recent years is the USC Fisher Gallery. The fall semester brought I an increase in attendance when the Gallery hosted an exhibit in collaboration with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's \"Made in California: Art, Image and Identity, 1900-2000.\" LACMA's idea was to display works either inspired by or pro­ duced in California. The Fisher Gallery's exhibit \"USC Col­ lects California\" contains more than 80 pieces of art spanning from tum-of- the-century to cutting edge work. \"It's hard to say what our aver­ age attendance is. Some days we have five people stop by, and other days we have over a hundred be­ cause of special programs,\" said Jeanette La Vere, education and out­ reach coordinator for the Fisher Gallery. This fall exhibit was defi­ nitely one special program that brought an audience to the gallery and to USC. The exhibit ran through the month of October. The Thornton School produces over 500 musical events throughout southern California every year, in­ cluding student recitals held on cam­ pus. The School's marketing efforts target the Thornton Symphony, the Chamber Orchestra, the Jazz Or­ chestra, and the Chamber Choir. \"We began seeing a rise in at­ tendance at the beginning of 1999,\" T wo of the talented violinists from the USC Symphony. Another free public festival included staged readings of the five NRTF National Play Award final­ ists' plays. As noted in the Novem­ ber issue of RSVP, the readings were presented in association with the California African-American Mu- said Zooi. \"For these events we've seen a rise in attendance of approximately 25%.\" Zooi believes that the attendance increase resulted from new marketing efforts and the fact that the School made all Thornton concerts free to USC faculty, students, and staff. The marketing efforts include regular listings in the Los Angeles Times, LA Weekly, Los Angeles Magazine, KUSC, the Pasadena Star News, and many other publications. The Thornton School also launced a newsletter and concert calendar called \"Hear Here.\" The publication reviews concerts from the previ­ ous six months, lists upcoming events, and are mailed to 20,000 alumni, donors, and other music schools across the nation, Zooi pointed out. 5 6 Academics @ USC seum and Hebrew Union College­ Jewish Institute of Religion.

Along with an increased knowledge of arts programs, the university has also begun to market its faculty accomplishments. One way is through the Provost's Distinguished Writers Series.

Once the USC football game at the Coliseum has ended, the lights are dimmed, the athletes head to the locker rooms, and there remains only loyal Tro­ jan Marching Band fans. With the night air rolling in and the contrast of the stadium lights, the Coli­ seum becomes cloaked in a gray mist. The Coliseum takes on a mysterious aura, with the low lights shining down on the cleat-destroyed field and the stands - once crowded with cardinal and gold - is now filled with an emptiness that will remain until the next event. If one looks and listens carefully, you might see or hear the great Trojan foot­ ball players of yesteryears - from Morley Drury to Marcus Allen. On September 23, 2000, against San Jose State, the spotlight was rightfully on the Coliseum - the 500th USC football game played in the stadium that the Trojans have called home since it was built in 1923. There's no doubt that the Coliseum is steeped with USC football stories. In 1974, the Trojans beat rival Notre Dame, 55- 24, in one of the biggest comebacks in school his­ tory. USC scored almost all of its 55 points in the second half, except for one touchdown by Anthony Davis in the final seconds of the first half. Once the second half began, Davis was all over the place, especially in the Irish's endzone, and helped lead the Trojans to victory. \"We turned into madmen,\" said Davis, after the game. Johnny McKay, son of then-Head Coach John McKay, said, \"I can't understand it. Against Notre Dame? Maybe against Kent State, but Notre Dame?\" USC went on that year to beat Ohio State, 18-17, in the Rose Bowl. More stories are added every year and the 1999 season was no exception. There was USC's much­ awaited 17-7 victory against UCLA to end an eight­ game winning streak. Both schools failed to meet their preseason expectations, but a win healed some of their wounds. After eight years of Bruin domi­ nance, the Trojans prevailed. Remember quarterback John Fox's proposal to his girlfriend Nicole Brown in front of the Coliseum audience after the win against Louisiana Tech? When the Coliseum was first built, it was used IN for an array of events, including concerts, speeches, NFL games, the Dodgers and yes, even UCLA foot­ ball games. The Bruins played most of their home games at the Coliseum from 1929-1981. The Coliseum was the site of the first game for the Dodgers after their move from Brooklyn in 1958. Appropriately, the Dodgers beat the Giants, 6-5, in that game. It was also the site of the 1959 World Series be­ tween the Dodgers and the Chicago White Sox. Be­ hind Larry Sherry's Most Valuable Player perfor­ mance, L.A. beat the White Sox in six games for its first championship. In addition, two Olympic games were held at the Coliseum: in 1932 and 1984. The 1984 Olympics used the Coliseum for the opening and closing ceremonies and the track events. Even now, the stairway underneath the Olympic torch still has remnants of those Olympics. While walking on those stairs, one can see the paint that was left over from the Games. Now it is chipped and faded, but it still contains the history and the footprints of the athletes who walked those stairs during the ceremonies. Beside international events and football games, the Coliseum has become the home of the USC soc­ cer team. In 1996, the Women of Troy played half of their home games there and since then, have elevated to play most of their home games there. \"The Coliseum is conducive to the way we want to play,\" USC Head Coach Jim Millinder said. \"It has a nice surface, a great atmosphere and there's so much history there. I expect we'll be tough in there all the time.\" And USC has. After four seasons of playing at the Coliseum, the Women of Troy have encompassed an impressive record. The next time you're sitting at the Coliseum, feel­ ing the warmth of the sun beating down on you, think of the countless events that happened before: the Olympics, baseball and football games, concerts, speeches and countless others. Connect with the history of the Coliseum. ,tof&IJ Ay ~ikq Le Cloaked in Memories 61 The USC hockey team has been winning since 1924 and its history is long and illustrious. This year, the team was set to write a new chapter, bringing the program to the forefront once again and taking the fans along for the ride. Try Iceland. After the previous successful season, which in­ cluded a 20-0 Pacific 8 Conference record and a three­ game sweep of rival UCLA in the best-of-five Cross­ Town Cup, the team traveled to Iceland for the \"Fire and Ice Tournament\" during November. The tourna­ ment, in its inaugural year, invited teams from all over the world, including eight teams from the United States. The season began September 29 in Utah against powerhouse Weber State, which finished last year No. 3 in the nation in ACHA Division II. Seventh-year coach and former Trojan Mark Wilbur lost only one player to graduation and has high expectations for the team this season. \"Our goals are to go undefeated in our division again, (get) to the nationals and (take) a crack at the national championship,\" Wilbur said. Leading the team are Eric Kahnert - a junior for­ ward who was USC's first ice hockey All-American in 1999 - and senior McGill. Kahnert contributes the award to \"a combination of hard work and determination.\" Two attributes which well describe the team from top to bottom. Because USC Ice Hockey is a club sport, it is dependent mostly on outside resources. The program is based on volunteers, both for coach and the players. This holds especially true for Wilbur, who gives both time and money to support the team and its players. But most importantly, he brings to the table the intangibles. \"It shows on his face how much he loves the game,\" Kahnert said. \"He has tons of Trojan spirit. He is dedicated to the players, the team and the school - and he loves beating UCLA,\" senior defenseman Andrew Schnickle said. That is what it comes down to for the players: They do it because they love it, and it most certainly shows in their style of play. 6 2 Sports @ USC \"Come to one game,\" Kahnert said. \"And we will have you hooked. The atmosphere alone will make up for the drive.\" Even with club sport status, USC hockey usually ranks from No. 4 to No. 6 in the university's atten­ dance for sporting events - a trend the players would love to see increase. \"The fans are the biggest part of any sport,\" said right-winger sophomore Nick Nickson. \"The more fans on your side, the better you play.\" The team plays and practices at Disney Ice in Ana­ heim, also a practice rink for the NHL's Ducks. The facilities are great, but the distance from campus cre­ ates some problems for fans and the team alike. \"It causes a little heartache to have to go to Ana­ heim for home games, but the facilities are top-notch,\" Wilbur said. Players hope though that the university can sup­ ply shuttles for the fans so they have an alternative to driving. For the seniors, this season offers a great oppor­ tunity to go out on top. \"This is the last time for some of us to play com­ petitively, a last hurrah - that will definitely add to the intensity,\" McGill said. That intensity coupled with the team's tight-knit nature make for an exciting season. \"Our friendships off the ice make us a better team on it,\" said Hicks. \"We are in it together, (100 per­ cent).\" This attitude defines the team and reflects the spirit of USC. \"The most important thing for us is to be profes­ sional on and off the ice, to show others that we take our roles seriously,\" Nickson said. This is something the players will take with them into the world, along with their love of the game. \"Once you play hockey you will always be in­ volved (with it),\" said Kahnert. \"Whether you're coaching or watching, it becomes a part of you for­ ever.\" The team certainly hopes the fans can have their place in the excitement of the 2000-2001 season. ~to\"tJ AtJ ~ell l~lt.A~uflt.

How about adding the nation's top-ranked re­ cruiting class to the mix? That's exactly what second-year interim head coach Jerritt Elliott had as his 2000 USC women's volleyball team embarked on what promised to be one of the most exciting seasons ever for the Women of Troy. USC, which has won four national champion­ ships, but none since 1981- this season finally had a great opportunity to begin its ascent back among the country's elite programs. Elliott felt that the combination of returning play­ ers and newcomers could allow the Trojans to play a powerful, quick, solid, ball control-oriented brand of volleyball. Middle blocker Jennifer Pahl, outside hitters Antoinette Polk, Janae Henry and Lauren Killian, and setter Tracy Lindquist made up the core of returning starters. \"This team will be a lot more physical than in the past, but we still will maintain our strength in ball handling and speed,\" said Elliott as he entered his sixth year as a member of the USC coaching staff. \"We don't plan on forgetting about the defensive as­ pect of the game. We will continue to emphasize great ball control, speed and quickness, and in addition to that, we'll be more forceful at the net because of our newly-added size.\" For a team that fielded only one player taller than 6-1 last season, USC is bigger thanks to the addition of two highly-touted 6-3 freshman middle blockers, Katie Olsovsky and Kelli Lantz. They are accompa­ nied by 6-1 outside hitter April Ross, the 1999 Gatorade National Player of the Year. These three are among a class of six incoming players that was named Volleyball magazine's top-rated recruiting class of 2000. \"Three of these freshmen (Olsovsky, setter Toni Anderson and libero Nicole Davis - Ross was selected QUICK S OLID to the team but decided not to play in order to re­ cover during the summer) played with the Junior National Team last summer, which says a lot about our incoming talent,\" said Elliott, who was named the 1999 Pac-10 Coach of the Year. \"Considering the improvement I've seen throughout last spring from our returners and the addition of this solid re­ cruiting class, this team could be extremely good by the end of the season "
