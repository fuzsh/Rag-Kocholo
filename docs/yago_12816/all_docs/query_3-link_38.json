        "text": "Red's Pledge of Allegiance\n\nI had this one teacher, he was the principal of the Harrison School, in Vincennes, Indiana. To me, he was the greatest teacher, a real sage of my time. He had such wisdom. We were all reciting the Pledge of Allegiance one day, and he walked over. This little old teacher - Mr. Lasswell was his name. He said:\n\n\"I've been listening to you boys and girls recite the Pledge of Allegiance all semester and it seems as though it is becoming monotonous to you. If I may, may I recite it and try to explain to you the meaning of each word?\"\n\nI - me, an individual, a committee of one.\n\nPledge - dedicate all my worldly goods to give without self-pity.\n\nAllegiance - my love and my devotion.\n\nTo the Flag - our standard, Old Glory, a symbol of freedom. Wherever she waves, there is respect because your loyalty has given her a dignity that shouts freedom is everybody's job.\n\nOf the United - that means that we have all come together.\n\nStates - individual communities that have united into 48 great states. 48 individual communities with pride and dignity and purpose, all divided with imaginary boundaries, yet united to a common cause, and that's love of country.\n\nOf America.\n\nAnd to the Republic - a republic - a state in which sovereign power is invested in representatives chosen by the people to govern. And government is the people and it's from the people to the leaders, not from the leaders to the people.\n\nFor Which it Stands!\n\nOne Nation - meaning, so blessed by God.\n\nIndivisible - incapable of being divided.\n\nWith Liberty - which is freedom and the right of power to live one's life without threats or fear or any sort of retaliation.\n\nAnd Justice - the principle and quality of dealing fairly with others.\n\nFor All. - which means, boys and girls, it's as much your country as it is mine.\n\nAnd now, boys and girls, let me hear you recite the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\n\"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\"\n\nSince I was a small boy, two states have been added to our country, and two words have been added to the Pledge of Allegiance - \"under God.\" Wouldn't it be a pity if someone said, \"That is a prayer,\" and that would be eliminated from our schools too?\n\n- Red Skelton"
