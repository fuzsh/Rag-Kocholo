        "text": "RAYMOND BERNARD\n\nThe fourth volume from Eclipse — the new, no-frills offshoot of the Criterion Collection — is devoted to two films by the French director Raymond Bernard: his 1932 antiwar epic, “Wooden Crosses,” and his 1934 adaptation of Victor Hugo’s “Misérables,” presented in three feature-length episodes. Mr. Bernard, who did his best work before World War II (and then spent the war in hiding from the Nazis), is little remembered today, even in France. But on the evidence of these two very powerful, very personal films, he’s a vital figure much worth reclaiming.\n\nThe early ’30s saw a wave of antiwar movies, perhaps prompted by the commercial and critical success of Lewis Milestone’s “All Quiet on the Western Front.” Ranging from anarchic comedies like “Duck Soup” to devastating melodramas like Ernst Lubitsch’s “Broken Lullaby,” these films shared a view of the Great War, which had ended just over a decade earlier, as an exercise in madness and meaninglessness, a tragic absurdity without honor or glory.\n\nMr. Bernard’s film does so too, but builds its case in a manner all its own. The movie hovers close to war-film clichés in its opening scenes, as a new volunteer, the law student Gilbert Demachy (Pierre Blanchar), catches up to his unit: a filthy, flea-bitten band resting between battles. Demachy befriends Sulphart (Gabriel Gabrio), a factory worker whose natural leadership qualities have been brought out by the war, and Bréval (Charles Vanel), a pastry chef turned corporal whose only comfort is the memory of the wife he left at home.\n\nMr. Bernard doesn’t give his characters much more background than this; one of his points is that war is such a visceral, immediate experience that the past simply vanishes in its presence (and the future too). Rather than a character study, the film becomes a series of self-contained episodes: The company is ordered to stay hunkered down in a trench, though the soldiers can hear a German contingent tunneling beneath them to place a bomb; a simple attack on a village extends to 10 days, and the troops find themselves cornered in a graveyard, their trenches the already occupied graves, blown open by the bombing.\n\nGradually, Mr. Bernard’s visual style becomes darker and more phantasmagoric, and what began almost as a documentary evolves into an expressionist nightmare. One by one, the main characters fall, until, at the dumbfounding climax, only one is left, alone and dying on the battlefield, his pain unbearably real, his fears reflected in a haunting montage of dream imagery, and only a fade to black to mark his passing.\n\nMr. Bernard’s next project was his most ambitious, a full-scale adaptation of “Les Misérables” for which a convincing 19th-century Paris was constructed in a studio in southern France. As Jean Valjean, Hugo’s polymorphous hero who rises from ex-convict to prosperous bourgeois, Mr. Bernard cast the stage actor Harry Baur, a towering figure whose sheer bulk and thundering voice make him a dominating moral presence. For Inspector Javert, the robotic policeman in unshakable pursuit of Valjean, Mr. Bernard turned again to Charles Vanel, a performer with a wide range whose career extended from the days of one-reel films to the New Wave and beyond.\n\nAs Thénardier, the Dickensian innkeeper who enslaves the young Cosette (Gaby Triquet) and returns in the last act with a dastardly blackmail scheme, Mr. Bernard cast one of his regulars, Charles Dullin, whose crooked figure and cracked voice make a perfect counterpoint to the monumental presence of the two principal antagonists.\n\nThis is very likely the best adaptation of Hugo’s novel, and certainly the best I know (though I would be curious to see Riccardo Freda’s version, made in Italy in 1947). That’s partly because Mr. Bernard avoids any trace of the literary; this is a film that vigorously expresses itself through performance and visual style. He often uses oddly tilted camera angles that suggest German expressionist films, but then suddenly discards all such formalist effects for vigorous, hand-held coverage.\n\nThe epic centerpiece of the third episode, the attack on the street barricades set up by a hearty band of anti-royalist revolutionaries, combines compositions as careful as a French academic painting with a vigorous, strikingly contemporary use of hand-held camera.\n\nLike his fellow refugee from the French boulevard theater, Sacha Guitry, Mr. Bernard was a wonderfully impure filmmaker who mixed and matched styles, broke through fourth walls and enjoyed a grand, stentorian performance as much as a crafty little character turn. And like Mr. Guitry, he deserves to be much better known in this country. Thanks, Eclipse, for taking this first step. (Eclipse by the Criterion Collection, $39.95, not rated.)\n\nTHE JOAN COLLINS\n\nSuperstar Collection\n\nThis well-produced box from Fox Home Video contains excellent new versions of five CinemaScope films of the 1950s featuring Joan Collins, two of which are quite watchable.\n\nA British beauty of limited expressivity but armed with an infinite capacity for self-promotion, Ms. Collins had the best role of her career in Richard Fleischer’s “Girl in the Red Velvet Swing,” playing Evelyn Nesbit opposite Ray Milland’s Stanford White in a free adaptation of the sex scandal and murder that galvanized early-20th-century New York. Mr. Fleischer’s expansive, detail-packed use of the widescreen frame and vivid color symbolism make this one of the most accomplished of early CinemaScope films, and Fox has provided the original stereo soundtracks.\n\nMore problematic but interesting in its own way, “Rally ’Round the Flag, Boys!” is one of the late works of the great Leo McCarey (“An Affair to Remember”). Based on a satirical novel by Max Shulman, the film is a typical late ’50s comedy of sexual frustration and suburban angst: Paul Newman, as a Connecticut commuter, finds himself drawn to the eminently available trophy wife played by Ms. Collins when his own spouse (Joanne Woodward) begins diverting her energies to community projects."
