        "text": "Prologue:\n\nHollywood history is chock full of myths and misinformation and Raymond K. Johnson / Raymond K. Johnston is an example. For years, those name variations were assumed to be aliases used by low budget movie producer / director Bernard B. Ray.\n\nC. Jack Lewis (1924 - 2009) was a retired Marine officer, movie screenwriter, co-founder of Gun World magazine, more. In his memoir White Horse, Black Hat: A Quarter Century on Hollywood's Poverty Row (Scarecrow Press, 2002), Lewis reinforced the notion that Johnson / Johnston was another name for Bernard B. Ray. From Lewis' book:\n\n\" ... he worked under various names, mostly to keep his projects from looking like one-man shows! Names he used were Ray Bernard, Raymond Johnson, Raymond K. Johnson, Raymond Johnston, Raymond K. Johnston, Bernard Ray, Raymond Samuels, and Franklin Shamroy.\"\n\nRaymond K. Johnson / Johnston were NOT Bernard B. Ray pseudonyms. Many years ago, I did an Old Corral biography on B film producer Harry S. Webb, with info and photos from his son Bob Webb. One of Bob's comments related to Raymond K. Johnson:\n\n\"This is an actual person who I had the pleasure of meeting in the sixties at MGM, where he had become head of the camera department.\"\n\nMay, 1957 issue of American Cinematographer magazine confirms Johnson at MGM: \"The ASC last month elected to Associate Membership in the Society Raymond K. Johnson, head of the camera department at M-G-M studio ...\" (ASC is the American Society of Cinematographers.)\n\nHere's Raymond K. Johnson.\n\nRaymond K. Johnson / Raymond Kingsbury Johnson\n\n1901 - 1999\n\n(Courtesy of the Estate of Marion Johnson Hayter,\n\nhalf-sister to Gladys Johnson and Raymond Johnson)\n\nAbove - Ray Johnson at M-G-M. From the mid 1940s through mid 1950s, Johnson was assistant to John Arnold, the head of M-G-M's camera department. When Arnold retired in 1956, Johnson became camera department boss.\n\nRaymond Kingsbury Johnson was born November 24, 1901 in Leeds Township, Benson County, North Dakota to Andrew L. and Myrtle Alice Kingsbury Johnson. His movie career began in the 1920s, and one of his early jobs was the filmed-in-Alaska THE CHECHAHCOS (Alaska Moving Pictures/Associated Exhibitors, 1924). Filmed in 1923, Raymond K. Johnson was a cameraman and his sister Gladys Johnson had a supporting role. Chris Beheim has been researching that film and more details are further down on this webpage.\n\nThen Raymond directed a couple of silents. First was NORTH OF NOME (Great Northern Film Company/Arrow, 1925) which was originally titled THE ETERNAL FRONTIER. Sister Gladys was the female lead. Next was the filmed-in-Utah THE EXODUS / ALL FACES WEST (1928). EXODUS got tied up in a bankruptcy. A few years later, EXODUS was auctioned off, some opening narration was added, and the film was released in 1931 by Syndicate as CALL OF THE ROCKIES.\n\nTrade publications have a few traces of \"Raymond Johnson Productions\" being formed and creating some aviation shorts in 1933 for Perfex Pictures Corporation which was headquartered in New York City.\n\nIn 1935 - 1940, Johnson helmed about twenty B grade features - westerns and non-westerns - for independent, Poverty Row producers C. C. Burr (1891 - 1956) and Harry S. Webb (1892 - 1959). His films for Burr included four singing cowboy yarns with melodious Fred Scott. And for Harry S. Webb, he did a couple of Rin-Tin-Tin Jr. adventures, a Bob Steele western, and a half dozen oaters with Monogram's sagebrush crooner Jack Randall.\n\nIn July, 1942, forty year old Raymond K. Johnson enlisted in the Army for World War II service. The 1943 Film Daily Yearbook has listings of Hollywood people serving in the military. Under the category of \"directors, assistant directors and unit managers\" were Frank Capra, George Cukor, John Ford, William Witney ... and \"Raymond K. Johnson, U. S. A.\"\n\nBelow are military photos of Raymond with Staff Sergeant or Technical Sergeant (Sergeant First Class) stripes. One was taken in 1942 at Camp Young, Indio, California, and Camp Young was headquarters of General George S. Patton's Desert Training Command. An undated photo has him with Technical Sergeant stripes (three stripes and two rockers - equivalent to a Sergeant First Class). Unsure of his discharge date, but indications are that he was home in late 1945 and re-connected with C. C. Burr. That was short-lived as Burr's time as a film producer was over.\n\nIn the mid 1940s, Johnson did a career change and joined MGM's camera department which was headed by John Arnold (1889 - 1964). When Arnold retired in 1956, Johnson became camera department boss.\n\nThe March 26, 1999 issue of the Palm Springs, California The Desert Sun paper had a death notice - 97 year old Raymond Kingsbury Johnson of Thousand Palms, California, passed away March 23, 1999 at the Rancho Mirage Healthcare Center in Rancho Mirage, California. He was a photographer for MGM and a World War II Army veteran.\n\nAbove - 1926 theater ad for NORTH OF NOME (Great Northern Film Company/Arrow, 1925), Raymond K. Johnson's first directing job ... and his last name is misspelled \"Johnston\". The president of the Great Northern Film Company was George Edward Lewis, who was the second husband of Raymond Johnson's mother Myrtle.\n\n1938\n\nAbove is the 1938 organization chart for C. C. Burr's company which produced singing cowboy Fred Scott's last four westerns. Raymond K. Johnson was multi-functional, serving as Vice President, production supervisor (producer), and he directed the four Scotts.\n\nIn the 1937 issues of the Film Daily Yearbook and Motion Picture Almanac, the C. C. Burr organization has Johnson as Secretary-Managing Director, producer, and scenario writer.\n\nAbove - screen capture from the opening titles and credits with Raymond K. Johnson directing the Fred Scott CODE OF THE FEARLESS (Spectrum, 1939) for producer C. C. Burr.\n\nAbove - screen capture from the opening titles and credits from Fred Scott's IN OLD MONTANA (Spectrum, 1939). Johnson directed this and also got partial credit for the script and story.\n\nAbove - pressbook ad for Bob Steele's PINTO CANYON (Metropolitan, 1940) which Johnson helmed for producer Harry S. Webb.\n\nIn the late 1930s, Johnson connected with low budget producer Harry S. Webb, who with Bernard B. Ray, had operated Reliable Pictures. After Reliable folded, Webb formed Metropolitan Pictures company, and had Johnson directing oaters and some non-westerns. Johnson's films included Bob Steele in PINTO CANYON (Metropolitan, 1940) and Rin-Tin-Tin Jr. adventures, FANGS OF THE WILD (Metropolitan, 1939) and LAW OF THE WOLF (Metropolitan, 1939). Soon after, Webb took his production unit to Monogram Pictures and Johnson directed a half dozen with Jack Randall.\n\n(From Old Corral collection)\n\nAbove is the title lobby card from the Jack Randall starrer WILD HORSE RANGE (Monogram, 1940), one of the half dozen Randalls directed by Raymond K. Johnson. Notice a problem with the lobby card? Randall has his sixgun in his left hand and his neckerchief is tied on the right side. Note the reddish colored inset on the bottom left with Charlie King, George Chesebro and Randall, who is wearing a single holster on the right side and his kerchief tied on the left. The large image was reversed by the folks doing the lobby card design.\n\n(From Old Corral collection)\n\nRIDIN' THE TRAIL was the last of singin' cowboy Fred Scott's series for Spectrum films and was filmed in 1939. However, it got lost or misplaced during Spectrum's financial meltdown and collapse. Trade publications indicate that Monogram had the film and planned a June 27, 1940 release ... and then it's listed as postponed. Independent distributor Arthur Ziehm acquired the film and released it in late 1941 - early 1942.\n\n(Courtesy of the Estate of Marion Johnson Hayter,\n\nhalf-sister to Gladys Johnson and Raymond Johnson)\n\nCentered between two unidentified soldiers is Raymond K. Johnson, and rank on his right sleeve is either Staff Sergeant or Technical Sergeant. Writing on the back of this photo reads: \"Raymond at Camp Young, Indio, California 1942\".\n\nJohnson enlisted in the U. S. Army on July 31, 1942 in Los Angeles. He had to have some speciality or talent in order to receive Sergeant stripes that quickly.\n\nCamp Young was the headquarters of General George S. Patton's Desert Training Command. More at Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Young\n\n(Courtesy of the Estate of Marion Johnson Hayter,\n\nhalf-sister to Gladys Johnson and Raymond Johnson)\n\nNo date on the above photo - and no unit insignia on his left shoulder. His rank is Technical Sergeant which became Sergeant First Class in the late 1940s (SFC E-7 in today's Army).\n\nWikipedia has info on the Technical Sergeant and Sergeant First Class ranks: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_first_class\n\nHighlights from trade publications and newspapers\n\nBelow are a highlights from various trades and newspapers which provide a timeline on Raymond K. Johnson:\n\n1923 in Alaska - Raymond is a cameraman on THE CHECHAHCOS (Alaska Moving Pictures/Associated Exhibitors, 1924).\n\nMay 2, 1925 Motion Picture News: \"Arrow has changed the title on its Alaska-made picture and it will be released ... as 'North of Nome' instead of 'The Eternal Frontier.'\" ; \"... leading feminine role is enacted by Gladys Johnston [sic], selected by a group of native Alaskans as the most beautiful girl in the territory.\" ; \"The picture ... was directed by Raymond K.

(THE EXODUS / ALL FACES WEST, starred Ben Lyon and Marie Prevost. The production company went into receivership and the film was sold off, retitled to CALL OF THE ROCKIES, and released in 1931.)\n\nJuly 19, 1930 Salt Lake (Utah) Telegram newspaper had a lengthy legal notice on the auction / sale of the film - \"The script and motion rights of the story known as 'The Exodus' ... from George Edward Lewis, who had previously acquired and purchased the said motion picture rights to the said story from Raymond K. Johnston [sic] ...\" ; \"... all positive and negative films delivered by said coporation to said Raymond K. Johnston [sic] ...\"\n\nDecember 22, 1931 Variety had an announcement of the new Standard Pictures Corporation. Among their feature film plans: \"First is 'Yukon,', an original story by Finis Fox with Lila Lee, Johnny Mack Brown, Lew Cody, Eddie Gribbon, Wheeler Oakman and Bert Roach in the cast. Raymond K.

Under the category of \"directors, assistant directors and unit managers\" is \"Raymond K. Johnson, U. S. A.\"\n\nOctober 3, 1945 Variety: \"Sacramento, Oct. 2 (1945).

As cellist of station KGW, Miss Johnson is widely known to radio fans of the northwest. Besides playing in solo selections and in orchestra numbers, Miss Johnson devotes much of her time to program arrangement.\"\n\nTrade and newspaper articles also mention her as a cellist at KTM (Los Angeles), KMTR (Los Angeles), and in the mid 1930s, she was assistant program director at ABC in San Francisco.\n\nGladys passed away October 11, 1989 in Thousand Palms, Riverside County, California:\n\nRootsweb World Connect Project had genealogy info on Gladys L.

Cast and crew included cameraman Raymond K. Johnson and his sister Gladys Johnson had a supporting role. Chris writes:\n\n\"Raymond and Gladys' mother was Myrtle Johnson who was a divorcee. (Census records report that she was a widow, but that was not correct.) She married George Edward Lewis in the early 1920s. In 1924, the year after filming THE CHECHAHCOS, Lewis, Raymond and Gladys returned to Alaska to film NORTH OF NOME. The interiors were shot in Portland. Raymond was listed as the Director.\n\nIn 1928, Raymond, Gladys, George Edward Lewis, and Lewis Moomaw (who directed THE CHECHAHCOS) traveled to Utah to make a movie about the Mormons, called THE EXODUS, starring Ben Lyon and Marie Prevost and Gladys in a supporting role. On December 16, 1928 the Los Angeles Times newspaper reported that film director Raymond was \"arranging to have a Movietone accompaniment, making this the first big western to have sound effects.\" The title of the movie was changed to ALL FACES WEST and premiered in Salt Lake City in March of 1929. I'm not sure if it contained talkie features. George Edward Lewis' company went bankrupt, and the film was sold at public auction for $10,000. The title of the film was changed to CALL OF THE ROCKIES with a run time of 71 minutes, and contained talking and sound sequences. It was released to theaters in 1931.\n\n60 minutes of CALL OF THE ROCKIES is available on DVD (from Alpha Video / oldies.com). For some reason, Bernard B. Ray's name appears on the DVD cover as the director of CALL OF THE ROCKIES, although Raymond K.
