        "text": "3.1\n\n(8)\n\nBased on a venerable Legend of the Sea, the story concerns a pliable prostitute named Bella who is all things to all men. No matter what sort of woman her client wants, she will become that woman — at least for the night. When a middle-aged man named Jean insists that Bella is his long-lost sweetheart, she plays along, hoping to escape her sordid lifestyle. The emotional tragedy that follows is meant to explain how Bella became “Maya,” the living embodiment of Lost Souls.\n\nDirector: Raymond Bernard.\n\nStars: Viviane Romance, Marcel Dalio, Jean-Pierre Grenier, Jacques Castelot, Georges Douking, Valéry Inkijinoff, Georges Vitray, Maurice Régamey, Max Dalban, Françoise Hornez, Fréhel, Philippe Nicaud, Jane Morlet, Marthe Sarbel, Xénia Monty."
