        "text": "Part 4 of the Longest Month of My Life\n\n1st Raymond Bernard\n\nThe fact I’ve been able to see four films of at least two and a half hours long a day for the past four days is a worrying trend and I can assure you that I won’t be able to keep it up when I have a full week of work and obligations. In the meantime, Bernard’s three-part adaptation of Hugo’s novel is the first I’ve seen; I’ve been deliberately ignoring the musical simply because I find the songs I know unbearably kitsch and thus simply associated the entire narrative with an atrocious amount of melodrama. And to be fair, there is a lot of melodrama here, but…\n\nThe first thing you have to say about Les Misérables (1934) is that it is 288 minutes long. Being this long, as an adaptation of a huge novel, it allows more space for character development, inclusion of multiple plotlines and themes. It is apparently the fullest adaptation of the Victor Hugo novel. However, this would not make any real difference if the film did not stand-alone, but it stand-alones brilliantly. The lengthy running time, while daunting before you start, is actually a breeze. Les Misérables is so entertaining and packed with incident that the running time flies by, though I did watch the film in the three parts, over three days, as designated by the Masters of Cinema blu-ray. I…\n\nI haven't come close to seeing all the film adaptations of Victor Hugo's doorstop novel, but from those I have, this version by Raymond Bernard (co-written with André Lang) probably deserves its reputation as the best of them all.\n\nFor one thing it's among the most faithful to the novel, and it allows itself to be properly epic and run almost five hours, as it should.\n\nFor another, the performances by Harry Baur as Jean Valjean and Charles Vanel as Inspecteur Javert are first-rate, and they're backed by very good secondary performances, namely by a very, very young Jean Servais - why did I always think he was just born middle-aged? - and Josseline Gael as the couple embodying the…\n\nI just saw this 1934 version of Les Miserables on the Criterion channel. Raymond Bernanrd directed this nearly five hour version of Victor Hugo's classic. The epic runtime is thankfully broken up into three parts to make it easier to watch. It is considered by many critics to be the best adaptation of Les Miserables. It is definitely more fleshed out than the stage version, the only other version I have seen, with more of a background and storyline given to the French Revolution portion of the book among other parts. I was really impressed with the actor, Harry Baur, who played Jean Valjean. He physically fits the role as a towering hulk of a man, but he was riveting…\n\nThe first sound version of Les Misérables. And it's a major piece as Raymond Bernard makes it into a 3-part movie lasting a total of 4 hours and 40 minutes. And even with that length it didn't feel long at all. Bernard quite simply directs a superb movie! He gets the symbolism across perfectly. While some of the revolution sequences in the 3rd part leaves a bit to be desired, the rest manages to make such a strong impression that it more then make up for a little slump.\n\nAs long as it was Harry Baur on screen the production was saved. The man was amazing as Jean Valjean! He really commanded the screen with his presence. Just the transformation…\n\nIt's funny. I've sat through 70 minute films that felt like an eternity. And movies that threatened to run into perpetuity, which sailed by like a breeze. Les Misérables -a nearly 5 hour epic- was mostly a breeze.\n\nI’m no Les Mis aficionado and have only seen the musical that starred Wolverine and Catwoman a few years back; that's it. I thought that was okay, but this is better. While it doesn't have the music, it does have Harry Baur, and Harry Baur carries this picture on his broad shoulders.\n\nHis Jean Valjean is a thing to behold. He can be rather theatrical early on, shouting and gesturing and such. But once he settles down, his quiet strength and humanity…\n\nVictor Hugo's Les Misérables is an incredible work of storytelling. In this 1934 film adaptation, Bernard takes advantage of the story when adapting it to the screen, forming it into a three-volume film epic that clocks in at four hours and forty minutes. It's incredible film making in every conventional department, to the point that it is surprising the film actually exists, and exists like this.\n\nLes Misérables is more than likely one of the greatest films of the 1930s, one of the greatest adaptations of classic literature, and one of the best films rooted heavily in Christian ideology. Although, the ideology expressed is simultaneously critical and subversive of religious dogma. Characters consistently engage in what could be described as…"
