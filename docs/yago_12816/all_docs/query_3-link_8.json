        "text": "Les Croix De Bois is a deeply moving portrait of a group of soldiers thrown together in the midst of World War I. To modern eyes its approach is familiar. We have seen this before – to follow a band of brothers through the trenches and gun-fire. It has become the standard mode of entry into the battlefield. Everything from Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now; countless others have taken this template. And because of this Les Croix De Bois loses some of the freshness it must have once possessed. But it remains a deeply moving and important war movie.\n\nThe film has two distinct halves. The first sees the arrival of the patriotic Demarchy (Pierre Blanchar) into the companionship…\n\n“What’s equality mean?”\n\n“It means you can tell anyone to go to hell!”\n\nHaven’t seen the original All Quiet on the Western Front, but Wooden Crosses, which was released a couple years later, seemed ahead of its time. It’s almost baffling. The sound and visual effects were so impressive. The documentary style camera work on the battlefield made me think it was all real. What a technical achievement!\n\nA patriotic new recruit joins a platoon of old hands and experiences the reality of life in the front line.\n\nI'm being as generic as possible here because the film really does fit in perfectly with war movies made decades afterwards with absolutely no real concessions to them. If it's not exactly 'Come and See' in it's brutality it can certainly be placed alongside say Paths of Glory or The Steel Helmet or Platoon and match them for the coherence of it's message and the power of it's set pieces.\n\nI don't know enough about the period to suggest it was the very first film of it's type but it's definitely writing a lot of rules for the war film as we know it (and indeed had it's action scenes re-used by American films of the 30s) and manages to tell a human story that entertains as well as horrifies.\n\n100 films to watch in 2016 #94/100\n\nletterboxd.com/owene73/list/100-films-to-watch-in-2016-1/\n\nStunning and harrowing. A wonderfully unglamorous, bleak, haunting portrait of WWI. The dread, trauma, banality, relentlessness and horrors of war — it's truly unflinching in its depictions of human waste. There are some terrific sequences and some incredibly eerie images. Battle sequences are so brilliant that you'd think they're archival footage. Bernard's direction is excellent and manages to strike a rhythm that is just sublime. Gets more powerful as it goes on. The ending is one of the most effectively harrowing ones I've seen in a war film. It just hits brutally hard and reminds you of the sheer meaningless of war.\n\n(One of the best films of 30s and also much better than both All Quiet on the Western Front and Westfront 1918)"
