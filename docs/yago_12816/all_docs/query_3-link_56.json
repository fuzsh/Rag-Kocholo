        "text": "Today, all-round filmmaker Josef von Sternberg (1894-1969) is best remembered as the man behind UFA’s first talking picture, “Der Blaue Engel” (1930, a.k.a. “The Blue Angel”), which launched the career of Marlene Dietrich. She played Lola-Lola, the seductive cabaret singer in top hat and silk stockings, who destroyed the life of an infatuated elderly professor, character played by Emil Jannings. The film was simultaneously shot in Berlin in German and English versions.\n\nBy that time, however, Mr. von Sternberg, who left his native Vienna at age seven, arrived in the U.S. in 1901, and had settled in Hollywood by 1924. He was already an established film director in America ever since he had made “The Salvation Hunters” (1925), the first time he demonstrated his own, groundbreaking and unique visual style and interplay of light and shade. The film was followed by another screen classic, “Underworld” (1926), Hollywood’s first gangster film.\n\nUnfortunately, some projects didn’t work out for various reasons—one of them being “The Sea Gull” (1926, a.k.a. “A Woman of the Sea”) which Charlie Chaplin asked him to direct as a comeback vehicle for Edna Purviance (Chaplin’s co-star in all his shorts and features from “A Night Out” in 1915 to “A Woman of Paris” eight years later). Mr. von Sternberg’s screenplay was a love story set in a fishing community on the California coast. After one private screening, Chaplin withdrew the film, shelved it, and it hasn’t been seen since, reportedly because he considered the film too sophisticated for general audiences.\n\nYet, for Mr. von Sternberg, the best was yet to come. During his peak years and most productive period of his career—at Paramount—from “Underworld” (1927) to “The Devil Is a Woman” (1935, the seventh and final film he made with Dietrich, whom he had transformed into a glamourous and sensual star), he became one of Hollywood’s greatest directors, storytellers, masters and technicians with screen classics as “The Case of Lena Smith” (1929, his final silent film), “Morocco” (1930), “Shanghai Express” (1932), “Blonde Venus” (1932) and “The Scarlet Empress” (1934). He published his autobiography “Fun in a Chinese Laundry” in 1965.\n\nHe is the father of Nicholas Josef von Sternberg (b. 1951), who has worked as a cinematographer from the mid-1970s to 2002 and whose films include “Texasville” (1990), directed by Peter Bogdanovich, and “Crime and Punishment” (2002) starring Vanessa Redgrave and John Hurt. I got to meet this kind and soft-spoken gentleman at his California home on a bright and sunny afternoon to talk about the work of the Sternberg family behind the camera, and as it turned out, our timing was even more perfect since I got to see with my very own eyes his incredible family archive which basically covers an entire century of filmmaking—give or take a few years.\n\nIt would be most inappropriate to refer to it purely as memorabilia: it’s his complete family history and film history of the past century at the same time. That’s what wat makes it so unique; there were no copies or anything, it was all original material—for anyone who grew up watching and admiring Mr. von Sternberg’s films, this was the stuff that dreams are made of. And I’m aware that I had only seen the tip of the iceberg.\n\nMr. Josef von Sternberg collected everything and he archived his own life, which his son had nicely stored in huge plastic boxes: there were numerous photographs from when he was a boy, also from the silent era, and a lot of them with him on the set of his films in the 1920s and 1930s; before he became a director in the mid-1920s, he traveled in Europe and there were his passports; his paintings, including a self-portrait—painting was a passion of his—and telegrams; contracts; letters; his address book; five press books that were professionaly put together for him with all news articles in American newspapers; audio recordings; cancelled checks from the banks; records of what he spent through the years; original silent film scripts, one of them written in Vienna in the Spring of 1922 and registered in 1923 for American copyright, another one bought by Mary Pickford in 1925; early scripts that weren’t produced; publicity stills; a huge amount of photo albums covering his whole life while every page of every album tells an incredible story on its own through hundreds (possibly thousands?) of stills that have never been published anywhere—and so much more, including material what we usually tend to discribe as ‘memorabilia.’\n\nAs I had said, the timing of our interview was perfect for me, as Mr. von Sternberg was about to donate his archive to the Academy Film Archive a couple of weeks later. I had the privilege to see some of it, and all I can say is that there are simply no words to express my gratitude to Mr. von Sternberg for sharing this precious history with me.\n\nDuring our meeting, we also took the time to talk about the careers of father and son.\n\nMr. von Sternberg, do you also have copies of your father’s films?\n\nI have a lot of his films, I have a couple of prints of “Anatahan” [1953], negatives and some soundtrack, and some 16mm films like “The Devil Is a Woman” [1935]. I also have “The Epic That Never Was” [1965], a really interesting BBC documentary of “I, Claudius” [unfinished film from 1937] narrated by Dirk Bogarde. They had interviewed a lot of people that were still alive—my father was still alive too, and there is also an interview with him. For “I, Claudius,” he went to London, and he worked on it, it was really an important project for him. It was the first film that he had been involved with after “The Devil Is a Woman” [1935] with a substantial amount of money, big stars, a wonderful set designer, a great cameraman. He had a really good crew on the film. [Producer] Alexander Korda had made a joke about Charles Laughton at a cocktail party, Laughton was very offended, and he decided to take his revenge by pretending to not know his lines on “I, Claudius,” and he sabotaged the film. But that doesn’t come out in the documentary; the only thing that does come out is that Merle Oberon had an accident, and they wrote off the film based on her. She played Messalina in the film, and so Korda canceled the project after four weeks of shooting. But there was a lot more film that existed at the time when the documentary was made. I don’t know where it is now, but I do know there was a lot more than what was seen in the documentary. My father also edited the film; he used to edit the previous week’s footage on weekends.\n\nWas that his working method? Editing his films during the weekends?\n\nWell, it was on that film; I don’t know about his other films. But he always knew what shots he was going to use, no matter how many takes he’d do. He didn’t shoot really from a lot of angles, only from a few angles, much less than most people commonly shoot from now. Since he knew what he was going to use, he could easily edit it on weekends or whenever he had the chance to. He was a good editor; he was an editor before he was a director. He had edited about a hundred one-reelers during the silent period. Of course, in those days, they edited with the negative; they didn’t print the positive, they just edited with the negative. He was a title writer too; he wrote titles for silent flms long before he was a director.\n\nHe was known to be an excellent craftsman and technician—he could have made a film entirely on his own.\n\n[Laughs]. I’m sure he would have loved to, but he always loved to work with his crew.\n\nDo you know if there were any particular crew members who were really important to him? The cinematographer maybe, because of his particular visual style?\n\nI don’t think so. You know, if you talk to different people, you hear different opinions. My dad claimed that he pretty much dominated the cinematography, and if you look at his films, he used really wonderful cameramen, like Lee Garmes, and Paul Ivano. But the look of his films is very consistent; it’s as if they were all shot by one cameraman. Normally if you use different cameramen, you get different results. But his films were very consistent—from film to film. So I can really relate to what he said that he dominated the cinematography completely. He probably told his cameramen what to do—set the angle, set the lighting. I know on one film he kicked the cameraman of the set, and he lit the set alone with the best boy. Maybe he was difficult to work with, I don’t know, but it could be that it was the only way to get the results that he wanted. Maybe he couldn’t communicate them clearly any other way than to do it himself.\n\nYour father was a perfectionist, wasn’t he, because his films are so perfectly made.\n\nYes, I think so. You can tell by his films.\n\nDid he in any way influence you and your work as a cinematographer?\n\nHe influenced me to a degree. I was raised on his films. I was on the set with him on “Anatahan” [1953] when I was two years old; I have a picture of him holding me up on the set. It’s hard to convey how much of an influence he had on me. The films I saw as a child were mostly his, although sometimes I saw other films too. But they had a really profound effect on me, although it’s hard to say what the effect was. I never directed films, I was only a cinematographer, so in working with other people I worked with the director, the set designers, the writers and the actors. But I didn’t have a chance to really direct a film. And it is different when you direct a film than it is to be a director of photography.\n\nHow did you work on your projects?\n\nIt depended on each film. I always read the script, thinking about the lighting and the angles that I could shoot from. The script was just a very basic document, and in my early films, I did a lot of work on the script too, much more than in my later films. A lot of the films I did were on location, so that’s different than working in a studio. I always loved to work in a studio and liked to build a set around the lighting which is exactly what my dad did. So to that degree, he influenced me, and I can just pick out different shots from films that I did and that were reminiscent of my father. But he did a lot of things that I couldn’t do. He used to light through nets—through netted material. I think he used to stretch a large net over the set, light through it, and he‘d burn out sections of the net. In a lot of his films, it looks like the lighting was done that way. He had the actors perform where the light was particularly just for them, and around them, everything would be darker to a degree. Since he worked in black and white, there’s a tremendous amount of control you have over the lighting. He used to spray aluminum to create a certain effect so one area would be brighter, and he also created a deeper shadow. There were a lot of tricks that he did. No one has ever recreated the look of his films, and I think it would be very difficult. Also, if you want to recreate it, you’d have to shoot in black and white because there is an infinity of brightness and darkness you can create with black and white that you can’t create with color. And your attention is also more drawn to the light in black and white, much more than in color. But nevertheless, it’s very interesting to work in color too. My father did one film in color, “Jet Pilot” [1957], but it’s relatively flat-looking compared to the beautiful work that he did in black and white. In silent films, he did a lot of interesting work in black and white, too—long before he worked with Dietrich.\n\nDoes his work in silent films still exist?\n\nSome films are lost, films that people looked for all over the world, but I’m sure that none will turn up at this point, because it’s been so long. In 1947 Curtis Harrington saw my dad’s last silent film, “The Case of Lena Smith” [1929], in the Paramount vault, but it doesn’t exist now. It would have been lost by now. Paramount rendered the film [laughs], that’s how they called it, to recover the silver from the film. They had a lot of films, and that means a lot of silver—that’s the problem with silver nitrate. And they didn’t think that the films would be seen again.\n\nWhat film do you consider his best work?\n\nI love “Anatahan” personally, because it was made after I was born, and I know how he worked on that film. He had created a chart [photograph at the top of this interview], a vertical chart with the actors on the top, the sequences on the side, and the legend indicates the basic emotions that the actors had to show. That’s one of the ways he conveyed to the actors what they had to feel. It’s a very complex chart, with all the props—it’s really unique [it hangs on the wall in the living room]. I’ve never seen this kind of work done in any other film. I still have everything on “Anatahan” here—the storyboards, the scripts, everything. Three scripts were used simultaneously when he made that film. I’m really proud of the work he did on “Anatahan,” and so was he. He narrated the film himself, and it has a special meaning to me to hear his voice.\n\n“Anatahan” (1953, trailer)\n\nUp until that time, did he always have carte blanche, or was there someone looking over his shoulder?\n\nI think he pretty much had carte blanche. When he did “The Salvation Hunters” [1925], I’m sure he had carte blanche because he did it independently, so he didn’t have any producers on that film. And when he did “Anatahan,” he had Japanese producers, and I don’t think they ever questioned what he was going to do. Also, when he worked at Paramount for people like Adolph Zukor and B.P. Schulberg, it was exactly the same. It goes back to 1927 when he did “Underworld,” and they had given him ten thousand dollars and a gold medal because the film was so successful. It made a lot of money for Paramount, and I heard that it saved the studio, but I don’t know if that is true. In the beginning, Paramount thought that the public would react negatively to the film because it was a gangster movie. It was released in New York without any advance publicity, and people ran out of the theater when it was shown to tell their friends about it, and by the end of the first showing, there was a line around the block. It became the first film to keep a movie theater open all night. After that, he was really pretty popular at Paramount—popular in the sense that he could do what he wanted to do. I don’t think they would have interfered with what he wanted to do. There’s no evidence that they did.\n\nWhat was his relationship with Paramount like, working with Adolph Zukor, B.P. Schulberg and Jesse L. Lasky?\n\nHe didn’t really think about them or about working with them. They only had to approve everything that he did, and I think they did.\n\nWilliam Wellman Jr. once said to me that his father loved working at the studios because he didn’t have to worry about the sets, they were built by the best set designers, and when he had to begin shooting on Monday morning, the sets would always be ready.\n\nWilliam A. Wellman’s sets were very different from my father’s sets, but he had the same art director on all his films—Hans Dreier. He had so many people that ran the art department that worked with him, and his sets were so elaborate, like in “Shanghai Express” [1932]. When the train comes through the station… do you remember that scene? It’s so incredible.\n\nOn the other hand, he was also very much at ease on a more intimate film like “Blonde Venus” [1932].\n\nYes, but that film I would consider pretty wild with the gorilla suit that Marlene Dietrich comes out of in the beginning [laughs]. “Blonde Venus” had wonderful sets, too—the doors were built very strangely; they had shutters on them that had different angles. You never see any kind of a set similar to that. It was all built just for him, the sets were so impressive, it’s just impossible to imagine anybody else working that way, and “Blonde Venus” is a perfect example of that: if you think about the sets, they look simple, but they’re really pretty elaborate.\n\nDo you know how he did his homework in the evening or during the weekends to prepare the scenes he had to shoot the next day? I suppose long days, long hours?\n\nHis nickname at Paramount was ‘Midnight Joe’ because he kept the crews working from early morning till midnight. That was his reputation; he liked to work long hours. That’s probably one of the reasons that they unionized in the early 1930s because of directors just like him. He liked to work very long hours, he didn’t like to be questioned, he preferred complete silence when he worked, and he demanded a lot from the crew.\n\nBut in the end, you can see the result on the screen.\n\nDefinitely. Defintely great results. But he had a reputation of being difficult to work with, and I think that he was difficult to work with. It wasn’t a lot of fun to work with him, but it must have been very rewarding. For “The Devil Is a Woman,” the crew gave him a piece of carved ivory as a thank you, with everybody’s name on it. There’s no doubt that he was a highly respected film director. And he did his films rather fast. “The Scarlet Empress” had a five-week shooting schedule, and he didn’t do too many shots, only like one hundred and fifty or two hundred. That isn’t very much compared to modern films, which have thousands of shots.\n\nAnd he will also be remembered as the man who discovered Marlene Dietrich and turned her into one of the most popular screen stars ever.\n\nYou know, Emil Jannings apparently argued a lot with my father when they made “The Blue Angel.” He didn’t want her to play the part. Nobody wanted her, except my father, and he had to pretend to leave Berlin, otherwise, they wouldn’t let him use Dietrich. He got in his car and drove to the airport, and then they got after him and told him he could have Dietrich. But nobody wanted her, and Jannings tried to sabotage the film. He told her that nobody would ever see the film, that she would be forgotten. But she was wonderful in the film. After “The Blue Angel,” my father sent a telegram to B.P. Schulberg telling him she was a wonderful actress, and he wanted to bring her to the United States to do more work.\n\n“The Blue Angel” (1930, trailer)\n\nHow did you enter the film business? How did it all start for you?\n\nWhen I studied at UCLA, I was seventeen, and I wanted to direct, without really knowing what exactly a director did. I used to shoot everybody’s film, I seemed to have a very good eye [laughs] and I was very mechanical, meaning I was good with cameras and with lighting. So I shot about sixty or seventy films when I was at UCLA, and because of that I became a cameraman. I didn’t try to become a cameraman; it just happened. I shot my first film when I was twenty-one, it was called “Dolemite,” a very well-known black-and-white film, shot in 35mm. It’s got a cult following; people are still watching it. Now it just seems so improbable that I would become a cameraman, but back then, there were really a lot of opportunities for independent cameramen. So when it was just independent filmmaking, I had nothing to do with the union. I didn’t actually get into the union until about ten years later. As a matter of fact, I tried when I first started out shooting films to get into the union and tried to work at Universal as a cameraman, and the head of the camera department at Universal wanted me to work there. But the other two gentlemen that were on the qualifying committee, which the union had at that time didn’t think I was ready to work in the union as a cameraman. So they didn’t hire me. But I eventually got in, and I actually didn’t work in the union till I did “Texasville” [1990] for Peter Bogdanovich.\n\nDid you get out of your career what you hoped for?\n\nNo, I didn’t. I had a very strange reason for stopping. I made a film for a Canadian company, and they were pretty good for me when I was in Canada, but when they came back to the United States, they wanted to do one more day of shooting here, and they didn’t pay the crew. There were about thirty of us. I was so offended, and I thought that if I wasn’t going to get paid at that point in my life—I was almost fifty—I decided I wanted to do something else, so I went into teaching, and that’s what I still do. Special education, with children that are learning disabled at high school. It’s something completely different, but my mother [Meri Otis Wilner] was a professor—a lecturer—and my father also really enjoyed teaching. He taught at USC and UCLA for a couple of years, and my cousins are both teachers. I love teaching; it’s a full-time job. I work till three, then it takes me about an hour and a half to get back home. I’m also a pilot. I enjoy flying, I have my own plane, so that takes a lot of time and energy. It would be different if I were retired, then I could look at all of these boxes more carefully.\n\nHave you ever been in touch with Marlene Dietrich’s daughter Maria Riva?\n\nNo, I’ve never really been in touch with her, but I was friends with Marlene’s grandson J. Michael Riva who passed away [1948-2012]. I’m friends with another one of the Rivas, J. David Riva, who did the documentary. I’ve also been in touch with Peter Riva recently. Dietrich’s grandsons are very interesting; particularly Michael, he really remembered Marlene well, he knew her well. I knew her a little bit. When my father attended a film retrospective in Locarno [Switzerland] in 1960, Marlene was there too and they were very friendly together—they stayed in touch until he died—and as a little boy, I used to sit on Marlene’s lap. She always used to send me letters—envelopes—from all over the world because I collected stamps as a child. I still have all of those envelopes.\n\nDo you go through the boxes with your father’s material from time to time?\n\nSometimes I do, but I’m not an archivist. The problem is that I got other interests too. Those boxes are all very interesting to me, but it’s impossible to go through them alone. I’m just not an archivist. And there’s so much—and I have my mother’s stuff too. I have another house in Llano, which is only known for being the home of Aldous Huxley. It’s in the desert, and even though it’s in California, it is in the middle of nowhere—that’s my home, actually, because this one is just temporary—where I also got material, and I brought five boxes back the day before yesterday; they are magazines that my father collected. When my father died in 1969, my mother packed everything up. And she died a few years ago—I took care of her during the last six years of her life. Since then, I’ve looked through these boxes very carefully now and then, but I can’t really do anything with them. I’m too close to them. The Academy Film Archive has wanted them for many years, and I promised that I would turn over the material, but on the other hand, it’s just difficult to let go of. I was eighteen when he died, and I was very close to my parents.\n\nDo you still remember the house where he used to live?\n\nYes, it was a one-bedroom mansion in Northridge [10000 Tampa Avenue], made of steel, aluminum and glass, built in 1933. From the sky, you could see JS, his initials. The house was torn down by the owner in 1971 or 1972. So it still existed when I was young, and I have been there. Ruth Hill had lived there; she was a well-known writer. There’s a middle school now where his house was.\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nMarch 24, 2019\n\n1.
