        "text": "Bernard has lived an interesting yet challenging life, having been plagued with severe illnesses and even getting close to death at an early age. He first came into contact with the court in his youth by chance, but an unnamed benefactor then helped him find medical assistance with experts from all around the world.\n\nBernard's life journey thus allowed him to get a closer look into the world of the rich and famous. He never lost contact with the people that he met along the way and used the opportunity to learn more about the proper etiquette of different countries.\n\nAt the tender age of 16, Bernard received an invitation from the Grand Ducal court for a fitting of his first swallow-tailed coat. While even the smallest size was still way too big, Grand Duke Jean ensured that he only needed to grow into it over time. Once the suit fitted, Bernard was allowed to take on his first position at the court.\n\nIn May 1975, Bernard received his first official position in the service of the Grand Duke at the age of 17. While he was already well-versed in etiquette, Bernard also missed out on basic education due to his struggles will illness. He thus went to evening classes until 1986 and received several diplomas. Furthermore, he also worked in a clothing store and at a bank for a brief period.\n\nBernard received his first uniform in 1980 and his first gala uniform in 1987, which officially made him an intendant in the service of the Grand Ducal family. He was in charge of all personnel working at the court until 2019, except for those hired by the hospitality school. \"At times there were three teachers from the hospitality school, as well as students, helping out on special occasions like national day, state visits, or external celebrations\", explains Bernard.\n\nHe also still remembers the biggest dinner that he ever helped organise: \"It was huge. Everyone received little microphones to help us communicate and we managed to serve 6,500 people in two minutes and ten seconds.\"\n\nBy now, Bernard's life has become much more quiet. He no longer works at the court, but still teaches lessons on etiquette and even works as a waiter from time to time. He retained all of his experiences with the help of journals, which allowed him to write the aforementioned book on etiquette. His daughter further helped bring Bernard's work to life with the help of illustrations.\n\nVide report in Luxembourgish"
