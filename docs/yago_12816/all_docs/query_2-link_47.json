        "text": "I feel like the words “take part” (parties) are doing a lot of work here.\n\nThe film is CONTE CRUEL, a silent 1930 long-short (34 mins) which is the only film directed by Gaston Modot, France’s most psychotronic actor of his generation (from L’AGE D’OR to THE TESTAMENT OF DR. CORDELIER). It’s based on The Torture of Hope by Auguste de Villiers L’Isle D’Adam from the collection Contes Cruels, hence the title. It’s the main example of an actually cruel tale in that collection, some of whose entries are more weird or fantastical than plain cruel, and a good thing too — pure meanness can get monotonous, as Sade could tell/show you.\n\nI recently discovered Jan Svankmajer’s THE PIT, THE PENDULUM, AND HOPE (1983), which grafts this story onto Poe’s (you know which one I mean and while I’m here, RIP Roger Corman) to excellent effect. I always felt that the Poe story wasn’t exactly a complete story, just two good scary scenes/images which didn’t even necessarily belong in the same work, roughly carpentered together and then thrust at the reader with a slight wince. The ADVLIDA story is more like a real narrative, but the second act is thin (acceptable in a short story where the big finish is more crucial). Svankmajer really creates the dreamed-of latent form of both stories by suturing them together — the story with no second act is joined to the one with no first or third act.\n\nModot is Mr. Intensity. And surprisingly this translates into his work behind the camera too — TESTAMENT OF JOAN OF ARC vibes, not including the constant close shots, but every composition is splendidly overwrought and quite a bit of it is close-up. Handheld shots, too, used excessively for more than mere dynamic chaos (see the battle scenes in that other JEANNE D’ARC, the Gastynne one, or Bernard’s LES MISERABLES) — Modot is getting at a more personal, individual instability in his anguished wobbles.\n\nThe intent is certainly different from Dreyer’s, since this tale could be called anticlerical (it’s not strictly anti-clerical to admit that the Inquisition existed, it’s just recognising historical fact, but then maybe recognising historical fact IS anti-clerical…)\n\nI was admiring the big torture chamber set when I noticed the head inquisitor’s breath misting in the air and realised that it’s a real location, though one hopes (that word again) that the instruments of cruelty (that other word again) have been shipped in as dressing. And this is confirmed when Modot attempts his escape, and the cell expands to include the whole world, an illimitable Gormenghast of church-state architecture stretching to infinity.\n\nIn the story, the poor victim is Jewish, I think, a rabbi. Here, he’s some kind of unspecified heretic, so it’s arguable that Modot has flipped the whole story in a dubious way — torturing heretics is easier to sell than torturing Jews, especially when the torture is “only” psychological. Is this going to be a stealth Catholic tract?\n\nThrough expressionistically lit dungeons worthy of Piranesi, Modot’s camera stalks his fright-wigged protagonist — who is Modot himself, self-stalked like Keaton in Beckett’s FILM, his Karloffian features aglimmer with agitation and terror. Subjective camera, shadowplay, suspenseful intercutting, trick effects which insert us into the protag’s anguished imagination, it’s full of coups de cinema, piled on thick. Modot may have abandoned directing with the feeling that he’d exhausted his trickbox.\n\nAbove, Modot feels a monk clutch his shoulder, then realises he’s merely snagged his rags on an outcrop.\n\nIt’s a story with the same kind of final snap as Bierce’s An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge or Gilliam’s BRAZIL — curiously, this moment is the one not-quite-fumbled but arguably undersold by Modot. But he takes care to make clear how the trick was pulled, with a lot of detail the original author left out, and the sadism of the whole venture is emphasised, so that ultimately the piece is faithful in spirit to the original. God wins, but God’s a bastard.\n\nPoor Modot — his silent emerged at just the wrong time, when talkies finally began production in France. Given his dramatic training I see no reason why he couldn’t have made it as a big director in sound-eea films, but his calling card was obsolete before he got a chance to flourish it.\n\nOne of Conrad Veidt’s relatively few French films, LE JOUER D’ECHECS (THE CHESS PLAYER, aka THE DEVIL IS AN EMPRESS, 1938) is a remake of a Raymond Bernard original which, disgracefully, I’ve yet to see. I would rather see it on the big screen but I don’t know when THAT’S likely to happen.\n\nI owe the director, Jean Dréville, an unpaid debt, since big chunks of his groundbreaking behind-the-scenes documentary AUTOUR DE L’ARGENT are used in NATAN.\n\nAs feature director, he has good and bad points. Bits of this films are spectacularly overdirected in the best possible way, with the camera rushing up to people, repeatedly, like Sam Raimi’s happy dog, and all the stuff with Veidt’s mechanical men (as we all know from THIEF OF BAGDAD, he was a very skilled autonomist, a regular Coppelius or Dr. Phibes) is wonderfully uncanny.\n\nDréville then, was touched with genius, and his documenting of L’Herbier’s financial crisis epic L’ARGENT confirms this. But this was his tenth film, and you’d think by this time he’d have learned about eyelines. But not only do his closeups not match, so that his distinguished cast (Françoise Rosay and Gaston Modot also appear) seem to be continually staring off into space rather than at one another, but he arbitrarily intercuts, say, a profile of Veidt and a full-face view of Rosay, gaining nothing but visual chaos from the experiment.\n\nWhere was la script-girl?\n\nHowever, despite the headslapping moments which are frequent, there are enough genuine whoahs — and I don’t think they’re all slavish copies of Bernard’s original — to make me keen to try more of his rather flamboyant cinema.\n\nBut I should see the Raymond Bernard first."
