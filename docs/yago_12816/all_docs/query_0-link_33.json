Scripted and directed by Raymond Bernard, it stars Harry Baur as Jean Valjean, Charles Vanel as Javert, and Josseline Gaël as Fantine. Initially released as three films that premiered over three consecutive weeks,[citation needed] Une tempête sous un crâne (Tempest in a Skull), Les Thénardier (The Thenardiers), and Liberté, liberté chérie (Freedom, dear Freedom), the full, unedited film clocks in at 281 minutes.\n\nQuick Facts Les Misérables, Directed by ...\n\nLes MisérablesDirected byRaymond BernardWritten byRaymond Bernard\n\nAndré LangBased onLes Misérables\n\n1862 novel\n\nby Victor HugoProduced byRaymond Borderie\n\nBernard NatanStarringHarry Baur\n\nCharles Vanel\n\nJosseline GaëlCinematographyJules KrugerMusic byArthur Honegger\n\nProduction\n\ncompany\n\nDistributed byPathé-Natan\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n281 minutesCountryFranceLanguageFrench\n\nClose\n\nIt is considered by critics to be the greatest adaptation of the novel, due to its in-depth development of the themes and characters, in comparison with most shorter adaptations.[1][2][3] Although produced by Pathé, filming took place on a specially constructed set in Biot, Alpes-Maritimes as well as the nearby Victorine Studios in Nice, as opposed to the company's Joinville Studios in Paris. Sets were designed by Lucien Carré and Jean Perrier, with music by eminent Swiss composer Arthur Honegger.\n\nJean Valjean is an ex-convict struggling to redeem himself, but his attempts are continually ruined by the intrusion of Javert. Javert is a cruel, ruthless police inspector who has dedicated his life to pursuing Valjean, whose only crime was stealing a loaf of bread, for which he received 5 years in jail. He serves an additional 14 years for escape attempts.\n\nThe film, like the novel, features numerous other characters and subplots, such as Fantine, a woman forced into prostitution to pay two cruel innkeepers, the Thénardiers, for looking after her daughter Cosette, and the story of the revolutionaries, including Marius Pontmercy, a young man who falls in love later on in the film with the now-adult Cosette.\n\nHarry Baur as Jean Valjean & Champmathieu\n\nCharles Vanel as Javert\n\nFlorelle as Fantine\n\nJosseline Gaël as Cosette\n\nGaby Triquet as Cosette (child)\n\nJean Servais as Marius\n\nOrane Demazis as Éponine\n\nGilberte Savary as Éponine (child)\n\nLucien Nat as Montparnasse\n\nCharles Dullin as Thénardier\n\nMarguerite Moreno as Madame Thénardier\n\nÉmile Genevois as Gavroche\n\nRobert Vidalin as Enjolras\n\nHenry Krauss as Monseigneur Myriel\n\nDenise Mellot as Azelma\n\nJacqueline Fermez as Azelma (child)\n\nCailloux as Mabeuf\n\nGinette d'Yd as Sister Simplice\n\nPierre Piérade as Bamatabois\n\nCharlotte Barbier-Krauss as Toussaint\n\nRoland Armontel as Félix Tholomyès\n\nThe film is, for the most part, faithful to the original novel, however, there are some differences:\n\nJavert is presented as considerably less sympathetic than in the book, largely portraying him as the pinnacle of the cruelty in 19th century France.\n\nValjean is released after having saved a house from caving in, not because his time is served.\n\nNot Fantine's last, but her first evening with Tholomyès is shown.\n\nValjean's re-arrest after his escape from Montreuil's prison and escape from the \"Orion\" are omitted.\n\nValjean and Cosette's stay at the Gorbeau House, their dodging of Javert and their arrival at the Petit-Picpus convent are omitted. After they leave the Thénardiers, the film jumps to Cosette's sixteenth birthday.\n\nCosette and Marius are already lovers before the attack on Valjean in the Gorbeau House.\n\nMarius is already acquainted with Éponine and Gavroche before the attack at Gorbeau House.\n\nWhen Marius notifies Javert of the Thénardiers' plans, he is also able to give Javert Valjean's address, at least one of them. Javert comes to this address after the robbery and recognises Valjean there. Valjean has to flee to his other house, where he finds Marius and Cosette. After Marius reveals what he has done, expecting gratitude, Valjean sends him away. Only Cosette's pleas make him change his mind, but only after Marius left.\n\nValjean does not meet Thénardier in the sewers.\n\nValjean presents himself to Gillenormand when taking Marius home. Gillenormand, Marius and Cosette have therefore always known the identity of Marius' saviour.\n\nValjean dies shortly after his confession to Marius, the day after the wedding, due to a wound which appeared to have become infected (probably due to the sewer water). He does not describe Fantine to Cosette.\n\nThe film has been referred to as \"the most complete and well rounded adaptation of Victor Hugo's classic novel\". [citation needed]\n\nA contemporary review in The Spectator was exceptionally positive, calling the film \"the best French picture seen here for many months.\" In particular, it praised Harry Baur's \"remarkable performance\" and lauded the film for managing to distill such a lengthy novel into its key components without coming across as disjointed.[4]\n\nRaymond Bernard's version of Les Misérables, along with various other films about 18th and 19th century France, supported an exhibition of French drawings held in 2010 at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. The exhibition was entitled David to Cézanne: master drawings from the Prat Collection, Paris and ran from 22 September until 5 December 2010.[5][6] The film was screened 30 October,[6] 3 November and 7 November in the Gallery's Domain Theatre.\n\nThe Criterion Collection released a restored version of Les Misérables in their Eclipse DVD line. Its three parts appeared alongside Bernard's Wooden Crosses (1932) in the Eclipse Series 4: Raymond Bernard collection (2007). This version, totalling 281 minutes (109:52, 85:21 and 86:36), is shorter than the reported 305 minute total runtime of the original release, though it is possible that time may be inaccurate, or includes brief intermissions no longer present.[7] Criterion's DVD liner notes describe how the film was reissued at varying lengths over the following decades and was only restored to its approximate original length shortly before Bernard's death, minus some scenes that could not be recovered.\n\nIn 2013, Pathé carried out a brand new restoration of the film, totalling 289 minutes (115:39, 85:45 and 87:23), and released it on Blu-ray and DVD. Eureka Entertainment also released this version on Blu-ray and DVD in 2014, as part of their Masters of Cinema line.[8]\n\nAdaptations of Les Misérables\n\nList of longest films by running time\n\n\"Review: Les Misérables (1934)\".
