        "text": "It took film-makers years to bring the Vietnam war into focus and produce movies like The Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now. Similarly, half a century earlier, nearly a decade elapsed after the first world war before US and European directors felt capable of tackling the subject. The cycle began with a great film of the silent era, King Vidor’s The Big Parade (1925), and continued into the sound era with Lewis Milestone’s celebrated anti-war All Quiet on the Western Front (1930).\n\nLess sentimental than All Quiet, and surprisingly little known outside France, Les Croix de bois (Wooden Crosses), now revived in a restored centennial version, is one of the most important war movies. Made in 1932 by Raymond Bernard between his two most famous pictures (the silent costume drama The Chess Player and his classic five-hour version of Les Misérables), Wooden Crosses was based on an autobiographical novel by the war veteran Roland Dorgelès (pipped at the post for the 1921 Prix Goncourt by Proust). The producer, Bernard Natan, put the resources of his Pathé studio behind the project, aiming to make audiences “hate and despise war”. Natan was given the freedom of Pathé’s new sound department to create authentic recordings of explosions, rifle fire and the chatter of machine guns – what he called “the reconstitution of the sonic ambience of the battles”. These scenes of brutal combat were recreated on war-torn locations in the Champagne region, and in the course of filming, corpses and other military debris were regularly exposed by the accidental ignition of unexploded shells left over from the conflict.\n\nDorgelès insisted that every actor have combat experience, including platoon corporal Charles Vanel (later to play Javert in Les Misérables) and the matinee idol Pierre Blanchar (gassed at Verdun in 1916). Blanchar plays a middle-class conscript joining the seasoned 30th Infantry Division in a frontline trench. Filmed largely at night in the mud and dust of battle, with an all-male cast speaking military slang, and a soundtrack of natural sound, spine-chilling ordnance and incidental music, Wooden Crosses is an intense experience of pain, stoic endurance and survival. As late as 1962, after the film’s first TV screening, a veteran committed suicide, overwhelmed by reliving the horrors of the first world war."
