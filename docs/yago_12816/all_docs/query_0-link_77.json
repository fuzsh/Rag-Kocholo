        "text": "I’ve been meaning to do this thing for a while. It’s kind of like @ellie-valsin‘s Every Ami Ever series but going at it the other way around.\n\n(Also I can’t do as many adaptations because I haven’t seen as many.) You get a different perspective when you look at them in context and secondly I thought it’d be worth it to talk about their depictions as a group. They do often have a sort of group identity in adaptations (and in the Brick too actually).\n\nSo the plan is to go through all the adaptations I’ve seen that have any named Amis other than Enjolras. Most of this will be subjective, but that’s the nature of these kinds of things.\n\n(omg look at these nerds ❤ they wrote their name on the wall)\n\nLes Amis in Les Mis ‘34, the French movie trilogy thing:\n\nThese guys are adorable. They don’t really have very distinct personalities but they’re very passionate and excitable, they’re always laughing and they sing A LOT. (They might even give the musical Amis a run for their money in the singing front…) They’re also very obviously close and very affectionate with each other in that sort of 19th century way from before the masculinity police started hunting down men who dare to express their feelings openly.\n\nTheir military tactics could use some work though. Maybe don’t actually blow up your own barricade? And please, please, take some cover when you’re being shot at. It helps you stay alive.\n\nSpecific Amis: (In order of introduction)\n\nEnjolras, Lesgle, Courfeyrac, Grantaire, Combeferre (mentioned), Feuilly (mentioned), Prouvaire\n\nThere’s a whole bunch of Amis in this (a lot more than nine) but only some of them get names and even fewer have significant lines or personalities. Combeferre and Feuilly are named while they’re off screen but you can kind of deduce which ones they are based on the seating when Enjolras addresses everyone by name. (Plus the guy I think is Combeferre sings the Caesar song, another clue.)\n\n^ This Enjolras is very physically affectionate with everybody.\n\n^ It took me a while to learn to tell Courf and Lesgle apart: they look SO similar to me.\n\n^ Possibly!Combeferre singing (seen here clearly being played by the Tenth Doctor passing through 1930′s France.)\n\n^ I think the one in the middle is Feuilly because Enjolras just said his name and still has his hand on his shoulder (because of course) but it’s impossible to tell really.\n\nMore about their personalities (those who have them) under the cut:\n\nThe only ones who get any proper lines are Enjolras (of course), Grantaire and Courfeyrac. The latter two are both pretty OOC: Courfeyrac acts more like Combeferre and gets Combeferre’s lines, although he DOES have Courfeyrac’s pyromaniac tendencies turned up to eleven (he “””likes fireworks”””), and Grantaire acts more like Courfeyrac?? Kind of?? Except he still has a massive crush on Enjolras, I swear.\n\n^ To be fair, Courfeyrac does get one actual Courfeyrac moment, trying to convince Mabeuf to go home.\n\nGrantaire is easily the most prominent out of the Amis right after Enjolras. It seems like the writers really wanted to have one particularly memorable Ami who wasn’t Enjolras so they gave almost all the scenes and lines to one of them and then they picked Grantaire for the role because… err??? The element of surprise??? Idk. He actually even gets the OFPD scene which makes no sense when he’s never been an unbeliever but… well he’s very charming in it anyway so I guess it works??? (Not really, but I still like the scene.)\n\nHe doesn’t drink any more than the other Amis (actually I don’t think he’s shown drinking at all). His only actual Grantaire trait is that he’s definitely still in love with Enjolras.\n\nEnjolras is… fine. I mean I like him and he has some really good moments but… he just has very little personality aside from being The Revolutionary Leader? He almost comes across as sort of a Father To His Men archetype… well, less of a father and more like an older brother but ykwim. There’s nothing particularly wrong with him as an Enjolras (aside from maybe a few weird tactical choices) but he lacks a lot of specific Enjolras traits.\n\nHe does have amazing Hair though. Ellie Valsin called him Wild Hair Enjolras which is an appropriate description. The Hair IS his character. The Hair is practically a character in its own right.\n\nIt might be just me but Courf and Lesgle look a LOT like each other so I have some trouble telling them apart in this movie a lot of the time. But I’m fairly sure Courf is the one who gets more lines out of the two of them and his lines are more significant. I think Lesgle mostly just stands guard at the barricades while Grantaire takes over most of his role and personality too. (This Grantaire is such a personality thief.) Somehow Lesgle is still the fourth most prominent Ami but that’s not saying much: I’ve still occasionally forgotten that he even exists in this. And mostly his job is to keep Éponine out of the barricade until she dresses up as a guy… >__>;; (Yeah I mostly love this movie but I really don’t appreciate this scene.)\n\nI do generally like these guys though, OOC or not. They make up for it by being really entertaining and lovable. I think they’re like many things in this adaptation: not exactly faithful to the word of the Brick but to the idea yes.\n\nThey might not be Enjolras, Combeferre, Prouvaire, Feuilly, Courfeyrac, Bahorel, Lesgle, Joly and Grantaire but they ARE Les Amis de l’ABC, if you know what I mean?\n\nLes Mis 1934 Shadow Group Watch!\n\nLong story short: this little movie trilogy is a classic of French cinema, it’s great and you should watch it. Even if you don’t do the group watch, seriously, WATCH IT. Here, I’ll even give you a link with the subtitle files and everything.\n\nUnfortunately, as @timegoddessrose pointed out earlier, some of the scenes have been lost which is a huge shame but even despite that it still works really well.\n\nPlanned schedule:\n\nPART 1: Une tempête sous un crâne (Tempest in a Skull) March 11th\n\nPART 2: Les Thénardier (The Thenardiers) March 18th\n\nPART 3: Liberté, liberté chérie (Freedom, dear Freedom) March 25th\n\nThe essential stuff:\n\nThe Shadow Watch happens on Saturdays at 10pm GMT\n\nWe’ll watch one part per week over three consecutive Saturdays (each part is roughly 1½ hours + possible intermission)\n\nThe films are in French with English subtitles\n\nThe meeting “place” is the group watch Slack team (Team Shoujo Cosette)\n\nContact me if you want to join in! And please do so before Saturday! You can reach me on Tumblr or by email: teamshoujocosette[at]mail.com\n\nGroup Watch FAQ is here if you have more questions (or you can just ask me)\n\nAnd as usual: EVERYBODY IS WELCOME!\n\nSome extra notes for this week:\n\nI’m looking for someone to take over for me in organizing the Shadow Watch because it’s just a bit too much for me to try and run both of these as it turns out. So if anybody’s interested in keeping the shadow watch going, let me know! (Because otherwise I’ll probably have to let it go. Sorry…)\n\nIt doesn’t have to be too much work and you can do it in whatever way you like or just copy my approach, whatever. You can still use the Slack and I can upload a whole bunch of adaptations for you all to choose from and I’ll reblog your posts etc. (You can even tweak the time a bit to fit your schedule better as long as it’s still a time that suits people.)\n\nAND relatedly, due to popular demand, we’re keeping the main group watch as a weekly event after all so there WILL be a normal 5pm GMT group watch this week. Maybe it’ll mean both groups are gonna have a smaller attendance but I guess we’ll have to live with that. This week’s group watch will be hosted by @shellcollector and (spoiler alert) it’s supposed to be Newsies."
