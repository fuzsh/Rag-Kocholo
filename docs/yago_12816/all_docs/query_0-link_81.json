        "text": "We are now halfway through the BBC’s adaptation of Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables. The third episode of the six-part drama was aired on BBC One last Sunday evening. After its first episode, aired on December 30, 2018, many viewers and journalists in Britain were bemused at the lack of singing. Much of the population in the U.K. associate Les Misérables with the musical adaption, due to the popularity of the musical and the latest film starring Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe, forgetting the extraordinary original 1862 novel by the French author Victor Hugo.\n\nThere has, of course, been many adaptations of the novel, particularly in France. Raymond Bernard’s 1934 four-hour version, with the great Harry Baur playing Jean Valjean, is the most well-loved by cinephiles. The mini-series that aired on the French TV channel TF1 in 2000, starring Gérard Depardieu and John Malkovich, was also very popular in France. In my view, these two adaptations are the best rendition of Victor Hugo’s novel. Silent film lovers should also check out Albert Capellani’s 1912 version in four parts. For the moment, the new BBC version fairs well.\n\nThis new BBC version was written by screenwriter Andrew Davies, who had adapted Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice for the BBC in 1995. His latest BBC mini-series was an adaptation of War and Peace which received mixed reviews. According to the Daily Telegraph, Davies claimed that he wanted to rescue Hugo’s Les Misérables “from the clutches of that awful musical with its doggerel lyrics.”\n\nSo far, Davies’ adaptation has stayed more or less faithful to the novel. Condensing such a huge book into six hours is a difficult task, and the BBC version achieves it without taking too many liberties. Back in 1995, some viewers had been shocked by the scene in Pride and Prejudice in which Mr. Darcy had jumped into a lake, and some felt consternation when incest was suggested in the adaptation of War and Peace.\n\nThis version of Les Misérables makes you want to pick up the book itself and (re)read it. This is perhaps because something is missing. It illustrates the cruelty that is described in the book, but the novel is much more about the injustices of society that bring misery to people’s lives because they are powerless to prevent them. No adaptation will ever be a true match to Victor Hugo’s way with words that awake such profound emotions. Davies’ adaptation is good, so far, but it glides on the surface of the plot, instead of delving deep into the characters’ stories. This is perhaps too difficult to achieve in six hours.\n\nThe mini-series balances well the different complex storylines that are due to intertwine. The first episode had introduced Jean Valjean, played by Dominic West, the merciless Javert, played by David Oyelowo, and Fantine, played by Lily Collins. Locked up for stealing a loaf of bread, Jean Valjean is unable to find work after his release from prison. It is his meeting with Bishop Myriel, played here by Derek Jacobi, who gives him a second chance, that will lead him to the path of redemption. Javert is introduced as Jean Valjean’s antagonist, and Fantine is portrayed as a young woman falling in love with a man who leaves her as she falls pregnant. The bleakness of the story is made palpable in the second episode which shows Fantine’s descent into misery. Lily Collins’ performance as Fantine, the young woman who is surpassed by circumstances and society, is heart-wrenching. The third episode was just as engrossing as the first two parts, in which we discover the extent of the Thénardiers’ cruelty toward Fantine’s daughter Cosette. The next three episodes are bound to be just as captivating in telling Victor Hugo’s epic novel.\n\nThe next three episodes are due to air on BBC One in the following Sunday nights. It will be available to watch in the U.K. on the BBC iPlayer for over a year. The six-part drama will premiere in the U.S. on Sunday, April 14, 2019, on Masterpiece on PBS."
