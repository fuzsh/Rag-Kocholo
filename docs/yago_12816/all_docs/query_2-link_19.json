My French is famously bad, but I think it means 'honest' in the sense of 'upright'. I'd also say it has connotations of 'old-fashioned', 'bourgeois', perhaps 'conservative' and so on, but I am not fully sure about it.

He even describes this method somewhat jokingly in his preface to \"Slow Learner\" (and for the record: Joyce did exactly the same sort of 'research' for \"Finnegans Wake\") Now that he has the wikipedia available, it's all gotten over the top of course. But I love \"Against the Day\" (and all the other books) nevertheless. The art is not in the 'intelligence', but in the way he juxtaposes things and ideas to make you see previously unthought-of connections, his use of language, but foremost in his humanity and individuality. I can't think of any other writer who even comes close to Pynchon nowadays both in style and in daring. If this guy doesn't make you think about politics and society, nothing else will. And he's dead funny on top of it. Even if some of the songs are not necessarily better than Schreck's Bernardian ode.\n\nQuote\n\n#131 Post by gubbelsj » Mon Jan 07, 2008 9:02 pm\n\nHaving watched Wooden Crosses back-to-back with Ichikawa's Fires on the Plain within the past week, I'm on a serious downer kick. As others have noted, the special effects and battle sequences within this film are astonishing, and I also found Bernard's use of sound to be quite effective, especially when creating suspense (such as the sequence involving tunneling under the trenches). There's an impressive control of the medium for so early a sound film. And I was struck by the way Bernard draws viewers into his film. The opening moments suggest this may be just another war picture, featuring a regiment filled with colorful characters exuding bravery and nobility. It's easy to get comfortable. But when the picture moves into a much bleaker trajectory, there was a conscious desire on my part to adjust, to re-think my attitude towards the characters. Fires on the Plain begins in despair, with a barely-conscious soldier getting slapped in the face, and only goes downhill from there. But Wooden Crosses fools you, leads the viewer on, and finally ends with a devastating calmness that was in many ways even more disturbing than the horrific final moments in Ichikawa. A major discovery for me, and a fantastic movie experience.\n\nQuote\n\n#132 Post by tryavna » Tue Jan 08, 2008 5:20 pm\n\nHas anyone else noticed this yet?

It didn't help that The World Moves On nearly put me to sleep. One bizarre choice was the use of a severely truncated version of the 'soldiers marching in the sky' shot, so that you barely notice (and quite probably are not meant to notice) the superimposition.\n\nQuote\n\n#135 Post by tryavna » Wed Jan 09, 2008 12:36 pm\n\nzedz wrote:One bizarre choice was the use of a severely truncated version of the 'soldiers marching in the sky' shot, so that you barely notice (and quite probably are not meant to notice) the superimposition.\n\nActually, considering Ford's interest in keeping the dead \"among us,\" I thought the use of that shot made a great deal of sense. At least, I can imagine Ford \"getting\" it and thinking it entirely appropriate -- even though he may not have had much say in the editing process. (That would be interesting to know.) I'm thinking particularly of the final shots of 3 Bad Men and Fort Apache.\n\nThe World Moves On is indeed a mess, but I found it bizarrely captivating. It strikes me as an obvious riff on (rip-off of?) the George Arliss films of the early 30s, especially Twentieth-Century's House of Rothschild. But then there's the totally unexpected appearance of Stepin Fetchit, who seems to be acting in an entirely different movie, taking the piss out of the stuffiness of everyone else.\n\nQuote\n\n#136 Post by HerrSchreck » Wed Jan 09, 2008 12:54 pm\n\n(annoying nasal twang prompted by thick glasses pinching goofball nose):\n\nREAD YOUR BOOKLETS PEOPLE!\n\nThe booklet for Les Miz talks about the appropriation of this footage by Fox. It says, in ref to Les Miz being butchered for stateside distrib, \"This wasnt the first time Bernard had seen his footage taken from him, chopped up... In '32, TCFox so impressed by the... battle scenes of WC, purchased the film from Pathe Nathan for 140K, for US distrib. Ultimately however Fox decidednot to open WC but instead to use footage of battles and parading soldiers from the film into other Fox prods, such as the best pic-winning Cavalcade, The World Moves On, and a remake of Seventh Heaven-- a right covered in the fine print of the contract. Meanwhile WC novelist R Dorgeles entered into court battles w Fox over Hawks The Road to Glory, which DOrgelkes and others maintained was plagarized from the French screenplay of the film. Through all of this WC sat on the shelves unreleased, at TCFox.\"\n\nNice huh? Can you imagine your film being raped pillaged and assasinated from doing US business like that?\n\nProbably done as a favor to another low rent studio at the time straining for hits: Universal, so that All Quiet could go off unimpeded.\n\nQuote\n\n#137 Post by tryavna » Wed Jan 09, 2008 1:00 pm\n\nHerrSchreck wrote:READ YOUR BOOKLETS PEOPLE!\n\nIn my defense, I did take another look at the liner notes for Wooden Crosses, but didn't think to look in the other one again.\n\nQuote\n\n#138 Post by Napier » Wed Jan 09, 2008 1:15 pm\n\ntryavna wrote:\n\nHerrSchreck wrote:READ YOUR BOOKLETS PEOPLE!\n\nIn my defense, I did take another look at the liner notes for Wooden Crosses, but didn't think to look in the other one again.\n\nThat's why HerrSchreck is THE Richard Cranium.

I'd found part 2 of Les Mis a bit ponderous, but part 3 made up for it, and then some!\n\nSomebody needs to put out more Bernard. This set is just too good.\n\nQuote\n\n#143 Post by colinr0380 » Sun Sep 28, 2008 12:07 pm\n\nI opened up my copy of the Bernard set last night and watched Wooden Crosses. What a film, and it is almost criminal that it has been so neglected over the years! Something I didn't see mentioned in the thread yet, but was extremely impressed by was the use of montage in key sequences and the use of contrasting silence and sound (up there with M in my opinion. Is is just me or was there more confidence in using complete silence to highlight moments or against moments of great noise in films of this era that was lost somewhat when sound needed to be used constantly as if to continually affirm its presence? I love these early sound films where you can have a seeming disconnect between sound and image that works emotionally and artistically without having to provide a concrete cause for that incongruity).\n\nThere are also some neat visual connections - I particularly liked in the ten day assault scene the throwing of grenades from the shoulder mounted bags that made the soldiers seem sort of like farmer spreading seeds on a field. Though these particular 'seeds' were going to destroy rather than cause new growth.\n\nI also liked the way that the imagery of happy pre-war lives was presented as little tableaus. Similarly I thought the imagery of Sulphart's obliviously exuberant description of the squad's activities to Gilbert's shocked and disturbed parents was a comic highlight! There seemed to be lots of actions that raised disturbing parallels - the men entering the mined bunker to their certain death while our squad barely escape had me thinking about the way that seeing someone die seemingly 'in your place' or through bad timing could push people to the edge of sanity. Why did they die and you survived? Will you be able to fight for them as well as yourself? Will you be able to take on the responsibilities of informing their families? And what happens if you take on this generalised guilt and then die yourself? Those who initially died are then yet another degree of separation away from acknowledgement.\n\nI'm glad to see comments about the pyrotechnics during the battle sequences and agree with zedz that the sequences were made immeasurably more powerful by seeing people and explosions in the same frame, and to not immediately cut away but instead see the landscape changing as smoke drifts across the scene. It felt very close to a vision of hell, especially following the final benediction in the church scene before the despatching to the battlefield.\n\nOne of the other aspects of the film that I particularly liked was the introduction of 'sentimental' notes only to deepen their impact through 'real world' application. Such as the scene moving from Gilbert at Varion's graveside to the church where we initially get the mass and Ave Maria tugging the heartstrings in a classical manner, along with the introduction of the wounded in the barricaded off area of the church. Then it shifts from that to Gilbert's speech about accepting anything as long as they can live and not lose faith, with the groaning of the wounded providing a new soundtrack (which prefigures the final scene).\n\nIncidentally, this is another scene where the layers of imagery comment on the action. The DVD Beaver review has a capture of the statue Gilbert speaks to, yet I think the scene becomes more powerful during the moments of transition to the crowd leaving the church. This might have been a better capture:\n\nThen there's the scene of Bréval's dying speech. Surrounded by his companions, already laid out in a tomb, he delivers an unexpectedly scathing indictment of his philandering wife and then recants for the sake of his daughter. It not only blows up (literally in the barrage which follows that explodes the tomb he has been laid in! Even the dead are assaulted) those cliches of \"tell my...wife I...loved...her *flump*\", it gives Bréval a chance to open his heart to his companions and yet still allow his family to live in blissful ignorance in the constancy of his love.\n\nIt also feeds in to Gilbert's understated (thankfully!) relationship with his own girl back home. The usual photograph and perfume are there but that highlighted phrase in her letter about having broken a heel while dancing that Gilbert reads in the grave/trench in the same cemetery just before Bréval's shooting, shows she is similarly living a very different life, that the frivolous world still continues barely touched by the war while soldiers are dying.\n\nIn a way this connection underlines that the film is truly Gilbert's story - it begins with his billeting to a squad and ends with his death. He also mourns Varion perhaps more because a tenuous link with his home town has been severed early on. He is the one standing for the many, just another dead soldier with a mother at home. For me that point of view shot just after Gilbert is shot is devastating - he looks around at the other bodies of anonymous soldiers lying dead and there's that realisation that this is his fate as well - he's not special except to us (this also reminded me of those scenes in the shop, the church, the pub or the mess halls where there are lots of other groups of soldiers having conversations like our group, whose stories we don't follow but can maybe infer will have a similar trajectory).\n\nI found that moment almost physically painful myself with that revelation as we are so forcefully shown the world through his eyes throughout the film (unlike say Bréval or Varion, though their deaths touch us) that his impending and inevitable return to anonymity adds to that sense of waste. He's as anonymous to anyone else as those soldiers entering the bunker to die in the explosion were earlier on - we don't want to look at them as individuals because there's no way they'll live, but with Gilbert there is no escape from an emotional connection and so the audience dies with him. His dragging himself a little further on seems less an attempt to survive but more a futile attempt at escaping a spot on which he is destined to die. The masterfully complex montage of his companions, his girl breaking her heel, his parents, the city, the soldiers provides an extremely moving representation of a dying man's final thoughts. The layers of imagery of imagined moments, remembered moments, comments on a life, condemning of it and their blending together and slipping away all at the same time until he joins the procession of the dead.\n\nIt took a long while for me to recover from the impact after the film had come to an end, and to reflect on it.\n\nQuote\n\n#144 Post by Tommaso » Mon Sep 29, 2008 7:17 am\n\nGreat post, Colin. You almost make me want to rewatch the film immediately.\n\ncolinr0380 wrote: the use of contrasting silence and sound (up there with M in my opinion.

I think the effect in \"M\" is more irritating, because in \"Wooden crosses\" the absences of sound might perhaps be interpreted as somehow indicating the state of mind of the protagonists (and, by implication, the effect on the audience) whereas in the Lang film there is a far greater distance between what is going on on the screen and the viewer, at least in the first half or so. The completely silent night streets in \"M\" almost have a disorienting effect on me. I guess the reason for the silences in many of those early films is the often discussed mistrust in the new technology by many of the more famous silent film directors then, only few of which embraced the new medium whole-heartedly, and if so, then with the caveat of using sound only when needed, and then as artistically as they used the 'pure' images of silent film ( I think of the theoretical writings of Eisenstein especially, but also of the use of sound in Vertov's \"Entuziasm\" or in Clair's \"Million\"). In other words: it took a few years - outside Hollywood - to fully establish a 'realistic', 'unintrusive' use of sound and silence. And this realistic use of sound and ambience has been dominating filmmaking ever since, if you disregard decidedly 'experimental' or 'art' films for a moment.\n\nBut it's interesting to see that apparently audiences at the time were not averse to the 'unrealistic' silences, which I believe wouldn't be the case today on a broad basis. But then, at the time, \"M\" wouldn't have been as silent as it is today. Apart from the projector noise, surely also the soundtrack's crackles and pops would have created some reassuring ambient sound."
