It was written and directed by Raymond Bernard and stars Harry Baur as Jean Valjean and Charles Vanel as Javert. The film lasts four and a half hours and is considered by critics to be the greatest adaptation of the novel, due to its in-depth development of the themes and characters in comparison with most shorter adaptations. It was released as three films: Part One: Une temp黎e sous un cr穗e (Tempest in a Skull) Part Two: Les Th駭ardier (The Thenardiers) Part Three: Libert, libert ch駻ie (Freedom, dear Freedom) ...Les Mis駻ables - 2-Disc Set ( Les mis駻ables ) (Blu-Ray)"
