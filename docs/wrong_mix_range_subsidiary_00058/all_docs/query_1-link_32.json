        "text": "A very enjoyable night at the insiders last night, thank you Langtons for the invite and being great hosts, as always Andy McCall , Simon Mills, Josh Christopher. A real shame that Hill Dickinson LLP didnâ€™t win Law Firm of the Year, but congratulations to all the winners. Nice to see such a strong corporate community continuing to thrive in the North West, despite the current economic climate\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/ertc6eAX A complex transaction completed for Netsells and Hedgehog last week with the consultancy firms securing a multimillion-pound investment by BGF to support the companiesâ€™ growth plans. Wishing Sarat Pediredla ðŸ¦” and Ryan Scaife all the best in the next phase for the combined entities and fulfilling their ambitions to bring the best talent in the industry together and facilitating continued expansion into new international markets.\n\nA pleasure to advise Lakeland management on an MBO which completed last week as the chemical manufacturer celebrated its 60th anniversary. No doubt the board will further drive and develop the business locally and globally"
