Find out why shares of EMC Corp and American Airlines popped while Hartford Financial and Target dropped.\n\nPOPS (stocks that jumped higher)\n\nAmerican Airlines (AMR) popped 11%. This airline along with the entire sector traded inversely with the price of oil. – The airlines are all about oil, says Pete Najarian.\n\nEMC Corp (EMC) popped 9%. Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square took a 40 million share stake in the company, or about 2%. – I also like this stock, says Guy Adami.\n\nDeutsche Bank (DB) popped 19%.

The insurer dropped the most in 13 years after reporting its first unprofitable quarter in five years. – They really took it on the chin, says Karen Finerman. I’d stay away.\n\nTarget (TGT) dropped 5%. The slide comes one day after hedge fund manager Bill Ackman urged the company to spin off a separate firm that would own the land on which its stores are built. – I think investors sold the news, muses Karen Finerman.\n\nMotorola (MOT) dropped 6%. The firm posted a hefty third quarter loss and announced it will postpone the planned spin-off of the cell phone division. – I’d forget about this stock, says Pete Najarian.\n\nElan Corporation (ELN) dropped 13%.
