It superseded ISO/DIS 3166-2 (draft international standard). The draft standard showed a division of Armenia into eleven provinces. Each one had a two-digit ISO code. The final standard shows the same eleven provinces, but their ISO codes have been changed to two-letter codes, and the status of Erevan has been changed from province to city. The new set of codes is listed below.\n\nCountry overview:\n\nShort nameARMENIA ISO codeAM FIPS codeAM LanguageArmenian (hy) Time zone+4 CapitalYerevan\n\nArmenia was under Russian domination for most of the 20th century. As part of Czarist Russia, it was the district of Erivan. At that time it included some territory south of the Aras (Araks) River, which it lost to Turkey in World War I. Armenia was independent from 1917 to 1920. For part of that period, it belonged to the Transcaucasian Federation, along with Azerbaijan and Georgia. Armenia became part of the Transcaucasian Soviet Socialist Republic on 1922-03-12. This became one of the constituent republics of the U.S.S.R. later that year. In 1936 the Transcaucasian S.S.R. was split into the three republics again. The Commonwealth of Independent States supplanted the U.S.S.R. on 1991-12-08. Armenia became a member of the C.I.S. that same month.\n\nOther names of country:\n\nArmenian: Hayastan, Haikakan Hanrapetoutioun (formal), Hayastani Hanrapetut'yun (formal)\n\nDanish: Armenien\n\nDutch: Armenië, Republiek Armenië (formal)\n\nEnglish: Republic of Armenia (formal), Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (obsolete)\n\nFinnish: Armenia\n\nFrench: Arménie, République f d'Arménie f (formal)\n\nGeorgian: Somkheti\n\nGerman: Armenien n\n\nIcelandic: Armenía\n\nItalian: Armenia\n\nNorwegian: Armenia, Republikken Armenia (formal)\n\nPortuguese: Arménia (Portugal), Armênia (Brazil), República f da Arménia f (formal)\n\nRussian: Armeniya, Armyanskaya Sovyetskaya Sotsialisticheskaya Respublika (obsolete)\n\nRussian: Армянская Советская Социалистичэская Республика (obsolete), Республика Армения (formal)\n\nSpanish: Armenia f\n\nSwedish: Armenien\n\nTurkish: Ermenistan Cumhuriyeti (formal)\n\nOrigin of name:\n\nfrom the legendary patriarch Armenak. The name Hayastan comes from Haik, an ancient king, who according to Armenian tradition was the son of the Biblical Togarmah, son of Gomer, son of Japheth, son of Noah, whose ark landed on Mount Ararat.\n\nPrimary subdivisions:\n\nArmenia is divided into ten gavaṙ (provinces) and one kaghak (city).\n\nProvinceHASCFIPSPopulationArea(km.²)Area(mi.²)Capital Aragacot'nAM.AGAM01126,2782,7551,064Ashtarak AraratAM.ARAM02252,6652,003773Artashat ArmavirAM.AVAM03255,8611,241479Armavir ErevanAM.ERAM111,091,23521081Erevan Gelark'unik'AM.GRAM04215,3713,6551,411Gavar (Kamo) Kotayk'AM.KTAM05241,3372,100810Razdan LoṙiAM.LOAM06253,3513,7911,464Vanadzor (Kirovakan) ŠirakAM.SHAM07257,2422,6791,034Gyumri (Leninakan) Syunik'AM.SUAM08134,0614,5051,739Kafan TavušAM.TVAM09121,9633,1201,205Idjevan Vayoc'JorAM.VDAM1053,2302,406929Yegheknadzor 11 divisions3,002,59429,74311,484\n\nProvince: Each division is a province, except Erevan, which is a city. There are\n\nnumerous ways to transliterate these names from Armenian. Here they are\n\nshown as in the book \"Administrative Subdivisions of Countries\".\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes. If periods are replaced by\n\nhyphens, these are the same as the province codes from ISO standard 3166-2.\n\nFIPS: Codes from FIPS PUB 10-4, a U.S. government standard.\n\nPopulation: 2001-10-10 census.\n\nAreas: Total includes Lake Sevan, which is not counted in any of the provinces.\n\nCapital: Names in parentheses are from the period of Soviet domination.\n\nPostal codes:\n\nArmenia appears still to be using Soviet-era postal codes, six-digit numbers always beginning with '37'.\n\nTerritorial extent:\n\nGelark'unik' includes the small Artsvashen exclave, containing the town of Bashkend, surrounded by Azerbaijan.\n\nThe UN LOCODE page for Armenia lists locations in the country, some of them with their latitudes and longitudes, some with their ISO 3166-2 codes for their subdivisions. This information can be put together to approximate the territorial extent of subdivisions.\n\nOrigins of names:\n\nErevan: possibly from Armenian erevan: to appear or show, implying that it was the first place to appear after the Biblical flood.\n\nChange history:\n\nUnder the Soviet Union, Armenia was the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (Armyanskaya Sovyetskaya Sotsialisticheskaya Respublika). According to the Atlas of Armenia, as of 1991-01-01, Armenia was divided into 37 raions, as shown in the table below. The atlas notes that Aragadz and Nairi were formed in 1972, and Baghramyan in 1983; the others are presumably older.\n\nDistrictPopulationYearArea(km.²)Area(mi.²)Later Aghin17,7731959429166Širak Akhuryan32,2521959576223Širak Alaverdi52,10719591,121433Loṙi Amasia12,7941959594229Širak Aparan22,8871959816315Aragacot'n Aragadz14,1001986382148Loṙi Artashat61,7211959562217Ararat Art'ik37,4261959634245Širak Ashtarak44,7911959932360Aragacot'n Azizbekov13,41119591,174453Vayoc'Jor Baghramyan14,8511985453175Armavir Basargech'ar35,64119591,134438Gelark'unik' Echmiadzin63,1561959425164Armavir Eghegnadzor26,24819591,134438Vayoc'Jor Erevan1,184,500198723089Erevan Ghap'an47,40619591,371529Syunik' Ghukasyan10,0451959561216Širak Goris29,4211959752290Syunik' Hoktemberyan61,6141959701271Armavir Hrazdan35,2051959946365Kotayk' Ichevan32,60119591,299502Tavuš Kalinino25,2651959690266Loṙi Kamo35,5661959634245Gelark'unik' Kirovakan25,5081959781302Loṙi Kotayk'32,2731959850328Kotayk' Krasnoselsk23,9631959697269Gelark'unik' Martuni45,67019591,168451Gelark'unik' Meghri11,7501959664256Syunik' Nairi42,0001982344133Kotayk' Noyemberyan23,2971959538208Tavuš Sevan21,0321959385149Gelark'unik' Shamshadin31,8141959824318Tavuš Sisian28,80819591,719664Syunik' Spitak35,2741959596230Loṙi Step'anavan29,9291959637246Loṙi T'alin28,84919591,288497Aragacot'n Vedi38,53219591,999772Ararat 37 districts30,04011,598\n\nPopulation: 1959-01-15 census, except as shown.\n\nYear: Date of population estimates for some districts.\n\nLater: Post-1995 province containing approximate\n\narea of district.\n\nAccording to the 1995 CIA World Factbook, Armenia consisted of 37 shrjanner (regions): Akhuryan, Amasiya, Ani, Aparan, Aragats, Ararat, Armavir, Artashat, Art'ik, Ashots'k', Ashtarak, Baghramyan, Ejmiatsin, Goris, Gugark', Hrazdan, Ijevan, Kamo, Kapan, Kotayk', Krasnoselsk, Martuni, Masis, Meghri, Nairi, Noyemberyai, Sevan, Sisian, Spitak, Step'anavan, T'alin, Tashir, Taush, T'umanyan, Vardenik, Vayk', Yeghegnadzor; and 23 kaghakner (cities): Abovyan, Alaverdi, Ararat, Artashat, Art'ik, Ashtarak, Ch'arents'avan, Dilijan, Ejmiatsin, Goris, Gyumri, Hoktemberyan, Hrazdan, Ijevan, Jermuk, Kamo, Kapan, Metsamor, Sevan, Spitak, Step'anavan, Vanadzor, and Yerevan. These regions don't seem to correspond exactly with those listed in the table, but a partial key to the correspondence is probably: Ani = Aghin, Ararat = Vedi, Armavir = Hoktemberyan, Kapan = Ghap'an, T'umanyan = Alaverdi, Tashir = Kalinino, Taush = Shamshadin, Vardenik = Basargech'ar, and Vayk' = Azizbekov.\n\n1995-07-05: Armenia re-organized into the current ten provinces and one city.\n\nOther names of subdivisions:\n\nAragacot'n: Aragatsotn (variant)\n\nArarat: Ararate (Portuguese)\n\nErevan: Ereván (Spanish); Erevão (Portuguese-variant); Erivan, Ierevan, Jerevan, Yerevan (variant); Eriwan (German)\n\nGelark'unik': Gegharcunik, Gegharkunick, Gegharkunik (variant); Guegharkounik (French)\n\nKotayk': Kotaik (variant)\n\nŠirak: Chirak (French); Shirak (variant)\n\nSyunik': Siounik (French); Sunik, Syunk (variant); Zangezur (obsolete)\n\nTavuš: Tavouch (French); Tavoush, Tavush (variant)\n\nVayoc'Jor: Vaïots Dzor (French); Vayots Dzor (variant)\n\nSources:"
