        "text": "The Hayastan All-Armenian Fund was established in 1992, and has grown into a worldwide collaborative effort mobilized through affiliate organizations in the Armenian Diaspora. In 1994, Armenia Fund, Inc. was founded in Los Angeles as a 501 © (3) tax-exempt, non-governmental, non-political organization to provide critical humanitarian assistance to Armenia and Artsakh. Armenia Fund has met this challenge by successfully implementing large-scale humanitarian and infrastructure development assistance to Armenia and Artsakh.\n\nOver the past ten years, Armenia Fund has raised more than $300 million for critically needed projects in Armenia and Artsakh. With a support base of well over 20,000 donors, Armenia Fund is the largest Armenian-American grassroots, non-membership charity in the United States. When you give money to Armenia Fund, you become an important and life-changing member of the Armenia Fund community, because your support directly affects the people and the future of Armenia.\n\nOur 20,000 donors have helped build critical infrastructure and provide humanitarian aid, through our trusted distribution networks and longstanding relationships to Armenia and Artsakh. We are there when the people of Armenia are experiencing their most difficult moments, and our commitment is deeply rooted in a passion to help them thrive and achieve their greatest potential despite challenging circumstances.\n\nFrom first-rate roads, hospitals and cultural centers that produce long-term benefits to youth educational programs and prosthetics for our injured servicemen, Armenia Fund has been there to address the pressing needs of our compatriots in Armenia and Artsakh.\n\nPlease explore this website, read our articles, and watch the videos and learn about the important work Armenia Fund has done throughout its history; but don’t stop there. Share what you learn with your personal and professional networks, and encourage people to get involved. This is a challenging time for Armenia, but with Armenia Fund’s experience and the commitment, and the strength of the diaspora community, there is nothing we cannot overcome together.\n\nThank you,\n\n– Maria Mehranian, Chairperson of The ArmeniaFund\n\nTelethon USA\n\nArmenian Armericans in the US Diaspora Raise Funds for Armenia & Artsakh\n\nEXPLORE MAP\n\nBACK\n\nIt's better to see something once than to hear about it a thousand times.\n\nWELCOME TO THE ARMENIAN CULTURE\n\nFIND OUT MORE\n\nREAD MORE\n\nIt's better to see something once than to hear about it a thousand times.\n\nHelp The Youth in Armenia and Artsakh Access to Schools\n\nStudents have benefited from education in Armenia to explore the regions that have benefited from the ArmeniaFund's Donors and Sponsors efforts across the years.
