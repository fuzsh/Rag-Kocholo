        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe continuous development of medicine requires the utilization of scientific potentials in other scientific and technological fields. The medical education discipline is one of the interdisciplinary fields that make contributions to the development of medical knowledge worldwide. Therefore, the worldwide interest in medical education and the need for this type of science provided the basis for its formation as a separate discipline.1,2\n\nMedical education in the world is provided with different approaches. Some universities such as Dundee, Calgary, McMaster, Harvard, Karolinska and Maastricht offer it in the form of short- and long-term courses leading to both master’s and Ph.D degrees.3,4\n\nIn Iran, medical education is in the form of a discipline with interdisciplinary nature in postgraduate studies (two years with a degree) and in both in-person and virtual as well as Ph.D (four and a half years with a degree) and in person. The matriculation exam in this discipline is in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education. There are criteria for selecting students in the order of priority among groups such as faculty members of medical sciences universities and colleges across the country, faculty members of Islamic Azad University of Medical Sciences, masters (MSc) of medical sciences, holders of a doctorate in general medicine, pharmacy and dentistry, doctors of clinical specialties. The duration and structure of the course is based on the by-laws and conditions of the two master’s and doctoral degrees approved by the Supreme Council for Planning of Medical Sciences.4,5\n\nWith the development of medical sciences, the discipline of medical education has also undergone various transformations.2 Ronald Harden, as a co-founder of the medical education, addressed in his book: “A Practical Guide for Medical Teachers” new horizons of medical education including globalization of healthcare delivery and the international dimensions of medical education, re-conceptualization of the role of the doctors, changes in the context and structure of gaining clinical experience, continuous advancements on modern learning technologies and their impact on learning and teaching, transformations in the concept of assessment and its role in medical education, recognition of the professionalism and scholarship in medical education.1\n\nVarious reports, including the one by the Steering Committee of Medical Education Generalists highlighted trends and megatrends affecting the future of medical education. These ten megatrends include globalization,6 simulation, rising costs of medical care and medical education, redefining ideal physician traits and characteristics, the need for continuity and collaboration across the medical education timetable, interdisciplinary and interprofessional health care education, understanding medical education as part of health care enterprise, the need for lifelong learning and support for the medical profession, changes in medical education setting (from hospital to outpatient, office and community) and technology.7,8\n\nDuring the last ten years, developments such as expanding medical disciplines and universities, and increasing admission of students and faculties have been observed in our country. These challenges represent the important position of the medical education discipline in maintaining and improving quality in line with the quantitative development of disciplines, colleges and universities of medical sciences. Therefore, policymaking is important for the development of medical education discipline. One of the challenges facing the medical education discipline is the diversity of the characteristics of entrants. This diversity and breadth of entry criteria raises concerns for policy makers about the discipline and its future. A look at motivations of candidates for choosing this discipline provides the relevant evidence. Sabouri Aghbulagh Rostam Khan et al examined students’ motivations for studying in medical education discipline. Their reasons were the ease of entry compared to other disciplines, the absence of virtual education in the previously studied discipline, a way out of the clinical environment and others.9\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned developments, challenges and concerns, and rapid changes in various social, political, economic, technological, and environmental spheres also make the future of the health and medical education system more complex and risky. Understanding future uncertainties provide a good platform for medical education decision makers to gain information.10\n\nOne of the tools available for achieving the above-mentioned goal is the use of foresight. Foresight is to describe a collection of strategies to identify changes and improve decision-making procedures.11 This study was conducted aiming at identifying key factors affecting the future of medical education discipline in 2025 based on STEPV model.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAs with other disciplines, medical education is exposed to developments that shape the future of this discipline on a continuous basis. Some of these developments are of national and local origin, and others of global and international origin.\n\nAmong the social factors that influence the future of the discipline are the age and employment status referred to by the participants. The results of a study by The Council of Higher Education Management Associations (CHEMA), aimed at identifying the driving forces that influence the future of higher education in the US and Canada over the next 10 years, also addressed the changing demographic characteristics of students.19 Some of our participants believed that unemployed students had a higher quality education period than employed ones. The results of the study by Mohamadian et al confirm this finding.20 But Hakkinen believes that working while studying will complement formal education, responsibility and greater familiarity with the world of employment.21\n\nAccording to the participants, the study of the motivations of the candidates could also influence the future of medical education discipline. Chapman also considers many factors influencing the choice of discipline and the university such as interest, level of personal aspirations, attitudes, academic performance and competencies, family and friends and university characteristics and so on.22\n\nDue to its interdisciplinary nature, the discipline of medical education needs to strengthen communications and interactions with other disciplines of medical sciences. The results of the study on the future of medical education in Canada, with the aim of meeting current and future needs of the society in terms of health, identified 10 key strategies for the future of medical education. One of these 10 strategies was “focusing on interdisciplinary skills”.23\n\nThe congresses, conferences, seminars, and other specialized science communities, despite their high costs, and advantages and disadvantages can play an important role in changing views of the individuals on the role and importance of medical education discipline. According to Sundeep, medical education conferences should play a vital role in continuing education and developing the skills of their stakeholders. But today, because of these congresses with a large number of individuals and lack of respect for some of the important aspects, they are not adequate enough.24\n\nAnother important issue mentioned by the participants and especially the teachers of the discipline was the generation gap between the students and the teachers. The results of a study by Alkatan on the effect of factors related to the preceptor and generation gap on education in the residency period showed that from among the three categories of factors related to preceptor qualifications and skills, the most important ones were behavioral patterns and generation gap.25\n\nThe knowledge and understanding of the academic community about medical education discipline was among other important social factors. EDCs, EDOs and medical education departments of universities can play an important role in the development of the discipline. Baume and Kahn identified eight items among the activities of EDCs, one of which is to provide incentives to staff and promote rewarding policies for learning and teaching and development of education.26\n\nThe graduate community of medical education discipline also plays an important role in raising awareness and attitudes towards the discipline in the future. Craft considers that having graduates who are highly knowledgeable, have a positive attitude, and are especially skillful and creative is among the concerns of the educational system. He believes that nurturing creative thinking is one of the ultimate goals of any educational system.27\n\nSocial accountability is another issue that plays an important role in the future of the discipline. The curriculum of the disciplines must be responsive to the needs of the community. Various studies have been conducted on the lack of responsiveness of educational curricula and their inability to train competent graduates. Among them is the study examining the skills of graduated physicians in the United Kingdom, in which only 4% of graduates agreed with the appropriateness of the curricula to make competent physicians and a large percentage (40%) disagreed.28–30\n\nToday, the growth and development of information and communication technologies and virtual education is such that the impact of technological factors on the future of academic disciplines, and in particular medical education, cannot be ignored. De Boer et al examined the trends that influence the future of higher education and universities. One of these trends has been the development of ICT.31\n\nThe role of virtual courses can be discussed from two perspectives; first, the role of virtual education in all disciplines of medical sciences and second, the provision of virtual courses in medical education discipline. The first perspective could affect the overall process of teaching and learning and the methods of evaluation of the disciplines. The second perspective raises concerns about the quantity, quality and competence of its graduates. Otto Peters likens the teaching process of the distance learning system to industry and industrial products and calls it the teaching learning industrialization theory. He believes that as we pursue mass production in the industry, we also seek to recruit and graduate large numbers of learners in distance education.32\n\nMoreover, the economic situation of the country was one of the economic factors considered by the participants. Crises such as the sanctions have reduced the use of Sabbatical Leave and international communications across all disciplines, including medical education. Vincent-Lancrin examined trends affecting higher education. These trends included economic issues, financing, and the importance of the market and its sovereignty.33\n\nMoving toward third and fourth generation universities is one of the new concerns for all managers, policymakers, planners and the academic community. According to the European Union report, entrepreneurship is not yet integrated into curriculum and educational institutions and universities. Therefore, it is necessary to use interactive learning and teaching methods based on experience and multidisciplinary collaboration in the training of skilled and entrepreneurial individuals.34\n\nAnother important factor in the future of medical education discipline is political factors. Student admission policies are among the influential political factors. The participants believed that no estimates of the number of students and graduates and their job status are available. According to Al-Sawai et al, workforce planning is considered as one of the important roles of health planners.35\n\nPolicymakers also play a vital role in determining laws, policies, and changing attitudes toward the discipline. The lack of a private labor market is one of the concerns of graduates for the future of discipline. Walter and Craig believe that universities play a key role in resolving the problems of labor market and industry. They can make the students more competent by making changes to curricula and adding practical courses.36\n\nThe role of high-level documents and plans for the evolution of the education system and their impact on the future of the discipline should not be overlooked. Chin et al considered the roadmap as the most useful tool for organizations, policymakers, and researchers to deliver high-quality services.37 In our study, the necessity for a coherent roadmap to clear the path to the future of the discipline is also considered essential.\n\nThe values and norms of society can directly and indirectly influence the various processes and their future. One view in this regard is credentialism, which is especially observed in virtual courses. The participants believed that the majority of graduates of virtual courses do not have the necessary competencies after graduation. Dikici et al investigated the factors influencing the choice of specialty discipline among first-year medical students in Turkey. The findings of this study showed that obtaining higher degrees to achieve higher income and better job positions were among the important factors for choosing a specialty discipline.38\n\nPrioritizing treatment and research over education is among other concerns with the future of the discipline. One of the reasons for the decrease of education’s priority is the materialism, which is effective not only in treatment, but also in student admissions. An example can be found in virtual medical education courses. Kendrick considered that the costs of virtual education included the costs of producing educational content, teaching the faculty, evaluation, and other necessary costs.39 On the other hand, virtual courses may have a positive impact and even lead to lower educational costs. The results of a study at the University of Illinois showed that the cost of education had decreased when e-learning had replaced in-person education.40\n\nThe role of university administrators and officials and their attitude toward medical education discipline can have a significant impact on improving the quality of the discipline in the future. Khalid et al believe that the administrators’ support for education can lead to a favorable environment in the organization. The administrator of the organization creates a positive organizational environment that motivates learners and educators to learn.41"
