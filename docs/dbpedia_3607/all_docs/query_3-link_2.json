        "text": "Constitutional framework\n\nIn 1995 Armenia adopted a new constitution, replacing the Soviet-era constitution that had been in force from 1978. The 1995 document establishes legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government and provides for a strong executive. A number of basic rights and freedoms of citizens are enumerated. The constitution has since been amended twice through referendum: once in 2005 and once in 2015.\n\nArmenia is a unitary multiparty republic. Legislative authority is vested in a 105-member National Assembly. Members are elected to five-year terms. The legislature has the authority to approve the budget, ratify treaties, and declare war.\n\nThe head of state is the president, elected by the National Assembly and limited to one seven-year term. The presidentâ€™s role is largely ceremonial and primarily consists of executing decisions of the National Assembly or the cabinet pertaining to government positions, foreign relations, or the armed forces. The prime minister is the head of government and commander in chief of the armed forces and is elected by a parliamentary majority and subsequently appointed by the president. Upon resignation of the prime minister, the National Assembly must elect a new prime minister within two votes in two weeks. If a new prime minister is not elected within two votes in two weeks, the National Assembly is dissolved and early elections are triggered.\n\nThe judiciary consists of trial courts, appellate courts, a Court of Cassation (the highest appellate court), and a nine-member Constitutional Court, which determines the constitutionality of legislation and executive decrees. The members of these courts are appointed variously: most judicial appointments are elected or recommended by the National Assembly, while others are appointed by the president at the recommendation of a judicial council.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGuess the Country by Its Neighbors Quiz\n\nArmenia is divided into numerous marzer (provinces). Local authority at the community level is held by mayors or village elders.\n\nDuring the Soviet period political life was directed by the Communist Party of Armenia, which was controlled by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Armenian National Movement, a moderate nationalist party, governed Armenia from independence until 1998. Major parties in the 21st century have included the conservative Republican Party of Armenia, which dominated the government from 1999 through 2018, and the centre-right Prosperous Armenia Party, founded by businessman Garik Tsarukyan. In 2018 a series of popular protests led by Nikol Pashinyan upended Republican dominance in favour of his populist Civil Contract party."
