        "text": "Genocide, which was committed by the Armenians in the Azerbaijani town of Khojaly in the late 20th century, is considered one of the gravest crimes against humanity. Khojaly does not differ from horrific tragedies of Katyn, Lidice, Oradoursur­Glane, Holocaust, Songmy, Rwanda and Srebrenica, which are etched on the minds of people forever. These atrocities went down in the history of wars as genocides of civilians that shook the world. On the night of 25­26 February 1992, the Armenian armed forces surrounded Khojaly with 10 tanks, 16 armored carriers, nine infantry fighting vehicles, 180 military experts and infantry units of the 366th motor rifle regiment, which was part of the 23rd division of the 4th USSR army deployed in Khankandi. Armed with stateof­the­art weapons, the Armenians razed Khojaly to the ground. Official figures prove that as a result of the genocidal act in Khojaly 613 people were killed, including 106 women, 63 children and 70 elderly. The genocide committed by Armenians against Azerbaijanis in Khojaly in 1992 were investigated on the basis “Azerbaijan” , “Baku” , “Sәhәr” , “Khalq” , “Respublika” , “Vәtәn sәsi” , “Odlar yurdu” , “Әdәbiyyat” , “Azәrbaycan gәnclәri” , “525­ci qәzet” newspapers, “Azәrbaycan” journal and other press examples in the article. The article is important for the history of Azerbaijan and the Azerbaijani press, for the world genocide researches.\n\nThis article seeks to study the consequences of the Nagorno-Karabakh war for Azerbaijan: thus analyzes findings on occupied territories, casualties, and damages of the war from economic, political, and social perspectives. The utmost brutality and atrocity of the overall conflict is memorized with Khojaly Massacre committed against Azerbaijani civilians on 26 February 1992. Hence, the article unveils evidences through the scrutiny of secondary data from academic sources, publications, and news materials published by international media. The particular focus of the study is concentrated on to what extend special plan was prepared deliberately for ethnic cleansing in Khojaly during the Nagorno-Karabakh war.\n\nRepublic of Azerbaijan gained its independence on October 18, 1991 from the USSR. During the beginning of its independence twenty percent of Azerbaijani territories (Nagorno-Karabakh and its surrounding regions) were occupied by Armenian armed forces. The genocide in Khojaly town was one of the bloodiest pages in Azerbaijani history, where Armenian troops massacred Azerbaijanis in order to achieve their ethnic cleansing policies. Referring to the United Nation Convention on the Prevention of the Punishment of Genocide (1948) and the Rome Statute (1998) it can be defined that the act of the illegal occupation of Khojaly by the Armenian armed forces by killing ethnic groups and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group with a goal to eliminate could be considered as genocide. The paper will focus on the brutal actions done by Armenian Government during its occupation and address how international community responds to the event occurred in Khojaly.\n\nDid the 1915 genocide of the Ottoman Armenians play a role in the genesis of the Karabakh war? In the early phase of the conflict, many Armenian activists and politicians drew parallels between the evolving struggles of the present and the traumatic events of 1915. This essay explores the ways in which Armenia, Azerbaijan and Turkey have referred to the events of 1915 to formulate their policies towards the conflict. The essay argues that the largely suppressed past trauma was present in the mass psychology of the conflicting parties, although in radically different ways, and that it shaped developing events. After depoliticising genocide commemorations in the early years of its independence, Armenia has recently witnessed an increase in references to the genocide in political discourse. The same also applies, somewhat paradoxically, to Azerbaijan, which has developed its own state-sponsored discourse of genocide, vehemently denying that the genocide took place while portraying Azerbaijan as a victim of genocide itself. This exchange of roles clearly needs further explanation.\n\nThe article deals with a brief history of Karabakh and the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict between the two republics of South Caucasus-Azerbaijan and Armenia, including the primary aim of defining the ethno-political processes and historical occurrences as emerging the Armenian problem in the Azerbaijani territory of Nogorno-Karabakh (Azerbaijani: Dağlıq Qarabağ). The aim of this writing is to learn how and why this ethnic, religious and political conflict appeared between Armenian and local population of Nogorno-Karabakh. Of course, all the remarkable factors in this article let us prove that the initial indigenous people of Karabakh were the Azerbaijani Turks. In fact, Karabakh historically and legally is an integral territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan recognized by the international community.\n\nAfter initiation of the glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) policies in the USSR by Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union started to crumble, and old, forgotten, suppressed problems especially regarding territorial claims between Azerbaijanis and Armenians reemerged. Although Mountainous (Nagorno) Karabakh is officially part of Azerbaijan Republic, after fierce and bloody clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, the entire Nagorno Karabakh region and seven additional surrounding districts of Lachin, Kelbajar, Agdam, Jabrail, Fizuli, Khubadly and Zengilan, it means over 20 per cent of Azerbaijan, were occupied by Armenians, and because of serious war situations, many Azerbaijanis living in these areas had to migrate from their homeland to Azerbaijan and they have been living under miserable conditions since the early 1990s. Mihail Gorbaçov tarafından başlatılan glasnost (açıklık) ve perestroyka (yeniden inşa) politikalarından sonra Sovyetler Birliği parçalanma sürecine girdi ve birlik coğrafyasındaki unutulmuş ve bastırılmış olan eski problemler, özellikle Azerbaycan Türkleri ve Ermeniler arasındaki sınır sorunları yeniden gün yüzüne çıktı. Bu bağlamda, hukuken Azerbaycan devletinin bir parçası olan Dağlık Karabağ bölgesi ve çevresindeki Laçin, Kelbecer, Cebrail, Agdam, Fizuli, Zengilan ve Kubatlı gibi yedi semt, yani yaklaşık olarak Azerbaycan‟ın yüzde yirmiye yakın toprağı, her iki toplum arasındaki şiddetli ve kanlı çarpışmalardan sonra Ermeniler tarafından işgal edildi. Ayrıca, olumsuz savaş şartları nedeniyle, binlerce Azerbaycan Türkü yaşadıkları topraklardan Azerbaycan‟a göç etmek zorunda kaldı ve söz konusu göçmenler hala çok kötü şartlar altında yaşamlarını sürdürmektedirler.\n\nThe author addresses the historicity of the claim made in various governmental and academic circles that the Armenians are relative newcomers to the land now known as Nagorno Karabakh. After briefly describing the ancient and mediaeval Armenian primary source materials, he describes attempts to deny their authenticity, placing the question in the context of achieving a lasting piece between the Armenians and Azeris and between the antagonists of similar controversies. Arguing that perceptions are as important as actualities, he asserts that the historical claims of all sides can and must be accurately examined to achieve a viable solution.\n\nOn September 27, 2020, regional clashes erupted following a provocative Armenian attack on the front line, leading to a reemergence of the dragged-out Karabakh conflict onto the world agenda. When the clashes first started, few could have guessed that this period would be known as the “Second Karabakh War” and that it would lead to key outcomes in a short time span. With the influence of various factors on the war, especially Turkey’s support, Azerbaijan liberated an important segment of its occupied lands, dealing a clear defeat to Armenia. This war is an important turning point in terms of reversing the status quo which had been attempted to be imposed on Azerbaijan for nearly 30 years. The status quo demonstrated that the Karabakh onflict, and hence Armenia’s occupation of Azerbaijani territories, was unsustainable. The current book conducts a comprehensive analysis of the Karabakh conflict, with contributions from field-expert academics and specialists from Azerbaijan and Turkey. While doing so, it addresses the significance of the Karabakh conflict, its historical background, the Second Karabakh War, and the Karabakh policies of thirdparty actors from a broad perspective."
