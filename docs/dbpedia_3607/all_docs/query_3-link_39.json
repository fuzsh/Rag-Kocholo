The purpose of cooperation with the OGP is to expand the scope of awareness of the citizens through addressed messages and behavioral interventions.\n\nStatus quo\n\nTaking into account the low indicators of citizens' awareness and participation that have arisen from the organized discussions, apart from the use of awareness measures determined by law, additional mechanisms have been established in order to increase citizens' interest in public processes and the interest due to them.\n\nIn order to more effectively implement the process of informing the population, the process of making the mentioned process more transparent, more accessible for citizens, and more accountable is initiated within the framework of the OGP.\n\nAction\n\nThe main goal of the proposal is to ensure a participatory decision-making process among residents and young people in the fields of community management and democratic processes. The proposal also aims to support the formation of human-centered policies, raise the level of awareness among citizens and support the accountable public administration through enhanced community-resident dialogue.\n\nYerevan Municipality will apply behavioral science tools in all 12 administrative districts, which will stimulate citizens' interest and promote active participation.\n\nDevelop the conceptual foundations of communication and information policy, modernize the functional system of institutional management and introduce innovative models of communication, public awareness, information addressing process at public discussions organized by the municipality through planning and implementation of the communication. It is planned to introduce additional mechanisms, in addition to the use of awareness measures defined by the law so far, to increase the interest in participating in discussions and to apply more flexible methods of awareness.\n\nHow will the commitment contribute to solving the public problem described above?\n\nResults expected:\n\n- The readiness of Yerevan Municipality to work more flexibly and willingly with citizens, NGOs, Civil Society Organizations will be confirmed.\n\n- The continuity of ensuring participatory, transparent, accountable management practices will be confirmed through the use of innovative mechanisms.\n\n- With the implementation of the commitment, we expect that the activities between Yerevan Municipality and citizens will become more transparent, information about the services provided by the municipality will become more accessible, public participation will be ensured in the decision-making process, innovative mechanisms will be used and community-citizen cooperation will become more effective and accountable.\n\nPrimary Policy Area\n\nInclusion, Social Accountability\n\nPrimary Sector\n\nLegislature, Public Services (general)\n\nWhat OGP value is this commitment relevant to?"
