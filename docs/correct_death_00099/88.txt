During his decades of public service, Hubert H. Humphrey had many titles.

He was the mayor of Minneapolis, a two-time U.S. senator and the country's 38th vice president (under Lyndon B. Johnson). He helped found the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL), and was a passionate advocate for civil rights, non-nuclear proliferation and Medicare. His campaign for president in 1968 was likely scuttled by his support for the Vietnam War, even though that support was short-lived.

Humphrey, who died in 1978, was also widely honored.

Across the country, he's had schools and bridges, health care centers and rec centers named in his honor. Here at home, a public affairs school at the University of Minnesota bares his name, as a sports stadium and an airport terminal once did. A bronze sculpture of him stands outside City Hall in downtown Minneapolis.

The year he died, he also was cast in something a little less permanent: snow.

As part of the St. Paul Winter Carnival, a group of snow sculptors from Sapporo, Japan, carved a bust of the late senator near 3M Co. headquarters in Maplewood.
