Before his burial, Humphrey’s body lay in state at the Minnesota capitol building for 17 hours. An estimated 43,000 people came to the capitol to pay their respects. But after a grand funeral service (at which President Jimmy Carter spoke) the evening had grown bitterly cold. The family had intended to have a brief, private graveside service. But despite the family’s attempt to make the event private (and security keeping press and the public outside the gates), over 1,000 mourners waited at Lakewood in the snow and frigid temperatures to say their final goodbyes on the evening of the burial. Former Lakewood President Ron Gjerde assisted with the burial arrangements that day; in the year following the burial, Gjerde recalls, not a day went by without a visitor stopping into the office to request directions to Humphrey’s final resting place. Humphrey is best known for serving as Vice President under President Johnson. In this position, he was instrumental in passing the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which helped extend voting rights to Black Americans. Humphrey is also largely credited with convincing the Democratic party to adopt a Civil Rights platform, thanks to a historic speech he gave at the 1948 Democratic National Convention in which he encouraged the party to go “into the bright sunshine of human rights.” Humphrey was also a Minnesota State Senator, and was elected mayor of Minneapolis at only 34 years old. As mayor, Humphrey worked closely with Black social, political, and community leaders who had worked on civil rights issues for decades. He relied on the expertise of these leaders and others to help him develop the civil rights platform that he ultimately brought to the national stage. Hubert Humphrey is buried in Section 51, in the northeast corner of the cemetery. \n.\nPhoto information in the comments.\".",
