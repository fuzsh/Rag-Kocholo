Bradley who has been ailing for the past eighteen months and who has been bedfast for the past six or seven months, and suffered severly at times. He was ready to go to his heavenly home at the call of the Master, although he hated to leave his loved ones here on earth and go from them to the place prepared for him. He was one of these quiet persons who never crossed anybody and who always looked upon the good side of all persons and gave them their share of praise and a friendly salutation. He often remarked about the kindness of Albany and said that there were many more good persons in Albany than he ever had any idea of and wished that it were possible for him to repay them for the many kindnesses which they had granted to him from time to time. This was denied him, and it was one of his regrets that he could not have the privilege to repay them. In all his dealings he was strictly honest and honorable, and though a sufferer for many years he did all that he could do while in the employment of anybody. He often remarked about the many favors which the Knights of Pythians bestowed upon him and how he wished for the privilege to sit once more with them in their Castle(?)all to personally thank them for their favors, but this was not to be. (?) yet he never (?) good grace. He is not with us, he has answered his final call from this life unto the one where there are no sorrows or suffering and where peace reigneth, and so we accept the following obituary.\n\nObituary: Aaron Earnest Bradley, oldest son of Charles V. and Anna Frey Bradley, was born in Union Grove Township, Whiteside County, Illinois, October 14th, 1868, and departed this life at 4:45 o'clock, Friday morning, March 5, 1926, at the family home in Albany, Illinois, being 57 years, 5 months, 1 day old at that time.

E. church nearly 30 years ago, bring a devout advocate for the right, taking part until ill health prevented. Being of a mot kind and friendly nature, he won for himself friends whom he held dear. During his 18 long months of illness, he thoroughly appreciated the acts of kindness from friends proving their true friendship and he often expressed himself with much feeling. All though this ordeal his thoughts reverted constantly to that wonderful Home above, which he knew was very near him.

She returned to this community and engaged in her profession of teaching. On April 7, 1906, she was united in marriage to Henry J. Brill of Tampico. When Mr. Brill's health failed they moved to Kansas, hoping that the change of climate would be beneficial, but he passed away there in February, 1909. Mrs. Brill returned to Tampico. She later engaged again in teaching, this time in Prophetstown, and about 1918 she began teaching in the Lincoln school in Sterling, which position she held for eight years, until she returned to Tampico to care for her aged mother.

Last Saturday morning the news was brought to this city that a young woman, named Blanche Brittell, had committed suicide sometime during Friday night at Round Grove. On Friday she purchased a quantity of dry goods, furniture, etc., and hed it conveyed to Round Grove where she intended keeping house. Havind endeavored to rent a house from Mrs. Simonson, but failing to do so, she attempted to take possession of the same without permission, but was met at the place by a man who refused to let her in. SHe then went to a house owned by W.H. Maxfield of this city and put in her goods. Mr. Maxfield learned that she had taken possession and went and ordered her out. She went to the county house and complained of her utter helplessness, when Mr. Ely gave her a supper and informed her that she could remain there till morning. After getting her supper, she returned to the Maxfield house, and it is supposed that here she took poison which caused her death. Mr. Maxfield went there on Saturday morning to move her out of the house but found that she was dead. The coroner was notified and in the afternoon went out, impannelled a jury and held an inquest. Blanche Brittel was a foundling of unknown parentage, and about twenty-two years of age. Friendless, homeless and an outcast, receiving no kindly words to lead her to hope for a better and purer life, she lies in her grave in the potter's field of Grove Hill cemetery. The remains were interred last Sunday afternoon, when quite a number where present to listen to the words o Rev. A.M. White who officiated at the cemetery. His remarks were such that if heeded by those who profess to be christians fewer young women would be led astray and helping hands would be more frequently stretched forth to save the fallen, and lead them to the path of rectitude.
