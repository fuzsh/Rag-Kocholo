        "text": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Nancy Faye Solomonson, the oldest child of former Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, has died at 64.\n\nSolomon, a pioneer in bettering the lives of people with Down syndrome, died Tuesday morning at her winter home in Florida. Her brother, Skip Humphrey, said Friday that she had been battling heart problems and diabetes, but the cause of death has not been established.\n\n\"I'm gonna miss her. She's been a good friend,\" he said.\n\nNancy Humphrey grew up in Minneapolis but was also raised in the Washington, D.C., area as her father's political career took off. Skip Humphrey said his sister had plenty of political opinions but never wanted a political career.\n\n\"She was very proud of what my father and mother did, and she worked very closely with them,\" he said.\n\nShe married C. Bruce Solomonson, and their first child, Victoria, was born with Down syndrome. The couple soon became staunch advocates for people with Down syndrome.\n\nThe Solomonsons helped expand the Twin Cities' Fraser school and community services for those with mental disabilities, he said.\n\nNancy Solomonson, who lived in Plymouth, was a nurse and in recent years she had worked at a clinic in the Twin Cities.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her husband and her parents."
