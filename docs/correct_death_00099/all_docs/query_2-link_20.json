        "text": "Humphrey is perhaps best remembered for his work on Civil Rights. In 1948, while mayor of Minneapolis, the city enacted the nation’s first municipal fair employment law. Humphrey continued his vocal support of civil rights in a fiery speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention, contributing to the party’s adoption of civil rights as part of its platform.\n\nHumphrey served a Democratic Senator from 1948-1964. During this time, he introduced and supported legislation on issues such as civil rights, food stamps, nuclear test ban, and the Peace Corps. He served as Vice President to President Lyndon Johnson beginning in 1965, and ran for President on the Democratic ticket in 1968. Humphrey's stance on Vietnam was unpopular with primary voters, and his nomination as the Democratic candidate for President in 1968 was overshadowed by anti-war protests and riots during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Humphrey ultimately lost the Presidency to Richard Nixon. He returned to the Senate in 1970 and continued to serve as a Senator from Minnesota until his death in 1978.\n\nHumphrey donated his papers to the Minnesota Historical Society in 1973. Researchers may access his papers, as well as other related collections, to better understand Hubert Humphrey’s life of service. For more information on Humphrey’s personal papers, visit the “Primary Sources” section of this guide. Other materials related to Humphrey’s life, such as books, articles, images, or films, are cited throughout this guide."
