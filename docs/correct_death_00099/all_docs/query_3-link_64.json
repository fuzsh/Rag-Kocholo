        "text": "About the Program\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter initiated the Hubert H. Humphrey Fellowship Program in 1978 to honor the memory of the late senator and vice president who had dedicated his career to the advocacy of human rights and international cooperation. Since its inception, more than 6,450 men and women from over 163 countries have been honored as Humphrey Fellows. Approximately 150 fellowships are awarded annually. The program is funded by the U.S. Congress through the U.S. Department of State and implemented by the Institute of International Education.\n\nThe goal of the Hubert H. Humphrey Fellowship Program is to foster knowledge, mutual understanding and serve as a basis for beneficial professional partnerships between citizens of the United States and their counterparts abroad.\n\nU.S. Embassies and Fulbright Commissions nominate applicants who are then selected based on their potential as future leaders in their countries.\n\nFellows must have:\n\nan undergraduate degree;\n\na minimum of five years of substantial, full-time, professional experience;\n\nlimited or no prior experience in the United States;\n\ndemonstrated leadership qualities\n\na record of public service in the community;\n\nand strong English skills.\n\nThe program provides broad professional enrichment through a combination of activities tailored to the Humphrey Fellows' interests. In addition to academic work, all Humphrey Fellows participate in workshops, conferences, and professional affiliations that provide interaction with leaders from all levels of government, multinational organizations, and the private sector.\n\nThe Humphrey Fellowship Program at MSU\n\nSixteen major American universities have been chosen to host Humphrey Fellows based on the universities' excellence in designated fields of study and for the resources and support they offer the fellows. Michigan State University's Humphrey Fellowship Program, which focuses on economic development, has been in place since 2002.\n\nSince that time, MSU has hosted 247 fellows from 98 countries. Humphrey Fellows at MSU have participated in a variety of areas of study and research, including business, economics, public policy, human resources, community sustainability, and law. Fellows bring an international perspective and years of experience, which they share with faculty and students, the university, and the community at large. In addition, fellows learn about American perspectives on leadership, professional practices, and culture."
