        "text": "WCHS participates in the local community’s ‘Buffalo Roam’ activity—a herd of 21 life-size bison statues found in businesses, parks, storefronts and public spaces. Each is individually designed & painted with a story to match so, we’re often asked, why is our statue still white? What’s our story?\n\nContrary to popular belief, bison did not roam this area as it was originally nearly all timber with natural grassy meadows and, more important to this story, lakes well stocked with fish. Buffalo fish, to be precise, named for their large size. Buffalo Lake was named by the Sioux or early traders on account of the large number of buffalo fish in the lake. The area was a famous camping ground of the Sioux who came in summer for fishing and gathering cranberries and in the winter for hunting deer. While they had no established village on the shore of Buffalo Lake, years later many Winnebago inhabited a large village which they named, ‘Buffalo’, in reference to the lake, not bison.*\n\nSo why is our statue unpainted? After much deliberation and a need to stay true to the history of the entire county, staff realized that statue was perfect the way it was for two main reasons:\n\n1. A white bison is considered sacred amongst many Native tribes; keeping the statue white would denote honor and an acknowledgement of those who first inhabited this area.\n\n2. This blank canvas reminds each one of us that Wright County’s history—our collective ‘story’--is waiting to written by us all, and WCHS will be here to collect, preserve, and share that history.\n\n*from D.R. Farnham’s History of Wright County, pp 136-137.\n\nThe Festival of Trees just finished its 13th year with more than 60 individually decorated trees, holiday exhibits and many hands-on activities for all. More than 3000 people visited the FOT during the five weeks it was open, a far cry from the 20 trees & 80 visitors for the inaugural 2007 opening!\n\nStaff work year-round on FOT ideas, developing themes and creating tree decorations for the 4-week transformation of the Hands on History Gallery to a winter wonderland. In fact, this staff member's home has been transformed into a mini-Santa's workshop as sequestered adults are busy at work creating masterpieces for our upcoming 2020 season. If you've never visited and want to see what you're missing, please visit WCHS' YouTube Channel for 2019's brief walk-through of our main FOT gallery HERE.\n\nDid you know ginseng played an important economic role in our county's history? In fact, the Wright County Historical Society used to have ginseng on its' logo!\n\nDirect from D. R. Farnham's 'History of Wright County':\n\n\"While we (early settlers of Wright County)were supplied with many comforts from the hand of Nature, there were other things necessary to complete the list of comforts formerly enjoyed by the settlers. Clothing and groceries required money, and this was so scarce that many families were destitute- and in the spring of 1859 were discouraged.\n\nOn the evening of May 18 two gentlemen from Richmond, VA, Colonel Blaine and Major Goshorn, drove into the village. They asked if ginseng grew in the woods. They thought, from the maple and basswood, it would be plentiful in this timbered country, and they had come from Virginia to buy it. They would prepare it for the Chinese market by washing, clarifying and drying, a process used at that time in preparing the roots for the Chinese trade.\n\nOn the morning of July 19 Mrs. Beebe, my cousin, Frank Ames, and I went into the woods in search of ginseng. It was the writer's good fortune to find the first plant. We dug it and carried it to Colonel Blaine. He pronounced it a fine specimen, and said they would pay gold for all that could be dug. We passed the top and root from one to another, that they might know it in the woods. The digging was done with a narrow hoe made for the purpose. Agencies were established at Buffalo, Watertown and Hassen, for the convenience of the diggers. In a few days the chief occupation was digging ginseng. The price paid in the spring was five cents per pound, and eight and ten cents in the fall, for green roots. Whole families dug. Some good diggers would dig five dollars worth in a day. We dug like a lot of miners, with expectation of finding rich digging every moment. Many of the settlers paid for their land with the money that came with the ginseng.\"\n\nHubert H. Humphrey was born in Wallace, South Dakota and attended the University of Minnesota. Humphrey became involved in Minnesota politics, serving as Minneapolis mayor from 1945-1948, as a U.S. Senator from 1949-1964, and running in various presidential and vice presidential bids between 1952-1964. Humphrey served as Vice President to Lyndon B. Johnson, but lost the following presidential race against Richard Nixon.\n\nIn 1956, Humphrey and his family built a lakefront home in Waverly, MN, where he died in 1978. The Humphrey family became part of the community and were known to be good neighbors. The house is now a chemical dependency center.\n\nWCHS has a large collection of HHH items, from his snowmobile to campaign memorabilia. It’s on display in our Main Gallery. We hope you get to see it soon.\n\nSo many of the words we use today carry over from older technology. From ‘hanging up’ to ‘ring tone’, our telephone vocabulary largely predates cell phones. One thing that did not survive the transition is the party line.\n\nParty lines were local loop telephone circuits that were shared by multiple users. Shared lines were easier to build and were cheaper than private phones. However, the more economic option came with a big inconvenience. Everyone could pick up their phone and hear any call that was taking place! Gossipy neighbors were quick to share news, from hospital trips to personal spats.\n\nYou can see and touch the technology used for party lines in our Hands On History Gallery, including a switchboard and a crank magneto phone (notice the lack of dial or numbers).\n\nThe many lakes of Minnesota led to many more lake resorts. They could be anything from rustic campgrounds to lovely cottages. Some of the earliest resorts in Wright County started off as side businesses for settlers. The Haffner Resort is a prime example.\n\nAnthony Haffner moved from Germany to Minnesota in 1864. He and his family build a farm along Lake Charlotte, which turned out to be a wonderful fishing spot. Visiting friends soon gave way to strangers asking to for a place to stay while they fished. By 1910, the resort had grown to include a collection of cottages, hotel, dance pavilion, ice house, and a fleet of boats.\n\nThe Haffner Resort closed in the 1930s due to low water levels. The family split farm work and running the seasonal resort over several decades and retained fond memories of their many visitors."
