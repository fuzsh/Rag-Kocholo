Humphrey, a lifelong champion for workers' rights.  When Humphrey took office as mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, employment bias was rampant in the city. As mayor, Humphrey worked closely with Black social, political, and community leaders like newspaper owner Cecil Newman and lawyer Lena Olive Smith (both buried at Lakewood), eventually convincing the Minneapolis City Council to adopt the nation’s first municipal Fair Employment bill. In the 1970s, when Humphrey returned to the Senate after serving as Vice President, he worked with California Representative Augustus Hawkins to create a plan with the goal of providing full employment to every citizen over the age of 16 — an effort that resulted in a revision to the Federal Reserve Act that instructed the Fed to pursue maximum employment. As Humphrey ended his time in the senate, he said, “the moral test of government is how the government treats those in the dawn of life, our children; those in the twilight of life, our elderly; and those in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped.” You can pay your respects to Hubert H. Humphrey in Lakewood’s Section 51, Lena Olive Smith in Section 22 and Cecil Newman in the Memorial Mausoleum. \n\n#thisday #onthisday #humphrey #minnesota #minnesotahistory #mnhistory #history #civilrights #humanrights #huberthumphrey #laborday \n\nImage 1: Hubert Humphrey.
