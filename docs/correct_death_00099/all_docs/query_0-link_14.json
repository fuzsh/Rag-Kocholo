        "text": "Five Generations of Descendants of Carpenter and Elizabeth Winslow\n\nFirst Generation\n\n1. Carpenter Winslow, son of James Winslow and Anna Mccausland Huston, was born on Mar 22, 1766 in Pittston, Lincoln (now Kennebec) County, Maine, died on Nov 19, 1827 in Gaskill Township, Jefferson Co, Pa, and was buried in 1827 in North Findley Street Cemetery, then Circle Hill cemetery.\n\nGeneral Notes: With nine sons and no daughters, Carpenter and Elizabeth adopted Lydia Smith who eventually married a man named Henry Smith\n\nThe family of Carpenter Winslow, who came from first Pittston, then Wiscasset, then Bristol Maine, in 1818, were the first to settle in what is now Gaskill township which occupies the southeastern corner of Jefferson county, PA. . They cleared the land and made the first improvements. The family of Carpenter Winslow, who came from Maine, in 1818, were the first to settle the old homestead in what is now Gaskill (then Perry Township)township, Jefferson County Pa. They cleared the land and made the first improvements. Leaving Maine where Carpenter owned a shipyard they came to Gaskill Township by way of the Chesapeake Bay and the West Branch of the Susquehanna River.\n\nThey were early pioneers to Elk County. Natives of Maine, they came to Clearfield County, PA. in 1820. They lived there one year, then went to Punxsutawney, PA until 1828, when they removed to Benezette Township, Elk County. They apparently endured many hardships incident to pioneer life, bringing all their provisions in a canoe from Lock Haven (a distance of 75 miles), taking two and a half days to push the canoe up the stream.\n\nIt is said he first made a temporary location in Clearfield County in 1819 at which time he purchased his farm in what is now Gaskill Township and after erecting buildings settled there in 1821. Was the first family to settle in Gaskill Township which was then dense wilderness and the had to undergo many privations. They found healthy climate and where soil thought hard to clear was productive and soon had grain and feed . and with surrounding forests and streams had game and fish . One difficulty was to carry gain 20 plus miles to a mill. Soon Dr John W Jenks came and so did the Bowers family. approximately 1818, Carpenter and Elizabeth Colburn Winslow and their extended families traveled from Maine on the Atlantic Ocean to the Chesapeake Bay; to the Susquehanna River; and following the West Branch of the Susquehanna arrived in Clearfield, PA. Here Carpenter built a bridge across the Susquehanna, and after a short time, the families moved overland to Gaskill Township, just outside Punxsutawney, PA, where they established a homestead. In 1828, Carpenter Winslow, Jr. and his wife, Beulah Keene Winslow, along with his brothers, Reuben and Ebenezer Winslow, moved on to what is now Winslow Hill in Benezette, Elk County, PA.\n\nBy His Excellency Samuel Adams, Esquire,\n\nGovernor and Commander in Chief of the\n\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\nTo Carpenter Winslow, Gentleman, Greeting\n\nYou being appointed Lieutenant of a Company in the Cavalry of the Second Brigade, Eighth Division of the Militia of this Commonwealth.\n\nBy Virtue of the Power vested in me, I do by these Presents, (reposing Special Trust and Confidence in your Ability, Courage and good Conduct) COMMISSION you accordingly: ----\n\nYou are therefore, carefully and diligently to discharge the Duty of Lieutenant\n\nin Leading, Ordering and Exercising said Company in Arms, both inferior Officers and Soldiers; and to keep them in good Order and Discipline: And they are hereby commanded to obey you as their Lieutenant.

Winslow was chosen Justice, Carpenter Winslow as Supervisor; R. C. Winslow as school director; Charles Winslow as fence viewer.

The story was originally by Herman MacMinn whose father was chief engineer of the ill -started project.\n\nThe Winslow family originally came to Pennsylvania at an early date from the state of Maine. Of the four brothers James settled near Punxsutawney and Carpenter, Ebenezer, and Reuben came to Bennett's Valley before 1830. Carpenter choose a small farm about a quarter mile ease of Benezette, Reuben became the founder of the community of Benezette, and Ebenezer lived a mile west where Julius Jones later did. Carpenter had a son names George who gave his name to Winslow Hill before he died in 1905. Eben and his family went west in 1858.\n\nReuben became an extensive landowner, and the Pennsylvania Archives list purchases made by him and his brother Eben as early as 1833 and 1837. Shortly after these dates, surveys were made up the Bennett's Branch and Trout Run for the Sunbury and Eric Railroad. Again in 1855 a second survey was made, and Reuben Winslow had high expectations that his coal and timber would soon have a way to reach urban markets. To his disappointment , the railroad was built up Driftwood Branch to Emporium. His first thought was to build a sixteen mile spur to the Philadelphia and Eric (as the railroad was now called) at Driftwood. With the legal assistance of his son-in-law, Rush Petrikin, an attorney at Bellafonte and perhaps the only graduate of West Point from Benezette Township. Winslow applied in 1862 to the legislature for a charter. Under the provisions of this incorporation , the Winslow Colliery Railroad was capitalized at $200,000. Before work could begin on construction, however, other events altered the original purpose of this project.\n\nNoted events in his life were:\n\n He appeared on the Census census in 1820 in Lawrence Township(Clearfield), Clearfield Co, Pa.

He was, however, induced to accept the appointment from Governor Briggs as state commissioner under an act incorporating the proprietors of Maiden bridge. A brief extract from an article written by his minister, Rev. John G. Adams, will convoy to the readers the esteem in which he was held by the town of his adoption.\n\n\"Nine mouths ago our friend left his home for California, taken there by business and a desire to meet his only son, who had been absent from home some years, and who had crossed the Pacific from China to take up his residence in the new land of success and failure. His death is an affliction to us all: to the town, to the neighborhood in which he lived, to our church, to his dear family, and to many other families and friends. He had resided here more than twenty years. He was one of our most efficient citizens. His retiring from business was not retiring from active life. He was still the busy man, taking care of what he had accumulated, and doing good with it. His generous-heartedness was proverbial. On many an occasion has it been evidenced to his credit, and to the credit of us all. His good taste, his love of order, his prudence as well as liberality in expenditure, his integrity and honesty, are all but so many other commendations of his character as a public citizen. In these respects he has left the good impression of himself in many ways, in many a mind. He was one of the most able, faithful, and steadfast friends of our society.\n\n\"There are those here who have known him longer than myself, who, when aid has been most needed in times of past trial and exertion, have known most his liberality. It was constant and unchanging. His friendships were many and highly valued. Fresh and fragrant will be the rememberance of him in many hearts.\"\n\nHe married in Maiden, Mass., 13 Feb. 1821, Elizabeth Reid, b. 13 July 1799, Boston, who removed to Maiden in her first year.
