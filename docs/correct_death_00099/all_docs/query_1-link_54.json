        "text": "Kathleen “Kitty” Ableman of Winona, formerly of Pine City, passed away at St. Mary’s Hospital in Rochester on Monday, May 29, 2023 at the age of 34.\n\nKathleen Evelyn Ableman was born January 12, 1989 at the Rush City Hospital. She graduated from Pine City High School and went on to study at the Hubert H. Humphrey Job Corps.\n\nKitty, as her family lovingly called her, enjoyed playing video games and reading fantasy books. One of her favorites was the Harry Potter series. She also very much enjoyed the Lord of the Rings movies with a special fondness for Elijah Woods' character of Frodo.\n\nOf all her many adventures, one she treasured above others was her trip to Ireland in 2005. Kathleen had a fierce love and loyalty to her family and friends. She always had a comforting word or joke to lighten the burden of those she cared for.\n\nKitty is survived by her mother Phyllis Schoumaker; sisters Sharon Schoumaker, Lily Schoumaker; brother James Schoumaker; grandmother El Vera Ableman; aunt Florence Lindahl; uncles Phillip Ableman, Edward Ableman; many great aunts, uncles, cousins, other relatives and friends.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her grandfather James Ableman.\n\nA Celebration of Kathleen’s Life will be held from 11 AM – 3 PM Saturday, July 15, 2023 at the Princeton Civic Center in Princeton."
