        "text": "Brandon Lee Schlaak, born on August 6th, 1987, to Gary and Christine (Berg) Schlaak in Albert Lea, MN, was a beloved son, brother, uncle, and friend. He passed away on April 8th, 2024, at his home in New Richland, MN.\n\nBrandon spent his early years in Palisade, MN, before settling in New Richland with his family. He was a proud graduate of NRHEG School in 2007, where he excelled as a multi-sport athlete in football, cross country, wrestling, and baseball. In his wrestling career, Brandon earned the nickname \"Showtime\" from Coach Cyr for always showing up when it was time to shine. His dedication and skill earned him third place in the individual MN State High School Wrestling Tournament in 2007. Brandon’s junior year baseball season began with a game that was played at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome.\n\nAfter graduation, Brandon briefly attended Riverland College before pursuing various job opportunities working at Holland Ag, Hi Yield, and Arctic Ice. He also gained experience a summer at Veyance Technologies in Iowa. His generosity knew no bounds, as he later took on the role as a caretaker for his grandfather and mother. Brandon embodied the true essence of kindness and generosity. His adventurous spirit led him on family trips, including visits to Nebraska, annual camping excursions with the Schlaak family to Yogi's in Warrens, WI, and a trip to Florida with his mom and brother, Gaven.\n\nWhether it was grilling up delicious smash burgers or Philly cheesesteaks for family and friends, or assisting with coaching the NRHEG wrestling team, his willingness to help others shone through in everything he did. He was often referred to as the “Supervisor” as he waited for others to take on some of the unfavorable chores and knew someone else would complete the job. He had a passion for playing video games and was known as \"Madden\" for his impressive ability to recall game stats with ease. His love for family gatherings and activities was evident in his enthusiasm for every moment spent together. One family snowmobile outing had Brandon excited for an eventful day, until a few minutes into the ride when he quickly turned around to head back home because he was cold.\n\nHe found joy in spending time with his nieces and nephews, creating cherished memories that will be forever treasured. Brandon's love for his family was unparalleled. His smile and kind heart touched the lives of many, and his absence will be deeply felt by all who knew him.\n\nBrandon will be lovingly remembered by his parents, Christine Schlaak and Gary (Jackie) Schlaak; brothers, Justin (Kim), Nathan (Lindsey), and Gaven (Rachel); nieces and nephews, Kordell, Aidan, Gabrielle, Ryan, Dakota, Madison, and Graham; grandmothers, Sylvia Berg and Carol Schlaak; aunts and uncles, Carol (Mike) Hedberg, Charlie (Amy) Berg, Neil (Jill) Schlaak, Keith (Kelly) Schlaak, Donna Schlaak, and Linda (Darrin) Stadheim; along with numerous cousins.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his grandfathers, Bill Berg and Harlan Schlaak.\n\nA funeral service will be held on Sunday, April 14th, 2024, at 2:00 PM at St John’s Evangelical Lutheran Church in Alma City, MN; Pastor Robert Harting will officiate. Brandon’s family will greet guests at a visitation on Saturday, April 13th, 2024, from 2:00 PM – 5:00 PM at Friedrich’s Funeral Home in New Richland, MN and one hour prior to the service at the church. Interment will be at Alma City Cemetery.\n\nIn lieu of flowers and gifts, memorial contributions may be given to Brandon’s family.\n\nA passionate soul with a heart of gold, Brandon will be deeply missed by all who knew him. May his spirit soar among the stars, forever guiding and watching over us with love and laughter."
