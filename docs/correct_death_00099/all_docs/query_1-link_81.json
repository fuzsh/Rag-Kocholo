        "text": "Inside the Commission\n\nNATIONAL ARCHIVES AWARDS $2.9 MILLION IN GRANTS FOR DOCUMENTARY EDITING AND ARCHIVAL PROJECTS\n\nOn May 18, Archivist of the United States David S. Ferriero awarded 31 grants totaling $2.9 million for historical records projects in 18 states and the District of Columbia. The National Archives grants program is carried out through the National Historical Publications and Records Commission.\n\nGrants totaling $1.2 million were recommended for 16 documentary editing projects to publish the papers of key American figures, including Frederick Douglass, Walt Whitman, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, Martin Luther King, Jr., Eleanor Roosevelt, Andrew Jackson, Thomas Edison, Jane Addams, and the Presidential Recordings from the Kennedy and Nixon administrations.\n\nGrants totaling $1.4 million were recommended for 14 archival projects, including the W.L. Eury Appalachian Collection at Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina; the backlog of unprocessed records at the South Dakota State Archives; the papers of California governor Edmund G. \"Pat\" Brown; Vietnam War-era poster collections; the records of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission; and the Pan American World Airways records at the University of Miami.\n\nLuther College in Decorah, Iowa received a grant for a three-year project to design and host the Archives Leadership Institute, a program that brings together 25 archivists for a week-long intensive program to develop their skills in serving their institutions and the public.\n\nSee the Press Release for a complete list of awards.\n\nNEW LOGO UNVEILED\n\nIn order to reinforce the connection with the National Archives, the National Historical Publications and Records Commission has created a new logo. The eagle is a hand-drawn depiction of the stone statues that sit atop the National Archives Building in Washington, DC.\n\n\"Eagles traditionally represent strength, courage, farsightedness, and immortality, and wings symbolize forward movement, swiftness, and protection. The National Archives strives to carry out its mission with the vision to serve not only the citizens of today, but also those of the future,\" said Archivist of the United States David S. Ferriero.\n\nThe National Historical Publications and Records Commission was created in the same Act of Congress that established the National Archives. Signed into law on June 19, 1934, the Act calls for such a commission to complement the work of the National Archives by making \"plans, estimates, and recommendations for such historical works and collections of sources as seems appropriate for publication and/or otherwise recording at the public expense.\" The framers of the act sought such a mechanism to make public not only those nationally significant papers held by the Federal government but also those historical records held in other collections which are important to the history of the United States.\n\nGrant Deadlines\n\nThe following Grant opportunities are currently available online:\n\nDocumenting Democracy: Access to Historical Records\n\nFor projects to promote the preservation and use of the nation's most valuable archival resources. Projects should expand our understanding of the American past by facilitating and enhancing access to primary source materials.\n\nFinal Deadline: October 4, 2012\n\nInnovation in Archives and Documentary Editing\n\nFor projects to explore innovative methods to improve the preservation, public discovery, or use of historical records.\n\nFinal Deadline: October 4, 2012\n\nPublishing Historical Records\n\nFor proposals to publish historical records of national significance.\n\nNew Republic through the Modern Era -- Final Deadline: October 4, 2012\n\nState and National Archival Partnership Grants\n\nFor projects to strengthen archives and historical records programs in each of the states and build a national archival network.\n\nFinal Deadline: September 6, 2012\n\nGo to Grant Opportunities for more information.\n\nNews from the Field\n\nEleanor Roosevelt: Spokesperson for Democracy\n\nThe Eleanor Roosevelt Papers, Volume 2: The Human Rights Years, 1949-1952 was recently published by the University of Virginia Press. The project is located at George Washington University and has been supported by the National Archives through NHPRC grants since 2000.\n\nThe volume traces Eleanor Roosevelt's transformation into one of the era's most prominent spokespersons for democracy and human rights, and details the broader impact she had on American politics, the United Nations, and global affairs. Introduced by Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the former Secretary-General of the UN, the volume begins with documents promoting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and concludes with her final remarks on the floor of the United Nations.\n\nWhile her work as the U.S. delegate to the UN is the primary focus, it also lands upon the rise of McCarthyism, the Korean War, the second Truman administration, and the election of Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nAnd Eleanor was just as committed to human rights at home. In response to a letter asking her to oppose policies on \"race mixing,\" she had this to say in her reply on July 18, 1951:\n\nDo you think that the good Lord meant to keep people He created apart in little sections and then allow us to go ahead and develop so that we cross each others' paths? If you think that was the intention of the Lord, then how much you feel over the fact that we brought people from Africa to this country in chains? Why should giving all people equal opportunity and allowing them all to develop bring about 'disaster, confusion and chaos'? People are not oil and water. When they know each other, they mix very well. It is simpler I think for everyone to respect everyone else than it is to choose special people who shall have special respect."
