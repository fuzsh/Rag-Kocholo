        "text": "Part 1: His Arrival on the National Stage\n\nThere are many political figures in the 20th century who I respect. There are fewer that I admire. But of all the men who ran have made failed runs for President in the twentieth century — and with the exception of perhaps two or three others since the founding of the Republic — there is only one who I outright worship.\n\nFrom his debut on the national scene in 1948 to his death nearly thirty years later, Hubert Humphrey was one of the most respected, popular and beloved Senators on either side of the aisle. Today he is remembered almost entirely for his career as LBJ’s Vice President and being one of the biggest apologists for the Vietnam War, a fact that almost certainly destroyed his chance for the Presidency in 1968. This is horribly unfair to Humphrey who was from the start of his career a man of true principles and perhaps the greatest representative of liberal causes practically from the beginning of his career. He was far ahead of the curve of either political party on civil rights when there was no political gain in doing so and his refusal to compromise on so many issues ended up hindering his political ambitions throughout his career.\n\nHe freely admitted that he made many sacrifices in his career with the sole goal of being President of the United States. But unlike most politicians, the power of the office was only one consideration. He genuinely believed that he could do good for America in his office and had an idealism that had rarely been equaled before and almost never since. There is an argument that after his defeat in 1968, the Democratic Party — perhaps either one — has ever put forth a candidate with either the credentials or the potential to be a truly great President. The fact that he never achieved his goals is truly a tragedy for the nation, particularly considering that most of what stood in his way was not his fault.\n\nThis series of articles will deal with the career of Hubert Humphrey, the battles he waged in the Senate on behalf of Civil rights, his many campaigns for higher office both before and after his failed run in 1968, and how his timing was both well ahead of the country and then suddenly too late for it.\n\nI should mention upfront that of all the political figures in the twentieth century who have not become President that I am incredibly well-versed on Humphrey’s career. I have read multiple biographies of Humphrey’s life, studied his political ambitions in The Making of the President Series by Theodore White and for the purposes of much of these articles Robert Mann’s exceptional The Walls of Jericho, a history that studies the struggle for Civil Rights through the lives and political careers of Humphrey, LBJ and Richard Russell. Much of what I am about to write in at least the first two articles will come from this source material.\n\nHubert Humphrey was born in the small prairie town of Wallace, South Dakota on May 27, 1911. The second of the four children of Hubert Senior (known in South Dakota as H.H.) and Christine, the family moved to the slightly larger town of Doland, so that his father could open a drug store and ice cream parlor. H.H. was an intellectual and a huge talker — trends that he would pass down to his son. H.H. had converted from the GOP to the Democrats upon hearing the legendary ‘Cross of Gold speech’ from Willian Jennings Bryan — beliefs that his wife never embraced but his son would. He also instilled in his son the values of charity, hard work and social justice. His popularity would eventually lead to H.H. becoming alderman and eventually the Mayor of Doland.\n\nHubert would enroll in the University of Minnesota in 1929 but would be forced to drop out in 1930 when the Depression caused the failure of the Humphrey family business. He abandoned college to work as a pharmacist and quickly became impressed with FDR’s New Deal.\n\nIn 1932, Hubert would meet college student Muriel Buck. After an extended courtship they would wed in 1936 and she would be his greatest supporter for the rest of his life, as much of a political figure as he was.\n\nVisiting his sister in D.C. in 1935, he began to believe in his father’s dream of public service. As a result, he eventually had to tell his father that he would not return to South Dakota to run his father’s new store to seek a higher education and eventually public office of his own. At that time, H.H was serving in the South Dakota legislature and had ambitions of higher office. However, he was willing to sacrifice his political ambitions for his sons — a decision that America is almost certainly richer for.\n\nIn June of 1939, Humphrey finally managed to graduate with a degree in Political Science from the University of Minnesota. With sights on a post graduate degree, he accepting a teaching position at LSU in 1940. It is safe to say that experience had perhaps the greatest effect on Humphrey’s views on the world.\n\nHumphrey had never been to the South, but within a few months he became aware not only of the evils of segregation in the South, but also the prejudice in the North. As he put in later this gave ‘flesh and blood commitment to what before had been only an abstract concept of human rights.”\n\nAfter earning his master’s degree — and a reputation for verbosity that he would never escape (though he really never tried that hard) — he returned to Minnesota a year later. There he took on what was his first full-time job as the WPA’s head of the worker’s education service. Within a year he was the regional director of the War Manpower Association and made his first foray to politics when he ran for Mayor of Minneapolis in 1942. He narrowly lost the election but had no intention of that being the end of his career — even then, he was always ambitious and looking towards the next election.\n\nHe spent the next two years playing a critical role in the union between the often feuding but kindred Democratic and Farm-Labor parties, eventually becoming the leader of what would be known in Minnesota as the DFL. In 1994, he attended his first Democratic National Convention as a delegate and would later run Minnesota’s Roosevelt-Truman campaign. (Minnesota went for FDR that year.) The next year he ran again for mayor of Minneapolis and this time won.\n\nMuch of his time as Mayor was directed towards reducing the severe crime problem in the city but the Mayor had few official duties. Humphrey would rely on his personality and boundless energy to aid the government. After winning reelection, one of his key measures was to reform the city’s official and unofficial discrimination against minorities. This would lead to the nation’s first ever Fair Employment Practices Commission, which opened doors not only to African Americans, but also Jews and Native Americans.\n\nEventually he would join fellow national liberal leaders to form the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA). At their first national convention in 1947, he made a powerful and passionate call for action on Civil Rights, something that the Democratic Party, still heavily dominated by the South, refused to do. The next year the Minnesota Democrats nominated him as their candidate for Senate.\n\nThe 1948 Democratic Convention in Philadelphia was a gloomy affair. Everyone was certain that the incumbent Harry Truman was doomed for defeat in November against the Republican Thomas Dewey. (Dewey will earn his own series someday.) Well before the convention began there had been a movement to have Truman removed from the head of the ticket with Dwight Eisenhower who had refused. Truman was facing a revolt from both the left and right wing of his party. Henry Wallace, who Truman had replaced as Vice President in 1944, was running as the candidate of the New Progressive Party, a very far left wing that opposed the administration’s policies towards the Soviet Union’s rise in Eastern Europe. On the right wing, a movement known as the Dixiecrats was rising in the South, infuriated by the growing position on civil rights. Members of the Southern States delegation were planning a walkout during the convention.\n\nOne Southern Democrat had no plans to join the walkout, despite his sympathy with the Dixiecrats views. Richard Russell had represented Georgia in the Senate since 1932 and while he did not agree with the direction the party was turning, party unity was always at the forefront of his mind. He agreed to have his name placed in nomination for President as a measure of defiance at the convention: he would receive 263 votes. During the nominations for Vice President, an obscure Alabama delegate named George Wallace would place his name in nomination. He would be asked to head the Dixiecrat Presidential ticket but would turn them down.\n\nRussell was one of the most prominent pro-segregation voices in the Senate in 1948 and was as racist as many of them. But unlike so many of the other adamant segregationists in elected office, Russell would eventually come to realize that he was fighting a losing battle, one that was merely delaying the inevitable. Like many of the Southern Democrats Russell had the potential to be a great President, but his unyielding behavior on the most important domestic issue of the 20th century would make him unacceptable to the party.\n\nThis would be the first time that Russell and Humphrey would be at center stage on the national landscape and as would almost always be the case, they would be at complete loggerheads. Humphrey was determined to challenge the Democratic platforms basically innocuous position on civil rights.\n\nHumphrey faced an impossible choice. If the challenge he was planning failed, he would be a national laughingstock. But if it succeeded, the South would walk out, the party would lose votes from the South and he would be a scapegoat for the defeat in November. After receiving the support of both his father and his wife — both of whom told him it was the right thing to do — he decided to speak in favor of the amendment.\n\nThe speech that Humphrey gave in support of the minority amendment is one of the great speeches in the history of American politics. Reading from his speech word for word, the emotion in his voice began to build arguing that there could be ‘no hedging, no watering down” before he reached the full flower of his power in one of the great speeches in twentieth century history:\n\n“My friends, to those who say that we are rushing this issue of civil rights, I say we are 172 years too late! To those who say that this civil rights program is an infringement on states’ rights, I say this, that the time has arrived in America for the Democratic Party to get out of the shadow of states’ rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights…This is the issue of the Twentieth Century, people of all kinds, and these people are looking to America for leadership and they are looking to America for precepts and examples!…Let us forget the evil patience and the blindness of the past…Now is the time to recall those on that path for American freedom!”\n\n(The speech in its entirety can be found on YouTube as the Philadelphia convention was the first broadcast on national TV.)\n\nHumphrey’s speech galvanized the moribund convention. He was interrupted twenty times during the eight speech and the ovation lasted nearly as long — incredible for a speech from a practically unknown mayor from Minnesota. As many as seventy million people may have seen or heard Humphrey’s speech.\n\nThe effect was immediate. The states’ rights platform was overwhelmingly crushed and the stronger language by Humphrey narrowly prevailed. The South had been the deciding vote on civil rights for over half a century; on what was their textbook issue they had, in the words of a former Georgia Senator, not merely been defeated but overwhelmingly humiliated.\n\nThe walkout that had been feared did happen — the Alabama delegation and half that of Mississippi did walk out of the convention. But the day belonged to Hubert Humphrey.\n\nThere were many factors that led to Truman’s upset victory that November. But one of the critical ones was not only fact that the so called Dixiecrat defection was not nearly as severe as had been thought at the time — they would carry four states and 39 electoral votes for Strom Thurmond — but the civil rights plank would help add African-American voters in the north to the Democratic coalition.\n\nAnother factor was almost certain several strong Democrats Senators and Governors on many states. They included Robert Kerr of Oklahoma, Estes Kefauver of Tennessee, Paul Douglas of Illinois, — and Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota.\n\nTexas had also been a strong factor in Truman’s win, but it was hard to argue that the man running for election to the Senate had been a key factor in the victory. Lyndon Johnson had finished Election day behind his opponent in the Texas runoff by less than 400 votes. In what would be one of the most consequential cases of election fraud in American history, Johnson supporters in two Texas counties manufactured the votes of more than 200 citizens. The amended results — combined with ‘corrections’ in other counties would give him a margin of 87 votes over Coker Stevenson. Stevenson fought a massive challenge but ‘Landslide Lyndon’ as he would be sarcastically dubbed, managed to prevail.\n\nFor the next sixteen years the careers of Johnson, Russell and Humphrey would clash over the issue of civil rights again and again. Johnson’s relation towards both men ended up responsible for some of the greatest legislative actions of the 20th century — as well as one of the greatest foreign disasters of all time.\n\nIn my next article I will deal with Humphrey’s early years in the Senate and his first attempts to put himself forward as a national candidate."
