        "text": "Two political issues that recurred during Robert Kennedy's life — the fight against Communism, and the struggle for racial equality — exploded in 1968.\n\nA growing number of Americans despaired over their nation's military involvement in Vietnam, fueling a youth counterculture. \"Hippies\" grew their hair long, protested the war and the pro-war \"Establishment,\" and \"turned on\" with psychedelic drugs. Student uprisings in foreign places, including Prague, Paris, and Mexico City, erupted during a Cold War standoff between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.\n\nAt home, despite the civil rights movement's successes, Americans remained divided over race relations. Protesters turned to radical language and methods. Two assassinations added turmoil and uncertainty to a year full of shocks.\n\nExamine some of the events of 1968 below.\n\nJanuary 1, Mumps Vaccine\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration approves a vaccine against mumps for human use. By 1987, reported cases will decrease by more than 98 percent.\n\nJanuary 6, Heart Transplant\n\nDr. Norman Shumway performs the first successful human heart transplant in the United States at Stanford University.\n\nJanuary 14, Super Bowl II\n\nThe Green Bay Packers win the National Football League's second annual Super Bowl, defeating the Oakland Raiders 33-14.\n\nJanuary 16, Yippies Founded\n\nAbbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin and other activists establish the Youth International Party -- known as the \"Yippies.\" Counter-culture themes and imagery invade popular culture and advertising.\n\nJanuary 17, State of the Union\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson addresses the nation, boasting that in Vietnam \"the enemy has been defeated in battle after battle,\" and that \"our patience and our perseverance will match our power.\"\n\nJanuary 23\n\nU.S. Ship Captured\n\nA North Korean patrol boat captures the U.S.S. Pueblo, an American intelligence-gathering vessel. Its 83-man crew is accused of violating a twelve-mile territorial limit. President Johnson uses the crisis to justify calling up 14,000 military reserves. It will take most of the year to negotiate the crew's release.\n\nJanuary 30, RFK Critiques LBJ\n\nSenator Robert Kennedy tells reporters he is not planning on challenging President Johnson for the Democratic presidential nomination. But he criticizes Johnson's Vietnam policy, and his indifference to the plight of urban blacks. When asked why, he says, \"It's a political decision. There are more white people than black people.\"\n\nJanuary 31, Tet Offensive\n\nShortly after midnight, North Vietnamese soldiers begin the Tet Offensive. The assault involves nearly 70,000 North Vietnamese troops and lasts for weeks. Americans watch on television as the North Vietnamese wage war up and down the country, even taking the U.S. Embassy in Saigon for a few hours.\n\nFebruary 1, Execution Photo\n\nAmerican photographer Eddie Adams takes a Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph of South Vietnamese policeman Nguyen Ngoc Loan executing a Viet Cong prisoner. The image's brutality shocks viewers and reinforces doubts about America's South Vietnamese allies, further galvanizing the anti-war movement.\n\nFebruary 2, Candidate Nixon\n\nCalifornia Republican Richard Nixon announces that he will run for president.\n\nFebruary 6, Winter Olympics\n\nThe 10th Winter Olympic Games — the first to be broadcast live and in color — open in Grenoble, France. East and West German athletes participate on separate teams, and the International Olympic Committee enacts mandatory drug and gender verification testing of all athletes.\n\nDemocratic Sniping\n\n(A Look magazine article quotes Democratic presidential hopeful Senator Eugene McCarthy on the much-discussed prospect of Robert Kennedy entering the race. McCarthy says Kennedy \"will have a fight on his hands to see who has the most strength. I will not step aside voluntarily.\"\n\nFebruary 7, Illegal Drug Use\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson establishes the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to stop the spread of illegal drug use. More Americans have begun \"tripping\" on L.S.D. — lysergic acid diethylamide, a hallucination-inducing drug first synthesized in the 1930s.\n\nFebruary 10, U.S. Gold Medal\n\nNineteen-year-old Peggy Fleming wins America's sole gold medal at the Grenoble Winter Olympics, in women's figure skating.\n\nFebruary 24, Pulsars Found\n\nAstrophysicists Jocelyn Bell and Anthony Hewish discover pulsating stars, or \"pulsars,\" at a British observatory, making waves in the fields of astrophysics and cosmology.\n\nFebruary 27,Cronkite Questions War\n\nIn a special report following a trip to Vietnam, well-respected mainstream journalist Walter Cronkite questions Washington's optimism in the wake of the Tet Offensive. Cronkite asks whether the war is winnable and advocates a negotiated withdrawal, \"not as victors, but as an honorable people who lived up to their pledge to defend democracy, and did the best they could.\"\n\nFebruary 28, Request for Troops\n\nGeneral William Westmoreland asks President Johnson to send an additional 206,000 soldiers to Vietnam. Johnson delays and eventually denies the request, but allows the number of soldiers to increase gradually.\n\nMarch 2, RFK Explores Run\n\nRobert Kennedy and his advisors meet at Hickory Hill to discuss his entry into the presidential race. Kennedy's reasons for considering the move include his unhappiness over President Johnson's handling of Vietnam, and the White House's near-silence about a Kerner Commission report on the corrosive effects of racism in America.\n\nMarch 9, The Beatles at the Grammys\n\nWinners at the 10th Grammy Awards include The 5th Dimension's \"Up, Up and Away\" (Record of the Year) and Bobbie Gentry (Best New Artist). The Beatles take home four awards for their album, \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\"\n\nMarch 10, Farm Workers Protest\n\nRobert Kennedy flies to Delano, California, to help labor organizer Cesar Chavez end a 25-day fast to protest violence against striking migrant farm workers.\n\nMarch 12, NH Primary\n\nMinnesota senator Eugene McCarthy comes within a few hundred votes of beating President Lyndon Johnson in New Hampshire's Democratic primary. McCarthy's surprisingly strong showing is powered by an anti-war message and a \"children's crusade\" by several thousand student volunteers who cut their hair and become \"clean for Gene\" to attract more conservative voters.\n\nMarch 16, RFK Announces\n\nSenator Robert Kennedy ends months of speculation by announcing his candidacy for president. Anticipating accusations of selfishness and opportunism, he opens by saying, \"I do not run for the presidency merely to oppose any man, but to propose new policies.\"\n\nMy Lai Massacre\n\nThough it will not become publicly known for more than a year, U.S. soldiers massacre more than 500 Vietnamese civilians in the village of My Lai.\n\nMarch 18, Reactions to RFK\n\nAlthough newspaper editorials question Kennedy's motives for entering the presidential race, voters show frenzied support at the candidate's first campaign stops. After he speaks at Kansas State University, journalist Jack Newfield writes, \"The fieldhouse sounded as though it was inside Niagara Falls. It was like a soundtrack gone haywire.\"\n\nMarch 22, Thaw in Communist Bloc\n\nIn Czechoslovakia, a movement for liberal reform of the centrally-planned economy gains supporters, following years of recession and a weak government response. President Antonin Novotny resigns amid charges of corruption, and the liberalizing \"Prague Spring\" begins. The events put Moscow on alert and prompt a meeting of Warsaw Pact countries in East Germany to discuss the crisis.\n\nMarch 31, LBJ Withdraws\n\nPresident Johnson delivers a national television address to explain a de-escalation of the U.S. bombing campaign in Vietnam.
