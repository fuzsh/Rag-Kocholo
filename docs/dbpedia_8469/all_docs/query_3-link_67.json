        "text": "Blaise Pascal\n\nBlaise pascal this name needs no introduction. Blaise pascal was a french mathematician, physicist, inventor, and writer. He is known for working on working on the concepts of fluids, vacuum, and pressure. Pascal was one of the first persons to build a calculator. which is known as pascal’s calculator.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTime and place of birth\n\nEarly life\n\nAdulthood\n\nEducation and carrier\n\nInteresting facts\n\nMathematical achievements\n\nPascal’s theorem\n\nTheory of probability\n\nTheory of probability\n\nArthematical triangle\n\nPascaline\n\nBooks written by Blaise pascal\n\nQuotes by Blaise pascal\n\nFAQ\n\nIn popular culture\n\nUniversity\n\nMovie\n\nSee also\n\nTime and place of birth\n\nSeventeenth century’s this great french mathematician was born to Etienne pascal and Antoinette begon on 19th June 1623, in Clermont Ferrand Auvergne, France.\n\nEarly life\n\nPascal lived with his family in the Auvergne region of France. But life is not the bed of roses he lost his mother at a very young age. In1631 after five years of her mother’s death, pascal’s family migrated to Paris.\n\nHis father also had an interest in science and maths and encouraged the young pascal to do so. Pascal’s father never remarried and spend his time for her children’s better education. Pascal had two sisters named Gilberte and Jacqueline.\n\nWhen pascal was just sixteen years old he proved a theorem which is known in the world as pascal’s theorem. In 1639 pascal’s father was appointed as a king’s commission tax collector for the city of Reoun.\n\nWhen pascal was barely 19 he invented a calculator in 1642 to ease the workload of his father. Later this calculator is known as pascaline. Only eight such calculators survived till the date.\n\nAdulthood\n\nIn 1646 when pascal’s father was collecting tax he slips in the street and broke his hip at that time a hip injury was fatal.

Because of all these circumstances, Blaise lived the rest of his life in poverty. Pascal never married and died as a bachelor.\n\nEducation and carrier\n\nPascal’s career began at the very small age of 16 when he presented a theorem later known as pascal’s theorem. Then in 1642, he built pascaline the famous calculator named after him.\n\nThen in 1654 prompted by his friend chevalier de mere he corresponded with Pierre de Fermat and gave the world the theory of probability. In the same year, he wrote about a triangle which was published in 1665 the world known this triangle as pascal’s triangle.\n\nInteresting facts\n\nPascal’s calculator which is also known as pascalines, only eight such are left today, four of them held by the Musee des Arts et metries.\n\nPascal is the inventor of the hydraulic press, there is a law in hydraulics known as pascal’s law.\n\nPascal is a renowned literary figure also he is one of the prominent figures of the classical literary period of France.\n\nPascal is also known as a philosopher he was a dualist like France’s greatest philosopher Rene Descartes.\n\nMathematical achievements\n\nBlaise contributed all his life to maths. He was the first person to proved the conic theorem also known as pascal’s theorem. He was one of the first inventors of the calculator. which this world has known as pascaline named after him.\n\nHe gave the world the theory of probability which is very vital for economics in modern time. Also with this, he gave us an arthematical triangle which we have known as pascal’s triangle.\n\nContribution in mathematics\n\nBlaise pascal contributed throughout all his life in mathematics. His contributions towards maths are here:\n\nPascal’s theorem\n\nWhen pascal was just a 16-year-old boy he began working on a theorem which is popularly known as essays of conics. Pascal presented this theorem and world-known it as pascal’s theorem.\n\nPascaline\n\nThis was his one of the most important contribution towards maths, a calculator. He is said to be one of the first inventors of the calculator. Pascal’s calculator is known as pascaline.\n\nTheory of probability\n\nPascal worked on this theory with another famous mathematician Fermat due to his friend Mere. Today this theory is very important for economics.\n\nArthematical triangle\n\nIn 1654 Blaise wrote about this but unfortunately, this was published after his death In 1665. This mathematical triangle presents the binomial coefficients.\n\nBooks written by Blaise pascal\n\nPensees\n\nLettres provincials\n\nThe mind on fire\n\nThe thoughts of Blaise pascal\n\nDiscourses on the conditions of the great\n\nDe l’esprit geometrique\n\nThe physical treatise of pascal\n\nDiscorso Sobre las pasiones del amor\n\nL’oeuvere de pascal\n\nQuotes by Blaise pascal\n\n“Small minds are concerned with the extraordinary, great minds with the ordinary.”\n\nBlaise pascal\n\n“It is the fight alone that pleases us, not the victory.”\n\nBlaise pascal\n\n“Kind words do not cost much. Yet they accomplish much.”\n\nBlaise pascal\n\n“Justice without force is powerless, force without justice is tyrannical.”\n\nBlaise pascal\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is the meaning of the name pascal?\n\nPascal derives from the Latin term paschalis which means related to easter.\n\nWhat was pascal’s IQ?\n\nPascal’s estimated IQ is 195.\n\nWhat is pascal’s wager argument?\n\nPascal’s wager argument is an argument is a philosophy.

In 1984 BBC made a documentary on pascal named the sea of faith.\n\nSee also\n\nBalise pascal is such a name in the field of maths and physics that needs no introduction. Just like him, France is the home to many great mathematicians like him. Like Fermat with which he worked. Like Simon la place, Marie Germain and Augustin Louis Cauchy all are French. Maybe we can say that France is a lucky country because it got such great mathematics personalities over the centuries."
