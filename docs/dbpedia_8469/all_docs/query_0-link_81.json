Along with the final chapter, entitled \"James's Voluntarism: Readiness, Willingness, or Will to Believe?\" they present sharpened treatments of three central axial contentions from the original essay. The importance of these contentions had not, it seemed to me, been sufficiently appreciated even by the friendliest of my critics. For I still contend, and expand on that contention here, without becoming unrelievedly deontological, that James's ethics does boast a deontological \"streak\" which saves his \"Will to Believe\" argument from succumbing to the fatal flaw of \"wishful thinking. \" The presence of that \"streak,\" I go on to contend, both requires and permits a more accurate interrelationship of those four distinct attitudes-right, readiness, willingness, and resolute \"will\" to believe-as they interweave with and lend each other material support in the course of James' s argument. In my closing essay here, finally, previously unpublished, I try to clarify the unique epistemological situation implied in the oddity that, if we understand all the foregoing constituents as James does (when he is thinking \"at top form\"), then our consent to the \"facts\" at issue here does not, paradoxically, receive support from the weltanschaulich belief proposition. The true state of affairs implies something closer to the opposite : it might turn out to be the legitimate function of a resolute \"willing faith\" to lend those facts their aura of believability and thereby cement the reciprocal relationships implied in the right, will, willingness , and readiness to believe.\n\nX\n\nPREFACE\n\nI am happy to express my thanks to The Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society for permission to reprint \"'The Will to Believe' and James's Deontological Streak,;, and to the International Philosophical Quarterly for permission to reprint \"Faith and Facts in James's 'Will to Believe.\"' I also wish to thank the Fordham University Press, and particularly Mr. Saverio Procario and Dr. Mary Beatrice Schulte, for their generous compliance with my request to unite these newer and older materials into this book.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nfor help on this study must go first to those who consented to read it, and who offered a number of valuable comments: to Professors W. Norris Clarke, s.J., and Robert J. Roth, s.J., of Fordham University, who read it in an earlier and briefer version; and to Professors Joseph Grassi of Fairfield University, John Lachs of Vanderbilt University, and John Smith of Yale University, who commented generously on the later and longer version that eventually became this book. My gratitude to them is only the keener in view of the forbearance some of them were constrained to show: I confess to a few seizures of obstinacy which led me to cling to certain views that some of my friendly critics found less congenial than I did. Wherever our differences remain, however, I hope they will credit me with having striven, at least, to ground my case on the evidence of William James's writings. I owe further debts of gratitude to the authorities of Fordham University who granted me the Faculty Fellowship year that resulted in this work; of Fairfield University, and particularly Rev. Christopher E. Mooney, s.J., Academic Vice President; and of Vanderbilt University, and particularly Dr. Jack Forstman, Dean of the Divinity School, for according me Visiting Scholar privileges and the warmest of hospitality during the time devoted to writing this book. Last, but far from least, my fond and admiring thanks (once again) to the world's premiere typist, Mrs. Karen Harris, and to that rare fusion of personal jucunditas and editorial severitas, Dr. Mary Beatrice Schulte.

And its appeal to young philosophical minds seems never to grow old. For nearly twenty years now, I have used it (along with others) as a text for introductory courses in philosophy, and never cease to marvel at its power. For James himself, when he gave it as a lecture, it represented an occasion to have his \"say about the deepest reasons of the universe,\" and to say that say with the fullest human resources at his command. Youthful minds, more haunted by those cosmic questions than we often give them credit for, and at the same time so responsive to the broad humanity, not merely the braininess, of thinkers who address them, delight in James as in a kindred spirit; they find it hard to believe he ever grew a gray hair. But professional philosophers of every stamp have equally succumbed to \"The Will to Believe.\" Once read, it does not admit of being easily left aside: it bothers the mind and heart somewhat as Plato's Symposium, Augustine's Confessions, and Pascal's Pensees do. Its provocative power has stimulated adverse criticisms, some of them fierce, as well as equally impassioned essays in defense; it will not let us rest. Philosophers naturally come at an essay of this sort with their own preoccupations, priorities, and methodological suppositions; it is a rare essay, though, that can respond to such a varied lot of thinkers by providing such chewy grist for each of their mills. IT IS SOMETIMES HARD TO REALIZE\n\n2\n\nWILLIAM JAMES\n\nMy own interest in \"The Will to Believe\" and its companion lectures was intensified by my having to deal with problems arising from St. Augustine's theory of art. How, for instance, do a thinker's artistic sensibility, and even artistic theory, enter into the personal way he, or she, shapes and addresses larger philosophic issues? And how legitimately do those artistic and aesthetic biases play a role in the activity of philosophizing? Relevant to Augustine, the same question intrudes upon our evaluations of Plato, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Dewey, and, of course, James-to stay with some outstanding instances. The entryway we take toward studying anyone's philosophy will always influence the conclusions we eventually draw; surely it is partially due to my peculiar entryway that I have come to the conviction that, with some critical honing, \"The Will to Believe\" still articulates some very substantial and important truths, both for young minds and for older ones. Some of the conclusions I come to here have already been suggested elsewhere; I have, I hope, not missed acknowledging any of the thinkers to whom I am indebted for those suggestions. That James's lecture applies to our \"over-beliefs\" has been said before, but I have tried to draw out some implications of that view which have not received the recognition they deserve. Chief among those implications is my claim that James is proposing that the \"passional\" side of our nature intervenes frqm the very first move we make toward settling on those weltanschaulich positions he calls \"over-beliefs,\" and not only from the moment when the intellect's survey of the \"evidence\" has reached an impasse. This might seem, at first, to convict James once for all of having commended \"wishful thinking,\" a charge so frequently repeated in the literature. My second major claim is that a number of defenses made of James against that \"wishful thinking\" charge are well-intentioned doubtless, but clearly off-target, since it is not James they end up defending. Can\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nhe be defended? My final claim is, yes-but only if we take seriously the deontological side of his moral thought, so often neglected, along with the epistemological corollary of that deontology: that only the thinker of developed moral character can be expected to \"see\" our universe in appropriate moral terms. Merely an echo of Aristotle's warnings about teaching philosophy to the young, or of Plato's claim that only one sensibilized to beauteous forms can glimpse the Forms? In short, is James dusting off a modern version of the old traditional stress on \"knowledge by connaturality\"? To some extent. But even if he were (unwittingly) doing no more than that, he does it as only James could: incomparably. One reason for the variety of criticisms and defenses of \"The Will to Believe\" is that critics and defenders are not always reading the same lecture, or reading it in the same way. They tend to highlight different moments of the argument, sometimes taking James's contentions out of context when they do so. Beyond that, there are elements in James's argument to which, I shall claim, almost none of them attributes the importance that they held for James himself. Before I can defend what I find defensible in his lecture, accordingly, I am bound in the first place to justify my own reading of it. Hence, my opening chapter: I trace James's argument, pointing up its crucial turnings, its sometimes subtle shifts in logic or meaning of terms, and calling the reader's attention to those features which, more generally ignored or slighted by previous writers, become important for the qualified defense I mean eventually to make of James. But how seriously did James himself take this lecture? View him as a psychologist on a metaphysical holiday, or take his occasional slips in expression and his general vivacity of spirit as indications of a cavalier or \"sporting\" attitude toward his topic, and you will read his lecture out\n\n4\n\nWILLIAM JAMES\n\nof an attitude and set of suppositions that may seriously affect not only your evaluation, but your very understanding of his argument. My second chapter, then, attempts to place this lecture in James's overall philosophical effort, in order to display how seriously he meant it, and how seriously we have a right to take it. One of the fiercest critics of James's contentions has gotten considerable mileage out of viewing his lecture through the lens provided by the famous Wager argument from Blaise Pascal's Pensees: the view John Hick takes of Pascal, and the attitude he assumes James had to Pascal's Wager, color his entire criticism. Hence, the need for a closer examination of James's relationship to Pascal; I undertake that in Chapter 3. But the central conclusion of Hick's criticism comes down to a recent version of the objection that has dogged James's proposals since they first saw the light of day: that he was providing mankind with neither more nor less than a reckless license for \"wishful thinking.\" Chapter 4 examines both the grounds that have been offered for that objection and the varied strategies that a number of James's defenders have adopted in answering it. Both critics and defenders, however, share a number of assumptions about how James's central thesis should be understood. They regularly suppose that the validity of his contentions can be tested by application to \"outcome\" cases; Chapter 5 examines that assumption, and strives to show that the thesis of \"The Will to Believe\" legitimately applies only to what James called over-beliefs, or propositions of weltanschaulich dimensions. Building on that conclusion, Chapter 6 advances what will strike many readers as the most outrageous contention in this study: that, contrary to what has been almost universally supposed, James did not mean to affirm that our passional nature should intervene in the formation of our over-beliefs only after our dispassionate intellects have\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nfailed to resolve the issues one way or the other. The surprising fact of the matter is that, early and late, James (like Pascal!) consistently taught that the passional or volitional side de facto exercises a precursive influence on all such intellectual surveys, and that it would be idly asking for the psychologically impossible to insist on the reverse scenario. James clearly held that the \"will\" to believe exerts its influence before, during, and after the formation of our over-beliefs, directing, influencing, and virtually commanding allsuch surveys, whether we admit it or no. This surprising thesis seems to throw us back into an even stronger version of \"wishful thinking.\" Are the beliefs we come to adopt simply the pre-ordained products of our individual temperaments? Or is there more to the passional side of our nature than wish, temperament, preference, and the like? Chapter 7 investigates what James has written about the various strata of the passional, and suggests ways in which his central thesis can be salvaged from the shipwreck of epistemological irresponsibility. Chapter 8 confirms and expands those findings by exploring the various metaphors James employed in his discussions of belief. An Epilogue briefly indicates why James's positions, if understood as I have interpreted them, remain valid reformulations of a long-standing and quite honorable view of what philosophical thinking is truly about-reformulations which, I submit, signpost some escape routes out of the impasse in which the philosophical profession, and the business of philosophical education, find themselves mired at present.\n\n1\n\nThe Argument of\n\n\"The Will to Belie,re\" \"THE WILL TO BELIEVE\" is one of a series of \"popular\" lectures in philosophy to which James devoted much of his time between the years 1880 and 1896. At the height of his fame, and in need of supplemental income for the education of his children, he was also much sought-after as a lecturer. His audience in this case was the membership of the Philosophy Clubs of Yale and Brown universities, in the year 1896. Beginning on a light note, he portrays himself as about to deliver \"something like a sermon\" on \"justification,\" not \"by,\" but \"of,\" faith (WB 1); at least it will assure them that such matters are still spoken about in their sister-university Harvard! James then states his aim more precisely: he hopes to present \"a defence of our right to adopt a believing attitude in religious matters, in spite of the fact that our merely logical intellect may not have been coerced. 'The Will to Believe,' accordingly, is the title of my paper\" (WB 1-2). In the months and years to follow, James will have second thoughts on that nonchalant \"accordingly\": the \"right\" to believe may be one thing, but the \"will\" to believe quite a different matter. 1 His main contention, however, is stated further on in greater detail: Our passional nature2 not only lawfully may, but must, decide an option between propositions, whenever it is a genuine option that cannot by its nature be decided on intellectual\n\n8\n\nWILLIAM JAMES\n\ngrounds; for to say, under such circumstances, \"Do not decide, but leave the question open,\" is itself a passional decision,just like deciding yes or no,-and is attended with the same risk of losing the truth [WB 11].\n\nThat statement of his \"thesis\" supposes several semitechnical distinctions he has begun with. An option, for James, involves a \"decision between two hypotheses,\" but a \"genuine\" option must possess three characteristics: it must be \"forced,\" \"living,\" and \"momentous.\" A \"living option,\" the first kind James explains, is one in which both competing hypotheses are \"live\" ones; that is, they both exert an \"appeal\" as real possibilities to the mind of the person weighing them (WB 2). He assumes, in illustrating this property, that the advice to become a Mohammedan, a theosophist, or a believer in the Mahdi would exert no such appeal to the students of Yale and Brown, so that the question of deciding for one rather than the other would be a \"dead\" option-if not for an Arab or African-at least for them.3 Not so, however, the option between Christianity and agnosticism, for in this case, \"trained as you are, each hypothesis makes some appeal, however small, to your belief\" (WB 3). But a genuine option must also be \"momentous\" rather than \"trivial.\" An invitation to reach for the kind of immortality involved in joining Nansen's North Pole expedition, for example, would represent a \"momentous\" option, a unique opportunity, in which the stakes are significant and the decision irreversible. \"He who refuses to embrace a unique opportunity loses the prize as surely as if he tried and failed\" (WB 4). 4 The third characteristic of a genuine option is that it be \"forced\": the two possibilities presented form a \"complete logical disjunction\"-\" 'Either accept this truth or go without it' \"-with \"no standing place outside of the alternative,\" and \"no possibility of not choosing\" (WB 3; emphasis added for clarity) between them.\n\nTHE ARGUMENT\n\n9\n\nIt would seem, at the outset, that the option James is about to discuss-\"Either believe in God, or do not believe\"-.has already been ruled out as a \"genuine\" option: for a third possibility, that of remaining essentially indifferent to the question, and acquiescing in an agnosticism which is neither belief nor disbelief, seems to offer a \"standing ground\" outside of these two contending possibilities. It will be part of James's task further on to argue that this third possibility is, in the last analysis, illusory; but we shall come to that in time. One would expect as James's next move that he explain that crucial term in his \"thesis\": our \"passional\" or \"volitional nature.\" Instead, he rather too easily supposes his auditors' familiarity with what he means, and passes on to illustrate that meaning. There are, he admits, cases where it seems \"preposterous\" to talk of \"our opinions being modifiable at will\" (WB 4) : we cannot, however strongly we will it, deny the existence of Abraham Lincoln or the reality of a rheumatic attack: such Humean \"matters of fact ... and relations between ideas\" are \"either there or not there for us\" and \"if not there cannot be put there by any action of our own\" (WB 5). Any talk of our believing in such propositions because we will to believe in them is nothing less than \"silly\" (WB 7). As another provisional objection to his own thesis, James reminds his hearers of Pascal's famous Wager argument. Grossly put: bet on God's existence and, if He does exist, you win eternal happiness; if He does not exist, life being so short, what have you lost? James proceeds to summarize the Wager in his own fashion. That summary I shall have to deal with further on; what is interesting at this point is James's dismissal of the Wager. For dismiss it he does, and on two distinct grounds. 5 First, \"when religious faith expresses itself thus, in the language of the gamingtable,\" one is entitled to feel it has been \"put to its last trumps\"; a faith adopted \"after such a mechanical calcu-\n\n10\n\nWILLIAM JAMES\n\n·lation would lack the inner soul of faith's reality\"-and we, in the Deity's place, would \"probably take particular pleasure in cutting off believers of this pattern from their infinite reward\" (WB 6). Betting on God's existence by calculating the gains and losses respectively entailed by belief and unbelief, James is clearly suggesting, is an entirely unworthy approach to religious faith. 6 The second flaw in Pascal'~ argument, as James views it, and assumes his auditors all view it as he does, is that f~tith \"in masses and holy water\" represents a \"dead\" option, a set of \"foregone impossibilities\" to \"us Protestants.\" So, says James in a remarkable parallel, would an invitation tendered by the Mahdi to wager on him as the guarantee of our eternal happiness! The Mahdi's logic would be the same as Pascal's, James observes, but the \"hypothesis he offers us is dead,\" as dead as the one offered by Pascal. May one seriously talk, then, of \"believing by our volition\"? Catering still to his auditors' suspicion of all such talk, James permits himself a rhetorical flight evoking the \"magnificent edifice of the physical sciences,\" the construction of so many \"disinterested moral lives\" over the centuries: how utterly \"besotted and contemptible\" seems any sentimentalist who would ignore such scientific findings and \"decide things from out of his private dream.\" One can understand why scientific thinkers, bred in this \"rugged and manly school\" should feel like \"spewing such subjectivism out of their mouths\" (WB 7). One can understand, as well, why some such thinkers, in their antipathy to subjectivism and sentimentalism, \"pass over to the opposite extreme entirely\"; Clough, Huxley, and W. K. Clifford-James's principal adversary7-close ranks in preaching the immorality, desecration, and downright sinfulness involved in anyone's believing anything \" 'on insufficient evidence,' \" no matter how strongly that belief might work toward the \" 'solace and private pleasure of the believer'\" (WB 8). The scientific conscience, then, would\n\nTHE ARGUMENT\n\n11\n\nseem to anathematize the very possibility James is about to argue for: that \"wish and will and sentimental preference\" -factors of our passional or volitional nature-may rightly intervene in the formation of beliefs of any sort whatever. But, interposes James, however healthy Clifford's ethics of belief may sound, he is flying in the face of facts; for it is a fact that we believe a host of things-from molecular theory to Protestant Christianity-not from any personal insight into evidence, but swayed by the authority and prestige those beliefs have acquired in our particular \"intellectual climate\" (WB 9) .8 And it is another fact that even the Cliffords of the scientific world disbelieve a whole array of facts and theories on the passional, rather than \"logical,\" grounds that they have no \"use\" for those facts and theories; indeed, Clifford's very \"law\" that we should rule out our \"willing nature\" in the formation of our beliefs is itself based on his \"wish\" to exclude all views and theories for which he, in his professional capacity, can find no use! The factual state of things, therefore, is far less simple than Clifford would allow: it is true, even for him, that our \"non-intellectual nature does influence our convictions .... and pure insight and logic, whatever they might do ideally, are not the only things that really do produce our creeds\" (WB 11). But all this serves only to sharpen the question: Is this intervention of our volitional nature \"reprehensible and pathological,\" or, on the contrary, a \"normal element in making up our minds\"? We have already seen James's programatic answer to that question, in the \"thesis\" transcribed above; now, too, we are in a better position to appreciate how circumscribed an answer it purports to be. This much, at least, is indisputably clear. James is not claiming that the intervention of our passional nature is legitimate in any and every option we may be faced with. His claim is the much more limited one that volitional intervention is legitimate where the option in question is\n\n12\n\nWILLIAM JAMES\n\n\"genuine\"-is living, forced, and momentous. Three necessary conditions, but are they su:fficent conditions as well? James's expression is tantalizing: \"whenever it is a genuine option that cannot by its nature be decided on intellectual grounds.\"Theitalics are James's own; obviously, the qualification was important to him. And yet nothing in the discussion so far has gone to clarify exactly what he intends by it. But we shall come to see that such clarity is indispensable if we are to gauge the value of his argument. . Having stated his thesis, James sees the need of clearing up two more \"preliminary\" points before endeavoring to argue it. The first has to do with the human tendency to be \"absolutist\" and \"dogmatic\" in epistemological matters: to claim that our feeling of certainty is validated by our possessing the \"objective evidence\" that grounds our certainty. And yet, how many positions down the history of philosophy have made that claim, against adversaries who made the identical claim for their perfectly antithetical views! The only solution to this impasse, James proposes, is to abandon the \"absolutist\" mentality once for all, to admit, like a true empiricist, that each of our views is reinterpretable and corrigible. Giving up the absolutist doctrine of \"objective certitude,\" however, is not the same as giving up \"the quest or hope of truth itself\" (WB 17) ; it means that the empiricist, as James ideally sees him, commits himself to the task of \"systematically continuing to roll up experiences and think,\" and in that thinking, to face future-ward rather than toward the past, toward the \"outcome, the upshot,\" the terminus ad quem rather than the origin and terminus a quo of his thinking. Of any of his hypotheses, the Jamesian empiricist must ask, not how it came to him, but whether \"the total drift of thinking continues to confirm it.\" The second \"preliminary\": there are two ways, James asserts, of formulating our epistemological rule of conduct. We may say \"We must know the truth\" ; or we may say\n\nTHE ARGUMENT\n\n13\n\n\"we must avoid error.\" Often jumbled together as though they were two ways of stating the same epistemological commandment, these are, in fact, \"two separable laws.\" Clifford, for example, when legislating against belief without sufficient evidence, has made the avoidance of error his primary concern; but in doing so, he is merely expressing his fear-his passional fear-of being duped; that fear he has allowed to dominate his desire for attaining truth, making that desire a secondary concern. But what if one chooses-and that choice is a choice, dictated as much by the passional as Clifford's choice in the opposing direction -what if one chooses to make the \"chase for truth\" (WB 18) a paramount, and the avoidance of error a secondary, concern? To an empiricist philosopher, Clifford sounds too much like a general nervously exhorting his troops to keep clear of the battle rather than risk a single wound. Obviously, James is confident that his audience by this time will concede him the right to make the search for truth his paramount concern, with the understanding that his preference for that epistemological canon is at least as legitimate as Clifford's choice of the opposing one. And that concession frees him, at last, to go straight to the main question of his lecture. He first refreshes his hearers on the limited application of his main thesis. The \"attitude of sceptical balance\" and its concomitant decision to wait for further evidence are often the appropriate one-in scientific matters, for example; but the judgments we are called upon to make about such disputed questions as Roentgen's theory or the causality of conscious states are seldom if ever either forced or momentous. 9 They are not, therefore, the kind of genuine option to which James's thesis applies. But are there not, among our speculative questions, examples of \"forced options\" which do not permit us to \"wait with impunity till the coercive evidence shall have arrived\" (WB 22) ?10 James proposes two areas where such options confront\n\n14\n\nWILLIAM JAMES\n\nus; the first of them is the realm of moral beliefs: here we must consult, not science, but what Pascal calls the \"heart,\" for it is a question, not of what sensibly exists, but of what is \"good,\" what solicits our \"moral preferences\"-what appeals to the will. \"If your heart does not want a world of moral reality, your head will assuredly never make you believe in one,\" and when we choose to \"stick to it\" that there is such a thing as moral truth, \"we do so with our whole nature,\" not merely with our pure intellects (WB ~3).\n\nBut there is a second realm where the same thing applies: this realm is concerned with \"facts,\" but those peculiar facts involved in \"personal relations, states of mind between one man and another.\" Whether another person likes me or not will most often depend on \"whether I meet you half-way, am willing to assume that you must like me, and show you trust and expectation.\" That \"previous faith\" on my part is what so often \"makes your liking come\" (WB 23-24). But if I stand aloof and wait for \"objective evidence\" that you do like me, then \"ten to one your liking never comes\" (WB 24). At this juncture, James's argument has taken a subtle shift: instead of staying with the question whether, as a matter of fact, \"you like me or not,\" he has veered round to recommending the show of \"trust and expectation,\" a \"previous faith\" that you will come to like me, as the most effective way of making that liking \"come.\" Continuing on that same tack, he observes that the \"desire for a certain kind of truth here brings about that special truth's existence,\" not only in friendships, but in the quest for \"promotions, boons, appointments,\" in \"innumerable cases of other sorts.\" The faith of the ambitious and confident young executive, for instance, \"acts on the powers above him like a daim, and creates its own verification.\" The same rule holds, James continues, for any social\n\nTHE ARGUMENT\n\n15\n\norganism. A team, college, government, or army all depend on each member's doing his job with the \"precursive faith\" that the others will do their job as well; without this, \"not only is nothing achieved, but nothing is even attempted.\" A whole train of passengers (individually brave enough) will be looted by a few highwaymen, simply because the latter can count on one another, while each passenger fears that if he makes a movement of resistance, he will be shot before any one else backs him up. If we believed that the whole car-full would rise at once with us, we should each severally rise, and trainrobbing would never even be attempted [WB 24-25].\n\nThere are, then, cases \"where a fact cannot come at all unless a preliminary faith exists in its coming\" (WB 25). So, James concludes emphatically, \"where faith in a fact can help create the fact, that would be an insane logic which should say that faith running ahead of scientific evidence is the 'lowest kind of immorality.' ... Yet such is the logic by which our scientific absolutists pretend to regulate our lives!\" 11 Now James passes on from \"human cases\" to the more cosmic question represented by the \"religious hypothesis.\" Since religions \"differ so much in their accidents,\" James feels obliged to express the religious hypothesis in \"very generic and broad\" terms. \"Religion\" says, first, that \"the best things are the more eternal things,\" that\" 'Perfection is eternal' \";and, secondly, that \"we are better off even now if we believe her first affirmation to be true\" (WB 26). James supposes his auditors will grant it as a \"living\" hypothesis, at least, that both these affirmations may be true. But then, it is evident that religion offers itself as a \"momentous\" option as well: belief and unbelief will issue, respectively, in gain and loss of a \"certain vital good.'' That \"vital good\" is left unexplained in this essay; but since James is about to revert to the idiom of the \"gaming-\n\n16\n\nWILLIAM JAMES\n\ntable,\" it is worth observing that the terms of his wager are quite different from Pascal's. James says nothing about the \"eternal\" happiness to be won; he does not exclude it, surely, but the \"vital good\" he is invoking seems clearly a good to be gained \"even now,\" in this human life before death and whatever may follow on death. 12 How much that undefined, unexplained \"vital good\" must have appealed to the students of Brown and Yale is anyone's guess, of course; its vacuity as it stands, though, must have been underlined by the lofty generality of James's definition of \"religion.\" True, he felt that a \"generic and broad\" characterization was forced upon him by the needs of his argument; but one cannot help hearing Pascal himself, whispering behind the scenes about that antiseptic, bloodless being, the \"God of the philosophers.\" A \"momentous\" hypothesis, really? But a lecture is a lecture, and one has only a certain amount of time. We must not fault him overmuch if, with other fish to fry, James hurtles onward. For he sees his thorniest task as that of showing that the religious option is truly \"forced.\" After all, \"belief\" and \"unbelief\" do not seem to represent two terms of a perfect logical disjunction; between them would appear to lie that middle \"standing-ground,\" \"non-belief\": the uncommitted position of \"remaining sceptical and waiting for more light,\" until \"'sufficient evidence' for religion be found\" (WB 27). But that appearance, James argues, is illusory: take a man who hesitates to marry, unsure whether his wifeto-be will turn out to be an angel when he brings her home; when it comes to gaining or losing that particular \"angelpossibility,\" is there any real difference between his hesitating indefinitely and never marrying at all', or deciding to marry someone else instead of that possible angel? No, argues James; he \"cut[s] himself off from that particular angel-possibility\" (WB 26) as decisively in one case as in the other. The indefinite postponement of decision is, to be\n\nTHE ARGUMENT\n\n17\n\nsure, a way of \"avoiding error,\" on the supposition that the religious hypothesis is untrue; but if it is true, \"we lose the good\" it puts before us \"just as certainly as if we positively chose to disbelieve.\" The skeptical choice of waiting for conclusive evidence, then, is itself a kind of positive option, as much fraught with risk as the options to believe or disbelieve: the skeptic is \"actively playing his stake as much as the believer is; he is backing the field against the religious hypothesis, just as the believer is backing the religious hypothesis against the field.\" The Pascalian Wager language may not be that \"silly,\" when all is said: in any event, James's ambiguity toward Pascal's maneuver has become more baffiing than ever. But now he probes more searchingly into the motivation of the skeptic: instead of the cool-headed, passionless abstention skepticism would claim to be, in reality it would strive to _ persuade us that, when it comes to the religious hypothesis, \"to yield to our fear of its being error is wiser and better than to yield to our hope that it may be true\" (WB 27). The skeptic is not preaching \"intellect against passions,\" then; he is preaching \"fear\" against \"hope\"-\"intellect with one passion laying down its law.\" But what entitles \"fear\" to the palm of \"supreme wisdom\" in these matters? \"Dupery for dupery, what proof is there that dupery through hope is so much worse than dupery through fear?'' The \"scientist,\" then, is not dissuading me from choosing an option; he is trying to persuade me to choose \"his kind of option.\" In a situation where \"my own stake is important enough to give me the right to choose my own form of risk,\" he is commanding me to \"forfeit my sole chance in life of getting on the winning side.\" But all this supposes, of course, that I am willing \"to run the risk of acting as if my passional need of taking the world religiously might be prophetic and right,\" and, what is more, that it may, indeed, be \"prophetic and right,\" in such wise that religion be a \"live hypothesis which may be true.\"\n\n18\n\nWILLIAM JAMES\n\nIs it far-fetched to think that James is betraying, here, an uneasiness about his preceding definition of \"religion\"a definition so \"generic and broad\" as to drain it of all the jukes that should flow through a truly \"momentous\" hypothesis? However that may be, he does evoke for his hearers the \"further way\" in which religion \"comes to most\" of them. One might object that James is about to present not merely a \"further,\" but a more particular, even an accidental, form of the religious hypothesis he first felt it necessary to keep \"generic and broad\"; but that might be caviling. The \"perfect and ... eternal\" in the universe, he now admits, is \"represented in our religions as having personal form,\" so that if we are religious, the universe becomes \"no longer a mere It to us, but a Thou.\" This puts James in position to exploit his foregoing observations on \"person to person\" relationships. He recasts them in a fresh illustration: just as a man who in a company of gentlemen made no advances, asked a warrant for every concession, and believed no one's word without proof, would cut himself off by such churlishness from all the social rewards that a more trusting spirit would earn,-so here, one who should shut himself up in snarling logicality and try to make the gods extort his recognition willy-nilly, or not get it at all, might cut himself off forever from his only opportunity of making the gods' acquaintance [WB 28].\n\nSo, James is arguing, if we entertain the notion that the \"perfect and ... eternal\" is personal, thus making the universe a \"Thou,\" it should come as no surprise that \"We feel ... as if the appeal of religion to us were made to our own active good-will, as if evidence might be forever withheld from us unless we met the hypothesis half-way\": very much the way, in his earlier illustration from the interpersonal sphere, James argued for the \"half-way\" meeting between two who would be friends.\n\nTHE ARGUMENT\n\n19\n\nNow, however, he takes another step; the unbroken sweep of his prose would imply that it follows easily from what has gone before, if not for our minds, then at least for his: · This feeling, forced on us we know not whence, that by obstinately believing that there are gods . . . we are doing the universe the deepest service we can, seems part of the living essence of the religious hypothesis. If the hypothesis were true in all its parts, including this one, then pure intellectualism, with its veto on our making willing advances, would be an absurdity; and some participation of our sympathetic nature would be logically required.\n\nThe \"logic\" appealed to here is the logic of interpersonal relationships; so much for the continuity presiding over James's argument in this paragraph. But a new, even a solemn, note has been injected; it is no longer merely a matter of gaining the rewards of friendship. The essence of the \"religious\" hypothesis has for one incandescent moment been acknowledged in different terms: in terms of \"doing the universe the deepest service we can.\" This said, James feels, he has made it clear why he cannot accept such \"agnostic rules\" as Clifford and others would impose, rules that would \"keep [our] willing nature out of the game.\" His final formulation runs: \"I cannot do so for this plain reason, that a rule of thinking which would absolutely prevent me from acknowledging certain kinds of truth if those kinds of truth were really there, would be an irrational rule. That for me is the long and short of the formal logic of the situation ... [WB 28-29].\" James closes in a frankly hortatory vein, by quoting from Fitzjames Stephen. We all must deal with the\" 'riddles of the Sphinx' \" encased in such questions as \" 'What do you think of yourself?' \" and \" 'What do you think of the world?' \" and \" 'choice' \" is involved in whatever way we deal with them. \" 'In all important transactions of life,' \" Stephen points out, .\n\n20\n\nWILLIAM JAMES\n\n\"we have to take a leap in the dark.... We stand on a mountain pass in the midst of whirling snow and blinding mist, through which we get glimpses now and then of paths which may be deceptive. If we stand still we shall be frozen to death. If we take the wrong road we shall be dashed to pieces. We do not certainly know whether there is any right one. What must we do? 'Be strong and of a good courage.' Act for the best, hope for the best, and take what comes .... If death ends all, we cannot meet death better\" [WB 30-31].\n\nThese are James's final injunctions. He was fond of this . metaphor of the Alpinist's quandary;13 it regularly evoked, for him, the notion of \"courage,\" the courage he thought of as energizing the \"will\" to take the leap of faith. The force of these closing remarks we shall explore more carefully as this evaluation of his lecture comes, in its own turn, to a close. NOTES\n\n1. In fact, ensuing discussion of his lecture will crystallize into a scholarly consensus which James seems to have anticipated, and sympathetically: that he argued successfully for a right, but not for a will, to believe. See the evidence and argument presented by Gail Kennedy in \"Pragmatism, Pragmaticism, and the Will to BelieveA Reconsideration,\" The Journal of Philosophy, 55, No. 14 (July 3, 1958), 578-88. For my own refinements on this proposal, see below, chap. 6. 2. By our \"passional nature\" James refers to that part, side, or (in the terms applied in RA, passim) \"willing department\" of our total human nature which interacts with our \"perceiving\" and \"conceiving\" departments. See WB 29\"--30 where \"heart, instincts, and courage,\" \"senses,\" and \"intellect\" clearly designate those same three departments, though in different terms. Patrick K. Dooley, in \"The Nature of Belief: The Proper Context for James' 'The Will to Believe,'\" Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society, 8, No. 3 (Summer 1972), 141-51, ably argues for the appropriateness of interpreting this lecture in the light of James's other writings. James's consistency on this issue may be viewed as partial confirmation of Dooley's suggestion, but we shall see more confirmation in what follows.\n\nTHE ARGUMENT\n\n21\n\nTo avoid tedious repetition, I shall sometimes refer to our \"passional nature\" as our \"passional\" side or simply as the \"passional,\" without any change of meaning~ 3. James is aware, therefore; that he is referring, not to some \"intrinsic property\" that makes any particular hypothesis \"live,\" but to the relationship of any such hypothesis to the \"mind\" of an \"individual thinker,\" a relationship that makes it plausible to that thinker's mind. For the relevance of these remarks, see the treatment of John Hick's objection in chap. 4, below. 4. E contra, James goes on to suggest somewhat disconcertingly that an hypothesis which a \"chemist finds live enough to spend a year in its verification\" would rank as a \"trivial\" hypothesis of the sort that \"abound in the scientific life [WB 4]\"1 Rather than taken as a put-down of science, this should shock the reader into seeing what James means by an hypothesis that is truly \"momentous.\" 5. Observe that later on, having re-established the rights of the volitional to enter into the believing process, James alludes in passing to the possibility that Pascal's Wager argument may be a \"regular\" clincher,\" after all [WB 11]. Merely a rhetorical flourish, that admission? Or a sign that James's attitude toward the Wager argument, and possibly toward Pascal more generally, was an ambivalent one? See my discussion of this question below, chap. 3. 6. Analyze the tightly woven summary of his argument presented on WB 7, and it is possible that James means the adjective \"vile\" to characterize Pascal's Wager argument; but the characterization holds only if Pascal is interpreted (or caricatured) as James, at this precise stage in the development of his own case, and for the purposes of developing that case, makes free to interpret him. Did James mean this interpretation to stand as his last word on the Wager and on Pascal? See above, note 5, and below, chap. 3. 7. James groups Arthur Hugh Clough and Thomas Huxley with, but aims his fire mainly at, W. K. Clifford, who had written in his \"The Ethics of Belief\" the series of propositions James quotes from him. This was a chapter in his Lectures and Essays, edd. Leslie Stephen and Frederick Pollock, 2 vols. (London: Macmillan, 1879) ; see pp. 182-86. I elide (as not directly relevant to this stage of the argument) what James more precisely means by the \"opposite extreme\" these men prided themselves on embracing: the pessimistic view that the \"incorruptibly truthful intellect ought positively to prefer\" that the cosmos be a dark and disconsolate place, as though the \"bitterness and unacceptableness to the heart\" implied by that view must somehow be taken as positive guarantee of its truth. He\n\n22\n\nWILLIAM JAMES\n\nquotes (perhaps maliciously) Clough's jingle that: \"'It fortifies my heart to know I That, though I perish, Truth is so-' \" (WB 7). More recently, of course, the fashi-o n calls for Albert Camus' comparably pathetic \"We have to imagine Sisyphus-happy.\" 8. James here alludes (WB 9) to a number of \"volitional\" factors -belief, fear, hope, pressure, partisanship, etc.-that go to make up the intellectual climate of any time and place, but he makes no attempt to be more than illustrative when doing so. Nor does he confront the need for discriminating among their obviously uneven claims to \"legitimacy\"; he is, after all, merely setting up the question he means to deal with focally. But one could have hoped that, in another lecture perhaps, he might have dealt more attentively with the nest of problems raised by his enumeration; see below, chap. 7. 9. Nor, James points out, are the hypotheses involved in such scientific \"options\" truly \"living\" ones for us as \"spectators\" of the scientific game, though they may be living options for the passionately commited scientific researcher. There is an anticipation here of Thomas S. Kuhn's later distinction between the creative and the more \"routine\" kind of scientist; see WB 20-21 and Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1962; rev. ed., 1970), esp. pp. 52-65. 10. The meaning of \"forced\" seems to have gone through a shift in James's mind: it is no longer merely a question of the disjunction's leaving no (logical) \"middle ground\"; now the (more existential) consideration has entered whereby the choice must be made now, without postponement. That exclusion of postponement was, however, formerly a feature of the option viewed as \"momentous,\" so that James has not surreptitiously imported a consideration not included in his original premisses. 11. The quotation is actually from Thomas Huxley, but taken as associated with Clifford's contention in the same sense; see above, note 7. 12. Despite his sympathetic views on the possibilities for \"human immortality,\" James does not make those views operative as premisses in WB. The point has bearing on whether he is encouraging us to engage in \"wishful thinking\"; see below, chap. 4. 13. Compare WB 30-31, SR 96, and LWL 59. The metaphor seems clearly to have resonated with his personal experience of, and predilection for, the challenges of mountaineering. See TC 1 and II passim, esp. 1 377-78. Again, Dooley's prescription (see note 2, above) proves a sound one.\n\n2\n\nOn Matter and Manner IT TAKES a certain shamelessness to present the kind of content analysis of James I have given above, however necessary it may be. I have tried to highlight those features of his lecture which have become the focus of subsequent discussion about its cogency, or lack of it. But in doing so, what a sense of embarrassment, almost of desecration. For all the hearty flavor, the genial electricity, of James's contagious style is drained away in the process. Not everyone would deplore such a reduction of this full-blooded address to the dry bones of its matter and argumentative sequence, but a Jamesian \"believer\" must. For central to all James's philosophical activity is the conviction, which features so prominently in this lecture, that the whole person must be engaged in philosophic exploration, not merely the pure intellect or logicizing reason. Cor ad cor loquitur, Newman never tired of reminding us: if \"real\" rather than merely \"notional\" assents are his concern, the thinker must be willing to present himself in all the fullness of his humanity, feeling and sensitivity included-and, one must add, human vulnerability as .well. In that self-presentation, style is no mere ornament; style is the man. But it mustbe admitted that James's style has worked both for and against him, and never more tellingly than in \"The Will to Believe.\" Nowhere more vividly do we catch that mobile, darting, adventurous quality of his mind, his artist's responsiveness to the folds and curves, the rockribbed massiveness, the darks and glints, of reality which elude the everyday eye. Not only do his early experiment with the painter's vocation, 1 and his wide and responsive\n\n24\n\nWILLIAM JAMES\n\nreading in literature and poetry of every stripe,2 represent a backlog of \"mental equipment,\" a stock of lively illustrations, but both interests are profoundly symptomatic of the kind of thinker he was fated to become. Even in his more technical Principles of Psychology, we know we have met the man himself; but in his popular lectures, this \"Hibernian\"3 propensity, this sheer reveling in \"good talk,\" sprightly and humorous, serious and solemn by turns, is fully unleashed. Even at those junctures when we simply must cry halt, and slow his ebullient progress with a question, an objection, a demand for more precision, a smaller voice within us murmurs its \"almost thou persuadest me....\" But there are such junctures; precision, logic, cogency are not solely matter for impatience or scorn. And it must be admitted that the nether side of James's style asserts itself exactly here: his early mockery of the \"laboratory\" psychologists disclosed his own lifelong impatience with the plodding unromantic toil of getting it precisely right; and the way he virtually blazoned a superficial conversance with logic and mathematics betrayed that streak in him which, Perry tells us, was \"profoundly opposed to the whole life of scholarship,\" amounting even to a \"temperamental repugnance to the processes of exact thought.''4 This congenital weakness in James's otherwise impressive philosophical armory may serve as some excuse for the arid summary I have presented of \"The Will to Believe\"; but it should not excuse anyone from direct acquaintance with the lecture itself. While tracing its argumentative line as faithfully as I could, I have also attempted to point, even if allusively at times, to the slips and gaps that have fueled the discussion of later scholars, both critics and advocates of James. Before moving on to that scholarly discussion, though, one major caveat is called for. James can be headlong and charming, impatient with technicities; and his thought comes attired in a style\n\nMATTER AND MANNER\n\n25\n\nof matching cut. But it would be fatal to conclude that he was not \"serious\" about the issues he was airing, here and in the other popular lectures of this period of his career. Debonair always, he was continents removed from being cavalier. 5 The point has its importance, and the weight one feels entitled to assign to this phase of James's activity depends upon getting it clear. For one eminent critic has come dangerously close to questioning that seriousness. John Hick prefaces his treatment of·\"The Will to Believe\"6 with a \"pilot study\" of Pascal's \"Wager\"; that very association, which James himself may be thought to have invited, along with Hick's own evaluation of PascaV may have influenced his judgment. But in any case, Hick's analysis leads him to the conclusion that James entertained an \"essentially sporting\" attitude toward religious belief. 8 James does, it is true, revert to the language of the gaming table toward the end of his lecture-and that despite his earlier dismissal of such thinking as unworthy and perhaps even \"vile\"; Hick is also correct in pointing to James's allusive appeal to similar expressions in \"The Sentiment of Rationality.\"9 But place those expressions once more into their larger context, take account of the adversaries James is dealing with, then grant him the right to his personal lecturing style, and surely a more generous interpretation than Hick's suggests itself. Life itself involves risk, and the human person's total commitment in religious faith is surely one of life's largest risks: the betting metaphor, even if Pascal's classic argument had never given it general circulation, would come naturally to mind to express that risk. But a metaphor it remains, and James's remarks on Pascal's use of it show his lucid awareness of its limping inadequacy. Speak in sporting metaphors of life, and of religious faith, and only the most literal-minded would infer that you take the game of life as just another game. But there are risks and risks, and James's adversaries\n\n26\n\nWILLIAM JAMES\n\nwould have it that the risk of falling into error is so \"solemn and awful\" a thing that no thinking being should be willing to court it. Now the word risk has taken a somber turn; the gaming-table sort of risk has become only its pale image. It is James's task to show not only that the risk of faith commends itself, but that his adversaries, instead of offering us a life without risk, would have us risk all the meaning of our human lives through a timorous submission to a one-sided epistemological rule, a rule that would dissuade us from \"doing the [personal] universe the deepest service\" we may be called upon to offer. We are worlds away from the gaming table now, and if \"sport\" is involved, it is deadly serious sport. But that last phrase quoted from James's \"Will to Believe\" suggests an aspect of the faith-commitment which Hick, like so many others, has totally ignored. He has been perspicacious enough to see that an interpretation of this lecture may set off a hunt through its companion lectures from this period of James's production; but \"The Sentiment of Rationality\" is only one of a number. What light do the others shed on James's attitude toward faith? Hunting down an answer to that question will occupy us further on. To set the stage for a fuller answer to Hick's objection, as well as to light up other facets of \"The Will to Believe,\" a word on this phase of James's philosophical effort is in order. \"[R]eligion,\" James remarks in a letter of 18 97, \"is the great interest of my life ... \" (Letters II 58). That interest went back to a significant degree to the influence of his father, Henry James, Sr., whose energetic career as writer, lecturer, and marathon conversationalist was fiercely dedicated to religious questions. 10 James's touching devotion to his father went along with an unfeigned admiration for the man, even if it never brought him into complete agreement with his views. But that paternal influence was as incalculable as it was inescapable; soon after his father's death,\n\nMATTER AND MANNER\n\n27\n\nsumming up what would \"stay by [him]\" of all his father bequeathed, James included \"the sense of his right to have a say about the deepest reasons of the universe\" (Letters I 221). Specialize though he did in physiology, then psychology, as early as 1865-when 23 years of age-James pledged himself \" 'to study philosophy all [his] days,' \" and remarked, eight years later, that his \" 'interest [would], as ever, lie with the most general problems'\" (see Letters I 53, 171). Perry writes of him that \"From his adolescence James was both fascinated and tormented by ultimate problems .... he was haunted by a cosmic nostalgia-by those deeper doubts and hopes which are the perpetual spring of religion. He felt these emotions both in his own behalf and vicariously in behalf of every sincerely troubled human soul. \" 11 As late as 1907, James expresses his delight that his friend Carl Stumpf is \" 'working more and more into metaphysics, which is the only study worthy of Man!' m 2 It was, in fact, this exalted notion of philosophy that almost kept him from being a philosopher at all: his \" 'strongest moral and intellectual craving,' \" he writes to his brother Henry, \"'is for some stable reality to lean upon,' \" whereas the professional philosopher's business seems to pledge him \" 'publicly never to have done with doubt on these subjects, but every day to be ready to criticize afresh and call in question the grounds of his faith of the day before.... ' \" 13 This once seemed too lacerating a calling for one who for so many of his younger years had \"brooded upon the nature of the universe and the destiny of man,\" and for whom these questions were \"vital\" questions.14 That gnawing preoccupation with the deepest and most cosmic of questions, Perry suggests, may have contributed in part to the neurasthenic depression, and near-collapse, that brought James so low between his twenty-sixth and twenty-eighth years. 15 It is significant that James himself attributed his \"rebirth,\" in large part, to the\n\n28\n\nWILLIAM JAMES\n\nbracing assurance he gleaned from reading Renouvier's Deuxieme Essai: man's will is perhaps genuinely free, after all, and not the inconsequential plaything of a universe whose physical laws determine its every act. 16 Many of the seeds of James's popular lecture on \"The Dilemma of Determinism\" are already detectable in this earlier experience;17 but, one may ask, why was precisely this conviction so vitally important to him? The reason lies in one of the differences James always had with his father's views: his father, he was persuaded, too easily resorted to a higher, aesthetic resolution of the problem of evil, a resolution that, in James's view, sapped at its very root the efficacy, importance, and deepest seriousness of human moral activity. 18 In later years, this would be his objection to, and the driving motive of his unrelenting assault on, all forms of \"Hegelism\" as he understood it. 19 His early adoption of the \"empiricist\" attitude went along with the hope that scientific \"fact\" could be reconciled with the validity of religion. 20 Life, he was convinced-and paradoxically, his reading of his father's friend Carlyle made strongly for that conviction-is a \"real fight,\" against real evils, and humankind's resolute will to engage in the fight makes a real difference to the ultimate outcome. 21 The pages of James's popu1ar lectures are sprinkled with references to and quotations from Thomas Carlyle, all breathing the same spirit of fighting ardor he had imbibed from Carlyle's writings. \"What was the most important thing he said to us?\" James asks the audience of his \"Dilemma of Determinism\": \"He said: 'Hang your sensibilities! Stop your snivelling complaints, and your equally snivelling raptures! Leave off your general emotional tomfoolery, and get to WORK like men [DD 174]!\" This is the no-nonsense language of the \"strenuous,\" or \"serious,\" moral mood (MP 210-13; cf. LWL 47-51,54-5 9) James always held forth as the only mood worthy of a human being, a mood he so often expresses in martial metaphors and\n\nMATTER AND MANNER\n\n29\n\ncalls to battle. This same man, toward the end of his career, deliberately set about an extended study of the military experience, in preparation for his eventual essay calling upon mankind to wage the battle for peace as a \"moral equivalent of war.\" 22 \"The Energies of Men,\" says Perry rightly, is nothing less than an essay on \"the psychology of heroism,\" a topic that always fascinated James. \"What Makes a Life Significant?\" asks the title of another such lecture, and the answer comes: \"courage, struggle, riskin a word, heroism. . . .\" 23 One of his most telling thrusts against the Cliffords and the Huxleys was that the materialistic universe their science might bequeath us could offer no ultimate support for the heroic dedication to truth to which they summoned us! 24 For heroism must be fueled by the \"vital heat\" of a fighting faith: 25 James's personal religious belief always wore this moral, even moralistic, battle-dress; this, and his accompanying conviction that we may not lay the existence of evils, any more than their final conquest, at the doorstep of an \"infinite\" God, partially account for the arm's-length he always kept between himself and every form of institutionalized religion. 26 God himself could be enhanced by man's uncompromising fidelity to the call which such a \"melioristic\" universe laid upon him; it did make sense to speak of a \"deepest service\" one could pay to that universe. This, I suggest, is the fuller, rounder resonance that such terms as \"risk\" take on when James employs them; alongside the stern and martial risks of this cosmic battle, the risks of the gaming table give off a tinny echo, and sports of any description shrink to puny metaphors. When, by the time he was thirty-five, James had become a popular figure on the lecture platform, he acceded eagerly to the invitations that came his way. The income which would help him further his children's education had something to do with that. But more significant is what\n\n30\n\nWILLIAM JAMES\n\nhe made of that opportunity. It offered him quite literally a platform to have his say, at last, \"about the deepest reasons of the universe,\" to share his own \"cosmic nostalgia,\" and deal with the deepest, most general problems that, his own experience convinced him, were of vital importance to others as well. He returns, in a word, to the topic that had always been the \"great interest\" of his life: religion. He had always admired in his father not so much the \"philosopher\" of religion as the \"prophet\"; he now takes up the succession, donning his own prophetic mantle with accustomed grace, and delivering his message in a vernacular spiced with the same verve and dash as always flavored his conversations. But his seriousness is evidenced by the cluster of topics he chose to deal with: in 18 77, \"The Sentiment of Rationality\";27 in 1879, \"Rationality, Activity and Faith\";28 in 1880, \"Great Men and Their Environment\"; in 1881, \"Reflex Action and Theism\"; in 1884, \"The Dilemma of Determinism\"; in 1891, \"The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life\"; in 1895, \"Is Life Worth Living?\" and in 1896, \"The Will to Believe.\" By 1899, James has been invited to give the prestigious Gifford Lectures. Health problems force a delay; but he has already decided upon the topic he intends to treat, and is snatching every well moment to get ready: The Varieties of Religious Experience is the fruit of that stubborn labor. All the lectures mentioned above contribute, each in its way, to our understanding of \"The Will to Believe.\" For they all serve to illumine a range of questions which, on examination, turn out to be one closely related family of questions, if not, at bottom, the same fundamental question orchestrated in a variety of registers. They all concern themselves with the most general \"cosmic\" terms on which human life, as James sees it, \"makes sense\"; they all reconnoiter the impact the \"religious dimension\" has on that vital human question; they all propose, as crucial to settling that question, the appeal of a moral life lived in the\n\nMATTER AND MANNER\n\n31\n\nserious or \"strenuous\" as against the genial, \"easy-going\" mood; and cumulatively they support the conclusion that it is reasonable to believe in the religious dimension which, James is convinced, is indispensable for sustaining that moral mood. \"'Religion,'\" James writes in 1873, \"'in its most abstract expression may be defined as the affirmation that all is not vanity.' \" 29 That \"all,'' for him, embraces the most precious values humankind has come to cherish; for if religion itself is vanity and humans have no right to believe in it, then our sentiment of rationality is a liar, the universe makes no sense, we are not genuinely free, morality is an illusion and heroism the posturing of witless idiots, and the sort of life this leaves us with is certainly not worth living. We must not let his manner deceive us; the man took these matters with ultimate seriousness. If the whole man was mobilized in his address to these questions, the whole man was equally engaged in grappling with them. NOTES\n\n1.

Crucial to Hick's case are his view of Pascal's Wager argument and what he presumes was James's attitude toward that argument. Hick begins his study of James's lecture by instituting a brief \"pilot study\" of Pascal's Wager. This way of proceeding, however much encouraged by James himself, already supposes a kinship between the Wager and James's \"will\" to believe; in any case, it may have served to highlight, for Hick, features in James's argument which naturally send the mind back to its family resemblances with the Wager. It is striking, for example, how tirelessly Hick worries the objection that James had an \"essentially sporting\" attitude toward the ultimate issues of belief (p. 40) ;1 that he regards faith as a \"prudent gambler\" would, whereas the ordinary religious believer brings to faith an attitude \"entirely different from that of the gambler\" (p. 42). References abound to \"risk\" and \"risking,\" \"winning\" and \"losing,\" \"staking\" and \"backing,\" and it is symptomatic of Hick's perspective that his only reference (p. 40) to another of James's popular lectures is to the passage in \"The Sentiment of Rationality\" where James speaks of the \"total game of life\" in which we are obliged to \"stake our persons all the while.\" This preferential stress, I suggest, may initially have arisen from James's introductory allusions to Pascal's\n\n34\n\nWILLIAM JAMES\n\nWager; but it may also have been exacerbated by Hick's own estimate of that passage in the Pensees. He assures us that the Wager assumes a view of our cognitive capacities such that the problem of God's existence must be dealt with in the same way as we would deal with the question whether \"a coin will fall head or tail at a particular throw.\" Pascal, therefore, has likened the option to believe or not believe to a \"game of chance\"; we all live in a \"cosmic gambling den\" and are forced to wager one way or the other, and Pascal advises us to make the wager which may gain us everything but which, if we have bet on the wrong side, will lose us virtually nothing (p. 34). Conceive of God, Hick goes on, after the model of some \"touchy Eastern potentate,\" invisible, but publicly advertised as \"inordinately jealous for homage,\" and Pascal's argument might well be a \"rational form of insurance.\" It costs us nothing to make a reverence to his apparently empty throne, even if he does not exist; whereas if he does exist, we may have \"saved our lives\" by thus placating him! These \"barbarous earthy terms\" into which the Wager \"translates so readily,\" Hick sums up, betray its \"essentially non-religious character.\" The conception of the deity which it implies has \"shocked many readers\" since Pascal first published it (p. 34). Thus far Hick's formal presentation of Pascal's Wager. Granted: his introductory remarks warn us that Pascal himself seems to have proposed the Wager, not as a \"normal path to belief in God,\" but rather as a \"final and desperate attempt\" to move the \"almost invincibly apathetic unbeliever.\" It does not, then, represent Pascal's own \"central thinking\" about belief in God, and, Hick speculates, the Pensees in the finished form they never came to assume would have seen Pascal hedge his Wager with all manner of \"safeguards and qualifications\" (pp. 33-34). One wonders, though, whether Hick himself has kept these caveats in ~d, for he soon goes on to charac-\n\nJAMES AND PASCAL\n\n35\n\nterize the Wager in the bald and repellent terms quoted above. More to my point here, however, is the fact that Hick seems not to have credited James with any great awareness that such caveats might be in order. He solemnly intones that the Wager's \"implied conception of the deity\" is rightfully shocking, and adds, without a break, that \"William James has used the same basic idea\" of God, as though it were \"consonant with Christian theism\" (pp. 34-35). Then, with spectacles so tinted, Hick turns to a discussion of James's lecture. With that set of lenses, it is not altogether surprising that Hick caught in his sights the \"sporting,\" \"gambler\" James he was predisposed to see. There is, of course, more to Hick's criticism of James than I have summarized here; the other points he makes will occupy our attention further on. My purpose now is to focus on that precise aspect of his critique which springs from the kinship, as he sees it, between James's argument and Pascal's Wager. The point I hope to make is this: a more careful study of the Pensees, combined with a wider and more sensitive appreciation of James's attitude toward that work, warrants our drawing conclusions quite the reverse of those which Hick would urge upon us. It is worth noting, to begin with, that James seems to have enjoyed a lifelong familiarity with the Pensees, a familiarity that strikes the reader as warmly sympathetic, on the whole. That kind of familiarity one would expect of anyone educated in a French culture; its absence would surprise almost as much as an American's ignorance of Tom Sawyer or of the Gettysburg Address. 2 It comes, then, as less than startling that James, who received so much of his early education abroad, and notably in Geneva, can allude to Pascal, even quote him, as easily and naturally as he does. Malgre les miseres qui nous tiennent par la gorge: he cites the phrase in the most unforced fashion,\n\n36\n\nWILLIAM JAMES\n\nespecially when ruminating on the \"greatness and misery of man.\" For that was the Pascalian context in which it occurred in Charles Louandre's edition of the Pensees, 3 a copy of which, annotated-so the editors of his Works assure us (254n16.6, 259n29.7)-with a series of marginal comments and cross-referef!.ces, was found in his personal library. The above quotation occurs in a letter of 1869, during James's famous period of depression, and was penned only shortly before he set himself to reading Charles Renouvier's Deuxieme Essai. That historical context is significant, as we shall see very shortly.4 James had, therefore, a more than ordinary familiarity with Pascal's Pensees and a lively interest in that work. And yet, we may guess that he felt a certain resistance to Pascal as well. For James's entire religious orientation was anti-orthodox and anti-institutional, while Pascal was pleading for the inflexible orthodoxy of that superbly institutionalized religion, Roman Catholicism. James's religious set was staunchly Protestant, and here was Pascal, defending the religion of \"masses and holy water.\" Such stuff might do for his Irish maid and Italian grocer, but a Harvard type of the 1890s could recognize benightedness when he saw it; James fully expects that same acknowledgment from those satellite luminaries at Yale and Brown. Why, one would as easily succumb to the seductions of the Mahdi.... . And yet, Pascal has gotten into his blood; he cannot overco!lle his fascination for the man. His thoughts volleyed forth like flaming arrows, scarlet with passion yet crystalline with intelligence; his style, so unequivocally \"the man,\" admirable, endearing, pathetic, was so much what the Jamesian style would become; and here was a mathematician of genius depreciating, or at least severely calling into question, the primacy of a form of thought which James found so alien to his own personal bent. For the \"reasons\" that move the human being in matters of\n\nJAMES AND PASCAL\n\n37\n\ngreat moment are, Pascal declared, not reasons of head or brain so much as reasons of the \"heart.\" This was one of the most cherished and frequently proclaimed insights of that prophetic character Henry James, Sr.;5 it was a conviction that deeply marked his son-so deeply that one is tempted to view his philosophical career as one sustained endeavor to codify what his father had intuitively seen. James's ambivalence toward Pascal translates into a profound ambivalence toward his Wager argument. In his first treatment of it, in fact, he is quite as searingly critiCal as Hick is. The context of that early treatment is important, however: James is preparing his auditors' minds to question their own conviction that our volitional natures should never be permitted to influence our acceptance of any truths, whatever their nature. The precise point he concedes to them, momentarily, is the contradictory of what he will eventually prove; after summarizing the Wager, he concludes that all such Pascalian talk of \"believing by our volition seems, then, ... simply silly\" (WB 7). His description of the Wager is, in part at least, a deliberate caricature, calculated to encourage that false conclusion. Pascal is trying to \"force\" us into believing by reducing our concern with truth to a gambler's interest in a \"game of chance\"; for \"A game is going on between you and the nature of things which at the day of judgment will bring out either heads or tails\" (WB 5). He has anticipated Hick's metaphors, and they cut with the same critical edge. His audience must feel, James goes on to observe, that this gambling metaphor implies that the apologist for belief has been put to his \"last trumps\"; a faith adopted on the basis of so mechanical a calculation would \"lack the inner soul of faith's reality.\" His final observation is devastating: if we were God, we should rightly take a mordant delight \"in cutting off believers of this pattern from their infinite reward\" (WB 6). Can this be the man who, Hick assures\n\n38\n\nWILLIAM JAMES\n\nus, \"used the same basic idea,\" the same \"touchy Eastern potentate\" conception of God as Pascal's Wager? Indeed, is Hick's criticism of the Wager, when all is said, any more acid than James's was before him? But it must be conceded, perhaps in Hick's favor (but only perhaps), that James now slues off and aims his critique at Pascal's religion of \"masses and holy water\"; this, he assumes his auditors will agree, is no longer a \"live\" option for enlightened Protestants like themselves, any more than the Mahdi's appeal for their trust and worship would be. Hick makes some reasonably solid points against this phase of James's argument, which I shall deal with further on. But what may have faintly encouraged Hick in setting up his hasty equation between James and Pascal is the series of more sympathetic remarks James later comes to make on the Wager argument. Having conceded to his audience as much as he thought was their due-that allowing our volitional nature to influence our acceptance of truth would be, in the number of instances at least, either \"silly\" or even \"vile\"-James goes on to argue that there are other instances in which our volitional nature does, in point of fact, wield such an influence. There are, therefore, \"passional tendencies and volitions which run before ... belief\" (WB 11; emphasis added) , he concludes. In the light of that conclusion he now reverses his field and admits that \"Pascal's argument, instead of being powerless, then seems a regular clincher. . . . The state of things,\" therefore, \"is evidently far from simple ...\" (WB 11). At this precise point in his lecture, James gives formal expression to the thesis he means to defend in the remainder of his talk. One of the central points of that thesis comes down to affirming that \"Our passional nature not only lawfully may, but must,\" in certain instances at least, \"decide\" matters for us (WB 11; emphasis deleted). Not only does our passional nature de facto intervene in the\n\nJAMES AND PASCAL\n\n39\n\nformation of certain beliefs, but there are instances in which it must so intervene, and therefore lawfully, de jure, may so intervene. Perhaps, after all, there was some validity in Pascal's way of arguing! This brings us to the other, more sympathetic side of James's ambivalent attitude toward the Wager, and to Pascal more generally. And here, again, he anticipates Hick to a remarkable degree. The Wager, James knew well, was by no means all that Pascal had written even in his Pensees. Pascal's own personal belief, he avows-even if it be in masses and holy water!-must have had different roots; hence, the Wager must have been an argument aimed at others, a \"last desperate snatch at a weapon\" forged against hardhearted unbelievers. It comes a:s no surprise, therefore, when at a pivotal juncture in his lecture, James appeals (WB 21) to that celebrated Pascalian adage \"The heart has its reasons, of which reason knows nothing.\" For to compare the worth of things, he goes on to say, \"we must consult not science, but what Pascal calls our heart. Science herself,\" in fact, \"consults her heart\" when judging that factual knowledge is worth our having, indeed, is one of the \"supreme goods\" humans can strive for (WB 22). \"The heart has its reasons\": that phrase has often been used to justify wishy-washy sentiment, mindless loveconquers-allism, anarchic feeling as arbiter on any and every question. Indeed, there are instances where one suspects that some such understanding commands James's own interpretation of the phrase. 6 But James knew better; I hope it will come clear further on in this essay that he did so. To make that clear, however, one is well-advised to begin with what Pascal himself meant by the \"heart\" and by its \"reasons.\" This is the very tack, it would seem, that James himself took: his personal copy of the Pensees shows that he wrote in page references to three additional occurrences of the\n\n40\n\nWILLIAM JAMES\n\nterm coeur (Works 259n27.9) ;7 one may surmise that he saw the term as important for Pascal, that it caught his interest, and that he may well have been trying to find some common thread of meaning running through these various uses of it. It would be idle to pretend that Pascal had any single technical meaning for the term: he was not that kind of writer. But it is still possible to locate a \"field\" of meanings, and with enough accuracy to exclude what he did not mean and to divine what a reader like James might find him suggesting. Pascal's spiritual kinship with St. Augustine is a matter of record. One would fully expect, then, to uncover analogies between his coeur and Augustine's cor; thus, it is not surprising that for both of them the \"heart\" is the seat from which the \"inner man\" beholds and responds to the higher world whence God addresses his call to fallen human creatures. But to hearken to that call fallen creatures must recognize both their \"grandeur\" and their \"misery,\" the wretchedness into which they have been plunged, and (in the phrase we have already seen James use), despite the \"miseries\" which \"clutch us by the throat,\" the \"irrepressible instinct which raises us upward.\" 8 That recognition carries a feeling-charge, but it is a recognition; it has genuine noetic character and value. \"Reason\" functions, not in opposition to, but alongside, the heart, or, more exactly, subordinated to it; reason functions at its best, in fact, when directed by and responsive to the urgings of the heart. Reason is unable, for example, to prove the \"first principles\" which guide it in its operations: the heart alone can intuit and approve of them. So, in one of the passages James lists in his annotations, \"it is on the knowiedge supplied by the heart and instinct that reason depends, founding thereon all its utterances.\" 9 Or, in another phrase that caught James's attention, \"We know the truth not only through reason, but also by the heart.\" 10 How, then, to\n\nJAMES AND PASCAL\n\n41\n\ntranslate the phrase from this same context \"C'est le coeur qui sent Dieu, et non la raison\"? 11 The usual translation runs, it is the heart that \"feels\" God, not reason, and surely Pascal is intimating the feeling-charge that accompanies that apprehension, when the heart is properly sensible, \"sensitized\" to God's call. But sentir is just as much a noetic term; it expresses an apprehension, but the kind of loving apprehension of which reason is incapable. This is the meaning to be given to the famous phrase \"the heart has its reasons, of which reason knows nothing.\" Those \"reasons of the heart\" are the farthest thing from blind and mindless sentiment. So Pascal can pen that lapidary pensee that says merely \"heart, instinct, principles.\" 12 The heart's intuition of \"principles\" is an \"instinctive\" grasp, as \"natural\" 13 as the heart's \"love\" for both itself and the Universal Being. The Pyrrhonian skeptic, whom Pascal brings repeatedly into his sights, is capable of questioning even that fundamental intuition; he can argue that our lives may be merely a . dream, that space, time, motion may not be real. 14 But this merely reminds us that humans can fight against their basic God-given \"instincts\"; for \"nature\" is fallen, and the \"heart\" itself can be corrupted. Heart, nature, instinct: Pascal adds another member to this family of terms. He speaks of the will directing (and legitimately directing) the operations of the mind, somewhat as \"heart\" is entitled to do. At this juncture we come ·· very close to James's own \"will\" to believe. \"The will,\" writes Pascal, is one of the principal agents of belief; not that it creates belief, but because things are true or false according to the side from which we look at them. The will, preferring one aspect to another, turns the mind away from contemplating the qualities of things which possess qualities it does not care to see; and so the mind, walking in step with the will, stops to look at the aspect it likes; it comes to a stand before the aspect it prefers, and so it forms judgment by what it sees therein. 15\n\n42\n\nWILLIAM JAMES\n\nCompare that proposition with this one, from James's personal notebook: \"'Free will,'\" he writes, means \"'the sustaining of a thought because I choose to, when I might have other thoughts' \" (quoted in Letters 1 147) . That phrase James entered into his notebook in 1870; he had just come across it while reading Charles Renouvier's Deuxieme Essai. That reading made him credit Renouvier with his \"rebirth\" from the fearful depression that had held him under for two long years! The sentiment is, however, remarkably Pascalian in import. But the context from which James drew it is even more remarkably Pascalian. To quote Perry's elegant summary of the matter: Renouvier was an empiricist who recognized the empiricist's \"narrow and momentary certainty in the immediate presence of particular facts,\" and went on to stress \"the discrepancy between this dubiousness of knowledge and the assurance of belief.\" Only the will, he argued, can ensure the \"consummation of belief\" that reason itself cannot ensure. But how to justify this leap to belief, this \"premature and hazardous self-commitment,\" with its \"excess of assurance over evidence\"? The only justification possible is a moral one: \"where experience and logic are not decisive, and where there is at the same time a practical need of belief, there belief may and should be dictated by moral and religious considerations.\" Perry goes on to relate Renouvier's claim that \"As a matter of fact ... all of the great philosophical systems are expressions of the temperaments and inclinations of their authors, however much they may profess to submit only . . . irresistible proof\"-a contention that James cited in his notes, and then went on to incorporate into his personal thinking.16 Pascal, Renouvier, James: even if we do not subscribe, to the letter, to all Perry's interpretations, the genealogical traces are strikingly suggestive. Did James refresh his acquaintance with Pascal while working on \"The Will to Believe\"? There is excellent reason for thinking so. But\n\nJAMES AND PASCAL\n\n43\n\nquite aside from that historical question, the ineffaceable family resemblance between Pascal and James runs deeper than any suggested by Hick's polemics. 17 That kinship only makes James's ambiguity toward Pascal's Wager all the more intriguing. His summary (WB 5-6) of the central portion of Pascal's argument is careful and fair enough;18 but, even given the argumentative context, to say that Pascal is striving to \"force\" us into Christianity by encouraging us to equate our concern for truth with a gambler's concern for the outcome of a coin-toss is as unjust to Pascal as Hick is to James. But James goes on to make Pascal's argument conclude in this fashion: \"Go, then, and take holy water, and have masses said; belief will come and stupefy your scruples,-Cela vous fera croire et vous abetira. Why should you not? At bottom, what have you to lose [WB 6]?\" Now this, one must protest, is entirely too offhand. Nor is the unfairness of James's characterization sufficiently offset by his admission that Pascal had concocted his argument for others than himself, for hardhearted unbelievers. Hick, we saw, uses almost identical language, except that, in one of his few departures from James's estimate, he describes the unbeliever as \"apathetic\" rather than as hardhearted. Hick is closer: for Pascal is addressing, 19 not hardhearted unbelievers, but the torpid, rather, the unreflective, who day by day plod onward toward their death, without ever a sidelong thought to how that death will affect them. They live \"distracted by distraction from distraction\" as it were, or, in Pascal's own words, \"indifferent to the pursuit of the truth of a thing so vital, and touching them so closely\"; \"unreflecting, undisturbed, they live without a thought of the final end of life . . . as if they could annihilate eternity by turning their thoughts away from it.\" 20 Men like this \"must have lost all feeling\" when they do not even \"take the trouble to inquire\" about a question so vitally important to them. .\n\n44\n\nWILLIAM JAMES\n\nAdd a few centuries, and Pascal's estimate of his audience is not all that different from the one James levels on his own: \" 'I wish,' \" he writes to John Jay Chapman, \" 'you knew a few of the intellects at whom that speech was delivered.' \" His lecture is \" 'only calculated for the sickly hotbed atmosphere of the philosophk-positivistically enlightened scientific classroom,' \"for\" 'the victims of spinal paralysis which these studies superinduce.' \" Chapman had implied that the \"faith\" James had challenged them with was not robust enough, and James agrees; but for patients of the sort he had to deal with, only a dose of \" 'homeopathic treatment' \" would do them any good. It must have seemed to Chapman a \" 'poor little razor-like \"thin edge of the wedge\" which your academic personages twiddle between their fingers,' \" but even such a mild cathartic \" 'really does good.' \" 21 One does not, James is contending, try to catapult such victims of \"spinal paralysis\" from the anemic state they are in, in one unbroken arc, into the fullness of \"robust\" faith. But this was exactly Pascal's own view; it was buttressed by his orthodox conviction that Christian faith was a gift from God. That theological consideration need not have troubled James, but Pascal was also calling upon a psychological realism that should have appealed to him. His method would have appealed to Chapman, for it is far less gentle than James's own. Pascal feels that such \"spinal paralysis\" victims as he is dealing with must be shocked, awakened out of their \"strange insensibility to things of gravest import\"; he must make them sentir, both \"see and feel,\" the \"extravagance and stupidity\" of their benumbed condition, literally \"confound them by making them see what madmen they are.\" The language of a \"wager\" is one they will at least understand. But once Pascal's audience has been more accurately identified, it becomes clear that the Wager was neither the \"last\" nor the \"final\" argumentative tactic that James and\n\nJAMES AND PASCAL\n\n45\n\nHick, respectively, maintain that it must have been. It was much more, as James thought of his own lecture, a first step--more energetic and determined than James dared take, but only a first step. Pascal implies this when he writes: \"Before embarking on the proofs of Christianity, I think it necessary to point out the wrong-headedness of men who live indifferent to searching out the truth of a matter so vital....\" 22 All he hopes to accomplish, even by this shock therapy, is to wake them up, get them to see that the question is there and that it concerns them dreadfully, jolt them into a reflective mood. Facing them with the \"proofs\" of Christianity before ensuring that attitude would be woefully premature. This is a long chalk from hoping that his Wager will \"force\" them to believe in God, as James puts it, or provide an argumentative \"path,\" in Hick's milder term, toward such belief. Pascal is theologically too orthodox for that, and psychologically too astute. But he does end his \"wager\" gambit with the recommendation James quotes: take holy water, hear masses. What does he mean by this? Pascal's auditor has protested that he is still \"not free, not released\" from the desires that turn his life into a round of mindless pleasure-seeking; \"I am so made than I cannot believe. What am I to do?\" \"At least,\" Pascal replies, \"acknowledge your impotence toward believing.... Do your best to gain conviction, not by an increase of divine proofs, but by a decrease of human passions.\" Follow the route others have taken before you, he counsels: they did everything \"as if they believed-took holy water, heard masses, and so forth. Even naturally, that will make you believe, will stupefy you....\" 23 \"Even naturally\": Pascal is convinced that faith is essentially a supernatural affair, a gift from God. But the human being's \"natural\" dispositions have something to do with the receptivity which normally provides the soil for that gift. Yet humans are a strange amalgam: of soul\n\n46\n\nWILLIAM JAMES\n\nand that body which Descartes, and Pascal after him, regard as a \"machine.\" Surely the dispositions of the \"soul\" are alone relevant in preparing the ground for God's gift of faith? A strict Cartesian might agree, but not Pascal. The gestures, actions, postures of the \"machine\" can pave the way for analogous gestures and postures of the soul. Genuflect, and you may think that only the bodily machine has assumed this attitude of humility and adoration. But no, the soul is humbled too and, from that posture of abasement, begins to sense that adoration may not, after all, be so unnatural an attitude for it to take on. This is not adoration yet, any more than hearing masses or taking holy water is tantamount to full enjoyment of Pascal's Catholic faith; but for someone whose life has been a tumult of passionate desires, it \"stupefies\" both soul and body, and places him in the stillness where the \"heart\" may hearken to the call of God that conveys the gift of faith. \"To look for help from this outward act is superstition; to refuse to combine it with the inward is pride.\" 24 Not bad theology, that; not bad psychology either. As for the latter, one could have hoped that the man who wrote the ageless chapter on \"Habit\" in his Principles of Psychology might have done it greater justice. One final analogy: neither Pascal in his lengthy section on the Wager, nor James in his entire lecture, deals directly with the \"content\" and \"grounds\" of the decision to believe. Pascal intended to postpone his \"proofs\" for Christianity to a later portion of his \"apology\"; James restricts himself to a highly abstract definition of \"religion,\" and never directs his audience's att~ntion to the matters they might mull over in coming to a faith-decision. Does finite being entail the existence of an Infinite? Do the evils of our universe argue against the reality of a God? Does our world evidence traces of teleological design? We know that James himself dwelt long amid such questions, and that he found himself generally disaffected toward the\n\nJAMES AND PASCAL\n\n47\n\n\"traditional\" proofs for God's existence. Was he merely reluctant to air such \"content\" issues? The answer to that, I submit, is a clear \"no.\" For James shows no reluctance, in the other popular lectures of this period, to invite his hearers to probe into the features of our human world-freedom, morality, the hunger for happiness-that he came to think spoke most eloquently for God's existence. But he had been brought to realize how decisively the attitude we bring to such considerations inevitably influenced the conclusions we draw from them. A good lecturer sets out to make one main point, and James was a master of the art. So, from beginning to end, he resists the urge to expatiate on what we might believe, and severely confines himself to showing, as he hoped, that matters of religious faith are peculiar in this respect: they may, and even lawfully must, be approached with a \"heart\" attuned to its own kind of reasons, with a predisposing \"will\" to believe. A limited point, when all is said, but one which, if valid, is well worth making. To conclude, then: John Hick would have us read \"The Will to Believe\" in the light of Pascal's Wager argument, but as he himself interprets that argument for us. Look more carefully at Pascal, and at the relationship between Pascal and James, and Hick's counsel becomes darkly suspect. He has failed to bring into play the profound ambivalence James manifests toward both the Wager and Pascal's Pensees more generally. J ames's summary of the Wager's substance is surprisingly parallel to Hick's, and his initial estimate of its value, even if we allow for its contextual intention, is so acidly critical as almost to be unfair. But he is bending over backward to show his auditors how well he can understand their prejudice against all such volitional views of belief; it is only when he has softened, and then corrosively attacked, that prejudice that he unveils the more sympathetic view of Pascal's fundamental contention he has been backing the whole while.\n\n48\n\nWILLIAM JAMES\n\nWas Pascal, then, trying to \"force\" us into belief? It would be chancy to take this as James's last word on the matter; but it is mildly ironic that he characterizes the Wager as a \"last desperate snatch\" when close study shows it was more in the nature of an opening gam"
