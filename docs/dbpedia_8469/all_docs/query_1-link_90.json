        "text": "Epistemic consequentialism is the view that epistemic goodness is more fundamental than epistemic rightness. This paper examines the relationship between epistemic consequentialism and theistic belief. I argue that, in an epistemic consequentialist framework, there is an epistemic reason to believe in God. Imagine having an unlimited amount of time to ask an omniscient being anything you wanted. The potential epistemic benefits would be enormous. Considerations like these point to an epistemic version of Pascal's wager. I compare and contrast the epistemic wager with the traditional wager, and argue that the epistemic wager has several notable advantages.\n\nThis chapter is concerned with objections to theism that revolve around prudential considerations. The prospects of prudential arguments that aim to show that God doesn't exist seem to me dim. But I will consider whether prudential considerations can give us pragmatic reasons for not believing that God exists. I will also consider how prudential considerations can figure in debunking arguments against theist belief. I will then turn to the question of whether we should want God to exist. In answering this question, I will consider a further kind of prudential argument-an argument that moves from claims about what would follow from God's existence or non-existence, to prudential conclusions. In particular, I will consider axiological arguments purporting to show that God's existence would make our lives worse. I will end by briefly considering questions relating to nihilism, meaning, and significance."
