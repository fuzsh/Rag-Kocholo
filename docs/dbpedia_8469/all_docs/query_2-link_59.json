The first was the Great Bible commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII, and the second was the Bishops' Bible of 1568.

It was first published in the 1905 Christmas issue of the magazine Harper's Bazaar, and in book format in June 1906 by Harper and Brothers publishing house. It is written in the style of a diary kept by the first woman in the Judeo-Christian creation story, Eve, and is claimed to be \"translated from the original MS.\" The \"plot\" of this novel is the first-person account of Eve from her creation up to her burial by, her mate, Adam, including meeting and getting to know Adam, and exploring the world around her, Eden. The story then jumps 40 years into the future after the Fall and expulsion from Eden. It is one of a series of books Twain wrote concerning the story of Adam and Eve, including 'Extracts from Adam's Diary,' 'That Day In Eden,' 'Eve Speaks,' 'Adam's Soliloquy,' and the 'Autobiography of Eve.' Eve's Diary has a lighter tone than the others in the series, as Eve has a strong appreciation for beauty and love. The book may have been written as a posthumous love-letter to Mark Twain's wife Olivia Langdon Clemens, or Livy, who died in June 1904, just before the story was written. Mark Twain is quoted as saying, \"Eve's Diary is finished â I've been waiting for her to speak, but she doesn't say anything more.\" The story ends with Adam's speaking at Eve's grave, \"Wherever she was, there was Eden.\"\n\nThe Critique of Pure Reason Immanuel Kant\n\nThe Critique of Pure Reason by Immanuel Kant, first published in 1781, second edition 1787, is one of the most influential works in the history of philosophy.

The poem, written in some 7,400 dactylic hexameters, is divided into six untitled books, and explores Epicurean physics through richly poetic language and metaphors. Lucretius presents the principles of atomism; the nature of the mind and soul; explanations of sensation and thought; the development of the world and its phenomena; and explains a variety of celestial and terrestrial phenomena.

Kant aspires to nothing less than this: to lay bare the fundamental principle of morality and show that it applies to us.\n\n\"The Kingdom of God Is Within You\" Leo Tolstoy\n\nThe Kingdom of God Is Within You is the non-fiction magnum opus of Leo Tolstoy. The book was first published in Germany in 1894 after being banned in his home country of Russia.

Chesterton\n\nOrthodoxy is a book by G. K. Chesterton that has become a classic of Christian apologetics. Chesterton considered this book a companion to his other work, Heretics. In the book's preface Chesterton states the purpose is to \"attempt an explanation, not of whether the Christian faith can be believed, but of how he personally has come to believe it.\" In it, Chesterton presents an original view of Christian religion.

The novel purports to be a commentary on the thought and early life of a German philosopher called Diogenes TeufelsdrÃ¶ckh , author of a tome entitled \"Clothes: their Origin and Influence\", but was actually a poioumenon. TeufelsdrÃ¶ckh's Transcendentalist musings are mulled over by a skeptical English Reviewer who also provides fragmentary biographical material on the philosopher. The work is, in part, a parody of Hegel, and of German Idealism more generally. However, TeufelsdrÃ¶ckh is also a literary device with which Carlyle can express difficult truths.\n\nDona Perfecta Benito PÃ©rez GaldÃ³s\n\nThis is a reproduction of a book published before 1923.
