        "text": "Biography of Blaise Pascal (1623-1662):\n\nBlaise Pascal (1623-1662) earned recognition as a renowned mathematician, physicist—and a man after God’s heart. As he came to the forefront of geometry and physics, he turned his considerable analytical abilities to study religion or, as he said, to “contemplate the greatness and the misery of man.” Pascal’s classic defense of Christianity—Pensées—persuaded many a skeptic in his time.\n\nPascal’s thought are living thoughts. They are not simply words on the page. They are filled with insight and demonstrate that his mind was “on fire” as in his writings concerning his conversion.\n\nOn November 23, 1654, between 10:30 and 12:30 at night, Pascal had an intense religious experience and immediately recorded the it in a brief note to himself which began, “Fire. God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not of the philosophers and the scholars…” and concluded by quoting Psalm 119:16: “I will not forget thy word. Amen.” He seems to have carefully sewn this document into his coat and always transferred it when he changed clothes; a servant discovered it only by chance after his death. This piece is now known as “the Memorial.” His belief and religious commitment revitalized, Pascal visited the older of two convents at Port-Royal for a two-week retreat in January 1655. For the next four years, he regularly traveled between Port-Royal and Paris. It was at this point immediately after his conversion when he began writing his first major literary work on religion, the Provincial Letters."
