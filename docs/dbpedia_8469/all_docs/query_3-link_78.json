        "text": "\"We view things not only from different sides, but with different eyes; we have no wish to find them alike.\" Blaise Pascal\n\nBlaise Pascal was a French philosopher, mathematician, scientist, inventor and theologian. He was born on June 19, 1623, in Clermont in the Auvergne region of central France and died on August 19, 1662, in Paris, France. In the area of mathematics, Pascal was an early pioneer in the fields of game theory and probability theory. In the area of philosophy, he was an early pioneer in existentialism. And as a writer on theology and religion, he was a defender of Christianity.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWith a life of just 39 years, Pascal has made much historic contribution to mathematics and to physical science, including both experimental and theoretical work on hydraulics, atmosphere pressure and the existence and nature of the vacuum.\n\nAs a scientist and philosopher of science, Pascal championed strict empirical observation and the use of controlled experiments; he opposed the rationalism and logico-deductive method of the Cartesians, and he opposed the metaphysical speculations and reverence for the authority of the theologians of the Middle Ages.\n\nBlaise Pascal: Major contributions\n\nHe has made a contribution to the field of mathematics, physics and philosophy. One of its contributions includes Pascal's triangle. Each number is the sum of the two numbers above it. The tip of the triangle and the sides are all ones. The numbers forming the body of the triangle are the addition of the two immediately above\n\nA year later, he laid the foundation for the probability theory. He was inspired by his desire to help a friend who had some questions regarding gambling. What he realizes that events don't happen randomly, but actually on what happened just before the event.\n\nIn 1646, Pascal experimented with atmospheric pressure and discovered that vacuums exist in the real world. He also found out that atmospheric pressure can be measured by using real weights.\n\nIn 1647, he discovered what is now known as Pascal's law or Pascal's principle. It states that pressure applied to a confined liquid is transmitted undiminished through the liquid in all directions regardless of the area to which the pressure is applied.\n\nPascal's Law is one of the most important discoveries in hydrostatics and it is the underlying principle of the hydraulic press which uses hydraulic pressure to multiply force. A hydraulic press is used in many devices including the hydraulic jack and the hydraulic brakes in vehicles. Pascal also invented the syringe as an application of his principle\n\nTwo detailed studies by him include 'Treatise on the Equilibrium of Liquids' and 'Treatise on the Weight of the Mass of Air', were published after his death and are considered seminal contributions to the sciences of hydraulics and hydrostatics\n\nPascal has also published a religious text. He had an intense religious vision in 1654 after which he focused on religious writings. Between January 1656 and March 1657, he published a series of eighteen letters to defend the Jansenist community of Port-Royal against the Jesuits. These eighteen letters are known as Letters Providenciales (Provincial letters).\n\nIn the Provincial letters, Pascal denounced casuistry as the mere use of complex reasoning to justify moral laxity and all sorts of sins. The reaction to the letters was substantial; and Pascal's use of wit, humour and mockery in attacking existing institutions made the work extremely popular as a literary masterpiece.\n\nThough King Louis XIV ordered the book to be destroyed, it survived and went on to influence the prose of later French writers like Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\n\nBlaise Pascal: Famous quotes\n\nTruth is so obscure in these times, and falsehood so established, that, unless we love the truth, we cannot know it.\n\nWe sail within a vast sphere, ever drifting in uncertainty, driven from end to end.\n\nhere are only two kinds of men: the righteous who think they are sinners and the sinners who think they are righteous.\n\nWe view things not only from different sides but with different eyes; we have no wish to find them alike.\n\nIn faith, there is enough light for those who want to believe and enough shadows to blind those who don't.\n\nNature is an infinite sphere of which the centre is everywhere and the circumference nowhere.\n\nThat we must love one God only is a thing so evident that it does not require miracles to prove it.\n\nNothing is so intolerable to man as being fully at rest, without a passion, without business, without entertainment, without care.\n\nRead: Sant Guru Kabir Jayanti: Here are 4 inspiring verses of Kabir Das\n\nRead: Tribute to former Indian educationist, author Ahmed Essop\n\nPublished By:\n\nRoshni\n\nPublished On:\n\nJun 19, 2019\n\n--- ENDS ---"
