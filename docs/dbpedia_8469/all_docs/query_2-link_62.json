        "text": "The following list is one of the most famous book lists around. The set was compiled and published by Encyclopedia Britannica in 1952, and the second edition, which expanded on the original body of work, was released in 1990. A competitor to the Harvard’s Classics set, the Great Books of the Western World (GBWW) comprises well over 100 of the greatest works to influence western thought. The brunt of the work in compiling these works is credited to the editor in chief, Robert Maynard Hutchins, and associate editor, Mortimer J. Adler. Keep in mind, any “classic” list will inevitably omit worthy works. In fact, I would argue, they leave out a majority of the great works. It’s more helpful to think of such a list as merely a selection of great works, much like a menu at a fine restaurant.\n\n“This is more than a set of books, and more than a liberal education. Great Books of the Western World is an act of piety. Here are the sources of our being. Here is our heritage. This is the West. This is its meaning for mankind.”\n\n– Robert Hutchins, Editor in Chief\n\nFor those interested in purchasing the GBWW, ebay often has several complete sets available for purchase (as of June 2020) between $300 – $450. (~$6-7 per volume). The complete set is 54 volumes, most of which contain multiple books. The following is a list of each book without categorization into the particular volume it appears in. Additionally, some authors (e.g. Sigmund Freud) have so many of their works represented, that listing all of them here is not helpful. For these works (those authors with more than three works represented), I have simply listed as “works of Author” to reduce the list to a manageable size.\n\nIf you’re serious about studying the GBWW set in a methodical way, check out the 10 year reading plan provided for the 1952 edition.\n\nBelow are a number of images of the GBWW set, highlighting the authors represented, an example title page, the decorative spines, author biographies, text size comparison, and the Syntopicon (vols. 2 & 3), which provide encyclopedic coverage of the “great ideas” along with references to their mentions throughout the GBWW set.\n\nWhere can you buy the Great Books of the Western World? While no longer actively printed, you can find some existing sets out there on Amazon or eBay.\n\nOn the ThinkingWest Youtube Channel, we’ve provided an in depth review of the GBWW book set below. Christian Poole covers aesthetics, font size, readability, the GBWW’s origins, what works are included, and how to obtain the GBWW set today.\n\n1952 Edition\n\nThe following list includes links to suggested editions that can be purchased by those who do not wish to bother with finding a version published by Britannica.
