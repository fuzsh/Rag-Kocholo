Time and place of birth

Seventeenth century’s this great french mathematician was born to Etienne pascal and Antoinette begon on 19th June 1623, in Clermont Ferrand Auvergne, France.

Blaise contributed all his life to maths. He was the first person to proved the conic theorem also known as pascal’s theorem. He was one of the first inventors of the calculator. which this world has known as pascaline named after him.

He gave the world the theory of probability which is very vital for economics in modern time. Also with this, he gave us an arthematical triangle which we have known as pascal’s triangle.

Contribution in mathematics

Blaise pascal contributed throughout all his life in mathematics. His contributions towards maths are here:

Pascal’s theorem

When pascal was just a 16-year-old boy he began working on a theorem which is popularly known as essays of conics. Pascal presented this theorem and world-known it as pascal’s theorem.

Pascaline

This was his one of the most important contribution towards maths, a calculator. He is said to be one of the first inventors of the calculator. Pascal’s calculator is known as pascaline.

Theory of probability

Pascal worked on this theory with another famous mathematician Fermat due to his friend Mere. Today this theory is very important for economics.

Arthematical triangle

In 1654 Blaise wrote about this but unfortunately, this was published after his death In 1665. This mathematical triangle presents the binomial coefficients.

Balise pascal is such a name in the field of maths and physics that needs no introduction. Just like him, France is the home to many great mathematicians like him. Like Fermat with which he worked. Like Simon la place, Marie Germain and Augustin Louis Cauchy all are French. Maybe we can say that France is a lucky country because it got such great mathematics personalities over the centuries.
