Do you hide it away or wear it with pride, and has it stopped anyone from doing anything for the fear of others seeing it?\n\nAlthough I'm very aware of mine, I have never thought twice about getting changed or being naked in front of someone else because it's something I cannot hide and has helped m ...\n\n1\n\nBees\n\nWhen to switch to high output bags at night?\n\nQuestion: Does anyone with an ileostomy use high output bags only at night for sleeping but regular size during the day? If so, how does that work? Do you discard the day or night bag each evening or morning? That would seem like a waste. Or do you rinse them out for reuse the next day?\n\nI have to empty my bag 6-8 times a day, which I don't consider high output nor unmanageable. But getting up ...\n\nJD\n\nOstomy, Bags, and the Ocean\n\nToday was a good day - continuing to figure out how to live life with Oscar (my ostomy). Went in the ocean for the first time. Swam with my dog and so forth - maybe 30 mins total. Bag had been on for six days and changed it when I got back. Everything looked good, stoma happy, adhesive holding, etc. Wore a makeshift wrap and a running singlet in the water to hold everything together.\n\nCurious w ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHollister\n\nAre you worried about your ostomy's impact on your sex life?

I learned it from a home ostomy nurse when we couldn't get a bag to fit on right. If you eat like 5 marshmallows 15 to 20 minutes before you change it, the marshmallows actually dry the little stoma up so you can get it changed. And you even get a little break before it start ...\n\nMike1988\n\nSeeking Alternatives to Loperamide for Ostomy - Need Advice\n\nHello\n\nAfter asking for help on my previous post yesterday called 'Ileostomy help', I thought I would ask if anyone takes an alternative to Loperamide Hydrochloride (Imodium) to control and regulate bowel function for ostomy.

At first, all was well, but now I am having issues with the bag staying adhered for more than 3 days. I have found that quite often after showering, the adhesive starts to loosen.

But I never really considered cornmeal. There is a light dusting of cornmeal on the bottom of my English muffins, and it comes out in my bag. All little tiny dots of it. It makes an interesting pattern. So, what is up with that? Does cornmeal not digest because it is a corn product, or is my ostomy just unusually ta ...\n\nterrizajdel\n\n362 Days on the Carnivore Diet as an Ostomate\n\nHi\n\nHi everyone, 362 days on carnivore and I'm still doing great. I'm consistently at 150 to 152 lbs and full of energy, so the 44 lb weight loss is effortless to maintain. I eat whatever meat products that are on sale, and if it has skin, I peel it off first.
