        "text": "1. Okay, I kinda did watch this movie well into adulthood – but it's been a while!\n\n2. Awww, the cute photo montage to “Happy Together” by The Turtles. Suddenly I’m 10 again!\n\n3. PSYCHE. It’s not The Turtles, it's Simple Plan. Coming in with those angsty guitars and setting the whole tone of the film.\n\n4. I love the opening dichotomy of Tess being all “riiiise and shiiiiine” and Anna having to be literally dragged out of bed – one is definitely more relatable than the other.\n\n5. UGH, Anna’s little brother Harry is sooooo annoying. If my sibling woke me up with an air horn it’d be the last thing they ever did.\n\n6. Tess clearly has a favourite child... Harry.\n\n7. Actually no, Tess is better than that. Her relationship with Anna is just more complicated than her relationship with Harry.\n\n8. It’s almost like they don’t quite get each other, and they need to spend a day living each other’s lives to renew their bond...\n\n9. Dear God, I forgot that Anna has the WORST hair. Those blonde streaks against the dark red are horrible in Aguilerean extremes. Unforgiveable.\n\n10. Oh shit, remember Stacey Hinkhouse? We hate Stacey Hinkhouse.\n\n11. It's 2003, so Anna's love interest being played by Chad Michael Murray makes sense. Looking back though, he's definitely not as hot as we all thought, right?\n\n12. Maybe it's just his hair that's bad – the Shaggy Rogers look is not working for me.\n\n13. OMG Anna is just a mixed-up teenager trying to live her life and people keep screwing her over. Anna is all of us.\n\n14. Like her teacher Mr. Bates – wow. I always thought he was just strict, but I think I was just brainwashed to respect adults because this guy is a TOOL.\n\n15. The soundtrack to this film is VERY underrated – it's a sparkling toast to early noughties pop-punk.\n\n16. Tess's supermarket scene is so iconic to me. Like, when she says \"you are a smart, strong, beautiful, independent woman and you don’t need a man to complete you\" – we've all recited that once or twice for our friends, right?\n\n17. I’m very uninterested in Anna and Jake’s budding romance. Sorry.\n\n18. OMG, this is the first time we hear Anna's band Pink Slip. This song slaps so hard! Do you remember the song? I'm going to guess that \"Take Me Away\" is the title.\n\n19. There are two men in the band but they're never introduced. Who are they? Why are they there? Who are they??\n\n20. Watching them react to stuff in the background is fun though. One just looked directly into the camera. Brilliant.\n\n21. Is Ryan attractive? I feel like he might be a very specific person’s type. Personally, I think he’s punching with Tess.\n\n22. They are cute together though.\n\n23. Tess has written a book but the cover is the ugliest cover I’ve ever seen. I would judge that cover.\n\n24. Okay, Harry goes wayyyyyy too far. He brought his mates into Anna’s room, got them to put on her underwear, and then read her diary out loud. WTAF?!\n\n25. I actually think I can recite the entire Anna/Tess dinner table scene off by heart. Remember when she screams \"you're ruining my life\"? I learned a lot of tricks and phrases from Anna for my own angsty teenager years.\n\n25. As if they had an epic argument like that in a public restaurant... How uncouth!\n\n26. Does anybody know what the old lady says? Is it actually Mandarin? I'd like to know.\n\n27. “EARTHQUAKE!” – Grandpa. His best line. It has more than a few reprisals.\n\n28. Again, I think I can quote the entire sequence of Tess waking up as Anna.\n\n29. “I’m allowed because I’m old!” Do you think Jamie Lee resented all the jabs about her age in this script?\n\n30. Okay, how Jamie Lee’s performance as Tess as Anna didn’t get an Oscar nom is beyond me! “Ohhhh, I’m like the crypt keeper!” Seriously, her delivery is a gag a minute. Jamie Lee does Anna better than Lindsay ever could.\n\n31. I don’t vibe with Harry, but he is being bullied and NO ONE cares! What is this, 13 Reasons Why?\n\n32. Yeah, Stacey Hinkhouse is a fucking cow. Who pushes someone down a flight of stairs like that? Holy shit.\n\n33. Cut to Tess’s makeover scene, which is SUBLIME. The music, the hair, the dress, those boots! I stan 10000%.\n\n34. The crying woman in therapy! ICONIC. I would love to play that part.\n\n35. Anna could not give a shit about keeping it together for eight hours enough to not get her mother fired. She is not trying with these patients in the slightest.\n\n36. Oooooooh, meanwhile Tess as Anna shakes down Elton Bates. WHAT a reveal! He was rejected by a young Tess at school.\n\n37. I'm sorry Tess, two things – why do you not love your new look, and since when was looking like Stevie Nicks a bad thing?\n\n38. Fun fact – I used to say that “my first french fry in eight years” line whenever I would eat chips as a youngster. I was a weird kid to be around.\n\n39. Perhaps the best line of the ENTIRE film (and it's difficult to choose) is when Anna as Tess says “let’s hit her\" when they're talking to Pei Pei at the restaurant.\n\n40. Okay, Tess’s parenting might be a bit dodgy after all, since her kids seem to not get on in the slightest. Harry can’t stand to reveal he ~actually~ likes his sister, and Anna is so selfish that she doesn’t even care about Harry failing maths or being bullied. She only pays attention in the parent-teacher conference when it turns out that Harry’s written a letter about her.\n\n41. Sorry to beat you over the head with this, but Stacey Hinkhouse is pure evil. The fake cheating on her test thing – who thinks of that?!\n\n42. OF ALL THE DAYS, TESS HAD TO MAKE HER TV APPEARANCE TODAY!\n\n43. Who else thought they could fake that interview a damn sight better than Anna did? Just me? Well, that is until she TURNS THE PARTY. I’m sorry but the real Anna could NEVER. Anna as Tess is like a completely different character.\n\n44. Okay, it’s fucked up that Jake has tried it on with Anna and is now going for Tess, but you gotta admit they have chemistry.\n\n45. Now Jake has come to the house to sing outside and his voice is terrible.\n\n46. “You’re beautiful but you’re not her” – Jake, do you realise how fucked up you are?\n\n47. Now he's at the wedding rehearsal!??\n\n48. In another version of this movie, Jake is one of Tess’s more challenging patients and he’s become dangerously obsessed with her and her daughter.\n\n49. One, why are there security guards at this wedding rehearsal? Two, why do they arrest Anna’s two friends and not stalker Jake?\n\n50. Jamie Lee Curtis looks like a super tall lady.\n\n51. Did I just google Jamie Lee’s height? Yes.\n\n52. She's about 5'7 for anyone who cares. I guess that's tall for a lady; I'm 6'3 so that's short to me.\n\n53. OMG The House of Blues – I can’t wait to hear the song againnnnnnn. Wait, how did Tess as Anna get in at 15 years old?!?!\n\n62. Wait, they swapped back and then Anna continued her speech in her old body? How confusing for all of the guests.\n\n63. YAY, the wedding went ahead!\n\n64. Jake is there, of course.\n\n65. I guess he technically liked Anna all along, but it’s still weird – she is 15 and he works at her school! And he fancied her mum for a hot sec.\n\n66. Little hint of a sequel where Harry swaps with Grandpa? Nope. Stopped in its tracks by Pei-Pei.\n\n67. Still one of my favourite movies ever, and while Lindsay is great, it’s Jamie Lee who makes this film."
