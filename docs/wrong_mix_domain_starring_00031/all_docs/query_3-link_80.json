        "text": "Ruby Gillman (Lana Condor)\n\nQuirky teen Ruby Gillman (voiced by Lana Condor) loves math. She and her friends are highly anticipating prom at her high school, but her overprotective mom forbids her to go on the boat where prom will be. As Krakens in hiding, the Gillmans live in Oceanside to stay moist by living near the water, but not in it. If they get in the ocean, their true nature becomes more apparent. Ruby also has a crush on human boy Connor (Jaboukie Young-White), who she tutors in math.\n\nLana Condor is known for portraying Lara Jean Song-Covey in the “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” films, Jubilee in “X-Men: Apocalypse,” voicing Koyomi in “Alita: Battle Angel” and Saya Kuroki in “Deadly Class.” She recently played Erika Vu in “Boo, Bitch” and Sophie in “Moonshot.” She will next be seen in “Coyote vs. Acme.”\n\nAgatha Gillman (Toni Collette)\n\nAgatha Gillman has adapted well to life on land as a realtor in Oceanside. She is very protective of her family and children, forbidding the kids to go near the ocean. Ruby later learns that this rule was made because the female krakens in her family, including Agatha, are very powerful and of royal blood.\n\nToni Collette is known for playing Lynn Sear in “The Sixth Sense” (1999), Fiona Brewer in “About a Boy” (2002), Kitty in “The Hours” (2002) and Annie in “Hereditary.” Most recently she has played Kristin in “Mafia Mamma” and Margot Cleary-Lopez in “The Power” on Prime Video.

She becomes quite popular and wants to be Ruby’s friend. The thing is, mermaids were actually pretty power-hungry back in the warrior days of Agatha and Grandmamah. Annie Murphy is known for playing Alexis in “Schitt’s Creek.” She also recently starred in a “Black Mirror” episode “Joan Is Awful.”\n\nArthur Gillman (Colman Domingo)\n\nRuby’s dad Arthur Gillman makes soothing instructional videos of glass bottle boat creations.

He skateboards around and seems pretty easy-going, so of course Ruby has a crush on him.\n\nJaboukie Young-White is known for voicing Ethan Clade in “Strange World,” playing Fern in “C’mon C’mon,” Borat in “Rough Night” and Assistant Alex in “Set It Up.” He has also appeared in “Rap Sh!t,” “Black Mirror,” “Only Murders in the Building” and “Awkwafina is Nora from Queens.”\n\nMargot (Liza Koshy)\n\nMargot is Ruby’s best friend, and she drives a lot of the friend group’s social plans, including going to prom.\n\nLiza Koshy is known for playing Jasmine Hale in “Work It,” Aday in “Boo! A Madea Halloween” and voicing Arcee in “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts.” She also stars in “Liza on Demand.”\n\nBliss (Ramona Young)\n\nBliss is a goth gal who always catastrophizes, or imagines the worst-case scenario.\n\nRamona Young is most well-known for playing Eleanor Wong in “Never Have I Ever” on Netflix. She also portrays Ramona in “Santa Clarita Diet” and Mona Wu in “DC’s Legends of Tomorrow.”\n\nTrevin (Eduardo Franco)\n\nTrevin rounds out Ruby’s friend group.

He finds Ruby’s secret powers very cool.\n\nBlue Chapman is known for “Undone” and for playing JJ Perry in “Council of Dads.”\n\nGordon Lighthouse (Will Forte)\n\nGordon Lighthouse is the town soothsayer, who claims he has interacted with Krakens back in the day.
