Benjamin Karran will take on the role of Jason ‘J.D’ Dean beginning June 28.\n\nContinuing cast members include Ailsa Davidson as Veronica Sawyer, Simon Gordon as Jason ‘J.D’ Dean (Gordon plays his last performance June 26), Maddison Firth as Heather Chandler, Vivian Panka as Heather Duke, Mhairi Angus as Martha Dunnstock, Rory Phelan as Ram Sweeney, Vicki Lee Taylor as Ms. Fleming/Veronica’s Mom, May Tether as Drama Club Drama Queen, Bayley Hart as Stoner Chick, and Eleanor Morrison-Halliday as Young Republicanette.\n\nPerformances continue through September 4.\n\nWith a book, music, and lyrics by Kevin Murphy and Laurence O’Keefe, Heathers the Musical is based on the cult film starring Winona Ryder and Christian Slater. The musical is directed by Andy Fickman with choreography by Gary Lloyd, designs by David Shields, lighting by Ben Cracknell, sound by Dan Samson, and musical direction by Phil Cornwell.\n\nHeathers the Musical was a record-breaker at The Other Palace in 2018, before transferring to the Theatre Royal Haymarket for a limited season later that year. Last year, the production returned to the Haymarket in parallel with a U.K. tour, before returning to its original home at The Other Palace."
