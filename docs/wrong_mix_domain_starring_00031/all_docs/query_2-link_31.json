        "text": "Film Pitch\n\nFilm PitchMollieHabbershaw\n\nThis film pitch proposes a teen romance movie about a popular high school girl who breaks up with her boyfriend, one of the most popular boys in school. She turns to her geeky best friend for advice and comfort. Through flashbacks, it is revealed that the geeky friend has always had feelings for the girl but thought she wasn't his type. The girl comes to realize that personality is more important than looks, and she starts falling for her geeky friend. The film's message is that looks aren't everything and deeper qualities like personality are what really matter in a relationship. Inspiration is drawn from TV shows like 90210 and films like Geek Charming that follow a similar storyline.\n\nUnit 51 pr9 sourcing images completed\n\nUnit 51 pr9 sourcing images completedLydiaCharlotteCooke\n\nCopyright is a legal right that grants creators exclusive control over the use and distribution of their original works, usually for a limited time period.
