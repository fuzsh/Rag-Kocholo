        "text": "An English name, Jasmine, comes from the Old French, Arabic, and Persian word ‘yasamin,’ referring to the jasmine flower. It means “gift from God.” This delicate and aromatic flower bloomed in the jasmine plant, a source of exotic fragrance in warmer climates. The scented oils derived from the flower were used to make perfume throughout the Persian Empire.\n\nWhat Does Jasmine Mean?\n\nJasmine is an English feminine name from the Old Persian ‘yasamin,’ meaning ‘present’ or ‘offering.’ Yasmin is the name of the flowering plant of the olive genus. Exuding a heady and seductive scent that entices and delights the senses, this fragrant flower stands as a symbol of ‘elegance,’ ‘grace,’ and ‘love.’\n\nOrigin\n\nDerived from Persian origin, Jasmine entered the English language through Old French. The traditional name invokes an image of a small star-shaped white flower that suggests innocence and purity, which blossomed with the floral name fashion in the West around 1900 and remained a popular name for girls for a long time. Jasmine burst into popularity after the release of Disney’s Aladdin in 1992 featuring Princess Jasmine. It propagates a garden of spelling variations like Jazmin, Yasmin, Yasmine, and Jessamine that may be trendier options for the modern generation.\n\nGender\n\nFemale\n\nPronunciation\n\nJazz-min\n\nJaz-min (English)\n\nZhas-Meen (French)\n\nJ(a)s-min\n\nJas-mine\n\nSyllables\n\n2 syllable\n\nLength/Letter\n\n7 letters\n\nName Variations/Spellings\n\nJasmine name variations have the youthful and refined appeal as the original name.
