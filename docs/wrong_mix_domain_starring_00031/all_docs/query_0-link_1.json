However, you'll be surprised to know that most Disney Channel classics premiered almost a decade ago, and we're pretty curious to see the forgotten actors then and now!\n\nIf you really think about it, The Cheetah Girls be wouldn't be the same without Gabriella's gorgeous crush, Derek. And who can forget about Chelsea Barnes, the mean girl who made us all cringe in Princess Protection Program? These are just a few stars who went through shocking transformations over the years, but what's even more surprising is the fact that some decided to leave the spotlight for totally different careers.\n\nFor instance, one of your faves from High School Musical actually gave up acting to study architecture. And someone from Halloweentown is now a successful karate instructor (yes, you read that right). Can you imagine how cool it would be to get karate lessons from your favorite Disney movie character?!\n\nIt just goes to show that not all Disney Channel alums are guaranteed to stay in the acting business. However, it's always exciting to see how much they've evolved since then!\n\nClick through the gallery to see then-and-now photos of characters from your favorite DCOMs!\n\nGET MORE:\n\n14 Shocking Then-and-Now Photos of Your Fave DCOM Nerds\n\n8 Disney Channel Original Movie Guys Who Now Have Kids of Their Own"
