        "text": "Jasmine Origin and Meaning\n\nThe name Jasmine is a girl's name of Persian origin meaning \"gift from God\".\n\nJasmine was derived from the Persian word yasmin, referring to the jasmine flower. Scented oil was made from the plant, and it was used as a perfume throughout the Persian Empire. Variants include Jazmin, Yasmin, Yasmine, and Jessamine.\n\nJasmine, a delicate and aromatic flower name, burst into popularity after the 1992 release of Disney's Aladdin, featuring Princess Jasmineâ€”highly unusual then for an animated character. Propagating a garden of spelling variations, Jasmine remained solidly in the Top 50 until 2009, when it started to wilt.\n\nJasmine was first used as a flower name in the West around 1900, during the blossoming of floral-name fashion."
