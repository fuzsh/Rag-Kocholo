        "text": "Emily Atack\n\nThe Inbetweeners alum and comedian Emily Atack revealed that she’s expecting her first child! She shared the news on her Instagram with the caption reading, “Hello Everyone, it’s been a little while but I’m back with some news. I’m delighted to share with you all that we’re having a baby!! I’ve never been so happy and utterly terrified at the same time. Please go easy on me ❤️ Every day is mixed with thrill, fear, joy, hysteria, topped off with a lot of vomiting – a bit like when you’ve just stepped off of the Oblivion at Alton Towers on a hangover. I’ve got to know my body on such an insane level. It’s made me appreciate the one I’ve been given SO much, I’m doing my absolute best to make it a home for the little squid I’m growing. We can already sense the baby is reclined on a mattress of peanut butter and jam sandwiches in there, demanding more chocolate buttons. I’m so happy to be writing all of this to you all. You’ve always stuck by me through the years, do stick around to watch me enter my mum era. Christ. Let’s go.”\n\nKane Brown & Katelyn Brown\n\nKane Brown and wife Katelyn Brown had a special gift to share with the world on Christmas 2023. They’re expecting Baby No. 3! The Browns posted a sweet photo on Instagram with them and their young daughters — Kingsley Rose and Kodi Jane — all snuggled up on the couch in front of their tree. Kingsley proudly holds up a sonogram photo.\n\n“Last Christmas of 4 🎄❤️ Merry Christmas everyone!!,” the “Bury Me in Georgia” singer captioned the joint post.\n\nFellow country music stars were quick to offer their congratulations in the comments. “AHHH congrats!!!!!” Maddie Marlow said. “🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌” Jessie James Decker commented. “Screaming for yall!!! Congrats!!!” Priscilla Block added\n\nMia Swier & Darren Criss\n\nGlee alum Darren Criss announced that he and wife Mia Swier are expecting Baby No. 2 in what one follower called “the most incredible pregnancy announcement ever.”\n\nCriss posted a photoshopped version of the Mamma Mia!

She also shared how hard it was to force herself to smile while reporting live after getting calls from doctors with bad news.\n\n“Maybe this is the thing that people don’t talk about enough: IVF, while widely used, can still feel like a lonely, all-encompassing hell when you’re in the middle of it,” she said. “…As I think about the road I’ve traveled, I’m profoundly grateful to have an employer that offset the cost of this fertility ordeal. I’m aware of how many women don’t have that option and won’t be able to access healthcare that helps make their dreams come true.

I was overjoyed, in tears, I couldn’t believe that it had finally happened again.”\n\nJessica & Clay Walker\n\nClay Walker announced via press release in early April that he and his wife, Jessica, are expecting their sixth child this fall — a little girl. Tragically, the couple then announced two weeks later that they suffered a miscarriage.\n\n“The whole family had been waiting for the baby and it was really, just a huge blow,” Walker told PEOPLE. “We had her room ready, her clothes bought — everything, and her name, Eleanora Lindsey. So, it was a nightmare and still is for my wife. We were at 20 weeks, and we’d already made it through the toughest part. We’ve had five successful full-term pregnancies and five beautiful children. It’s tough.”\n\nThe couple shares Christiaan, 2, Ezra, 5, Elijah 10, Mary-Elizabeth, 13, and William, 14.

I felt like, because I didn’t get pregnant earlier on, then it just wasn’t going to happen for me.”\n\nThe couple’s fertility journey started in Feb. 2022.

Which is that he’s about to get a brother or sister,” he said. “I’m not sure he’s quite conceptually understood it just yet. We’re trying to get him ready for it.

And it’s not just that,” she said. “We all have that resentment at times and anxiety about being trapped by the role, that responsibility. And then chemically it can run riot. And there’s no ‘off’ button. That was the hardest adjustment. You always feel beholden to somebody. And for so long [kids are] like koala bears; you just feel a physical responsibility to be there for them to cling to. It’s pretty primal.”\n\nChrissy Teigen & John Legend\n\nChrissy Teigen and John Legend brought the world to tears with the news that they’re expecting another child! Teigen took to Instagram to share the incredible news, posting two photos of her growing baby bump captioned, “The last few years have been a blur of emotions to say the least, but joy has filled our home and hearts again.”\n\nThe model and entertainment personality continued, “1 billion shots later (in the leg lately, as u can see!) we have another on the way. Every appointment I’ve said to myself, ‘ok if it’s healthy today I’ll announce’ but then I breathe a sigh of relief to hear a heartbeat and decide I’m just too nervous still.”\n\n“I don’t think I’ll ever walk out of an appointment with more excitement than nerves but so far, everything is perfect and beautiful and I’m feeling hopeful and amazing,” she shared, virtually exclaiming, “Ok phew it’s been very hard keeping this in for so long!”\n\nThe married couple also shares a daughter, Luna, and two sons, Miles and Jack. Jack tragically passed away in September 2020, with Teigen suffering a stillbirth — a journey she vulnerably and powerfully shared with the world."
