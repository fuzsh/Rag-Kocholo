        "text": "Bianca\n\nItalian\n\n\"white\"\n\nBianca Origin and Meaning\n\nThe name Bianca is a girl's name of Italian origin meaning \"white\".\n\nBianca, the livelier Italian and Shakespearean version of Blanche, has been chosen by many American parents since the 1990s, just as Blanca is a favorite in the Spanish-speaking community. Its meaning of white relates to snow, making it one of the prime names for winter babies.\n\nMiss Bianca was an elegant mouse (voiced by Eva Gabor) in Disney's 1977 The Rescuers, and Bianca features as a character in two Shakespeare plays, Othello and The Taming of the Shrew, not to mention its musical offshoot, Kiss Me Kate.\n\nBianca was brought to prominence here by the first Mrs. Mick Jagger. Her name entered the U.S. popularity ranks in 1973, reaching a high of Number 84 in 1990. Bianca was chosen for her daughter by actress Tia Carrere.\n\n# 464 in the US\n\nBianca Rank in US Top 1000\n\n# 250 on Nameberry\n\nBianca Rank in Nameberry Top 1000\n\nBianca Popularity\n\n464US2023\n\n250Nameberry2024\n\n450England2021\n\n436Germany2016\n\n15Italy2022\n\n25Portugal2020\n\n90Sweden2021\n\n170Switzerland2022\n\n16Argentina2021\n\n84Chile2021\n\nFamous People Named Bianca\n\nBianca del Rio(Roy Haylock) American Drag Performer and Costume Designer, Winner of RuPaul’s Drag Race Season Six.\n\nBianca AmbrosioAmerican actress; twin sister of Chiara Ambrosio\n\nBianca AndreescuCanadian tennis player\n\nBianca BaltiItalian supermodel\n\nBianca Brandolini d'Adda (b. 1987)French,Italian model, actress and socialite\n\nBianca ButlerAmerican figure skater\n\nBianca Suzanne CollinsAmerican actress\n\nBianca ComparatoBrazilian actress\n\nBianca Jasmine LawsonAmerican actress\n\nBianca Taylor RyanAmerican singer,songwriter\n\nBianca Maria KajlichAmerican actress\n\nBianca KnightAmerican Olympic sprinter\n\nBianca (PérezMora Macias) Jagger, Nicaraguan actress and activist; ex,wife of musician Mick Jagger\n\nBianca Monica Malasmas GonzalezFilipina TV presenter\n\nBianca ShomburgGerman pop singer\n\nBianca Del Riostage name of Roy Haylock, American drag queen of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\"\n\nBianca Johanna Evansdaughter of singer Chubby Checker\n\nBianca Brigitte Van Damme (b. 1990)daughter of actor Jean,Claude Van Damme and bodybuilder Gladys Portugues\n\nBianca Nobilodaughter of golfer Frank Nobilo\n\nBianca Wakelin (b. 2005)daughter of actress Tia Carrere and photographer Simon Wakelin\n\nBianca Jooyung Kang (b. 2009)daughter of actors Tim Kang and Gina Marie May\n\nBianca Roxy Weyler (b. 2012)daughter of drummer Javier Weyler of Stereophonics\n\nBianca Toni (b. 2013)daughter of footballer Luca Toni and model Marta Cecchetto\n\nBianca Willow Nestor (b. 2013)daughter of tennis player Daniel Nestor\n\nBianca Ingrossodaughter of Swedish singer Pernilla Wahlgren and dancer Emilio Ingrosso.\n\nWillow Bianca Faye Palindaughter of U.S. politician Sarah Palin\n\nBianca Moreno HenningerMexican,American soccer player\n\nBianca RichardsAustralian Model\n\nBianca St GeorgesCanadian soccer player"
