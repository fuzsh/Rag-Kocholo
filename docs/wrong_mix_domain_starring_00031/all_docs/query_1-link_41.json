        "text": "After eight years, it looks like Claudia Jordan has hopes of returning to ‘The Real Housewives of Atlanta.’\n\nDuring a recent red-carpet interview, Claudia Jordan opened up about her time on the reality series, noting that it was a “great experience.”\n\n“I don’t watch Housewives anymore. Once I wasn’t on the show I watched it two more times. Some people go on there and they make it their entire life. It was a great experience and I still get love to this day, and I would definitely go back.”\n\nThe talk show host then clarified that no one from the network has contacted her or offered a contract “as of late” but she is “here for the coin” if the opportunity presented itself.\n\nIn the meantime, Claudia Jordan is staying booked and busy!\n\nShe shared,\n\n“I’ve done so many other things, and I’m really loving my time kind of popping in and out of The Breakfast Club in New York, films, producing and I wrote a stage play.”\n\nThe former reality TV star was a main cast member on “RHOA” during season 7 back in 2014. She also made brief appearances during Seasons 8 and 13.\n\nLast year, the 50-year-old actress revealed the real reason why she left the show. When asked by a fan on Instagram, Jordan explained,\n\n“Didn’t want to come back as a friend of the show and that was my only option if I wasn’t going to share my relationship on the show. At the time the guy I was seeing had too much to lose going on there (super successful and known but I kept it very private like usual) and good thing we didn’t go public on the show. Turns out he was not the most honest. I woulda been humiliated!”\n\nSince her departure from the hit Bravo show, Claudia Jordan has stayed in the spotlight.\n\nAside from acting and producing, she is currently a talk show host on “Cocktails With Queens” and “Tea-G-I-F,” both airing on Fox Soul. She is also a recurring guest host on “The Breakfast Club.”\n\nThe Real Housewives of Atlanta is currently on its 15th season! The cast includes Kandi Burruss, Kenya Moore, Drew Sidora, Marlo Hampton, Sheree Whitfield, and Sanya Richards-Ross.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Would you like to see Claudia Jordan back on RHOA?
