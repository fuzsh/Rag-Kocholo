        "text": "Coronation Street have seemingly teased who will finally catch evil Joel Deering out.\n\nFans will know Joel has targeted and attacked Lauren, who is actually pregnant with his child, and had caused her to flee Weatherfield. Whilst the viewers are aware he was responsible, the residents of the Cobbles have no idea she is actually alive.\n\nHowever, the police investigate tonight after Roy admits he saw her at his hospital bed, and a hospital worker later confirmed a young lady with blonde hair came to visit Roy. As Joel panicked about the news that Lauren had been seen, and the others knew she was alive, he started to panic and rushed off, with the excuse he needed to go to a meeting.\n\nIn tonight's episode, Evelyn caught Joel outside the precinct as he struggled to cope with the information that everyone else knew Lauren was alive. When she saw him, she knocked on the car window and he wound it down as she said: \"I thought it was you! Are you alright? You sure about that, only - I mean no offence meant - but you look absolutely shocking.\"\n\nTrying to explain away his scratched face, he told her: \"A slightly unhinged ex client scratched me. Listen, I’ve got a migraine - I get them sometimes,\" as Evelyn suggested he headed home. She told him: \"Well if I was you, I’d go home, take a couple of headache pills and maybe think about having a different career,\" before he agreed and went to head off.\n\nCould Evelyn be the one to finally expose Joel? Will she tell Dee-Dee about seeing him at the precinct when he was meant to be in a meeting? Will the truth finally be revealed if she gets suspicious?\n\nLast month, Calum opened up about why Joel targeted Lauren, but treats Dee-Dee with so much respect.\n\nSpeaking about why Joel acts the way he does, he said: \"He is very messed up, he sees women in two ways. He has these women he adores and puts on a pedestal like Dee-Dee and then there are the other women, the young girls that he sees as lesser in some way in his eyes and takes his hatred for women out on them. When he sees these vulnerable young women probably from broken homes, with criminal records and no one looking out for them he is like a shark he hones in on them, coercively controls them and emotionally manipulates them using his power and money.\n\n\"If you were to sit down and try and ask him why he did it he would justify it as just helping them. When no one else would. It is a repetitive pattern of behaviour, he engages with these young girls and afterwards there is the element of guilt so he tries to be a good person and be better towards Dee-Dee. Then the guilt wears off and he needs another ‘fix’, he has a euphoria/guilt cycle. It is a pattern of destructive behaviour. And we will see in the coming weeks that he is still doing it.\""
