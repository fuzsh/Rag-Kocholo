        "text": "Sex, Drugs, Car Chases – It’s Not High School, It’s ’21 Jump Street’\n\n21 Jump Street : 4 out of 5 Jenko: Always one strap it. Always So anyone that was hoping for the dark and gritty reboot of the 80s undercover cop drama 21 Jump Street in the same way that Michael Mann rebooted Miami Vice , they will be disappointed with what has actually been made. Instead, this is a delightfully funny and wild take on that material, which is like a crack-addicted blend between John Hughes and Lethal Weapon . This new take on 21 Jump Street maintains the same basic premise of assigning cops to undercover roles as high school kids, but ups the raunchy factor significantly. The film is at times crude, but also a lot cleverer and more self aware than one would expect. It is entertaining in a wonderfully over-the-top sort of way, with Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum making for a great comedic team.\n\nOut Now Bonus: Aaron And His Mom Discuss ‘The Babadook’\n\nThis bonus episode of Out Now with Aaron and Abe is a real treat. Aaron’s mother, Denise, returns to the podcast! She has recently seen the acclaimed Australian horror film The Babadook’ and really wanted to talk to Aaron about it, so here they are discussing the film in full. Keep in mind that this is a full-spoilers discussion of the film, so be sure to check out The Babadook , which is now available to rent or own and is currently streaming on Netflix.

Heather: Just the address. Starting this year out on the right foot, the latest entry in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise manages to put Hollywood in a position to go nowhere but up. I do enjoy my share of horror films and was happy to enter into this film with an open mind, but man is it terrible. Given my love for the original film and my general fondness for the second, the idea of a film billed as a direct continuation of the original entry written and directed by Tobe Hooper was slightly intriguing. Even in a post- Cabin in the Woods world, where horror movies can be boiled down to words on a dry erase board, I went for it. The results were not good. Texas Chainsaw 3D is not just a bad film, it is an idiotic one that literally cannot do basic math. Read on to find out why.\n\nThe Homesman Is Surreal, Grim Stuff (Movie Review)\n\nThe Homesman : 3 out of 5 Marry Bee Cuddy: Come on, girls. How grim is too grim and when does it just start becoming a little humorous? Earlier this year we had a novel idea for a film in the form of A Million Ways to Die in the West . That film did not work for me overall, but the idea of making a western film that put emphasis on how terrible a time it could really be was a funny one. Tommy Lee Jones’ second directorial effort, The Homesman , based on the novel by Glendon Swarthout, is a film that sits in grim territory, but pushes things so far that it becomes a strange sort of dark comedy. The film has a large cast of great actors, but they all provide merely decent to good performances. Hilary Swank stands out, but that makes sense, given that she does most of the heavy-lifting, with strong support from Jones to back her up. Really, the film seems confused by how sprawling it could be versus how effectively poignant it may be if the film felt a bit more consiste"
