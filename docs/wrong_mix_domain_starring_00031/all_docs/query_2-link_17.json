        "text": "With yet another award going to an Illinois-born actress last night at the Emmys, I figured it was time to do a bit of research.\n\nJust about every year, when award season comes around, which by the way we're on the cusp of, someone from Illinois scoops up an award.\n\nWhether it be Rachel Brosnahan, she's born in Wisconsin but grew up in Illinois, scoring an award for The Marvelous Ms. Maisel, or like last night native Chicagoan, Gillian Anderson scoring her second Emmy in a supporting role for Netflix's hit show The Crown.\n\nSo it got me thinking, there's plenty of great actresses who were born in Illinois who have gone on to score some major hardware and star in some serious box office blockbusters.\n\nHollywood legends like Raquel Welch and Betty White got their start in Illinois. Oscar winners like Frances McDormand and Jennifer Hudson were both born in the Land of Lincoln too.\n\nThere were some surprises too like I had no idea Welch was from Chicago, and Calista Flockhart from Ally McBeal was born in Freeport.\n\nFor some reason, I always knew about Joan Allen being from Rochelle, but for some, that's kind of a surprise.\n\nI was most surprised though when I found out Cecily Strong from Saturday Night Live was born in Illinois, she grew up in Springfield.\n\nSpeaking of growing up in the middle of the state, did you know Jennie Garth from Beverly Hills 90210 wasn't actually born in California? Nope, she grew up in Urbana, Illinois.\n\nCheck out the full list:"
