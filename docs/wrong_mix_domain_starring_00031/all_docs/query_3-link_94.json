        "text": "MANILA, Philippines — Vice Ganda and Vic Sotto are returning to the Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF) this year, with their respective films included in the first five entries of the annual filmfest's 50th edition in December.\n\nThe first batch of official entries was announced yesterday at the grand launch graced by First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos at the Bulwagang Villegas at the Manila City Hall.\n\nIt was revealed that a total of 39 scripts were submitted to the MMFF selection committee headed by veteran actress Boots Anson-Roa Rodrigo.\n\n“It was very challenging,” revealed Boots. “We received a total of 39 scripts with an average of 100 pages. “And you have to read through all of them carefully. But it’s so comforting and so heartwarming to know that 39 producers took interest and went through the trouble of filing for the entry, knowing that only four — and now five — would be chosen.\n\n“We’re grateful for their confidence and interest in the industry,” said the MOWELFUND chairperson.\n\nOn the other hand, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) chair, lawyer Romando Artes, who led the ceremonies, described the big number of submissions as a “happy problem.” He said they were not just “star-studded,” they also featured heavyweight directors and scriptwriters. Only five, however, had to be selected based on the scripts.\n\nOne of the first entries announced was the Vice comedy “And the Breadwinner is” directed by Jun Robles Lana and produced by ABS-CBN Film Productions, Inc. and The IdeaFirst Company. It also stars Eugene Domingo, Gina Pareno, Jhong Hilario, Maris Racal and Kokoy De Santos.\n\nVic Sotto is also set to return to the MMFF opposite Piolo Pascual via “The Kingdom,” an action-adventure family drama directed by Michael Tuviera. Producers are ATP/Mzet and MediaQuest. They are joined by Sue Ramirez and Cristine Reyes.\n\nAlso part of the first five entries are “Green Bones” from the makers of the MMFF 2023 Best Picture “Firefly.” Directed by Zig Dulay and co-written by National Artist for Film Ricky Lee and Angeli Atienza (MMFF 2023 Best Screenplay winner), the suspense drama is going to be produced by GMA Pictures.\n\nThe horror entry in the initial lineup is “Strange Frequencies: Haunted Hospital,” to be directed by Kerwin Go and topbilled by Enrique Gil, Rob Gomez, Jane De Leon, Alexa Miro, and MJ Lastimosa. Dondon Monteverde and Erik Matti’s Reality MM Studios, Inc., is the film’s producer.\n\nAdding to the variety of the entries is “Himala” the musical to be directed by “GomBurZa” director Pepe Diokno and produced by Kapitol Films/Unitel. Main cast members are Bituin Escalante and Aicelle Santos.\n\nArtes is confident in how the choices so far of the selection committee will step up anticipation for the 50th-anniversary edition of the MMFF.\n\n“We can’t say we’re pressured, but we’re elevating the bar, not just the quality of the films but also the box-office (performance),” Artes said.\n\n“We’re expecting this 50th will be a catalyst to re-energize Philippine cinema. We’re hoping to be able to bring back the audiences of the last edition and we hope there will be more (viewers) with the movies that we’re going to offer.”\n\nThe last batch of entries will be chosen among the finished films to be submitted on or before Sept. 30, according to MMDA.\n\nWith the theme “Sinesigla” for its 50th year, the annual MMFF opens traditionally on Christmas Day, Dec. 25."
