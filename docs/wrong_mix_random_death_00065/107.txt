“Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.” —Steve Jobs, Stanford commencement speech

From the start, his path was never predictable. Steve Jobs was given up for adoption at birth, he dropped out of college after one semester, and at the age of twenty-one, he created Apple in his parents' garage with his friend Steve Wozniack. Quickly rising to the top of the computer industry, Jobs pushed all boundaries and cultivated what became the intrinsic hallmark of his genius—his perfectionism, taste, and design style. But soon after success, Jobs was fired from the top spot of his own company. Finding himself a beginner again, Jobs entered into one of the most creative periods of his life. Through Pixar, the iPod, and the iPhone, Jobs revolutionized the major industries of movies, music, and phones. An avid seeker of disciplines of the mind and body, he battled cancer for eight years, became the ultimate CEO, and made the world want just about every product he touched.

Critically acclaimed author Karen Blumenthal takes us to the core of this complicated and legendary man while simultaneously exploring the evolution of computers. Illustrated throughout with black-and-white photos, this is the story of a man who changed our world.
