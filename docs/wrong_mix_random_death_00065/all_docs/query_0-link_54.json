        "text": "Applications for the 2024 Al Neuharth Free Spirit and Journalism Conference are no longer being accepted.\n\nInformation about the 2025 conference will be posted in October. Contact us at [email protected] if you would like to be notified.\n\nAbout\n\nThe annual Al Neuharth Free Spirit and Journalism Conference for high school juniors returns to the nation’s capital June 22-27, 2024. The Freedom Forum is pleased to welcome students to a week of activities including panels with top journalists and visits to the U.S. Capitol and other landmarks in Washington, D.C.\n\nStudents selected for the program receive an all-expenses-paid trip and a $1,000 scholarship to the college of their choice.\n\nThe program was established in 1999 to honor Al Neuharth, founder of The Freedom Forum and USA TODAY. The conference is designed to inspire and encourage students to pursue journalism. Today there are more than 1,500 “Free Spirits” including journalists working for The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Baltimore Sun, ESPN and network-affiliated TV stations.\n\nFree Spirits have been described as people who “dream, dare, do.” Those are words that conference participants demonstrate each day, and they are the program’s motto.\n\n“A free spirit can also be a risk-taker, a visionary, an innovative leader, or a courageous achiever who accomplishes great things beyond his or her circumstances,” said Neuharth, who died in 2013.\n\nTestimonials\n\nTaylor McGraw – Class of 2008\n\nExecutive Director and Co-Founder of The Bell\n\n“I'm not exaggerating to say that the Free Spirit conference changed the trajectory of my life. It led to my first professional journalism internship and, even more importantly, taught me the importance of young people from different backgrounds coming together to share their stories. It's no coincidence that I now lead a nonprofit that trains and supports high school journalists.”\n\nAbha Bhattarai – Class of 2004\n\nEconomics Correspondent at The Washington Post\n\n\"The Free Spirit conference showed me what was possible in journalism. It was my first glimpse into the world of real-life reporters and confirmed that my passions — uncovering stories, talking with people, and writing — could become a career. The week in Washington, D.C. was exhilarating, and I left feeling certain that I wanted to be a journalist.”\n\nDerrell Bouknight – Class of 2014\n\nAssociate News Producer at CBS Sports and CBS Sports Network\n\n\"The Free Spirit conference was a transformative experience, one that laid the foundation for my life as a broadcast journalist. Al Neuharth's mantra of “dream, dare, do” has encouraged me to take risks while propelling my storytelling in a way that highlights individuals from different walks of life throughout the country. The conference, and the 50 friends I made along the way, remains an integral part of my life.”\n\nAimee Cho – Class of 2012\n\nGeneral assignment reporter at NBC Washington\n\n“The Free Spirit program was truly an incredible, life changing experience. I met so many wonderful friends and speakers, and it confirmed for me that I wanted to pursue journalism.”\n\nHow to Apply\n\nTo apply for the Al Neuharth Free Spirit and Journalism Conference, you’ll complete the online application form (including information about you, your school and your academic, student media and extracurricular activities) and upload the required materials.
