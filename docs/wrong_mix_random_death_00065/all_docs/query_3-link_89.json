        "text": "On January 24, 1984, Steve Jobs demonstrated the original Macintosh for the first time at an Apple shareholders meeting in Cupertino. You've probably seen a video of the presentation; it's the one where Jobs is introduced by a joke-telling Mac.\n\nBut what many people don't know is that the Apple co-founder gave another presentation for the computer less than a week later at a meeting of the Boston Computer Society. And that presentation has remained largely unseen until this weekend...\n\nAaron Sorkin has reportedly completed his screenplay for the highly-anticipated Steve Jobs biopic and submitted it to Sony. It was first announced that Sorkin would be working on the project back in the spring of 2012, but we've heard little of his progress since then.\n\nThe fact that he's finished the script is good news though, and should appease observers who have been looking forward to the flick. Needless to say, both Sony and movie-goers alike are hoping Sorkin can drum up the same kind of magic he did with The Social Network...\n\nIt's hard to believe, but it was 7 years ago today that Steve Jobs took the stage at the Moscone Center in San Francisco to give what would become one of the most remarkable keynotes of his career. It was January 9, 2007, the day that Apple reinvented the phone.\n\nFew people in attendance could have realized the significance of what Jobs would be introducing that day. It was a new product that would not only put Apple on track to become the most valuable company in the world, but it would also revolutionize an entire industry...\n\nFor those of you who were unable to see it in theaters, Ashton Kutcher's much talked about 'Jobs' film is now available for purchase. You can either buy it or rent it in iTunes, and then of course it's available in Blu-Ray and DVD as well.\n\nAfter months of rumors and a lengthy delay, 'Jobs' opened to mixed reviews on August 16. It stayed in theaters for just 7 weeks, and only pulled $35 million worldwide. It was considered by many to be a flop, but now you can be the critic...\n\nIt's been a big week for Apple-related book releases, with two major titles hitting the shelves: Dogfight: How Apple And Google Went To War And Started a Revolution and Jony Ive: The Genius Behind Apple’s Greatest Products.\n\nThe latter is a full-length biography on Ive, Apple's senior vice president of design. And if you've been thinking about picking it up, you'll be interested to know that you can snag it at a nice discount in this two-book combo deal...\n\nI clearly remember September 2008 when the HTC G1 debuted in partnership with Google and T-Mobile. Google's first usable Android-driven handset arrived some fifteen months after the iPhone had gone on sale in June 2007 and tech die-hards were startled that it didn't incorporate the pinch-zoom gesture.\n\nAndroid would be deployed across lots more handsets before eventually implementing not only pinch-zooming, but other familiar iPhone features as well. There was an unconfirmed rumor at the time that Google removed multitouch gestures from initial Android builds at Apple's request.\n\nIn all honesty, the notion seemed a bit crazy. Why would Google take the iPhone head on and yet cave in to Apple's demands? According to a new 272-page book titled Dogfight: How Apple And Google Went To War And Started a Revolution by Fred Vogelstein, Apple's then CEO Steve Jobs imposed that choice on Google's Android head Andy Rubin by sheer willpower...\n\nThe house in Palo Alto where Apple's late co-founder Steve Jobs spent much of his childhood years since the seventh grade has now become a protected historic site, according to a report Tuesday by the San Jose Mercury News. The house is also famous for the fact that Steve along with his sidekick Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple and built the first hundred Apple 1 computers there.\n\nThe Los Altos Historical Commission voted unanimously to add the ranch-style property at 2066 Crist Drive in Los Altos, California to its list of historic resources due to its association with Apple's charismatic leader and famous inventor...\n\nDisney is after your kids' tablets. The entertainment megalith will unveil a cartoon spaghetti western series on tablets before cable. 'Sheriff Callie West,' a female animated character (pictured top of post) the Mickey Mouse house hopes will become the next Hello Kitty merchandising bonanza, will be unveiled on the Watch Disney Junior app November 24.\n\nThe series will then appear later in 2014 on cable's Disney Junior. The move is a recognition that children increasingly are turning to the iPad and other tablets for entertainment. Both Disney and Apple have deep ties. Not only is the entertainment giant's CEO Bob Iger on Apple's board of directors, but the Steve Jobs trust has a large stake in Disney...\n\nIn a case of good timing, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has reconfirmed a multitouch patent credited to Apple's late co-founder Steve Jobs and the original iPhone design.\n\nOn the sixth anniversary of the iconic smartphone, the U.S. government reaffirmed the massive patent that was called into question in 2012.\n\nJobs was among the more than two-dozen people named in the massive 364-page patent filed in 2006.\n\nThe USPTO had issed a preliminary invalidation of the patent package, but now believes all 20 patents are valid...\n\nToday marks the two year anniversary of Steve Jobs' passing. I will forever remember where I was and what I was doing when I heard the news. Just like his life changed my life, so did his death, and if you're reading this site on a regular basis, I'll assume that you're feeling the same way.\n\nSteve Jobs could be called many things, but to me he'll always be a rebel, a man who's been part of more technological revolutions than anybody in this world. A man who wasn't afraid of saying \"no\" when saying yes could have been so much easier. A man, who inspired many people and changed so even more lives.\n\nOn this day, let's take a minute to remember Steve and read this quote from him. It's deep. It's sincere. And it's real.\n\nNo one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don’t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.\n\nThank you for everything, Steve."
