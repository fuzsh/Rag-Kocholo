        "text": "Joe & Diane- 8.3.24\n\nThe music of Joe and Diane is a refreshing reminder of the quality and richness of true, traditional country music! Joe and Diane have been singing and performing together as Nashville’s newest duet team!\n\nJoe Wade Smith is originally from West Virginia and was raised in Maryland. His music background started when he was a teenager sitting around at family reunions and get-togethers picking and singing with his uncles and cousins. He won several singing competitions through the years in Maryland, with one landing him a spot on The Nashville Network’s “You Can Be A Star”. He moved to Tennessee in the beginning of 2013 and has a large fan base that includes people from all around the world.\n\nDiane Berry was born into a musical family and grew up in a little town in Arkansas. She moved to Nashville in the early ‘80’s playing guitar singing in one of the shows in Opryland Park. That fall, Roy Acuff asked her to be his guest on the Grand Ole’ Opry and after that performance, Diane worked the Grand Ole’ Opry for twenty eight years with different artists such as: Jeannie Seely, Johnny Russell, Grandpa Jones, Jan Howard, Skeeter Davis, Jim Ed Brown, Charlie Louvin and Johnny Counterfit. Diane is also an accomplished songwriter. Connie Smith recorded the gospel song “Take My Hand” on her last album that Diane wrote to honor her mother.\n\nSinging together just felt right….so, they started doing shows together as a duet and are seeing wonderful success. They have a new album of songs like, “Would You Love Me”, “We Never Had It Easy But We Always Had It Good”which got them nominated for Vocal Group of the Year for the 2021 Arkansas Country Music Awards and also for Traditional Country Music along with Music Event of the Year for the Josie Awards (an Independent Awards Show). The year of 2022 turned out to be a banner year for Joe and Diane. With the song, “Yours”, they won “Song of The Year” at the Arkansas Country Music Awards along with winning “Vocal Event of the Year” at the Josie Awards!

They have played festivals and car shows in Litchfield IL, Cuba, Springfield & Joplin MO, Galena KS, Afton and Clinton OK and Amarillo TX. This August they will play the International Rt. 66 Festival in Kingman AZ. They have even done a few unplugged, sometimes impromptu, tour of smaller venues that included stops at places like Afton Station in Afton, OK and The Rock Café in Stroud, OK. The group was recently honored with the inaugural “Bobby Troup Artistic Acheivement Award” by the International Route 66 Association in recognition of their album, Songs from the Mother Road.\n\nThe Road Crew’s album, Songs from the Mother Road, is really a group of stories about the struggles, the joys, the heartbreaks and the adventures associated with Route 66. The musical styles include folk, country, blues, western swing and even a touch of surfer pop. The 12 original song titles include We’re Going West, Chair Of Rocks Park, The Motherland OK, Tucumcari Tonite, Running Down The Mother Road, The Old Way (For Angel) and That Ol’ 66. In tribute to the late Bobby Troop, The Road Crew even adds their (Beatles inspired) flavor to his classic hit (Get Your Kicks On) Route 66 as a special bonus track.\n\nThe group introduced their second CD, Rock-A-Billy Road, an album comprised of mostly upbeat 1950s classic songs that served as a soundtrack for travelers breezing down the highway during the heyday of Route 66. The album includes the theme song for the International Route 66 Association Festival, The Road To Amarillo, composed by Joe and Don.\n\nIf you run into them along the road, just know that you are meeting four guys who love the road, love the people and love the places they sing about just as much as you do.

Growing up, the Nashville skyline was a regular commodity to David, as well as country music, but it wasn’t until later in life that he realized that he discovered his talent and passion for music artistry.

Also, David’s uncle-in-law is renound songwriter Sanger D. “Whitey” Shafer, who pinned such hits as All My Exes Live in Texas and much more.

Some of his biggest musical influences include Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, George Jones, Alan Jackson, Billy Currington as well as modern art acts like, Jack White and the White Stripes,\n\nNirvana, Alice in Chains and the Gorillaz.\n\nDavid started his professional musical journey at the world famous Tootsie’s Orchid Lounge.

Woody’s father also instilled in him a deep love and knowledge for all music, which brought him to Nashville, Tennessee at age 22. Shortly after, he met his now partner, Kennedy Scott, in front of the renowned Ryman Auditorium.\n\nSimilar to Woody, Clayton, North Carolina native Kennedy Scott, learned to sing at an early age thanks to her papa who introduced her to artists like Emmylou Harris, Allison Krauss, and The Everly Brothers. The musical tradition in her family extends to many other relatives; including her father who builds her guitars.\n\nThe duo first sang together for a YouTube video of “We Must Have Been Out Of Our Minds,” written by the great Melba Montgomery and sang with country icon George Jones. The video instantly got over 100,000 views. Woody and Kennedy knew right away they wanted to write and record music together.

Jody Payne had just retired from 36 years as the lead guitar player for Willie Nelson and became fascinated with the skinny youngster about whom he told others, “reminds me of me.”\n\nSeveral years after Jody’s passing, another Nashville legend took an interest in the young artist. Songwriter Jimmy Yeary—with CMA and ACM Song of the Year Awards—began to mentor Austin regarding all aspects of his career. Currently, the two even do corporate events together—speaking, playing, and singing— demonstrating to business people the purpose and power of mentoring.\n\nAustin has become known as one of a handful of artists to whom audiences listen intently. His songwriting—lyrics and music—combine the influences of Jason Isbell, Shakey Graves, Merle Haggard, Sturgill Simpson, and Jimmy Yeary. Mix in a bit of John Prine with some of his original material and you might just have a picture of Austin Gray.\n\naustingraymusic.com\n\nShow at 7:30 pm, no cover, tips appreciated, BOOK ONLINE or call 865-285-0155 for dinner reservations.\n\nWe don’t want y’all to miss out on the music, so when booking your online reservation for a show, please be sure to select the correct date for the show you are wanting to attend.

Some of his biggest musical influences include Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, George Jones, Alan Jackson, Billy Currington as well as modern art acts like, Jack White and the White Stripes,\n\nNirvana, Alice in Chains and the Gorillaz.\n\nDavid started his professional musical journey at the world famous Tootsie’s Orchid Lounge.

For the album, he will be joined by rock-and-roll hall of fame drummer, Steve Ferrone, who was the main drummer for Tom Petty and the Heart Breakers for over 30 years, and one of the most recorded drummers in history.\n\nDavid also plays in full bands at The Mellow Mushroom in Nashville, TN and has a weekly Wednesday night slot at margaritaville.\n\nOff the stage David is a hard working family man with a loving wife and 2 beautiful children.\n\nMusic is more than a hobby to David.

After years touring North America and recording as a bassist with punk & metal bands like Spawner Record’s Huskavarna, and Texas thrash legends Speedealer, Jay came full circle and returned to his roots in country.\n\nJay writes and sings songs for fans of real county music and is often compared to artists like Jerry Jeff Walker, Robert Earl Keen and John Prine. Jay's on tour in 2024 promoting his latest album Road Ready produced by five time Grammy nominee Denny Knight (Waylon Jennings, Conway Twitty) of the Nashville Music Group. Reaching #3 on the Alt-Country Specialty Charts with Road Ready, Jay has radio and PR support for his tour.\n\nWhether backed by a full band or stripped down with just his guitar, his live show feels like a party. You'll laugh and sing and dance and go home feeling that you've made a new friend. Jay can't wait to share a song and a beer with his fans across North America this year!\n\nwww.jaygavinmusic.com\n\nHawkshaw Hawkins\n\nHawk was born April 8, 1963 to Country Music Hall of Fame star Ms. Jean Shepard. Hawk Jr was the second born son of legendary Hawkshaw Hawkins who had the number one hit song in the country “Lonesome 77203” and untimely passed away the same week, just a month before Hawk was born. Hawkshaw died in the fatal crash that killed Patsy Cline and Cowboy Copas.\n\nBorn to two very musical people, naturally Hawk found himself following in their footsteps at a young age. Hawk learned to play guitar, and found he not only had a talent for playing, but his rich smooth voice was original and drew a crowd wherever he went. Hawk Jr has appeared on the stage of the Grand Ole Opry both the old Ryman auditorium and the new Opry at Opry Mills, he has done shows with such greats as Bill Anderson, Jack Green, Roy Clark, Charlie Louvin, The Marshall Tucker Band and much more.\n\nHawk Jr also has also the writer of over 500 songs and has had cuts from artist such as Johnny Lee, Ronnie Mcdowell, Hank Williams Jr, Davis Daniel, Shawn Camp, Ron Williams, and several other acts.\n\nHawk resides in Hendersonville TN.\n\ncnicole1474.wixsite.com/hawk2\n\nBilly Don Burns\n\nBilly Don Burns is the real deal. He’s a no nonsense kind of guy who prefers to let his songs speak for themselves. After all, he’s been making music for more than fifty years and in that time, he’s seen both the ups and downs of the music business and has honestly expressed himself in a decidedly uncompromising way.\n\nIt’s little wonder then that his songs have been recorded by the best in the business - a list that includes Willie Nelson, Johnny Paycheck, Tanya Tucker, Mel Tillis, and Sammy Kershaw, to name but a few. And now a new generation has come along and recorded his songs – artists like Cody Jinks, Colter Wall, Whitey Morgan and others.\n\n“I make music because that’s all I’ve ever done,” Billy Don maintains. “It’s all I know. I write because the songs come out of me and I’m privileged to be able to give them life.\n\nBilly Don’s new album, I’ve Seen A Lot of Highway, released on October 6 via Shooter Jennings’ Black Country Rock label, provides an apt summation of both the struggles and successes he’s seen over the course of his career. BDB and his guitar landed in Nashville in 1972. Within a few weeks Harlan Howard had signed him as a writer with Wilderness Music, where he met Lefty Frizzell, Tanya Tucker, Waylon and Tommy Jennings. He was accepted in that crowd with Billy Joe Shaver, Lee Clayton, Billy Ray Reynolds, Steve Young, etc. He scored his first major cut by Connie Smith on Columbia Records in 1974. Over the years Burns became recognized as one of the original outlaws and great writers of country music. His songs pretty much tell his life story.\n\nwww.billydonburns.net/brothersofthemusic\n\nShow at 8:00 pm, no cover, tips appreciated, BOOK ONLINE or call 865-285-0155 for dinner reservations.\n\nWe don’t want y’all to miss out on the music, so when booking your online reservation for a show, please be sure to select the correct date for the show you are wanting to attend.
