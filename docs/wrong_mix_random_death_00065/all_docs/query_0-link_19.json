        "text": "Yes, many of us use the GPS function on our iOS or Android phone when driving – especially at night. It’s just one of the benefits and blessings of advancements in telecommunications technology.\n\nHow well we remember the day Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone back on January 9, 2007. As he said that day, “Today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone.”\n\nReinvent it, they did.\n\nThen one year later, they added GPS technology to guide drivers – and pedestrians – to their intended destinations.\n\nBut without outdoor lighting, knowing for sure that you actually did reach your destination may have been questionable. Without question, destination neighborhood entrance outdoor lighting reaffirms that the technology locator was right on target.\n\nTo Welcome Residents And Guests To LaurelBrooke In Franklin, TN, After Sunset, We Pumped Up The Volume On Their HOA Exterior Lighting\n\nTo make the LaurelBrooke more visible as you drive up to the entrance at night, our COLT-Certified outdoor lighting professionals design and installation professionals recently enhanced the illumination palette there.\n\nWe added three 11 Watt BB03 outdoor lighting fixtures on the River Birch to ensure that it was fully illuminated from all sides – now you can’t miss it. They now welcome visitors coming from either direction and warmly say farewell to those upon leaving.\n\nHow To Perfect Front And Back HOA Neighborhood Outdoor Lighting\n\nWe just redid the lighting at the front and back LaurelBrooke entrance by adding two mini flood lights on each side of the monument sign. By installing two lights and crisscrossing their trajectory, they now illuminate the entire sign and make the gold letters more easily readable.\n\nThis is significant as illuminating signage with gold lettering can be difficult when untrained sources approach the work at hand. Gold lettering on signs such as this can be hard to read. Diffused light spread coming from side angles can cause the illumination to obstruct visibility and clarity with a glare.\n\nExemplary Outdoor Lighting Service For Homeowners Associations And Common Areas\n\nTo make your neighborhood more welcoming, appealing and easier to find at night, professional landscape and signage lighting is one of the most effective ways to add beauty and value to any property, be it a home, Bed & Breakfast, tourist attraction or an entire neighborhood, such as LaurelBrooke.\n\nThanks to our successes after decades in business, we’ve worked with countless Homeowners Associations to enhance the curb appeal and safety of residential neighborhoods across the greater Nashville, Tennessee area.\n\nOutdoor lighting is all that we do; and we understand the science and art of it. When it comes to neighborhoods, we excel at adding beauty, functionality, safety, and security to:\n\n• HOA signage of all types and dimensions\n\n• Entryways and gatehouses\n\n• Clubhouses\n\n• Walkways and pathways\n\n• Pools and other common areas\n\n• Pool houses and neighborhood pool surround lighting\n\n• Neighborhood entry landscape lighting\n\n• Neighborhood entry sign lighting\n\n• Community spaces\n\n• Any shared recreational spaces\n\n• Greenways, pathways and trails\n\n• Tennis courts and pickleball courts\n\nBut That’s Not All – We Service And Maintain Our HOA Lighting Installations So You Don’t Have To\n\nAfter we install your lights, our services don’t end there. We are committed to making sure you are always satisfied with your outdoor lighting. We offer our Annual Maintenance Plan (AMP) to ensure your property is always looking it’s best.
