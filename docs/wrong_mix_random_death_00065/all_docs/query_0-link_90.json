        "text": "Tell us a little about where you are from, describing it for those who are likely never to have been there before. If you have out-of-town visitors, where do you take them?\n\nI'm from the outer suburbs of Melbourne in a town called Blackburn. It's a very bushy area and we live a two minute walk from Blackburn Lake, about a 10 minute walk from the station, and five minutes from the local football club.\n\nWhat do you do for work?\n\nI am a carpenter\n\nIt's karaoke night, what song are you singing?\n\nSeptember by Earth, Wind, and Fire\n\nWhat would campers be surprised to learn about you?\n\nI am also dyslexic\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to this summer?\n\nTaking the kids on activities and meeting new people.\n\nHow would your closest friends describe you?\n\nOutgoing but quiet\n\nWhich house would the Sorting Hat place you in if you were a student at Hogwarts?\n\nGryffindor 🦁\n\nTell us a little about your family.\n\nI have a big family. I'm the oldest and then there's my brother Kynan, then my sister Tayona, and then my youngest brother Torin, and my mum and dad.\n\nWhat’s something you’d like to teach the campers?\n\nA new skill that they have been wanting to achieve\n\nWhat is your proudest accomplishment?\n\nComing 2nd all-around at the Australian gymnastics championship and qualifying for the Australian team\n\nAsk me about the time I... broke my foot at nationals and continued to compete the rest of the competition when I was 16.\n\nYou have a unexpected day off at home; how do you spend your day?\n\nWaves are pumping, sun's out, and I'm down at the coast surfing.\n\nTell us a little about where you are from, describing it for those who are likely never to have been there before. If you have out-of-town visitors, where do you take them?\n\nI come from Hungary, which is located in the middle of Europe. Budapest is a capital city with beautiful architecture. In the old times it was two small towns, Buda and Pest. The Buda side has hills with a famous castle and churches. The Pest side is flat with the beautiful Parlament building. Between this two areas we have the Danube river with 7 bridges. If I had a visitor I would take him/her to see the Parliament building, which is well known for it’s unique architecture.\n\nWhen it’s your turn to control the tunes in the camp van, what kind of music will we be listening to?\n\nI really enjoy Hungarian folk music, however, when I’m in the US I’m really forward to listening to famous American country music.\n\nWhat would campers be surprised to learn about you?\n\nIn my freetime I like to prepare tasty Hungarian meals such as Gulyas soup\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to this summer?\n\nMy hope is to form a really good connection with the campers and I’m really looking forward to enjoying the slip and slide activity which will help me get to really know them.\n\nWhich house would the Sorting Hat place you in if you were a student at Hogwarts?\n\nGryffindor 🦁\n\nHow would your closest friends describe you?\n\nMy friends call me MAMA, because I prepare tasty takeaway dishes for all my friends.\n\nAsk me about the time I... traveled to Australia this year and saw the kangaroos\n\nIf you were to invite three people (dead or alive, real or characters) to a dinner party, who would you invite?\n\nGordon Ramsay, Mickey Mouse and Selena Gomez\n\nYou have a unexpected day off at home; how do you spend your day? What would your perfect day look like?\n\nI have a dachsund (hotdog) whose name is Willie and we love walking around, relaxing in the park and enjoying a tasty cappucino. At the end of the day and in the evening I would prepare a good meal for my friends.\n\nTell us a little about where you are from, describing it for those who are likely never to have been there before. If you have out-of-town visitors, where do you take them?\n\nI am from Wysoka, little village near Krakow. If I have some visitors I would take them to Wadowice. Wadowice is the town that is famous for being Pope Jan Pawel II’s hometown.\n\nWhat do you do for work/studies?\n\nI have my own swimming school in Wadowice. Before I started my bussines I finished Economic High School in Wadowice.\n\nIt's karaoke night, what song are you singing?\n\nA few weeks ago I was with my girlfriend in the cinema and after the film she started singing “Unwritten” by Natasha Bedingfield all day and now this song is stuck in my mind. So if it karaoke night i would sing this song.\n\nWhat would campers be surprised to learn about you?\n\nAll the kids will be laughing at me because I look like a 40 years man but I am only 21 😂\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to this summer?\n\nI’m looking forward to meeting new people at camp of course and also gaining experience in teaching children swimming.

Those are the kinds of things I feel like you don't get at other camps, at least not to the same degree.\n\nWhat might campers be surprised to learn about you?\n\nI've lived in 12 countries. (And no, it is not because I'm on the run)\n\nWhat are you looking forward to the most this summer?\n\nI'm always looking for ways to improve and build on previous iterations of things. I'm looking forward to having so many former counselors returning, and how we can use those skills and experiences.\n\nYou worked as a counselor for two summers, and have now been tutoring for two summers. How different is your experience as a tutor vs a counselor?\n\nI was worried being a tutor would mean I wouldn't get to know all the campers in the same way you do as a counselor, but having that 1-1 time everyday with the kids I've tutored has allowed a unique relationship with each of them. You probably have more fun, overall, as a counselor, but I think you make more of a difference as a tutor.\n\nWhat do you do during the school year?\n\nI live in Spain, I teach English language classes online, so I have students from, literally, all over the world. I'm having fun attempting to retro-fit the skills I'm learning tutoring at camp into language teaching.\n\nAsk me about the time I… came within an hour of making the front page of a national newspaper.\n\nYou’ve been teaching English for many years now all over the world. Where has been your favorite place that you’ve lived?\n\nI keep coming back to NC, so read into that what you will. I think Vietnam will always be my favorite, since it was my first 'long term' home outside Ireland, also my first teaching experience, and the culture was so different to anything else I'd experienced up to that point.\n\nWhat advice would you give a camper or staff member who is coming to camp for the first time?\n\nThere's a reason the people who really get involved at camp seem to be the ones having the most fun. You get out of it what you put into it. We're all stuck on the side of a mountain together for 6 weeks, so you might as well sing the songs and play the games. You'll enjoy the summer more if you do.\n\nTell us a little about where you are from, describing it for those who are likely never to have been there before. If you have out-of-town visitors, where do you take them?\n\nI’m from a county an Ireland called Kerry; it’s a county that lives and breathes football (Gaelic). I live in Killarney a very popular tourist destination. Killarney is a town surrounded by lakes, rivers and mountains. My favourite part about where I’m from is the variety of beaches that you can choose from.\n\nWhat do you do for work/studies?\n\nI’m a second year student in college, studying social care.\n\nWhat would campers be surprised to learn about you?\n\nThat I lived in Spain for 7 years.\n\nWhat are your hopes for this summer? What are you most looking forward to this summer?\n\nMy hopes for this summer is to have a lot of fun and to get to meet knew people from around the world.\n\nHow would your closest friends describe you?\n\nMy closest friends would describe me as a quiet person to strangers but a firecracker around friends.\n\nWhat is your proudest accomplishment?\n\nMy proudest accomplishment would be being my cousins sponsor for her confirmation\n\nWhat can campers do to win your heart?\n\nTo have a lot of fun while they are camp and to not call football, Gaelic football!!\n\nTell us a little about where you are from, describing it for those who are likely never to have been there before. If you have out-of-town visitors, where do you take them?\n\nI’m from Colombia, more precisely Bogotá. It's a wonderful country with many festivals and good food. We also have beautiful mountains and animals. In my country, there is always something to do. If you were to visit my country I would love to show you Monserrate a cathedral on a big mountain overlooking Bogotá. I’d go downtown to see all the colonial houses and visit Usaquen a fantastic neighborhood in my city.\n\nWhat do you do for work/studies?\n\nI'm studying psychology at the University of Rosario. I love the career that I'm studying, it is extremely interesting.\n\nWhat would campers be surprised to learn about you?\n\nThat I'm the new typing teacher! Also in the time between last summer and this summer, I went to study in France (so I also know French).\n\nWhat are your hopes for this summer? What are you most looking forward to this summer?\n\nI look forward to making the typing class something super fun (with some music and different activities). I also can’t wait to go to Lake James, to win in capture the flag, and go to all the pool parties.\n\nHow would your closest friends describe you?\n\nThey’d say I’m creative, dedicated, happy, and always have music stuck in my head.\n\nWhat can campers do to win your heart?\n\nJust be themselves, always be respectful to others, and be open to adventures.\n\nWhat’s something you’d like to teach the campers?\n\nI can’t wait to teach the campers how to type and how to use technology in a good way.\n\nWhat is your proudest accomplishment?\n\nFor years I dreamt of studying in France and I'm proud to be here now without needing a translator.\n\nAsk me about the time I... almost got expelled from Disney World in Florida.\n\nTell us a little about your family.\n\nI'm the youngest one of three, we are a very close family. We love to travel and have special moments together. My parents are crazy in love with each other and my grandma is the most spoiled in the family.\n\nWhat advice would you give to campers coming to camp for their first summer?\n\nJust be yourself, be open to meeting new people, and try new food (it's usually better than you think). Don't be afraid to ask questions or ask for a hug and just enjoy the experience.\n\nWhat made you want to come work at camp again this summer?\n\nAfter a fantastic summer, I just couldn't resist the idea of coming back. I can’t wait to be with all the campers again and be part of an amazing group of people. Camp is a happy place of mine in the middle of the woods."
