Job's biography will help you realize that you too can achieve your goals by overcoming your struggles even when they seem to repeat themselves.\n\nSteve Jobs Biography\n\nSteve Jobs was an American entrepreneur, business magnate, inventor, and industrial designer. He was the co-founder, chairman, and chief executive officer (CEO) of Apple Inc. He was widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution and the modern smartphone industry.\n\nJobs was born on February 24, 1955 in San Francisco, California, and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs. He attended Homestead High School in Cupertino, California and later went to Reed College in Portland, Oregon, but dropped out after six months. He then attended the Hewlett-Packard Company's computer lab, where he met Steve Wozniak, who would later become his business partner.\n\nIn 1976, Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple Computer, Inc. in Jobs' parents' garage. The company's first product, the Apple I, went on sale the following year. In 1977, Apple introduced the Apple II, which became one of the first commercially successful personal computers.\n\nJobs was forced out of Apple in 1985, but he returned to the company in 1996, when Apple acquired his computer animation studio, Pixar Animation Studios. He was appointed interim CEO in 1997 and became the permanent CEO in 2000. Under his leadership, Apple introduced several revolutionary products, including the iMac, iTunes, the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad.\n\nJobs was known for his unique leadership style, characterized by his perfectionism, his insistence on secrecy, and his ability to think differently. He was also known for his charismatic presentations and his ability to create excitement around new products. He was awarded over 300 patents, covering a range of technologies from computers, displays, and user interfaces to packaging design and even a glass stairway.\n\nSteve Jobs passed away on October 5, 2011 due to complications from a relapse of his previously treated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. His death was widely mourned, and his contributions to technology and design continue to be celebrated.\n\nGet Your Guide For Free\n\nSteve Jobs Life Story\n\nSteve Jobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted at birth by a couple named Paul and Clara Jobs. When asked about his parents, Jobs has always enthusiastically responded that Paul and Clara were his real parents.\n\nLuckily, both of Steve's adopted parents were focused on the role of education and the difference it can make in their young son's life. Steve's mother Clara was an accountant and she taught Steve how to read before he even started Kindergarten. Paul Jobs, a machinist for a company that made lasers, taught his son electronics and how to work with his hands. He did little things that encouraged his son to be inquisitive and to always embrace learning. For instance, one day, Paul Jobs cleared off a section of his workbench and gave it to the young Steve. At that workbench, Steve was encouraged to take apart and reassemble devices to learn how they work.\n\nJobs frequented after-school lectures at the Hewlett-Packard Company in California. Later, along with Steve Wozniak (Apple's co-founder), Jobs was hired there as a Summer employee. Following high school graduation, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon and dropped out after only one semester. Steve continued attending classes at Reed, while sleeping on the floor at friends' houses, returning Coke bottles for food money, getting weekly free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple, and getting into drugs (Steve called his LCD drug experience one of the most enlightening experiences of his life).\n\nSteve Jobs Founding Apple\n\nJobs and Steve Wozniak met in 1971, when a mutual friend introduced 21 year-old Wozniak to 16 year-old Jobs. In 1976, when Jobs was only twenty-one, they invented the first Apple computer and founded Apple computer in Job's parents garage.\n\nWhile Jobs was a persuasive and charismatic director for Apple, he was getting into power struggles frequently. In 1985, he was fired from his role as head of the Macintosh division by Apple's board of directors, and five months later, Jobs left the company.\n\nIn a speech Jobs gave at Stanford University, he said being fired from Apple was the best thing that could have happened to him; \"The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life\".\n\nFounding NeXT & Pixar\n\nAfter leaving Apple, Jobs founded NeXT Computer, which produced sophisticated workstations. Jobs tried to market NeXT products to the financial and academic community, highlighting its innovative new technologies. After a few years, after having sold only 50,000 machines, NeXT transitioned fully to software development. In 1996, NeXT, the company that Jobs had started with 7 million dollar was sold to Apple for 429 million in order to integrate its technologies into Apple's operating system.\n\nA year after leaving Apple, in 1986, Jobs bought The Graphics Group which was later renamed Pixar for the price of 10 million dollar. After years of unprofitability it contracted with Disney to produce a number of computer-animated films that Disney would co-finance and distribute. Their first movie was Toy Story, which became an instant summer blockbuster, followed by ten more pitch-perfect gems such as Finding Nemo and A Bug's Life. In 2006, Disney had agreed to purchase Pixar in an all-stock transaction worth 7.4 billion dollars. Jobs became The Walt Disney Company's largest single shareholder owning seven percent of the company's stock.\n\nReturning to Apple\n\nIn 1997, a year after Apple's merger with NeXT, Jobs was hired back as an interim CEO and the company started to branch out, introducing the iPod portable music player, iTunes digital music software, the iTunes Store, the Iphone mobile device and the IPAD tablet. Today, Apple is worth more than Intel And Microsoft combined, with a market value of around 300 billion dollars.\n\nGet Your Guide For Free\n\nIn August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO of Apple and a few months later, he died of cancer after 8 years fighting the illness.\n\nSteve Jobs Lessons\n\nFor all of Steve Jobs's faults, one cannot help but admire his life of dedication to his goals. In spite of great personal difficulties, Jobs achieved a level of business success that is truly rare. Jobs was able to make his dream a reality because he never stopped believing. He never gave up even when it seemed like the goal was unreachable. His goal was more than making money; he was deeply committed his vision of creating \"insanely great\" products. For me, Jobs's Zero to Hero story is a perfect example of how vision and perseverance make dreams come true.\n\n***\n\nSteve Jobs Fast Facts\n\nSteve jobs birthday: February 24, 1955\n\nWhen did steve jobs die?: October 5, 2011\n\nWhen did steve jobs start apple: April 1, 1976\n\nSteve Jobs Net Worth: Steve Jobs' net worth at the time of his death in 2011 was estimated to be around $10.2 billion.

His biological parents were Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah \"John\" Jandali. Jandali was born into a Muslim family in Syria and pursued higher education in political science. Joanne Schieble, an American of German descent, became pregnant with Steve and arranged a closed adoption due to her family's opposition to her relationship with Jandali. Steve was adopted by Paul Reinhold and Clara Jobs, who lacked a college education but promised to support his education. The Jobs family lived in various places, including Wisconsin and Indiana, before moving to California.\n\nInfancy and Childhood\n\nDuring his childhood, Jobs had a challenging relationship with his parents, particularly his father Paul. However, he developed a strong bond with his adoptive parents, considering them his true parents. He struggled with traditional schooling, frequently getting into trouble and displaying a rebellious attitude. His interest in electronics started early, and he befriended engineers in his neighborhood. Jobs had difficulty making friends his age and was often seen as a loner. He displayed a talent for electronics, but his behavior led to disciplinary issues.\n\nJobs credited his fourth-grade teacher for igniting his passion for learning and helping him overcome his challenges in school. He continued to develop his interest in electronics and literature, setting the stage for his later pursuits. He also became involved in the counterculture movement of the 1960s and experimented with substances like LSD. Despite his unconventional behavior, he managed to form friendships with individuals who shared his interests. He later befriended Steve Wozniak, who became a crucial figure in his life.\n\nHigh School and College Years\n\nJobs attended Homestead High School, which was located in the heart of Silicon Valley, giving him exposure to the emerging tech culture. He displayed an interest in electronics but clashed with teachers due to his rebellious attitude. During high school, Jobs experimented with drugs and developed a fascination with literature. He also formed a strong friendship with Wozniak and started exploring entrepreneurial endeavors. Together, they created \"blue boxes\" that manipulated the telephone network, offering a glimpse of Jobs' future entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nAfter high school, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Oregon but dropped out after just one semester due to the high cost and his lack of interest in formal education. He continued to audit classes and expand his knowledge, demonstrating his unconventional approach to learning. His exposure to calligraphy classes at Reed influenced the design aesthetics of Apple's products later on. Throughout his early life and education, Steve Jobs showcased a blend of rebelliousness, creativity, and an innate understanding of technology. These qualities would play a pivotal role in shaping his future endeavors and the foundation of Apple Inc.\n\nPre-Apple\n\nIn the early 1970s, Steve Jobs embarked on a journey that would shape his life's trajectory. After a stint at Reed College, he worked as a technician at Atari in California, contributing to the development of video games. He partnered with Steve Wozniak, who had designed a version of Pong. Jobs' abrasive yet brilliant personality earned him recognition as a valuable contributor. Despite tumultuous relationships, including one with Chrisann Brennan, he embarked on a spiritual quest, traveling to India in search of enlightenment with his friend Daniel Kottke. Although he encountered a different ashram than intended, his experiences and meditative practices during this time significantly influenced his outlook.\n\nApple (1976–1985)\n\nJobs and Wozniak's quest for personal computing led them to create the Apple I computer in 1976. They formed Apple Computer Company with administrative overseer Ronald Wayne, initially working from Jobs' garage. Their company's name was inspired by Jobs' time at an apple orchard. The Apple I, sold as bare circuit boards to enthusiasts, found initial success with orders from computer retailer Paul Terrell. The introduction of the Apple II at the West Coast Computer Faire in 1977 marked a turning point, designed primarily by Wozniak. The success of the Apple II provided a solid foundation for the company's growth.\n\nHowever, Jobs' personal life was marked by complexities. He had a tumultuous relationship with Chrisann Brennan and became a father to Lisa Brennan. His success at Apple was accompanied by personal challenges as well as organizational shifts. John Sculley was brought in as CEO in 1983, leading to conflicts over the direction of the company. Jobs famously asked Sculley, \"Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?\" Despite successes like the Macintosh's introduction in 1984 and the '1984' Super Bowl ad, tensions grew within Apple. Sculley proposed reorganizing the company, which led Jobs to submit his resignation in 1985.\n\nJobs' departure from Apple marked a pivotal moment. Along with several other Apple employees, he founded NeXT, a company focused on high-end computers and innovative software. Meanwhile, the Macintosh faced challenges from Microsoft's Windows and IBM PC clones, leading to a gradual decline in its market share.\n\n1985-1988: Founding NeXT Inc. and Comeback Event\n\nAfter resigning from Apple in 1985, Steve Jobs founded NeXT Inc. with a startup capital of $7 million. Facing financial troubles and no product on the horizon, he attracted investment from billionaire Ross Perot, which helped keep the company afloat. In 1988, Jobs orchestrated a lavish gala launch event for the NeXT computer, marking his comeback. The event, held at the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco, showcased Jobs's innovative vision and was described as a multimedia extravaganza.\n\n1990-1994: NeXT Workstations and Technical Innovations\n\nIn 1990, NeXT released its first workstations, targeting the education sector with advanced technology but facing criticism for their high costs. The NeXT workstation boasted technical strengths, particularly its object-oriented software development system. NeXT products were marketed to various communities, including finance, science, and academia, highlighting experimental technologies like the Mach kernel and built-in Ethernet port. Notably, English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee used a NeXT computer to invent the World Wide Web in 1990.\n\nThe second-generation NeXTcube was launched in 1990, aiming to revolutionize interpersonal computing. It introduced the NeXTMail multimedia email system, allowing sharing of voice, image, graphics, and video within emails. Jobs's obsession with aesthetic perfection was evident in the development of NeXTcube's magnesium case, but this emphasis strained NeXT's hardware division. By 1993, NeXT shifted fully to software development with the release of NeXTSTEP/Intel, reporting its first profit in 1994.\n\nPixar and Disney Collaboration\n\nIn 1986, Jobs funded the spinout of Pixar from Lucasfilm's computer graphics division, and under his leadership, Pixar produced hit films like Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Finding Nemo, and more. Despite a rocky relationship, Jobs and Disney eventually collaborated on the production and distribution of successful animated films. In 2006, Disney acquired Pixar, making Jobs the largest individual shareholder in Disney. His influence extended to both companies, and his approach to collaboration was described as mature and non-interfering.\n\n1997-2011: Return to Apple and Innovation\n\nIn 1996, Apple acquired NeXT for $400 million, bringing Jobs back to the company. He became interim chief executive and later, permanent CEO. Under his guidance, Apple incorporated NeXT's technology into its products, leading to the development of Mac OS X and innovative designs like the iMac. Apple expanded into consumer electronics and music distribution with the iPod, iTunes, and the iPhone, revolutionizing the mobile industry.\n\nJobs was known for his charismatic presentations and persuasive abilities, earning him the nickname \"reality distortion field.\" He displayed a consistent personal style, often seen wearing a black turtleneck, jeans, and sneakers. Jobs's demand for perfection and innovation positioned Apple as a leader in the tech industry. He remained engaged in various ventures, including serving as a board member at Gap Inc. and engaging in legal battles, such as the stock options controversy.\n\nHealth Issues\n\nIn October 2003, Steve Jobs was diagnosed with cancer, specifically a rare islet cell neuroendocrine tumor in his pancreas. Despite this diagnosis, he initially resisted medical intervention for nine months, opting for alternative medicine and unconventional treatments. His diet and treatments were criticized by experts for not effectively addressing his disease. Eventually, in July 2004, he underwent a successful pancreaticoduodenectomy, a surgical procedure that seemed to remove the tumor. However, he did not undergo chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\n\nIn January 2006, it was revealed that Jobs's cancer had returned, but he kept this information private, leading to speculation about his health due to his thin appearance and listless behavior. Despite this, Apple maintained that his health was robust. In 2008, a mistaken obituary publication intensified rumors about his health, leading Jobs to humorously address the issue during a keynote presentation. In 2009, he underwent a liver transplant, with a successful prognosis.\n\nResignation\n\nIn 2011, Jobs announced a medical leave of absence, during which he made appearances at significant Apple events. In August of the same year, he resigned as Apple's CEO due to his inability to fulfill his duties, naming Tim Cook as his successor while remaining chairman of the board. Jobs continued to work for Apple until his death.\n\nDeath\n\nSteve Jobs passed away on October 5, 2011, at his home in Palo Alto, California, due to complications from a relapse of his pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. He had lost consciousness the previous day and was surrounded by his family when he passed. Jobs's final words were \"Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.\" His death was mourned by Apple, Pixar, and the broader tech industry. Private and public memorials were held to commemorate his life, with notable figures like Bill Gates and President Barack Obama offering statements in response to his passing. At his request, Jobs was buried in an unmarked grave.\n\nWhat is Steve Jobs famous for?\n\nSteve Jobs is best known for his role as the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple Inc.

It also covers the internal conflicts and struggles within the company and how it reflects on the management style of Jobs.\n\n\"Steve Jobs\" is considered to be one of the most comprehensive and well-researched biographies of Steve Jobs and it is widely considered to be an essential read for anyone interested in the life and legacy of one of the most important figures in the technology industry.\n\nSteve Jobs Outfit\n\nSteve Jobs was known for his distinctive personal style, characterized by his love for simple, minimalist clothing. He was often seen wearing a black turtleneck sweater, blue jeans, and New Balance sneakers.\n\nThis outfit, which he wore in most of his public appearances, press conferences and product launches, became his signature look and it was widely recognized as a symbol of his minimalist aesthetic and his approach to design.\n\nJobs was rarely seen wearing anything else, and he would often wear the same outfit for multiple days in a row. He was known to own several of the same turtlenecks, jeans and sneakers, and would wear them until they were worn out.\n\nThe turtlenecks were designed and made by Issey Miyake and it was said that Jobs would always wear black turtlenecks, because it made him feel like a “blank canvas”, giving more focus to the products he was presenting rather than himself.\n\nIt is worth noting that Steve Jobs was not the only one in the tech industry with a signature outfit, other leaders like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates have also been known for their consistent and simple attire.\n\nSteve Jobs commencement speech\n\nSteve Jobs delivered a commencement speech at Stanford University on June 12, 2005.

He explained how that class would later influence the design of the Macintosh computer and how it helped him understand the importance of design in technology.\n\nHe also spoke about the importance of finding your passion and following it, regardless of where it may lead. He spoke about how he had been fired from Apple, the company he co-founded, but how he had used that experience to start NeXT Computer and eventually return to Apple and lead the company to new heights of success.\n\nJobs also spoke about the importance of connecting the dots in life and how events that may seem insignificant at the time can ultimately shape your life and lead you to where you are meant to be.\n\nHe also shared his personal experience with cancer and how it changed his perspective on life, and he urged the graduates to trust in their intuition and not to be afraid of failure.\n\nThe speech was well-received and has since been widely shared, it has been considered as one of the most inspiring and memorable commencement speeches in history and it is still widely referenced today.\n\nSteve Jobs last words\n\nThe following is thought to be the essay Jobs wrote in his last days:\n\n\"I reached the pinnacle of success in the business world. In others’ eyes, my life is the epitome of success. However, aside from work, I have little joy. In the end, my wealth is only a fact of life that I am accustomed to. At this moment, lying on my bed and recalling my life, I realize that all the recognition and wealth that I took so much pride in have paled and become meaningless in the face of my death.\n\nYou can employ someone to drive the car for you, make money for you, but you cannot have someone bear your sickness for you. Material things lost can be found or replaced. But there is one thing that can never be found when it’s lost—Life. Whichever stage in life you’re in right now, with time, you will face the day when the curtain falls.\n\nTreasure love for your family, love for your spouse, love for your friends. Treat yourself well and cherish others. As we grow older, and hopefully wiser, we realize that a $3000 or a $30 watch both tell the same time. You will realize that your true inner happiness does not come from the material things of this world. Whether you fly first class or economy, if the plane goes down—you go down with it.\n\nTherefore, I hope you realize, when you have mates, buddies and old friends, brothers and sisters, who you chat with, laugh with, talk with, sing with, talk about north-south-east-west or heaven and earth, that is true happiness. Don’t educate your children to be rich. Educate them to be happy. So when they grow up they will know the value of things and not the price.\n\nEat your food as your medicine, otherwise, you have to eat medicine as your food.\n\nThe One who loves you will never leave you for another because, even if there are 100 reasons to give up, he or she will find a reason to hold on. There is a big difference between a human being and being human. Only a few really understand it. You are loved when you are born. You will be loved when you die. In between, you have to manage.\n\nThe six best doctors in the world are sunlight, rest, exercise, diet, self-confidence, and friends. Maintain them in all stages and enjoy a healthy life.”\n\nSteve Jobs Quotes\n\nFavorite Quote: \"My favorite things in life don't cost any money.

Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone. And here it is.\"\n\n\"We made the buttons on the screen look so good you'll want to lick them.\"\n\n\"A lot of people in our industry haven't had very diverse experiences. So they don't have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one's understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.\"\n\n\"We don't get a chance to do that many things, and every one should be really excellent.
