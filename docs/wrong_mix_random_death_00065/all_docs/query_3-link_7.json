        "text": "\"I reached the pinnacle of success in the business world. In others' eyes, my life is an epitome of success.\n\nHowever, aside from work, I have little joy. In the end, wealth is only a fact of life that I am accustomed to.\n\nAt this moment, lying on the sick bed and recalling my whole life, I realize that all the recognition and wealth that I took so much pride in, have paled and become meaningless in the face of impending death.\n\nIn the darkness, I look at the green lights from the life supporting machines and hear the humming mechanical sounds, I can feel the breath of god of death drawing closer ...\n\nNow I know, when we have accumulated sufficient wealth to last our lifetime, we should pursue other matters that are unrelated to wealth ...\n\nShould be something that is more important:\n\nPerhaps relationships, perhaps art, perhaps a dream from younger days\n\nNon-stop pursuing of wealth will only turn a person into a twisted being, just like me.\n\nGod gave us the senses to let us feel the love in everyone's heart, not the illusions brought about by wealth.\n\nThe wealth I have won in my life I cannot bring with me. What I can bring is only the memories precipitated by love.\n\nThat's the true riches which will follow you, accompany you, giving you strength and light to go on.\n\nLove can travel a thousand miles. Life has no limit. Go where you want to go. Reach the height you want to reach. It is all in your heart and in your hands.\n\nWhat is the most expensive bed in the world?\n\nSick bed ...\n\nYou can employ someone to drive the car for you, make money for you but you cannot have someone to bear the sickness for you.\n\nMaterial things lost can be found. But there is one thing that can never be found when it is lost — Life.\n\nWhen a person goes into the operating room, he will realize that there is one book that he has yet to finish reading — Book of Healthy Life.\n\nWhichever stage in life we are at right now, with time, we will face the day when the curtain comes down.\n\nTreasure Love for your family, love for your spouse, love for your friends.\n\nTreat yourself well. Cherish others.\""
