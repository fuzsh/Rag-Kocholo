        "text": "Steve Jobs was awarded a GRAMMY Trustees Award tonight at the 54th annual music awards gala.\n\nThe National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences awards its GRAMMY Trustees Award every year to \"individuals who, during their careers in music, have made significant contributions, other than performance, to the field of recording.\" Past recipients include Robert Moog (1970), Les Paul (1983), Walt Disney (1989) and Clive Davis (2000).\n\nApple senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, Eddy Cue, accepted the award on Jobs' behalf.\n\nThe post about the Trustees Award for Jobs on the GRAMMYs site was penned by Cellist Yo-Yo Ma, himself a 16-time GRAMMY winner. Ma also played at the private memorial service for Steve Jobs on October 16, 2011 with U2â€™s Bono and Joan Baez.\n\nBefore I met Steve, I first had to say no to him. In the early '90s, I was touring like a madman, trying to juggle professional commitments and a home life with a young family, when a call came in. Steve Jobs was getting married at Yosemite and he wanted me to play. I declined with great regret. When we met, years later, I was also introduced to his wife and children. The simplicity, directness and openness of his family really struck me. Steve showed me the things he cared about, and I shared the music I would have played at their wedding. From there, the friendship grew.\n\nIt's a touching read and well-deserved award for Jobs.\n\nApple previously won a technical GRAMMY award in 2002."
