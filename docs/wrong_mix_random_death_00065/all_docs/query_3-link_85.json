When I was 25, I met that man and he was my brother,\" writes the novelist Mona Simpson in her eulogy for that brother, Steve Jobs. Her eulogy was published in the New York Times on Sunday.\n\nWhen Simpson received that call, she was living in New York and working on her first novel:\n\n\"I had a job at a small magazine in an office the size of a closet, with three other aspiring writers. When one day a lawyer called me — me, the middle-class girl from California who hassled the boss to buy us health insurance — and said his client was rich and famous and was my long-lost brother, the young editors went wild. This was 1985 and we worked at a cutting-edge literary magazine, but I’d fallen into the plot of a Dickens novel and really, we all loved those best. The lawyer refused to tell me my brother’s name and my colleagues started a betting pool. The leading candidate: John Travolta. I secretly hoped for a literary descendant of Henry James — someone more talented than I, someone brilliant without even trying. \"\n\nThough he was a millionaire, Jobs always picked Simpson up at the airport when she came to visit him. She also experienced sides of him that few outside his close circle would know:\n\n\"Steve was like a girl in the amount of time he spent talking about love. Love was his supreme virtue, his god of gods. He tracked and worried about the romantic lives of the people working with him.\"\n\nEven when Jobs was very sick, Simpson writes, \"his taste, his discrimination and his judgment held. He went through 67 nurses before finding kindred spirits and then he completely trusted the three who stayed with him to the end. Tracy. Arturo. Elham.\"\n\nAs the Green Bay Press Gazette explained in a recent story, Jobs' biological mother was 23-year-old Joanne Schieble, whose family owned a mink farm on Green Bay's east side. She met his father, 23-year-old Abdulfattah Jandali, of Syria, while both were students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nSchieble gave birth to Jobs in California, and he was placed with an adoptive family. Schieble and Jandali later married and had a daughter, Mona, in 1957. After her parents divorced, her mother remarried, and Mona became Mona Simpson."
