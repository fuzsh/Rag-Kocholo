        "text": "There was a time relatively not so long ago, when I was not really into reading book as the younger version of me found the particular activity of reading was simply tedious. Back then, book to me was what garlic is to vampire I suppose. One book that changed me, as it hit right in the spot somewhere in my soul, is none other than a masterpiece from Walter Isaacson: Steve Jobs. This book is an authorized biography of Steve Jobs, a man of tremendous achievements, well known for his strugle to build a company that today dubbed as arguably the most valuable company in the world: Apple. The book itself is quite thick, 656 pages, enough to almost deter myself back then to buy it with the first salary I earned, but I bought it anyways eventually. I still remember when I held this book in my hand, reading it while I was waiting in an airport to depart to some remote place in Borneo for work, when I passed the X-ray machine, the on-duty officer who check my belonging roll her eyes seeing this book on the tray and said to me \"Do you really read this book from start to end?\". Yes I did, in around 3 weeks and countless revisiting on several chapter that give me lasting impression. I don't know Steve Jobs before I bought this book, an undeniable evidence of how ignorance I was before 2011. Steve Jobs unfortunate death on October 2011 has caused significant ripples around the world, reach even Indonesia, and some random article about it on the web has tickled my curiosity about this man. This curiosity lead me to this book eventually, and not only I ended up reading a story of an intriguing man, but I stumble upon one of the best biography writer for me in Walter Isaacson, the author.\n\n3 Interesting Facts about this book:\n\nSteve Jobs has approached Walter Isaacson, entice him to write a biography about him, several times between 1984 to around early 2009. It was only in 2009 Walter Isaacson consented, partly because Steve Jobs has become such a famous public figure, and also because secretively Walter knew about the ailing condition of Steve Jobs from her wife by that time.\n\nIn contrast with Steve Jobs famous nature to have a comprehensive control over almost all the product that he conceived, He gave total freedom to Walter Isaacson to write this biography albeit the book cover, and also waived the right to peruse the book after its completion.\n\nThere is one compelling theory as to why Jobs gave the name Apple to his company, that is as a homage to Alan Turing, a highly decorated computer scientist who allegedly died due to suicide eating a poisoned apple. In this book, Steve Jobs mildly rebuke the theory, even though he founds it intriguing, and further elaborate that the reason behind the name is simply because it is fun, spirited, and not intimidating (it happened that before he decided the name he just come back from apple farm).\n\nWalter Isaacson personally for me is one of the best living biography author, as I have read four of his books in this genre so far. He has that little bit of magic in conveying great people story that managed to capture the details of event in a such fascinating angle. There is a subtlety in Walter Isaacson story telling, that day after day captivate me to continuing my reading session. One thing that I like in particular from his style, which could be found not only in this book but also on his other biography books, is that he tried to built the nuance of the story that he tried to convey in a way that even a layman could grasp the context of the story. Steve Jobs is a story of a gifted man in the realm of advance technology, he was molded in computer science world that inevitably has a complex nature for common man like me, but somehow Walter isaacson could collate all the pieces of the stories as such that at least I can grasp the big picture.\n\nThe Story of A Brilliant Man With Profound Complexity\n\nFor me, to read this book is first and foremost to understand the world and context that shape the life of a man who built and oversee a company, that initially has its forte on computer, from scratch (the story of how Steve Jobs started the company with his friend Steve Wozniak in a garage is a stuff of legend already) into multinational technology company as it is today. The book reveals the upbringing of Steve Jobs in a such great details that on the later part of the story will bring bitter sweet taste to Steve Jobs. Jobs biologically is the offspring of a Syrian man, Abdulfattah \"John\" al-Jandali who was a PhD student at the University of Wisconsin, at the time when he courted with Jobs mother, Joanne Carole Schieble. Joanne, a Catholic with Swiss and Germent background, happened to be taking a course in which Jandali was a teaching assistant. They are dating and later on due to some irreconcilable difference between both of them, and their families as well, they are seperated temporarily leaving Joanne with Steve Jobs on her womb. Because of her desperate condition, in which Joanne's father threated her to be cut off from the family if she insist to continue her relationship with Jandali who is a muslim, Joanne decided to flee to San Francisco, giving birth in 1955 and put his son on adoption. Fate conspire to conjoin Steve Jobs life with his to be adoptive parents, Paul Reinhold Jobs, who works as Coast Guard mechanic, and her wife Clara Hagopian. The book reveals later on, how Steve Jobs perceived his technically addoptive parents as \"1000% my real parents\" while there was somewhat irrecoverable hurt feeling inside Steve Jobs mind towards his biologicall parents in which he said about them as \"merely my sperm and egg bank\". What an unusual starting point for the protagonist in this book, isn't it?\n\nSteve jobs then spend his childhood in Monta Loma California, under the tutelage and caring from parents who innately believe that their son is naturally brilliant. As being told in the book, child Steve Jobs is taking a dislike toward authority figure from his elementary school, in which he became so rebellious toward his teachers by doing lots of pranks. Notwithstanding the fact that his son is such difficult character to be dealt with from the perspective of the teachers, Paul, never reprove or scold Steve Jobs even once (Paul received abusive treatment from his father during his childhood). Steve Jobd loves Paul, the man he perceived as his real father, deeply. It is from Paul, Steve Jobs get the influence for the passion of mechanic and fixing things, that would later develop into his fondness toward electronic tinkering. Moving forward few years more, under the ultimatum from Steve Jobs to take him out of Crittenden Middle School (Steve was bullied in this school, arguably because he skipped 5th grade, thus he became soacially awkward), his parents decided to purchase a new home in Cupertino, California in order to facilitate school transfer for him. One thing for sure, Steve Jobs parents would go all the way and cut all the trees just for their beloved son Steve.\n\nAfter all the pranks, mischief, and rebellions Steve Jobs ended up in Homestead Highschool and it was around this period of time that he met another genius slash nerd slash prankster which oddly has the same given name with him. Steve Wozniak, his other half when it came to giving birth to Apple later on, is 5 years older than Jobs yet evidently, and perhaps consistently, in term of maturity he was considerably way behind Jobs. These tech wonder couple met through their friend, Bill Fernandez, Jobs's highschool friend and also the person whose garage became the working site for Wozniak. Little did he, Bill Fernandez, know that his effort to match-making two person whom he recognize as tech addict will be such an important event that arguably as much as crucial as the union of Hewlett and Packard 32 years before. Both Steve started in the right foot, initiated with telling about all jokes and prank they have made, then obviously they converse about what they are fond of, electronic and technology. Steve Jobs clearly stated in the book that, he perceived Woz as the only person up to that point that knew lot more about electronic stuff compared to him. When later on they lauch Apple together as a computer company, it is clear as a daylight that Steve Wozniak is the better wizard when it came to engineering and manufactaring a computer. But few qualities that set Steve Jobs apart from Woz, that is determination and perseverance, are the value that render Steve Jobs rather than Steve Woz as the god in the annals of Apple religion. Steve Woz, at its very best, is just the angle perhaps.\n\nLong story short, Jobs and Woz collaborated to built Apple company, with the help of some investor/counselor they met along the way such as Mark Markula, Arthur Rock, etc. With their hard work Apple managed to become a leading company in manufacture of micro-computer in the world at the beginning of the company journey. Of course managing a company like Apple is not just a walk in the park, even for the genius like Steve Jobs. Tumultous events marred Steve Jobs's life in mid 1980's just after he seemingly acquire success in such a young age. He recruited John Sculley from Pepsi for CEO position (with the famous persuasion from Jobs to Sculley \"Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugar water or do you want a chance to change the world?\") and how he regret this decision in the furute as Sculley later on became his mortal enemy and one of the main actor that kick him out from Apple in 1985. His other half, Steve Wozniak, also leave him, and Apple as well, after series of dispute and argument as to how should Apple as company should be directed (Woz plane accident also play its role as the pretext for him to leave the company). Outside of work, Steve Jobs personal life was also such a havoc as he has a bitter conflict with his former girlfriend, Chrissan Brennan, about a daughter that Steve Jobs rejected as an offspring (after DNA test, it was proven that the daughter, Lisa, is Steve Jobs legitimate children. Lisa would later on become the name of one computer product created by Steve Jobs). Steve Jobs life was some sort of an extreme roller coaster in that period, as he managed to grab the elusive success on early 80's but from middle to end of this decade he found himself sidelined from his own company and he forced to start all over again from scratch, in the shape of his new computer company, NEXT.\n\nWhat happened after all those heartbreaks is probably the greatest comeback even for a tech genius like Steve Jobs. This man simply refused to give up. in NEXT, Steve Jobs managed to release computer products that fit the perfectionist creed that he regards highly. Jobs run this company with his obsession toward aesthetic perfection at its extremity that border insanity. NEXT workstation and NEXTcube were released by Jobs, which are intended to be utilised by education sector. The sales number was not so good for his products at NEXT, because the technical stregth and advance designed rendered the products to be pricy, but nevertheless Steve Jobs arguably contends with this result. Thereafter his artistic instict brought him to the course of collision with by then a relatively unknown graphic group called Pixar. He gave fund, around 10 million dolar, to the company to enable them to produce computer animated film. Steve Jobs became the executive producer for Pixar's first franchise movie, Toy Story. The rest was history. The collaboration between Steve Jobs and John Lasseter, an animator and fellow executive producer, proved to be an enormous success as every animation films produced by Pixar were received in positive light by both consumer and critics. Disney would then purchased Pixar, and made Jobs as Disney's largest single share owner at around 7% (till this day Jobs's family is still keeping this fair amount of stock). The lion is back on the game, and he has some unfinished business with his old flame.\n\nA quaint twist of fate has coalesced Steve Jobs walk of life with Apple once again after their previous bitter seperation, and almost everyone in a hindsight thought that this is inevitable. Apple in middle of 1990 has pretty much lost their battle in home computer market against IBM, and by that time no longer reckoned as a special company. John Sculley was no longer at the helm, but the replacement, Gil Amelio, was as clueless as Sculley in term of steering the ship for Apple. After myriad of raising eyebrow decisions made by Gil Amelio that cost Apple their market share, at the very least he made one crucial decision that later on will save Apple (ironically though, this decision will be so detrimental to Gil Amelio himself). Apple by that time was in need of graphical operating system, and NEXT turns out to be a company that was developing one just like that called NextSTEP. Long story short, Apple under the direction from Gil Amelio purchased NEXT owned by Steve Jobs in order to acquire NEXT technology for no less than 427 million dollars. This event paved the comeback path for the prodigy, Steve Jobs, to the company that he co-founded. This proved to be the right decision as Steve Jobs managed to get Apple back on track by terminating number of useless projects (and terminating Gil Amelio as CEO as well), and in overall make Apple a more efficient company to run.\n\nAfter the second coming of Steve Jobs at Apple, the company become such an unstoppable force that manage to release magnificent products that catch the imagination and entushiasm of customer and alike. An appealing design and powerful brand were the mantra for Apple to achieve sucess. Steve Jobs persona became inseperable with Apple and it only makes it better. Under Steve Jobs leadership, Apple has created plethora of industry changing product such as iMac, iPod, iPhone, iPad, etc. Even Bill Gates reluctantly has to admit that Steve Jobs has the nose for good idea and transformed it into a great products. After overcoming all adversities, hurdle, and heart breaks Steve Jobs finally managed to transform Apple into one of the most valuable company in the history of this planet. In 2003 Steve Jobs was diagnosed with cancer, and after 8 years waging the war with the dissease that he contracted in 2011 the iCEO finally bade farewell to the mundane world.\n\nThat was the extract of Steve Jobs life story, for certain you can get more insight and detail reading the biography from Walter Isaacson.\n\nThe Life Lesson from \"Steve Jobs\" by Walter Isaacson\n\nSteve Jobs is, for some people who have known him persoanlly, as attested from myriad of stories and confession from friends, former lovers, business associate, former employee, etc. an outright jerk. There is perhaps an extreme polarization between people who perceived Steve Jobs as some kind of technological messiah, and people who despised him for his antics and how cruel he was to a lot of people he came across (never really into philanthropy despite his wealth, ridiculous rejection toward his legitimate daughter from Chrisann Brennan, his stinginess even to special people in his life, his frequent terrible outburst toward his employee and coworker whenever he felt unsatisfied, the list goes on and on). A person closed to him in Apple even go as far as to perceived him as \"a person who found catharsis by hurting other people's feeling\". Steven Paul Jobs is not a perfect man, and in this post of mine in particular I won't act as a judge for his character. Isaacson put it out, regarding to this matter, that this flaw of Jobs in particular is bothering him rather than helping him achieve his goal. According to Jobs himself, he feels that someone need to be super honest when it came to working on a product, take a harsh decision whenever necessary, and he will always be happy to be the person that eventually do all those things. He is not a kind hearted leader for sure, but arguably evaluating the end result, Steve is an effective leader.\n\nWhen it comes to the brighter sides of Steve Jobs, this book will offer you plethora of wisdom from the life of a man who in Walter Isaacson opinion could be placed in the same pantheon temple of greats man such as Henry Ford and Thomas Edison. You can easily find Steve Jobs legendary stories, anecdote, quotes, and creeds on various source in the Internet nowaday. Chances are, you have stumbled upon the infamous skirmish between Steve Jobs and Bill Gates during the early phase of Apple exploit (their exchange about stealing idea was so hilarious and epic), or inspired by enlightening Steve Jobs quote such as \"Stay foolish, stay hungry\", \"simplicity is the ultimate sophistication\", etc. What I will convey in this post is hopefully part of Steve Jobs wisdom which is not as widely recognised as the aforemention stuff. In the final chapter of the book, as the closure, Walter Isaacson gave the opportunity for Steve Jobs himself to conclude the story of his life, and for what Steve Jobs conveyed is profound and touching. Steve Jobs reveals that his main goal is to establish a long lasting and succesful company stacked with people whose aspiration is to create marvelous products. Other than that is not essential. For Steve Jobs, profit is certainly important, but the urge to make a great product must outweight the desire to achieve big profit. He always tries to find something new. Steve mentions how his hero in music, Bob Dylan, was booed by his own crowd when he played \"Like a Rolling Stone\" with electric guitar. Dylan subsequently shouted \"Play it harder!\". Thats what it's all about for Steve. Perpetually keep on the motion to develop himself. Finally when he explains what is his drive to do all these things that has been done it is simply his desire to express his deepest feeling with the talents that he has in his disposal. According to Jobs, because he can't write a song like Bob Dylan or create music like Tom Stoppard he opt to express his deepest feeling through Apple products.\n\nTo conclude this potst, In my hy humble opinion, if somehow you are at some point in your life where you need inspiration to find your craft or just wanted to keep on going, I recommend this book, Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson, for you to read."
