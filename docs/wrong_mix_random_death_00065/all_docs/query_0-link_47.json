        "text": "It is never a good thing when anyone loses their job. However, Henderson County to its credit has tried, in cutting 10 staff positions, to do it in a logical way that responds to services affected by the recession.\n\nThe Board of Commissioners on Nov. 3 approved a plan to cut the positions as part of County Manager Steve Wyatt’s effort to trim $1.48 million from the budget. While the cuts are painful, as job losses always are for those affected, the county deserves credit for shrinking government to respond to the worst economic downturn in decades.\n\nCounty administration is trying “to get ahead of the curve before we really have to make drastic cuts,” said Pam Brice, public information officer. “We are making adjustments in areas where service demands are down or efficiencies are being implemented.”\n\nPositions are being cut in inspections, environmental health and at the solid waste transfer station where demand for services is down. The county reported on Monday the amount of waste disposed of at the transfer station dropped to 5,530 tons last month, the smallest amount in three years and 21 percent below average. Less waste being thrown away reflects the downturn in construction and retail.\n\n“A lot of trash comes from construction demolition and there is a lot less of that going on, fewer people are moving, and people just don’t throw as much stuff away,” said Adrienne Outcalt, sustainability coordinator. “People tend to be a lot less wasteful when times are tighter.”\n\nWyatt has tried to use a scalpel rather than a chain saw with his plan to lay off 10 workers and freeze another 10 open positions. In determining where to cut, he tried to target recurring expenses and ones that would have a minimal impact on services that directly affect health and safety.\n\nWith construction slumping, it makes sense that the county would trim two positions and freeze two others in building services, a move expected to save $160,900. The county also cut 1.5 positions in code enforcement, saving $38,000; and froze one position and cut 3.5 jobs as well as travel and training for the library, saving $132,500.\n\nOther major cuts include $181,200 in information technology, where one position and travel and training were frozen and hardware/software purchases delayed; and $121,000 at the Sheriff’s Office, including two administrative positions were cut.\n\nAn audit of last year’s county budget released last week showed the county in good financial shape going into the recession. Erica Brown, a CPA with Martin Starnes and Associates CPA, which audited the budget, said county department heads did a good job of containing their budgets.\n\nHenderson County is not alone in having to make painful cuts. North Carolina has withheld $58 million from its 110 school districts, including $517,956 from Henderson County Public Schools. That amounts to $39.25 per student based on an enrollment of 13,196. The state has also told Blue Ridge Community College to give back more than $305,000 in recent months despite a 9 percent increase in fall enrollment.\n\nThe recession touches all of us, most of all those who lose their jobs. The best we can hope for during such trying times is that our leaders, like all of us, will make the best plan to weather the storm."
