It’s sleek, it covers all…assets, it gives me confidence and it pays homage to an innovator I’ve always admired — Steve Jobs.\n\nI remember having every iPod, watching every product announcement live, and when I could, keeping up with his latest releases.\n\nIn my last year of middle school, I witnessed his most impactful product launch Yet.\n\n“Ipod. Phone! Ipod… Phone! Do You Get It Yet? It’s Not Two Products, It’s One! And We Are Calling It, The IPhone.”\n\n- Steve Jobs, 2007"
