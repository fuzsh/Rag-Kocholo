        "text": "Steve Jobs was Apple's co-founder, CEO, and chairman of the board. Born Steven Paul Jobs on February 24, 1955, he co-founded Apple with Steve Wozniak on April 1, 1976.\n\nDuring his first tenure at Apple, Jobs helped bring the Apple II and Mac to the market, revolutionizing command-line and graphical user interface computing respectively. After returning to Apple as CEO, Jobs brought the iMac, iPod, iTunes, Apple Stores, iPhone, and iPad to market, revolutionizing digital music and music selling, retail, smartphones, and tablets. He passed away on October 5, 2011, the day after the introduction of the iPhone 4s. Outside of Apple, Jobs also founded NeXT, on whose technologies OS X was based, and turned Pixar into a movie power house before selling it to Disney."
