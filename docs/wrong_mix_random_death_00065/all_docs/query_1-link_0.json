        "text": "2011 authorized biography by Walter Isaacson\n\nSteve Jobs is the authorized self-titled biography of American business magnate and Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. The book was written at the request of Jobs by Walter Isaacson, a former executive at CNN and Time who had previously written best-selling biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Albert Einstein.[1][2]\n\nBased on more than 40 interviews with Jobs conducted over two years—in addition to interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues—Isaacson was given \"unprecedented\" access to Jobs's life.[3] Jobs is said to have encouraged the people interviewed to speak honestly. Although Jobs cooperated with the book, he asked for no control over its content other than the book's cover, and waived the right to read it before it was published. Describing his writing, Isaacson commented that he had striven to take a balanced view of his subject that did not sugarcoat Jobs's flaws.[5]\n\nThe book was released on October 24, 2011, by Simon & Schuster in the United States, 19 days after Jobs's death.[6]\n\nA film adaptation written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by Danny Boyle, with Michael Fassbender starring in the title role, was released on October 9, 2015.\n\nThe front cover uses a photo of Steve Jobs commissioned by Fortune magazine in 2006 for a portfolio of powerful people. The photograph was taken by Albert Watson.\n\nWhen the photograph was taken, he said he insisted on having a three-hour period to set up his equipment, adding that he wanted to make \"[every shoot] as greased lightning fast as possible for the [subject].\" When Jobs arrived he didn't immediately look at Watson, but instead at the equipment, focusing on Watson's 4×5 camera before saying, \"wow, you're shooting film.\"[8]\n\nIf you look at that shot, you can see the intensity. It was my intention that by looking at him, that you knew this guy was smart. I heard later that it was his favorite photograph of all time.\n\nJobs gave Watson an hour—longer than he had given most photographers for a portrait session. Watson reportedly instructed Jobs to make \"95 percent, almost 100 percent of eye contact with the camera,\" and to \"think about the next project you have on the table,\" in addition to thinking about instances when people have challenged him.[8]\n\nThe title font is Helvetica.[9]\n\nThe back cover uses another photographic portrait of Jobs taken in his living room in Woodside, California in February 1984 by Norman Seeff. In a Behind the Cover article published by Time magazine, Seeff recalls him and Jobs \"just sitting\" on his living room floor, talking about \"creativity and everyday stuff,\" when Jobs left the room and returned with a Macintosh 128K (the original Macintosh computer). Jobs \"[plopped] down\" in the lotus position holding the computer in his lap when Seeff took the photograph.[10]\n\nWe did do a few more shots later on, and he even did a few yoga poses—he lifted his leg and put it over his shoulder—and I just thought we were two guys hanging out, chatting away, and enjoying the relationship. It wasn't like there was a conceptualization here—this was completely off the cuff, spontaneity that we never thought would become an iconic image.\n\nThe book's working title, iSteve: The Book of Jobs, was chosen by publisher Simon & Schuster's publicity department. Although author Walter Isaacson was \"never quite sure about it\", his wife and daughter reportedly were. However, they thought it was \"too cutesy\" and as a result Isaacson persuaded the publisher to change the title to something \"simpler and more elegant.\"[11]\n\nThe title Steve Jobs was allegedly chosen to reflect Jobs's \"minimalist\" style and to emphasize the biography's authenticity, further differentiating it from unauthorized publications, such as iCon Steve Jobs: The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business by Jeffrey Young.[12]\n\nMany of the chapters within the book have sub-headings, which are matched in various audiobook versions resulting in listings showing 150+ chapters when there are only 42 chapters. The audiobook contains a mistake on one chapter title, listing Chapter 41 as \"Round Three, A Never-ending Struggle\" instead of \"Round Three, Twilight Struggle\" as published.\n\nChapter number Chapter title Sub-heading number Sub-heading title Approx. audiobook mark Introduction How this book came to be 00:00:00 Chapter 1 Childhood, Abandoned and Chosen 1.1 The Adoption 00:13:02 1.2 Silicon Valley 00:25:21 1.3 School 00:42:39 Chapter 2 Odd Couple, The Two Steves 2.1 Woz 01:05:56 2.2 The Blue Box 01:21:37 Chapter 3 The Dropout, Turn On, Tune in... 3.1 Chrisann Brennan 01:30:36 3.2 Reed College 01:35:05 3.3 Robert Friedland 01:46:22 3.4 ...Drop Out 01:54:33 Chapter 4 Atari and India, Zen and the Art of Game Design 4.1 Atari 01:59:40 4.2 India 02:06:39 4.3 The Search 02:15:38 4.4 Breakout 02:26:07 Chapter 5 The Apple I, Turn On, Boot Up, Jack In... 5.1 Machines of Loving Grace 02:33:32 5.2 The Homebrew Computer Club 02:42:29 5.3 Apple is Born 02:51:56 5.4 Garage Band 03:04:24 Chapter 6 The Apple II, Dawn of a New Age 6.1 An Integrated Package 03:13:27 6.2 Mike Markkula 03:23:38 6.3 Regis McKenna 03:34:26 6.4 The First Launch Event 03:38:11 6.5 Mike Scott 03:41:30 Chapter 7 Chrisann and Lisa, He Who Is Abandoned... 03:51:29 Chapter 8 Xerox and Lisa, Graphical User Interface 8.1 A New Baby 04:06:51 8.2 Xerox PARC 04:13:56 8.3 Great Artists Steal 04:22:35 Chapter 9 Going Public, A Man of Wealth and Fame 9.1 Options 04:32:45 9.2 Baby You're a Rich Man 04:38:28 Chapter 10 The Mac is Born, You Say You Want a Revolution 10.1 Jef Raskin's Baby 04:46:11 10.2 Texaco Towers 04:59:56 Chapter 11 The Reality Distortion Field, Playing by His Own Set of Rules 05:06:51 Chapter 12 The Design, Real Artists Simplify 12.1 A Bauhaus Aesthetic 05:26:42 12.2 Like a Porsche 05:34:31 Chapter 13 Building The Mac, The Journey Is The Reward 13.1 Competition 05:52:12 13.2 End-to-end Control 05:57:32 13.3 Machines of the Year 06:03:10 13.4 Let's Be Pirates!

Maslin wrote that Isaacson's biography presented \"an encyclopedic survey of all that Mr. Jobs accomplished, replete with the passion and excitement that it deserves.\"[13]\n\nA number of Steve Jobs's family and close colleagues expressed disapproval, including Laurene Powell Jobs, Tim Cook and Jony Ive.[14][5][15] Cook remarked that the biography did Jobs \"a tremendous disservice\", and that \"it didn't capture the person. The person I read about there is somebody I would never have wanted to work with over all this time.\"[5] Ive said of the book that \"my contempt couldn't be lower.\"[14][5]\n\nCommercially, the biography was a notable success, selling more than three million copies in the United States alone by 2015.[5]\n\nMain article: Steve Jobs (film)\n\nSteve Jobs is a drama film based on the life of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, starring Michael Fassbender in the title role. The film is directed by Danny Boyle, produced by Scott Rudin, and written by Aaron Sorkin (with a screenplay adapted both from Isaacson's Steve Jobs as well as from interviews conducted by Sorkin).\n\nExtracts from the biography have been the feature of various magazines, in addition to interviews with the author, Walter Isaacson.[16]\n\nTo memorialize Jobs's life after his death on October 5, 2011, TIME published a commemorative issue on October 8, 2011. The issue's cover featured a portrait of Jobs, taken by Norman Seeff, in which he is sitting in the lotus position holding the original Macintosh computer. The portrait was published in Rolling Stone in January 1984 and is featured on the back cover of Steve Jobs. The issue marked the eighth time Jobs has been featured on the cover of Time.[17] The issue included a photographic essay by Diana Walker, a retrospective on Apple by Harry McCracken and Lev Grossman, and a six-page essay by Walter Isaacson. Isaacson's essay served as a preview of Steve Jobs and described Jobs pitching the book to him.[18]\n\nBloomberg Businessweek also released a commemorative issue of its magazine remembering the life of Jobs. The cover of the magazine features Apple-like simplicity, with a black-and-white, up-close photo of Jobs and his years of birth and death. In tribute to Jobs's minimalist style, the issue was published without advertisements. It featured extensive essays by Steve Jurvetson, John Sculley, Sean Wisely, William Gibson, and Walter Isaacson. Similarly to Time's commemorative issue, Isaacson's essay served as a preview of Steve Jobs.\n\nFortune featured an exclusive extract of the biography on October 24, 2011, focusing on the \"friend-enemy\" relationship Jobs had with Bill Gates.[19]\n\nEven after a late release that year, the book became Amazon's #1 seller for 2011.[20]\n\n2012 Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award, shortlist[21]\n\n2011 The New York Times bestseller\n\n2011 Christian Science Monitor Best Book, nonfiction\n\n2011 Time Magazine's Best Books of the Year\n\nBiography portal\n\nBooks portal\n\nHistory portal\n\n2011 in literature\n\nApple Inc. development history"
