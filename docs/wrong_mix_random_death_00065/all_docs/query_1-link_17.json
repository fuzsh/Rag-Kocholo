        "text": "Excellent story of a sad little sociopath\n\nI've read other semi-biographies of Jobs and, working with a lot of people in the tech industry, I'd heard many of the stories of how much of a bastard he was. However, this biography left me quite bemused and surprised: I never expected Jobs to be such a disgustingly-shameless-sociopath-brat-cry-baby! even to the last minute, with Jobs having to have control over the cover image of the book.\n\nI don't think he would have liked much of what is inside this book; which is what makes it great.\n\nIt's amazing that Jobs sought out Isaacson to write this biography. And Isaacson, pre-warning Jobs that he was going to uncover all the dirt, delivers a very inhuman story. In Isaacson other book on Einstein, he also revealed Albert's many flaws and brought Albert down to our level. With this book, he absolutely devastates the image of Jobs as a great business leader and as human being: from his stinky hippy days, to his denial of his daughter Lisa and smear campaign of the mother, to his tyrannical and plainly mean way he constantly ripped-off and mistreated other people.\n\nI guess Job's own reflection of his life must have been also distorted by his \"reality distortion field\". It's great that this book came out when it did. If anything, it shows that Steve Jobs was not in the same league as other great inventors and geniuses of the past century. Jobs just rode on the great ideas of those around him. If it was him that made those ideas successful is unclear, so Jobs is just shown as part of the greater collective that was, and remains, Apple computers.\n\nI anything, it's good that Isaacson shows why no one should take inspiration from the cold, hard, tyrannical a**hole that was Steve Jobs. A great read! And proof you can't judge a book by its cover.\n\nBrat, Business man, Visionary?\n\nWalter Isaacson has written an honest and thought provoking biography of Steve Jobs. He has been able to show how Steve Jobs' personality has evolved, although the trademarks of brat, business man and visionary were always lurking in the background. I think this biography do more than pay homage to Jobs, it also can serve as a history - be it from a specific point of view - of Silicon Valley and more so the Apple company.\n\nDylan Baker reading didn't impressed me so much. It was fair, yet not as engaging as I would've expect. At times I had to rewind to relisten as I opted out, and it was definitely not because of the content.\n\nHowever, this biography comes highly recommended as Steve Jobs' story is one that deserves to be listened to.\n\nA interesting look at Jobs, warts and all\n\nI'm not normally a biography reader. However Apple has become so ingrained in society that the story behind its founding and one of the men who made it the most valuable company on the planet makes for a fantastic read. Perhaps it also drew me in because I love technology.\n\nThe story is told warts and all. We see how Jobs could be a fantastic motivator and also a cold and callous spirit-breaker. But his ability to create incredible designs by merging art with technology has made for elegant products the world has fallen in love with. The book also gives us a look at all of the main players in Jobs' and Apple's life (as well as his competitors). These people were just as important as Jobs in creating a lasting technological marvel of a company.\n\nBaker's narration is smooth and engaging and never falters the whole way through. Anyone interested in technology owes it to themselves to listen to this, whether you are a fan of Apple or not.\n\nA story that suffuses the listener with awe\n\nEnjoyed listening to the biography of a man who embodied all that was human Perhaps he rode roughshod over some but always those persons would have turned out to be better human beings. Truth can never be compromised and that message comes screaming when we delve into Steve's life.\n\nExcellent book, indifferently read\n\nAn excellent biography which provides a sympathetic and convincing portrayal of Jobs, while not disguising his faults. Unfortunately, the reader appears not to have rehearsed sufficiently. When he comes across a new name he pauses momentarily as though unsure how to pronounce it, putting odd verbal quotes around names."
