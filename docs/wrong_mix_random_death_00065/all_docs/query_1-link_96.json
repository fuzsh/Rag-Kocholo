        "text": "1-Sentence-Summary: Steve Jobs is the most detailed and accurate account of the life of the man who created Apple, the most valuable technology company in the world.\n\nRead in: 4 minutes\n\nFavorite quote from the author:\n\nMy mum gave me Steve Jobs for St. Nicholas Day in 2011, shortly after it had been released (3 weeks after his death). It’s a massive read, but a fascinating one.\n\nWritten by Walter Isaacson, former CEO of CNN and managing editor of Time Magazine, it is not only the most detailed and accurate book about Steve Job’s life, but also the only authorized one, since he wrote the book with Steve’s consent.\n\nIsaacson conducted over 40 interviews with Steve Jobs over the last 2 years leading up to his death. Here are 3 interesting things I learned from the summary, which you probably won’t find elsewhere:\n\nSteve Jobs’s team invented a name for his most important skill, the reality distortion field.\n\nThe Apple name was chosen for a very specific reason.\n\nApple didn’t make Steve Jobs a billionaire, Pixar did.\n\nLet’s take a good hard look at those facts!\n\nLesson 1: Steve Jobs’s reality distortion field got its name from his team.\n\nThe skill that allowed Steve Jobs to create this huge vision for Apple out of nothing was not his obsession for detail, nor his sense for design, simplicity, or aesthetics.\n\nIt was his reality distortion field, or RDF in short. The phrase was originally coined by Bud Tribble, part of Steve’s Macintosh team, who borrowed the term from Star Trek.\n\nTalking about Steve’s RDF became a thing, and what it meant, was this:\n\nOnce Steve decided that something should happen, he would bend reality to his will until it came true.\n\nThis extended to everyone around him. His RDF is how he could convince a sleepless team of engineers to work another 10 hours on Macintosh fonts, because it would be the greatest computer in the world.\n\nHe also used it to make sure anyone who left an official Apple keynote was convinced the product they just saw was the best in its industry.\n\nBy using charisma, hyperbole, marketing and persistence, Steve would pull impossible feats into the realm of the possible for himself and his audience, allowing him to create what has become the most valuable technology company in the world.\n\nLesson 2: There is one major reason for Apple’s name.\n\nThe first thing anyone wonders about upon learning about Apple and its products is where the hell it got that name. They’re not selling smoothie makers, after all.\n\nOf course there are several reasons for the name, one being that Steve was often experimenting with fruitarian diets, and, since he really liked apples, had been on an apple farm the same day the name had to be decided for official filing to the government.\n\nAnother reason is that “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication”, a quote by Leonardo DaVinci, was the slogan for Apple’s first brochure, and Steve felt the apple symbolized this quote really well.\n\nBut the one major reason for Apple’s name has nothing to do with personal preferences and symbolism, it’s a simple, clear-cut business decision: Apple comes before Atari in the phonebook.\n\nSteve had worked at Atari before, and didn’t want people to see his competitor first, when looking for a computer company.\n\nI’m not sure if “Phaser Beam Computers” was ever in play (Matrix Electronics definitely was), but the discussion about the name is also one of the funniest scenes of the 2013 Jobs movie.\n\nLesson 3: Steve Jobs did not become a billionaire from Apple products, but from Pixar’s IPO.\n\nHave you ever wondered who Steve Jobs became a billionaire? Everyone assumes all of his money came from Apple, but his bank account actually made the biggest jump on a whole other project.\n\nAfter being fired from Apple in 1985, Steve really sunk his teeth into two projects: NeXT and Pixar.\n\nTeeth in this case also means money. Steve paid a $100,000 flat fee, for the logo design for NeXT alone. That, next to countless delays and some other costly production standard demands made NeXT a black hole where money disappeared like nothing.\n\nIn the Pixar case, Steve purchased a majority share of the company (80%) from George Lucas for $5 million in 1986, and invested another $5 million right into the company.\n\nBy 1995, Steve’s total Pixar bill had racked up to a grand total of $50 million. He often considered selling it, until a deal with Disney came through to produce and distribute Toy Story in 1995.\n\nGrossing over $350 million, the movie became the most successful movie of the entire year. This of course led to a very optimistic outlook for the company, which held its initial public offering on November 29, that year.\n\nThe company’s stock was priced at US$22 per share, giving Steve a 20x return on his initial investment and making him a billionaire over night.\n\nHis stocks were now worth $1.2 billion.\n\nSteve Jobs Review\n\nThere are so many details and lessons to be learned from this man’s life, and even though it’s a long read, I can highly recommend the book. If you’re interested in creating a company that outlasts a decade or even a century, making almost addicting products and becoming an awesome CEO, this book is an all-in-one package, just like the Apple II was back in the day.\n\nEven the summary on Blinkist is long (13 blinks), but gives a good overview for anyone who is unsure. May he rest in peace. He was one of the good ones. And he sure ‘thought different.’ So long, Steve Jobs.\n\nWho would I recommend the Steve Jobs summary to?\n\nThe 14 year old computer geek, whose parents tell him that he should learn something that will get him “a proper job”, the 47 year old executive, who found a side project she’s passionate about, but is not sure if she can turn it into reality, and anyone who ever wants to be an entrepreneur.\n\nLast Updated on July 27, 2022"
