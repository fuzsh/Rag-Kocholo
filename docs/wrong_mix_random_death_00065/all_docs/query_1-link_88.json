By putting it all in a book his children will better be able to reflect on their father and contextualize the person they knew at home and the larger than life character we all knew. He could have taken the time to sit down and talk to them and I am sure he did in one way or another, but you can't impart that much information in a conversation. And you certainly can't expect your children to 'get it'. Personally I think him doing it for his kids is fantastic and a luxury only offered to him because of his success. How many people out there would jump at the chance to do the same if they had the means."
