        "text": "Steven Lightfoot is a local entrepreneur and the owner of the Hendersonville Barbers in Hendersonville, Tennessee and Public Square Barbers in Gallatin, Tennessee. Steven has an extensive history as a musician, health and beauty expert, boxer, and consultant. Steven also owns his own line of hair care products. He spent his earlier years traveling the country but decided to explore other passions once his son was born. Steven now spends his time as a father, whose world revolves around his son. His love for entrepreneurship led him to open Hendersonville Barbers in 2017 and Public Square Barbers in 2020, with plans to open a third location soon.\n\nQ: What inspired you or led you to your current profession (or community involvement)?\n\nFor the sake of candor, I was on probation and my life decisions led me to a choice. I had the good fortune of being academically inclined but I made some poor decisions personally. I had a 2-year cisco certification. So, a network pathway is where I was supposed to go. Network engineering had its appeal so I wanted to find something to do but the stock market crashed and the tech bubble burst so no one was hiring system admins and nobody was building networks. So, I decided to go to hair school to pay for an electrical engineering degree. No scholarships were available to me. No family money to make it. My mother signed a personal loan for me to go to hair school in my town behind my dad’s back and something really really clicked. I think it is most important to say about my coming into becoming and stylist/barber, people were genuinely happy with what I was able to do for them and their positive response build my self-confidence and gave me an honest path to success and I never forgot that and I never turned my back on them and I was able to turn it into a dream. I am a first-generation hair stylist and for the first 16 years of my career I did women’s hair for the most part. I don’t discriminate, male, female, gay, straight, black, white, you are all welcome in my chair! This business gave me that mindset. Being a barber, I might see 16 people a day. That is 16 different ethnic backgrounds, 16 different perspectives on life, 16 different religions, 16 different stories and these people should all be welcome, and through this, has given me that world view. I know about their families and their food, their culture and what makes them happy. You are there for their weddings and funerals and cancer and remission. It is my passion now but it didn’t start that way.\n\nQ: What do you enjoy most about what you do?\n\nThe people are what I enjoy most. EVERYBODY. From the barbers themselves, an individual trying to apply craft or a trade. Something that is truly in and of its essence blue collar. I don’t see a difference between a hairstylist that does female hair and a barber. We are in a male-centric environment in the “barber shop” now. Not only the people that are applying the craft and creating happiness for others, it’s a reciprocating thing. The people that sit down and are genuinely respectful and kind and seeing them be happier is the best thing. It’s the people. It’s the people doing the job and the people sitting down. For better or for worse. And being part of the community at Hendersonville Barber being as popular as it has become, we attribute 100% to the community circling around us seeing the service being high quality and taking it out into the world. But specifically, in Hendersonville we have a good community of individuals that are family at this point. As a group of barbers, we want to do the best possible work every single time and we hire based on that premise. We have been open for 17 months in Hendersonville and we have never fired an employee and we have never had anybody quit and that says a lot about a business. Each person that comes into the shop is an individual, not just a number and a guard. We don’t have to be fancy or pretty or a bougie solon to see that. We are men in our own right but we also take what we do at individual levels. You sit down and its like “hi how ya doing. How can I help you? What can make you feel the best” and then here is my suggestion. The difference between an amature and a professional is not the money, it’s the opinion. We have an opinion. We believe this will work the best for you. Can I do that for you? And if we can see something you cannot see in yourself then we will have a client for life. We would put our barbers against anyone in the country.\n\nQ: What other hobbies, passions or community projects take up your free time?\n\nSo outside of the entrepreneurial stuff my son is first priority. He is 4 and a half now. I don’t think there is a better hobby in the world for a man other than watching his son succeed, even in whatever menial small toy or even counting. As far as recreational hobbies, I play guitar and read a lot. I am an avid music listener. I absolutely love restaurants. Being called an artist is the highest compliment you’ll ever be given. I don’t ever call myself an artist. When you can transcend your craft and to the point someone thinks it’s magic. That’s what art is. I see the same things in food. I like restaurants for that. Can they make that magic and create a dish that’s awesome? So, I love good restaurants. I love good food in general so I enjoy cooking at home.\n\nQ: What was the happiest time in your adult life? Why?\n\nThe birth of my son was the pinnacle of the most confusion and scary from where an emotional state is concerned. That’s it! Not joyous and grandiose but very real. It is a really interesting thing and it is individual for each person but that is the pinnacle of my adult life. But I will say, the happiest and most joy I have ever received in my life is from teaching what I do and helping someone achieve. Like, it’s amazing when you finish a service and somebody feels and looks better than they did when they walked it. That’s one thing, little blimps of joy on the radar. But when you help guide somebody into a profession in which they can have even half the joy, half the monetary gain, and half the happiness that you were able to achieve, that’s kind of the pinnacle of my adult life outside of my boy, is watching younger generations that may have never thought that this was a permanent home for them. Maybe a wayward soul lost in finding comfort in becoming a barber or a stylist. And then watching them succeed. Having them say “thank you” maybe 5 or 6 years later. They found that that moment in time of you teaching them in a class environment or you mentoring them through a process gave them hope. That is what I will retire doing.\n\nQ: What is a hurdle that you had to overcome in pursuing your goals/dreams? How did you overcome/ get through it?\n\nI think that the essence and spirit of the entrepreneur if nothing is a hurdle but there are difficulties. I think one of the biggest challenges is letting go of the money. I have never been somebody who wants to stack dollar bills and I don’t use money as a scorecard. My success as an entrepreneur is that for 18 years I have done what I wanted on my terms. That doesn’t mean that it isn’t difficult to deal with it. I don’t have any monetary partners in my business currently. I have been able to make enough on my own terms to be able to fund my own projects, but I have lost too. To get where I am I have taken major financial damage and had to rebuild it. When I had a son I decided to stop traveling around the world which was a massive financial loss. I retired essentially to be a father. I think that is one of the biggest hurdles, was to reincarnate. To die as a vice president and then to come back as a barber shop owner. To die as a single man flying around the world and having all of this social media presence and then all of a sudden become a father. Those are the big things that if anybody is out there trying to do this as an entrepreneur. It’s being able to change and to let things go and rebuild them in another capacity. But chase what you love. People say it all the time “you need the money” it will come but if you do what you love you and you can continue to work and if you work then the money will come. So everything I have done at least I have wanted to. Nothing was by force.\n\nQ: Where do you see yourself in the next few years?\n\nWe are going to open a third barber shop next year and then we are going to open up a school. To have stumbled upon this particular business and to have been so successful and pleased with what I was able to do in it. If I can pass that along and give the highest level of education in a private school setting. Removing the corporate schools that dominate the landscape and doing it in Sumner County we will probably do it in Hendersonville right behind Hendersonville Barbers in the same building and we will call it the Hendersonville Barber Academy. We are looking for partners in that. The barber shops are owned by me but we will need a little extra money to do the school. That’s the goal. To see the lights come on for these kids and young adults and to help them have a job in one of our shops or somebody else’s so they can have a life for their family and do what I have done for mine.\n\nQ: What is something interesting that most people don’t know about you?\n\nI make ice cream and I make it really well. Balsamic, strawberry and black pepper is my current favorite flavor. It’s like a deep thick mud in a balsamic as a ribbon so as opposed to like fudge. Just think of a really natural strawberry flavor with just a slight ribbon of balsamic vinegar. That combination with the acidity of the balsamic and the sweetness from the strawberries is pretty mind blowing! (Follow Steve’s ice cream page @icecreamageddon on Instagram)\n\nQ: What sets your community service project, career, or business apart from others?\n\nWe are professional. We are not business people that own a barbershop. We do the job. We know what it takes to be good. We train based on the quality of our own service, not what we have heard from somebody else; that to me is absolute integrity. Authenticity is the one thing you cannot buy. So, we are a barber owned business. We are business people after the fact. I have been in business for 18 years in much larger scale and some smaller scale operations. But we are first and foremost we do the job. We are pros. We live here. We built this based around the community in which we reside. 2017 isn’t that long ago but when I put my name on a house here I am part of this community and we embrace this as home. We are here to serve the community. We are here for you all to come here and have the best experience you possibly can. That’s the difference between a corporate chain or a business person owned chain. We are authentic. We are real.\n\nQ: Who has been the most influential person in your life? Why?\n\nThe architect for a quality male is my father. The architect for a quality female is my mother. As Freudian as that may sound, they are still together after 37 years. They are passionate about each other. They are wonderful at their jobs, their chosen professions. My mother has been a public-school teacher for 44 years in special ed as a speech pathologist. At this point, she is by definition a saint. She has helped young people and what she has done for her community is probably why I do what I do, subconsciously. My father is 26 years enlisted military. These are servants of their community at different levels. Those are kind of what I have in my genetics and my teaching and my upbringing. I was just able to channel it through barbering, styling, through hair and through business. I have done it all in that spectrum of health and beauty and that is the arena in which I fight in. But those two individuals are the total of my motivations.\n\nQ: Where do you find your motivation to do better? What/who inspires you?\n\nThere are a couple of different theories but I guess I can’t define myself very well. I am sure there are better people to ask why the hell I do what I do than me. For real. The greatest challenge in life is going to be the man in the mirror. That’s the only thing that you should ever have to fight. Maybe it is an inferiority complex or some sort of insecurity of failure or maybe there is someone that needs me more. Any of those things gets me up to go and help to do hair. I have someone in my chair that needs me to be a hell of a lot more to be stronger. I get up hundreds of days out of the year and that is why. I may not have been okay or I may have been going through personal battles or familial battles but to walk in the shop in the morning and feel that way that you do, watch somebody smile, watch somebody look and feel better than they did when they sat down, and then they pay me for it. It doesn’t get any better. This happens 8 times a day. There are guys who stand on stage and sing front of 50,000 and they get this massive burst of endorphins and feedback. I get it in little trickles every day of my life. That motivating factor, personal or otherwise, that has kept me moving. It’s funny, whatever I do in the business, travel, tv, corporate, building a shop, I have never not done the root. I have never not done the hair. I have never left it. The connection with the human is the motivating factor. The teaching, again that being the pinnacle of my adult life. That’s the stuff. That’s the frosting in the Oreo man!\n\nQ: What is one thing you would recommend to enhance our Sumner County community?\n\nTo not opine politically. Sumner County has been unbelievably gracious. I like the fact that we had to jump through the hoops. We are in a historic building. We had to do the sign stuff and make sure we were all up to codes but at least it was fluid, we were able to get through it without a lot of bullshit. I have opened businesses in other states and it has been a lot more difficult. I think that the alderman and the mayors need to listen to the small business and see what it takes for them. We have these massive rebuilding areas like Indian Lake but not one local business will open there. The overhead and price board the barrier to entry. That is why you have the Barnes and Nobles and Walmarts. Not that these are bad business but where are the Lyncoyas, the Hendersonville Barbers, the Brian’s Motorsports, all on west main trying to make it happen. Grease the wheels for them and listen to them. How do I get more restaurant tours, not by definition of the restaurants downtown but by the kid who just got out of cooking school? How do I help that guy create something that is a staple that is truly from here that can then expand? If you can hone in on what it really takes to be a startup and they can help develop these cheap and recessed areas, Gallatin has tons of them. Come talk to people like me and I can tell you what to do. Then we can become a place on the map instead of just a municipality of Nashville. We have people drive Murfreesboro to see our barbers. That’s what you want. That doesn’t happen with Indian Lake. It happens with kids like Chance Weber. People like us.\n\nQ: What is the best advice that you have ever received, or advice you would like to give our community?\n\nThe best advice that was ever given to me was from a client named Linda Shaw that told me after I had my kid she said “they are tougher than you think and sometimes it’s okay to let them cry” I swear to god that saved me about 100 nights of pain after I had my boy. So as far as helpful advice I will never forget what Linda said.\n\n“Don’t get in your own way” is another piece of advice that Sean Huff told me. I was 24 and coming out of my music career I had 2 chairs and was making great money in the business of doing hair. But we were trying to start a company doing software development to try to help small salons and businesses be able to book their own things. These exist in grand scales now. But be able to book their own clients, do their own marketing and have all of these things in one piece of software. And he said to me “don’t ever get in your own way”. And that can go in a million ways. You can look at that from a financial perspective like “I can’t do that because I don’t have…” Go find it! It can be looked at in a personal sense. I am insecure and I am unable to be.., Don’t get in your own way. Then being ready for success. You won’t have any idea how scared you will be when you start to succeed. When the world starts opening up just don’t get in your own way.\n\nQ: What is something unique or your favorite thing about Sumner County?\n\nSumner County isn’t “Overdone” I am glad to see more homes being built and I like that. Besides Indian Lake it isn’t overly commercially developed in the negative sense. I think they are really trying to keep it a community instead of a business mecha.\n\nQ: What is something on your bucket list?\n\nI want to learn a second language. Probably Spanish out of necessity so it will probably be first. I want to also learn to play the piano.\n\nQ: If you could travel anywhere in the world right now, where would it be?\n\nA new place I have never been is I would really like to go to Russia. St Petersburg and Moscow.\n\nQ: What is your go to band when you can’t decide what to listen to?\n\nRight now, my song of songs is by a band called Smoking Popes and the song is If you don’t care.\n\nQ: What is your favorite movie or TV Show?\n\nI love Harry Potter. Dude, I am not even kidding. I love those movies. I have 6 wands I bought at Universal Studios at Harry Potter World. I am reading the books to my 4-year-old son. I am also a huge fan of a good British baking show.\n\nQ: What 3 words or phrases come to mind when you think of the word HOME?\n\nSafe, Warm, Food"
