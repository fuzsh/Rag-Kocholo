        "text": "Dr. Mitchell was saved at age 17, but soon thereafter went to college where he was under the influence of many professors who promoted evolutionary ideas. He became a theistic evolutionist as he tried to reconcile his new-found faith with the evolutionary worldview set forth in his undergraduate studies and in medical school.\n\nAfter returning home to begin his new medical practice, Dr. Mitchell, after much reading, became convicted of the errors of the evolutionary philosophies he had been taught. God soon opened his eyes to the truth of the biblical record, and he saw that God’s Word was indeed true from the first verse.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Dr. Mitchell met Ken Ham and became an avid supporter of AiG. In 1999, he served as seminar chairman for an extremely well-attended Answers in Genesis conference (featuring Ken) held in Hendersonville, Tennessee (near Nashville).\n\nOver the years, he spoke on creation in many churches and venues, including overseas evangelistic mission efforts to Poland, Ukraine, and Jamaica, leaving a lasting legacy around the world.\n\nDr. Mitchell graduated with a BA with highest honors from the University of Tennessee-Knoxville in 1980 with a major in cell biology. For his superior scholarship during his undergraduate study, he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa Society (the oldest and one of the most respected honor societies in America). Dr. Mitchell subsequently attended Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, where he received his medical degree in 1984.\n\nDr. Mitchell completed his residency at Vanderbilt University Affiliated Hospitals in 1987. He is Board Certified in Internal Medicine. In 1991, he was elected a Fellow of the American College of Physicians (F.A.C.P.). Tommy had a thriving medical practice in his hometown of Gallatin, Tennessee, for 20 years, but, in late 2006, he withdrew from medical practice to pursue creation ministry full time.\n\nSince mid-2005, Dr. Mitchell spoke for Answers in Genesis to thousands of adults, youth, and children in a variety of settings, clearly communicating reasons to trust the Bible and the Creator Christ who wrote it. He has written articles for AiG’s website and other publications, and he was the featured speaker during AiG’s relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina, resulting in a Telly award-winning DVD A God of Suffering?\n\nAs a scientist, physician, and father, Dr. Mitchell had a burden to provide solid answers from the Bible to equip people to stand in the face of personal tragedy and popular evolutionary misinformation. Using communication skills developed over many years of medical practice, he was able to connect with people at all educational levels and unveil truth that changed lives.\n\nTommy also served the ministry as both speaker liaison and technical liaison. He was an avid user of Apple computers and was, most certainly, “a Mac!”\n\nDr. Mitchell was married to Elizabeth (herself a retired obstetrician) for 37 years, and they have three daughters. He enjoyed Martin guitars and anything to do with Bill Monroe (the famous bluegrass musician). He was Ken Ham’s most feared cribbage opponent, taking great pleasure in defeating the boss at every opportunity.\n\nHe kept three websites to offer more information about his ministry and life: www.rtmitchell.com, www.tommysmartins.com, and www.tommysphotos.com.\n\nGreer, J.
