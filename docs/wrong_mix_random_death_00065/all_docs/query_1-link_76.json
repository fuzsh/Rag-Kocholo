        "text": "Musk was interested in an author of Isaacson's standing writing his biography but hadn't decided whether he'd fully cooperate, the report said, citing the sources.\n\nThe people said that Isaacson spoke to Musk on the phone in recent weeks, and planned further calls with Musk in the summer. Isaacson would decide on the project after, they said.\n\nBiographies don't require the subject's approval, but Isaacson wrote Jobs' biography at the former Apple CEO's request. Jobs died in 2011.\n\nSources close to Isaacson told the publication he hadn't written a formal proposal for the book yet.\n\n\"[He] hasn't decided what to do and might change\" his mind, one person close to Isaacson told the outlet.\n\nRead more: ProPublica's billionaire tax data shows the importance of closing 2 key tax loopholes. Here's how.\n\nIn a tweet to author Ben Mezrich in January, Musk said that his work on expanding sustainable energy and space exploration \"doesn't leave time to write books.\" Less than a month later, however, he said on Twitter that he was writing a book about Tesla, SpaceX, and the lessons he'd learned in his career.\n\nIsaacson published \"Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography\" in 2011 after two years of writing and more than 40 interviews with Jobs. Three and a half years after its release, the book had sold 3 million copies in the US alone, Isaacson said.\n\nRelated stories\n\nIsaacson has also written books about Leonardo da Vinci, Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin, and Henry Kissinger.\n\nSources told Fox Business that Isaacson was exploring writing a book about Musk because of the Tesla CEO's rollercoaster career.\n\nThroughout 2021, Musk has flip-flopped with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos as the richest person in the world. Musk is the CEO of electric-car maker Tesla and aerospace giant SpaceX, founder of neurotech company Neuralink, and cofounder of transport-tunnel maker the Boring Company. He also set up the online bank X.com in 1999, which later became PayPal.\n\nMusk has repeatedly said he plans to sell most of his possessions, including all his houses, to fund a colony on Mars. He wants to send 1 million people to the planet by 2050, he has said."
