        "text": "Jobs arrived at that perspective through a lifetime of reading, as reviewed in Walter Isaacson’s 2011 biography and other places. Here’s a breakdown of 15 books that inspired him.\n\n“I started to listen to music a whole lot [in the last two years of high school] and I started to read more outside of just science and technology – Shakespeare, Plato. I loved King Lear,” Jobs told Isaacson.\n\nThe tragedy may have provided a cautionary tale to a young Jobs, since it’s the story of an aged monarch going crazy trying to divide his kingdom.\n\n“King Lear offers a vivid depiction of what can go wrong if you lose your grip on your empire – a story surely fascinating to any aspiring CEO,” says Daniel Smith, author of How to Think Like Steve Jobs.\n\nAnother epic story that coloured Jobs’ outlook in his adolescence was Moby Dick, the deeply American novel by Herman Melville. Isaacson draws a connection between main protagonist Captain Ahab, one of the most driven and wilful characters in literature, and Jobs.\n\nAhab, like Jobs, did a lot of his learning from direct experience, rather than relying on institutions.\n\n“I prospectively ascribe all the honour and the glory to whaling,” the captain writes early in the story, “for a whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.”\n\nThe intellectual flowering that Jobs had in late high school wasn’t confined to hard-charging megalomaniacs – he also discovered a love for verse, particularly Welsh poet Dylan Thomas.\n\nSmith says Thomas’ poems “drew [Jobs] in with its striking new forms and unerringly popular touch”.\n\nIn late 1972, Jobs had just started at Reed College, an elite liberal arts school in Portland, Oregon. He started taking LSD and reading lots of books about spirituality.\n\n“It was profound,” Jobs said. “It transformed me and many of my friends.”\n\nIn that first year at Reed, Jobs also read Diet for a Small Planet, a book about protein-rich vegetarianism that went on to sell 3 million copies. It was a breakthrough.\n\nThe book had another effect on Jobs: it gave him permission to experiment with extreme diets like purging and fasting.\n\nJobs’ diet grew more adventurous after reading Mucusless Diet Healing System by early 20th-century German dietitian Arnold Ehret, who recommended practices such as “intermittent juice fasting”.\n\n“I got into it in my typical nutso way,” Jobs told Isaacson.\n\nJobs also read Autobiography of a Yogi by Indian guru Paramahansa Yogananda when he was in high school. Then he reread it while he stayed at a guest house in the foothills of the Himalayas in India.\n\n“There was a copy there of Autobiography of a Yogi in English that a previous traveller had left, and I read it several times, because there was not a lot to do, and I walked around from village to village and recovered from dysentery.”\n\nUnlike the sickness, the book remained a major part of Jobs’ life. He reread it every year.\n\nAfter Jobs got back from India, his interest in meditation continued to flourish. This is partly thanks to geography (1970s California was the place where Zen Buddhism got its first foothold in America), and Jobs was able to attend classes led by Shunryu Suzuki, the Japanese monk who write Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind.\n\nLike everything else, Jobs went hard into Zen. “He became really serious and self-important and just generally unbearable,” says Daniel Kottke, his best friend at the time.\n\nApple made a habit of disrupting itself. The iPhone, for instance, had lots of the features of the iconic iPod, thus rendering the music device obsolete. Jobs was able to see that this cannibalism was a necessary part of growth thanks to The Innovator’s Dilemma by Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen.\n\nThe book posits that companies get ruined by their own success by staying committed to a product even after technology (and customers) move on, like Blockbuster did with physical movie rentals.\n\nJobs made it clear that the same thing wouldn’t happen to Apple.\n\nKottke recently shared a list of the books he and Jobs read around their time at Reed – ones that inspired Jobs’ travels across the globe as well as his professional pursuits. One of the most influential works on that list is Cosmic Consciousness: A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind, originally published by Canadian psychiatrist Richard Maurice Bucke in 1901.\n\nBased on his own supposed experiences with enlightenment, Bucke makes the case for a higher form of consciousness than the normal person possesses. He outlines three forms of consciousness: the simple consciousness of animals and humans; the self-consciousness of humans, which includes reason and imagination; and cosmic consciousness, which transcends factual understanding.\n\nAround the time they were beginning to explore Buddhism, Kottke said he and Jobs read The Way of the White Clouds by Lama Anagarika Govinda – the autobiography of a Buddhist who was one of the last foreigners to travel through Tibet before the Chinese invasion of 1950. In the book the author recounts his experiences learning about Tibetan culture and tradition.\n\nKottke and Jobs’ literary exploration also included the biography of the 19th-century Hindu saint Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa by Christopher Isherwood, originally published in 1965.\n\nFans of Ramakrishna and His Disciples say Isherwood refrains from preaching and passing judgment on Ramakrishna’s teachings. Instead, he helps readers understand how the saint became so widely influential and revered by taking them on a journey from Ramakrishna’s childhood through his spiritual education.\n\nCutting Through Spiritual Materialism by Chogyam Trungpa taught Jobs that sense of self is an illusion. It’s a transcript of two lectures the author gave, between 1970 and 1971, on common traps in spiritual journeys.\n\nJobs also read Meetings With Remarkable Men by George Ivanovich Gurdjieff, another book about a spiritual journey. On their personal spiritual journeys, Jobs and Kottke derived inspiration from others who had embarked on similar quests for knowledge.\n\nGurdjieff, a Greek-Armenian spiritual teacher, sought spiritual and existential fulfilment in everyone from his father to a Persian dervish. One reader compares the work to a 20th-century version of the allegory “The Pilgrim’s Progress”.\n\nApple co-founder Steve Wozniak believes Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand was one of Steve Jobs’ “guides in life”. Rand’s 1957 book is an action-thriller based on economics, philosophy, and science fiction. It details the journey of an industrialist and a railroad executive who are determined to keep America afloat amid an economic crisis. The businessmen were also tasked with solving a range of mysteries that confronted them.\n\n“Steve was very fast thinking and wanted to do things; I wanted to build things,” Wozniak said. “I think Atlas Shrugged was one of his guides in life.”"
