        "text": "Review Date: 10/21/2019 | Author: David F., Nashville, TN\n\nComments: I have several rental properties in the Nashville area and Columbia area. Yep Construction has been doing work for me for at least five years. He has installed and repaired doors, windows,fences and other installs and repairs for me. I give his name to my family, friends and others. He always does a great job. I highly recommend Yep Construction.\n\nReview Date: 09/28/2018 | Author: Brittney W., Hermitage, TN\n\nComments: George went above and beyond! He repaired all of the siding on our chimney, replaced a gutter and soffit, caulked and painted, and replaced other pieces of siding around the house. George started work quickly after the deposit was paid. He was sure to leave his equipment and supplies tidied up overnight and always cleaned up after working each day. He even painted areas of the house that I had previously gotten deck stain on (without even telling us). We highly recommend Yep construction!\n\nReview Date: 06/27/2018 | Author: Brandon H., COLUMBIA, TN\n\nComments: If youÂ’re looking for a courteous, professional, on time quality job to be done, look no further. Yep is the business for you. They called on a Friday to look at the job and in just a couple of days my job was done. I highly recommend this company and will no doubt use them again if needed.\n\nReview Date: 05/31/2018 | Author: Peter C., Belfast, TN\n\nComments: George was an excellent tradesman. His work was outstanding and he is fair in the area of pricing. He was easy to contact and very punctual in both start and completion times. The only reason I could not give a five star rating was the interior trim work around the doors could have been done a little better but old material and leftovers were used that didn&apos;t match the existing. I&apos;m not sure if this was trying to save us money (my guess) but I did offer to purchase any materials needed to do the job. Overall I think that if I had been a little more specific in that area this would have been a complete 5 star review.\n\nReview Date: 10/19/2016 | Author: Patricia T., Portland, TN\n\nComments: George did a great job fixing some nagging problems with our siding. Not a huge repair job, but he took his time and was very thorough. He was extremely polite, and very easy to talk to. I would highly recommend him.\n\nReview Date: 02/16/2015 | Author: Thomas P., Nashville, TN\n\nComments: Quick response. Gave me a quote, did the work professionally, sent me an invoice. I did not even have to be there. Made getting this job done extremely easy for me. I still haven&apos;t met him face to face.\n\nReview Date: 02/03/2015 | Author: Janette C., Murfreesboro, TN\n\nComments: He fixed a lot of other things. repairs are Excellent. I think he can fix anything-he was the nicest and most considerate man I&apos;ve ever dealt with. Prices were very reasonable. He did some ceiling repairs and when he was done -you couldn&apos;t tell where the places were. I highly recommend him for most repairs in your house.\n\nReview Date: 01/24/2015 | Author: Anthony E., Antioch, TN\n\nComments: He was an honest person. I didn&apos;t have to be home when he came to inspect and quote. I came home 2 mins before he was done. Straight forward business. I would hire again for future projects.\n\nReview Date: 02/12/2014 | Author: Jeff S., Nashville, TN\n\nComments: Very prompt, came out that afternoon and was finished quickly. Gave a great explanation of why we were having the issue and things we could to remedy problems in the future. Would definitely recommend Yep to anyone and everyone. Great value as well!\n\nReview Date: 08/22/2013 | Author: Jade M., Spring Hill, TN\n\nComments: George was excellent to work with, he fixed some siding around my chimney and front porch. I also had him and his brother fix some drywall issues we had in our bathroom due to a leaking roof. Estimated costs were right on and actually cost less than was quoted! How often does that happen people!? Use these guys, I already have them hired for future jobs! Thanks guys!\n\nReview Date: 08/11/2013 | Author: Sam C., Clarksville, TN\n\nComments: George was understanding of my timeframe and completed the job 3days before the deadline. Communicated well with me as this was an out of state repair on a home being sold. He sent pictures and let me know when the job was completed. Great Job, Great service !\n\nReview Date: 07/11/2013 | Author: Brad B., Mount Juliet, TN\n\nComments: George was very friendly and very helpful. He explained what he was going to do before he did the work George is also great at communicating. It was a great experience. I have already hired him for another project.\n\nReview Date: 02/28/2013 | Author: Keith W., Franklin, TN\n\nComments: I needed some work done on my screens and windows that many others would not tackle because it was seen as not worth their time. YEP construction took the job and went to great lengths to find my parts and do the job. They have earned my future business!\n\nReview Date: 11/03/2012 | Author: Patricia T., Murfreesboro, TN\n\nComments: Great folks to work with. Called within minutes and did a great job of remaking a screen for a window that had been broken out during an attempted break-in. Fits perfectly (and is even better than the original screens. Built it right here at the house. And great pricing. I&apos;ll definitely call them again if I need windows, screens, etc.\n\nReview Date: 10/04/2012 | Author: Chris L., Antioch, TN\n\nComments: George was quick and professional. He was able to schedule my repair for the next day, and even called to let me know he was running slightly late. The work looked great and was completed quickly. I would definitely hire again!\n\nReview Date: 05/29/2012 | Author: James R., Kingston Springs, TN\n\nComments: I am a paraplegic,Who has been blessed with the chance to take care of my Mom,who has demetia,&amp; a 90 year old Grandmom.And to have found such a great guy&apos;s at yep well,Any lil thing to make my life just a bit easyer We are all very THANKFUL.If u need a guy who is very biz,Get&apos;s right to it and wounderful price&apos;s n these time&apos;s!!

I will most likely use their company again for future projects.\n\nReview Date: 04/19/2012 | Author: Beverly B., Murfreesboro, TN\n\nComments: I had a small project and they came out and fixed it the same day.Very professional and friendly.Would recommend them for large or small projects.Thank&apos;s so much.Need more business&apos;s like this.\n\nReview Date: 10/10/2011 | Author: a Neighbor, Clarksville, TN\n\nComments: was able to match siding and get job completed quickly and with great results at a good price. Also did some cleaning around the repair site that was above and beyond the job description. 100% satisfaction on my part. Highly recommended, thanks\n\nReview Date: 10/08/2011 | Author: Richard B., Nashville, TN\n\nComments: Exceeded expectations. Fullfilled needs to minor repairs I was in need of to loose panels, upgrades to inserts for lamps, replaced panels from squirel damage, re-wrapped window that was not done correctly on initial installation better that I had requested due to thier experience knowledge of siding, cleaned off mold/mildew from dormer on south side now appears new, provided all requested documentation (insurance, county registration, etc) and then some, VERY friendly and resposible as tasks were completed on the WEEKEND when I was out of town.
