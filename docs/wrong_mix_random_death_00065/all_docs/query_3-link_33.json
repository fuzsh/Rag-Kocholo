        "text": "Steven Paul Jobs, the chief founder of Apple Computer, was born in San Francisco, California (February 24, 1955). His parents were Joanne Schieble, who later came to be known as Joanne Simpson and Abdulfattah “John” Jandali. Both of them were students at University of Wisconsin. They gave their son up for adoption. His biological parents married soon after Jobs was adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs. They had another child named Mona Simpson. He came to know about his biological parents at the age of twenty seven. Clara was an accountant by profession. Paul was a United States Coast Guard. The Jobs family resided in Mountain View, California (from 1961 onwards), within the area which later named as Silicon Valley. Steve Jobs suffered from pancreatic cancer and died in 2011.\n\nEarly life of Steve Jobs\n\nIn his childhood, Steve Jobs worked on electronics with Paul in the family garage. His father showed him how to take apart and reconstruct electronics. This is how his interest in electronics grew up. He was a brilliant student in school. Later, he studied in Homestead High School in Silicon Valley and Reed College in Portland, Oregon. During this time he was introduced to Steve Wozniak, his future partner. He was attending the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nSteve Jobs Career\n\nIn the year 1974 Steve Jobs joined as a video game designer in the company named Atari, where he worked for several months.

Later in 1976, Jobs and Wozniak started Apple Computer (in his family garage). Jobs was only 21 years old at that time. Jobs and Wozniak sold Volkswagen bus and scientific calculator respectively to collect fund. It was they, who brought a revolutionary change in the computer world by inventing improved technology and introducing machines much smaller in size, cheaper, intuitive and accessible to daily consumers. Wozniak coined the idea of a series of user-friendly personal computers. Jobs took the charge of marketing. Apple I was sold in 1976.The very next year saw the success of Apple II, which was followed by advent of Macintosh in 1984. Apple Computer became a publicly traded company in 1980. Jobs appointed John Sculley, the marketing expert of Pepsi- Cola as the CEO of Apple. He left Apple in 1985. Then he founded NeXT, a computer platform development company.\n\nSteve Jobs’ Greatest Achievements\n\nSteve Jobs was posthumously honored as a Disney Legend in 2013.\n\nHe received Grammy Trustees Award in 2012.\n\nHe was named as the most powerful person in business by Fortune magazine in 2007.\n\nSteve received Jefferson Award for Public Service in the year 1987.\n\nJobs along with Steve Wozniak received National Medal of Technology in 1985.\n\n8 Inspiring Quotes by Steve Jobs\n\nBeing the richest man in the cemetery doesn’t matter to me. Going to bed at night saying we’ve done something wonderful, that’s what matters to me.\n\n“I’m convinced that about half of what separates successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance.”\n\n“My favourite things in life don’t cost any money. It’s really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time.”\n\n“My model for business is The Beatles. They were four guys who kept each other’s kind of negative tendencies in check. They balanced each other, and the total was greater than the sum of the parts. That’s how I see business: Great things in business are never done by one person, they’re done by a team of people.”\n\n“Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly, and get on with improving your other innovations.”\n\n“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.”\n\n“Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.”\n\n“Bottom line is, I didn’t return to Apple to make a fortune. I’ve been very lucky in my life and already have one. When I was 25, my net worth was $100 million or so. I decided then that I wasn’t going to let it ruin my life. There’s no way you could ever spend it all, and I don’t view wealth as something that validates my intelligence.”\n\nDo you know?"
