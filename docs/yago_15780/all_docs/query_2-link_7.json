        "text": "A film based on the hugely popular game Minecraft has become something of a bouncing ball in Hollywood, with more than one director picking it up then walking away. The latest name looking to tackle the job is Raising Victor Vargas' Peter Sollett.\n\nHe'll write and direct a take on the game that splices in the story of a teenage girl who, along with an unlikely group of adventurers, must save their blocky Overworld from the destructive force of the Ender Dragon.\n\nWarner Bros. has been trying to get this one made since it bought the rights to the game in 2014. Shawn Levy was the first to consider the idea, working up an idea but stepping away after creative differences with game developer Mojang. It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia's Rob McElhenney was next, while Steve Carell considered a lead role, but scheduling issues meant nothing quick stuck. And while it might seem as though the time has come and gone for a Minecraft movie at the height of the game's popularity, the studio is still pushing ahead, seeing the potential for another franchise. If it all comes together, it'll represent the biggest studio movie he's tackled to date."
