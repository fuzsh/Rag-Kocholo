        "text": "Vives, cowriter of the acclaimed 2002 feature Raising Victor Vargas and cowriter, producer and casting director for Five Feet High and Rising, the Sundance prize-winning short film on which it’s based, shares her photographs of the films' two lead actors from 1998 to the present. The result, much like the two films, is a nuanced meditation on growing up—on-screen and off.\n\nBorn in Madrid, Eva Vives moved to New York in 1994 to study film at New York University. She cast, edited, and co-produced the short film Five Feet High and Rising, which was awarded the Best Short Film Prize at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival and the Cannes Film Festival. Vives also co-wrote (with director Peter Sollett) the feature Raising Victor Vargas (2002) and co-wrote and directed the short She Pedals Fast (For a Girl) (2008). She directed All About Nina, her first feature, in 2017."
