        "text": "“Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist” made me want to be a gay teenage boy. That's a first for me, and I watch a lot of Bravo.\n\nNot sure that was the intention, but considering the film minus Nick’s fun-loving but refreshingly real gay friends is just another – no, STILL another – angst-ridden teen romance set to *cool* music, I’ll take its one spark of freshness with gratitude.\n\n“Nick and Norah” is a hipster version of horny “Superbad” mixed with some mature “Before Sunrise” bonding. Thankfully it does not have much in common with “Juno,” the gratingly quirky teen romp that did so well I’m bracing myself for copycats.\n\nMichael Cera is in this, as well as “Juno,” as well as “Superbad,” as well as “Arrested Development.” He plays a sweet loser. Again. I don’t want to belabor the point, but if he doesn’t even start showing signs of wanting to stretch beyond this role I will be forced to concede that he can’t.\n\nCera is Nick, a working class Jersey boy akin to John Cusack in “Better Off Dead” – a smart dork mourning the breakup of a hot chick he was less a boyfriend to than a successful stalker. The hot chick is Tris (Alexis Dziena), a sexed-up Tinkerbell who laughs about the many painfully earnest CDs musician Nick makes to try to win her back. Tris brings the CDs to her private school where Norah (Kat Dennings) fishes them out of the trash and falls in love. Norah is smart and sarcastic and funny and shows how a teenage girl can be all those things and not be half as irritating as Juno. (I’m afraid I will probably belabor this point.)\n\nShe’s also beautiful which “Nick and Norah” swats aside like a mosquito. Just like it swats aside how not classically attractive scrawny emo Nick is. More important that they are both genuinely good, thoughtful, caring people who share the same taste in music.\n\nNick and Norah – nothing like the Nick and Nora of “The Thin Man” films, by the way, not least of which because they don’t drink - have a meet-cute at a club on a Big Apple night to remember.\n\nNick is the only straight member of The Jerk Offs. He was accepted to Berklee College of Music in Boston and he’s got a few months before shipping off to his bright future. He and his band mates – Thom (Aaron Yoo) and Dev (Rafi Gavron), I love you both – are playing the gig at the club.\n\nNorah, a possible future Brown University student and daughter of a famous record executive, is there with her BFF Caroline (Ari Graynor). Caroline is a childish, attention hogging drunk and yet in Graynor’s hands she is the life and soul of the film. It’s the kind of gross-out comic relief role a guy normally plays in the Judd Apatow universe, so bravo – or brava – to Graynor for showing teenage girls can be just as horny and disgusting. … I guess. (That poor piece of gum!)\n\nTris and her new boyfriend Chuck are also at the club. After the gig everyone decides they want to go chase this ultra-hip band called Where’s Fluffy. And so the night takes off in many different directions involving a bright yellow Yugo, an amazing van, a bus terminal, more clubs, bridges and various loving shots of New York City bridges. Lessons are learned about shallowness and maturity and putting the pieces of ourselves together.\n\n“Nick and Norah” was directed by Peter Sollett, whose last directing credit is “Raising Victor Vargas.” I don’t get out much, but I happened to catch that at the Toronto Film Festival back in 2002. It’s another New York love letter, but a gritty indie one focusing on Latino teens. Good flick.\n\nThere are a few extraneous scenes in “Nick and Norah” and it ends up feeling a little longer than its 90 minutes. It also doesn’t have a lot of quotable or standout moments (except maybe that bathroom scene and the “I love you so much it’s retarded” taxi sex). Plus, it openly promotes teen sex - and I didn't see any protection.\n\nIt’s just a wistful movie about friendship and young love, even if a little “been there.” Except for Thom, Dev and their new gay friend (Jonathan B. Wright), who remains nameless for most of the film. They just met him after the gig, but by the end of the night he is part of the crew. At the end of the film, I wished I were, too.\n\nGina Carbone is off gum for at least a month, thanks to this film.
