        "text": "The camera fixes first on a 16-year-old named Victor (Victor Rasuk), who is flexing his abs and licking his lips. Then, on a teenage girl â the kids in their Lower East Side neighborhood call her Fat Donna â who is stretched out on a bed in anticipation. There are no parents around, no teachers, no bosses: no one to answer to but their own raging libidos. The setup could be lifted straight from Kids, Larry Clarkâs 1995 film about aimless NYC teens drinking and sleeping their way toward self-destruction. But, thankfully, first-time writer/director Peter Sollett is an altogether gentler, more graceful filmmaker; he too is keen on examining the coming-of-age process of young, sometimes-neglected kids, but does so without Clarkâs nasty, nihilistic bite. Victor never gets to taste the fruits of Fat Donna â his best friend Harold (Rivera), hollering to him from the sidewalk, drags Victor to the pool instead â but word gets out anyway (his little sister hilariously taunts, \"Youâll always be Fat Donnaâs man!\"). Victor needs to salvage his (largely self-created) reputation fast; enter cat-eyed Judy (Marte), who initially rebuffs Victorâs advances. The two push and pull â the swaggering Victor always licking his lips and hoping to squire her off to his bed, a standoffish Judy always brushing him aside â but itâs all posturing, really. The actors convey the soft spots under Victor and Judyâs battle-ready exteriors with a vulnerability that belies both their age and experience (they starred in a short by Sollett, their sole prior film experience). Marte and Rasuk are joined by a cast teeming with inexperienced yet remarkably powerful performers, including Rodriguez as Victorâs sullen sister and Diaz as Judyâs best friend, ducking in the shadows of Judyâs striking beauty. Theyâre all fumbling toward their first understandings of adult coupling (with far more fumbling than coupling going on), and itâs a mark of both the actorsâ maturity and the directorâs discretion that that premise never feels exploitative or leering. Running parallel to Victorâs sexual coming-of-age is his emotional maturation. His Dominican grandmother is raising Victor and his brother and sister on her own; she (Guzman) threatens to throw Victor out on the streets out of fear he is corrupting his younger siblings. In truth, heâs not â and itâs heartwrenching to watch the cocky 16-year-old crumble into a child terrified of abandonment. Raising Victor Vargas presents a group very rarely represented in film: the legions of grandparents raising their childrenâs children. Their grandmother is so far removed, culturally and generationally, from her charges that when grandmother and grandchildren do connect â in brief, giddy fits â the heart swells. Beautifully shot by Tim Orr (a frequent David Gordon Green collaborator with the cinematographerâs equivalent of the Midas touch), Sollettâs first feature is a small, but indelible picture, one that approaches the most universal of themes â first love, confused hormones, parental clashes â with originality. (Raising Victor Vargas first played Austin during the SXSW Film Festival.)"
