        "text": "Seems like Julianne Moore is looking forward to another Oscar next year! The first trailer for the upcoming drama film Freeheld was released this week, and I can tell you right now…Oscar Buzz. The film, directed by Peter Sollett and written by Ron Nyswaner, is based on Cynthia Wade‘s 2007 Oscar-winning short documentary by the same name.\n\nAlso starring Ellen Page, Steve Carell, Luke Grimes, and Michael Shannon, Freeheld tells the true love story of Laurel Hester (Moore) and Stacie Andree (Page) and their fight for justice against the Ocean County, New Jersey Board of Chosen Freeholders. The film is coming out just a few months after the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage across America, which makes its timing perfect. The three-minute trailer is very emotional and shows us that Freeheld has all the right ingredients to qualify for Oscar season (powerful story, strong characters, gay justice, based on an Oscar-winning short documentary), so don’t be surprised if you hear more about it in coming months.\n\nDo you think Freeheld is the beginning of Oscar-talk? We will find out soon enough. The film is scheduled to open on October 2nd. In the meantime, watch the trailer below and let us know what you think!"
