        "text": "The Minecraft Movie’s official release date is set for March 4, 2022. Announced on the official Minecraft website, Peter Sollett, known for his work on Nick & Norah’s Infinite Playlist, will be writing and directing the feature-length film.\n\nThe Minecraft Movie will follow a teenage girl and an unlikely group of adventurers, who, after the malevolent Ender Dragon sets out on a path of destruction, must save their blocky overworld. The film is being distributed by Warner Bros. and produced by Mojang AB and Vertigo Entertainment.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe Minecraft Movie has undergone a lengthy series of starts and stops. In October 2014, Night at the Museum and Stranger Things' Shawn Levy was named as director, but left the project in December 2014 due to reported creative differences.\n\nIt was announced in July 2015 that It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia’s Rob McElhenney would take over as director, but he too dropped out of the project, delaying the movie past its planned May 24, 2019 release date. Finally Sollett was named as director in January 2019. Steve Carell was also in talks to join the project as the lead voice actor in 2016, though he also left due to reported scheduling conflicts.
