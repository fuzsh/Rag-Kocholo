        "meta_description": "Don't be put off by the vague, sitcom-ish title; this film is a true find, a picture with a vital daffiness that's all its own, rather that a film that lives on the leavings of other movies. The 16-year-old Victor (Victor Rasuk) is all teenage assertion, but his machismo has training wheels.  In Peter Sollett's delicate and altogether satisfying romantic comedy, it's Victor's puffed-rice pride that always gets him into trouble. Pride is a tricky subject to make a film about. Part of what will leave you taking in all of the delights of &quot;Vargas&quot; with open-mouthed wonder comes from the director's surefooted navigating of the way pride bounces around a small, packed household. Victor lives in a tiny apartment with his family, including his stubborn, salt-of-the-earth grandmother (Altagracia Guzman).  Things get complicated when Victor starts chasing the swan-like Judy (Judy Marte) and the whole world gets involved. In the larger world, this stuff might not add up to a hill of beans, but Mr. Sollett treats the emotional shifts in the Vargas household like the movement of tectonic plates; each change rocks the characters lives. — Elvis Mitchell",

        "text": "The 16-year-old Victor (Victor Rasuk) of ''Raising Victor Vargas'' is all teenage assertion, but his machismo has training wheels. He may be a smart boy, but at this point in his life he's too busy trying to be a wiseguy; he hasn't engaged his brains just yet. In the director Peter Sollett's delicate and altogether satisfying romantic comedy -- which plays today at Alice Tully Hall and tomorrow at the Walter Reade Theater, the opener of this year's New Films/New Directors series -- it is Victor's puffed-rice pride that always gets him into trouble.\n\nThis is a tricky subject to make a film about and part of what will leave you taking in all the delights of ''Vargas'' with open-mouthed wonder comes from the director's surefooted navigating of the way pride bounces around a small, packed household, the tiny apartment Victor lives in.\n\nHe gets a good dose of his pride from his grandmother (Altagracia Guzman). This small, stubborn salt-of-the-earth woman is raising Victor, along with his younger brother Nino (Silvestre Rasuk) and little sister Vicky (Krystal Rodriguez). In the larger world, all this stuff might not add up to a hill of beans, but Mr. Sollett treats the emotional shifts in the Vargas household like the movement of tectonic plates: each change rocks the characters' lives.\n\nLike many 16-year-old boys, Victor wants to be a player, chasing down girls in his Lower East Side neighborhood. This callous, self-involved puppy of a ladies' man leaves a trail of scattered, hilarious affairs in his wake. The picture starts with one. But he bounces back on his feet like an acrobat, or a Weeble. During the summer in which ''Vargas'' is set, Victor meets his match when he runs into Judy (Judy Marte), all swanlike cool. She's hanging out with her friend Melonie (Melonie Diaz) at the neighborhood pool where they're spotted by Victor and his fellow Mack manqué, Harold (Kevin Rivera). Between them they have less game than a broken PlayStation 2, but they scheme to win the girls over anyway.\n\nThings get complicated when Victor's whole world gets involved in his romances. He seeks help in his suit from Judy's little brother, who demands in return an introduction to Victor's sister. Overhearing all these negotiations makes Nino decide that he wants an introduction to the world of manly conquests that he imagines his brother inhabits.\n\nAll of this scheming is a terrible affront to the grandmother, an Old World type battling to keep the rot outside from infecting her family. Victor, in particular, seems unbelievable to her; if she had holy water, she'd probably use it to draw a circle around her grandson.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
