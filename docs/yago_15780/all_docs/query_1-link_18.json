Every bit as charming as I remembered; what strikes me as retroactively bizarre is the critical fixation (my own included; see below) on its lack of danger, which everyone found either implausible or refreshing. This time the ordinariness seemed...ordinary. Kept an eye out for signs of white-dude tourism, didn't notice any—not my world, obviously (though I lived on the Lower East Side in the late '90s), but the feeling of authenticity is strong. Hopeful note for aspiring filmmakers currently stuck doing gruntwork: Cristina Choe is credited here as part of craft services.\n\nHere's my contemporaneous Time Out New York review (which now that I reread it suggests that the aforementioned weirdness wasn't so much racism as it was a reaction to this film arriving hot on the heels of Bully and Ken Park):\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nFor those unfortunate souls who've ingested a toxic quantity of alarmist youth-of-today posturing—which is to say, those who've watched two or more Larry Clark movies—Raising Victor Vargas, the irresistible debut film by Peter Sollett, provides a welcome antidote. Set in the Lower East Side in what appears to be the present, Sollett's improvisational comedy imagines, or rediscovers, a world in which drugs and guns have no place and present no threat; a world in which good-natured braggadocio qualifies as a mortal sin; a world in which sexuality is a fearsome concept, subject to endless tentative negotiation. It's a world that I, for one, remember quite vividly—but do teenagers this wholesome, inexperienced and Osmond-esque still exist anywhere in New York? Raising Victor Vargas will give you hope."
