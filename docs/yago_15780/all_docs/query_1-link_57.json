        "text": "15, 88 mins\n\nPETER SOLLETT, the New York film-maker, has set Raising Victor Vargas, his debut feature, among the Hispanic community of his city’s Lower East Side. It is a tender film, whose overarching concerns — immigration, generational conflict and teenage love — never detract from honest, insightful storytelling.\n\nThe 17-year-old Victor Vargas (Victor Rasuk) lives in a poky flat with his two younger siblings and a domineering but well-meaning Grandma (Altagracia Guzman) who chains up the phone and examines glasses for lipstick to keep her family in check against a world she increasingly fears.\n\nOutside on the streets, Victor parades around like an awkward peacock, trying to woo his neighbour Judy (Judy Marte), while indoors he remains Grandma’s naughty little boy."
