        "text": "The upcoming Minecraft movie has found its director!\n\nThe forthcoming Warner Bros. film, based on the massively popular video game, will be written and directed by Peter Sollett, Variety confirmed on Friday (January 11).\n\nThe story of the movie “follows a teenage girl and her unlikely group of adventurers who, after the malevolent Ender Dragon sets out on a path of destruction, must save their beautiful, blocky Overworld.”\n\nThe film studio first acquired rights to launch the franchise in 2014. Various names were previously attached to the project, including Steve Carell in a potential role, but scheduling kept it from happening and the film was put back in development."
