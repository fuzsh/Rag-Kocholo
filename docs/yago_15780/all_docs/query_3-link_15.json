Pictures on March 4, 2022.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 2012, Mojang received offers from Hollywood producers who wanted to produce Minecraft-related TV shows. However, Mojang stated that they would only engage in such projects when \"the right idea comes along\".\n\nBy February 2014, Markus Persson revealed that Mojang was in talks with Warner Bros. Pictures regarding a Minecraft film[1], and by October 2014, Vu Bui stated that the project was \"in its early days of development\".[2] The film was scheduled for release on 24 May 2019, and was going to be directed by Shawn Levy and written by Jason Fuchs.[3] Levy later dropped out and was replaced by Rob McElhenney.[4]\n\nIn August 2018, McElhenney left the film and Fuchs was replaced with Aaron and Adam Nee resulting in its release date getting delayed.[5]\n\nOn January 11, 2019, Peter Sollett was announced to write and direct the film.[6]\n\nOn April 16, 2019, Mojang revealed via a news post that the movie will release on March 4, 2022.[7][8]"
