        "text": "Reviewed: Aug, 2023\n\nReleased: 2022,\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nReviewer: JP\n\nSummer Metal Movie Madness. After reviewing almost every physical DVD I own I realized there is still a long way to go to review every Metal-themed film out there! As DVD’s become more and more obsolete, new, interesting Hard Rock and Metal movies are getting produced on a regular basis but not being pressed onto DVD or Blu-Ray. Many of them are going straight to some sort of streaming service. While this is not my preference, if it comes down to not watching the film or watching it streaming, I’d rather see it. I have spent the last couple of months watching as many streaming Metal movies as possible and will be reviewing several per month for the next several months. Please feel free to enjoy all the reviews in this feature.\n\nThere was quite a bit of buzz about this Netflix original production when it came out in 2022, but Netflix is good at hyping their own thing. I started to read a bit of negative commentary as well so I quickly set the movie aside for a bit so I could enjoy it with fresh eyes and ears.\n\nMETAL LORDS is the next of a long series of relatively recent metal-themed movies. It is almost as if producers realize that anything with a Metal theme will have a small but loyal audience and therefore be successful. METAL LORDS is essentially a romantic comedy (or rom-com apparently as the cool film kids say) which is basically the kiss of death for me. I don’t enjoy the genre at all, I’m more of an action and horror guy. However, the fact that the theme is Metal, the lure was too strong to resist watching it.\n\nThis decent budget film stars a bunch of unknowns. They could be more known to fans of film but I only recognized one actor. The plot is simple, two high school friends have a fledgling metal band that is not very good. Boy meets new girl, minor conflict between boy, girl and boy’s best friend who happens to be a raging Metal head. The conflict is resolved and ends in a battle of the bands, not unlike Jack Black’s ROCK SCHOOL.\n\nI watched this with a keen eye for Metallic detail and I was actually quite impressed. The producers, director, set-designers all did a very good job. It was actually much better than expected. The film, set in Oregon I believe looks and feels realistic. It has all the usual characters we would expect; jocks, nerds, the cool kids, disengaged parents, clueless teachers and of course the outsiders, the Metal kids. There are also a ton of Metal references scattered around for fans to enjoy.\n\nThe writers poke gentle fun but pay homage to the Metal genre at the same time. There were quite a few times where I was very pleasantly surprised where the plot did not go in the predictable direction. There were several times when the writers took those expected plot devices, set them up for a cliché moment and then went in another direction to my great surprise and pleasure. For example, there is a scene when the main protagonist, who has a girlfriend, ends up in a hot tub with a hot chick after a gig. I was rolling my eyes to myself thinking, “OK, now the girlfriend is going to walk in on the guy making out in the hot tub, she is going to get pissed off and run away crying and he is going to chase her and then win her back.” Romantic comedy plot device #1. Boring and cliché. But I was so wrong. Instead, in the scene we get a cameo of some very, very famous Metal musicians who appear in a semi-drunken vision and they have a morality debate about his behaviour! I won’t spoil it by telling you who they are but I was ‘Holy Shit! That’s so and so from Band X!” There were several moments like that where the film did not go in the expected direction which greatly added to its enjoyment for me.\n\nThere are of course a few little mistakes that real Metalheads will quickly pick out (apparently Black Sabbath is post-death now?!) but those would be largely inconsequential to a broader viewing audience. I found it amusing that the imaginary band in the film is called ‘Skullfucker’, as if that was intended to shock the audience with a cliché ‘evil’ Metal band name. The joke is on the producers and or writers because they probably don’t know there already are/were a couple of real bands called Skullfucker! I hope they don’t sue Netflix for unauthorized use of the name!\n\nThe soundtrack is very solid. We get to hear parts of songs by Ozzy, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Metallica, Pantera, Guns’ N Roses, Motorhead and a few more and music is featured very heavily and prominently in several scenes.\n\nIt is a cute film. Normally, I hate crap like that. METAL LORDS is simple romantic story with enough unexpected twists which made it tolerable and enough Metal to make it very enjoyable."
