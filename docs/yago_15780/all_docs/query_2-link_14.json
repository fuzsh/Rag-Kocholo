        "text": "Minecraft (also known as Minecraft: The Quest to Defeat the Ender Dragon) is a 2017 computer-animated action-adventure fantasy comedy film based on the sandbox video game of the same name created by Mojang. The first feature film installment in the Minecraft franchise, it was directed by Peter Sollett (in his feature directorial debut) and Mike Mitchell from a screenplay by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, Jason Fuchs, Jared Stern, Jens Bergensten and Matthew Fogel, and a story by Bergensten and Agnes Larsson, and stars the voices of Zac Efron, Lucy Boynton, Jason Lee, Anna Kendrick, Dan Fogler, David Hyde Pierce, Joshua Tomar, Dan Middleton, and Scarlett Johannson. In the Overworld, Steve and Alex are two friends who go mining together in the caves and reside in a village. But when news of the Ender Dragon's escape is spread throughout, the Mayor declares a state of emergency across the Overworld. But Steve and Alex won't let the Ender Dragon destroy their homeland, so the two set out on a long journey to take it down.\n\nPlans for a Minecraft film went into consideration in 2012, shortly after the successful launch of the full game in 2011. 20th Century Fox and Regency purchased the rights in May, but the plans fell through due to the lack of a script. It was placed in turnaround before Sony Pictures acquired it. After remaining in development hell for almost two years, Sony sold it to Warner Bros. Pictures for $850 million in November 2013. Zac Efron and Lucy Boynton were cast as Steve and Alex, with Peter Sollett and Mike Mitchell attached as directors.\n\nAnimal Logic was the key animation and visual effects provider for the film, while Christopher Lennertz — a fan of the Minecraft franchise — composed and conducted the musical score. Additional music and songs were recorded and produced by veteran Minecraft composer Daniel Rosenfeld, also known as C418. The film was produced by Village Roadshow Pictures, Legendary Pictures, Mojang Pictures, Vertigo Entertainment, RatPac-Dune Entertainment, and Lord Miller Productions, and was produced internationally between Sweden, the United States, and Australia.\n\nMinecraft held its world premiere at the Mojang headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden on June 13, 2017 before it was theatrically released in the United States on July 14 by Warner Bros. Pictures. It was later released in Australia on August 2, 2017 by Roadshow Entertainment, and later had a release in Sweden on August 8 by Nordisk Film. While praise was given for the animation style, faithfulness to the source material, musical score, songs, production values, visual effects and voice performances, there was criticism given to its thin plot, inconsistent narrative, and runtime. It was a box office success, grossing just over $550 million worldwide against its budget of $150-175 million. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 90th Academy Awards, but lost to Coco. A sequel, Minecraft 2.0, was released on July 16, 2021, to mixed reviews and was a box office failure.\n\nPlot[]\n\nSteve and Alex are two adventurers in the Overworld who are very close friends. They explore their world, venture into caves, fight hostile mobs, and collect resources. They live in a village near one of these caves and are close friends with the villagers. One day, the Mayor of the Overworld calls for an urgent meeting. News spreads that the Ender Dragon has escaped from the End and is wreaking havoc across the Overworld. The Mayor declares a state of emergency and urges everyone to stay safe. Concerned for their village and the entire Overworld, Steve and Alex decide they cannot sit idly by. They resolve to embark on a quest to find and defeat the Ender Dragon.\n\nSteve and Alex prepare for their journey by gathering supplies, crafting weapons, and saying goodbye to their friends and the village. They consult with the village's wise librarian, who provides them with an ancient map and some cryptic advice about the journey ahead. The duo faces their first obstacles in the dark, monster-filled forests. They fight off skeletons, zombies, and spiders, showcasing their teamwork and resourcefulness. They discover an abandoned mineshaft, which contains clues about the Ender Dragon’s whereabouts.\n\nSteve and Alex traverse a scorching desert and come across a hidden temple. Inside, they solve puzzles and avoid traps, ultimately finding a key item that will help them in their quest – an ancient artifact or a piece of enchanted armor. On their way to the next destination, tensions rise between Steve and Alex due to the stress and danger of their journey. A dramatic moment occurs where they have to save each other, reaffirming their friendship and strengthening their resolve.\n\nSteve and Alex then find a lava pool and use the water to cover the lava and turn it into obsidian, a black-purple rock that is hard to mine. They build a Portal and light it up using their flint and steel before they step through and into the Nether Dimension. The place is covered with netherrack, fire, and lava, and soon they approach a Nether Fortress, which is loaded with Blazes. After Alex almost dies to a group of Blazes, Steve fights them off and kills them, saving her.\n\nThe map leads them to a stronghold, an underground fortress that houses a portal to the End. They navigate through the stronghold’s labyrinthine passages, fighting off Silverfish and other hostile mobs. Steve and Alex activate the End Portal using the Ender Eyes and step into the End dimension, where the land is eerie and filled with Endermen. They prepare for the final battle with the Ender Dragon, making sure their armor and weapons are in top condition. Soon, they approach the Ender Dragon, supported by the power of the End Crystals. Together, Steve and Alex use their bows and arrows to take down the crystals, injuring the Ender Dragon in the process. Having to fight off several Endermen, Steve and Alex soon deal the final blow to the Dragon, killing it as it ascends into the sky and explodes. They then retrieve the Dragon's Egg and jump through the portal and back into the Overworld.\n\nSteve and Alex return to their village as heroes, and the village throws a massive feast to celebrate their win. The Mayor recognizes their courage, and their friends and villages congratulate them. Steve and Alex reflect on their adventure and realize that their relationship and teamwork were critical to their accomplishment. They decide to keep exploring their world, exploring more caves, and gathering more resources to help expand their village. As the sun sets over the horizon, Steve and Alex look at each other, appreciating the lives they have.\n\nCast[]\n\nZac Efron as Steve\n\nLucy Boynton as Alex\n\nScarlett Johansson as the Ender Dragon\n\nJason Lee as Sharp\n\nAnna Kendrick as Haley\n\nDan Fogler as Marc\n\nDavid Hyde Pierce as Lorten\n\nJoshua Tomar as Julian\n\nDan Middleton as the Mayor of the Overworld\n\nMore coming soon!\n\nProduction[]\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nShortly after the full launch of Minecraft in 2011, rumors of a film based on the game began circling around the internet. In May 2012, 20th Century Fox and Regency Enterprises announced they had secured a deal with Mojang and acquired the rights to Minecraft for a film to be produced. However, in July that same year, the plans were abruptly canceled due to the lack of a script.\n\nAfter being placed in turnaround, Sony Pictures acquired the film. Lana and Lilly Wachowski were set to direct, and was originally intended to be a live-action film according to Sony. After remaining in development hell for almost two years, Warner Bros. Pictures eventually acquired the film from Sony for $850 million in November 2013. Warner Bros. confirmed that the film would be an animated feature, instead of live-action.

YouTube sensation Dan Middleton was confirmed in a news article from The Guardian that he would be voicing the Mayor of the Overworld.\n\nAnimation[]\n\nThe animation for the film was handled at Animal Logic in Sydney, Australia.\n\nMusic[]\n\nJohn Powell was originally interested in composing the music for Minecraft. However, he later said he couldn't work on it as he was working on the music for Jason Bourne with David Buckley. Then, Christopher Lennertz revealed on Instagram that he had signed a contract with Peter Sollett and Mike Mitchell to compose the score for the film.\n\nMinecraft veteran soundtrack composer Daniel Rosenfeld, known professionally as C418, announced he would be joining Christopher Lennertz in composing the score for the film, while also remastering old Minecraft game music. The soundtrack was released on July 28, 2017 by WaterTower Music.\n\nRelease[]\n\nOriginally, Minecraft was scheduled for release in September 2016, but was pushed back by 10 months due to voice cast retakes, music preparation, and additional animation.
