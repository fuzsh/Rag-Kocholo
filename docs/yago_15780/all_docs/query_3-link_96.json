        "text": "In the past 14 months, Raising Victor Vargas, a film about three Dominican-American siblings who live with their grandmother in a New York apartment, has been one of the low-budgeted, big-hearted delights of a series of film festivals around the world, from Cannes to Toronto to Sundance. The story centres on the education of Victor, a teenaged would-be Casanova, caught between the irresistible attraction of the neighbourhood dream girl, \"Juicy Lucy,\" and the immovable force of his strict grandma.\n\nDirector Peter Sollett wasn't far out of his teens himself when the character of Victor literally came to him. While trying to direct his first short film as a student at New York University, he used to keep his hands in his pockets in embarrassment because his nails were so badly bitten from worry. The film, inspired by a childhood crush he had on a girl a year older than he, was called Five Feet High and Rising. Sollett could not find a lead character. In desperation, he and his friends papered the Lower East Village near his apartment advertising a casting call for adolescents to be in a film. One day a Hispanic boy, Victor Rasuk, sauntered in.\n\nThey asked him to improvise a scene in which he is supposed to speak to a bully who has been bothering his younger brother. Smollett expected a belligerent confrontation . To everyone's surprise, Rasuk did an unconventional pitch: He told the bully how he loved his brother and couldn't bear to see him get hurt. Sollett realized he could deal with adult-sized emotions and complexity in an adolescent world. He developed a different approach to making movies.\n\nThe audition changed the tone of the story. Sollett's original plan was to make his film about the kind of neighbourhood he grew up in, the Jewish-Italian district of Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, but he couldn't find convincing child actors. He changed the setting to the Lower East Side, and cast it with Rasuk and other Hispanic kids.\n\n\"Ethnicity was never what I had in mind. I picked the best actors for the story and, given that Victor was Hispanic, I probably couldn't cast his grandmother as Asian without some explanation, but this isn't a movie about an ethnic group.\"\n\nIn the two years since that first short film, he became friends with the cast members. The original short film was inspired by Sollett's life. Raising Victor Vargas is about his cast's growing pains, \"though more on an emotional level than as a reflection of their biographical experience.\n\n\"I try to put the film into the hands of the people up on the screen as much as possible,\" he continues. \"I don't want to be the guy up on the podium. I see myself as more of a midwife to the film they want to make.\"\n\nThe analogy might apply better if it were possible to be a midwife who's in labour at the same time. Raising Victor Vargas is also very much Sollett's baby. The script was \"a very traditional screenplay,\" worked out at the Sundance Institute and through the Cannes Film Festival's Cin√©foundation program.\n\nAlthough the crew had the script, the cast didn't; still, they worked through the entire story, scene by scene, for a month before shooting began. Sollett would tell his actors their situation and watch them react. \"I didn't concern myself with what words they used. I was interested in the situation in which they found themselves. It's like life: It's what you do that counts, not what you say.\"\n\nHe quotes one of his models, director John Cassavetes, who instructed his actors on set: \"If you don't want to say it, then don't say it.\"\n\nSollett, who is working on a new screenplay he hopes to finish by the end of the year, doubts that he'll ever revisit the story of Victor and his neighbourhood. \"My interests will remain my interests,\" he says, \"but whether they're found in an elderly white man or a middle-aged black woman is not that important to me.\"\n\nHe sees himself as a predominantly \"narrative filmmaker\" working more with the traditional concerns of character and plot, rather than images, to tell his story. But he's proud that his film leaves a visual record of a vanishing part of Lower Manhattan immigrant neighbourhoods, with their backyard chicken runs and homemade shacks.\n\nThe film is the record of the end of an era in more ways than one. During shooting, which stretched through August and September of 2001, the neighbourhood was in view of the twin towers of the World Trade Center, destroyed that Sept. 11. In separate scenes, the towers are shown in the film's background -- and are then gone.\n\nSollett could have reshot or cut (as the directors of Kissing Jessica Stein, another Manhattan indie film, chose to do). But the event was too central to the experience of making the film. \"Morally, emotionally and legally we were obliged to shut down for three weeks. Then we came back and shot another five days,\" he says, noting that \"it was only possible to complete it because of the insurance money.\"\n\nThe crew and cast were shooting on 8th Street on top of an apartment building when they noticed the first low-flying plane. They sat on the rooftop, first watching as the planes hit the towers, and later as people leaped from the buildings.\n\nAs he told Toronto audiences last September on the anniversary of the event, his memories of Raising Victor Vargas are intimately tied to that experience. \"That day changed the way I approached what I do, but we were all relieved that we were making a movie we could believe in,\" he says, \"and that it was about the things we should be talking about, like finding out who you are, and having the freedom to be that person.\""
