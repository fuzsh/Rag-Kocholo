        "text": "The Minecraft movie is now without a theatrical release date.\n\nThe video game adaptation of Minecraft was slated to arrive in theaters on March 4, 2022, but is now undated, according to Deadline.\n\nNews of the move comes alongside other films that have had release dates changed by Warner Bros.\n\nAnnounced in early 2014, the film went into very early stages of development that fall, with those behind it stating it was at least two to four years out.\n\nIn June of 2016, a theatrical release of May 24, 2019 was announced, but it was pushed into 2022.\n\nNow, Warner seems to be unsure when it will arrive in theaters, but hopefully, it won't be pushed too far into the nether.\n\nLast we heard, the story revolves around a teenage girl and an unlikely group of adventurers. After the malevolent Ender Dragon sets out on a path of destruction, they are tasked with saving their blocky Overworld.\n\nThe film is being directed by Peter Sollett (Nick & Norah’s Infinite Playlist) who replaced It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia co-creator Rob McElhenney."
