        "text": "When beginning your career as a screenwriter, be honest and value your personal experience, knowing that your experiences are worth writing about.\n\nWhen auditioning non-professional actors, give them an objective for the scene rather than sides as a means to begin improvisation.\n\nImprovisation will help you see if a non-professional actor can commit to, and can exist in, a fictional world in order to hit the main points of the scene.\n\nWhen directing non-professional actors without a script, it's key to distill the following for each scene: The characterâ€™s objective, tactics they can use to meet those objectives, the turning point at which they either achieve, or fail to achieve, their objectives, where your actor should land at the end of the scene to motivate the events of the next scene.\n\nEvery scene should have a conflict. When creating conflict, always ensure that your characters objectives are perfectly opposed.\n\nOnly give your audience information about a character they need in that moment-- give it too early or too much and your audience will push back.\n\nWhen possible, use a landmark early in your film to help geographically orient your audience."
