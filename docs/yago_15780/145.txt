PETER SOLLETT, the New York film-maker, has set Raising Victor Vargas, his debut feature, among the Hispanic community of his city’s Lower East Side. It is a tender film, whose overarching concerns — immigration, generational conflict and teenage love — never detract from honest, insightful storytelling.

The 17-year-old Victor Vargas (Victor Rasuk) lives in a poky flat with his two younger siblings and a domineering but well-meaning Grandma (Altagracia Guzman) who chains up the phone and examines glasses for lipstick to keep her family in check against a world she increasingly fears.

Outside on the streets, Victor parades around like an awkward peacock, trying to woo his neighbour Judy (Judy Marte), while indoors he remains Grandma’s naughty little boy.
