        "text": "British actress\n\nAnna Louise Friel (born 12 July 1976) is an English actress. She first achieved fame as Beth Jordache in the Channel 4 soap opera Brookside (1993–1995), later coming to international prominence with her role as Charlotte \"Chuck\" Charles on ABC's Pushing Daisies (2007–2009), for which she received a nomination for the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy Series. In 2017, she won the International Emmy for Best Actress for her portrayal of the title character in the ITV/Netflix mystery drama series Marcella (2016–2021). Her other accolades include a Drama Desk Award, an honorary degree,[1] and a BAFTA nomination.\n\nFriel made her feature film debut in 1998 with a leading role in The Land Girls. Subsequent credits include A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999), Me Without You (2001), Timeline (2003), Goal! (2005), Bathory (2008), Land of the Lost (2009), Limitless (2011), Books of Blood (2020), and Charming the Hearts of Men (2021). Her stage credits include Closer (Broadway, 1999), Breakfast at Tiffany's (West End, 2009), and Uncle Vanya (West End, 2012).\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nAnna Louise Friel was born on 12 July 1976 in Rochdale, Greater Manchester.[2][3] Her mother, Julie Bamford Friel (born 1952), is a special needs teacher.[4] Her father, Desmond \"Des\" Friel (born 1951), was born in Belfast and raised in County Donegal, Ireland.[5] He is a former French teacher and folk guitarist, who now owns a web design company.[4] Her brother Michael is a doctor, who in his youth did television advertising work for Hovis.[6]\n\nFriel attended Crompton House secondary school—an Anglican school—and later Holy Cross College, a Roman Catholic sixth form.[7] She began her training as an actress at Oldham Theatre Workshop.[8]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\n1991–1999: Television work and film debut\n\n[edit]\n\nFriel made her professional debut at age 13 in the television miniseries G.B.H., which aired in 1991 and was nominated for several BAFTAs.[9] This led to small parts on the ITV soap operas Coronation Street and Emmerdale (1991; 1992). She was cast the following year as Beth Jordache in the Channel 4 soap Brookside, a role she played for two years. The character was involved in some of the series' most famous storylines, including the murder and covert burial of her abusive father,[10] and the first ever pre-watershed lesbian kiss in British television history;[7] a moment that went on to be broadcast around the world—including 76 countries where homosexuality is outlawed—when it featured during a montage at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.[11] She later said, \"For a very long time I was defined by that kiss. And I didn't want to be. I spent years turning down other lesbian roles because it felt like going back to Beth. [But it] did also make me want to take on parts that showed extreme sides of women\".[12] In 1995, Friel won a National Television Award in the category of \"Most Popular Actress\" for her work on Brookside.[13]\n\nUpon leaving the show, a decision that she initially thought to be a \"terrible mistake\",[14] Friel was cast in an episode of Tales from the Crypt and appeared as one of the main characters in Stephen Poliakoff's television film The Tribe (1998), which attracted controversy for its inclusion of a ménage à trois sex scene.[15] She then played leading roles in small-screen adaptations of Charles Dickens' Our Mutual Friend and Robert Louis Stevenson's St. Ives (both 1998), and co-starred in several British films, such as wartime period drama The Land Girls (1998),[16] crime drama Rogue Trader (1999), and slapstick comedy Mad Cows (1999).[17] While most were dismissive of Cow's eccentric humour, some critics felt that Friel's work as Australian expatriate Maddy was impressive.[18][19] Next, she played Hermia in the 1999 film version of William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream,[20] saying later of the experience, \"I think that [role] sort of changed things for me, especially in America, because the cast was really great—Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christian Bale—and people started to think, 'if she's working with [those people] she must be doing well'\".[21]\n\nDuring that same period, Friel made her Broadway debut in a production of Patrick Marber's Closer, which ran for 173 performances at the Music Box Theatre in New York (March–August 1999).[22] In his review of the show for Variety, Charles Isherwood wrote:\n\nIt's the exquisitely lovely Friel who is the discovery here. Her Alice is both the nihilistic core of the play and its tender center, and the paradoxical mixture of toughness and fragility [she] brings to it are essential to the play's deepest truths. It's a star-making performance.[23]\n\nFor her work as exotic dancer Alice, Friel won that year's Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play.[24]\n\n2000–2009: Stage roles, film work, and Pushing Daisies\n\n[edit]\n\nFriel had leading roles in the comedy-drama films An Everlasting Piece and Sunset Strip (both 2000), with her performance in Piece attracting particular praise.[25] The following year, she starred as the wife of a World War II soldier in the decently reviewed Canadian film The War Bride,[26][27] for which she earned a Genie Award nomination for Best Actress,[28] and co-headlined the coming-of-age drama Me Without You opposite Michelle Williams. In his appraisal of You for Variety, David Rooney said, \"Of the central duo, Friel has the most difficult job, playing an essentially unsympathetic brat … But [she] continually tempers the negatives with a vulnerability and insecurity that redeem her\".[29] Between March and May 2001, Friel appeared in an adaptation of Frank Wedekind's Lulu at the Almeida Theatre; her West End stage debut.[30][31] Describing her portrayal of the titular Victorian sex worker, theatre critic Nicholas de Jongh felt, \"The appeal of Miss Friel's [performance] depends upon its restraint, guile and cool\", noting that she mixes \"child-like glee and naughtiness\" with a \"calm and callous\" demeanour.[32] The play transferred to the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. for one month following its run at the Almeida.[33]\n\nFriel's next roles were in the Irish television film Watermelon (2003), where she starred as a headstrong Dublin girl who travels to England for an abortion,[34] and the Richard Donner fantasy adventure film Timeline (2003), where she played the love interest of the main character. She was then cast as Attorney Megan Delaney in The Jury, an American legal drama series that ran on Fox for a single season in 2004. Writing for The New York Times, Alessandra Stanley called the show \"clever, innovative\", and said of Friel, \"hers is the most textured and persuasive character\".[35] Friel later admitted to finding the job a challenge: \"Everyone was saying, 'you will never believe how much hard work it is', and I was telling them not to worry because I'm used to it … but my God were they right … You run off the set from one scene and get changed and run back on. It is so fast and so very well organised but it is hard, hard bloody work\".[21] Next, she played Geordie nurse Roz in the British-American sports drama Goal! (2005; a part she reprised in its sequel) and appeared as a recovering drug addict in the Toronto-set Niagara Motel (2006). In a mixed review of Motel, The Georgia Straight's Ken Eisner noted that Friel's performance carried \"the most weight\" in the film, while commending her \"perfect local accent\".[36] In November 2006, she was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Bolton for contributions to the performing arts.[1]\n\nIn 2007, Friel was cast as Charlotte \"Chuck\" Charles in Pushing Daisies, an American dramedy series created by Bryan Fuller, which aired on ABC from October that year until June 2009. The show was warmly reviewed during its run,[37] with television critic John Leonard believing it to be \"at once satire, mystery, fairy tale, romance, lollipop, whimsy, and kazoo\", and singling out Friel as a highlight.[38] Her portrayal of Charles, a resurrected murder victim and passionate beekeeper, won her a nomination for the 2008 Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Comedy Series.[39] Daisies was cancelled shortly after its second season finale, with viewership having dropped from 13 million to 4.9 million.[40] Friel was subsequently offered a number of roles on American television, but turned them down to focus on her film career.[41]\n\nFor her portrayal of the title character in Bathory, a 2008 historical drama directed by Juraj Jakubisko, Friel was nominated for that year's Czech Lion Award for Best Actress.[28] With a budget of UK£9.5 million, the film was the most expensive ever made in central Europe and broke box-office records in Slovakia.[42] In her review for The Guardian, Gwladys Fouché described the film as being \"bathed in a gothic atmosphere that tops every Dracula movie you've seen\", while saying of Friel, \"[she] spends two-and-half hours wielding swords, torturing peasants, surviving poison plots and making love to Caravaggio (yes, the Italian painter) to protect her land\", adding that \"[she] rolls her r's in an interesting attempt at a local accent\".[42] Her next project was the science fiction adventure film Land of the Lost—her first lead role in a major U.S. production—where she co-starred opposite Will Ferrell.[43] Directed by Brad Silberling and based on the 1970s television series of the same name, Lost was met with tepid reviews and poor box office upon its release in June 2009,[44][45] though some critics enjoyed Friel's portrayal of Holly Cantrell, a spirited palaeontologist,[46] remarking that she and Ferrell shared onscreen chemistry.[47]\n\nFriel returned to the stage towards the end of 2009 in an adaptation of Truman Capote's Breakfast at Tiffany's, which played at the Theatre Royal Haymarket for four months and gained notice for its addition of nudity,[48] with increased security being implemented at the venue after naked images of Friel—taken during a preview performance—were anonymously posted online.[49] The production received mixed reviews,[50] but Friel's portrayal of café society daydreamer Holly Golightly, one of her \"all time favourite heroines\",[51] was praised: Alice Jones of The Independent described her as \"infectious\", adding, \"Gorgeously gamine and wrapped, like a treat from Tiffany's, in an array of ever more extravagantly bowed cocktail dresses, she's a bewitching stage presence, at once perilously provocative and child-like\";[52] while Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter believed she brought \"confidence\" and \"considerable depth\" to the part.[53] In November 2009, Friel won an RTS Award for \"Best Performance in a Drama Series\" for her work as Dee, a struggling single mother who turns to prostitution, in BBC One's The Street.[54]\n\n2010–2019: Marcella and other leading roles\n\n[edit]\n\nFriel had key parts in three films released in 2010: self-destructive Iris in the Woody Allen ensemble comedy You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, ex-drug addict Melissa in Neil Burger's lucrative sci-fi thriller Limitless,[55] and depressed alcoholic Briony in the gangster drama London Boulevard, with her work in the latter being described as \"engaging\".[56][57] The following year, Friel played a fictionalised version of herself in an episode of the mockumentary series Come Fly with Me,[58] as well as starring as a ruthless pirate in Neverland on the Syfy channel—a prequel to J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan—and earning strong notices for her performance in the three-part mystery drama series Without You.[59][60] She then returned to the West End in a new version of Anton Chekhov's Uncle Vanya at the Vaudeville Theatre (November 2012 to February 2013),[61] receiving praise for her role as aristocratic newlywed Yelena.[62][63] Next, she appeared as a vilified probation officer in the BBC crime drama series Public Enemies (2012)[64] and headlined two British films: The Look of Love, a biopic where she played the long-suffering wife of self-made millionaire Paul Raymond, and the independent comedy-drama Having You (both 2013). In September 2013, Friel was cast as one of the main characters in the Ridley Scott-directed pilot The Vatican,[65] though—due in part to a negative response from affiliates of the Catholic Church—Showtime decided not to proceed with a full series.[66]\n\nFriel was cast in the lead role of Sgt. Odelle Ballard, an American special ops soldier on a secret mission in Mali, West Africa, in the thriller series American Odyssey. The NBC show ran for a single season between April and June 2015, with some critics comparing it unfavourably to Homeland; though Friel's performance was roundly praised.[67][68][69][70] She starred that same year in the World War II-set Norwegian miniseries The Heavy Water War (known elsewhere as The Saboteurs),[71] and in the drama film Urban and the Shed Crew, based on the memoir of the same name.[72] Her next major film projects were the independent dark comedy The Cleanse, revenge thriller I.T. (both 2016), and the Irish-Canadian crime drama Tomato Red (2017), where her role as a trailer trash mother drew attention for being against type.[73][74]\n\nFriel began playing the eponymous Marcella Backland in the British Nordic noir detective series, Marcella, in 2016. Speaking of her decision to take on the part—a former policewoman who returns to work to investigate an unsolved serial killer case—she told a journalist prior to the debut of the second season, \"I nearly pulled out of [the job] after I'd accepted it [because] I just thought, 'Oh God, how can I do this? There are so many amazing female detectives that have done it so well, I don't know what I can offer differently' … so when [the first season] was received as well as it was, I thought maybe I had done something that is different and I've put my own ownership and my own stamp on it\".[75] In 2019, Friel collected the International Emmy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Backland,[76] which Decider felt was \"extraordinary\":\n\nFriel is a master of expressions. From scene to scene the actress' face can shift from chilling hard stares to wide-eyed looks of terror. It's never completely clear what Marcella is thinking or what she's going to do next. Not only does this allow Friel to explore her wide range, but it adds to the unsettling tone of this show.[77]\n\nMarcella's third and final season debuted on Netflix in 2020,[78] with Friel commenting afterwards that a fourth season was unlikely to happen.[79]\n\nOn the second season of The Girlfriend Experience (2017), an anthology drama series produced by Steven Soderbergh for the Starz network, Friel played Erica Myles, an ambitious financier engaged in dom-sub partnerships with multiple women. Her performance was described as \"outstanding\" by The Atlantic[80] and \"fantastic\" by Variety, who added, \"sometimes [the camera] just focuses on her eyes, which can either well up with frustrated tears or shutter in Erica's emotions, as changeable as the sky reflected in a lake\".[81] Referring to the series' intense work schedule and the explicit nature of its sex scenes, Friel said that the role was her \"most challenging job to date\".[82] That same year, she was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of a destitute mother in the six-part BBC drama Broken,[83] with Metro's Sarah Deen noting, \"Friel excellently [plays] Christina's frantic desperation … all wild eyes, flapping shoes and dry humour ('I went to Mass and I got the sack. What am I gonna get tomorrow? Cystitis?'). You couldn't tell if her wit was genuine or hastily developed as a defence mechanism to stop her from bursting into tears\".[84]\n\nIn the ITV drama series Butterfly, which aired over three weeks in October 2018, Friel starred as Vicky, the parent of a transgender child. Lucy Mangan of The Guardian called the show \"important, truthful ... a wonderfully delicate drama that covers new ground carefully and features fully realised characters\",[85] while the New Statesman felt that Friel's portrayal of a mother \"racked by guilt\" was \"sterling\".[86] Friel said she and the show's creators felt a great responsibility to make it as realistic as possible: \"We met all these wonderful families, who were saying, 'please tell our story and tell it properly'. I said, 'do you not feel represented?' And they said 'no'. People have so many comments and opinions, but they actually can be somewhat ill-informed\".[87] The following year, Friel headlined the six-part miniseries Deep Water, which Metro described as a \"dark soap opera\", adding, \"The performances, with a very human and relatable nasty streak running through each one, [elevate it] to a must-binge drama … Friel excels when it comes to playing harassed women, usually ones with a secret to keep, and the actress completely [disappears] into [her character] as she [fights] to get her marriage back\".[88]\n\n2020–present\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 2020 horror film Books of Blood, Friel played Mary, a grieving mother who makes contact with her late son.[89] Based on a collection of stories by Clive Barker, Blood received mixed reviews,[90] though critics remarked that Friel's work was strong.[91][92] Her next project was the starring role of Sharon Pici, a Kansas City detective, in Viaplay's seven-part psychological thriller The Box (2021).[93] The following year, she co-headlined the Fox musical drama series Monarch opposite Susan Sarandon. Friel played Nicolette \"Nicky\" Roman, a singer-songwriter trying to continue her family's legacy while forging her own path in the country music industry. In his review for The A.V. Club, Max Gao said:\n\nFriel, not Sarandon, is the show's real leading lady—and a pretty great one at that … She belts out song after song, delivers memorable, fast-paced one-liners in a Texas accent (\"I was going to say be careful about the rats, but there's no need because… you're going to fit right in\"), and plays Nicky with such steadfast conviction that it's easy to wonder why she hasn't been more successful on this side of the pond since starring in ABC's Pushing Daisies … thankfully [this is] a role that is worthy of her talents.[94]\n\nFriel performed every song that her character sings—a mixture of covers and originals—herself.[95] It was announced in December 2022 that the series had been cancelled after one season.[96]\n\nIn the period drama film Charming the Hearts of Men (2021), Friel played Grace Gordon, a woman fighting for civil rights in 1960s Southern America. Her work drew acclaim,[97][98] with Film Threat commenting that her \"lived-in\" performance was key to Hearts' success.[99] She then appeared as Nicky, a Liverpudlian nurse helping one of her patients unravel a dark secret, in the British psychological thriller Locked In (2023).[100]\n\nOther work\n\n[edit]\n\nFriel has featured in print and television advertising campaigns for brands such as Reebok, Virgin Atlantic, Mulberry, Three, Pantene, and Marks & Spencer.[101][102][103][104][105][106]\n\nIn 2010, she co-starred with Michael Sheen in the music video for the Manic Street Preachers' single \"(It's Not War) Just the End of Love\", in which their characters were absorbed in a game of chess.[107]\n\nFriel works as an ambassador for the WWF wildlife charity.[108][109]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2001, Friel began a relationship with actor David Thewlis, after the pair met on a flight to Cannes.[110] Later that year, Friel collapsed and was rushed to a hospital, needing emergency surgery and two blood transfusions for a ruptured ovarian cyst.[111] It was discovered that she suffers from endometriosis and would have difficulty conceiving.[112] Despite this, she later became pregnant and gave birth to a daughter, Gracie Ellen Mary Friel, on 9 July 2005 at Portland Hospital, London.[113] Gracie was named after Gracie Fields, and her mother's grandmothers, Ellen and Mary. In December 2010, Friel and Thewlis separated after almost ten years together.[114]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Association Category Work Result Ref 1995 National Television Awards Most Popular Actress Brookside Won [13] TV Times Awards Best Actress Won [115] Smash Hits Poll Winners Party Best TV Actress Won [116] 1999 Drama Desk Awards Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play Closer Won [24] 2001 Genie Awards Best Actress The War Bride Nominated [117] 2007 Satellite Awards Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy Pushing Daisies Nominated [28] 2008 Saturn Awards Best Actress on Television Nominated [118] Scream Awards Breakout Performance Nominated [119] Golden Globe Awards Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy Nominated [39] Online Film & Television Association Best Actress in a Comedy Series Nominated [28] Poppy Awards Best Actress in a Comedy Series Nominated [120] 2009 Scream Awards Best Fantasy Actress Nominated [121] 2009 RTS North West Awards Best Performance in a Single Drama or Drama Series The Street Won [54] Czech Lion Awards Best Actress in Leading Role Bathory Nominated [28] 2010 Sun in a Net Awards Best Actress in a Leading Role Won [122] SFX Awards Best Actress Pushing Daisies Nominated [123] 2017 Festival Séries Mania Best Actress Broken Won [124] International Emmy Awards Best Performance by an Actress Marcella Won [125] National Television Awards Drama Performance Longlisted [126] 2018 British Academy Television Awards Best Supporting Actress Broken Nominated [83] 2019 Irish Post Awards Outstanding Contribution to Film and TV Won [127] 2019 RTS North West Awards Best Performance in a Single Drama or Drama Series Butterfly Nominated [128] 2020 National Television Awards Drama Performance Deep Water Longlisted [129]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1998 The Stringer Helen The Land Girls Prue (Prudence) 1999 A Midsummer Night's Dream Hermia Rogue Trader Lisa Leeson Mad Cows Maddy 2000 Sunset Strip Tammy Franklin An Everlasting Piece Bronagh 2001 The War Bride Lily Me Without You Marina 2003 Last Rumba in Rochdale Bodney (voice) Short Timeline Lady Claire 2005 Goal!
