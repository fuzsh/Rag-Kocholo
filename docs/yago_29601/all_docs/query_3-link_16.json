        "text": "You might have supposed this bit of narrative would be straightforward but as you will see there are some loose ends. I would be happy to receive any help.\n\nAccording to the encyclopaedic World Film Directors Volume 1, published in New York in 1987, just after Robert’s death, his first wife was Anna Lee – who he met on the set of The Camels Are Coming. According to Wikipedia Robert was married to Cecilie L Leslie from 1929-1934 before marrying Anna in 1934 (or 1935, depending on which paragraph you read).\n\nIf you read Anna’s own memoir she writes with certainty: “Because of his divorce, we were unable to be married in the Church of England. In the spring of 1936, we had to settle for a dull, unromantic ceremony in the Kensington Register Office in a room covered with a thin layer of dust. I was disappointed that neither my mother nor Auntie Winnie attended the ceremony.”\n\n“My dress, designed by Molyneux, was a pale greyish blue, called ‘sea foam.’ The belt and the collar were covered in pale blue crystal. I did not want a conventional gold wedding ring. Instead I had Asprey in Bond Street make a clear crystal one for me. I carried a bouquet of gardenias, jasmine, and stephanotis.”\n\nJack Hulbert was the best man but immediately after the ceremony Bob said that he had to go and see Micky Balcon at the studio “and help him iron out some problems.” Jack was charged with escorting Anna to reception at the Berkeley Hotel until Bob could join the party.\n\n“True to his promise, Bob finally joined us. By that time, the guests were enjoying the effects of an afternoon of champagne, and the party had become noisy and rambunctious. As soon as we cut the cake we slipped away to Cardinal’s Wharf (Stevenson’s house). The best wedding present I received were the positive reviews of ‘The Camels Are Coming.’\n\nLet’s consider this from this point. According to the International Movie Database (IMDb) website The Camels Are Coming was released on 31st December 1934. Wikipedia gives the release date as 1st December 1934. Either way there is no reason to believe that the film was released in early 1936 as Anna’s account suggests.\n\nSo let’s look at other evidence. Anna’s birth name was Joan Boniface Winnifrith. This is an unusual name, and a helpful one when it comes to tracking marriage records. Happily for us the record shows that in the final quarter of 1934 a Robert E Stevenson married a Joanna B Winnifirth in Kensington, London. A copy of the marriage certificate will confirm the exact date. (Anna presumably did not like plain ‘Joan’).\n\nWorking backwards what can we establish about Robert’s first marriage and wife? Wikipedia says that he was married to a Cecilie L Leslie from 1929-1934. This fact is generally repeated and accepted. The record shows that Robert E Stevenson married Cecilie L Leslie in the parish of Dursley, Gloucester between April-June 1929. Robert’s mother and second husband, Captain Abram Cottle, lived in Cam, a small town adjacent to Dursley. We can be reasonably confident about that fact.\n\nRobert and Cecilie (given as Cecile in the record) divorced in 1934. We know that Robert married Anna later that year. Cecilie remarried, in London, early in 1935. Cecilie was the defendant in the divorce proceedings. The fact that both remarried quickly might suggest that the divorce was reasonably friendly (Anna says as much in her memoir).\n\nWhat more do we know about Cecilie? Hers is an unusual name and there is only one in the British birth records that fits. Cecilie Leslie Leslie was born in the third quarter of 1908, in Rochford, Essex. There is an author Cecilie Leslie (1908-1988) and a small archive of her papers is held at Boston University. Her novels include: The Golden Stairs (1968), Award of Custody (1949), Goat to Kali (1948), The Rope Bridge (1964) and The Blue Devils (1951). Some of her novels are set in India and Burma and it seems possible that she travelled before finishing up in the USA. It is not certain that this novelist was Robert’s first wife. More research is required. These pages will be updated or corrected on receipt of more information."
