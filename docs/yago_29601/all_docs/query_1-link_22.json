She approached her diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer with the same acceptance of God's will, faith, smile, and humor that were the hallmarks of her life.\n\nAnna was born on February 12, 1934, in Gooding, Idaho. She was the eldest of 6 children raised by her mother, Bessie Marie Boyer, and step-father Glenn Miller.

She married the love of her life Charles (Chuck) Lee Meek, on August 1, 1952. They were later sealed in the Logan Temple on June 12, 1958.\n\nThey moved to Salt Lake in 1960 and raised their family. She had a strong faith in the Lord and was an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Anna served in many callings, but some of her favorites included working with children, youth and serving in the Relief Society. She and her husband (Chuck) served in the Leeds, England mission, where she supported and assisted converts and members. She developed many lasting friendships with the members in her mission, maintaining contact and returning to visit them later.\n\nAnna loved to read and helped guide several book clubs over the years, such that she was well known by the local librarians with the latest book club featured in the local newspaper. She also belonged to a sewing group, was an excellent seamstress, and made many of the grandchildren's and great-grandchildren's blankets, bibs, and afghans.\n\nMost of all, Anna loved being with family and friends and was always adding her sense of humor to gatherings helping to bring joy. She loved celebrating birthdays and will be remembered by her grandchildren and great-grandchildren for the annual birthday cards that she diligently sent, always signed love you forever.\n\nShe is survived by two brothers and a sister; Charles (Rhodora), Craig (Shirley), and Jane(David).
