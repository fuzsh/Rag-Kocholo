        "text": "Our project is all about celebrating seniors. An inevitable aspect is that in a matter of time, many of them will no longer be with us.\n\nI experienced this firsthand when my grandmother Anna Lee passed away this past winter. On February 28, 2019, she passed away peacefully at the age of 94 with us by her side.\n\nWe first featured her on Chinatown Pretty in 2017. When she was sick, I told my grandma that her unique style, warm smile and inspirational life story struck a chord with our readers – that 1,700 people liked each photo we’ve posted of her online. “1,700?” she asked, her eyes wide. “Did you count?” she asked.\n\nI felt so lucky that one of the most ho leng (or pretty) grandmas was our own, that thousands of people saw her beauty too. Though it wasn’t just the clothes that made my grandma beautiful.\n\nDuring her last days in hospice, I read a tribute to her. I told her how much I admired her. How she exuded so much grace – by the way she dressed, the way she would engage with people with attentiveness. How much I loved her laugh, the way her eyes pressed up against her glasses whenever she belted out a laugh, the kind that came from the gut. I loved the way she said my name.\n\nShe inspired me with her active lifestyle. Even a few weeks prior to her passing, she was still driving her Honda Accord to go on her daily ritual of dim sum and a two-hour walk around the mall.\n\nAt her service, we used the photo Andria took of her. My dad told me that Chinatown Pretty was a fun chapter in her long life, and that he felt fortunate that we had captured her looking as brilliant as ever, only seven months before she passed. I feel lucky that our project was a notable experience for her, as it was impactful for us.\n\nEven though she’s no longer with us, what I still have are my memories of her – the numerous visits to Canada which often involved back-to-back Chinese banquets, where I learned how to eat as much as she did (almost.)\n\nI also inherited her beautiful cheongsams, perfectly preserved 80s polyester shirts and high-waisted custom tailored trousers that fit me perfectly. Her closet has integrated into mine; every week I’m wearing several of her pieces.\n\nIn addition to her clothes, her spirit will continue on with me – how to make others feel considered, how to dress and eat well and how to live life fully."
