        "text": "The Stevenson House was the childhood home of Robert Louis Stevenson (1850 – 1894), creator of Treasure Island, Kidnapped and Jekyll and Hyde, from the age of six until he finally left in 1880.\n\nLiterature, however, had seized him. Edinburgh and the Stevenson House were still his home, and the centre of his imagination, but he began to travel more and further. London, Bournemouth, France and the Continent all drew him – for his health and sheer wanderlust. Ever and again, however, he came back to Edinburgh, that “meteorological purgatory” (Edinburgh Picturesque Notes) and this house.\n\nOn one of his voyages to France, he met his future wife, Fanny Vandergrift Osborne, and her family in an artists’ colony near Paris. Stricken by his passion for her he followed her when she returned to her home in California, and the couple were married at San Francisco in 1880. They travelled together to Europe shortly afterwards, and lived variously at London, Bournemouth, Davos and elsewhere, the locations more and more dictated by R.L.S.’s health. Poems, articles, reviews and novels were written in these years. Jekyll and Hyde, a tale of runaway science, self-experimentation and substance abuse grew from a series of vivid nightmares. Treasure Island was begun on a holiday at Braemar in Scotland at the prompting of Fanny’s young son. Kidnapped and The Master of Ballantrae followed on as his international fame as a writer grew.\n\nLittle known facts about R.L.S.\n\nR.L.S. Reading Suggestions\n\nMany of R.L.S.’s works are still in print more than 100 years after his death, and the lesser known books can usually be traced in secondhand bookstores without too much trouble – and much more fun than you-know-who.com!\n\nRead R.L.S.’s novels Treasure Island and Kidnapped, of course. Try the unfinished Weir of Hermiston too. The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is more talked of than read, so look at it as well. Stevenson wrote interestingly about the interface between European incomers and the South Pacific, and its effect on them: read The Ebb Tide as well as The South Seas and Island Nights’ Entertainments for this.\n\nThe real gems are the letters, however: Stevenson was one of the best and most prolific letter-writers we know of and the letters are available in a number of editions.\n\nEveryday life, drains, travel, and correspondence with about everybody who was anybody in late 19th century English language literature."
