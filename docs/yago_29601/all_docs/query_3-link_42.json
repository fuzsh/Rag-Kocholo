        "text": "Civil engineer\n\nMuch of the early building work of Scotland's lighthouses was undertaken by two innovative engineers: Thomas Smith, an Edinburgh ironsmith and streetlight designer, and Robert Stevenson. They built nine lights between 1786 and 1806; made improvements to light design including oil lamps, reflectors and clockwork mechanisms to rotate the beams; and developed techniques for increasing the height of the lighthouse buildings. Robert Stevenson's most famous project was the Bell Rock Lighthouse off the Angus coast which was built between 1807 and 1810. His sons, David, Alan and Thomas, followed their father into engineering. His grandson, Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894), son of Thomas, served three years as an engineering apprentice but later turned to writing becoming one of Scotland's foremost authors.\n\nBirth in 1772\n\nRobert Stevenson was born on 8 June 1772, the son of Allan Stevenson, merchant and Jean Lilly. The entry in the Old Parish Register (OPR) for Glasgow gives his father's surname as Stivenson, the date of baptism as 16 November 1772 and the witnesses as John Murdoch and John Wilson.\n\nBaptism entry for Robert Stevenson in the OPR for Glasgow (24 KB jpeg)\n\nNational Records of Scotland, OPR 644-1/15, page 354\n\nMarriage in 1799\n\nRobert Stevenson, merchant married Jean Smith on 28 May 1799. The entry in the Old Parish Register for Edinburgh shows that they were both from High Church Parish and that Jean was the daughter of Thomas Smith, tin-plate worker in Edinburgh.\n\nMarriage entry for Robert Stevenson in the OPR for Edinburgh (42 KB jpeg)\n\nNational Records of Scotland, OPR 685-1/52, page 295\n\nDeath in 1850\n\nRobert Stevenson, civil engineer and freeman of Calton, died on 12 July 1850.

These possessions include paintings and plans of the lighthouses he had designed.\n\nView transcript (120 KB PDF)\n\nThe images of the original document are in jpeg format (approximately 150 KB):\n\nView page 1 of the actual document\n\nView page 2 of the actual document\n\nView page 3 of the actual document\n\nView page 4 of the actual document\n\nView page 5 of the actual document\n\nView page 6 of the actual document\n\nView page 7 of the actual document\n\nView page 8 of the actual document\n\nView page 9 of the actual document\n\nView page 10 of the actual document\n\nView page 11 of the actual document\n\nView page 12 of the actual document\n\nView page 13 of the actual document\n\nView page 14 of the actual document\n\nView page 15 of the actual document\n\nView page 16 of the actual document\n\nView page 17 of the actual document\n\nView page 18 of the actual document\n\nView page 19 of the actual document\n\nView page 20 of the actual document"
