        "meta_description": "There have been four feature films made under the title King Solomon’s Mines, each of them crediting H. Rider Haggard’s Victorian adventure novel published in 1885 as their source. Several films, under different titles, have also claimed either this novel or its sequel Allan Quatermain, as their source material. While close adherence to an original text should not be the criterion for the merits, or otherwise, of a film, it is worth noting that only the first film version of King Solomon’s Mines shot in South Africa in 1918, retained the inter-racial romance found in Haggard’s novel. Later versions substituted an invented white female character as the romantic interest for either the book’s hero, Allan Quatermain, or his fellow adventurer, Sir Henry Curtis. This includes the most recent version released in 2004 starring Patrick Swayze and Alison Doody. That Haggard’s novel (and the first film of his book made thirty-three years later) featured a love story between a white man and a black woman would perhaps seem counterintuitive given the perceived racial mores of the time. Equally, such a love story should seem less problematic given the passage of time. That this is not the case, even in the first decade of the 21st century, this novel presents us with an intriguing example of modernity in reverse. This paper explores the strange trajectory of cinema’s iterations of Haggard’s King Solomon’s Mines.",

        "text": "1How have film makers responded to H. Rider Haggard’s novel King Solomon’s Mines? Four of the films bearing this title were either entirely or partially shot in southern Africa and consequently have a place in the cinema history of the sub-continent. Though the films and the methods of their making utilise ‘the visual technology of modernity’ (Tomaselli 1) what they depict is not necessarily ‘modern’ either in intent or content. In the words of film scholar Keyan Tomaselli, South Africa has experienced “a historically fitful, often brutal and chequered entry into modernity” (Tomaselli 1) and in his study Encountering Modernity: Twentieth Century South African Cinemas he cautions that prevailing notions of screen theory and modernity “do not automatically apply … as a feature of modernity in Africa, where the boundaries between pre-modern, modern and postmodern are often indecipherable” (Tomaselli 1). This paper takes a historical-biographical approach to the film versions of Haggard’s King Solomon’s Mines in illustrating that statement.\n\n6In October 1916 Lucoque set a up co-production deal with Isadore William Schlesinger of African Film Productions in Johannesburg to come to South Africa and make films of King Solomon’s Mines and Allan Quatermain “with massive casts and grandiose sets worthy of Italian and recent Hollywood epics” (Parsons 136) - namely Giovanni Pastrone’s ground-breaking epic silent film Cabiria (1914), featuring “gigantic sets” which “established a benchmark for epic filmmaking in the years to come” (Cousins 48) and was a key influence on D.W. Griffith’s Babylonian sets for Intolerance (1916) as well as those to be built in South Africa for King Solomon’s Mines and Allan Quatermain.\n\n9Lucoque would add to African Film Productions title list, shooting back-to-back productions of King Solomon’s Mines (1918) and Allan Quatermain (1919). English touring actors then performing on the Johannesburg stage were cast in the main roles: Albert Lawrence as Allan Quatermain, Holford Hamlin as Sir Henry Curtis, and Ray Brown as Captain John Good R.N. South African actors Vivien Talleur played Gagool (in heavy makeup and black face) and Bertie Solomon (also in black face) appeared as Foulata. A South African black actor named as Umpikayiboni played King Twala and an unidentified black actor was cast as Umbopa.\n\n10Lucoque was determined on authenticity and apart from shooting on the opulent sets built at Killarney he also went filming on location; later claiming he had travelled 35 000 miles in ‘securing the vital colouring’ (Parsons 123) for the two films. Locations included Victoria Falls, the stone walled ruins of Khami near Bulawayo in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe); Kalkfontein in South West Africa (now Namibia); Durban and Mafeking (now Makaleng) in South Africa, and possibly Swaziland. The elephant hunt sequence (from chapter four of Haggard’s novel) filmed at the Maputo forest in Portuguese East Africa (now Mozambique) was an especially commissioned hunt with a real kill.\n\n12In the book and the film, Foulata’s death is a convenient solution to the racial policies and prejudices of the period and, as such, easy to condemn but given the context of the time that Haggard was writing King Solomon’s Mines – in 1885 – that he was even prepared to countenance, and relate with some sympathy, an inter-racial romance was a daring departure from the norm. All the later film adaptations of King Solomon’s Mines have omitted the Good/Foulata love story by substituting a white woman, usually blonde, as the romantic interest.\n\n13An addition to Haggard’s story in Lucoque’s version was a prologue depicting the visit of King Solomon to the Queen of Sheba. As can be seen in illustrations 1 and 2, the visual inspiration for this scene and its elaborate set was the painting by Royal Academician Edward John Poynter, ‘The visit of the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon’, first exhibited in 1890 and the best known of Poynter’s large scale historical and biblical paintings.\n\n14Haggard first viewed King Solomon’s Mines at the trade screening held in London on 12 May 1919 at the Alhambra cinema in Leicester Square. The cinema was crowded and Haggard was later told by African Films Production staffer, Charles Holder Nesse,\n\nthat it was the most successful trade show that had ever been held in London. He said that during the whole performance only two people went out, which is the great criterion, and they had told him before that they must do so owing to an engagement. Nearly thirty-five years have gone by since the story was written by me and it is remarkable that it should still have so great a hold upon the imagination of the world. My belief is that it will live. (Haggard 1980 167)\n\n15According to the London Evening News Haggard “seemed very restless” (Parsons 142) before the showing. He had been shown to box with a bad view of the screen and moved to a balcony or circle seat. He appeared to enjoy the film and happily joined in the applause at various scenes.\n\n17According to W.G. Faulkner, writing in the Evening News, the “first two reels held everybody tightly. The ox-waggons, the crossing of the river, the South African scenes charmed us in spite of the fact that two principal players wore property beards, which the screen mercilessly exposed.” After that Faulkner thought the film “seemed, as far as the interest goes, to ‘drop off.’ The journey to the mines dragged while the producer was popping round this and that corner to get … pictures. The result was that we could never tell exactly where the explorers were” (142).\n\n18The African scenery was widely praised and Kinematograph Weekly considered the cinematography in the “brilliant South African sunshine is as good as can be, and indicates future rivalry with the famed Californian studios” (143). The Cinema agreed, adding: “It is a remarkable picture, full of interest, and presenting scenes and action that are rarely depicted upon the screen” (143). In the Bioscope’s assessment King Solomon’s Mines struck “a new note in film productions” and was mounted “on a scale approached hitherto only by the Italian and American film spectacles, the picture possesses distinctive characteristics as a pure African production’ and the film ‘a thorough novelty, as refreshing as it is interesting” (144).\n\n19Whatever the critics had to say by November the Evening News reported King Solomon’s Mines was “received everywhere with enthusiasm by exhibitors, and has been sold everywhere in Europe – including Germany – but excepting Russia” (144). The film broke box office records at the New Gallery Kinema in London’s West End.\n\n20The following year on 6 April 1920 Haggard opened “The South African Week” exhibition at the Albert Hall in London. At the luncheon prior to the formal opening Haggard gave a speech in which he “touched on the great responsibilities of the producers of films which have such an enormous influence upon the young. Many of these films, especially those that come from America, I am convinced do much harm” (Haggard 1980 191). The opening ceremony was followed by a showing of King Solomon’s Mines, “so far as I could see the Albert Hall must have been two thirds full, and after it was over the people poured out by the thousand. As the film has already been screened in various parts of London, this is remarkable and suggests that it must have considerable popularity” (191).\n\n21Back at the Killarney Studios in Johannesburg in November 1918 when filming ended on King Solomon’s Mines work began on Allan Quatermain once again (as can be seen in illustrations 3, 4, and 5) starring Albert Lawrence as Quatermain, Holford Hamlin as Sir Henry Curtis, Albert Lawrence as Allan Quatermain and Ray Brown as Captain John Good R.N. Umpikayiboni, the slain Twala, rose again to play Umslopogaas; Mabel May, Schlesinger’s wife, played Queen Nyleptha, Elise Hamilton Queen Sorais and Abie Barker was Alphonse. Haggard attending a private viewing of the film in London on 29 October 1919 recording his verdict in his diary on the same day: “It is not at all bad, but it might be a great deal better. I wonder if the cinema business will ever be adequately handled in this country. It has great possibilities but it ought to be in the hands of artists and strictly upright men.” (178).\n\n22In 1921 Lucoque, now operating under the banner of Reciprocity Films, formed another partnership with African Film Productions to make a film of Haggard’s novel Swallow: A Tale of the Great Trek (1899). The film, which departed completely from the original story, was directed by Leander de Cordova, a colleague of Lucoque’s, and released in 1921.\n\nKing Solomon’s Mines – the musical\n\n23The release of The Jazz Singer in 1927 with a synchronised sound track including dialogue and songs marked the end of the silent era. Several key scenes in The Jazz Singer involved its star Al Jolson singing in black face, a common device of the period on stage and screen now considered racist. Ten years later the first sound version of King Solomon’s Mines, a Gaumont-British production, released in 1937 starred the African American actor and singer Paul Robeson. The casting of a black actor in the leading role had a knock-on effect – supporting roles of colour, as well as the many extras, also had to be cast with black performers in conformity with the star.\n\n24Paul Robeson was “the most popular black actor the cinema had hitherto produced” (Davis 16). Between 1935 and 1940 Robeson starred in six British feature films and received top billing in all of them. “On four occasions he had solo billing above the title” (Bourne 13) and in King Solomon’s Mines his name appeared on the same pre-title credit above the names of Cedric Hardwicke and Roland Young, who played Allan Quatermain and Captain Good respectively.\n\n25Hardwicke, a stage and film actor who enjoyed careers in Britain and Hollywood, had performed alongside Robeson in the 1928 London stage production of the musical Showboat. Young, a character actor “remembered for a gallery of whimsical or ineffectual types” (Halliwell 1995 646) also had a successful trans-Atlantic career; similarly John Loder, cast as Sir Henry Curtis, a conventional leading man who also appeared in French and German films.\n\n28Primarily a stage performer, Robeson made only eleven films. Initially he had high hopes for the medium, believing the film industry could be used “to break the stereotype Negro usually portrayed and to present the Negro as a human being” (Schlosser 72). Unfortunately, the film industry appeared to be only interested in the stereotypes: “the Negro of Poor Old Joe and Swanee Ribber” (Schlosser 72). After his success in the film version of Eugene O’Neill’s The Emperor Jones (1933) Robeson hoped producers would see the “potential in the number of films that could be filmed starring a Negro - films that could use an African setting. Among the characters in which Robeson saw potential were the Negro Emperors Menelik and Shaka: and Rider Haggard’s Zulu King, Umbopa, from King Solomon’s Mines” (72).\n\n30Robeson’s enthusiasm was misplaced. Additional scenes shot during post-production “glorifying the British Empire and colonialism” were added to the final cut “without Robeson’s knowledge or approval” (Bourne 15). These scenes appear to have been the title and intertitle texts, for example one introducing the film thus: “Africa … Tens of millions of natives under British rule, each tribe with its own chieftain, governed and protected by a handful of white men whose everyday work is an unsung saga of courage and efficiency.” Robeson claimed the “imperialist plot had been placed in the plot during the last days five days of shooting” (Duberman 1989). He subsequently disowned the film.\n\n32In his next film, Showboat (1936), Robeson recreated his stage character Joe, singing what would become his signature song, Ol’ Man River. Then came The Song of Freedom (1936) in which he played John Zinga, a London dockworker, whose wonderful bass voice launches him on a spectacular career during the course of which he discovers he is the king of an African kingdom. Zinga then tums his back on success to serve his people in Africa. The film was made for Gaumont-British, who then cast Robeson for the starring role in King Solomon’s Mines as Umbopa.\n\n33Shot in black-and-white, this was the first sound version based on Haggard’s novel. The resulting film, much of it shot in South Africa, is a curious hybrid, part-adventure, part-musical; in all his films Robeson ‘was expected to sing, even if the plots did not necessarily require him to do so’ and here he sings four (Bourne 42). Robeson as Umbopa, accompanied by Quatermain, Good, Curtis and Kathy O’Brien head off into the African interior in search of her father, last seen en route to King Solomon’s fabled mines. Quite apart from the insertion of Kathy O’Brien and her father only the bare bones of Haggard’s narrative survive. Once at the site of the mines the adventurers encounter the evil Twala, upstart king of the Kukuana and when Umbopa is revealed as the true heir to the Kukuana throne, he is helped by his white companions to overthrow Twala; the cue for a spectacular battle sequence during which Curtis defeats Twala in a fight to the death with axes. Thereafter the adventurers head for the mines – in the interior of a bubbling volcano - where they find Kathy’s father and after being trapped inside by Gagool (played by an uncredited actor) escape in the nick of time as the volcano erupts.\n\n35The major part of the location footage was shot around the Natal provincial capital, Pietermaritzburg; other material was shot in the Drakensberg or uKhahlamba range of mountains in the same province and in the Cape Province.\n\n38The stand-ins flown in from London were Sam Lee, doubling for Cedric Hardwicke – “born a Cockney, [he] had travelled all over the continent and England, making films and mainly performing death-defying stunts” (Slosberg 254). Constance Barritt was the double for Anna Lee. The names of the stand-ins for John Loder and Roland Young are not known. Lee and Barritt can be seen on location in illustration 7 with the film’s South African publicist Bertha Slosberg and Robert Adams who played Twala and was the only key actor in the 1937 production to come to South Africa. In illustration 8 the doubles can be seen in costume on set at Otto’s Bluff\n\n40In 1936, Adams\n\n20 Bantu – at the time a word referring to negroid people in South Africa. A signature word of the apa (...)\n\nagreed to take the trip to South Africa, although he had been warned of conditions there. It was the most depressing aspect of the unit’s stay in Natal to find how the colour bar was put into operation. Adams had a room in the hotel - in itself an unheard-of departure - but he could not join the others for meals in the dining room. He wisely stacked his room with books on Bantu law, and the history of the Union, and made the most of his enforced confinement. (Slosberg 255)\n\n41The task of finding a stand-in for Paul Robeson was given to Bertha Slosberg, a young woman from Johannesburg with dreams of working in film and theatre. She first worked as a journalist, tried her hand at a novel, and was hired by Joseph Best to write a scenario for the film that ultimately saw the light of day as My Song Goes Forth for which, as noted earlier, Robeson narrated the prologue and sang the theme song. In an attempt to finance a trip to Britain she went diamond digging in Kimberley. The claim proved worthless - plus her first novel was rejected - when an uncle offered to take her to London. There she threw herself into the world of showbiz, interviewing film stars for South African magazines while scouting for job opportunities but unable to land a job and homesick for South Africa she decided to return; but by now she had a mission: “to create an African theatre with African actors” (192).\n\n42In Johannesburg Slosberg teamed up with the Mtetwa Lucky Stars Troupe of Zulu Players and, in her own words, became “the first white woman impresario to represent African native artistes in Africa” (193). She subsequently negotiated a European tour for the troupe and duly sent off applications for passports. These were refused and a theatre production staged at the Bantu Centre was nearly prevented on the grounds “white women were forbidden to enter this place” (223). Despite rave reviews the owners of the centre declared that after the show’s short run “they could not allow me to use the hall for further productions” (266). Another attempt to stage a production fell victim to a snowstorm, the first in Johannesburg for 25 years, which kept audiences away. Slosberg was at her lowest ebb when a letter arrived from Geoffrey Barkas in London asking her to find a double for Paul Robeson in King Solomon's Mines. “To find a Robeson double, even in a city as full of big black men as Johannesburg, proved a difficult task,” recalled Slosberg in her autobiography Pagan Tapestry (246). “I scoured locations, mine compounds, eating-houses, and factory yards. Armed with a tape measure, photographs, and studio information as to the exact size of the Robeson neck, head, chest and height, and his weight.” During her search she found “the Bantu held Paul Robeson in almost holy reverence. He was a symbol of a black man’s ability to overcome oppression and prejudice, and achieve universal acclaim ... the idea of even doubling for Paul Robeson was tinged with supernatural significance” (247).\n\n43Slosberg found the double for Robeson in the person of Joseph Benjamin Kubeka. Six feet, two inches in height and weighing in at 16 stone (101.60 in kilograms) he came from Sophiatown, Johannesburg. Kubeka was of royal Swazi descent and the brother-in-law of Arthur Edward Mshiyeni Ka Dinuzulu, Regent Chief of the Zulus, a brother of the late King Solomon Ka Dinuzulu. Kubeka was reluctant to leave his job as an insurance salesman and also not sure that acting in a film would be something approved of by his august brother-in-law. Only after Slosberg persuaded Kubeka that film acting was an honourable form of work and obtained an assurance from his employers that he would be re-engaged on completion of filming did he agree.\n\n44Once the set was complete and all the stand-ins and extras had arrived, filming commenced at Otto’s Bluff in February 1937. This choice of location was fortuitous as, coincidentally, it has a connection with Haggard himself. There is a tradition in the Otto family (after whom the bluff is named) that the young Haggard stayed with them as an apprentice-farmer. According to this story Haggard was hopeless at farming, preferring instead to spend his time thinking up his African romances while resting in the shade of a particular rock. A nice story, but that's all it is. Though Haggard lived in Pietermaritzburg for a couple of years in the mid-1870s when on the staff of the Lieutenant-Governor of Natal, Sir Henry Bulwer. Haggard certainly knew the Ottos socially, and probably went hunting on their land, but he never farmed there, though he did farm outside Newcastle for about six months in 1881 before returning to England to find fame as an author and later as a respected farmer and agricultural authority.\n\n45On the film’s release Robeson’s biographer Martin Duberman records that the New York Amsterdam News aimed at a black readership “expressed its gratitude that the film ‘at least doesn’t reek with the imperialistic theory of British superiority’” (Duberman 207) but the Pittsburgh Courier was wholly negative: Robeson “is made to sing childish lyrics to dreary tunes in the most unlikely circumstances” (207).\n\n46Another contemporary reviewer was Graham Greene:\n\n21 The quoted line is from Haggard, King Solomon’s Mines, p.9.\n\nKing Solomon’s Mines must be a disappointment to anyone who like myself values Haggard’s book a good deal higher than Treasure Island. Many of the famous characters are sadly translated … where is Sir Henry Curtis’s great golden beard … Mr Loder’s desert stubble is a poor substitute. Umbopa has become a stout professional singer (Mr Robeson in fact) with a repertoire of sentimental lyrics, as un-African as is his figure … Worst crime of all to those who remember Quartermain’s [sic] boast – ‘I can safely say there is not a petticoat in the whole history’ – is the introduction of an Irish blonde who has somehow become the cause of the whole expedition and will finish as Lady Curtis. (Greene 212-213)\n\n47Nevertheless Greene considered King Solomon’s Mines a\n\n22 Quatermain was misspelt in the credits as Quartermain in the 1937 and 2004 film versions of King So (...)\n\n23 The quoted line is from Haggard’s King Solomon’s Mines, p.13.\n\n‘seeable’ picture. Sir Cedric Hardwicke gives us the genuine Quartermain [sic], and Mr Roland Young, as far as the monocle and the white legs are concerned, is Captain Good to the life, though I missed the false teeth, “of which he had two beautiful pairs, that, my own being none of the best, have often caused me to break the tenth commandment” (what a good writer Haggard was). The one-eyed black king Twala is admirable, the direction of Robert Stevenson well above the English average, the dovetailing of Mr Barkas’s African exteriors with the studio sets better than usual, but I look back to the old silent picture which was faithful to Haggard’s story: I even seem to remember the golden beard. (Greene 213)\n\nKing Solomon’s Mines – ‘Technicolor Thrill Show’\n\n48Barring its title, Metro-Goldwyn-Meyer’s Technicolor production of King Solomon’s Mines (1950) bears little relation to Haggard’s original novel and Leslie Halliwell’s verdict that it “is largely travelogue with the merest trimmings of story” (Halliwell 1989 562) can be taken as accurate. Nonetheless, it should be acknowledged this “travelogue” was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Picture and won the Oscar for Best Cinematography in colour for Robert Surtees, while Ralph E. Winters and Conrad A. Nervig shared the Oscar for Best Film Editing.\n\n49This version of King Solomon’s Mines was directed by Compton Bennett and Andrew Marton and shot on location in British East Africa (now Kenya), the Belgian Congo (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), Uganda, and New Mexico in the United States. The production took advantage of an elephant cull in a Kenyan reserve for the hunting sequence; as in the silent version, featuring a real kill.\n\n50The film stars Deborah Kerr (as Elizabeth Curtis), Stewart Granger (as Quatermain) and Richard Carlson as the brother of Elizabeth Curtis, Captain John Goode. The names alone indicate the departures from Haggard’s text. Deborah Kerr (the “Lady with the Fire Hair” according to the trailer (IDMB) and her brother Captain John Good have come to Africa to seek her husband who has disappeared on his way to find King Solomon’s mines. Quatermain is hired to take them there. What follows is a stroll through African scenery during which, in a familiar film trope, the initially mutually antagonistic Curtis and Quatermain fall in love. Umbopa is reduced to a minor character played by a Kenya actor, patronisingly credited simply as Siraque; similarly with the actors playing Twala - Baziga - and Gagool – Sekaryongo.\n\n51The film is a time capsule of American and European attitudes to Africa prevailing at this period. A whole continent is relegated to a fantasy pre-modern era as exemplified by the film’s trailer commentary which speaks of Metro-Goldwyn-Meyer sending a motion picture company on safari “into the strange and wild interior of darkest Africa … where no white woman had been before” to film “the story of primitive savagery, of incredible danger” (IMDB).\n\n52In the film’s trailer captions Haggard’s original text is described as a “CLASSIC STORY of LOVE and INTRIGUE” set “In the PERILOUS JUNGLES OF THE DARK CONTINENT”. Referred to in the trailer as a “Technicolor Thrill SHOW!”, thrills on offer include the “THE SACRED DANCE OF THE GIANT WATUSI!”, “CHARGE OF THE ROGUE ELEPHANTS!”, “BATTLE CANOES OF THE FIGHTING MASAI!”, and an “ACTUAL DEATH FIGHT OF THE PAGAN KINGS!” (IDMB).\n\nKing Solomon’s Mines manqué\n\n55King Solomon’s Treasure (1979), a low budget British Canadian production directed by Alvin Rakoff is based on Haggard’s Allan Quatermain according to the front title credits. A mash-up of King Solomon’s Mines and Allan Quatermain starring John Colicos as Quatermain, David McCallum as Sir Henry Curtis, Patrick MacNee as Captain Good and Britt Ekland as Queen Nyleptha, plus a host of well-known South African actors, including Ken Gampu as Umslopogaas. Filmed in Swaziland (and Montreal, Canada) with shining white polystyrene sets and ludicrous special effects it “makes its predecessors look like classics” (Halliwell 1995 347).\n\nKing Solomon’s Mines in Zimbabwe and beyond\n\n57Sean Connery starred as Allan Quatermain in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003), based on the first of the steampunk graphic novel series written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Kevin O’Neill. In order to prevent a world war, Quatermain teams up with assorted fictional nineteenth century characters, including Captain Nemo, Tom Sawyer, Dorian Gray, Henry Jekyll and Professor James Moriarty. Shot in a variety of countries including Austria, Hungary, Malta and Morocco, the film had a troubled production history and the final result was poorly received by audiences and critics alike; it failed to generate a hoped for franchise and both original author and illustrator distanced themselves from the film. Connery was undeniably ‘a charismatic Quatermain’ (Maltin 803) and left this viewer for one lamenting a missed opportunity: a film adaptation of King Solomon’s Mines with Connery as Quatermain. Alas, The League of Extraordinary Gentleman was Connery’s final screen appearance and reportedly the reason for his retirement.\n\n‘What are the Russians doing here?’"
