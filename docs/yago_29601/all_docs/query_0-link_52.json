Throughout school, her interest in the American West was fostered through research about the role of fine arts in the creation of the National Parks.\n\nOriginally from the Great Plains of Oklahoma, Anna has admiration for wide open spaces. Her family has taught her to love and appreciate the outdoors through fishing, hunting, and many roadtrip miles in their suburban headed to new destinations. She has spent summers in Lewistown and the Missouri Breaks for more than half her life visiting her grandparents and falling in love with Central Montana. In her free time, you can find Anna fly fishing, playing with her black lab Georgia, or reading a good book.\n\nI’m so honored to be joining American Prairie in their ambitious efforts to protect the prairie ecosystem that I care so much about.

And also with schools, artists, explorers, and more. I'm so thrilled to get to work on building and strengthening those connections, while helping folks better understand, access, and enjoy the prairie.\n\nDan works as the safety manager for American Prairie and also assists with wildlife restoration projects.

In early 2002, he became American Prairie’s President. His initial priority was to assemble and slowly build, from scratch, a new, free-standing, Montana-based organization that would convert what had long been a spectacularly creative and ambitious conservation idea — carried forward and promoted by WWF and others — into steady, measurable, on-the-ground action.\n\nAmerican Prairie started with just two full-time employees. Sean and Dakota Meeks, with contracted help from Kayla Gerrity, began building and shaping the new organization’s infrastructure, systems and processes, and marketing and fundraising strategies. Most important was fleshing out and further articulating the holistic, compelling vision that would galvanize human energy and guide the actions of American Prairie and its collaborators over the next 17 years.\n\nIn early 2018, Sean passed the CEO role to his long-time colleague and fellow executive team member, Alison Fox. By that time, the organization had grown to 35 staff and 18 board trustees, raised more than $125 million dollars in private funding and had purchased twenty-six properties totaling nearly 400,000 private and leased acres. American Prairie had also built and opened two public campgrounds, Kestrel, and the Danny, Joey and Gigi Enrico Science and Education Center, and had reintroduced bison to the prairie.\n\nBy 2018, the National Geographic Society had included American Prairie as one of their most important examples of successful large-scale conservation efforts in the world as part of their Last Wild Places initiative. In addition, the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute had officially partnered with American Prairie to lead its core science efforts.\n\nPrior to joining the American Prairie effort, Sean was one of three original founders of Catalyst Consulting in Santa Cruz, California where he worked from 1985 until 2001. Catalyst, a firm specializing in organization development and management training and development, remains in business today and continues to work with clients around the world across a wide range of industries.\n\nSean grew up primarily in Great Falls, Montana, graduated from Montana State University and also attended the University of Oregon.\n\nHis current interests and projects include writing a book about his personal story of leaving private industry to take on the task of starting and building the American Prairie organization, and how he and his team kept the project moving forward during the very challenging early years. The book project is partially funded by the National Geographic Society and is scheduled for publication in early 2022.\n\nHe currently enjoys helping with American Prairie’s continued progress in his role as a board member, painting in oils and watercolors, and traveling and exploring the U.S. and the rest of the world with Kayla, his partner of 40 years.
