        "text": "AUGUSTA – David Leroy Wheelock, 88, passed away peacefully on Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2024, at the Maine Veteran’s Home surrounded by his loving family. He is now with our Lord and Savior where he has always wanted to be.\n\nDavid was born in Augusta, on Aug. 1, 1936, the son of the late Leroy Wheelock and Leta Mitten Colson.\n\nHe attended school in Augusta, joined the Army in 1955, and served in Germany for three years. Growing up, he developed a very strong work ethic. He worked from a young age picking beans, managing an ice cream stand and other various jobs to help support his family. After the service, he was fortunate to work with Leland Damon Howard to learn the ropes of running a business. He spent many hours along with his mother and brothers, Robert (Whipper) and Vance, devoted to establishing and growing Damon’s and Whipper’s, family run pizza and Italian sandwich businesses, that are still a vital part of the Augusta community today.\n\nOn Aug. 22, 1959, he married Eva Lizotte. They shared nearly 65 years together. They raised a beautiful family in Augusta and were devoted to growing their deep faith in the Lord. David and Eva were one of the founding families that established the Bread of Life Soup Kitchen. They were instrumental in supporting the Bethel Bible studies group for their church and hosted many retreats at their camps on Moosehead Lake. David was passionate about spreading the word of God and shared his faith whenever he could. They also supported the community by sponsoring many local sports teams over the years. David found joy in his family, and he and Eva hosted many large family gatherings at their house.\n\nDavid was predeceased by his parents; sister and brother-in-law Patricia and William Havey; brother, Vance Wheelock; nephew, Vance Wheelock Jr.; half-siblings Leroy, John, Billy, Gordon Wheelock, Nancy Lacasse, Phyllis Sutter, and Joyce Wheelock.\n\nHe is survived by his devoted wife, Eva; son Dennis and wife Kristina of Gardiner and their two sons Joshua, Alexander and wife Amanda; daughter, Leta Hill and husband Tommy of Sidney and their two daughters Megan Caldwell and husband Joseph and their children Nora, Charlie and Anna, Erin Campbell and husband Matt and their children Cohen and Griffin; daughter Brenda Lamb and husband Jeffrey of Winthrop, and their three sons David and his wife Nicole and their children Addison and Aiden, Jake and fiancé, Shannon Cooper and her children Gabby and Gavin, and Jeffrey Lamb and fiancé, Lynsie Peters; son Douglas and wife Michelle of West Gardiner and their children Lauren and fiancé Alex Boucher and Ryan; sister and brother-in-law Sandra and Stephen Crockett of Winthrop; brother and sister-in-law Robert and Rita Wheelock; sister-in-law Roberta (Bobbi) Wheelock; half-siblings Donna Perkins, Dianne Carr, Lillian Massie, Florance Sutter, Carole Meyer, and Ronald Wheelock. Uncle David will also be missed by many loving nieces and nephews.\n\nThe family wishes to express their appreciation to the medical staff at the Maine Veterans Home, Beacon Hospice and the Togus VA for their dedication and compassionate care.\n\nVisiting hours will be on Wednesday, August 14, from 4-7 p.m., at Plummer Funeral Home, 16 Pleasant Street Augusta. A funeral service will be held on Thursday, August 15, at 11 a.m., at the United Methodist Church in Winthrop, Main St., Winthrop. Burial and committal prayers will follow in Mt. Hope Cemetery, Winthrop St., Augusta.\n\nCondolences, stories and photos may be shared though the funeral home website at: http://www.plummerfh.com.\n\nIn lieu of flowers donations can be made to Bread of Life Ministries or Good Shepard Food Bank."
