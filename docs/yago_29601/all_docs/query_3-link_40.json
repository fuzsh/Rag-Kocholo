She went to Edinburgh to live with a married sister and, determined that Robert have an education but lacking funds for tutors or private schooling, sent him to a charity school which had been established by the local hospital.[2] His experience there impacted him so deeply that years later Robert Stevenson donated almost his entire salary from his first 'formal' job (building the Cumbrae Lighthouse) to the funds of the Orphan Hospital, to repay what he considered a great debt.[4]\n\nJean Stevenson had hopes that her son would enter the ministry,[2] but that did not happen. Instead, in 1786 (at the age of 14) he was apprenticed to a gunsmith in Edinburgh, and by 1791 he seemed to have settled in that occupation.[5] In November 1792, however, his mother married (second) Thomas Smith and Robert's life changed dramatically.\n\nEarly Career\n\nRobert's new stepfather, a widower with two daughters close to Robert's age, was a shipowner, iron merchant, and lampmaker in Edinburgh who had a fascination for lighting and was brilliantly innovative.[5] He was able to convince the government to allow him to substitute the open coal fires, which had up to then been used in lighthouses, with oil lamps that had parabolic mirrors attached to them. This effort was so successful that Thomas Smith was appointed the engineer to the newly formed Northern Lighthouse Board.[2][5] Smith offered his stepson an opportunity to work in his own office and learn how to build lighthouses, and Robert eagerly accepted the challenge.[6] He spent the summers learning how to erect lighthouse buildings, put together the large refracting lamps, and build macadam roads to access the lighthouses, which were frequently in very isolated areas.[6] He was rapidly given more and more responsibility, and Smith's confidence in him was so great that at the age of 19 he was put in complete charge of a project to build a lighthouse on the remote island of Little Cumbrae in the River Clyde.[7] By 1802 he became a full partner in his stepfather's firm and by 1808 he had succeeded Thomas Smith as engineer for the Board of Northern Lighthouses, a position which he held for over forty years.\n\nWhile his summers were spent learning how to erect lighthouses, the winters were spent acquiring a more formal education to help him progress further in his chosen career. He studied civil engineering first at the Andersonian Institute in Glasgow (later to become the University of Strathclyde) and then at the University of Edinburgh.[6] Although an excellent student, he did not receive a degree, a fact which he regretted many years later. \"I was prevented [he wrote in his journal]...from taking my degree of M.A. by my slender knowledge of Latin and by my total want of Greek.\"[8] Classics had not been a course of study taught in the Orphan School.\n\nDuring this same period of time (1794-1807) Robert also enrolled as a private in the First Regiment of Edinburgh Volunteers, which were raised as local defenders against the threatened French invasion.[9] He served in the regiment for five years before being promoted to lieutenant in the Princess (Charlotte's) Royals and later became a captain of the Grenadier Company.[9] When he began working on the Bell Rock Lighthouse he resigned his commission and his colonel, when accepting his resignation, requested he do them \"the favor of continuing as an honorary member of a corps which has been so much indebted to your zeal and exertions.\"[10]\n\nBell Rock Lighthouse\n\nThe first truly major project which Stevenson undertook (and the most famous of his career) was the construction of a lighthouse on Bell Rock. Bell Rock was an especially treacherous spot off the east coast of Scotland, near Dundee and right in the middle of the entrance to the Firth of Tay.[11] It had cost many lives and averaged six ship wrecks each winter,[11] but the logistics of building a lighthouse on a rock that was eleven miles off the coast and, at high tide, was submerged twelve feet under water were daunting. The situation became even more urgent in 1799 when, during a storm, the 64-gun warship HMS York became one more victim of the dangerous rock and all 491 members of its crew were lost.[6][11]\n\nRobert Stevenson visited Bell Rock for the first time in 1800, landing there at low tide while it was still above water. He realized immediately the importance of locating a lighthouse there, writing later that \"...the realities of its dangers were amply exemplified by the numerous relics which were found in its crevices: such as a ship's marking iron, a piece of a kedge anchor and a cabin stove, a bayonet, cannonball, silver shoebuckle, crowbars, pieces of money, and other evidences of recent shipwreck.\"[12] Following this visit he designed a model for a stone tower to be erected on the rock, but there was public skepticism that such a building would even be possible to construct.[6] Nevertheless, the Board of Northern Lighthouses applied to parliament for a special act that would empower them to build the lighthouse and provide the funding for it. With parliament worried about the potential costs of such a project and also concerned about Stevenson's lack of academic credentials, when it looked as though the bill would not pass it was instead withdrawn.[6] The Board then solicited John Rennie, one of the foremost engineers in Scotland at that time, to present along with Stevenson the argument for building the lighthouse, and the bill was resubmitted to parliament. It passed 21 July 1806[6] and Rennie, who had never built a lighthouse in his life but had a degree in engineering, was appointed chief (or consulting) engineer while Stevenson drew up all the plans and actually oversaw the construction. Rennie seldom visited Bell Rock to observe the lighthouse's construction. It is said that he would occasionally send suggestions for alterations in the design, which Stevenson would then politely ignore.[6]\n\nThe work at Bell Rock was laborious. The workmen used pickaxes and could only work the two hours before and after low tide, when the rock was not submerged.[11] It was necessary even to invent the tools that were needed to erect the lighthouse: a temporary beacon barrack so the workmen had a place to stay (in the beginning they lived on a ship and sailed to the rock each day); an elevated cast-iron railway across the rock to help move supplies; and movable jib and iron balance cranes.[5] Stevenson pioneered at Bell Rock a number of innovative ideas that have since been copied in lighthouses around the world: the floors were bonded to the walls in order to prevent outward thrust; the tower was protected internally and externally from lightening strikes; the lighting device (parabolic reflectors of silvered copper combined with argand burners and arranged on a four-sided frame) was the most sophisticated ever seen at that time; and it was the first light ever to show alternate red and white flashes.[6] The stone tower stood nearly 100 feet above the base rock, and the lantern room projected up another fifteen feet. The lamp was first lit 1 February 1811.[13]\n\nAdditional Professional Accomplishments\n\nDuring the course of his career, Robert Stevenson designed and constructed at least eighteen lighthouses,[5] but his practice was not confined to lighthouses alone. He also built a number of bridges, and his design for a suspension bridge where the road passes above the chains (negating the use of tall piers) was the first of its kind in the world and has been widely copied.[6] He also pioneered the use of malleable iron rails on railway tracks (instead of cast iron or wood),[6] and he invented the hydrophore to obtain samples of sea and river water.[5]\n\nHe published many professional articles, as well as being a contributor to the Edinburgh Encyclopedia and the Encyclopedia Brittanica. [5] He was a member of the council of the Wernerian Natural History Society[5]; a founder and director of the Astronomical Institution of Edinburgh[5]; and a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Geological Society, and the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.[5]\n\nIn 1829 Robert Stevenson received a gold medal from King William I of the Netherlands for inventing the use of intermittent and flashing lights in lighthouses.[14] A marble bust of Stevenson is displayed in the lantern room of the Bell Rock Lighthouse, and his portrait hangs in the National Portrait Gallery at Edinburgh.[6]\n\nAlthough three of his sons eventually became partners in his firm, Robert remained active in the family business almost until his death. He retired in 1846[14] and his grandson, Robert Louis Stevenson, later wrote of him \"...the joy of my grandfather in his career was strong as the love of a woman.\"[15]\n\nMarriage and Children\n\nRobert Stevenson married Jean Smith 28 May 1799 at Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.[16] Jean was his step-sister, the eldest daughter of Thomas Smith by his first marriage. Although they had thirteen children, only five of the children survived to adulthood.[17]Before the end of 1808 five of the children had died (a pair of twins who were still born, and three others who died of whooping cough).[18] There were more births and at least two more deaths.[19] The children whose names we know for sure are:\n\nJean Stevenson b. 25 Feb 1801[20]\n\nElizabeth Stevenson b. 7 Jun 1803[21] (died in childbirth)\n\nThomas Stevenson b. 7 Jun 1803[22] (died in childbirth)\n\nJessie Stevenson b. 8 Jul 1805[23] (died young)\n\nAlan Stevenson b. 28 Apr 1807[24]\n\nRobert M Stevenson b. 16 Aug 1808[25]\n\nJames Stevenson b. 13 Jul 1810[26]\n\nDavid Lillie Stevenson b. 11 Jan 1815[27]\n\nThomas Stevenson b. 22 Jul 1818[28]\n\nHis sons, David, Alan and Thomas, followed their father into engineering. His daughter Jean transcibed many of her father's journal notes for him. His grandson, Robert Louis Stevenson, son of Thomas, served three years as an engineering apprentice, but turned to legal studies and then writing. One of Scotland's foremost writers, his best known novel is `Treasure Island'.\n\nDeath and Will\n\nRobert Stevenson died at his home at Edinburgh 12 July 1850 and was buried in the New Calton Cemetery.[5][6]\n\nThe codicils to Robert Stevenson's will bequeath in detail his possessions to his daughter, sons and grandchildren. These possessions include paintings and plans of the lighthouses he had designed.[29]\n\nLegacy Achievements\n\nLighthouses:\n\nBell Rock 1811\n\nToward Point 1812\n\nIsle of May 1816\n\nCorsewall 1817\n\nPoint of Ayre 1818\n\nCalf of Man 1818\n\nSumburgh Head 1821\n\nKinnaird Head (rebuilt) 1823\n\nEilean Glas, Scalpay (rebuilt) 1824\n\nRinnns of Islay, Orsay, Inner Hebrides 1825\n\nBuchan Ness 1827\n\nPentland Skerries, Pentland Firth (rebuilt) 1827\n\nCape Wrath 1828\n\nTarbat Ness 1830\n\nMull of Galloway 1830\n\nDunnet Head 1831\n\nGirdle Ness 1833\n\nBarra Head 1833\n\nLismore 1833\n\nBridges:\n\nAnnan Bridge\n\nHutcheson Bridge (Glasgow)\n\nMarykirk Bridge\n\nRegent Bridge (oversaw construction)\n\nStirling New Bridge\n\nAllenton Bridge\n\nResearch Notes\n\nRobert Stevenson was attached to this profile in error as a son of Robert Stevenson and Jean Smith.
