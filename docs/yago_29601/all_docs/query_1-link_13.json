        "text": "We celebrate the life of Anna Lee (Caldwell) Overmier, who passed away peacefully at the age of 94 on May 31, 2024, surrounded by her beloved family. She was preceded in death by her husband, Bill; her sister, Evelyn; and two brothers, Jack and John. She is survived by her younger brother, Jerry Dear (Marilyn). Together she and Bill raised five children, Alan (Cyndi), Lynne, Terina, Richard (Mary), and Chuck (Deborah). Ann is survived by her nine grandchildren, eighteen great-grandchildren, one great-great grandchild, and another on the way.\n\nShe had impeccable style, always donning a perfectly matched purse with her outfit, and never leaving the house without putting on lipstick. A woman of deep faith, Ann loved God with all of her heart. She loved going to church after making a fresh batch of homemade waffles for the family every single Sunday.\n\nAnn was the glue that held the family together, always seeing the positive in everyone and every situation. Her warm presence was a constant source of comfort and joy. She was loved by ALL and she loved ALL! She was always surrounded by generations of family, all of whom were the light of her life.\n\nThough she has left us, her legacy of love, strength, resilience and faith will continue to guide and inspire those who had the privilege of knowing her.\n\nInterment will be Monday, June 10, 2024, 10:00 a.m., at Sunset Memorial Park, 924 Menaul Blvd. NE. This will be followed by a service at 11:00 a.m. to celebrate Ann's life at Grace Methodist Church, 420 San Lorenzo Ave. NW, Albuquerque, NM 87107, formerly known as Harwood United Methodist, where Ann sang in the choir and was secretary for several decades. Reception will be held in the church hall.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to Bosque Trails Hospice (https://www.bosquetrailshospice.com/donate/ located at 303 San Mateo Blvd NE, Ste 104, Albuquerque, NM 87108."
