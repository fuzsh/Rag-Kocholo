Stevenson had already (too late) written James a letter, advising him ‘I have written and ordered your last book, The Real Thing, so be sure and don’t send it’,1 demonstrating both how eager Stevenson was to read James, and how eager James was to be read by him. The volumes, The Real Thing and Other Tales and The Private Life, contain some of James’s most cynical reflections on the profession of the writer. Thematically, most of the stories focus on the contrast between the idealised writer as inspired artist and the more humdrum reality of writing as a profession. (This topic would recur through much of Stevenson’s work, too.) One story from The Real Thing, ‘Greville Fane’, describes a prolific and popular, but insufficiently literary, female novelist. The narrator, a journalist tasked with writing her obituary, is simultaneously embarrassed by her career and respectful, admitting in the first paragraph ‘I didn’t admire her, but I liked her’,2 exemplifying the reaction of the average reader to her many novels. While ‘Greville Fane’ (the novelist Mrs Stormer’s pen name) toils at producing three novels a year while living the restricted life of a middle-class widow, her children harbour more upper-class aesthetics and tastes. Although she works hard to apprentice her son, Leolin, to her craft, he proves to be an unproductive writer, all the while disparaging his mother’s lack of sophistication in both art and society. In the end, the narrator alleges, Leolin only ever uses his mother’s work, while simultaneously appropriating her increasingly diminishing earnings. She does not see it this way. Instead, she distinguishes between the ‘form’ and the ‘substance’ of art, fondly\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 1\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\n2\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson and the Art of Collaboration\n\ncrediting her profligate son with providing the latter by means of his extravagant living: Leolin had been obliged to recognise insuperable difficulties in the question of form, he was so fastidious; so that she had now arrived at a definite understanding with him (it was such a comfort) that she would do the form if he would bring home the substance. That was now his position – he foraged for her in the great world at a salary.3\n\nThere is much to say here about James’s ironic treatment of the work of art being split into ‘substance’ and ‘form’. I will limit myself to pointing out the obvious: that within mimetic practice (and Greville Fane is a Trollopian realist) only form can be art, since ‘substance’ would merely be life. Robert Louis Stevenson and the fictional Greville Fane were both popular, but in most other ways they were opposite: she is ‘matronly, mild, inanimate’ while he was a lean, charismatic bohemian; she had ‘not contributed a sentence to the language’4 while he was considered a preeminent stylist. But in 1893 when he received The Real Thing, Stevenson was actively bemoaning the lack of success of his latest and longest novel, The Wrecker (1892), co-written with his stepson, Lloyd Osbourne. Many of his acquaintances, including his publishers at Scribner’s, blamed the disappointment on the upstart young man. According to Barry Menikoff, Scribner’s believed that Stevenson’s collaboration with Lloyd Osbourne on The Wrong Box and The Wrecker was having a deleterious effect on sales: readers assumed that Stevenson was allowing his name to be used to help sell his stepson’s work, or else that Osbourne’s work was corrupting Stevenson’s. In either case, Stevenson was the loser – both in prestige and in his pocketbook.5\n\nJames’s story prompts us to ask many questions about the situation of the author in the late nineteenth century. There is first the question, as I have mentioned, of the discrepancy between the writer as an artist and the writer as a professional catering to a specific market. Greville Fane is adept at only the latter, and sometimes Stevenson worried that he was the same way. It also shows us the discrepancy between the illusion of the author-celebrity writing above the fray, and the reality of that person embedded in a web of relationships and beset by domestic squabbles and difficulties. Finally, most literally, is Robert Louis Stevenson as fond and naive as Greville Fane? Is Lloyd Osbourne Leolin Stormer? Is, in short, collaboration a con?\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 2\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nOn the contrary, by looking at a selection of texts both collaborative and not, I will argue that understanding literary collaboration is essential to understanding Stevenson’s writings. Stevenson often collaborated with family and friends. Early collaborations include three plays with his friend W. E. Henley. Later, he and his wife Fanny co-authored a volume of linked stories, More New Arabian Nights, also titled The Dynamiter (1885). He collaborated most extensively with his stepson, Lloyd Osbourne, with whom he wrote three novels: The Wrong Box (1889), The Wrecker and The Ebb-Tide (1894). Stevenson’s collaborations with Osbourne typify the critical problem my project addresses. Like Fanny Stevenson’s, Osbourne’s literary reputation has not been notable. Furthermore, there is evidence that Stevenson’s collaborations with Osbourne became frustrating. Why would this famous and successful author practise a writing process that burdened him with inexpert collaborators? The answer to this question can be found in Stevenson’s novels, essays and plays, which dramatise the process of collaboration. Stevenson creates an alternate narrative of what it means to write – one that challenges commonly held assumptions about the celebrity cult of the author in Victorian Britain, and notions of authorship more generally. This book is structured around critical readings of major Stevenson texts, supported and contextualised by archival research into unpublished manuscripts and letters by both Stevenson and his associates. I argue that it is not merely that Stevenson collaborated, but that his work is about collaboration – its benefits, but also its pitfalls. Stevenson’s self-reflective body of work reimagines authorship by examining the ways that authors choose material, negotiate the marketplace and, ultimately, maintain power over their own words, or let that power go. Characteristically, Stevenson’s exploration will not come to firm conclusions; for every moment in which he cedes authority, there is another in which he wants it back. Writing to his cousin Robert Alan Mowbray Stevenson about his co-written novel The Wrecker, he allows that collaborative writing leads to ‘greater richness of purview, consideration, and invention’, but claims the final ownership of the project, calling himself the ‘one person being responsible and giving the coup de pouce to every part of the work’ (Letters 8: 364–5). Stevenson’s work explores the tensions of the author, the space between the concept of the author as infallible producer of clear and unitary meaning, and the author as a medium through which the ideas of others are made to speak. What does it mean to be an author at the end of the nineteenth century? Stevenson’s fictions dramatise the process of collaboration and create an alternate narrative of what it means to write – one that challenges commonly held assumptions about the\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 3\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\n4\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson and the Art of Collaboration\n\ncelebrity cult of the author in Victorian Britain, replacing the subjectivity of the author with an ever shifting, multifaceted perspective.\n\nCollaborative Criticism Contemporary thought on collaboration and authorship begins with two foundational articles: Roland Barthes’s 1967 essay ‘The Death of the Author’ challenges the idea that the background or intention of the author has any special authority over the interpretation of a literary text, 6 and Michel Foucault’s response, ‘What is an Author?’ (1969), endorses the creation of what Foucault calls the ‘author-function’ – an idea of the author separate from the historical personage.7 Less acknowledged in criticism on collaboration, but equally important, is M. M. Bakhtin, whose notion of heteroglossia, or a multiplicity of voices or discourses, within the novel frees readers from having to think of novelistic style as emerging from a single and entirely unified consciousness.8 Bakhtin’s playful notions of discourse came close to the aesthetic values Stevenson expressed through his literary career, from his multi-plotted experimental works like New Arabian Nights and The Dynamiter to, near the end of his life, his fascination with the linguistic diversity he found in the Pacific islands. The most notable subsequent development in criticism on collaboration is Wayne Koestenbaum’s 1989 discussion of the erotic nature of male/male literary collaboration. Koestenbaum finds that collaborative writing attained its zenith during the sexually contentious years of the fin de siècle as authors enact on the page desires they are forbidden in life. There is something to this – my reading of The Wrecker specifically will examine the romance of the male partnership. However, Koestenbaum’s discussion of the Stevenson– Osbourne partnership specifically is quite literal, and his claim that ‘[Stevenson] understood the sexual implications of his relationship with Lloyd’ (146) is not borne out in the biographical studies.9 Not surprisingly, Koestenbaum is also dismissive of Stevenson’s collaborations with Fanny. Related to Koestenbaum’s book in approach is a great deal of work that takes on collaboration as a specifically feminist problem, from Bette London’s Writing Double, which looks at collaborations between women, to Holly Laird’s Women Coauthors, which looks at female co-authors, regardless of the gender of their writing partner.10 These feminist approaches elucidate Stevenson’s professional relationship with his wife, and in particular the prickly ways in which\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 4\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nthe pair negotiated, and not always successfully, the discrepancy between his fame and her literary ambitions. But because Stevenson did not collaborate with one person, or in one type of relationship, but in three, a more multivalent approach is required. Other works that deal with literary production and the networks and negotiations involved in publication are relevant to my thinking about collaboration, though they may not specifically address the kind of partnered collaboration I look at in this study. Jack Stillinger’s challenge to the romantic conception of the ‘solitary genius’ and Jerome McGann’s observations that texts reflect a series of negotiations rather than the intent of a single author both argue that literary production involves a vast network of players, including editors and publishers, a network obscured by any focus on authorial intent (McGann) or on genius (Stillinger).11 Adding to this discussion, I posit that in order to define collaboration, we must consider four essential questions: is it acknowledged? is it mutual? is it equal? and is it separable? All authors receive advice from others, making all texts in a sense collaborative, but I propose that texts in which the collaboration is mutually undertaken and overtly acknowledged differ fundamentally from traditionally authored texts. On the other hand, I argue that criticism of collaboration has been hampered by the assumption that true collaboration must be evenly divided (all of Stevenson’s collaborations were, in one way or another, unequal ones), and that the business of the critic is to solve the ‘problem’ of who has written what, a project which I argue shows an a priori scepticism about the possibility of collaboration at all. Like Stevenson and his associates, I believe that collaborative writing encompasses more than the sum of its parts.\n\nIs it acknowledged? Literary labour, by its nature, is almost always collaborative in some sense or other. Every author responds to the influence of literary history, speaks back to his or her contemporaries, and gets feedback from family, friends, editors and publishers. Authors are social beings after all. Jerome McGann argues that texts come not from a single author but from a series of discussions and compromises between authors, editors, publishers and others tasked with turning an author’s earliest ideas into a book.12 This shows how central collaboration is to authorship, but it also threatens our ability to look at collaboration as a focused and specific endeavour. In seeing the\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 5\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\n6\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson and the Art of Collaboration\n\ncollaborative nature of all writing (or at least all published writing), we must also take care to distinguish this ordinary, unavoidable kind of collaboration from that work that is undertaken from the beginning in a collaborative process, which therefore remains differently thought of from its very conception. Koestenbaum finds the dual author title page to be a significant boundary of collaboration: A text is most precisely and satisfyingly collaborative if it is composed by two writers who admit the act by placing both of their names on the title page. A double signature confers enormous interpretive freedom: it permits the reader to see the act of collaboration shadowing every word in the text. Collaborative works are intrinsically different than books written by one author alone: even if both names do not appear, or one writer eventually produces more material, the decision to collaborate determines the work’s contours, and the way in which it can be read. Books with two authors are specimens of a relation and show writing to be a quality of motion and exchange, not a fixed thing.13\n\nFocusing on the decision to collaborate within a specific relationship means that the kinds of collaborations that I am most interested in are primary collaborations between author and author, and not the ways in which the literary marketplace is collaborative, although this is of course true, and important for Stevenson as well. Critics have long noted the interventions of various of his friends, family and associates in the final form his texts took, and with varying levels of consent from Stevenson himself. The most important figure in this context is Stevenson’s friend Sidney Colvin, who has often been credited with, or accused of, editing or censoring Stevenson’s work. In Barry Menikoff’s re-edited version of Stevenson’s late Pacific novella, The Beach of Falesá (1892), for instance, Menikoff writes: But in truth he had become the source of production with little control over the final product. Stevenson was a machine whose creative workings were alien to all those around him. He supplied the art: a variety of producers were integral in its finishing, marketing, and distribution.14\n\nMenikoff critiques Colvin’s decision to edit The Beach of Falesá in such a way as to bring it more in line with a late-Victorian sense of propriety by revising the fake marriage certificate with which the young Pacific Islander Uma is married to the ugly white colonial trader\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 6\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nWiltshire. In the earlier version the certificate had Uma married to Wiltshire for one night, but periodical publications either left this out or changed the duration to one week, which seems hardly better.15 Menikoff’s own work was to reissue the novel in order to restore Stevenson’s original intentions more fully. However, as McGann points out, intentions need not be everything, because editors routinely surpass or undermine authorial intentions by, for example, publishing work that was never intended for publication, even as they gesture to authorial intention as a final goal.16 If we follow McGann instead of Menikoff, perhaps Colvin should truly be seen as a collaborator, and The Beach of Falesá, as originally published, a co-authored text. There is much to say about the Stevenson/Colvin relationship, but I have not, in my analysis, chosen to view Sidney Colvin as one of Stevenson’s collaborators, for the simple reason that Stevenson appears not to have viewed him that way, and thus the writing is not relational in the same way as his explicit, acknowledged collaborations. Arguments such as McGann’s or Stillinger’s are necessary and important because they highlight that the ways we have conventionally thought of authorship, one person as the single originator of meaning and text, is wrong. Writing has always been social, and so the collaborative mode of writing is not as revolutionary as some might have it. And yet, this is not to say that there should be no distinction between writing intended as collaborative and that which merely, as all writing must, shows the influence of other people. Not every text I will consider in this book bears the name of two authors. And yet, many of Stevenson’s books do bear the names of two authors, and this merits consideration, because it represents a deeper commitment to collaboration throughout the writing process. This question of acknowledged or unacknowledged collaborators has been an especially fraught one within feminist criticism, where it has long been recognised that women’s labour is not acknowledged at the same rate as men’s, and that the work of many men of genius has been aided by wives or other female family members who have received little credit for their talents. The evidence for this is in the renewed interest in thinkers such as Dorothy Wordsworth, whose journals formed a significant portion of the writings of her betterknown brother.17 Stevenson was unusual in crediting his wife Fanny for her co-authorship of The Dynamiter. He certainly didn’t have to, as far the world was concerned, and it might have been better received if he had not. It is in a way ironic that Stevenson is an unacknowledged collaborator on his wife’s own publication, The Cruise of the\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 7\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\n8\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson and the Art of Collaboration\n\nJanet Nichol among the South Sea Islands, published years after his death, her purportedly private diary which describes one of the family’s cruises in the Pacific.\n\nIs it mutual? Another reason that I have decided to exclude Sidney Colvin’s influence on Stevenson’s work from this work on collaboration is that collaboration minimally requires a mutual conversation between collaborators. Where I have found it in some cases relevant to consider contributors who were unacknowledged, in all cases they were working with Stevenson’s consent and feedback. In her discussion of Colvin’s work on Stevenson’s Complete Works, for instance, biographer Jenni Calder notes that while Stevenson was in Samoa and far away from the publishing world, ‘it was virtually impossible for him to be more involved than he was, but he was also willing to leave editorial problems to Colvin – in spite of the fact that he did not trust Colvin on some issues.’18 This editing after the fact, with or without Stevenson’s approval, does not rise to the level of working together because there is little give and take. Still less do I consider posthumous revisions such as Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch’s completion of Stevenson’s unfinished novel St. Ives. Stevenson had no thought, when he died, that this was a collaborative novel, nor did QuillerCouch have the benefit of feedback and conversation with Stevenson about it. One cannot, as a rule, collaborate with the dead, and collaboration is not the same thing as influence (Bette London’s choice to include mediums in her study of collaborations notwithstanding). When, in his essay ‘My First Book’ (often used as the Preface to Treasure Island), Stevenson credits Washington Irving with originating many of the ideas in that novel,19 it does not make Treasure Island a collaboration between Irving and Stevenson. Nor is plagiarism collaboration, which seems like it should be an obvious point, and yet is a problem that caused the Stevensons some trouble. In my third chapter, on Fanny Stevenson’s collaborations, I present evidence that Fanny may have believed that she was collaborating with Louis’s cousin Katharine de Mattos when she published her short story ‘The Nixie’ in Scribner’s in 1888. De Mattos, who claimed that the original idea for the story had been her own, was furious at the theft, and the resulting accusation of plagiarism was one of the motivating causes for the final rift between Louis and his own collaborator, W. E. Henley. This is collaborative failure.\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 8\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nIs it equal? One particular problem that has dogged consideration of Stevenson’s collaborations is the question of the relative talent, and contribution, of the partners. Of Stevenson’s three principal collaborators, W. E. Henley, Fanny Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne, only Henley would likely have had a respectable career in letters independent of his relationship with Stevenson. His series of poems, In Hospital, describing the operations on his legs at the Edinburgh hospital are still anthologised in Victorian poetry collections, and his poem ‘Invictus’ remains popular among readers who admire its stoic self-determinism. Its final lines, ‘I am the master of my fate, / I am the captain of my soul’, have made it something of a conservative rallying cry in Britain, and kept it frequently in the news. 20 As quotable as Henley’s famous poem remains, his reputation has been greatly overshadowed by the more famous Stevenson. Furthermore, with the possible exception of The Wrong Box, which Osbourne conceived of and carried out a significant portion of before Stevenson’s involvement, Stevenson saw himself as the chief author on each work on which he collaborated. Not only did he take responsibility for the final decisions on each one, but in most cases he dictated the terms of the collaboration, giving his partners assignments to fulfil and then checking them over. This acknowledged inequality of partners has led critics to dismiss the collaborations. Edwin Eigner, for example, says that The Wrecker and The Ebb-Tide ‘can be regarded as almost entirely Stevenson’s own’ and that he will therefore treat those texts ‘without reference to the influence of his collaborator, which is anyway . . . almost impossible to perceive’.21 After all, if Stevenson admits to having the larger part in the project, why consider the lesser partner at all? And particularly since Fanny Stevenson and Osbourne have, traditionally, found little respect among critics for their other literary productions, readers have felt that their contributions could only harm and not help any project to which they contributed. For instance, biographer Ian Bell writes of The Wrecker: ‘Had [Stevenson] put aside his desire to help Lloyd – or quelled his own laziness – it would have been a better novel than it is.’22 Furthermore, my reading of the criticism shows that critical evaluations of the works themselves affect the determination of whose contribution is greater, and vice versa. Critics who wish to dismiss a work from the canon inevitably claim that it is mostly the work of Stevenson’s collaborator. Critics who argue for its greater significance tend to minimise this contribution. This pattern maintains across readings of all of Stevenson’s works, but\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 9\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\n10\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson and the Art of Collaboration\n\nis particularly strong in relation to the novels The Dynamiter (with Fanny) and The Wrong Box (with Osbourne). However, it is not selfevident why readers should feel this way. In the case of Stevenson’s collaborations, all of which he undertook with authors of lesser reputations, one suspects a defensiveness at play, against readers wary of being tricked into a too positive appraisal of a hack writer. If (as in my earlier question of whether the collaboration is equal) we are able to parse out the authorship of different sections of a text, we may not have to deal with the tricky elements of collaboration at all. Any textual study I do that would identify anything as written by one author as opposed to another is from interest in the process only. I do not intend to excise the perennially unpopular Lloyd Osbourne, or any other collaborator, from Stevenson’s writings. Nor do I intend to recover Fanny, Lloyd, Henley or anyone else as the true author of any of the works I discuss. Nor is it fair, in this context, to draw conclusions about the relative talents and contributions of Stevenson’s collaborators, partly because it was Stevenson himself who set the terms of the partnerships and divided the labour. Ironically, for an author who is experimenting in this way with collaborative writing, Stevenson remains as authoritarian in regard to his work as he could possibly be. It is certainly worthwhile work to look at independent publications of his partners, as, for instance, Gordon Hirsch has done with regard to Osbourne and Hilary Beattie with regard to Fanny Stevenson.23 As a poet, Henley requires no defence. But to critique their contributions to the texts on which they each collaborated is to miss the point that their roles were circumscribed by Stevenson’s overarching vision. Rather, I want to discover how the work of authorship may inhere in the relationships and the space between the collaborators. The literature on collaboration is full of other similarly unequal partners. Renaissance dramatists Beaumont and Fletcher, for instance, were famously unequal partners,24 and Stevenson jokingly refers to their lopsided partnership in a letter to Henley (Letters 2: 277). This idea that collaborative labour is not relevant unless it is equal is an easy way to dismiss the collaborative because it is much easier to prove an unequal contribution than a truly equal one, which is unlikely mathematically, at least. If one person may be proved to have contributed more, he (in this case) becomes the author and authority. This tendency is more legal than descriptive, as one author simply seems easier if one person might be said to have contributed more. A number of critical assessments of collaboration and ideas of authorship have indeed found that the idea of the author originates in\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 10\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nthe material and legal status of copyright. For instance, Peter Jaszi and Martha Woodmansee describe the ways that our idea of the author at once creates and is constrained by the law. At first the ‘ideology of “authorship” informed English – and ultimately American – copyright doctrine’, but this very ideology obscures the collaborative and corporate way that writing actually progresses.25 Thus, the law becomes ‘one of the most powerful vehicles of the modern authorship construct’.26 The specifics of copyright law can have a chilling effect on experimentation with authorship. Clare Pettitt has argued that early Victorian debates about intellectual property law affected, and were affected by, nineteenth-century ideas of authorship, and that the idea of the solitary writer was underwritten and perpetuated by the changes in intellectual property law in the nineteenth century. The debate around the reform of intellectual property law at this time is an important one as it shows the tenacity of literary writers such as Dickens in protecting such an obsolescent idea against the arguments of the free-trade anti-monopolists who wanted to abolish both copyright and patent protections.27\n\nHowever, this construction was at odds with the changing nature of early and mid-Victorian authorship, which was influenced by the rapidly changing technology and dispersal of novels. Pettitt argues of Dickens, for example, that The double-text of Bleak House, therefore, raises questions about the origin of art, and the ownership of the art object. Many mid-Victorian novels reflect both explicitly and silently upon such questions at a time when the Romantic notion of the single author was coming under unprecedented pressure.28\n\nMeanwhile, in America during the same period, critic David Dowling argues that authorship is ‘socially driven, diverse, and dependent on the economies of circulation in the literary market, a perspective that dismantles the myth of the autonomous romantic artist’.29 The legal and financial pressures of authorship limits the creative possibilities for thinking about collaboration, and encourages both authors and critics to find, and credit, the single voice, a necessity that goes strongly against Stevenson’s own broad experimentations with different modes of authorship. The material basis for the construction of authorship could go the other way too, though, as Ernest Mehew has found in discussion of\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 11\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\n12\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson and the Art of Collaboration\n\nStevenson’s collaborations with Osbourne. As an American, Osbourne was able to secure the American copyright, a treasured possession when Stevenson, like so many authors, was beset by plagiarisms from across the pond.30 While I acknowledge the importance of economic pressures on the idea of authorship, a survey of British and American copyright effects is beyond the scope of this book, and besides, I find that Stevenson’s creative practice exceeds these considerations even as it is affected by them, or as Pettitt allows, ‘The aesthetic is necessarily more than an ideological category.’31\n\nIs it separable? Of all of the questions that arise when we examine collaborative writing, however, the most persistent is whether it is possible, or advisable, to separate out the true authors of different sections of a collaborative text. When faced with a collaborative text, most critics and readers will ask: who wrote what? A recent intervention into collaborative Stevenson is the work of digital scholars Anouk Lang and Robyn Pritzker, who have been using stylometric tools to analyse The Dynamiter (as well as other collaborative Stevenson works) to see ‘where Fanny’s authorial signal comes through the text most strongly’.32 This quantitative, digital approach follows a long tradition of critics who have argued strongly for their own abilities as merely experienced readers to easily detect Fanny’s ‘authorial signal’, as I will discuss in my own treatment of The Dynamiter. Where reliable manuscript evidence tells us that certain sections of text have been written by one or another author, I share it, because one of the main investigations of this book is to discover the process used by Stevenson and his collaborators. However, there are several problems with this ‘separation style’ of criticism as a main approach to collaborative texts. The principal problem with separating out the authors of a collaborative work is that this kind of focus directly undermines the aim of collaboration. Consider the case of the late-Victorian poet (or poets) Michael Field – Katherine Bradley and Edith Cooper, aunt/ niece and lovers who wrote under the masculine pseudonym. The pair were troubled by frequent attempts to parse their writing – to figure out who wrote what, reportedly responding to Havelock Ellis, ‘As to our work, let no man think he can put asunder what god has joined.’33 Critic Lorraine York continues, ‘Authorship itself is not significantly re-theorized or rethought in this view of collaboration.\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 12\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nOnce again the shared collaborative space must be territorialized so that the single, individuated authors can remain intact.’34 If the usefulness of collaboration inheres in the relationship, and not in just the single work of two authors linked together, then in untying these collaborative threads, the critic will necessarily lose an important part of the picture. Maryanne Dever, in her study of the twentieth-century collaboration between Australians Marjorie Barnard and Flora Eldershaw who wrote under the pseudonym ‘M. Barnard Eldershaw’ likewise criticises what she terms the ‘detective’ model of collaborative criticism: This reduction of the critical exercise to one of literary detection implies a particular set of assumptions about the way literary collaboration or joint authorship functions . . . This central preoccupation with the authorial signature assumes that the collaborative enterprise will invariably leave some textual trace or clue, while denying the wider collaborative context produced through conversation, correspondence, the sympathetic hearing or reading of a manuscript, the vigorously sought opinion.35\n\nBecause the process of collaboration is not, in fact, two authors writing singly but takes place in a multitude of conversations, something will always be lost when collaboration is seen as two people’s single compositions, combined arithmetically. In his discussion of network theory’s application to the early period of literary modernism (a period that Stevenson only barely predates), Milton A. Cohen cites Ezra Pound from 1912: ‘You must not only subsidize the man with work still in him, but you must gather such dynamic particles together, you must set them where they will interact, and stimulate each other.’36 Network theory provides support for this way of viewing the greater possibilities of collaboration over and above a yoking together of individual forms because it inheres in the relationship, and not in the individual nodes. Thinking outside of the novelistic generic box, as Stevenson always did, can also get us outside of the trap of seeing collaborative writing as comprised of two separate strands that might be untwisted. Much collaborative theory concerns drama, and for good reason.37 Where poets and novelists working collaboratively may be rare enough to be of note, in music, drama and, more recently, film-making, collaboration is the norm, and thus the instinct to separate out the authors is virtually non-existent. It is no accident that Stevenson’s first collaborative attempts, with W. E. Henley, were dramatic works, as\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 13\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\n14\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson and the Art of Collaboration\n\nI discuss in my chapter on Deacon Brodie and Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886). Though Stevenson was ultimately never successful as a dramatist, the various roles of the theatre – on and off the stage – never ceased to fascinate him, as he discusses in, for instance, his critical essay ‘Child’s Play’ (1878).38 Music, too, was a lifelong interest (he played the flageolet), not only for its own sake for also for the way it functioned as a metaphor for thinking about art. Music’s harmonies and discordances not only reflect collaborative work but, in fact, cannot exist without it. Stevenson’s fiction, especially his later Pacific fiction written with Osbourne, is littered with scraps of popular music reflecting this fascination, but it is in his engagement with opera that he explores the way musical roles may create productive, conflictual collaborations. In my chapter on Stevenson’s Pacific writings, I explore the way that he used opera to think about collaborative art and dissonance, exploring the ways that discord and argumentative voices could bring depth and complexity to narrative. Why is there, even now that the author is dead in both the Barthesian and literal sense, still so much anxiety over the fact of collaboration? In her compelling argument about the threatening politics of Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s collaborations with Robert Southey, Alison Hickey suggests that collaboration threatens our sense of the relationship between author and text in revolutionary ways, that it casts doubt on the authority of each [author] in relation to their jointly produced texts. Even as, in the political realm, the revolutionary refiguring of the patriarchal familial paradigm as a fraternity threatens the singular nature of political authority, so refiguring authorial paternity as fraternity jeopardizes the singular nature of writerly authority.39\n\nThe dangers of collaboration exceed the bounds of the collaborative moment or text itself, calling into question larger unities, between meaning and language itself: ‘The anxiety about authority is associated with written language in general, whose fabrications always bear an illegitimate relation to intention.’40 What comes out of his essays and literary criticism is that Stevenson never accepted this view of authorship in the first place in so far as he is always aware of his work being shaped by multiple forces, as he discusses most explicitly in his essay ‘A Chapter on Dreams’ (1888): forces including but not limited to his (pre-Freudian) unconscious dreaming self,\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 14\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nhis sense of the literary marketplace and its demands, and his acute awareness as a craftsperson, with long practice and experience, of the alarming gap between meaning and language. This gap is the most explicitly investigated in his essay ‘Truth of Intercourse’ (1879), which is the final essay in the series entitled Virginibus Puerisque (1876–81), which ‘presents Stevenson’s most sustained treatment of the difficulty of communication . . . The focus here is not on verbal truthfulness but on truth to one’s feelings, of sincerity in one’s relations to others.’41 Stevenson explains, ‘The difficulty of literature is not to write, but to write what you mean’, and that, even in spoken language, ‘the speech of the ideal talker shall correspond and fit upon the truth of fact – not clumsily, obscuring lineaments, like a mantle, but cleanly adhering, like an athlete’s skin.’42 The ‘skin’ here described is not the epidermis of the athlete, but rather the closely fitting clothes that approximate the body without being the body. It is, in other words, because Stevenson never accepts language and meaning as united, never accepts the idea of the originating genius as anything more than one of an array of sources for the creative work, that he is prepared to readily admit this radical experimentation with collaboration. In ‘My First Book’ Stevenson confesses to plagiarising Washington Irving in the creation of Treasure Island.43 Although the confession of plagiarism is facetious, his admission is a more enduring reflection on his artistic process. In his work on nineteenth-century plagiarism, Robert Macfarlane opposes two views of writing: creatio and inventio. Creatio is the notion of writing as original and divinely inspired, associated (falsely) with the Romantics. Inventio is the notion of ‘creation as rearrangement’ which is associated with the Augustans and more easily reconciled with post-structuralist views of language. Macfarlane’s study is interested in ‘the reappraisal of originality which occurred in Britain between 1859 and 1900’.44 As Stevenson shows when he falsely apologises for stealing from Irving, he is engaged in experimentation with art as inventio, pushing boundaries in his search for more and more original raw materials. Thus, we see in ‘My First Book’ Stevenson seeing Treasure Island as a revisitation of Washington Irving, and also Ballantyne’s The Coral Island, but in other places it is the work of his friends and family that he takes as his raw material to convert into art – whether that be W. E. Henley’s fast drafts of plays early on, Fanny’s tall tales in Hyères incorporated into The Dynamiter, or Osbourne’s complete draft of A Game of Bluff which became the co-authored The Wrong Box. Furthermore, even when not working collaboratively, this modus operandi structures\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 15\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\n16\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson and the Art of Collaboration\n\nStevenson’s thinking about his artistic process, such that he perceives even a schism in himself between the creator of raw material and the artistic interpreter, most famously in A Chapter on Dreams, his description of the creation of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde where he distinguished between the ‘brownies’ and ‘the man with the conscience and the variable bank–account’.45 Both, Stevenson argues, are required in the artistic process. Who has written what in Stevenson’s collaboratively written texts is not always relevant. Instead, it is in the dialogic space between Stevenson and collaborators that he finds his artistic process.\n\nLiterary History, Politics and Biography Two final issues that must be addressed in any study of late nineteenthcentury collaborations are the historical and the biographical. Why the nineteenth century? There has been much work done on collaboration in Renaissance scholarship because it is the period of the drama, an inherently collaborative genre: see, for instance, Heather Hirschfeld’s survey of scholarship on the topic and Jeffrey Masten’s work on collaborative drama and sexualities where he asserts that collaborative writing was ‘the Renaissance English theatre’s dominant mode of textual production’.46 The old idea, exploded by Jack Stillinger’s work on the Romantic ‘myth of the solitary genius’, was that this collaborative Renaissance gave way to an author-centred Romantic period, but this model has been so far rejected that scholarly work on collaboration has come to be dominated by Romanticists, with a significant amount of work being done on William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft, Dorothy and William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge with Wordsworth and with Robert Southey, and, in America, Sophia and Nathaniel Hawthorne.47 This now-rejected historical narrative continues by claiming that the Romantic ‘age of the author’ was undone by the busy marketplace of Victorian letters, and then dealt a further blow by the experiments that characterise early modernism. But collaboration has been practised in many times and cultures. Stone and Thompson note that ‘collaboration was long a feature of the texts produced by African American or indigenous cultures’.48 Stevenson himself used the model of Butaritarian opera to explore his own thinking about how art can incorporate a multiplicity of voices, as I discuss in my chapter on the Pacific diaries and In the South Seas (1896). Nevertheless, in the case of Stevenson specifically, I do find that there is something ‘avant-garde’ and experimental in his\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 16\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nuse of collaborative composition, and thus I find it time bound and linked to literary experimentation. The dominant conception of the Victorian author is that he or she was driven by the literary marketplace. Richard Salmon describes a conception of authorship that attempts to bridge two depictions of the author, as both hero and as a labourer subject to the market, which is perhaps best embodied in the figure of David Copperfield, who is subject to the vicissitudes of the market and yet remains unshakably the hero and centre of his eponymous novel.49 Yet at the turn of the century the identity of the author as hero was in decline. Malcolm Bradbury, who likewise notes the commercial pressures on the Victorian writer, describes the ‘marked gap [by the 1890s] between serious and popular imaginative writing and a declining commercial basis for the former, with avant-gardism emerging in reaction at the beginning of the twentieth century in a parallel, but non-commercial, literary market’.50 Network connections take on special and particular importance during the early years of the twentieth century. Fabio A. Durão and Dominic Williams, among others, cite the ascendency of the ‘salon culture’ as modernist practice51 (though this had certainly been true in the eighteenth century and the Romantic period as well), and Cohen discusses the astonishing proliferation of groups such as the Imagists or the Futurists in the decade immediately preceding World War I, arguing that these groups served to bolster the safety and credibility of artists who might otherwise have been afraid to go it alone in opposition to their culture. He argues that in many cases belonging to these groups, led by powerful and famous authors such as Ezra Pound, might have been a requirement for young authors hoping to break into the profession.52 We find no group around Stevenson in the sense of those mentioned above, but we do see Stevenson supported by less successful writers who support and contribute to his work and who model themselves after his style and vision. Thus, the collaborative practice that Stevenson is engaged in during the 1880s and 1890s looks forward to the experiments with authorship that would emerge in the coming decades. Alan Sandison has argued for Stevenson as a proto-modernist, pointing out that many of his works look forward to twentiethcentury modernism, as a corrective to the long-standing critical assumption that Stevenson is a romancer in the tradition of Sir Walter Scott.53 Stevenson does both, but his most collaborative works are also the most experimental and most modern. For instance, The Dynamiter: More New Arabian Nights, which experiments with\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 17\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\n18\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson and the Art of Collaboration\n\nshifting frames and unreliable narrators and which is titled as a sequel to his New Arabian Nights, is one of his most experimental texts.54 Often experimental collaborations meant sacrificing the commercial viability of the work, just as Bradbury has found in reference to similar literary experiments at the beginning of the twentieth century. In breaking away from the image of the single author as sole creator of literary authority, Stevenson proved bold in his willingness to do away with the very celebrity that contributed to some of his greatest commercial success.55 Certainly, his name brand as the author of Treasure Island meant that anything he put his name to was marketable. And yet, in his choice of collaborators he eschews any who might have increased the marketability of his work, but works exclusively with people who could not have conceivably contributed to his success – who, in fact, as letters from his acquaintances and publishers attest, materially hurt it. There was, in short, no economic advantage whatsoever to listing Fanny Stevenson as a co-author on The Dynamiter, and whereas some have argued that Lloyd Osbourne’s American citizenship would help him to hold on to American copyright, in fact Stevenson’s involvement with The Wrong Box only hurt, and never helped, his career. Subsequent novels The Wrecker and The Ebb-Tide would have been much better received if they had been put out as single-author texts, which The Ebb-Tide for the most part was. In forgoing these benefits of economics and reputation, Stevenson demonstrated his commitment to pursuing a more experimental path – one that would challenge the nineteenth-century view of the author with an alternate, dialogic and relationship-based vision. Furthermore, we can see a strong association between Stevenson’s most collaborative and his contemporaneous texts. In his collaborative works with Osbourne, Stevenson leaves behind Scotland’s Jacobite past and instead explores the modern world, describing The Wrecker as ‘a tale of a caste so modern; – full of details of our barbaric manners and unstable morals; . . . full of the unrest and movement of our century’.56 Collaborative composition is vastly less pronounced in his Scottish novels such as Kidnapped (1886), Catriona (1893) or Weir of Hermiston (1896), though I do argue for collaborative inspiration in the narrative experiments of The Master of Ballantrae (1889). A subsidiary thread I will pursue is to track Stevenson’s politics as they grow in both insistence and sophistication over the course of his career. Jekyll and Hyde is, in my reading of it at least, only minimally concerned with the politics of the day. As Stevenson leaves behind his\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 18\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nfirst partnership with Henley to work instead with his wife Fanny, his work becomes more political. In my chapter on The Dynamiter I assess the Stevensons’ ultimately unsuccessful attempts to make sense of the Fenian dynamite campaign. More politically nuanced and interesting, however, is the pair’s reflections on the sexual politics they found in the Pacific Islands, where both became interested in the intersection of sexual and colonial relations, particularly as they impacted underage girls. Both Stevensons were also doggedly concerned with the abuse of blackbirding, or the enslaving of Pacific Islanders, a topic that this book does not treat extensively but which has been treated by Roslyn Jolly among others. Archival manuscripts in Stevenson’s hand held in the Huntington library (which are nearly impossible to read) dealing with slavers such as Bully Hayes provide evidence that Stevenson planned much more work on the topic, which is a central if not the central theme of Fanny’s diary The Cruise of the Janet Nichol. In contrast to Louis’s usually more thoughtful and nuanced ideas, Fanny’s politics could be crude and under-thought, but the fact remains that she was his most politically interested co-author. Stevenson’s growing political interests and sensibilities unfortunately coincided with his shift to working with Lloyd Osbourne as his final and exclusive collaborator. Osbourne had little interest in this mode of thought, and it contributed to a schism between the partners. Stevenson and Osbourne’s The Wrong Box, which was originally Osbourne’s conception, has an arch and impudent tone, a throwback to the dandyism of Stevenson’s earlier Jekyll and Hyde, but without that text’s moral heft. This lightness of sensibility is part of its overall failure, but has also kept it a cult classic among those who admire such things. To compare it, however, to Stevenson’s simultaneous The Master of Ballantrae is to see how Stevenson would rather have treated the same topic: what is in The Wrong Box a cynical rejection and disinterest in ideas of right and wrong becomes in The Master of Ballantrae more of a focused challenge to conventional rules of law and morality. Finally, Stevenson and Osbourne worked together on The Wrecker and The Ebb-Tide. These two texts are Stevenson’s most political fictions, the first critiquing global capitalism especially in its impacts on the Pacific and the second critiquing imperialism and missionary zeal. The violence of the latter work greatly offended Sidney Colvin, who initially blamed what he perceived as the book’s failures on Osbourne. However, as Colvin himself eventually learned, this was not true: the dark vision of The Ebb-Tide was Stevenson’s own, and Osbourne had little to do with it.\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 19\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\n20\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson and the Art of Collaboration\n\nA vexing problem in collaboration criticism is that of biography, which presents a paradoxical challenge. Critics invested in the collaborative are often seeking to demystify the cult of authorship that surrounds a particular author by demonstrating that he is not the divinely inspired auteur responsible for all of his work that readers have thought, but rather has been supported by a network. On the other hand, the work of analysing collaborations has sometimes pulled me deeper into the biographical by highlighting the varied relationships and personalities that make up the author’s life, ironically reinforcing the kind of literary star-gazing that collaboration scholarship is meant to undermine. This problem is particularly thorny in the case of Robert Louis Stevenson because of his adventurous life, his own magnetic personality, still exerting its influence over a century later, and the strong personalities with whom he surrounded himself, all of which offers abundant material for discussion. If I have fallen into a biographical trap, at least I can say I am not alone – for all of these reasons, among Stevenson criticism it is rare to find scholarship that eschews the biographical. The difficulties of dealing with the biographical are also inextricably tied up with the question of the author as celebrity – something Stevenson certainly was in the second half of his career. And yet, in some cases I have found Stevenson himself to be acutely aware of these problems, and even turning to the work of collaboration to try to free himself from the very restrictions that fame and celebrity placed upon him, often without success. Foucault’s ‘author-function’ has been helpful in this regard because it reminds us that, while Stevenson the man and Stevenson the author both existed, they are not co-identical with one another. Foucault has written that ‘The name of an author poses all the problems related to the category of a proper name’, but it poses more problems too: ‘the link between a proper name and the individual being named and the link between an author’s name and that which it names are not isomorphous and do not function in the same way.’57 Foucault’s concern is that the over-identification of the biographical personage with the authorial ego may unduly influence the reception of texts. But it is worth noting that it works the other way, too – the author’s name with all it brings to bear serves to obliterate the historical specificity of the life, its compromises and its connections. The politics and trends of an author’s work may paint with too broad a brush our assessment of his or her messy and contradictory life. Similarly, Marjorie Stone and Judith Thompson propose that the author him- or herself be seen as a ‘heterotext’, in that authors are ‘woven of different strands of\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 20\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\ninfluence and agency, absorbing or incorporating differing subjectivities, and speaking in multiple voices’.58 We can speak of Stevenson as an author without in doing so denying the contributions of friends, families, editors, typesetters, precursors and influences. Finally, yet another school of collaborative criticism, largely found both within feminist theory and within composition studies, suggests that the process of collaboration is a superior method of composition for scholarly and creative work alike, and ‘see[s] the promotion of collaboration in many forms as a primary means to democratise institutional and social structures, including structures of writing’.59 Composition and rhetoric scholars Lisa Ede and Andrea A. Lunsford have been calling on scholars in rhetoric and composition, and in the humanities more generally, to enact contemporary critiques of the author and of the autonomous individual through a greater interest in and adoption of collaborative writing practices and to do so not only in classrooms but in scholarly and professional work as well.60\n\nWhat I have found in Stevenson’s work that this reading of collaboration fails to address, however, is the cost of collaborative experimentation – the conflict, the frustration, lost sales, and some would even say the cost to his literary legacy – costs that caused him to turn away from his experiments in the end.\n\nChapter Overview My analysis of Stevenson’s collaborations begins with a discussion of the plays that he wrote during the 1880s with his then best friend, W. E. Henley. These plays were the foundation of Stevenson’s collaborative work, even though the partnership did not last beyond them. Stevenson and Henley wrote three plays together, Deacon Brodie (first printed 1880 and first performed in 1882), Beau Austin (first printed 1884, first performed 1890) and Admiral Guinea (first printed 1884, and first performed in 1897), which were later collected together under the title Three Plays in 1892. A fourth, Macaire, written during the same period, was published only in 1895, after Stevenson’s death. Countless others were planned. Work on Beau Austin and Admiral Guinea was sometimes conducted by notebook, giving us a fascinating glimpse into the collaborative process that Stevenson used. Although the pair were hopeful about the success of their writings on the stage,\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 21\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\n22\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson and the Art of Collaboration\n\nthey were inevitably disappointed, and all the plays that they wrote together were failures in their own time and even less considered now. Despite the failures of these plays, one at least, Deacon Brodie, has found immortality as an early source for what is perhaps Stevenson’s most famous work, Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Beginning with a reading of Deacon Brodie, I suggest that that play biographically reflects the conflicts that Stevenson and Henley were facing in their friendship and literary partnership. In shifting focus, then, to Jekyll and Hyde we can see that the novella bears the traces not only of the early friendship but also of its own beginnings on the stage. The dramatic origins of the Jekyll and Hyde story extend to its afterlife. The many successful stage and film adaptations of this famous work attest to its theatricality, and the idea of the man who shows two faces to the world is an apt description of the actor. Jekyll and Hyde, which owes its origins to literal dual authorship, is a reflection on the collaborative space of the theatre, but also a reflection on the fragmentation of the single author. Stevenson uses the metaphor of the stage to describe his own dreaming mind in his essay ‘A Chapter on Dreams’, in which he describes, years later, how he came to compose Jekyll and Hyde. Never mentioning his earlier work and conflicts with Henley, he instead develops a theory of the author himself as split into two personalities, and then more. The dizzying and disorienting fragmentations of Stevenson’s own persona in this fascinating essay provide important clues to explain why he persists in working collaboratively throughout his career. So far from himself subscribing to the idea that art is the product of a solitary mind, he already sees the mind of the artist as fractured into a multiplicity of voices. These voices contend for control just as stubbornly as a real collaborator such as Henley. My next chapter moves to consideration of Stevenson’s acknowledged collaborations with his wife Fanny, most substantially, their cowritten work, The Dynamiter, also titled More New Arabian Nights, an experimental farce about the Fenian dynamite campaign that was currently in the news. Husband and wife collaborations, I argue, create subtle problems, largely because we expect a wife to assist her husband without credit. (Where a husband assists his wife, on the other hand, critics may assume the work is rightly his.) This novel, one of Stevenson’s most formally experimental, draws upon the structures of the Arabian Nights, with their ever-receding frames and also their overt metafictionality. Just as Shahrazad makes up the stories to tell her brutal husband, Clara Luxmore, the principal narrator in The Dynamiter, tells inset stories that are lies. Also like The Dynamiter,\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 22\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n23\n\nthe Arabian Nights is also concerned with issues of narrative and marriage. The Dynamiter was well regarded in the nineteenth century, but not so in the twentieth or twenty-first, precisely because recent critics have resented Fanny’s involvement. However, the Stevensons may be playing a trick on us after all, because suspect, disguised and unreliable female author/narrators are pre-emptively treated within the text itself, making the structure of the tales a metafictional reflection on the circumstances of its creation. I also consider Fanny’s and Louis’s co-written play, The Hanging Judge (1887), a thinly disguised biographical play probably meant for home production, as well as Fanny’s controversial story ‘The Nixie’, which has been blamed for the breakup of Stevenson’s friendship with Henley after Stevenson’s cousin Katharine de Mattos claimed it as her own. Fanny, I hypothesise, had in fact intended to collaborate with de Mattos on the project, probably inspired by her husband’s own collaborations with Henley. When Henley took the aggrieved Katharine’s part, it had less to do with his loyalty to Katharine or the rightness of her own claims, and more to do with his continued resentment of the failures of the plays that he himself had written with Stevenson. I continue to focus on the Stevenson marriage in my chapter on the couple’s Pacific writings, prominently Fanny Stevenson’s diary The Cruise of the Janet Nichol among the South Sea Islands, published in 1914, years after Stevenson’s death, as well as Robert Louis Stevenson’s travel writing from the Pacific, posthumously compiled in In the South Seas and his novella The Beach of Falesá, both of which were heavily influenced by observations from Fanny’s diary. In his description of the opera on Butaritari, Stevenson lays out his theory of conflictual collaboration, prompting us to read the stress from conflicts with his sometimes-contentious wife as artistically stimulating rather than repressive. Looking at Fanny’s diary reveals the extent to which much of the Stevensons’ writing was a family venture. I examine the progression of several textual fragments describing Pacific Islands the Stevensons visited on the ship the Janet Nicoll, from their first draft as holograph manuscript fragments, to their inclusion in The Cruise of the Janet Nichol, and sometimes their inclusion in Louis’s published non-fiction and then fiction. Remarkably, I have found that much of this material, which was originally written by Louis but later claimed by Fanny, concerns the same topic – that of the sexual exploitation of young Pacific Island girls by white traders. The shared nature of the family’s diaries allowed Louis to hide in his wife’s diary material on a topic that was evidently of great interest to him, but that would have negatively affected this famous author’s\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 23\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\n24\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson and the Art of Collaboration\n\nreputation as a family-friendly author. I see Stevenson’s concern with this dark side of Pacific colonisation in The Beach of Falesá, in which work I show that the character of Uma is quite a bit younger than more recent readers have realised. That this material proved not suitable for the Stevenson brand is supported by Sidney Colvin’s zealous expurgation of The Beach of Falesá. Though Stevenson did write a great deal of material with both Henley and with Fanny Stevenson, his most enduring partnership was with his stepson, Lloyd Osbourne. In addition to the three novels mentioned above, the pair planned many unfinished works, just as Stevenson had done years earlier with Henley. The work for which we have the most extensive manuscript material is The Wrong Box, which was revised from nineteen-year-old Osbourne’s comic novel A Game of Bluff. For this novel we have access to a manuscript that shows Osbourne’s typed pages overwritten with Stevenson’s emendations and interspersed with Stevenson’s handwritten pages. Even so, The Wrong Box presents two significant problems. First, The Wrong Box is atypical of Stevenson’s collaborations because of just how extensive Osbourne’s contributions were; Osbourne had a complete draft before Stevenson joined the project. In no other case did Stevenson give any collaborator as much leeway on a project as Osbourne had on The Wrong Box, nor would he ever give Osbourne such leeway again. Despite the existence of a complete manuscript that was worked on by both authors, an almost ideal situation for such archival detective work, many questions must remain for the scholar who wishes to parcel out each writer’s contributions. Because Stevenson rewrote many of Osbourne’s typewritten pages in his own hand, there are very few moments at which we can assign credit to Stevenson (although there are more where we can confidently assign it to Osbourne). So although The Wrong Box tells us the most about the process of collaboration, it also serves as an example of the impossibility and inadvisability of unbraiding the collaborative process completely. Although The Wrong Box does not stand among Stevenson’s most enduring works, the process that Stevenson and Osbourne used to write this novel influenced Stevenson’s views about collaboration, leading him to embrace a more experimental style generally. At the end of this chapter I argue that Stevenson’s concurrently written novel, The Master of Ballantrae, which has achieved much greater fame and respect in his canon, is a revisitation of the themes he explored with Osbourne in The Wrong Box, in a tragic rather than a comic mode. Even more than this, I find that the actual process\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 24\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n25\n\nof working with Osbourne became incorporated into that novel, which dramatises the collaborative experimentations and revisions that Stevenson and Osbourne were exploring. My final chapter considers the end of Stevenson’s collaborative project: his final two novels with Osbourne: The Wrecker and The Ebb-Tide. In a letter to his cousin Stevenson emphasises Osbourne’s subordinate role and expresses his growing frustration: ‘The great difficulty of collaboration is that you can’t explain what you mean’ (Letters 8: 364–5). Of all of Stevenson’s projects, it is his wideranging adventure The Wrecker that is most in need of critical reassessment. Although inconsistent, especially because of its huge and sprawling structure, The Wrecker best combines the high adventure on which Stevenson had made his earlier career with the new style and concerns that he was developing late in his life: a biting critique of late-Victorian capitalism and the imperial project. I find The Wrecker to be the apotheosis of Stevenson’s collaborative strivings throughout his career. The Wrecker is a novel about partnerships and the compromises they require – of ethics, art and self-interest, written at a moment when Stevenson himself was the most challenged by his own difficult partnership with Osbourne. In its plot it revises themes that Stevenson had first explored with W. E. Henley in Deacon Brodie, when he first undertook collaborative writing: the challenges and frustrations of partnerships between men, although these topics are treated more hopefully in The Wrecker than they had been in Deacon Brodie. The Wrecker’s two protagonists, the American investor Loudon Dodd and English aristocratic scion Norris Carthew, are inspired but also tested by their best friends and business partners. Outside of the text, Stevenson himself was finding his own partnership with Osbourne challenging; the unequal terms of the arrangement were more difficult than he had imagined. He was also learning that the collaborative process, which had promised to be liberating, was constraining in other ways, dictating a more realistic method and forcing him to create characters based on the family’s acquaintances, a thing he had often done before but only selectively. Finally, the pair undertook The Ebb-Tide, but by then the process had failed. Although Stevenson began that novel with Osbourne, and Osbourne’s name remains on it, Stevenson confessed that the younger man contributed little, and then only on the earlier parts. This dark novel – Stevenson’s last completed one – indicates Stevenson’s emerging style, a style of which we would almost certainly have had more of if not for his untimely death. As Stevenson’s vision became more\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 25\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\n26\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson and the Art of Collaboration\n\ncynical and more political, he found himself more isolated artistically from his close associates. It seems unlikely that, in the emerging aesthetic of his late life, he would have found it possible to work with collaborators in the ways he had before. The Ebb-Tide is the end of his collaborative experimentations.\n\nNotes 1. Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson, vol. 8, p. 159.

Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886) dramatises the acute struggles of the collaborative author. Stevenson may have written the actual novella single-handedly, but the life of the text tells a different story. The genesis of Jekyll and Hyde is collaborative, in Stevenson’s persistent but ill-fated attempts to become a playwright with his friend William E. Henley. This dramatic origin retains its influence throughout the story’s history: Jekyll and Hyde has much to say about the theatre, as this chapter will show. The afterlife of the piece is also collaborative, as Stevenson’s dramatic success would be realised in the longevity Jekyll and Hyde has had on stage and screen. At the same time, no other piece in Stevenson’s oeuvre so chillingly dramatises the dark side of collaboration. For, besides owing its origin to the stage, Jekyll and Hyde also emerges out of the world of nightmare, quite literally. Hyde is the enemy who seems to be our friend, the partner who shares a goal and yet appears to be working at cross-purposes. While in the light of day this might seem to be the troublesome writing partner – William Henley, say, or later Lloyd Osbourne – the dream origins of Stevenson’s novella suggest that the author is himself split – that the dark collaborator may, in fact, be ourselves.\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 29\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\n30\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson and the Art of Collaboration\n\nDeacon Brodie: A Theatrical Failure William E. Henley (1849–1903) was a critic and poet. He is now best known for his poem ‘Invictus’ and his series of poems In Hospital, which describe his experience with the surgery on his foot as part of his life-long struggle with a form of tuberculosis (the other foot had been amputated years before). In some ways the opposite of Stevenson, Henley was, and is still, associated with heroic imperialism and the idealisation of the ‘man of action’.2 Though he was influential as a critic and an editor, as an imaginative writer he never reached the levels of reputation that his friend Louis did. Stevenson would use him as the original for one of his most famous characters, Treasure Island’s (1883) Long John Silver, with his booming voice, larger-than-life personality, and wooden leg necessitating the use of crutches. The two men met at the Edinburgh infirmary in 18753 and were close friends until they quarrelled in 1888. Henley was passionately devoted to Stevenson, even to the extent that he perceived a rival in Stevenson’s wife Fanny, and as a result he turned just as passionately against him when the two friends had a falling out. (I describe this disagreement and its results in my next chapter.)\n\nFigure 1.1 William Henley. Photograph by Frederick Hollyer. © Victoria and Albert Museum, London.\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 30\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\nCriminal Collaborators\n\n31\n\nStevenson published three plays with Henley, and planned many more. Three – Deacon Brodie (first printed 1880 and first performed in 1882), Beau Austin (first printed 1884, first performed 1890) and Admiral Guinea (first printed 1884, and first performed in 1897, after Stevenson’s death) – were published together in 1892 together in the volume Three Plays. Deacon Brodie and Admiral Guinea are set in the eighteenth century, and Beau Austin in 1820, and Hultgren notes that all share ‘nostalgic efforts to capture the aesthetic of an earlier time’.4 This distinguishes them from Stevenson’s later collaborations, all of which are pointedly modern in their focus. A fourth play, Macaire, was privately printed in 1885 and was released a year after Stevenson’s death in 1895. This was an adaptation of an earlier French play, which shared Deacon Brodie’s interest in criminal psychology. Of all of these plays it was the first, Deacon Brodie, that had the most staying power. Though neglected during its run and afterwards, the themes of this play are rewritten into Stevenson’s most famous work. Deacon Brodie tells the story of the historical William Brodie (1741–88), a cabinetmaker who moonlighted as a notorious criminal. Stevenson may have been partly inspired by the fact that his father had furniture Brodie had made5 – a cabinet now viewable in the Writers’ Museum in Edinburgh. Deacon Brodie’s discussion of duality is an extended meditation of the plight and difficulty of the double author. This difficulty could not be overcome, and the play’s failure to achieve popular or critical success can in part be attributed to the collaborative circumstances of its creation. Nevertheless, it is from this important origin that Stevenson’s solo writings go on to explore the decentring of authorship in the better-known ‘The Body-Snatcher’ (1884) up through his most famous work, Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Deacon Brodie dramatises the dual nature of the titular character, but also his failure to form profitable partnerships with those around him. The contentious partnerships in the play prefigure the breakdown of Stevenson’s own partnership with Henley, and the struggle between collaboration and control that would become the subject of Stevenson’s later work. The theatrical origins of the story fundamentally shape its themes and its later incarnation as Jekyll and Hyde. Stevenson was the master of many forms and genres. Besides his well-known novels and novellas, he changed the direction of the early British short story, his poems are still part of the established canon of the nursery, and his essays are, deservedly, undergoing a renaissance in critical attention. However, there was one genre that he never mastered, though not for lack of trying: the drama. Stevenson worked on all of his plays collaboratively, and mostly with Henley. Despite many\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 31\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\n32\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson and the Art of Collaboration\n\nattempts, they never had success. Deacon Brodie, as close as they came to a hit, was still largely considered a flop, and it contributed to the dissolution of their friendship.6 As the pair were working at a distance, with Henley in London and Stevenson preparing for and then returning from his French trip described in Travels with a Donkey, we see in Stevenson’s letters his growing frustration with the process, as well as the difficulties that long-distance collaboration create. On 21 September 1878, he writes, optimistically, ‘William Ernest Henley, what crowds of real, good dramatic stuff this piece contains’ (Letters 2: 277). On his return from his travels, he responds half-teasingly to Henley’s complaints that he has not done enough on the play; clearly, Travels with a Donkey as well as the recently completed first volume of New Arabian Nights (1882) were his priority. As for Deacon Brodie, Stevenson says it is ‘not up to so much as I had hoped’ (Letters 2: 279). In an undated letter following he says that he is working in a rush, signs his letter to Henley ‘Adieu Beaumont or Fletcher / Yours Fletcher or Beaumont / Look up and see which is which – after we’re played and not damned: not before’ (Letters 2: 283), an allusion to the collaborative seventeenth-century dramatists. Fletcher is said to have written a good deal more,7 a sly suggestion that neither collaborator may want to hog the credit until critical approval was assured. In fact, Henley explains that Stevenson’s name came first on Deacon Brodie to ‘help the play’ and that Henley’s would be listed first on the other plays, all of this on Stevenson’s suggestion.8 Stevenson returned to England and Scotland, working constantly at the play with Henley, but then fell sick, complaining to Charles Baxter ‘The Deacon is quietly killing off both Henley and myself . . . but we’ll push through first, and then die at leisure afterwards’ (Letters 2: 292). Henley, meanwhile, was eager to keep up the collaboration, and Damian Atkinson notes, ‘throughout their collaboration, WEH was the prime mover believing their fortunes would be made but RLS was not so naïve’.9 Fanny seemed to agree with Henley. As the collaborators waited anxiously for reviews of a later, 1884 performance, Fanny wrote to Henley, encouraging him to take on more playwriting projects with Stevenson, should the reviews not be positive, and crediting Henley, not Stevenson, with any success the partners would find: I am so afraid if the Deacon fails that you will be disheartened. Do everything to make it a success, but be prepared for failure and be prepared, oh do be prepared to go on trying again and again. I believe that you have the dramatic instinct, much more than Louis has, and\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 32\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\nCriminal Collaborators\n\n33\n\nI am as convinced as a human being can be that you will ultimately succeed. I feel it in the very marrow of my bones. I do not think Louis should ever have taken a kern of the little that the Deacon has brought in.10\n\nThis praise for Henley is the more surprising given that, when the letter was written, Louis was just recovering from a severe attack of haemorrhages. Fearing that Henley’s high energy was a drain on Stevenson, Fanny sometimes discouraged his presence.11 In 1884 the pair were at work on their two subsequent plays, Beau Austin and Admiral Guinea, while Stevenson was dangerously ill. Fearing that any strain would worsen the frightening pulmonary haemorrhages to which he was prone throughout his life, his doctors forbade him to speak. During the same illness he and Fanny collaboratively composed The Dynamiter (1885), suggesting that his collaborations may in fact have provided some of the physical energies he lacked during the most severe portions of his illness. Because of this, when Henley did arrive to collaborate on the two plays, Stevenson’s part of the conversation was conducted entirely in his notebook, giving us a unique insight into the regular conversation of the pair as they worked,12 and showing a pattern that would continue into Stevenson’s collaborations with Lloyd Osbourne later on. Stevenson relied on Henley to provide the initial drafts and structures. He would provide the guidance and make all of the final decisions. Working on Admiral Guinea, he instructs Henley, ‘Notice your Pew here with a mother’s eye; he must say nothing disgusting; you must continue to give the brute a certain charm’; but immediately afterwards, perhaps exhausted, he becomes frustrated by Henley’s overreliance on him: ‘don’t ask me about details, but fire ahead in God’s name.’ On Beau Austin, once again, he urges Henley towards speed, not quality: ‘Get your version of it out, man; don’t delay this’, and again suggests that Henley should be working ahead of him while Stevenson will preserve his strength for the revisions: ‘I haven’t gone beyond what you have; and towards the end I was already dead tired and have not made enough of it. Tomorrow I’ll go on with the act.’ This evidence of the practice the men used lends some support to Lloyd Osbourne’s later use of ‘ploughing’ as a metaphor for his part in their collaborations (he claimed that he would do the hard work of ploughing the ground so that Stevenson could focus on revisions),13 although probably both Osbourne and Henley seriously underestimated how much energy Stevenson was spending on his revisions of their work. Although the notebook\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 33\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\n34\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson and the Art of Collaboration\n\ndoes demonstrate some of the material in both plays is Stevenson’s originally, he clearly intended for Henley to be fast-drafting much of the material, with little regard for its quality. Stevenson would see to the quality afterwards. Or, perhaps not. The quality of the plays was not considered to be high, and for Deacon Brodie especially it proved a big disappointment. Henley wrote to Stevenson in 1882, describing the play’s opening at Pullan’s Theatre in Bradford to a full house of three thousand audience members. He complained that the casting was poor, the props inadequate, the lines badly delivered. In short, everything possible is wrong with the production, except the writing, and yet, ‘It stood the strain superbly.’14 Reviews of the play were not encouraging. In response to the play’s 1884 run at the Prince’s Theatre in London, The Academy writes, ‘There is a great deal of merit in the new drama, but it has likewise defects of so marked a kind that they must be removed if the piece is to have a popular triumph . . . the play has both the qualities and the faults which belong to so much of the stage writing of a literary man’ (‘The Stage’, 17),15 and the Athenaeum calls it a ‘powerful but unequal work, standing in need of much revision and alteration to fit it for a general public’.16 Sidney Colvin wrote frankly to Henley that the main character was ‘morally unintelligible, unconvincing, and non-existent’, and advising him ‘don’t make the mistake of despising your critics’.17 Stevenson himself didn’t much like it. In 1883 he writes that it is ‘dead as mud’ but that ‘sanguine Henley, that dog-like optimist, hopes against despair’ (Letters 4: 139–40). After its failure Stevenson returned to playwriting with Henley in 1884,18 a decision Stevenson’s stepson Lloyd Osbourne describes despairingly in his biography of his stepfather. Osbourne blames the project on Henley’s charismatic energy and depicts the playwriting project as childish: R.L.S. was no longer to plod along as he had been doing; Henley was to abandon his grinding and ill-paid editorship; together they would combine to write plays – marvellous plays that would run for hundreds of nights and bring in thousands of pounds; plays that would revive the perishing drama, now hopelessly given over to imbeciles, who kept yachts and mistresses on money virtually filched from the public; plays that would be billed on all the hoardings with the electrifying words: ‘By Robert Louis Stevenson and William Ernest Henley.’19\n\nYet, Osbourne allows that Stevenson was not perhaps as taken in as he at first suggests. Stevenson ‘entered enthusiastically into this\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 34\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\nCriminal Collaborators\n\n35\n\ncollaboration, though, with his underlying Scotch caution’. Osbourne recalls that as Henley read Beau Austin ‘so movingly, so tenderly . . . [d]eep down within me was a disappointment I tried hard to stifle’.20 In the end, Osbourne writes, ‘R. L. S. lost not only the last flicker of his youth in “Wensleydale”, but I believe also any conviction that he might be a popular dramatist.’21 The passing away of Stevenson’s youth, his transition from imaginative bohemian to sober and studied author, coincides in Osbourne’s mind with the failure of the dramatic projects that Stevenson and Henley worked on together, projects that Osbourne suggests were doomed from the beginning. Osbourne’s reflections here have the benefit of hindsight, however. At the time, Osbourne had been a little more sanguine, writing to his mother in 1885 an enthusiastic description of his youthful outing to see Henry Arthur Jones and Henry Herman’s blockbuster melodrama (and another collaboratively written project), The Silver King. Osbourne writes, ‘If Louis would only write a play with a scene so strong as that which I described he would make a fortune at once’,22 showing that he too was susceptible to dreams of yachts and mistresses. Scholar David Kurnick has argued that theatrical failures had a major role in defining the domestic space of the nineteenth-century novel.23 Looking at failed dramas by Thackeray, George Eliot, Henry James and James Joyce (but not Stevenson), Kurnick argues that these failures were essential to the success of the prose work that followed. In much the same way, we can see Stevenson returning to the scene of Deacon Brodie’s crime, rehashing themes and topics born in the theatre. Despite the play’s failure, Stevenson would eventually revise its ideas to great success with Jekyll and Hyde. These themes can be productively read as meditations on collaborative writing: its benefits, but also its pitfalls. Like Jekyll and Hyde would later, Deacon Brodie revolves around the vicissitudes of male partnership. Its central conflict the tension between the Brodie and his best friend, Walter Leslie. Brodie has gambled away his sister’s dowry, though his sister is engaged to Leslie, and then, Hyde-like, he burgles Leslie’s home while drunk: ‘I was drunk; I was upon my mettle; and I as good as did it. More than that, blackguardly as it was, I enjoyed the doing.’24 When Brodie loses control of his criminal associates later in the play, he finds himself at the mercy of the double life he had initially chosen. Like Jekyll, he has lost all ability to direct himself at all. Finally, both Deacon Brodie and Jekyll and Hyde dwell on the difference between serious crimes and trivial offences. Deacon Brodie contrasts the felonious activities\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 35\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\n36\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson and the Art of Collaboration\n\nof the Deacon with the comparatively minor crimes of black-market brandy and cockfighting. Just as Jekyll creates Hyde in a misguided attempt to rid himself of his dark side, Deacon Brodie instructs the reader that a little crime and immorality is the privilege of the middle-class flâneur: that, without it, a more dangerous dark side threatens to emerge. Stevenson himself famously frequented brothels as a young man, and biographers have even tried to chase down evidence of a first love that he may have found there.25 Certainly, in his adolescence he curated an image of himself as an unrepentant rule breaker, though now his various immoralities seem more humanising than evil or scandalous. Deacon Brodie brings together two themes that will persist in Stevenson’s work throughout the entirety of his career. On the one hand, it shows the fraught nature of male/male friendships and partnerships. The Deacon betrays his best friend, Walter Leslie, in favour of criminal associates. Jekyll and Hyde is also structured as a meditation on male friendships, as it opens with Jekyll’s friend Utterson, who is suspicious, and even jealous of Hyde, thinking Hyde is a new friend, or perhaps even lover. Nearer the end of his career, this same theme will dominate The Wrecker (1892), written with Lloyd Osbourne, where the protagonist Loudon Dodd struggles with his relationship with his best friend and business partner, Jim Pinkerton. Significantly, this conflict occurs most pointedly in literature written collaboratively – Deacon Brodie is about a falling out between two friends, written within a friendship soon to fall apart. At the same time, this same theme is played out within the protagonist himself, a drama most explicitly seen in Jekyll and Hyde, but developed through virtually all of Stevenson’s fiction. That Stevenson and Henley were obsessed with the problem of a protagonist in conflict with himself is evident in yet another of their proposed plays, never written. The pair wanted to revisit Sophocles’ Ajax (Letters 4: 37–9), an updated version, Henley writes, that would have had in the titular role ‘an elderly Anglo-Indian engineer, who – brave, honest, magnificent – plays the unconscious criminal as one of several directors in a fraudulent bank’.26 We see the pair revisiting, obsessively, the same old themes: in Sophocles’ Ajax, the Greek warrior, possessed by rage, tries to kill his compatriots because they have denied him the armour of Achilles. Instead, Athena turns him against livestock, whom he believes are his friends. Here, too, we see friendship, betrayal, a two-sided hero, the struggle for self-control. In the end, the failure of the collaborative endeavour would mean the failure of the friendship. Sidney Colvin explains that ‘the practical\n\n6112_Murfin.indd 36\n\n30/07/19 10:10 AM\n\nCriminal Collaborators\n\n37\n\nexperiment in play-writing on which Stevenson spent so much effort with little or no result in conjunction with this same friend made the wife regard the friendship as one that brought a dangerous amount of exertion with no corresponding advantages.’27 The description of Ajax above comes from Henley’s review of Graham Balfour’s 1901 biography of Stevenson (publishe"
