        "text": "Having moved to the States in the autumn of 1939 and having both made successful starts to careers in Hollywood, all looked well-set for Robert and Anna. Things started to go awry in 1942. At the beginning of the year their second daughter, Caroline, was born. Her godparents were Henry Fonda and Geraldine Fitzgerald. Soon after Anna was working in Canada on Commandos Strike At Dawn. British Columbia stood in for Norway in a decent-enough wartime propaganda movie. It had a strong cast, headed by Paul Muni and featuring Lillian Gish, Cedric Hardwicke, Robert Coote as well as Anna.\n\nLillian Gish and Paul Muni in Commandos Strike At Dawn\n\nThe director was John Farrow, who had a reputation as a womaniser. Anna rejected his advances but found out that his secretary had had a fight with him. Anna wrote: “John Farrow’s secretary was Frances Howard. She had a beautiful face and a voluptuous body… She and I used to go shopping in Vancouver… One day I found her in a flood of tears. She told me that Farrow had fired her.”\n\nJohn Farrow and his wife Maureen O’Sullivan with 6 of their children in 1950. A seventh child followed in 1951. Their daughter, Mia, is on the left of the group.\n\nAccording to Frances they had had an affair and during a fight she had slapped Farrow. He promptly sacked her and was refusing to give her a reference. Anna continues the story: “I may be able to help you,” I said. “When I spoke to my husband a few days ago, he told me that his secretary was moving to New York to be married. He’s looking for someone to replace her. I’ll call and ask if he still needs someone.” When I phoned Bob, I told him, “She’s very pretty, and I think she’s just your cup of tea.” Those words have never faded from my memory. I remember them all too well.”\n\nBy the time Anna was back from filming in Canada, Frances was established as the new secretary and had begun an affair with Robert. The children’s Nanny was quick to let Anna know that Frances had raided her wardrobe, was sleeping in her bed and was entertaining guests. Robert was reluctant to admit to the truth but was not, according to Anna, a good liar.\n\nStevenson was described as a pacifist by two people who knew him very well – Michael Balcon and Anna Lee. It has been suggested that explains, in part at least, his reasons for staying in the States on the outbreak of war. Given the time that he spent living and working in Germany and France early in the 1930s, and his liberal political views, it is not unreasonable to suppose that he found war between friends distasteful. Late in 1941 he signed up with RKO to make a fairly routine wartime romance – Joan of Paris – apparently he was second choice, Lewis Milestone having pulled out. (See http://www.wikiwand.com for more). The film was released in January 1942 and made a good profit for RKO despite the expense of building Parisian street scenes in the studio.\n\nMichèle Morgan and Paul Henreid http://www.wikiwand.com\n\nIt starred Paul Henreid who played Victor Laszlo in Casablanca made soon after – a far superior film, of course, and one which eclipsed most other American-made film about the European war. Joan in Stevenson’s film was a beautiful young French actress, Michèle Morgan, making her Hollywood debut. Among the cast was the American actor Alan Ladd. According to Henreid, “Ladd couldn’t die properly and Stevenson shot and reshot the episode. Ladd’s eyes showed no expression. They were like glass balls no matter how much Stevenson worked on him.”\n\nThe film was a success with audiences and critics. The New York Times declared: “here is a tale of personal valor and selfless sacrifice, which is told so simply and eloquently, and is so beautifully played that it might be a true re-enactment of a gallant episode.” Roy Webb got an Oscar nomination for his music (he was nominated seven times but never won). The story is essentially one of British RAF crew, having been shot down over occupied France, finding their way back home with the help of French resistance. Some find the portrayal of the Gestapo a little soft – not sympathetic but neither sufficiently condemnatory. If that is the case for other viewers then it might reflect Stevenson’s slightly more nuanced view of humanity born from his work experiences.\n\nMeanwhile, Anna had been working on How Green Was My Valley, a film that went on to win five Oscars, including best film (beating Citizen Kane) and best director (John Ford). An adaptation of Richard Llewelyn’s best-selling novel it is an affecting story of love and tragedy for a South Wales mining family. Many of the cast were British or Irish though Walter Pidgeon topped the bill. It was an important role for Anna and one that firmly established here in Hollywood. She also found good friends in Maureen O’Hara and Roddy McDowell.\n\nAnna Lee in How Green Was My Valley\n\nIt was also an important time for Anna in a much more personal way. When filming began in June 1941 she knew that she was pregnant but she did not tell John Ford. About three months into the pregnancy Anna tripped and fell while shooting a scene. She was examined for injuries and it was obvious that she was pregnant. She had been carrying twins but miscarried one. (A similar loss had been suffered by her own mother). Ford was cross but he worked with Anna many more times. She was back on the set within a week of the miscarriage.\n\nHaving completed Tom Brown’s School Days for RKO, Robert’s next project was with Universal – the longest-established of Hollywood’s ‘Big 5’ studios. Universal made three versions of Back Street, an adaptation of a novel by Fannie Hurst. Hurst was, at that time, hugely popular – though she fell out of fashion – and Back Street is regarded as one of her best stories. It is about a woman who has a lifelong relationship with a married man. She sacrifices a lot out of love for a man who will not risk the social stigma of divorce.\n\nFannie Hurst – author of Back Street.\n\nStevenson’s adaptation is generally well-regarded and the central performances of Margaret Sullavan and Charles Boyer carry the romance. The score by Frank Skinner was nominated for an Oscar. Sullavan and Boyer were established box-office stars and the fact that a major studio trusted Stevenson with the project is indicative of the confidence producers had in him.\n\nCharles Boyer and Margaret Sullavan in Back Street.\n\nMeanwhile Anna had got a job in a serendipitous way. Lewis Milestone (who had two Oscars for directing – including All Quiet on the Western Front and had made Of Mice And Men) was looking for a leading lady for a new film. He saw a reel of Young Man’s Fancy with Anna being fired from a cannon and said “That’s who I want.” Milestone worked at RKO and someone knew that Stevenson had made the film; Lewis asked Robert if he could get hold of the young, blonde actress!\n\nMy Life With Caroline was a comedy. Anna was Caroline, a young woman who was all too easily charmed by the attentions of men. Her husband, Anthony (Ronald Colman) tries to keep Caroline loyal. Most critics say that Colman is the reason for watching the film and Anna very much enjoyed working with him. She suggested, looking back on the film, that this sort of farcical comedy was not the best material for Milestone who lacked the necessary lightness of touch.\n\nRonald Colman with Anna Lee in My Life With Caroline\n\nNevertheless she got good reviews. The Los Angeles Examiner wrote: “I don’t know when I have seen an actress who impressed me as much… Not only is she photogenic, but her timing, the way she puts over a scene, and her naivete as Caroline are all extremely effective.” The Hollywood Motion Picture Review: “Top acting honors go to Anna Lee, whose performance shows great promise of eventual stardom.”\n\nAnna Lee as Caroline\n\nHaving made the decision to stay in Hollywood Robert and Anna set about getting to work. Despite all his overtures it wasn’t David Selznick that made them offers. Robert worked with RKO – a major studio – on an adaptation of Tom Brown’s School Days, a Victorian novel by Thomas Hughes about Rugby School. Robert’s agent told Anna that “Joe Pasternak wanted to see me about a picture he was doing. ‘Who is in it?’ I asked, without much enthusiasm. I still wanted to go home. ‘Marlene Dietrich and John Wayne,’ replied Harry.” Anna did not think twice.\n\nWayne had not long completed Stagecoach with John Ford and Dietrich had just made Destry Rides Again. Both were big box office draws and to be in a film with them was a great opportunity with Anna. She was a blonde, of course, as was Marlene. Two blondes in one film was not an option, so Anna had her hair dyed a dark auburn. The film was Seven Sinners. Anna played Dorothy Henderson, her fiancée was Wayne, a young naval officer. He falls in love with a cabaret singer, Bijou (Dietrich), leaving Anna to “spend almost the entire film trying to win him back.” (Dietrich and Wayne began an affair during filming reportedly).\n\nJohn Wayne and Marlene Dietrich in Seven Sinners\n\nAnna and Marlene became good friends, and Dietrich seemed happy to take her younger European exile under her wing. Anna fell out with other Germans living in America at the beginning of the war but Marlene had become a US citizen and contributed to efforts to help Jews and dissidents escape Germany. As for the film – well fans of Dietrich will want to see it. If you are unfamiliar with her work then this is not the best place to start. She gets some good songs – I Can’t Give You Anything But Love and The Man’s In The Navy notably. Anna is very much in a supporting role but it was a good place to begin her new career alongside two established ‘greats’.\n\nTom Brown’s School Days was a safe start for Robert in Hollywood. Apart from directing he contributed to the script. He had been to public school himself and the cast included English stalwarts such as Sir Cedric Hardwicke who played the reforming headteacher Dr Thomas Arnold. Stevenson and Hardwicke had worked together on Tudor Rose and King Solomon’s Mines. The young English-born actor Freddie Bartholomew who was already a star name played, Harry, Tom Brown’s best friend. The young American, Jimmy Lydon, played Tom.\n\nFreddie Bartholomew and Cedric Hardwicke\n\nThe film was well-received at the time – though it lost money, a historical story about toffs and the English class system was not an obvious winner with American audiences in 1940. Stevenson’s work was well thought of and his storytelling was commented on. As a calling card it did him no harm on its release in July 1940, just a few months before Seven Sinners. Robert and Anna had arrived.\n\nHughie Greene (the very same!) and Cedric Hardwicke http://www.free-classic-movies.com\n\nAnna obviously had very strong memories of her Atlantic crossing. She wrote in her memoir: “The Normandie was a magnificent ship. The sweeping stairways. The panelled dining rooms with Lalique light fixtures. The luxurious lounges. The Grand Salon with a 32-glass panel, ‘The Chariot of Aurora’, by famed Art Deco designers Jean Dumas and Jean Dunand. The golden wall coverings.”\n\n“As we sailed into New York harbour, the purser led us to the rail on the port side to see the Statue of Liberty and the jagged skyline of New York City’s skyscrapers. As we docked, several representatives from the New York office of Selznick International met us. Among them was Kay Brown, Selznick’s story editor. Kay took us to lunch at the Colony Club and then escorted us to Grand Central Station where we boarded the Twentieth Century Limited, which would take us to Chicago. There, the cars would be switched to the Super Chief, and we would move on to Los Angeles.”\n\nThe Super Chief – The Train of the Stars http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com\n\n“The Super Chief was almost as luxurious as the Normandie or any five-star hotel… I was almost sorry when we arrived in Los Angeles.” Anna goes on to describe how they stayed at the Garden of Allah hotel on Sunset Boulevard – which at different times was also the temporary home of the likes of Buster Keaton, Clara Bow, Gary Cooper and Charles Laughton. Within hours of arriving, and without sleep, Selznick rang the couple and asked them to come and see the rough cut of a film he had just finished.\n\nThe Garden of Allah Hotel http://www.martinturnbull.com\n\nA chauffeur took them to the Selznick home in Beverly Hills. Two other guests arrived – Clark Gable and Carole Lombard – and they watched an unfinished version of Gone with the Wind. Anna thought it magnificent though Gable seemed unhappy. Evidently he and Selznick had argued constantly throughout the making of the film. Stevenson wrote to Gable and received a short, but grateful reply: “Your kind letter was very generous in its praise of the characterisation of Rhett Butler. As you probably know there are many times that you doubt whether you will be able to come up with what is expected of you. If I have been able to convince you for the sincerity and honesty of Rhett Butler then I feel my efforts have not been wasted.”\n\nClark Gable, Carole Lombard and David Selznick http://www.dearmrgable.com\n\nThe Garden of Allah proved to be noisy and Robert’s agent, Harry Ham, found them a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Their neighbour was Marlene Dietrich! By now Anna thought it was time to return to England but on 3rd September, following the German invasion of Poland, war had been declared. She still wanted to return to England but she was denied a visa because she had a young child and travel was deemed too dangerous. Some British in the States decided to return and enlist. Others chose to remain in the US which was, of course, neutral when war began in Europe. Robert seems to have been happy to stay. For whatever reason he had decided his future was in Hollywood.\n\nYoung Man’s Fancy was released in UK cinemas in the summer of 1939 by which time Robert and Anna had completed one more film together, though its release was delayed until the following year by which time they had moved to the States and Britain was at war.\n\nReturn to Yesterday was an easy going comedy, totally English in the Ealing style. It was adapted from a recent play by Robert Morley called Goodness, How Sad.\n\nRobert Maine (Clive Brook) is a British-born Hollywood star on a visit home. (This follows Brook’s own career trajectory to some degree). Disembarking at Southampton he should go to London but decides to stop-off at a seaside resort where he had worked early in his career. He goes unrecognised, by-and-large, and ends up saving the day for a local am-dram group. He also falls in love with his leading lady, Carol Sands (Anna Lee).\n\nAnna Lee and Clive Brook in Return to Yesterday. http://www.parkcircus.com\n\nAnna wrote of the film in her memoir: “We shot on location in Hope’s Nose, near Torquay, Devon… As a person, Clive (Brook) was slightly pompous, a good actor but personally rather dull… This was the third film in which I was photographed by Ronnie Neame. And it was on this film that I fell in love with him. He photographed me using a light he called an ‘inky dink.’ I never looked better.”\n\nGiven that both Robert’s and Anna’s immediate futures lay in Hollywood there is a degree of irony in this film’s affection for all-things English and diffidence when it comes to what America has to offer. As Brian McFarlane points out the use of the song ‘Will Ye No’ Come Back Again?’ in the soundtrack seems especially pointed. McFarlane suggests, however, that the apparent nostalgia implied in the film’s title is misleading. Whilst Robert Maine goes back to the scene of an early success and finds love there, he clearly recognises that his future is elsewhere. There is no going back. “Released in January 1940 and therefore in the making around the outbreak of war, the film must have had a special poignancy – though not offering easy comfort – in its acceptance that the past is over and can never be recaptured.”\n\nNot long after finishing shooting Anna and Robert went home and he got a message from his agent saying that the Hollywood producer David O Selznick wanted him to go to California and make a film. Anna says the “money offered was enormous compared to what Bob usually made, and the offer was tempting.” According to Anna, Bob turned the offer down – “With England on the brink of war, we felt we didn’t want to desert her.” She acknowledges Robert’s pacifist convictions, which she did not share, but does not suggest that these were behind his decision-making.\n\nAnna’s account does not make total sense – she might be running events together as she edited a story more than 60 years later. She suggests, for example, that prior to setting off for States, Selznick offered the job of directing Ingrid Bergman in Intermezzo – but filming had been completed, with Gregory Ratoff directing, before Robert and Anna set off. Anna does say that she suggested that Robert go alone, because it was such a good opportunity. She could make other films for Michael Balcon and Ealing. Robert was persuasive, however, arguing that it was worth having a look at California together. “On a sunny morning in August 1939, Robert and I, together with Nanny and Venetia, boarded the French Line’s premiere ship, the S.S. Normandie, en route to New York.”\n\nAnna told her mother that she would be back in a matter of weeks but as it turned out it would be some years before she saw England again. The five day crossing was luxurious – “a voyage to be remembered.” It was the beginning of a campaign by Selznick to seduce Robert and Anna.\n\nGrand dining room – S.S. Normandie\n\n1939 was to prove to be a pivotal year for Robert, Anna and Venetia and by the end of it the family had left the country. Michael Balcon offers an overview: “we turned out nine films at Ealing in 1939… Bob Stevenson made two, ‘Young Man’s Fancy’ and ‘Return to Yesterday’. Unfortunately, Bob was, I think unsettled in his mind by world events and what the future held, and the pictures did not really come off. A man of high intellectual capacity – his academic record at Cambridge was outstanding and alternative careers were certainly open to him – Bob had set his heart on films and up to this point his record had been very good indeed. By absolute conviction of conscience he was against war and was a deeply troubled man at this time.” We will return to his ‘pacifism’ later.\n\nYoung Man’s Fancy was a project that Stevenson had devised for Anna’s return to cinema after the birth of their daughter Venetia. Set in Paris in 1870/71 Anna plays Ada, an Irish human cannonball who wins the heart of a British aristocrat, Lord Alban (Griffith Jones). Balcon may have had his reservations about the film but Andy Goulding, reviewing the DVD release in 2013 is enthusiastic. “The wonderful sets and costumes are beautifully shot to emphasise the sense of the fantastical in this delightful fairy tale of a film.”\n\nGriffith Jones and Anna Lee – http://www.comedy.co.uk\n\nApparently Anna did her own human cannonball stunts and it was a film that she was to recall with affection. The film was announced in the London Evening News within a month of Venetia’s birth. “(Bob) had seen a story in a newspaper about a 19th century music hall artist named ‘Zazel, the Human Cannonball,’ who is fired from the mouth of a cannon into a net which is hung above the audience. Bob’s take on the story was that the cannon’s aim went wrong and the girl, instead of landing in the net, landed in the arms of the leading man.”\n\n“My costume was a lovely black-and-silver leotard. The tights I wore were pure silk; nylon had not yet been invented. The first time I was fired from the cannon and landed in the net, my tights tore to shreds. The friction in the barrel of the cannon had been too much for the delicate fabric. I had to re-shoot the scene, this time wearing black cotton tights, which were not nearly as attractive or sexy as the silk ones.”\n\n“Another scene I love takes place in Kensington Gardens. Ada climbs up the Albert Memorial and watches sadly as Alban, thinking she is not meeting him, walks slowly away. It’s one of my favourite films.”\n\nAnna was enthusiastic about the crew and cast she worked with and the film seemingly cemented her friendship with Martita Hunt though when both were working in America years later Anna tried, unsuccessfully, to get help from Martita for a job she wanted. The photographer on the film was Ronald Neame who later worked with David Lean, producing ‘Brief Encounter’, ‘Great Expectations’ and ‘Oliver Twist’. Later in life he directed ‘The Poseidon Adventure.’\n\nRonald Neame who photographed Young Man’s Fancy. http://www.latimes.com\n\nBrian McFarlane in his review of Stevenson’s English career suggests that his work, whilst not polemical, has something to say about the class system. He quotes from Charles Barr: “Robert Stevenson’s Ealing pictures offer a very bitter picture of the ruling classes.” In Stevenson’s story the aristocrat is supposed to marry the heiress to a brewery fortune, bringing together land, title and capital. As McFarlane observes, “Neither aristocrat nor capitalist emerges with credit.”\n\nThe brewer puts capital accumulation before health and safety and the romance between Ada and Lord Alban is clearly at odds with such ruthlessness. “The film’s romanticism lies in suggesting that strong-minded Ada and rebellious Alban have found a way, though there is realistically, no other suggestion of rapprochement between the classes.” It’s worth noting that once again Stevenson created a role for Anna as an independent woman – deciding for herself how her life should develop.\n\nIf the first half of 1938 was about writing a novel, Robert’s Darkness in the Land, and adjusting to being parents, then as the year progressed it was back to normal for Stevenson. He and Anna were planning her return to film. Meanwhile Michael Balcon – now at Ealing Studios – was producing The Ware Case and he recruited Robert to work on the scenario and to direct. It was based on a stage play that had been the subject of silent movies twice already.\n\nThis was just the second film Balcon made at Ealing – following The Gaunt Stranger. Balcon says that Robert was “anxious” to direct and he, Balcon, was pleased with the outcome, artistically and commercially. Ealing productions subsequently came to be regarded as representative of an especially British, even English, approach to filmmaking. From the beginning the studio’s subject matter drew on local themes. In an interview at the time Balcon said: “I am sure we can get into the American market, but it will be with films of genuine British character. We shall become international by being national.”\n\nClive Brook as the “insufferable” Sir Hubert Ware http://www.rankandfile1.blogspot.com\n\nSir Hubert Ware (Clive Brook) stands accused of the murder of his brother-in-law. A jury finds him not guilty. Subsequently he discovers that his wife (Jane Baxter) is having an affair with his lawyer (Barry K Barnes, fresh from the lead role in The Return of the Scarlet Pimpernel). Sir Hubert himself is a serial adulterer but if he applies double standards that is unsurprising.\n\nThe class nature of the story may have meant that it did not travel too well – the New York Times found Sir Hubert to be “an insufferable snob.” On home territory the film did decent business. One on-line reviewer concluded that Stevenson “handles the murder (which doesn’t occur until the halfway mark) and the trial particularly well, bringing across their dramatic impact most convincingly.”\n\nJane Baxter and Barry K Barnes – http://www.rankandfile1.blogspot.com See this blog for more images and notes on British fashion of the time as recorded in the film.\n\nIn the summer of 1937, before moving from London, Robert finished making Owd Bob. According to Anna it was not a picture that he enjoyed making and she quotes from an interview that he gave to the Daily Express. “It wasn’t my story or one that I wanted to do.” He went on to complain about “the committee system of directing.” Anna says that “He was used to writing the script and directing and having a free hand. He didn’t feel he could give individuality to his work without that.”\n\nOwd Bob was the first novel by English writer Alfred Ollivant. Published in 1898 a silent movie adaptation had been made in 1924 (and a film of the same title was made in 1998 but the story was ‘updated’). The original story is set in Cumbria and is about the rivalry between two sheepdogs and their owners. The competition reaches a climax at a trials event.\n\nFor his film Stevenson had a strong cast. Will Fyffe, the Scottish entertainer topped the bill as the curmudgeon McAdam. (Fyffe had been on the bill of the Royal Command Performance in 1937 and his character was softened somewhat compared with the novel). His daughter, Jeannie, was played by a young Margaret Lockwood and McAdam’s rival, and Jeannie’s suitor, was David Moore (John Loder, working with Stevenson again. Moore in the film had moved from Derbyshire, Stevenson’s home county, but this is probably coincidental). Owd Bob was the last film Lockwood made before being catapulted to stardom with Bank Holiday and The Lady Vanishes. Her contract with Gainsborough at the time was for £4,000 a year – a remarkable sum for a 21-year-old when weekly wages were typically £3.10.\n\nWill Fyffe and Margaret Lockwood http://www.silversirens.co.uk\n\nLoder enjoyed making the film and the location work was shot in Devonshire. Loder wrote: “my sheepdog was a little black and white border collie, champion for two years running at the British Sheepdog Trials. It was quite an experience to watch him working sheep. During a scene his master would stand behind me, out of camera range, and direct him by whistle. There was nothing that little dog could not and did not do. Will Fyffe’s dog was a big black Alsatian who had never worked sheep in his life, so another Alsatian who had was dyed black and doubled for him.”\n\nLoder recalls that the weather was against them in Devonshire. “From the moment the crew arrived it never stopped raining. Will Fyffe and I went fishing every day and were perfectly happy with the situation, but finally Bob Stevenson said, ‘To hell with it, we’ll shoot the picture in the rain.’ The result was that we achieved a very realistic and effective atmosphere which contributed greatly to the film’s success.’\n\nJohn Loder and Margaret Lockwood http://www.silversirens.co.uk\n\nOwd Bob was released in the U.K. early in 1938 and as To the Victor in the US a few months later. In the US it got favourable reviews. The New York Times wrote: “an admirable film gaited to the remarkably adept performance of Will Fyffe as the likeable old curmudgeon, McAdam.” Looking back on the film and Fyffe’s performance 60 years later Brian McFarlane wrote:\n\n“In the film’s most moving scene, he (Fyffe/McAdam) has taken Black Wul (his sheepdog) for ‘a wee walk in the glen’ to shoot him, though telling Wul, ‘You couldna help killing that sheep’. Fyffe was a good enough actor to make this outcome genuinely moving.”\n\n“Tales of canine love are often embarrassingly sentimental but Stevenson avoids this trap. For one thing, the film is most refreshingly set in rural locations, unlike a good deal of British film-making in the 1930s, and there is a real sense of care in re-creating the shepherd’s life and its problems, a feeling for place and people. For another, it takes seriously the working of sheepdogs, and the sequence of the trials, seemingly unfaked, is a highlight of the film… Stevenson builds on a sturdy framework of conflicts between generations, between Scots and English and between newcomer and old hands, and the result is a regional drama of some substance.”\n\nLet’s allow Anna to take up the story of her first child.\n\n“Now we had to choose a name for our little daughter. She had been known as ‘David’ for so long that it was hard to think of her as anything else. I wanted to name her after my mother, but somehow the name ‘Edith’ or ‘Maude’ did not sound right. Then I remembered a portrait I had seen at Sherborne Castle. It was of a beautiful young girl, the daughter of Sir Edward Stanley. Her name was Venetia, and she married Sir Kenelm Digby, who loved her so much that when she died, he was inconsolable and dressed in black for the rest of his life. The name and the story appealed to my romantic spirit.”\n\nSir Kenelm Digby and Lady Venetia Digby, painted by Van Dyck\n\n“Venetia’s middle name, Invicta, meaning ‘Invincible’, came from a childhood memory. I used to watch the Street being repaired, and I loved the smell of the thick, black tar as it was poured over the gravel and then flattened by a giant steamroller… On the front of this piece of machinery was a brass plaque of a horse, rearing up, with the word ‘Invicta’ beneath it.” Anna was born and grew up in Kent and this shield was the emblem of the County Council. “Much later the Kent County Council knew that I longed for one of the plaques and presented one to me. It hung in every house I had until it was destroyed in a fire.”\n\n‘Invicta’ – the White Horse of Kent\n\n“Our old friend, Hewlett Johnson, the Dean of Canterbury Cathedral, baptised her at the cathedral. Her godparents were Jack Hulbert, Aileen Balcon, and Honor Earl, the portraitist.”\n\n“My friend, the dress designer, Molyneux, helped me design the christening robe. It was made from the Brussels lace-trimmed heavy white satin fabric of my godmother’s court train. She had worn it when she was presented to King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. It was worn at the baptisms of all five of my children.”\n\nIt was not long before the family had to move again when the owners of Priors Farm returned from Australia. The Stevensons then moved to Fingest Manor, in Ibstone, near High Wycombe.\n\nVenetia had a brief career as an actress in the United States – her family had crossed the Atlantic before her second birthday. She was regarded as one of the most beautiful and glamorous actresses of her generation. Apparently it was a career that she did not much relish. Perhaps her best outing is in a horror movie with Christopher Lee – ‘The City of the Dead’ (1960). The film was made in Britain with a largely British cast.\n\nVenetia Stevenson in ‘The City of the Dead‘ (‘Horror Hotel’ in the US).\n\nVenetia married twice – her second husband was Don Everly, one half of the Everly Brothers. They married in 1962 and she gave up her acting work. Together they had three children but divorced in 1970. Venetia is now 82.\n\nVenetia in a more glamorous pose – http://www.billyhopkinson.tumblr.com"
