She is the great-great-granddaughter of Henry Stevenson. She can be reached at [email protected]. The Sullivan County Settlers Web Page is grateful to Gloria for her contribution of information and pictures. We have also added some additional information about Sones ancestry from The Tocket Family Tree.\n\nHistorian's Preface: The Civil War was the great cauldron of adolescence for the American republic. Issues that were never resolved at the time of the Revolutionary War kept coming back to haunt our young nation. Slavery, states rights, the cotton economy versus industrialization, westward migration and the creation of new states in the West -- all these and other forces combined to bring Americans to the brink of war against themselves!! Into this mix, in the middle decades of the nineteenth century came waves of emigrants -- primarily, Irish and Germans. Soon many of these dispossessed and impoverished arrivals would be thrust into a new conflict over issues that few, if any of them, played a role in creating.\n\nNevertheless, the ranks of the Union swelled with the immigrants and their sons, their contribution becoming essential and necessary to the final victory. The victims of religious persecution and economic discrimination in Ireland and the refugees from political oppression in the German states recognized as much as any American the precious value of the life and country they had escaped to! Whether we speak of the Irish Brigade before the Sunken Road at Antietam on the \"bloodiest day in American history\" -- September 17, 1862 -- or the combined Irish and German masses facing Pickett's charge at Gettysburg on July 3, 1863, the blood of the \"new\" Americans flowed heavily. /p>\n\nWith such sacrifice, these valiant soldiers helped insure that \"government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth\" (Abraham Lincoln, Gettysburg Address).\n\nThe story of the Sones, Simmons and Stevenson families, bound together by marriage, the land they farmed, and the God they worshiped, is thankfully more than a story of young men at war. Some survived, some did not, some avoided the battlefield, usually due to age, infirmity or family responsibilities. In any case, the families went on to help build the towns and industries of Sullivan County -- railroads, the lumber industry, agriculture and the trades. Here is part of their story.\n\nBob Sweeney\n\nJanuary 2000\n\nSonestown to the Civil War and Iowa\n\nJOHANN MATHES SOHNS was born sometime between 1668 and 1697 in GERMANY, and died between 1722 and1782. He married ANNA ELIZABETH _________ at some point between 1694 and1737. She was born between 1677 and 1700, also in GERMANY, and died roughly between 1722 and 1788. The child of JOHANN SOHNS and ANNA was:\n\nPHILIP NICHOLAS SOHNS, b. 1719, Oldenburg, Birkenfeld, Germany; d. January, 1809, Richmond Twp., Berks Co., Pennsylvania. He married ANNA BARBARA KERN some time between 1738 and 1768; Anna was the daughter of JOHAN KERN and ANNA ________. She was born November 09, 1722 in Eggenstein, Baden, Germany, and died January 01, 1809 in Richmond Twp., Berks Co., Pennsylvania. Immigration papers list him as \"John Philip Sohns\" (Germany). Came over on the ship Snow Charlotte on 5 September 1743, via the Port of Philadelphia, sailing under Capt. Thomas Arnot from Rotterdam.\n\nThe Will of Philip Sohns reads as follows:\n\nIn the name of God Amen I Philip Sohns Richland Twp Berks Co State of Pennsylvania being very sick and weak in body but of sound memory and understanding blessed our God for the same but considering the infirmities of this transitory life to make and publish this my last will and testament in a manner and from feeling to wit. First of all I commend my mortal soul into the hands of God who gives it and my body to the earth to be buried in a decent and Christian manner and as the such worldly estate wherewith it hath pleased God to bless me in this life and I give and dispose of the sum in the following manner that is to say I Philip Sohns divise unto my wife Anna Barbara during her natural life and after her death I give and I divise of the sum of my estate to all my children to be divided share and share alike and I nominate Jacob Ely and approve my friend Samuel Eli to be Executor of this my last will and testament and I hereby revoke any and all other wills, codicils and to make and declare this to be my last will and testament in the presents (SP) and his request have subscribed and witness the 17th day of January in the year of our Lord and One Thousand Seven Hundred and Ninety-seven.\n\nJacob Ely\n\nSam Ely\n\nAbove will appears here courtesy of Lee Sones (Sohns) McBride.\n\nThe children of PHILIP SOHNS and ANNA BARBARA KERN were:\n\nJOHANN PETER SONES, b. November 23, 1755, Richmond Twp., Berks Co., Pennsylvania; d. November 03, 1850, Moreland Twp., Lycoming Co., PA.\n\nANNA CATHERINE SONES, b. 23 March, 1744.

June 4, 1840, married GEORGE BECK about 1785.\n\nJOHANN PETER SONES married ELIZABETH ANNA MERKEL, sometimes spelled \"Markle\", in 1780 in Richmond Twp., Berks Co.; she was the daughter of GEORGE MERKEL, born January 27, 1726 or 1727 and CHRISTINA HILL, daughter of a wealthy miller named JACOB HILL. The MERKEL line goes back at least to the fifteenth century to HEINRICH MERKELEN and his family of merchants and wagon-makers near Lubeck in what is now Germany. The HILL family built a mansion on Moselem Creek in Berks County, PA in 1767 that was still standing in 1999. Their mill was still standing in 1965. ELIZABETH was born August 11, 1757 in Moselem Springs, Berks Co., PA. She died March, 1830 in Lycoming Co., PA. The children of JOHANN SONES and ELIZABETH MERKEL were:\n\nMARIA SONES, b. January 8, 1781, Berks County, PA, d. Sept. 1, 1850, Washtenaw County, MI, m. JOSEPH LITCHARD about 1802 in Lycoming COUNTY, PA\n\nGEORGE WASHINGTON SONES, b.

September 12, 1795, Lycoming Co., PA, d. April 8, 1867, Franklin Twp., Lycoming Co., married DANIEL RITTER about 1815 in Lycoming Co., PA\n\nCATHERINE SONES, b. July 13, 1800, Lycoming Co., PA, d. September 3, 1866, Lycoming Co., married JACOB HILL about 1820 in Lycoming Co., PA\n\nSUSANNA SONES, b. March 13, 1802, Lycoming Co., PA, d. Sept. 9, 1857, Lycoming Co., PA, married JACOB HOUSEKNECHT about 1820 in Lycoming Co., PA.\n\nHere is an interesting anecdote about another member of the MERKEL family. GEORGE MERKEL had a brother named CHRISTIAN MERKEL, born August 28, 1728, husband of JULIANA GERST. He served as a ranger for colonial forces in the French and Indian War between 1756 and 1763 and later was a Captain in the American forces in the Revolutionary War. During the Revolutionary War, the Indians in the frontier areas sided with the British. According to the Lycoming County Genealogical Society, in 1778, several families living on the north side of Muncy Creek, in what was then Lycoming county, took refuge in Fort Muncy. The fort was garrisoned by soldiers under Captain Christian Merkle. On August 23, 1778, Captain Merkle and a friend left the fort to check on the friend's corn crop. While walking, they were ambushed by Indians. The friend was killed and Captain Merkle received a nick on one ear. Captain Merkle escaped to the fort and returned with his soldiers. The Indians had taken his friend's scalp and left his mutilated body. The friend was buried in an unmarked grave on his land somewhere near Shoemaker's Mills. Not long afterwards, the settlers vacated the area during what came to be called the Great Runaway. Later Captain Merkel led other expeditions and reprisal raids against the Indians in Lycoming and what is now Sullivan County.\n\nGEORGE W. SONES married (1) MARY JANE PAINTER and (2) ANN LOW(E). He married ANN, a woman of German ancestry like himself, about 1800 in what would later be Sullivan Co. She was the daughter of JOHN LOW and ELIZABETH DOTTERRER and was born in 1783 in Muncy Valley, now Sullivan County, PA. She died in 1846 in the same county. GEORGE was the founder of Sonestown in 1804. In 1843, George built a sawmill in Sonestown, in what is now Davidson Township. This activity occurred before Sullivan County was formed from part of Lycoming County on March 14, 1847. The local covered bridge was built in 1850, and, in the late 19th century Sonestown boomed as the lumber industry grew in Sullivan County. The village was then home to a plant that manufactured the staves for making barrels. It also had a clothespin factory from 1903 to 1929, but lost almost all industry by the 1930s. As of 1996, Sonestown had a population of about 200, most of whom commuted to work in Muncy, Montoursville, and Williamsport. In 1996 the village had a few stores, an inn with a restaurant, and attracted tourists and hunters. This was the hearth from which our story arises.\n\nThe children of George and Ann were:\n\nJOHN SONES, b. Aug. 16, 1802, Lycoming Co., PA, d. May 25, 1865, Sullivan Co., PA\n\nELIZABETH ANN SONES, b. 1804, Lycoming Co., PA, d. sometime after 1819\n\nHANNAH S. SONES, b. 1805, Davidson Twp., later to be Sullivan Co., PA, d. 1885, same location\n\nJANE SONES, b. January 9, 1809, Lycoming Co., PA, d. March 18, 1889, Sullivan Co., PA\n\nSARAH SONES, b.

Feb. 3, 1871, Otter Creek, Lucas Co., IA\n\nPETER FREDERICK SONES, b. about 1800, Lycoming Co., PA, d. October 1834 in Lycoming County (later Sullivan County); m. SAVILLA LOW. They had two sons: George Washington Sones and Philip Wesley Sones. (See further discussion below)\n\nCourtesy of Carmen Finley, you can read about the Descendants of Peter Frederick Sones (c. 1800-1834),\n\nNote that this history does not list the last of the children of Peter and Savilla: Philip Wesley Sones. We know of him because his biograpical sketch is given in Battle's 1887 History of Columbia and Montour Counties:\n\nPHILIP WESLEY SONES, P. O. Sereno, sawyer and foreman of the Benfield Mills, was born May 20, 1832, in Moreland Township, Lycoming County, son of Peter and Savilla (LOWE) SONES. The paternal grandfather of P. W. was named Peter, as was also his great-grandfather *, the latter of whom served through the Revolutionary war, and lived to the advanced age of ninety-eight years. Philip W. was reared in Moreland Township until ten years of age, when he removed a few years, and about the year 1853 he located in this township, purchasing the farm he now owns, and has since engaged in lumbering; for several years he has been foreman and sawyer in the Benfield mills. In May, 1853, he married Mary Ann, daughter of Lewis and Catharine (HUNTER) CHAMBERLAIN. They have five children: Calvin L., Sarah C., Susan E., Lewis E. and Mary E. Mr. SONES is a member of the Evangelical Association, also of the Iola Lodge, I. O. O. F.; has been school director for twenty years, and is overseer of the poor. In politics he is a Democrat.\n\n* Editor's Note: Philip's father was Peter Frederick Sones (c. 1800-1834), but his grandfather was George Washington Sones (1782-1867). It was his great-grandfather, Johan Peter Sones, who was the second ancestral \"Peter\" and the aged veteran of the Revolutionary War.\n\nPETER F. SONES, the brother of GEORGE W., married MARY \"POLLY\" GIBSON about 1808 in Lycoming Co., PA. She was born July 15, 1787 in Berks Co., PA, and died June 28, 1874 in Lenawee Co., MI. Their child was:\n\nHENRY SONES, b. 1809, Lycoming Co., PA, d. Nov. 21, 1882, married MARY HENDERSHOT.\n\nDANIEL SONES, another brother of GEORGE W., married MARY SARAH WARNER in 1810 in Lycoming Co., PA. After his death in 1824, most of the remaining family including his widow moved to Harris Township, Centre County, PA Their children were:\n\nNANCY SONES, married HARMAN MILHEIM.\n\nJOHN SONES, married MARY STRAW; were living in Centre county about 1844\n\nPETER SONES, married SARAH LOWE, niece of ANN LOW(E), who was also Peter's uncle George's wife; they remained in the Lycoming/Sullivan County area. Editor's comment: Interestingly, another niece of Ann Low(e) named SAVILLA LOWE married Peter F. Sones, son of George and Ann Low.\n\nELIZABETH SONES, married DAVID BARR; lived in Centre County, PA and later in Decatur Township, Clearfield County, PA\n\nSARAH SONES, married JOSEPH WOLF and lived in Centre County\n\nDANIEL SONES, lived in Centre County\n\nGEORGE SONES, died young\n\nThere was a dispute after the death of Daniel Sones that led in 1834 to a legal effort by Peter Sones to evict his mother, Mary Warner, from Daniel's land. The source of the dispute is unclear. Hosever, in the 1820 census, there was another couple besides Daniel Sones and his wife, Mary Warner, living on that land. This couple was not the parents of Daniel, namely Peter and Elizabeth (Merkel) Sones. Speculation is that the other couple was Mr. and Mrs. Adam Warner, the parents of Mary Warner, and that the land was given to Daniel and Mary in the first place by them. After Daniel's death in 1824, there had been a guardianship request for the younger Sones orphans and then the land itself was auctioned in 1828. Peterf F. Sones apparently acquired the rights to the land. About 1844, most of the family relocated to Center County, where Mary (Warner) Sones continued to live until some time between 1860 and 1870 with one or another of her children or grandchildren.\n\nNote: The preceding information on the family and descendants of Daniel Sones comes from Denise Garcia.\n\nJOHN SONES, the son of GEORGE W. SONES and ANN LOW, married JULIA BRIDGE BRIGGS in 1833 in Lycoming Co., PA. She was June 29, 1806, and died Feb. 17, 1863 in Sullivan Co., PA. Their children were:\n\nMARY E. SONES, b. 1835 in Lycoming Co., PA, married GEORGE W. PHILLIPS, born 1843 in Muncy Valley, PA; after the Civil War, GEORGE is listed as having received an $8 pension for his military service.\n\nPETER SONES, b. Jan. 25, 1836, Lycoming Co., PA, d.

Hannah and her husband, Henry, had 11 children, five of whom fought in the civil war!! Two of her sons, Philip and Jacob, died there. Hannah is listed as living in Davidson Twp. with her husband in the 1850 census. Her husband Henry died in 1854 when her second youngest, SULLIVAN CROUSE STEVENSON (great-grandfather of Gloria Marashai, our correspondent) was only three years old and her youngest, FRANKLIN STEVENSON, was an infant. She moved to Laporte Twp. with her son George and his wife Rachael by the 1860 census. The last name is spelled \"Stephenson\" in this census.

Stevenson, from the Quimby, Iowa Centennial Book:\n\n\"George N. Stevenson, one of the earliest settlers of Silver Township, was born Dec. 4, 1833 in Lycoming Co., PA. He was the third child in a family of 8 boys and 3 girls born to Henry and Hannah (Sones) Stevenson. George and 4 of his brothers served in the Union Army in the Civil War, with only 3 of them returning home. One of his brothers (Jacob) was severely wounded at Gettysburg and, after recuperating, re-enlisted and later died from smallpox while in the service. Another brother (Phillip) died while a prisoner of war in the south. Rachel Earle Edgar (his wife) was born in Sullivan Co., PA, October 4, 1840, to Andrew and Dinah (Glidewell) Edgar. George and Rachel were married on Dec. 26, 1858, in Sullivan Co., PA. Five children were born to them: Phillip Houten, born 31 Dec 1859; Thomas Ellsworth, born 1 June 1862; Oliver Gordon, born 22 March 1864; Melissa R., born 11 January 1866; and Lucretia Ann, born 17 September 1868.\n\nAfter the war, George and Rachel farmed land in Sullivan Co. before moving to Silver Township. In April 1869, the family traveled by railroad to Denison, IA, the nearest outpost to Silver Township. Henry Hunsinger and D.S. Simmons, relatives who had settled in Silver Township previously, met them with a covered wagon drawn by an ox team, and they made their way back to Silver township over the trackless prairies. The Stevensons made their home with the Simmons family in a 16x18 foot log cabin for 3 weeks while their own 15x17 foot log cabin was being constructed on a homestead 2 miles east of what is now known as Quimby. The log cabin consisted of 2 floors, one door, and four windows, and was ready for occupancy May 1, 1869. The homestead contract was satisfied in 1875 and the George Stevenson family (prospered) living on and breaking the land, by building a stable and granary, digging 2 wells, and planting three and one-fourth acres of forest trees, 45 fruit trees and 1/4 mile of hedge.\n\nFour children were born on this homestead: Oscar R., born 24 March 1870; Ulysses, born 28 October 1872; Leah Belle, born 2 May 1876; and Charles Emmett, born 31 January 1878. George died January 19, 1884, at the age of 51 years and his son Oscar continued to help his mother operate the farm until 1892, when she bought a small home in Holstein from her brother, Dr. J.C. Edgar. She lived in Holstein until 1921, at which time she moved to Cherokee to live with her son Gordon and his wife Grace. She passed away May 10, 1924. Both George and Rachel were devout members of the Methodist Church. George was a class leader, steward, and trustee at Mt. Zion Church, east of Quimby, at the time of his death. Rachel was a Sunday school teacher at Mt. Zion Church, and after she moved to Holstein she held prayer meetings in her home. Three of George's brothers followed him to Silver Township from Sullivan Co., PA. They were (Sullivan Crouse) \"Krouse\" and Mary (Hughes), Hiram and Mary (Richart), and Franklin and Susanna (Stepp). All of the children of George and Rachel lived in the Quimby and Cherokee area all of their lives.\"\n\nHere is the beautiful hand-carved desk of Phillip Stevenson:\n\nJANE SONES was born January 09, 1809 in Lycoming Co., PA, and died March 18, 1889 in Sullivan Co., PA. She married JACOB SIMMONS some time before 1830. He was born February 1805 in New York, and died August 09, 1884 in Sullivan Co., PA. The Jacob and Jane Simmons family of Sonestown sent five sons to the Civil War - two were to die from their wounds:\n\nSimpson S. (1st Sgt, Co. \"B\", 84th PA Vols)\n\nIsaac H. (Co. \"H\", 5th PA Reserves)\n\nThomas S. (Co. \"B\", 84th PA Vols)\n\nDavis S. (Co. \"K\", 141 PA)\n\nGeorge W. (Co. \"B\", 84th PA)\n\nIn a recent communication from the great-great-great grand-daughter of this couple, Shirley Simmons Jacobs of San Diego, CA, we learned that Jane (Sones) Simmons was a midwife. Shirley also forwarded pictures of the gravestones of her two ancestors, Jacob and Jane, taken in the Old Sonestown Cemetery, Sonestown, PA, by her cousin Mike Simmons. More recently, in March 2005, Shirley arranged for several pictures to be taken of the gravesite of Simpson Simmons, son of Jacob and Jane, who was killed in the Civil War. These photos are all shown below.\n\nAccording to Shirley:\n\nOur family still lives in the Warren PA area and has been trying for years to trace the family lines of Jacob Simmons. I am descended through George Simmons and Sally Hazen Simmons (my great-great-grandparents), then John Smith Simmons (my great- grandfather), Harry Simmons (my grandfather), and Kenneth Simmons (my father). We would love to learn more about our family and to share it with the Sullivan County website.\n\nMy late uncle, Kenny Simmons, from Erie PA, is the one who started the family line research with assistance from Judy Simmons from PA. The line he gave us started with Jane Sones and Jacob Simmons. Jane was a daughter of George Sones, founder of Sonestown and Anne Low. The Sones line is well researched clear back to Germany but the Simmons line has hit a brick wall at Jacob Simmons.\n\nI have been contacted by several cousins from the Sones and Simmons line and we are all looking for Jacob's family. The census and other documents say he was born in New York. My grandfather, Harry Simmons, who lived well into his 90s, said our Simmons line came from North Carolina. I have the war records of Jane and Jacob's sons and some of the letters mention Sones relatives but no Simmons. In the pension file where Jane claimed a pension from deceased son Simpson Simmons, John Hazen (Hazzen) gave a deposition in which he claimed to have known Jacob from boyhood. John supposedly was from Northumberland County in PA. It's a puzzle!\n\nAnd if there is one thing I've learned, it's that information you do get is many times unreliable. In my gg grandfather's military file, his mother Jane is listed as Jane Bennett instead of Jane Sones.\n\nI have a wonderful book called The Pennsylvania Line. It shows how the counties in PA changed over the years. This may also complicate looking for relatives. They may have been born in Lycoming County, but it may now be a completely different county. It also has a list of townships and when they were formed. Really a great resource.\n\nMy line from Janes Sones (daughter of George Sones and Anne Low) is:\n\nShirley Simmons Jacobs (b.

My grandfather told me it was after LaRue Munson, the richest man in Williamsport! Thanks again for your website. It is the best with so much information and always growing. I know the effort it takes to update constantly and I appreciate all your hard work.\n\nShirley Simmons Jacobs\n\nNovember 2001\n\nEntry in the August 24, 1884 edition of the Sullivan Review, Dushore, PA: Jacob SIMMONS, an old and respected resident of Davidson, died a short time ago. He was stricken with paralysis a few years ago, since which time he has been in ill health. **\n\n** Editor's Note: Jacob and Jane came upon hard times when five of their sons were called to duty in the Civil War. As a result, there were no \"hands\" to help on the farm and the property had to be sold. You can read more about the heroic Simmons boys at Simpson Simmons: Letters from a Soldier, by Shirley Simmons Jacobs.\n\nThe children of JANE SONES and JACOB SIMMONS were:\n\ni. JOHN SIMMONS, b. 1830, Lycoming Co., PA; d. May 20, 1883, Washington State; m. ELIZABETH HAZEN, b. 1834, PA. ii. ISAAC H. SIMMONS, b. 1834, Lycoming Co., PA; d. Dec. 22/23, 1862, Libby Prison, VA. Simmons was in Company \"H\", 5th PA reserves and was wounded at the Battle of Fredericksburg, Dec 13, 1862. One reports says he was promoted to Sergeant by Col S G Simmons (no relation). After the battle, he was likely sent by car to Libby Prison in Richmond, VA, where he died December 22/23, 1862, of a gunshot wound sustained in the battle. Gravesite unknown.\n\nLibby Prison was located in Richmond, Virginia, in a building, which was incorrectly called a tobacco warehouse. It was originally the establishment of William Libby & Son, Ship Chandlers, 20th & Clay Streets. It was a four-story building containing eight rooms. The men slept on the floor. There was a water closet on each floor that became a privy, which rendered foul air and polluted the entire building. The prison was opened in April 1861 and was closed in April 1865. The total number of prisoners held during its existence was approximately 25,000. This was primarily an officers prison. The prisoners cooked their own rations with inadequate fuel, the rations furnished were inadequate, and there was a shortage of clothing and blankets. Rations consisted of beef, bacon, flour, beans, rice and vinegar. Of those who died at Libby, 6,276 are buried in a cemetery in Henrico County southeast of Richmond, two miles from the city and one and a half miles from the James River. There are 817 known graves and 5,459 unknown. Some of the bodies came from Belle Isle, Hollywood, Oakwood and the poorhouse cemeteries in Richmond.

Davis served in Company \"K\", 141 PA during the Civil War. He survived a head wound at Chancellorsville. In 1869, he helped his cousin George Stevenson, as reported above, to relocate to Silver Township in Iowa with his family. We have pictures and more to say about Davis and Mary below.

After the Civil War, the family moved to Quimby, Cherokee County, Iowa. Shirley got her information from a newly found cousin, Mary Ruth (\"MR\") Olson of Vancouver, British Columbia, and passed it on to our site. The contribution includes photographs of both Davis and Mary, reproduced below, and notes handwritten on the back of each photo. Also included is a brief biograhical sketch of Donzella Rosetta \"Donnie\" (Simmons) Riseling, one of their children, and her life in frontier Iowa. We are immensely grateful to Shirley and MR for these historical treasures. Shirley is a descendants of George W. Simmons, a brother to Davis Simmons. George was her great-great-grandfather. Her complete line goes: My line goes George W. Simmons, John Smith Simmons, Harry Simmons, Kenneth L. Simmons, and Shirley Simmons Jacobs. MR on the other hand comes down directly from Davis, her great-great grandfather, as follows: Davis S. Simmons, Harry Paxton Simmons, Howard Lester Simmons, Blanche Lucille Simmons, and Mary Ruth Olson [daughter of Blanche and Alfred Engemann Olson].\n\nDavis S. Simmons (1843-1906)\n\nSon of Jacob and Jane (Sones) Simmons\n\nHusband of Mary Speary\n\nMary (Speary) Simmons (1845-1893)\n\nDaughter of Samuel and Mary (Pennington) Speary\n\nWife of Davis S. Simmons\n\nHere is a biographical sketch of Donzella Simmons Riseling, annotated by Mary Ruth Olson.\n\nLet us return to the Sones family history back in Sonestown, PA. In the fourth instalment of History of Sonestown Area, printed in the Sullivan Review of January 26, 1956, Myrtle Magargel wrote about the Simmons family:\n\nGeorge Miller arrived in Sonestown in 1851. He bought 1700 acres in and around Sonestown. His sons were Peter and Cyrus. Peter has already been mentioned. Cyrus built his home well back from the present highway and it is likely that the first road through the village lay farther from Muncy Creek than does the present highway since other firstlog houses were likewise on a line with the Miller home. Cyrus had three sons, William, Oscar and John, and daughters \"Clem\", Grace and Ade. All married and all with such children as they have are non-resident.\n\nYoung Jacob Simmons had been here a year when Sones started his saw mill. He married George Sones' daughter Jane and built a log house for his bride near her father's mill. His growing family of boys took him to a farm which he cleared up the Laporte road and was known years later as the Morrison place. He had seven sons, John, Isaac, Simpson, George, Thomas, Davis and jacob. John was sheriff during the war. George came from the army to start a blacksmith shop in Sonestown. Thomas, also a soldier, went to Iowa with his brother who was best known as \"Doc\". Tom's wife who was Martha, a daughter of George W. Bennett of Shrewsbury and his wife Sarah Smith, daughter of William Smith of Elk Lick, did not like the west so that couple returned to Sonestown and took up residence with Tom's parents, now \"Old Jakie\" and Aunt Jane who had moved to a small farm below Glen Sharon, now the propoerty of the Hazen estate.\n\nEditor's Note: You can learn more about the Bennett family at Some Descendants of Joel and Sarah Bird Bennett of Sullivan County, Pennsylvania. William Smith, mentioned here, was married to Martha Laird, a member of another well represented family in the lower part of Sullivan County. You can learn more about the Smith and Laird families, as well as additonal Bennett family information, at The Vroman and Bennett Lineage.\n\nGeorge Simmons, the blacksmith, reared a family of four boys and four girls in Sonestown. Robert and Jacob both died without leaving any children. George, Jr. \"Chip\" was killed in a railroad accident on the W. & N. B. R. R. of which he was an employee, no sons left. John and his family have been out of the county for years as have the three daughters, Elizabeth, May and Ada. The fourth is Rose, widow of James Deininger and living in Sonestown without children. Tom's two daughters and two sons and their families have been non-resident for almost half a century.\n\nExtinct in the county, too, is the Lowe family that came in 1844 and settled above Sonestown on the way to Laporte. Isaac and John were active in the G. A. R. as long as they lived here. That organization has long since passed away with the death of its members. It was known as the Simpson Simmons Post to honor one of the boys who was killed in the war.\n\nThe year 1851 brought a small planned development to Sonestown. Jacob Reed bought a few acres and after building a log tavern laid out lots for sale. His tavern became the property of William Corson few years later when Corson ran a stage from Muncy to Dushore and back. About the same time Edkin Corson opened the first store in the village. Another one operated during the Civil War was onwed by Wittick and Sylvara. Meantime James Taylor became owner of the tavern until he got the western fever and sold it to Thomas Magargel of Laridsville in 1867.\n\nDuring all these years while the village was slowly growing, there had been more residents trickling into Elk Lick. Amos Wilber and his father Joseph arrived in 1844 from York state. Joseph passed on soon afterwards. Amos was versatile enough to be a carpenter, a millwright and to teach school in winter. He became so popular that the county elected him its sheriff in 1854. That took him to Laporte where he was of considerable assistance in building the tannery then locating there. He stayed in Elk Lick about ten years after his term as sheriff ended, then he went back to his native state, leaving no descendants, so far as known in this section, and selling his farm to John F. Smith from Lackawanna county.\n\nSmith's account of his new home was good enough to bring some of his neighbors here, too. Edward Clark bought the John Hiddleson farm and vie years later sold it......\n\nEditor's Note: The following pictures were taken for Shirley Simmons Jacobs of San Diego by Bob Robb of Richmond, VA. He is related to Shirley through Jane Sones' sister Hannah Sones. Hannah married Harry Stevenson;Bob's great-great grandfather John Robert was the son of Harry and Hannah. In other words, the gr-gr-gr grandmothers of Shirley and Bob were sisters, which makes them fifth cousins.\n\nAlexandria National Cemetery\n\nMain Entrance\n\nAlexandria, VA\n\nAlexandria National Cemetery\n\nCloseup of Main Entrance Plaque\n\nAlexandria, VA\n\nRow A Containing Grave Marker for\n\nSimpson S.

He was born February 04, 1813 in Elkland Twp., Lycoming Co., PA, and died February 16, 1892 in Liberty Center, Warren Co., Iowa. Edmund and his wife Sarah lived in Sonestown, Lycoming Co., until migrating to Iowa in 1869. They had 11 children, but two babies died in infancy. The 1850 census lists him and his wife as being 33 years, old which would put their year of birth as 1817, which is different in her case from other sources.

She was born August, 1843 in Davidson Twp., Sullivan Co., PA. Hiram was listed as a Lawyer in the 1860 census. The children of HIRAM STEVENSON and MARY RICHART were:\n\ni. SARAH R. STEVENSON, b. about 1864. ii. FLORA B. STEVENSON, b. about 1869.\n\nSULLIVAN CROUSE STEVENSON married MARY ELIZABETH HUGHES March 17, 1870 in Lycoming Co., PA, daughter of JAMES HUGHES and BIDDY ______. Mary was born October 1849 in Maryland, and died June 30, 1932 in Willow Twp., Cherokee Co., Iowa. Sullivan's father, Henry, was an Irish immigrant who arrived in America before 1829, and his mother was German. Her ancestors arrived in America before 1755. Sullivan, the second youngest of 11 children, later became Mayor of Quimby, Iowa for 3 terms. He was too young to be a Union soldier, but had 5 brothers who were, and 2 brothers (Jacob & Phillip) who never returned. He came to Cherokee County, Iowa from Hughesville, Pennsylvania in 1887, and settled with his family in Quimby. While no information is given as to why the Stevensons moved from Pennsylvania to Iowa at this time, we can speculate that the West offered opportunity and a sense of adventure. The family histories and the pages of the local newspapers for the 1880's in Sullivan County are filled with stories of families and individuals emigrating to the West and Mid-West. For whatever particular reason or motivation, the Stevensons joined this torrent of westward migration. In 1900, the Willow Twp, Cherokee County, Iowa census report finds them as Family #180:\n\nCrouse Stevenson b. Sept 1851, age 48, married 30 years Mary, wife, b. Oct 1849, age 50 George, son, b. Feb 1881, age 19.\n\nThey were all shown as born in Pennsylvania. Sullivan Crouse is listed as having 4 living children.\n\nMary was born in Maryland according, but was living in Lycoming Co., PA by the 1860 census. Mary had four children according to the 1900 census. She moved to Cherokee Co., Iowa with her husband, Crouse Stevenson, in 1887. Her parents were both Irish immigrants. The children of SULLIVAN STEVENSON and MARY HUGHES were:\n\ni. WILLARD BRADY STEVENSON, b. about 1873.\n\nii.THOMAS ALVIN STEVENSON, b. February 25, 1878, Hughesville, PA [Lycoming Co.]; d.

RUSSELL CLARK STEVENSON, b. 1884, Hughesville, PA [Lycoming Co.]108; d. Omaha, Nebraska; m. MARY MAE RISSER; b. June 1877.\n\nMary Hughes came from a large family. She was born in Maryland in 1849 and lived in Armstrong Twp., Lycoming Co., PA according to the 1860 census. Her parents were both Irish immigrants named James and Biddy Hughes, and had 6 children, 5 girls and 1 boy at the time of that census .She is pictured second from the right in the family portrait below taken later in time.\n\nNewspaper article about Sullivan Crouse in The Quimby Journal, June 13, 1929, Quimby, Iowa:\n\nAt 77, Quimby Man Is Serving Third Term In Office Of Mayor-- Krouse Stevenson Works for His Community In Many Ways\n\nby Inez Keck, special correspondent of The Journal, Quimby, IA\n\nKrouse Stevenson at the age of 77 is serving his third term as mayor of the town of Quimby, after having been town marshall six years, city councilman for two terms, road supervisor for two years, and a member of a school board in the county. With one exception, he is the oldest mayor Quimby ever had. He first was appointed mayor to fill a vacancy, and has been elected to the office twice.\n\nThe mayor has been a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, in Quimby for 37 years. Last year, at 76, he had a 30-day rest from official duties and the pleasure of small town life while in a hospital in Cherokee, recovering from an operation.\n\nMr. Stevenson was born in Pennsylvania, where he lived until 1887. He came west to Cherokee county in that year, and located on a farm 2 miles east of Quimby, which was planted the same year the Illinois Central railroad was built south from Cherokee. He lived on his farm for four years, then came to Quimby, where he has lived for 37 years. He has been janitor of the Methodist Episcopal church for five years, and takes a special interest in that position, as he helped move the old Methodist church building from its former site, and join it to the old Presbyterian church, which the Methodists had bought.

JARRED STEVENSON, b. about 1986.\n\nT\n\nCharles Wesley Sones and the Story of Sonesville\n\nHistorical Context: You say you never heard of the lumber town on Kettle Creek in Sullivan County called Sonesville? And you've lived in Sullivan County all your life? Well don't be too surprised! For twenty years the settlement existed, but it never merited inclusion on maps of Pennsylvania. And so before it is completely forgotten, let us locate it. Today the site is marked by a single house now nearing its seventieth birthday. Sonesville was at the end of a two mile dirt road following Kettle Creek from near the bridge crossing of the Muncy Valley-Forksville road southward.\n\n--Thomas Tabor, Ghost Lumber Towns of Central Pennsylvania, page 324, 1970.\n\nThe architect of Sonesville was another Sones descendant: CHARLES WESLEY SONES, born in 1859 near Picture Rocks, Lycoming County, PA. From Rachel Powell ([email protected]), I was able to learn the following information about C.W. Sones:\n\nCharles Wesley Sones was born 10 Jun 1859 in PA, died 16 Dec 1944. He is buried in the Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Hughesville, PA. He never married and was a senator. He was sealed to parents in 1900 (no idea what this means) and was living with his brother George Mifflin Sones. Charles was the son of Thomas L. Sones and Catherine Gray. Thomas L. Sones was the son of John Sones and Mary Ritter. John Sones was the son of Johan Peter Sones, who married Elizabeth Anna Merkel.\n\nThe children of THOMAS L. SONES and CATHERINE GRAY were:\n\nGEORGE MIFFLIN SONES\n\nMARY EMMA SONES\n\nMARTHA ALICE SONES\n\nCHARLES WESLEY SONES\n\nJAMES HARVEY SONES\n\nPETER HOWARD SONES\n\nSome other tidbits I picked up were that Charles was trained as a teacher, but found himself unsuited for that career. So he became a bookkeeper; in fact, his occupation in the 1880 census for Wolf Township in Lycoming County, where he lived, was listed as such. Later, after he became a Senator in the Pennsylvania Senate, he lived in Hughesville, PA. In 1915, he made a special donation to the Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church at 122 South Main Street in Hughesville:\n\n... Senator C.W. Sones gave the church a new pipe organ in memory of his mother; this organ was used until the 1970's. Prior to installing the pipe organ, some major remodeling was done: the exterior of the church was covered with stucco and cement sidewalks were laid...\n\n--from history of the Trinity Lutheran Evangelical Church, Hughesville, PA..\n\nBut back to our story of entrepreneurial zeal and the Sullivan County lumber industry. Apparently, Charles Sones was a bookkeeper for the Edward Lyon Lumber Company near where he grew up, and then actually cut trees in West Virginia as a lumberjack. He returned to Pennsylvania in the late 1890's and eventually contracted with the Union Tanning Company to lay out and build a mill , a mill town and the transportation system to move the felled logs. The Company ahd decided to clear the 16 square miles of logs that they owned in the area and Charles won the bid on the cutting contract. Charles purchased an already standing mill from Jerry Stackhouse in 1902; this operation used teams of horses to pull logs ten miles to a rail spur on the Williamsport and North Branch Railroad. This was just one of perhaps a dozen locally owned and operated rail lines at the turn of the twentieth century, as can be seen on the regional rail map below. The map also shows the relative locations of the old Sonestown community and, to its north, the transient lumber community of Sonesville. Here is a picture of Charles W. Sones as an adult that is owned by the Lycoming County Historical Society and reproduced in the Tabor book referenced above.\n\nSones addressed the problem of better transportation links by builidng a logging railroad to meet an extension of the Eagles Mere Railroad. Initially, he used wooden tracks, but swtiched to steel when he needed to build the line into the timber stands. Sones invested in a new band saw for the mill and in the construction of homes onsite for the workers and their families. There were 13 homes, a boarding house, school, mill and an engine house. Thre was also another boarding house for the Italian track gang! There was no community store, running water or electricity...ever! Each week a butcher and a vegetable man came to town to sell those food items. Nearby farmers offered fruit and vegetables for sale as well. The Sonesville mill actually ran until 1908, after which the Masten community was constructed as the timber cuts moved elsewhere. Until 1922, Sonesville continued to serve the lumber industry in some capacity. After 1908, the mill was torn down and the former town was called \"Camp 4\". About 300 men worked in the woods for the various Sones enterprises. In 1970, one house nearly seventy years old remained in Sonesville.\n\nCharles Sones was also one of the principal investors in the transient lumber town of Masten. In fact, Sones paid for the uniforms and instruments for the town band at Masten! Sones eventually sold out his interests to the Central Pennsylvania Lumber Company and turned to the Senate and eventual retirement in Hughesville. His life is a classic example of the successful self-made transition from laborer to successful entrepreneur in the \"Gilded Age\" of Sullivan County 100 years ago.\n\nCopyright © 2009 Robert E.
