        "text": "Robert Stevenson McEwan , second child of John McEwan and Janet Stevenson was born in Toronto November 17th 1866.\n\nHe became a lithograph artist and early in his career moved to Chicago, Illinois sometime around 1885.\n\nAccording to his naturalisation papers he arrived in the USA July 3rd 1898 and the date of his naturalisation was September 26th 1919.\n\nThere he met and married Annie Baker (1867-1942). They were married May 15th 1889 in Cook County Illinois when Robert was just twenty-one.\n\nRobert immigrated to Chicago in and around 1885 where he worked as a lithographic artist. I am not aware of where he worked but do know that his trade forced him to travel somewhat. He was in St-Louis, Missouri in 1890, when his first child John Baker McEwan was born, then back to Illinois in 189, then was in St-John’s, New Brunswick in 1894, before returning to Chicago permanently. His youngest son Digory William was born in Chicago in 1903.\n\nRobert continued his career in Illinois and he an Annie had four children: John Baker (1890 -1948), Robert Wilson (1891 – 1945), Mildred Adelaide (1894 – 1973) and Digory William ( 1903 – 1966).\n\nRobert died December 23 1931 in Chicago, Illinois. He was just sixty-five years old. Robert is buried in Lyonsville Cemetery in Lyons, Cook Co., Illinois."
