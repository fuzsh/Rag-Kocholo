        "text": "Bruce Stevenson, age 79, of Cypress, Texas, passed away peacefully on June 18, 2024. Born in 1945 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Bruce spent most of his life in Vincennes, Indiana.\n\nBruce graduated with The Fabulous Class of '63 at Lincoln High School and earned degrees from the University of Evansville and Indiana State University.\n\nAfter graduating, Bruce proudly served as a teacher and coach at Bicknell Grade School, Lincoln High School, and Vincennes University.\n\nMusic being one of his passions, Bruce played and toured with many local bands from the '60s, '70s, and '80s, such as The Ascots, Dawnbeats, Kevin and the Hasbeens, and The Corvettes.\n\nAfter retiring from teaching, Bruce worked at Farm Bureau and pursued his love of electronics at Matrix Integration in Jasper, Indiana.\n\nIn 1963, he married Joyce George, and together they had two children: Greg Stevenson and Becky (Troy) Klussmann. Bruce is also survived by his cherished granddaughters, Kathryn and Sarah Klussmann, and his beloved grandpup Tippy.\n\nHe is further survived by his brother Vernon (Erica) Stevenson, sisters Patty (John) Williams and Jean Stevenson, and brother Jim Stevenson. Additionally, Bruce leaves behind sisters-in-law Donna Mason and Fay George, as well as numerous nephews and nieces.\n\nBruce will be greatly missed by his loving family, friends, and many former students he positively impacted through the years. His legacy is a testament to his love of learning and teaching.\n\nA private family service will be held in Brenham, Texas, under the care of Memorial Oaks Chapel. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to Doctors Without Borders."
