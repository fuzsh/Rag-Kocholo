        "text": "Getting to Paris has been special, but different from past Olympics I’ve competed in, since my husband, Pat, has been fighting cancer this entire year. I’ve talked about how Pat’s journey has motivated me — he was diagnosed with a rare, stage 4 lung cancer at age 30 — but what most people don’t know is how it’s impacted our entire team. I’m personally going through this with him, but my team has been going through it, too — both as teammates and as friends.\n\nPat had a collegiate career within our sport so he knows what’s going on. I see the admiration my teammates have for him, and they see the passion and excitement he has for water polo. He gave an inspirational talk to our team, and I think he has a lot to do with the way we’ve been playing, fighting and competing so far in Paris. My teammates have said that if Pat’s fighting cancer, they can swim another lap, or work even a little harder. When they make comments like that, it makes it worth it — being here. Although sport is amazing, when life throws something at you like a cancer diagnosis, it all seems a little bit less important. But we’re all inspired by him, and I’m happy he’s a part of our process. Now that we’ve made it here, it’s time to play for him, and to show the world the work that this team’s put in, and to prove to myself that I can do hard things.\n\nI got the chance to show my husband around the Olympic Village. I wanted to take him because living there is so unique and unless you’re on an Olympic team, you don’t see that. My favorite part is the apartments where you live with other Team USA athletes. It’s consistent with past Olympics, where you get to be with top athletes from your country in the same building, crossing paths and connecting. For me, the respect that other athletes show you is the coolest thing ever. And when you step outside your Team USA building, then you’re surrounded by athletes from every country competing in so many different sports, all in one area. Not everyone speaks the same language, but we all made it here — to the Olympic Games. The first question people ask each other is, “Hey, you want to trade a pin?” And then, “What sport are you?”\n\nJust that simple exchange connects the world in so many ways. My coach talks about how the Olympics are a great display of world peace because everyone’s in the same area getting along and being inspired by each other. But at the same time, we’re competing against each other. It’s cool to see the teams you play against, but I’m happy I don’t have to see them all the time.\n\nThere’s a lot of energy in the village — you can feel the hype from the other athletes even before the opening ceremony. But we have a sports psychologist who does a good job of keeping our minds in the right place. If you let the expectations or that external energy get too big, they can consume you and not let you play your game the way that you know how to play it. We remind ourselves all the time that we’ve been playing water polo since we were kids and it’s no different just because we’re at the Olympics. We know what we need to do and just need to go out there and do it. We want to win a gold medal. But we can’t let that energy get to us and take us off our game.\n\nFor me, to keep my mind in the right place, I tell myself that this is just another game of water polo, and I know how to play. I’ve seen teams totally implode or get consumed by the pressure. Everyone’s out here to win, and you can’t go in with any expectations. That’s just the reality.\n\nI’ve experienced the Olympic Village in Rio and Tokyo, but it can still feel chaotic. In the dining hall, there are so many people and so much going on, but our team pretty much hangs out together so it’s not as overwhelming. But I feel for the new people doing this for the first time. It can be a lot to take in and get used to the first couple days.\n\nSpeaking of the dining hall, have you heard about the chocolate muffins? They are really good. Like really good. Everyone’s eating them for dessert or just for a treat. It’s been fun to watch parts of the experience take off on social media, too. There was a Norwegian swimmer who posted TikToks about his chocolate muffin obsession. And my teammate created a funny TikTok about the Olympic pin trading game, because that’s her obsession. As for me, I’m just focused on Pat and playing the game. That said, the chocolate muffins are pretty bomb. And I do have a favorite village coffee shop that prints photos from your phone on your coffee foam. Whether it’s a photo of your dog or the Eiffel Tower, anything goes. Pat and I had our picture printed on our coffee, which was fun. Bike riding is new this year, but I don’t want to fall and hurt myself so I stick to walking. But there are people riding around near the river with a pretty view of the sunset, which is fun too.\n\nWhat’s surprised me the most so far at the Olympics is playing in different venues. For the quarterfinals, we were moved to a new, even bigger swimming venue, so it was an entirely new experience. It’s also been way louder than I expected in the venues, which makes it extremely hard to hear what your teammates are saying in the water. Luckily, I’ve been playing with them for years, so I’m able to figure it out. Whatever the environment is, that’s the environment, and we’ve just got to keep playing.\n\nMostly, I’m grateful that Pat is doing well right now. It’s a bonus to even have him here moving around, going to events and enjoying himself more than we thought he would. When he goes through treatment, it can deplete him, but his energy’s been so high and excited, so that’s a win in itself.\n\nThis interview has been edited."
