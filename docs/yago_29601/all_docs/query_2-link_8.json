        "text": "King Solomon’s Mines is a tricky story for the 21st century reader. H Rider Haggard’s novel was published in 1885, just a few years after his return from working in South Africa. It was an immediate success and remains in print, a ‘classic’. Rider Haggard was a loyal servant of the British Empire and he encountered some white colonialist adventurers while in South Africa. His books, today, are racist but, when first published, they fitted pretty comfortably with mainstream white European assumptions about the relationship between northern empires and the African continent. Moreover his books are still much enjoyed and can be seen as the source of Indiana Jones.\n\nStevenson was a political liberal and intellectual, of course, but that didn’t mean that he was immune from the ideas that dominated the 1930s, northern hemisphere worldview. King Solomon’s Mines was straightforward entertainment for most audiences and critics – it was included in the programme for the Venice Film Festival of 1937 being shortlisted for the Mussolini Cup for Best Foreign Film, an award that in retrospect you would not want to have won. Today the climax to the story, with volcanic eruptions filmed in the studio, remains exciting viewing.\n\nIt seems surprising that he was prepared to take a similar risk so soon after that unhappy experience. Anna Lee was to co-star and she records in her memoir how she, Robert, Paul and Eslanda (his wife) met, dined and became friends. Anna rather naively expressed surprise that not all London restaurants would allow black diners. So maybe Robeson trusted Stevenson. Robeson had also worked with Sir Cedric Hardwicke on the Drury Lane production of Show Boat. In this film Hardwicke played Allan Quartermain (not Quatermain as in the novel) and this link might have encouraged Robeson too.\n\nPaul Robeson had been living and working in London for a number of years before the film was made. By 1937 he was an international star – Showboat and Ol’ Man River had been presented and applauded on stage and screen. Robeson was also increasingly aware of the history of Africa, slavery and the naked racism that infected the United States and Europe. He had made Sanders of the River with Alexander Korda on the understanding that the film would portray black people sympathetically. It was released in 1935 to great acclaim but Robeson was quick to disassociate himself from a film that showed “the negro as… savage and childish.”\n\nJohn Loder who co-starred recalls, in his memoir published in 1977, a conversation he had with Robeson. “(We) had adjoining dressing rooms and had long talks and discussions together. He told me he was sending his son to school in Moscow, and I told him mine was going to Elton. Paul was very bitter about the colour problem in the U.S., and I agreed with him that perhaps he was doing the right thing.” It sounds like there was limited real understanding here!\n\nRobeson’s biographer quotes from two contemporary reviews of the film. “The black New York ‘Amsterdam Times’ expressed its gratitude that the film ‘at least doesn’t reek with the imperialistic theory of British superiority’ (most viewers today find that reek palpable), but the black Pittsburgh ‘Courier’ was wholly negative: Robeson ‘is made to sing childish lyrics to dreary tunes in the most unlikely circumstances.’”\n\nThose of you that have followed this story so far will not be surprised to learn that Graham Greene didn’t like it. He very much liked Rider Haggard’s novel, and wasn’t troubled by the colonialist message. The characters are all wrong but the “Worst crime of all to those who remember Quartermain’s boast – ‘I can safely say that there is not a petticoat in the whole history’ – is the introduction of an Irish blonde who has somehow become the cause of the whole expedition…” For all his reservations Greene rates the film as ‘seeable’ and notes that ‘the direction of Robert Stevenson (is) well above the English average.’\n\nBrian McFarlane is a little more forgiving. “Despite the sometimes irritating coyness of the writing and playing of the role, she (Anna Lee) is allowed a surprising freedom as she talks to Umbopa. In fact the sense of ease between Umbopa and the whites, especially a white woman, is perhaps the most ‘liberal’ aspect of the film, which in most respects is ‘rousing, schoolboy adventure fare.’”"
