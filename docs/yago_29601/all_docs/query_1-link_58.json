Anna is an example of what a young girl could do in those days. By her marriage to William Armistead of Eastmost River, Anna became the sister-in-law of King Carter, Ralph Wormeley, and William Churchill. The Cotillon Leaders of the Rappahannock in that era by this marriage she had a daughter, Mary, who married Phillip Lightfoot. Member of the council, friend and cousin of Thomas Lee of Stratford. William Armistead died 1711, leaving Anna with children; she then married William Eustace, who died 1740. From the second union there were three sons, William, Hancock, and Isaac Eustace. This family will later cross again through Mary and Phillip Lightfoot (from FamilySearch.org, 5 Aug 2013).\n\nIn the past, researchers have assumed that Anna and Anne were identical.[1] A very well-written article by James R. Hancock, using primary documents, has solved the question of Anna and Anne Lee.[2] He shows they are two different women, half-sisters.\n\nAnna Lee (and also included Ann and Anne in the data field for Other Nicknames to help find and prevent duplicates).\n\nThere were two different daughters of Hancock Lee, this one named Anna Lee, was a daughter of his 1st wife, Mary Kendall. She married William Armstead.\n\nThe other named Anne Lee was a daughter of 2nd wife, Sarah Allerton. She married William Eustace.[2]\n\nOrigin\n\nAnn was born before 1682, at Ditchley, Northumberland County, Virginia. She was a daughter of Hancock Lee and Mary Kendall.[2]\n\nPer the sources on her father, Hancock's profile, Ann was born Anna, prior to January 5, 1682 and was living as late as October 1754.\n\nMarriages and Children\n\nAnna married only once.\n\nShe married before 1706 to William Armstead.[2][3] He died on 13 June 1711.[2]\"William Armistead in the U.S. and International Marriage Records, 1560-1900.\" William Armistead in the U.S. and International Marriage Records, 1560-1900.
