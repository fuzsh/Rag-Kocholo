        "text": "Born a proud and steadfast Irishman on June 13, 1865 in Sandymount, Republic of Ireland, William Butler Yeats spent his life seeking his very own breed of perfection he sought it in women, in mysticism, in his country and apparently he found it in his writing. An author of an ever evolving and growing style that ranged from an early love of Irish mythology and the occult resulted in slow paced, balladic poetry reminiscent of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood he so admired to a later development of a more original style that was pragmatic and substantial. He sought after all that he personally found beautiful including the ever elusive Maud Gonne and even her daughter. A Nobel prize winner, lesser known lover of theater, and Nationalist senator for the Irish Free State for a total of two terms, William Butler Yeats life was the story of which pieces reflected in his poetry, if you wish to read more about his failed romances, adventures in politics or influential childhood please refer back to my earlier posts linked below.\n\nMaster of hyperboles and romanticized declarations of affection William Butler Yeats, is forever the naive lover caught up in his adoration of another(usually a woman). He has dictated yet another story of lustful devotion to a woman, or greatly respected official. The Irish poet incorporates both his yearning for women who will never crave him in return, and his great ardor for mysticism into his writing, constituting a cavaliering, yet still strikingly beautiful collaboration of egotism and controlled fervor. Yeats is a master craftsmen assured of the outcome of his every literary choice, his work never fails to feel meticulous and proudly constructed even if it is often well aware of it’s own superiority. A quality which somewhat diminishes its rarity and charismatic charm, Yeats’s words are self-assured to a point where though they are definitely lovely they have a quality of rather bothersome prestige. So in his lop-sided portrait of venerated love Yeats comes off as both capable and talented, but also arrogantly pompous and condemning. “He Wishes for Cloths of Heaven” is an accomplishment of a well tuned tongue, and artful pen, but it resonates no deeper that it’s visual words which often seem overly expressive to a point where they exceed reality and instead feel gloriously fictional as a fairy-tale romance, their impression is neither lastingly wistful nor heartbreaking, and our recovery as the reader seems as swift of the speaker’s as transition spiffily from line to line, ending not in a plea but an order.\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats as a proud and ruffled old codger, all the while still trying to keep up his scholarly appearance.\n\n“He Wishes for Cloths of Heaven”\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats\n\nHAD I the heavens' embroidered cloths,\n\nEnwrought with golden and silver light,\n\nThe blue and the dim and the dark cloths\n\nOf night and light and the half-light,\n\nI would spread the cloths under your feet:\n\nBut I, being poor, have only my dreams;\n\nI have spread my dreams under your feet;\n\nTread softly because you tread on my dreams.\n\nThe legendary \"Kiss\" on V-J day in New York's Times Square captured on film by Alfred Eisenstaedt.\n\nThe verse form employed by William Butler Yeats, is of no distinguishable title, it seems to be merely a simple, slightly messy octet( a poetic stanza of eight lines). It has no breaks between thoughts but exists as a single declaration of ardor, with each line being from eight to ten syllables done in an alternating iambic tetrameter, giving his poem an attempt at ordered cadence, but ends up with a rather disordered and rushed tempo. Yeats is far too proud to use something as traditional and elementary as rhyme scheme, so instead he utilizes repetition to achieve the stabilizing effect of repeated sound, he uses it both at the end of his lines in “light” and “cloths”, “feet” and “dreams” and intermingled throughout in the forms of “and”, “tread”, and again “light” and “dreams”, the effect does inspire a certain unity but it is not so fluent as it cannot be found elsewhere in other forms. “He Wishes for Cloths of Heaven” is neither a unusual nor a poignant poem, yet it is nonetheless arresting purely in the amount of pride and thought it contains.\n\nIn “He Wishes for Cloths of Heaven,” Yeats takes on the mentality of an impoverished, but devout friend, servant, follower or lover having nought but his aspirations and hopes for a better future lays down not items or gifts of material beauty but swears as he is unable to physically give he will give from his soul and sacrifice his dreams in order to fulfill the wishes of his master or complete the tasks he has been assigned. Yeats speaks of giving all that he is able. Yeats’s speaker doesn’t just claim to give in to the task he does so with faithful willingness, he boasts of a loyalty incomparable. Perhaps, this statement is an allusion to a society where “material pleasures” are godly acquisitions reserved for those of wealth and power only, making Yeats’s protagonist who seems to be of a lower social class unable to give gifts of grandeur without significant losses. In entrusting his faith in a “higher power” Yeats gives away a degree of his own freedom. Unable to spare items of material value, he is left with nothing to give to please this higher power but his time, manual labor, quality of life, maybe even his daughters or family. In the verisimilitude of such truth we see that this “royalty” of sorts is essentially in control of this man’s dreams or the very least his ability to achieve them. It is only natural that one in such a position would wish for tangible possession so that things so personally would never have to bared before the whims of someone else, yet this is only a wish and he’s hopes for a more opulent existence are left only as exaggerated dreams. As all men lust after what they cannot have. Yeats utilizes the symbology of generations of cultures to give depth to the meaning of these cloths, transforming them into an object of jaw dropping splendor in the eyes of his speaker. These cloths: embroidered and bursting with scintillating regality, capable of bringing about the day and night, so beyond him they reek of mystery and strength. In his eyes these cloths are mystical items in and of themselves made of “The blue and the dim and the dark” perhaps blue is symbolic of masculinity, royalty or stability a vivid contrast to the awe-inspiring mysticism and obscurity that is the dim, where the dark is far deeper than both ominous and filled with irrevocable power, like the transition from dusk to night, clarity to ambiguity the sky fades feel so much closer and more intimate in its sinister darkness. But despite this description these cloths are simultaneously not just “Of night” but of “light and the half-light” as well. They are day and dusk, dawn and night all at once and yet all the parts remain separate and distinguishable. They aren’t just black or white, yet neither are they grey. It would seem that these cloths of heaven are beyond human description and certainly beyond human creation. It seems strange that something as mundane as fancy fabric should be glorified in such a way, and regarded with such divine reverence when it has always been an essential aspect of religion to transcend the physical world. So maybe Yeats is instead alluding to the spiritual nature of heaven’s gifts, if this man could receive holy cloth to place upon the feet of the one he so reveres he would, but the “almighty” does not work in such trivial ways. He instead gives something far more potent than textiles; hopes and dreams, incorporeal assertions and beliefs, never anything that is concrete enough to be held in human hands. So this compositions hero is left to bare his fragile visions before him, out where are sure to be crushed by reality.\n\nBut perchance this was not the intended meaning of William Butler Yeats’s poem at all, perhaps these celestial feet don’t belong to a god or king or a man at all but instead a woman. Yeats, indignant, yet ever the hopeless romantic asserts he has no corporeal gifts to offer, and is only capable of giving his thoughts, fantasies and ideas before unto her, giving her the full responsibility of being the keeper of his aspiration resting what must be an incredible burden upon her shoulder though she never asked for such a moral burden with only the vague assurance that she herself is one. So in his act of apparently selfless generosity and naive adoration he has become more selfish than he could have been in any other scenario, he has piled upon his the woman the entire guilt of his happiness and somehow expect her to be grateful or flatter, the thought is less touching and more egotistical.\n\n“He Wishes for Cloths of Heaven,” leaves much to interpretation, yet having been so adroitly and beguilingly written, we as the reader are made to feel of such consequence in the action of reading it, that we share an experience that must be the same as philosophers do in theorizing the fate of humanity or demise of the earth. An immense emotion is synthetically conceived inside of us, that what we should ponder is not a simple amorous verse but an allegorical key to the universe. Yeats has composed with such eloquence and articulation that his every word has the impression of heavy connotation. Far too serious for rhymes, Yeats chooses repetition to lend emphasis and rhythm to his poetry pulling it all together with contemporary language and skillful punctuation. William Butler Yeats for all its apparent shallowness, is a guilty pleasure in it’s ability to make its audience feel important simply to hear it.\n\nPierre Auguste Cot's famous 1873 oil on canvas, depiction of young lovers, entitled \"Le Printemps(Spring)\".\n\nThere are several authors that one can look to in search of classic, still wild and inventive adventure, one might first think of Jules Verne or Mark Twain, Herman Melville or Arthur Conan Doyle; but eventually you would come across Robert Louis Stevenson and that is because no does intrepid expedition or mystery quite so well. From “Treasure Island” to “Kidnapped” no one has children’s hearts beating quite as fast as Stevenson nor keeps them on the edge of their seats quite so completely. Stevenson however did not just right adventure he lived it, he lived in many countries and traveled to more still, he sailed the open sea, and befriended native Islanders, he jumped through a windows to proclaimed his love to a stranger, and did it all while suffering from a ghastly lung condition. A native Scotsman by birth, and a Samoan Islander by funeral ceremony, Stevenson’s life was quite as intriguing and enthralling as the novels he wrote. Although, the praise of his work has come and gone in the world of academia, he has never lost appeal to the children and adults who treasured his stories. If you wish to read more of his poems, or delve deeper into his incredible life, below are linked a selection of other poetic analysis, all of which explore his life in greater detail(however the most comprehensive biography can be found in “Where Go the Boats”).\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson, and his wife Fanny in their temporary home in the Samoan Islands.\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson as a boy, with his father Thomas Stevenson.\n\n“My Shadow”\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson\n\n​I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,\n\nAnd what can be the use of him is more than I can see.\n\nHe is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;\n\nAnd I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.\n\nThe funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow--\n\nNot at all like proper children, which is always very slow;\n\nFor he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,\n\nAnd he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.\n\nHe hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,\n\nAnd can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.\n\nHe stays so close beside me, he's a coward you can see;\n\nI'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!\n\n​\n\nOne morning, very early, before the sun was up,\n\nI rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;\n\nBut my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,\n\nHad stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson plays the Oboe during a relapse of his lung condition.\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson is part symbol, part man. He stands for all that is naive day-dreaming, for adventures on the open, for dark and twisted mystery, for murder and piracy, kidnapping and long lost treasures. Too grand and imaginative to be fully human, who lived a life so wild and wondrous it seems beyond reality. Stevenson has long crafted swashbuckling tales and adventure hungry heroes that never fail to delight and enthrall, no matter how old you may grow, or how the world might change. A masterful storyteller, Stevenson has a strong grasp of the importance of a healthy heart beat and wrote, many an intrepid novel, in accordance with his belief of his audience on the edge of their seats and feverishly rifling through the not just pages but entire chapters as he proved in works such as “Treasure Island” and “The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,” whose renown is well earned by their basic yet skillful and inventive plots.\n\nThe arrangement of Robert Louis Stevenson’s “My Shadow,” is simple and steadfast, it is neither convoluted nor filled with extemporaneous ramifications. A poem originally intended for children yet so charismatic and straight-forward even adults cannot help enjoy it. Whether, you expand it for have allegorical meaning or take it as simply nonsensical humor it is work of elementary charms and clever verse. “My Shadow” is a total of 16 lines, 4 quatrains of near identical syllabic format each fourteen syllable line is cadenced in perfect iambic feet from start to finish beginning with flawless accuracy, each line begins anew with a new alignment of iambic feet. The rhyme scheme of the piece is classical plain, similar to a nursery rhyme Stevenson uses the traditional AABB then CCDD and so on to great effect. Stevenson also uses several literary devices to give his poem a witty edge, and appealing intricacy while never taking it too far. He utilizes transparent repetition through the composition from the consecutive order of “very, very” to line after line use of “sometimes” and even the internal repetition of “stick to/sticks to” in the twelfth line. The most obvious literary device is of course personification, in how Stevenson gives human emotion to a shadow.\n\nHowever, as in the case of his poem: “My Shadow” Stevenson demonstrates a dual adeptness of not just entertaining children, but harnessing their imaginations and exploring their minds. He writes from the perspective of a child, and does so expertly, bringing the whimsical down to earth with the application of the naive logic of youth. What was once impossible is suddenly not just plausible but beyond questioning. The existence of fairies and Santa Claus are not just stories that are everyday incarnations of the magical world children exist in. For the truth is a matter not of evidence but belief, and every man and woman will have their own faith, just as every child will have an entire reality that are encased within. There comes a time when every child grows to large and cultured for their innocent realities and that shell that once protected them becomes delicate and permeable, even absorbent it no longer shields them from their surroundings but soaks them in, magnifying every insult or revelation, and their FADING SHIELD becomes too weak and battered to carry on. There are only so many bullets a WALL can take, and a child’s world will shatter showered them in the cutting shards of everything in which they once had faith, as the harsh and force of reality will be brought down upon their youth from all that surrounds us. All this brings about a period of transitional confusion, everything that was once clear and certain, becomes muddled and treacherous, because now nothing can be taken in without doubt in and no one can be trusted. After all, even our parents have lied to us. Where is Santa Claus? The Tooth-fairy? Easter Bunny? Life is not a fairy tale? There is no magic. There comes a time in every child’s life when his/her convictions are brought about for questioning by their peers and not everyone bubble of innocent sincerity will shatter simultaneously or at an opportune moment, it may come too early brought about not by an internal clock but by the cruel facts of existence, leaving the soul vulnerable, and prematurely exposed, these children have not been given time for their confidences to concrete. So when interrogated or mocked they drop their old ideas obediently. This insecurity may drive them to attack another child defenses as though the fall of their own shield has caused a chain reaction it’s shrapnel impaling many more than just its first victim. For after all misery loves company. The broken now strive to assert their new bitter truths upon other children desperate for these truths to be more stable than the last. Guided in this action by the misconception that this will bring them stability. However, very few truths are universal and stability is not found in surrounding yourself in a single truth but by trusting in and developing your own based on your own values and experiences. Stevenson’s description of a shadow is so beautiful in it’s naive description of the shadow as though it were capable of human emotion and feeling, as though the it’s simple existence and concept was an everyday miracle. Obvious observations regarding the shadow’s appearance such as “He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;” are not annoying but comic. He describes the shadow is a way that is neither new nor shocking but he has given it such life with his clever personification that suddenly that is plenty. Some interpret the last lines of “My Shadow” as reference to sorrow or death, as the speaker( a young boy)’s shadow: “Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.”\n\nbut it seems far more likely that it is nearly nothing more than a cloudy day or has stated earlier in the stanza it is simply: “very early, before the sun was up”. Robert Louis Stevenson is as delightfully charming and his personification of a young boy’s shadow is not shallow for it’s lack of deeper or complex meaning but rare and delightful or it’s basic form and swift and astute language.\n\nStevenson writes about a period of impeccable collaborations, where he is a boy of affirmed realities and guaranteed truths. His shadow has a unique mind of it’s own and Stevenson masterfully conveys the chimerical cognition as irrevocable veracity. His poem is a nursery rhyme turned humorous exploit. Appealing openly to children with it’s simple consistent rhyme scheme, and clever but not confusing wording. “My Shadow” captures the confidence and candid honesty of childhood, in a fashion that ends in empathy and hilarity for the young and a pleasant nostalgia for such light-hearted obstacles as apathetic shadows for the aging. It resonates with the youthful mind and displays a talented grasp of imagery in addition to the continued theme of personification making Stevenson’s poem engaging and enjoyable.\n\nWhether you find it pleasing in regard to its buoyant verse or simply for it's the frolicsome antics of it’s characters, whether you treasure it’s joyous nostalgia( in how it reminds one of the effervescence of your youth) or relish is its relevance to your present life. Robert Louis Stevenson “My Shadow” is a charismatic, captivating and never fails to please.\n\nAcrylic on Canvas entitled \"Shadow Play\" by Sandy Tracy.\n\nFrom there Sandburg's then moved to Chicago, where Carl became the editorial writer for the Chicago Daily News. Harriet Taubman, founder of Poetry: A Magazine of Verse, developed a fondness for Carl’s liberated, yet unostentatious style so reminiscent of bittersweet freedom of Whitman and began to publish his poems establishing him as a member of the Chicago literary renaissance.But it was here that he, as of this period, being Socialist sympathizer, working for the Social-Democrat Party in Wisconsin became the acting secretary of the first Socialist mayor of Milwaukee from 1910 to 1912. Additionally, while in Milwaukee, he married, the sister of photographer Edward Steichen, a woman by the name of Lillian Steichen.​Never, again will there be such a writer capable of such individual style or subtle audacity as Carl Sandburg, born on Epiphany(January 6) of 1878 in Galesburg, Illinois. The winner of not one, but three Pulitzer prizes for literature, one for his biography of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th American president and Abolitionist hero, and two for his poetry. The American poet, writer and editor has became not just applauded for singular Asian-American fusion style, but his status as President Lyndon B. Johnson phrased it in his Eulogy speech at the poet’s death in 1967, “Carl Sandburg was more than the voice of America, more than the poet of its strength and genius. He was America.” Thought of as “A major literary figure in contemporary literature” especially for the ingenuity of his anthologies of collected verse, from Chicago Poems (1916) and Cornhuskers (1918)both of which earned him his first Pulitzer prize, to Smoke and Steel (1920), a portrayal of industrial America. Carl Sandburg was not born into fame, he was born into poverty, as the only child of Northern Swedish immigrants August and Clara Johnson, who after August found a job with the railroads changed the family name to Sandburg. Such was their economic state that at the age of thirteen, Carl left school to perform odd jobs, including bricklaying and dishwashing. After, traveling west to Kansas as a hobo, at age seventeen Carl served eight months in Puerto Rico during the Spanish-American war . Here, he left a student from a small school located in his own home town. Carl Sandburg was convinced by his friend to enroll in Lombard College upon returning from the war. The ambitious and determined Carl worked his way through college for four years but he never received a diploma(despite his later honorary degrees from Lombard, Knox College and Northwestern University). However, while in college his talent was discovered by his Professor Philip Green Wright, who encouraged and paid for the first publication of Carl’s writing( a volume of poetry, contained in pamphlet called Reckless Ecstasy, 1904). When Carl moved on to Milwaukee, his work as a advertising writer and newspaper reporter became the sad, replacement for the informed and creative writing he had done in college.But it was here that he, as of this period, being Socialist sympathizer, working for the Social-Democrat Party in Wisconsin became the acting secretary of the first Socialist mayor of Milwaukee from 1910 to 1912.\n\nA young Carl Sandburg at his typewriter.\n\n“Fog”\n\nCarl Sandburg\n\n​\n\nThe fog comes\n\non little cat feet.\n\nIt sits looking\n\nover harbor and city\n\non silent haunches\n\nand then moves on.\n\nMarek Langowski's beautiful and distanced, abstract oil on canvas of a city blanketed in fog.\n\nAdditionally, while in Milwaukee, he married, the sister of photographer Edward Steichen, a woman by the name of Lillian Steichen.

Harriet Taubman, founder of Poetry: A Magazine of Verse, developed a fondness for Carl’s liberated, yet unostentatious style so reminiscent of bittersweet freedom of Whitman and began to publish his poems establishing him as a member of the Chicago literary renaissance. Encouraged and self-assured, Carl Sandburg began his most ambitious project, a biography of Abraham Lincoln, Sandburg’s own personal childhood hero. Sandburg collected Primary resources and began the legendary six-volume work. He followed this masterpiece with balladic collection of American folklore: The American Songbag and The New American Songbag (1950). These pieces were the subject of brief tours across America Sandburg toke for several years accompanied by banjo or guitar . In his final years Carl Sandburg continued to express himself as a patriot, from extensions of his biography Mary Lincoln, Wife and Widow (1932), The People, Yes (1936), Abraham Lincoln: The War Years (1939), to Complete Poems, which earned him his second Pulitzer in 1950 to his final two volumes of verse: Harvest Poems, 1910-1960 (1960) and Honey and Salt (1963). It was on July 22, 1967 that Carl Sandburg died enjoying “unrivaled appeal as a poet in his day, perhaps because the breadth of his experiences connected him with so many strands of American life”( according to Danny Heitman in A Workingman's Poet).\n\nAn aging Carl Sandburg, enjoying his leisure time with his grandson.\n\nOne, cool and misting Chicago night when the darkness had only just begun to creep into the Harbor, a still young and already prolific Carl Sandburg took a shortcut through Grant Park, he was on his way to interview a juvenile court judge, but had around forty minutes before before he had to meet the man. Sandburg was no stranger to heavy formless water vapor that hung upon the harbor like a woolen blanket( save for the fact that the vapor stole the heat that blankets gave). But something was different about that fog, maybe it was the book of Japanese Haikus he was carrying in his pocket, or the convenient piece of newsprint he had with him, but that evening proved to the genesis of one the most iconic free verses of American history.\n\nSandburg writes confidently and with wit, eloquence and pleasing rhythm. His work is brief, no more than two short sentences, deftly broken apart and placed line by line in an orderly fashion upon the page. Every line is bluntly succinct; never more than four words. Sandburg’s willingness to allow his words to stand alone, displays a literary tenacity and in return he is rewarded with simply cadenced verse and a elegant poem divided into pithy and deliberate thoughts allowing for easy, yet thorough dissection and a clear presentation of his extended metaphor. Such is adeptness with which this poem had been written that it requires no pre-determined rhyme scheme or format. Sandburg uses the flexibility allowed to him by choosing free verse to emphasis such ideas as independence and strength with controlled poise.\n\nThe arrangement of “Fog” is so brilliantly basic, it sings of understated beauty. A quick eight syllable couplet, it followed by a nineteen syllable quatrain, the lines are consistently short and concise while never exceeding seven syllables or four words. This emphasis on delicate and graceful detail and treasury of natural simplicity and raw splendor embodies the dignified yet relaxed phonetic movement, the poems flow without the aid of rhyme or established reason. Sandburg is renowned for the detached nature of his original free verse which requires no discernible pattern to feel calculated or precise. “Fog” moves with eloquence and intelligence, it is neither earthly and existential, and mundane falls far short in describing it’s amiable flow.\n\nCarl Sandburg is a subtle master, with few words and romantic charm gives something of little observable substance the living, breathing qualities and contemplative attributes of a living creature. Sandburg opens “Fog” with zoomorphic personification using “little cat feet” to lend grace, stealth and agility to his vaporous entity. He then expands into a simple and sensible metaphor, comparing his amorphous cloud to a feline lending it qualities such as regal autonomy and restless curiosity. The detached warmth of cats is lovable despite their reputation for slight haughtiness they also have a wonderful familiar quality that reminds one of the hearth and home. The watery smoke that Sandburg’s he is so distant yet familiar, so very much like a cat, whose sovereignty is immortal, they will forever come and go as they pleases, fickle friends, governed only by self-sufficiency, they have always existed just out of our reach(seeming to disappear completely at close range), and yet it somehow makes the time spent with them all the more special. But somehow infinitely casual. Sandburg uses this feral, yet intimate liberation to describe the drive behind the fog’s briefest of visits and swiftest of departures, all the while never truly leaving us.\n\nThere had never been such a beloved or well received free-verse as “Fog”, never before had so something so uniquely American, yet with slight elements of Asian candor been so widely acclaimed or popular. The piece was direct and captivating, it had stability without being overbearing, clarity without being elementary, clever without being beyond the ordinary mind, short and yet far from forgettable. Although, first published in Carl Sandburg’s first mainstream collection of poetry entitled Chicago poems(1916), it appeared many times afterwards in several anthologies, perhaps the first of which being the 1919 Untermeyer, Louis edition of Modern American Poetry, by Harcourt, Brace and Howe. When, “Fog” alongside several other poems from Chicago poems in Poetry, a literary magazine of the time, it received this glowing review from Harriet Monroe,\n\n“I remember the emotion with which I first read many of these poems ... That first conviction of beauty and power returns to me as I read them again. This is speech torn out of the heart, because the loveliness of ... a fog coming on \"little cat feet,\"—the incommunicable loveliness of the earth, of life—is too keen to be borne ….”\n\nThe only started here however as in the years of 1959 and 1960, a dramatic stage reading of selected Sandburg poems and prose entitled The World of Carl Sandburg, performed by Bette Davis and her husband Gary Merrill who toured the the nation and their shows culminated in a one-month run on Broadway( with Leif Erickson instead of Merrill) a performance that received the glowing accolade from the New York Times Howard Taubman( in the August 15, 1960 issue, page 44):\n\n“… as if on catlike feet, she makes \"Fog\" seem new; …”\n\nAs well as staged dramatic readings, Carl Sandburg’s poems were also glorified in radio reading and vinyl recordings, as well as being at the receiving end of several parodies from the Richard Brautigan in 1956 to an episode of The McLaughlin Group in 2008. Sandburg snares our attention and briefly tantalizes our cognitive processes and literary senses, all the while with bright and intrepid eagerness, blended with feline impatience and graceful speed the poem is even more fleeting than the “fog” it illustrates, leaving us dazzled in it’s serene wake.\n\nLaura A.

One of the most influential painters of the first half of the 20th century, Hartley born on the January 4, 1877 in Lewiston, Maine and become a member of a circle of American modernist painter including Georgia O’Keeffe, John Marin, Arthur Dove, and Charles Demuth. An avid traveler, Hartley’s many trips to Europe, Mexico, Bermuda, and Nova Scotia were an influence in his varying artistic styles and aims. A factor that never varied however was Harley’s fondness for the rough, rocky coastal landscape of his own home state, Maine. Raised by his aunt, Hartley moved at the age of 16 in 1893 to live with his father and stepmother, Martha Marsden in Cleveland, Hartley seems to have developed a deep respect for his stepmother as it was her maiden name that he adapted as a first name, as his own birth name was Edmund. In 1898, he received a scholarship to the Cleveland School of Art, he was so well received here that he was gifted a five-year stipend to study art in New York. During the years of 1899 to 1900 he took classes at William Merritt Chase's New York School of Art, and additionally attended the National Academy of Design from 1900 to 1904. During the summers however he returned to his beloved Maine to paint landscapes. Hartley’s early art was influenced by the likes of various emerging artists whom he had been introduced to in his studies and resulting contacts with rising circles in New York including Cezanne, Matisse and Picasso. Hartley’s first solo exhibition in Alfred Stieglitz’s 291 gallery in 1909 and following success in 1912 gave him the opportunity to travel to Europe. Paris, London, Munich, and Berlin, were all given special attention by Hartley because it was here that he met a myriad of the European modernist artists and began painting abstractions and was even given the opportunity to exhibit with Der Blaue Reiter group at the 1913 Herbstsalon( the First German Autumn Salon) in Berlin. Hartley’s German paintings were revealed to be an intriguing combination of his fascination with Germany’s military regalia and American Indian motifs, and resulted in audacious symbolic works. When he returned to New York in 1915, Hartley once again made a point to socialize with the rising numbers of progressive painters and continued to travel frequently but this time to more tropical and native countries such as Bermuda and Mexico allowing their colorful styles to bleed into his own work, he produced numerous Still Lifes and landscapes. It was during this period of his life when he began to write, including poetry and critical essays which were published in his own book: Adventures in the Arts in 1921. In order to return to Europe, Hartley returned to New York and auctioned off a total of 117 of his paintings as Anderson Galleries. While in europe he painted several Cezanne inspired landscapes in France, Austria, Italy and Germany traveling regularly until 1930 he returned to U.S.A. to utilize a Guggenheim Fellowship in Mexico from 1932-1933, and spent the following year back in Germany. The spiritual essence of nature became very clear and important to Hartley during his many travels, and he often explored this theme in his painting for the rest of his life. After this, Hartley’s life became much more low-key and following a short time in New York interrupted only by two trips to Nova Scotia(1935 and 1936) he returned to Maine after his last Stieglitz-organized exhibition in 1937. Maine was Hartley’s permanent home for the remainder of his life, and it was here that he embraced poetry and landscape and figure painting through the rugged environment and people of Maine. Though, he was rather sickly, weak and ill through the later years of his life, 1939 and 1943 he continued to be a man of individual and independent strength, with poised control and an impeccable sense of reason, during these years interrupted only by Duncan Phillips( an old customer from 1921) who bought six oils, Hartley endured to paint and seclude himself in his cherished homeland until his death in Ellsworth, Maine in 1943.\n\nSharon Cumming's colorful portrait of a grouper with kaleidoscopic scales.\n\nMarsden Hartley’s “Fishmonger” is a unique and eloquent piece written in playful free verse unhindered by rhyme schemes and formats, repetition or stanzas. Hartley’s imaginative use of language and literary devices, as well as his lack of established form reflects his occupation as not just a poet and essayist but also a painter. The entire poem is one uninterrupted, extended thought written in single twenty-two line stanza. Divided only by punctuation and the pauses caused by the separation between lines. Hartley uses the liberation of free verse to create a poem of moderate length that flows easily and escapes sounding tedious or overly turgid.\n\nThe format of Marsden Hartley’s “Fishmonger” is as independent and individual as time itself, it flows with all the constant and ceaseless fluency of passing hours. Time does not stop for anything and neither does Hartley, he does not pause or divide his composition but lets it remain authentic and unadulterated. However, time can be divided into moments of varying lengths and significances in one’s mind and Hartley utilizes just this quality to give his poem the articulation of lines while never altering from his consistent theme of time.\n\nFifteen lines of varying syllabic and visual lengths comprise, “Fishmonger” and it’s meter seems to iambic that renews itself every line. Some lines appear longer to draw contemplation and slow the reader’s pace and some lines appear shorter to draw emphasis and enlightened attention. The pace of “Fishmonger,” is fairly rapid and engaging as apart from the separation of line, it has no pauses, and a good deal of action is condensed into the poem’s brief life, so most of the thought concerning more convoluted meaning follows the reading, staying with it’s audience for a while afterward. Although, the poem has no rhyme scheme or rhyme of any sort for that matter, repetition is utilized to a similar effect of adding a natural quality to the poem’s flow and creating connection between poetic thoughts, it is used through the first five lines in the form of “I have” to begin lines, “Are” is used in the same fashion in the eleventh and tenth lines, as is “For whom” in the thirteenth and fourteenth. The arrangement of “Fishmonger” is wild and free, with raw fluency and charisma it is a beautiful poem, that feel as beautiful and natural as any temporal length of event or entity's existence.\n\nThe originality of Hartley’s poem comes from the creativity behind his extended metaphor, rare in its striking individuality and eccentricity of choice for comparison through Hartley’s charming prose an aquatic animal on mindlessly gray and slippery, dull and slimy becomes beyond mundane description. To begin this analogous picture, Hartley first, verbally and through vibrant imagery, constructs from various objects of noted beauty a fish of iridescent scales,\n\n“I have taken scales from off\n\nThe cheeks of the moon.”\n\nIn just two brief lines Hartley’s first person speaker personifies the moon in a fairly intimate way, giving it’s rotundity a facial quality, yet also establishes the fish as no mere being of the sea, but a creatures whose beauty is more than earthly, and indeed celestial. In the next line, he gives the fish, a creature once doomed forever to water, the freedom of air, while simultaneously providing vivid color and delicate finesse: “I have made fins from bluejays’ wings,”. He gives his fish eyes of the deep regal purple of a small, rich plum(the damson is an edible drupaceous fruit, and subspecies of the plum tree). Hartley continues his exploration of the rainbow with a questionable line regarding “flushes taken from peachlips in the sun.” what exactly Hartley means by “peachlips in the sun” is unclear the word has no formal definition and even informally is surely not something that has much exposure to sun. Perhaps, this is a fantasy? Or dreamlike image? Whatever the object in question, the intended shade of rosy pink comes instantly to mind. Composed of a myriad of colors, Hartley’s speakers has “From all these I have made a fish of heaven for you,” giving his imaginary creature a owner. This “fish” is then not released into water as with only ordinary wish but “Set it swimming on a young October sky”. The surrounding are described as warm and transitional, both welcoming and evolving simultaneously as the world around transforms, the consistency of beauty worries our protagonist. Will his work remain acceptable it to the one he has given it to( which must be a lover)?\n\nThe construction of the poem and its emphasis suggest an allegorical meaning behind the rainbow fish. Perhaps, it builds upon an extension of water’s symbolism: alluding to freedom from form or constraint, or the ever flow of time. But then again Hartley may mean the fish to be the embodiment of his love for a woman, beautiful and multicolored: ever so carefully and lovingly constructed with meticulously selected items of the rarest and most gentle grace. This amorous fish would then be released into the river of time, that seems to run forward from the horizon in her honor, here it shall be openly judged by the elements and evolution. Yet, as his work flows out of his control Hartley’s speaker does not mourn it’s freedom but instead relaxes upon the side of the river that seems to symbolize currents of time.\n\n“I sit on the bank of the stream and watch\n\nThe grasses in amazement\n\nAs they turn to ashy gold.”\n\nHartley’s speaker pictures as unaffected(save for awe and slight spontaneity) by the changes that occur around him, his love will never alter he seems to believe he will remain loyal and patient: feeling of adoration unchanged forever. Here, upon “the bank of the stream” he remarks upon the raw appeal of his surroundings, regarding rather suddenly and with surprising shock and awe: the metamorphosis of river grasses into “ashy gold” not as pure and striking as his own fish but carry a singular beauty none the less. Although, this particular change is one of the innocent and annual changes that come once a year, not at that time beckons in will be so positive, especially at first glance. Sometimes, age can dull colors and fade the appeal of an aesthetic(may it be note though that Hartley choose to give his fish a quality that to the best of knowledge as never faded: the glow of the moon). This change nevertheless awakens in Hartley’s character, an immediate fear that his fish may be become lackluster in the eyes of his beloved.\n\n“Are the fishes from the rainbow\n\nStill beautiful to you,”\n\nHe fears she may no longer see the allure in his creation, because not all things can stand the test of time, and if this is indeed a love based solely on thing of visual beauty how can it be expected to hold up to the trials of age?\n\nMarsden Hartley has written something of a near extinct quality of originality, he fearlessly pioneers in an area of tradition and repetition, creating an exclusive and unexpected metaphor of unparalleled creativity and charm. There is something deeply endearing about Hartley’s uncertainty in the face of time’s erosion, his fear that it will destroy his creation that has been nurtured with such adoration and loyalty;\n\n“For whom they are made,\n\nFor whom I have set them,\n\nSwimming?”\n\nThe speaker begs the eternal rhetorical question is beauty truly so fickle as to die with the seasons? His naive reverence of the continuing natural processes around him, and also his reference to October: the first true month of autumn, when the seasons is truly evident in the earnest shower of leaves. October is the catalyzer of the fiery colors, frigid, breeze and hibernation, as the chronology of the natural world leeches the warmth from the air, inciting the first frost. Hartley draws forth from nature both glory and inevitability. His prose is delightful and sensuous, full of light-hearted illusions and innocently childish emotions. For surely anyone who constructs their love from an impossible collection of material things cannot expect it to survive time, love must be deeper than this. The poem is one of innovation and artistry in-spite of the past, facilitating a romance that brims with honest naivety and a touch of candid ignorance. “Fishmonger” is a fluid and delightful composition, a fine catch which glows with all the energy of youth, fresh and eager in its embrace of emotion, new syntax and language, reflecting the natural patterns and vivacious colors of life.\n\nAn iridescent puffer-fish by Sharon Cummings.\n\nAn illustration of Louisa May Alcott during her years as a nurse in the civil war.\n\n“To the One Who Teaches Me”\n\nLouisa May Alcott\n\n\"To one who teaches me\n\nThe sweetness and the beauty\n\nOf doing faithfully\n\nAnd cheerfully my duty.\"\n\nFamous for her myriad of bizarre and symbolic self-portraits, Frida Kahlo was an eminent feminist and trail-blazer in the field of women's artistic expression. This one, entitled \"Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird\", is displayed in Nickolas Muray Collection, Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin.\n\nAn older Louisa May Alcott, captured in a photographic portrait.\n\nIt wasn’t easy to be a female writer in the Victorian Era, many such as Mary Ann Evans(George Elliot), Alice Bradley Sheldon(James Tiptree), Charlotte Bronte(Currer Bell) and her sister Emily Bronte(Ellis Bell) published under male pen names in order to get sizable recognition. The eminent works of both Bronte sisters, including Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights were originally published under their male pen names, both wanted to separate themselves from the frivolous or even negative associations of female writers at the time. Due to the still strong and demeaning misogynist mindset, society found it difficult to view women as serious writers especially in America where it would be decades before they were allowed to vote in most states(Wyoming gave women full suffrage in 1869). During this time women were often treated with less respect than children, doomed to thought of as petty poets who wrote only as a tawdry past time. A myriad of the incredibly gifted and immensely popular women authors whom we recognize today, such as Karen Blixen(who published Out of Africa under the pen name Isak Dinesen), Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin( author of Indiana under the pen name George Sand), and of course Louisa May Alcott(her early works were published under the pen name: A. M. Barnard) all began slowly under their male pen names, only if ever revealing themselves after they had gained wide commendation. Louisa May Alcott was a talented and spirited individual, her writing was candid and full of spunk, she often wrote about her own real-life experiences. A little more self-conscious at the birth of her career, she published poetry of verse: both classic and traditional with a familiar phonetic sound, but even then she was unable to cage her vivacious personality. Her works were often mocking or satirical. She repeatedly wrote of the “duties” and everyday lives of women, betraying the whole scenario in dotting and exaggerated language in order to portray it as twisted or ridiculous. However, her jousting compositions may have been too subtle for some, as many critics find her work ardently religious rather than derisive. Born on November 29, 1832 in Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Louis May Alcott lived through a turbulent time for women, due to the event of the civil war, many women took on roles and occupation within their households and towns that had formerly been left to men. In her later life the suffrage began in the United in around 1872 Kingdom and went on around the world for decades to follow until much of the western world allowed women to vote. A firm advocate for Women’s rights and independence throughout her life, Alcott remained unmarried throughout her life. Her acclaimed novels “Little Women”, “Little Men”, and “Jo’s Boys” were all based on the actual lives of her and her three sisters, and their own mother who indeed often had to care for support the family by herself. Louisa May Alcott’s life was one never lived to please others and if you should like to delve deeper into its intricacies another analysis of her work is linked below and includes a more comprehensive(but still brief) study of her life.\n\nThe organization of “To the One Who Teaches Me” is ever so delicate and polite, perfectly simple and with darling rhyme scheme. A mere quatrain composed of four, seven syllable lines in trochaic meter( stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable) “To the One Who Teaches Me” closely resembles a nursery rhyme in many phonetic and visual ways. A beautiful little ditty with classic and traditional ABAB rhyme scheme, it commands our attention is the brevity of its verse making the poem both distinctive and facilely memorable. A plain and straightforward piece, “To the One Who Teaches Me” is nonetheless a charismatic and eloquent little work.\n\nLouisa May Alcott’s words are elementary in their familiar nature and ease of expression, giving her poem a nursery-rhyme like quality. Alcott’s lady-like prose is both charming and playful in a civilized manner. Honest and open enough to appeal to children, “To the One Who Teaches Me” is an ode to those who, with great patience guide and shape the growing generations. Presented in a straight-forward format that appeals to the unbiased mindset of youth, this poem acts as a lesson all the while honoring those who work for it’s instruction. This, however is only one possible translation of this poem, it is equally likely that this poem was intended as a impudent prod at all those who attempt to confine women( or people in general) to a pre-determined role. “To one who teaches me,” this is intended not for a guide, as you might say but a lecturer one who believes they know what's best for everyone, they do not teach but impose upon others their beliefs as though they were fact. “The sweetness and the beauty,” they might phrase it as though it should be an activity to be taken joy in, when it is truly nothing of the sort. The last two lines: “Of doing faithfully and cheerfully my duty” show how they instruct it must be done as though they are privileged to take part in it. This translation of the “To the One Who Teaches Me” is both arrant and comic, a little wild and daringly humorous, whether you take Alcott’s poem as a gentile lesson is etiquette or a rambunctious joust at society it is little ironically laughable and rather eloquently written either way.\n\nLouisa May Alcott’s short verse is concise, clever and instructional, but also clear and pleasantly cadenced with plain and simple rhyme scheme. The basic arrangement is sure to appeal to all ages from the old and withered to the young and buoyant, with it’s consistent syllabic form, and sounds make it an especially popular tune to be read among children. It’s meaning is clear and uncomplicated, and this is what it so suspicious, maybe it isn’t a sweet, pithy lesson intended for children, but an audacious and sarcastic ode to freedom. Cordial and brief, whether it is taken literally or satirically, “To the One Who Teaches Me” may not be deep or intensely passionate, but perhaps Louisa May Alcott has discovered that poetry need to be bursting with allegories to be meaningful. Sometimes the simplest answers are the sweetest.\n\nMarie-Denise Villers's iconic self-portrait, entitled \"Young Woman Drawing\" from 1801 it is displayed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This painting is probably the first widely known self-portrait by a female artist.\n\nThe cover of an early anthology of Adelaide Crapsey's poems.\n\n\"On Seeing Weather Beaten Trees\"\n\nAdelaide Crapsey\n\n​\n\nIs it as plainly in our living shown,\n\nBy slant and twist,\n\n​which way the wind has blown?\n\nAdelaide Crapsey, born on September 9, 1878, in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, United States is often thought as a troubled and immensely talented soul for the harsh realities of her own life, which she portrays so eloquently in her writing. She dealt with dark and morbid themes, part of her harnessing an element of the bittersweet embrace of life, with all the astuteness of the oriental Masters from whom she toke so much inspiration(especially the Japanese haiku and tanka). Crapsey was regarded as the creator of the Cinquain, for experimentation in the combining eastern and western literary styles. The beauty this somber collaboration creates is utterly unique and unlike anything the literary world had seen before: the five unrhymed lines of the Cinquain followed strict accentual-syllabic requirements. These lines consisted of first two, then four, then six, eight, and two syllables (or accents), subsequently. Another, similarity between Crapsey’s arrangement and that of the Japanese Haiku is Crapsey’s modified version of the “break”, or the Japanese’s abrupt revelation of the truth, Crapsey’s version is a variety of simultaneous usage of overlapping ideas. Crapsey’s admiration of the Asian writing styles was very similar to that of Ezra Pound, both appreciated the pithy metrical schemes and ceremonial image. Adelaide Crapsey’s life was tainted by the morbid knowledge that it was to be cut prematurely short by her diagnosis with tuberculosis of the brain lining in 1911 at the age of 23, she kept this discovery to herself and revelation ate her alive. Adelaide Crapsey died far too young at the age of 36, writing till the end, even from her sickroom in a sanatorium at Saranac Lake, New York. Adelaide Crapsey’s life was like her writing, brief, brilliant and tainted with lingering, but realistic agony.\n\nIf you wish to read more about her other aspects of her life are covered in the analysis of her poem, November Nights linked below.\n\nConcise and deeply methodical, Adelaide Crapsey’s “On Seeing Weather Beaten Trees” is a masterful triumph of breviloquence and metaphorical psychology. Crapsey’s work is crafted flawlessly within the confines of twenty it is very similar to the Japanese poetic structure of the Senryu; often satirical or variantly humorous, the Senryu consists of only 17 moraes and deal with human foibles. However, even though Crapsey’s piece exceeds the syllabic limit by three moraes and contains a simple ABA rhyme scheme( an element which despite adding charm and cadence to a free verse would be near sacrilegious in a Senryu). Crapsey’s poetic style combines the simplicity and raw splendor of eastern prose with her western tongue; adopting the brevity of Japanese poetry and incorporating the popularity of natural themes with a metaphorical exploration of human nature. Nonetheless, “On Seeing Weather Beaten Trees” has a distinctly western blatancy and audible phonetic organization. The rhyme scheme is absurdly simple, beginning with the first line and skipping to the third in a classic ABA sequence. Though, it is not balanced in its use of affricates, Crapsey’s poem nonetheless carries an audible balance. Her ten-four-six fricative structure is undeniably effective. The end result of her astute wordsmithing is profoundly harmonic and poignant.\n\nEven without the aid of its deft poetic structure and clever rhythmic eloquence, Crapsey’s work would be a victory in it’s own right. Had her verse been written as a mundane sentence it would still carry a figurative magnitude behind it’s banal physicalities. Lying just beneath the surface of Crapsey’s compositions own symbolic allusion to life. Posing the essential question: “Does the life shape the man?” or “Does the man shape his life?”. It also ponders whether our appearance betrays the toils of our separate quests, begging the conundrum: can you make the measure of a man’s suffering from his outward presence of character alone? Is the way that life has treated us and our retaliations marked in the way we carry on breathing? Can human lives be analyzed in the same fashion as those of trees? Can the paths we have chosen be discerned from our present state, just as the way a trillions can tell us the direction in which the wind has blown? Well, there are many elements that factor into how appearance reveals more internal secrets. The leaves of a tree, can tell us about many aspects of the tree’s health, from the abundance of sunlight and water that year, to the availability of nutrients in the soils and changes in climate or temperature. Trees and people, both bare scars and hold the stories of each one. each being exists as a creative rendition of their past, the points in time that changed them evident in the knots in their bark and the wrinkles in their skin, by their greying hairs and crinkling leaves. Crapsey’s work please we ask what the anatomy of our own lives can tell us about how our own pasts have molded us.\n\nTruth can be found in the pondering go the query, for yes, the way the wind blows will impact the growth of a tree and yes, the event of our yesterdays will shape the outcomes of our tomorrows. But the winds trails have been predetermined by the jet streams we cannot control, buffering us in the same direction every season. The winters are colder, and the summer bring up breezes from the balmy gulf, there may be points in our live when the monsoons catch up with the us shifting the course of the gale. This cataclysm may bring heavy rains and the great reversal of our lives could summon a storm as orientations finally adjust. The direction in which we are blown is not determined by a solitary factor, for our choices vie for dominance in their influence over our lives. For a tree may choose to grow towards the sun, but it may just as well prefer the shade, plausibly better suited to life in the penumbra, where there is rich, dark foliage supported with an affluence of chlorophyll b, while those that grow in an area of more potent sunlight are blessed with higher levels of chlorophyll a, have a lighter coloration. An early freeze may the vivid quality of their colors and a lack of nutrients may leave them dull and brown. Additionally, the wind will never be the only element which manipulates the constrictions of a man or the growth of a tree. So, yes admittedly the angle of the wind will strain to craft the way a tree may grow, but the stronger the tree, the less palpable the impression will be and a truly resilient tree grow to be imperious to the gusts and eventually they will fail to make even the slightest permutation in its bearing. The myriad of contributing factors that aid in the development of a being whether they are human or topiary is so varied and vast that we cannot begin to expect to be shown to be shown the route of a life by a single component. So, yes the wind, and turmoils we face everyday will weather away at us and we will continue to show the signs. But, should we point our faces toward the sun, you might find the blemishes of the years fading away.\n\n“On Seeing Weather Beaten Trees” is an absorbing piece of literature even if it is little in length.

Born in Amherst, Massachusetts on December 10, 1830, Emily Dickinson left school early as teenager to live a reclusive life with her family, as she grew older Emily only continued to seclude herself with to greater extents. Yet, the solitude Dickinson sought was never a detriment to her understanding of human nature or world issues and has only added to enigma of her brilliance. A women of words: both bold and lonely, Dickinson lived in seclusion for reasons both compassionate(her ailing mother) and selfish( her own personal delicate condition, including depression, anxiety and agoraphobia). Her largely private life, has left us only with snippets of what seems to be a ardent and thoughtful existence, it’s limited availability only making what we do know all the more poignant and fascinating. If you wish to delve in Emily Dickinson’s enthralling and melancholy life, please see her other poems linked below where it is explored in greater detail.\n\nA rumored portrait of a young Emily Dickinson, however is remains unconfirmed.\n\nThere is sound reasoning behind Emily Dickinson’s renown as one of the great poets of America. Her mastery is evident in her effortless command of the English language, like any talented writer she doesn’t explicitly need a rhyme to produce cadenced movement or a sense of regulation throughout her words. Her off and on slant rhyme though scattered and pattern-less nonetheless provides all the structure Dickinson requires. Rhyme schemes are often used as a method of organization and formation in poetry, while providing a more playful or humorous tone. “Hope” however was intended to be neither comical nor blithe, it’s tone has a far more refined quality than quaint rhyme could offer, it is filled instead with solemn optimism, combined with poise and aged insight. Yet, Dickinson does not allow her them to weigh down her composition, she is wholly aware of the sacrifices one makes in allowing poetry to become too heavy. The resulting loss of light-hearted charm and captivating subtly is all too familiar to the experienced writer. Dickinson shrewdly avoids this loss by keeping her language casual but with simultaneous sophistication in the perfect proportions just enough to intrigue all the while never deterring by sounding too winded or pretentious. To maintain her fluent and undemanding ambience, Dickinson adds an element of whimsy by adding a clever but nevertheless honest metaphor. In the act of comparing hope to something as inculpable and pure as a bird, Dickinson illustrates the miracle of such a fragile being putting itself continually into constant and unwavering dangerous situations, facing down storms on wings as precious and breakable as fine china. Dickinson’s incredible bird manages to not just survive but inspire joy and optimism in others with its melodious song. Dickinson’s zoo-morphically personified “Hope” is wholly altruistic acting always for the benefit of others, and never asking a crumb in return. It is this anomalous benevolence that enables hope to accomplish the incomparable on a daily basis all around the world, as well as assuring us that Emily Dickinson’s metaphor is impeccable.\n\nFour simple yet unique quatrains comprise Emily Dickinson’s “Hope”. Each one with a singular number of syllables and a rhyme scheme that is uncategorizable, her first poetic stanza has no rhyme scheme at all yet here she utilizes a slight aspect of repetition in the repeat of “And” also employing trochaic meter which gives her poem an audacious and bold flow, yet saps from it no grace or elegance. The words “soul” and “all” hint at slant rhyme, yet are too far apart phonetically to really be considered. The second stanza however rhymes quite regularly with a ABAB rhyme scheme “heard” and “bird”, “storm” and “warm”, reputation is again in “And” and “That” used to emphasize her extending metaphor by offsetting the beginning of each line. The last stanza introduces the poem’s speaker and a rather unusual rhyme scheme ABBB, in “land” than “sea” than “extremity” finishing with “me”, this ending serves to draw attention to the poems ubiquitous meaning and significance while giving it a sense of increasing speed and dramatic effect in it’s finale. Artfully construct with well employed artistic license, “Hope” is gorgeous and intricate poem both structurally and allegorically.\n\nEmily Dickinson’s metaphor is flawless in that once you have seen it through her eyes like a Rorschach inkblot it is impossible to see it any other way. The mark of a great metaphor is an innate, not just simplicity but almost kinship between the ideas being compared. Upon finishing “Hope” the reader cannot help but ask themselves: how could I not have seen that ‘hope’ has been a bird all along? It is only nature that she should be feminine: a songbird, a symbol of purity, delicacy, innocence and naive elation. The music of a songbird is wordless, and thus boundless, the bliss it brings is not hindered by language or culture. It’s universally beautiful. Yet, ‘hope’ is at her most spectacular when contrast against that darkness that should wish to destroy her; “ … sweetest in the gale…”. Only the most resentful and corrupted of souls could possibly intentionally harm something as childlike and genuine, as Dickson phrases it: “And sore must be the storm, That could abash the little bird”. This line doubles to allude to extraordinary resolve of Dickinson’s minuscule heroine. It is the miracle of not just her birth, but the entirety of this small bird’s existence that designates her as hope. If she had been a wolf or lion or bear or even an eagle, her feat would not have been quite so astonishing. The element of disbelief that comes from something so tiny accomplishing something so large, and being an emblem to so many( for she is there for everyone large and small, young and old, dull and clever) is what creates the brilliance and irresputible nature of Dickinson’s allusion. She presents a ‘hope’ that is omnipresent and non-existent, there for everyone and anyone concurrently. Her simple presence is one vast impossibility. And so it is Dickinson’s ability to capture this marvel that makes her writing so magical.\n\nEmily Dickinson is authentic and gifted, her writing is unambiguous and vaguely enigmatic. There is fluency and grace in abundance and she never fails to be a pleasure to read. Her style is one and candid, appealing to both adults and children, without ever sacrificing finesse or verisimilitude. Managing to embody light within something, that is as blatantly black and white as paper and ink is no small feat, yet with eloquence Emily Dickinson accomplishes deftly, thoroughly earning her place among the greatest female and American poets of all time.\n\nA touching photograph of Common House Martins in a snowstorm by Keith Williams titled \"Snowstorm Huddle\".\n\nA photographic portrait of young William Carlos Williams.\n\nAn all encompassing sketch of cats in all acts, both dignified and slightly shaming, titled \"Cats\" penned by Utagawa Hiroshige in 1890\n\nAbstract Tumblr art watercolor of multicolored cats in various poses.\n\nA candid photograph of older William Carlos Williams.\n\nBorn on the seventeenth of September, 1883 in Rutherford, New Jersey, William Carlos Williams is one of the most beloved and iconic of all American poets. Poetry has been Williams’s ambition ever since his time as a student at Horace Mann High School where he was inspired to become both a writer and a doctor. From High School Williams went on to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, from which he earned his Medical Doctors, and befriend the notable Modernist writer Ezra Pound. Williams continued to practice medicine through his life, working as physician practicing a mixture of pediatrics and general medicine. Though, he lived Rutherford Williams served as the chief of pediatric for the what was then known as Passaic General Hospital from 1924 until his death on March 4th, 1963, at the age of seventy-nine of a stroke, after suffering from a series of them since a heart attack in 1948. Williams is remembered by the Passaic General Hospital, with which he is so closely affiliated, by a tribute plaque upon which is engraved \"we walk the wards that Williams walked\" and it hangs to this day in the hall of what is now St. Mary’s General Hospital. After they met in University, Ezra Pound become a significant influence to Williams’s writing, and Pound was responsible for the second publication of Williams’s work, “The Tempers” in London. Both, Williams and Pound are often though of as some of the most prolific authors of the Imagist movement, however as he aged Williams began to develop views separate from those of Pound and especially T.S. Eliot, whose publication “The Waste Land,” greatly overshadowed his later works. Williams considered the Imagist poets to be growing too infatuated with European culture and traditions, causing them to begin losing sight of the future. Williams never let his consuming medical career keep him from writing and continued to experiment throughout his life, testing new techniques of meter and lineation. Williams sought to create something new and uniquely American in the literally world, a proud patriot and writer of the people, Williams themes softened consisted of day to day precedences of his own life and the lives of common people. During the 1920’s and 1930’s the popularity of Williams’s poetry continued to spread though slowly, due to the mass acclaim of other American Imagist poets especially Eliot. However, the 1950’s and 1960’s brought about a prominent revival of Williams’s work by the new generation of poets, aroused by Williams eagerness to teach and instruct, and the accessibility of his writing, some of blooming poets included Allen Ginsberg and the Beats. Williams is consider a unintentional member of the group of four major American writer born between 1874 and 1886, the association consisted of Robert Frost, who was born in 1874; Wallace Stevens, who was born in 1879; and Hilda \"H.D.\" Doolittle, who was born in 1886. Of the small company Williams lived the longest and lead a creatively rich life, first being published only in small magazines then evolving to generate productively poet, novelist, essayist, and playwright. Just as with his medical practice William Carlos Williams sustained his writing into his old age, publishing the major works Kora in Hell(1920), Spring and All (1923), Pictures from Brueghel and Other Poems (1962), the five-volume epic Paterson (1963, 1992), and Imaginations (1970).\n\n“As a Cat” is purely delightful in the simplicity of it’s candid illustration of feline distinction, William Carlos Williams crafts a poem that is both pithy and rich with intensity. The imagery he creates is both charmingly honest and cleanly readable, Williams description feels so real it is almost unbelievable that we are not experiencing the moment ourselves, or should I say, believable that we are indeed experiencing it ourselves. In it’s daring and inventive structure “As a Cat” captures the eccentricities and wonders that are the cat is all it’s grandeur, his brief give the impression of tentativeness and wisdom, sounding discreet and meticulous instead of jarring or juvenile. There is a pure mastery to this piece in the it’s deceivingly primitive appearance and sound, because beneath the modesty there is a complex presence, that if you let is wash over you and consume your senses without the restraints of premature or shallow judgements, the words transform, becoming infinitely complicated and meaningful. Short and subtly sassy William’s writing captures the ever elusive enigma that is the cat, and does so ingeniously.\n\nThe verse form William Carlos Williams has chosen is undefinable it is the this is the free verses held not by a single rhythmic constraint, it has all the liberation and independence of the cat he describes in it. There is no specific meter to William’s work, it is as singular and free as poetry can be. It’s structure is determined by the spontaneous whims of the phonetic style best fitting to the line in question. Without pattern, Williams provides flow. Without rhyme he has created rhythm. Two unique tercets, each individual in nature are followed by a sestet, and these mere line counts are the only categories that can be given to Williams’s free-wheeling verse, the slow is not slow but calculating and sagaciously hesitant, it is steady and graceful as any feline with a hint of solemn pride and sassy audacious.\n\nThe poem is strictly straight-forward, honest and lucid in its expression. Akin to an artful film short, it captures a brief moment in time, enclosing in its brevity all the beauty and meaning that can be extracted from a single instant and emphasizing them, bringing attention to all the details that define the seconds in question, moving beyond the “Still-life” style poetry that simply praises, Williams composes a moving picture that embodies the balance and articulation of the cat with his or her conscientious movements, shifting between lines with the adeptly precise movements of a cat. One cannot help but smile at the image of a cat cautiously slipping himself or herself into a flowerpot and candid realism which Williams uses to achieve this elementary yet astute composition is brilliant and seemingly effortless all at once, one could not imagine a better way to express the exclusive nature of at than through the rare nature of one particular free-verse poem, that Williams has so kindly achieved doing it glorious justice.\n\nThe magic of William Carlos Williams’s writing is it’s lucidity and clarity, it’s perfectly clear to the reader what his intentions are and the nature of the joy and beauty that he has transformed into words, his address is forthright and his presentation is transparent in it’s executed meaning. “As a Cat” is no more complex or more convoluted than it outwardly seems, it’s focus is solely on the cats and it’s movement works as a super-organism to bring depth and beauty to natural feline actions. William Carlos Williams does not add needless complexities to bring sophistication to his work he is well aware that the cat in its purity is the epitome of refinement and finesse. “As a Cat,” is a impeccable expression of feline elegance and it is a pleasure to pursue and is of course best accompanied by a warm dignified cat in one’s lap.\n\nGorgeous Floral batik artwork by the United Kingdom's batik artist Marina Elphick, a specialist at batik portraiture as well as other art forms."
