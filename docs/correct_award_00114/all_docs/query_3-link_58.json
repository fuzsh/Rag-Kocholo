        "text": "Irish poet and playwright William Butler Yeats, 58, has a brother, painter Jack, 52; and two sisters, Susan, 57, named after their mother, but always called “Lily,” and Elizabeth, 55, always called “Lolly.”\n\nLily and Lolly Yeats\n\nFor the past 15 years the sisters have run a business together, the Cuala Press; have lived together in Dundrum, South Dublin; and have hosted Thursday evening salons together, attracting a wide variety of local and national personalities.\n\nThey have also gotten on each other’s nerves together. Neither has been in good health.\n\nCuala Press produces quality hand-printed books, some written by their brother, but many by other writers.\n\nWillie’s wife Georgie, 31, helps Lily run the embroidery department of Cuala where they turn out beautiful linens and dresses for wealthy Irish women.\n\nLast summer, while on holiday in London, Lily developed tuberculosis. Willie arranged for her to enter this London nursing home. At the end of the year, when he received the Nobel Prize for Literature, her brother used the cash prize to extend Lily’s stay there, and Georgie has been taking care of organizing and paying the bills for her treatment.\n\nLily is forever grateful for this break from her usual life. She writes down on paper how she feels about her sister:\n\n“Life with her the past 20 years has been a torture…It is impossible ever to think of living with her again…And now there is hope. I want to thank Willie and Georgie for this ease of body and mind they have given me…Whether I recover or not while lying in bed I will get great happiness out of thinking that there can be a life for me of the freedom that I have all my life longed for.”\n\nLily decides not to send the letter.\n\nN. B.: Thanks to Phil Mason, author of Lady Gregory, A Galway Life, for her help with details in this posting.\n\n“Such Friends”: 100 Years Ago… is the basis for the paperback series, “Such Friends”: The Literary 1920s. Volumes I through IV, covering 1920 through 1923 are available at Thoor Ballylee in Co. Galway, and as signed copies at Pan Yan Bookstore in Tiffin, OH, City Books on the North Side and Riverstone Books in Squirrel Hill, Pittsburgh, PA. They are also on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk in print and e-book formats. For more information, email me at kaydee@gypsyteacher.com.\n\nLater this month I will be talking about early 20th century supporters of the arts at the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at Carnegie-Mellon University.\n\nIf you want to walk with me through Bloomsbury, you can download my audio walking tour, “Such Friends”: Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Group.\n\nManager as Muse, about Scribner’s editor Maxwell Perkins’ relationships with F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and Thomas Wolfe, is also available on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk in both print and e-book versions.\n\nIn Ireland, poet, playwright and co-founder of the Abbey Theatre, William Butler Yeats, 58, is still basking in the glow of his recently awarded Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nEach time he responds to a friend’s congratulatory message, he makes sure to include,\n\nI consider that this honor has come to me less as an individual than as a representative of Irish literature, it is part of Europe’s welcome to the Free State,”\n\nof which he is a Senator.\n\nThe night after the prize was announced—when he and his wife Georgie, 31, celebrated by cooking sausages—there was a posh dinner held at the Shelbourne Hotel in St. Stephen’s Green. The first cable of congratulations came from Yeats’ countryman living in Paris, James Joyce, 41.\n\nShelbourne Hotel\n\nWith the 115,000 Swedish Kroner from the prize, equal to more than £6,000, Yeats is able to help out his sister Lily, 57, who had been admitted to a north London nursing home last summer. Willie’s American friend, lawyer and supporter of the arts John Quinn, 53, had advised him to use the money this way. However, Quinn also strongly advised Yeats to move Lily out of unhealthy London, and not to donate the money or use it to pay off any debt:\n\nProperly invested in good American securities [it] would bring you in 8 % income or $3,200 a year. You ought not to touch the principal under any circumstances.”\n\nYeats appreciates the advice. But after he has Lily taken care of, he is going to pay off his debts. And those of his father, who died early last year.\n\n*****\n\nIn England, the Hogarth Press, operated by Virginia, 41, and Leonard Woolf, 43, has been growing well.\n\nThis past year they published 11 titles; five of those were hand-printed on fine paper using their Minerva treadle platen press. That is the largest number they have ever hand-printed in one year, and they will probably not produce that many next year. The Woolfs are primarily interested in publishing books with outstanding content, not works of art that people only look at and admire.\n\nThis holiday they are at their country home, Monk’s House in East Sussex. Just about 10 miles away, at Charleston Farmhouse, Virginia’s sister, painter Vanessa Bell, 44, is spending the holiday with her children—Julian, 15, Quentin, 13, and Angelica, just turned five—and, oddly enough, her husband, art critic Clive Bell, 42. The kids have created a special issue of their Charleston Bulletin, featuring, “A life of Vanessa Bell dictated by Virginia Woolf, pictures and spelling by Quentin Bell.”\n\nCharleston Bulletin, Christmas\n\nAngelica’s father, the painter Duncan Grant, 38, is spending the holidays with his parents.\n\nAt midnight on New Year’s Eve, the new radio service, the British Broadcasting Corporation, broadcasts the chimes of Big Ben for the first time.\n\n*****\n\nIn France, American ex-pat writer Gertrude Stein, 49, and her partner Alice B. Toklas, 46, are pleased that Gertrude’s work has been published more this past year.\n\nShe was included in the “Exiles” issue of the American literary magazine, The Little Review, which finally came out this fall. But Gertrude did notice that first place in that issue was given to the young Ernest Hemingway, 24, whom she considers to be one of her proteges. She even agreed to write a review of his Three Stories & Ten Poems, something she never does.\n\nThree Stories & Ten Poems by Ernest Hemingway\n\nGertrude and Alice receive letters regularly from Hemingway, who is in Toronto where he and his wife went for the birth of their first child in October.\n\nIt is clear that the Hemingways are really hating being away from Paris, and he has written to Stein and Toklas that\n\nIt was a bad move to come back.”\n\nErnie asked for tips on where to live in Paris when they return early in the new year.\n\n*****\n\nIn America, New York World columnist Heywood Broun, 35, and his wife, journalist Ruth Hale, 36, are throwing their annual New Year’s Eve bash at their brownstone on West 85th Street.\n\nThey invite all the literary friends they lunch with regularly at the Algonquin Hotel in midtown: free-lance writer Dorothy Parker, 30; magazine illustrator Neysa McMein, 35; novelist Edna Ferber, 38; fellow World columnist Franklin Pierce Adams, (FPA) 42.\n\nNeysa McMein, left, in her studio with a model\n\nThanks to her association with the “Round Table,” Neysa recently made it into the papers for her Christmas project delivering toys and turkeys to families on the Lower East Side. She convinced her successful friends, including composer and Broadway producer Irving Berlin, 35, and World editor Herbert Bayard Swope, 41, to donate chauffeured limos to the cause.\n\nFerber sent her most recent novel, originally called Selina, but changed to So Big, off to her publisher with trepidation a few weeks ago. He wrote back immediately that it was so good he had cried while reading it! It’s going to be serialized in the Woman’s Home Companion.\n\nFPA has been confiding in Edna for months that he is thinking of divorcing his wife. In his column he has even admitted that he was “as low-hearted as ever I was in my life.”\n\nTonight, he seems to Ferber to be downright giddy and boyish, not feeling guilty at all about the affair he’s been having with English socialite Esther Root, 29. Ferber tells FPA that in his tuxedo he looks as though he is a young boy who has just been confirmed.\n\nI am a confirmed admirer of you,”\n\nhe tells her.\n\nThis year Broun and Hale have put their five-year-old son Heywood Hale Broun—“Woody”—in charge of the punch bowl, filled with Orange Blossoms–equal parts gin and orange juice with powdered sugar thrown in.\n\nOrange Blossom Cocktail\n\n“Such Friends”: 100 Years Ago… is the basis for the paperback series, “Such Friends”: The Literary 1920s.

For more information, email me at kaydee@gypsyteacher.com.\n\nEarly in the new year I will be talking about the literary summer of 1923 at the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at the University of Pittsburgh, and early 20th century patrons of the arts in the Osher program at Carnegie-Mellon University.\n\nManager as Muse, about Scribner’s editor Maxwell Perkins’ relationships with Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Thomas Wolfe, is also available on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk in both print and e-book versions.\n\nIf you want to walk with me through Bloomsbury, you can download my audio walking tour, “Such Friends”: Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Group.\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats, 58, poet, playwright, and now Nobel laureate, is about to take the stage to give his Nobel lecture on “The Irish Theatre.”\n\nNobel Prize medal\n\nYeats feels confident about the speech. Last month, two days after the prize was announced, he gave a talk on the same topic to the Elizabethan Literature and Debating Society of Trinity College at the Café Ritz on Grafton Street. A friend of his sisters’ had asked him to address the young women—who formed the group because none of the university’s debating societies would allow women members—and it was a good opportunity to try out his lecture.\n\nGrafton Street\n\nYeats gave full credit to his friends in the Irish dramatic movement, who contributed to the founding of the Abbey Theatre. For example, Douglas Hyde, 63, and his Gaelic League; Edward Martyn, who recently died, and his generous funding. The late playwright John Millington Synge and of course, Lady Augusta Gregory, 71, who is still running the Abbey.\n\nAugusta did object to one line in the speech. Where he said that two forms should have stood on either side of him to accept—”an old woman, Lady Gregory, sinking into the infirmity of age, and the ghost of a young man, John Millington Synge…”—she had asked that he change “old” to “living,” and he obliged. Although too late to change the version which appeared in the newspapers.\n\nSince arriving in Stockholm last week, Yeats and his wife Georgie, 31, have been learning about Swedish culture and enjoying the formalities of the celebrations. The King bestowed the diplomas and medals on the recipients on Monday, and this coming Saturday there will be a performance of Yeats’ play, written with Lady Gregory, Cathleen ni Houlihan. He is looking forward to seeing the differences between the Irish and Swedish theatre companies’ interpretations.\n\nYeats arriving in Stockholm\n\nIn his speech, Yeats will decry the violence that his country has experienced in the past 10 years, including a successful fight for independence followed by a civil war, as well as the obstacles he and his friends had to overcome to establish a national theatre like the Abbey.\n\nIn this version, Yeats is planning to end by saying that he had “seen little in this last week that would not have been memorable and exciting to Synge and to Lady Gregory, for Sweden has achieved more than we have hoped for our own country.”\n\n“Such Friends”: 100 Years Ago… is the basis for the paperback series, “Such Friends”: The Literary 1920s.

Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and Thomas Wolfe, is also available on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk in both print and e-book versions.\n\nIrish poet William Butler Yeats, 57, is having dinner with his doctor—and friend—fellow writer and fellow appointed Senator in the new Irish Free State, Oliver St. John Gogarty, 44.\n\n107 Piccadilly, London\n\nGogarty is re-telling the story of his recent kidnapping in Dublin by anti-government Republicans who had publicly stated they were going to be targeting Senators.\n\nThe good doctor was sitting in the bath in his Chapelizod home when the armed gunmen broke in and led him outside at gunpoint. As they forced him into a car, one pushed a revolver into his back and said,\n\nIsn’t it a good thing to die in a flash, Senator?”\n\nNot wanting to die in any way, Gogarty told them that he urgently needed to relieve his bowels and scampered into the woods. And then jumped into the freezing cold River Liffey and swam away.\n\nAs he crawled ashore and headed to the police barracks in the Phoenix Park, Gogarty vowed that he would donate two swans to the Liffey in gratitude.\n\nAnd he vowed he would move his medical practice and his family to London.\n\nOliver St. John Gogarty\n\nThis month, the same rebels burned to the ground Renvyle, Gogarty’s house in Connemara in the west of Ireland. And even a patriot like Senator Horace Plunkett, 68, is not safe—his house Kilteragh, in Foxrock, County Dublin, was reduced to ruins also.\n\nFiremen hosing what’s left of Kilteragh\n\nYeats has been following the turmoil back home from the comfort of his club here. The London Times’ headline a few weeks ago read,\n\nIrish Rebel Outrages. Many Houses Burned. Kidnapped Senator.”\n\nThe anti-Treaty forces also burned Moore Hall, the family home of Yeats’ former friend, playwright and novelist George Moore, about to turn 71. They were enacting revenge on George’s brother, a former British army officer and current Free State Senator, not knowing the house belongs to George the writer, not his more political brother.\n\nGeorge Moore’s letter to the editor in The Morning Post\n\nYeats and Moore were among those who founded the Abbey Theatre at the beginning of the century. Despite the ongoing Civil War, the Abbey keeps performing in the heart of Dublin. They are staging Cathleen ni Houlihan, by Yeats and co-founder Lady Augusta Gregory, 70, featuring the new actor Barry Fitzgerald, 34, on a double bill with The Shewing Up of Blanco Posnet by Yeats’ fellow Dub, George Bernard Shaw, 66.\n\nYeats is enjoying his new role as a Senator, representing a small independent political party, and serving on committees dealing with issues related to arts and culture. Leinster House is a short walk from the Yeats home in Merrion Square.\n\nLeinster House\n\nHe’s given two speeches so far but feels that he can serve his country better from here in London, putting pressure on old friends like Winston Churchill, 48, former Secretary of State for the Colonies, to ease up on some of the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty that was negotiated last year. Also, he finds it easier to write here.\n\nGogarty is urging Willie to get his family out of harm’s way in Ireland and bring them to England. The shock of the fighting in Dublin could affect his young daughter’s kidneys.\n\nYeats has been thinking about re-locating his wife and two children to Holyhead, Wales, where he could conveniently commute to Dublin via the ferry. His mother-in-law wants them to move closer to her in Cheshire, England.\n\nBut Yeats’ wife Georgie, 30, says no. She thinks this ridiculous war is going to be over soon. The government has already offered amnesty to those fighting, which will cool things down a bit.\n\nWillie has just received a heartfelt letter from her, shaming him for appearing to abandon his needy country at this time. Their daughter Anne, about to turn 4, has recently recovered from scarlet fever and is doing much better now. (Yeats admits that whenever one of the kids gets sick, he moves out of the house to his Kildare Street club. To make things easier for Georgie, of course.)\n\nHer letter convinces him. Willie responds immediately, thanking her for putting pressure on him. There will be no more talk of abandoning Ireland. He’ll come home.\n\nYeats family home in Merrion Square\n\n“Such Friends”: 100 Years Ago… is the basis for the series, “Such Friends”: The Literary 1920s.

Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and Thomas Wolfe, is also available on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk in both print and e-book versions.\n\nGeorgie Yeats, 29, is relieved to be settling into her new home in Merrion Square, Dublin, with her family—her husband, poet William Butler Yeats, 57, and their two children, Anne, 3, and Michael, 13 months.\n\nShe bought this posh row house just a few months ago, with her own family money. But they have been living out in the west of Ireland, in the tower Willie bought and named Thoor Ballylee.\n\nWillie has been optimistic about how the newly independent Irish Free State is progressing. Despite the ongoing civil war, the Parliament elected in June has taken their seats and chosen W. T. Cosgrave, 42, as their President.\n\nHowever, at the beginning of this month Republican soldiers came to the door of Thoor Ballylee and told Georgie that they were going to blow up the bridge over the stream that runs by the tower. She should move the family upstairs. Big of them to give notice.\n\nThey ignited the fuses; a Republican told her there would be two explosions. She writes to a friend:\n\nAfter two minutes, two roars came & then a hail of falling masonry & gravel & then the same man shouted up ‘All right now’ & cleared off.”\n\nNo one was injured. When the Yeats family left for Dublin the stream had poured two feet of water in the downstairs dining room.\n\nThoor Ballylee flooded\n\n*****\n\nAs she got off the train at Great Neck, Long Island, Zelda Fitzgerald, 22, carrying her daughter Scottie, 11 months, took one look at the nanny that her husband, hit novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald, just turned 26, had hired—and fired her.\n\nScott and Zelda have recently rented a house in this suburb, only a 45-minute drive from Manhattan, and, while Zelda went back to St. Paul, Minnesota, to pick up Scottie from Fitzgerald’s parents, Scott had botched things up as usual.\n\nScottie and Zelda Fitzgerald\n\nThey had come back to New York at the beginning of the month to start a life with less booze and more work on Scott’s next novel and a play he’s writing. But they made the mistake of staying in their favorite place for partying, the Plaza Hotel, and the partying came back too.\n\nA few weeks ago, Scott invited his old Princeton University buddy, critic and managing editor of Vanity Fair, Edmund “Bunny” Wilson, 27, over to the Plaza for an impromptu lunch—lobster croquettes and top shelf illegal liquor. Also joining them were novelists John Dos Passos, 26, and Sherwood Anderson, 46, who was looking a bit scruffy. The bootlegger’s bartender mixed Bronx cocktails (gin, vermouth and orange juice) and the men sat around drinking and whining about how their publishers didn’t promote their books enough.\n\nDos Passos and Zelda started teasing each other and Anderson, who had only come to be polite, left early.\n\nJohn Dos Passos\n\nScott mentioned that, now that he had published two successful novels and just brought out his second short story collection, Tales of the Jazz Age, he and Zelda had decided to rent a house out on Long Island where they could raise their daughter.\n\nSo the slightly tipsy Fitzgeralds and Dos Passos got in a chauffeured red touring car and took off to meet up with a real estate agent in Great Neck. None of the houses interested them so they decided to pay a call on their friend, humor writer Ring Lardner, 37, at his home on East Shore Road looking out over Manhasset Bay.\n\nRing was already drunker than they were, so after only a few more drinks the group headed back to the Plaza. Zelda insisted on stopping at an amusement park along the way so she could ride the Ferris Wheel, and Scott stayed in the car drinking from a bottle that he had hidden there. Dos Passos decided his new friends were going to have a hard time adjusting to strictly domestic life.\n\nAfter several other house-hunting trips, the Fitzgeralds finally found this lovely home at 6 Gateway Drive, in the leafy confines of Great Neck Estates: A circular driveway; red-tiled roof; great big pine tree in the front yard; and a room above the garage where Scott can write in peace.\n\n6 Gateway Drive, Great Neck\n\nZelda took off to retrieve Scottie in St. Paul, leaving Fitzgerald to hire servants and a baby nurse. He sure has screwed that up.\n\nDespite his recent writing success, and encouragement from his publisher, Scott really isn’t making enough to afford the rent, the servants, the laundress, the nurse, the country club, the theatre tickets, the restaurant bills, and the Rolls Royce (second hand) that living in Great Neck requires.\n\nZelda doesn’t care. The finances are his problem.\n\n“Such Friends”: 100 Years Ago… is the basis for the series, “Such Friends”: The Literary 1920s.

He has just sent off to his publisher the second volume of his Autobiographies, titled The Trembling of the Veil. His father, the painter John Butler Yeats, died about four months ago at age 83, in New York City. Willie and his sisters are thinking of bringing out a volume of their father’s memoirs.\n\nHis friend and mentor, Lady Augusta Gregory, 70, has been at her home, Coole Park, about four miles down the road from Thoor Ballylee, working on her own memoirs about their days founding The Abbey Theatre together. She’s been reading out sections to Willie and incorporating many of his suggestions. Their writing styles are very different—Augusta is trying to remain objective; Yeats favors a more impressionistic interpretation.\n\nCoole Park, drawing by W. B. Yeats\n\nNow that The Trembling of the Veil is completed, today Willie is writing to his friend in New York, the Irish-American lawyer and patron of the arts, John Quinn, 52.\n\nHe brings Quinn up to date on the family living arrangements and tells him that his godson, Michael, now has eight teeth! Anne has invented her own version of The Lord’s Prayer, which includes, “Father not in heaven—father in the study,” and “Thine is the Kitten, the Power, and the Glory.”\n\nW. B. and Georgie Yeats\n\nQuinn had expressed his concern about how Ireland’s political turmoil is impacting the west of the country. Yeats assures him that there hasn’t been much trouble here:\n\nThere was what seemed a raid at Coole, men came and shouted at night and demanded to be let in, and then went away either because the moon came out or because they only meant to threaten.”\n\nMost importantly, Willie wants his friend’s permission to dedicate his latest volume to Quinn.\n\nIf you violently object you must cable…for [Werner Laurie, the publisher] is in a devil of a hurry.”\n\nThe dedication reads,\n\nTo John Quinn my friend and helper and friend and helper of certain people mentioned in this book.”\n\n“Such Friends”: 100 Years Ago… is the basis for the series, “Such Friends”: The Literary 1920s.

Georgie and her husband, Irish poet and playwright William Butler Yeats, 56, have decided it is time to leave Oxford, where they have lived for the past few years, and move their two young children back home to Dublin.\n\nThanks to depressed housing prices in the city and Georgie’s shrewdness in lining up tenants for the top floor of their new house, they will be able to afford the move.\n\n*****\n\nBack in Oxford, Georgie’s husband, Willie, is impressed with his wife’s real estate skills. He never thought he’d ever be able to afford to live in posh Merrion Square, birthplace of the Duke of Wellington and, in Yeats’ mind, the Dublin equivalent of London’s posh Berkeley Square.\n\nBroad Street, Oxford\n\nAlso, his father, the painter John Butler “JB” Yeats, died at the beginning of the month, aged 82, in New York City where he had been living for the past 15 years. Willie and Georgie had been supporting his Dad financially, and it’s been a bit of stretch for them.\n\nThe letters JB wrote to his family in the weeks before his death are still arriving.\n\n“Such Friends”: 100 Years Ago… is the basis for the series, “Such Friends”: The Literary 1920s.

You can register for this free event, or sign up to watch it via Zoom, here.\n\nAt the end of the month I will be talking about the centenary of the publication of James Joyce’s Ulysses at the Osher Lifelong Learning program at Carnegie-Mellon University.\n\nIf you want to walk with me through Bloomsbury, you can download my audio walking tour, “Such Friends”: Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Group.\n\nManager as Muse, about Scribner’s editor Maxwell Perkins’ relationships with Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Thomas Wolfe, is also available on Amazon in both print and e-book versions.\n\nAt the end of the second year of the 1920s…\n\nIn Ireland, at Dublin’s Abbey Theatre, still run by one of its founders, Lady Augusta Gregory, 69, the company is finishing up, with a matinee and evening performance today, the run of a double bill including A Pot of Broth by one of its other founders, Irish poet William Butler Yeats, 56. The Abbey has been performing this little one act about gullible peasants since it was written over 15 years ago.\n\nThroughout the country, violent atrocities are committed by the Irish Republican Army and the British Black and Tans, while in Dublin, in a huge leap forward for Irish independence, the government of the Irish Free State is finally coming into being.\n\nNewspaper headline, December 8\n\n*****\n\nIn England, near Oxford, Yeats is encouraged by the news of the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, giving Ireland, including 26 of the island’s 32 counties, Dominion status in the British Commonwealth. He writes to a friend that he expects the Irish parliament, the Dail, will ratify the treaty, but\n\nI see no hope of escape from bitterness, and the extreme party may carry the country.”\n\nWith the establishment of the Irish Free State, Yeats and his wife Georgie, 29, are thinking of moving back to Dublin in the new year with their two children, Anne, 2 ½, and the recently christened Michael Butler Yeats, four months old.\n\nIn Sussex, Virginia, 39, and her husband Leonard Woolf, 41, have come to their country home, Monk’s House, for the holidays.\n\nThe Hogarth Press, the publishing company they have operated out of their home in the Richmond section of London for the past four years, is steadily growing. In total they published six titles this year, a 50% increase over last.\n\nA book of woodcuts by a friend of theirs, Roger Fry, 55, that they brought out just a few months ago is going in to its third printing.\n\nThey have hired an assistant, Ralph Partridge, 27, who was at first helpful. Now he works in the basement, sleeps over during the week and has a bad habit of leaving the press and metal type dirty, which drives Leonard crazy. Partridge’s profit-sharing deal has increased from last year, but is only £125.\n\nBefore they came down here to ring in the new year, the Woolfs had a visit from their friend, one of their former best-selling writers, Katherine Mansfield, 33. They discussed excerpts from a new work, Ulysses, by Irish novelist James Joyce, 39, to be published in Paris in a few months. Mansfield agrees that it is disgusting, but she still found some scenes that she feels will one day be deemed important.\n\nKatherine Mansfield\n\nAbout three years ago, Virginia and Leonard were approached about publishing Ulysses, but they rejected it. They don’t regret their decision.\n\n*****\n\nIn France, Paris has become home to over 6,000 Americans, enjoying being let out of the prison of Prohibition back home.\n\nWriter Gertrude Stein, 47, who has lived here for almost 20 years, has been laid up recently after minor surgery. She is still writing, working on Didn’t Nelly & Lilly Love You, which includes references to her birthplace, Allegheny, Pennsylvania, and that of her partner for the past 14 years, Alice B. Toklas, 44, Oakland, California, and how the two of them met in Paris.\n\nThe author at Gertrude Stein’s house in Allegheny, Pennsylvania\n\nBecause she recently visited the nearby studio of another American ex-pat, painter and photographer Man Ray, 31, who just moved here last summer, Gertrude works into the piece “a description of Mr. Man Ray.“\n\n*****\n\nIn America, New York free-lance writer Dorothy Parker, 28, is attending, as usual, the New Year’s Eve party hosted by two of her friends from lunches at the Algonquin Hotel—New York World columnist Heywood Broun, 33, and his wife, journalist Ruth Hale, 34. Their party is an annual event, but bigger than ever this year because it is being held in their newly purchased brownstone at 333 West 85th Street.\n\nParker notes that they are directly across the street from one of the buildings that she lived in with her father.\n\nBuilding across the street from the Brouns’ brownstone\n\nDottie is here alone. Her friends don’t expect her husband, stockbroker and war veteran Eddie Pond Parker, 28, to be with her. They joke that she keeps him in a broom closet back home.\n\nShe’s enjoying talking to one of her other lunch buddies, top New York Tribune columnist Franklin Pierce Adams [always known as FPA], 40, who is professing his undying love for Parker. While sitting next to his wife and keeping an eye on a pretty young actress in a pink dress.\n\nAll the furniture except for some folding chairs has been removed to make room for the 200 guests and a huge vat of orange blossoms [equal parts gin and orange juice, with powdered sugar thrown in]. No food or music. Just illegal booze.\n\nAs the turn of the new year approaches, the guests join the hosts in one of their favorite traditions. Dottie and the others each stand on a chair.\n\nAt the stroke of midnight they jump off, into the unknown of 1922.\n\nThanks to Neil Weatherall, author of the play, The Passion of the Playboy Riots, for help in unravelling Irish history.\n\n“Such Friends”: 100 Years Ago… is the basis for the series, “Such Friends”: The Literary 1920s.

We will be chronicling what was happening in 1922 right here…\n\nPoet, playwright and new dad William Butler Yeats, 56, is writing to his friend in New York City, art collector John Quinn, 51. Yeats and his wife, Georgie, 28, have just returned from taking their baby son, Michael Butler, one month old, to Dublin for an operation. All went well, however, Michael might need more surgery, in London, next month.\n\nBut the Yeatses arrived home to find out that, once again, his father, painter John Butler Yeats, 82, has cancelled his booking to sail back home to his family in Ireland. This time he blamed it on some recent sickness.\n\nW. B. Yeats by J. B. Yeats\n\nBoth Willie and Quinn have virtually ordered JB to come home. Quinn is resenting taking care of the older man, and Yeats has told his father point blank that, with his growing family, he can no longer afford to his support Dad’s American lifestyle.\n\nQuinn has booked JB, once again, to sail in November and has put down a deposit.\n\n“Such Friends”: 100 Years Ago… is the basis for the series, “Such Friends”: The Literary 1920s.

Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and Thomas Wolfe, is available on Amazon in both print and e-book versions.\n\nIt’s a boy!\n\nIrish poet and playwright William Butler Yeats, 56, and his wife Georgie, 28, are over the moon about the birth of their second child, Michael Butler Yeats, now three days old.\n\nW. B. and Georgie Yeats\n\nWillie had cabled his father, painter John Butler Yeats, 82, and their friend, Irish-American lawyer John Quinn, 51, both in New York City, as soon as he knew Michael and Georgie were okay. He doesn’t mention the baby’s name because he knows his Dad will be disappointed that the newest Yeats isn’t named for him.\n\nToday he is writing to Quinn that his son is “better looking than a newborn canary.” And that he thinks his daughter, Anne, 2, is flirting with him.\n\nBefore Michael’s birth, Georgie’s doctor had warned Willie that not all babies are as well behaved as their first, Anne. But the new Dad is so thrilled that it’s a boy, he is not worried about any future behavior problems. He’s just glad everyone is healthy.\n\nDownstairs in their big house, Georgie is ushering in an “electrician”—actually a doctor. She has sworn the staff to secrecy about Michael’s illness so Willie won’t worry. She hopes he doesn’t notice the maid who is crying.\n\nSpoiler alert: Michael overcame his illness and lived to a ripe old age. I met him in 2004.\n\n“Such Friends”: 100 Years Ago… is the basis for the series, “Such Friends”: The Literary 1920s. Volume I, covering 1920, is available in both print and e-book formats on Amazon.
