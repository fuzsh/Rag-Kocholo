        "text": "October 29, 2018\n\nPoetry would sound so much better in an (probably drunken) Irish lilt.\n\nMy first major exposure to Yeats was wonderful. But by the same token, limited. Reading the notes in the back of this collection of poems and plays (I skipped the plays, they didn't appeal), makes me realize that my affinity for poetry is more primal and base than the \"professional\" critic. I prefer poems and lines that punch me in the gut. And many times Yeats does this to full effect. I'm less concerned with the \"analysis\" of poetry than with its impact.\n\nWith that comes a full confession....I DESPISE Instagram poets (J iron Word, Atticus, et al.) You know what I mean. Uniformly male. Uniformly \"empowering\" to women. And utterly banal. There are a thousand \"I am the storm\" poems and poets floating out there for women to double-tap but they are just so very specious and self-affirming to be utterly worthless. Give me poetry that makes me REGRET. That makes me SIGH. That makes me YEARN, then we're talking. Don't blow smoke up my ass and call it inspiration.\n\nYeats does this very well. Especially in his earlier poems. Maybe that's a function of youth (though I personally think the most impactful poems are those produced when the poet has moved past that phase). But nevertheless, Yeats writes of passion, regret, and unrequited love like no other. It's wonderful.\n\nMy critiques are exclusively Anglocentric. I'm too damn 'MURICAN to feel much for his poems focused on Irish myth/folklore or Irish independence. They're perfectly fine to read, but they left me cold because I was unable to relate. That's mostly a failing of mine, I recognize.\n\nOverall, a wonderful collection.\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\nOh Yeats, Oh Yeats,\n\nYour words poured into my head\n\nAs water through a sieve;\n\nYou bade Swift undead,\n\nMourned Ireland's plight,\n\nAnd waited the soul's reprieve.\n\nBut neither verse nor play\n\nCould hold my weary eye.\n\nSo get thee behind me,\n\nUpon the shelf I send you back;\n\nGet thee behind me,\n\nThere are other books to crack.\n\nJanuary 4, 2022\n\nFor the past several years I've had various books of poetry sitting by my chair that I usually read a poem or two from late in the evening. It's a habit I've gotten into that seems to ease any tensions from the day. I've just recently been adding them to my Goodreads list as I complete them. I think the reason I hadn't up to now is that I really don't know what to say, just that I like them or I don't. I just don't have the intellect to properly analyze them. Anyway, this is one I completed last night. It's a reread that I first read, probably, twenty years ago. My favorite poem in the book is \"The Song of the Old Mother\" written in 1894 about a mothers work. Other poems that stood out to me \"A Man Young and Old\" and \"All Things Can Tempt Me\" but there are many others that I could list. Yeats poetry definitely has a feel for the period they were written in but are still marvelous.\n\nAugust 3, 2021\n\nThere’s no doubt about it: Yeats was a great poet, who wrote great poetry. I really enjoyed reading his poetry like this, it gave me a better feel for his life’s work as a whole.\n\nThere were quite a few poems in here that I really liked and will be going back to, particularly some of his romantic poems. It helped that I already know a bit about his lover, Maude Gonne. Overall, his diction, and the flow of his poetry, can be very enchanting and beautiful.\n\nDecember 15, 2014\n\nI have always been more acquainted with unorthodox and “avant-garde” literature. Lately I have been going back and reading some of the more traditional classics. I must say, at first I wanted to pull my eyes out while reading Yeats. He definitely has an unhealthy obsession with swift and although Keats, who as a poet is good, I feel he draws too much in his early writings from the deficient pathos I find in his works. Therefore as a self proclaimed “neo-romantic” I struggled through his early writings.\n\nNevertheless his later works were superb! The hyperbolic romantic idealization wanes towards what the editor rightly describes as his writing of the soul through the body. In this vein I feel he redeems his prior convictions and breaks free from stylistic constraints as tactile emotions comingle with his more spiritual convictions. One must concede to him though an unrelenting optimism through the times of strife, however disillusioned I may feel it to be, as he continued his career.\n\nRead\n\nAugust 16, 2011\n\nThere are good annotated remarks, and the excellent service resources to continue to reading Years.\n\nNovember 1, 2019\n\nYeats’ poetry is elegant, delicate. I have not been properly educated on poetry in any form, sub Paradise Lost and some meagre attempts at Shakespeare. This semester I finally was introduced to Yeats, Eliot, and Shaw (mostly plays, though Eliot argued that drama was a form of poetic expression) and I am in love, to put it simply. The dissonant struggle between life and art that Yeats tackles in his poetry throughout his life makes the collection one brimming with universality, convenience, yet packed with allusions and analytical possibility. Some of my favorite works are those that take time, effort, and outside sources to fully understand. That is what one gets with Yeats, as well as much of the best poets, authors, etc.\n\nAugust 20, 2019\n\nA nice collection from the last great poet in my mind. Although, I will say, I am immune to the charms of his gaelic/irish mythology inspired poetry.\n\nRead\n\nFebruary 23, 2021\n\n*read for british poetry class*\n\nWant to read\n\nFebruary 6, 2013\n\n“Out of the quarrel with others we make rhetoric; out of the quarrel with ourselves we make poetry.”\n\n-Yeats\n\nhttp://www.online-literature.com/yeat...\n\nO Do Not Love Too Long\n\nSWEETHEART, do not love too long:\n\nI loved long and long,\n\nAnd grew to be out of fashion\n\nLike an old song.\n\nAll through the years of our youth\n\nNeither could have known\n\nTheir own thought from the other's,\n\nWe were so much at one.\n\nBut O, in a minute she changed -\n\nO do not love too long,\n\nOr you will grow out of fashion\n\nLike an old song.\n\nThe Lover Tells Of The Rose In His Heart\n\nALL things uncomely and broken, all things worn out and old,\n\nThe cry of a child by the roadway, the creak of a lumbering cart,\n\nThe heavy steps of the ploughman, splashing the wintry mould,\n\nAre wronging your image that blossoms a rose in the deeps of my heart.\n\nThe wrong of unshapely things is a wrong too great to be told;\n\nI hunger to build them anew and sit on a green knoll apart,\n\nWith the earth and the sky and the water, re-made, like a casket of gold\n\nFor my dreams of your image that blossoms a rose in the deeps of my heart.\n\nWant to read\n\nJuly 5, 2009\n\nI'm actually not reading this much now so maybe it shouldn't be in my currently reading, but I had a couple weeks where I had really bad insomnia and was reading this to help me get to sleep. I always had a vague idea that I probably liked Yeats but wasn't actually very familiar with his work, and then I read the intro to this book and I'm glad I did because it's basically like, \"Yeats makes gazillions of references and allusions to super obscure things that you aren't gonna know, and neither do most people, so you should just sort of read his work and enjoy the sound and feeling of it without getting too hung up on understanding what the hell he's saying, exactly.\" Or at least, that's how I interpreted the intro, & have been reading his poems accordingly, and so far so good. In any case, his poems have been pleasant enough that they've successfully enabled me to get to sleep at night.\n\nNovember 9, 2012\n\nThis elegant collection of the poet's work takes us from his early, idealistic times, to his final days and mortally aware literature. Yeats's poetry is hyper-representative of Ireland, oftentimes exhibiting anthropomorphic figures of the country in his tale-like sing-song rhyming structures and poetic plots. Interspersed throughout, though, are his heavy Irish revolutionary thoughts, his lover's laments (damn you, Maude Gonne), and his pensive final summation of life and art.\n\nThere are some truly deep and beautiful poems in this collection, enough to make you read again and again. The four plays, included throughout, likewise mirror Yeats's fascination with Irish politics, literature and lore, and love.\n\nPerhaps Ireland's greatest poet (and THAT is a distinction), a collection of Yeats should be on every shelf.\n\nMay 20, 2021\n\nIt's been close to twenty years since I picked up Yeats. I was reminded of the tremendous beauty of his work when a few years ago, I came across the final verse of \"The Second Coming\" at a photo exhibit at the Met. I found the same poem a few weeks ago and decided to purchase this book. I breezed through it and it brought me back to my college days studying his likes and that of Ezra Pound, e.e. cummings, and Edna St Vincent Millay. Poetry as they wrote it is a lost art, perhaps even a lost language. In such hardened and dark times as we now face, it was great to venture back into a landscape of such ethereal beauty. Though his obsession with death lingers in all verse here, there is a natural ease to the flow of his words and rarely is one ever out of place.\n\nJuly 18, 2012\n\nI couldn't find the exact e-book called just \"Poems\" from \"Gutenberg\" project with some plays and other poetry, which I am currently reading, but this one seems to be the closest to it with its content and volume.\n\nSo, I just read \"The Countess Cathleen\" and several poems about Fergus and The Druid and Cuchulain and his son (\"The Death of Cuchulain\"), and I have to say this was one of the most absorbing reads I have ever had in my life. I would never expect that I will enjoy reading a play so much! Hopefully, all Yeats lovers will pardon my expression: I can't help but saying they were f*ckin' awesome!! :D\n\nJune 3, 2011\n\nI read this collection too fast, a couple poems a night just before going to sleep, and that's not the way to read Yeats. You need resources nearby for looking up his references (unless you have a really strong background in classical literature, Irish mythology, and the past century and a half or so of the history of Ireland) to fully appreciate many of the poems in this collection.\n\nNevertheless, much of what you can understand and some of what you can't, you are stirred by and love.\n\nJanuary 14, 2010\n\nWBY is probably my favorite poet (it's close w/ Keats and Eliot). I think this collection gives a good intro to his works. My personal favorites are the Byzantium poems, which contemplate the role of the artist v/v death (cf. Shakespeare's sonnets).\n\nSeptember 5, 2012\n\nSome quite excellent poetry, some not so much. Reminds me some of T S Eliot. Many excellent one-or-two-liners in the middle of mediocre work. Lots of literary allusions, philosophical thoughts, historical mentions and theological stuff.\n\nDecember 5, 2016\n\nThis collection was my introduction to Yeats, the Irish author of gorgeous and powerful verse that has deeply moved me for two decades. I'm forever grateful my girlfriend (now my wife) bought it for me.\n\nRead\n\nApril 19, 2007\n\nMany was the dreamy sigh I spent over this collection of poems and plays. Oh, darling William, keeper of my collegiate heart!\n\nOctober 18, 2007\n\ni went through a irish literature phase in college. i read as much as possible however i feel like i have retained little from it.\n\nMay 30, 2008\n\nThe Wilde Swans at Coole... my favorite\n\nJune 21, 2008\n\nNo matter who you are or what your interests, I can find at least one poem here that will move you deeply.\n\nSeptember 11, 2009\n\na powerful glimpse into what was then the future of literature, with an added history lesson and analysis of the [still ongoing:] Irish-English political struggle.\n\nRead\n\nSeptember 14, 2009\n\nSelected Poems And Four Plays by William Butler Yeats (1996)\n\nApril 22, 2010\n\n[My edition has THREE plays, not FOUR.
