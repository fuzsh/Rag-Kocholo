        "text": "If her newest client was going to dig out from the funk he’d fallen into, the talk therapist advised him to consider WB Yeats — mainly as a caution, though at the time he wasn’t sure what she meant by it. The anguished dude had just rolled the odometer into his 40s, which were going downhill faster than a go-cart with feet for brakes. What was she possibly going on about?\n\nIn an early session he might have confessed to being busy writing poems about his disconsolate existence — poetry being the most serious form of writing — and she suggested Yeats. In school the dude had studied nothing but architecture, so he didn’t know enough about Yeats to debate the question. Hadn’t Yeats come after Shelley and Keats? Were the Pre-Raphaelites late blooming Romantics?\n\nWhat the therapist said was that Yeats had fallen in lust with Maude Gonne while still in his twenties, though she held him at bay. What was she to do with a delicate Irish Protestant boy who’d refused a college education, had only a thin resume to his name and nothing like an inheritance to pay his bills? In those days Yeats wasn’t the catch he’d eventually become — he hadn’t come from a family that valued wealth above art. Despite eventual literary fame, he continued this enthrallment for most his life.\n\nYeats did his utmost to entice her. Even became wrapped up in the Irish fight for independence so he might spend time — chaste moments, mind — in her presence. She was said to be the beauty of Erie, and he proceeded to place her on a pedestal high above him, writing poems about his personal goddess. The old photos don’t do her justice, or Yeats needed contacts.\n\n“Style’s everything,” the boy would insist to Mel and his reply was always the same: “You think it’s easy?”\n\nYeats’s father was a portrait painter quite skilled but of middling success, being unable to stop repainting a portrait, and his mother went mad but not before producing four children — or because of it; Ellman doesn’t say. ’Twas best in those days to bury scandals. Yeats’s grandfather was the rector in Drumcliffe, just outside Sligo, another form of dubious behavior. It was by no means clear Yeats would ever amount to much, let alone the figure he became. At least we had that much in common.\n\nPining was a specialty of Yeats, taking to heart Rossetti’s portraits of languishing, long-haired women. The Pre-Raphaelites were his father’s influence, which took decades for Yeats to work out of his system, being a last Romantic. As did his pining for Maude, and who in gods’ names would hang a name like that on a sweet baby?\n\nFar as the boy could tell, the therapist mostly counseled young women — judging from those who sat in her waiting room wiping their noses and looking woeful — close to languishment. In fact, she’d originally been counseling the young woman who’d hung the dude on the line. She in turn urged that he go talk to the counselor to help him through his mourning period. She wasn’t a bad sort; she only wanted someone with a better financial future than an architect.\n\nIt had been a torrid few months — beginning one crisp fall morning after they’d raced a 10K on Haines Point, then sat with the running club in the sun — and being charmed by its newest member. The affair barely lasted to the following spring. She was a former college cross-country runner at Georgetown and the friend of a friend in the running club. And in no time he’d have gladly driven off a cliff in his go-cart for this young woman. Wrote an entire book of poems about her — thus the connection to Yeats.\n\n“You think it’s easy?”\n\nHearing of WB Yeats, the boy’s reaction to the tale was undoubtedly the effect the therapist was hoping for — something along the lines of ‘get a grip, for christ’s sake.’ Instead he set out to learn about WB.\n\nBesides, if he squinted, he kinda sorta looked like YB in his 40s, as Sargent sketched Yeats in charcoals — minus the cravat. But he swore he would not write endlessly about the eternal red rose, just sad stories about a whirlwind love affair. It’s strange how the mind forms these connections to totally unrelated things. But the dude truly loved her — for one brief and shining moment as the musical had it.\n\nRichard Ellman first published Yeats — The Man and the Masks in 1948, not too long after Yeats’s death in 1938. Ellman had been given generous access to Yeats’s unpublished letters and drafts by George Yeats, his much younger wife. George Yeats sat for interviews about their lives together — she was dedicated to the story of whom she’d married. The book remains a seminal work on Yeats given that Ellman was first to read the unpublished stuff.\n\nThe 40-something boy went out and bought a copy sometime in 1990, in the midst of his miserable struggle to find a life after a broken heart after an equally broken marriage. It’s a cliché to say poetry comes from misery, but he was writing poems and found time to start an architectural business with three others — and try mightily to get over her. Sixty-hour weeks followed by late nights writing in Southern Towers, just him, the cockroaches and one dying mouse on the thirteenth floor. He wrote a poem about the dying mouse.\n\nAll the while he could hear Mel yelling: “You think it’s easy?”\n\nThe boy bought Ellman’s book hoping to gain clarity about Yeats’s poetry. Yeats was hung up on symbols, the more obscure the better, and he was hoping for more clarity — as was the boy reader. What deep knowledge might be found on Innisfree? No kidding.\n\nAbout this same time, the boy was plowing through Harold Bloom’s Western Cannon — which had good things to say about Yeats. According to Bloom, Yeats stood in the doorway between the Romantics such as Shelley and the Modernists like T.S. Elliott and Ezra Pound. Pound worked as Yeats’s secretary for a few years, and married the daughter of Olivia Shakespear, a close friend of Yates — a very close friend as they used to say. Once Yeats got over his pledge of celibacy to Maude and became better known, he found solace in getting down with the womenfolk which surely improved his mood.\n\nThe book’s title is the crux of Ellman’s biography — he was convinced it was the way into the mind of a very complicated person, poet or otherwise.\n\nYeats’s father, John Butler Yeats, was a better portrait artist than a provider. He had rebelled from his own father, the Protestant preacher whose small church in Drumcliffe overlooked Sligo. WB Yeats and his wife, George, are buried there.\n\n“The history of the Yeats family shows over three generations a kind of dialectical [arguable] progression. The Reverend William Butler Yeats… was a deeply orthodox Rector of the Church of Ireland; his eldest son, John Butler Yeats, became a complete skeptic; out of thesis and antithesis the poet William Butler Yeats…eldest son in the third generation, erected an eccentric faith somewhere between his grandfather’s orthodox belief and his father’s unorthodox disbelief.” from Yeats — The Man and the Masks by Richard Ellman\n\nThe Man and his Masks\n\nIn close detail, Ellman plots how Yeats divided himself from his writing much as he tried to unify his writing to his life. He was forever holding up opposites for contrast, taking one side then the other, always with an eye toward disguising his true beliefs. One might think his father’s skepticism was the origin of this, but Yeats was determined to carve a religion of his own making to fill an empty place inside himself. What one sees of a parent as applied to one’s own life is often a mash-up. Or, in Bloom’s term, an anxiety of influence. Bloom believed Yeats’s anxiety came from Shelley; Ellman beat him to it by pointing out Yeats’s own father.\n\nMaybe so maybe no, but Ellman was first to recognize Yeats’s masks as the public disguise of a shy, private man. Always point and counterpoint. It wasn’t until his final years that Yeats would throw off the coy disguises he’d worn since his youth, searching earnestly for a direct way of expressing himself — one could say, a modern way. Symbolism was dead; love live Symbolism.\n\nBloom honored literature as a path leading back to earlier minds — like one of Yeats’s gyres. Thus Bloom’s Cannon shows what we’ve been given by our ancestors. Twitter followers can’t see the relevance, and in this stupefying near-sightedness, they mistake popularity for something more lasting.\n\nNobody could accuse my poetry of being choked with symbolism. It was something I worried over, having never studied Shelley and Keats outside of high school lit class, and I refused to accept Wadsworth’s assertion that the poet should be subsumed in the poem — an affectation Yeats found difficult to escape. Possibly it was the influence of modern writing that drew Yeats away from misty Innisfree and the tragedy of Cú Chulainn.\n\nYeats’s father had his skepticism, his grandfather his religion; Yeats needed to invent his own mythology to make sense of the world. Beginning early with Madame Blavatsky moving onto the Golden Dawn, through séances, to arrive at automatic writing with his wife, George (George Hyde-Lees).\n\nMiami Séance\n\nIn my youthful Miami days, David, an architect friend/colleague, introduced me to a man who ran a regular séance consisting mostly of women in their 20s and 30s. David persuaded the mother of my children to attend several and being still a couple, I tagged along. The séance director — whatever he called himself, we’ll call him Ralph — from the first session was clearly interested in more than only exposing the women’s fates rapt as they were. And my colleague said he was opened to extra curricular activity — he and his sig other were drifting apart. She spent her days at the Venetian Pool getting quite a nice tan and there was the ubiquitous pool boy to consider… In saintly aversion, I overlooked his ulterior motives.\n\nMy problem in buying into the clairvoyant schtick lay in either a lack of imagination, or too strong a skepticism, but I couldn’t imagine what might win me over. Saul claimed he was struck from his horse on the way to Damascus, but he could have just been hung over and choosing not to go into details, praise the lord. And there’s that perennial human itch to solve all mysteries, or paper them over. We all have that tick. Some take it further than others. And as long as it doesn’t involve cruelty to animals and kids, I’m OK with the gig.\n\nIn an indirect descent, James Merrill and David Jackson (his husband in fact if not in law) practiced ouija board writing — producing The Changing Light at Sandover as Merrill’s intimidating opus. His guide to the spirit world, by the name of Ephraim, had Merrill’s teasing sense of humor — coincidentally. Did Merrill ‘believe’ believe or was it an amusing way to get ideas for poetry? For that matter, did Yeats ‘believe’ believe?\n\nPoets need inspirations, whether their hearts be broken by lovers or ghosts. Yeats had Leo Africanus as a spirit guide when he was in his séance phase. Merrill’s Ephraim was a wickedly humored spirit to be sure. In our own time, W.S. Merwin might be traced back through the same lines, minus the woo-woo. He was the son of a Puritan-sounding minister, who haunted a good part o his adult life.\n\nLikewise waving an incense thurible and listening to virgin nuns can give you the blues.\n\nPoetry is a tight discipline by its nature. Each line, every word. So stretching a poem into a philosophy the way Yeats did in A Vision, or into a narrative as Merrill did in The Changing Light at Sandover is a labor of love. For my own longer story-poems, I’ve tried several different structures, though none as exquisitely carved in ivory like Yeats’s, or as casually cast as Merrill’s.\n\nThe point isn’t to brag, but to say I grasp the distinction, as Mel was always cheerfully pointing out. What I intuitively moved toward were Yeats’s later poems. He held onto his earlier painterly Romanticism, but found a deeper voice as he matured. Ellman says he moved from Innisfree-styled mush (my word) toward mask and finally arriving at an expression of power and vision. Hard to say which of his later poems I like best, but the poems, The Wild Swans at Coole and A Second Coming might stand as examples. Yeats learned to paint in words in his twenties The boy born to fear grew into a man of some depth — a poet of some depth.\n\nThe Second Coming\n\nBy William Butler Yeats\n\nTurning and turning in the widening gyre\n\nThe falcon cannot hear the falconer;\n\nThings fall apart; the centre cannot hold;\n\nMere anarchy is loosed upon the world,\n\nThe blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere\n\nThe ceremony of innocence is drowned;\n\nThe best lack all conviction, while the worst\n\nAre full of passionate intensity.\n\nSurely some revelation is at hand;\n\nSurely the Second Coming is at hand.\n\nThe Second Coming! Hardly are those words out\n\nWhen a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi\n\nTroubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert\n\nA shape with lion body and the head of a man,\n\nA gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,\n\nIs moving its slow thighs, while all about it\n\nReel shadows of the indignant desert birds.\n\nThe darkness drops again; but now I know\n\nThat twenty centuries of stony sleep\n\nWere vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,\n\nAnd what rough beast, its hour come round at last,\n\nSlouches towards Bethlehem to be born?\n\nThe Second Coming — from the Poetry Foundation Source: The Collected Poems of W. B. Yeats (1989)\n\nYeats wrote The Second Coming in 1919 in the aftermath of World War I. Seeing much the same monsters today in the 21st century seems resignedly sad. My love of Yeats’s poems runs deep — even as I remain exasperated with his fixation on anyone named Maude. Perhaps she can serve as an object lesson to yearn for untouchable things.\n\nWhether Yeats’s final poems are better being stripped on the myth, they are pungent in their observations:\n\nThe Four Ages of Man\n\nHe with body waged a fight\n\nBut body won; it walks upright.\n\nThen he struggled with the heart;\n\nInnocence and peace depart.\n\nThen he struggled with the mind;\n\nHis proud heart he left behind.\n\nNow his wars on God begin;\n\nAt stroke of midnight God shall win.\n\n“The following day in a letter to a friend [Yeats] said: ‘I know for certain that my time will not be long. I have put away everything that can be put away that I may speak what I have to speak & I find my expression is a part of study.\n\n“ ‘In two or three weeks — I am now idle that I may rest after writing much verse — I will begin to write my most fundamental thoughts & the arrangement of thought which I am convinced will complete my studies, I am happy and think full of an energy I had despaired of. It seems to me I have found what I wanted.\n\n“ ‘When I try to put all into a phrase I say Man can embody truth but he cannot know it. “\n\nPoem and letter as quoted in Richard Ellman’s Yeats the Man and the Masks"
