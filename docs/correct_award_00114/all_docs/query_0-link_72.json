        "text": "Many years ago, when I first met William Butler Yeats, he was tall and lithe; with a boyish quality to him which carried enthusiasm. There was a look of constant inquiry arching his eyebrows over the straight bar of his eyeglasses. He had the sensitive face of a poet alive, not to the moment, but to the mystic stretch of the moments in the past. Yet, at that time, he was intent on establishing a theatre—which carried with it a multitude of worldly arrangements. He came to America1 to talk of the Irish Revival—and he did talk, glowingly, confidently. He was the flaming flower of that rebirth: to him we owe the stirring of the rich soil of Irish folk tradition; it was he who went to Paris and uprooted Synge, and transplanted him in the Aran Islands; through his encouragement it was that Lady Gregory turned playwright, and became mother of the movement which he had fathered in his mind so many years."
