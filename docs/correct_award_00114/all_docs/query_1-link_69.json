        "text": "His Dream\n\nby W. B. Yeats\n\nI swayed upon the gaudy stern\n\nThe butt end of a steering oar,\n\nAnd everywhere that I could turn\n\nMen ran upon the shore.\n\nAnd though I would have hushed the crowd\n\nThere was no mother’s son but said,\n\nWhat is the figure in a shroud\n\nUpon a gaudy bed\n\nAnd fishes bubbling to the brim\n\nCried out upon that thing beneath,\n\nIt had such dignity of limb,\n\nBy the sweet name of Death.\n\nThough I’d my finger on my lip,\n\nWhat could I but take up the song?\n\nAnd fish and crowd and gaudy ship\n\nCried out the whole night long,\n\nCrying amid the glittering sea,\n\nNaming it with ecstatic breath,\n\nBecause it had such dignity\n\nBy the sweet name of Death.\n\n###\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats (1865-1939) was one of the foremost poets of 20th century literature. An Irish poet and playwright, Yeats helped drive the Irish Literary Revival and co-founded the Abbey Theatre. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923 for what the Nobel Committee described as “inspired poetry, which in a highly artistic form gives expression to the spirit of a whole nation.”\n\nYeats was born in Dublin and spent his childhood between London and County Sligo in Ireland. The Irish landscape and folklore of his youth informed much of his poetic imagery and nationalistic sentiments later in life. Though he trained as a painter initially, Yeats turned fully towards poetry in his twenties while becoming involved in occult circles in London. He published several poetry collections in the 1890s as well as plays rooted in Irish mythology.\n\nAlongside Lady Gregory, Yeats was a driving force behind the Irish Literary Revival aimed at reviving native Irish language and culture through art. As a playwright, he co-founded the Abbey Theatre with Gregory and others as a home for Irish drama. Over his long and prolific career, Yeats cemented his legacy as one of Ireland’s most revered writers, noted for his imaginative lyricism and powerful vision infused with Irish politics and mythology. His poems of unrequited love, Irish rebellion and the arcane remain widely influential in modern literature."
