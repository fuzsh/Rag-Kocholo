        "text": "Often called the greatest lyric Irish poet of all time, William Butler Yeats was one of the driving forces behind the Irish Literary Revival. He also co-founded the Abbey Theatre and the Dun Emer Press, and served as an Irish Senator from 1922-28.\n\nYeats had a keen interest in transcendentalism and his works reflect his lifelong relationship with fairies of Irish folktales and mystical states. He also translated The Ten Principal Upanishads (1938) with Shri Purohit Swami and was admitted into The Golden Dawn and the Theosophical Society (whose founder, VIP Madame Blavatsky, reportedly used hashish). He wrote in 1892, \"The mystical life is the centre of all that I do and all that I think and all that I write.'\"\n\nIn 1889, Yeats met Maud Gonne, a young heiress who became passionately involved in the Irish nationalist movement. Although she rejected his many marriage proposals, Gonne greatly influenced Yeats's life and work.\n\nYeats was first introduced to hashish (and dance) by the writer Arthur Symons, who he met in 1890. In February 1894, Yeats and Gonne traveled to Paris, where they took hashish together. In December 1896, Yeats again visited Paris and took hashish. In the chapter ‘Concerning saints and artists’ of his autobiographic essay \"Discoveries\" (1906), Yeats wrote:\n\nI took the Indian hemp with certain followers of Saint-Martin on the ground floor of a house in the Latin Quarter. I had never taken it before, and was instructed by a boisterous young poet, whose English was no better than my French. He gave me a little pellet, if I am not forgetting, an hour before dinner, and another after we had dined together at some restaurant. As we were going through the streets to the meeting-place of the Martinists, I felt suddenly that a cloud I was looking at floated in an immense space, and for an instant my being rushed out, as it seemed, into that space with ecstasy. I was myself again immediately, but the poet was wholly above himself, and presently he pointed to one of the street-lamps now brightening in the fading twilight, and cried at the top of his voice, ‘Why do you look at me with your great eye?’"
