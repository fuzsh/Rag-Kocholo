        "text": "Yeats’s proximity to fascism didn’t stop there. In 1934, he accepted a literary prize from Nazi Germany. And in 1938, he accepted a limited edition copy of Germany Speaks, an English language anthology of propagandist essays by Nazi authors on subjects such as land, race, health and women’s affairs. It carried within it an inscription from a Nazi diplomat called Eduard Hempel, who described an ‘unforgettable afternoon’ he had spent with Yeats.\n\nThat Yeats mixed with Nazis should not be a surprise. During the 1930s, some Irish republicans saw an invasion of Britain by Nazi Germany as a stepping stone for a united Ireland, and many Irish anti-imperialists held far-right views. In 1940, for instance, over a 100 former members of the IRA formed a party called Córas na Poblachta (Republican System). At its founding, it told the press it was ready to take over the government of Ireland ‘on either a corporate or fascist basis’. Córas argued that Jews were undermining native enterprise, daubed anti-Semitic graffiti on houses and walls, and smashed the windows of Jewish businesses.\n\nThis context is not meant to excuse Yeats’s political associations and interests. It is merely to point out that he moved in authoritarian circles in which enthusiasm for national socialism and fascism was widespread.\n\nThat being said, Yeats could not realistically be described as a fascist. As with violent republicanism, his interest in it lay somewhere between a flirtation and a short-lived commitment.\n\nNo country for Yeats?\n\nWhat is not in doubt is Yeats’s lifelong commitment to spiritualism. At 25, he joined the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, which was devoted to studying the occult. At the time, it had around a hundred members, including Maud Gonne and the occultist philosopher, Aleister Crowley. Yeats believed that the boundaries of the spirit world and the real world were porous, and that history was in essence cyclical. He envisioned the historical process as two opposing gyres, with time endlessly winding from one gyre to another. From this perspective, he saw the tumultuous interwar years as an apocalyptic, transitional moment between what he described as an epoch of ‘objectivity’ and the coming one of subjectivity. In ‘The Second Coming’ (1920), he famously represented this destabilising change as follows:\n\n‘Turning and turning in the widening gyre\n\nThe falcon cannot hear the falconer;\n\nThings fall apart; the centre cannot hold;\n\nMere anarchy is loosed upon the world,\n\nThe blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere\n\nThe ceremony of innocence is drowned;\n\nThe best lack all conviction, while the worst\n\nAre full of passionate intensity.’\n\nThe second stanza prophesies the coming of a figure as significant as Christ, but a ‘rough beast’, an anti-Christ, to take centre stage. It is a wonderful, terrifying poem, rich in complex imagery and ideas as Yeats struggles to represent the contrary forces at work in history. For many it signals an anticipation of the Second World War.\n\n‘The Second Coming’ was Yeats at his elusive best. Here he gives poetic form to a profound sense of historical crisis. It is also typical of Yeats’s work, because it shows how difficult it is to categorise. He is a symbolist poet, with every line about more than one subject; something concrete, something abstract. He also distilled complex ideas, events and individuals through allegory. Maud Gonne was often a rose, Ireland’s struggle for independence, a rose tree.\n\nIt is said today that he is no longer relevant, that his sometime political flirtations put him beyond the pale. That’s a good enough reason to read anyone. We see our times and ourselves more clearly from elsewhere. And Yeats was always partly elsewhere, half-dreaming.\n\nThere is a wider point here: it ought to be perfectly possible to admire someone’s poetry and oppose their views. While Yeats’s authoritarianism and his receptivity to fascism are troubling, readers and students used to recognise the autonomy of art. They used to recognise that it is possible to value the work for the work itself, on its own terms. But too much of today’s cultural establishment has lost any sense of the autonomy of art, of its freedom from the views and actions of its creator. They have a self-regarding attitude to literature. They seem to demand of writers that they must have values that they share, that they approve of. It’s a narcissistic, consumerist and presentist approach to art.\n\nTS Eliot once described Yeats as ‘one of those few whose history is the history of their own time, who are part of the consciousness of an age which cannot be understood without them’. That at least is true. Yeats leads us to many places, and the journey remains unforgettable."
