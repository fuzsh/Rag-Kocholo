        "text": "William Butler Yeats was born into an artistic Protestant family in Dublin, Ireland. Though his family was sympathetic to English rule, Yeats early on interested himself in Irish history, culture, politics, and governmental autonomy. His earliest poetry drew upon Celtic mythology, culminating in a literary movement called The Celtic Twilight that promoted Irish fairy tales and folklore.\n\nIn 1885, Yeats’s family moved to London, where Yeats established himself in the literary life there. He and fellow writer Ernest Rhys (1859-1946) founded the Rhymers’ Club, the other members of which included Ernest Dowson (1867-1900), Lionel Johnson (1867- 1902), John Gray (1866-1934), and Arthur Symons (1865-1945). The club published two anthologies in 1892 and 1894, mainly, as Yeats later claimed, to share Dowson’s poetry with the world.\n\nAnother group in which Yeats participated was the Theosophical Society, founded by Madame Blavatsky (1831-1891). This spiritualist group studied the occult, the cabala, and Eastern religions. Yeats expanded his interest in spiritualism and the occult when he left the Theosophical Society and joined the Order of the Golden Dawn, a society purporting to practice ancient magic.\n\nYeats’s personal interests in Ireland and the occult found beautiful expression in his early and middle periods of writing, with the publication of such collections of poetry as The Secret Rose (1897) and The Wind Among the Reeds (1899). Another subject of his poetry was his unrequited love for Maud Gonne (1866-1953), an Irish nationalist who eventually married the Irish Revolutionary John MacBride (1868- 1916), one of the fifteen Irish rebels executed by the British for participating in the Easter Rising.\n\nThe Easter Rising inspired both Yeats’s poem “Easter, 1916” and his return to Ireland. He had been living there sporadically through his co-founding—with Lady Gregory (1852-1932) and Edward Martyn (1859-1923)—and managing of the Abbey Theatre, a nationalist theater in Dublin. Besides poetry, Yeats wrote several dramas, the later ones of which were influenced by the Noh drama of Japan. Many features of this drama found their way into Yeats’s poetic work, particularly the image of the dancer, symbolism, and the use of the mask.\n\nYeats’s later poetry remained personal; however, he developed his own System of symbols that conveyed his spiritualist vision in concrete terms. He established his System in his book A Vision (1925), which drew upon the automatic writing of the woman he ultimately married, Georgiana Hyde-Lees (1892-1968). His System conflated individual and historical development. With the Wheel, Yeats diagrammed the opposing forces that determine individual and historical progress and change: primary and antithetical, objective and subjective, a moral cycle and an aesthetic cycle, the Christian God and pagan nature, the pulpit and the altar. Within these forces, the individual struggles to find personality, taking life at certain phases that follow the phases of the moon. Art, the perfection of art that balances spirit and body, movement and stasis, occurs at Phase 15, the Full Moon. At Phase 15, all thought is perfectly embodied. According to Yeats’s system, the Renaissance era and Byzantium are at Phase 15.\n\nAs one phase/era ends, another begins, a process Yeats symbolizes through the turning of a perne in a gyre. A civilization has its distinctive character only at its height. When it declines, it crumbles into its opposite, just like human personality. But gyres refer more to civilizations than to people. Gyres are the equivalent of the Wheel. Revelation, the union of god and woman (Mary, Leda), brings in a new civilization. Many of Yeats’ poems draw upon this System, including “Leda and the Swan,” “The Second Coming,” “Among School Children,” “Sailing to Byzantium,” and “Byzantium.”\n\nYeats’s life and work received increasing attention as he aged, with his being appointed as Senator to the Irish Free State in 1922 and his winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1923.\n\n3.5.1: “The Lake Isle of Innisfree”\n\nI will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,\n\nAnd a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made:\n\nNine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee;\n\nAnd live alone in the bee-loud glade.\n\nAnd I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,\n\nDropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;\n\nThere midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,\n\nAnd evening full of the linnet’s wings.\n\nI will arise and go now, for always night and day\n\nI hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;\n\nWhile I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,\n\nI hear it in the deep heart’s core.\n\n3.5.2: “The Wild Swans at Coole”\n\nThe trees are in their autumn beauty,\n\nThe woodland paths are dry,\n\nUnder the October twilight the water\n\nMirrors a still sky;\n\nUpon the brimming water among the stones\n\nAre nine and fifty swans.\n\nThe nineteenth Autumn has come upon me\n\nSince I first made my count;\n\nI saw, before I had well finished,\n\nAll suddenly mount\n\nAnd scatter wheeling in great broken rings\n\nUpon their clamorous wings.\n\nI have looked upon those brilliant creatures,\n\nAnd now my heart is sore.\n\nAll’s changed since I, hearing at twilight,\n\nThe first time on this shore,\n\nThe bell-beat of their wings above my head,\n\nTrod with a lighter tread.\n\n3.5.3: “Easter 1916”\n\nI have met them at close of day\n\nComing with vivid faces\n\nFrom counter or desk among grey\n\nEighteenth-century houses.\n\nI have passed with a nod of the head\n\nOr polite meaningless words,\n\nOr have lingered awhile and said\n\nPolite meaningless words,\n\nAnd thought before I had done\n\nOf a mocking tale or a gibe\n\nTo please a companion\n\nAround the fire at the club,\n\nBeing certain that they and I\n\nBut lived where motley is worn:\n\nAll changed, changed utterly:\n\nA terrible beauty is born.\n\nThat woman’s days were spent\n\nIn ignorant good-will,\n\nHer nights in argument\n\nUntil her voice grew shrill.\n\nWhat voice more sweet than hers\n\nWhen, young and beautiful,\n\nShe rode to harriers?\n\nThis man had kept a school\n\nAnd rode our wingèd horse;\n\nThis other his helper and friend\n\nWas coming into his force;\n\nHe might have won fame in the end,\n\nSo sensitive his nature seemed,\n\nSo daring and sweet his thought.\n\nThis other man I had dreamed\n\nA drunken, vainglorious lout.\n\nHe had done most bitter wrong\n\nTo some who are near my heart,\n\nYet I number him in the song;\n\nHe, too, has resigned his part\n\nIn the casual comedy;\n\nHe, too, has been changed in his turn,\n\nTransformed utterly:\n\nA terrible beauty is born.\n\nHearts with one purpose alone\n\nThrough summer and winter seem\n\nEnchanted to a stone\n\nTo trouble the living stream.\n\nThe horse that comes from the road,\n\nThe rider, the birds that range\n\nFrom cloud to tumbling cloud,\n\nMinute by minute they change;\n\nA shadow of cloud on the stream\n\nChanges minute by minute;\n\nA horse-hoof slides on the brim,\n\nAnd a horse plashes within it;\n\nThe long-legged moor-hens dive,\n\nAnd hens to moor-cocks call;\n\nMinute to minute they live;\n\nThe stone’s in the midst of all.\n\nToo long a sacrifice\n\nCan make a stone of the heart.\n\nO when may it suffice?\n\nThat is Heaven’s part, our part\n\nTo murmur name upon name,\n\nAs a mother names her child\n\nWhen sleep at last has come\n\nOn limbs that had run wild.\n\nWhat is it but nightfall?\n\nNo, no, not night but death;\n\nWas it needless death after all?\n\nFor England may keep faith\n\nFor all that is done and said.\n\nWe know their dream; enough\n\nTo know they dreamed and are dead;\n\nAnd what if excess of love\n\nBewildered them till they died?\n\nI write it out in a verse—\n\nMacDonagh and MacBride\n\nAnd Connolly and Pearse\n\nNow and in time to be,\n\nWherever green is worn,\n\nAre changed, changed utterly:\n\nA terrible beauty is born.\n\n3.5.4: “The Second Coming”\n\nTurning and turning in the widening gyre\n\nThe falcon cannot hear the falconer;\n\nThings fall apart; the centre cannot hold;\n\nMere anarchy is loosed upon the world,\n\nThe blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere\n\nThe ceremony of innocence is drowned;\n\nThe best lack all conviction, while the worst\n\nAre full of passionate intensity.\n\nSurely some revelation is at hand;\n\nSurely the Second Coming is at hand.\n\nThe Second Coming! Hardly are those words out\n\nWhen a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi\n\nTroubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert\n\nA shape with lion body and the head of a man,\n\nA gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,\n\nIs moving its slow thighs, while all about it\n\nReel shadows of the indignant desert birds.\n\nThe darkness drops again; but now I know\n\nThat twenty centuries of stony sleep\n\nWere vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,\n\nAnd what rough beast, its hour come round at last,\n\nSlouches towards Bethlehem to be born?\n\n3.5.5: “Leda and the Swan”\n\nA sudden blow: the great wings beating still\n\nAbove the staggering girl, her thighs caressed\n\nBy the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,\n\nHe holds her helpless breast upon his breast.\n\nHow can those terrified vague fingers push\n\nThe feathered glory from her loosening thighs?\n\nAnd how can body, laid in that white rush,\n\nBut feel the strange heart beating where it lies?\n\nA shudder in the loins engenders there\n\nThe broken wall, the burning roof and tower\n\nAnd Agamemnon dead.\n\nBeing so caught up,\n\nSo mastered by the brute blood of the air,\n\nDid she put on his knowledge with his power\n\nBefore the indifferent beak could let her drop?\n\n3.5.6: “Sailing to Byzantium”\n\nThat is no country for old men. The young\n\nIn one another’s arms, birds in the trees\n\n—Those dying generations—at their song,\n\nThe salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas,\n\nFish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long\n\nWhatever is begotten, born, and dies.\n\nCaught in that sensual music all neglect\n\nMonuments of unageing intellect.\n\nAn aged man is but a paltry thing,\n\nA tattered coat upon a stick, unless\n\nSoul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing\n\nFor every tatter in its mortal dress,\n\nNor is there singing school but studying\n\nMonuments of its own magnificence;\n\nAnd therefore I have sailed the seas and come\n\nTo the holy city of Byzantium.\n\nO sages standing in God’s holy fire\n\nAs in the gold mosaic of a wall,\n\nCome from the holy fire, perne in a gyre,\n\nAnd be the singing-masters of my soul.\n\nConsume my heart away; sick with desire\n\nAnd fastened to a dying animal\n\nIt knows not what it is; and gather me\n\nInto the artifice of eternity.\n\nOnce out of nature I shall never take\n\nMy bodily form from any natural thing,\n\nBut such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make\n\nOf hammered gold and gold enamelling\n\nTo keep a drowsy Emperor awake;\n\nOr set upon a golden bough to sing\n\nTo lords and ladies of Byzantium\n\nOf what is past, or passing, or to come.\n\n3.5.8: “Byzantium”\n\nThe unpurged images of day recede;\n\nThe Emperor's drunken soldiery are abed;\n\nNight resonance recedes, night-walkers' song\n\nAfter great cathedral gong;\n\nA starlit or a moonlit dome disdains\n\nAll that man is,\n\nAll mere complexities,\n\nThe fury and the mire of human veins.\n\nBefore me floats an image, man or shade,\n\nShade more than man, more image than a shade;\n\nFor Hades' bobbin bound in mummy-cloth\n\nMay unwind the winding path;\n\nA mouth that has no moisture and no breath\n\nBreathless mouths may summon;\n\nI hail the superhuman;\n\nI call it death-in-life and life-in-death.\n\nMiracle, bird or golden handiwork,\n\nMore miracle than bird or handiwork,\n\nPlanted on the starlit golden bough,\n\nCan like the cocks of Hades crow,\n\nOr, by the moon embittered, scorn aloud\n\nIn glory of changeless metal\n\nCommon bird or petal\n\nAnd all complexities of mire or blood.\n\nAt midnight on the Emperor's pavement flit\n\nFlames that no faggot feeds, nor steel has lit,\n\nNor storm disturbs, flames begotten of flame,\n\nWhere blood-begotten spirits come\n\nAnd all complexities of fury leave,\n\nDying into a dance,\n\nAn agony of trance,\n\nAn agony of flame that cannot singe a sleeve.\n\nAstraddle on the dolphin's mire and blood,\n\nSpirit after spirit! The smithies break the flood,\n\nThe golden smithies of the Emperor!\n\nMarbles of the dancing floor\n\nBreak bitter furies of complexity,\n\nThose images that yet\n\nFresh images beget,\n\nThat dolphin-torn, that gong-tormented sea."
