        "text": "BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nWhen William Butler Yeats won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923, he became the first Irish writer to be so honored. And it was an honor well-deserved. Not only had Yeats by this time established himself as one of the world’s greatest poets (though much of his greatest poetry had yet to be written), but much of his poetry was overtly political, written in support of the cause of Irish independence or other related causes. Beginning with his early phase that drew upon Irish mythology to romanticize the Irish past and rural Ireland as a whole, Yeats had by this time already moved into a more modern, urban phase that demonstrated his tremendous range as a poet. And all of this after he had sacrificed much of the first decade of the twentieth century in helping to found the Irish National Theatre, taking much of his time and energy away from the writing of poetry.\n\n“The Lake Isle of Innisfree” (1888)\n\nProbably the best known of Yeats’s early romantic poems is “The Lake Isle of Innisfree,” in which the poet imagines moving, Thoreau-like to a peaceful Irish lakeside cabin, free of the hustle and bustle of the modern world:\n\nThe Lake Isle of Innisfree\n\nI will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,\n\nAnd a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;\n\nNine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,\n\nAnd live alone in the bee-loud glade.\n\nAnd I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,\n\nDropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;\n\nThere midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,\n\nAnd evening full of the linnet’s wings.\n\nI will arise and go now, for always night and day\n\nI hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;\n\nWhile I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,\n\nI hear it in the deep heart’s core.\n\nWho Goes with Fergus? (1893)\n\nThe emphasis on Irish mythology that informs so much of Yeats’s early poetry can be found in the poem “Who Goes with Fergus?” This poem actually first appeared as a song within Yeats’s 1892 play The Countess Cathleen. In James Joyce’s Ulysses, we learn that Stephen Dedalus sang this song to his dying mother.In the poem, the poet employs the romantic image of the mythical Irish poet-king Fergus (who supposedly thrived around the time of Alexander the Great) to evoke a magical, otherworldly kingdom, free of the mundane cares of this one. That this kingdom is indisputably meant to be Irish also subtly points toward the possibility of an Irish realm free of British rule.\n\nWho Goes with Fergus?\n\nWho will go drive with Fergus now,\n\nAnd pierce the deep wood’s woven shade,\n\nAnd dance upon the level shore?\n\nYoung man, lift up your russet brow,\n\nAnd lift your tender eyelids, maid,\n\nAnd brood on hopes and fear no more.\n\nAnd no more turn aside and brood\n\nUpon love’s bitter mystery;\n\nFor Fergus rules the brazen cars,\n\nAnd rules the shadows of the wood,\n\nAnd the white breast of the dim sea\n\nAnd all dishevelled wandering stars.\n\n“When You Are Old” (1892)\n\nDuring this same early period in his career as a poet, Yeats met and fell in love with the English heiress and actress Maud Gonne, who had become a strong sympathizer with the Irish Nationalist cause (her family had some Irish background). Gonne, in fact, was much stronger and more militant in her nationalism than was Yeats himself, which caused considerable tension between them. Yeats’ attempts to win over Gonne (and his frustration at the failure of those attempts) produced some of the most enduring love poetry of the time. Indeed, Gonne is said to have claimed that one of the reasons she refused Yeats’ multiple proposals of marriage was because the unrequited nature of his love for her inspired him to write such great poetry. One of his earliest classic “Maud Gonne” poems, “When You Are Old,” already establishes the tone of frustration that would mark all of his poems to her, predicting that their love will remain unrequited but that someday she might regret that she spurned all of his advances. Despite the numerous admirers of her beauty, only, he, Yeats claims, loves her for her soul, a fact that she might recognize when she is old and looking back on her life. What might have been a puerile cliché turned, in the hands of Yeats, into a poetic masterpiece.\n\nWhen You Are Old\n\nWhen you are old and grey and full of sleep,\n\nAnd nodding by the fire, take down this book,\n\nAnd slowly read, and dream of the soft look\n\nYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;\n\nHow many loved your moments of glad grace,\n\nAnd loved your beauty with love false or true,\n\nBut one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\n\nAnd loved the sorrows of your changing face;\n\nAnd bending down beside the glowing bars,\n\nMurmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\n\nAnd paced upon the mountains overhead\n\nAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\n\n“September 1913” (1913)\n\nOne of the key markers of Yeats’ evolution from his early roots as a poet of rural romanticism to a modern political poet was the poem “September 1913,” written in support of the striking workers in the Dublin Lock-out. The poem excoriates Dublin’s businessmen for their greed in trying to squeeze every cent of profit out of their businesses by mistreating their workers. Among other things, the poem rejects the Irish fascination with the past, something that had been central to Yeats’ own work in his early years as a poet. But the bitterness and violence of the lock-out—together with the squalid, oppressive conditions that led to the strike in the first place—remind us that, as the poem says, “Romantic Ireland’s dead and gone, / It’s with O’Leary in his grave.” The “O’Leary” to whom Yeats refers, incidentally, is John O’Leary (1830–1907), a key leader in the nineteenth-century fight for Irish independence and an early leader of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. In 1865, his political activities led to his conviction on a charge of “treason felony” and to a sentence of twenty years of penal servitude, five years of which were served in English prisons, followed by fifteen years of exile, mostly in Paris, with some time also spent in the United States. In 1885 O’Leary returned to Ireland and became active in the nationalist cause there, associating with younger nationalists such as Yeats and Maud Gonne. O’Leary is also mentioned in Yeats’ poem “Beautiful Lofty Things.”\n\nAmong others mentioned in the poem, Edward Fitzgerald (1763–1798) died of wounds received while resisting arrest on charges of treason related to the 1798 Irish rebellion, while Wolfe Tone (1763–1798) was the leader of that rebellion, during which he was captured, dying sixteen days later under suspicious circumstances. Robert Emmet (1778–1803) led an abortive subsequent rebellion in 1803, after which he was captured and executed—hanged until dead, then beheaded. All (especially Tone and Emmet) are well-known figures in the list of Irish martyrs who have given their lives in the cause of Irish independence, but Yeats here suggests that the world of 1913 is different from the world of previous centuries and that the Irish should perhaps move on to deal with present ills (such as economic inequality) rather than spending all their energies celebrating past martyrs. Indeed, the poem anticipates (though in a more somber mode) Joyce’s later mockery of Irish hero-worship in the “Cyclops” chapter of Ulysses. Here, Joyce presents a barroom full of drunken Irish Nationalists who attempt to claim a long list of diverse figures (including Buddha, Cleopatra, Muhammed, Dante, Shakespeare, Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Beethoven) as examples of the heroic Irish past (12.176–99).[1]\n\n“September 1913” is written in relatively straightforward language and is structured in the simple form of eight-line stanzas, each consisting of a rhymed quatrain. It thus eschews romantic language just as it turns away from romantic reveries about the past. The deaths of men such as Fitzgerald, Emmet, and Tone in the cause of Irish independence were not the stuff of romance, but the stuff of politics, something Yeats fears the Irish have forgotten in the rush to romanticize their deaths. He thus ends the poem with a stanza complaining about the Irish penchant for turning bloody deaths into romantic reveries of a kind that might more properly be dedicated to the effect of “some woman’s yellow hair” on some smitten lover.[2]\n\nSeptember 1913\n\nWhat need you, being come to sense,\n\nBut fumble in a greasy till\n\nAnd add the halfpence to the pence\n\nAnd prayer to shivering prayer, until\n\nYou have dried the marrow from the bone;\n\nFor men were born to pray and save;\n\nRomantic Ireland’s dead and gone,\n\nIt’s with O’Leary in the grave.\n\nYet they were of a different kind,\n\nThe names that stilled your childish play,\n\nThey have gone about the world like wind,\n\nBut little time had they to pray\n\nFor whom the hangman’s rope was spun,\n\nAnd what, God help us, could they save?\n\nRomantic Ireland’s dead and gone,\n\nIt’s with O’Leary in the grave.\n\nWas it for this the wild geese spread\n\nThe grey wing upon every tide;\n\nFor this that all that blood was shed,\n\nFor this Edward Fitzgerald died,\n\nAnd Robert Emmet and Wolfe Tone,\n\nAll that delirium of the brave?\n\nRomantic Ireland’s dead and gone,\n\nIt’s with O’Leary in the grave.\n\nYet could we turn the years again,\n\nAnd call those exiles as they were\n\nIn all their loneliness and pain,\n\nYou’d cry “Some woman’s yellow hair\n\nHas maddened every mother’s son”:\n\nThey weighed so lightly what they gave.\n\nBut let them be, they’re dead and gone,\n\nThey’re with O’Leary in the grave.\n\n“Easter, 1916” (1916)\n\nYeats responded to the Easter Rising with the poem “Easter, 1916,” in which he acknowledges that an event he had not initially supported has had a profound effect on him, very much capturing (in advance) the profound impact the Rising (unpopular and unsuccessful when it first occurred) would ultimately have on Irish history. Yeats’s own ambivalence about the event can be seen in the fact that he did not publish the poem until 1921, though he wrote it shortly after the Rising. The poem is elegant and restrained, yet confused and uncertain about just how to regard the rebellion; it thus expressed what a great many people in Ireland felt at the time. Yeats, of course, had a special connection to the event, having personally known some of the participants through his activities in support of the republican cause. The second stanza, of course, is particularly personal, as he recalls Constance “Countess” Markievicz (1868–1927), a key Irish political figure whom Yeats had known since she was a teenager. Markievicz was arrested and sentenced to death after the Rising, but the sentence was commuted because she was a woman. She would go on to become the first woman elected to the British House of Commons in 1918, though she (like all of the other Irish members) refused to take her seat. Later, she became the Minister of Labor in the post-civil-war Irish government.[3] Yeats also refers to the school teacher Patrick Pearse and to Pearse’s associate Thomas McDonagh, himself a teacher, poet and playwright. The “drunken, vainglorious lout” to whom he refers is, of course, John MacBride, the estranged husband of Maud Gonne, whom Yeats resented both for marrying Gonne and for subsequently mistreating her. Such personal touches give the poem a special poignance, humanizing the rebellion, as does the listing of the executed leaders in the closing stanza. Yeats’ final musing in that stanza over whether their deaths were ultimately for nothing, because perhaps the British would have followed through on their earlier promises and granted freedom to Ireland, would, of course, be answered by history. It took a war of independence and a subsequent civil war before Ireland would finally begin to move beyond British control.\n\nEaster, 1916\n\nI have met them at close of day\n\nComing with vivid faces\n\nFrom counter or desk among grey\n\nEighteenth-century houses.\n\nI have passed with a nod of the head\n\nOr polite meaningless words,\n\nOr have lingered awhile and said\n\nPolite meaningless words,\n\nAnd thought before I had done\n\nOf a mocking tale or a gibe\n\nTo please a companion\n\nAround the fire at the club,\n\nBeing certain that they and I\n\nBut lived where motley is worn:\n\nAll changed, changed utterly:\n\nA terrible beauty is born.\n\nThat woman’s days were spent\n\nIn ignorant good-will,\n\nHer nights in argument\n\nUntil her voice grew shrill.\n\nWhat voice more sweet than hers\n\nWhen, young and beautiful,\n\nShe rode to harriers?\n\nThis man had kept a school\n\nAnd rode our wingèd horse;\n\nThis other his helper and friend\n\nWas coming into his force;\n\nHe might have won fame in the end,\n\nSo sensitive his nature seemed,\n\nSo daring and sweet his thought.\n\nThis other man I had dreamed\n\nA drunken, vainglorious lout.\n\nHe had done most bitter wrong\n\nTo some who are near my heart,\n\nYet I number him in the song;\n\nHe, too, has resigned his part\n\nIn the casual comedy;\n\nHe, too, has been changed in his turn,\n\nTransformed utterly:\n\nA terrible beauty is born.\n\nHearts with one purpose alone\n\nThrough summer and winter seem\n\nEnchanted to a stone\n\nTo trouble the living stream.\n\nThe horse that comes from the road,\n\nThe rider, the birds that range\n\nFrom cloud to tumbling cloud,\n\nMinute by minute they change;\n\nA shadow of cloud on the stream\n\nChanges minute by minute;\n\nA horse-hoof slides on the brim,\n\nAnd a horse plashes within it;\n\nThe long-legged moor-hens dive,\n\nAnd hens to moor-cocks call;\n\nMinute by minute they live:\n\nThe stone’s in the midst of all.\n\nToo long a sacrifice\n\nCan make a stone of the heart.\n\nO when may it suffice?\n\nThat is Heaven’s part, our part\n\nTo murmur name upon name,\n\nAs a mother names her child\n\nWhen sleep at last has come\n\nOn limbs that had run wild.\n\nWhat is it but nightfall?\n\nNo, no, not night but death;\n\nWas it needless death after all?\n\nFor England may keep faith\n\nFor all that is done and said.\n\nWe know their dream; enough\n\nTo know they dreamed and are dead;\n\nAnd what if excess of love\n\nBewildered them till they died?\n\nI write it out in a verse—\n\nMacDonagh and MacBride\n\nAnd Connolly and Pearse\n\nNow and in time to be,\n\nWherever green is worn,\n\nAre changed, changed utterly:\n\nA terrible beauty is born.\n\n“No Second Troy” (1916)\n\nThe “terrible beauty” of which Yeats speaks in “Easter, 1916” would turn out to be an invigorated anticolonial movement in Ireland that would eventually lead to independence—but only at great cost. The Easter Rising also marked a turning point in Yeats’s personal life. With Maud Gonne now a widow, Yeats issued one final marriage proposal to her, though apparently he was just going through the motions and did not expect (and perhaps did not even hope for) a positive response. The response was indeed negative, after which Yeats, now past fifty, turned to Gonne’s twenty-one-year-old daughter Iseult, to whom he proposed in 1917 (and again in 1918). Those proposals were also refused. In the meantime, Yeats had written a sort of poetic farewell to Maud. “No Second Troy” is a rather bitter farewell that once again notes Maud’s legendary beauty (made legendary partly by Yeats himself) but describes her as a destructive force, resembling in that sense another great beauty, Helen of Troy, whose behavior caused the ancient city of Troy to be destroyed. The comparison grows directly from Yeats’s personal experience with Maud, but it also marks a tendency during this period for Yeats to draw upon classical analogies to enliven his poetry.\n\nNo Second Troy\n\nWhy should I blame her that she filled my days\n\nWith misery, or that she would of late\n\nHave taught to ignorant men most violent ways,\n\nOr hurled the little streets upon the great,\n\nHad they but courage equal to desire?\n\nWhat could have made her peaceful with a mind\n\nThat nobleness made simple as a fire,\n\nWith beauty like a tightened bow, a kind\n\nThat is not natural in an age like this,\n\nBeing high and solitary and most stern?\n\nWhy, what could she have done, being what she is?\n\nWas there another Troy for her to burn?\n\n“The Second Coming” (1919)\n\nYeats also draws upon classical precedents of a sort in “The Second Coming,” widely regarded as one of the central poetic expressions of the intense sense of crisis that informs so much modernist literature. Here, however, Yeats draws on the Christian notion of the second coming of Christ, rather than on Greek or Roman precedents, to express his sense of the possible approach of an apocalyptic event. In many ways, this poem simply expresses a typical modernist sense that human history, in the wake of World War I, might have been approaching a crucial turning point, the current order on the brink of collapse and a new (possibly ominous) order about to begin. In an Irish context, it is worth remembering that the poem was written at a time when the Irish War of Independence was just underway, so that this sense of crisis was particularly tangible. At the same time, both the feel of this poem and some of its imagery draw upon Yeats’s particular interest in mysticism and the occult, studies in which had led him to conclude that human history unwinds in cycles of about two thousand years, one of which (which began with the birth of Christ) was coming to an end.\n\nThe Second Coming\n\nTurning and turning in the widening gyre\n\nThe falcon cannot hear the falconer;\n\nThings fall apart; the centre cannot hold;\n\nMere anarchy is loosed upon the world,\n\nThe blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere\n\nThe ceremony of innocence is drowned;\n\nThe best lack all conviction, while the worst\n\nAre full of passionate intensity.\n\nSurely some revelation is at hand;\n\nSurely the Second Coming is at hand.\n\nThe Second Coming! Hardly are those words out\n\nWhen a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi\n\nTroubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert\n\nA shape with lion body and the head of a man,\n\nA gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,\n\nIs moving its slow thighs, while all about it\n\nReel shadows of the indignant desert birds.\n\nThe darkness drops again; but now I know\n\nThat twenty centuries of stony sleep\n\nWere vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,\n\nAnd what rough beast, its hour come round at last,\n\nSlouches towards Bethlehem to be born?\n\n“Leda and the Swan” (1923)\n\nOne of the clearest uses of classical mythology occurs in the poem “Leda and the Swan,” which is also related to his vision of cyclical history. Here, in the very traditional form of a Petrarchan sonnet Yeats recounts a story directly from Greek mythology, in which the god Zeus takes the form of a swan and rapes the human woman Leda. The story has taken various forms over time, but, in one of the standard versions, the rape directly leads to Leda giving birth to Helen and Polydeuces, while at the same time giving birth to the human children (via her husband Tyndareus, King of Sparta) Castor and Clytemnestra. In telling the story of the rape, Yeats alludes to the way it ultimately led to the fall of Troy (thanks to Helen’s role in the event), as well as to the death of Agamemnon, in most versions killed by Clytemnestra. Since Clytemnestra was supposedly the daughter of Tyndareus, the poem thus implies that Clytemnestra’s killing of Agamemnon might have somehow been related to trauma she experienced during the rape. The poem then closes with one of the rhetorical questions that Yeats so favored during this period, wondering whether Leda might have taken on some of Zeus’s godlike knowledge and power as a result of the encounter.\n\nThe poem clearly depicts the rape of Leda as a sort of turning point in history and thus possibly as the beginning of the two-thousand-year cycle that “The Second Coming” suggests might have been ushered in by the birth of Christ. It is clear, in this shift of mythological referents, that Yeats does not mean for either attribution to be taken literally; each simply symbolizes the notion that history runs in cycles, landmark events initiating each new cycle. One is, of course, also free to give the poem a more contemporary political reading, seeing Leda as a symbol of Ireland and the swan/Zeus as a symbol of England and the British Empire, whose rule in Ireland had so recently ended, beginning another sort of new era.\n\nLeda and the Swan\n\nA sudden blow: the great wings beating still\n\nAbove the staggering girl, her thighs caressed\n\nBy the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,\n\nHe holds her helpless breast upon his breast.\n\nHow can those terrified vague fingers push\n\nThe feathered glory from her loosening thighs?\n\nAnd how can body, laid in that white rush,\n\nBut feel the strange heart beating where it lies?\n\nA shudder in the loins engenders there\n\nThe broken wall, the burning roof and tower\n\nAnd Agamemnon dead. Being so caught up,\n\nSo mastered by the brute blood of the air,\n\nDid she put on his knowledge with his power\n\nBefore the indifferent beak could let her drop?\n\n“Among School Children” (1926)\n\nIn 1926, while he was a member of the Irish Senate, Yeats toured a Montessori school in Ireland as part of his official duties. He recorded his impressions of the school and its students in a poem expands beyond these impressions to include another guest appearance by Maud Gonne, whom he imagines (in Stanzas II-IV) as a child the age of the children he sees in the school. This thought then leads him into a meditation in aging (especially his own), envisioning himself (as he would at several points in his later poetry) as a “comfortable kind of old scarecrow … Old clothes upon old sticks to scare a bird.” Along the way, he compares the inevitable disappointments that mothers experience from their children to the inevitable disappointments that nuns experience from their religion.[4] The poem then ends with a meditation on the relationship between art and the artists who produce it, closing with the famous line “How can you tell the dancer from the dance?,” which suggests the perfect achievement of an aesthetic vision, the poet at one with his poem.\n\nAmong School Children\n\nI\n\nI walk through the long schoolroom questioning;\n\nA kind old nun in a white hood replies;\n\nThe children learn to cipher and to sing,\n\nTo study reading-books and history,\n\nTo cut and sew, be neat in everything\n\nIn the best modern way—the children’s eyes\n\nIn momentary wonder stare upon\n\nA sixty-year-old smiling public man.\n\nII\n\nI dream of a Ledaean body, bent\n\nAbove a sinking fire, a tale that she\n\nTold of a harsh reproof, or trivial event\n\nThat changed some childish day to tragedy—\n\nTold, and it seemed that our two natures blent\n\nInto a sphere from youthful sympathy,\n\nOr else, to alter Plato’s parable,\n\nInto the yolk and white of the one shell.\n\nIII\n\nAnd thinking of that fit of grief or rage\n\nI look upon one child or t’other there\n\nAnd wonder if she stood so at that age—\n\nFor even daughters of the swan can share\n\nSomething of every paddler’s heritage—\n\nAnd had that colour upon cheek or hair,\n\nAnd thereupon my heart is driven wild:\n\nShe stands before me as a living child.\n\nIV\n\nHer present image floats into the mind—\n\nDid Quattrocento finger fashion it\n\nHollow of cheek as though it drank the wind\n\nAnd took a mess of shadows for its meat?\n\nAnd I though never of Ledaean kind\n\nHad pretty plumage once—enough of that,\n\nBetter to smile on all that smile, and show\n\nThere is a comfortable kind of old scarecrow.\n\nV\n\nWhat youthful mother, a shape upon her lap\n\nHoney of generation had betrayed,\n\nAnd that must sleep, shriek, struggle to escape\n\nAs recollection or the drug decide,\n\nWould think her son, did she but see that shape\n\nWith sixty or more winters on its head,\n\nA compensation for the pang of his birth,\n\nOr the uncertainty of his setting forth?\n\nVI\n\nPlato thought nature but a spume that plays\n\nUpon a ghostly paradigm of things;\n\nSolider Aristotle played the taws\n\nUpon the bottom of a king of kings;\n\nWorld-famous golden-thighed Pythagoras\n\nFingered upon a fiddle-stick or strings\n\nWhat a star sang and careless Muses heard:\n\nOld clothes upon old sticks to scare a bird.\n\nVII\n\nBoth nuns and mothers worship images,\n\nBut those the candles light are not as those\n\nThat animate a mother’s reveries,\n\nBut keep a marble or a bronze repose.\n\nAnd yet they too break hearts—O Presences\n\nThat passion, piety or affection knows,\n\nAnd that all heavenly glory symbolise—\n\nO self-born mockers of man’s enterprise;\n\nVIII\n\nLabour is blossoming or dancing where\n\nThe body is not bruised to pleasure soul,\n\nNor beauty born out of its own despair,\n\nNor blear-eyed wisdom out of midnight oil.\n\nO chestnut tree, great rooted blossomer,\n\nAre you the leaf, the blossom or the bole?\n\nO body swayed to music, O brightening glance,\n\nHow can we know the dancer from the dance?\n\n“Sailing to Byzantium” (1928)\n\nPlagued by declining health, Yeats retired from public politics after six years in the Irish Senate. He remained very active as a poet, however, devoting much of his final poetry to expressions of his acceptance of the aging process itself, which he often addressed with good humor. But he remained interested in other topics as well, including the process of poetry. A poem from 1928, “Sailing to Byzantium,” involves both aging and poetry, and is built around Yeats’s (somewhat Orientalist) vision of the ancient city of Byzantium (capital of the eastern branch of the Roman Empire, now known as Istanbul) as a utopian space where all aspects of human life were fused into a single, harmonious whole. Byzantium, in short, becomes a sort of image of poetry itself, a city where the visions of poets can be achieved. They cannot, however, be achieved easily, even there, and the journey to Byzantium (that is, poetic success) is not an easy one, especially for an aging poet like Yeats, now in his mid-60s.\n\nSailing to Byzantium\n\nI\n\nThat is no country for old men. The young\n\nIn one another’s arms, birds in the trees,\n\n—Those dying generations—at their song,\n\nThe salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas,\n\nFish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long\n\nWhatever is begotten, born, and dies.\n\nCaught in that sensual music all neglect\n\nMonuments of unageing intellect.\n\nII\n\nAn aged man is but a paltry thing,\n\nA tattered coat upon a stick, unless\n\nSoul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing\n\nFor every tatter in its mortal dress,\n\nNor is there singing school but studying\n\nMonuments of its own magnificence;\n\nAnd therefore I have sailed the seas and come\n\nTo the holy city of Byzantium.\n\nIII\n\nO sages standing in God’s holy fire\n\nAs in the gold mosaic of a wall,\n\nCome from the holy fire, perne in a gyre,\n\nAnd be the singing-masters of my soul.\n\nConsume my heart away; sick with desire\n\nAnd fastened to a dying animal\n\nIt knows not what it is; and gather me\n\nInto the artifice of eternity.\n\nIV\n\nOnce out of nature I shall never take\n\nMy bodily form from any natural thing,\n\nBut such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make\n\nOf hammered gold and gold enamelling\n\nTo keep a drowsy Emperor awake;\n\nOr set upon a golden bough to sing\n\nTo lords and ladies of Byzantium\n\nOf what is past, or passing, or to come.\n\n“The Circus Animals’ Desertion” (1939)\n\nOne of Yeats’s final poems begins with an expression of frustration at a period he had recently experienced in which he found that his poetic inspiration was beginning to leave him. The poem then turns into a retrospective on his own life and career, with another reference to Maud Gonne and to the way “fanaticism and hate” nearly consumed her. Finally, Yeats realizes that all the inspirations for his lofty poetry came from worldly sources, from his own humanity. His inspiration failing, he then has no choice but simply to be a human and to settle into the “foul rag and bone shop of the heart,” whence all his earlier inspiration came. There is, of course, a tremendous irony in the poem: it (in this sense resembling The Waste Land) is a brilliant poetic masterpiece about Yeats having lost the ability to produce brilliant poetic masterpieces.\n\nThe Circus Animals’ Desertion\n\nI\n\nI sought a theme and sought for it in vain,\n\nI sought it daily for six weeks or so.\n\nMaybe at last being but a broken man\n\nI must be satisfied with my heart, although\n\nWinter and summer till old age began\n\nMy circus animals were all on show,\n\nThose stilted boys, that burnished chariot,\n\nLion and woman and the Lord knows what.\n\nII\n\nWhat can I but enumerate old themes,\n\nFirst that sea-rider Oisin led by the nose\n\nThrough three enchanted islands, allegorical dreams,\n\nVain gaiety, vain battle, vain repose,\n\nThemes of the embittered heart, or so it seems,\n\nThat might adorn old songs or courtly shows;\n\nBut what cared I that set him on to ride,\n\nI, starved for the bosom of his fairy bride.\n\nAnd then a counter-truth filled out its play,\n\n`The Countess Cathleen’ was the name I gave it,\n\nShe, pity-crazed, had given her soul away\n\nBut masterful Heaven had intervened to save it.\n\nI thought my dear must her own soul destroy\n\nSo did fanaticism and hate enslave it,\n\nAnd this brought forth a dream and soon enough\n\nThis dream itself had all my thought and love.\n\nAnd when the Fool and Blind Man stole the bread\n\nCuchulain fought the ungovernable sea;\n\nHeart mysteries there, and yet when all is said\n\nIt was the dream itself enchanted me:\n\nCharacter isolated by a deed\n\nTo engross the present and dominate memory.\n\nPlayers and painted stage took all my love\n\nAnd not those things that they were emblems of.\n\nIII\n\nThose masterful images because complete\n\nGrew in pure mind but out of what began?\n\nA mound of refuse or the sweepings of a street,\n\nOld kettles, old bottles, and a broken can,\n\nOld iron, old bones, old rags, that raving slut\n\nWho keeps the till. Now that my ladder’s gone\n\nI must lie down where all the ladders start\n\nIn the foul rag and bone shop of the heart.\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] Scholars traditionally cite the Gabler edition of Ulysses by chapter number followed by line number, rather than the page numbers used with most texts.\n\n[2] For a useful discussion of this poem and its political context, see Bornstein.\n\n[3] Yeats would later write an entire poem about Countess Markievicz and her sister Eva, entitled “In Memory of Eva Gore-Booth and Con Markiewicz,” which describes the sisters as “two girls in silk kimonos, both beautiful,” further referring to Constance as a “gazelle.”"
