        "text": "January 4, 2015\n\nHere is why I find this book interesting and valuable: In a prefatory note, Yeats writes, \"...I am writing after many years and have consulted neither friend, nor letter, nor old newspaper, and describe what comes oftenest into my memory.\" This makes for an almost casual structure to the work and is something akin to sitting and listening to Yeats recollect as he pleases and not according to any outline or plan. The ideal reader of the book would be well-read in the history of Ireland in the late 19th and early 20th century. Lacking that, the book is still quite enjoyable and informative, and it contains passages of a singular beauty that one might only expect from a true poet writing in prose. One of the sections near the end of the book deals with Yeats winning the Nobel Prize in 1925, his traveling to Sweden to accept it, etc. I loved it that when he was informed in the middle of the night that he had been awarded the prize, he went to his cellar for a bottle of wine to open in celebration; finding none, he and his wife cooked sausages instead. How can one not appreciate a book where the author, a giant of literature, elects to include this delightful, homely detail?\n\nApril 29, 2020\n\nAfter reading this I'm so impressed with WBY and his achievements. However, I'm still left wondering about his love affair with Maude Gonne; but those questions I have will likely remain unanswered; a mystery for the ages.\n\nThis book was part of my ODWG Readathon 2020. ODWG stands for Old Dead White Guys, the target of so much ire and irrationality in our current literary world. In spite of their horrible reputation, I find that ODWG's quite frequently have some very insightful and inspiring stories to tell, so I still read them. Not only do I read them, but these days I seek them out purposely. Why? For the same reason I embraced punk fashion in 1978: because I like to shock and upset the rigid little minds of the uptight, stodgy and hopelessly narrow minded dump-puppets.\n\nMind you, I'm not exclusively reading only ODWG works; I also read books written by women, living persons and authors of non-white ethnicity, However, they must be quality and catch my interest in some way; I'm not an identity-based reader. If you are an identity based reader and intend to scold me for not being more inclusive in my reading habits, I have a suggestion: grab a hammer and head for the nearest beach; proceed to use the hammer to pack sand up you ass until it's quite full, then fuck off and die. Also, keep in mind that your scolding will likely have the opposite effect and in 2021 I will read only ODWG works, so maybe just keep it to yourself and mind your own fucking business for once.\n\nOctober 5, 2012\n\nThis is one of those books you want to chip away at. It's not really an autobiography, but an anthology of autobiographical essays, bits from journals, speeches, etc. That means Yeats assumes that any one reading these pieces will already have a vested interest in and familiarity with his subjects. He refers to contemporary people and political situations that average readers simply won't be familiar with. And his discussions of the various Theosophical initiatives are infused with metaphors and symbols that can be hard to follow. So if a reader wants to learn about WBY, best to start elsewhere.\n\nHowever, this is the writing of the man himself. It's wonderful. And it is still relevant. I wish politicians on both sides of the aisle would heed his warnings. Yeats laments the fact that the cause for Irish nationalism is whipped up more by hatred of the British than by a considered, logical approach to self-government. And he regrets that political leaders rely on the easy tactics of inciting the mob: \"The greater the enemy, the greater the hatred, and therefore the greater seems the power. They would give a nation the frenzy of a sect.\"\n\nIndeed!\n\nAugust 30, 2014\n\nEr... well, this is awkward. I love Yeats's Celtic Twilight. I love his poetry. I love his collections of Irish folklore. I haven't tried reading his plays yet. I thought I would give his autobiography a chance. I made it some 50 or 55 pages in before finally giving up. Sorry, Yeats, but your childhood really wasn't all that exciting...\n\nApril 18, 2009\n\nWhy don't college professors tell you that Yeats believed in magic when they have you read his poems? Kind of important. Don't ya think?\n\nJanuary 10, 2023\n\nEn la medida en que van pasando los años, decrece el interés por lo que le ocurre. Sin embargo, la selección de los episodios de si infancia y juventud son narrados con tal calidad narrativa que es fácil imaginar por qué significaron tanto en su proceso de conversión a poeta.\n\nEl libro carga con un pecado fundamental: no motiva a leer sus poemas, Aunque sí sus otros dos tomos autobiográficos.\n\nJuly 25, 2021\n\nIt made me suddenly feel the compelling need to study the classics, learn Latin, and \"get a real education\".\n\nApril 4, 2015\n\nThis book is not so much an intended autobiography as it is a collection of autobiographical writings that cover a large portion of the great poet's life. As such, there is some repetition of incidents, but they are individually and collectively instructive as there are nuances revealed about the writer in his reactions and opinions at the stage of life when the comments were penned. The same can be said about the friends, acquaintances and family members mentioned in the writings. An evolutionary portrait of Yeats emerges from the network of writings, illuminating for the careful and critical reader. While I would have appreciated more introspective comments about his own poetry, such as the geneses of the particular poems and the personal significance of the the symbols and archetypes used, I gained a great deal of insight into the poet as man, which allows me to re-read the poems with a new appreciation of the mind and intellect behind them.\n\nJuly 7, 2023\n\nHad a little attack of A.D.D while reading this and had to just not read for a while. This is a good read. You get a picture of Ireland and Irish issues during Yeats's time. A couple hilarious incidents and fascinating characters. I laughed a little too hard at other little kids calling Yeats \"Doctor Death\" or if not that something like that because because he was so sickly and pale as a child. Some of the content was lost to me for just being a little boring and too long ago to have much relevance, but if you love Yeats, you won't mind this one. Was happy he included one of my favorite Tennyson lines from In Memoriam \"man may rise on stepping-stones of his dead selves to higher things.\"\n\nJanuary 14, 2011\n\nMr. Yeats definitely lived in some interesting times. It's probably a good thing to know something about Ireland from that time to better appreciate the book but one can still enjoy it for what it is. My only wish was that he would of talked more about his involvement with the Golden Dawn. He touched on meeting Mathers and being involved with him and some of his own experiments but that's it.\n\nDecember 10, 2012\n\nan excellent collection of work to cobble together to make an autobiography. worth reading just for the journal extracts 2/3 of the way in."
