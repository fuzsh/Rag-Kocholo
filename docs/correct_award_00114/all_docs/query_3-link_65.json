        "text": "ABOUT THE POET\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats was born on June 13, 1865, in Dublin, Ireland, the oldest child of John Butler Yeats and Susan Mary Pollexfen. Although John trained as a lawyer, he abandoned the law for art soon after his first son was born. Yeats spent much of his early years in London, where his father was studying art, but frequently returned to Ireland as well. In the mid-1880s, Yeats pursued his own interest in art as a student at the Metropolitan School of Art in Dublin. Following the publication of his poems in the Dublin University Review in 1885, he soon abandoned art school for other pursuits.\n\nAfter returning to London in the late 1880s, Yeats met writers Oscar Wilde, Lionel Johnson and George Bernard Shaw. He also became acquainted with Maud Gonne, a supporter of Irish independence. This revolutionary woman served as a muse for Yeats for years. He even proposed marriage to her several times, but she turned him down. He dedicated his 1892 drama The Countess Cathleen to her. Around this time, Yeats founded the Rhymers' Club poetry group with Ernest Rhys. He also joined the Order of the Golden Dawn, an organization that explored topics related to the occult and mysticism. While he was fascinated with otherworldly elements, Yeats's interest in Ireland, especially its folktales, fueled much of his output. The title work of The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems (1889) draws from the story of a mythic Irish hero.\n\nIn addition to his poetry, Yeats devoted significant energy to writing plays. He teamed with Lady Gregory to develop works for the Irish stage, the two collaborating for the 1902 production of Cathleen Ni Houlihan. Around that time, Yeats helped found the Irish National Theatre Society, serving as its president and co-director, with Lady Gregory and John Millington Synge. More works soon followed, including On Baile's Strand, Deirdre and At the Hawk's Well.\n\nFollowing his marriage to Georgie Hyde-Lees in 1917, Yeats began a new creative period through experiments with automatic writing. The newlyweds sat together for writing sessions they believed to be guided by forces from the spirit world, through which Yeats formulated intricate theories of human nature and history. They soon had two children, daughter Anne and son William Michael.\n\nThe celebrated writer then became a political figure in the new Irish Free State, serving as a senator for six years beginning in 1922. The following year, he received an important accolade for his writing as the recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature. According to the official Nobel Prize website, Yeats was selected \"for his always inspired poetry, which in a highly artistic form gives expression to the spirit of a whole nation.\"\n\nYeats continued to write until his death. Some of his important later works include The Wild Swans at Coole (1917), A Vision (1925), The Tower (1928) and Words for Music Perhaps and Other Poems (1932). Yeats passed away on January 28, 1939, in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France. The publication of Last Poems and Two Plays shortly after his death further cemented his legacy as a leading poet and playwright.\n\nTEXT\n\nThe unpurged images of day recede;\n\nThe Emperor’s drunken soldiery are abed;\n\nNight resonance recedes, night walkers’ song\n\nAfter great cathedral gong;\n\nA starlit or a moonlit dome disdains\n\nAll that man is,\n\nAll mere complexities,\n\nThe fury and the mire of human veins.\n\nBefore me floats an image, man or shade,\n\nShade more than man, more image than a shade;\n\nFor Hades’ bobbin bound in mummy-cloth\n\nMay unwind the winding path;\n\nA mouth that has no moisture and no breath\n\nBreathless mouths may summon;\n\nI hail the superhuman;\n\nI call it death-in-life and life-in-death.\n\nMiracle, bird or golden handiwork,\n\nMore miracle than bird or handiwork,\n\nPlanted on the star-lit golden bough,\n\nCan like the cocks of Hades crow,\n\nOr, by the moon embittered, scorn aloud\n\nIn glory of changeless metal\n\nCommon bird or petal\n\nAnd all complexities of mire or blood.\n\nAt midnight on the Emperor’s pavement flit\n\nFlames that no faggot feeds, nor steel has lit,\n\nNor storm disturbs, flames begotten of flame,\n\nWhere blood-begotten spirits come\n\nAnd all complexities of fury leave,\n\nDying into a dance,\n\nAn agony of trance,\n\nAn agony of flame that cannot singe a sleeve.\n\nAstraddle on the dolphin’s mire and blood,\n\nSpirit after Spirit!

According to Yeats, the Christian Byzantium which influences the scene after the fall of Rome was an ideal place of culture and wisdom. In the poem, “Sailing to Byzantium”, the poet faces the old age and wishes to forget his decaying body and educate his soul for immortality. Yeats’ whole life has been devoted to create everlasting pieces of art and he imagines that after death his soul will be a golden bird resting in the Emperor’s palace.\n\nSTANZA WISE SUMMARY\n\nStanza 1:\n\nThe poet says that Ireland is not a proper place for old men because they get tangled into some sensual music which abstains them from achieving artistic ageless accomplishments of the intellect. The dying generation of birds and young lovers celebrate are against the natural cycle of death and birth. The young lovers are in each other’s arms, the birds are in the trees and the fishes and fowls all sing one same song-the song of the senses. All these at the same time, are creatures who are subjected to death.\n\nStanza 2:\n\nThe poet says that Ireland being a country not good for old men who are otherwise a petty thing decaying along with their physical powers. The only substitute for them is to have their soul educated in a way that it starts to clap its hands and sing out loud. The newly learnt song of the soul makes it to rejoice and become louder and louder as the physical powers of the old men go bad to worse. The poet says that the only difficulty is to find such a singing school where the soul can get educated, because every singing school in the country of Ireland is concerned with studying monuments of its own significance rather than caring for monuments of unageing intellect. Therefore, as the poet does not find the right school to educate his soul, he travels across the seas and reaches the holy city of Byzantium.\n\nStanza 3:\n\nThe poet addresses the sages who were standing in god’s holy fire in Byzantium. He tells them that the way they are standing, the same way a figure stands in gold mosaic work of a wall. He asks them to climb down from their present spiritual position and become the poet’s educators of his soul so that his soul can learn the right kind of song. The first thing that the poet wants the sages to do is to purify his heart which is heavy with animal instincts and is sick with physical lusts. Once his heart has been purified, it will be easier for the poet to do what his heart most wants i.e. lead him into the artifice of eternity. The poet wants to be a part of those things which are beyond the cycle of birth and death.\n\nStanza 4:\n\nIn the final stanza, poet says that once he is out of the cycle of nature, he will seize contact with natural things-the physical world. The poet wants to take a form that is of golden shape and has golden enameling. This can be done by the Grecian goldsmiths who will construct a golden bird who could sing to the Emperor to keep him awake. He wants to be a golden bird of eternity so that he is set on a golden bough in the court of Byzantium and he would sing songs of all times, the present, past and future to the Lords and Ladies of Byzantium. The poet’s song will be different from the sensual music of the dying generations and he will sing of the monuments of unageing intellect.\n\nBROAD QUESTIONS\n\nGive a critical appreciation of the poem.\n\nThe poem was written in 1930 after a lapse of about four years from the date of his writing the poem entitled Sailing to Byzantium. Byzantium is apparently a sequel to the Sailing to Byzantium. In the interval between 'Sailing to Byzantium' and the present poem, the poet had further developed intellectually. Byzantium, therefore, is naturally an improvement upon the earlier composition, Sailing to Byzantium.\n\nByzantium was the capital of the Eastern wing of the Holy Roman Empire. It was famous for its mosaic art and gold enameling. But in this poem Byzantium is not a city of concrete reality. It is a creation of the mind which exists in imagination only. It is a place beyond the world of teeming millions, free from the limitation of time and space.\n\nBoth are the poems of escape from a world of flux to a kingdom of permanence and in both the poet is trying to solve a personal problem. In the first he seeks to quell the desires troubling his heart in old age, while in the second he 'wanted to warm himself back to life' after a severe illness which brought him very close to death.\n\nThe poem opens in the silence of the night, when the great song of St. Sophia has announced the time appropriate to spiritual meditation and divine revelation. The images of daytime, such as the drunken soldiers of the king, reminiscent of the savage British soldiers terrorizing the Irish peasantry, stained with the blood and fury of the busy day light. The noises and images peculiar of the night in a great city, such as the song of night-walkers and brawl of the revelers have also melted in the calm atmosphere. The poet is now, face to face with the Great Dome of St. Sophia, which suddenly assumes the aspect of the sky, bedecked with the light of the moon and stars and looking down upon the human life on the earth with multiplicities, love and hate, strife and confusion, peculiar to the everyday life of men and women.\n\nAs the poet contemplates the Dome of 'Divine wisdom' with a secret desire to explore its mysteries, he describes an image floating before him. It is faint and vague, a shadow in comparison with a concrete human body, but an image when compared to a shade. The poet keeps its identity deliberately vague as Milton does in the case of the description of Death in Paradise Lost. This much is clear that it is one of the spirits from the Land of the Dead, which like the 'Sages in God's holy fire' in 'Sailing to Byzantium' can retrace their steps and come to the earth, which they have left behind. They have become purged of the memories of the earthly life which were woven round them like the 'mummy cloths' round the Egyptian mummies or the skein of thread round the bobbin. This spirit, with a mouth without moisture or breath can summon other ghosts from Hades as the Shade of Tiresias does in Homer's Kingdom of the blessed to help Ulysses. The poet needs a guide to lead him to the various regions of the kingdom of the dead. Such guidance was prescribed by all the mystic and occult systems.\n\n'Shade' appears to be incorporeal spirit, but with certain properties of communication; Image would seem to be the shade in a more or less materialized condition. The poet hails the superhuman guide, who is antithetical to man, living the life of the man's death and the death of man's life, and starts on his pilgrimage under the felt presence of this spirit.\n\nThe third stanza presents the vision of heaven, and the golden bird here, more a 'miracle' than 'an artifice' planted on the starlit golden branch of the mystic tree, is a purified soul. Its substance is gold, the purest and imperishable substance in alchemy, the symbol of the transmuted soul. It is a bird not made by the hand of man, but hammered into shape on the divine smithy in purgatory.\n\nThe fourth stanza unrolls the spectacle of purgatory, where the souls are flitting about like flames of fire, which is unearthly. It is not the fire raised by faggot for the burning of martyrs, nor the one struck by the steel in friction. It is the unearthly fire of purgatory, which no storm can disturb and which purges the soul into the likeness of flame as described by Dante in his Divine Cometly. To this place of purgation come the spirits from the human world and undergo the process of the gradual liberation through \"dreaming back\". This dreaming back, in which the soul reviews all its memories, sins and experiences, is represented by a dance which, at times, is marked by 'an agony of trance', where the soul burns in the eternal fire of remorse. This fire of agony which consumes the spirits is internal, not external; it burns the heart of the sinner but cannot burn 'a sleeve'. In this sense the flames or the fire-like souls are begotten of flames, that is the flame raging in their minds. The flame which covers them is the flame issuing out of their own minds.\n\nIn the last stanza the poet has reached the brink of purgatory and can catch a clear view of the vast ocean of time-and-space-bound life through which 'blood-begotten' spirits are seen moving forward on the backs of dolphins, the proverbial escorts of souls to the kingdom of the dead. The scene has been familiarized by artists as well as the makers of the Roman tombs. But dolphins themselves are also the symbols of earthly love, 'of the mire and blood' of the mortal life and as such belong to the element of the ocean, which they are traversing. The flood of life beats upon the borders of 'the smithy', where the souls are purged and shaped and the water of life cannot penetrate; while, on the marble floor, where the souls 'dance in an agony of trance' they are gradually divested of 'that flaming shirt' that agonizing and cohesive stain of the fury, passion and lust of life which human hand cannot remove. The dancing images are begetting fresh images of their life experiences in the process of 'dreaming back'. Each memory comes back as an image in a dream. In the last line the poet has come back to the shores of the ocean of life, which is agitated by the conflicting claims of flesh and spirit, the extremities between which the moral man swings like a pendulum.\n\nGive a critical appreciation of the poem.\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats’s “Byzantium” is a companion poem to “Sailing to Byzantium” and it chronicles the city of Byzantium towards the end of the first Christian Millennium. It has in fact the same theme that the reader encounters in another of Yeats’s poem, “The Second Coming”.\n\n“Byzantium” pays tribute to the miracle of the work of art; the poem itself has overcome the “bitter furies of complexity”. The complexity of human flesh is turned into the artifact which preserves it and thus evokes the poet’s immortality in his art.\n\n“Byzantium” is bursting with imagery of permanence and immortality in art. While the city of Byzantium stands as the backdrop to all its violent contrasts, the poet indulges in the exploration of death and the wisdom of the past. The mosaics depict the spiritual experience stabilized by the knowledge and technique of the artist that ignite the flame of artistic creation.\n\nThe notion of permanence is fully delineated by the invocation of the nightingale, the traditional symbol of permanence as described in Keats’s poem. The goldsmith’s art can thus give the permanence and significance in life unattainable by flesh.\n\nAt night in the city of Byzantium, “The unpurged images of day recede.” The drunken soldiers of the Emperor are asleep, and the song of night-walkers fades after the great cathedral gong. The “starlit” or “moonlit dome,” the speaker says, disdains all that is human” All mere complexities, / the fury and the mire of human veins.” The speaker says that before him floats an image a man or a shade, but more a shade than a man, and still more simply “an image.” The speaker hails this “superhuman” image, calling it “death-in-life and life-in-death.” A golden bird sits on a golden tree, which the speaker says is a “miracle”; it sings aloud, and scorns the “common bird or petal / and all complexities of mire or blood.”\n\nAt midnight, the speaker says, the images of flames flit across the Emperor’s pavement, though they are not fed by wood or steel, nor disturbed by storms. Here, “blood-begotten spirits come,” and die “into a dance, / and agony of trance, / And agony of flame that cannot singe a sleeve,” leaving behind all the complexities and furies of life. Riding the backs of dolphins, spirit after spirit arrives, the flood broken on “the golden smithies of the Emperor.” The marbles of the dancing floor break the “bitter furies of complexity,” the storms of images that beget more images, “That dolphin-torn, that gong-tormented sea.”\n\nThe pronounced differences in “Byzantium”’s line lengths make its stanzas appear very haphazard; however, they are actually quite regular: each stanza constitutes eight lines, and each rhymes AABBCDDC. Metrically, each is quite complicated; the lines are loosely iambic, with the first, second, third, fifth, and eighth lines in pentameter, the fourth line in tetrameter, and the sixth and seventh line in trimeter, so that the pattern of line-stresses in each stanza is 55545335.\n\nYou might have read Yeats’s account of “Sailing to Byzantium”; now he has arrived at the city itself, and is able to describe it. In “Sailing to Byzantium” the speaker stated his desire to be “out of nature” and to assume the form of a golden bird; in “Byzantium,” the bird appears, and scores of dead spirits arrive on the backs of dolphins, to be forged into “the artifice of eternity” ghostlike images with no physical presence. The narrative and imagistic arrangement of this poem is highly ambiguous and complicated; it is unclear whether Yeats intends the poem to be a register of symbols or an actual mythological statement.\n\nIn any event, we see here the same preference for the artificial above the actual that appeared in “Sailing to Byzantium”; only now the speaker has encountered actual creatures that exist “in the artifice of eternity “most notably the golden bird of stanza three. But the preference is now tinged with ambiguity: the bird looks down upon “common bird or petal,” but it does so not out of existential necessity, but rather because it has been coerced into doing so, as it were “by the moon embittered.” The speaker’s demonstrated preoccupation with “fresh images” has led some critics to conclude that the poem is really an allegory of the process by which fantasies are rendered into art, images arriving from the “dolphin-torn, the gong-tormented sea,” then being made into permanent artifacts by “the golden smithies of the Emperor.” It is impossible to say whether this is all or part of Yeats’s intention and it is difficult to see how the prevalent symbols of the afterlife connect thematically to the topic of images. For all its difficulty and almost unfixed quality of meaning the poem is difficult to place even within the context of A Vision the intriguing imagery and sensual language of the poem are tokens of its power; simply as the evocation of a fascinating imaginary scene, “Byzantium” is unmatched in all of Yeats.\n\nWrite an essay on the reflections in then poem.\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats was born at Sandymount, a Dublin suburb on June 13, 1865. His father John Butler Yeats, a Protestant was friendly with Henry Irving and later members of The Pre-Raphaelite school of painters. Yeats, naturally influenced by his father, studied art for a short while only to abandon it later. His real interest lay in composing poetry. In the beginning he imitated Shelley, Spenser, Rossetti and Morris.\n\nHe is regarded as the national poet of Ireland and the irish background contributed to the major themes of his poetry. Yeats’s poetic career can be roughly divided into four phases: i) Romantic phase (1882 – 1907) ii) The Realistic Phase (1907 – 1917) iii) the symbolic or the visionary phase (1917 – 1928) iv) The phase of Calm (1928 – 1939)\n\nYeats attains fame with The Wanderings of Oision (1889) which features Celtic mythology. The award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to him in 1924 only proves his poetic genius excelling in symbols and mysticism. The country that speaker is in does not suit the old. It is full of bounty, with fish in the water and birds in the trees. The young and reproductive are caught in the earthy cycle of life and death. They do not heed ageless intelligence. An old man can be mere pathos. To escape this fate and to get away from his too vital country, the aged speaker has sailed to Byzantium. Once arrived, he calls out to the elders who are part of God’s retinue. He asks them to move in a gyre and take him away to death.\n\nHe has a living heart fastened to a dead body, and as such cannot live. Once the speaker has died, his body will no longer be organic, but fashioned of metal, like the statues that preserve dying emperor, or perhaps instead molded into a mechanical bird, which will sing to the lords and ladies to Byzantium. This is Yeats’ most famous poem about aging a theme that preoccupies him throughout The Tower.\n\nThe idea of elders waiting upon God is not familiar from any Western religion, but would be acceptable under theosophy, which holds that all spiritualities hold some measure of truth. Yeats imagines this process as being consumed by a healing fire that will allow his body to take on any form he wishes when it is finished. His first wish, to become a statue, seems too static.\n\nHis second, to become a mechanical bird, alludes to the Byzantine Emperor Theophilus. Theophilus according to legend had just such mechanical birds. It is thus the poet’s wish to be granted a body immune to death and to sing forever. This poem is written after four years of his writing the poem entitled “Sailing to Byzantium”. The poem Byzantium is parallel to Sailing to Byzantium. Both poems are the poems about escape from a world of flux to the kingdom of permanence. The former is a proper presentation of an ideal state beyond life but the latter describes the voyage to the country of the mind.\n\nThe opening lines of the poem take us to the scene of night in Byzantium, the ancient capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. All unpleasant images faded away. The soldiers in inebriated condition went bed. The prostitute’s song inviting customers has stopped. Only the dome of the Cathedral of St. Sophia announces spiritual aspirations, looking down upon man’s complexities, feelings, passions and confusion.\n\nIn the second stanza, he introduces the Persona who sees before him an image, man or shade and concludes it can be an image more than a shade. The spirit longs for liberation from the cycle of birth and rebirth. This is evident in the appearance of the ghost from the land of the dead dressed in mummy-cloth. The ghost with no moisture and breath calls the other spirits. The Persona salutes the arrival of the spirit, in its elemental form. It is dead in life as it is a ghost. This superhuman shape is alive, free from all and so it experiences life-in-death.\n\nIn the third stanza, he elaborately describes the permanence of art as represented by the golden bird. This golden bird is not made by any goldsmith. It is a miracle and therefore superior to any natural bird or flower which grows and dies, or any artificial bird which again changes. The miraculous golden bird planted on the golden branch is a powerful symbol of changelessness and permanence. It looks down upon the moon. This bird can crow like the cocks of Hades, the land of the dead. The golden bird is scornful of the conflicting emotions and passions of the human heart.\n\nIn the fourth stanza, Byzantium is presented as purgatory. At midnight on the Emperor’s pavement, immaterial flames, not made by friction of steel with steel nor of burning wood, appear undisturbed by winds. Here the spirits from the world after their death come leaving all their complexities, feelings and passions. The flames purify the spirits as they die in a purgatorial dance getting into a trance. This purifying flame does not harm anything that is material. It only does the function of purifying the spirits.\n\nIn the last stanza, the dolphins are believed to be carriers of the spirit from the world to the land of the dead according to the mythology. Spirits one after another arrive riding on the backs of dolphins. The flood of life beats against the smithies and they destroy the water of life filled with complexities and conflicting feelings and passions of human heart. The spirits are thus purified through the purgatorial dance. The ocean is agitated by the struggle between the flesh and spirit, as it brings about fresh images of their life experience.\n\nExamine the metaphysical aspect of the poem.\n\nW. B. Yeats seems to emphasize that it is only human body which dies but the spiritual body that is the very soul will be last forever. In his poem Sailing to Byzantium in which Yeats imagines his soul after his body’s death, as golden bird in the Emperor’s palace, singing of all times-past, present and future.\n\nOn the other hand, Yeats’ reluctance to accept the orthodox Christianity is also reflected in his belief in Samsara, the cycle of life which belongs to the Hinduism doctrine. And this belief was reflected in Yeats’ poem “Sailing to Byzantium.”\n\nIn this stanza, Yeats described that in that country the dying generations of birds and young lovers celebrate things which are a slave to the natural cycle of birth and death. The young lovers who are in each other’s arms, the birds who are in the trees and the salmon falls and the mackerel-crowded seas, fish, flesh and fowl all sing only one song the song of the senses. All these at the same time, are creatures that are very much subject to death.\n\nIn fact, Yeats’ belief in the afterlife was much influenced by the Hinduism or Buddhism. Hinduism is doctrinally tolerant and includes many different, even contradictory beliefs, but in spite of the immense regional and sectarian variations of religious, beliefs and practices, there are certain essential characteristics that are typical of the Hindu view of life. One of the most distinctive features is the belief in Samsara, the revolution of birth, death, and rebirth, understood as a cycle of transmigration from one living form into another. This belief is not found in the Vedas but it is first mentioned in the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad where it is said that after death a human being may be reborn in transmigration which is closely related to a cyclical view of life and of the universe.\n\nIt is also connected with the belief in Karma, which denotes both an action and its good or bad effect. The karma is accumulated through the acts done in a previous life in a determining factor towards the condition of the present life, which in turn affects the rebirth in the next life. Such an overall balance in Karma can help explain injustices and suffering as well as good fortune in a person’s life. The law of Karma governs the universe and all beings within it. It acts in personally and binds each individual soul to the work and in addition to the cycle of transmigration.\n\nAll world existence is subject to the cycle of Samsara, which is thought of as having neither beginning nor end. In other words, The Indian view of man is certainly a sophisticated estimate. It maintains that the individual self, or atman, is really identical with Brahman, the source or principal of existence. But owing to a vidya, or ignorance, the atman believes itself to be an individual self-conscious person. In turn it takes the phenomenal world for reality, and involves itself in it. Consequently, it becomes subject to the process of time, which is manifested in unceasing cycles of creation and destruction, for the Atman or self this means Samsara, or rebirth, which is likewise a ceaseless process of dying and being reborn, with all the attendant suffering. Together with Samsara operates the law of Karma, which causes the Atman to work out in each incarnation the consequences of its actions in past incarnate lives. This process conditions the form of each of the several periods of rebirth. Thus, according to the Indian doctrine, at any given moment every living being is in the state of fortune, be it good or ill, which his past Karma has entitled. However, this situation is not hopeless and Hinduism, in its various forms, offers a way of deliverance.\n\nBasically this involves the effective apprehension of its own true nature by the man. Such apprehension implies the recognition, as the Chandagya Upanishad tersely puts it, that the self of mine within the heart, this is Brahman. But the recognition is not just a mental act, it if is to be effective, it involves an effort to abstract the self from fatal attachment to existence in this world, which it has taken for reality. Such abstraction is difficult and can be achieved only by a hard discipline. When moksa salvation is finally achieved, individual existence in this world ceases, and the atman absorbed into Brahman as a drop of rain merges into the sea.\n\nActually reincarnation may not be universal. The intensity of a man’s faith may ultimately determine what happens to his soul in the next world.\n\nSHORT QUESTIONS\n\nWrite a note on the poet.\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939) was an Irish poet and dramatist, and one of the foremost figures of 20th century literature. A pillar of both the Irish and British literary establishments, in his later years Yeats served as an Irish Senator for two terms. He was a driving force behind the Irish Literary Revival, and along with Lady Gregory and Edward Martyn founded the Abbey Theatre, serving as its chief during its early years. In 1923 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for what the Nobel Committee described as “inspired poetry, which in a highly artistic form gives expression to the spirit of a whole nation.”\n\nExamine the concept of death and afterlife in W.B.Yeats \"Byzantium\" and \"Sailing to Byzantium\"\n\nEvery soul shall have a taste of death. That brings us to a question of what death really is. Generally speaking, the basic concept of the process so called death is build up on the facts that this process starts when the heart stop its work to pump the blood which leads to the brain damage and the failure of the whole systems of human body. When all the system or the functions of human organs are out of work, the body itself becomes lifeless or dead.\n\nFurthermore, according to the religious points of view, being dead, as we mention above does not mean that the journey of human soul has come to an end. On the contrary once the soul left the body, it will transform into another living form and will live until the judgment day arrives.\n\n“When all sequence comes to an end, time comes to an end, and the soul puts on the rhythmic or spiritual or luminous body and contemplates all the events of its memory and every possible impulse in an eternal possession of itself in one single moment. That condition is alone animate, all the rest is fantasy, and from thence came all the passions, and some have held, the very heat of the body”.\n\nApart from religious definition of death above, in fact Yeats is neither orthodoxy religious nor orthodoxy scientific. He has his own science, which is an occult one, and his own religion or sophisticated lower mythology and in prose he sometimes reconciles them at the level of mystic. His tolerance in religions resulted in inconsistent and ambiguous attitude as reflected in his Byzantium and Sailing to Byzantium.\n\nGive a conclusion to poem.\n\nWilliam B. Yeats is one of the English poets who is so interested in oriental mystical religion, especially those which are concerned with the concept of the afterlife in the form of Reincarnation. Yeats believes that after death human soul will go through relieving its earthly life and will be purified in purgatory. All the evil deeds in human soul will be cleansing so that the soul becomes good and pure again and after that the soul will be united with the body again and he rebirth to lead on earthly life. All the evil deeds and good deeds done in the previous life will done in the previous life will determine the condition of the present life, be it good or bad.\n\nThe above concept of Yeats no doubt is idealized by him from mixing up the two doctrines: Christian and Hinduism. In fact there is no incarnation in Christian doctrine of man. When a man dies he will go for spiritual journey to heaven as suggested by the title Sailing to Byzantium. But W. B. Yeats is so impressed and influenced by Hinduism and may be his love for earthly life so he wants to be incarnated.\n\nComment on the matter of death in the poem.\n\nThe matter of death, according to Christian doctrine of man, God created human souls to be immortal, but placed them in physical bodies with which they become essentially connected. At death, the soul left the body and was immediately judged. For the majority of mankind this judgment resulted in the soul’s consignment to purgatory, to expiate its sins. At the second coming of Christ, the decomposed bodies of the dead would be reconstituted and their soul would reenter them for the final judgment. The Christian doctrine of man involved the doctrine of original sin. It was taught that Adam had implicated all his descendants in his original act of disobedience to his creator. Consequently, all subsequent generation deserved of God’s wrath from the moment of birth, quite apart from the guilt the later acquired by their own actual sins. Being thus a fallen race, mankind was predisposed to evil. This meant, according to Christian theologians, that man wasn’t only unable to save himself from the state of perdition into which he was born; but he could not even desire to repent without God’s grace. This means that God provided salvation for mankind is expounded in the doctrine of the Atonement, and constitutes an essential part of the foundational teaching of Christianity. Through the atonement, those who repented of their sins and accepted Christ as their savior could hope that, after enduring the cleansing fire of purgatory, they would be reunited with their bodies, and justified at the last judgment, would pass on to the eternal bliss.\n\nDiscuss the Symbolism in W. B. Yeats’ “Byzantium”.\n\nOne of the most captivating things about W.B. Yeats' poetry in general and \"Byzantium\" in particular is its rich symbolism. Symbols are essentially words which are not merely connotative but also suggestive, evocative and emotive. Symbols conjure before the mind's eye a host of images attached to them.\n\nThings that are difficult to explain or are inexpressible can be conveyed through symbols. \"Byzantium' is indeed a laudable attempt at bringing together aesthetics, spiritualism, symbolism, and mysticism together on one common platform. The effect is both revealing and enthralling. The epic exploration of the other world brings into perspective, the question of life in death and death in life.\n\nThe poet symbolically leaves the world of limitations to usher into a world of permanence and artistic eternity. Tired of life's agonizing existence, the poet seeks recluse and relief in death and beyond.\n\nW.B. Yeats' \"Byzantium\" is a highly symbolic poem. It contains variety of symbols. While some symbols in this poem are easy to understand as they come from W.B.Yeats' stock arsenal, other are complex and obscure. The resonant, sonorous and glittering quality of these symbols makes \"Byzantium\" a visual and acoustic treat.\n\nYeats writes in his essay \"The symbolism of Poetry\", \"All sounds, all colours, all forms, either because of their preordained energies or because of long association, evoke indefinable and yet precise emotions\". Not all symbols that Yeats uses are 'emotional symbols'. He points out, \"there are intellectual symbols, symbols that evoke ideas alone, ideas mingled with emotions”.\n\nThe deft use of these symbols in \"Byzantium\" enhances the reality of the present and mystery and richness of the past.\n\nW.B. Yeats interweaves several different threads in \"Byzantium\", thereby granting the symbols richness and intricacy. Byzantium was the capital of the eastern Wing of the Holy Roman Empire. It was known for its works of art; especially mosaic work and gold enameling. In W. B. Yeats' poem Byzantium ceases to have its traditional meaning. It typifies a world of artistic magnificence and permanence.\n\nIt is a world of immortality beyond limits of time and space. It also denotes a place of unity; spiritual or otherwise. Richard Ellman writes, \"Byzantium is a holy city, because it is the capital of Eastern Christendom, but it is also Yeats's holy city of the imagination as Golgonooza was Blake's.\n\nThe resplendent transcendental world Yeats visualizes in \"Sailing to Byzantium\" now gets replaced by the images of a dreary, dark and ghostly place; full of phantoms, 'mire and blood'.\n\n\"Byzantium\" has three key-symbols in the poem; the Byzantine dome, the golden bird perched on the golden bough and the flames of mosaic on the Emperor's pavement. All three put together stand for the culmination of achievement in art. Being classic works of art they also symbolize immortality and eternity.\n\nDiscuss the mix of Hinduism and Christian doctrines in the poem.\n\nTo the Christian the cycle of birth-death-rebirth, is broken by Christ’s atoning sacrifice. Faith in its redemptive power not only dissolves the bonds of Satan but also releases the soul from the wheel of eternal return.\n\nW. B. Yeats in his poem Sailing to Byzantium and Byzantium, however, described his belief in reincarnation or the cycle of birth and at the same time he also reflected his belief in the purification of soul in purgatory. Thus, the writer tends to regard Yeats’ attitude towards the concept of the afterlife is in between the Hinduism’s doctrine and the Christians’.\n\nThe two stanzas describe Yeats’ symbolic opinion of the need of suffering and purification. Life is full of complexities of misery or blood. But the process of purification is an agony of trance. This idea of his is in agreement with the Christian’s doctrine. On the other hand, Yeats clearly expresses his idea of reincarnation or the cycle of birth in the last stanza of the poem Byzantium.\n\nW.B.Yeats presents the scene of Purgatory in his poem Byzantium as a place where the souls are purified by an unearthly and endless fire. And spirits from the physical world and by dreaming their former experiences expatiate for their sins. This internal fire of remorse and repentance purifies these spirits. After purgation, the souls become pure again and would be reunited with the flesh and blood and be rebirth again. And this is what he believes as the continuing cycle or reincarnation of human life.\n\nUnlike the Christian belief that after the purgation the souls will reunited with their bodies, and justified at the last judgment, would pass on to the eternal bliss.\n\nThus, as a Christian, Yeats attitude towards death is a very ambiguous one. It seems that he wants to compare between his belief and Buddhism/Hinduism, in contracting moods, two-apparently quite contradictory kinds of assurance: one, that we are in fact bound, as the Buddhists tell us the great wheel of existence shall reappear upon this stage in various roles again and again:\n\nThe other that, as the Buddhists/Hindus also tell us, we can escape ultimately from the great wheel not to nonbeing, a concept that never attracted Yeats, but to some kind of timeless perfection. He was not sure that he really wants to escape from the wheel. Thus, in the face of his Symbolic phantasmagoria, he retains the freedom of inconsistency. His images of a Byzantine heaven in which he would be transformed into a golden bird symbolize his desire to escape from the disorder, the irony, the failure of life; but so also other symbols as when he says he would like to live again, even in a foul ditch, as a blind man battering blind man stand for a craving for life at any level, the lust and rage of which he speaks in his last poems, that grew stronger in him as he grew older. Often he hates life for not being perfection. Sometimes, also, he rears perfection for not being life.\n\nGive a description of the opening stanza.\n\nIn this first stanza, the description is of night and the great gong of St. Sophia’s cathedral has declared that it is the time suitable and exact for spiritual meditation. The images of the drunken soldiers who are asleep remind the savage British soldiers who used to torment and torture the Irish peasantry. He says that the noise of the great gong of the cathedral has subdued the noise of the night walkers and their songs. The dome of the cathedral which the poet faces is looks as decorated with the stars and is looking at the human life of earth. The human life which is the combination of confusion and chaos is looked by this dome and it disdains this life. The starlit is the reference to the cathedral that is dislikes that entire human possesses, the cathedral is contemptuous towards the nature and feelings of humans. It does not contemplate human and his intricacies. The cathedral stands here for spirituality while man stands for modernist perspective.\n\nVERY SHORT QUESTIONS\n\nWhat is the most disorienting in the poem?\n\nThe poem is pretty much a wildly disorienting poem. If the speaker for the two Byzantium poems is the same, the question. It looks like the speaker reached Byzantium and found it vastly different than he'd imagined. He isn't redeemed from old age; he's transformed into a bodiless observer of the weird happenings in the city. He is passive and entranced by the arcane energy around him.\n\nHow is the speaker impacted?\n\nThe speaker isn't having much of an impact on his world and he's not introducing any order to it. There's very little order, period, the Emperor of Byzantium never physically appears, and his agents are less than imposing.\n\nState the two differences of the sailing of the bird.\n\nIn \"Sailing,\" the bird was the speaker's ideal self: a beautiful and permanent piece of interactive art that could predict the future. But now the bird is immobile on its perch and shows a disdain, bordering on hatred, for living things, those \"complexities of mire and blood\".\n\nWhat is the most disturbing aspect of the poem?\n\nThe most disturbing aspect of this whole poem is the fact that the speaker does not even seem to notice that everything surrounding him is inescapably wrong. From what little information is given, he seems content. But although the speaker doesn't feel his own plight, the reader gets a strong sense that Byzantium is a place where individuals can be trapped by the supernatural and fall into “an agony of trance” until there is no hope and no thought of breaking free.\n\nWhen the poet did write the poem?\n\nYeats wrote the poem Byzantium four years after he had written the poem Sailing to Byzantium Byzantium's is almost parallel to sailing to Byzantium through both poems the poet presents an escape from a world of flux into the kingdom of permanence in the first poem sailing to Byzantium's there is a description of the voyage to the country of mind whereas the second foe in Byzantium presents an ideal state which happens to be beyond life summary of the poem in the opening stanza of the poem.\n\nWhat description of night do you find in the poem?\n\nThere is the description of the night when the great gong of St. Sophia has announced that it is the right time for spiritual meditation the images of the drunken soldiers of the King remind us of the savage British soldiers who used to torment and torture the Irish peasantry.\n\nWhat noises and the images the speaker speaks about?\n\nThe noises and the images which the speaker talks about in the poem represent the daytime activities in a great city. The speaker talks about the night walker’s song in the bra of the revelers and says that their noises have been subdued by the sound of the great gong.\n\nWhat does the speaker come face to face with?\n\nThe speaker comes face to face with the huge dome of St. Sophia and the dome begins to look like the sky that is decorated with the light of moon and stars which are looking down upon the human life of the earth there is a lot of confusion and chaos on the earth multiplicities like love-hate strife and confusion are the part of the everyday human life through the second stanza of the poem.\n\nGive an introduction to the poem.\n\nByzantium presents an ideal state for humans which are beyond human life. The poet describes this poem as “Byzantium as it is the system towards the end of the first Christian millennium. A walking mummy flows at the street corners where the soul is purified, birds of hammered gold singing in the golden tree, in the bower, offering their backs to the wailing dead that they may carry them to Paradise.”\n\nWhat does the poet say about night?\n\nThe poets says that it this time of the night when it is a right time for meditation and he has entered to the spiritual city of the Byzantium a vision appears before him. He gets confused after seeing the vision because it seems like a man and a shadow. Whether it a shadow or a man, the poet seems baffled in deciding about. Shade more than man, more image than a shade this shade which means a spirit is more than a man in appearance as its outlook and the composure is more than a man.\n\nFrom where the spirit has come?\n\nThe spirit which has come from the region of death has unwound the coffin cloth and threw away all the impurities and has become a purified spirit which has been through purgatory.\n\nHow has the poet compare life and death?\n\nThe poet explains this spirit and says that this image of spirit is very lifeless because it does not breathe; it is in no current of life. But at the same it seems an immortal being as well. So the poet calls it life in death and death in life image or spirit.\n\nWhat is the illusion of the human body?\n\nHe sees an image of human body but it appears to be a shade. He says that this image is more like a shade. He praises this superhuman because it has come to take him to the spiritual city of Byzantium. The poet feels the presence of this Great Spirit at the start of hid pilgrimage as very encouraging.\n\nWhat is the miracle the poet says about?\n\nThe poet says that he says a miracle. He sees a golden bird but promptly says that is something else than a bird. It is unusual bird golden bird ‘set upon a golden bough’ which Yeats has described in his earlier poem\n\nWhat specialty of the bird is mentioned in the poem?\n\nHe says that this bird can crock like the crow which has come from the region of death and scorn other birds of petals and all the changes which flesh means mortal beings are destined to pass through. So this bird is spiritual and is casting away the material impurities.\n\nWhere is the depiction of heaven in the poem?\n\nThe stanza depicts the description of the heaven. He sees the golden bird and calls it a miracle; it is planted on the golden branch of the mystic tree. The bird is made up gold which is the purest substance and it demonstrates that the bird is a purified soul. The bird here is used as a symbol of purified souls and is given a divine shape by the great artisans of heaven.\n\nHow are the spirits related to the fire?\n\nThe spirits are purified from all the complexities in this fire. They come out as purified spirits. Then these spirits begin their dance of purgatory because they are about to be purified. This dance ends in a soothing joy and peace. And in the end these spirits are purified.\n\nWhat is the role of the fire?\n\nThe fire is lit which is not caused by burning wood or friction of steel with the pavement. The spirits are being passed through this purgatory fire in order to get purified. This fire is heavenly and the main purpose of this fire is to cast away all the impurities and complexities of the souls.\n\nWhat is the summary of the poem?\n\nIn this stanza, the poet finds himself close to purgatory. He sees that blood begotten spirits are moving towards this fire in the back of dolphins. The poet describes the shore of ocean of life in the last line. It is a conflict between flesh and spirit. It symbolizes the state of man between life and after life.\n\nWhat is the theme of immortality in the poem?\n\nThe poem seems to express a desire to escape from the decay and tedium of cyclical nature. He wants to transform his own consciousness and find mystical union with the golden mosaics of a medieval empire.\n\nWhen was the poem published?\n\nIt was written in 1930 and published in The Winding Stair and other Poems.\n\nComment on the structure of the poem.\n\nThe poem comprises of 5 stanzas of 8 each. The meter in not regular. The first, second, third, fifth and eighth line of each stanza follow iambic pentameter. The fourth lines follow tetrameter and the sixth and seventh follow iambic trimeter. The rhyme scheme is AABBCDDC.\n\nWhat is Byzantium?\n\nByzantium is a description of the city that bears the name and is also a symbol of paradise as well as purgatory. Byzantium is the old name of Constantinople or Istanbul which was once the capital of the Roman Empire.\n\nWhat does the poem stand for?\n\nThe poem stands for the need of suffering and purification. The golden bird symbolizes the eternity and glory of art like the dome mentioned in the first stanza. The poem presents an escape from a world of flux to a kingdom of permanence.\n\nSo what exactly did Yeats write about Byzantium?\n\nYeats wrote two poems about İstanbul that have become classics in the Western literary canon: “Sailing to Byzantium” and the later “Byzantium.” The first poem uses an imagined journey to Byzantium to meditate on mortality, spirituality and artistic legacy, among other themes. The poet escapes a country of youth neglecting the “monuments of unageing intellect” around them and travels to Byzantium, seeking some form of eternal paradise.\n\nHow famous are these poems, really?\n\nAs far as poetry goes, “Sailing to Byzantium” is one of the most commonly referenced poems ever put to paper. It begins with the line “That is no country for old men,” famously adapted as the title of a Cormac McCarthy novel that later became an Oscar-winning Coen brothers movie. Another line describing a human as a soul “fastened to a dying animal” has become a oft-quoted vision of mortality. Beyond these are countless references in novels, films and other works.\n\nSo if he never visited the city, where did Yeats get his inspiration to write about Byzantium?\n\nYeats was a student of classical life, mythology and art, basing his understanding on works such as Edward Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. He also viewed Byzantine art during a trip to Italy and heard further accounts from his friend Oscar Wilde. In terms of personal inspiration, he is famous for practicing “automatic writing,” which meant opening his mind to divine inspiration and simply acting as a scribe for the words and images that came to him.\n\nThat all sounds extremely unreliable. Was his description of the city accurate?\n\nThe answer to that is subjective, of course, and critics have made a small industry out of pointing out the discrepancies between Yeats’s vision and the historical reality. On the other hand, the sense of dizzying imagery blending the ancient and the modern he evokes in “Byzantium” is a pretty resonant account of what it’s like to be in Istanbul. But accuracy was far from the writer’s goal. The poem is most often understood as using a physical journey as a metaphor for a spiritual one."
