        "text": "William Butler Yeats, born 13 June 1865, died 28 January 1939, was an Irish poet and playwright, and one of the foremost figures of 20th century literature. Yeats was born in Sandymount, County Dublin, a member of the Anglo–Irish ruling class. Raised in County Sligo, as a member of the Protestant Ascendancy, he grew up during a time of political and social change in Ireland which, even though supportive of the nationalist revival, directly disadvantaged his heritage.\n\nThe revival of strong and popular Irish nationalism fueled by the ancient literature, songs and stories of the Gaels took hold of his generation. Finding inspiration in this literature, he wrote from the same wellspring and developed with others of his generation what would be remembered as the Irish Renaissance. He gave voice to an ancient people searching for its place in the modern world, and with this new voice, that place was secured.\n\nHe was a driving force behind the Irish Literary Revival, and along with Lady Gregory, Edward Martyn and George Moore, in 1899 established the Irish Literary Theatre (the Abbey Theater) in Dublin for the purpose of performing plays highlighting Irish authors in both Irish and English languages. Yeats served as its director during its early years.\n\nIn 1923 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his inspired poetry. He was the first Irishman so honored.\n\nFrom the very foundations of Irish civilization, words have been the cords that give voice to the direction we follow. Whether Irish Gaelic or English, whether spoken or written, the Irish love of verse and prose is as strong today as in ancient times when “men of letters” held a distinct and honored place at the top of society.\n\nThe Council of Irish Associations of Greater Bergen County is honored to present an annual award to an outstanding individual whose contributions in the field of literature defines their inheritance from the ancient Gaels to a modern people taking its part on the world stage and giving voice to the Irish experience.\n\nCormac O’Malley dabbled in Irish American cultural affairs from the start of his legal professional career on Wall Street in 1970. He was Honorary Librarian for the American Irish Historical Society working in their library, and worked for four years at the Irish American Cultural Institute’s 14-day New York blitz of Irish history and culture in their Irish Fortnight program. He was active with the American Committee for Ulster Justice seeking Congressional Hearings on Northern Ireland. They were held in late February 1972 after the terrible events of Bloody Sunday that January.\n\nHe also helped create the Irish American Bicentennial Corporation celebrating the Irish role in the American Revolution with modern cultural activities for two years. In 1976, he was founding secretary for the Ireland Fund which later became the successful American Ireland Fund.\n\nCormac’s mother, Helen Hooker, was an American artist, sculptor and photographer. Cormac managed her legacy with exhibitions, writings and books for 30 years. Cormac spent time in Mexico, Belgium and England for 15 years before returning to NYC. In 1992 he joined the Board of Glucksman Ireland House. He was its first President, helping create their American Journal for Irish Studies. He managed their Archives for Irish America. Cormac founded the non-profit American Friends of the Arts in Ireland which supports six national cultural institutions in Dublin. He joined the Board of Irish American Cultural Institute in Morristown, NJ.\n\nCormac was his father’s literary executor, publishing 13 books. In recent years these have related to what he calls his “father’s unfinished work,” books he might have published or re-edited. His father Ernie O’Malley died at the early age of 59, when Cormac was 14 years old. The books relate to the Irish War of Independence and Civil War, in which Ernie played a significant role, but also include his letters, diaries and photographs.\n\nTerry Golway is a writer and historian of the Irish-American experience. He has written more than a dozen books, including The Irish in America, Irish Rebel, For the Cause of Liberty, So Others May Live, and Machine Made: Tammany Hall and the Creation of Modern American Politics.He was a columnist for the New York Observer and The New York Times, and currently is a senior editor at Politico and a columnist for The Irish Echo.

Her acclaimed 2009 novel Galway Bay, based on the history of her Irish-American family, spans six generations and universalizes the Irish-American experience as it stretches from the Famine and the resulting mass emigration to the American Civil War, the building of Chicago, and finally the Irish Revolution.\n\nBorn and raised in Chicago, Mary Pat Kelly attended NYU Film School, received her PhD from the City University of New York, and has taught at City College and LaGuardia Community College. She worked in Hollywood as a screenwriter for Paramount and Columbia Pictures, and in New York as an associate producer for Good Morning America(1976) and Saturday Night Live (1980-82).\n\nShe later produced a number of award-winning PBS documentaries, including: To Live for Ireland (1986), a portrait of John Hume and the Social Democratic and Labor Party; The Yanks in Ireland (1992), which told the story of U.S. forces in Northern Ireland during WWII, and which was accompanied by a book; and Proudly We Served: The Men of the USS Mason (1995), also accompanied by a book, which told the story of the only African-American sailors to take a WWII warship into combat, and whose first foreign port was Belfast. She also wrote and directed the feature film Proud (2004), based on the USS Mason story, which stars Ozzie Davis and Stephen Rea.\n\nAs a member of the film industry, she authored two books on one of America’s premier filmmakers—Martin Scorcese: The First Decade (1978) and Martin Scorese: A Journey(1990).
