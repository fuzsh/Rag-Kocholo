        "text": "An Irish Airman Foresees His Death\n\nI know that I shall meet my fate Somewhere among the clouds above; Those that I fight I do not hate Those that I guard I do not love; My country is Kiltartan Cross, My countrymen Kiltartan's poor, No likely end could bring them loss Or leave them happier than before. Nor law, nor duty bade me fight, Nor public men, nor cheering crowds, A lonely impulse of delight Drove to this tumult in the clouds; I balanced all, brought all to mind, The years to come seemed waste of breath, A waste of breath the years behind In balance with this life, this death.\n\nThe Arrow\n\nI thought of your beauty, and this arrow, Made out of a wild thought, is in my marrow. There's no man may look upon her, no man, As when newly grown to be a woman, Tall and noble but with face and bosom Delicate in colour as apple blossom. This beauty's kinder, yet for a reason I could weep that the old is out of season.\n\nThe Dolls\n\nA doll in the doll-maker's house Looks at the cradle and bawls: \"That is an insult to us.\" But the oldest of all the dolls, Who had seen, being kept for show, Generations of his sort, Out-screams the whole shelf: \"Although There's not a man can report Evil of this place, The man and the woman bring Hither, to our disgrace, A noisy and filthy thing.\" Hearing him groan and stretch The doll-maker's wife is aware Her husband has heard the wretch, And crouched by the arm of his chair, She murmurs into his ear, Head upon shoulder leant: \"My dear, my dear, O dear, It was an accident.\"\n\nThe Falling of the Leaves\n\nAutumn is over the long leaves that love us, And over the mice in the barley sheaves; Yellow the leaves of the rowan above us, And yellow the wet wild-strawberry leaves. The hour of the waning of love has beset us, And weary and worn are our sad souls now; Let us patt, ere the season of passion forget us, With a kiss and a tear on thy drooping brow.\n\nThe Cat and the Moon\n\nThe cat went here and there And the moon spun round like a top, And the nearest kin of the moon, The creeping cat, looked up. Black Minnaloushe stared at the moon, For, wander and wail as he would, The pure cold light in the sky Troubled his animal blood. Minnaloushe runs in the grass Lifting his delicate feet. Do you dance, Minnaloushe, do you dance? When two close kindred meet. What better than call a dance? Maybe the moon may learn, Tired of that courtly fashion, A new dance turn. Minnaloushe creeps through the grass From moonlit place to place, The sacred moon overhead Has taken a new phase. Does Minnaloushe know that his pupils Will pass from change to change, And that from round to crescent, From crescent to round they range? Minnaloushe creeps through the grass Alone, important and wise, And lifts to the changing moon His changing eyes.\n\nInto the Twilight\n\nOut-worn heart, in a time out-worn, Come clear of the nets of wrong and right; Laugh, heart, again in the grey twilight, Sigh, heart, again in the dew of the morn. Your mother Eire is always young, Dew ever shining and twilight grey; Though hope fall from you and love decay, Burning in fires of a slanderous tongue. Come, heart, where hill is heaped upon hill: For there the mystical brotherhood Of sun and moon and hollow and wood And river and stream work out their will; And God stands winding His lonely horn, And time and the world are ever in flight; And love is less kind than the grey twilight, And hope is less dear than the dew of the morn.\n\nBrown Penny\n\nI whispered, \"I am too young,\" And then, \"I am old enough;\" Wherefore I threw a penny To find out if I might love. \"Go and love, go and love, young man, If the lady be young and fair.\" Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny, I am looped in the loops of her hair. O love is the crooked thing, There is nobody wise enough To find out all that is in it, For he would be thinking of love Till the stars had run away And the shadows eaten the moon. Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny, One cannot begin it too soon.\n\nThe Rose in the Deeps of his Heart\n\nAll things uncomely and broken, All things worn-out and old, The cry of a child by the roadway, The creak of a lumbering cart, The heavy steps of the ploughman, splashing the wintry mould, Are wronging your image that blossoms A rose in the deeps of my heart. The wrong of unshapely things Is a wrong too great to be told; I hunger to build them anew And sit on a green knoll apart, With the earth and the sky and the water, Remade, like a casket of gold For my dreams of your image that blossoms A rose in the deeps of my heart.\n\nThe Ragged Wood\n\nO, hurry, where by water, among the trees, The delicate-stepping stag and his lady sigh, When they have looked upon their images Would none had ever loved but you and I! Or have you heard that sliding silver-shoed Pale silver-proud queen-woman of the sky, When the sun looked out of his golden hood? O, that none ever loved but you and I! O hurry to the ragged wood, for there I will drive all those lovers out and cry O, my share of the world, O, yellow hair! No one has ever loved but you and I.\n\nTo a Child Dancing in the Wind\n\nDance there upon the shore; What need have you to care For wind or waters roar? And tumble out your hair That the salt drops have wet; Being young you have not known The fools triumph, nor yet Love lost as soon as won, Nor the best laborer dead And all the sheaves to bind. What need have you to dread The monstrous crying of the wind? Has no one said those daring Kind eyes should be more learnd? Or warned you how despairing The moths are when they are burned, I could have warned you, but you are young, So we speak a different tongue. You will take whatevers offered And dream that all the worlds a friend, Suffer as your mother suffered, Be as broken in the end. But I am old and you are young, And I speak a barbarous tongue.\n\nSolomon and the Witch\n\nAnd thus declared the Arab lady: \"Last night where under the wild moon On grassy mattress I had lain me, Within my arms great Solomon, I suddenly cried out in a strange tongue Not his, not mine.\" And he that knew All sounds by bird or angel sung Answered: \"A crested cockerel crew Upon a blossoming apple bough Three hundred years before the Fall, And never crew again till now, And would not now but that he thought, Chance being at one with Choice at last, All that the brigand apple brought And this foul world were dead at last. He that crowed out eternity Thought to have crowed it in again. A lover with a spider's eye Will found out some appropriate pain, Aye, though all passion's in the glance, For every nerve: lover tests lover With cruelties of Choice and Chance; And when at last the murder's over Maybe the bride-bed brings despair, For each an imagined image brings And finds a real image there; Yet the world ends when these two things, Though several, are a single light, When oil and wick are burned in one; Therefore a blessed moon last night Gave Sheba to her Solomon.\" \"Yet the world stays\": \"If that be so, Your cockerel found us in the wrong Although it thought it worth a crow. Maybe an image is too strong Or maybe is not strong enough\" \"The night has fallen; not a sound In the forbidden sacred grove, Unless a petal hit the ground, Nor any human sight within it But the crushed grass where we have lain; And the moon is wilder every minute. Oh, Solomon! Let us try again.\"\n\nLove Song\n\nMy love, we will go, we will go, I and you, And away in the woods we will scatter the dew; And the salmon behold, and the ousel too, My love, we will hear, I and you, we will hear, The calling afar of the doe and the deer. And the bird in the branches will cry for us clear, And the cuckoo unseen in his festival mood; And death, oh my fair one, will never come near In the bosom afar of the fragrant wood."
