        "text": "January 23, 2024\n\nOnce again another book I’m counting as read despite not having read this book specifically. So, I’ve read like ten or so Yates pomes as were studying him along with other Irish writers in my Irish lit elective I’m taking in college, and After reading and analyzing at least ten of his short one to three pager pomes from the internet I feel it’s only fair I count one of his pome collection books as read toward my reading goal this year, since I imagine some of the poems read in class probably overlap with what’s featured in here anyway.\n\nI would say my official review for this book is 3.5 stars, but alas we can’t give half stars on Goodreads so four stars it is since Yeats to me is above deserving three stars.\n\nI do quite like his poetry but some poems he’s written I like less than others. Most of his work evokes Irish nationalistic themes, themes of solitude, chaos and political strife during the Irish civil war period and birds and nature imagery, also magic and Irish myths.\n\nI quite like how he writes poetry and he’s clearly a very skilled poet. Most interesting in his works and life is how into Irish myths and magic he was. If you read up on the man you’ll find he studied magic and was almost what one could consider pagan or Wicca but if paganism and Christianity fused together that would be Yeats beliefs, since he believed in the god of Christianity naturally as an Irishman but he thought of god through a spiritual and mystic magical lens typical in that of paganism beliefs minus the multiple gods aspect, interestingly enough. You can see that in a lot of poems when he makes reference to some magical divined higher power evocative of Jesus or god but in a more mythical sense. Or when he makes reference to many Irish folktales.\n\nThe only reason I lower his rating to 3.5 stars is because Well I think he’s a good poet I don’t agree with some of the political beliefs he puts into his poetry such as that extremism Is bad, or being too strong with your beliefs, Is bad.\n\nAlso I find if you study his poetry and read enough of it you can notice he contradicts himself or almost seems to have a change of views slightly because he went through many different phases and beliefs even being praised for how his work continues to evolve from flowery prose poetry to more blunt and to the point poetry as he’s praised for being able to change his style and continue to experiment both with viewpoints and styles throughout his writing which is said to be helpful for writers to avoid becoming stale. Yet to me it also means that if you like one style of voice Yeats uses it may only be evocative in a couple of his poems then the next couple may feel tonally different in some ways that could make them weaker, or stronger depending on which style of his you like best. I think this is also why many of the poetry collections from what I’ve gathered tend to organize his poetry into sections or phases of his life as each phase really is him writing in a different style or with shifting views as he continued to explore different ideas politically and styles writing wise."
