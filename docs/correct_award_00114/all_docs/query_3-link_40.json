        "text": "This true story begins provocatively: “Ada Ríos grew up in a town made of trash.” And in fact, as the Author’s Note at the end of the book explains, Ada’s town, Cateura, is the main garbage dump for Asunción, the capital and the largest city of Paraguay in South America. NPR has reported that every day, about 3 million pounds of solid waste get dumped in Cateura. The author of this book observes:\n\n“More than twenty-five hundred families – twenty thousand people – live there on less than two dollars a day. They endure fourteen-hour days picking through the trash in the landfill to find things they can recycle and sell.”\n\nAda was worried what the future could possibly hold for her and her younger sister Noélia. Then her grandma saw a sign posted by Favio Chávez, an environmental engineer assigned to Cateura to teach recyclers safety methods. He was offering music lessons to children, and Grandma signed up both the girls. Unfortunately, there were not enough instruments for all the children who were interested. Chávez asked his friend Nicolás Gómez, a talented carpenter in the community, to help make instruments for his group out of materials reclaimed from the landfill.\n\nSoon there were enough instruments for all, and the kids worked hard to learn how to play them. They were determined to succeed, and “the Recycled Orchestra was born!”\n\nAs Ada and her thirty-nine fellow musicians became more skilled, they were invited to perform concerts throughout Paraguay and later even in other countries around the world. The story ends with their performance in Bogotá, Colombia with a rock band, for which they were to be the opening act. The audience cheered for them:\n\n“The astonished kids bowed, grinning at one another. They had discovered the surprise waiting in the landfill. Buried in the trash was music. And buried in themselves was something to be proud of.”\n\nBack matter includes the Author’s Note as well as links for more information, including videos. We learn that the orchestra has performed concerts all over the world and have played for a number of world dignitaries, including Pope Francis. NPR notes that the group plays Mozart, Paraguayan folk music, even Frank Sinatra. And the young musicians have backed up artists like Stevie Wonder, Metallica and Megadeth.\n\nThe author adds in her note that the orchestra has swelled to two hundred students, with more than twenty-five instructors.\n\nChavez stated that the result of the orchestra’s success is more than just the music they make:\n\n“What we have achieved is that in the community, children are respected. And respect for the moment that they need to get an education. It’s something sacred. Before, it wasn’t like this. Before I gave music classes, the mom or dad would take the kid away by the hand because they had to go to work. Today, that’s unthinkable, impossible for it to happen. And we’ve already achieved the most difficult thing, which is to change the community.”\n\nIllustrator Sally Wern Comport said in an interview that she considers herself a “visual interpreter” for the narrator of a story. Indeed, in her digitally enhanced collages she conveys hope, engagement, transformation, and excitement as the kids of Cateura turn themselves into an orchestra.\n\nEvaluation: What a wonderful story about how hope, inventiveness, and working together can change even the worst of circumstances and make dreams come true.\n\nRating: 4.5/5\n\nPublished by Simon & Schuster Books for Young Readers, 2016\n\nNote: There are necessarily spoilers for previous books in this series.\n\nAlthough this is the 17th book in this series, C.S. Harris does an outstanding job of providing enough background in every book – without making it seem tedious or out of place – so that any of the books could be read as standalones.\n\nThe Sebastian St. Cyr historical crime fiction series began with the first book set in 1811, the year that George, Prince of Wales (known by the public as “Prinny”) began his nine-year tenure as Regent of the British Monarchy. (A prince regent is a prince who rules in the place of a monarch who is still the titular king but has been deemed unfit for any reason, such as age, or physical or mental incapacity. In this case, the Prince of Wales was standing in for his father George III, thought to be mad. On the death of his father in 1820, the Prince Regent became George IV.)\n\nThe Regency Era is a popular setting for fiction. For one thing, these were very interesting times historically. Most of Europe was at war, for and against Napoleon, depending on the year. Social mores were in an uproar as well: the rights of both women and slaves were being debated everywhere. And the conflict between the classes, especially in England, proved to be rich fodder for romantic plots. [You may also wish to consult my post on “An Introduction to the Regency Era.”]\n\nIn this installment, it is now the spring of 1815, and Sebastian St. Cyr, Viscount Devlin, is in his early 30s, has been married for three years to Hero, and has a two-year-old son Simon. Devlin is heir to the powerful Earl of Hendon, but is not actually Hendon’s son. His mother Sophie had an affair, and left her husband and children when Devlin was 11. His father told them the lie that Sophie was lost at sea. When Devlin finally learned the truth, he was determined to find her and also discover who his real father was.\n\nAs this story begins, Devlin and his family have come to Paris where his mother, calling herself Sophia Cappello, was said to be living. He does indeed find her – she is dying, having been stabbed and thrown over a bridge at the tip of the Île de la Cité. She lived just long enough to whisper to him her recognition by uttering “Sebastian.”\n\nDevlin finds out that Sophia had been living with her lover of many years, General Alexandre McClellan, one of Napoleon’s generals. Devlin bears a remarkable resemblance to the picture of McClellan in Sophie’s house. But he sets that insight aside for the nonce; his priority is finding out who killed Sophie and why.\n\nHis investigatory efforts are set in the chaotic world of a changing France, where a Bourbon king, Louis XVIII, is in power and Napoleon has been exiled to Elba. Ominously, Devlin learns Sophie had recently traveled to Elba. Could that have had something to do with her murder?\n\nThe political quagmire through which Devlin has to wade is complex and dangerous. As Devlin reflected:\n\n“…the people of this land had risen up against the grinding inequality and injustice of their age, only to lose their way in a morass of hatred, bloodshed, and terror . . . . the reimposition of the oppressive rule of the Bourbons made a brighter, more just future seem somehow less likely than ever….”\n\nThe author, who has a PhD in nineteenth-century European history, guides us through the machinations of the powerful (and those aspiring to be powerful) so that readers learn a great deal of history while Devlin is trying to solve the crime. I especially loved the ongoing account, parallel to Sebastian’s story, of Napoleon’s progress through France after returning from Elba; it had its own elements of suspense and excitement.\n\nEvaluation: I love the recurring characters in this series and their evolving interactions. In addition, one always learns a great deal of well-researched history about this fascinating and horrifying period, with a number of crimes thrown in to add tension and interest. This series is entertaining, educational, and well worth delving into.\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nPublished by Berkley, an imprint of Penguin Random House, 2022\n\nThe subtitle, “The True Story of the Grandmother of Juneteenth,” refers to Opal Lee, who was born in Texas in 1926. As we learn in the back matter, her grandfather, the son of an enslaved mother, taught Opal about how Texas did not receive the news of emancipation (signed January 1, 1863) until over two years after it happened. It was June 19, 1865 when a Union general arrived in Galveston Texas and related Lincoln’s order to free the slaves. As the author explains: “This day of freedom is called Juneteenth, a word that combines June, and nineteenth.\n\nOpal Lee led a movement to make Juneteenth a national holiday. From 2016 – at age 90! – to 2020, she went across America collecting signatures for a petition to the US Congress. Finally, when Joe Biden became US President and Opal was 94, legislation was signed to make Juneteenth a national holiday commemorating the end of American slavery.\n\nShe has good memories of Juneteenth celebrations, except for, as the author relates in her voice, the year 1939, when an angry mob burned down her family’s brand-new house. She later said, “I learned a big lesson that Juneteenth Day. Freedom is a golden coin. Struggle makes it shine.”\n\nIllustrator Keturah A. Bobo has filled the book with uplifting images.\n\nBack matter includes a Juneteenth timeline, Author’s Note, list of sources, and a recipe for “Juneteenth Red Punch Strawberry Lemonade,” often served at Juneteenth celebrations. (Accompanying a recipe for an alcoholic version of that drink, Edouardo Jordan explains in the “New York Times”:\n\n“Red drinks are a staple at Juneteenth gatherings for African-Americans across the U.S. The color is a reminder of the red kola nuts and bissap (commonly known as hibiscus tea), which made their way to the Americas as part of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.”\n\nAnother New York Times article on traditional foods for Juneteeth notes, “Red foods are customary for Juneteenth, the crimson a symbol of ingenuity and resilience in bondage.”\n\nCulinary historian and food writer Michael Twitty, in his blog Afroculinaria, proposes that red represents the fact that “enslavement narratives from Texas recall an African ancestor being lured using red flannel cloth, and many of the charms and power objects used to manipulate invisible forces required a red handkerchief.”\n\nThis article on Juneteenth Day includes a number of recipes of red foods to celebrate with, including BBQ sauce, watermelon salad, red rice, and red velvet cake.\n\nPublished by Tommy Nelson, an imprint of Thomas Nelson, 2022\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats, the Irish poet, dramatist, writer and one of the foremost figures of 20th-century literature, was born in County Dublin, Ireland, on June 13, 1865. Yeats was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923. He died in 1939.\n\nAlthough Yeats’ family moved back and forth between Dublin and Ireland, Yeats closely identified with the history and culture of Ireland. He once wrote, “I understand my own race and in all my work, lyric or dramatic, I have thought of it … I shall write for my own people, whether in love or hate of them matters little, probably I shall not know which it is.” (Herbert Howarth, The Irish Writers, 1880-1940, 1958, p. 111) His writing influenced the Irish nationalist movement, as well countless artists of all kinds, but especially literary artists.\n\nThis lovely book about the influences upon, and influences of, the poetry of William Butler Yeats seeks, as Declan Kiberd wrote in the “Dublin Review of Books,” “to restore the full poetic and personal context to many famous lines. . . . The result is one of the most beautiful and enjoyable books on Yeats ever to call forth the skills of a gifted designer and of a true critic. . .” I would concur.\n\nBut this book is not only about Yeats and those he influenced; it is also about the appeal of poetry generally. Hassett writes in the Introduction, “poems can encapsulate a sentiment that cannot be grasped or expressed in any other way.” He quotes John Keats’s statement that a poem “should strike the reader as a wording of his own highest thoughts, and appear almost a remembrance.”\n\nDividing the short chapters into themes, such as “Loving,” “Marrying,” “Hospitable Places,” and “Growing Old,” Hassett examines in detail phrases from Yeats’ work, showing throughout how poetry can capture and clarify the essence of life. He explains what various poem excerpts meant to Yeats, what they meant to readers, and in particular, what they meant to other writers, including James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, Virginia Woolf, Sylvia Plath, Wallace Stevens, T.S. Eliot, Joan Didion, and Seamus Heaney, among others.\n\nMany of the passages have to do with Yeats’ unrequited love for Maud Gonne, “the apple on the bough most out of reach.”\n\nYeats’ striking reaction to the events of the early 20th century, as expressed most memorably in “Things Fall Apart,” receives perhaps the most extensive treatment by Hassett, since that poem has had such extraordinary staying power and continued relevance. Hassett notes, for example, that the morning after the UK electorate voted for “Brexit,” i.e., leaving the European Union, the line “The centre cannot hold” “was tweeted or retweeted 499 times….” Users of twitter can do a search for other lines, like “slouching toward Bethlehem,” or just the name “Yeats,” and they will come up with numerous hits.\n\nQuoting Fintan O’Toole, Hassett concurs that “Yeats’s brilliance lay in his ability to turn . . . immediate anxieties into words that seem capable of articulating every kind of epic political disturbance.” Hassett also jokes, “Lines from ‘The Second Coming’ are pressed into service so often that it has been proposed that they be retired.” Hassett avers that Yeats’ poetry “illustrates Walter Pater’s dictum that ‘success in life’ is to achieve ‘some mood of passion or insight or intellectual excitement’ that is ‘irresistibly real and attractive’ and will ‘burn always with this hard, gem-like flame.’”\n\nAside from limning the roiling political climate, Yeats’s descriptions of ordinary experiences, Hassett maintains, “invites the reader to seek the same transcendence in the everyday, the same sacralizing of secular experience.” Nobel Prize winner poet Seamus Heaney, often mentioned in this book, was highly influenced by Yeats, especially in Yeats’ exaltation of the commonplace. Yeats’ overall intent, Heaney averred, was to impose an imaginative vision atop reality, “to clear a space in the mind for the miraculous, for all kinds of rebellion against the tyranny of physical and temporal law.” (For how this inspired Heaney, see, for example, Heaney’s transcendent account of memories of doing tasks with his mother “In Memoriam M.K.H., 1911-1984, Section 3,” or “Lightenings viii” in which he suggests “marvelous” is in the eye of the beholder.)\n\nIn Hassett’s penultimate chapter, “On Facing Death,” he remarks that Yeats had the belief that his life would not terminate, but rather, enter a new phase. Indeed, he notes that in W.H. Auden’s elegy, Yeats “became his admirers” and was “scattered among a hundred cities.” Hassett contends that Yeats lives on not only in the endurance of his work for his readers, but through the works of all of his successors. Ronald Schuchard, in “The Legacy of Yeats in Contemporary Irish Poetry” (Irish U. Review, Vol 34, No. 2, 2004) quotes Derek Mahon and Peter Fallon as declaring “Among the contours of modern Irish poetry the work of Yeats is Everest.” This book illustrates the attempts of just a sampling of successors who have tried to scale those metaphorical heights.\n\nEvaluation: Admirers of Yeats will appreciate this meditation on his work, but so will fans of literature and/or poetry generally.\n\nI confess I don’t always understand all the words in a Yeats poem, but I am drawn to them over and over again because of their beauty and their undeniable ability to evoke emotional responses. This book is full of poetic portraits that will stimulate, enchant, and inspire those both already familiar to them, as well as those new to the wonders of William Butler Yeats. Moreover, readers of this small jewel of a book are treated not only to memorable lines of Yeats but of others who were influenced by him and/or reflected his work.\n\nAn index would have been helpful, but it is a small complaint.\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nPublished by The Lilliput Press, 2020\n\nWhat can be better than a recipe book that is actually fun even just to read all the way through? This book is characterized as being for “young scientists,” and indeed, I found it in the youth section of the library. It has so much valuable cooking information in it, however, I hate to think it won’t be known to a wider audience.\n\nThere are over 70 recipes in this book, but they are not the most important part of the content. Rather, it is all the explanations of how ingredients interact and create different results in food. This will enable users of the book to extend what is learned to create other recipes and enhance any meal.\n\nFor example, how do you make meat tender? How can you make a sauce better by emulsifying it, and what does that mean, anyway? How does the use of yogurt change cooking outcomes? What is the difference among different types of rice and how do those differences affect cooking times, consistency, and taste? How do you make runny food drier? What makes some cookies chewy and some crisp? (Yes, perhaps the most critical information in the book!)\n\nThen there is the all-important issue of the “secret” method to cooking Italian pasta. We remember being startled to find one of our favorite Italian pastas, cacio e pepe, had only three ingredients. How in the world could it be so delicious? This cookbook answers that question with its recipe for Aglio e Olio, another three-ingredient Italian wonder. Once you learn this secret, you will never want any pasta made any other way! [Secret tip: if you are as lazy as I am, and even three ingredients throw you for a loop, Trader Joe’s has an excellent version of cacio e pepe in its frozen food section.]\n\nAll of this information is imparted as part of a solid collection of recipes that fall into categories of Breakfast; Lunch, Dinner & Sides; Snacks & Drinks; and Sweets. (And how cool is the Mirror Cake in the Sweets section and featured on the cover with its shiny, reflective surface, and what makes that happen?)\n\nAt the end of the book, there are charts for conversions and equivalents.\n\nEvaluation: This is an excellent resource for all ages, but certainly would make a great teaching tool for the fields of science – especially chemistry – and math, for younger users. Highly recommended!\n\nRating: 5/5\n\nPublished by America’s Test Kitchen, 2021"
