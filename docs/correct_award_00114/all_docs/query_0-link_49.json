        "text": "Born into the Anglo-Irish landowning class, Yeats became involved with the Celtic Revival, a movement against the cultural influences of English rule in Ireland during the Victorian period, which sought to promote the spirit of Ireland's native heritage. Though Yeats never learned Gaelic himself, his writing at the turn of the century drew extensively from sources in Irish mythology and folklore. Also a potent influence on his poetry was the Irish revolutionary Maud Gonne, whom he met in 1889, a woman equally famous for her passionate nationalist politics and her beauty. Though she married another man in 1903 and grew apart from Yeats (and Yeats himself was eventually married to another woman, Georgie Hyde Lees), she remained a powerful figure in his poetry.\n\nYeats was deeply involved in politics in Ireland, and in the twenties, despite Irish independence from England, his verse reflected a pessimism about the political situation in his country and the rest of Europe, paralleling the increasing conservativism of his American counterparts in London, T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. His work after 1910 was strongly influenced by Pound, becoming more modern in its concision and imagery, but Yeats never abandoned his strict adherence to traditional verse forms. He had a life-long interest in mysticism and the occult, which was off-putting to some readers, but he remained uninhibited in advancing his idiosyncratic philosophy, and his poetry continued to grow stronger as he grew older. Elected a senator of the Irish Free Republic in 1922, he is remembered as an important cultural leader, as a major playwright (he was one of the founders of the famous Abbey Theatre in Dublin), and as one of the very greatest poets&emdash;in any language&emdash;of the century. W. B. Yeats was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1923 and died in 1939 at the age of 73.\n\nHigh Talk: Influences from the British Isles; this link includes a discussion of Yeats' influence on poety of this century.\n\nEnglish IVHonnors: I'm looking forward to your arrival on Wednesday; we will be meeting at ________. Enclosed is my new poem. I am curious to hear and learn of your reaction to it.\n\nThe Second Coming (1921)\n\nTurning and turning in the widening gyre\n\nThe falcon cannot hear the falconer;\n\nThings fall apart; the centre cannot hold;\n\nMere anarchy is loosed upon the world,\n\nThe blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere\n\nThe ceremony of innocence is drowned;\n\nThe best lack all conviction, while the worst\n\nAre full of passionate intensity.\n\nSurely some revelation is at hand;\n\nSurely the Second Coming is at hand.\n\nThe Second Coming! Hardly are those words out\n\nWhen a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi\n\nTroubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert\n\nA shape with lion body and the head of a man,\n\nA gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,\n\nIs moving its slow thighs, while all about it\n\nReel shadows of the indignant desert birds.\n\nThe darkness drops again; but now I know\n\nThat twenty centuries of stony sleep\n\nWere vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,\n\nAnd what rough beast, its hour come round at last,\n\nSlouches towards Bethlehem to be born?\n\nOther Poems:\n\nAn Irish Airman Forsees His Death\n\nI KNOW that I shall meet my fate\n\nSomewhere among the clouds above;\n\nThose that I fight I do not hate,\n\nThose that I guard I do not love;\n\nMy country is Kiltartan Cross,\n\nMy countrymen Kiltartan's poor,\n\nNo likely end could bring them loss\n\nOr leave them happier than before.\n\nNor law, nor duty bade me fight,\n\nNor public men, nor cheering crowds,\n\nA lonely impulse of delight\n\nDrove to this tummult in the clouds;\n\nI balanced all, brought all to mind,\n\nThe years to come seemed waste of breath,\n\nA waste of breath the years behind\n\nIn balance with this life, this death."
