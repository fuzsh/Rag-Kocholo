        "text": "Introduction\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats was born in Sandy mount, Dublin, Ireland on June 13, 1865 and died in January 28, 1939. He was a famous Irish poet, dramatist and prose writer and probably one of the best English language poets of the 20th century. Yeats served as an Irish Senator for two terms in his later years, and was a pillar of both the Irish and English literary institutions. He was a key figure in the Irish Literary Revival, co-founding the Abbey Theatre with Lady Gregory and Edward Martyn and serving as its first director. He was also the first Irishman to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923 for inspired poetry, which, in a highly imaginative manner, gives voice to the spirit of a whole country, as defined by the Nobel Committee. The Tower (1928) and The Winding Stair are two of Yeats' most popular books, all completed after he was awarded the Nobel Prize. Yeats was born in Dublin and educated there, but grew up in County Sligo. He read poetry in his youth and was intrigued with both Irish folklore and the supernatural from an early age. Those themes appear in his early career, which lasted approximately until the turn of the century. His first collection of verse published in 1889, and those slow-paced and lyrical poems owe a debt to Edmund Spenser and Percy Bysshe Shelley, as well as Pre-Raphaelite lyricism.\n\nYeats' poems became more physical and practical after 1900. He largely abandoned his youth's transcendental ideals, though he remained fascinated by physical and metaphysical masks, as well as cyclical life hypotheses. Over the years, Yeats followed a variety of theological views, including extreme nationalist, classical liberal, reactionary conservative and millenarian nihilist, as critic Michael Valdez Moses put it.\n\nEarly years\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats was born in the Irish town of Sandy mount, in the county of Dublin. His father, John Yeats had practiced law but later dropped out to pursue painting. Susan Mary Pollexfen, his mother, came from a wealthy Anglo-Irish family with a successful milling and shipping company in County Sligo. The family moved to Sligo shortly after William's birth to be closer to her immediate family. The young poet came to regard the city as his spiritual and childhood home. Its landscape became his country of the ears over time, both physically and symbolically. Butler Yeats' family was artistically inclined; his brother Jack became a well-known painter, while his sisters Elizabeth and Susan—nicknamed Lollie and Lily by family and friends—became active in the Arts and Crafts movement. Yeats grew up as a part of the old Protestant Ascendancy, which was going through a period of identity crisis at the time.\n\nThough his family was mostly tolerant of the reforms taking place in Ireland, the late-nineteenth-century nationalist revival directly harmed his heritage and shaped his outlook for the rest of his life. Napoleon's dictum that to comprehend a man, you must know what was going on in the world, according to his biographer R. F. Foster in 1997, is manifestly true of W.B. Yeats. The power move away from the minority Protestant Ascendancy loomed large over Yeats' youth and young adulthood. The 1880s saw Parnell and the Home Rule movement come to prominence, the 1890s saw the rise of nationalism, and the Fenians rose to prominence at the turn of the century. These events would have a significant impact on his poetry, and his later explorations of Irish identity would have a significant impact on the writing of his country's biography.\n\nThe family moved to England in 1876 to help their father, John, advance his career as an artist. The Yeats children were initially taught at home. Their mother kept them occupied with stories and folktales from her homeland. John gave William erratic geography and chemistry lessons, as well as natural history tours of the surrounding Slough countryside. The aspiring poet enrolled in Godolphin primary school on January 26, 1877, and stayed for four years. Academically, he did not stand out, and his results was described as mediocre in an early school study."
