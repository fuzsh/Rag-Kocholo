A Dublin funeral is something between a public demonstration & a private picnic.\n\n—If I die, bury me up there[,] and then in a years time when the newspapers have forgotten me, dig me up and plant me in Sligo. See Fred Johnston Irishmans Diary, The Irish Times (21 May 2005): [...] A plaque on a wall of the public ossuary, a unicorn-and-star emblem, a few words, designed (but not sculpted) by the artist Edmund Dulac, a friend of the poet for a quarter of a century; Dulac and Edith Heald, another friend of Yeats, had applied officially at Roquebrune-Cap Martin to have the plaque installed contre le mur limitant lossuaire souterrain du côte est, à la mémoire du poète Butler William Yeats (sic), décédé a Roquebrune-Cap-Martin ... (Available online; posted on Facebook by Janice Fitzpatrick Simmons, 19.07.2015.) A letter to the newspaper ...\n\nOn 6th October 1988, Michael and Anne Yeats wrote to The Irish Timesfollowing the publication last week in England of a book that refers to the grave of W. B. Yeats in Drumcliffe Cemetery and affirming that the suggestion that our father was buried in a paupers [sic] grave in Roquebrune is of course totally untrue. They go on to explain that their mother had purchased a ten-year plot and that shsure in accordance with lae was the last person who would make a mistake on a matter of such crucial importance - it being her intention to rebury Yeats in Drumcliffe [sic].\n\nIt appears that at some stage the body was moved - on learning which she got in touch with the French government and was kept informed by them of the events at Roquebrune. [...] In preparation for the ultimate transer to Ireland, the remains were exhumed in March 1948, and placed in a Chapel of Rest. Careful measurements were made of the remains (Yeats had a particularly massive bone structure), and the task of certification was made easier by the fact that, due to a long-term hernia problem, our father wore a truss.\n\nThey then attest that the exhumation was conducted according to French law in the presence of the Mayor of Roquebrune and other officials in order to ensure that the indentity [sic] of the remains should be established beyond all possibility of error. They conclude with regrets that it should be necessary to issue a statement about delicate matters that should normally be private family affairs and hopes that it will not be necessary to contribute further to this discussion - with the assurance that there is, indeed, nothing to discuss since we are satisifed beyond doubt that our fathers body is indeed buried in Drumcliffe Cemetery.\n\n[End; signed Michael Yeats / Anne Yeats - Dalkey, Co. Dublin.] Conclusions ...? Roy Foster writes of Yeatss disinterment in 1948 that the ten-year concession was not honoured, as happened to the adjacent grave, where an Englishman called Alfred Hollis had been buried a few days after WBY, also with a ten-year concession, and that it proved necessary in March 1948 for [656] French officials to identify the remains, which was done to the satisfaction of both local authorities and representatives from Paris .. great care was taken to preserve discretion, rumours of confusion had reached the newspaper .... (W. B. Yeats: A Life, Vol. 2: The Arch-Poet Oxford UP 2003, pp.656-67.) Irish Times, Editorial (23 July 2015):\n\nA young man, wandering about the slopes of Ben Bulben and Knocknarea, or gazing across the silver waters of Lough Gill from Dooney Rock to Hazelwood, started to sing in accents that fell with a wild beauty ... In the natural grandeur of Sligo the new poet found an inspiration that lit up his verse with a burning flame.\n\nThat summary of the seminal and decisive influence of the Sligo landscape on the poetry of W. B. Yeats appeared in this newspaper on the occasion of the poets seventieth birthday. It is worth bearing in mind those words in coming to terms with the revelations in French diplomatic correspondence that seem to confirm that the bones sent back to Ireland in 1948 were not the poets.\n\nDoes it really matter whether any remnant of the mortal remains of Yeats lies in Drumcliffe churchyard? There may or may not be some trace of Yeatss remains in the Sligo soil but what does matter is the intimate association between the poet, his work and the iconic landscape under bare Ben Bulbens head that was his spiritual home and his arcadia. The spirit of place evoked in the poetry is enough to continue to validate it as a destination of literary pilgrimage. His own words, chosen by the poet as his epitaph and cut into the Drumcliffe headstone, carry enough significance to mark the graveyard as hallowed Yeatsian ground, a site of memorial that invokes the spirit of the poet.\n\nThe real disgrace of this affair is the failure of local French authorities at the time to recognise his eminence and treat him as an honoured guest in the cemetery in Roquebrune where Yeats died in 1939. Recalling his childhood in the Autobiographies Yeats wrote I would remember Sligo with tears, and when I began to write, it was there I hoped to find my audience. Sligo was always in the poets deep hearts core, his spirit can never be taken from the place of his first reveries.\n\nAt the time of his death 1939 three self-searching poems by Yeats were appearing in The Atlantic [NY] including The Man and the Echo questioning whether his play Cathleen Ni Houlihan (1902) had triggering the 1916 Rising."
