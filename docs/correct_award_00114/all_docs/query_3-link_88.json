        "text": "To understand what Rabindranath Tagore meant to the European imagination in the early twentieth century, it’s not enough to look at the rapturous response to his work by great writers like William Butler Yeats—who found in “Gitanjali,” the first collection of Tagore’s poetry to be translated into English, “a world I have dreamed of all my life long”—or even to note that Tagore, who was born in 1861, was the first Asian writer to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature, in 1913. Rather, one must look at a story from the trenches of the First World War, which was recounted many years later by the German playwright Carl Zuckmayer. A friend of Zuckmayer’s, a medic in the German Army, told how his unit captured a seriously wounded Indian soldier serving in the British Army. To save the man’s life, the German doctors needed to amputate one of his legs, but, since they didn’t speak English, they couldn’t communicate this to the increasingly terrified prisoner. Finally, the medic hit on the idea of saying the only remotely Indian words he knew: “Rabindranath Tagore! Rabindranath Tagore! Rabindranath Tagore!” The name acted like a charm, and the Indian soldier relaxed, nodded, and began to smile.\n\nThe sheer unlikeliness of this story, which is recorded in “Rabindranath Tagore: The Myriad-Minded Man” (1995), a superb biography by Krishna Dutta and Andrew Robinson, is part of what makes it so illustrative. Could the agonized Indian really have understood the German pronunciation of the English version of a Bengali name? And could that name have had the power to act as a combination of mantra, anesthetic, and flag of truce? The whole thing sounds a little too much like the kind of miracle story that would be introduced in the Vatican to make a case for sainthood.\n\nYet this is, perhaps, the best reason to believe the story. For if there was one thing that Tagore stood for, in the minds of Europeans in the nineteen-tens, it was the possibility that saintliness could still exist in the modern world. Yeats’s introduction to “Gitanjali” was the booster rocket that launched Tagore’s name into worldwide orbit, and its whole premise was that Tagore’s poems were more than literature. They were sacred wisdom, an ancient Indian cure for a modern Western sickness. Comparing Tagore to St. Francis and William Blake, Yeats wrote, “We fight and make money and fill our heads with politics—all dull things in the doing—while Mr. Tagore, like the Indian civilization itself, has been content to discover the soul and surrender himself to its spontaneity.”\n\nA century later, our ears are trained to detect the condescension behind Yeats’s praise. Industry for the West, poetry for the East: it’s not hard to see how this prescription reinforces the gulf in power between the colonizers and the colonized, even as it grants the latter the consolation prize of spiritual prestige. If there is some Orientalizing going on here, however, it is not only Yeats who is to blame. For Tagore, in “Gitanjali”—the Bengali title means “Song Offerings”—does seem to present himself in just these terms: a holy man living in a timeless world, communing ecstatically with nature and God. All he seems to need is sunlight and raindrops:\n\nThy sunbeam comes upon this earth of mine with arms outstretched and stands at my door the livelong day to carry back to thy feet clouds made of my tears and sighs and songs.\n\nWith fond delight thou wrappest about thy starry breast that mantle of misty cloud, turning it into numberless shapes and folds and colouring it with hues everchanging.\n\nIt is so light and so fleeting, tender and tearful and dark, that is why thou lovest it, O thou spotless and serene.\n\nCould Europe, in the throes of spiritual and political crisis, be blamed for welcoming Tagore as a prince of peace—especially when he seemed happy to look the part? Photographs of the young Tagore show a regally masculine figure with an intense gaze; but when he came to England in 1912, at the age of fifty-one, he wore a flowing beard and mustache, which, combined with a benevolent expression and a dhoti, seemed like the insignia of the guru. And not just in England. When Tagore toured Japan in 1916, the teen-aged Yasunari Kawabata—later to become the second Nobel Prize-winning writer from Asia—caught a glimpse of the poet: “His white hair flowed softly down both sides of his forehead; the tufts of hair under the temples also were long like two beards, and linking up with the hair on his cheeks, continued into his beard, so that he gave an impression, to the boy that I was then, of some ancient Oriental wizard.”\n\nIn his Nobel Prize address, Tagore wholeheartedly embraced the role of the Easterner come to rescue the West:\n\nI know that I must not accept that praise as my individual share. It is the East in me which gave to the West. For is not the East the mother of spiritual Humanity and does not the West, do not the children of the West amidst their games and plays when they get hurt, when they get famished and hungry, turn their face to that serene mother, the East? Do they not expect their food to come from her, and their rest for the night when they are tired? And are they to be disappointed?\n\nIt would not be wrong, however, to hear a certain irony in that last question. If spiritual sustenance was what Europeans and Americans needed from Tagore, that is what he would give them; it was a way of serving mankind, and his own ambition as well. But Tagore knew that the role he was playing in the West was not his real self—just as the prose translations he made in “Gitanjali,” with their old-fashioned diction and Biblical echoes, were not much like the original Bengali verse. He confessed as much to his English friend and biographer Edward Thompson: “In my translations I timidly avoid all difficulties, which has the effect of making them smooth and thin. I know I am misrepresenting myself as a poet to the western readers.”\n\nYeats, for his part, was happy to acknowledge that it was only his ignorance—of Indian literature and culture, of Tagore’s actual life—that made it possible to see the poet as such a gratifying symbol. “I know no German, yet if a translation of a German poet had moved me, I would go to the British Museum and find books in English that would tell me something of his life, and of the history of his thought,” Yeats wrote. “But though these prose translations from Rabindranath Tagore have stirred my blood as nothing has for years, I shall not know anything of his life, and of the movements of thought that have made them possible, if some Indian traveler will not tell me.”\n\nThere have been a number of attempts, in the century since Yeats made that request, to give the English reader a fuller and more accurate sense of Rabindranath Tagore—through new translations, anthologies of his work, critical studies, and biographies. But “The Essential Tagore” (Harvard; $39.95), published to coincide with the hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of Tagore’s birth, is the most substantial one yet. Eight hundred pages long, it is divided into ten sections, each devoted to a different facet of Tagore’s achievement: not just poems but fiction, plays, essays, autobiography, letters, even light verse and comic sketches.\n\nThe word “essential” might seem to call for a more parsimonious selection, until you realize that Tagore’s collected works in Bengali fill eighteen thousand pages. And that only begins to suggest the breadth of his activities, and his central place in modern Indian culture. He also composed more than two thousand songs, two of which are now the national anthems of India and Bangladesh; made hundreds of paintings; founded an experimental school and university; edited journals; participated in political debates, often as a sympathetic critic of Gandhi, whose title Mahatma he popularized; and managed his family’s estates in East Bengal. Not even Goethe or Tolstoy was quite so omnicompetent. To Fakrul Alam and Radha Chakravarty, the editors of “The Essential Tagore,” he is an “incomparable genius.”\n\nQuite obviously, this is not the curriculum vitae of a wizard or a saint. What comes across most clearly in “The Essential Tagore,” in fact, is not so much his literary genius—which remains elusive in translation—as his sheer human scale. Just as there was hardly a literary genre that he did not attempt, so there wasn’t a cultural or political question that he did not engage with, from the condition of women to the rise of nationalism, from the Hindu-Muslim divide to the need for industrial development. In seeing Tagore as an unworldly mystic, the West made the mistake of identifying the man with his literary persona—much as if one were to imagine Yeats, the theatre producer and Irish senator, forever planting bean rows on Innisfree.\n\nModernity, one might say, is the central theme and problem of Tagore’s work, and it is inextricably bound up with the problem of India’s relationship to the West, especially Britain. If India was a mythic land to the English, England was a still more powerful imaginative presence in Calcutta, then the capital of British India. Among the Bengali upper classes, to which Tagore belonged, education and public life were conducted largely in English. “Before I came to England,” he wrote during his first visit to the country, in 1878, “I supposed it was such a small island and its inhabitants were so devoted to higher culture that from one end to the other it would resound with the strains of Tennyson’s lyre.”\n\nThe Tagore family had long been at the forefront of India’s encounter with modernity, and with England. The poet’s grandfather, Dwarkanath, was one of Calcutta’s richest men, thanks to his connections with the East India Company and his investments in banking and mining. On a visit to England in 1842, Dwarkanath was presented to Queen Victoria and met celebrities like the Duke of Wellington and Dickens, who joked about how hard it was to pronounce his name: “I have spelt it backwards, but it makes no less tremendous nonsense that way.”\n\nThe son of this glamorous figure, the poet’s father, Debendranath, became still more important to Indian life, though in a very different way. In his twenties, growing tired of the spoiled existence of a rich young man, he had a religious epiphany and devoted himself to the religious society known as the Brahmo Samaj. Brahmoism, which became highly influential in nineteenth-century Bengal, can be seen as a kind of Hindu Unitarianism. It preached the worship of one God, as opposed to the populous Hindu pantheon, and sought to reform Brahmin caste taboos, but its theological radicalism was accompanied by a commitment to middle-class sobriety and uplift. In his memoir “My Reminiscences,” Tagore remembers his father, known as Maharshi (“great sage”), as a distant and austere figure: “He had a well-defined code to regulate his relations with others and theirs with him. In this he was different from the generality of his countrymen. With the rest of us a little carelessness this way or that did not signify; so in our dealings with him we had to be anxiously careful.”\n\nNo wonder that, in the very first piece in “The Essential Tagore,” an autobiographical talk delivered in China in 1925, Tagore proclaims, “I am modern. . . . I was born into a family which rebelled.” The man honored as Gurudev, “great teacher,” was also a scathing satirist and social critic, and it is not without satisfaction that he notes, “I have never had complete acceptance from my own people.” This sense of being at odds with his country, especially with Bengali society, is most obvious in some of the early letters included in “The Essential Tagore.” “Ours is the most wretched country,” he wrote in 1893. “It is very difficult here to keep one’s strength of mind. There is no one to really help you. You cannot find anybody with whom one can exchange a few words and feel alive within ten or twenty miles—nobody thinks, nobody feels, nobody works; nobody has any experience of a great work or a life worth living. . . . They eat, go to [the] office, sleep, smoke, and chatter and chatter like complete idiots.”\n\nThis is the eternal intellectual’s complaint: it could be Joyce on the Irish, or Mencken on the Americans. But it took a special confidence for Tagore to call attention to his country’s vices, at a time when India was just beginning to unite in the struggle for independence from Britain. Tagore was a strong supporter of the independence movement, playing a prominent part in the agitation that swept Bengal in 1905. Nothing about his countrymen enraged him more than obsequiousness toward the British. “The moment we feel the slightest handshake of a favor on their part, why immediately are our entire selves transformed into a mass of jelly, trembling and wobbling from top to toe?” he demanded.\n\nAt the same time, however, he felt compelled to remind his countrymen that self-rule, swaraj, would not be the answer to all of India’s problems. This is the theme of many of the political essays in “The Essential Tagore.” “If we are to achieve ‘Swaraj’ then we have to prove before we get it that we are capable of doing the work of Swaraj,” he writes in “Self-Reliance.” That meant improving the condition of the peasants, throwing off caste prejudices, healing the breach between Hindus and Muslims—in short, building an egalitarian humanism in a poor, divided society. “Where our humanity is concerned we are very weak—because we do not consider some human beings as part of mankind,” he warned.\n\nHistory has vindicated Tagore’s concerns: all these problems continue to plague India today. Indeed, the economist Amartya Sen, in his book “The Argumentative Indian,” praises Tagore less as a poet than as a social critic, the champion of “open debate on every issue” and “fearless reasoning in freedom.” But the value of Tagore’s social criticism was not only political; it was also literary, as it provided the energy behind much of his best fiction.\n\nThe short stories in “The Essential Tagore” are concerned above all with the condition of women in conservative Brahmin society. The great Bengali intellectual Rammohon Roy, one of the founders of Brahmoism and a close friend of Dwarkanath Tagore, was a leader of the early-nineteenth-century campaign to ban sati, the immolation of widows, and something of the same crusading impulse can be felt in Tagore’s work. “Shubha,” for instance, is the story of a mute girl whose handicap is a quite explicit metaphor for the voicelessness of Indian women. In sketching Shubha’s plight, Tagore courts sentimentality—her only friends, we learn, are a couple of cows, who “understand [the] sad, wordless melody” of her footsteps “more easily than words.” Such strokes are hardly necessary, however, to set off the panic and humiliation she feels when her parents try to marry her off by concealing her muteness: “The groom comes in person to inspect the bride, accompanied by some friends. . . . It is as if the god himself has come down to choose the animal for the sacrifice.”\n\nFor a woman in this society, Tagore empathetically shows, to be unmarried is a social and religious disgrace, and there is nothing a family resents more than an unmarriageable daughter. A girl who is poor and unattractive, like Bindu in “The Wife’s Letter,” is openly despised by her relatives: “The girl was so ill-favored that if she fell and hurt her head, people would be worried that the floor had suffered some damage.” When the family finally finds a man willing to take Bindu off their hands, they are so grateful they don’t bother to find out anything about him: “Bindi, you know that a husband is the sole end of a woman’s life,” her sister tells her. “If you are fated to suffer, no one can avert it.” The day after her wedding, Bindu discovers that the groom is violently insane, but her family refuses to take her back. In desperation, she commits suicide, by setting her clothes on fire. Sati may have been banned for nearly a century, Tagore implies in this 1914 story, but the sacrifice of women by their families is still standard practice.\n\nMost of the stories on this theme are bluntly polemical, more interesting as historical documents than as literature. The exception is “A Broken Nest,” a 1901 novella that is perhaps the best single piece in “The Essential Tagore” (and the basis for Satyajit Ray’s film “Charulata”). It tells the story of the fragile bond, half intellectual and half amorous, between a young bride, Charu, and her husband’s younger cousin, Amal. In her friendship with Amal, a budding writer, Charu finds the companionship missing from her marriage to Bhupati, a blustering newspaper editor who treats her with benevolent indifference. Tagore skillfully suggests how the erotic tension between Charu and Amal is sublimated in a common literary passion, as she finds in print the voice she lacks in life.\n\nFor Charu, the whole allure of writing is that it offers a marriage of minds with Amal, and she dreams of a paper communion: “Our journal will be hand written—not printed. There’ll be only two readers and two writers. You and I. No one else will be allowed to catch even a glimpse of it.” But Amal is too ambitious to limit himself to a single reader, and he begins to neglect his cousin’s wife. Finally, the time comes for him to get married, and this deals Charu a devastating blow. Only then, too late, does her husband realize that she loved Amal, and that he has forfeited his chance for a real relationship with his wife.\n\nThe psychology of the extended Hindu family in “A Broken Nest” ultimately seems no more exotic than that of, say, the Bertrams of “Mansfield Park,” child brides notwithstanding. In both cases, what seems today like an antiquated, oppressive sexual regime is shown to be simply another system for regulating the eternal human passions: loneliness, jealousy, love. The subtlety and psychological realism of the story may be a result of its origins in Tagore’s life. As a young man, he developed a close friendship with Kadambari Devi, the wife of his older brother Jyotirindranath. In traditional Brahmin families, it was standard practice to marry young girls to older men, which meant that new brides often looked to their younger brothers-in-law for companions their own age. “This Hindu family relationship was customarily a special one,” Dutta and Robinson write, in which “convention permitted an intimacy not allowed between other in-laws, with an element of danger.” Exactly what transpired between Tagore and Kadambari is not known, but the danger was obviously there. In 1884, a few months after Tagore was married—to a girl who was ten years old—his beloved sister-in-law committed suicide.\n\nThe loss of Kadambari, Tagore writes in “My Reminiscences,” was his first mature experience of death, and it forever transformed the way he thought and wrote. “I was unaware then of the slightest lack anywhere in my life; there seemed no loophole in its tightly woven fabric of laughter and tears. Nothing was visible beyond it, hence I had accepted it as the ultimate truth. And then death suddenly arrived from somewhere. In a single instant, it tore away one end of this very visible fabric of life. How bewildered I felt now!”\n\nTo the challenge of death, Tagore responded with an ecstatic, intuitive affirmation of being. “Emptiness is a thing man cannot bring himself to believe in: that which is not, is untrue; that which is untrue, is not. So our efforts to find something where we see nothing are unceasing,” he explained. His writing returns again and again to this insistence that there is no such thing as nothing, that death properly understood is simply another mode of being. One of the latest pieces in “The Essential Tagore” is an essay called “Travel,” from 1939, two years before his death, in which Tagore explains the lifelong restlessness that drove him from home to home and continent to continent: “I must leave the bonds that kept me confined, and move elsewhere. Move on, move on, move on. Move like the waterfall, like the ocean waves, like the birds at dawn, like the light at sunrise. That is why the world is so vast, the earth so extraordinary, the sky so infinite. . . . That is why the call of death is nothing but the same call to change one’s abode.”\n\nThe danger of this kind of affirmation is that it will fail to take account of the full strength of the negative—that it rhetorically sidesteps death, instead of overcoming it. When Tagore made his triumphal début in London, poets like Yeats and Ezra Pound caught fire, but more committed rationalists remained cold: Bertrand Russell attended one of his lectures and pronounced it “unmitigated rubbish—cut-and-dried conventional stuff about the river becoming one with the Ocean and man becoming one with Brahma.” It did not take long for such skepticism to extinguish the Tagore vogue, which died out nearly as quickly as it flared up. Today, his name evokes only a vague recognition in most English-language readers.\n\nThe fall in Tagore’s English reputation is not hard to explain. The margin of difference between sublime poetry and sentimental “rubbish” has to do entirely with the power and subtlety of the language, and this, of course, is what is hardest to convey in translation. “The Essential Tagore” offers new versions of many poems, including some from “Gitanjali,” but none of them really come to life as English poems. Often, they read like awkward cribs for an absent original:\n\nSinge me, Lord, with your silent, scorching heat.\n\nWith a cataclysmic, all-pervading conflagration,\n\nMake me writhe in unbearable despair. And then,\n\nLike a mother looking with glistening eyes\n\nAt her son being chastened by the father, pity me!\n\nThis is technically verse, but it feels wordier and less shapely than the prose version that Tagore offered in “Gitanjali”:\n\nSend thy angry storm, dark with death, if it is thy wish, and with lashes of lightning startle the sky from end to end.\n\nBut call back, my lord, call back this pervading silent heat, still and keen and cruel, burning the heart with dire despair.\n\nLet the cloud of grace bend low from above like the tearful look of the mother on the day of the father’s wrath.\n\n“Gitanjali,” full of addresses to a nameless god who is lover, consoler, and friend, gives Tagore’s mysticism a melancholy, quietist feel. But the Indian novelist Amit Chaudhuri, who provides a critical preface to “The Essential Tagore,” places Tagore “in the lineage of Nietzsche, Whitman, Lawrence, and others who made a similar rebuttal of negation,” and the comparison is a useful reminder of the radical, even antinomian side of Tagore’s spirituality. This is the Tagore we see in a poem like “The Restless One,” which pictures the divine as pure motion:\n\nYou race on, race on, furiously you race\n\nWild, running apace,\n\nNever turning your face;\n\nWhatever you have, you scatter with both hands as you go.\n\nWhen Tagore speaks abstractly about his spiritual beliefs—as in “The Problem of Self,” a selection from lectures that he delivered in America in 1913—he can sound almost Buddhist, calling for the annihilation of the self. “The freedom which Buddha preached,” he writes, can be compared to a lamp that burns its oil to illuminate the world. But the striking thing about Tagore’s poetry is how little affinity he shows for Buddhist notions of detachment, or of the world as a realm of suffering. Tagore does not want to snuff out the self like a candle; he wants to plunge it joyfully into the ocean that is the world. In the “Travel” essay, he describes the sea as “this boundless expanse of prohibition,” in which man cannot live. “But this negation also bore within it a great invitation. The waves were dancing in noisy mirth. . . . Looking at them, one felt as if millions of children had been released from school.”"
