        "text": "If I make the lashes dark\n\nAnd the eyes more bright\n\nAnd the lips more scarlet,\n\nOr ask if all be right\n\nFrom mirror after mirror,\n\nNo vanity’s displayed:\n\nI’m looking for the face I had\n\nBefore the world was made.\n\nWhat if I look upon a man\n\nAs though on my beloved,\n\nAnd my blood be cold the while\n\nAnd my heart unmoved?\n\nWhy should he think me cruel\n\nOr that he is betrayed?\n\nI’d have him love the thing that was\n\nBefore the world was made.\n\nPublished in The Winding Stair and Other Poems, 1933\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats is considered by many to be one of the greatest poets of the 20th century. Although he spent a portion of his childhood in London, Yeats took a strong ownership in his Irish nationality and maintained his cultural roots throughout his life. This was found in the Irish legends and heroes he presented in many of his poems and plays. In 1923, Yeats was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, “for his always inspired poetry, which in a highly artistic form gives expression to the spirit of a whole nation.”\n\nOne thing that serves as a significant aspect of Yeats’ work was his keen awareness of aging, both in body and in spirit. His romantic poems often mentioned weariness, the degeneration of the body, and the wisdom that comes with it.\n\nIn this poem, “Before the World Was Made,” Yeats writes from the perspective of a beautiful woman responding to a jealous lover. She begins by acknowledging her efforts to make herself more attractive with cosmetics, “mak[ing] the lashes dark,” “the eyes more bright,” and “the lips more scarlet.” While these actions can be seen as a projection of vanity, the woman chides the lover by saying that “no vanity’s displayed,” but rather that she is “looking for the face [she] had before the world was made.”\n\nGoing forward, the woman proceeds to acknowledge the power her beauty allots her, how a simple “look upon a man as though on [her] beloved” while staying “cold” and “unmoved” could make him see her as “cruel” and feel “betrayed.” In response to this, the woman says that she would rather have him “love the thing that was before the world was made.”\n\nHere, the woman reveals that, through her application of cosmetics and her use of her aesthetic beauty, she is searching for her inner beauty, something that was lost “before the world was made.” What’s interesting is that it’s not clear what happened that damaged her inner beauty, that shaped and changed the way she sees the world. The tragic thing about this entire poem is that the woman longs for the inner beauty she wishes to reclaim, and feels that her current, superficial beauty is only a shadow of the woman she was before.\n\n– Virginia Kettles\n\nLa que murió de su vestido azul está cantando.\n\nCanta imbuida de muerte al sol de su ebriedad.\n\nAdentro de su canción hay un vestido azul,\n\nhay un caballo blanco, hay un corazón verde\n\ntatuado con los ecos de los latidos de su corazón muerto.\n\nExpuesta a todas las perdiciones,\n\nella canta junto a una niña extraviada\n\nque es ella: su amuleto de la buena suerte.\n\nY a pesar de la niebla verde en los labios\n\ny del frío gris en los ojos,\n\nsu voz corroe la distancia que se abre\n\nentre la sed y la mano que busca el vaso.\n\nElla canta.\n\nThe dead woman who died from her blue dress is singing.\n\nShe sings drunk on death to the sun of her intoxication.\n\nWithin her song there is a blue dress,\n\nthere is a white horse, there is a green heart\n\ntattooed with the echoes of her dead heartbeats.\n\nExposed to all of the ruins,\n\nshe sings with a lost girl\n\nthat is the woman: her amulet of good luck.\n\nAnd despite the green mist on her lips\n\nand the cold grey in her eyes,\n\nher voice corrodes the distance that opens\n\nbetween thirst and the hand that looks for the glass.\n\nShe sings.\n\nTranslated by Laurel Myers.\n\nOriginally published in Poesía completa (2001) by Lumen.\n\nAlejandra Pizarnik is considered one of Argentina’s premiere poets from the mid-century. Born in 1936 in Buenos Aires, she attended university but never received her degree, instead choosing to study painting and poetry. Pizarnik was a prolific writer, publishing eight books of poetry and various essays by the time of her suicide at age 36. Her most famous books include Los trabajos y las noches, Extracción de la piedra de locura, and El infierno musical, in which the themes of loneliness, childhood, pain, and death dominate her work.\n\nWith simple language and movements, Alejandra Pizarnik creates a bizarre moment in the first line by introducing the “Night Singer” as a dead woman. The absurdity that follows throughout the rest of the poem comes from this detail about her death: she “died from her blue dress” (line 1). This odd occurrence primes the following images to be accentuated with one color, spanning blue, white, green, and grey. She “sings drunk on death” (line 2) about a white horse and a green heart tattoo, continuing Pizarnik’s theme of death throughout her poetry. The song is as bizarre as the poem itself, especially with the mention of the “lost girl / that is the woman” singing along. This “amulet of good luck” brings focus to the woman’s childhood and innocence. The imagery of her corpse concentrates on her face with the “green mist on her lips” and “the cold grey in her eyes,” describing intimate features with an observational, analytical tone, although the green mist adds to the fantastical whim and strangeness. The “Night Singer” ends with what seems to be a positive purpose, bringing “the glass,” the wanted object, closer to “the hand,” the seeker. Pizarnik ends the poem with a simple declaration, summarizing the poem and the dead woman’s action in two words: “She sings.”\n\n–Laurel Myers\n\nHyeah come Cæsar Higgins,\n\nDon’t he think he ‘s fine?\n\nLook at dem new riggin’s\n\nAin’t he tryin’ to shine?\n\nGot a standin’ collar\n\nAn’ a stove-pipe hat,\n\nI ‘ll jes’ bet a dollar\n\nSome one gin him dat.\n\nDon’t one o’ you mention,\n\nNothin’ ’bout his cloes,\n\nDon’t pay no attention,\n\nEr let on you knows\n\nDat he ‘s got ’em on him,\n\nWhy, ‘t ‘ll mek him sick,\n\nJes go on an’ sco’n him,\n\nMy, ain’t dis a trick!\n\nLook hyeah, whut ‘s he doin’\n\nLookin’ t’ othah way?\n\nDat ere move ‘s a new one,\n\nSome one call him, “Say!”\n\nCan’t you see no pusson–\n\nPuttin’ on you’ airs,\n\nSakes alive, you ‘s wuss’n\n\nDese hyeah millionaires.\n\nNeed n’t git so flighty,\n\nCase you got dat suit.\n\nDem cloes ain’t so mighty,–\n\nSecond hand to boot,\n\nI ‘s a-tryin’ to spite you!\n\nFull of jealousy!\n\nLook hyeah, man, I ‘ll fight you,\n\nDon’t you fool wid me!\n\nOriginally published in Lyrics of the Hearths (1903).\n\nBorn in 1872, Paul Laurence Dunbar was the son of emancipated slaves. He began writing and reciting poems from an early age and this skill for language did not go unnoticed. Despite being the only African-American student at his high school, he was elected president of the school’s literary society and eventually became editor of the school newspaper. As a young man, he had hopes of attending law school, but his family’s financial limitations instead pushed him to take a job as an elevator operator. It was not until 1892 that Dunbar published his first book of poetry, Oak and Ivy with the United Brethren Publishing House. Though Dunbar took on the printing costs, he was still able to earn a profit by personally selling copies. Throughout his career he published a dozen books of poetry, four short story collections, and four novels. His poems are considered his most significant literary contribution, but because of the prejudice that existed against dialect verse, much of his dialect poems were ignored. Instead, titles such as “We Wear the Masks” and “Ere Sleep Comes Down to Soothe the Weary Eye” reign over classrooms and anthologies as representations of his best work.\n\nIn “Jealous,” Dunbar uses dialect to discuss black dandyism—that is, the practice of framing and enveloping black bodies with “stylish” clothes. Black dandyism was a way of shaping one’s identity, especially one’s masculine identity, in an environment that constantly delegitimized one’s personhood. It made clothing political, subverting traditional notions of race, gender, class, and nationality. Yet, there is a deep irony inherent in black dandyism, which Dunbar is keen to pick up on. While the black dandy defies notions of whiteness that are inherently gendered and classed, it also falls into the exclusionary rhetoric of that whit eness, for not everyone can be a black dandy. One can only be a black dandy if they possess the economic means. Dunbar acknowledges through the speaker who says, referring to the fine clothes, “I ‘ll jes’ bet a dollar / Some one gin him dat,” (line 7-8). Imbedded in these lines is the implication that a disparity exists between the appearance of the speaker and the character, Cæsar Higgins. The explanation for this disparity is economic—presumably that Higgins has a benefactor who provides him with decadent articles of clothing like “a stove-pipe hat” (line 6). Dunbar argues that the image of the black dandy is dependent on the image of an impoverished black person—it is a reflection of that poverty and thus, cannot exist without it. The cause of this distinction is jealousy. The speaker’s harsh tone is captured in his comments, the assertion that Higgins is “puttin’ on…airs” (line 22), that he should not be provided with any special treatment. “Don’t pay no attention,” the speaker orders (line 11). Jealousy fuels the speaker’s anger, pushes him toward violence: “Look hyeah, man, I ‘ll fight you, / Don’t you fool wid me!” (line 31-32).\n\n“Jealous” is a deeply political poem not just because of its content, but also its form. At its core, Dunbar’s poem contains a critique of blackness, but even more potently, a critique of its relationship and subservience to whiteness. Yet, the deeply political and subversive nature of this commentary is hidden within the dialect verse, which a white audience had always considered “entertaining,” never the substance of serious literature. By using dialect, Dunbar plays into the desires of his white audiences who wanted the spectacle of blackness and the playfulness of dialect verse. Yet, fully aware of this bias, Dunbar uses dialect verse as a safe space into which he can plant a message for his black audience—something that speaks to the immediate concerns of the African-American experience, and offers a critique that works against the oppressor.\n\n—Arlette Hernandez\n\nAt the store, on the hanger, the blue dress must have fallen\n\nlike water to a froth of frilled hem, its bodice as smocked\n\nas a christening gown. A season out of date, her mother chose it\n\nfrom our local department store chiefly for the high collar,\n\nbut I knew it was a dress Lisa wouldn’t have been caught\n\ndead in. Just hidden under the neckband of lace, the circle\n\nof her purple necklace, each dark bead a fingertip of efficient\n\nbruise that we already knew about anyway, and simply went on\n\nimagining, as we, her classmates, filed past the white coffin.\n\nRepublished with permission from the author.\n\nBy foregoing the dramatic in favor of both simplicity and vivid imagery, Driskell creates a sense of mystery that is dominant throughout “What the Girl Wore” until the final line of the poem, when it is finally revealed that the blue dress with a bodice “as smocked/as a christening gown” is to be worn by the recently deceased Lisa. In an effort to mislead the reader, Driskell maintains an unusually apathetic tone, however, some of her double entendres suggest a more complex reason for the poem’s lack of emotion: perhaps Driskell is mirroring our tendency to suppress emotions in the face of great tragedy and sadness. Furthermore, the speaker’s impassivity could carry implications of Lisa’s own alienation from those around her prior to her death—while the speaker is familiar enough with Lisa to understand her fashion preferences, she refers to herself merely as one of Lisa’s classmates as she “file[s] past the white coffin.”\n\nThe feeling of suspense created by Driskell’s ambiguity reaches its height with her description of “each dark bead a fingertip of efficient/bruise that we already knew about anyway.” While this image engenders certain suspicions concerning the cause of Lisa’s death, the indifference with which the speaker reacts raises additional questions of the onlookers’ familiarity with such a sight.\n\nDriskell heightens the impact of her ultimate revelation by withholding mention of Lisa’s funeral until the final line of the poem, and in doing so, she ensures that the conclusion of “What the Girl Wore” is as troubling as it is unexpected.\n\nAward-winning poet and professor Kathleen Driskell serves as the Associate Program Director of Spalding University’s brief-residency Master of Fine Arts in Writing Program, where she is Associate Professor of Creative Writing. Driskell’s work has appeared in many nationally known literary magazines, including North American Review, The Southern Review, and The Greensboro Review. Her poem “What the Girl Wore” is a companion piece to “Why I Mother You the Way I Do”, from her collection Seed Across Snow from Red Hen Press. On her blog (kathleendriskell.blogspot.com), Driskell explains the profound effect that the deaths of three friends during her teenage years have had on her writing, noting her experience in dealing with these tragedies as a major influence in “What the Girl Wore” and “Why I Mother You the Way I Do.”\n\n— Sierra Terrana"
