        "text": "I have avoided delving deep into A Vision by W. B. Yeats for the simple reason that it takes a LOT of determination to grasp Yeats’s esoteric masterpiece, but I did it and I could not be more fascinated. After finishing A Vision I realized that Yeats had mentioned Dante quite a few times and based his System of belief around him so I decided to research Dante’s influence on him for a recent module assignment. (Spoiler alert: I also chose A Vision as my topic for our upcoming MA conference!)\n\nThe later works of Yeats mark a new phase of his poetic career; his commitment shifted from his old love of Maud Gonne to his new dialectic between artist and work. Romanticism transformed Dante’s tragic failure of the Augustans into a visionary figure, alongside the likes of Shakespeare. Romantics such as Shelley and Blake, whom Yeats deeply admired, indulged in the prestige interest in the recovery of Dante and would shape Yeats’s understanding and view of him. Yeats did not speak Italian and read Dante through translations which he has been heavily criticized for as it can be argued that he had instead read the romantic stylized translations which took value away from the original. His early endeavours into Dante’s work can be traced back to his two essays -“William Blake and his Illustrations to the Divine Comedy” (1896) and “William Blake and the Imagination” (1897) (Bornstein 5).\n\nFurthering his ideology of Dante, Yeats transforms him into the image of ideal poet in Ideas of Good and Evil (1903) where Dante symbolizes ‘the highest order of created being by the fixed stars’ (Yeats, Ideas of 205). Yeats believed that for an artist to reach their full potential of self- expression they must embrace their anti-self, seek to become a different being, and act out the self’s own conflicting characteristics (Wright 53). The thematic exploration of the mystical self is evident in Per Amica Silentia Lunae where Yeats explores his new understanding of the spirit; Yeats expresses that its concepts lead to the formation of A Vision. The notion of the external self is first introduced in Per Amica Silentia Lunae (PASL) which he refers to as the ‘Daemon’ who ‘comes not as like to like but seeking its own opposite, for man and Daemon feed the hunger in one another’s hearts’ (Yeats, PASL 37). Although Yeats had been familiar with the concept of the Daimon from his understanding of Greek philosophy he chose to rewrite these classical sources to interpret his new thought (Haswell 17). Appearing in the opening section of PASL, Yeats’s obsession with discovering the self and his Dantean allusion is portrayed in “Ego Dominus Tuus”, where a dialogue between Hic, who represents the poet’s earlier self, and Ille, the poet who he would like to become. The poem contrasts Dante and Keats who are deemed both as great poets, however, Dante emerges as the perfected idealized romantic as he assumed an image of his anti-self, or mask, whereas Keats had only reached a satisfactory heightened position of his regular self. Ille strives to attain his ‘own opposite’ and embrace his mask, just like Dante successfully found his appropriate ‘stony face’. The poem represents a turning point in Yeats’s poetic career as he explicitly denies his earlier self in favour for a new form which he is searching for. To him, the anti-self was a reflection of the hidden and potential self which is attained by embracing the good and evil within. Yeats’s esoteric doctrine of the Anti-self reflects his mediations on his own personality and his desire to embrace his opposite and deny his primary self. (Wright 56) Perhaps this was Yeats’s way of justifying his failures and excusing any evil he may have done, and, furthermore, like Dante, present the paradox of high constancy and sin (Henn 35).\n\nIt is evident that the story of Beatrice and Dante appealed to Yeats greatly and he displays his belief that art could act as a compensation for difficulties in life. In Per Amica Silentia Lunae Yeats states his great sympathy for their tragic faith saying that ‘[he] is always persuaded that [Dante] celebrated the most pure lady poet ever sung and the Divine Justice, not merely because death took that lady and Florence banished her singer, but because he had to struggle in his own heart with his own unjust anger and lust; while unlike those of the great poets, who are at peace with the world and at war fought themselves, he fought a double war’(PASL 26). It seems as though Yeats considered Dante an admirable figure of the elite not only for his revolutionary work, but for the circumstances he had endured; it becomes clear that Yeats considered Dante’s ‘double war’ as a gateway to his ‘Unity of Being’.\n\nYeats’s mythology can be traced back to his earlier work where he explores the myth of legend and folklore to convey Ireland’s ancient history through his poetry. There is no doubt that Yeats’s occult beliefs were well and truly flourishing throughout his early career; however, upon his marriage to George his mysticism grew and developed into an eccentric spiritual enlightenment. In 1917, shortly after their marriage, Yeats discovered George’s automatic writing abilities which unleashed a new realm of belief and ideas for him. He used their private occult experiments to create his system of the phases of the moon in order which categorized people into states of being. This esoteric and quite peculiar work made up his philosophy behind A Vision (1925), which he believed embodied the unknown instructors and spirits who came to give him a system of thought (Henn 182). George was an extremely intelligent woman who spoke Italian and was well acquainted with Dante’s work. It is very likely that she inspired Yeats’s further study of Dante as George directed their focus toward revelatory and visionary knowledge; through her automatic writing she prescribed joint readings of Dante’s works to Yeats. (Barry 141-142).\n\nYeats believed Dante reached a higher, enlightened, poetic state than many others he admired and desired to be classified in the same rank. In A Vision, he asserts his system of classification which he longed for as he outlines the 28 phases of the moon which represent the states of human personality. Yeats assigned both his enemies and friends to their appropriate phases of the moon much like Dante had done in the Divine Comedy. Each phase is pictured as one of the spokes of a Great Wheel, which is ‘every completed movement of thought or life’, and was classified according to Yeats’s symbolic abstractions, antithetical tincture and primary tincture (Yeats, A Vision 81). According to Yeats, the subjective cone, the antithetical tincture, is achieved by continual conflict with the objective cone, the primary tincture. Yeats describes the conflict between the subjective, which ‘tends to separate man from man’, and the objective, which ‘brings us back to the mass where we begin’ (Yeats, A Vision 71-72). Within these cones move what are called the Four Faculties: Will and Mask, Creative Mind, and Body of Fate. The explanatory diagram in A Vision is in the form of the Great Wheel of the lunar phases which Yeats closely associates with the cones and gyres (Henn 166). Like Dante, Yeats uses geometric images to construct his esoteric system which proved difficult for many loyal readers of his to grasp.\n\nThe four faculties arranged within the psyche must work as one to purify all aspects of the psyche which may lead to the discovery of the universal Self. Yeats usually speaks of the harmonized psyche in Dantesque terminology, calling it Unity of Being, which at that moment allows one to accept all the struggle and hardships for the sake of the divine purpose (Wilson 44). Dante used the term ‘Unity of Being’ in the Convito when he compared beauty to a perfectly proportioned human body; Yeats’s understanding of Dante’s Unity of Being is not merely physical proportionality of the body but the balance of the body and soul in harmonious proportion (Barry 136). Yeats borrows this term and links it to the realization of a higher self, which, according to Yeats, Dante had achieved this through his poetry.\n\n‘Yet Dante, having attained, as poet, to Unity of Being, as poet saw all things set in order, had an intellect that served the Mask alone, that compelled even those things that opposed it to serve, and was content to see both good and evil’.\n\n(Yeats, A Vision 144)\n\nPerhaps distorting Dante’s view of evil to suit his own motif, Yeats casually forgets that the entirety of his Comedy condemns evil. He longed for a Unity of Being that would inhibit both good and evil instead of producing vague emotions which he considered his earlier work to be. Yeats continues to state that Shelley ‘lacked the Vision of Evil’ which condemned him to be a great poet but ‘not of the greatest kind’ (Yeats, A Vision 144). Whereas Dante, who suffered the injustice and loss of Beatrice, ‘found divine justice’ (Yeats, A Vision 144). Although he classifies Shelley within Phase 17, Yeats sought to surpass Shelley’s ability and simply reach the level of Dante and achieve a deeper being which may become the unity described by Dante in the Convito. In the Convito, Dante speaks of his exile and his grief for the death of Beatrice which made him not only a writer of poetry but a Daimonic man (Yeats, A Critical Edition 29). Yeats defines him as ‘the Daimonic man because Unity of Being, and consequent expression of Daimonic thought, is now more easy than at any other phase’ (Yeats, A Vision 141). Furthermore, he positions himself alongside Dante as a Daimonic man of phase 17.\n\nDante’s Comedy can be understood in the context of the postclassical Greek tradition which Yeats took a deep liking to. Fundamental aesthetic and philosophical-theological aspects of his work display Byzantine influences and mimic its ideas and styles. The implementation of Byzantine iconography is incorporated into much of Yeats’s later works. One can see a deep influence of Dante in Byzantium as Yeats draws spiritualistic images connected to Dante. First published in The Tower (1928), “Sailing to Byzantium” depicts images of the Byzantine Churches in Ravenna, the Italian city where Dante took refuge until his death in 1321, as he mentions ‘the gold mosaic of a wall’ (Barry 142). Yeats confirms that while writing his ideal Byzantine he had the capital of Emperor Justinian in mind as he fantasizes about being given ‘a month of Antiquity and leave to spend it where [he] chose, [he] would spend it in Byzantium a little before Justinian opened St. Sophia and closed the Academy of Plato’ (Yeats, A Vision 279). Further reference to Dante can be seen in the following lines as Yeats as he wishes to enter into ‘the artifice of eternity’ through ‘God’s holy fire’, echoing Justinian in the Commedia who dwells in God’s fire and guides Dante to achieving his Unity of Being which Yeats so desperately is longing for. Though his belief of afterlife varied from Dante’s, Yeats alludes to much of Dante’s belief system, particularly the purgatorial experience after death.\n\nYeats longed to create a mythology in which his System would be profound and allow him to join Dante as an enlightened poet. He isolated the Comedy and envisioned it as Dante’s successful struggle to obtain his ‘Mask’ which he used against the development of his own System. Arguably Yeats’s understanding of Dante may have been obstructed by his own motives of becoming a visionary poet. A Vision, in all its esoteric glory, is riddled with Dantesque philosophy and contains Yeats’s last major discussion of Dante, whom he mentioned over ninety times in his published prose. The fact that Yeats attributed the Unity of Being, the highest achievement of his system, to Dante is vital in one’s understanding Yeats’s admiration of the late poet; furthermore, the borrowing of this term holds great significance as it aligns Dante’s belief system with Yeats’s. The abstract geometric system of A Vision alludes to that of Dante’s Divine Comedy, where Yeats too chose to categorize historically influential people in a hierarchical structure to define the importance of his phases. As Terrance Brown states ‘an insecure hold on personal identity had always been an aspect of Yeats’s experience’ (Brown 171). Seeing as Yeats republished A Vision with refinements, Brown’s statement is reinforced here and is also evident in his poetic career of determining his self. In Dante, Yeats created a seemingly unattainable status of greatness which he used to transform himself into the poet he aspired to be. It was important to Yeats to create an impression of complexity and he hoped that his esoteric system would free his imagination as he thought that medieval Christianity had freed Dante’s (Bornstein 14).\n\nWorks cited/suggested readings.\n\nBarry, Caron. “Yeats’s Ideal Others: William Blake and Dante Alighieri.” New Hibernia Review, vol. 22 no. 2, 2018, p. 128-145.
