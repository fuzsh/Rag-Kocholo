        "text": "The interior of tower and cottage at Thoor Ballylee in South County Galway may have closed for the winter, but the spirit of the Nobel Prize-winning poet WB Yeats lives on.\n\nStockholm University was the venue for a major conference of the International Yeats Society remembering the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the circumstances of its giving to WB Yeats, featuring keynotes from Professors Roy Foster, Marjorie Howes, Margeret Mills Harper, and Paul Muldoon.\n\nThis was not the only recent ceremony connected to Yeats’s award. This autumn the award to the winners of a major new poetry competition to mark the 100th anniversary of Nobel Prize took place at Thoor Ballylee. The Yeats Thoor Ballylee Poetry Prize is an initiative of the Yeats Thoor Ballylee Society, who are custodians of the poet’s medieval tower house, near Gort, in Co.Galway.\n\nFilm maker and Thoor Ballylee Society board member Lelia Doolan noted: “Yeats wrote in a letter ‘I am of late feeling greatly inspired within the walls of an old tower house that I own in the West of Ireland – Thoor Ballylee’, and so we feel very happy to honour with this prize his old home, to commemorate his enduring, vivid legacy and to offer an invitation to poets worldwide to connect, through their work, with this wonderful place.”\n\nFrom its launch on Yeats’s birthday, the award attracted hundreds of entrants from around the world. The prize was open to anyone, but poems were to be unpublished, in English, and no more than 40 lines. There to present the prizes to the winners was poet and chief judge Mary Madec, and guest of honour Caitriona Yeats, harpist, granddaughter of the poet, and old friend of Thoor Ballylee.\n\nThe winners were Breda Joyce, with third prize, Kitty Donnelly, with second prize, and Catherine Phil MacCarthy with first prize. As it happens quite a few of the entered poems employed local scenery, and made Yeatsian connections. Yeats’s poem ‘A Coat’, about determining to take off his rhapsodist’s song cloak, an embroidered coat made out of mythologies to stand in plain view is echoed here in interesting ways by the winner of the third prize, Breda Joyce, in the following poem:\n\nOn the Seventh Day\n\nFor six-days of the week,\n\nmy father served behind a counter,\n\nsentenced to pay back loans\n\nthat sank his broad shoulders.\n\nBut when Sunday came,\n\nhe put on wellingtons\n\nto walk the land,\n\nstony fields that crouched\n\nbehind limestone walls.\n\nWhen a mist rose from the Corrib\n\nand veiled the hills near Inchagoill,\n\nmy father wore his heavy coat.\n\nLater, when he could no longer walk,\n\nthe fields observed a Sunday silence.\n\nIn the upstairs room his breath laboured\n\nagainst the cold lakeside air.\n\nSo let us remember him\n\nnot at some fancy hotel table,\n\nbut in fields where his uneven steps\n\nfollowed sheep through gaps,\n\nhis shadowed eyes brooding\n\nin the half-light where Connemara hills\n\nhave become an embroidered cloak\n\nthat wraps his presence round us.\n\nAnna O’Donnell, chair of the Yeats Thoor Ballylee Society, joined poet Mary Madec and Caitriona Yeats to present the prizes to the winners: Catherine Phil MacCarthy, Kitty Donnelly, and (the sister of) Breda Joyce.\n\nPoetry Prize Details\n\nFor more see our dedicated page with competition rules.\n\nTower\n\nAlthough the tower interior and exhibitions are closed for the winter, visits are still possible to experience the bridge, garden, and river walk up to the old mill. A full programme of events will continue next year. Meanwhile as a voluntary organization Yeats Thoor Ballylee Society relies on your time and contributions. Join us, help out, or donate to keep Yeats’s spirit alive at the tower.\n\nIn our continuing celebrations for the centenary of WB Yeats Winning the Nobel Prize for Literature, this week is maybe the best of the year for visiting Thoor Ballylee!\n\nSupport Culture Night and its nationwide events on Friday 22nd September by visiting Thoor Ballylee, Yeats’ Tower, from 5-7 pm. For one night only there is free admission to the tower and cottage and all our exhibitions.\n\nAnd this time you explore the Galway home of Poet Laureate W.B. Yeats, you can enjoy wonderful music from Eileen Fleming and Frank Wall, as well as the customary cup of tea and cake.\n\nA reminder too that this week Nobel Words, a one-act play written by Peggy Monahan, is premiered at Thoor Ballylee on Thursday 21 September at 8pm, with support from Yeats Thoor Ballylee Society, Galway County Council and Creative Ireland.\n\nTickets are €10 and can be reserved by ringing 087 6360895.\n\nNobel Words travels to other venues including the Town Hall Theatre, Gort on 29th and 30th September, 8pm, and The Yeats Building, Sligo, on 7th October at 1pm. All tickets for these performances are available through the number above – or at the doors, but only if numbers permit.\n\nCelebrating the Centenary of W.B. Yeats Winning the Nobel Prize for Literature\n\nNobel Words, a one-act play written by Yeats Thoor Ballylee Board Member Peggy Monahan, will be premiered at Thoor Ballylee on Thursday, 21st September at 8pm.\n\nPerformed by the Wild Swan Theatre Company, the play focuses on that momentous week in Yeats’s life when he learned of his Nobel Prize award. As Yeats’s gives a lecture on the founding of the Abbey Theatre, he invokes the memories of those who helped him along the way, in particular Lady Gregory and John Millington Synge.\n\nTickets are €10 and can be reserved by ringing 087 6360895.\n\nNobel Words travels to other venues including the Town Hall Theatre, Gort on 29th and 30th September, 8pm, and The Yeats Building, Sligo, on 7th October at 1pm. All tickets available through the number above – or at the doors but only if numbers permit.\n\nFunding and support for the performance have been provided by the Yeats Thoor Ballylee Society, Galway County Council and Creative Ireland.\n\nThe tower home of WB Yeats was the location for the launch of a major new poetry competition to mark the 100th anniversary of the awarding of the Nobel Prize for Literature to the renowned Irish poet. The Yeats Thoor Ballylee Poetry Prize is an initiative of the Yeats Thoor Ballylee Society, who are custodians of the poet’s medieval tower house, near Gort, in Co.Galway.\n\n“This is an exciting year for Thoor Ballylee as it is the centenary of Yeats’s Nobel Prize,” said Anna O’Donnell, the Chair of Yeats Thoor Ballylee Society. “With the kind assistance of Creative Ireland, we are celebrating the occasion by launching the Yeats Thoor Ballylee International Poetry Prize. We are inviting poets, not just from Ireland, but from all over the world to celebrate with us, by sharing their work, and connecting with this magical place where Yeats spent some of the happiest and most creative years of his life.”\n\nThe launch celebrated Yeats’s birthday, and drew a collection of poets and musicians and artists as well as supporters of the arts.\n\nPoetry Prize Details\n\nIn honour of the 100th anniversary of W.B. Yeats being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, the Yeats Thoor Ballylee Society has launched the Yeats Thoor Ballylee International Poetry Prize. The award will take place at Thoor Ballylee, the former home of W.B. Yeats, located in Gort, Co Galway, Ireland.\n\nThe poetry competition opens on Yeats’s birthday, 13 June 2023, while the closing date for submissions is midnight (GMT) 18 August 2023. The prize is open to anyone, but poems must be unpublished, in English, and no more than 40 lines. There is a small entry fee, but also a first prize of €1,000, second and third prizes, and the prospect of publication at Yeats’s tower itself and on our website. This year’s judge, poet Mary Madec, will determine first, second and third place. Mary was the recipient of the Hennessy XO Prize for Emerging Poetry in 2008 and has published several collections of poetry with Salmon Poetry.\n\nFor more see our dedicated page with competition rules and our entry portal.\n\nTower events\n\nAs well as launching the Poetry Prize, Yeats Thoor Ballylee Society has many other events planned for this historic year at Yeats’s tower.\n\n“There will be concerts and lectures to mark the centenary as well as a specially commissioned play about the poet called Nobel Words.” says Anna O’Donnell. “We’ve also embarked on a major project this year, with the help of Community Foundation Ireland, to return the land and gardens to reflect how they would have been when the Yeats family lived here, as well as upgrading the walkways and picnic areas to make them accessible for all, and adding wonderful new stone benches for visitors. But perhaps the most exciting ongoing project is the restoration of the old mill wheel on site. Once this is done, there is the possibility to generate our own electricity using water power!”\n\nFor now, the custodians of Yeats Tower are hoping to generate a flood of entries for the Yeats Thoor Ballylee International Poetry Prize. Film maker and Thoor Ballylee Society board member Lelia Doolan hopes that aspiring poets from around the world will be moved to write new poetry just as Yeats himself was by the power of the place: “Yeats wrote in a letter ‘I am of late feeling greatly inspired within the walls of an old tower house that I own in the West of Ireland – Thoor Ballylee’, and so we feel very happy to be launching this Poetry Prize from his old home, to commemorate his enduring, vivid legacy and to offer an invitation to poets worldwide to connect, through their work, with this wonderful place.”\n\nFollowing a two-year closure to in-person visitors, Thoor Ballylee opened to all comers in 2022 and all here had a busy and exciting year.\n\nThe Yeats Thoor Ballylee Society was chosen as a delegate in the European Union’s Cultural Heritage in Action program, and was invited to be on the list of Best Practice Sites in Europe. We are also continuing to work nationally and internationally to address the current environmental issues: to that end we are restoring the mill wheel on site, with the hope of generating our own electricity. We hope to implement a biodiversity project, which will help restore the flora and fauna that surrounded Yeats and his family at Thoor Ballylee, and which is mirrored in his writing.\n\n2023 marks an important time for Thoor Ballylee as that year marks the centenary of Yeats winning the Nobel Prize for Literature. To that end, we are planning a series of events to mark the occasion, as we continue our work to preserve and promote Yeats’s legacy. In tandem with the centenary events, we have an equally ambitious programme of performances, tours, talks, and exhibitions for 2023.\n\nIf you’d like to read more about the many cultural events associated with the tower, take time in the new year to visit our website for the latest – https://yeatsthoorballylee.org/ – and why not follow us on Facebook by liking Yeats Thoor Ballylee Society!\n\nAs always, we appreciate your continued interest and support in our work to honour the remarkable Yeats family and historic Norman building, and to keep alive the work of WB Yeats through poetry, culture, history, and love of nature.\n\nIf you would like to donate, become a Friend of Thoor Ballylee (or renew your Friend of Thoor Ballylee subscription), we gladly invite you to visit our website donation page.\n\nMany thanks to all our visitors and well-wishers and donors and friends, and wishing you all the best for this season! We close with a photograph of Thoor Ballylee from just last week in all its winter glory.\n\nFebruary sees the launch of a major project to restore Thoor Ballylee and create a world class culture and education centre in time for the 150th anniversary of the birth of W.B.Yeats in June, and the Yeats2015 worldwide programme of cultural events.\n\nThe Yeats Thoor Ballylee Society will launch the project on Friday February 6 in the Lady Gregory Hotel, Gort, at 8pm. A fundraising objective of €1 million has been set for the project. Senator Fidelma Healy-Eames, the chair of the Yeats Thoor Ballylee Society believes the proposed centre could become “a huge attraction for the area”, in turn boosting tourism revenues for the south Galway region. The Minister of State for Tourism Michael Ring granted a licence which allows the group to start fundraising to secure the money needed to re-open the tower and the committee is actively promoting the project among local, national, and international business and philanthropic bodies to achieve the €1 million needed. Senator Healy-Eames said the funds will be used to develop and market the centre and meet essential capital and running costs. The tower will accommodate a new exhibition, a café, bookshop, and space for exhibitions, lectures, and classes. The surrounding gardens and trail to the old mill will also be developed. The fourteenth-century Norman tower is intimately associated with W.B.Yeats who owned and lived in the tower with his family between 1921 and 1929. It was also during this period that he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nRead about this story in the Galway Advertiser."
