        "text": "William Butler Yeats (1865-1939)\n\nPoet, Dramatist, Man of the Theatre\n\nW.B. Yeats, generally acknowledged to be the greatest poet of the modern era, lived an extraordinarily rich and productive life as the founder and guiding spirit of the Irish Literary Revival and the Abbey Theatre, the National Theatre of Ireland. His writing helped to inspire Ireland’s struggle for independence and his ideas on intellectual freedom within a democratic society and the role of culture in shaping a distinctive national identity had an influence that continues to the present day. Yeats served as a member of the Irish Senate formed in 1922 when Ireland won her freedom after 700 years of foreign rule. Yeats was also a folklorist, mythologist and life-long student of Eastern and Western religion as well as the occult mysteries. All of these interests and activities found an outlet in Yeats’s achievement as a poet, dramatist and man of the theater.\n\nRooted in the existential realities of Ireland and the modern age, Yeats’s visionary art represents a public forum of wisdom literature. For Yeats, the arts were a means of recovering and celebrating the mystical idea of the anima mundi – that is, an awareness that soul-making and the business of everyday life are profoundly implicated in one another. The poetry and plays of Yeats were also intended to enable the Irish people to discover their own sense of selfhood in relationship to community. In 1923 Yeats became the first Irishman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature for what the Nobel Committee described as “inspired poetry, which in a highly artistic form gives expression to the spirit of a whole nation.”\n\nThe early poetry of Yeats is remarkable for a lyrical intensity that approaches incantation in the power of its emotional and spiritual resonance. That tradition had its roots in the methods employed by the bards of ancient Ireland to recite their poetry to the accompaniment of a harp, the national symbol of Ireland. Throughout his career, the long pulsating breath-lines of Yeats, with their syncopated moment to moment rhythmic changes and a delicate modulation of internal rhymes and half-rhymes – all borrowed from Gaelic verse forms – were characteristic of Yeats’s unique poetic voice. Therein lies the key to his incomparable ability to carry his listeners and readers to the outer reaches of the imagination, a realm of pure transcendence where anything is possible.\n\nMan of the Theater\n\nA wise theater might make a training in strong and beautiful life the fashion.\n\n“Discoveries” (1906)\n\nTheater artists and critics have increasingly come to realize that Yeats’s accomplishment as a dramatist equals his enormous achievement as a poet. Fintan O’Toole, the highly respected drama critic of The Irish Times, argues that Yeats is the only modern playwright equivalent to Shakespeare in the universality and timelessness of his archetypal imagery. Other critics such as Denis Donoghue believe that Yeats’s “poésie du theatre” provides an example to animate Irish and world theater on into the future.\n\nYeats once described the theater he envisaged as “a memory and a prophecy.” Following this, the W.B. Yeats Foundation has made a special commitment to realizing Yeats’s vision of a “total theatre” combining poetry, music, dance and the visual arts in a highly expressive and holistic engagement with the mind, emotions, senses and imagination of the audience.\n\nYeats wrote in perhaps the widest range of forms of any dramatist in history, yet each of his brilliantly conceived one-act plays is a perfect realization of its meaning. Because of this, theater artists who can meet the challenges of Yeats are capable of successfully performing virtually any major dramatist from the ancient Greeks and Shakespeare to such masters of the modern stage as Brecht, Beckett and Stephen Sondheim. The work of Yeats, in its mythopoeic, ritualistic and spiritual dimension, is also directly connected with the traditional performing arts of Japan, India, South America and Africa as well as some of the leading avant garde thinkers and theater artists of our own time. Potentially, the visionary art of Yeats is capable of reinvigorating contemporary theater while inspiring a radically transformative “total theatre” of the future.\n\nThe W.B. Yeats Foundation\n\nThe Yeats Foundation was established by Yeats scholar, producer and theater director James Flannery in 1989, the fiftieth anniversary of the poet’s death, in order to honor his enormous achievement as a man and artist and thereby gain a greater understanding and appreciation of the richness and diversity of Irish culture. The Foundation was launched in June 1989 with a reading from Yeats’s work titled “The Poet and Politics,” which was held at New York’s Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. Readers included Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Eugene McCarthy, Governor Hugh Carey and award-winning actresses Tammy Grimes and Viveca Lindfors. The guests of honor were Irish Senator Michael Yeats, the son of the poet and the Honorary Patron of the Foundation, as well as his wife, the noted singer Gráinne Yeats.\n\nYeats International Theatre Festival\n\nFrom 1989-1993, thanks to the support of Donald R. Keough, the President of the Coca-Cola Company, the Yeats Foundation sponsored a Yeats International Theatre Festival at the world-famous Abbey Theatre, the National Theatre of Ireland. Under the direction of James Flannery, the Festival featured productions of fifteen of the poet’s one act plays grouped under the following titles:\n\n-The Cuchulain Cycle: An Heroic Journey in Five Episodes\n\n-Masks of Transformation: Art and Revolution in the Modern World\n\n-Sacred Mysteries: A Celtic Way of Love and Sexuality\n\n-Yeats and Ireland’s National Identity\n\n-Art and Spirituality as a Way to Peace\n\nThe Music Director of the Yeats Festival was Bill Whelan, The Grammy Award-winning composer of Riverdance, who has often credited his work on Yeats’s plays with inspiring that phenomenally successful piece of total theater. Besides members of the Abbey Company and other distinguished Irish artists, performers in the Yeats productions included stage and film stars Ciarán Hinds in the role of the Celtic hero Cuchulain, Olwen Fouéré as Cathleen ni Houlihan and Fionnula Flanagan in the title role of The Countess Cathleen. Guest directors included master puppeteer Roman Paska and Stan Wojewodski, Director of the Yale Repertory Theatre and Dean of the Yale School of Drama. The Yeats Festival also included lectures by such major public figures, artists and scholars as President Mary Robinson of Ireland, eminent choral conductor Robert Shaw, feminist leader Betty Friedan, Northern Irish political activist Bernadette Devlin McAlliskey, novelist Ben Kiely, poets Eavan Boland, Robert Bly, Theo Dorgan, Brendan Kennelly, John Montague and Nualla ni Dhomhnaill, historians Margaret Curtin and Conor Cruise O’Brien, philosopher Mark Hederman, theologian Terence McCaughey, critics Eric Bentley, Terence Brown, Denis Donoghue, Declan Kiberd and William McCormack as well as painters Robert Ballagh and Anne Yeats, the daughter of the poet.\n\nThe Yeats International Theatre Festival was launched in 1989 with a production of Yeats’s magnus opus, the five-play “Cuchulain Cycle.” This was the first production of the full Cycle at the Abbey Theatre. Written by Yeats over a period of thirty-five years and inspired by a range of different dramatic forms from the Greeks, Shakespeare and the Japanese Noh to commedia dell’arte and German expressionism, the Cycle is a microcosm of the extraordinary achievement of Yeats the dramatist as well as a meditation on the development of Ireland during the turbulent decades of its emergence as an Independent nation.\n\nAudiences in Atlanta have also enjoyed a wide range of public events presented by the Yeats Foundation over the past thirty years, many of them at Emory University. These have included lectures by such noted figures as American Ambassador to Ireland Jean Kennedy Smith, Prime Minister of Ireland Albert Reynolds, Sein Fein leader Gerry Adams, Oscar and Tony Award-winning producer Noel Pearson, literary critics Seamus Deane, Luke Gibbons, Declan Kiberd and Robert Welch as well as historians Tim Pat Coogan and Kerby Miller.\n\nMusical events presented by the Yeats Foundation include concerts by the National Concert Orchestra of Ireland, “Atlantic Bridges: A Celebration of Northern Irish and Appalachian Artists,” singer Tommy Sands (known as the Bob Dylan of Northern Ireland), musician-scholar Mick Moloney, the Ulster-Scots Folk Orchestra, harper Janet Harbison (director of the Belfast Harp Festival), “A Tribute to John McCormack” with tenor James Flannery and “Let Ye All Be Irish Tonight: A St. Patrick’s Day Concert of Irish-American Music, Song and Dance.”\n\nExhibitions sponsored in Atlanta by the Yeats Foundation include “Homeland: Turn of the Century Ulster in Photographs,” “An Gorta Mór: The Great Irish Famine” and, in cooperation with the Margaret Mitchell House, “Fire on the Hearth: Portraits of Irish American Women.”"
