        "text": "Friday morning---time to revisit William Butler Yeats (June 13, 1865 – January 28, 1939), Irish poet, dramatist, writer and politician and winner of the 1923 Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nYeats is considered one of the key twentieth-century English-language poets. He was a Symbolist poet, using allusive imagery and symbolic structures throughout his career. He chose words and assembled them so that, in addition to a particular meaning, they suggest abstract thoughts that may seem more significant and resonant.\n\nHis use of symbols is usually something physical that is both itself and a suggestion of other, perhaps immaterial, timeless qualities. Unlike the modernists who experimented with free verse, Yeats was a master of the traditional forms.\n\nHe Remembers Forgotten Beauty\n\nWhen my arms wrap you round I press\n\nMy heart upon the loveliness\n\nThat has long faded from the world;\n\nThe jeweled crowns that kings have hurled\n\nIn shadowy pools, when armies fled;\n\nThe love-tales wrought with silken thread\n\nBy dreaming ladies upon cloth\n\nThat has made fat the murderous moth;\n\nThe roses that of old time were\n\nWoven by ladies in their hair,\n\nThe dew-cold lilies ladies bore\n\nThrough many a sacred corridor\n\nWhere such grey clouds of incense rose\n\nThat only God's eyes did not close:\n\nFor that pale breast and lingering hand\n\nCome from a more dream-heavy land,\n\nA more dream-heavy hour than this;\n\nAnd when you sigh from kiss to kiss\n\nI hear white Beauty sighing, too,\n\nFor hours when all must fade like dew.\n\nBut flame on flame, and deep on deep,\n\nThrone over throne where in half sleep,\n\nTheir swords upon their iron knees,\n\nBrood her high lonely mysteries."
