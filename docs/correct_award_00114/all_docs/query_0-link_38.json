        "text": "Yeats, W.B.\n\nLater Poems\n\nNew York: The Macmillan Company, 1924. Limited Edition. Hardcover. No. 9 of 250 copies, octavo size, 379 pp., signed by Yeats. Very good +. Item #CNIK12\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats (1865-1939) is acknowledged by many as \"supreme among modern Irish poets\". He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923 (the first Irish to be so recognized), at which time he was \"one of Dublin's great established figures, both in his own right and as the representative of the cultural renaissance which...had set in motion the Irish revolution and war of independence.\" Throughout his life, and throughout his poetry - which is still read and loved today - Yeats is recognized as supremely Irish, with his life and poetry reflective of his Irish identity.\n\n\"Later Poems\" is a collection of Yeat's work previously published between 1899 and 1921, set forth in chronological order. The work includes: \"The Wind Among the Reeds\", \"The Old Age of Queen Maeve\", \"Baile and Aillinn\", \"In the Seven Woods\", \"The Shadowy Waters\", \"From the Green Helmet and Other Poems\", \"Responsibilities\", \"The Wild Swans at Coole\", and \"Michael Robertes and the Dancer\".\n\n___DESCRIPTION: Teal cloth shelfback with brown laid paper boards, mounted paper label with black lettering and decorative border inset onto the front board, similar label on the spine, top edge rough-cut, fore- and bottom edges uncut, Yeats' signature on the limitation page tipped in before the half-title, this no. 9 of 250 copies, March publication date on the copyright page; octavo size (8\" by 5.5\"), pagination: [limitation statement] [i-vi] vii-xiii [xiv, blank] [2, sectional title, blank] [1-2] 3-363, including a \"Notes\" section at the rear with comments by Yeats.\n\n___CONDITION: Better than very good, perfectly straight corners without rubbing, a strong, square text block with solid hinges, the interior is clean and bright, and entirely free of prior owner markings; some rubbing to the head and tail of the spine, the spine label sunned, some soiling to the front board, light dustiness to the text block edges, the gutter between pp. 96 and 97 cracked but the binding still sturdy; lacking the slipcase. Even with its few faults, still a better than very good copy.\n\n___CITATION: Wade, listed with the US trade edition in no. 135 (trade edition published on April 8, 1924; this limited edition published about six months later, on September 16, 1924).\n\n___POSTAGE: International customers, please note that additional postage may apply as the standard does not always cover costs; please inquire for details.\n\n___Swan's Fine Books is pleased to be a member of the ABAA, ILAB, and IOBA and we stand behind every book we sell. Please contact us with any questions you may have, we are here to help."
