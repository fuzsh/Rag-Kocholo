        "text": "William Butler Yeats, who was born on June 13, 1865, is often regarded as one of the most accomplished poets to come from Ireland. His poetry is deeply ingrained in the national consciousness of Ireland. Some of his writings made reference to his unrequited love for Maud Gonne, who is generally regarded as his muse. Ireland was also a favorite subject for him to write about. It is also generally known that he has a curiosity about supernatural occurrences. People have a tendency to see him as a somewhat sad person due to the fact that he wrote wonderful poetry about the experience of continuously proposing to a lady who continually rejected him. (And after that, he proposed to her grown daughter, who likewise rejected him.) However, Yeats is not just the most poetically talented spurned suitor in the history of Ireland. He is also much more.\n\nWhich of William Butler Yeats’s works is considered to be his most well-known?\n\nYeats was just 21 years old when he wrote The Stolen Child in the year 1886. It is the most well-known poem from his very first book of poetry, which was published under the title The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems. It is also considered to be one of his most significant early works. Yeats had a significant interest in Irish mythology, and the poem that he wrote was inspired by Irish folklore.\n\nWhat are the reasons why William Butler Yeats was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize?\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats was given the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923 for his constantly inspiring poetry, which is a highly aesthetic form that gives expression to the soul of an entire people. This was the reason for the award.\n\nHow would you describe the writing of W.B. Yeats?\n\nYeats’ work was a shift from Romanticism to Modernism as an Artistic Movement. Yeats began his extensive creative career as a romantic poet, and during the course of his career, he progressively transitioned into a modernist poet. When he first started publishing his poetry in the 1880s, his poems had a lyrical and romantic tone, and the subject matter of his poems centered on love, yearning, and loss, as well as Irish mythology.\n\nThe Irish poet William Butler Yeats is largely regarded as one of the most significant literary figures of the 20th century.\n\nYeats’ Most Famous Poem, The Stolen Child\n\nThe Stolen Child is a ballad poem that tells a narrative. it consists of four stanzas and 53 lines, there are two types of rhyme schemes here.\n\nThe Stolen Child\n\nWhere dips the rocky highland\n\nOf Sleuth Wood in the lake,\n\nThere lies a leafy island\n\nWhere flapping herons wake\n\nThe drowsy water rats;\n\nThere we’ve hid our faery vats,\n\nFull of berrys\n\nAnd of reddest stolen cherries.\n\nCome away, O human child!\n\nTo the waters and the wild\n\nWith a faery, hand in hand,\n\nFor the world’s more full of weeping than you can understand.\n\nWhere the wave of moonlight glosses\n\nThe dim gray sands with light,\n\nFar off by furthest Rosses\n\nWe foot it all the night,\n\nWeaving olden dances\n\nMingling hands and mingling glances\n\nTill the moon has taken flight;\n\nTo and fro we leap\n\nAnd chase the frothy bubbles,\n\nWhile the world is full of troubles\n\nAnd anxious in its sleep.\n\nCome away, O human child!\n\nTo the waters and the wild\n\nWith a faery, hand in hand,\n\nFor the world’s more full of weeping than you can understand.\n\nWhere the wandering water gushes\n\nFrom the hills above Glen-Car,\n\nIn pools among the rushes\n\nThat scarce could bathe a star,\n\nWe seek for slumbering trout\n\nAnd whispering in their ears\n\nGive them unquiet dreams;\n\nLeaning softly out\n\nFrom ferns that drop their tears\n\nOver the young streams.\n\nCome away, O human child!\n\nTo the waters and the wild\n\nWith a faery, hand in hand,\n\nFor the world’s more full of weeping than you can understand.\n\nAway with us he’s going,\n\nThe solemn-eyed:\n\nHe’ll hear no more the lowing\n\nOf the calves on the warm hillside\n\nOr the kettle on the hob\n\nSing peace into his breast,\n\nOr see the brown mice bob\n\nRound and round the oatmeal chest.\n\nFor he comes, the human child,\n\nTo the waters and the wild\n\nWith a faery, hand in hand,\n\nFor the world’s more full of weeping than he can understand."
