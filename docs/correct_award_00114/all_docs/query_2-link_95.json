        "text": "On this day in 1865 Irish poet William Butler Yeats was born.\n\nIn 1923 he received the Nobel Prize for literature. Much of his best work came in his last years, including this epitaph written before his death, aged seventy-five: ‘Cast a cold eye on life, on death. Horseman, pass by’.\n\nYeats grew up as part of the Protestant ascendancy in Ireland and was disturbed by the many political changes going on. The family moved to England where he spent most of his life. His poetry is notable for its atmospheric feel, its passion and joy and its use of rhythm and sound, perhaps surprising in a man who was tone deaf.\n\nHere are some lines from The Wanderings of Oisin:\n\nWe rode in sorrow, with strong hounds three,\n\nBran, Sceolan, and Lomair,\n\nOn a morning misty and mild and fair.\n\nThe mist-drops hung on the fragrant trees,\n\nAnd in the blossoms hung the bees.\n\nWe rode in sadness above Lough Lean,\n\nFor our best were dead on Gavra’s green.\n\n..O you, with whom in sloping valleys,\n\nOr down the dewy forest alleys,\n\nI chased at morn the flying deer,\n\nWith whom I hurled the hurrying spear,\n\nAnd heard the foemen’s bucklers rattle,\n\nAnd broke the heaving ranks of battle!\n\nAnd Bran, Sceolan, and Lomair,\n\nWhere are you with your long rough hair?\n\nYou go not where the red deer feeds,\n\nNor tear the foemen from their steeds."
