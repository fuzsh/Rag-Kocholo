        "text": "Though \"Licence to Kill\" carries no numbers in its title, let us not forget that it plays Granddaddy in this summer's huge family reunion of sequels. Think of it as \"James Bond 16\"; it takes Ian Fleming's secret agent man into his 27th year in the movie. The actors playing Bond may come and go — here he is Timothy Dalton, in his second go-round — but the movie remains the same. Producer Albert (Cubby) Broccoli's formula is inviolate: Bond films open with a smoky, impressionistic title sequence that ends with a view through the barrel of a pistol. They climax with the explosion of a cavernous set, where the villain has been masterminding his take­over of the world. In between they offer girls, guns, gadgets, exotic locations and absurd stunts.\n\nBond films always have slipped merrily along on the grease of self-parody. They revel in puns, cartoony violence and a twinkle in the eye of the hero. But they have it both ways: They make sly jokes on the theme of Male Fantasy, and they also supply that fantasy in abundance.\n\nFor years and years, the series existed in an illusory past where British foreign intelligence actually mattered, where sophisticates ordered martinis and could iden­tify with a sip whether they were stirred or shaken, and where men were men and girls wore bikinis. Like Peter Pan and Hugh Hefner, James Bond refused to grow up.\n\n\"Licence to Kill,\" while following most of Broecoli's prescribed formula, gives us a Bond willing to grow up.\n\nDalton signals this transformation early on, when Bond participates in a friend's wedding without a hint of sarcasm. (Roger Moore's lips would have gone into paroxysms of smirks.) When a Latin drug lord attacks the newlyweds on their wedding night, Bond vows revenge. He breaks with his home office and, stripped of his licence to kill, goes out on his own. Bond, always the playboy on impersonal government missions, now fights out of friendship and loyalty.\n\nThen a new-fangled Bond girl (Carey Lowell) shows up. A former CIA agent, she has a bigger gun than Bond's and knows how to use it Bond finds himself in the unsettling position of asking for her help. (To assuage any fears die­hard fans may have about feminists castrating the 007 fantasy, I must point out that she carries her gun strapped in a black garter high on her shapely thigh.)\n\nThis Bond girl lives half in the past, half in the present She strips down to some pretty skimpy costumes, and she has an eye for Mr. Bond, but she insists on being called Ms. And it doesn't go in front of one of those gleefully leering monikers from the early films, such as Pussy Galore or Honey Ryder, either. The filmmakers jauntily tip their hats to Mrs. Onassis in the year of her 60th birthday, however: The name is Bouvier, Pam Bouvier.\n\nBond and Bouvier (with the tag-along Q) team up against Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi), a pock­marked Latin with lizard eyes to match the pet iguana he carries around. He's as ruthless as any Bond villain, though his goals are of the '80s. He doesn't want to take over the world, merely the world drug market\n\nSanchez operates out of the fictional Isthmus City, where he runs the casino and the largest bank, and pays El Presidente off with weekly checks. (With his pocked cheeks and his drugs-and-polities operation, he's meant to make us think of Gen. Noriega and Panama City, though the location was Mexico.)\n\nMost of Sanchez's henchmen are forgettable — no raging Jaws in this one — though there's a fun bit with Wayne Newton as a sleazy New Age televangelist working as a front for the drug operation. (His meditation room features a king-sized bed.)\n\nBroccoli, director John Glen (working on his fifth Bond film) and co-writers Michael G. Wilson (fifth) and Richard Maibaum (13th), smoothly respond to the gravity Dalton brings to Bond. There's less of the preposterous in the plot — the drug war actually seems possi­ble — and Bond is positively demure with women.\n\nThey let loose with the old silliness in the violence and the action sequences, though. They feed vic­tims to sharks and to factory grind­ers; they stage fights underwater, in the air and beneath moving tractor-trailers, and they use up plenty of dynamite.\n\nOf course, Bond spends fully half the movie in his tuxedo. For the Granddaddy of the summer, he's surprisingly agile. That's as it should be: Bond may grow up, but he will never grow old."
