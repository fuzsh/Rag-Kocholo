        "text": "After re-watching all of the James Bond movies during the past year, there's one that deserved to have a column written about it.\n\nThough seemingly unloved 27 years ago, \"Licence to Kill\" might actually be one of the best — or at least most underrated — 007 movies.\n\nMatthew Jacobson and I wrote a Bests and Worsts James Bond column in November. In there, I wrote that Daniel Craig was the closest portrayal of James Bond from the novels, with Timothy Dalton as a close second, and that's certainly still the case.\n\nHis gritty take on the character was ahead of its time. Now in 2016, Daniel Craig just ended (possibly) his stint as the most popular James Bond since Sean Connery. What if Dalton was 17 years younger and had been the star of \"Casino Royale\" in 2006? Could he have received similar notoriety?\n\n\"Licence to Kill\" follows James Bond on his quest for vengeance after drug lord Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi) escapes from prison and brutally murders the wife of Felix Leiter, Bond's best friend. After killing Felix's wife, Sanchez then tortures Felix by tossing him into a tank of sharks that wound him terribly.\n\nNow, there's an interesting tidbit from \"Licence to Kill\" that came from the novel \"Live and Let Die.\" Sanchez leaves a note on Felix's mangled body with the words \"He disagreed with something that ate him.\" In the novel version of \"Live and Let Die,\" Mr. Big tortures Felix Leiter the same way that Sanchez does in \"Licence to Kill\" and leaves the exact same note. This little part wasn't used in the film version of \"Live and Let Die\" starring Roger Moore.\n\nSo James Bond abandons MI6 to go on a quest for vengeance, hunting down the ruthless Franz Sanchez to the dangerous world of South American drug cartels. Along the way he meets feisty American agent Pam Bouvier (Carey Lowell). She's not written perfectly, but she's one of the coolest Bond girls in the series.\n\nThere's a scene where Bouvier and Bond meet at a Miami bar, and she asks him, \"Are you carrying?\" Bond flashes the Walther PPK stashed in his jacket. Bouvier then shakes her head in disappointment and pulls out a Terminator-sized shotgun from underneath the table.\n\n\"Licence to Kill\" also featured a young Benicio del Toro in his second film role. Benicio del Toro plays Sanchez's right-hand henchman, and he totally nails it. Don't expect the same Benicio del Toro from 2015's \"Sicario,\" but this young version has all the delicious villainy to be one of the better evil henchmen in a 007 movie.\n\nAnd then there's the movie's main villain, Franz Sanchez. \"Licence to Kill\" opens with James Bond and Felix Leiter running late to Felix's wedding all so they can capture Sanchez. And they do it. The opening scene before the credits ends with Bond and Leiter capturing the villain, which sets up the rest of the movie wonderfully.\n\nFelix gets married. James Bond is the best man. Everyone is happy and taking turns kissing Felix's beautiful bride (Priscilla Barnes). And then Sanchez escapes from custody and murders Felix's wife, a la \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service.\"\n\nIf you love campy Bond villains, Sanchez fits the mold. The guy walks around with a pet iguana on his shoulder. Still, he's quite different than the usual Ian Fleming-penciled villain. Sanchez is more the kind of villain you'd see in a Stallone or Van Damme movie. But he works for \"Licence to Kill\" and banters well with Timothy Dalton's James Bond.\n\nThe effects in \"Licence to Kill\" were some of the best in the series up to that point. United Artists and Eon Productions made \"Licence to Kill\" during the era when filmmakers blew up everything with actual explosions (not CGI). From James Bond commandeering a sea plane in mid flight to the climactic 18-wheeler chase through the desert, \"Licence to Kill\" is full of gritty action sequences, including the most gruesome death scene in any Bond film.\n\nGive this hidden James Bond gem a second chance. It's one that I never really heard about as a teenager, but I'm glad I stumbled upon it now. At the extreme least, \"Licence to Kill\" is one of the top tier action films from its decade.\n\nFollow Richard Briggs on Twitter, @BriggsRich.\n\nOTHER STORIES BY RICHARD BRIGGS\n\nCouch Critic: \"The Catch\" is clutch, \"Rush Hour\" gets stuck in traffic\n\nThe Flash not only helps Supergirl on screen, but also in ratings\n\n\"Scorpion\" continues to kill it week after week\n\nCouch Critic: \"Friends\" vs. \"How I Met Your Mother\""
