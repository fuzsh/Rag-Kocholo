        "text": "When we think of martini, we usually think of the (vodka) martini cocktail that Bond consumes regularly. But the brand Martini, a vermouth, is also often seen in Bond films and mentioned in Bond novels, as part of the martini cocktail.\n\nQ (Desmond Llewelyn) brings a Polaroid Spectra System Camera with deadly laser beam to James Bond (Timothy Dalton) when they are in Isthmus City in the movie Licence To Kill (1989). James Bond never uses the camera, but he and Q almost get fried when CIA agent Pam Bouvier takes a picture of them, accidentally shooting the laser beam.\n\nIn the movie Licence To Kill (1989), actor Timothy Dalton wears a dove grey felt top hat with black ribbon band from Lock & Co Hatters.\n\nJames Bond is seen holding the hat on the way to Felix Leiter's wedding and then later in the helicopter, before the hat is shot with a bullet.\n\nRolex and James Bond have a strong connection. Before Omega started supplying the watches for 007, Bond used a Rolex in several movies: Dr. No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Live and Let Die, The Man with the Golden Gun, Licence to Kill, The Living Daylights.\n\nThe Walther PPK was the weapon of choice for James Bond from the films Dr. No to Tomorrow Never Dies (except Moonraker and Octopussy) and again in Quantum of Solace and SkyFall. The gun is also mentioned in the Ian Fleming novels from Dr. No to The Man with the Golden Gun. It's the only gun / gadget that is used by all the Bond actors."
