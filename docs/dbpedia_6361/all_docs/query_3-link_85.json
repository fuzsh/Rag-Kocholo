        "text": "Licence to Kill: This is the most underrated film in the series. It's ironic that the first of the EON films not to draw its title directly from an Ian Fleming story is also the closest in spirit to Fleming since \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service.\" \"License to Kill\" features a realistic, believable story. Add to it the equal ruthlessness of Bond and Sanchez in their respective portrayals by Dalton and Davi and you have a movie that will stand out over time as one of the best in the series. Talisa Soto is also the most attractive Bond girl in the entire series. The score isn't half bad either.\n\nIf you like Fleming, you should like LTK & Dalton.\n\nI'm with @LeonardPine on this.\n\nIan Fleming's stories were larger than life, keeping one foot in reality and one in a fantastic world where mere mortals would never tread. His villains were often grotesques, his ladies ridiculously gorgeous and feminine, his hero flawed and vulnerable, but dedicated to Queen and country.\n\nSo, without dissecting his books it does strike me that LTK isn't as close to Fleming as people seem to suggest.\n\nThe film's villain is a bog standard drug baron, his cronies are weird but not exactly of the OddJob variety.\n\nThe leading lady is a woman in a man's world, desperately trying to prove herself equal to any man. Pussy Galore was like that, but she was barely featured in the story, and not exactly in to men.\n\nBond in the film is a vigilante, beating up fellow agents, refusing his orders, showing no respect to M.\n\nThe story had no sense of the absurd, no larger than life villain, no fantastic plotline. It was suitably serious, but the pace of the film meant it captured none of Fleming's class or elegance. It just bull dozed through, with Bond acting before he thinks and getting others killed (the Chinese agents).\n\nI hear excuses about audiences not being ready for a serious Bond, but I was there and believe me, we were ready. But we wanted someone who could enter a casino and all the heads would turn (like Connery). We got starched, snarling Timothy Dalton in an ill fitting tuxedo and the worst haircut in the history of the series (possibly the world).\n\nThe director who had kept TLD bouncing along at a fine old clip, with good humour and fine spectacle, seemed to lose all of his abilities here. It was a nasty film full of bad tempered people and nothing really to make one cheer for anyone, not even Q.\n\nNot the worst in the series (although my least favourite), but neither is it the homage to Fleming that people think."
