        "text": "Licence to Kill must go down as one of the absolute best James Bond adventures of all time! It’s daring attitude to risk emboldens my love for it, as does its far darker and more serious tone than had previously been seen in other Bond features. It is easily director John Glen’s finest work, with For Your Eyes Only coming in at a close second, and one that bucked the trend many Bond films had been following for over 15 years.\n\nLicence also has some of the best Bond villains ever portrayed in the series. From the ruthless, pitted-skinned drug lord Sanchez (Robert Davi) to the crazed, wild-eyed henchman Dario (Benicio del Toro), the film makes a deliberate effort to place Bond in realistic mortal danger with believably evil characters. Gone are the giant nuclear warheads fired from hidden volcano lairs, gone are the villains with physical deformities or ludicrously labyrinthine hidden fortresses. Instead we are treated to a rip-roaring action film where Welshman Timothy Dalton finally comes into his own as the tough as nails Agent 007 that Ian Fleming had originally penned.\n\nFor number 43 in this list my choice goes to arguably one of the bloodiest and most brutal deaths of any villain in the entire series. Namely the complete disintegration of Sanchez’s right-hand man Dario inside a giant cocaine shredder. For a film as dark and serious as Licence is this scene couldn’t be more perfect in summing up Dalton’s Bond. He, at the end of the day, is an assassin above all else. A man who puts his life on the line to complete the task at hand. Usually his own survival. His attitude is constantly serious, even during more playful moments, and his dedication to seeking revenge for his friend Felix Leiter never falters. It is fitting then that we see him play out what could be argued is one of the darkest, most brutal death knell moments to a villain the franchise has ever created.\n\nDel Toro’s performance throughout the movie is very compelling. His eyes blaze with an intensity which, when combined with his creepy Cheshire cat-like grin, becomes quite honestly disturbing. Throughout the film and up to his final scene we see someone completely loyal to Sanchez, a person that most likely views his boss as more of a father figure. This is never officially revealed but is artistically implied by the way in which both actors play off each other. Sanchez provides for him, gives him work and respect, but just like how there is no honour among thieves, Sanchez is happy to send him to his certain death without a moments hesitation in the hope of killing Bond.\n\nIn the big final set-piece of the film 007 uses his charm and cleverness to convince Sanchez that he is on his side. This gives him access to the drug lords gigantic underground factory where cocaine is converted into fuel and then placed inside gasoline tankers for transportation. After Dario recognizes Bond from a previous encounter 007 starts a fire that spreads rapidly throughout the base.\n\nBeaten and with his wrists cuffed, Bond is placed on a conveyor belt that leads straight down to a massive metal shredder, crushing bricks of cocaine into white powder instantaneously. As he descends further down the belt Bond is able to use the cuffs to hook onto the very end of the conveyor, leaving him hanging mere inches away from danger. While the base crumbles Sanchez orders Dario to cut the straps on 007’s wrists and quickly escapes the raging inferno. As Dario’s knife slashes Bond’s wrist (a real injury that occurred during an actual take on set) the Bond girl of film Pam Bouvier (Carey Lowell) saves the day by running up to the conveyor and shooting Dario.\n\nDespite being shot he is still able to laugh menacingly until Bond grabs his right foot and drags him down into the shredder. The next few seconds are quite excruciating to watch as we see Dario scream his head off trying to claw back up over Bond. The original DVD of the film (the first and so far only Bond film to be given a 15 rating by the BBFC) had cut out some of the more gory shots that wouldn’t be restored until the 2006 “ultimate editions” were released on disc in conjunction with Casino Royale.\n\nDario’s screams of agony are painfully edited with shots of what remains of his legs being minced through the shredder, whilst Bond holds on for dear life. The final shot of Dario we see is his face screaming out before falling down completely into the shredder, with the once white but now blood red powder of the cocaine filling the screen. This sequence is made all the more horrifying when we hear del Toro’s pleas for Sanchez, again fueling the idea of the father/son bond that the pair had shared.\n\nMichael Kamen’s score is particularly effective with the high-pitched string work stirring up feelings of tension when we see Bond pull Dario down the conveyor. The scene ends with Bouvier asking 007, who is still hanging from the conveyor, if he is alright. In a typically Welsh reply Dalton shouts “Switch the BLOODY MACHINE off!”. A classic moment in a Bond film if there ever was one."
