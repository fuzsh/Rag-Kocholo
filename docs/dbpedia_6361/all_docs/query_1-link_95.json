        "text": "Many may have forgotten Dalton’s time as the iconic agent, but whether you remember him or not, it’s worth sinking your teeth into.\n\nFull Review | Apr 23, 2024\n\nThis is far from a terrible movie as it is easy to sit through and has plenty of enjoyable moments but it also isn't well balanced enough to be a classic.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: B- | Aug 28, 2022\n\nLicence to Kill is just the shot in the arm the James Bond series has been needing.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Aug 5, 2022\n\nLicence to Kill is a different beast entirely. Violent, barbaric, and untamed - this was everything that James Bond decidedly was not. It was here that Dalton's ideal of Fleming's agent crystallized.\n\nFull Review | Sep 4, 2021\n\nThe level of violence is unlike any other of the series, making the chief antagonist more formidable, memorable, and ultimately less fun.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 6/10 | Sep 6, 2020\n\nDaniel Craig shows the grit, the determination and vulnerability that Bond has...Dalton did that years before!\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Jul 16, 2020\n\nIt may not be up your alley if you're just into Bond films, but it you're in the mood for an old fashioned action film, you can do far, far worse than sticking this film on.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Jan 14, 2020\n\nLacks a bit of that Bond magic. Perhaps not the cruder, formulaic elements of other Bond films, but the lightness of touch and inherent charm in the character of Bond himself.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Oct 29, 2019\n\nSome of 007's earlier adventures fail to hold up, but in a post-'Taken' world, 'Licence to Kill' certainly aged well and is a under-appreciated gem in the Bond catalog.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 8/10 | Nov 2, 2015\n\nLicence to Kill gets better as it unfolds for more than two hours. It just takes an insufferably long while to find the right pace.\n\nFull Review | May 20, 2014\n\nLicence to Kill ranks as one of the best of the 16 Bond films, thanks to Dalton's athletic, tough and deadly new 007.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | May 20, 2014\n\nAs unlikely as it seems, Mr. Dalton actually appears to be growing in the Bond role, which is potentially stifling because its own popularity has so rigidly defined it.\n\nFull Review | May 20, 2014\n\nThis series' record of maintaining an admirable level of quality stays intact, even if this film might best be used as a cinematic appetizer to see before renting a tape of one of the Connery or Moore classics.\n\nFull Review | May 20, 2014\n\nEvery once in a while, [the Bond series] pulls in its stomach, pops the gun from its cummerbund, arches its eyebrow and gets off another bull's-eye. The newest, Licence to Kill, is probably one of the five or six best of Bond.\n\nFull Review | May 20, 2014"
