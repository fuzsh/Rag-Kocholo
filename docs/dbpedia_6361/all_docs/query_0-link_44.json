The movie has it all according to the formula-exotic locales, the girls, action, one liners etc. But does it still stack up 27 years later?\n\nThe fashion is definitely from the era-a main bad guy in a pink polo shirt! The action is good and typical Dalton; edgy, no soft options here, a real killer doing his job. The scene where he throws the suitcase of $2 million cash to the crooked DEA agent, and knocks him into the shark tank to get eaten reminded me of Moore's scene with the killer in FYEO, where he nudges the car over the edge of the cliff with a bit of a push. There is no doubt Dalton's Bond wanted to kill this guy and had no qualms about it.\n\nThe girls? Talisa Soto's character as the main bad guy's girlfriend who helps Bond out was pretty good, believable enough. Carey Lowell's character Pam Bouvier was a modern Bond girl-she could fly a plane, hold her own in a bar fight and handle a gun as good as the next guy. Some weak acting aside, she reminded me of Pussy Galore and Jinx.\n\nThe bad guys were great bad guys-Robert Davi and Anthony Zerbe nailed their roles. And cool to see Desmond Llewellyn as Q again, although it was a bit of a stretch to have him deployed in the field.\n\nAll in all, a pretty decent installment in the series, and a shame that Dalton didn't get to do another one.\n\nWhat d'you reckon?\n\nI just watched this the other day too in my Bond marathon.\n\nOne fashion statement that sticks out to me is Dalton's hair, it is so of the time like Connery in DAF or Brosnan in GE.\n\nAs for the characters Carey Lowell/Pam Bouvier was always charming to me, bless her heart and Wayne Newton as Professor Joe Butcher is hilarious. Robert Davi / Franz SÃ¡nchez does a great job and I like when he kinda starts to lose control near the end, \"Then I guess it's time to start cutting overhead.\" This guy seems like someone you want on your side but you have to walk around on egg shells to do so. Q's role in this IMO is a lot of fun, I laughed out loud when I saw him in that fake mustage.\n\nThe action is great and fresh. Bond crashing that drug deal was one of the best action sequences in the series. I love it when he is water skiing and the Bond theme starts up. The ending action sequence seemed to also have been well thought out.\n\nI just love the ending credits song, \"If you ask me to\" probably even more then the title song.\n\nStill holds up to me.\n\nCan't summons the love for this film that so many folks on here describe. I watched the films (and read all the Fleming novels) from the beginning, as they came out. YOLT was distressing, though still fun. The Moore era started weakly, but hit its stride in the 3rd film (TSWLM), and then became too cartoon--ish, and buffoon-ish, but they reeled it in. Oops, a bit overdone in that regard and then OP, like DAF, was grand fun with a mature, experienced Bond with whom the audience was very familiar and regarded very fondly. It should have ended Moore's run, but one more: VTAK and it was quite a letdown and it definitely was time for a new actor and bringing the films back to a hard edge. TLD did not enjoy the anticipation of a new Bond that benefitted GE and CR, perhaps because they'd gone on just too long with Moore, and the series might have benefitted from an additional year off and build-up of audience anticipation. But LTK was too much of another rogue-cop-vs-drug-lord film, a movie of the week in appearance. The jealous Pam bit was absolutely ridiculous and childish. Fine actors were wasted playing TV-movie-of-the-week villains. This was not the first time this sort of villain-and-plot contributed to some blandness -- LALD suffered, too, from having a criminal who'd be prosecuted by US DEA presented, instead, as Bond's adversary. In this regard, it was yet another occasion of wondering, awash in disappointment: \"Don't the producers learn from their errors ???\" And then that was it. No more Dalton as Bond. It was quite a wasted opportunity. They should have realized the story and villain were too familiar, far too ordinary and just pretended it had been made, and made, instead, what would have been Dalton's third, as his second.\n\nI haven't seen LTK in a long time, but have always defended it. Yes, the fashion and haircuts are dated. But if you filmed this script today--Latin American drug lords, corrupt politicians--it'd still be up to date. Those stories could happen now. And the action scenes are terrific. The plot is quite logical too, especially if you read the novelisation explaining how Professor Joe Butcher sets the cocaine prices on his televangelist show while he's friggin' on TV!\n\nBut it really misses John Barry. Kamen did a serviceable job, especially with the 9 minutes \"Licence Revoked\" track. And the title track should have tied in to the plot and theme more. How about a Gloria Estefan song for Miami and Key West? Gladys Knight? She was uncomfortable with the lyrics. Too bad we never heard the Eric Clapton theme. Imagine if Sting and he collaborated as they did on \"It's Probably Me\" for Lethal Weapon?\n\nThat summer, 007 was out Bonded by Lethal Weapon 2, Indiana's Last Crusade, and Batman. But it's the only movie EON made that felt like a Fleming novel, from when he finds Felix and Della all the way right down to Bond's exhaustion at the end of the truck chase. They didn't get close to that again until CR and QoS nearly two decades later.\n\nThere is also a lot of symbolism with fallen angels and dark vengeful angels in this movie (\"You're dead.\" Bond parachuting from the sky in the PTS, then rising from the depths to water ski and take over the cartel's plane, Pam saving him, and Bond jumping into the pool with her at the finale's end.)\n\nAnd I want TWO more Dalton films, '91 and '93, not just a third!\n\nOf all the films in the canon (barring perhaps GE), LTK is the one that has had the biggest turnaround in terms of my thoughts on it.\n\nWhen I was younger, I had bunched LTK with LALD at the bottom of the barrel (LALD has remained there, now enjoying the company of TMWTGG). I found LTK to lack the Bond flair that basically every other entry provides. It wasn't the down-to-Earth villain which irked me (I've always loved Sanchez as a character), but some combination of the villain's scheme (or lack thereof), the cheap looking aesthetics, and a lack of real panache. It just didn't feel Bondian.\n\nNow Licence To Kill probably sits just outside my top five Bond movies. Dalton is on fire (as is basically the rest of the cast), the plot is incredibly engaging, and the down-to-Earth aesthetics fit the film wonderfully. (In fact, had it looked less cheap and more Bondian, I'd probably rank the film lower.) There is a sense of realism to this film which, in my opinion, every other entry in the canon lacks.\n\nIn fact, I'd love it if more Bond films were made in this vein (albeit without the revenge / rogue plot, which has since been used to death). A real thriller. And I think Craig would be perfect for this type of stripped back Bond film.\n\nIt hasn't aged well. As others have mentioned, the fashions date it far more than most other Bond films. Kamen's score sounds suspiciously similar to his music for Lethal Weapon 2 (was he doing them simultaneously?) and it feels a little tired. John Glen was on his 5th Bond film by this stage and I think it shows. Aside from Sanchez, the characterisation is a bit dull and Talisa Soto is woeful as is the token Moneypenny scene which actually FEELS like a token scene. The fight scenes are lacklustre and the bad guys are faceless and bland. Even the title sequence is uninspired.Everyone, bar Dalton and Davi just seems to be going through the motions a bit\n\nHaving said all that, the story is engaging and the tanker chase is one of the best sequences in the entire series. Desmond Llewellyn is given an opportunity to play a more active role and really rises to the occasion. EON should have had more credit in 1989 for trying something new. Maybe a change of director after The Living Daylights would have completed that fresh perspective.\n\nAlthough it felt like an eternity, I think Bond, rather like Doctor Who, which was cancelled the same year, really benefited from having a rest for a few years..\n\nEdited by hilly, 20 October 2016 - 02:54 PM.\n\nMy overall impression of LTK at the time was that it was low-budget. From Bond's off-the-rack wardrobe to Kamen's lackluster score, the down-to-earth plot, Glen's workmanlike direction, one guy's \"death by a drawer full of cold, cooked pasta\" and the almost complete lack of marketing here in the states, it just felt like \"Bond on the cheap.\" It was the first Bond I ever relegated to \"also-ran\" status when listing the event movies of its year.\n\nI think the film suffers from being too derivative of the glut of \"revenge\" and \"drug war\" movies of the era, as typified by Steven Segal (it even has a three-word title like every Segal film). And while Dalton does \"lethal and angry\" better than any Bond actor, that's still not what I crave in a Bond film. Guys like Segal and Chuck Norris are perfect for testosterone-driven alpha-male fantasy films, but couldn't fake sophistication and class on a bet. Bond, on the flip side, oozes class but is ill-suited to the \"gorilla with a machine gun\" genre. If I want to see a guy getting sweaty and dirty and spattered with his enemies' blood, I'll go somewhere other than a 007 film. (They try to have it both ways when Sanchez says he \"knew\" Bond was a British agent because \"you have class.\" What he based that judgement on, I couldn't say. Also, this almost counts as a \"meta\" reference. Why would anyone imagine a British spy should necessarily have class, unless they'd seen a Bond movie?)\n\nOn the plus side, I love the \"farewell to arms\" scene. I'm a sucker for any scene with tension between Bond and M. We got some great ones with Dalton, plus a couple with Laz and at least one, for a second or two, with Connery, but this one's arguably the best. And for all my griping about \"revenge\" and bloodlust, Bond's murder of Killifer is awesome, especially when Sharkey looks away but Bond keeps looking, with an expression that says, \"Hmm...rough way to go. But not rough enough.\" The stunt work is uniformly great and it helps that Dalton did as many of his own stunts as they'd let him (and a couple they didn't want him to!). Also, even if this plot doesn't fit my preferred approach to Bond, I have to admit it does at least have a real sense of momentum and occasional suspense, which is more than I can say about a lot of entries in the series. Sanchez is a strong villain and Davi makes him genuinely scary at points. His demise is one of the better in the series, with the \"poetic justice\" of the (Felix) lighter thrown in.\n\nMy wife enjoyed it a lot better than I did, I gather because it largely chucked the formula, moved quickly and made the stakes very human and relatable. She was alternately bored with and exasperated by a lot of the earlier Bonds. At the time, I saw it as the beginning of a shift to a new approach to the series, and I was okay with that if my wife was an example of the new audience it might bring in. As it turned out, we instead got a 6-year hiatus and then an overly cautious, 4-film retreat to formula that made me appreciate LTK's risk-taking much more.\n\nOverall, entertaining enough, but usually not one I choose to pop in the player."
