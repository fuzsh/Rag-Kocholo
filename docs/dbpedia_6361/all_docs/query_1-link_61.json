        "text": "Timothy Dalton is such a great Bond. Honestly he might be my favorite in regards to what he brings to the role and character but I wouldn’t feel comfortable choosing a favorite until I’d rewatched all of them to give a proper assessment. Suffice to say, I enjoyed “Licence to Kill” though. This is a personal story and through it gives more depth to the world that Bond inhabits. I’ll get into more of what I mean in the review. If you like the Bond films, this one is well worth checking out though.\n\nThe film was directed by John Glen and written by Michael Wilson and Robert Broccoli.\n\nThe story follows Bond (Timothy Dalton) seeking revenge against the drug lord Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi) after his gang murders his best friend Felix’s wife Della (Priscilla Barnes) and leaves Felix (David Hedison) mortally wounded. Bond goes rogue seeking revenge against him.\n\nSPOILERS ahead\n\nThe Pros:\n\nThe Premise – The idea of Bond going rogue in order to get revenge is compelling. Bond having to depend on his mind and cleverness over his gadgets is Bond at his best and Dalton captures that driver and cleverness extremely well.\n\nThe Soundtrack – The soundtrack is intense and does a great job capturing the tension of scenes. Michael Kamen knows action and it helps the film as he captures what is at stake and uses the music to elevate the action and characters.\n\nThe Action – There are a lot of great action scenes in this, with my favorite being an underwater fight that leads to Bond hijacking a drug smuggling plane. None of the others reach that height as the other tends to drag on longer which takes away from how fun they are.\n\nFranz Sanchez – Robert Davi does a good job at being a threatening drug lord. We see that he has some version of honor as he treats those right he believes he to be loyal. He is also super paranoid so easy for Bond to manipulate and his ego and bully nature keep him from being a great villain. He is good but the character doesn’t reveal anything about the CIA, MI6 or Bond in what he does, which is a shame.\n\nQ – Q is like Bond’s dad in this as he shows up from out of nowhere and gives him the gadgets he needs to take down Sanchez. He is a lot of fun and I really liked how he was able to get under Bond’s skin both in a joking and friendly way. Desmond Llewelyn truly inhabits this role. I’m glad he got to play it for so long.\n\nLupe Lamora – Lupe is Sanchez’s girlfriend and the biggest factor in taking him down as it is her trying to escape that leads to Bond and Felix capturing him initially before one of their own betrays them. She is great in the role as she find subtle ways to fight back against Franz. She gets a happy ending too as she gets all of the Sanchez money once she takes him down. She rose from nothing and ends up a Queen. It is a pretty great arc. Talisa Soto did great.\n\nPam Bouvier – Carey Lowell’s CIA informant is a character who keeps helping out against Bond’s vendetta even when he doesn’t want it. Without her and Q’s help he would have died so I can see why she takes Bond’s open cheating so personally. This was a character who needed more backstory to be more though. She is extremely effective at combat and prepared for anything but we never get more exploration of how she ended up where she is.\n\nJames Bond and his Allies – Bond spends this film pushing people away to protect them but needing them in order to survive and succeed. It is a nice push and pull and the loss of his wife is mentioned as a reason behind his fear of loss. It is subtle but I liked how even as he clashed with his friends he still won because they ignored him and came through.\n\nBond’s Connection and Loss – Loss is what motivates Bond more than anything in this film. The loss of his wife, his friend and the friends he loses during the course of the film. The vendetta like that against SPECTRE is personal and it is neat how the film explores that in Bond’s actions.\n\nThe Cons:\n\nBond at his Cheatiest – Bond bounces between Lupe and Pam in front of them. This is Bond at his cheatiest and it is annoying, especially when you have Q making excuses for him to Pam. Just make up your mind Bond and stop being a dick.\n\nSanchez’s Endgame and lack of Colonial Critique – Sanchez was just after money and power and because of that it easy for Bond to take him down. These are simple aspects of Ego when him having men kicked out of the Contras means we could have got an amazing critique of Colonialism in South America. Instead Sanchez has no real depth beyond ego and the film fails to be elevated.\n\nOverlong Ending Action – The ending action goes on for a long time. There is a fight in the factory, a cocaine truck chase with an airplane involved and a fist fight. The whole sequence could have been cut in half and the film would have been better for it for as cool as some scenes are we lose character because of it.\n\nI really liked this film even though I think it could have easily deeper with another re-write (you are exploring drugs and the CIA in South America, this is rife for critique and depth) but overall it does hold up as a revenge film and an exploration of Bond and his motivation. If you like this Franchise, check it out. Timothy Dalton is truly underrated.\n\nFinal Score: 8.6 / 10"
