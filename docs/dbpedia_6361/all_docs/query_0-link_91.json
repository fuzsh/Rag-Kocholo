The James Bond 007 ASTON MARTIN DB5 joins the collection of other Bond Cars entering the Garage over time, but what should be next?\n\nDID YOU KNOW?? In the books, author Ian Fleming had specified an earlier Aston Martin DB Mark III as Bond’s car… but the DB5 was introduced in the 1964 Bond film GOLDFINGER, equipped with gadgets including machine guns, smoke screens, oil slicks, an ejector seat, and rotating license plates. And that move was historical as it cemented Cars as Characters in film.\n\nAlso in today’s blast is a natural evolution to modern films with a ZOMBIE TRUCK SKETCH! Who wants to color this one? Should I do a bloody ZOMBIE COLORING BOOK? Might be cool…\n\nSEMA is coming… and as you know, there are a lot of reasons to go. Fireball shows us a couple of them, but MODIFIED CARS, KUSTOMS and UNIQUE IDEAS are why we go. And… FOOD. Who’s comin? Fireball’s SKETCH SIGNING SCHEDULE is coming soon!\n\nToday’s BEST OF SHOW… Fireball rides a SINGLE WHEEL RYNO BIKE! WATCH!!\n\n*Your Favorite MOVIE & TV CARS on Canvas, Mugs, Tees… and MORE!\n\n**UNSUBSCRIBE by sending an email to askfireball@fireballtim.com with UNSUBSCRIBE in the Subject Line. Done.\n\n***THANK YOU for LEAVING A REVIEW if you’ve snagged something from the Garage! It really helps to create more coolness!\n\n****10% of all Sales goes to DOG RESCUES, so THANK YOU!\n\nMore »"
