        "text": "After I'd seen TLD at the cinema, I became a big Bond fan. The moment I got home I watched GF and TSWLM on VHS. But as cool as these were, Dalton was still my favourite, I wanted another Dalton film. Which is why I was heart broken when I found out this was a 15, so I couldn't get into the cinema to see it.\n\nI got the VHS for Christmas one year, and after I'd seen it, I knew straight away that it had overtaken TLD as my favourite Bond film.\n\nEverything about the film impresses me. From the epic PTS to the final tanker chase, there's never a dull moment. And I didn't realise it when I first watched it as a kid, but it really explores the character of Bond. Dalton takes his portrayal to the extreme. In TLD we get hints of Bond being unhappy with his job (the whole stuff my orders bit), and Felix being attacked seems be the straw that broke the camels back. Bond is rogue and Dalton really shows his brutal, more sadistic side. It's still the Bond we know but he's been tipped over the edge and the darker side which was always evident in films before is fully realised, as well as the human side. Bond really cares about Felix and Della and he's at his most human here since OHMSS.\n\nThe film manages to feel dark and gritty without going too far from the Bond formula. All the regular Bond elements are there, but they're used in new intresting ways, like Q, who goes out of his way to help Bond and gets stuck in, something we don't normally see.\n\nThe action is brilliant. People say that LTK doesn't feel like a Bond movie, but how can you say that when it's full of epic stunts like plane fishing, plane water skiing, and the final tanker chase, all done for real. Dalton is the best part of the film, he really gives it his all and he does something new and original with the character. I also heard that Dalton helped the other actors while Glen just wanted to plan the next big action scene, shows he really cared about Bond.\n\nThe story is great. Bond at first tries to kill Sanchez, but then after being attacked and becoming friends with Sanchez he decides a better revenge would be destroying his operation from the inside. He does this, and things get really tense, especially as Sanchez is so keen on loyalty, you don't want Bond to get found out. Dario is a great, memorable and threatening henchman, Lupe is hot and Pam is a great character who is just as hot as Lupe. Then there's Robert Davi as Sanchez. IMO the best villian of the entire series, threatening, brutal, great lines, a memorable gimmick, you know he's a man that you wouldn't want to be on the bad side of.\n\nLTK is my favourite Bond film and it contains my favourite scene of the series. When James Bond, covered in blood, sand and coke, after having his cover blown, escaping an exploding drug lab, leaping onto a moving plane while being shot at and surviving an explosive tanker chase, finally ends up facing a machete wielding Sanchez.\n\nSanchez is about to kill him when Bond says \"don't you want to know why?\" and draws a lighter, the one Felix gave him. Sanchez looks at him in shock then Bond sets fire to him, Bond stumbles off into the desert as Sanchez blows himself up via the tanker.\n\nBond collapses onto a rock and stares back at the burning wreckage and breaths a sigh of relief. He's got his revenge and it's finally all over.\n\nI can't think of another moment where Bond has earned his victory more. It's a great moment, brilliantly acted that shows just how badass and resilient Bond is.\n\nAnd it sums up the franchise in a wierd, unintentional sort of way. It doesn't matter how many legal issues there are, how many other spy series' claim to be the best, it doesn't matter if there's a writers strike or a bad movie: Bond will carry on and will always come out on top.\n\nSadly though, even though it was pretty successful in most places, for some reason Licence To Kill didn't do too well in America. And this was the last Dalton film :( But we'll always have this one and TLD to remember how brilliant and ahead of his time the man was.\n\nThat was Licence To Kill. Final Thoughts? Amazing\n\nSo to begin with, we have a really good gunbarrel to kick off the film. Now unlike The Living Daylights, we get a really good cast of characters. We have Sanchez the main baddie played by Robert Davi and he is just the perfect blend of evil, sinister, cocky, classy and badass and Davi does it amazingly. We also have probably my favorite Bond girl with Pam Bouvier, who is pretty skilled and badass but also adds lots of fun humor and moments to the film such as when she reacts to the Vodka Martini, the Camera Laser and of course the famous scene of her mocking Lupe.\n\nThis film also has imo Desmond's best performance as Q in the film series, not only is he more involved here but he's also up to his usual humorous self here and I very much appreciate it. I also think Dario and Milton Krest were pretty decent henchmen and played their roles well. And of course we get the return of David Hedison as Felix and he's as great as ever. This film also has imo a pretty good and underappreciated score that works really well with each scene.\n\nThere's also great action, Great Humor filled moments and Tension. I also quite liked the more serious and dark tone, this movie pulled it off very well imo because while it was more dark it kept the signature bond elements that make Bond what it is, and imo it's the only time Bond going rouge was done correctly. And last but not least I wanna mention that the plot is very simple but effective which is a star contrast from the previous film, oh and we get a good performance by Dalton as Bond here.\n\nNow This movie isn't flawless I'm afraid. For starters I think that Bond often overacts and argues with people far to much, I get that Felix nearly died but him constantly bickering with Pam when she's right and telling her to go home so many times is just tiring to see. Speaking of Pam that love scene between her and Bond on the boat made 0 sense and felt incredibly forced, I feel their moment should've been saved for the end of the film.\n\nAnother flaw is..wtf was up with those Ninjas and that MI6 agent working for sanchez? They weren't exactly explained very well which is not exactly a good thing. Another thing with this film is that well sometimes the movie looks cheaply made, granted it doesn't take me out of the film or ruin it but it is something worth noting. I also feel as if the character of Lupe is just plain bad and feels like a parody of a typical bond girl, like her love for James is so ridiculous and just stupid, she feels like she's there for Eye candy alone but she isn't a total waste I suppose.\n\nAnd last but not least I need to say this, whoever was the hair stylist for Dalton in the Casino needs to be fired, that count Dracula haircut is awful plain and simple.\n\nBut in the end, Licence To Kill is a fantastic Bond film and it's a lot of fun to watch, sure it has its issues but I don't think they overshadow the overall greatness of this one, and imo they finally got Dalton right with this one, just a shame this would be his last\n\nMy final rating is a 9/10\n\nAs time passes the more I seem to enjoy LTK, which eliminates the silly moments that often spoilt my enjoyment of the Moore era, and were still somewhat in evidence during TLD. Overall the action is still not entirely \"realistic\", because that's not what James Bond movies are about, but it does contain some more \"gritty\" moments, which are a welcome addition in my opinion.\n\nThis time around I watched the Dalton movies with my Mum and now she rates him second only to Connery, although she loves Roger, from his days as the Saint, and also likes PB (Lazenby not so much).\n\nI enjoyed the whole wedding related opening, which ends with a very James Bond flourish, triumphally parachuting into the ceremony after capturing the villain\n\nSome decent action around the research centre, although I think they could have added a few actual living larvae/maggots into the food draw mix, as the fake ones looked very fake, all moving up and down in unison like popcorn, rather than wriggling independently in that way which makes your skin crawl. I mean, how expensive can real larvae/maggots be?\n\nThen (shock, horror) Bond goes rogue... but not so rogue that he doesn't still get support from Moneypenny and Q. In fact this must be the high water mark of Desmond Llewelyn's incarnation of Q, as he helps out on the mission as well as supplying equipment.\n\nMore good work in and around the Wavecrest, where rogue Bond acquires a bankroll to fund his operations, and even the battle in the Florida bar seemed better to me this time around.\n\nSuitably luxurious bank and hotel in Isthmus City. Bond tries his hand at Blackjack? Why not, it's quite similar to Baccarrat in it's basic principles. Bond the sniper makes another appearance, Dalton seemed keen to put more emphasis on this aspect of the character.\n\nThe villains mansion is spectacular (Villa Arabesque in Acapulco) and his main lair (Otomi Ceremonial Centre in Mexico) is also outstanding, if somewhat under used? Also it was destroyed way too easily, I mean, Bond throws a couple of beakers of petrol about and the whole place goes up? I know it's a Bond movie, but even so, it should take a little bit more than that?\n\nhttps://www.atlasobscura.com/places/centro-ceremonial-otomi\n\nGreat final truck chase, apart from one spell breaking moment of silliness worthy of \"Rog Bond\", namely the truck wheelie through the fire.\n\nIMO Robert Davi is one of the better Bond villains and gets plenty of scope to demonstrate the depths of his evil and cruelty, so we don't have to take it on faith, and he meets a suitably gruesome end.\n\nThis time I didn't feel Benicio del Toro was underused after all (considering he was virtually unknown at the time). It had already been demonstrated several times that physically he was no match for Bond in a fair fight, so he went out the right way.\n\nAnthony Zerbe is always a dependable sleazy villain and Everett McGill always dependable as an unlikeable punk.\n\nDavid Hedison does well as the first 2 time Felix Leiter, but finally pays the price for being a friend of James Bond... however Felix the character recovered remarkably well and continues to appear in subsequent editions, something which gives me hope that he will rise again following his most recent setback in NTTD.\n\nFrank McRae also brings the necessary instant likeability needed in a Bond sidekick who doesn't get a lot of face time, so that the audience can still feel a degree of sadness at his demise.\n\nCary Suzuki is charismatic as usual, and sadly under used. IMO he would have made a great reincarnation of Tiger Tanaka, or main villain in his own right in some alternative universe Bond film.\n\nI never warmed to Carey Lowell, and found Talisa Soto much more appealing. I like Caroline Bliss as Moneypenny. Unfortunately my subconscious remembered Pricilla Barnes from \"Threes Company\" which was a nagging distraction.\n\nEdging ahead of TLD on my Dalton ranking dues to having a more convincing ending"
