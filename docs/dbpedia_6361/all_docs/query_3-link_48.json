        "text": "Mike Pigott looks at Matchbox’s second and final entry in the James Bond diecast model stakes. To coincide with the 1989 film Licence To Kill, the company released a set of four models that bore little resemblance to anything seen on the big screen.\n\nWhile Corgi had been the model company most associated with the James Bond franchise throughout the 1960s and ’70s, financial problems meant that in 1985 the 007 licence found its way to Matchbox. Lesney Products had rarely produced character toys, but Matchbox was now owned by Universal Toys of Hong Kong which was more receptive to TV and film franchises. Matchbox issued a pair of miniature-sized models to tie in with A View to a Kill in 1985, and followed this up with a four-piece set based on Licence To Kill and 1989.\n\nIn 1985, Matchbox had produced two brand new castings to tie in with A View to a Kill – a Rolls-Royce and a Renault taxi (click here). However, the Licence To Kill model set didn’t merit any new items, and had to make do with four existing castings.\n\nNO LIVING DAYLIGHTS\n\nFor some reason, Matchbox did not produce any models for the next Bond film, The Living Daylights (1987), which introduced Timothy Dalton in the role of James Bond. This was quite disappointing, as this movie featured two of the most exciting cars used in the 007 films: an Aston Martin V8 Volante convertible, and the Aston Martin V8 Vantage coupe with retractable ski outriggers. As a result, there were no model car tie-ins for this film until Corgi and Johnny Lightning both made models of the V8 Vantage over a decade later.\n\nLICENCE TO KILL\n\nLicence to Kill (1989) was the sixteenth Bond film, and featured Timothy Dalton in his second and final appearance as 007. At this time, the character of Bond was in danger of becoming outdated; as a Cold War spy, he was becoming slightly irrelevant in a world where communism was falling apart and the USSR was opening up. As a result, his new film was intended to be more realistic and deal with real-life scenarios, rather than more communist agents or super villains such as Jaws.\n\nAt the time, Colombian drug lords such as Pablo Escobar were seen as one of the world’s most serious threats. Escobar controlled the world cocaine trade, and made more money than the rest of Colombia’s industries combined. There was little the government could do to stop him, as he either bribed or killed all of his opponents, under his motto “Plata o Plomo” (“silver or lead”, literally “the money or the bullet”).\n\nLicence to Kill pitted Bond against a powerful and brutal South American drug lord. However, to avoid alienating foreign audiences, the cocaine kingpin was renamed Franz Sanchez, and he was based in the fictitious location of ‘Isthmus City’. The movie was largely filmed in Mexico, and as a result it looked nothing like Colombia.\n\nThe film opened with Bond in Florida to act as best man at the wedding of his CIA friend Felix Leiter, but prior to the ceremony, the two are called out to catch the escaping Franz Sanchez (Robert Davi), which they accomplish by lassoing the tail of his light plane with the winch of a Coast Guard helicopter. However, Sanchez bribes his guards and escapes custody, and has Felix thrown to the sharks and his new bride murdered. An angry Bond finds Leiter, alive but disfigured, and heads off unauthorized to Sanchez’s home base of Isthmus City to get revenge, joining forces with a female soldier of fortune named Pam Bouvier (Carey Lowell).\n\nMATCHBOX RETURNS\n\nMatchbox again obtained the franchise for Bond, but once more were somewhat hamstrung by the fact that there were no exciting cars used in the film; the more ‘realistic’ take of Licence to Kill meant that gadget-laden supercars were out, and with Bond acting independently of MI6 he was not armed with much special weaponry. In fact there were not many cars used in the film, as trucks, boats and light planes were more heavily featured.\n\nThere were three cars featured briefly in the film: Sanchez used a Maserati Biturbo, Bond rented a 1989 Ford Thunderbird coupe when in Florida, and later he drove a two-tone blue Rolls Royce Silver Shadow while based in Isthmus City. Although Matchbox had castings of a T-Bird coupe and a Silver Shadow in the 1-75 range, for some reason these were not used.\n\nGIFT SET\n\nInstead of producing some original models as with A View to a Kill, Matchbox cobbled together a four-piece gift set using existing castings. The set included one model from the 1-75 range, two Sky-Buster aircraft, and an articulated truck from the Convoy series. Generally, there would be nothing wrong with doing this, as long as the models were reasonable facsimiles of the vehicles that appeared in the film. However, the problem was that none of them resembled the vehicles in the film, and were mostly covered in non-prototypical and inappropriate markings. As a result, this must rate as the worst set of James Bond models ever made… if not the worst character models of all time! I get the impression that Matchbox whipped this set up either at very short notice, or on a very tiny budget… probably both.\n\nHELICOPTER\n\nIn the pre-title scene, Bond, Leiter and Coast Guard agents are in a Eurocopter Dolphin chopper tailing Sanchez, who is escaping in a light plane. Bond lowers himself on the helicopter’s winch, and in mid-air he snares the fleeing plane’s tail, allowing the Coast Guards to haul Sanchez and his aircraft into custody.\n\nMatchbox used the SB-25 Rescue Helicopter from the Sky-Busters range to represent the chopper from the film. Despite having SB-20/2 US Coast Guard Helicopter in the same range, which had wheels like the Eurocopter Dolphin, Matchbox used a model which had skids. Although a totally generic model, if finished correctly, it could have passed as the movie chopper in a bad light. However, despite being painted in the correct Coast Guard colours of white, red and black, it was not given accurate markings; instead it had a large ‘007’ logo tampo-printed on each side…and it wasn’t even 007’s helicopter!\n\nCESSNA FLOAT PLANE There were three light planes used in Licence to Kill, and it is difficult to determine which one Matchbox has actually modelled! The first plane was Sanchez’s ‘captured’ plane, which was a wheeled Cessna in white with red trim. The second was one was a Cessna float plane used by drug smugglers to exchange large bundles of cocaine for cash with a luxury yacht on which Bond has stowed away. Bond climbs onto one of the plane’s floats, sneaks aboard in mid-air, and after dumping the smugglers into the ocean, takes charge of the plane and its cargo of cash. This plane was white with blue trim. The third plane was used in the climactic scenes of the film, at Sanchez’s desert stronghold and drug factory. Pam Bouvier manages to steal an ancient, wheeled crop-dusting plane, in which she and Bond manage to escape the compound. This plane is white with red and black trim, and has the registration number ‘XB-LOX’ painted clearly on the sides.\n\nAs mentioned, it’s difficult to work out what Matchbox was playing at with this plane model. The casting used was SB-26 Cessna 210 Float Plane, which would have been accurate if painted in the white and blue colours of the drug couriers’ plane, but instead the livery of the crop-dusting plane was used, which did not have floats and looked completely different. Matchbox got the ‘XB-LOX’ registration number right, but everything else wrong! To make matters worse, Bond’s name and logos were printed across the wings!\n\nKENWORTH TANKER\n\nIn order to make the smuggling operations undetectable, scientists in Sanchez’s organization had developed a method of suspending cocaine powder into gasoline. The idea was to transport the petrol/cocaine mix in a fleet of tanker trucks and ships to his allies around the globe, which they could separate using a secret chemical formula. After Bond destroyed Sanchez’s compound, he and his men escape in a fleet of vehicles including several Kenworth semi-trailers. Bond gets Pam to lower him from the light plane onto one of the tankers, which he then commandeers and attempts to force the other trucks off the road, resulting in most of them ending up in balls of flame.\n\nMatchbox’s model of the tanker is the only one in the set which isn’t totally laughable. Like the trucks in the film, it is a Kenworth with an articulated tanker trailer, and is correctly finished in white with black and gold stripes along the sides. The main fault is that it has an aerodynamic top on the sleeper compartment, which the real trucks did not. Other than that, it’s a reasonably competent model.\n\nPICK-UP After Bond had gained control of one of the tankers, he was pursued by a group of Sanchez’s thugs crammed into a big Dodge Ram pick-up which, like the tankers, was painted white with black and gold stripes. After Bond caused one of the tankers to explode on the roadway, the driver of the Ram continues though a wall of flame in pursuit of 007. Unfortunately for him, the Dodge’s underside catches fire, and when he later drives through a pool of fuel on the road, the pick-up bursts into flames and ends up careening over a cliff.\n\nThe Matchbox model of this pick-up is so incredibly inept that words almost fail me. Instead of a large American pick-up, the #58 Ruff Trek was used, which was based on a Holden Utility from the Australian outback. Matchbox didn’t even bother to modify the casting, and unlike the film truck it had a bull-bar on the front plus a stack of crates and spare wheels in the load bed. But to make things worse, the model was intended to represent the pick-up after it had caught fire, and as a result cheap-looking flames were tampo-printed on the bonnet and sides. It’s just indescribably bad, and totally wrong in so many ways.\n\nPACKAGING\n\nThis set was packaged in a large window box, with the models fitted in a blue vac-formed tray. The box featured a number of scenes from the film, including many of vehicles which bore little or no resemblance to the ones contained inside!\n\nI have to wonder how such a poorly-made product actually made it into the shops. The James Bond licensors are usually very strict in regard to the quality of products that they grant franchises to; so who actually authorized this set?\n\nWell, as it happened, Matchbox never did another James Bond model. Due to legal issues and script problems, there was a six-year gap before the next 007 film, Goldeneye. By this time Corgi had regained the licence and recommenced producing much more accurate and larger-scaled models based on Goldeneye and other Bond films. Johnny Lightning and Minichamps also obtained the rights to make 007 models, and managed to produce significantly better ones than those by Matchbox. Ertl produced a small range based on James Bond Jr, an animated TV series that kept the Bond franchise alive during the long gaps between feature films.\n\nIronically, the Licence to Kill set can be quite hard to find today, and is actually sought after by Bond collectors, often changing hands for as much as £50 for a mint and boxed set!\n\nThis article first appeared in the April 2014 issue of Diecast Collector Magazine.\n\nJames Bond TM and (C) Eon Productions.\n\nModel photos and text (C) Mike Pigott 2024.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated\n\nPublished by Mike Pigott's Diecast Toys and Models\n\nMike Pigott is a freelance writer who specializes in diecast model vehicles and pop culture.
