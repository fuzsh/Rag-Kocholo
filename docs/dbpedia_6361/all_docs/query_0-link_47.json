        "text": "As we all know there are certain trends and patterns that have reoccured throughtout the Bond franchise's 49 year history. One such example is an actor's 3rd film being their defining performance that firmly sets them both in the role and in their prime. Connery had Goldfinger, Moore had The Spy Who Loved Me and had Dalton done Goldeneye I believe there was a strong chance it would've been his best film. Not to mention the script for Craig's thrid film is supposidly fantastic. Brosnan and company ruined this ofcourse with TWINE but I still consider this to be an unofficial rule. Much like the previous stated \"3rd time is the charm\" rule there is another less mentioned one. That being each actor's second outing as Bond will either dissapoint critically, dissapoint finacially, do both, or simply not be up to par with the actor's debut film. It's almost as if the filmmakers are riding on such a high after they successfully debut a new Bond that they gey lazy when it comes to the next film. This has happened to every actor except Sean Connery. That's why I ommited FRWL from the list. I think we can all agree that it would win hands down.\n\nIn any event please rank your 4 Bond sopohmore outings from best to worst. Mine are as follows.\n\n1)Licence to Kill- This is the one and only second Bond film (again excluding FRWL) that I enjoyed more than the first out of the 4. Although I seem to be in the minority there as LTK was not as well recieved as Dalton's debut critically or financially. However the strength in LTK is that it plays to Dalton's strengths as an actor. Afterall TLD in certain sections still felt like they couldn't forget Roger Moore. Even though LTK has a smaller budget and looks cheap in areas it boasts a better script, better acting, and a much better villan than TLD.\n\n2)Quantum of Solace- I honestly don't understand all the hate this film gets on this site. Was it as good as CR? Not even close. Did it feel rushed? Yes. But truthfully what were the odds that it was gonna live up to CR with the writer's strike and an unexperienced director helming it? It's still one hell of an action movie that continues the excellent story-arc started in CR and a good performance by Daniel Craig. I'll take QOS over Brosnan's last 3 films anyday and honestly after rewatching Goldeneye again I'd rank them as about even. Atleast Craig is interesting as Bond.\n\n3)The Man With The Golden Gun- This just barely nudges out TND. This is just a bizarre Bond film. It seemed with the 70s starting with DAF onwards Bond was having an identity crisis and wouldn't solve that problem until TSWLM. TMWTGG has John Barry's weakest score, a strange sense of homur, pretty weak action, and an inconsistant performance by Moore. It seems like he established his persona in LALD, forgot about it, and then got it back for TSWLM. What saves this film is Christopher Lee as Scaramanga. Till this day he's one of my favorite Bond villans as he's Bond's equal mentally and physically rather than an old man in a chair pressing buttons. It's poor box office performance nearly killed the franchise. Similar to LTK, another sopohomore Bond film.\n\n4)Tommorrow Never Dies- This movie fails on almost all levels. It's got one of the worst Bond girls in Paris Carver, one of the worst Bond songs, a pitiful villian, a smarky performance by Brosnan, a rehashed plot, and Bond turning into Rambo at the end of the film. People say the same about Craig with QOS but Craig's Bond wasn't double-weilding a machine in one hand and his walther in the other taking out a small army on a submarine. And atleast Craig looks like he can kick someone's ass. Brosnan looks flat-out ridicuous as an action hero.\n\n\\"
