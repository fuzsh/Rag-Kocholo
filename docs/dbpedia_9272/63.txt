John Lee (born ca. 1972) is an American television writer, producer, director, voice actor, and musician. He is best known for his work on the MTV2 comedy series Wonder Showzen and as a member of the rock band/art collective PFFR.

Lee is long time friends with fellow PFFR member and television writer Vernon Chatman. They met as undergraduates at San Francisco State University.[1] Along with Chatman, Lee is the co-creator, writer, director and star of Wonder Showzen. He voices one of the main puppet characters Wordsworth (see main article List of Wonder Showzen characters) and provides various other voices on the show.[2] The pair also co-created Snoop Dogg's 2002 MTV sketch show Doggy Fizzle Televizzle. In addition, Lee is the co-creator of Xavier: Renegade Angel, also with Chatman and PFFR. He also worked as a creative consultant on the Adult Swim series Superjail! in 2009.

Lee was a member of the now defunct rock trio Muckafurgason. Although his primary role in the band was the bassist, the members of Muckafurgason were often known to "play musical chairs" with their instruments, seeing Lee occasionally turn his hand to lead vocals, guitar and even clarinet.[3] Through Muckafurgason he became acquainted with the band They Might Be Giants, who wrote the song John Lee Supertaster about him.
