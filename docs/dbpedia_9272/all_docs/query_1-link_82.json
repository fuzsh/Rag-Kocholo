        "text": "The co-creator of \"Wonder Showzen\" (MTV2, 2005-06), \"Xavier: Renegade Angel\" (Adult Swim, 2007-09) and \"The Heart, She Holler\" (Adult Swim, 2011-14), producer, writer and director John Lee has been responsible for some of the most unique comedy shows of the 21st century. Lee initially pursued a career in music, playing bass in the indie trio Muckaferguson, before joining his fellow San Francisco State University graduate Vernon Chatman and future wife Alyson Levy, as well as Jim Tozzi and Dina Waxman, to form the multimedia collective, PFFR, in 2001. After staging various art shows and releasing several electro-rock albums, the group achieved their first real taste of success when they moved into the world of TV comedy. Firstly, Chatman and Lee collaborated on Snoop Dogg's short-lived sketch show, \"Doggy Fizzle Televizzle\" (MTV, 2002-03), and then the pair co-created cult hit \"Wonder Showzen\" (MTV, 2005-06), a \"Sesame Street\" (PBS, 1969-) parody which wisely came with a disclaimer that it was too 'offensive, controversial and awesome for actual children.' But Lee and the rest of the PFFR team found their natural home when they moved networks for \"Xavier: Renegade Angel\" (Adult Swim, 2007-09), a surreal CGI fantasy series which further established their outlandish reputation, and then \"Delocated\" (Adult Swim, 2009-2013) a deadpan mockumentary starring Jon Glaser as a member of the Witness Protection Program who lands his own reality show. Lee then branched out on his own to direct episodes of pseudo-reality cookery show \"Food Party\" (IFC, 2009-10) and TV news spoof \"Jon Benjamin Has a Van\" (Comedy Central, 2011) before returning to the collective for \"The Heart, She Holler\" (Adult Swim, 2011-14), a typically offbeat Southern gothic drama starring Patton Oswalt. After helming a handful of episodes of hit sketch show \"Inside Amy Schumer\" (Comedy Central, 2013-) and cult sitcom \"Broad City\" (Comedy Central, 2014-), Lee took the director's chair once again for the long-awaited revival of Paul Reubens' legendary comic character, \"Pee-wee's Big Holiday\" (Netflix, 2016)."
