        "text": "Introduction\n\nEndovascular treatment (EVT) for iliofemoral artery lesions has become common in the last decade due to technical developments related to self-expandable nitinol stents, and EVT is now an alternative first-line treatment with long-term outcomes that are not inferior to those after surgery.1,2 The high procedural success rate and reduced invasiveness has encouraged extension of indications for endovascular revascularization, but with little focus on hemodynamic significance. The current guidelines for peripheral artery disease indicate that EVT should be used with optimal drug treatment and supervised exercise therapy when clinical findings suggest a reasonable likelihood of symptomatic improvement. These guidelines also recommend pressure measurements across lesions at rest and under induced hyperemia in cases in which the hemodynamic significance of the target lesion is unclear.3,4 Various parameters have been proposed to determine hemodynamic significance, including mean pressure gradient (MPG), peak-to-peak PG, and ratio of mean pressure (also referred to as the peripheral fractional flow reserve [pFFR]) with or without vasodilators.5–9 However, the validity of these parameters for treatment planning is unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to verify whether trans-stenotic absolute PG and pFFR measured using a 0.014-inch pressure wire under hyperemia can be used to establish hemodynamic significance in iliofemoral angiographically intermediate stenosis.\n\nResults\n\nThe characteristics of the patients are shown in and the characteristics of lesions are shown in . The patients had a mean age of 72.2±6.8 years (range: 61–86 years) and 19 were male. Almost half of the patients had coronary artery disease (CAD) and three were receiving hemodialysis. All patients had intermittent claudication, except for four with critical limb ischemia. The mean % stenosis diameter was 57.3%±13.2%, and 91% of the lesions were classified as TASC II A.\n\nTable 1\n\nMean ± SD or Number (%)Age, years72.2±6.8Sex, male19 (86)Left lower extremity14 (64)Hypertension19 (86)Dyslipidemia13 (59)Diabetes mellitus14 (64)Current smoking6 (27)Previously smoked12 (55)Coronary artery disease13 (59)Ejection fraction (%)59±13Cerebrovascular disease6 (27)Hemodialysis3 (14)Rutherford classification 01 (5) 11 (5) 26 (27) 311 (50) 43 (14) 51 (5) 60\n\nTable 2\n\nMean ± SD or Number (%)Minimum lesion length (mm)2.1±1.3Reference vessel diameter (mm)5.2±2.9Diameter stenosis (%)57.3±13.2Lesion length (mm)32.0±19.0Lesion location Iliac8 (35) Femoropopliteal15 (65)Restenosis8 (35)Below the knee runoff 0/30 1/36 (26) 2/37 (10) 3/310 (43)TASC II classification A21 (91) B2 (9)\n\nMPG increased significantly after injection of ISDN (from 9.0±5.7 to 16.3±6.2 mmHg; P<0.05, ). Baseline MPG was not significantly correlated with PSVR (R=0.33; P=0.12); however, hyperemic MPG was significantly correlated with PSVR (R=0.52; P<0.05, ).\n\nMPR decreased significantly after injection of ISDN (from 0.92±0.06 to 0.81±0.07; P<0.05, ). Baseline MPR was not significantly correlated with PSVR (R=−0.32; P=0.16); however, hyperemic MPR (pFFR) was significantly correlated with PSVR (R=−0.50; P<0.05, ).\n\nThe optimal cut-off value for pFFR for hemodynamically significant stenosis (defined as PSVR >2.5) was 0.85 (area under the curve [AUC] 0.72; sensitivity 94%; specificity 50%, P<0.05, ). Hyperemic MPG was not a significant predictor of hemodynamically significant stenosis (AUC 0.48; sensitivity 71%; specificity: 87%, P=0.95).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe major findings in this study of iliofemoral angiographically intermediate stenosis were that hemodynamic significance can be established more accurately under hyperemia induced by ISDN, compared to a resting state; that hyperemic MPG and hyperemic MPR (pFFR) are both significantly correlated with PSVR on DUS; and that the optimal cut-off value for pFFR as an indicator of hemodynamic significance (PSVR >2.5) was 0.85.\n\nIn CAD, common physiological findings are included in planning a revascularization strategy for non-severe stenosis. We routinely employ stress tests for coronary blood flow through exercise or pharmacologic stimulation, and coronary pressure measurements are commonly used for assessment of the ischemic potential of a stenosis in our daily practice. Recent large clinical trials have established fractional flow reserve (FFR) measured using a pressure wire as a standard diagnostic tool in patients with non-severe stenosis.10,11 In peripheral artery disease, hyperemic translesional MPG and renal FFR are important as physiological parameters in endovascular revascularization for renal artery stenosis (RAS). Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend pressure measurements for understanding the functional significance in RAS.12,13\n\nUnlike in CAD or RAS, pressure measurements are not commonly used for iliofemoral disease with intermediate stenosis although there might be high frequencies of visual-functional mismatch between moderate morphologic stenosis (>50% in angiography) and pressure ratio.14 A residual MPG <10 mmHg after intervention has been suggested as an indicator of hemodynamic significance in iliac arteries.4 However, this criterion is based on findings obtained using 5 Fr catheters, and large diameter catheters always overestimate the PG compared with a pressure wire.5 In addition, there are no data on the clinical value of using vasodilators and pFFR measurements for iliofemoral disease with intermediate stenosis. In contrast, DUS is frequently used for planning of iliofemoral artery revascularization (both endovascular and surgical) in daily practice. The quality of this examination depends on the experience of sonographers and data interpretation can be time-consuming; but the method is noninvasive, and provides information on lesion locations and stenosis in two dimensions, and on hemodynamic severity based on PSVR.15,16\n\nThe results of the current study revealed the importance of inducing a hyperemic state in evaluation of iliofemoral artery circulation. The findings support our hypothesis that pressure measurements for iliofemoral angiographic mild to moderate stenosis can be used in place of DUS to evaluate hemodynamic significance. Thus, measurement of hyperemic MPG and pFFR using a pressure wire can be used to assess the hemodynamic severity of a lesion (which was not evaluated in DUS before EVT) in a catheter laboratory and to perform intervention with the pressure wire across the lesion based on pFFR reaching the threshold described above. We note that modern pressure wires have improved durability and torque, and thus EVT using a pressure wire is not stressful for operators, except for treating complex lesions such as those in the TASC II C/D class. Hyperemic MPG also had a significant correlation with PSVR on DUS, but we were unable to establish a threshold MPG as an indicator of hemodynamic significance in the current study. This parameter is an absolute value that depends strongly on blood pressure. Therefore, there is likely to be a wide range of hyperemic MPG values in iliofemoral arteries that may or may not reflect hemodynamic significance ( ). Thus, we conclude that hyperemic MPR (pFFR) is a better measure of hemodynamic significance."
