The show was produced by PFFFR (PFFR) and I have contact with them. PFFR told me that a reboot of the show is not in their control, that it's up for Adult Swim to decide that.\n\nSince we know that the only way to get the show back is to start a petition and get Adult Swims attention to at least think about rebooting the show we are going to do so. Adult Swim released a Xavier Class of 2020 Commencement Speech. Where Xavier is the one making the announcement. This sparked a thought in my head that there was a possibility for Adult Swim and PFFR to start a Mini-Series of the show. I contacted PFFR and found out the animation for the Commencement Speech took a month to make which isn't that long so there is a high possibility of a Xavier Mini-Series.\n\nThis show means a lot to people and some are bummed out that the show is only 20 episodes long. I think that if there is a high demand for the show that Adult Swim may consider a reboot or perhaps a Mini-Series for the show. We can't let this special show get left in the dust so please sign the petition, your signature matters. Your signature can be one step closer to making a change!"
