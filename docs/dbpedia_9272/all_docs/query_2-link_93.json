        "text": "Williams Street Productions, LLC, d/b/a Williams Street and formerly known as Ghost Planet Industries, is an American animation and live action television production studio owned by the Warner Bros. Television Studios division of Warner Bros., a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery. The studio is the in-house production arm of Adult Swim (The programming block on Cartoon Network). The main priority is production of original series which air on Cartoon Network's late night Adult Swim block of adult-oriented programming. They also produce DVDs and soundtracks for their series, unrelated music from selected artists, interactive video and web games.\n\nHistory[]\n\nWilliams Street was originally a cock constructed in the early 1900s. No information exists for what the building was used for up until the 70s, rumors state it was once a condom factory. In 1976, Ted Turner bought the building and used it for his own television station WTCG. This new channel was was the result of a recent UHF takeover. In December 1976, the first WTCG signal was beamed via satellite to its four cable systems located around Georgia. This broadcast was the first use of non-pay-service satellite transmission, an innovation that would come to revolutionize basic cable nationwide.\n\nStarting out as a minor local channel, the station grew into success and was re-launched as WTBS in 1979. Then after a 5 year period, WTBS was renamed TBS Superstation. During this time, Turner also created CNN, a 24-hour news network. Both became standard for cable providers by the late 80s. Due to this success, the studio building became too small to operate as a headquarters. A new campus was built across the street for the expanding Turner empire. Upon completion, Turner launched Cartoon Network to showcase their recent acquisitions of the vast MGM and Hanna-Barbera library of cartoons.\n\nWhen Turner moved out of the Williams Street building, they kept ownership, using it as a storage facility. Although no longer it's main purpose, to this day Williams Street houses all the show tapes for Turner Networks. Appointed to run the building were veteran turner employees such as Keith Crofford, Andy Merril and former mail-room employee Mike Lazzo. Although Cartoon Network was run at Hannah-Barbera Studios at the time, certain duties were eventually controlled by the trio at Williams Street. One of their most important early tasks were producing host segments for The Moxy Pirate Show (Later The Moxy Show).\n\nFrom 1990 to 1993, TBS had started it's own original programming such as Captain Planet and 2 Stupid Dogs. This interested the team at Williams Street and they all wished to create their own series. Towards the end of '93, the three mustered up courage to approach Ted Turner with their ideas for Cartoon Network original programming. It didn't go as planned and were eventually kicked out of Ted's office. According to Lazzo, they were clearly told that unless CN started making more money for Turner, they wouldn't be allowed funding or a chance. They didn't listen.\n\nThey decided to produce their own series pilot. On a shoe-string budget, they tried to come up with compatible ideas. During brain storming, they realized they could simply re-use footage of any animation in the turner library. They eventually settled on Space Ghost and Dino Boy. Because they felt it would fit, they paired it with Mike Lazzo's idea of a Satirical talk show with a clueless host asking guests a stream of stupid questions. The final pilot featured rotoscoped animation super-imposed on a simple background and used CNN interview footage for the live-action interview.\n\nThey went back to Turner and presented the pilot with the series was then greenlit for a 10 episode season. Work began and the minor CN production/storage facility became it's own studio, named after Coast to Coast's own in-show one: Ghost Planet Industries. Soon the series was acquiring it's first C and D-list celebrity guests, small animation and writing crew and voice actors. The voice actor for Space Ghost was local voice actor George Lowe, all other roles were done by the GPI crew. The series eventually premiered in April 14th, 1994. This marked Cartoon Network's first original series and the first animated talk-show in history.\n\nDue to it's more mature surreal humor, the series attracted a devoted cult audience. It's success led to a special which was simulcast on TBS, a special short for VHS release of blockbuster The Mask and much more famous guests. In the height of popularity, it was awarded it's own spin-off. Turner commissioned GPI to produce some sort of lighter version for TBS, due to a need for children's programming. Cartoon Planet premiered on TBS in 1995 and later moved to Cartoon Network in 1996. The series featured Space Ghost hosting segments and cartoons for young viewers. After 2 seasons, TBS decided to cancel all kids programming, following the trend of TNT and United States.\n\nHeadquarters[]\n\nThe name originates from the location of the studios (Which double as the home office for Adult Swim) on Williams Street in Atlanta, Georgia, in proximity to the current offices of Ted Turner-founded WTBS, CNN and the Cartoon Network itself.\n\nDivisions[]\n\nThe building seen in their logo is the original concept of the animated Ghost Planet Industries building, which was later rendered in 3D for Space Ghost Coast to Coast and Toonami's introductions. The real-life studio looks much different, as it has an old TBS logo on the front and is much longer and more elevated in the middle. The studio, on Williams Street in midtown Atlanta, is directly across the Downtown Connector from TBS's corporate headquarters.\n\nAfter showing up to 5 seconds of the Williams Street logo, it cuts to a barely visible skull and crossbones design with the 1992-2004 Cartoon Network logo as the teeth. This did not occur during the Ghost Planet Industries era, as it was followed by a less subliminal Cartoon Network logo.\n\nOriginal Series[]\n\nIn-House[]\n\nSamurai Jack (2001-2004, 2017)\n\nCartoon Planet (1995-1998, 2012-2014)\n\nAqua Teen Hunger Force (2000-2015)\n\nThe Brak Show (2000-2007)\n\nJJ Villard's Fairy Tales (2020)\n\nSquidbillies (2005-2021)\n\nCollaborations[]\n\nSealab 2021 (With 70/30 Productions) (2000-2005)\n\nHarvey Birdman, Attorney at Law (With Turner Studios) (2000-2007)\n\nThe Venture Bros.
