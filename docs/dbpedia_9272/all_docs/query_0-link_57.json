For both these shows, Chatman and Lee are the directors and main voice talent, whilst Tozzi and Levy are the animation/character designer and art director, respectively. Levy provides additional voices for both shows whilst Tozzi does only for 'Xavier'. Chatman and Lee also collaborated on Doggy Fizzle Televizzle, a short lived sketch show starring rapper Snoop Dogg who made a guest appearance on PFFR's 'United We Doth' LP.\n\nIn interviews, the group have proven to be whimsical and flippant, often going off at random, nonsensical tangents to their own amusement. When asked about their inception and existence, the answer is often the same: \"A shimmering gem crashed down from the heavens, black clouds exploded unto the Earth and PFFR was formed.\" The story's finer details are known to vary, but the basic premise is kept. In an interview given by Chatman and Lee for The Sound Of Young America radio show, host Jesse Thorn asks the duo about the beliefs behind Wonder Showzen, to which they partly reply \"We believe in the power of a mythical gem that emenated from a dark cloud in the sky. 'God' queefed her light through it, and the refraction formed a dragon, a cougar and a sea beast. They together shat out a script and we printed it up and shot it.\"\n\nThe bands old [http://www.birdmanrecords.com/pffr.html website] was equally outlandish, consisting of streams of garish, neon colours, a news column with such nonsense articles as \"Goblins of Gob World Tour conceived. PFFR hospitalized after first grog. Hospital still under construction\" and a 'cute' chipmunk that, when clicked, grows an enormous erect penis that ejaculates to display the sites menu options.\n\nBefore Wonder Showzen, PFFR were also known rarely to reveal their personal identities, and would often state that they were a \"group of highly motivated young people (aged 13, 15 and older) that formed a band in order to start a riot in the local public library.\" These nonsense claims and back story appropriately represent their bizarre music and art.\n\nDina Waxman from the alternative/indie rock band [http://www.spacemtn.com Space MTN] is known to be a founding member of PFFR.\n\nIndividual achievements\n\n*Chatman provides the voice for South Park character 'Towelie' and worked as a staff writer/consultant on the show in 2004 (He also appears on the credits of recent episodes as a producer). He has written for Matt Stone and Trey Parker's short lived sitcom 'That's My Bush', 'Late Night with Conan O'Brien' and 'The Chris Rock Show'.\n\n*Levy directed the documentary film \" [http://www.superdeluxe.com/sd/artist/alyson_levy The Hands Of God] \" about Christian puppeteers. She had a photography exhibition at Momenta Art, Brooklyn, in 2000 which featured a selection of photographs depicting various spoof sitcom scenes starring herself and friend Janeane Garofalo. She is also married to Lee.\n\n*Tozzi is an artist and a member of the production companies [http://www.kandokid.tv KanDoKid] and T.H.E.M.. He has directed a plethora of television commercials.\n\n*Lee was previously a member of the now defunct rock band Muckafurgason. He is known as a supertaster through the song \"John Lee Supertaster\" by the alternative rock band They Might Be Giants, with whom he is close friends.\n\nExternal links"
