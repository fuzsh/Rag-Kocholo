        "text": "Author Response\n\nThis important work presents a new methodology for the statistical analysis of fiber photometry data, improving statistical power while avoiding the bias inherent in the choices that are necessarily made when summarizing photometry data. The reanalysis of two recent photometry data sets, the simulations, and the mathematical detail provide convincing evidence for the utility of the method and the main conclusions, however, the discussion of the re-analyzed data is incomplete and would be improved by a deeper consideration of the limitations of the original data. In addition, consideration of other data sets and photometry methodologies including non-linear analysis tools, as well as a discussion of the importance of the data normalization are needed.\n\nThank you for the thorough and positive review of our work! We will incorporate this feedback to strengthen the manuscript. Specifically, we plan to revise the Discussion section to include a deeper consideration of the limitations of the original data, a description of the capacities of our method for conducting non-linear analyses, and the role data normalization plays in applicability of our tool.\n\nReviewer 1:\n\nStrengths:\n\nThe framework the authors present is solid and well-explained. By reanalyzing formerly published data, the authors also further increase the significance of the proposed tool opening new avenues for reinterpreting already collected data.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nHowever, this also leads to several questions. The normalization method employed for raw fiber photometry data is different from lab to lab. This imposes a significant challenge to applying a single tool of analysis.\n\nThank you for the positive feedback, we will address your comments in our revision. We agree that any data pre-processing steps will have down-stream consequences on the statistical inference from our method. Note, though, that this would also be the case with standard analysis approaches (e.g., t-tests, correlations) applied to summary measures like AUCs. For that reason, we do not believe that variability in pre-processing is an impediment to widespread adoption of a standard analysis procedure. Rather, we argue that the sensitivity of analysis results to pre-processing choices underscores the need for establishing statistical techniques that reduce the need for pre-processing, and properly account for structure in the data arising from experimental designs. The reviewer brings up an excellent point that we can further elaborate on how our methods actually reduce the need for such pre-processing steps. Indeed, our method provides smooth estimation results along the functional domain (i.e., across trial timepoints), has the ability to adjust for between-trial and -animal heterogeneity, and provides a valid statistical inference framework that quantifies the resulting uncertainty. For example, adjustment for session-to-session variability in signal magnitudes or dynamics could be accounted for, at least in part, through the inclusion of session-level random effects. This heterogeneity would then influence the width of the confidence intervals. This stands in contrast to “sweeping it under the rug” with a pre-processing step that may have an unknown impact on the final statistical inferences. Similarly, the level of smoothing is at least in part selected as a function of the data, and again is accounted for directly in the equations used to construct confidence intervals. In sum, our method provides both a tool to account for challenges in the data, and a systematic framework to quantify the additional uncertainty that accompanies accounting for those data characteristics.\n\nDoes the method that the authors propose work similarly efficiently whether the data are normalized in a running average dF/F as it is described in the cited papers? For example, trace smoothing using running averages (Jeong et al. 2022) in itself may lead to pattern dilution. The same question applies if the z-score is calculated based on various responses or even baselines.\n\nThis is an important question given how common this practice is in the field. Briefly, application of pre-processing steps will change the interpretation of the results from our analysis method. For example, if one subtracts off a pre-trial baseline average from each trial timepoint, then the “definition of 0”, and the interpretation of coefficients and their statistical significance, changes. Similarly, if one scales the signal (e.g., divides the signal magnitude by a trial- or animal-specific baseline), then this changes the interpretation of the FLMM regression coefficients to be in terms of an animal-specific signal unit as opposed to a raw dF/F. This is, however, not specific to our technique, and pre-processing would have a similar influence on, for example, linear regression (and thus t-tests, ANOVAs and Pearson correlations) applied to summary measures. We agree with the reviewer that explicitly discussing this point will strengthen the paper.\n\nWhile it is difficult to make general claims about the anticipated performance of the method under all the potential pre-processing steps taken in the field, we believe that most common pre-processing strategies will not negatively influence the method’s performance or validity; they would, instead, change the interpretation of the results. We are releasing a series of vignettes to guide analysts through using our method and, to address your comment, we will add a section on interpretation after pre-processing.\n\nHow reliable the method is if the data are non-stationary and the baselines undergo major changes between separate trials?\n\nThis is an excellent question. We believe the statistical inferences will be valid and will properly quantify the uncertainty from non-stationarities, since our framework does not impose stationarity assumptions on the underlying process. It is worth mentioning that non-stationarity and high trial-to-trial variability may increase variance estimates if the model does not include a rich enough set of covariates to capture the source of the heterogeneity across trial baselines. However, this is a feature of our framework, rather than a bug, as it properly conveys to the analyst that high unaccounted for variability in the signal may result in high model uncertainty. Finally, mixed effects modeling provides a transparent, statistically reasonable, and flexible approach to account for between-session, and between-trial variability, a type of non-stationarity. We agree with the reviewer that this should be more explicitly discussed in the paper, and will do so.\n\nFinally, what is the rationale for not using non-linear analysis methods? Following the paper's logic, non-linear analysis can capture more information that is diluted by linear methods.\n\nFunctional data analysis assumes that the function varies smoothly along the functional domain (i.e., across trial timepoints). It is a type of non-linear modeling technique over the functional domain since we do not assume a linear model (straight line). Therefore, our functional data analysis approach is able to capture more information that is diluted by linear models. While the basic form of our model assumes a linear change in the signal at a fixed trial timepoint, across trials/sessions, our package allows one to easily model changes with non-linear functions of covariates using splines or other basis functions. One must consider, however, the tradeoff between flexibility and interpretability when specifying potentially complex models.\n\nReviewer 2\n\nStrengths:\n\nThe open-source package in R using a similar syntax as the lme4 package for the implementation of this framework on photometry data enhances the accessibility, and usage by other researchers. Moreover, the decreased fitting time of the model in comparison with a similar package on simulated data, has the potential to be more easily adopted.\n\nThe reanalysis of two studies using summary statistics on photometry data (Jeong et al., 2022; Coddington et al., 2023) highlights how trial-by-trial analysis at each time-point on the trial can reveal information obscured by averaging across trials. Furthermore, this work also exemplifies how session and subject variability can lead to opposite conclusions when not considered.\n\nThank you for the positive assessment of our work!\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nAlthough this work has reanalyzed previous work that used summary statistics, it does not compare with other studies that use trial-by-trial photometry data across time-points in a trial.\n\nAs described by the authors, fitting pointwise linear mixed models and performing t-test and Benjamini-Hochberg correction as performed in Lee et al. (2019) has some caveats. Using joint confidence intervals has the potential to improve statistical robustness, however, this is not directly shown with temporal data in this work. Furthermore, it is unclear how FLMM differs from the pointwise linear mixed modeling used in this work.\n\nWe agree with the reviewers that providing more detail about the drawbacks of the approach applied in Lee et al., 2019 will strengthen the paper. We will add an example analysis applying the method proposed by Lee et al., 2019 to show how the set of timepoints at which coefficient estimates reach statistical significance can vary dramatically depending on the sampling rate one subsamples their data at, a highly undesirable property of this strategy. Our approach is robust to this, and still provides a multiple comparisons correction through the joint confidence intervals.\n\nIn this work, FLMM usages included only one or two covariates. However, in complex behavioral experiments, where variables are correlated, more than two may be needed (see Simpson et al. (2023), Engelhard et al. (2019); Blanco-Pozo et al. (2024)). It is not clear from this work, how feasible computationally would be to fit such complex models, which would also include more complex random effects.\n\nThis is a good point. In our experience, the code is still quite fast (often taking seconds to tens of seconds in our experience) on a standard laptop when fitting complex models that include, for example, 10 covariates, or complex random effect specifications on dataset sizes common in fiber photometry. In the manuscript, we included results from simpler models with few covariates in an attempt to show results from the FLMM versions of the standard analyses (e.g., correlations, t-tests) applied in Jeong et al., 2022. Our goal was to show that our method reveals effects obscured by standard analyses even in simple cases. Some of our models did, however, include complex nested random effects (e.g., the models described in Section 4.5.2).\n\nLike other mixed-model based analyses, our method becomes slower when the number of observations in the dataset is on the order of tens of thousands of observations. However, we coded the methods to be memory efficient so that even these larger analyses can be run on standard laptops. We thank the reviewer for this point, as we worked extremely hard to scale the method to be able to efficiently fit models commonly applied in neuroscience. Indeed, challenges with scalability were one of the main motivations for applying the estimation procedure that we did; in the appendix we show that the fit time of our approach is much faster than existing FLMM software such as the refund package function pffr(), especially for large sample sizes. While pffr() appears to scale exponentially with the number of clusters (e.g., animals), our method appears to scale linearly. We will more explicitly emphasize the scalability in the revision, since we agree this will strengthen the final manuscript.\n\nReviewer #3\n\nStrengths:\n\nThe statistical framework described provides a powerful way to analyze photometry data and potentially other similar signals. The provided package makes this methodology easy to implement and the extensively worked examples of reanalysis provide a useful guide to others on how to correctly specify models.\n\nModeling the entire trial (function regression) removes the need to choose appropriate summary statistics, removing the opportunity to introduce bias, for example in searching for optimal windows in which to calculate the AUC. This is demonstrated in the re-analysis of Jeong et al., 2022, in which the AUC measures presented masked important details about how the photometry signal was changing.\n\nMeanwhile, using linear mixed methods allows for the estimation of random effects, which are an important consideration given the repeated-measures design of most photometry studies.\n\nThank you for the positive assessment of our work!\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nWhile the availability of the software package (fastFMM), the provided code, and worked examples used in the paper are undoubtedly helpful to those wanting to use these methods, some concepts could be explained more thoroughly for a general neuroscience audience.\n\nWe appreciate this and, to address your and other reviewers’ comments, we are creating a series of vignettes walking users through how to analyze photometry data with our package. We will include algebraic illustrations to help users gain familiarity with the regression modeling here.\n\nWhile the methodology is sound and the discussion of its benefits is good, the interpretation and discussion of the re-analyzed results are poor:\n\nIn section 2.3, the authors use FLMM to identify an instance of Simpson's Paradox in the analysis of Jeong et al. (2022). While this phenomenon is evident in the original authors' metrics (replotted in Figure 5A), FLMM provides a convenient method to identify these effects while illustrating the deficiencies of the original authors' approach of concatenating a different number of sessions for each animal and ignoring potential within-session effects. The discussion of this result is muddled. Having identified the paradox, there is some appropriate speculation as to what is causing these opposing effects, particularly the decrease in sessions. In the discussion and appendices, the authors identify (1) changes in satiation/habitation/motivation, (2) the predictability of the rewards (presumably by the click of a solenoid valve) and (3) photobleaching as potential explanations of the decrease within days. Having identified these effects, but without strong evidence to rule all three out, the discussion of whether RPE or ANCCR matches these results is probably moot. In particular, the hypotheses developed by Jeong et al., were for a random (unpredictable) rewards experiment, whereas the evidence points to the rewards being sometimes predictable. The learning of that predictability (e.g. over sessions) and variation in predictability (e.g. by attention level to sounds of each mouse) significantly complicate the analysis. The FLMM analysis reveals the complexity of analyzing what is apparently a straightforward task design.\n\nWhile we are disappointed to hear the reviewer felt our initial interpretations and discussion were poor, the reviewer brings up an excellent point that we had not considered. They have convinced us that acknowledging and elaborating on this alternative perspective will strengthen the paper. We agree that the ANCCR/RPE model predictions were made for unpredictable rewards and, as the reviewer rightly points out, there is evidence that the animals sense the reward delivery. Regardless of the learning theory one adopts (RPE, ANCCR or others), we agree that this (potentially) learned predictability alone could account for the increase in signal magnitude across sessions.\n\nAfter reading the reviewer’s comments, we consulted with a number of researchers in this area, and several felt that a CS+ can serve as a reward, within itself. From this perspective, the rewards in the Jeong et al., 2022 experiment might still be considered unexpected. After discussing extensively with the authors of Jeong et al., 2022, it is clear that they went to enormous trouble to prevent the inadvertent generation of a CS+, and it is likely changes in pressure from the solenoid (rather than a sound) that served as a cue. This underscores the difficulty of preventing perception of reward delivery in practice. As this paper is focused on analysis approaches, we feel that we can contribute most thoughtfully to the dopamine–learning theory conversation by presenting both sides.\n\nOverall, we agree with the reviewer that future experiments will be needed for testing the accuracy of the models’ predictions for random (unpredicted) rewards. While we understand that our attempt to document our conversations with the Jeong et al., 2022 authors may have room for improvement, we hope the reviewer can appreciate that this was done with the best of intentions. We wish to emphasize that we also consulted with several other researchers in the field when crafting the discussion. The Jeong et al., 2022 authors could easily have avoided acknowledging the potential incompleteness of their theory, by claiming that our results do not invalidate their predictions for a random reward, as the reward was not unpredicted in the experiment (as a result of the inadvertent solenoid CS+). Instead, they went out of their way to emphasize that their experiment did test a random reward, and that our results do present problems for their theory. We think that engagement with re-analyses of one’s data, even when findings are inconvenient, is a good demonstration of open science practice. For that reason as well, we feel providing readers with a perspective on the entire discussion will contribute to the scientific discourse in this area.\n\nFinally, we would like to reiterate that this conversation is happening because our method, by analyzing the signal at every trial timepoint, revealed a neural signal that appears to indicate that the animals sense reward delivery. Ultimately, this was what we set out to do: help researchers ask questions of their data that they could not ask before. We believe that having a demonstration that we can indeed do this for a “live” issue is the most appropriate way of demonstrating the usefulness of the method.\n\nIt is clear the reviewer put a lot of time into understanding what we did, and was very thoughtful about the feedback. We would like to thank the reviewer again for taking such care in reviewing our paper.\n\nIf this paper is not trying to arbitrate between RPE and ANCCR, as stated in the text, the post hoc reasoning of the authors of Jeong et al 2022 provided in the discussion is not germane.\n\nWhile we appreciate that the post hoc reasoning of the authors of Jeong et al., 2022 may not seem germane, we would like to provide some context for its inclusion. As statisticians and computer scientists, our role is to create methods, and this often requires using open source data and recreating past analyses. This usually involves extensive conversation with authors about their data and analysis choices because, if we cannot reproduce their findings using their analysis methods, we cannot verify that results from our own methods are valid. As such, we prefer to conduct method development in a collaborative fashion, and we strive to constructively, and respectfully, discuss our results with the original authors. We feel that giving them the opportunity to suggest analyses, and express their point of view if our results conflict with their original conclusions, is important, and we do not want to discourage authors from making their datasets public. As such, we conducted numerous analyses at the suggestion of Jeong et al., 2022 and discussed the results over the course of many months. Indeed the analyses in the Appendix that the reviewer is referring to were conducted at the suggestion of the authors of Jeong et al., 2022, in an attempt to rule out alternative explanations. We nevertheless appreciate that our interpretations of these results can include some of the caveats suggested by the reviewer, and we will strive to improve these sections.\n\nArbitrating between the models likely requires new experimental designs (removing the sound of the solenoid, satiety controls) or more complex models (e.g. with session effects, measures of predictability) that address the identified issues.\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that the results suggest that new experimental designs will likely be necessary to adjudicate between models. It is our hope that, by weighing the different issues and interpretations, our paper might provide useful suggestions into what experimental designs would be most beneficial to rule out competing hypotheses in future data collection efforts. We believe that our methodology will strengthen our capacity to design new experiments and analyses. We will make the reviewer’s suggestions more explicit in the discussion by emphasizing the limitations of the original data.\n\nOf the three potential causes of within-session decreases, the photobleaching arguments advanced in the discussion and expanded greatly in the appendices are not convincing. The data being modeled is a processed signal (ΔF/F) with smoothing and baseline correction and this does not seem to have been considered in the argument.\n\nWe are disappointed to hear that this extensive set of analyses, much of which was conducted at the suggestion of Jeong et al., 2022, was not convincing. We agree that acknowledging any pre-processing would provide useful context for the reader. We do wish to clarify that we analyzed the data that were made available online (raw data was not available). Moreover, for comparison with the authors’ results, we felt it was important to maintain the same pre-processing steps as they did. These conditions were held constant across analysis approaches; therefore, we think that the changes within-trial are likely not influenced substantially by these pre-processing choices. While we cannot speak definitively to the impact any of the processing conducted by the authors had on the results, we believe that it was likely minor, given that the timing of signals at other points in the trial, and in other experiments, were as expected (e.g., the signal rose rapidly after cue onset in Pavlovian tasks).\n\nFurthermore, the photometry readout is also a convolution of the actual concentration changes over time, influenced by the on-off kinetics of the sensor, which makes the interpretation of timing effects of photobleaching less obvious than presented here and more complex than the dyes considered in the cited reference used as a foundation for this line of reasoning.\n\nWe appreciate the nuance of this point, and we will add it to our discussion. In response to your criticism, we have consulted with more experts in the field regarding the potential for bleaching in this data, and it is not clear to us why photobleaching would be visible in one time-window of a trial, but not at another (less than a second away), despite high dF/F magnitudes in both time-windows. We do wish to point out that, at the request of the authors, we analyzed many experiments from the same animals and in most cases did not observe other indications of photobleaching. Hence, it is not clear to us why this particular set of experiments would garner additional skepticism regarding the potential for photobleaching to invalidate results. While the role of photobleaching may be more complicated with this sensor than others in the references, that citation was included, at the suggestion of Jeong et al., 2022 simply as a way of acknowledging that non-linearities in photobleaching can occur.\n\nWithin this discussion of photobleaching, the characterization of the background reward experiments used in part to consider photobleaching (appendix 7.3.2) is incorrect. In this experiment (Jeong et al., 2022), background rewards were only delivered in the inter-trial-interval (i.e. not between the CS+ and predicted reward as stated in the text). Both in the authors' description and in the data, there is a 6s before cue onset where rewards are not delivered and while not described in the text, the data suggests there is a period after a predicted reward when background rewards are not delivered. This complicates the comparison of this data to the random reward experiment.\n\nThank you for pointing this out!! We will remove the parenthetical on page 18 of the appendix that incorrectly stated that rewards can occur between the CS+ and the predicted reward.\n\nThe discussion of the lack of evidence for backpropagation, taken as evidence for ANCCR over RPE, is also weak.\n\nThis point was meant to acknowledge that, although our method yields results that conflict with the conclusions described by Jeong et al., 2022 on data from some experiments, on other experiments our method supports their results. Again, we believe that a critical part of open science is acknowledging both areas where analyses support and conflict with those of the original authors. We agree with the reviewer that qualifying our results so as not to emphasize support for/against RPE/ANCCR will strengthen our paper, and we will make these changes.\n\nA more useful exercise than comparing FLMM to the methods and data of Jeong et al., 2022, would be to compare against the approach of Amo et al., 2022, which identifies backpropagation (data publicly available: DOI: 10.5061/dryad.hhmgqnkjw). The replication of a positive result would be more convincing of the sensitivity of the methodology than the replication of a negative result, which could be a result of many factors in the experimental design. Given that the Amo et al. analysis relies on identifying systematic changes in the timing of a signal over time, this would be particularly useful in understanding if the smoothing steps in FLMM obscure such changes.\n\nThank you for this suggestion, and we agree this could be a useful analysis for the field. Your thoughtful review has convinced us that focusing on our statistical contribution will strengthen the paper, and we will make changes to further emphasize that we are not seeking to adjudicate between RPE/ANCCR. We only had space in the manuscript to include a subset of the analyses conducted on Jeong et al., 2022, and had to relegate the results from the Coddington et al., data to an appendix. Realistically, it would be hard for us to justify analyzing a third dataset. As you may surmise from the one we presented, reanalyzing a new dataset is usually very time consuming, and invariably requires extensive communication with the original authors. We did include numerous examples in our manuscript where we already replicated positive results, in a way that we believe demonstrates the sensitivity of the methodology. We have also been working with five groups at NIH and elsewhere using our approach, in experiments targeting different scientific questions. In fact, one paper that extensively applies our method and compares the results from those yielded by standard analysis of AUCs is already accepted and in press. Hence there should soon be additional demonstrations of what the method can do in less controversial settings. Finally, our forthcoming vignettes include additional analyses, not included in the manuscript, that replicate positive results. We take your point that our description of the data supporting one theory or the other should be qualified, and we will correct that. Again, your review was very thorough, and we appreciate your taking so much time to help us improve our work.\n\nReviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):\n\nFirst, I would like to commend the authors for the clarity of the paper, and for creating an open-source package that will help researchers more easily adopt this type of analysis.\n\nThank you!\n\nI would suggest the authors consider adding to the manuscript, either some evidence or some intuition on how feasible would be to use FLMM for very complex model specifications, in terms of computational cost and model convergence.\n\nThis is an excellent point and we will make this suggested change in the Methods and Discussion section in the next draft.\n\nFrom my understanding, this package might potentially be useful not just for photometry data but also for two-photon recordings for example. If so, I would also suggest the authors add to the discussion this potential use.\n\nWe appreciate your thinking on this point, as it would definitely help expand use of the method. We included a brief point in the Discussion that this package would be useful for other techniques, but we will expand upon this.\n\nReviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):\n\nThe authors should define 'function' in context, as well as provide greater detail of the alternate tests that FLMM is compared to in Figure 7. Given the novelty of estimating joint CIs, the authors should be clearer about how this should be reported and how this differs from pointwise CIs (and how this has been done in the past).\n\nThank you, this is a very good point and will be critical for helping analysts describe and interpret results. We will add more detail to the Methods section on this point.\n\nThe authors identify that many photometry studies are complex nested longitudinal designs, using the cohort of 8 animals used in five task designs of Jeong et al. 2022 as an example. The authors miss the opportunity to illustrate how FLMM might be useful in identifying the effects of subject characteristics (e.g. sex, CS+ cue identity).\n\nThis is a great suggestion and we will add this important point to the discussion , especially in light of the factorial designs common in neuroscience experiments.\n\nIn discussing the delay-length change experiment, it would be more accurate to say that proposed versions of RPE and ANCCR do not predict the specific change.\n\nWe will make this change and agree this is a better phrasing."
