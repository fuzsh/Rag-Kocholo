        "text": "Help for Wrongful Foreskin Retraction\n\nFirst aid | Helpful articles | How to file a complaint | Supporting documents\n\nAs an international physicians’ organization, we deeply apologize for the conduct of our fellow professional, and for the unnecessary injury done to your son. American health care professionals are often not well trained or familiar with the normal, intact penis, which can lead to inappropriate and even harmful care or advice. Though the possible consequences of premature, forcible foreskin retraction (PFFR) can be serious, most boys recover without a problem, although they have lost a protective membrane and may be at risk for some complications.\n\nImmediate first aid\n\nWe are available by phone for first-aid advice in the immediate aftermath of an incident of PFFR. Our telephone is (206) 465-6636, 9-5 Pacific Time (or even later), 7 days a week.\n\nIf your child’s foreskin has been left stuck behind the head of the penis (called paraphimosis), it must be returned to the forward position immediately. Click here for information on manual correction of paraphimosis. If you cannot return the foreskin forward, SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY.\n\nReassure your child as best you can. He needs to feel acknowledged for his feelings of violation, and he needs to feel safe and protected.\n\nDO NOT PULL BACK his foreskin (despite obsolete advice about applying a barrier ointment like Vaseline).\n\nChange his diaper promptly after he defecates to reduce the chance of infection.\n\nYour son may urinate incompletely and complain due to stinging of the urine on his raw tissue. Peeing in the bath or a cup of warm water, to dilute the urine, may help.\n\nBathe him normally, avoiding contact with soap or bubble bath (which will sting). Remember: “Only clean what is seen.”\n\nStay alert to signs of infection: excessive redness, swelling, or unusual discharge. There may be some blood or swelling initially, but these should resolve over the first few days.\n\nIn the longer term, your child may develop adhesions from the body’s attempt to repair the trauma. Leave the foreskin alone and any adhesions should disappear in time. [Ponsky 2000]\n\nBack To Top\n\nHelpful articles on forcible foreskin retraction\n\nFor educating physicians who may be in need of correct information on care of the intact penis and the harm of premature, forcible foreskin retraction, see our core document: Memorandum of Evidence-Based Medicine: Concerning the Current Standard of Care Which Prohibits PFFR – Premature, Forcible Foreskin Retraction.\n\nWe encourage parents to read the following articles for good background information on the problem of premature forcible foreskin retraction. The more you know, the more you will be able to protect your son.\n\nPsychology Today: What is the greatest danger for an uncircumcised boy?\n\nPsychology Today: Doctor ignorance of male anatomy harms boys.\n\nYour rights as the parents of an injured child\n\nSadly, we at Doctors Opposing Circumcision are asked to intervene in over 100 cases of premature, forcible foreskin retraction (PFFR) each year. Unfortunately, a warning or educational letter to the provider – by itself – has not proven effective in preventing further occurrences of PFFR. You may wish to file a formal complaint, if only to protect other boys. You have that right.\n\nWe can help you to file your formal complaint, according to the following instructions.\n\nBack To Top\n\nHow to file a formal complaint\n\nFirst, some important considerations\n\nDo you have alternate medical providers? If you live in a small town or are tied to a single clinic or single medical system by insurance restrictions, you should consider whether you need to protect your son’s access to future medical care. You may wish to explore alternate provider arrangements, making sure they are “foreskin-friendly,” before you confront your current provider.\n\nWas the retraction serious enough to warrant a complaint? Some knowledgeable doctors – those who understand the anatomy of the intact penis and take extreme care – could safely examine a child’s penis by gently retracting the foreskin only to the boundary where it attaches to the head of the penis. While this exam technique is usually medically unnecessary, it is not in itself harmful enough to warrant a formal complaint. Signs of a more serious retraction are pain, excessive redness, torn or raw tissue, bleeding, and swelling.\n\nYour alternatives\n\nFile a formal complaint with your state’s medical regulatory authority, attaching the documentation we provide. (Recommended.)\n\n– AND/OR –\n\nSend your complaint to the offending medical provider, and other suggested contacts. (Again, this alone is less likely to protect other boys.)\n\nBack To Top\n\nChecklist of steps to file a complaint\n\nStep 1: Request a customized cover letter from D.O.C. to submit with your complaint. (Optional)\n\nStep 2: Prepare your story of what happened.\n\nStep 3: Print out our supporting documents.\n\nStep 4: Take close-up photographs of your injured son’s genitals. (Optional)\n\nStep 5: Send packet, with all of the above, to your state’s medical regulatory authority and/or other suggested recipients.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Your State’s medical regulatory authority may require additional forms or actions. Follow the directions on the regulatory authority’s website.\n\nStep-by-step instructions for filing a complaint\n\nStep 1: Request cover letter from D.O.C. (Optional)\n\nA customized cover letter from D.O.C. – carrying the credibility of a physicians’ organization – will help your complaint to be taken more seriously.\n\nTo generate a customized cover letter for you, we need certain information on the incident and the parties involved. All information provided will be kept confidential.\n\nSubmit this information to us via our PFFR Data Collection Form and request the cover letter. Your customized cover letter will be sent as an attachment to the email address you provide. You will then add this as a supporting document when you file your complaint.\n\nStep 2: Prepare your story\n\nYou will need to gather relevant names and addresses, and write up a comprehensive and detailed history of exactly what occurred. Include details on when, where, what occurred, by whom, and what the result was. To receive the best consideration, your story should include the following items:\n\nBasic data\n\nFull name of your child, place of birth, and birth date\n\nParents’ full names, addresses, and emails\n\nReason you took him to the doctor (for example, well-baby check, immunization, suspected infection, fever, earache, urinary problems, etc.)\n\nDate (and time, if possible) of the incident\n\nName of the offending doctor, nurse, or other medical professional\n\nName and address of the clinic\n\nDetails of the story\n\nWhether you asked the medical professional not to retract your son and were ignored\n\nWhether or not you observed the doctor washing his/her hands\n\nWhether s/he wore surgical gloves\n\nHow aggressively the doctor retracted your child’s foreskin\n\nHow far was your son retracted? All the way to the base of the glans (corona)?\n\nYour child’s reaction at the moment of retraction\n\nWas your child left with his foreskin fully retracted behind the glans (paraphimosis)?\n\nYour child’s condition over the next few days or weeks\n\nWhether your child bled, had swelling or discharge, or other signs of trauma or infection\n\nWhat efforts you made to relieve your child’s distress\n\nNotes about your own distress and worry\n\nWhether you had to take your son to another medical professional or an Emergency Room\n\nThe advice (good or bad) that you were given about penile hygiene and bathing techniques for intact boys, and by whom\n\nStep 3: Print out the following supporting documents from D.O.C. (or attach PDFs, if filing your complaint electronically)\n\nCover letter from D.O.C., if you requested it from us. Click here to request this optional cover letter, if you have not already done so above.\n\nCore document “Premature, Forcible Foreskin Retraction: A Memorandum of Evidence-based Medicine” on the lack of necessity and harm caused by PFFR, with citations and quotes from the best medical texts and studies. If you send only one of our documents with your complaint, THIS IS THE ONE TO SEND!\n\nKey background articles\n\nPsychology Today: What is the greatest danger for an uncircumcised boy?\n\nPsychology Today: Doctor ignorance of male anatomy harms boys.\n\nD.O.C pamphlet: “The Development of Retractile Foreskin in the Child and Adolescent”\n\nSend to the medical regulatory authority in your state or province.\n\nEach state or province has an agency that regulates the licensing of all medical professionals. This is where to file your complaint. The offending medical provider will be sent a copy of your complaint.\n\nIf you live in the United States, click here to find your state’s complaint address.\n\nIf the link for your state on the above site is broken, or you live in Canada, you can find the correct authority by Googling your state or province name with the words “complaint about medical care or physician.” Then look for “File a Complaint” and follow the site’s instructions for filing.\n\nNOTE: You may be able to file electronically, but be sure to attach our supporting documents by pdf, if you can. IMPORTANT: If you cannot file our documents electronically, print them out and mail them directly to the state agency.\n\nOther suggested places to send your complaint:\n\nSend to the offending medical provider and each clinic partner of the offending professional.\n\nA wide broadcast of your complaint to other members of the clinical staff of the particular medical facility where the PFFR incident occurred may be an effective deterrent. If you send your complaint only to the offending physician, it may have little effect, or never get read.\n\nSend to the Risk Manager of the facility.\n\nThis person is responsible for handling complaints filed against the clinic, to avoid lawsuits. Large clinics or hospitals generally have a designated full-time Risk Manager. Find out the name, title, and address of this person.\n\nSend to the hospital where the doctor has admitting privileges.\n\nMaintaining hospital admitting privileges is important to physicians. If possible, copy your complaint to Chief Medical Officer (CMO) at the hospital where the offending doctor has privileges. This is especially important if the PFFR occurred on the grounds of that hospital.\n\nPlease feel free to contact us at D.O.C. if you have any questions or problems with filing your complaint. (206) 465-6636, 9-5 Pacific Time (or later), 7 days a week.\n\nPublished April 2016, revised September 2023\n\nBack To Top"
