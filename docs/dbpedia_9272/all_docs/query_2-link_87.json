The pressures on the U.S. Military-Industrial Complex (MIC), exacerbated by depleting stocks due to simultaneous engagements on multiple fronts, have prompted a keen interest in India’s capabilities as a significant player in the global defence market.\n\nIndia, unlike some nations, has maintained a neutral stance in both the Israeli-Hamas conflict and the Russian-Ukraine war. Despite being one of the largest operators of Soviet/Russian-origin weapons, India has refrained from taking sides, opting for a careful and observant approach. The country has been closely monitoring export inquiries and orders for Indian-made small arms ammunition, ensuring that such transactions are transparent and adhere to international norms.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nSOURCE: IDRW.ORG TEAM\n\nThe Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE) is planning to convert its Multi-Caliber Individual Weapon System (MCIWS) rifle into a Single Caliber Individual Weapon System (SCAWS) of caliber 6.8mm and 7.62mm (39 & 51). This move is aimed at addressing the Indian Army’s requirements for a more versatile and effective rifle.\n\nThe MCIWS rifle was developed by ARDE in response to the Indian Army’s need for a rifle that could fire different calibers of ammunition. The rifle can currently fire 5.56mm x 45mm, 7.62mm x 39mm, and 6.8mm x 43mm ammunition.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nSOURCE: RAUNAK KUNDE / NEWS BEAT / IDRW.ORG\n\nIn a recent interview, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) Chairman C.B.
