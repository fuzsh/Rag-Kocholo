"PFFR" (pronounced P.F.R.) is a Brooklyn based electro-rock band/art collective consisting of Alyson Levy, Vernon Chatman, Jim Tozzi, and John Lee.

The groups portfolio of work includes 3 LPs: "Rock, Rocker, Rocketh" (2001, self released), "Injustice Center" (2003, Invasion Planete France) and "United We Doth" (2004, Birdman), the download-only EP "Chrome Ghost" (2005, Birdman-A-Phone), art exhibits such as "An Attack On All Americans Or The Tyranny Of Weed" shown at the LFL Galley in New York, and the script for avante garde porn film "Final Flesh".

PFFR are also responsible for creating two television comedy shows; The MTV2 variety show "Wonder Showzen" (2005-2006) and the new Adult Swim CGI series "". For both these shows, Chatman and Lee are the directors and main voice talent, whilst Tozzi and Levy are the animation/character designer and art director, respectively. Levy provides additional voices for both shows whilst Tozzi does only for 'Xavier'. Chatman and Lee also collaborated on Doggy Fizzle Televizzle, a short lived sketch show starring rapper Snoop Dogg who made a guest appearance on PFFR's 'United We Doth' LP.

In interviews, the group have proven to be whimsical and flippant, often going off at random, nonsensical tangents to their own amusement. When asked about their inception and existence, the answer is often the same: "A shimmering gem crashed down from the heavens, black clouds exploded unto the Earth and PFFR was formed." The story's finer details are known to vary, but the basic premise is kept. In an interview given by Chatman and Lee for The Sound Of Young America radio show, host Jesse Thorn asks the duo about the beliefs behind Wonder Showzen, to which they partly reply "We believe in the power of a mythical gem that emenated from a dark cloud in the sky. 'God' queefed her light through it, and the refraction formed a dragon, a cougar and a sea beast. They together shat out a script and we printed it up and shot it."

The bands old [http://www.birdmanrecords.com/pffr.html website] was equally outlandish, consisting of streams of garish, neon colours, a news column with such nonsense articles as "Goblins of Gob World Tour conceived. PFFR hospitalized after first grog. Hospital still under construction" and a 'cute' chipmunk that, when clicked, grows an enormous erect penis that ejaculates to display the sites menu options.

Before Wonder Showzen, PFFR were also known rarely to reveal their personal identities, and would often state that they were a "group of highly motivated young people (aged 13, 15 and older) that formed a band in order to start a riot in the local public library." These nonsense claims and back story appropriately represent their bizarre music and art.

Dina Waxman from the alternative/indie rock band [http://www.spacemtn.com Space MTN] is known to be a founding member of PFFR.
