PFFR ETF : Overview

The PFFR ETF, short for the Preferred Securities ex Financials ETF, is a financial instrument designed to provide investors with exposure to preferred securities issued by real estate investment trusts (REITs). Launched in January 2015, this exchange-traded fund aims to offer diversified exposure to high-yielding liquid preferred securities listed in the United States. Let's delve deeper into its underlying assets and investment strategy.

PFFR ETF Underlying and Exposure: What does it track and how?

Preferred securities are a unique class of equity security that typically offer fixed or floating dividends to investors. They have a preference over common stock in dividend payments and asset distribution in the event of a company's bankruptcy or liquidation. However, they are subordinate to bonds and usually do not carry voting rights. The PFFR ETF invests not less than 90% of its assets in component securities of the Underlying Index, which consists of preferred securities issued by U.S. REITs.

REITs, or Real Estate Investment Trusts, are entities dedicated to owning, operating, or financing income-producing real estate. To qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, a company must distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders annually and derive at least 75% of its income from rents, mortgages, and property sales. The PFFR ETF's Underlying Index may include preferred securities issued by Equity REITs, Mortgage REITs, or Hybrid REITs.

PFFR ETF Benefits: Why Invest in this ETF?

The PFFR ETF offers several advantages to investors. Firstly, preferred securities often provide higher yields compared to common stock, making them attractive for income-focused investors. Secondly, the ETF's focus on real estate preferred securities can add diversification to an investor's portfolio, as the real estate market may perform differently from other sectors during various economic conditions. Additionally, the passive indexing approach adopted by the fund seeks to approximate the performance of the Underlying Index, providing a simple and cost-effective investment strategy.

[PFFR ETF] Considerations Before Investing

While the PFFR ETF has its merits, investors should be aware of certain considerations before adding it to their portfolio. As a non-diversified fund, PFFR may have a greater percentage of its assets invested in a single issuer than a diversified fund, which can increase its exposure to issuer-specific risks. Furthermore, the ETF concentrates its investments in industries similar to the Underlying Index, which, as of the last available data, were Mortgage REITs and Equity REITs industries. Investors should carefully assess their risk tolerance and investment objectives before investing in the PFFR ETF.

Conclusion

The PFFR ETF, focused on preferred securities issued by REITs, can be an attractive option for investors seeking higher yields and diversification within their investment portfolios. With its passive indexing approach and broad exposure to the real estate market, the ETF aims to approximate the performance of the Underlying Index. As always, investors are advised to conduct thorough research and seek professional financial advice before making any investment decisions.
