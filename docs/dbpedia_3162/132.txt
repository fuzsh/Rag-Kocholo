The Atlantic Coast Conference and Southeastern Conference announced Monday that it will collaborate with Apple to bring iPad technology to sidelines and coaching booths for the upcoming football season.

The ACC said in a statement that all 17 football members -- a group that now includes California, SMU and Stanford -- will have access to league-provided iPad Pro and iPad Air models for video playback. The change comes after the NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel approved the use of in-game video in April.

In the statement, ACC commissioner Jim Phillips said the conference has an "unparalleled prioritization of technology," going back to its design of a new game-day operations center. It will assist in football replays as part of the headquarters move to Charlotte last year.

SEC commissioner Greg Sankey announced the partnership during his opening remarks at SEC Kickoff on Monday, confirming that all 16 SEC teams (including new additions Texas and Oklahoma) will use the technology.

"The SEC is committed to using technology to support the competitive experience, and today we are excited to announce new ways we are integrating technology to advance the sport of football," Sankey said. "The SEC is proud to introduce iPad to the sidelines during college football games to elevate the performance of student-athletes into the future."

The ACC's first game this season is Aug. 24 in Dublin, featuring Florida State and Georgia Tech. SEC play begins Sept. 7 between South Carolina and Kentucky.
