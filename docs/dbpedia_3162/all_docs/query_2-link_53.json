        "text": "Learn the ins and outs of utilizing Guided Access on your iPhone to restrict app access, ensuring a more focused and secure user experience.\n\nSharing devices like an iPhone or iPad is common, especially among families with young children.\n\nBut have you ever stopped to think about the apps you don’t want your kids to see?\n\nHere’s the good news. If you allow your kids to use your iPhone or iPad to play games or watch videos, you can use a unique feature called Guided Access to keep them out of other apps.\n\nCurious to know how? Here’s a complete guide on how to use the Guided Accessibility feature on iPhone and iPad.\n\nContents:\n\nWhat is Guided Access?\n\nWhat Devices are Available?\n\nWhere to Find It?\n\nOptions You Can Set within Guided Access\n\nWhy Use Guided Access for Parents?\n\nHow to Use Guided Access\n\nHow to Turn On and Set Up\n\nHow to Start and End a Guided Access Mode Session\n\nHow to Find Other Guided Access Options\n\nTips for Using Guided Access for Parents\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is Guided Access?\n\nGuided Access is a great way to ensure whoever uses your device can’t get into any other apps.\n\nWith this feature, when you pick up your favorite device, your settings will enable Face ID, Touch ID, and even a six-digit password to ensure you, and only you, have access to all the apps on your device.\n\nIn short, the feature locks other users out of any other app when they use your device to play a game, watch a video, and more.\n\nWhat Devices are Available?\n\nThe Guided Access feature is available on iOS, so it’s available on iPhone or iPad devices.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that this feature is only available on iOS 11 or later, which means you need an iPhone 5s or later. For iPads, this means you need an iPad (4th generation), iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, iPad Air, or later. Even the newer generations of the iPod Touch are compatible.\n\nLearn more about setting up the accessibility shortcut on different iOS devices from Apple Support.\n\nUnfortunately, Android currently does not have an easy-to-use control feature.
