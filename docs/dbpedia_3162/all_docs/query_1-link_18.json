        "text": "Many of our game-loving readers complain that Apple’s Game Center app is no longer available on their iPads, iPhones, and iPods. And some people are really upset by this change.\n\nAre you trying to find the Game Center App in your latest iOS version? But it’s nowhere to be found? Well, that’s by design (Apple’s choice.) If you use any iOS or iPadOS version above 10, there is no Game Center app anymore. Instead, it’s a service found in your Settings app.\n\nRelated Reading:\n\nHow to Completely Disable the Game Center: Remove Your Account\n\nHow to Invite Friends Using the Game Center on iOS 13+ and iPadOS+\n\nGame Center Not Working Update: Blank Screen or White Screen\n\nHow Do You Delete Game Data and Restart Your Progress on an iPhone?\n\nHow to Set Up Multiple Player Accounts in the Game Center\n\nGame Center App Not Working: For iOS 9 and Below\n\nToday, you’ll learn everything about where the Game Center is on your iOS device. Let’s keep reading.\n\nWhere Is My Game Center? Check Out Our Video (Or Continue Reading)\n\nYes, It’s True… Game Center Is No Longer a Stand-Alone App\n\nBut even though the app is gone, Game Center settings remain available in the Settings app in iOS and iPadOS (for iOS versions 10 and higher). So, the service is still alive and well… you just don’t see it on your Home Screen anymore.\n\nYou can find Game Center by going to Settings > Game Center.\n\nGame Center Is Now a Service\n\nWhat this means for you is that while the app is gone, its functionality is still there.

Go to Settings > Notifications > Game Center and turn off notifications.\n\nGaming Via Messages\n\nAdding friends and inviting them to games is now handled by the individual game apps using iOS 10’s expanded Messages app.\n\nSo starting in iOS 10, within your game app you send a message to anyone in your Contacts and are immediately able to play a game with them.
