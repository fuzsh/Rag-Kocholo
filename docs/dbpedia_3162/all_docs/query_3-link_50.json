        "text": "The best iPads for gaming give you the best of both worlds. These versatile tools are not only spectacular devices for creatives, but also great entertainment hubs for when it's time to kick back and play cool games like PUBG.\n\nBy and large, iPads can run all the same games that iPhones can, granting iPad owners access to a vast library of games. Plus, an Apple Arcade membership will grant you access to even more high-quality and well-optimised titles, many of which are on a par with console games. In our roundup, we've included a variety of iPads at different price points so whatever your budget, you'll find something that suits.\n\nTo complete your kit, why not check out the best iPad gaming controllers to make the most out of your new gaming slate? Meanwhile, if you have other priorities when it comes to buying an iPad, don't miss our guides to the best iPads for graphic design, or the best iPads for drawing.\n\nQuick list\n\nThe best iPads for gaming right now\n\nBest iPad for gaming overall\n\nIf you want the absolute ultimate gaming experience on an iPad, and money's no object, this is the one to get. Powered by the hugely powerful M2 chip, which is also found in the likes of the MacBook Pro 13-inch (M2, 2022), even the most graphically-intensive games will run with ease on this thing. And that's why this is our pick as the best iPad for gamers looking for more serious play time.\n\nSome might think the M2 chip is overkill, and they'd probably be right. But on the plus side, that means this iPad is definitely future-proof for gaming. It'll probably be years before any game gives the iPad Pro a hard time. If you're a game designer, then the power on offer here means you can code and test out your games, as well.\n\nBest of all, he iPad Pro comes with a huge 12.9-inch mini-LED XDR display. Not only is this the largest screen you can get on an iPad, but the mini-LED technology makes games look phenomenal as well. However, bear in mind that this means the overall size of the iPad Pro is very large compared to other iPads and tablets, so it's not hugely portable. If that's a priority, then check out number 3 on our list.\n\nThis is a very expensive iPad, though. So if you're mainly going to be gaming on it, there are more affordable iPads in this guide that will be better value for money. For more details, see our iPad Pro (M2, 2022) review.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest value iPad for gaming\n\nIf the first option on our list is a little out of your price bracket, we recommend the iPad (2022), as it offers a fantastic balance between affordability, performance and features. It's the cheapest iPad in Apple's current lineup, and thanks to its recent upgrade, it offers excellent overall performance.\n\nWhile it's not as powerful as the M1 and M2-toting iPad Pros (also featured in this guide), the A14 chip is plenty powerful enough to play mobile games on. After all, these games are designed to primarily run on iPhones, so much more power is overkill. It also has a large and vibrant 10.9-inch Liquid Retina (2360x1640) display, which makes games look fantastic, and the larger screen size means many games, especially text-heavy ones, are much more comfortable to play on. Read more in our iPad 2022 review.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest portable iPad for gaming\n\nWant a small and light iPad that you can carry around easily, but which still gives great performance? Then the iPad mini is the one to go for.\n\nThe iPad mini hasn't had an update in a while, so the 2021 model is still the most recent one you can get. The good news is that it remains a brilliant tablet, and can still play modern iPad games with relative ease.\n\nWhat we love about the iPad mini for gaming is that with an 8.3-inch screen (which is an increase on the 7.9-inches of previous models), it's extremely easy to take around with you. If you're after a gaming device that's almost as portable as the iconic GameBoy, then this is the iPad for you.\n\nDespite the smaller screen, games still look fantastic thanks to the Liquid Retina display with 2266x1488 resolution at 326 pixels per inch, which is impressively crisp and vibrant.\n\nIt also packs plenty of power thanks to the A15 Bionic chip, USB-C support, and 5G connectivity, so if you have the appropriate mobile contract, you can download games and play online multiplayer while out and about. It also supports the Apple Pencil 2, so you can again make use of this excellent stylus and its advanced features, which may not help you in games, but means you can also use it for creative work as well. Read more in our full iPad mini (6th gen) review.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest iPad Air for gaming\n\nThe iPad Air used to be the poor cousin of the most powerful iPad Pro. But in 2022, Apple made its mid-range tablet a whole lot more pro-like, giving it the same M1 processor as the 2021 iPad Pros. All this means it's an incredible performer when it comes to even the most advanced iPad games, making it a great alternative to the more expensive iPad Pro.\n\nWhen combined with the stunning 10.9-inch 1640 x 2360 Liquid Retina IPS LCD screen, games look and play fantastically well. The smaller screen and thin design (this is an 'Air' product, after all), means the iPad Air is a great middle ground, offering excellent performance but in a more portable body. It also comes in various colour options, which gives this iPad a bit more personality compared to some of the others.\n\nWhile it does a lot of things right, it's not perfect. The new iPad Air also gets a new, higher, price tag, which puts it worryingly close to the iPad Pro. If you're a gamer that wants the largest screen to play games on, you may be better off saving up a bit more for the iPad Pro. People on a budget may want to look elsewhere as well, such as number two on list.\n\nOtherwise, the 64GB storage offered in the base device is rather small, so you'll probably want to go for the 256GB version if you're installing a lot of games. See our complete iPad Air (5th Gen, 2022) review for more details.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest cheap iPad for gaming\n\nThe 2021 model of the basic iPad may now getting on in years, but it's still a great iPad for gaming. It offers a choice of 64GB and 256GB storage, its 10.2-inch 1620 x 2160 LCD screen is large and looks good, and it can run any iPad game with ease.\n\nThe most compelling reason for going with this model is if you can get one for a low price. Apple has stopped selling this model, but other retailers are still stocking it. And because the newer model is out, you may be able to get this one for an impressively low price. For more information, read our more detailed iPad 10.2 (2021) review.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nFAQs\n\nShould I buy an iPad for gaming?\n\nThe newer M1/M2 iPads are surprisingly powerful for mobile gaming, handling even graphics-intensive titles well. However, they're not quite on par with dedicated gaming laptops or consoles. So if you're primarily interested in high-end gaming, iPads aren't really your best option. At the same time, if you're buying an iPad for other reasons (to watch video, surf the web, run apps, do digital drawing, etc), then the options on our list are all great choices for running mobile and casual games.\n\nDo iPhone games run on iPad?\n\nSome iPhone games will also run on iPad: these are known as Universal games, and are increasingly common. However, with other games the developers create separate versions for iPhone and iPad, to make the most of each device's capabilities. They will normally make this clear by adding 'HD' or 'iPad' to the end of the title. It's always worth checking carefully before you buy, though.\n\nCan I use a games controller with an iPad?\n\nNot fond of playing games on a touchscreen, or worried you'll break the glass by getting too excited? While there aren't many bespoke iPad gaming controllers, many popular PC and console controllers can connect to iPads via Bluetooth. We list our top picks in the guide to the best iPad gaming controllers.\n\nHow to choose the best iPad for gaming\n\nThe first and easiest thing to consider when you're thinking about buying an iPad for gaming is what else you might like to use the device for. If you're a creative, without shadow of a doubt, you'll want to go for the iPad Pro and make use of its powerful M2 chip for everything from digital art to video editing.\n\nOtherwise, you'll want to think about your budget; iPads are pretty pricey devices, and if you want one just for gaming, you might be better off getting a more affordable option like the Mini or the Air. Alternatively, you might rather future proof your investment, going for a pricier model featuring the M2 for years of gaming fun.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nHow we test iPads for gaming\n\nWhen we test iPads in general, we're looking to see how well it performs, how it handles and what specs and features are going to elevate your user experience. That means aspects like the screen, processing power, battery life and compatibility all come into play.\n\nFor gaming specifically, we're looking at how well each iPad can handle power-intensive games, especially online titles like PUBG, League of Legends or Genshin Impact. We want to see rapid response, easy handling and a bright and beautiful display before we recommend an Apple tablet for gaming; and thankfully, many of the devices offer this and more.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nRead more:"
