        "text": "Apps pre-installed on the Apple iOS operating system\n\nApple Inc. develops many apps for iOS that come bundled by default or installed through system updates. Several of the default apps found on iOS have counterparts on Apple's other operating systems macOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS, which are often modified versions of or similar to the iOS application. As each app is integrated into the operating system itself, they often feature greater support for system features than third-party alternatives and are quick to adapt new features of iOS.\n\nApple has also included versions of iWork, iMovie, and GarageBand for free with new device activations since the release of iOS 7; however, these apps are maintained independently from the operating system, with updates instead released through the App Store.[1] Since iOS 10, most pre-installed apps have been removable.[2] With iOS 14 or later, as well as iPadOS 15 or later, users can hide pre-installed apps in the newly introduced App Library, as well as change their default web browser and email client to a third-party alternative.\n\nApplications are listed below based on Apple's App Store developer page.\n\nApplications\n\n[edit]\n\nApp Store\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: App Store (Apple)\n\nThe App Store is a digital distribution platform which allows users to browse and download apps developed with Apple's iOS Software Development Kit. The App Store opened on July 10, 2008, with the release of IPhone OS 2, launching with 500 applications available. The number of apps peaked at around 2.2 million in 2017, but declined slightly over the next few years as Apple began a process to remove old apps or 32-bit apps that do not function as intended or that don't follow current app guidelines.[3] As of 2020, the store features around 1.8 million apps. On September 19, 2019, Apple Arcade, a gaming subscription service that provides unlimited access to a catalogue of games for a monthly fee, was released through a dedicated tab on the App Store.[4]\n\nBooks\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Apple Books\n\nBooks, formerly iBooks, is an e-book reading and store app released in mid-2010, as part of the iOS 4 update.[5] Initially, iBooks was not pre-loaded onto iOS devices, but users could install it free of charge from the App Store. With the release of iOS 8, it became an integrated app. It primarily receives EPUB content from the Apple Books store, but users can also add their own EPUB and Portable Document Format (PDF) files via data synchronization with iTunes. Additionally, the files can be downloaded to Apple Books through Safari or Apple Mail. It is also capable of displaying e-books that incorporate multimedia.[6] Books has also expanded to allow the purchase and listening of audiobooks through the app. Reading goals can be set which encourage users to read for an amount of time each day.[7]\n\nCalculator\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Calculator (Apple)\n\nCalculator is a basic calculator app introduced with the initial launch of the iPhone and iPhone OS 1 in 2007.[8] The standard mode includes a number pad, buttons for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing.

The ability to record video footage was introduced in iPhone OS 3 and has since been updated so that videos can be filmed in time-lapse or slow motion. On the iPhone 7 Plus and above, photos can be taken in 'portrait mode', which creates a depth effect so that the subject is in focus while the background is blurred.[10] The camera is also capable of creating panoramic images.[11] On iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone SE (2nd generation) with iOS 13 or iPhone XR or later on iOS 14 or later, the camera app was redesigned with a new font and a new UI for controls.\n\nClock\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Clock (Apple)\n\nClock is a timekeeping app introduced with the initial launch of the iPhone and iPhone OS 1 in 2007.[8] It allows users to view the current time in locations around the world, set alarms and timers, and use their phone as a stopwatch.[5] Alarms and timers will play a chime once completed, which the user can choose from their ringtone library. A bedtime feature was introduced in iOS 10, which acts as a special alarm in which the user sets both a time they would like to go to bed and a time they would like to wake up.

A list view enables different sorting options. The app offers the exclusive playback of high-quality FLAC audio files,[19] and also offers support for viewing text files, images, and ZIP archives,[20] as well as limited support for video.\n\nFind My\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Find My\n\nFind My is an app and service that enables users to track the locations of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, AirPods, AirTags and accessories compatible with the Find My network.
