        "text": "Many associations and Leagues have questions about how to deal with the hardware (iPad) requirement.\n\nShould we buy new iPads? Can we purchase refurbished iPads?\n\nCan someone on our team bring their personal iPad?\n\nWhere do we buy an iPad and what kind should we buy?\n\nWhere should the iPad be stored?\n\nWho is responsible to have for bringing an iPad to the game?\n\nCommon Solutions / Procedures currently in use:\n\n1. Teams provide their own iPads.\n\nThe coach or manager uses their own.\n\nAnother parent volunteers their iPad for use at home games.\n\nThe team purchases an iPad. At the end of the season they either raffle it off or keep it for the next year. This is the most common approach.\n\n2. Associations provide iPads for each team.\n\nCharge a set amount to each team (~ $200) for the iPad at the start of the season, and when it is returned at the end of the season refund a predetermined amount. After a few seasons, all costs should been recuperated. (Peterborough Minor Hockey)\n\nProvide them to each team and charge the team for the cost of the iPad if it is not returned at the end of the year.\n\nProvide them to teams if needed and include the cost in the team fees.\n\n3. Associations provide iPads for each ice surface. The iPads are stored at the facility in a secured location. They can be signed in and out. Some of the solutions in use include:\n\nThe concession stands. (Pickering Minor Hockey Association)\n\nA locked box in the Referee Room\n\nThe association office. (North Central Predators AAA)\n\nThe front desk of the arena. (Western Fair Arena - London)\n\nThe Zamboni office, where the keys to the dressing rooms are kept.\n\n5. Associations provide iPads for each Convenor.\n\nIn many cases, a league / division convenor (or designate) is required to be at the arena during games. They are responsible for the iPads. (Newmarket Minor Hockey)\n\n6. Scorekeepers bring their own iPads.\n\nThey are required to have an iPad as part of the job.\n\nAssociations provide an iPad to each scorekeeper for use.\n\nMore ideas and solutions:\n\nOver the years, we have seen that on a team of 15 - 17 players, the families usually have 30+ iPads collectively. Almost every family has at least 1 iPad in their possession. iPads can easily be placed into “Guided Access” allowing personal information to be protected.\n\nNew iPads offer the advantage of being the latest technology and use the most recent operating system. This is also the most expensive route, but should offer the longest life.\n\nRefurbished iPads are a cost-efficient option. These can provide an upfront price break and many years of service.\n\nTeam iPads can be used for a variety of purposes including:\n\nFilming away games\n\nProviding a music playlist for the scorekeeper\n\nWhy iPads and not Android tablets?\n\nApple continuously supports older equipment as new hardware is introduced.\n\nHigh quality and reliability of the Apple hardware product.\n\nUser experience is assured - the software will work as expected on any model iPad.\n\nThere is no way to ensure that all different Android devices from dozens of manufacturers will run the software as it should.\n\n1 software version covers all models, everyone is using the same software, allowing the users a guaranteed experience.\n\nDifferent Android devices can require their own versions of the software - making it essentially impossible to keep all versions up to date with the latest improvements.\n\nWe at GameSheet go to great lengths to ensure the hardware that leagues purchase can be used for as long as possible. As a testament to this, the current version of our app supports all the way back to the iPad Air which was released in 2013.\n\nWhat iPad is recommended?\n\nTo get the most out of your purchase, we recommend you purchase the newest model of iPad you can afford. We support any iPad that can run iOS 12 or newer. This goes all the way back to the iPad Air from 2013.\n\nWe do not recommend buying any iPad which cannot run the latest version of iOS.\n\nWhat are the minimum requirements?\n\niPad Scoring App\n\nAny iPad capable of running iOS 12 or newer. The oldest iPad that supports iOS 12 is the 2013 iPad Air.\n\nWhere can I find a complete list of all iPads supported?\n\nFor a complete list of all iPads and the iOS versions they support, click here.\n\nTournament iPad Rentals:\n\nIf you require iPads for tournaments, we have a limited supply available and rent them for $35 / iPad + Shipping per tournament.\n\nPurchasing iPads:\n\nThere are 2 options available if you are looking to purchase iPads:\n\n1. New\n\nDirect from Apple or other authorized dealer\n\nOffers the longest use of the hardware\n\nOptions to purchase extended warranty and protection plans\n\n2. Refurbished\n\nOffers excellent value at a reduced price\n\nLasts for many seasons\n\nGameSheet regularly sources refurbished iPads for our customers. Models and pricing vary, but all come with a good rubber protective case and a 90-day warranty.
