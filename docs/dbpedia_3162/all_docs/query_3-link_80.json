        "text": "I got this game for Christmas and I think it is really cool because you literally get to draw in the air! At first I thought it was magic lol but then I discovered all the technology behind it! Thatâs what made it really interesting for me! But I do have a suggestion that (personally) I think it would make it a whole lot easier for everyone (not just me): you should make it so that you donât have to buy the cards, or pen. You should just have it so that the game would pick a random card for you, and then you draw it, letâs say, with a pencil from around the house. The game should be able to detect it, so it knows you are trying to draw something with it. I think that would help a lot of us because we all donât want to buying some 20 dollar pen and all the cards just for an app. Thatâs why I think you should make the game make all that stuff âin-game) items. Like I said, feature the cards so that the game will pick them randomly for you, and make it so that you can draw with anything: a pencil, flashlight, pen, ruler. Anything would work just please consider my suggestion. Thank You.\n\nI think that the game is really fine when I play it it does have some glitches where when youâre done with a line it brings another line right up when you didnât even write it but in general itâs really really fine and I wish that you could have some more updates on it like with a Harry Potter one it wonât let me have a well the light for the squiggly lines so I really hope you can make it where you can fix that.\n\nI believe we would love the game. The problem we have is in modern day America thereâs still a company who jokes of high speed 10Mbpsâ¦ Iâm not paying them monthly for a sad joke. That said I have no valid internet options aside from mobile hotspots at this time. This creates my problem. Because you do not simply have a way to make the 1st device swap roles with the second device I am unable to have much fun with the family. As the first device draws, and the second guesses.\n\nThe first device has to have the app, the second doesnât. Are you following me? Iâve got 2 phones that can create a mobile hotspot, a tv, and a chrome cast. The chrome cast cannot connect with the phone that will be casting the mobile hotspot.\n\nThis brings me down to 1 hotspot, 1 phone, 1 laptop (that canât download or run your app on just a chrome browser so it also cannot be used in conjunction with the game), and a tv that also canât download or run this app.\n\nSo the final picture looks like this, I can play this game on 2 phones or not at all. This game would be best on a big tv screen or not at all as far as Iâm concerned.\n\nMy request is you please prioritize fixing this issue. Give me a weblink to kick off the game and link the app or create an option in the app to swap roles between device 1 or 2"
