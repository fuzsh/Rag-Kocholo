        "text": "This game is awesome. I love it I think it is the most relaxing game ever!!! I love it in my free time I will get my phone out and play it. It is like so relaxing one time I fell asleep playing it. I think that if you are looking into getting it you should itâs so nice . Itâs all free too . And the best part is I have never seen more then five adds a day. Itâs not like one of my other games that is full of adds. Iâve also never seen a bad add itâs only been good adds. Another thing I love is every day there is a daily puzzle. I love to play this. I would have to say this game is probably in my top five favorite game. I have been playing this game for over six years never once had any problems with this I decided to write a review because Iâve been stuck in my house a while Iâve been playing this game like crazy. I decided I would write this review because all these years of playing I havenât said anything about it so I just want to say flow free you have done an amazing job at this game. I love it !! Thank you so much for creating this game I hope you can put my review on for others to read and find out how good this game is ! And I just wanted to say YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY GET THIS GAME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nFlow free is a game where you have to connect lines. You have an amount of moves and it shows your best amount of moves for that level. What makes this game great is that it is logic and common sense. Also, itâs the fact that it helps your brain really think which two lines should go where so the other lines connect. This is also satisfying seeing them connect. Another thing I like is how they always get harder level by level and scoreboard by scoreboard. I like the idea of them creating daily challenges. The game is perfect really. Itâs very creative and really causes your brain to think. Itâs like a fun, creative, brain game and I like the idea of that.\n\nOne thing that flow free should add is a challenging level where you have a certain amount of time to connect 20-30 lines. Another thing should be versing other players to see who can connect the lines or complete 1 entire scoreboard quicker. These two game modes should be called âExpert Levelâ and âCompetitive Levelâ. I hope flow free can use one of my ideas. Therefore, this game is great but can use a couple game modes.\n\nOnce again, thank you for reading this.\n\n-Nabeeha. A\n\nHi! I absolutely love Flow Free so many categories that you can play AND so many levels! Im just sticking to the basics before Im actually ready. Bored at home? Download this game and try it you will soon later be obsessed with it,just like me. On a long car ride? Download this game! Flow Free is amazing because it just helps time pass by ! How? You ask ,Flow Free helps time pass by because its just so relaxing and then your in that moment and as soon as you know it BOOM ð¥ your already returning back home from that long car ride !(trust me it happened to me ) Stressed out? Play this game ! This game releases my stress and Im sure itâll do the exact same thing with you tooð In for a challenge? I recommend doing the countdown and you can even pick what levels you want to play OH AND BEFORE I FORGET you can choose how much time you want! Anyways I will leave you alone, I know youâre downloading the game! I canât really get into the details too because Im trying to beat my high score ! Bye and I hope my review will interest you into downloading this game ! (I recommend downloading it) ðððð"
