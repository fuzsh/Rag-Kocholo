        "text": "Playing games online with your iPhone or iPad can be really interesting. The adrenaline rush and the feeling are just out of this world, especially since you’re playing live with or against other players who are in different locations.\n\nHowever, while online games are great, you must have an active internet connection before you can play. And you can’t connect to the internet if you don’t have access to a wifi or cellular data plan. So what happens when you exhaust your data plan or lose the network signal? You definitely won’t be able to play, and that’s when offline iOS games become helpful in fighting boredom and keeping you entertained.\n\nWith the increasing number of iPhone app development courses on the internet, everyone wants to become an iPhone app developer, and as the number of developers increases, so does the number of games, which makes it quite challenging to choose the best free offline iOS games to download.\n\nTo make things easy for you, we have created a list of 36 best offline games for iPhones and iPads in 2023 that you can pay for without data or WiFi, and we have also added a brief description of what to expect from each of\n\n1. Solitaire\n\nSolitaire never gets old. This strategic game has been through the ages, right from the era of personal computers. If you’ve ever used a Windows computer and enjoyed playing Solitaire, then the free iOS version will blow your mind away. And if you’ve never played it before, then be ready to have a whole new experience with this classic game because the developers have redesigned Solitaire by adding great and exciting features that make the game even more interesting.\n\nThe Solitaire iOS game features daily challenges for every new day. The objective is to win the challenge, but if you find it difficult to win, you can use the winning deal feature or the customizable options to make things interesting. Once you pass the challenges, you will be rewarded with crowns and trophies. You can play as a single player or multiple players with friends or a random programmed AI. You can also choose themes for Rainy Day, Spring, Christmas, and many others.\n\n2. Asphalt 8: Airborne\n\nWhile you can’t play the latest Asphalt: Legend offline, you can still enjoy some offline car racing adventure with your iPhone or iPad by downloading the Asphalt 8: Airborne for iOS. The game comes with a super interactive graphics with a truckload of features to keep you entertained. There are different ultra-fast and powerful cars for smashing your way through over 40 race tracks that you can unlock in Archase mode. To make things even more interesting, the creators added a multiplayer feature that allows you to play with more than 10 players.\n\nOther features include upgrades that allow you to customize and upgrade your cars and unlocking new locations; and extensions such as unique game modes, mastery challenges, career events, and many more. The best part of it all is that you don’t need the internet for all this, plus you get to play it for free.\n\n3. Spades\n\nSpades stands out as a premier platform offering the classic card game Spades, allowing players to enjoy strategic gameplay and friendly competition anytime, anywhere on their iPhone or iPad. With its offline capabilities and user-friendly interface, Spades.co ensures endless entertainment for players of all skill levels.\n\n4. Badland 2\n\nBadland 2 combines both action and adventure to give players joyful gaming experience. The game is one of the products of Frogmind Games and was released in December 2015. Badland won the Apple’s Game of the Year award in 2016 with over 65 million players around the world.\n\nThe game requires you to guide a small black shadow character through obstacles, such as machines in the jungle until it gets to its destination. Although Badland costs $0.99, you will definitely enjoy playing this offline game for iPads and iPhones.\n\n5. Plants Vs Zombies 2\n\nAlthough the first Plants vs Zombies 2 game recorded massive success, it had a few setbacks.
