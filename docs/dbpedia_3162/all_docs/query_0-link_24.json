As this is a first beta, there is a possibility we could see the application’s return before this fall when iOS 10 is officially released to the public.\n\nAs stock apps have hit the App Store, and users can now delete most of them on iOS 10, it’s entirely possible Apple falls back to allowing Game Center as an App Store download. Personally, it will be nice to have one less app I no longer use on my home screen.\n\nExpand\n\nExpanding\n\nClose\n\nSega today released an update to its classic gaming title Sonic the Hedgehog. The update brings Apple TV support to the table, adding more value to the universal app.\n\nThose of you who’ve already purchased Sonic the Hedgehog on iOS will therefore be able to enjoy the game on the 4th generation Apple TV free of charge. Everyone else will need to pony up $2.99 for the privilege of playing the classic game, but your money goes a long way, as it’s playable on the iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, and Apple TV.\n\nExpand\n\nExpanding\n\nClose\n\nApple is typically pretty tight lipped about product and user stats and data unless it has a giant number it wants to share. We’re told number of iPhones sold on opening weekend and total billions of dollars paid out to developers in total, but we don’t know how many Apple Watches have been sold or which iPads are most popular.\n\nBut analyst Kirk Burgess points out on Twitter that Apple’s Game Center app openly boasts how many users it has with a giant number hidden in plain sight. Take a guess at just how many “players” Apple’s social gaming network has racked up in total. The answer: about 77,000 more than it had about 8 hours ago.\n\nExpand\n\nExpanding\n\nClose\n\nOn Tuesday we reported that Apple was planning to reveal its entry into the wearable market in August or September. Now a new Digitimes report corroborates that timeframe. According to the new report, three different firms have supplied Apple with samples of flexible circuit boards that will be integrated into the iWatch for a fall release.\n\nThe companies involved are Flexium Interconnect, Career Technology, and Zhen Ding Technology Holding, according to Digitimes. Zhen Ding Technology Holding is currently Apple’s largest supplier of such parts and is reportedly planning to increase production in order to meet increased demand for iPhone and iPad circuitry.\n\nAs with all Digitimes reports, it’s probably best to take this with a grain of salt given their less-than-stellar track record.\n\nExpand\n\nExpanding\n\nClose\n\nAAPL Company\n\nApple News\n\nTwitter\n\niMessage\n\nGoogle\n\nApple’s online services going down intermittently, DNS problem/hack likely culprit (Update: Mostly back)\n\nUpdate: The bad DNS entries appear to almost completely be purged and it appears that Apple services are working correctly.\n\n[tweet https://twitter.com/RaceJohnson/status/443882675011469312 align=’center’]\n\nApple’s website and online stores are experiencing issues for many users, according to various tips and reports we’ve received across Twitter. Apple.com, iTunes, the App Store, and some other web services (but not all) are all reporting that they are unavailable.\n\nSome services (like iMessage and Game Center) seem to be unaffected at the moment.\n\nExpand\n\nExpanding\n\nClose\n\nIntroduced by Apple at the September 10 iPhone 5s event, Nike has launched its Nike+ Move application for the iPhone 5s. The app was originally scheduled to arrive on November 6th alongside the new FuelBand SE hardware, but it appears that Nike unleashed the program a bit early.\n\nThe application requires an iPhone 5s as it is completely based off of the new iPhone’s M7 motion co-processor chipset. The M7 chip, which Apple plans to integrate with its own mapping software next year, works with the iPhone’s motion sensors (like the compass and accelerometer) to provide by reliable data while simultaneously improving the phone battery’s overall efficiency.\n\nExpand\n\nExpanding\n\nClose\n\nAAPL Company\n\niOS\n\nApple News\n\niTunes\n\nvideo games\n\nGame Center now allows developers to give cheats the red card\n\nIf you take your iOS games seriously enough to make it to the top of the Game Center Leaderboard, it can be annoying to see someone cheat their way past you with a Leaderboard hack. Previously, all developers could do about it was ask Apple to deal with the issue – but new features in iOS 7 make it possible for developers combat cheaters themselves. We previously told you about all these new anti-cheater features for developers, but today Apple reminds devs in an update that they now have the ability to delete fake scores and block known cheaters altogether.\n\nYou can now view and manage the top 100 scores and usernames for all of your Game Center leaderboards. Protect your legitimate players by signing in to iTunes Connect to delete fake scores or block players that post fake scores. You can also restore scores and players within the same time period.\n\niOS 7 introduced a number of new developer tools to help block Leaderboard spam, including the ability to set realistic maximum scores and reject unsigned submissions. This latest addition goes one step further in allowing developers to directly zap fake scores after the event. Apple this week added a description of exactly how developers can combat fraud on leaderboards in its developer documentation:\n\nAfter you have apps available in the App Store or Mac App Store, iTunes Connect gives you access to 30 days of scores posted to your apps’ leaderboards. If you determine that players are able to generate fraudulent scores, you can remove these scores from a leaderboard or even block individual players from posting scores. You can manage active leaderboards as follows:\n\nView the top 100 scores for a given leaderboard or grouped game leaderboard.\n\nDelete a specific leaderboard score from a leaderboard.\n\nRestore a specific score to a leaderboard.\n\nBlock a player from posting scores to a given leaderboard. This deletes all scores on the leaderboard for that player.\n\nRestore a player and the player’s most recent score posted before being blocked.\n\niTunes Connect maintains 30 days of leaderboard entries for your review: scores older than 30 days cannot be removed from a leaderboard; scores removed or players blocked cannot be restored more than 30 days after they are removed.\n\nFor instructions on how to do this, Apple refers developers to the Managing Game Center Leaderboard Activity section in the iTunes Connect Developer Guide.\n\n00\n\nFollowing its introduction earlier this month, Apple’s newest operating system has fallen under criticism and scrutiny from both designers and casual users alike. Due to both the tight development timetable and the new design direction under Jony Ive, following the removal of former iOS SVP Scott Forstall last fall, iOS 7 is, understandably, the most controversial and intriguing iOS version yet.\n\nIn response to much of the negative criticism directed towards iOS 7, some have suggested that iOS 7 will change substantially before it is released to the general public. Looking back at previous versions of iOS reveals a long trend of subtle refinements to the operating system during beta periods, not dramatic changes. Let’s take a look at how each version of iOS has transformed:\n\nExpand\n\nExpanding\n\nClose\n\nWe already know that Apple has added support for game controllers in iOS7, but it appears that these plans are further along than first thought. According to Kotaku, the above image shows an early iOS gaming controller prototype made specifically for the iPhone 5 by gaming giant Logitech. While they weren’t forthcoming with details of where the device was seen or who showed it to them, Kotaku is standing firm that they believe this photo to be absolutely authentic. The decision to support integrated gaming accessories is in stark contrast to Steve Jobs’ stance that such products would ruin the “elegance” of Apple devices (even though he got his start at Atari).\n\nA reader reached out with this image from one of Apple’s WWDC sessions, which appears to show the same Logitech controller.\n\nBluetooth gaming devices have existed for iOS devices for quite some time but most have had limited compatibility and fragmented compatibility. An integrated, Apple authorized (MFi) gaming controller is going to be a welcomed addition for the iOS gaming community.\n\n3rd party gaming accessories like the iCade Mobile (Above) have existed for years\n\nExpand\n\nExpanding\n\nClose\n\n00\n\nAAPL Company\n\niOS\n\nApple News\n\nAirPlay\n\nSafari\n\nApple seeds OS X 10.8.3 Mountain Lion build 12D76 to developers\n\nAfter releasing 12D74 late last month, Apple released OS X 10.8.3 build 12D76 to developers today with no major changes. Apple isn’t listing any known issues, and the company once again asked developers to focus on AirPlay, AirPort, Game Center, Graphics Drivers, and Safari.\n\nWe’ll let you know if developers report any changes in today’s build. Full release notes below:\n\nThanks, Anonymous!\n\nUpdate: As noted by MacRumors, build 12D76 appears to include support for NVIDIA’s Quadro K5000 graphics card that the company announced for the Mac Pro in September but is yet to ship. Yesterday we told you about the new Sapphire HD 7950 graphics card shown for the first time at CeBIT, while support for the AMD 7000 series was first discovered in a 10.8.3 beta back in November.\n\nThe introduction of the Mac App Store, at least for the Mac’s biggest game publisher Aspyr Media, hasn’t been entirely smooth. Aspyr recently outlined some issues with bringing multiplayer to Mac games due to Game Center and sandboxing restrictions of the Mac App Store, and developing separate versions of games for Steam and the Mac App Store continues to be a hurdle. An example is Borderlands 2. It took Aspyr just two months to ship the Mac version, but the Game Center multiplayer won’t arrive until sometime early this year. However, executives at the company promise Apple’s enthusiasm toward gaming on Mac is stronger than ever thanks to the Mac App Store. Aspyr also said it has much planned for 2013 in Apple’s store and remains platform agnostic, despite running its own competitive GameAgent store.\n\n9to5Mac recently had the chance to speak with Aspyr Vice President of Publishing Elizabeth Howard, with input from CEO Michael Rogers and other execs, about the process of porting games to the Mac App Store, the company’s relationship with Apple and publishers, and the possibility of bringing iOS titles to OS X.\n\nIn case you’re unfamiliar, Aspyr is one of the biggest Mac game publishers bringing PC and console titles to OS X. It regularly leads many of the top paid and grossing charts on the Mac App Store thanks to high-profile releases such as Borderlands 2, RAGE, Call of Duty: Black Ops, and much more.
