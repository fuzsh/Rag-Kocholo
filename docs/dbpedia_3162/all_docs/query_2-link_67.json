        "text": "Kids love iPads. The simplicity of tapping on the screen when they want things to happen means they can learn to use them in seconds, but there’s plenty that Apple’s tablets can do. Whether it’s educational games, entertainment apps, using them to create art with an Apple Pencil or just something to stop them getting bored on car journeys, iPads can be a godsend.\n\nChoosing the right one can feel a bit daunting. After all, don’t they all do the same things? What’s the difference between the normal iPad and the iPad Air? Well, we’re here to simplify things so you can be sure you’re buying the right one.\n\nYou can also read our best iPhone and iPad apps for kids guide to get them off to a good start. Plus, we have a roundup of the best iPhones for kids if you want to immerse them fully in the Apple world as they grow up.\n\nShould I get an iPad for my child?\n\nThere’s been lots of research published about how much screen time our kids should be allowed. Some parents might argue that kids shouldn’t be exposed to screens at such a young age, but frankly, in a world where everything is dominated by technology we think that we owe it to our kids to make sure they are comfortable in that environment, hence the introduction of an iPad is good for their education.\n\nThat said, just sticking them in front of an iPad rather than interacting with them probably isn’t great: Disney+ shouldn’t really be babysitting your kids for hours on end, but if it allows you a few minutes of peace to make dinner then fair enough.\n\nWith that out of the way, there are many reasons why you should be confident about getting an iPad for your kids to use. There are, after all, many other tablets on the market, most of which are cheaper than the iPad. So, if you are looking for some reassurance on is whether the iPad is the best option for your child, here are a few compelling reasons:\n\nThe App Store is full of great apps designed specifically for kids.\n\nMany of those apps will be ideal for school children of various ages, or even toddlers.\n\nThere is an ecosystem of great accessories designed to work with the iPad.\n\niPadOS is easy to use, especially if your child has used your iPhone. The bonus is your iPhone apps will be available on your iPad too and vice versa.\n\nIf you have older children, then take a look at our guide to the best iPads for students.\n\nWhat iPads are there to choose from?\n\nAt the time of writing, Apple offers four categories of iPad, which are as follows.\n\niPad\n\niPad mini\n\niPad Air\n\niPad Pro\n\nIn all honesty, we wouldn’t recommend the iPad Pros or the new Airs for children, as you’d just be paying quite sizeable amounts for performance and compatibility features that they just won’t need. The standard iPad and mini range already offers plenty of scope and power for younger users, so our advice is to stick with those and ignore the Pros and Airs for now. When it comes to students though, it’s a potentially different argument, but the good news is you can put that off for a few years and save up for the more expensive iPad in the meantime.\n\nSpeaking of savings, check out our round-up of the best iPad deals you can get on the whole range of iPads here: The best iPad deals.\n\nIs 64GB enough?\n\nThis depends on how you want to use the iPad. For long trips, you might want to download lots of movies, TV shows, or games to entertain the kids in the car or on the plane. In that case, more storage is better. Otherwise, any apps you purchase can always be deleted and then downloaded again, plus public Wi-Fi can often be available as an easy solution for the little ones streaming a few episodes of their favorite shows.\n\nIf you are buying a refurbished or used iPad, then we’d advise against a 32GB or even 16GB model (although these are much rarer now as it’s been several years since Apple sold any iPads with less than 64GB storage). 64GB should really be the lowest you go in terms of storage, as this gives you enough space to store a good amount of downloaded content.\n\nFor more advice regarding buying a used or refurbished iPad read: Why a refurbished iPad could be the best tablet for you.\n\nDo I need cellular?\n\nProbably not. If you want to add cellular capabilities to your kids’ iPad, we recommend that when you are outside the house you hotspot from your own iPhone rather than spend money on a contract for your child. We most apps will work offline and you can download movies to the device when heading on a long trip.\n\nBest iPad for kids and toddlers\n\nHere’s our advice on which iPad to choose when buying for a child."
