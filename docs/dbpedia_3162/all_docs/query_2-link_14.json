Re-enter to confirm.\n\nGuided Access\n\nGuided Access allows you to lock your iPhone or iPad when in an app. This may be useful for children as they won’t be able to come out of that particular app and will stop them from accessing other apps and settings.\n\nTo enable Guided Access:\n\nStep 1 – Go to your “Settings” tap “Accessibility” then scroll down and tap “Guided Access”.\n\nStep 2 – Tap the Guided Access toggle so it turns green.\n\nStep 3 – Start the Guided Access, tap the side (power) button three times. When enabled, the buttons and touchscreen will be disabled.\n\nIn this section, you can also set a passcode, time limit and enable auto-lock features.\n\nTo turn it off, tap the side button three times.\n\nStep 4 – You can change the options which will appear in the bottom left of your screen which will allow the configure the settings for the app you or your child is on.\n\nTip: Alternatively, you can easily turn on Guided Access by giving the command to Siri which Siri will automatically do for you.\n\nTurn off tracking\n\nIf you have the iOS 14.5 update or above, the App Tracking Transparency feature lets you decide if you want apps to track your activity for advertising purposes. This may not be suitable for children as it may encourage in-app spending.\n\nTo disable:\n\nGo to Settings, then ‘Privacy’. Tap ‘Tracking’. The toggle button should be grey – this means the feature is disabled. Green means enabled.\n\nImportant: If you allow apps to ask to track you, you’ll start to see prompts when you launch updated apps requesting permission to track your activity. If you don’t allow apps to ask you for permission, all apps will automatically be blocked from tracking your activity."
