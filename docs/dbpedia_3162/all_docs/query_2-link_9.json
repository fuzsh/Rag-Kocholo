Every time (100%)\n\nSteps: How can we find the bug ourselves? use an ipad air to open the game\n\nWhat do you expect to see? everything sized to scale and appropriately laid out on the screen\n\nConnection Type Wifi\n\nPlease select your region North America\n\nCountry USA\n\n‌\n\nI moved my game from my phone to my iPad Air, and nothing is displaying properly. There are a lot of things that are too small (see: CAS buttons in the corners), there are hidden items (see: quick tasks hiding behind Emily; Sim names from other players hidden under the sticker selection options), and there is a lot of extra space to the right of several screens that looks like it should be filled by some of the other things I’ve mentioned (see: LlamaZoom and CAS screens).\n\nIt is nice to have a larger screen to see things from, but it’s very hard to use the buttons and features that are still sized for the tiny screen I used to use.\n\nSolved! Go to Solution.\n\nHi, it is now July and my game still looks terrible. I had almost forgotten how poorly sized everything is because I’ve gotten so used to it, but when I see other people’s screenshots I think there is no reason for mine to be so out of proportion. This was marked as a bug but I don’t see anything about it on the bug list? I am sharing another screenshot to show how unnecessarily tiny items are on my screen. Note that Yamachan is standing in front of things that I should be able to see and access on my screen. Also note the very tiny text and image sizes.\n\nThis is still an issue for me. It’s still annoying.\n\nIt occurred to me - I had an iPad mini a long time ago which I might have installed The Sims Mobile on. It’s possible that my newer iPad is confused by the tablet sizing? Is that something that can be changed or recoded in my game?\n\nI got a new I pad and downloaded my sims app on to it but for some reason it is really small so you can’t read anything on it\n\nI have uninstalled and reinstalled but still no luck\n\nplease can you help\n\nProduct: The Sims Mobile\n\nPlatform:Apple iPad\n\nList the specific devices you play with (e.g. iPhone 6s Plus, Samsung Galaxy S7) Ipad 10th generation\n\nOS Version IOS 16.5\n\nHow often does the bug occur? Every time (100%)\n\nSteps: How can we find the bug ourselves? The error message - Fixer upper keeps constantly coming and the font is very tiny\n\nWhat do you expect to see? The font to be of normal size and the error message to go away\n\nConnection Type Wifi\n\nPlease select your region Asia\n\nCountry India\n\n‌\n\nThe icons are really tiny"
