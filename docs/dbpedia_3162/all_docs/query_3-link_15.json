        "text": "When you subscribe to Apple Arcade or Apple One, you can use Family Sharing to share Apple Arcade with up to five other family members. Your family group members don’t need to do anything—Apple Arcade is available to them the first time they open the App Store app after your subscription begins.\n\nIf you join a family group that subscribes to Apple Arcade or Apple One, and you already subscribe, your subscription isn’t renewed on your next billing date; instead, you use the group’s subscription. If you join a family group that doesn’t subscribe, the group uses your subscription.\n\nNote: To stop sharing Apple Arcade with a family group, you can cancel the subscription, leave the family group, or (if you’re the family group organizer) stop using Family Sharing.\n\nGo to Settings > [your name] > Subscriptions, tap Apple Arcade, then follow the onscreen instructions.\n\nIf you cancel your subscription, you can’t play any Apple Arcade games, even if you downloaded them to your device. Delete the apps if you don’t want them anymore.\n\nYou can resubscribe to play Apple Arcade games again and regain access to your gameplay data. If you wait too long, some of your gameplay data might not be supported after you resubscribe."
