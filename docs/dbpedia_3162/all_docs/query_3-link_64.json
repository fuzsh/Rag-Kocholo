        "text": "Your iPadÂ® is clutch and convenient, especially when you want to play games, watch movies, or work on the go. But if you've had yours for a while, you may be wondering how much life it has left. The answer depends on how you use and take care of your tablet.\n\nAt Asurion, we help you get the most from the tech you love. Here's everything you need to know about your iPad's lifespan, including ways that you can make your tablet last longer.\n\nHow long will an iPad last?\n\nYour iPad should last at least 5 years. But your device can last even longer depending on:\n\nYour iPad model. A newer iPad Pro, which has more storage and features, will likely last longer than an older or lower-end model.\n\nHow you use it and what you use it for. If you use your iPad every day and play video games or work with graphic design programs, it'll wear out more quickly.\n\nHow frequently you maintain it. If you update your iPad software regularly, clean it often, and keep its parts in working order, you'll increase its lifespan.\n\nHow many years does an iPad battery last?\n\nYour iPad battery usually lasts about 2 to 3 years, again, depending on how you use your device.\n\nIf you only use your iPad occasionally, the battery will last longer. But if you use your iPad a lot or if you use it in extremely hot or cold temperatures, your battery may die more quickly. Luckily, replacing an iPad battery that's no longer working as it should is a simple and fast repair.\n\nHow long does Apple support iPads?\n\nOn average, Apple provides software updates for 5â6 years. But every time the company launches a new operating system, it stops supporting some of the older models.\n\nThe latest operating system,Â iPadOS 17, is compatible with the iPad Pro (2nd Generation), iPad Air (3rd Generation), iPad (6th Generation), and iPad mini (5th Generation and newer).\n\nWhen should you replace your iPad?\n\nIf you've had your iPad for a while but it works perfectly, hang on to it. But if your tablet's nearing the 5-year-or-older mark, watch out for these signs it may be time to replace it.\n\nYour iPad screen is damaged\n\nSometimes you can live with a tiny blemish on your screen, but cracks and scratches on your iPad will only continue to get worse. They make your device more vulnerable to damage from liquid and dirt and, not to mention, can lead to cuts on your fingers. Depending on the severity of the crack, a simple iPad screen replacement may be the answer. If the LCD behind your screen is also damaged, replacement could be your best option.\n\nYou can't update to the latest operating system\n\nThe latest iPadOSÂ® gives you important security patches and new features. So updating your operating system regularly is crucial.\n\nHaving trouble? Check out our guide forÂ what to do when your iPad won't update.\n\nIf you have an older iPad and none of the fixes in our guide worked, it's possible your device may not support the latest operating system updates. To check if your tablet is eligible, visit theÂ AppleÂ® supportÂ page.\n\nThe apps on your iPad keep crashing\n\nWhen you can't run the latest update, your older software will eventually stop working. And if your apps keep crashing, you can't use them, so it's time to replace your device.\n\nIf you decide to get a new iPad, make sure toÂ back up your dataÂ on your old device first.\n\nYour iPad won't connect to mobile or Wi-Fi networks\n\nIf you have an older iPad with a 3G network, unfortunately, you can't upgrade your mobile networking connection, so you may need to purchase a new iPad if connecting to cellular signals is important to you. When you shop for a new iPad, look at newer models like the iPad Pro 11-inch 4th Generation or the iPad Air 5th Generation for 5G performance.\n\nIf you can't get on the local Wi-Fi network with your tablet, there may be an easy fix. Check out our guide to what to do if yourÂ iPad won't connect to Wi-Fi.\n\nThe battery on your iPad doesn't last\n\nIf your battery power is dwindling, that doesn't necessarily mean you need a new iPad. But it could be a sign you'll need to replace your device's battery soon. How do you know for sure?\n\nMost newer iPads will last 10 hours on battery power, according toÂ Apple. If yours isn't lasting that long, consider contacting an expert toÂ replace your battery.\n\nIf you've previously replaced your iPad battery and it's running out of juice, it's probably time to upgrade your device.\n\nYour iPad keeps running out of space\n\nIf storage is tight on your iPad, there are a few things you can try, like deleting apps you don't use or moving files to theÂ Cloud.\n\nIf you play games or watch moviesâthese apps and files take up a lot of spaceâyou may want to get an iPad with more storage. The M1 iPad Pro comes with 2TB of storage space, which should be enough for all the podcasts and movies you need to get through your next flight.\n\nYour iPad is slow\n\nIf your tablet is acting sluggish, you may have a software problem. Before you start shopping for a new iPad, check out our tips for speeding up a slow iPad for a possible fix.\n\nYou're missing the latest tablet features\n\nCool, new features are the highlight of every iPad release, and FOMO is real. If you have an older model and just can't quit thinking about things you don't haveâlike an Apple PencilÂ®, FaceIDÂ®, or 5G mobile dataâit may be time to upgrade your device.\n\nProtection beyond a tablet warranty"
