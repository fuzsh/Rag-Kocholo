By default, the OS might allow access.\n\nThis feature applies to:\n\niOS 13.0 and newer\n\niPadOS 13.0 and newer\n\nAutonomous single app mode (ASAM)\n\nUse these settings to configure iOS/iPadOS devices to run specific apps in autonomous single app mode (ASAM). When ASAM is configured, and users start one of the configured apps, then the device is locked to that app. App/task switching is disabled until users exit the allowed app.\n\nFor the ASAM configuration to apply, users must manually open the specific app. This task also applies to the Company Portal app.\n\nFor example, in a school or university environment, add an app that lets users take a test on the device. Or, lock the device into the Company Portal app until the user authenticates. When the apps actions are completed by users, or you remove this policy, the device returns to its normal state.\n\nNot all apps support autonomous single app mode. To put an app in ASAM, a bundle ID or a key value pair delivered by an app config policy are typically required. For more information, see the autonomousSingleAppModePermittedAppIDs restriction in Apple's MDM documentation. For more information on the specific settings required for the app you're configuring, see the vendor documentation.\n\nFor example, to configure Zoom Rooms in autonomous single app mode, Zoom says to use the us.zoom.zpcontroller bundle ID. In this instance, you also make a change in the Zoom web portal. For more information, see the Zoom help center.\n\nOn iOS/iPadOS devices, the Company Portal app supports ASAM. When the Company Portal app is in ASAM, users must manually open the Company Portal app. Then the device is locked in the Company Portal app until the user authenticates. When users sign in to the Company Portal app, they can use other apps and the Home screen button on the device. When they sign out of the Company Portal app, the device returns to single app mode, and locks on the Company Portal app.\n\nTo turn the Company Portal app into a 'sign in/sign out' app (enable ASAM), enter the Company Portal app name, such as Microsoft Intune Company Portal, and the bundle ID (com.microsoft.CompanyPortal) in these settings. After this profile is assigned, you must open the Company Portal app to lock the app so users can sign in and sign out of it. For the ASAM configuration to apply, users must manually open the Company Portal app.\n\nWhen the device configuration profile is removed, and the user signs out, the device isn't locked in the Company Portal app.\n\nSettings apply to: Automated device enrollment (supervised)\n\nApp name: Enter the name of the app you want.\n\nApp Bundle ID: Enter the bundle ID of the app you want. To get the bundle ID of an app added to Intune, you can use the Intune admin center.\n\nYou can also Import a CSV file with the list of app names and their bundle IDs.
