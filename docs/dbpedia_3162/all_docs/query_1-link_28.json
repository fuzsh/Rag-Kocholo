Resetting all settings and restarting the phone doesn't work either.

I've never heard of such happening. It doesn't on my phone. Follow the instructions above. You log out of Game Center in Settings.\n\nHow does Game Center freeze the Settings App? What do you mean by that? I've never heard of such happening. It doesn't on my phone. Follow the instructions above. You log out of Game Center in Settings.\n\nYou didn't read what I posted. I can't \"log out of Game Center in settings\"... because as soon as I tap on it, the settings app locks up (freezes)\n\nIn settings, I scroll down to Game Center, tap on it, and it freezes right there. The settings app itself locks up and I can't do anything else. I have to force close the settings app to recover.\n\nWith that said, I just received the 9.2.1 update and am installing it now. I hope it fixes this!\n\nWelp, no dice! 9.2.1 did not fix the problem...\n\nHow does Game Center freeze the Settings App? What do you mean by that?\n\nHere ya go, I whipped up a little video demonstration of the issue:\n\nI would like attention brought to this. Mine has been \"dead\" for a while. I would really like a fix. Here is a thread I found that has been going on for a while on Apple support. There was a \"fix\" posted a couple of days ago but it didn't work for me.\n\nhttps://\n\ndiscussions.\n\napple\n\n.com\n\n/thread/7218355?start=315&tstart=0\n\nMy post count is too low so I hope that works.\n\nThere's a bunch of people in this thread that have experienced the freezing settings app when trying to access Game Center settings.\n\nhttp://forums.imore.com/ios-9/34078...e-center-doesn-t-work-what-could-problem.html\n\nOdd for sure. I don?t see that on my 6s Plus. I don't think it's wide spread. Obviously some do have the issue though. I would first try Reset All Settings.\n\nReset All Settings\n\nGo to Settings >General >Reset >Reset All Settings. This resets to default everything in Settings, including notifications, alerts, brightness, and clock settings like wake up alarms.\n\nIf that doesn't work, you may need to restore your phone as new. Not from a back up. It's a PITA, but it fixes many issues. I did it 3 days after I got my 6s Plus in September.\n\nThis too:\n\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/5431334?tstart=0"
