        "text": "Ever been in the middle of playing Roblox and wondered: Why is my iPadÂ® so hot? An iPad thatâs hot to the touch is common and scary at the same time. More importantly, it keeps you from using your iPad.\n\nDonât worryâthat's where we come in. At Asurion, we make tech easy, from device repair to showing you how to get the most out of your gadgets. Hereâs what to do when you have an overheating iPad.\n\nWhy does your iPad get hot?\n\nWhy is your iPad getting hot in the first place? There are a few factors that can be the cause:\n\nEnvironment. iPads are great for reading by the pool, but they do have their limitsâtemperature limits, that is. Avoid using your iPad in high temperatures or in direct sunlight.\n\nPoor air circulation. iPads don't have internal fans to keep them cool. They rely on air vents to circulate air. When those vents are clogged with dust or debris, the iPad canât cool itself down.\n\nCharging issues. Heating up when charging is normal, though your device shouldnât be getting too hot to the touch. Overheating can be a sign that your charging port is nearing the end or that youâre using a faulty third-party charger.\n\nProcessor exhaustion. Warming up is your deviceâs way of signaling for help when itâs internal components are working too hard or wearing down.\n\nWhat happens when your iPad overheats?\n\nYouâll know your iPad is overheating when it, you know, overheats. Besides getting hot, the iPad may start displaying a few other symptoms:\n\nThe apps slowing down.\n\nThe screen dimming on its own.\n\nThe battery isnât charging or is charging slowly.\n\nSeeing a âcool downâ warning message appear on the screen.\n\nMore than just getting too hot to the touch and putting your game of Among Us on hold, overheating can become a bigger problem. Too much heat over time can lead to battery damage.\n\nHow to cool down your iPad\n\nResist the urge to sit the iPad in front of a fan or put it in the freezer. Rapidly cooling down an overheating iPad can damage it from the inside out. Not to mention the chance of liquid exposure becoming its own problem.\n\nClose some apps\n\nClose your apps. Especially the ones that are no longer in use. Your iPad expends energyâheatâtrying to keep all of your open apps in standby mode. If your device is very hot to the touch, close all of them.\n\nStop charging\n\nSounds like a no-brainerâwe get it. Electricity faces resistance as it passes through components, and resistance causes heat. Thus tech devices tend to get warm when charging (and even warmer when charging and using the item at the same time). Disconnecting the iPad from the charger gives it one less heat source to worry about.\n\nRemove the case\n\nSome cases block the air vents of the iPad. Make sure your case isnât one of them. If it is, remove the case.\n\nTurn off background app refresh\n\nBackground App Refresh is a feature that keeps your apps up to date, even when they arenât in use. That uses energy, which produces heat. For the apps you must have open, turning off background refresh can be a big help. Follow these steps to turn that feature off:\n\nOpen the Settings app.\n\nTap General.\n\nTap Background App Refresh.\n\nTap the switch at the tap to turn the feature off completely.\n\nTips to keep your iPad cool and prevent overheating\n\nUse only Apple-certified chargers\n\nYou probably donât think about that third-party charger you picked up at the corner storeâwell, you should. Youâll notice the charger wears out faster than an AppleÂ®-certified charger. What you might not notice is the damage that a third-party charger can do to your charging port over timeâthese chargers often arenât built to the same specs as Apple-certified chargers, so theyâre prone to causing more wear on your devices.\n\nReduce screen brightness\n\nTurning down your screen brightnessâespecially when not in direct sunlightâcan go a long way toward keeping your iPad cool. If you canât remember to turn the brightness down, turn on adaptive brightness. Hereâs how:\n\nOpen the Settings app.\n\nTap Display & Brightness.\n\nUse the Brightness slider to change the screen brightness. While here, turn on True Tone to have the iPad automatically adapt the brightness of the screen to the lighting around you.\n\nUse Wi-Fi and Bluetooth only when needed\n\nHaving Wi-Fi and BluetoothÂ® turned on causes the iPad to constantly scan for a signalâeven when there isnât one you want to connect to. You donât need Bluetooth turned on unless you're currently using a paired accessory.\n\nGive your iPad a break\n\nWe know itâs hard to take a break from gaming, especially when your in the middle of a win-streak in the SteamÂ® app. We suggest taking your game to the Steam Deckâ¢ or another gaming console. Giving your iPad a break gives it a chance to cool down after heavy use."
