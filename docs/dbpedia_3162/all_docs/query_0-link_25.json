And they have very diffrent data numbers. Does anyone know why?\n\nAttachments\n\nimage.jpg\n\nAs mentioned above one is an app called NHL GameCenter. The other one is the stock app.\n\nImage\n\nNo I'm not talking about the NHL one.\n\n----------\n\nOne is the app and the system service one is from a game which uses Game Center.\n\nInteresting... I think there should be one.\n\nNo I'm not talking about the NHL one.\n\n----------\n\nInteresting... I think there should be one.\n\nThere would be one if that NHL app wasn't called \"Gamecenter\"\n\nNo I'm not talking about the NHL one.\n\n----------\n\nInteresting... I think there should be one.\n\nI can't tell you why the usages are different but it lists Game Center as any other app so that you can disable it's cellular usage, which you can't do from the system services pane.\n\nIf I had to guess I'd say that the difference in usage is the Game Center app usage is when you actually open Game Center, and Game Center is the system services is the traffic that uses the Game Center API without actually opening the app. That is just a guess though.\n\nHe means why is there one under apps (post 1) and one under system services (post 2).\n\nThe top one represents how much space the Gamecenter app uses.\n\nThe 2nd entry is displaying the \"document\" space gamecenter is using. i.e. information stored in gamecenter.\n\nThe top one represents how much space the Gamecenter app uses.\n\nThe 2nd entry is displaying the \"document\" space gamecenter is using. i.e. information stored in gamecenter.\n\nThe OP isn't talking about storage usage. It is about how much cellular data is used and why there is two of them.\n\nGame Center isn't displayed in the usage settings which is what I think you're talking about.\n\nThe OP isn't talking about storage usage.

I think I agree that it should only be listed once for cellular data usage and not 2 times.\n\nCouldn't the one in the app list be for the app itself being open and used over cellular vs. the one is system settings being anything that syncs in the background for games via cellular."
