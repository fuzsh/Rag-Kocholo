        "text": "Capitulating and logging in to Game Center is not the answer. We, as users, should be able to control which notifications and pop-ups we receive. We have paid for our devices and shouldn’t be dictated to by Apple or anyone else about what notifications we get. Before iOS 17 we used to be able to tap ‘cancel’ 3 times and the request to sign in to Game Center would no longer pop up. Now there is NOTHING that can be done to get rid of it. Well done Apple developers: you have peed off lots of people with your nonsense.\n\nDear Apple. Some of us do not want to use Game Centre. We have games, but we do not play well with others. I am happy being a lonely cow on my ipad/ mac etc. Stop trying to socialise me\n\nYou idiots: you don't know your users. My ipad is for my playing alone time. There are no words to define how much you are the most insulting bunch of people to users who own your VERY expensive kit.\n\nI have not logged into Game Center for several years. iOS versions before iOS 17.1.2 did not prompt me to log into Game Center. BUT, iOS 17.1.2 will not stop prompting me to log into Game Center. And yes. I have checked all my settings\n\nIn the main settings menu. I went to Game Center and checked to make sure it was logged out.\n\nThen I went to notifications and notified are turned off.\n\nFinally I went to the iCloud settings and made sure Game Center was not using iCloud.\n\nGoing into settings and resetting all settings is a bad idea unless there are other problems with iOS 17.1.2. and resetting is the only option. If you do a reset, make sure to do a backup before, then restore from the backup.\n\nOr you LOSE all kinds of information. I.e., network passwords, and other information.\n\nSomething is broke and Apple needs to fix it.\n\nThanks Originalfarrowgirl, but I've done all the settings. The ones that work for all other apps. This one continues to plague me with a pop up entering every game. Its very annoying. I've researched on line here and other places and there are no more settings to tweek/turn off. I've never logged into GameCenter and never turned on notifications. My opinion is apple is violating their own app behavior rules, probably to sell me something.\n\nIt's effective for every pop up, except for the initial one when you open up the game. One pop-up is a far cry from them happening continuously while playing. If you did not achieve the desired effect, then you incorrectly followed the procedure I would try again, but as I said, this will not affect the initial one time pop up when you open a game."
