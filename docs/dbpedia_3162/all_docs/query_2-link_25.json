        "text": "Support for higher resolution photos and videos.\n\nSupport for larger file sizes and file sharing.\n\nAudio messages.\n\nCross-platform emoji reactions.\n\nReal-time typing indicators.\n\nRead receipts.\n\nAbility to send messages over cellular or Wi-Fi (SMS is cellular only). There is no cost to send an RCS message over Wi-Fi.\n\nImproved group chats.\n\nBetter security. Google's version of RCS has end-to-end encryption, which Apple does not intend to use. Apple will instead work with the GSMA to develop a more secure form of encryption that is baked natively into RCS.\n\nMore information on all of the features coming with the adoption of RCS can be found in our RCS guide.\n\nOther Messages Features\n\nEmoji - Messages with a single emoji now depict the emoji as larger than before.\n\nLinks - Link cards have been improved with a background that matches the content in the link, plus there is an option to send plain text links or opt for full-size or compact link cards.\n\nEquations - Math equations can be solved in any text field, including Messages. To get a solution, just type in your equation and then add an equals sign.\n\nPhotos\n\nApple overhauled the Photos app with an updated design for the library that essentially combines the For You, Albums, and Library tabs. In iOS 18, there's a main Library section paired with different \"Collections\" that you can get to by scrolling down. Collections include Memories, People and Pets, Recent Days, Trips, Albums, and more.\n\nYou can still get to the same general library view, but you need to swipe down to access the month and year filtering tools, along with new filter options to hide screenshots and other similar images. You can also pin your own Collections and organize your Photos app to put what's important to you front and center.\n\nAlong with People and Pets, the Photos app supports Groups for the first time, so you if you have a lot of photos with two or more people, you can see those organized into a specific group as well as individual people. Groups are created automatically using on-device learning, but you can also create them.\n\nThe Photos app includes Apple Intelligence for image editing, a feature that will be coming later this year. You can use the Clean Up tool to remove unwanted background objects from your images. The Photos app can automatically highlight what you might want to remove based on the composition of the image, but you can also take control and tap, circle, or paint over what you want to remove. The removal tool understands the main subject of the image and maintains the integrity of the photo while filling in the area where an object was removed.\n\nApple Intelligence can also create custom memory movies of anything that you want to see. You can enter a description like \"all the photos of my cat last winter set to a rock song\" or \"the desserts I ate during the summer, set to a pop song\" and Apple Intelligence will find the relevant photos and create a movie that is complete with a narrative arc.\n\nSearch in the Photos app is improved with natural language support, so you can describe what you're looking for to find it. You can even search for a specific moment in a video clip.\n\nApple has added a number of new Utilities albums for finding content within photos like text and receipts. You were previously able to search for some of these options, but having a dedicated Utility folder makes them quicker to get to.\n\nHidden\n\nRecently Deleted\n\nDuplicates\n\nReceipts\n\nHandwriting\n\nIllustrations\n\nQR Codes\n\nRecently Saved\n\nRecently Viewed\n\nRecently Edited\n\nDocuments\n\nImports\n\nMaps\n\nRecovered\n\nSome of the Utilities options only show up if you have an image in that category. The Recovered section, for example, shows up if there are pictures or videos on your device that are not in the Photos Library. This can happen from database corruption issues or if images taken with a camera app that do not get properly saved to the Photos app.\n\nAt the bottom of the Photos app, you'll also see suggestions for images that would make good wallpapers.\n\nMail\n\nApple is overhauling the Mail app with Apple Intelligence. Starting later this year, incoming emails will be organized into categories that include Primary for your main time-sensitive emails, Promotions for marketing and sales messages, Transactions for receipts and order confirmations, and Updates for newsletters and other similar emails.\n\nApple will automatically know which emails are important and will give them a priority status, which puts them at the top of your Primary inbox. Priority emails will include things like flight check-ins, deadlines, and reminders that are due. Messages from the same sender will be grouped together, so you can see things like all of your receipts from one vendor or all of the marketing emails from a store in the same place.\n\nA summary of a long email can be generated with just a tap, so you can check to see if a message is worth your time before you read the entire thing.\n\nSmart Reply can be used to identify questions in an email that you were asked with your iPhone generating relevant responses so you can send a reply with a few taps.\n\nSafari\n\nSafari's \"Highlights\" feature automatically detects relevant information on a webpage and highlights it for you as you browse. You might see highlights for directions, hours, and menus on restaurant and store websites, and on other sites, Safari will highlight information about people, music, movies, and TV shows, depending on what you're browsing.\n\nApple also redesigned the Reader mode, adding a table of contents so you can skip to relevant parts of a site and an option that summarizes the page for you.\n\nSafari includes Distraction Control, a feature that cuts down on distracting elements on webpages like sign-in windows, cookie preference popups, GDPR notices, newsletter signup banners, autoplay videos, and more. Distraction Control is not an ad blocker and it can'tt be used to block elements on a page that refresh, but it is useful for static elements.\n\nDistraction Control can be enabled from the Safari Page Menu by tapping the Hide Distracting Items option. From there, elements on the page can be hidden by tapping on them.\n\nMore on what's new in Safari can be found in our iOS 18 Safari guide.\n\nPasswords (NEW)\n\nApple moved the Passwords section in the Settings app to a dedicated Passwords app in iOS 18, so it's now easier to get to all of your passwords and logins that you've stored.\n\nThe Passwords app holds your passwords and logins for apps and websites, one-time access codes for two-factor authentication, Wi-Fi passwords, and passkeys. There are also dedicated sections for security alerts, with Apple letting you know about passwords that are too short, have been reused, or have been found in a breach.\n\nYou can share passwords with friends and family by creating a shared password group, which gives everyone logins to shared streaming services, home devices, and more. Passwords are added to the Passwords app automatically when you use Apple's built-in saving feature on an Apple device, but you can also add logins by tapping on the \"+\" button.\n\nThe app is organized with a search bar at the top and a series of letters so you can search for the login you're looking for or tap on a letter of the alphabet to get to that section quickly. Tapping in to one of your passwords gives the option to change it, add notes, or set up a verification code. Apple lets you know if your password for a given site is strong enough.\n\nIf you have AutoFill turned on, the Passwords app can supply your passwords and logins for apps and websites. Passwords are synced across iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Vision Pro, and even Windows PCs through the iCloud for Windows app.\n\nYou can find more information on the Passwords app in our dedicated Passwords guide.\n\nHow to Share Wi-Fi Passwords With a QR Code\n\nNotes\n\nNotes includes a feature for capturing audio recordings and putting out a live transcript along with a summary of what's included. Live transcriptions can be searched though, and combined with other documents, comments, and lists in the Notes app.\n\nMath Notes, a built-in feature in the Notes app, allows you to solve equations, so you can do things like add up a monthly budget or figure out a split for a restaurant bill. It can solve all kinds of math problems, and generates totals when you add in an equals sign.\n\nFor improved organization, sections in notes can be collapsed down, with this feature available when you have your notes organized with headers. You can also now highlight text in notes, with Apple providing five colors to choose from.\n\nPhone\n\nIn the Phone app, there's now an option to record an incoming call. Both parties are alerted when this option is selected, and your iPhone is able to generate a transcript of the call.\n\nApple has also added support for T9 dialing, allowing you to type a contact's name using the number pad. When you use the letters on the number pad in this way, matching contacts appear above so you can quickly dial you're trying to reach without having to use the Contacts app.\n\nWhen you type in a number using the keypad in the Phone app, it provides options to create a new contact or add it to an existing contact. Adding a new contact with this method was available previously, but updating an existing contact with a new number was not an option.\n\nWallet\n\nTap to Cash is a new feature that makes it easy to make in-person payments with another iPhone user. You can tap two iPhones together to send money without having to share your email address or phone number.\n\nMoney transfers use Apple Cash and are authenticated with Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode. To use the feature, open up the Wallet app, tap on \"Tap to Cash,\" authenticate, and then touch your iPhone to the iPhone of the person you're paying.\n\nTickets for events that are stored in the Wallet app have a new look with an included event guide that provides details on bag policies, food options, merchandise, temperature, opening times, parking info, and more.\n\nWith Apple Pay, Apple supports viewing and using rewards or point balances for credit and debit cards, so you can do things like apply your credit card points toward an Apple Pay purchase. You can also access financing installment options from your bank if you want to pay for something over time.\n\nMaps\n\nThe Maps app supports topographic maps that are complete with trail networks and hikes, a feature that Apple first brought to the Apple Watch last year. There are maps of trails and hike suggestions for all 63 national parks in the United States. There are thousands of hikes available, with Apple providing an option to save favorites, add notes, and get information like elevation and length.\n\nAs with regular maps, the topographic hiking maps can be saved for offline use, complete with turn-by-turn guidance.\n\nThere is support for creating your own hikes and walking routes, with tools for route options like one way, out and back, or a loop. Creating routes is available for walking directions and is not limited to trails, but there is no option to create a custom driving route.\n\nJournal\n\nThe dedicated Journal app now supports logging your state of mind when you write an entry, and time spent journaling can be recorded as mindful minutes in the Health app.\n\nApple added an insights view so you can see your writing streaks, a calendar with your entries, and stats like places you've visited, number of words you've written, and how often you've journaled during the year.\n\nOther new additions include options for sorting and searching past entries and adding a widget for tracking streaks or providing writing prompts.\n\nApple TV App\n\nThe dedicated Apple TV app supports InSights, a feature that provides more information about music and actors in a TV show or movie. You can get InSights when using the iPhone as a remote for the Apple TV 4K, but it is limited to Apple TV+ shows.\n\nEnhance Dialogue has been an Apple TV app feature on the Apple TV 4K, but Apple is adding it to the iPhone when playing content through the built-in speakers, AirPods, or other speakers and headphones. Enhance Dialogue uses machine learning and computational audio to boost vocal clarity over the noise of music and background sounds in a show or movie.\n\nHome\n\nThe Home app supports new guest features so you can give people temporary access to your smart locks, garage door openers, and alarm systems at select times. Access can repeat, so you can do things like let your house cleaner in weekly at a set time.\n\nHands-free unlocking is available for door locks that support Ultra Wideband technology, which means you can unlock your door automatically with an iPhone or Apple Watch as you approach.\n\nApple allows you to select which Home Hub you want HomeKit to rely on, which is handy if you have multiple devices that work as a Home Hub like HomePods and Apple TVs. You can also now use the Adaptive Lighting functionality with Matter smart lights.\n\nLater this year, HomeKit will support robot vacuum cleaners and will provide home electricity use metrics in partnership with electric companies. At launch, it will be available to Pacific Gas and Electric Company customers.\n\nCalculator\n\nThe Calculator app stores history, so you are able to see all of your prior calculations. In addition to the Basic and Scientific sections, Apple added a Math Notes section to the Calculator app that ties in with the Notes app for solving equations in a note.\n\nYou can swap modes by tapping on the calculator icon at the bottom of the Calculator app interface, and this icon also opens up a new convert option. If you type in 10, for example, and then hit the calculator icon and then convert, you can choose from all kinds of conversion options.\n\nCurrency, area, data, energy, force, length, power, pressure, temperature, time, volume, and weight are just some of the inputs you can choose.\n\nApple Music\n\nApple Intelligence will likely be used to create playlist artwork in Apple Music, generating covers using Image Playground. Apple plans to add a new \"Create Image\" button when creating an Apple Music playlist, which will bring up an Image Playground interface for generating custom playlist artwork.\n\nCalendar\n\nApple refreshed the Calendar app with a new month view that makes it simpler to see the events that you have coming up.\n\nCalendar also integrates with the Reminders app for creating, viewing, editing, and completing reminders in the Calendar app without having to open up Reminders."
