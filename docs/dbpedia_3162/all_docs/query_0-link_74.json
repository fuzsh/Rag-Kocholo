Who tested it on 8.2?\n\nUPD: On IPad mini(8.2) game center works fine. But doesn’t work on Iphone 5(8.2)\n\nIn Xcode, go to Target → Capabilities → Game Center and set it to ‘On’.\n\nGame center must to be ‘On’ too on:\n\nCheck in Apple Developers → Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles → App IDs → Game ID → Game Center.\n\niTunes Connect → My Apps → Game → App for iOS → Ready for Sale → Game Center.\n\nI got as red Alert in Game Center in Xcode: ‘Add the Game Center feature to your App ID’. But I have tested:\n\nSocial.localUser.Authenticate.\n\nGameCenterPlatform.ShowLeaderboardUI.\n\nSocial.ReportScore.\n\nAnd they work well.\n\nP.D: I’m translating from the Spanish. Maybe some names are not exactly the same."
