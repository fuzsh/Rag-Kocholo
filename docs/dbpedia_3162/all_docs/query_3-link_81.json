        "text": "Gaming tablets offer more than just a screen for play. These devices need to juggle productivity features and entertainment options to make their prices worthwhile, all while still offering a high quality gameplay across a variety of genres. That's why costs can rack up so quickly on these purpose-built devices, you're getting specs that don't typically make their way into everyday tech. However, many mainstream tablets are well suited to your thumb-tapping titles, and with the advent of cloud gaming they're only getting more and more useful as time goes on.\n\nThe best gaming tablet right now is the Asus ROG Flow Z13 - a Windows 11 device packing an RTX graphics card with the option to boost up to an RTX 4090 with the help of an external GPU. However, its high price point may well place it outside of the majority of budgets. That's why we're rounding up all our favorite slabs across the full price range.\n\nIf you've outgrown your gaming phone, or need something more versatile than a gaming handheld, there are plenty of options out there for you. Not only that, but the best gaming tablets are starting to rival gaming laptops for their performance and value for money these days. If you're looking to invest in a high-end device there's some seriously exciting stuff on the table right now.\n\nThe quick list\n\nThe best gaming tablet overall\n\nThe Asus ROG Flow Z13 goes where no gaming tablet has gone before. This is a hybrid tablet and Asus gaming laptop, packing Intel's 12th generation processors and an RTX 3050 Ti graphics card.\n\nDesign: The ROG Flow Z13 is certainly chunky - and it's the heaviest tablet you'll find listed here. That's because it's got the components of a full PC to work with, though, so it's actually surprising it's not too heavy. One-handed use might be out of the question but this is still an incredibly portable device. Not only that, but we particularly enjoyed the subtle RGB window into the circuitry on the back - a premium touch that lets the whole world know exactly what this tablet is being used for.\n\nFeatures: There's the whole world of PC gaming at your fingertips here thanks to Windows 11, which means more games and services open to you than any other gaming tablet on this list. Using the Asus ROG Flow Z13 in both tablet and laptop mode was a dream, with a responsive magnetic keyboard and a sturdy kickstand to keep everything safe.\n\nPerformance: We found that RTX 3050 Ti GPU to struggle a little in our testing, but you'll still get far better performance than in other multi-purpose devices. It's important to note that this is an incredibly well engineered piece of kit. Our unit had an i9-12900H processor under the hood with that latest generation graphics card, 16GB RAM, and a 1TB SSD - all working together to offer some serious performance without the temperature and noise concerns of similar slimline devices. While the price point will lock many out of this luxury experience - and won't be worth it for those after a laptop - this is certainly the best gaming tablet on the market right now when it comes down to sheer power.\n\nVerdict: While we struggled to recommend it as a gaming laptop in its entirety (this thing is particularly expensive), those on the hunt for a high-end gaming tablet with PC-level performance should definitely take note.\n\nRead more: Asus ROG Flow Z13 review\n\nBack to top\n\nThe best budget gaming tablet\n\nIf you're on the hunt for a cheap gaming tablet that will see you through your favorite mobile games alongside web browsing and streaming, then the Amazon Fire HD 10 is really all you need.\n\nDesign: The design is basic, you're picking up a black slate with a screen after all. With thicker bezels than you'll find on more expensive models, and a plastic construction this doesn't feel like a premium product. It doesn't need to, though, it's a cheap chassis to hold everything you need at a price that won't break the bank.\n\nFeatures: You're picking up a high quality screen that will help your games shine and plenty of internal power for a smooth experience in lighter titles. That's considerable value for money, especially considering just how often these devices go on sale. While the MSRP stands at $149.99 for the 32GB model, that's by no means the cheapest you can find these tablets during sale events. Those speakers are a little tinny and you won't find the slickest touchscreen experience on the market here, but it'll certainly do for budget light gameplay.\n\nPerformance: The Amazon Fire HD 10 can do what it does very well. Running games from Amazon's own Fire selection and across Luna's streaming service feels slick and smooth, with very few bumps along the way. While navigation between apps can feel a little more cumbersome, once you're there you're good to go. Trying to push the Fire HD 10 past anything lighter will leave you with a few stutters though - this one's for thumb tappers on the big screen.\n\nVerdict: The Amazon Fire HD 10 is perfect for those who need a decent Minecraft or LEGO Star Wars machine but don't need to sink pay cheques into an investment. Sure, you won't be getting the gut-busting performance of a dedicated device like the Asus ROG Flow Z13, or the premium finish and experience of an iPad Pro - but you're not spending anywhere near the costs of those devices.\n\nBack to top\n\nThe best mid-range gaming tablet\n\nApple's latest iPad Air lives in the Goldilocks 'just right' zone of the best gaming tablets. Thanks to a reasonable price - for Apple, anyway - and oodles of power beneath a chic design, it's everything you could want from a mid-range device.\n\nDesign: The Air follows the same design language of most iPads released recently. The squared off sides, flat back, and range of color options give it a lightweight profile with a nice level of personalization at checkout. Of course, everything feels sturdy here - we've managed to drop ours several times over the last couple of years and everything is fine.\n\nFeatures: Besides that revolutionary M2 processor, it offers a handsome 11-inch or 13-inch Liquid Retina display that'll show off your games, movies, and TV shows at their best. Because there's no home button, that screen has a bit more real-estate to play with as well.\n\nThanks to compatibility with Apple's own keyboard and trackpad, the Air is also giving you the functionality of an iPad Pro without the associated price tag. That makes it an excellent choice for those who don't want to destroy their bank balance for the best of the best, but equally aren't keen on budget alternatives.\n\nPerformance: The iPad Air often surprises us in its performance offerings. With that M2 processor at the helm, the majority of larger big releases can run smoothly with settings turned down and you'll be able to enjoy all the App Store's triple-A content as well. The lower refresh rate display compared to the Pro model does mean motion isn't handled quite as well, but considering the Pro's price we're not arguing. With a solid battery life, bright, crisp display, and an impressive set of speakers there's already plenty to love here.\n\nVerdict: While some older 2022 models are still hanging around on the shelves, we'd recommend keeping a closer eye on the 2024 version. It's the best mid-range gaming tablet on the market right now, and older devices are harder to come by.\n\nBack to top\n\nBest Apple gaming tablet\n\nWant the best Apple gaming tablet possible? You can't beat the new generation of iPad Pro.\n\nDesign: There's no doubt about it, the iPad Pro is gorgeous. Between its sleek chassis and that giant Ultra Retina XDR OLED display staring up at you, these are seriously good looking devices. Of course, you're getting the durability and craftsmanship you would expect from an Apple device (just watch those corners if you're not using a bumper case), and a couple of different muted aesthetic options to choose from.\n\nFeatures: With a powerful Apple M4 processor, trackpad and keyboard functionality, and a truly gorgeous Ultra Retina display with ProMotion technology, this is one of the best gaming tablets on the market by a long shot. Elsewhere, the new Pro offers a dual-camera setup and lidar sensors. These boost the performance of augmented reality apps by allowing the iPad to better judge distances. When combined with an excellent Liquid Retina screen that's perfect for games and movies, FaceID, and compatibility with the must-have Apple Pencil, this is pinnacle tech.\n\nPerformance: That M4 processor boosts nearly every aspect of the iPad Pro experience, including the performance of your games. That means you'll load up titles faster, experience less lag, and your device will manage its battery far better when playing intensive software as well. The 120Hz refresh rate display also comes in mighty handy when running faster titles, keeping up with your framerate beautifully for super slick gameplay.\n\nVerdict: The iPad Pro isn't going to be used solely as a gaming tablet for the vast majority of buyers. Instead, this is an all-in-one productivity machines with the best gaming chops among Apple devices. It's an investment, but if you need a creative tablet for media editing, demanding workflows, and impressive gaming you're all set.\n\nBack to top\n\nYou don't need an iPad Pro to experience everything Apple tablets have to offer. Its entry level cousin is brilliant in its own right, and the 2021 iPad 10.2 (9th generation) is an excellent budget all-rounder.\n\nDesign: The 9th generation iPad follows a slightly older Apple design language, with larger bezels at the top and bottom of the screen, a physical home button (with fingerprint reader), and a gently sloped back. It still feels like a luxury device, though, thanks to the solid construction and matte finish on the back.\n\nFeatures: Thanks to an A13 Bionic chip with more than enough grunt to handle most games, it offers everything you need - and then some - from an everyday tablet. Plus, that 10.2-inch Retina display makes sure everything looks its best at all times. What's more, this iPad makes up for its lack of storage options and a disappointing selfie camera by being compatible with the Apple Pencil. The latter is a revelation for artists and doodlers alike, responding to pressure in a way that blows many digital drawing pads out of the water. A 20W plug also means the iPad 10.2 also charges much faster than earlier versions.\n\nPerformance: The older A13 chip isn't going to give Apple's M1 a hard time, but it can still keep up with everyday thumb tapper games and plenty more larger titles from the App store. You might not experience such fast loading times as more expensive models, and the slightly smaller 10.2-inch Retina display doesn't offer as much real estate or color depth as the Air model. However, for everyday note-taking, streaming, and App Store titles it's a solid machine.\n\nVerdict: The 9th generation iPad still feels premium, with a bright screen, solid processing performance, and a solid chassis design. It's perfect for lighter use with that Apple flair, just without the crippling price tag to match.\n\nBack to top\n\nBest Android gaming tablet\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra is a premium affair, but it's the best gaming tablet using the Android operating system on the market right now.\n\nDesign: Day to day, we loved the look and feel of the Tab S8 Ultra when browsing the web and catching up on YouTube content. Again, that larger screen came in clutch, requiring very little scrolling to read longer articles, however did grow a little too heavy when held vertically. We found the whole slab much easier to hold horizontally, when there's less hardware to create a top-heavy feel, but if you're after a one-handed device this certainly isn't it.\n\nFeatures: Despite not offering a fully fledged OLED display, we were seriously impressed by the black levels on this screen. It's the largest tablet screen (Asus ROG Flow included) we've had our hands on. That makes for a far more immersive experience than you'll find elsewhere - even if you are paying for that luxury. The speakers pack a serious punch, especially once you switch on Dolby Atmos, you're getting the S Pen stylus included for note-taking (Apple's devices require a separate purchase), and you're also benefiting from task bar app switching as well.\n\nPerformance: We were able to maintain a solid refresh rate with Call of Duty Mobile set to max, even if Diablo Immortal struggled to reach the same heights. We would certainly recommend using a mobile controller for these endeavours, though. That larger display makes on-screen controls particularly difficult for anything too taxing, but did make light work of puzzlers like Monument Valley. That massive 14.6-inch display is certainly working hard for you as well, offering up a sense of immersion that can't be matched by other entries on this list.\n\nVerdict: If you're after on-the-go Fortnite on a massive 14-inch display, this is where you need to be. It outsizes Apple's Pro line, and boosts performance over Samsung's regular flagships, making it a go-to if you're after an all-in-one device for play, streaming, and the odd bit of work.\n\nRead more: Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra review\n\nBack to top\n\nSure, you can get Android or Apple products that are flashier. But few provide the same level of bang for buck as the Samsung Galaxy Tab A7.\n\nDesign: A sleeker design with smaller bezels helps maintain that image of quality; as well as looking modern, the Tab A7 allows more space for a larger screen than the iPad 9th generation. The whole affair is simple but lightweight, with the choice between dark gray, silver, and gold colorways all splashed across a standard but durable feeling back panel. You're certainly upgrading over the Fire HD 10's plastic construction here.\n\nFeatures: You get some cool toys to play with despite cutting costs, too. Namely, the A7 features facial recognition for faster unlocks. After using the feature for a while, it's difficult to go back. However, we were more appreciative of the good old 3.5mm headphone jack. You'll also find a MicroSD card slot to boost the 32GB internal storage running along the edge as well. The screen is far behind its siblings, rocking up with a 2,000 x 1,200 LCD panel, which means lower brightness and some odd viewing angle issues. However, you're still getting a quad speaker and Dolby Atmos for a more cinematic experience.\n\nPerformance: While its Qualcomm SM6115 processor won't be able to keep up with more expensive competitors, the Tab A7 is still miles ahead of cheap and cheerful alternatives. That means it'll be able to take most games in its stride. Indeed, it'll only struggle when you ask it to run more demanding software, or lots of programs at once.\n\nVerdict: Anyone looking to save some cash without going down the Apple route should check out the A7. There are some tradeoffs in screen quality, but a 10.4-inch display and a budget-friendly approach means this is one of the best gaming tablets out there for entry level Samsung-ites.\n\nBack to top\n\nFull Comparison\n\nIf you're still unsure which tablet is right for you, we're comparing everything in one shot just below. We're ranking each gaming tablet above across a series of categories so that you can work out exactly what suits your needs best. These star ratings are all on a sliding scale relative to the rest of the models on show, so - for example - while the Amazon Fire HD 10 has solid speed considering its price point, it's still slower than the others in the comparison.\n\nWhat to look for in a gaming tablet\n\nBuying a tablet explicitly for gaming means you'll need to check out a few features that might not make it into your hit list of an every day device. There's one big one, which is the games you can actually play on the device, but other than that things like processing power, WiFi versions, Bluetooth speeds, and refresh rates are more important here than for a more casual use.\n\nWhat game services does this tablet support?\n\nDifferent tablets will run on different operating systems, which means you'll need to check out the games you can actually download and run on your device. While the majority of Apple and Android devices will be able to stream from cloud gaming services like Xbox and Nvidia, it's worth having a nose through their app stores as well. Apple, for example, offers the Arcade subscription but doesn't carry Fortnite on its store.\n\nAfter you've found an operating system, it's time to make sure you're getting enough juice under the hood to run these games properly. The next question you should ask yourself is:\n\nHow much power do I need?\n\nThe majority of recently released tablets from Apple and Samsung will be able to stomach running games smoothly from either streaming services or native download. However, if you're going back in time for your purchase you'll want to make sure your device has a good amount of RAM and a fairly new processor under the hood to avoid stutters.\n\nHow much do I want to pay for my screen's refresh rate?\n\nBrands often use the same displays across their devices, but you can often pay a little more for a 120Hz variable refresh rate display. This screen comes packed with an iPad Pro, for instance. That's going to give you top shelf motion handling and make sure all your games are pristine. However, it's a costly affair. At the budget end of the spectrum, we'd recommend making sure you're getting at least a 60Hz refresh rate for a gaming-focused device.\n\nDo I want to stream my games?\n\nIf you want to stream your experiences through Xbox Game Pass or Nvidia you'll need to make sure you've got the internet strength to do so. That stars with the router and internet package that you actually have, but there are ways you can future-proof yourself. You'll want to make sure you're picking up a device with at least WiFi 6E installed. We're also seeing WiFi 7 making its way to more gadgets these days as well.\n\nDo I want to use a wireless controller?\n\nMost tablets will require you to connect your wireless controller via Bluetooth, so you'll need to make sure you're getting a device that can carry high bandwidth Bluetooth signals. These are the minimum for getting a low-latency connection, especially considering 2.4GHz receivers rarely work on mobile.\n\nBest gaming tablet FAQs\n\nWhat size tablet do you need for gaming?\n\nThe best gaming tablets steer away from the smaller 7-inch displays of more entry level devices. That means we'd recommend picking up a screen size of at least 10-inches if you plan on spending a significant amount of time gaming on your tablet.\n\nHow much RAM does a gaming tablet need?\n\nCheaper gaming tablets can ship with as little as 2GB RAM. Because memory is needed far less in a tablet than a laptop or PC, we'd recommend aiming for at least 3GB and hopefully picking up 4GB. Of course, this all depends on your budget, and if you're browsing in the upper echelons of the market you could be offered up to 16GB, though this is only reserved for more specialised devices.\n\nWhich budget tablet is best for gaming?\n\nBudget tablets include the likes of the Samsung Galaxy Tab A7, Amazon Fire tablet, iPad base model, and Lenovo M-series devices. Of these brands, we'd recommend picking up an Amazon Fire HD 10 for an ultra-cheap gaming tablet experience, or upgrading to an entry level iPad for the best value if you're looking to stream and browse the web as well.\n\nWant a bigger screen to game on after all?
