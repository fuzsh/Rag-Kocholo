So I figured out I am still able to throw eggs. You have to click on the player to do so. I love throwing them itâs so funny to me and I like playing with other players that do it too. Makes the game more competitive. Also the avatars that arenât available I wish they would unlock them for use to everyone or remove them altogether. They have some really cool avatars that could be used but for the new players that come through some of them arenât available Iâm guessing because they are old and those events donât exist anymore. I also think they should allow you to create your own chatter phrases along with the ones they give you cause I have a few Iâd like to use ð and Iâm sure other players do too. Or if we could have an option to turn on a chat feature with a microphone during the game with other players to talk to them that would be dope. Otherwise itâs a pretty entertaining game.\n\nIâm a new player and itâs fun so far. I noticed that after the first day of playing I wasnât able to throw eggs at people anymore why? I find that funny and entertaining. Then I like using the emojis to laugh at people during the game play and I got a notice saying I was using the chat too much. Huh? Again why? Thatâs the purpose! You canât do much else so why take away the other fun stuff ð. Are most of the people playing bots? Cause sometimes they take forever to throw out a card. Iâll update in a week or two if I remember.\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nWe're so glad to hear you're still enjoying your experience! Every month we try to release new avatars that can be won through events and we hope you don't miss the next one! We welcome your suggestions for a more sociable experience and will gladly share it with our team for better consideration as well! Thank you!"
