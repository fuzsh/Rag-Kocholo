        "text": "If the game is saving game data via iCloud, the data might have not been deleted when you removed the app from your iOS device.\n\nGo to Settings > General > Usage\n\nThere will be a section called iCloud with a Manage Storage option. Tapping this will load all your data stored on iCloud.\n\nUnder the Documents & Data section, check to see if your game has data saved to iCloud. If it does, simply tap on it and tap on the edit button in the top right hand corner to bring up the Delete prompt.\n\nYou can hide apps from that list by going to iTunes on your computer (you don't have to connect the iPad, just log in to your iTunes account):\n\nClick the iTunes Store button.\n\nThen click on the \"purchased\" link either on the bottom under Features or on the top right under Quick Links (that's for iTunes 11, it's somewhere else on older versions but still easy to find).\n\nFind the app you want to hide, hover your mouse over the icon and an \"x\" will appear in the upper left corner.\n\nClick the \"x\" and the app will be hidden on purchased list on Apple servers.\n\nNow you can check your iPad. Open the App Store, go to Purchased and check if the app is gone. If it's still there you just need to refresh the list. Close the App Store app, double click the home button, press and hold the app icon and close it (the \"-\" button in the upper left corner). Now the purchased list will be refreshed.\n\nDeleting Apps From iPhone\n\nTouch the app and hold your finger down until all the apps start to jiggle. You will see a circled \"x\" in the upper left corner. Tap it to delete an app. When done press the Home button.\n\nYou cannot delete any pre-installed iOS app.\n\nIf there is No 'X' on any apps you have Downloaded... then check in Restrictions... Settings > General > Restrictions > Deleting Apps = Off / On\n\nIf the app is in iTunes, then you delete the app in iTunes (Select the App and Press Delete on your Keyboard). If you then sync with your iDevice, the app will also be deleted from your iDevice."
