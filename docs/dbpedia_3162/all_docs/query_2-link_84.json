Built-in privacy features minimize how much of your information is available to anyone but you, and you can adjust what information is shared and where you share it. Built-in security features help prevent anyone but you from accessing the data on your iPad and in iCloud.\n\nTo take maximum advantage of the privacy and security features built into iPad, follow these practices.\n\nTo get personalized support for these practices, go to the Apple Support website (not available in all countries or regions)."
