        "text": "The popularity of Apple products isn't hidden from anyone. People prefer them for a lot of reasons ranging from top-notch privacy to unique features. The iPad is one of the most advanced Apple products, with a 4K Ultra HD video support that makes it stand out from its competitors. But sometimes, even the iPad fails to play videos and puts users in a tight spot.\n\nIt can be frustrating to sit for hours trying to stream videos on your iPad. But sometimes, due to inexplicable reasons, your iPad won’t play videos on your favorite platform. Well, there’s nothing to worry about. There are multiple easy methods to solve this issue, and up next, we’ll be discussing everything you need to know.\n\nBefore looking at the solutions, let's learn about the reasons behind this problem.\n\nReasons why your iPad won’t play videos\n\n1. Low storage space\n\nYou need to have sufficient memory space on your iPad to live stream high-definition videos or watch/download HD content . If your device is filled with lots of junk files and cached data, naturally, it won't be able to play videos.\n\n2. Unsupported video format\n\nDespite being insanely popular, the Apple iPad supports only a handful of video formats like H.264, MP4, M4V, MOV, MPEG-4, and M-JPEG. Thus, if you transfer a video of any other format to your iPad, it won’t play.\n\n3. Bad network connection\n\nYou might face difficulty in streaming online videos on an iPad due to a poor network connection, especially in the case of cellular data.\n\n4. Background apps\n\nThere could be apps running in the background and interrupting your video player, which can lead to videos not playing on iPad.\n\n5. Outdated software or video player\n\nIf you haven’t updated your iPad’s OS with the latest version, it can cause problems in playing videos. You should also update video apps, like YouTube and iTunes, on your iPad regularly for smooth operation.\n\n6. Apple servers are down\n\nSometimes, the videos stored on iCloud can’t be played on the iPad temporarily because the Apple servers are down and unable to receive your request. In such a situation, it may be best to just wait it out.\n\nAnd now let’s move on to the solutions to fix this issue.\n\nMethods for solving iPad not playing videos\n\n1. Terminate all running apps and restart the iPad\n\nThe first solution is often the simplest – many times, a device starts functioning normally if it is just restarted. Thus, open the multitask display on your iPad and swipe up every app window. Thereafter, reboot your iPad by simultaneously holding down the Sleep and Home buttons until the Apple logo appears.\n\nNote: You can open the multitask display on your iPad with a double-tap on the Home button. Alternatively, you can swipe up from the screen’s bottom and hold down your finger in the middle of the screen until multitask display appears.\n\n2. Check your network and the status of Apple servers\n\nWhen you’re trying to watch videos on iPad through apps like iTunes or iCloud, you should always check if your device’s network is strong enough and if the status of Apple servers on the Apple System Status page is “Available”. On the “Apple System Status” page, you can check if the cloud services provided by the company are running well or not.\n\nIf the Apple servers are working normally, try turning off its cellular data and switching to the Wi-Fi with the below mentioned steps:\n\nManually turn off your iPad’s cellular data.\n\nNow go to the Settings of your iPad.\n\nFrom the menu that is opened, tap on General.\n\nNow tap on Reset to open all the reset options.\n\nSelect the Reset Network Settings option and enter your password.\n\nAt last, wait for your iPad to restart and then connect to a Wi-Fi network.\n\n3. Update apps and iOS\n\nIf videos are not playing on your iPad, there could be a case that you’re using an older version of your video playing apps or an outdated OS on your iPad. Updating all iPad apps and OS will hopefully rid your device of its issues.\n\nHere are the steps to be performed to upgrade your software:\n\nGo to the Settings of your iPad.\n\nTap on the General option.\n\nFrom the list opened, select the Software Update option.\n\nIf there is any update available, you can tap on Download and Install option.\n\nNow, enter the PIN of your device to start the process.\n\nAfter downloading the update, your iPad will restart to install the latest version.\n\nOnce the update has been installed, you should be able to play your videos easily.\n\n4. Factory reset your iPad\n\nNote: This should only be done as a last resort. Please be aware that you may lose some data if you do this.\n\nBy resetting your iPad to its factory settings, you can erase any error or malfunction on the device. But this method will also erase all data on your iPad, including your videos, photos, games, apps, etc. So first, backup everything you need, and for any paid apps, you can re-download them as they are synced with your Apple ID.\n\nAfter backing up essential things, follow the steps below to reset your iPad.\n\nGo to the Settings of your iPad.\n\nTap on the General option.\n\nAt the end of the menu, tap on the Reset option.\n\nFrom the list opened, tap on Reset All Content And Settings\n\nYou have to confirm this option twice to reset your iPad.\n\nWhen prompted, you will have to enter the password of your device.\n\nAfter the process is complete, your iPad will work as new.\n\nThe ultimate solution – what to do if nothing works\n\nThis might sound disheartening, but there is a good chance the video won’t play even after you have tried all these methods. This is an error at the source where the video is hosted. If this is the case, you should download the video on your iPad and then repair it using an advanced video repair solution like Stellar Repair for Video.\n\nPowered by technically superior scanning and repair algorithms, Stellar Repair for Video is a potent solution to fix minor and major damages within video files. It can help you fix 17+ video formats without the need of being a tech-wizard. The software is very easy to use and follows a simple 3-step approach to fix video errors.\n\nHere are the steps you can use to repair the video with Stellar Repair for Video:\n\nGo to the official website of the tool and download its installer. Thereafter, install it with recommended settings\n\nOnce the software is installed, launch the tool.\n\nAt the home screen, click on the Add button to select and import the files you want to repair. Once they have been imported into the interface, click on the Repair button\n\nDepending on the size of the video(s) being repaired and your computer’s processing speed, you will need to wait for the process to complete.\n\nOnce it is done, you can preview the repaired files and then save them to the desired location with the Save Repaired Files button\n\nConclusion\n\nEven though Apple products come with the most secure and reliable technology, it's inevitable to avoid some technical issues in them. You can try the above-mentioned methods to fix issues when your iPad won’t play videos. If you’re still unable to solve this issue, try the ultimate solution mentioned at the end or approach the Technical Support team at an Apple store for help."
