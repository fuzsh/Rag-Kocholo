        "text": "Yes, the following iPhone models are compatible with Coding games, Genius Words, Pretend play, Numbers, Tangram, Monster, Pizza Co., Detective, Reading Adventure and Disney BYJU’S Learning Workbooks.\n\nCompatible models:\n\niPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max\n\niPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro Max\n\niPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus\n\nNot Compatible:\n\niPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max\n\niPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 13 Mini\n\niPhone SE (1-3 Gen)\n\niPhone 11 Series and older\n\nThe minimum iOS version needed is 11.\n\nThe Osmo Reflector for iPad (2021) is required for all iPhone models.\n\nNo iPhone cases are supported at this time.\n\nStay tuned for more games on iPhone.\n\nTo play any Osmo game, you will need:\n\nA compatible device that’s connected to the internet. Osmo works with most iPads and select Amazon Fire tablets. To confirm that your device supports Osmo, please see compatibility models above.\n\nThe appropriate Osmo base and red reflector for your device.\n\nIf you have a compatible Fire tablet, you need an Osmo Fire base & reflector.\n\nIf you have a compatible iPad, you need an Osmo iPad base & reflector.\n\nThe bases and reflectors are NOT interchangeable between iPads and Fire tablets. All Osmo Kits include a base & reflector, and they are also sold as a separate item on our website or Amazon.com.\n\nAt Osmo, we believe in the decades of research that illustrate children learn best from hands-on education. Osmo’s games are geared toward embodied learning, meaning our games teach abstract concepts by connecting them to objects and actions in the physical world. Osmo games promote embodied learning through physical-digital interactions.\n\nOur in-house team of child development researchers work with our designers to make sure every Osmo game reflects the principles of embodied learning. In Coding Awbie, for instance, players learn how to write lines of code by connecting and arranging physical coding blocks. Players of Pizza Co. must make quick calculations with topping and money tiles to deliver yummy pies and correct change to waiting customers. And in Tangram, players think through spatial relations to build increasingly complex shapes from smaller ones.\n\nAt Osmo, we take pride in creating learning games that are at once delightful and designed to grow young minds. We offer games for a wide range of academic subjects, including:\n\nCoding (Coding Awbie, Coding Jam, Coding Duo)\n\nMath (Numbers, Pizza Co.)\n\nDrawing (Monster, Super Studio, Masterpiece)\n\nSpelling (Words)\n\nFundamentals of Physics (Newton)\n\nSpatial relational skills (Tangram)\n\nWorld geography (Detective Agency)\n\nIn addition to teaching traditional subject matter, Osmo games foster social-emotional skills like problem-solving, creativity and perseverance. Every Osmo game requires the player to use reasoning to arrive at the correct answer, or even to chart a new path entirely.\n\nIn Monster, for example, players draw pictures with the Creative Board to shape the story that Mo the Monster is telling on their screen. When kids play Monster together, they learn how to communicate and collaborate in order to progress in the narrative. In this way, Monster is a useful tool for growing interpersonal skills in early childhood.\n\nMost Osmo games are designed for ages 5–12. Monster and Super Studio are appropriate for ages 4+.\n\nFor younger children, we recommend the brand-new Osmo Little Genius Starter Kit, which includes four games designed specifically for kids ages 3–5. These games teach pre-reading, storytelling and fine motor skill development.\n\nThe Osmo Reflector bounces an image of the player’s game piece arrangement or drawing into the device camera. The Osmo app then processes this image and either recreates the image on the screen or translates its effect onto the story in the digital world. Because Osmo uses a covered reflector to only capture images in a bounded area, your child’s privacy is always protected.\n\nFor lost or broken game pieces: We’re happy to replace lost or broken game pieces free of charge, within reason, for the first 90 days. You can request replacement pieces through your myOsmo account by selecting “Replacements” from the dropdown menu and filling out the form. We’ll send an email confirmation once you submit your request, as well as a notification when your replacement ships.\n\nFor a lost or broken red reflector or base: Replacement reflectors and bases are available for purchase in our store."
