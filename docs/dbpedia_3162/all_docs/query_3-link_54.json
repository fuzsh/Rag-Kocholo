        "text": "The iPad is designed to take the tablet experience to the next level. With new releases almost every year, upgrading and replacing an old iPad might not be easy. You may have an older model lying around that you are reluctant to throw away and wonder if it is worth keeping since and the iPad has very high durability. With this spirit, we have curated a list of ten possible ways to repurpose your old iPad, some of which you may not even have thought about.\n\n1 â€“ Mount it on your car\n\nOne of the most valuable features of an old iPad is the camera. If you want to repurpose your old iPad, you can mount the Apple tablet to your dashboard and monitor the traffic while driving. Dashboard cameras have become increasingly popular because users can protect themselves from fraud during traffic incidents. You only need a good amount of storage for your video or a dash camera app.\n\nA second option is to use it as a hub for entertainment and music. Maybe you prefer to have your music library inside the device, or you may mount the iPad so your kids or other companions can watch a movie, play video games, or listen to their favorite songs while you drive.\n\nOr, it can be used as an entertainment/navigation system in the car, and you can mount it near the driverâ€™s seat to access the navigation feature on a big screen.\n\n2 â€“ Turn it into a security camera\n\nIf you can use an old iPad as a dashboard camera for your car, then you can use it as a camera in your home. The most important thing to turning an old iPad into a home security camera is finding a power source and protecting it from natural elements. You will want to avoid other people messing with it too.\n\nConsider running a cable outside and mounting the device under a cover. Then, run a video monitoring app over your Wi-Fi network at all times. To save your security footage in a safe place, you can pay for a cloud storage solution for a monthly subscription or purchase extra storage, along with physical backups.\n\n3 â€“ Use it as a second screen\n\nIf you have a Mac and an iPad running on iPadOS 13 or later, you can use the iPad as a second screen with Appleâ€™s Sidecar. The sidecar can be used wirelessly and accessed by clicking the AirPlay icon in the menu bar on your Mac and selecting your iPad. This will allow you to extend your Macâ€™s screen onto your iPad.\n\nAnother way you can repurpose your old iPad into a monitor is by using a Wi-Fi connection and Appleâ€™s Air Display. It works with a free desktop client (available for both PC and Mac) over a Wi-Fi network to turn your iPad into a second (or third or fourth) monitor. If you are keen on streaming and online gaming, a second or third display using your old iPad could also do wonders when reading the chat or having any other streaming tool at hand for a live video.\n\n4 â€“ Repurpose it as a smart home controller\n\nYou can repurpose an old iPad to function as a Smart Home Controller, making your home more comfortable. Your iPad can serve as a light switch, thermostat, security panel, and TV remote. This way, youâ€™ll be able to jump effortlessly into smart home technology.\n\nYou can control almost anything in your house, provided you download universal remote control apps available on the App Store. All you need is an iPad, a stable Wi-Fi network, and some specially designed hardware that converts Wi-Fi signals into various types of control.\n\n5 â€“ Turn it into a kitchen tablet\n\nAn iPad in the kitchen? Well, we donâ€™t mean to use it as a chopping board, of course. You can repurpose an old iPad as your kitchen companion to show you new recipe books. Itâ€™s a great way for inexperienced cooks to prepare even the most complicated dishes.\n\nTo take care of your iPad, put it in a protective cover or mount it on a wall or a cabinet. Donâ€™t forget to browse and download a cooking app to help elaborate your favorite dish with built-in timers, check conversion charts, and quickly swipe through information without dealing with paper cookbooks or notes.\n\n6 â€“ Make it a digital photo or video frame\n\nRepurposing an old iPad into a digital photo frame is an idea you may not have considered. The Apple tablet can display photos and video clips in a slideshow, so itâ€™s pretty easy. Youâ€™d only need to get an adhesive mount or prop it up, and there are products and accessories for the iPad to hang it on a wall.\n\nThe second thing you need is a way to power it up. For instance, if the tablet is near a computer, you can use its standard USB port. If there isnâ€™t enough distance to do it, use an extension cord. And lastly, you can get an inexpensive USB wall charger if no PC is around.\n\n7 â€“ Make it an e-reader\n\nHow about turning your iPad into an e-reader? With plenty of e-books to choose from in Apple Books, you could easily repurpose your old tablet to browse and access a catalog of endless books you want to read, audiobooks included.\n\nThe good news is that e-books are much more affordable than physical copies, and you can find books that are not available on paper anymore. The iPad can also enhance your experience with features like highlighting, annotations and uploading your favorite passages to the cloud for later reference.\n\nUndoubtedly, it is one of the best uses an old iPad, or any other tablet, could have if you are not using it. Take into consideration that the backlit screen may not be ideal for reading for an extended period. Turn down the brightness to have a more comfortable experience.\n\n8 â€“ Give it to your kids\n\nWith tons and tons of games available for the iPad, children can entertain themselves with an iPad you wonâ€™t use anymore. Not only that, some streaming services offer kid-friendly content to keep your kids engaged with educational and fun content.\n\nAs you may know, Apple has robust parental controls to track how much time the kids spend on the device and restrict the content they can play, watch, or listen to.\n\nðŸ‘‰ Related: 5 Best iPads for Kids in 2024\n\nðŸ‘‰ Learn more: How to Set Up and Use an iPad: A Complete Guide\n\n9 â€“ Use it as a nightstand alarm clock\n\nBreathing new life into your old iPad can be as simple as turning it into a chic nightstand alarm clock. Start by cleaning your iPad and arranging it upright on your nightstand with the aid of a stand or case. Your next task is to choose the perfect clock app. The App Store is abundant with choices like Bedside Clock or Flip Clock that not only serve as alarm clocks but also add stylish displays to your device.\n\nOnce youâ€™ve downloaded your app of choice, tweak the settings to your liking, ensuring that the iPadâ€™s brightness is suitable for nighttime use and that Do Not Disturb is activated. Lastly, keep your iPad plugged in overnight so youâ€™re not greeted with a dead battery come morning.\n\nWith these simple steps, your old iPad gets a second life as a modern, customizable nightstand alarm clock, proving old tech can indeed learn new tricks.\n\n10 â€“ Trade in your old iPad for a new or a refurbished iPad\n\nIf you cannot find a way to repurpose your old iPadâ€”or if we didnâ€™t convince youâ€”then the best option is to trade it for a new or refurbished iPad. You can get great value from your iPad when purchasing a new device by sending it back to the Apple Store.\n\nAppleâ€™s trade-in program lets you trade in your old iPad for credit toward your next purchase. You can also get an Apple Gift Card, which can be used anytime. The model or condition of the iPad doesnâ€™t matter; Apple can still process your trade-in nonetheless.\n\nA trade-in is an excellent way to put your efforts into reducing the overflowing e-waste and boosting the circular economy while getting a fully working product at a discounted price.\n\nYet again, there is another option to repair your iPad if you want to give your device a second life. In this case, consider visiting your nearest repair service provider for professional help.\n\nAnother excellent option is to buy a refurbished device. They all include a warranty, and professionals perform the refurbishing process. You can compare all new and refurbished iPad deals here on RefurbMe. They all have the same functionality as a brand-new product. Keep in mind that the credit of Appleâ€™s trade-in can be used to buy a refurbished product in the Apple Store.\n\nAnd, of course, we can assist you in choosing your next iPad refurbished by Apple or our trusted merchants. See available units in real time below:\n\nLast but not least, Sell Your Mac can assist you with selling your old iPad. They offer a free FedEx shipping label, a 30-day offer guarantee, and a hassle-free selling experience.
