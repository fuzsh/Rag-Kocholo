        "text": "The iPhone and iPad are great gaming devices on their own, but you can transform them into console-like devices with the right accessories. We've gathered the best ones to try.\n\nMany games made for mobile work great with hand-held touch controls, but that isn't always the case. Adding in some dedicated gear for gaming can make a big difference.\n\nStandalone controllers\n\nSony DualSense and Xbox Core\n\nThe best accessory is usually the one you already have. Apple has enabled full compatibility with Xbox 360, Xbox One, Playstation 4, and PlayStation 5 game controllers.\n\nApple has even baked in compatibility with many of Sony's DualSense functions like advanced haptics, adaptive triggers, and the touch pad. Developers have to enable these features in the games, but the option does exist. However, you're more likely to take advantage of this when using PS5 remote play.\n\nAny modern Xbox controller with Bluetooth will work great with your Apple devices. The most recent Xbox Core controller is the best option for compatibility and battery life.\n\nBoth the Xbox Core and Sony DualSense come in various colors and charge via USB-C. Sony's use of LEDs and other functions make its battery last only about 12 hours on a single charge. Xbox Core's battery is rated for 40 hours, so it is likely the better choice for mobile gaming.\n\nWe wouldn't recommend buying the older Xbox and Playstation controllers new, but you can score a bargain on them depending on where you look.\n\nXbox Adaptive Controller\n\nThe single best option for gaming accessibility is the Xbox Adaptive Controller. Microsoft designed the Adaptive Controller with an extensive range of customization for anyone with limited mobility.\n\nThe base device acts as a basic controller on its own, but there are ways to connect various assistive devices, joysticks, buttons, and other items to fit any need. This controller is fully compatible with games built for iPhone and iPad and connects via Bluetooth or USB-C.\n\nGameSir\n\nMany third-party gaming companies make controllers that fit any budget, but we're here to discuss the best options for your money. If you don't have an Xbox or PlayStation controller handy, the next best thing is a controller from GameSir.\n\nThese controllers are great companions to your iPhone and iPad thanks to their comfortable design, 8- to 10-hour battery life, and wide range of compatibility. They are made from translucent plastic, have turbo modes, customizable LEDs, and the T4 Pro has additional customizable triggers.\n\nThe GameSir T4 Pro also has an optional iPhone mount that makes your iPhone float above the controller when used. There's more on controller mounts later.\n\nYou can't beat these controllers for the price, especially when compared to the Sony DualSense, which is nearly twice as much. They are also frequently on sale for as much as 50% off.\n\nAttached controllers\n\nUsing a standalone controller isn't always ideal, especially for mobile products. So, the alternative is to make the accessory attach directly to your iPhone.\n\nSadly, there aren't any iPad-attached controllers in recent generations, so this category is primarily for iPhones. There are multiple methods for connecting your iPhone and controller, but it depends on the use case and personal preference.\n\nBackbone One\n\nThe Backbone One refined an existing idea of having a large clamping mechanism place controllers on either side of the iPhone. The final result is a Nintendo Switch-like handheld with a physically attached controller connected via the Lightning port.\n\nSince it connects via Lightning, there's no need to charge the controller either, and there's passthrough charging. The Lightning port also acts as a wired connection to PC and Mac, so it doubles as a standalone controller without an iPhone inserted.\n\nThe iPhone 13 Pro Max has a substantial camera bump, so a 3D printed accessory is needed for your iPhone to fit. It is a free accessory that can be ordered from Backbone. We hope a future model will account for Apple's ever-increasing camera bump.\n\nRiotPWR\n\nThe RiotPWR ESL game controller has a built-in mount for iPhone and connects via Lightning. The cable is extra long, and the iPhone mount is removable, so it also works well wired to Lightning-based iPads.\n\nThe controller is a good weight, so it doesn't feel too heavy even with an iPhone set in the mount. Also, the mount is secure and doesn't feel like your device could fall out at an odd angle.\n\nThere is a built-in headphone jack so you can wire in for audio without lag. There is also a Lightning port for passthrough charging of your iPhone.\n\nController mounts\n\nRather than buy an entire controller with a dedicated mount, you can add a mount to your existing Playstation or Xbox controller. It achieves the same result as the built-in mount in the RiotPWR controller and the optional attachment in the GameSir T4 Pro.\n\nThis is by far the cheapest option if you already have a controller handy to take advantage of.\n\nCases and stands\n\nThis section covers iPad-specific accessories. While you could place your iPhone into a stand or use a case with a kickstand, it isn't ideal, and we'd recommend using the previously mentioned attached controller methods.\n\nPair these accessories with a standalone controller mentioned above for the ultimate portable gaming station.\n\niPad Stands\n\nGet your iPad up where you can see it with a good stand that transforms it into a tiny monitor. Different stands achieve different goals.\n\nFolding stands are useful for getting the iPad in the perfect position for certain game types. While these can be used with controllers, they can also be folded down to a prone position so that the iPad can be used for tap-heavy games like rhythm games.\n\niPad Cases\n\nIf you want something more versatile than a stationary stand, get a good iPad case. Folio cases are excellent for propping the iPad up vertically for controller play or lying down at a slant for tapping play.\n\nChoosing what's best\n\nChoosing the right accessories comes down to budget and personal preference. There's no ceiling to how complex you can get with your iPhone or iPad gaming setup."
