        "text": "Reviewed on: PSP\n\nThe Good: Unseen flashback missions are interesting. Stays true to Splinter Cell style. Ambience and voice acting are superb.\n\nThe Bad: An unfortunately high number of glitches and mistakes. Rehashes of old missions aren't all that appealing. No multiplayer in infrastructure mode.\n\nThe Verdict: Sam Fisher makes an average debut on the PSP.\n\nstyle=\"list-style: none\">\n\nREVIEW:\n\nFor Sam Fisher and Ubisoft's Splinter Cell series, this is a first. Both the publisher and one of its flagship franchises grace Sony's PSP for the first time. Indeed, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Essentials is the first PSP game developed exclusively in Ubisoft's famed Montreal studio, and it was more of a challenge than they expected.\n\nBut Splinter Cell Essentials also comes at a time where it precedes the next console and PC chapter in the series, Double Agent, by about six months (it was also originally scheduled for the spring). Shying away from developing a brand new storyline with geopolitical implications, Essentials is more of a personal take on Sam Fisher, by starting things off where Double Agent will ultimately end - with him being arrested by the NSA.\n\nThe gist of the game is actually more flashback than anything else. The first mission, for instance, takes us back to when Sam was a Navy SEAL in Colombia circa-1992, where he must enter a rebel camp of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) to break Douglas Shetland out of a prison cell. Shetland, as SC fans might recall, was a staple of previous SC games.\n\nOther missions from Fisher's past include a stop in Belgrade where you have to take out missiles targeting NATO planes during the bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, along with stops in Indiana, New Orleans and NSA headquarters in Maryland. There's even a mission in a federal penitentiary where Sam has to break a known terrorist out of prison. The brief stint in New Orleans would be terribly disinteresting if not for the shocking encounter with Sam's handler, Lambert.\n\nThen there are missions that are rehashes of older ones, like the Oil Rig in the original and the Manhattan penthouse from Chaos Theory. The layouts of these two missions are neither quite the same, nor as expansive as they were in their previous incarnations, which makes their inclusion a little odd for someone like myself who values continuity.\n\nThe control scheme was likely a challenge for the developers given the absence of a second analogue stick, but the default setting works pretty well most of the time anyway. A majority of the moves Sam can pull off in the three console iterations are also part of his repertoire in Essentials. Some may seldom be used (though this does also depend on your style of play), whereas others are crucial. Either way, you should be able to find a balance in comfort.\n\nThe aesthetics and sounds certainly aren't as captivating as the console versions were, but they are good nonetheless. The difficulty here seems to have been in rendering darkened areas, since pitch black corners and some relatively darkened areas offer the same amount of shadow cover for Sam. Part of that is likely to make the game a little easier, even though the AI has taken a bit of a hit too.\n\nAs intriguing and appealing as Essentials seems to be, it's held down by a number of unusual - and in some cases - baffling issues. The standout in all this has to be in the Oil Rig mission where I managed to follow the technician and another guard into the same room in full view of both men. Instead of attacking me, they just strolled right past me and into a neighbouring room. Then there was a sequence in another mission in which I had taken out one guard while alerting another. The second guard stood fast and wanted to fire, but after managing to take a few steps into a shadow right in his field of view, he eventually just went back to his patrol route completely disregarding the body on the ground.\n\nWhether these are glitches or just consequences of very dumbed-down AI is difficult to ascertain. But the misspellings in some of the dialogue suggest that development may have been rushed just a little bit.\n\nClipping is an issue that crops up often as well. One of the best ways to hide a body was to dump it in front of a wall because of how it would fall right through, exposing only the legs or ankles. There were also times where I could see who or what was in an adjacent room just by moving close to the wall and panning the camera right or left.\n\nThe multiplayer is a mixed bag in the sense that what's available is nice, but is still limited to ad hoc mode. So you'll get some good head-to-head deathmatches, but the novelty starts to wear off.\n\nThere are also three bonus missions that have been included, all of which are from the second SC title, Pandora Tomorrow. The classic train mission from that game is among the trio offered.\n\nEssentials tells a good story by acting as a complement to the previous SC titles, but it comes across as a rushed job in other aspects. By no means does it make the game a complete disappointment, but rather a bit of shame since it could've been that much better."
