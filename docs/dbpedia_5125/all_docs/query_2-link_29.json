        "text": "Line of select Xbox games\n\nThis article is about Xbox games. For The Platinum Range, see Essentials (PlayStation). For other uses, see Platinum Hits (disambiguation).\n\nPlatinum Hits is a term used to refer to a line of select Xbox games that were considered by Microsoft to have sold considerable units on the platform in the nine months after release,[1] and have dropped in price from their original MSRP to a newer, lower price, generally that of $19.99,[2] although multi-game packs may sell for more. A similar budget range in PAL markets is known as Xbox Classics for £19.99 and Best of Classics for £9.99. In Japan, they are known as Platinum Collection games and generally cost ¥2,800, with certain games such as Grand Theft Auto IV and Dynasty Warriors 6 at a higher price point of ¥3,800. Sales requirements may vary by region.\n\nOn September 8, 2006, Microsoft announced the Platinum Collection would be extended to the Xbox 360 platform.[3] On September 20, 2006, at Microsoft's Pre-Tokyo Game Show conference, they announced Platinum Hits for the Xbox 360 in North America, priced at $29.99 and Classics in the UK for £24.99.[4] A second wave of titles was released in early 2007, with additional games being added periodically.[5]\n\nPlatinum Family Hits are special Platinum Hits that have been designated appropriate for all ages. All current Platinum Family Hits are rated \"E\" by the ESRB, except for T-rated X-Men Legends and four E10+ rated games -- Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic Unleashed, Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy and Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts. Not all Platinum Hits offerings that receive an E rating are labeled with the Family Hits designation, however. As with Platinum Hits, the new suggested retail (MSRP) is $19.99.\n\nBest of Platinum Hits are select best-selling Platinum Hits that have a suggested retail price of $9.99 and a slightly different \"Best of Platinum Hits\" logo on the package design. Best of Platinum Family Hits are chosen from the Platinum Family Hits line.\n\nOriginal Xbox\n\n[edit]\n\nGames in Platinum Hits series\n\n[edit]\n\nGames in Best of Platinum Hits series\n\n[edit]\n\nGames in Platinum Family Hits series\n\n[edit]\n\nGames in Best of Platinum Family Hits series\n\n[edit]\n\nMadagascar\n\nShrek 2\n\nThe Sims\n\nGames in Classics series (132)\n\n[edit]\n\nGames in Best of Classics series (11)\n\n[edit]\n\nGames in Platinum Collection series\n\n[edit]\n\nXbox 360\n\n[edit]\n\nGames in Xbox 360 Platinum Hits (NTSC)\n\n[edit]\n\nGames in Xbox 360 Classics (PAL)\n\n[edit]\n\nGames in Xbox 360 Platinum Collection (NTSC[J])\n\n[edit]\n\nXbox One\n\n[edit]\n\nGames in Greatest Hits for Xbox One series\n\n[edit]\n\nAssassin's Creed IV Black Flag\n\nAssassin's Creed Brotherhood\n\nAssassin's Creed Unity\n\nAssassin's Creed Syndicate\n\nBioshock: The Collection\n\nBorderlands: The Handsome Collection\n\nBully\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered\n\nThe Crew\n\nTom Clancy's The Division\n\nDead Rising 3\n\nDishonored 2\n\nDoom\n\nThe Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion\n\nFar Cry 3\n\nFar Cry 4\n\nForza Horizon 2\n\nForza Motorsport 5\n\nForza Motorsport 6\n\nGears of War: Ultimate Edition\n\nHalo: The Master Chief Collection\n\nHalo 5: Guardians\n\nKiller Instinct\n\nKinect Sports Rivals\n\nNBA 2K20\n\nNeed for Speed Rivals\n\nRayman Legends\n\nRayman Origins\n\nRise of the Tomb Raider\n\nRyse: Son of Rome\n\nSunset Overdrive\n\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege\n\nWatch Dogs\n\nWolfenstein: The New Order\n\nZoo Tycoon\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of Xbox games\n\nList of Xbox 360 games\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
