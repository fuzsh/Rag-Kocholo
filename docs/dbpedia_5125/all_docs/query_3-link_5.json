You and I do not have this freedom. If ever we decided to put it into practice, we'd go to jail and be called murderous bastards. Essentially, the fifth freedom grants Sam a license to do whatever it takes to accomplish his mission, whether that means destroying a television to darken an already dark rundown apartment, cracking into some chump's personal computer system, or slaughtering about fifty Georgian cops. And to think, we always thought our four freedoms was plenty.\n\nThe NSA's ultra covert, super high-tech, answering to a very select few \"brass\" Third Echelon branch calls an aging, battle hardened but still miraculously prime Sam into action for what is initially planned to be a simple rescue mission and intelligence gathering op. It all goes to hell as he starts sending everyone to hell. Believe me, there's going to be quite a line at Lucifer's doorstep by the time this game is finished.\n\nAs tough as he is, Sam's no brain-dead, pick up a big gun and fight the entire Soviet Union like a moron, Rambo. No, he's part of a Splinter Cell. These tightly knit groups of three to four agents with one field operative are the ultimate covert answer to the world's ultimate problems, like a power hungry Georgian president and a whole lot of conspiracy badness.\n\nTrue to conventional American policy, if someone were to capture this patriotic, all nine yards or nothing hero while he was partaking in atrocious means to reach a justified end the United States government would promptly disavow any knowledge of his existence in pretty and jargon ridden language. It's like James Bond's license to kill, but with an extra dash of ruthlessness because Sam Fisher is played by Michael Ironside and thus infinitely cooler (no pretty bitch-boy here). Besides, it's fairly obvious why the captain of the Sea Quest would be disavowed by his government if ever he were caught. They fought a giant alligator and Trident, God of the sea, for Christ's sake.\n\nAs an operative of this Third Echelon, and in keeping with its principles of don't ask, don't tell, and you're not ever going to hear anything from us, Sam is only given the information he needs when he needs it. As him, gamers are actually uncovering facts and plot twists as they progress through Splinter Cell. The first mission in Splinter Cell begins innocently enough. Just jump in a plane and head to Georgia (the republic, not the US state, though it too might be in need of a good cleansing -- I don't know). The job: investigate the disappearance of two CIA agents. One had infiltrated the Georgian government before disappearing (she \"donated\" her way into a solid position), and the other disappeared while investigating the disappearance of the first. Sam Fisher is sent in because the NSA has eyes and common sense -- they know he's the ultimate badass and won't be disappearing on anybody, ever. From this simple beginning, players quickly uncover facts and scandals and unravel a storyline that carts the game all over the globe -- including a mission through CIA headquarters in Virginia -- to find the information necessary to prevent World War III.\n\nIn common Clancy style, the end results of successful missions are presented through the filter of a 24 hour news network. Clips of the anchorman's top stories, involving apprehended terrorists and narrowly avoided disasters, may be attributed to local authorities, but Sam's the man behind the big flimflam.\n\nThe TV news bits provide a nice overview of the story, but you are the one actually interrogating people, eavesdropping on conversations and intercepting critical email messages and radio transmissions. Grounded to the core, it's all portrayed in a very believable, real-world context. So when you figure out that the evil Chinese general and the eviler Russian mobster are in cahoots (like that was hard to spot), nobody actually says \"You, General Xia and I, Mr Grinko, will come together to rule the world\" like it's some kind of inane comic book. Instead, Sam overhears one half of a phone conversation where plans are being discussed. Third Echelon briefs Sam on the next mission that unravels a bit more. The news reporter mentions something that piques curiosity. And you, well you put it all together one awesome piece at a time.\n\nThe game always breakdowns and presents important information by way of briefings from Third Echelon headquarters, so what's going on is always known, but the savvy Splinter Cell player who really wants to get into the meat of the game has to not only pay attention to what's being said but also to what's not being said, what was said, what's being read, and what's happening. In this way, Splinter Cell remains linear without feeling seriously confined or hampered by an obvious or obnoxious storyline. Yes the world is in danger and needs to be saved, but the who, what and why unfold with the game and not in brief, self-explanatory monologues at the last five minutes, or worse, because the big evil guy lives in a giant volcano that looks like a cobra and has an unnecessarily elaborate super weapon mounted to the top of it.\n\nNow that you know the general Splinter Cell, prepare to know the specific PC version.\n\nFirst of all, digital works damn well. Aside from aesthetic faithfulness, the biggest concern I and every other PC gamer on the face of Mother Earth had with this, the proposed port of Splinter Cell, was how the control, driven by careful analog movement on the Xbox, would be translated to a cumbersome, painfully digital keyboard. Switching pace from fast to slow to crawl in smooth thumb movements is practically what the game is all about, after all. Well, have no fears (you can even put those ones about making a laughably nude appearance in math class and being cocooned by a swarm of ravenous giant spiders to rest), Splinter Cell PC not only retains all of the functionality of the Xbox original, but actually improves upon it all in every single way, except for one.\n\nThe most notable and outright apparent improvement to control is the use of a mouse in place of the always dreaded right analog thumb stick we're all so terribly accustomed to in console shooters of any type. Not only is the more precise, fluid movement of the mouse an infinitely more pleasant, natural experience, it actually manages to expand and improve gameplay in a number of different ways, most obvious is aim. Shooting a light means hitting a light the first time out. With the Xbox original, I distinctly and sorrily recall having to fire three to six rounds at smaller bulbs from greater distances to get a clean shatter. Not so here, where aiming and firing are more forgiving and intuitive actions.\n\nNot so obvious is the improvement to the whole that comes from being able to quickly identify Sam's relative position to his surroundings and the inhabitants that populate them. What was once accomplished by awkwardly swinging about in slow, sometimes jerky movements, is now second nature thanks to the little mouse that could -- it's the same one we often take for granted in many of our games. Pet it. Love it. Cuddle it. Hearing astonishingly recreated and accurately positioned footsteps thanks to a little EAX HD magic and high quality virtualization (assuming you have the internal and external hardware that supports it all) and then immediately pinpointing their origins in half a second and being able to react without hesitation or peripheral caused delay is a simple kind of brilliance I now just can't do without.\n\nPicking up the sleek Controller S of the X suddenly feels like trying to play the game by grabbing a dog with my feet and forcing it to mash the buttons for me. Contrary to what some and some's logic might have you believe, it's ultimately the clumsy, entirely digital keyboard and odd, \"unimmersive\" mouse combination that make Splinter Cell play more like our dreams told us it would play. Exactly the opposite of our fears, it's the classic, accepted gamepad that \"pilots\" Sam around like a stiff robot opposed to navigating him about environments in the way humans in games should be navigated. You'll never go back once you've swung the mouse about to see what lies behind a corner or under a balcony. It's that good.\n\nThe third improvement, sit down if you're standing and stand up if you're sitting because this is a crazy one, is how well the mouse wheel controls speed. Better than before? Do I need a beating or possibly a killing? Heck no! Turn that wheel up a notch and whenever you hit W or Up Arrow or Keypad 8, or whatever the hell you have your movement keys bound to, Sam will move at a faster rate than before. It's broken down digitally (think 1/4 speed, 1/2 speed, 3/4 speed, and full speed), and it works marvelously because it frees up that huge section of our brain from having to continually focus on and mind the way in which we're titling the thumb pad. Am I moving too fast? Am I moving too slow? This suck. Not anymore. A few rolls back and suddenly Sam's crawling. Four rolls forward and he's sprinting across a field. It's possible to tell in an instant whether or not the rate Fisher's traveling at is the one that will or won't get him discovered. But, for as much as this clever redesign helps the game on a whole, it does create two nuisances.\n\nProblem number one comes with jumping. Since Splinter Cell jumps are directly proportionate to the rate at which the character moves, it becomes critical to slide that wheel up to the maximum if you want enough lift to reach that ledge, that rope, that pitiful dude's throat. It seems like a simple thing, but you'll find that practically four out of the five times Sam meets death or broken legs from long falls are due in no small part to forgetting to increase speed in preparation for a jump. I died six times in one area because I was too stupid to realize I was walking when I needed to be running.\n\nThe second nuisance is directly related to the often overlooked crouch roll, which I've found to be a totally vital component of play. Like the jump, the crouch roll is dependent on speed. Unlike the jump, players absolutely must be traveling at the maximum rate else Sam will not roll, which can be disastrous in certain circumstances. Again, simply remembering, something my tattered and drug beaten brain has little fondness of, is critical to having a not so infuriating experience.\n\nGranted, making proper use of a variety of keys, in sequence and simultaneously, starts out as being a burden, but as soon as the control scheme is mastered, in probably the first 10 to 20 minutes or so, it all becomes second nature. Close your eyes and imagine playing Splinter Cell. Given the choice between the two available versions or any following console iteration, for that matter, ours is easily preferred. Odd then that I don't think it to be an above perfect 10.5, no?\n\nHere it is plain and simple, while the Xbox offered exactly zero the way of competition, Splinter Cell on the PC finds itself fighting for dominance in a market that has seen quite literally the best stealth action titles around.\n\nPlayed Deus Ex, Thief or Metal Gear recently? Though remarkably different in concept and delivery, the first game on that short list of examples arguably provided everything Splinter Cell does, only with a thousand times more. Where Splinter Cell is majorly linear and entirely pass/fail, Deus Ex is freeform, open, approachable, and inviting. Even Thief is but a technology backward, brutally medieval version of the same principle. But, while disregarding the competition, I still see shortcomings in Ubi's opus.\n\nAs I touched on, harsh linearity can bug, quite a lot. Instead of being dropped in a locale and ordered to do \"this,\" a task he can accomplish in thirty different ways, Sam's dropped in a locale and ordered to do \"this,\" a task he can only really do in one way. But are straight lines really all that bad?\n\nThe key to Splinter Cell's success is that every single element of the game -- including the story, graphics, sound and every minor detail in-between -- is designed to focus the attention of players on the theme of espionage. You are a highly trained operative and you are supposed to think like one. Even with all of the awesome weaponry and gadgetry you'll have at your disposal, your own mind is the most important piece of equipment in Splinter Cell and this is reinforced throughout the game. Few titles have been this successful at immersing the player into such a well designed simulation and maintaining this pervasive feeling of being the part instead of playing the part.\n\nStealth-based third-person games like this began with Metal Gear way the hell back in the day, but Splinter Cell represents the most recent and decent evolution of the type. Unlike many other third-person titles where a one-man army on the warpath is all that's needed (God bless you, Kyle Katarn), Sam is not equipped to stack up hundreds of bodies and laugh while lighting a cigar. This doesn't mean that you can't mix it up with some fine displays of marksmanship, firepower, and elbow force, but it definitely is not the focus of the game...definitely. Sam is on the hunt for tightly guarded information and evidence, so the control, his equipment, and even the levels, are all designed around getting him into, through, and out of places he's not even supposed to be close to. All the while, each facet of the greater game simply works by allowing players to handle any unforeseen problems that could and do jeopardize the mission.\n\nSam begins most missions on the perimeter of his objective with a specific primary task at hand and an entire level of enemies and other characters waiting for him. As you proceed through a mission, your goal is to disturb those characters as little as possible and if you do have to alert them, make sure it's on your terms so you can control the situation at all times. Understanding this is understanding Splinter Cell, because losing control of the situation usually means a sudden death for Samwise, thanks to the good old one-shot one-kills these Tom Clancy games are known for. This is not to say you can't just go ahead and put down every last human, because you can (most of the time), it's just to say the killing and unconscious making must be done very carefully. And this is where the most simplistic and at the same time most wonderfully charming and beautiful aspect of Splinter Cell shines through...\n\nIt's not really a traditional action game at all!\n\nSplinter Cell is a sort of puzzle title enveloped in an enormous mystery, and mystery is what makes life worth living. It's about exploring your environments and searching for clues without ever having to do any conventional, tedious exploration in the Tomb Raider sense. It's pausing at every corner, looking at every pipe, checking out every computer, and all the time wondering how those two men, who might as well be the equivalent of push blocks in lesser games, can be bypassed or overcome without showing a glimpse of yourself to anyone. It's brilliant, complex, and at the same time manageable. It's one giant, moving, changing, interactive, dynamic puzzle.\n\nEnemies react to Sam's gunfire, noises he creates, his shadow, bodies he leaves behind, and whether or not he leaves the toilet seat up. A guard spotting a shadow or a glimpse of Sam as he ducks in and out of dark places will merely become curious and begin investigating the area in question. More severe actions like gunfire or a clear look at Sam will cause them to draw their weapons, sound alarms, and/or notify other guards nearby. Plenty of leeway is given. The instant alarms of SoF 2 are a thing of the past. Like Metal Gear Solid 2, enemies will mutter to themselves about losing their minds or seeing things when a quick investigation turns up nothing. Unlike MGS2, however, alarmed enemies don't simply give up and meander away after being shot. The difference between the state of alarms and what you can get away with is extremely important because you can use this to your advantage by throwing cans and bottles to create distractions. Plus you're always given an unmistakable bass note audio cue whenever you've done something to alarm an enemy. Knowing the enemy and their tendencies sounds like something real secret operatives would have to do, and I'm happily sold on its application in Splinter Cell.\n\nYou also have to worry about plenty of pesky cameras. Listening for their distinct beeping as you move into new areas can mean the difference between success and failure. Some cameras can be disabled with a well placed bullet, others are in bulletproof housing and simply have to be avoided if you don't want packs of guards swarming you in a matter of seconds. But seeing a camera is not being defeated by one. In addition to the \"Hulk smash\" ideology to bypassing them, it's also possible to employ fangled gadgetry, skillful maneuvering (this is where the fast crouch roll comes in super-handy), and the environment to your advantage. But still it leaves me wondering, if all these cameras exist, shouldn't they all point to a central control room and if so, why can't I merely breach that point and terminate the sad lives of its operators to grant myself a clear path? This is an example of the kind of approachability Splinter Cell lacks. There are awesome problems, but most are solvable only by standard methods.\n\nThankfully, Sam has more moves available to him than your typical ninja and mastery over every single one of them, with the notable exception of the Van Damme split jump, is required. Moves to keep Fisher quiet and undetectable as well as moves to get him up, over and through difficult obstacles are all at your fingertips and the game has a required tutorial to get you familiar with most of them (attained levels are permanently unlocked and selectable in a menu, so you never have to play the tutorial again if you don't want to). The problem is that jumping and mantling in any capacity feels stiff and awkward, odd considering how fluid casual movement and other animations are. For instance, Sam will float through the air, clumsily propel himself off one wall and reach for another in a very distracting out of place movement. These types of platforming elements are thankfully fairly scarce, and when implemented, build off of the solid level design enough to make themselves relatively unobtrusive.\n\nWhen it is time to shoot, switching to a hybrid over-the-shoulder first person perspective and dealing with your accuracy meter as you move the reticle means instantly switching the Sam mindset from stealth mode into combat mode. This isn't as easy as you'd think, and it's an intentional move by the developers to stick to the spirit of the game: stealth. You can still move and aim when you draw your weapon, but it's all much slower for the sake of maximizing your accuracy, just like you'd have to do in real life. Besides, you will end up shooting more lights and cameras than enemies in Splinter Cell, and they make for pretty easy targets. If that doesn't convince you that this is a stealth game, nothing will.\n\nGetting physical with bullets and elbows and advanced maneuvers like taking human shields, while always interacting with or just plain stalking the various characters of the game is one of the highlights of Splinter Cell and one of the things that will really make you feel like the invisible, invincible super agent you are (even if you can't grapple enemies that are facing you). Then you get to whip out the assortment of functional gadgets and use them to manipulate your environment. It all adds up and creates that real, empowering draw the title effortlessly possesses.\n\nBut it's not perfect, little things like the fruity jump, some collision detection issues, and noticeable AI inconsistencies jar a stellar experience out of its bid for all time supremacy. Since I'm a fan of the fleet of foot and don't mind having to walk ten feet around the occasional tree QA forgot to test to circumvent the invisible barrier of all stopping doom, my biggest gripe is with the sometimes bafflingly stupid artificial intelligence.\n\nI can come to grips with the fact that citizens, in classic scripted fashion, walk in short patrols around their balconies and streets, and I can even understand how an enemy who hears footsteps from below him would immediately think enemy instead of friend, but what I can't dig is how I can break up a conversation two people are having by clasping one's throat and dragging him away while the other continues to speak and then just stands there in awe, completely content with the fact that his best friend Charlie who was just telling him about his day a moment ago has abruptly disappeared. \"Well, I know the CIA is on high alert after all of these terrorist attacks on our homeland, but I don't think it's odd that three of the other guards that were patrolling this main hall suddenly disappeared while I had my back turned for four seconds. Nah, all must be well.\"\n\nThose shortcomings (and the fact that we still have no System Shock 2 or even SiN terminal interaction) prevent perfection, especially here on the PC where we've already enjoyed the bliss of stealth mixed with the lasting appeal of a grand RPG. But does that mean the game sucks? Hell no. I can handle shortcomings without a barrage of faults so long as the base is solid. Boy howdy is this base ever solid...and pretty.\n\nIs it hypocritical to say after decades of pontification on how graphics aren't everything and the height of gameplay came with Bionic Commando that graphics are pretty much everything here? Not when the graphics are directly related to play, believability, immersion, suspense, and wonder.\n\nThis may be a singleplayer game, but the light of Splinter Cell is the second most important character aside from Sam Fisher. The lighting of each level gives it its personality and shapes the challenges that you're going to face. The one overwhelming instinct you'll have early on is the desire for darkness and quiet. The game becomes more difficult because it becomes tougher to find, create, and maintain the darkness you desire as you face less hospitable places and more characters looking for you.\n\nIf you didn't know already (that paragraph above can be misleading to the blind), Splinter Cell has some of the most impressive lighting effects which make for some of the most impressive characters and impressive environments around.\n\nThe lighting in Splinter Cell, as we said, isn't just some effect where you have a lamp in a room but that room itself is actually lit by some mysterious, inalterable off camera source. Ubi Soft Montreal has simulated the behavior of light to the point where everything is self-shadowing, and the only way you're able to see what's going on in the game is because of a light giving device in the current scene. Whether it's overhead halogens, a bank of monitors, or the glow of a brilliant full moon, you'll always know where light is shining from and so you'll be able to anticipate where and how shadows will fall and which ones need to be shot out. The developers even simulated the different shines you get from banks of several halogens versus the harsh lighting from a single exposed light bulb in a dingy hallway. Light shines through trees, latticework and even chain-link fences and falls on whatever may be on the other side. So when Sam is facing a giant glowing billboard whilst hanging from a chain-link fence, the fence will cast a network of shadows on him with the glow of the billboard lighting the negative spaces, provided your video card can muster such things.\n\nShooting out lights is nothing new in videogames, but it's still rarely done and, aside from Thief and Aliens vs. Predator (assuming you weren't a marine) has never been as functional as it is in Splinter Cell. Shooting out every light in a hallway will create total darkness to the point that your monitor will have nothing on it beyond the HUD (which I still wish had a transparency slider option, for I find it to be a bit too obstructing) and the slight green glow of Sam's goggles and secure radio.\n\nIn such scenarios, enemies will be completely blind and will walk with their hands out in front of them as they search for either a light switch (which they strangely go out of their way to do even if the darkened room is not in their general patrol route) or Sam, if they've been alarmed. Nightvision goggles will give you a huge advantage in the dark, but as you continue through a level and encounter new areas that aren't in total darkness, the lack of color in the nighvision display (everything is a shade of pea-green and then a strange shade of gray as the game progresses) can suddenly work against you if you're not keeping one eye on your stealth meter. Again, the realities of the \"tradecraft,\" at least as we imagine it, are well represented, except for the practically useless thermal display that has poor range and an even poorer ability of seeing through anything worth seeing through, like a damn wall or door. Hell yeah you can see through curtains, though.\n\nIn later levels the subtleties of orange lights in the Georgian Presidential Palace or bright neon signs on far off buildings around the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar cast just enough light on Sam to barely make him visible, except for the giant, inconspicuous green bulbs on his goggles and back that no one seems capable of recognizing. This is compared to the abandoned dummy high-tech company, where the skeleton staff means the majority of the building is dark. But there's all kinds of light in certain areas where workers are still buzzing about. You have to pay attention to the lighting situation at all times so you can come up with your on-the-fly plan of attack. To increase difficulty as you proceed from mission to mission, the game simply makes some situations more annoying than others (those orange lights are no fun), but you always have the tools you'll need to get by. It's really up to you to figure out your own way through the game, which means go slow and keep your eyes open.\n\nIn Splinter Cell, you're more or less dropped into a situation with a specific set of equipment and given an initial objective. Other than this, you have to learn to use your noodle to figure out what's expected of you. You're given a limited amount of ammunition and other goodies like grenades, sticky cameras and smoke bombs. However, you're never given clues or prompts as to when or where you're supposed to use these items. Unlike EA's recent James Bond games, there's no flashing icon or obvious camera zoom during a mission fly-by to point out what you need to do. And this is what masks Splinter Cell's linearity and makes moving on that straight line I mentioned earlier so enjoyable. It's the puzzle game for the smart man. There is no directional pointer and aside from a few blatant, \"you can do this, too\" situations, progress is entirely left up to the player, but directed in such a way that unless you overlook the obvious, you'll proceed.\n\nAs a negative, it can be very trial and error intensive if you mistakenly choose to take the game as an action title rather than a puzzler. Patience above all. Learn Fisher's many abilities and use all of them all of the time. You are never penalized for patience, so if you don't see sauntering guards in a corridor beyond a door at first glance with the fiber optic cable, wait a minute or two. Infinite quicksaves and quickloads are provided, as are considerate automatically saved checkpoints (the same kind we saw in the Xbox version) and all saving and loading is fast, very fast, so redoing certain areas when necessary is never aggravating, assuming you don't copout and endlessly rush headlong into a room of certain death just to see where certain death will be coming from so that the next time through you can die a little slower.\n\nThough we've mentioned how important and amazing a role sound and graphics play on the actual game, we must give way to practicality, but not without first reiterating just how cool it can all potentially be.\n\nSam Fisher himself is rendered beautifully even though his suit is stealth black from top to bottom. When you take the time to look, you can see his equipment straps and pouches drawn in exquisite detail right down to the snaps and buckles. Throughout the game you'll even notice Sam change into his short sleeved temperature controlled suit when he's in the tropical climate of Myanmar. On the last mission he dons a ski-mask that only leaves the eyes exposed. When he flips down his goggles, he's the spitting image of GI Joe's Snake Eyes.\n\nSam's lips move when he interrogates people or talks to Lambert, and you can even notice emotions creeping across his face if the camera is in the right position, but it's not the kind of facial animation and articulation that will make NOLF 2 blush any time soon. But enemies speak and emote just as well, albeit not as often, as our hero. The movements of enemies tend to be noticeably stiffer than Sam Fisher's but they're still intricate and believable. An enemy investigating an area will lean forward with his rifle raised and creep slowly as opposed to strolling along confidently when they're not in alert mode. When you die you often get a glimpse of them turning their heads to speak into their shoulder-mounted radios to report the American spy they've just waxed.\n\nSam himself moves with more stealth and cunning than videogame protagonists you'll ever see. When he skulks along in crouch mode, the engine is sophisticated enough that he appears to be timing his steps and shifting his weight from foot to foot so as to make less noise. The difference between walking and running in crouch mode is made clear not only by Sam's speed but by the fact that he uses one hand to hold his pistol in place to keep it from jostling and making noise. Sam can rappel down ropes (in certain spots) and even slide down ladders and poles quickly like a SWAT team member. When he draws his gun in this situation the animation of him reaching for his holster and transitioning to the hybrid-first person perspective is as silky smooth as when he puts his sidearm back into his holster and we return to third-person mode. Little details for performing actions of the sort in the various positions it's possible to get in really make the game shine on a subtle but completely appreciated, believable level.\n\nAnd it doesn't stop at the pixels, Splinter Cell boasts outstanding voice acting, an excellent score and killer sound effects. Like pretty much everything else about the game, the audio is intended to refocus your attention on being stealthy. You're doing yourself a disservice if you play this game with the sound turned down or on a godforsaken 30-year-old soundcard and pair of six dollar Labtec's.\n\nIf you're hearing a lot of ruckus at any point in Splinter Cell that usually means something intense, horrible or horribly intense is happening. This is because the music of the game changes up to match the mood of the situation you're in. A big gunfight will give you a heavy guitar track plus all of the bullets, echoes and yelling you might expect. Sneaking down an empty hallway is usually pretty quiet with background sound effects filling up the soundscape to keep the game from feeling empty and boring. What I can't understand is why some dynamic music is pigeonholed into the ambient sounds category in the options menu and thus can't be turned down without turning down stuff that should stay loud.\n\nMichael Ironside is the voice of Sam Fisher and good old Richter has the perfect tone to play a secret operative who has seen it all. All of the characters in the game are all well done with inflections, accents and subtle emotions. Sam and his NSA contact, Lambert, chat with each other regularly throughout the game with varying levels of tension. You get the feeling that while Fisher is always going to follow orders, he still doesn't completely trust Lambert or his new bosses. That's some mighty fine character development for a videogame where you can't see the actors' faces.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is, this game is demanding, and, if you wish to enjoy it with every last bit of Xbox audio and video detail intact, then you're likely going to need a GeForce FX and a $100 soundcard. I've played on Radeons, GeForce cards, and a variety of sound, processor and RAM configurations. While the resolutions are definitely improved across the board, some configurations make things worse, like GF3 card's lacking the raw amount of shadows (some of the butterflies and more advanced character shadings don't seem intact), Radeons that have anti-aliasing that destroys everything, and some minor glitches and inconsistencies on Ti4600s. It's important to take into consideration exactly what you'll be using to play Splinter Cell, for not enjoying it at its fullest means you might as well pick up a console and that version for cheaper.\n\nIf you do have the thousand plus dollars to spend on upgrades or an entirely new machine, you'll find that top-of-the-line components allow the game to, like what was done with control, retain every last bit of worthwhile detail from the Xbox original and then manage to incorporate a slew of other stock improvements that round out the whole. Improvements though, stop at graphics and control."
