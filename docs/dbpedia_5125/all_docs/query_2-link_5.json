        "text": "With any luck, all Splinter Cells will become backwards compatible on X1 eventually and that would be the best way to play them all for the most part. As of right now here's the best way to play each game:\n\nSC1-PS2: A controversial choice but the PS2 version features vastly improved UI and controls over all other versions of the game. It also has an exclusive mission and has mostly smartly truncated missions. The downsides? It doesn't look as nice as other versions and it doesn't have the Xbox DLC missions (which are near impossible to play in any capacity these days). I guess the Xbox and PS3 versions are fine but this game already hasn't aged well so might as well go with the best playing version (PS2).\n\nPandora Tomorrow-PS3: To put it simply the PS3 version of Pandora Tomorrow is the best version. The original Xbox version is really the only other version worth playing as all other versions are BAAAAAD.\n\nChaos Theory-360/Xbox/PS3/PC: PC may take a little playing around with to get going but it probably edges out every other version just slightly though if multiplayer in any capacity is not important to you then the PS3 version is definitely the way to go as it looks great (it's a port of the PC version). It's worth noting that this game is one of very few instances of a Xbox backwards compatible game that mostly plays well on 360.\n\nDouble Agent Montreal-PS2/Xbox: For the Ubi Montreal version of Double Agent deciding if you want to go PS2 or Xbox will depend on where you land with their trade offs. The Xbox version looks and runs noticeably better than the PS2 version but the PS2 version features 2 exclusive flashback missions. These versions are pretty much equal in all other regards.\n\nDouble Agent Shanghai-360: some might say the PC version is fine but it can be finicky to get running and it actually looks noticeably worse than the 360 version so just go with the 360 version. Obviously the PC version can run at a higher resolution and better frame rate but it terms of details and visual effects it looks so much worse than the 360 version. If 360 isn't an option then the PC version should be fine.\n\nConviction-360/PC/X1: Honestly, there isn't a wrong answer here. Pick the version you want to play and go with God. Obviously the 360 version running on a 360 is the worst looking/running version but it's still fine.\n\nBlacklist-PS3/360/WiiU/PC: My answer here is pretty much the same as my Conviction answer. Pick a version and enjoy. The only version I haven't played is the PS3 but I'm sure it's fine. PC is arguably the best version but the WiiU version is my favorite version (I just like what they do with the game pad).\n\nSo those are my recommended platforms to play each SC game on. Any platforms I didn't mention for each game are straight up BAD platforms to play these games on. If I'm going to be honest I wouldn't actually recommend playing SC1 or PT as they haven't aged well but I decided to include my recommendations for those two games for the sake of being thorough. SC1 and PT are not terrible games but just kind of clunky by modern standards.\n\nAs for the rest of the games they're all pretty great and worth playing. Many are overly negative about Double Agent Shanghai and Conviction but they're both totally solid games. They're also the only two games in the series to have a strong story connection between them. Also worth pointing out that excluding SC1, PT, CT (PS3 ver), and DA Shanghai all of the SC games have amazing co-op missions/campaigns that are all unique from the single player campaigns so if you can play them co-op, do it. Conviction's co-op campaign is better than the single player campaign.\n\nI guess the best way to go that doesn't involve a ton of platform hopping would be: SC1 (PS3 or PC via PS2 emulation), PT (PS3), Splinter Cell Chaos Theory (PS3 or PC), Double Agent Montreal (PC via PS2 emulation), Double Agent Shanghai (PC, the PS3 ver is atrocious), Conviction (PC), Blacklist (PS3 or PC)\n\nPandora Tomorrow (PC/XBOX)\n\nChaos Theory (PC/XBOX)\n\nDouble Agent (XBOX) i.e Version 2\n\nI've heard 1 & 2 have glitches in the HD trilogy on PS3, can't confirm.\n\nIf you really don't mind go back and play 1. 1 & 2 are more linear and not really worlds apart. Otherwise play them all start to finish.\n\nXbox was the lead platform 6th gen, PS2/GC got compromised downports as others have said here.\n\nI'm not privy to current backwards compatibility but if possible I'd go down that road. 1 & 2/PT have some fixes for some issues on PC via pcgamingwiki I believe.\n\nIf you ask me there hasn't been a sequel to this franchise since 2006. The original games (1 through 4, 6th gen) were essentially pure stealth sims, Chaos Theory and Double Agent(6th gen) have some marked sandbox sensibilities, the former especially. Every tool has its place. You live in the shadows, it's methodical and sultry ASMR needle threading espionage. Pretty stunning experience if you let yourself get absorbed, there's great joy both in perfection and learning. I recommend headphones and a dark environment.\n\nEverything 7th gen onward is stealth action ala MGSV, ACO, Dishonored etc... detection can be inconsequential, there is a broader spectrum of playstyles, gameplay is generally faster paced and more accessible even if you self limit. Fine games but they strike their own match. Blacklist tries to meld two schools of thought which is admirable but it's certainly not Splinter Cell in my eyes - it is the closest we've come since classic SC though.\n\n-------\n\nI've actually been emulating CT via Drastic (Nintendo DS) and Essentials through PPSSPP (PSP) over the past year and I really like them to be honest, exceptional little games if you don't compare them to the other entries. Drastic to some degree seems to circumvent middling performance and visuals with CT courtesy of multithreading and high res rendering but I'm not sure how tangibly improved the framerate is.\n\nI was definitely more disappointed in the critical consensus around these than the games themselves, it seems like a lot of work went into them, I've enjoyed them to no end. The levels are pretty complex and Sam has a full arsenal. Alas they are portable games, I wouldn't include them in the above compendium of recommendations.\n\nPlay Chaos Theory.\n\nStop playing Splinter Cell.\n\nCry\n\nIt is almost a religious experience.\n\nIt's obvious that many haven't actually played them\n\nJust because we aren't as fond of some of the games as you doesn't mean that it's \"obvious\" we haven't played them. It's entirely possible for people to have different opinions about a game than yours.\n\nThe first Splinter Cell was good enough for its time, but had a lot of gameplay mechanics that were annoying as shit, such as \"three alarms and the mission's over\" (such a reviled limitation that even Ubisoft acknowledges and mocks it in Chaos Theory), some really terrible auto-saving checkpoints that could leave you restarting a checkpoint in the middle of a gunfight when you're already near death and getting shot, etc. Pandora Tomorrow had some cheap ass AI that led to instant alarms that shouldn't have been physically possible, like taking out one enemy in a large, darkened room with a silenced weapon and another enemy 50 yards away not only instantly detecting you, but sounding an alarm instantly.\n\nFor someone trying to get into the series in 2018, IMO playing these two games is a good way to ensure they don't continue with the series. I picked up the original on PC back when it was free on Uplay and tried to replay it and, damn, it's really rough. Chaos Theory fixed a ton of problems with the first two games, actually had a story worth giving half a shit about, and is so much more polished and fluid than the first two that it still holds up."
