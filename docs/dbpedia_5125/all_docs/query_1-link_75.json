        "text": "According to the ESRB, this game contains: Strong Language, Violence\n\nParents should be aware that while the game emphasizes being sneaky and passing through areas unseen, the game is populated with enemy soldiers and a fairly realistic slant; no big bugs or aliens here. It's often necessary (or just easier) to kill or disable the opposition, and Sam Fisher has a wide variety of techniques. Parents who are sensitive to this type of violence should steer their children clear. There are also a small handful of instances with stiff language, though nothing that you probably wouldn't hear on late-night network TV. There is no sexual content or sexual situations.\n\nSplinter Cell fanatics might find enough here to justify the time spent playing the game, especially since there are several connections to the upcoming sequel. However, the graphics are bad, the control is bad, and some of the missions are rehashes from the earlier games in the series. My suggestion would be to let Essentials pass you by unless you absolutely have to play every single game in the series.\n\nPSP action fans should forget it. The control issues are significant and the gameplay is so clunky and unsatisfying that your money is better spent elsewhere."
