        "text": "It’s been almost 10 years since we last saw Sean Durkin bring us a new project, and with this welcomed return, we get a dark look at the American dream...\n\nFull Review | Apr 4, 2024\n\nThe Nest is perhaps the first COVID-19/quarantine film without meaning to be. Its levels of isolation are deeply felt and highlighted by the lies we tell ourselves or the ones whom we hold most dear.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | Sep 2, 2022\n\nIts thrills are muted and the horror is of a deeply human nature.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | Aug 24, 2022\n\nIt’s not ghosts that haunt the O’Haras though. It’s lies and deception. Things unravel, not with any dramatic acceleration, but with a lingering inevitability.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Aug 15, 2022\n\n... A mature and complex reflection on the culture of appearances, and the hoax behind a supposedly perfect and successful family, so seemingly happy they make you want to puke. [Full review in Spanish]\n\nFull Review | Jun 22, 2022\n\nSome moments stretch disbelief, such as Rorys discussion with the worlds wisest cab driver. However, The Nests use of tangible fears and unsettling tone make for a drama that will rattle around in your head for days.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Mar 3, 2022\n\nDurkin finds a kind of acceptance for his characters, just as his viewers must accept that The Nest isn't a closed book of a film.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/4 | Feb 17, 2022\n\nThere's plenty of atmosphere and an interesting set-up, but hints at malevolence afoot lose their momentum and the early promise winds up nowhere\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Sep 13, 2021\n\nEarthy and intriguing, this intensely personal drama has a terrific balance of humour and darkness, keeping the audience on edge with a subtle sense of foreboding.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | Sep 2, 2021\n\nThere's something commendably old fashioned and decidedly unassuming about The Nest. Durkin's direction is both precise and admirably restrained in its depiction of an era famed for its excesses.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Sep 2, 2021\n\nLove is an impenetrable thing for the O'Haras - which makes every begrudging attempt at it even more fascinating to watch in this riveting, reluctant family portrait.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Sep 1, 2021"
