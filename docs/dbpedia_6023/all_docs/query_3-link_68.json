        "text": "Holy shit, talk about slept on. Bug-based creature features will always get me, but this one does so many things better than your average “insect hordes attack” schlock B-movie; great coastal small town vibes, characters that feel grounded and mean, goopy gore and outstandingly dope practical effects, the obvious heroes of the hour being the sheriff, the mayor’s daughter, and the kooky local exterminator (the guy’s rocking a Hawaiian shirt and thick round oversized glasses—you think he’s losing? Try again)—if you’re going to make a formulaic movie about a mad scientist bug lady unleashing genetically engineered cockroaches as an experiment for an evil corporation, these are the boxes you need to check to set it apart from the pack. I…\n\nHooptober 9: It’s in Space Now\n\nThis film is always a solid rewatch when I want to remind myself how much I fucking can’t stand cockroaches.\n\nLike it’s bad. The first place I lived after moving out had a roach problem that the landlord never dealt with. As a night owl I was fully paranoid anytime I moved around. It freaked me out and now I’ll comb my place for hours if I so much as suspect I’ve got roaches. Luckily I’ve been roach free for years… right?\n\nYeah this film makes me feel like I’ve got roaches crawling on my neck. It opens with a roach in someone’s cup of coffee and that just sets the mood now doesn’t…\n\nI'm itching just writing this.\n\nYou guys can't possibly understand how triggering this film is to me. Growing up in the roach infested projects of Ravenswood and Queensbridge NY, I have had far too many heart-stopping run-ins with la cucaracha that sitting through ninety minutes of The Nest became less of a movie experience and more an excruciating navigation through a PTSD minefield. Roaches in food, roaches in beverages, roaches in foot casts, in plumbing, and in cars, all of them shitting and squirting and dying as grossly and as roachly as possible. These unkillable bastards are also mutated to the degree that they can strip bones clean within seconds of their arrival. And further, have the ability to fuse…\n\n1988 mutated killer cockroaches ‘invade a small town’ jam produced by Julie Corman for Roger’s Concorde pictures is another 50’s sci-fi movie beamed right into the 1980’s—complete with a power hungry town mayor trying to keep things covered up, an evil scientist from an evil corporation, and a cockaroach cave lair—plus some goopy effects, a cat/roach hybrid, a human/roach hybrid, and a multiheaded contorted/writhing human roach hybrid queen that rips off arms and slices skulls with some From Beyond lighting in the background.\n\nKinda loved the ‘small coastal town’ vibe (I always do) and it gets better as it goes... that last act is pretty great and if you find roaches disgusting like I do than you’re in for a gross…\n\nThe Nest is vile, nausea inducing, and mean spirited.\n\nSo naturally, I loved it!\n\nI was familiar with this horror effort for years, mainly due to its scandalous and incredibly memorable key art but had never pulled the trigger on watching it. How much time I’ve wasted…I could have seen this underrated and underseen horror gem multiple times by now.\n\nSo, consider this your own personal PSA -- don’t be like me and put this one off -- especially if you have a fondness for animal/creature attack films, mutant/mad scientist flicks, or creepy crawler horror efforts like Ticks or Arachnophobia.\n\nIf you love practical gore effects, The Nest is a gem. Loaded with goop, split open body parts, and all…\n\nOk, look. I'm willing to concede that I can be a rather hyperbolic fellow at times. I'm a man of extremes. When something ticks the right boxes for me I usually love the crap out of it. And, conversely, I can hate with equal passion, though it doesn't happen often. I'm usually good at drilling down to the core of a thing and finding the good in it, no matter how hidden it may be. But I just about fell off my damn couch when I finished this movie, after having my wig thoroughly flipped by this thing, only to hit LB and discover that you're all bloody insane. Like, can anyone explain to me just how in the everloving…\n\nKiller cockroach mania!!!! A peaceful coastal town is being terrorized by all different forms of mutated cockroaches. There's regular cockroaches, mutant cat cockroaches and the granddaddy three headed human/cockroach nightmare of a monster! Will the hunk cop and his girlfriend save the day before it's too late?\n\nEndearing practical FX, B movie charm and a whole lot of other stuff too. And I absolutely love the poster art. Intense! For a film of this cheesy caliber I was actually surprised by how well the gore and special FX hold up. And to top it all off we have a decent score filled with 80s synths and suspenseful ditties.\n\nThere are a few sub plots of political conspiracies and love triangles…"
