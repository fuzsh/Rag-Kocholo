        "text": "October 4th marks the birthday of a cinematic icon- Buster Keaton, the Great Stone Face. To honor the man, I’ve put together a series of photos that represent a tremendous career in cinema. These film stills all say so much about several aspects of his career. The expression is that a picture is worth a thousand words. If that’s the case, then this collection of stills says nearly as much about Keaton as Keaton himself ever uttered on film.\n\nThe Daredevil\n\nIt’s impossible to talk about Keaton without mentioning his extraordinary dangerous feats. Keaton constantly put himself in peril, all for the sake of humor.\n\nIn order: Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928); The Balloonatic (1923); One Week (1920); The General (1927); Sherlock, Jr. (1924); Seven Chances (1925); Convict 13 (1920)\n\nThe Athlete\n\nThe reason Keaton could pull off his special brand of his humor was his athletic ability. Without his running speed and agility, his humor would’ve lacked the same panache.\n\nIn order: The Cameraman (1928); The Electric House (1922); Seven Chances (1925); College (1927)\n\nThe Great Stone Face\n\nOne of Keaton’s trademarks was his emotionless, deadpan expression regardless of the chaos around him. The juxtaposition of stoicism with a world in disarray was at the heart of his comedy. It earned him the nickname “The Great Stone Face”.\n\nIn order: The Goat (1921); The General (1927); College (1927); Returning from France in 1934\n\nOriginality and Experimentation\n\nPart of what allowed Keaton to succeed was his intense curiosity about filmmaking- what could be done, special effects, tearing film apart and putting it back together in ways that hadn’t been done before.\n\nIn order: Sherlock, Jr. (1924); The Playhouse (1921); filmed underwater in The Navigator (1924); a binocular-eye view of Keaton imitating a chimpanzee in The Playhouse (1921)\n\nThe Down on his Luck Ladies Man\n\nKeaton frequently posed as a guy who was down on his luck, chasing after the object of his affection. He didn’t always get the girl, but that only served to make his dour, expressionless face that much more effective.\n\nIn order: One Week (1920); The Love Nest (1923); The Navigator (1924); The Scarecrow (1920)\n\nThe Long Reach of Influence\n\nKeaton’s career goes all the way back to Fatty Arbuckle before anyone knew who Keaton was. He experienced his impressive peak during the 1920’s. Afterwards, despite a massive lull in popularity during his MGM years and the two decades afterward, Keaton’s charms endured. Out of respect for his talents, Keaton continued to get screen time until he died. And he remains an icon of cinema, one of the titans of both comedy and silent film."
