        "text": "Donna Parker\n\nDonna Parker, a native of Los Angeles, CA, began her organ studies at the age of seven. Four years later she was introduced to the theatre organ and, at 13, began her classical organ instruction with Richard Purvis, Organist and Master of Choristers Emeritus and Honorary Canon of San Francisco’s famed Grace Cathedral. Donna quickly established a name for herself on the concert circuit as a very capable performer for one so young. She made her first recording at 15, was appointed the first Official Organist for the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, and toured Southern California in concert as a product specialist for Conn Organ Company. Through arrangements made by George Wright, Donna began studying harmony and arranging with Gordon Kibbee while also studying theatre organ stylings with Lyn Larsen. Donna maintains an active concert and recording schedule, besides private teaching and playing for church. She currently serves as the Membership Secretary for the American Theatre Organ Society and is a member of the core teaching team for the American Theatre Organ Society’s Summer Youth Adventure—a week-long education opportunity for young people to learn how to play the theatre organ.\n\n\"An original theatre installation, the Paramount's Mighty Wurlitzer has a beautiful, varied tonal palette that inspires such creativity when writing the film scores and performing. With its many tonal colors, the instrument is capable of a broad range of music repertoire from classical to current hits, and its majestic sounds never cease to amaze me as an artist.\"\n\n— Donna Parker\n\nTedde Gibson\n\nTedde Gibson started playing the piano at age 4. He is one of a few musicians able to play not only classical and theatre pipe organ, but also jazz and gospel organ on the Hammond and piano and integrates these styles into his playing of the Mighty Wurlitzer organ. A native of Tacoma, Tedde studied pipe organ with the late Dr. Edward Hansen, president of the American Guild of Organists and organ professor at the University of Puget Sound; David Dahl, organist emeritus of Pacific Lutheran; Dr. J. Melvin Butler of the University of Washington and St. Marks Cathedral; and while attending UW, with Dr. Carol Terry. Tedde has also coached with international theatre organist Jonas Nordwall of Portland and the late Andy Crow of Olympia. Since moving to the DC area in 2003, he has studied classical organ with Dr. Mickey Thomas Terry, editor of the 7+ volume anthology of organ works by African American composers. Tedde also studied organ performance at The Peabody Institute of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. In the DC area he is organist/ musician-in-residence at First Baptist Church of Highland Park; organist at Capitol Hill Seventh-Day Adventist Church and Holy Comforter-St. Cyprian Roman Catholic Church and teaches music at Highland Park Christian Academy. Tedde is on the board of directors for the American Theatre Organ Society, an international non-profit organization comprised of worldwide volunteer members who are committed to helping preserve and perpetuate the musical theatre pipe organ heritage that began in the early 20th century. Tedde has been accompanying films for silent Movie Mondays since 2015.\n\n\"The Mighty Wurlitzer is the perfect musical vehicle to express my style. Its wide dynamic range can roar like a lion or purr like a cat instantaneously. It has such a wide range of musical colors and is able to reach deep in the soul of the listener while they watch the action on the screen and it melds sight and sound together as one.\"\n\n— Tedde Gibson\n\nChristian Elliott\n\nChristian Elliott is one of today’s premier theatre organists who specializes in presenting historically authentic silent film accompaniment. The protégé of legendary silent film organist Gaylord Carter, he was fortunate to have had the tradition of silent film accompaniment passed down to him from one of the finest film accompaniments of the silent film era. He has done extensive silent film accompaniment, including at the Packard Foundation’s Stanford Theatre (Palo Alto, CA), UCLA, the Cinequest and San Francisco Silent Film Festivals, San Luis Obispo International Film Festival, as well as the San Diego Symphony, Los Angeles Conservancy, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Christian is a frequent performer at the American Theatre Organ Society’s national conventions; as a solo artist has recordings available on iTunes; and continues to perform solo organ engagements and silent film presentations all across the United States. In 2009 he was named “Organist of the Year” by the American Theatre Organ Society. Christian has been accompanying films for Silent Movie Mondays since 2015.\n\n\"The Seattle Paramount Mighty Wurlitzer is a wind-blown instrument which provides colors, textures, and a sonic range that no other acoustic or virtual instrument can match. The Wurlitzer allows me to musically support a motion picture through an enormous range of emotions. I believe it plays a big role in taking a live silent film presentation from simply ‘a night at the movies’ to ‘a memorable experience’ for an audience! \"\n\n— Christian Elliott\n\nTyler Pattison\n\nTyler Pattison, a Western Washington native, began keyboard studies in the first grade and has enjoyed a wide variety of experiences as a musician ever since. Tyler's studies in theatre organ began at age 11 under the tutelage of the late Don Wallin. Tyler has also studied with other well known organists who frequently appear at the Paramount such as Donna Parker, Jonas Nordwall, and at Gonzaga University with Dr. Janet Ahrend. Tyler has performed internationally as a vocalist and organist, but is most at home here in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. As an accompanist, Tyler strives to use the language of music to transport audiences toward a deeper connection to the stories presented in silent films, and other mediums, across all genres and time periods. This marks Tyler's debut at the Mighty Wurlitzer for Silent Movie Mondays.\n\n\"The organ is to the organist as the palette is to the painter. The Mighty Wurlitzer pipe organ, which has dwelled inside the walls of the Paramount for nearly a century, stands ready to quench the silence of the silver screen with broad strokes of colorful, vibrant, and living sound. Equipped with a vast array of quiet whispers and commanding ensembles, The Mighty Wurlitzer and its variety of musical resources enables me to explore diverse and creative tonalities that are possible only with an instrument of this magnitude and refinement.\"\n\n— Tyler Pattison"
