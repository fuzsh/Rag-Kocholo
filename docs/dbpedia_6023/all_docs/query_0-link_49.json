The home movies were shot, edited, and titled by Harry Lee Harllee, a white naturalist, ornithologist, taxidermist, and founder of the Harllee Museum of Natural History and the Harllee Construction Company, both in Florence, S.C. Film subjects include people formerly enslaved by the Harllee, Rogers and Brockington families; members of the Harllee, Quattlebaum, Blackwell, and Dargan families; friends; hunting and fishing scenes in North Carolina and South Carolina; Magnolia Plantation and Gardens in Charleston, S.C.; members of the Woodstone Hunting Club; and trips to Washington, D.C., the Florida Keys, and Elon College, N.C., in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Many of the films are extensively edited and contain numerous intertitles identifying people and places. Some also have identifying information written on paper inserts or on their boxes. The commercially released films are primarily short nature documentaries.\n\nBack to Top\n\nContents list"
