The film follows Zhao Yimei, an elderly woman who has spent her life nursing the wounds of her husband’s betrayal. Estranged from her son and grappling with incontinence, she loses faith in life and contemplates ending it all. Enter Lei Xiaoding, a charismatic health care product salesman whose chance encounter with Zhao brings unexpected joy to her life. His humor, diligence, and warmth rekindle her belief in love and happiness. As their bond deepens, Zhao Yimei buys numerous health products from Lei, supporting his dreams of making it big in the city. However, Lei’s ambitions lead him down a dark path. Empty Nest is a powerful exploration of human connection, fortitude, and the transformative power of love in the face of life’s most challenging moments."
