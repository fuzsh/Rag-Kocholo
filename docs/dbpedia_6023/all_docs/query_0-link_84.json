        "text": "As many of you know, Letterboxd recently updated its Official Top 250 Narrative Feature Films list. And since Film Colossus is committed to providing the best movie analysis on the internet, we decided to challenge ourselves: let's dissect every single film on that list.\n\nIf you don't already know, we at Film Colossus write \"movie guides\" that completely break down films: theme, ending, motifs, etc. Think Sparknotes for movies. Sometimes it's difficult to nail down which films to write about. But Letterboxd made it easy with their most recent update.\n\nSo begins this massive undertaking. While it may take awhile, we're dedicated to finishing this ambitious project. We'll continually update this page as we complete movie guides.\n\nDissecting the Letterboxd Top 250"
