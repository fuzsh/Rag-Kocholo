Sensing opportunity, Rory rejoins his former firm and leases a centuries-old country manor, with grounds for Allison’s horses and plans to build a stable. Soon the promise of a lucrative new beginning starts to unravel, the couple have to face the unwelcome truths lying beneath the surface of their marriage.\n\nContact us for information on booking any of our films or log in to the IFC Films Extranet for stills, artwork, video, and more."
