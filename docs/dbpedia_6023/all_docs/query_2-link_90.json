        "text": "Randle McMurphy is an outlandish outsider, and a convicted criminal who has problems adapting to the status quo. After McMurphy is sentenced to prison for the statutory rape of a 15-year-old girl who claimed to be 18, he explains, ”She was very willing, I practically had to take to sewing my pants shut.” He is able to escape penal labor by convincing the court the he belongs in a mental institution. At the mental institution, McMurphy fights against the unlimited power of the evil Nurse Ratched.\n\nMcMurphy fights to defend the other patients in the mental institution from Nurse Ratched. He teaches the dumb Native American Chief Bromden, the neurotic Billy Bibbit, the fantasising Martin and the childish Charlie Cheswick how to long for freedom and life behind the walls of the bureaucratic madhouse. And, because even a complete madman deserves to have a bit of fun, he organizes a party and demands to watch a baseball final. What McMurphy doesn’t realize is that his true adversary isn’t Nurse Ratched, but a madman with an angelic face.\n\nAfter his American debut “Taking Off”,Forman spent several years searching for new film material. During this time, Forman suffered both in his personal and his professional life, but this interim period also sparked a radical change in his creative style. As a result, Forman managed to break away from the typical Czech tragicomedy to focus on psychological dramas. This shift ultimately helped him to gain an American audience.\n\nForman was given a second chance to work in America when actor and producer Michael Douglas offered him the chance to make a film adaptation of Ken Kesey’s cult novel “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest”. The independently produced film surprised everyone involved when it earned nearly $300 million worldwide. “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” was the seventh most profitable film of the 1970s, and the first movie since Frank Capra’s “It Happened One Night” (1934) to win awards in all major categories. The next movie to do this was “The Silence of the Lambs” in 1991."
