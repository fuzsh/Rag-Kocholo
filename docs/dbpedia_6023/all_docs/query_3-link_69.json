        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Oscar winner Vanessa Redgrave (Howards End) and Oscar nominee Andrea Riseborough (To Leslie) have signed on to star in BAFTA-winning writer-director Paul Andrew Williams’ (Bull) next film, The Nest.\n\nThe film will chart the story of two neighbours who strike up an unlikely friendship, sometimes to the disapproval of others around them. Seeing the lack of care that her elderly neighbour Elsie (Redgrave) is receiving from so called professionals, Colleen (Riseborough) takes it upon herself to care for her. However, Colleen’s intentions may not be what they seem.\n\nFilming is due to begin this summer in Yorkshire in the UK, with AMP launching sales in Cannes.\n\nPic is produced by Dominic Tighe (Giant Productions) and Marie-Elena Dyche (Meraki Films). Executive producers are Eilene Davidson (Eilene Davidson Productions), Naomi Despres and Michèle Marshall (Desmar Films), Caroline Cooper Charles (Screen Yorkshire), Bruno Wang and Jonathan Zimmern.\n\nThe director is coming off well-received feature Bull and is known for films including London To Brighton and Murdered By My Boyfriend. The project reunites Williams and Redgrave after their collaboration on Song For Marion.\n\nWilliams said: “The chance to bring this project to the screen with such amazing, talented actors in Vanessa and Andrea is a complete privilege. Being able to do this with the team behind Bull again is brilliant and I only hope I can do it justice.”\n\nProducers Tighe and Dyche added: “We are so excited to be working once again with Paul who brings such a distinct and visceral style to all his work, which will be further elevated by this wonderful cast. This film touches on the thorny subject of care in the UK but as ever he subverts genre and has created an incredibly tense environment from out of the ordinary while also having something to say about the world we live in. This is vital, exciting cinema that we are proud to be a part of.”\n\nAMP International’s Head of Sales, Acquisitions & Distribution Anthony Buckner commented: “We are thrilled to be working with such an exceptionally talented team to help bring this powerful story to the international market place and can’t wait to discuss it with buyers in Cannes”.\n\nRiseborough is repped by CAA, Independent Talent Group, and Untitled Entertainment. Redgrave is repped by CAA, and Gavin Barker Associates. Williams is repped by Independent Talent Group and Echolake Management."
