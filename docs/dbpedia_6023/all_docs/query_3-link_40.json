        "text": "A lavish new home opens doors to a marriage’s secrets in writer-director Sean Durkin’s The Nest. A 2020 Sundance Film Festival premiere, the film stars Jude Law, Carrie Coon, Oona Roche and Charlie Shotwell in what IFC Films calls “an unsettling, naturalistic drama.”\n\nThe synopsis: Rory (Law), an ambitious entrepreneur and former commodities broker, persuades his American wife Allison (Coon), and their children to leave the comforts of suburban America and return to his native England during the 1980s. Sensing opportunity, Rory rejoins his former firm and leases a centuries-old country manor, with grounds for Allison’s horses and plans to build a stable. Soon the promise of a lucrative new beginning starts to unravel, the couple have to face the unwelcome truths lying beneath the surface of their marriage.\n\n“What is happening?,” Coon’s distraught Allison says at one point in the teaser. “You’re all strangers to me right now!”\n\nIFC Films will release The Nest in theaters beginning September 18, 2020. Check out the new teaser above."
