        "text": "Gaav (The Cow) (1969)\n\nFlawed but memorable Iranian village tale\n\nAlthough Gaav (The Cow) was made in1969, its story of a tragedy in a small village could probably could have been set anytime in the last 5,000 years. At first, I thought the film might be a Fellini Amacord Iranian-style, a director’s nostalgic look back at a simpler time and place, remembered from his childhood. But a better comparison might be Sunset (1927, Murnau): there is a timeless, eternal quality to the proceedings. These are not any individual’s memories; instead, Gaav is a myth-like “universal” story.\n\nAnother point of reference is Sergei Paradjanov (Color of Pomegranates, Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors), who used the techniques of experimental cinema to bring new life to ancient myths and folkways. Unfortunately it has to be said that the director of Gaav, Dariush Mehrjui didn’t demonstrate as much cinematic skill or imagination as Paradjanov, at least in this film. There’s glaring technical problems in the film, surely due to production and direction: the numerous night shots are often too dark to decipher; sound levels vary wildly from inaudible to deafening; awkward framing and editing makes it hard to understand the space of action; a subplot about a young couple’s courtship seems a fruitless distraction; direction and staging of groups of actors, seems at times, artificial and awkward.\n\nYet the director gets strong performances from his main actors, and the film progresses to a deep and affecting climax. The scenes involving Hassan and his friend Eslam form the core of the film, and are memorably odd and tragic.\n\nHassan has an all-consuming, absolutely pure love for his cow. It is the center of his world; even his wife seems to barely register to him. When the cow dies, Hassan cannot cope with the loss. His world crumbles, he retreats into madness. The plot revolves around the village’s attempts to care for and accommodate Hassan’s outsized love and grief. At this, it fails. As we see from the film’s opening scene, the village can be a place of casual cruelty. In the end, the village’s well-intentioned intercessions become the very cause of the final tragedy.\n\nThe most pivotal moment in the plot occurs when Hassan’s friend Eslam and three others attempt to deal with the grief-stricken Hassan, who has become dangerously disconnected from reality. In his delusion, his friends appear to him as murderous enemies. This is the true tragedy of the tale: love can exist in a form so extreme and powerful that the social order can do nothing except kill it. In this case, one’s friends and neighbors may unwittingly turn out to be one’s executioners.\n\nMandara (1971)\n\nJissoji is a forgotten master of cinema…but, be careful…!\n\nMandara is the second part of director Akio Jissoji’s “Buddhist Trilogy” (The previous part of the trilogy, This Transient Life (1970) is a masterwork: highly recommended as one of the best Japanese films of the era.)\n\nThis “Buddhist Trilogy” is not about some kind of gentle, upbeat New-Age Buddhism. Rather, it considers human morality in relation to the Void, and presents a vision of life unconstrained by standard social norms. In Mandara, it seems Jissoji takes a wholly amoral stance – the perspective “beyond good and evil” familiar from de Sade or Nietzsche. The plot involves extreme sexual violence and a bizarre coercive cult (one part Charles Manson and two parts Shinto animism).\n\nThe protagonists of Mandara are leftist student radicals; it’s implied their 1968 idealism has degenerated into 1971 nihilism. From our era, it’s very difficult to understand the attitudes of this milieu. The biggest flaw of the film is that all the characters so strange and mysterious that it’s difficult to identify or empathize with them. They appear as lawless libertine weirdos, whose motivations are opaque.\n\nIn Jissoji’s previous film, the protagonist’s non-moral actions are set up in contrast against all the other character’s traditional ethical values. However, in Mandara, social norms don’t even enter the frame: it’s a world in which everyone is desperate and on edge, and explosive violence, an inevitability, is welcomed as some kind of release. The ethical questions get pushed well past the point of reckoning — how much sexual violence should the viewer have to endure witnessing? Can the viewer even begin to debate the film’s positions, if the director makes an entry point so difficult?\n\nBut, there is a lot to admire in this film, and I’m glad I endured past the first scene of sexual assault. Mandara is a serious arthouse film, not some brainless “pink film” shot for cheap thrills and a quick payday. It contains real philosophical (and even theological) content. It’s best to understand Mandara through lens of the political moment of 1971: in the aftermath of 1968’s global student uprisings, radicals and progressives became pessimistic and bitter, and were willing to entertain the idea of burning down the system, since it seemed impossible to change it. The violent destruction of an insane world is a common theme of cinema of the era, as in Godard’s Weekend (1967), Claude Faraldo’s Themroc (1973), Milos Forman’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975). The darkness and dissatisfaction at the core of Mandara is not simple nihilism and despair. Personally, I am no advocate of amorality, but Jissoji deserves admiration for his dedication to his extreme and complex vision.\n\nMandara is a challenging film to understand or enjoy…and yet, any aficionado of cinema should see it, because visually it’s quite amazing. Nearly every shot overwhelms with the beauty of its composition. There’s an edgy psychedelic quality to all the proceedings. Interiors are shot at odd angles in saturated colors, exaggerating a scene’s mood (as in Antonioni’s films), and exteriors scenes make nature look full of visionary significance. It’s a pity Mandara would alienate most viewers, with its unappealing characters, brutal misogyny, and extreme “beyond good and evil” ethics…because it’s extraordinary to look at.\n\nSo…here’s a film for deep cinephiles, old-school leftist radicals, fans of sexual violence, decadent Shinto acolytes, or just extreme weirdos like me. Everyone else should probably proceed with caution.\n\nHimiko (1974)\n\nThe distant past, seen through a Modernist lens\n\nThere’s exists a particular subgenre of historical films: ones that aim to bring to life ancient times — but not by a simple “authentic” recreation of the past: instead, the director uses experimental/modernist cinematic techniques to bring traditional folklore and beliefs firmly into relation with the present. Examples include Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors (1965, Paradjanov), Marketa Lazerova (1967, Vlacil), The Night of Counting the Years (1969, Chadi Abdel Salam). Like these, Himoko powerfully reanimates dormant cultural world-views, and is particularly successful at connecting them to our era\n\nHimoko retells an ancient Japanese legend of a shaman-queen. The story is timeless and “universal”, yet the world of Himoko is a particular Shinto animist world, in which gods of the sun and the land directly control people’s lives. The viewer is pulled into the past, by the beautiful unspoiled forest and mountain landscapes, the peoples’ costumes and rituals, and most powerfully by the intensity of the performances — especially Shima Iwashita’s portrayal of Himoko, in which she conveys the fervid absolute conviction of shamanistic belief and practice.\n\nBut the viewer is also pushed into the present. The director Shinoda does not try to fool the viewer with an “authentic” past: the indoor scenes are staged in a space resembling a theatrical set or art gallery, with clearly unnatural (but beautifully dramatic) lighting — perhaps a nod to Brechtian theater techniques. A troupe of five Butoh dancers perform stunning, horrifying, evocative dance-rituals throughout, acting sometimes as a Greek chorus outside the story-space, at other times directly involved in the action. And the film’s coda breaks the fourth wall, making it plain that Shinoda’s interest lies not in the distant past, but in the way that ancient things still live within the present.\n\nGishiki (The Ceremony, 1971)\n\nDarkness, trauma, misfortune\n\nA boy experiences traumas during WWII (which, thankfully, we are not shown), and the subsequent 25 years of his life are a continuation of those traumas. Director Nagisa Oshima skillfully depicts Japan’s post-war economic development and cultural shifts, and the ways the repressed secrets of the past live on within the present.\n\nGishiki is by no means an enjoyable film: the main character experiences nothing but losses, misfortunes, and humiliations. But this is a painful truth of life: anyone who lives long enough accumulates losses and failures, and for some, perhaps everything else is overtaken by them. In the end, the main character is left alone with nothing except his lost dreams and his endlessly repeating traumas. A very sad film, but one I am glad to have seen.\n\nTess (1979)"
