        "text": "Be a Master of Film. Direct or DP a 35MM sync sound film or Produce one to two international 35mm films in the Czech Republic.\n\nCarry out the vision for your story in a city whose cinematic history stretches back to the early days of the art form itself. From the late 1800s, when the first Czech films were made in the region of Bohemia, through the political struggles of the 1960s that spawned the Czech New Wave, the film heritage of this country will give you a rich tapestry of material to draw from.\n\nThere is no match for the beauty of an image captured on film. The incredible dynamic range and fine grain offered by film stock make it the medium of choice for directors such as Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan, despite the convenience and low cost of digital formats. Learn to harness the visual power of 35mm and broaden your talents as an aspiring director or director of photography. You’ll have the opportunity to complete your project in a supervised post-production session where you color correct and transfer your original 35mm negative.\n\n\"When you work with film, every little detail in the frame matters. There is no nonchalance or affordability that permits a third or fourth take, so you rarely press record until what you see on camera is bordering perfection: there is no room for error. To endure this, you adapt. You begin to focus more, to look at light and color with greater precision - things you are taught to do when working with digital but can sometimes become negligent about due to complacency and it’s flexibility as a medium.\n\nWhen you are stripped off this privilege, you are suddenly forced to reckon with sublimity - there is no other option. As a result, your skills as a filmmaker are strengthened if not tested, and you return to digital filmmaking with a greater reiteration and appreciation of the fundamentals of cinematography.\"\n\n— Farah Jabir, 35mm Filmmaking in Prague, summer 2018\n\nProgram Overview\n\nThe Tisch School offers this program in collaboration with one of Europe’s oldest and most prestigious film schools, the Film and Television School of the Academy of Performing Arts (FAMU). FAMU is an independent academy which focuses on audio and visual media. Their alumni include Jiri Menzel (Closely Watched Trains), Milos Forman (Amadeus and One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest) and Agnieszkha Holland (Europa Europa). The FAMU faculty are active members of the Czech filmmaking community (including established cinematographers, directors, editors, scholars, and writers). Under their expert guidance, you will have the opportunity to branch out and study 35mm sync-sound filmmaking from an entirely different tradition and culture.\n\nNote: The Prague academic year program varies slightly from the summer program. In summer, you must indicate your preference for one role: director, director of photography, or producer. Students will be accepted into the six-week program in one role. In summer, all films are exterior projects.\n\nCurriculum\n\nStudents will enroll in the following two courses for a total of 8 units.\n\nPlease Note: Students studying abroad on a Tisch track are not eligible to pursue an internship (except for Theatre in Ghana and Television Writing in London). Tisch programs do not provide work visas.\n\nMaster Class in 35mm Filmmaking\n\nIFMTV-UT 1200 | 4 units | Instructor: FAMU Faculty\n\nThis is an intensive program, taught by world-renowned faculty of FAMU, including master teachers who are industry professionals. Students receive hands-on training exploring essential elements and tools of advanced sync-sound film production through 35mm filmmaking. Course work covers a detailed overview of screenwriting, directing, and editing, including workshops in 35 mm motion picture camera and lighting techniques. Rushes are screened with intensive critique sessions. Participants finish the course with a final off-line group edit.\n\nNote: Students should bring their own laptops and can access their Adobe Creative Cloud via their NYU Net ID.\n\nNote for NYU Tisch Undergraduate Film and Television Majors: The maximum length for an intermediate film to be eligible for NYU Tisch Film festivals is 8 minutes.\n\nSeminar on Czech Cinema and Culture\n\nIFMTV-UT 1040 l 4 units | Instructor: FAMU Faculty\n\nEmphasizing one of the most influential movements in the post-World War II era, the cinema of the Czech New Wave, this course explores the history and development of Czech and Slovak cinema and its impact on contemporary culture. Lectures are supplemented with screenings and field trips.\n\nInformation for Producers\n\nAll students take the two courses (Master Class in 35mm Filmmaking and Seminar on Czech Cinema and Culture) together. Embedded in these courses are producing lectures focused on producing films in Europe. You will produce one to two films and work with FAMU production managers on budget, location, casting, scheduling, call sheets, etc.\n\nWatch\n\nProgram Dates\n\nSummer 2024\n\nStudent Arrival: Monday, May 20, 2024\n\nStudent Departure: Sunday, June 30, 2024\n\nArrival and departure dates are subject to change.\n\nAdmissions\n\nThe summer 2024 application is closed.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nFilm/TV majors: Sight and Sound Filmmaking (FMTV-UT 43) and one more Sight and Sound of your choice, Production Safety & Set Protocol (FMTV-UT 101).
