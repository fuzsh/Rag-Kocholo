This whole movie is still so unsettling. Anthony Hopkins’ line delivery and demeanor made Hannibal the horror icon he is today. The film, despite being centered on cannibalism, focuses more on the horrors of tension and the mind rather than on the blood and gore. Although it’s a slow burn, the film is effective in making audiences feel real dread.\n\nAnnalise’s Pick: ‘The VVitch’\n\nWhile I admire Robert Eggers’ devotion to as much historical accuracy as possible, there was just something about this movie that I didn’t like. The movie felt disconnected from itself and like it was trying too hard to be different. In trying to distinguish itself from the pack, it lost the aspects of a horror movie that fans look for. It was uncomfortable to watch at its best, and at its worst, boring. The VVitch could serve as a good watch for fans who enjoy the discordant and unsettling.\n\nAya’s Pick: ‘Split’\n\nSplit is a soft-ball for those of you who may not be all the way into scream in your face type horror movies. I must commend James McAvoy’s acting in this film – the guy played like 20 characters in one movie. Split explores adult themes while expanding on a pre-existing heroes and villains universe that, for spoilers sake, I will not share. If anyone out there has seen Criminal Minds, it feels like an episode of Criminal Minds, but without the perspective of the police.\n\nCatherine’s Pick: ‘The Lazarus Effect’\n\nThough the film had a surprisingly star-studded cast, with names like Donald “Childish Gambino” Glover and Evan Peters, The Lazarus Effect fell flat in terms of explanation. The movie is both based in science and in the paranormal, making for what could have been an interesting premise. Like most modern horror, the film’s scares rely on loud noises over subtlety. As scientists, there is a fair bit of animal involvement in the film, which isn’t something I generally enjoy in movies. However, for those of you who aren’t sensitive to that sort of thing, The Lazarus Effect can be a fun and easy watch.\n\nDarnell’s Pick: ‘Suspiria’\n\nSuspiria is an artful take on the horror film, with focus on cinematography and color. The dialogue, though originally spoken in English, also seems to be dubbed over in English, meaning the voices are just slightly disembodied from the actors mouthing the words. Though that could have been a conscious choice, for me, it creates a barrier that doesn’t allow me to become fully immersed in the story. Nevertheless, appreciation for Suspiria comes from its art, not its writing. Though it is bloody in its kills, Suspiria is a softer horror movie that fans new to the genre could enjoy.\n\nEdyn’s Pick: ‘The Conjuring’\n\nWhile the most recent installments in the universe have been sub-par, The Conjuring always serves as a glimmer of hope to look back on. The scares in this film are still effective for viewers who may not have seen the movie in a while. I did have some sort of immediate fear reaction to hearing “hide and clap,” though, so there are still portions of the movie that will come back to you as you watch. Overall, The Conjuring is a quick ghost movie with a few good scares to get the blood pumping on Halloween night.\n\nMolly’s Pick: ‘Hereditary’\n\nThis film is a classic example of A24 falsely advertising their movies. When the trailers for Hereditary dropped, I expected something significantly different to what the movie was actually like. So much so, that I vehemently refused to watch this movie until Molly told me it was her favorite. The film is more of a drama than a horror movie, for the most part. It was well-written and well-acted with intentional and well-done scares. Shocking and unsettling scenes strengthen the movie throughout, not allowing viewers to relax, even during slower sections. Overall, this was a great movie and extremely effective as both a drama and a thrilling horror piece.\n\nPatrick’s Pick: ‘The Shining’\n\nAll work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. All work and no play – just kidding. The Shining is a true horror staple, but a definite slow-burn by modern standards. The unsettling nature of the film is still strong, but I will say after you’ve seen it once, the reveals all land just a little different. For horror fans looking for the same eeriness and nostalgia, I recommend The Shining’s spiritual successor, Doctor Sleep.\n\nTrevor’s Pick: ‘The Hills Have Eyes’\n\nWith an original directed by Wes Craven – the creator of horror icons like Freddy Krueger and Ghostface – the remake definitely had big boots to fill. Unfortunately, the movie seemed a few sizes too small. The gore and poor writing make it obvious that this movie came after the start of the Saw franchise, which revolutionized the way torture could be shown on the big screen. The character choices in this film mimicked others of the early 2000s – incoherent and convenient for the plot. The Hills Have Eyes also suffers from the classic horror movie plague: My-characters-have-no-redeeming-qualities Disorder. If you’re into movies with no substance but a lot of gore, this one’s for you.\n\nSophie’s Pick: ‘Us’\n\nOne of my ultimate horror movie fears is human mimicry, meaning that the thing looks human, but you can tell something isn’t right. So you can imagine my reaction to a second Jordan Peele movie based entirely on a similar premise. It’s more of a psychological horror than a Saw-esque horror film of modern times. The acting and writing in this movie feels genuine, meaning that the characters have depth that’s become uncommon nowadays and lets viewers become attached to characters. For those of you who aren’t into movies based on gore and torture, Us is a film for you."
