It had only one Mass on Sunday once a month celebrated by Fr. I.G. Selb who was the assistant priest in Minster. The church was served by the Society of Precious Blood until 1894. The building was then sold in 1907 and is now used as a worship center for Faith Alliance. Read Full Article\n\nIn 1847, Nativity parish was formed. They built a small log chapel called Maria—Kapelle directly west of the present church. In 1858, a new brick church was built across the road from the log chapel, where the present day church is standing. In June 1888, a fire almost destroyed the church. The four walls were all that remained. The church was rebuilt and opened in March 1889. In 1914, it was decided to enlarge the church by digging a basement to the south and erect a sacristy above it.

Not until October 1894 did the Chickasaw people join the Catholic March by building a 60x30x16 ft. “chapel (hall)”. Sometime in the spring of 1895, a petition was made to the Archbishop for a chapel, giving as a reason that some of the elderly would like to go to Mass during the week. In the “Chapel of Ease” (hall), Mass was one or two days a week, but no service was allowed on Sundays or Holy Days. The first Mass was on Friday, October 11, 1895 at 8am. On Sundays they attended St. Sebastian or nearby parishes. Farmers drove their horse and buggies. Townspeople walked.

It is to be the story of the people of God living out their faith. It must tell of their struggles and failures, of their vitality, and of the fruit they bear. Saint John Chrysostom has said that, “If you desire to know the nature of a peoples' faith, then go into their church and observe the art. A measure of the fruitfulness of this parish is hopefully evident the beauty of its church.” Read Full Article\n\nThe first three immigrant families to settle in the St. John area arrived from the Oldenburg area of Germany near Hanover via Stallostown (Minster) on October 13, 1833. The first order of business was to name their new settlement. Being a religious and practical lot, as the three men of the little party all shared the first name of John and the new Archbishop of Cincinnati installed that same day was The Rev. John Purcell, the name St. John the Baptist was solemnly chosen as the community/parish name. The hard work of clearing the land, building structures, and planting a crop ensued.

St. Joseph Parish traces its origin to August 14, 1852, when Cincinnati Archbishop John Purcell granted Egypt's residents permission to establish a church in their community. The first church was built due east of the present-day St. Joseph Cemetery, in the southeast corner of Egypt Pike and today's St. Rt. 364, on land belonging to John Heitman. (Today it is the current Tony and Tammy Heitbrink farm.)

Religious services were held in a farmhouse. The first place of worship was built on the north side of now State Route 119 in 1839. The first log church was erected in 1844 on the south side of the road. On November 24, 1844, the little log church was dedicated, and the cemetery was blessed. In August 1851, it was decided to build a bigger church. On August 15, 1852, the cornerstone for the new church was laid and blessed. The church would be 76 feet long and 42 feet wide with two doors at the front and two aisles leading to the altar. This was later changed to one door in the front.

This was really hard because of only having mud roads at that time. A committee of 4, Albert Stammen, Adam Gerlach, Herman Schwieterman & John Will went to Chickasaw to see if a church could be built in the area. However, the Chickasaw people turned them down. Discouraged, the committee headed home through the woods until they came to a spot which is now St. Sebastian Cemetery and John Will thrust his cane in the ground and exclaimed “Here the church will be built if permission is granted”. The next spring, Bishop Purcell gave them permission to build a church. They soon cut trees and had it sawed for the church building. Read Full Article"
