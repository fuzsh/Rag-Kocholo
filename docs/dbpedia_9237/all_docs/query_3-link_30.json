        "text": "Bremen is a city-state and officially known as the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen which is the second largest city in Northern Germany after Hamburg. It is on the banks of the beautiful River Weser that joins the North Sea. Bremen is called the Hanseatic city because it was a significant member of the Hanseatic League. Let’s understand what it is. The Hanseatic League was a powerful alliance of merchant guilds and market towns that dominated trade along the coast of Northern Europe during the Late Middle Ages and the Early Modern period. Hamburg and Lübeck were also essential members of this league. Hence these cities have a long trading history hosting the biggest seaports in Germany. They played a crucial role in the economic and cultural development of Northern Europe during that time. You can enjoy a nice evening walk along the River Weser on Burgermeister-Smidt-Bridge towards the direction of Neustadt. Also, the Port of Bremen along with the Port of Bremerhaven is the second largest in Germany after the Port of Hamburg. Hence, spending an evening along Schlachte is a must when you visit Bremen. You can stay overnight on hotel ships, and watch comedies on the theatre ship. In addition to this, there is a Bremen Overseas Museum (Übersee-Museum Bremen) if you want to know about Natural History.\n\nBremen is a city that can be explored on a small budget. I chose the Meininger Hotel near Bremen Hauptbahnhof (Train station) for my two nights of stay. It is very obvious in my travel that I first start by visiting the city center. So, the first destination on my map was to head to Bremen Market Square (locals call it Gute Stube which means good room or parlor). It was getting ready for the biggest festival of winter — Christmas (Weihnachten). The Bremen City Hall (seat of the President of the Senate and Mayor of Bremen) and the Bremen Roland (statue dedicated to Roland, the first Holy Roman Emperor) are UNESCO World Heritage Sites that are present in the market square. The Beggar that appears in the story of the first documented Bremen woman Countless Emma can be seen on Roland statue. Other monuments here are Bremen Cathedral (dedicated to St. Peter), Schütting (a house of the Bremen merchants), and Town Musicians of Bremen. You can also find many shopping passages here like LLOYD PASSAGE (feels like Hollywood and it is a high-end shopping in the heart of Bremen), Am Wall, Obernstraẞe, and Sögestraẞe.\n\nRoland statue is known as Bremen’s “Statue of Liberty” because it has been a symbol of trading rights and freedom since 1404. The next interesting spot is Bremer Loch — Hole of Bremen. It is a manhole cover next to the Bürgerschaft that has been converted into a donation box. You will receive the sound of one of the four town musicians when you insert a coin.\n\nI enjoy walking so much but I visited Bremen in November and it was extremely windy and rainy. Nevertheless, I did walk around the city struggling to hold my umbrella against the wind. As I was doing this, I discovered the famous — ‘Bremen Town Musicians’. It serves as a tribute to the popular fairytale by the Brothers Grimm, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm. It is so popular that references can be found in various mediums such as German Opera, Muppets, Anime by Tezuka. The fairytale goes as follows:\n\n“The tale of four aging farm animals — a donkey, a dog, a cat, and a rooster — who, feeling old and useless on their respective farms, decide to embark on a journey to the city of Bremen to become musicians. On their way to Bremen, they come across a cottage in the woods occupied by robbers. The animals, using their collective wit and making a ruckus, frighten the robbers away. Finding the house empty, the animals settle down there, content with their new home.”\n\nEnjoying this fairy tale, I headed to Market Hall Eight which is a food court that has street food from Mexico, Indian cuisine, Ukrainian, Ghana, and many more cuisines in the same place. These kinds of places are quite rare to find, so definitely pay a visit for your lunch or dinner and enjoy a wide variety of choices.\n\nWalking in the rain across the street, I ended up in a beautiful quarter — Schnoor Viertel. Fishermen and sailors used to live here. The shops here include handicrafts, jewelry, antiques, and souvenirs from Bremen. “Schnoor” is the Low German (Low German, also known as Low Saxon, is a West Germanic language spoken mainly in northern Germany, particularly in areas along the North Sea coast and the Baltic Sea and parts of the Netherlands. It’s one of the major branches of the Germanic languages. However, over time, its usage declined as High German became more prevalent in writing and formal settings) word for “cord/string” as the houses are strung like pearls on a string. You can also find a Christmas shop (about 20 years old) called Weihnachtstraeume here. I found a few cafes named after cats like Katzen Cafe and Katzen Temple but there were no cats inside it. I accidentally discovered a beautiful Jungle Shop Exhibition with just 1 Euro entry ticket that will take you to a different world with its decoration and relevant music in the background. You can also purchase items here. Though I could not visit ‘Bremer Geschichtenhaus (Bremen Story House)’ in Schnoor, it seems interesting based on what I read. Because, unlike other museums, here Bremen’s city history is vividly presented by famous Bremen personalities dressed in period costumes. If you are in Bremen and can understand German (assuming the show is in German only), give it a visit. I went to a cafe after this to regain some energy.\n\nAfter a hot cup of coffee at Creamlovers cafe, I headed to Böttcherstrasse (Böttcher in German means Cooper). The houses here are made of brick with the Paula Modersohn-Becker (the first museum in the world to be dedicated to the work of a female painter) Museum and the Ludwig Roselius Museum located here. You can find a gilded bronze (Lightbringer) above the entrance of this street. This “Street of the Coopers” was transformed from old medieval foundations into a unique work of art by the Bremen coffee merchant Ludwig Roselius. I also discovered a beautiful Christmas shop (Weihnachts Shop)here.\n\nIn the evening, you can head to the Bürgerpark which is Bremen’s largest contiguous park. Another suggestion is to visit the Universum Bremen which is an interactive science museum. Since I have visited a similar one in Groningen, I did not go to this. The other oldest street is Sögestrasse (Söge means ‘sow’) and pigs used to be driven through the street and pigs gobbled up waste from the bakers and brewers. If you have time and interest, plan to go to a nearby city of Bremerhaven which is popular for its Maritime Museum (display of objects relating to ships and travel on large bodies of water) and Klimahaus (scientific exhibition center).\n\nLast but not least, don’t forget to try fish in Bremen as it is a port city, you will get really fresh fish with remoulade sauce. The dessert local to Bremen is Bremer Klutten a rectangle-shaped gingerbread-like cookie covered in dark chocolate. The name “Kluten” refers to the rough surface of the chocolate coating. Kohl und Pinkel is a traditional dish of Bremen with Kohl referring to cabbage and pinkel is a smoked sausage. Another Bremen-style feast is Bremer Knipp, a local sausage served with pickles and crispy fried potatoes."
