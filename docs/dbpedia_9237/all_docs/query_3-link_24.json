        "text": "Constructor University is based in the north of Bremen – a city with a maritime atmosphere and 1,200 years of history. About half a million people live in Bremen, it is easy to get around the city, which has a high quality of living. The historical market square is famous for Bremen’s mascots, the Town Musicians from the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. More than 30,000 students live and study in Bremen and nearby Bremerhaven which together form the Bundesland (state) Bremen.\n\nThere are many restaurants, pubs, clubs, museums, theaters, and other venues to explore in the city. Bremen is home to the Freimarkt, Germany‘s oldest funfair, and the traditional Christmas market is a popular destination not just for locals. The Schlachte area along the Weser River and the Viertel quarter are known for their vibrant nightlife. Bremen boasts a great cultural life with theater plays, concerts, festivals, or flea markets. You can enjoy the great outdoors, head down to the river Weser in the summer, or catch a band at one of the many clubs and music venues in town.\n\nStudents can go on excursions throughout the region. Centrally located in Europe, Bremen is an ideal starting point for trips to destinations such as Hamburg, Berlin, Paris, Rome, Brussels, or Amsterdam, to name but a few. Bremen is also the only German city that has an international airport located within a ten-minute car ride of the city center."
