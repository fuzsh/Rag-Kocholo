        "text": "The þing (assembly) is a pretty well-documented phenomenon, at least as far as these things go. In the context of ninth-century Scandinavia, we have both external and internal written sources attesting to it, which is pretty spectacular. Both of them, moreover, give some insight into the functions these assemblies could have. The Forsa ring, from Hälsingland in central Sweden, refers to the assembly’s role in making laws; the Vita Anskarii, written in the later ninth century by Archbishop Rimbert of Hamburg-Bremen, describes how assemblies played a role in political decision-making, to the point where the Swedish kings were constrained by the decisions of regional assemblies. What happened, then, outside Scandinavia?\n\nFair warning at the start here: I’m writing this in my flat on a scorching hot Saturday. What that means is that I really don’t want to go into town to pick up the resources I need to write the blog posts nominally further up the agenda, and that in turn means that I’m going to write something which I can do without leaving the house. That, in its own turn, means that you’re getting something a bit more out there, a bit less well thought-through than usual. With a new project, I’ve been a bit cautious about putting really sketchy draft work online so that the bits of it people can access don’t look half-assed or insane. This week, I’ll take the risk…\n\nSo, viking assemblies. Of note to begin with is that we have references to assemblies from almost all over the viking sphere of influence from quite early on. The main exception is the Insular world. Ireland has the better evidence, sort of. Here there are late tenth-century references to a ‘law-speaker’ of Dublin and an early eleventh-century reference to an assembly in the town. This doesn’t prove any kind of continuity with the ninth century – the putative site of the Dublin þing has been argued to have been an important symbolic focus for the town from that early, but that doesn’t exclude the possibility it was co-opted by an assembly which was a later development. Nonetheless, we do at least have references to assemblies in Dublin c. 1000. By contrast, I really haven’t found much in the English evidence, with one important exception. The eleventh-century Historia de Sancto Cuthberto describes how King Guthred of Northumbria was acclaimed as king on a mound by the assembled army and people of the region. No specific term is used to describe it, but an assembly is at least implied. (Moreover, in the case of England an absence of evidence is what I’d expect – sources associated with the West Saxon court tend to be aggressively uninterested in the internal organisation of viking polities, I suspect to deny them the legitimacy of actually being a polity…)\n\nIn Rus’, by contrast, evidence is relatively abundant. The Vita Basilii, a life of Emperor Basil I, refers to a missionary bishop amongst the Rus’ demonstrating the superiority of Christianity to the ruler and his elders by performing a miracle in their assembly. A lengthy vignette in the Histories of Leo the Deacon describes the Rus’ ruler Sviatoslav convening his men in an assembly to decide how to end the siege of Dorostolon (modern Silistra). Notably, Leo calls the assembly a komenton (χομέντον), which he says is what the Rus’ call it. This is interesting if true, because it appears to be the Latin word conventus…\n\nEven more worthy of note is the also-good evidence for assemblies amongst viking armies on the move. The Annals of Saint-Vaast describe the Great Army in the West Frankish kingdom holding an assembly (facere placitum) to decide their next move in 884, after they have received the tribute which King Carloman II had promised them. Similar accounts can be found in the Vita Sancti Findani, written in modern-day Switzerland but by Irish monks, and the Liber Miraculorum Sancti Bertini.\n\nThis is a remarkable consistent set of behaviours, and it suggests first of all that this is a political practice exported from Scandinavia. There are a couple of objections which could be lodged, however. The first is that it’s not 100% clear this is a universal behaviour within Scandinavia. Scandinavian archaeologists are keen to suggest assembly sites attested later are much older than their first attestation, and whilst I don’t have any theoretical problem with this I haven’t yet read around widely enough to endorse it myself at this moment. Certainly, our written evidence has a strongly Swedish tilt. Descriptions of assembly practice in the Danish kingdom are not quite absent, but at minimum they are potentially suggestive of fairly hefty differences in assembly practice. I won’t deal with this problem any further right now, but it’s worth keeping in mind.\n\nThe second objection is that, if you use a broad definition, assembly practice is almost universal everywhere. (This, for instance, is certainly not the first time we’ve discussed the subject on the blog.) In both England and the Carolingian world, assemblies were a foundational element in political life; and the same is true in the Steppe world, where writers such as Bruno of Querfurt have left us vivid descriptions of Petcheneg assemblies which cannot possibly derive from Northman practice. To paraphrase a book review I read, taking a broad-brush view of assembly practice leaves you with the result of ‘Group X held meetings to decide things’…\n\nSo do these assemblies have any kind of distinctive character? I think a few elements can be drawn out. At the moment, I’m teaching a class on ‘Places of Power in the Ottonian World’, and Ottonian assemblies, which are heavily stage-managed, extremely hierarchical events are a useful point of contrast. The assemblies we see in these viking polities are much more palpably deliberative. Decision-making at assemblies can’t be taken for granted (we know in the Carolingian and Ottonian realms most of it happens behind closed doors), so the fact that groups have what seems a much more open forum to deliberate in is quite significant. (And, of course, fits with the Vita Rimberti.) Similarly, these assemblies are quite flat. Northman societies in general are not distinguished by elaborate hierarchies, but in these sources the closest we get to a distinction within the assembly is the Vita Basilii’s distinction between ‘subjects’ (ῠ̔πήκοοι, hypikooi) and ‘elders’ (γέροντες, gerontes) (although the Liber Miraculorum’s references to ‘lords’ and ‘courtiers’ (seniores and curiales [!]) might preserve something of this, and Leo the Deacon’s reference to an ‘assembly of nobles’ (βουλὴν τῶν ἀρίστων, boulin ton ariston) gives us grounds for suspicion that these were in any case relatively elite events). In general, it is the body of the polity – the army, the people, the multitude, and so on – who do the deliberating. Similarly, there is very limited evidence that these are monarchical bodies. Sviatoslav’s role in convening the Dorostalon assembly is unusual in this regard. Normally, they are presented as a venue for collective leadership, even when – as in the case of the Historia de Sancto Cuthberto – selecting one person as their ruler.\n\nNonetheless, they do, I think, play a legitimising role. There is evidence that these were held at important places. Dublin is the obvious case here, but the acclamation of Guthred of Northumbria on Oswigesdune could also be cited. So too, more intriguingly, could the Liber Miraculorum – the assembly described there took place not in the open air, but in the church of Saint-Pierre at Saint-Omer, a place presumably chosen to lend some grandeur to the event. Hints of ritual come through, and certainly of public performance. Again, Oswigesdune is a case in point. Guthred, according to the Historia, was a slave-boy chosen as king by a vision which God granted to Abbot Eadred of Carlisle. This is very unlikely to be true, but what is likely to be true is that Guthred’s acclamation marked the point where the Christian community and religious elites of Northumbria found a modus vivendi with the Northman conquerors. In this context, such assemblies might have more than they seem in common with their Ottonian counterparts. Timothy Reuter described assemblies as constitutive of the Ottonian polity. The same might well be true in the viking world, whether than polity was kingdom, khanate, or army."
