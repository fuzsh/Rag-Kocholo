        "text": "Bremen Cathedral, dedicated to St. Peter, is a church in Bremen, northern Germany, located in the market square. The Bremian Evangelical Church, a member of the Protestant umbrella organization Evangelical Church in Germany, owns the cathedral. It is the old Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen's proto-cathedral. It has been protected by the Monument Protection Act since 1973.\n\nUnderneath the nave lies a remarkable \"Bleikeller,\" or lead basement, which had a reputation even before the Reformation as a great place to keep the bodies of the deceased in amazing condition. There are eight mummies in glass-topped coffins there. Two Swedish officers from the Thirty Years' War, an English countess, a slain student, and a local poor are among those on show, according to the display. For more than 300 years, the crypt has been the cathedral's most popular feature.\n\nSince 1526, Bremen has had a long tradition of great organ music. The main organ was built by Arp Schnitger, one of the most prominent organ builders of the Baroque period, from 1698 until 1843. The Schulze organ and eventually the Wilhelm Sauer organ, one of the largest in northwest Germany, were its replacements. Today, the cathedral features five organs located throughout the building, continuing a long legacy of magnificent organs and organists.\n\nThe north tower and the south tower are twin 99-meter towers of the cathedral. Between 1215 and 1253, the towers flanking the main entrance gate on the west front of the church were built. The towers were strengthened in 1346, and pyramidal tops of varying heights were added. The towers were given Rhenish \"helmets\" when they were renovated and raised in the 1890s, which are still on the towers today. The south tower can be climbed for a perspective of the city. The north tower is still shut down. The crossing tower is reminiscent of the west front towers' original form, which featured a pyramidal cap.\n\nSome advice before planning a trip to Bremen Cathedral: Christian churches — whether Protestant, Orthodox, or Catholic – are an important part of Europe's cultural, artistic, architectural, and religious heritage, so you'll probably see a lot of them. However, the majority of them are still major tourist attractions and religious locations where people gather to pray today.\n\nThis is something to be respected, and the following are some suggestions:\n\n▪ Dress modestly, covering shoulders and the most of your legs (women in Orthodox churches may be asked to cover their heads)\n\n▪ Do not speak aloud - all of the descriptions should be read quietly or delivered outside\n\n▪ During the service, try not to walk too much\n\n▪ Avoid using flash in your camera near people you see praying\n\n▪ Respect notes prohibit entry to some areas of the church that are reserved for prayer exclusively\n\nBY MUHAMMAD SHAHZAIB TAHIR AWAN (PAKISTAN) | CLASS OF 2022"
