        "text": "State in Germany\n\nState in Germany\n\nBremen (German: [ˈbʁeːmən] ⓘ), officially the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen (German: Freie Hansestadt Bremen; Low German: Free Hansestadt Bremen), is the smallest and least populous of Germany's 16 states. It is informally called Land Bremen ('State of Bremen'), although the term is sometimes used in official contexts. The state consists of the city of Bremen and its seaport exclave, Bremerhaven, surrounded by the larger state of Lower Saxony in northern Germany.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nThe state of Bremen consists of two non-contiguous territories. These enclaves contain Bremen, officially the 'City' (Stadtgemeinde Bremen) which is the state capital, and the city of Bremerhaven (Stadt Bremerhaven). Both are located on the River Weser; Bremerhaven (\"Bremen's harbour\") is further downstream on the mouth of the Weser with open access to the North Sea. Both enclaves are completely surrounded by the neighbouring State of Lower Saxony (Niedersachsen). The highest point in the state is in Friedehorst Park (32.5 metres; 107').\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1806, what had been since 1646 (after earlier privileges of autonomy of 1186) the Free Imperial City of Bremen was not mediatised. Rather than being incorporated into the enlarged territory of one of the surrounding monarchies, it was recognised (along with Hamburg) as a sovereign Free Hanseatic City. Its currency until 1873 was the Bremen thaler.\n\nIn 1811, in an effort to enforce Napoleon's Berlin Decree embargoing Britain, the First French Empire had annexed the city-state. But at the Congress of Vienna of 1815, Bremen's emissary, and later burgomaster, Johann Smidt, lobbied successfully to have the city's independence restored as one of the 39 sovereign states within the new German Confederation.\n\nIn 1827, Bremen bought land at the mouth of the Weser from the Kingdom of Hanover, in order to build a new seaport, Bremerhaven. This ensured that Bremen remained Germany's main port of embarkation for emigrants to the Americas, and that it developed as an entrepôt for Germany's late developing colonial trade.\n\nIn 1867, the year following Prussia's defeat of Austria and its annexation of Hanover, Bremen joined the North German Confederation. In 1871, following victory over the French, this became the German Empire with Bremen as one of the Reich's 26 constituent states.\n\nAs an international port and industrial centre, Bremen had a strong left and liberal tradition. In January 1913, at the last elections to the Imperial Reichstag in Berlin, the Social Democrats (SPD) secured over half the vote, or 53.4%. Left Liberals (Linksliberale) took another 41.4%. Only 5.1% went to the Conservatives.[4] During the Weimar Republic, there were seven elections to the Burgerschaft, the Bremen parliament. At the November 1932 German federal election, the last broadly free election during this time, the Social Democrats won 31.2% of the vote, and the Communists (KPD) 16.8%, compared to 20.8% for the Nazis.[5][6]\n\nFollowing the heavily compromised national elections of March 1933, the Nazis still achieved only a third of the popular vote in Bremen (32.7%).[5] Bremen, like all the German states, then underwent the process of Gleichschaltung (coordination) whereby the Nazi regime, through a campaign of violent demonstrations and intimidation, first forced the resignation of the executive Senate and later dissolved the Bürgerschaft. Bremen remained for the next twelve years under the direct authority of a Reichsstatthalter (Reich Governor) who simultaneously held the post of Nazi Party Gauleiter of Gau Weser-Ems. During these years, Bremen's small Jewish community (1,438 people registered at the beginning of 1933)[7] was destroyed through coerced emigration and deportation to death camps in the occupied east.\n\nAllied bombing during World War II destroyed or severely damaged 60% of the city's built fabric, including much of its historic centre. Following a further bombardment, British troops entered Bremen in late April 1945. Transferred to the Americans, Bremen became the supply port for the US zones of occupation in west Berlin and southern Germany.\n\nThe city was reestablished as a state in 1947 and, from 1949, was again known as the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, becoming a Land or state of the new Federal Republic of Germany, informally referred to as \"West Germany\" until 1990.\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nPolitical system\n\n[edit]\n\nThe legislature of the state of Bremen is the 87-member Bürgerschaft (citizens' assembly), elected by the citizens in the two cities of Bremen and Bremerhaven.\n\nThe executive is constituted by the Senate of Bremen, elected by the Bürgerschaft. The Senate is chaired by the President of the senate (Senatspräsident), who is also one of the mayors of the city of Bremen (Bürgermeister) and is elected directly by the Bürgerschaft. The Senate selects of its members as a second mayor who serves as deputy of the president. In contrast to the Federal Chancellor of Germany or other German states, the President of the Senate has no authority to override senators on policy, which is decided upon by the senate collectively. Since 1945, the Senate has continuously been dominated by the Social Democratic Party.\n\nOn a municipal level, the two cities in the state are administered separately:\n\nThe administration of the city of Bremen is headed by the two mayors and controlled by the portion of the Bürgerschaft elected in the city of Bremen (72 members).\n\nBremerhaven, on the other hand, has a municipal assembly distinct from the state legislature and an administration under a distinct head mayor (Oberbürgermeister) and a distinct second mayor.\n\nPolitical majorities\n\n[edit]\n\nIn post-war Bremen, the port, shipyards and related industries sustained a large and unionised working class. As before 1933, this translated into support for the Social Democrats, considered Bremen's natural governing party. However, in the 1980s mechanisation of the port and closure of the city's leading shipbuilder induced an employment crisis and shook the confidence of the party's traditional voter base. The SPD, which had still polled 51% in 1987, lost its effective majority.[9] The once dominant left-liberal vote split, and coalition government became the norm.\n\nThe 2019 Bremen state election was held on 26 May 2019 to elect the members of the Bürgerschaft of Bremen, as well as the city councils of Bremen and Bremerhaven. The election took place on the same day as the 2019 European Parliament election.[10][11][12] The Christian Democratic Union (CDU), for the first time, became the largest party in the Bürgerschaft, while the Social Democratic Party (SPD) fell to second place. The Greens and The Left made small gains. After the election, the SPD, Greens, and Left agreed to form a coalition government. Carsten Sieling resigned as mayor and was replaced by fellow SPD member Andreas Bovenschulte.[13][14]\n\nSummary of the 26 May 2019 election results for the Bürgerschaft of Bremen Party Votes % +/- Seats Total\n\nseats +/- Seats % Bremen Bremerhaven Christian Democratic Union (CDU) 391,709 26.7 4.3 20 4 24 4 28.6 Social Democratic Party (SPD) 366,375 24.9 7.9 19 4 23 7 27.4 Alliance 90/The Greens (Grüne) 256,181 17.4 2.3 13 3 16 2 19.0 The Left (Linke) 166,378 11.3 1.8 9 1 10 2 11.9 Alternative for Germany (AfD) 89,939 6.1 0.6 4 1 5 1 6.0 Free Democratic Party (FDP) 87,420 5.9 0.7 4 1 5 1 6.0 Citizens in Rage (BiW) 35,808 2.4 0.8 0 1 1 0 1.2 Die PARTEI (PARTEI) 24,433 1.7 0.2 0 0 0 ±0 0 Free Voters (FW) 14,205 1.0 1.0 0 0 0 ±0 0 Pirate Party Germany (Piraten) 14,143 1.0 0.5 0 0 0 ±0 0 Others 22,915 1.6 0 0 0 ±0 0 Total 1,469,506 100.0 69 15 84 1 Voter turnout 64.1 13.9\n\nCoat of arms\n\n[edit]\n\nThe coat of arms and flag of Bremen state include:\n\nFlag of Bremen\n\nGreater coat of arms\n\nMedium coat of arms\n\nLesser coat of arms\n\nCoat of arms symbol\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nBremen's post-World War II economy boomed in line with the West German Wirtschaftswunder of the 1950s and 60s. This saw the growth, and permanent settlement, in Bremen of a large migrant worker population, drawn largely from Turkey and southern Europe.\n\nSome of the city's heavier industries failed to recover from the oil-price-shock recession of the early 1970s. Specialist construction yards, ship outfitters and parts suppliers remain, but AG Weser (which employed 16,000 workers at its peak) and Bremer Vulcan, Bremen's major shipbuilders, closed in 1983 and 1997 respectively. Further job losses were caused by the restructuring and increasing mechanisation of harbour-related activities and other industrial sectors. Semi and unskilled harbour workers found it very difficult to re-enter the labour market, and unemployment—for a period in the 1980s almost double the West German average—remained comparatively high.\n\nAt a time when structural change in the economy has forced Bremen to spend more on social services, suburbanisation has reduced population and tax revenue. Incorporating surrounding suburban municipalities, is not an option for Bremen as these belong to the state of Lower Saxony.[15]\n\nWith financial assistance from the European Union, and from the Federal Government, economic policy has focused on supporting those established economic sectors that are based on advanced technology, such as aerospace and aircraft production, automobile production, maritime and logistics services, and on developing the education and business-park infrastructure for new science-based and digital enterprises. In this an important role is accorded to the growing university sector. Further investment went into the revitalisation of the city centre but a culture-driven regeneration around entertainment and tourism was not very successful. Several experts described Bremen's service sector as underdeveloped, due to a lack of major company headquarters.[15]\n\nUnemployment\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the turn of the new century, unemployment in Bremen stood at 13%, a rate matched in the Federal Republic only by the \"new states\" in former East Germany. By 2022, while reduced to 10.2% it was the highest among all 16 German states.[16]\n\nYear[17] 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Unemployment rate in % 13.0 12.4 12.5 13.2 13.2 16.8 14.9 12.7 11.4 11.8 12.0 11.6 11.2 11.1 10.9 10.9 10.5 10.2 9.8 9.9 11.2 10.7\n\nIndustries\n\n[edit]\n\nDespite historic job losses in the industrial sector, Bremen State has retained, and continues to develop, a broad manufacturing base:\n\nAutomotive with Mercedes-Benz factory, which is main manufacturing base of C-Class (12,500 employees). Automotive components from Hella and Lear. Assembly lines for powertrain and batteries are supplied from ThyssenKrupp Automation Engineering.\n\nAerospace with Airbus aircraft component factories (4,100 employees), rocket components Ariane (550 empl.) and spacecraft OHB (1,200 empl.)\n\nIron & Steel with large ArcelorMittal work (3,000 employees);\n\nElectronic manufacturers for naval/marine Atlas Elektronik (1,400 employees) and defence Rheinmetall Defence Electronics (1,200 employees)\n\nShipbuilding represented Lürssen Bremen features the full spectrum of construction, production and assembly facilities for superyachts greater than 100 in length (1,200 employees).\n\nFood manufacturing of coffee (Kraft, Jacobs, Melitta, Eduscho, Azul), chocolate (Hachez), beer (Beck's Brewery), cereal food (Kellogg's), fish (Frosta, Frozen Fish, Deutsche See), dairy products (DMK Deutsches Milchkontor), pet food (Vitacraft)\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe University of Bremen is the largest university in Bremen. It is one of 11 institutions classed as an \"Elite university\" in Germany, and teaches approximately 23,500 people from 126 countries. Bremen also has a University of the Arts Bremen, a University of Applied Sciences with campuses in both Bremen city and Bremerhaven, and more recently the Jacobs University Bremen, an international research university located in Vegesack.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nGermany portal\n\nEurope portal\n\nGeography portal\n\nBombing of Bremen in World War II\n\nFormer countries in Europe after 1815\n\nTimeline of Bremen (city) history\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
