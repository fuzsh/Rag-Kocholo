        "text": "Bremen is considered to be one of the most charming cities in Germany and I couldn’t agree more. If you’re unsure of whether to visit Bremen or not, I hope this article will convince you to do so. Bremen is not only charming, but it is also cute with a splendid old town, museums and greenery throughout the city. It is a city that has left a huge impression on me and has me planning my next trip there.\n\nNot only is Bremen a charming city, but it is also one of the 16 federal states in Germany. It is the 10th largest city and the 11th most popular in the country with only 500,000 inhabitants. Bremen city lies along the Weser River which is located in the North Western region of Germany. In this article, we hope to share reasons why Bremen is a charming city from a first-timer’s perspective.\n\nHow To Get Around Bremen\n\nThough Bremen is not a large city in comparison to Berlin, there is a distance between the north and south of the city. Regardless the city has great public transport system from buses, trams to taxis which are all affordable. The distance between the main station and the city centre is just 1 kilometre which is a walkable distance.\n\nIf you’re arriving via plane, the airport is about 6 kilometres away from the main station. Whilst taxis are cheap, tram #6 (direction university) is about 25+ minutes away. For €2.40 you can buy a single ticket to the main station although its free if you have the Bremen City Card.\n\nWhere to Stay in Bremen\n\nWhen it comes to booking accommodation, I always want to find affordable places near the city centre. Though I am not opposed to staying outside the city if there are cheaper options available. But since Bremen is a small city, I found several accommodation types that I considered and which I chose.\n\nAs a solo traveller, I often opt to stay in places where I can mingle with fellow travellers. This is why I often choose hostels as it’s a great way to meet people and is very affordable. I chose to stay at the A&O hostel Bremen Hauptbahnhof.\n\nHotels are great if I indeed to work during the evenings and therefore would recommend The Best Western Hotel. This hotel is located across the Main Station which is a perfect location and to its left is the Universum Bremen. The city has only one 5* hotel Dorint Park hotel, it is another place to consider for a luxury stay.\n\nWhere to Eat in Bremen\n\nWhilst I wouldn’t consider myself to be a true foodie, I do enjoy trying the local cuisines. Bremen is full of incredible eateries dotted around the city and more around the market square. During my visit, I was able to try a couple of places which I loved.\n\nCTK´s in the Obernstraße has the best French and sweet potato fries I have ever had. I had never tried wasabi sauce until I visited CTK’s and now I want it with all my French fries.\n\nIf you want to truly try the best Bremen cuisines then I would recommend visiting the Bremer Ratskeller a restaurant beneath the town hall. There I enjoyed the most delicious wine I had ever tried and this says a lot. I am not big on wine and rarely drink it but I had two glasses with my meal.\n\nAnother restaurant that was recommended to me but did not get a chance to eat at is The Lobby Restaurant. This is located inside Radisson Blu Hotel and I have heard nothing but praise. Next time I am in town it’s one place I definitely want to enjoy lunch at.\n\nBremen Sightseeing|Charming Areas\n\nBremen is an old city with over 1,200 years of history and the charm lies in the ‘old’. Though the city is small, there is an abundance of charming things to sightsee all around the city. For the purpose of this article, I want to focus on the areas I considered ‘charming’. All must visit places will be included in\n\nMarkplatz {Market Square}\n\nBremen Markplatz is the oldest public squares in the city and home to Hanseatic buildings surrounding the market square. It is the heart and a focal point of the city where you can sit and admire the city.\n\nRoland Statue\n\nThis is the largest Roland Statue in Germany and is a symbol of trading rights and freedom since 1404. Together with the town hall, they are received UNESCO heritage status back in 2004. The statue was erected back in 1404 after the previous version of it which was wooden.\n\nSt Peter’s Cathedral\n\nThe cathedral is 1200 years old and sits between the Rathus and the State Parliament buildings. Entrance to the cathedral is free and €1 for entering the tour open to visitors.\n\nRathaus {Town Hall}\n\nI have visited a few town halls across Germany and Europe and I must say this is the best one yet. It’s a UNESCO World Heritage site and a jewel in the crown of the historical market. Whist the town hall is open to guest, you have to book the guided tour and not open during official sessions.\n\nSchütting (Chamber of Commerce)\n\nThe Schütting building is also known as the Chamber of Commerce was built in 1537 by Johann den Buschener. Facing the Rathaus, the gorgeous merchant building housing the Chamber of Commerce speaks of Bremen economic status.\n\nSchnoor Quarter\n\nSchnoor is considered the old town of Bremen, it’s an area lined with narrow lanes and small houses. It is a must visit an area in the city filled with houses made around the 15th – 16th century. In this district, you can find the cutest cafes, craft shops and the narrowest lane in the city.\n\nBöttcherstrasse\n\nLocated opposite the town hall and to the right of the Chamber of Commerce, its the 110-metre long lane. It was built around 1920 and is known for its unusual architecture and its considered a cultural attraction. It is a nice and quaint area where you can find the best sweets in the city and souvenirs.\n\nI hope this first timer guide has convinced you Bremen is a charming city and lots to offer. Over the next few days, I will be sharing posts on this Bremen Getaway, Things to do and how to spend your time there."
