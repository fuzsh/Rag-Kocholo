        "text": "Bremen has a delightful old town. Next to the town hall is the statue of „Roland“, which the people of Bremen are very attached to. It’s a kind of statue of liberty and a symbol of justice and freedom. The „Schnoor district“ is full of tiny alleyways and narrow houses where you’ll find charming restaurants and boutiques. On „Schlachte“, a promenade along the river Weser, you can stroll past shops, cafés and bars while enjoying a view of the river. Small local festivals take place here every year.\n\nA beautiful path with bushes and lots of benches follows the river Weser. This is a great place for a stroll and for watching the moored ships, especially in the evenings. If you’re very quiet, you can hear animals rustling in the bushes. And if you’re lucky, you might even catch sight of a hedgehog scurrying past. You can go on a circular boat trip on the Weser. Whether you opt for a tour of the harbour or take a ferry to Oldenburg or Bremerhaven – there are many ways to get to know northern Germany by water.\n\nAs a student in Bremen, you’re bound to end up in the „Viertel“, a neighbourhood that attracts not just students but also lots of locals. This is where people of all ages and nationalities get together and share a sense of belonging. They spend an evening at their local. Many of the pubs and bars there have a quaint, traditionally Hanseatic flair. From steak house or doner kebab joint to a purely vegan restaurant, Bremen has everything the culinary heart desires, without costing a fortune.\n\nThe „Viertel“ is located in the districts of Ostertor and Steintor. Even if Bremen is considered a city – it doesn’t feel like it here."
