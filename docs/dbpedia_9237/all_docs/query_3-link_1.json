        "text": "Geography\n\nLocated at the first ford above the river estuary, the Old Town of Bremen grew on a sand dune, sited above flood level on the Weser spillway, the glacially widened river channel. The windblown sand accumulated, in the postglacial period, up to a height of 45 feet (15 metres) above the flat marshes and moors of the Bremer Becken (lowlands). Because of the effect of North Sea tides and of the high subterranean water level, 71 miles (114 km) of dikes, associated with a complicated drainage system, play an important role in the Bremen urban area. The dune—25 miles (40 km) long and 2 miles (3 km) wide—has thus decisively influenced the northward and southward expansion of the city. The territorial possessions of the city also include large sections of swampy cultivated lowlands and stretches along the Weser, which became associated with the rise of further smaller settlements. The gradual incorporation of these rural communities—which had always had close economic relations with Bremen—started in 1849 and in 1945 brought the administrative area of the city of Bremen to its contemporary size.\n\nBremen ranks among the largest cities in Germany. Its population growth since the 19th century has been linked closely with its economic development. World War II saw a decline in the war-torn city’s population, but it rose sharply with the extensive postwar reconstruction. The vast majority of Bremen’s citizens are Protestants.\n\nThe economic life of the state reflects the historical interconnection of shipping, foreign trade, and industry. The port facilities of Bremen and Bremerhaven, which, administratively and economically, form one unit, incorporate free-port status, whereby imported goods can be handled and stored without time limits and without customs formalities. Bremerhaven handles about one-fourth of the total tonnage of goods in the two ports, just over half of which is mixed cargo, the remainder being composed of such bulk goods as grain, coal, ore, and oil. The merchant fleet of Bremen consists of several hundred seagoing vessels and many barges. The city of Bremerhaven, which covers 31 square miles (80 square km), was founded as an outer port for Bremen because of the silting up of the lower Weser. Today the port of Bremerhaven is the home of a large fishing fleet.\n\nIn Hanseatic times Bremen’s importance rested almost entirely on its character as a trading centre and as a seaport for handling raw materials and foodstuffs. Since the end of the 18th century, the port has handled, in increasing quantities, grain, timber, coffee, tobacco, wool, and cotton. These items are processed by local firms, which are among the largest of their kind in the country.\n\nOriginally, the city’s entire industrial potential—except for food industries—depended upon the shipyards and their supporting firms. After 1900 the Bremen economy became increasingly diversified, supplying the internal market and ensuring sufficient freight for outward-sailing ships.\n\nSteel for the city’s shipbuilding industry comes from local steelworks. In addition, machine-building industries specialize in engines and equipment for ships and trucks and machinery for growth industries. The local aircraft industry constitutes a large part of the total German capacity. Production in the electrical industry ranges from industrial equipment to radio and television sets and modern electronic materials. Bremen also has many banks and insurance companies, a stock exchange, and cotton- and tobacco-marketing centres. The importance of its overseas connections is illustrated by the presence of consulates of dozens of countries. Warehouses, stores, and specialty shops also cater to people from the surrounding rural area, while imports and exports are dealt with by numerous shipping companies and agents.\n\nThe state’s constitution, adopted in 1947, placed the legislative power in the Bremen Bürgerschaft (parliament). The parliament elects the executive body (senate), which is composed of a president, who is one of the two mayors of the city of Bremen, and several senators. The legislature—which has members from Bremen and Bremerhaven—and the senate are elected every four years.\n\nPassenger trains and motorways link Bremen with the country’s major cities. Bremen airport offers domestic and international flights.\n\nThe city of Bremen is an interesting amalgam of medieval and modern architecture. The Gothic Town Hall, with its Renaissance facade, and the nearby statue of Roland (1404), symbolizing market rights and imperial jurisdiction, were designated a collective UNESCO World Heritage site in 2004. Other outstanding features in the Altstadt, or Old Town, in the restored heart of the city, are the famous marketplace with its 11th-century cathedral, a picturesque row of old gabled houses, and the modern-style Parliament. Districts heavily bombed in World War II (69 percent of the houses were destroyed) were replanned and rebuilt."
