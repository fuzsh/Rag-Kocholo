        "text": "Firstly, let me point out that when I say the challenge is to form Germany from the Hanseatic League, I actually mean the challenge is to form Germany from a Trading League which does not necessarily need to be the Hanseatic League. It's just that 'Hansa Germany' has more of a ring to it.\n\nThe original idea for this topic came from the old Map Continuation 3, where Northern Germany gradually consolidates into a single entity through a Hanseatic League turned alliance turned federation. I thought this kind of scenario would be very interesting to explore, including the politics of such an organisation and colonies being founded across the New World by a branch of a much larger trading league. It will likely be necessary to curtail the other Baltic powers, such as Sweden and Denmark, to allow the League room to shine. Of course, my knowledge of the Hansa itself is rather slim, so this is why I am asking the experts.\n\nYour challenge, should you accept it, is to create a German trading league that manages to eventually for an analogue for Germany. It must also be able to compete with the primary colonial powers in both the Occident and the Orient, although not necessarily directly. It doesn't necessarily need to become the dominant colonial power, just a relatively successful one. There is a PoD limit, it is not allowed to be earlier that 1200 AD and no later than 1700 AD.\n\nI know this challenge is difficult, and I'll probably get shouted at from some of the German members here, so you all are given leeway in terms of the birth this 'League' and its general success in unifying the whole of Germany. Anyway, enough of the chatter, what would you say would work best to achieve the challenge?\n\nSounds tough to me. The Hansa, or most other Unions of trading city-states/nations, have a couple of disadvantages. 1) they trade by water, so they're mostly coastal. Much of German is inland, and not an obvious choice for coalescing around a coastal 'state'. 2) a trading league is likely to be more interested in trade than warfare. How well can such a thing survive once Nation-States/large empires arise.\n\nA stronger, bigger, longer lasting Hansa would, I think be possible, but I'd think, it would more likely be a Baltic commercial empire than a nucleus for Germany....\n\nHmm... Novgorod, Riga, Kopenhagen (heck that's already 'Merchant's Harbour'), Amsterdam... Getting a colonial empire (even if it's largely city states, like the original) could be possible...\n\n1) they trade by water, so they're mostly coastal. Much of German is inland, and not an obvious choice for coalescing around a coastal 'state'.\n\nAt the climax of its power, the Hansa included cities well up to the \"waistline\" of Germany, like Cologne, Magdeburg, Frankfurt.\n\nI think the biggest issues with the Hansa is that for most of the time, especially in the later period,\n\nthe leading cities agreed on a relatively loose union, based on trading only;\n\nand that they strived to conserve the rules and institutions of the old Hansa with as\n\nfew modifications as possible. For instance, if you change this and let the Hansa\n\nembrace structures which are more effective in the day, you can maintain a certain\n\nrole of it with a PoD as late as 1600. A role as a trading club, that is.\n\nSo I am not sure what kind of state-building process you are aiming at.\n\nIndeed, a clearer explanation would be helpful. I am currently writing down ideas and twists for a timeline that is in development, when I say development I mean a list of ideas on MS Word for now, and one of them if a sort of 'German Colonial Company'. Essentially, the original aim was to have a sort of Hanseatic-like League/Company that would expand into the new world, not quite colonising to start with but land grabbing for profit. At the same time this company would be able to not only defend themselves against pirate raiders and the navies of minor nations, but retain its new holdouts in the Americas/India against rival nations.\n\nHowever, I found it rather difficult to envision a company such as this without having some form of unified German state to back it up, or else the other powers would likely gobble it up. That is why I set up this thread, to see if it were possible.\n\nThe Hansa also had a significant influence in non-German areas. Hansa cities at its heyday included London, Brüges, basically all important Danish cities, Visby and several other Swedish cities, Tallin (back then known as Reval) and Amsterdam.\n\nTrue, although the Dutch were considered German at that point in time I am looking at, and the eastern coast of the Baltic was run by the primarily German Teutonic Order. I wanted to see how much of all that territory you could acquire for the League-State.\n\nThe Hansa was able to maintain detachements in so many countries because\n\nit was apolitical. It also included cities which were under the formal rule of some prince.\n\nEssentially, the original aim was to have a sort of Hanseatic-like League/Company that would expand into the new world, not quite colonising to start with but land grabbing for profit.\n\nYou are right in seeing some possible chain of processes there.\n\nBut it seems a bit dangerous to jump so quickly between centuries.\n\nPerhaps you are going to found a second Netherlands, not necessarily\n\nseceeding from the Empire. The urban society and politics, the naval and commerical\n\nexpertise was pretty much comparable between the Netherlands and the\n\nbig Hansa cities in (the rest of) Germany. So there is definitely potential.\n\nBut how should the switch take place from commercial collaboration to political union?\n\nThe Hansa, even at the crest of its power, did not even hold the structures of a central\n\nauthority which would be necessary for larger political projects.\n\nOn the other hand, there are plenty of opportunities throughout history\n\nto extend or maintain Hansa power. For instance, rulers become dependant\n\non the Hansa because of large loan sums (e.g. Christian III. of Denmark\n\ncould become a lot more dependant than IOTL).\n\nA nice starting point, or helping effect, would also have Hansa cities taking grip\n\nof their surrounding rural areas; e.g. let Bremen have the archbishopric Bremen\n\nafter the reformation.\n\nBut these are just tiny steps, we still need the \"switch\".\n\nOne construction comes to my mind:\n\nFor some reason, other Hansa cities get jealous of the city ruling a territory.\n\nTo appease the fellow cities, Bremen implies a common rule of the Hansa council on\n\nthat country, as it is more important for the city to save the region from greedy princes\n\nthan to own it alone. This causes more political structure and unity in the Hansa.\n\nThe model of governing can be copied to other counties, and secularized bishoprics.\n\nAnd it can serve as a model for colonies.\n\nBut this needs very week princes in the surrounding areas (perhaps by the corruption\n\nstyle mentioned above).\n\nA bit hard, still ...\n\nHowever, I found it rather difficult to envision a company such as this without having some form of unified German state to back it up, or else the other powers would likely gobble it up.\n\nI don't think that is necessary.\n\nLook at the Netherlands: A successful colonial power, but tiny even in contrast\n\nto larger imperial feudal states.\n\nThe key is urbanization, and Bremen-Hamburg-Lübeck-Wismar-Stralsund are\n\ndefinitely not worse off than Rotterdam-Amsterdam.\n\nPerhaps you might compare to Brandenburg's trading company in the late 17th century,\n\nwhich tried to get a foothold in the upcoming colonial world, and to compete with\n\nthe Netherlands. It failed because Brandenburg did not have the necessary expertise.\n\nThe investment capital could also have been larger, which is where you again need cities.\n\nBut you can see from this example that you do not need a unified Germany -\n\na chain of wealthy cities and a moderate rural area will do.\n\nI'm a big fan of merchant leagues, but they are very difficult to keep together and they usually fall sooner or (usually not much) later in the hands of some nasty king or emperor.\n\nIt is quite similar to the curse of Venice: if they stay out of terra firma and concentrate on traffic and colonies their manpower base is quite low and they have no strategic depth. If they try and expand on the Italian mainland (as Venice did, quite successfully) league after league formed after them, and Venice managed to stay out of worse troubles by avoiding any further expansion on the mainland after the Holy League wars (which they were quite lucky to survive). Holland (or better the United Provinces) is a bit of an exception to the rule, but IMHO they were forced to fight by Spanish oppression and religious issues rather than by free will; and ultimately they were more of a principality than a true republic when everything is told.\n\nMerchants are appreciated if they pay their taxes and are not too much aggressive: think of them as a herd or not-very-belligerent cows who put up a fight only if their back is against the wall. And even then there is always some brighter guy who believes a conqueror can be better bought off than fought.\n\nA further point is that IIRC there was quite a rift between the western Hansa and the Baltic Hansa (actually I think there was even a third party involved, which I think included the Rhenish Anseatic cities): the interests (and even the goods traded) were quite different and often opposite."
