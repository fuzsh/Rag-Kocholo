        "text": "The federal state Bremen is a two-city-state consisting of the cities of Bremen and Bremerhaven. The region has a long tradition of combining trade, commerce and innovation. With expertise in areas from maritime services, logistics and aerospace engineering to clean energy (esp. wind and hydrogen) and automotive, the economy is well prepared for the future. Bremen is also a key player in digitisation, Industry 4.0 and the creative industries. The representation in Bruxelles was established in 1987.\n\nS3 Strategy\n\nStrategic Specialization takes place via the innovation strategy of the state of Bremen 2030 on the basis of the key innovation fields:\n\nSustainable economy and resource efficiency\n\nNetworked and adaptive industry\n\nMobility of the future\n\nIntelligent services\n\nDigital transformation.\n\nEach of the innovation fields focuses on specific societal challenges and addresses them with strategic objectives. In doing so, the particular regional strengths in the economic and innovation system of the state of Bremen are taken up and cross-industry specialization profiles are elaborated. Unlike in the past, the interfaces between sectors are emphasized and new target groups for innovation policy measures are brought into view. The operational goals and measures (chapter 4) refer to all fields of innovation. With the key innovation fields, the innovation policy of the state of Bremen will be positioned in such a way that it can respond quickly and appropriately to global trends, new technological developments and processes of social change. In this way, the necessary course is to be set by 2030 in order to increase the competitiveness of Bremen and Bremerhaven. More information."
