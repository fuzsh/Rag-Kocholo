History of Bremen

inBremen

The earliest settlement (called Breme or Bremum) on the right bank of the river was favoured by an advantageous position at the junction of important early trading routes from the Rhine River to the Elbe and from the North Sea to southern Germany. In 787 Charlemagne, the Holy Roman emperor, established the diocese of Bremen, which became the base for missionary activity covering the whole of northern Europe. The market rights conferred on Bremen in 965 brought increased mercantile activity, and the young city soon became one of the commanding religious and economic centres of northern Germany, especially after entering the Hanseatic League in 1358. The imperial free city, as Bremen became known, defended its independence in the Thirty Years’ War (1618–48) and later repelled both Swedish and Hanoverian aggression. As an autonomous republic—the oldest in Germany—it joined the German Confederation in 1815 and the reconstituted German Empire in 1871. It attained increased economic importance as a leader in international trade and world shipping by entering the German customs union (Zollverein) in 1888, through expanding its port facilities, and by developing a manufacturing industry. The city of Bremerhaven joined the Bremen state in 1947.
