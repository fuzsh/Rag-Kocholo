Update:

Instead of loading them as scratch, I checked that tapes as status=private. Now, it is showing in the list of "q libv", but when I try to do "q vol" it is not showing any information.

q libv output

Library Name: L3494B Volume Name: 005074 Status: Private Owner: Last Use: Home Element: Device Type: Cleanings Left: Media Type:

Open in new window

q vol output for the same volume:

ANR2034E QUERY VOLUME: No match found using this criteria.

What can be the issue with this, whether something has happened to the data on it? how can I verify the same and let TSM know about that tape.

Thanks

Ok, I will verify that. Also, one more thing - from last one month library/tsm is using lot of scratch tapes suddenly. The scratch tapes reduced from 180 to down to 0 in last one 29 days. Actually, I made 2 changes during last month.

1) I changed the retention policy settings for one of our windows backup pool which we discussed yesterday in the thread ID: 37967576 "Regarding TSM retention policies"

Policy Policy Mgmt Copy Versions Versions Retain Retain Domain Set Name Class Group Data Data Extra Only Name Name Name Exists Deleted Versions Version --------- --------- --------- --------- -------- -------- -------- ------- WINDOWS ACTIVE WINDOWS STANDARD No Limit No Limit 60 60 WINDOWS WINDOWS WINDOWS STANDARD No Limit No Limit 60 60

Open in new window

last month I changed the value of "Retain Extra Versions" from 30 to 60.

(2) change was - I changed the value for deleting volhist from 32 to 91 days (this I changed as I want to predict the tape usage)

I am sure, that first change is causing me using more scratch tapes, but I just want to verify whether it is first change or second change causing this? Can you help me in this?

Thanks
