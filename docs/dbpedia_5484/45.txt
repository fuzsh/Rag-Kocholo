Hi,

I am currently using a Quatum Scalar i40 with no partitons, but I would like to configure two partitons with slots 1-5 on the first partiion and 6-10 on the second partion. I plan to leave the rest of the slots for blank or scratch media. I'm trying to figure out what to do in the case where all of my tepes become full on a partion.

1)Will I have to leave an empty slot on each partion so blank/scratch tapes can be loaded?

2)Will I have to put the rest of the slots containing blank/scratch media into a partiton?

3). If the 5th tape is needed will BE move it automaticlly into the empty slot.

I don't think that I will need more than 4 tapes but I just want to make sure that all of my jobs will complete and not fail do to not enough media.

Thank you very much for any assitance.
