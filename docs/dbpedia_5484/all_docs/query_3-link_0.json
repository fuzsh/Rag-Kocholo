        "text": "Throughout our 90-year history we have endeavored never to stand still: we have evolved from a manufacturer of standard materials into a highly specialized developer of technical adhesive tapes. Why? Because we want to provide you with adhesive tape solutions tailored to your application. Solutions that meet your individual requirements.\n\nWhat sets Coroplast apart is that you get project expertise and quality material all from one provider, because we always manufacture your tapes ourselves.\n\nWe offer single- and double-sided adhesive tapes with all adhesive materials:\n\nHot-melt acrylic\n\nSynthetic rubber\n\nDispersion and solvent acrylic, also in modified form\n\nSelf-adhesive acrylic masses\n\nThe following examples from the automobile and industrial sectors show clearly how adhesive solutions can provide a meaningful – and above all affordable – alternative.\n\nCreative adhesive solution for a window in the shape of a maple leaf\n\nA well-known manufacturer of high-quality aluminum doors approached with a particularly original challenge. He wanted to produce an all-around glued window in the shape of an maple leaf. Our team was able to show that we can find a customized and cost-effective solution with our adhesive tape know-how even for such unusual requests. We chose our high performance Coroplast 9920 SPT adhesive tape for this project. The highly flexible and adaptable acrylate composition is perfect. It compensates for the stresses caused by temperature changes between glass and aluminum. In addition, this product can be cut with absolute precision using our laser. With this project, we once again demonstrated that we can manufacture not only functional parts with simple geometric shapes, but also with arbitrarily complex shapes such as an maple leaf, for example.\n\nBondings and seals for MORELO recreational vehicles\n\nMORELO, the premium recreational vehicle (RV) manufacturer, approached us with a number of interesting requirements: We were able to design and implement different and very special new adhesive solutions, helping to cut the customer’s costs and simplify its production processes. Among other things, we used adhesive tapes to secure handles and cupboards that were previously screwed. Also in the shower cubicle, we were able to bond both a shower tub seal and the shower door protector cost-efficiently and above all permanently.\n\nOne window – 13 Coroplast die-cut parts: the Geneo Inovent by Rehau\n\nBondings can also represent a more inexpensive and sustainable alternative in the door and window industry. We provided proof of this together with our customer Rehau by installing a total of 13 different bonding and sealing parts in a highly innovative window, the frame of which has a concealed air conditioning system to allow ventilation even when closed."
