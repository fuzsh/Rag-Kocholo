        "text": "Is a direct measurement of the ability of an imaging system to record detail, typically measured by its ability to maintain separation between close subject elements such as fine lines which are usually stated as ‘line pairs or cycles per millimeter’. It is often determined by imaging a resolution test chart. With some imaging systems there may be a slight difference in the horizontal and vertical resolution. If so, the lower of the two values is considered the achievable resolution of the imaging system.\n\nIs similar to a search engine of the old days of the internet. These are like the early Yahoo! or sites where one has to click through categories and see the sites available with descriptions that lacked much detail. These are a great source for finding the new location of sites that have been moved due to take-downs or hacks, but they must be reviewed manually to find the sought-after locations.\n\nThe best evidence rule applies when a party wants to admit as evidence the contents of a document at trial, but that the original document is not available. In this case, the party must provide an acceptable excuse for its absence. If the document itself is not available, and the court finds the excuse provided acceptable, then the party is allowed to use secondary evidence to prove the contents of the document and have it as admissible evidence. The best evidence rule only applies when a party seeks to prove the contents of the document sought to be admitted as evidence.\n\nAn error-detection scheme which performs a calculation on the binary value of the packet/frame and then which is appended to the packet/frame as a fixed-length field. Once the packet/frame is received a similar calculation is performed. If the result does not match the first calculation then a data change occurred during transmission. The calculation can be a sum (checksum), a remainder of a division (CRC-cyclic redundancy check) or the result of a hashing function.\n\nIs a value used to describe the reduction in size of the data. For example if we start with a 1 Megabyte image and compress it to 128 Kilobytes, the compression ratio is 1,048,576 divided by 131,072 or 8. This represents a compression ratio of 8:1 meaning the compressed file is 1/8th the size of the original file. Typically the higher the compression ratio value, the worse the image looks. Compression ratio comparisons are only valid when using the same image format.\n\nIs a message given to a Web browser (on the computer) by a Web server. The browser stores the message in a text file called cookie.txt. The message is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. The main purpose of cookies is to identify users and possibly prepare customized Web pages for them. When you enter a Web site using cookies, you may be asked to fill out a form providing such information as your name and interests. This information is packaged into a cookie and sent to your Web browser, which stores it for later use. The next time you go to the same Web site, your browser will send the cookie to the Web server. The server can use this information to present you with custom Web pages.\n\nThis is a special type of searching that where regular indexing engines (such as Google or Bing) are unable to find as there are no links that point to them or there are preventative methods such as required logins and captchas in order to view any content beyond the home page. This means that data takes more time to review as it requires a number of manual procedures such as user creation to access.\n\nWhen a company’s network is attacked and valuable data is stolen—usually customer log-in credentials, credit card details, and social security numbers. The stolen data can then be abused in myriad ways: held for ransom (see Ransomware below), sold on the darknet, and, of course, used to make purchases. Often hackers try to crack email passwords, then test those log-in details on other popular sites, since many people use the same credentials for multiple accounts—a big no-no.\n\nRefers to the core data privacy tenet that an entity should neither collect nor maintain more information about an individual than is necessary to accomplish the purpose for which it is being collected. A contact tracing app that continues to collect users’ geolocation information in the post-pandemic era, for example, would run afoul of this principle.\n\nTo comply with it, government agencies and companies should cease collecting app users’ information and delete any stored contact tracing information once it is no longer needed for COVID-19 mitigation efforts, to comply with legal requirements, or for another appropriate purpose.\n\nThis is often mistakenly called the “Dark Web”, the Deep web is a hidden network that is accessible via a specialized internet connection. The Deep Web offers its sites some protection by randomizing website names, such as hXXp://hss3uruhjo2xfogfq.Xnion (characters transposed with ‘X’ for user protection) instead of hXXp://www.notevil.com. These sites are often featured on the news for hosting the sale of illegal items, ranging from drugs to social security numbers to stolen software.\n\nDNS stands for “domain name server,” which uses the name of a any common website to redirect traffic to its own IP address. For instance, you’d expect “google.com” to take you to Google’s IP address. Using a DNS hijack, however, cybercriminals can translate “google.com” to their own IP address, redirecting you to malicious sites where they can collect your information or have you download malware. In an attempt to get you to click on a link, DNS hijacks can also deliver altered search results.\n\nDynamic range is the ratio of contrast, tonal range or density in an image between black and white. The number 0.0 represent white and black is 4.0. A flatbed scanner may have a dynamic range of 2.4-2.7 while a drum scanner may be as high as 3.6-3.8. The numeric ranges stated is the ability of the device to record and reproduce the range of grays between black and white. The higher the number the greater the detail in shadow (black) and highlight (white) reproduced in an image.\n\nRefers to discovery in legal proceedings such as litigation, government investigations, or Freedom of Information Act requests, where the information sought is in electronic format (often referred to as electronically stored information or ESI).[1] Electronic discovery is subject to rules of civil procedure and agreed-upon processes, often involving review for privilege and relevance before data are turned over to the requesting party. Electronic information is considered different from paper information because of its intangible form, volume, transience and persistence. Electronic information is usually accompanied by metadata that is not found in paper documents and that can play an important part as evidence (e.g. the date and time a document was written could be useful in a copyright case). The preservation of metadata from electronic documents creates special challenges to prevent spoliation.\n\nThe forgery of an email header so that the message appears to have originated from someone or somewhere other than the actual source. Email spoofing is a tactic used in phishing and spam campaigns because people are more likely to open an email when they think it has been sent by a legitimate source.\n\nThe forgery of an email header so that the message appears to have originated from someone or somewhere other than the actual source. Email spoofing is a tactic used in phishing and spam campaigns because people are more likely to open an email when they think it has been sent by a legitimate source.\n\nA word that refers to an intranet that is partially accessible to authorized outsiders. Whereas an intranet resides behind a firewall and is accessible only to people who are members of the same company or organization, an extranet provides various levels of accessibility to outsiders. You can access an extranet only if you have a valid username and password, and your identity determines which parts of the extranet you can view\n\nAn interlaced video image is comprised of two fields, each containing half of the scan lines needed to make one frame of video. The frame is displayed by rapidly alternating the display of each field in its entirety. For example a 525 line frame of an NTSC image is displayed by first displaying the 262.5 line odd field followed by the 262.5 line even field.\n\nA tag of three or four letters, preceded by a period, which identifies a data file’s format or the application used to create the file. File extensions can streamline the process of locating data. For example, if one is looking for incriminating pictures stored on a computer, one might begin with the .gif and .jpg files. File Format The configuration of data in a file.\n\nIs the space between the end of the logical file to the end of the cluster containing the data. This slack space will usually contain data from files that used this space before. Files are stored in clusters. Since storage is allocated in fixed sized clusters, and only one file can occupy a cluster, there is often space remaining in the last cluster in which a file exists, as most files only use a part of the last cluster allocated to them.\n\nAre a great source of information on the deep web for investigators. While these act like normal forums, their contents are much different and often discuss illegal topics. The topics range from sales of stolen data or drugs to hiring hitmen. These often are in English or Russian and have minimal features to prevent search engine from exploring them too quickly.\n\nA single, complete picture in a video or film. A video frame is made up of two interlaced fields of either 525 lines (NTSC) or 625 lines (PAL). Full-motion video for NTSC runs at 30 frames per second (fps); for PAL, 25 fps. Film runs at 24 fps. For progressive scan (non-interlaced) video, the frame is written through successive lines that start at the top left of the picture and finish at the bottom right.\n\nA one-way algorithm which maps or translates one set of bits into another (generally smaller) in such a way that the algorithm yields the same hash results every time for the same message, and it is computationally infeasible for a message to be reconstituted from the hash result. Also, two different messages cannot produce the same hash results.\n\nThe set of markup symbols or codes inserted in a file intended for display on a World Wide Web browser page. The markup tells the Web browser how to display a Web page’s words and images for the user. Each individual markup code is referred to as an element (but many people also refer to it as a tag). Some elements come in pairs that indicate when some display effect is to begin and when it is to end.\n\nAn interlaced-scan sends information to each pixel in the even-numbered rows of pixels on a screen, left to right and then top to bottom. Then it sends information to odd-numbered rows. This results in a slightly distorted picture, as the component parts of the image do not all appear on the television screen at exactly the same time. The 1080i (interlaced) high-definition standard is an interlaced-scanning standard.\n\nDepending on the version of the operating system being used on the computer, Internet usage is tracked in various ways. One way is in the form of a database often referred to as the History file. This database keeps track of Internet usage to include web sites, graphics, re-directs and cookies. This file is very dynamic and can be overwritten on a daily basis. In an NT Windows environment, computer users are assigned profiles. The profiles contain history files specific to that user.\n\nIs a company that provides access to their web site and or access to the Internet. The service provider gives you a software package, username, password and access phone number. Equipped with a modem, you can then log on to the Internet and browse the World Wide Web and USENET, and send and receive e-mail. Newsgroups can also be accessed through this service.\n\nInterpolation is a mathematical method of creating missing data. An image can be increased from 100 pixels to 200 pixels through interpolation. There are many methods of interpolation, but one simple method would be to generate a new pixel by using the average of the value of the two pixels on either side of the one to be created.\n\nThere are files that contain links (.lnk) to other resources such as programs, data files, and web pages. Link files refer to or “link” to target files. Target files are often applications, directories, documents, and data files. Specifically, when a user opens a document, a link file is created in the Recent folder under the logged on user profile. These links are a record that the document was opened by the user.\n\nA list of recorded events, communications or other details of computer operation. Records can be entered manually or can be automated by a computer program. Logs are typically stored in files but may be found on the local computer or on a remote computer or server. Logs can be used to troubleshoot computer/program operations, detect misuse or intrusion attempts, or to gather information on user activity or access. Logs might be found in a plain text format or in a proprietary format.\n\nIn the MFT (Master File Table) in NTFS (standard DoS configuration), all files and folders are marked as a folder or file, and they are marked as belonging to a “parent”. So say you have a folder with a bunch of files within it. Those files are its “children”. For those files to become “lost”, let us pretend the user deletes those files and then deletes the folder itself. The user then creates a new folder. The entry in the MFT for the old folder is overwritten. So it, the original “parent” folder, and its entry in the MFT, are gone. But its “children”, while deleted, have not been overwritten and their entries are still in the MFT.\n\nThese are like eBay or Amazon, where the sale of products is conducted. Mostly on the deep web these are used for illegal drug sales (approximately 80%) and the remainder is made up of stolen credit cards, social security numbers, passports, ids, pirated software, dumps of documents, and other miscellaneous items. This is an ever-changing landscape due to many governmental initiatives to remove them, so the addresses, names, and details are always influx and non-permanent.\n\nIs contained inside of a file and is not normally visible to the user, but can contain detailed information about the file. Metadata describes, for example, how, when, and by whom it was received, created, accessed, and/or modified, and how it is formatted. Metadata can be hidden or embedded and therefore unavailable to computer users who are not technically adept.\n\nMigrated Data is information that has been transferred from one database or format to another, this occurs when a change from one hardware or software technology has been change to another, Mirroring One disk acts as the primary storage disk, while the other provides a mirror image of the primary disk, providing redundancy in the event of a disk failure.\n\nAlso referred to as two-factor authentication or 2FA. A security enhancement that forces you to present two pieces of evidence – your credentials – when logging in to an account. Credentials are generally categorized by: something you know (like a password or PIN), something you have (like a smart card), or something you are (like your fingerprint). To enhance security, credentials must come from two different categories.\n\nAn electronic system that can accept a number of camera inputs and record them virtually simultaneously. They can also provide multi screen displays with four, nine, sixteen etc. cameras on the screen at once. Multiplexers can be used to transmit up to sixteen pictures down a single video line whether it is a coaxial cable, microwave, infrared link etc. This requires a multiplexer at each end of the line.\n\nNewsgroups may also be referred to as a forum or an on-line discussion group. On the Internet, there are literally thousands of newsgroups covering every conceivable interest. To view and post messages to a newsgroup, you need a newsreader (which can be provided by an ISP), a program that runs on your computer and connects you to a news server on the Internet.\n\nThe numerical value of pixels per inch as opposed to the achievable resolution of the imaging device. In the case of flatbed scanners, it is based on the resolution setting in the software controlling the scanner. In the case of digital cameras, this refers to the number of pixels of the camera sensor divided by the corresponding vertical and horizontal dimension of the area photographed.\n\nOpen Wi-Fi networks are unencrypted, which is why they’re risky. Anyone can create a fake hotspot and trick your device into joining it automatically. When you use open Wi-Fi without protection like a VPN (see tips below), anyone on that network can see the sites you visit, your log-in passwords, your financial and personal data, and more. Hackers often name their phony Wi-Fi networks after popular spots (like “Starbucks”), knowing that most devices automatically rejoin hotspots they’ve used in the past. Hackers can even redirect your unencrypted traffic, sending you to malicious sites.\n\nA file that no longer has a parent; the parent being the folder they were in. If a folder is deleted, the files within it are deleted as well but are not orphans. The folder and children files are potentially recoverable with the information intact in the Master File Table ($MFT). A file becomes an orphan, when the parent folder is overwritten.\n\nUsed by cybercriminals to trick people into giving up sensitive information, phishing scams pose as emails from an organization or person you know. There is usually a link or attachment included, which it tries to get you to click so that you’ll unwittingly allow malware to download to your system. Sometimes phishing scams look indistinguishable from the sites they’re imitating, and they attempt to trick you into entering your password info.\n\nAn aerial remote sensing technique, which employs a high-resolution aerial camera with forward motion compensation using global satellite navigation technology for pilot guidance over the designated photo block. It is also used as a measurement technology in which the threedimensional coordinates of points on an object are determined by measurements made in two or more photographic images taken from different positions. Photogrammetry can also form the baseline of many Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Land Information System (LIS) studies and endeavors.\n\nAn indicator in the directory of a disk (or other storage medium) that identifies the area in which an electronic document or piece of data resides, which prevents that space from being overwritten by other information. When a document is “deleted,” the pointer is deleted, which permits the file to be overwritten, but the document is not actually removed.\n\nThe windows operating system keeps track of how a computer starts, and what programs you most frequently open. It saves this data to files in the prefetch folder. The folder contains the name of the executable, a Unicode list of DLLs used by that executable, a count of how many times the executable has been run, and a timestamp indicating the last time the program was run.\n\nAn evaluation of analysts, technical support personnel, and the agency, in order to demonstrate their ability of to perform at a level of quality. (Four examples are provided). Open test – the analyst(s) and technical support personnel are aware they Are being tested. Blind test – the analyst(s) and technical support personnel are unaware they are being tested. Internal test – conducted by the agency itself. External test – conducted by an agency independent of the agency being tested.\n\nLike an Open Wi-Fi network Public Wi-fi’s are unencrypted, and risky. Anyone can create a fake hotspot and trick your device into joining it automatically. When you use open Wi-Fi without protection like a VPN (see tips below), anyone on that network can see the sites you visit, your log-in passwords, your financial and personal data, and more. Hackers often name their phony Wi-Fi networks after popular spots (like “Starbucks”), knowing that most devices automatically rejoin hotspots they’ve used in the past. Hackers can even redirect your unencrypted traffic, sending you to malicious sites.\n\nIs configured to use multiple hard drives to create one (1) logical volume. RAID 5 uses a process called disk striping. Disk striping divides the data into block and distributes the data blocks across multiple configured hard drives. If one hard drive fails, the array maybe able to be rebuild by reading the data from all the remaining hard drives. If more than two (2) hard drives fail, there is a possibility the entire array will be loss.\n\nRansomware is malware that takes hold of your system and encrypts it, sometimes attacking individual files. Trying to access the encrypted files triggers a note that claims you are locked out until you make a payment (more than $600, on average). The messages sometimes appear to be from an official government agency accusing you of committing a cyber crime, which scares many into paying the ransom. Payment is often demanded in Bitcoins.\n\nThe software to store deleted files uses the Recycle folder, which is usually set up by the Windows operating system. This folder gives the computer one last chance to undelete a file or folder that the user may not have wanted to delete in the first place. This folder is dynamic and can be manipulated by the user. When the folder is full, the operating system may prompt the user to empty it. The operating system may also continue to write over older deleted files and folders as the recycle folder fills up.\n\nContains information about users and groups associated with the computer. The SAM file found in local machines, on Windows NT and 2000, contains information about that specific machine, and only that machine. A machine that is connected to the network may have tow default accounts in the local SAM file, even if 10 different persons have logged onto it. The network logon process requires that users authenticate the user names and passwords through the domain sever. When a person logs onto a workstation computer, the information is sent to the domain server where it is authenticated. IF the authentication passes, the server sends a message back to the computer, which allows the logon to occur.\n\nA program that searches documents for specified keywords and returns a list of the documents where the keywords were found. Although search engine is really a general class of programs, the term is often used to specifically describe systems like Alta Vista and Excite that enable users to search for documents on the World Wide Web and USENET newsgroups. Typically, a search engine works by sending out a spider to fetch as many documents as possible. Another program, called an indexer, then reads these documents and creates an index based on the words contained in each document. Each search engine uses a proprietary algorithm to create its indices such that, ideally, only meaningful results are returned for each query.\n\nA portable memory chip used mostly in cell phones that operate on the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) network. These cards hold the personal information of the account holder, to include phone number, address book, and can contain limited text messages, and other data. The type or amount of data stored on a SIM card is limited and is also dependent on the carrier.\n\nIs a targeted phishing attack.12,13 Spear-phishing is a popular infection vector for malicious actors.14 Spear-phishing messages are tailored to the target recipient (e.g., individual or groups within an organization).15 There is a plethora of information available online about companies, their employees and contractors, current and past projects, policies and procedures, and their vendors and business associates. Spear-phishing messages may be particularly convincing when they contain “insider information” relevant to the targeted organization or individual. In addition, spear-phishing has been made more effective through the use of stolen vendor credentials.16 Thus, spear-phishing has been used to target healthcare organizations, either directly or indirectly (such as through vendors)\n\nA person who is responsible for the upkeep, configuration, and reliable operation of computer systems; especially multi-user computers, such as servers. The system administrator seeks to ensure that the uptime, performance, resources, and security of the computers they manage meet the needs of the users, without exceeding a set budget when doing so.\n\nA collection of client’s data using narrow parameters such as date restrictions and search terms. This is normally done in an attempt to cut down on costs. This type of collection has its own risks; if it occurs before a meet and confer all custodians and search terms may not be known and may be subject to change.\n\nIs sometimes referred to as a cache folder, stores graphics from web sites that are visited by the computer user. This is done automatically without any input from the computer user. This folder saves the graphics so the next time the computer user visits the web site, the loading of the web site will be faster because the graphic files are already on the computer.\n\nA thumbnail view is also commonly seen as a miniature picture that represents a larger graphic. The Microsoft Windows Operating System® generates thumbnails of larger graphic files and displays them to the user in the explorer window. Starting with Windows ME, the user could select View > Thumbnails from the drop down menu. This allowed the user to view thumbnails of the graphics in that folder instead of the details or icons normally viewed. When the user accesses this view a hidden file in created by the operating system in the folder where the graphic files are stored. These operating system created files are not visible to the common user. This system file is called a thumbs.db and is actually a database of the miniature images that exist in the folder from which they are initiated. An interesting aspect of the thumbs.db files is that when a graphic is viewed and an entry made for it in the database, it is maintained indefinitely by the operating system. If the graphic file is deleted, the image will remain unless the thumbs.db file or the entire folder is deleted.\n\nA feature of DVRs that allows the equipment to adhere to data retention policies that may be mandated in certain parts of the world which results in video data becoming inaccessible after a certain date. This may happen even when the unit is switched off.\n\nCan enter a computer secretly and quietly and can be destructive in nature. A Trojan typically installs a virus or worm on to the computer it has entered. Trojans can also install programs that allow someone else to have control over the user’s computer. Trojans usually come attached to another file, such as an .avi, or .exe, or even a .jpg. Computer users fail to see full file extensions, so what may appear, as games.zip in reality could be games.zip.exe. Once the computer user opens up the file, the Trojan will activate.\n\nWeb sites and newsgroup addresses are very dynamic and change on a monthly, weekly or daily basis. The web site addresses found in the Internet Explorer history viewer (subsections of this report) can be visited by typing in the addresses into any Internet browser. Referenced images may be located by doing this but there is no way to tell if the site was the same as the day the suspect may have visited the site.\n\nA targeted phishing attack that is aimed at wealthy, powerful, or prominent individuals (e.g., C-suite executives such as chief financial officers and chief executive officers, politicians, and celebrities). 18,19,20 But, others use the term “whaling” to mean an attack that involves malicious actors masquerading as such individuals.21 As an example, a malicious actor may masquerade as a hospital’s chief financial officer (“CFO”) and trick the recipient into divulging bank account information, employee information, corporate financial information, and/or transferring funds to an account that is controlled by the actor\n\nOften referred to as WWW or the Web, this usually refers to information available on the Internet that can be easily accessed with software usually called a “browser.” Organizations publish their information on the Web in a format known as HTML. The “Web” is capable of delivering multimedia materials such as text, graphics, sound and moving video. Hypertext links allow a quick and easy way to move seamlessly from one source of information to another across computers from all around the globe."
