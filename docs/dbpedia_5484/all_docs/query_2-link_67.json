        "text": "I need to archive 60TB of data for up to ten years. I was thinking that Tapes would be better than HDDs sitting unplugged but tapes don’t last forever either. I have never been required to store this much data without power before. When this project is done, the NAS, USB drives, servers, or whatever I use, will be put in a box and stored for as long as legally required.\n\nHave HDDs gotten to a place where they store data as long as tapes yet?\n\nWhich HDDs would store data the longest without power?\n\nShould I just add some time to the budget so someone could burn 15 DVDs every day?\n\nI only found one recent conversation but it talked mostly about cloud storage and I need to suggest onsite, archive, and cloud for my complete solution.\n\nLTO tapes are pretty great for this. I’d suggest testing your backup once you have it, and I’d even go a bit further than @bob2213 ​ and say that you should also put the entire tape drive (along with any relevant drivers/installers/software) out and keep it with the tapes when you’re done if you know it’s not going to be used in the near future… You don’t want someone else stepping into your shoes 8 years down the road and thinking “Why does this system have a friggin’ tape drive?” and tossing it only to find out you need to pull the tapes in year 9\n\nAs everyone else suggested, go with tapes.\n\nUse LTO7 or LTO8 ones, they hold 3-8TB each cartridge and last 15+ years, confirmed to use in banking and law sector where long term storage is required.\n\nWe recently got a LTO7 drive for about 2.5k USD inc. taxes and 30 USD/cartridge, seems very reasonable for long term storage.\n\nAlso, as already mentioned by another poster, include original software which did the backup on a separate tape and maybe a HDD + DVD, so you can restore in any case.\n\nWe also have separate old servers with LTO2 and LTO4 in a locked storage room, labeled with DO NOT TOUCH / DO NOT DISCARD so we can even power on or at least use the drive after many years, even if drives are out of production already from a long time…\n\nThe problem with long term storage as some hinted at above is that hardware goes obsolete. Kind of lean in the disk based VTL (virtual tape library) direction where you can replace hard drives as they wear out or the interfaces become obsolete. Backup software is notoriously bad at this - Windows Backup and Symantec Backup Exec being two of the worst.\n\nI have been playing with archiving virtual hard disks in HyperV but, VMware would be just as good. The issue is being able to view and print or search what’s on there 5,10,20 years later. Might do fairly well with Unitrends or Baracuda.\n\nI have been scanning documents since 1988 and basically had to re-do everything about three times as software compatibility issues manifested.\n\nStuff like Excel and Word are not guaranteed. Old PDF got a little squirrelly a while back.\n\nI have about 300GB archive of various backup software packages and all the updates but to be honest I’m not sure compatible hardware could be acquired at this point or an install able compatible OS. After all where would you find working hardware for Apple v5 or Win Server NT4 to run an old Backup Exec??? Certainly not going to spin up a VM.\n\nI have 3 year retention on recordings of my phone system and I really breathed a sigh of relief when I got that booger virtualized in 2017. You can’t identify a recording by its file name or time stamp you can only locate a particular conversation if you can run the entire archived pbx to search for it. Every January 1st I archive the entire virtual machine and virtual hard drive is saved. I am working on saving a fully functional HyperV Server 2012 as a Virtual machine I can spin up in later Hypervisors.\n\nThink long and hard about how you need to access the archived data down the road."
