        "text": "@Wayn , thanks for the question!\n\nI want to confirm, has someone has physically confirmed the tapes are in the library? A full scan should definitely detect them if they are physically there (barring any other issues).\n\nWhat kind of tape library is this?\n\nIf you put a tape into the slot, the library tells CV that the new barcode has been entered. If it doesn’t show up in the CV gui, then that’s likely an issue where the library is not sending the OS an update mapping.\n\nthe guy screenshots here show me the tape is outside the library, so if you can confirm it is physically in the library AND you did a Full Scan, I would look at the library itself for errors.\n\nIf you navigate to the IBM 3573’s admin interface, are you able to see the tapes ?\n\nIs the tape library not split from it’s hardware configuration, with like slots 0-10 to lib1 and slots 11-20 to lib2.. ?\n\nAlso look from the Storage Resources / Libraries / your tape library, the number of slots and configuration, to ensure that this matches the physical / logical configuration of your IBM library.\n\nFrom there, check the Media by location / Media in library (make sure to show even empty slots). Does this match all of the above ?\n\nGood news, at least\n\nWell, this can come from many parts.\n\nI would suggest to check the configuration/settings from the physical library, then this library in Commvault, and then the properties/settings of the library in Commvault.\n\nOne good example would be that, like, any tape removal/change in the library is not reflected in the same library in Commvault, because the automatic inventory/rescan is not enabled.\n\nI do manage multiple libraries worldwide, and sometimes tapes are swapped with other tapes (with different barcodes), but until I perform a Full Scan, or even a Reset Library of the device in the Commcell Console, I could notice that the library content is not updated in the Commcell Console.\n\nWell, depending on your hardware, I can’t tell exactly. I have some Dell TL1000 libraries with LTO8 drives, and they are reported in Commvault as IBM3572..\n\nBut from the webadmin interface of this Dell tape library, I can review its settings like this :\n\nAnd this is what should also be reported by Commvault in the Storage Ressources/Libraries/your_tape_library from the Commcell Console.\n\nThen also in the same part, check the Library Properties especially the 3 tabs :\n\nAnd make sure they match your physical tape library configuration, and also how you expect it to behave..\n\nOK, from what I see, you have a FibreChannel dual port dual drive LTO8 tape library.\n\nIs it directly attached to the HBAs of the server, or through a SAN switch ?\n\nDepending on the case, multipath can cause your TL to be seen differently from the server.\n\nCommvault does not have direct drivers to manage system devices, so it only relies on the system drivers and setup inside the OS. Make sure it’s properly setup in the OS (especially using windows) and the MPIO/multipathing settings are also properly set.\n\nThen I see that from the IBM management’s interface, the physical library is setup as one logical library. I’m not that used to IBM’s libraries.\n\nMaybe that logical configuration differs from the one detected by Commvault, especially as you have 5 reserved I/O slots from your 35 (or is it 5 from 40 = 35 free?).\n\nCompare that configuration with the one you have in Commvault, from the Status tab, like this :\n\nMPIO is a Feature to be added by your Windows Server administrator, through the Add Server Roles and Features Wizard, like this, after a few ‘next’ / ‘next’ clicks :\n\nWhen this is added, this will require a restart.\n\nAfter that you need to configure MPIO, calling it from the Start Menu / Search :\n\nAnd then you’ll get the MPIO Properties window, where you’ll have to setup/activate MPIO on your device, according to your configuration and Vendor (IBM for this one).\n\nBefore that, if you go to your server’s Device Manager / Peripherals, you might see your tape drives doubled.."
