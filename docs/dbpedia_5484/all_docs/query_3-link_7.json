We provide practical advice at the key stages in the application and removal process of transdermal patches. This advice does not replace manufacturers’ instructions which should always be read for patch specific advice.\n\nApplication and removal\n\nBefore application\n\nStaff should make the following checks:\n\nRIGHT person\n\nRIGHT medicine\n\nRIGHT route\n\nRIGHT dose\n\nRIGHT time\n\nRIGHT documentation\n\nRIGHT to decline\n\nCheck the pharmacy label carefully\n\nConfirm the correct frequency or interval on the pharmacy label on the product packaging, as this can vary from days to weeks.\n\nChoose and prepare the application site\n\nRotate the site of application each time a patch is applied. Refer to administration records to check the previous application site. Using the same site every time can cause skin irritation.\n\nSome patches can cause a thinning of the skin. If routinely applied to the same area, the rate of absorption into the bloodstream can be higher. This could lead to an overdose of the medication.\n\nEnsure the skin is dry, intact and not irritated.\n\nA flat area of hairless skin is a suitable application site. The person’s hair may need need to be clipped to give better adhesion.\n\nThe upper back may be preferable in a confused person, to reduce the risk of unintended patch removal. First refer to local procedures on capacity and consent.\n\nStaff should not:\n\nExpose the application site to oils, creamy soaps or moisturisers. This may cause irritation or cause allergic reactions when the patch is applied. It may also prevent the patch from sticking to the skin.\n\nShave the hair as this may irritate the skin.\n\nTake the patch out of the wrapper until they are ready to apply it to the skin site.\n\nDuring application\n\nStaff should:\n\nWash hands before and after application.\n\nAlways ensure old patches are removed before applying a new one.\n\nFollow manufacturers’ product literature carefully for step-by-step instructions on the correct application technique.\n\nInstructions can be found on the product packaging or in the accompanying Patient Information Leaflet, or electronically via the Electronic Medicines Compendium (eMC).\n\nOnce applied, check the patch has adhered onto the skin properly, especially on the edges.\n\nRecord the administration using their local documentation, including the date and time.\n\nIf needed, write the date and time of application on the edge of the patch itself using a soft-tip permanent marker pen, taking care not to damage or tear the backing liner.\n\nAvoid during application\n\nStaff should not:\n\nApply a patch immediately after a person has had a bath or shower as heat can increase the absorption of medicines in the patch. This could lead to an inadvertent overdose of medication.\n\nTouch the adhesive side of patches as inadvertent exposure to the medicine is possible.\n\nMultiple patches\n\nAlways consider the range of strengths available and if it is possible to use a higher strength rather than multiple patches.\n\nWhen more than one patch containing the same medication is needed, apply to the same area of the body but do not overlap the patches.\n\nAt removal\n\nStaff should:\n\nLocate the patch (or patches) and check when it should be removed: ask the person to show them the location and check the electronic or written records.\n\nCheck that there is no indication that the patch has been tampered with since application.\n\nEnsure that they are removing the correct patch, as people may be using more than one type of patch.\n\nCarefully remove the patch to minimise skin reactions.\n\nClean the application site with water to remove leftover adhesive.\n\nRecord that the patch has been removed, including the date and time.\n\nAvoid at removal\n\nStaff should not:\n\nApply another patch until the previous patch or patches have been located and removed or loss of patch confirmed.\n\nTouch the adhesive side of patches as inadvertent exposure to the medicine is possible.\n\nDisposal after use\n\nStaff should:\n\nFold the used patch so that the adhesive side of the patch sticks firmly to itself.\n\nRemember used patches can contain residual medicine which can be fatal.\n\nFollow local disposal regulation to dispose of used patches e.g. CD waste disposal bin or sharps container.\n\nWash hands thoroughly after handling the patches.\n\nCutting patches\n\nAvoid cutting patches if possible:\n\nCutting a patch will make the use ‘off-licence’.\n\nThe release mechanism of the medicine could be adversely affected and release more medicine than intended.\n\nThe resulting sharp edges could impair adhesion to the skin.\n\nBefore cutting a patch\n\nBefore cutting a patch, staff should:\n\nConsider the range of strengths available and if it is possible to use a lower strength rather than cutting patches.\n\nConsider if it is more appropriate to cover a portion of the patch to prevent contact with skin, in preference to cutting. Surgical adhesive tape (e.g. Micropore ®) can be used on edges to aid adherence. Discuss this with the prescriber or pharmacist.\n\nRefer to the manufacturer’s literature for details on the type of patch.\n\nMake a decision to cut a patch on a case by case basis and not as routine practice.\n\nDiscuss and obtain authorisation from the prescriber if a patch is intended to be cut.\n\nTypes of patches\n\nPatches contain either a ‘reservoir’ or ‘matrix’ of medicine that passes through the skin into the bloodstream. Refer to the manufacturer’s literature for details on the type of patch.\n\nReservoir patches\n\nThe medicine is held in a reservoir with a rate-limiting membrane to control release of the medicine.\n\nCutting these patches can cause the medicine to leak from the patch and is therefore not recommended.\n\nThe exception is Scopoderm (hyoscine hydrobromide) 1.5mg patches, according to the BNF for Children. These can be cut with scissors along full thickness ensuring that the membrane is not peeled away.\n\nMatrix patches\n\nThe medicine is embedded in an adhesive matrix with the release rate determined by the physical properties of the matrix.\n\nThe Matrix type patches can be sometimes cut.\n\nSeek advice from the pharmacist or the Medicines Information service that it is safe to cut the patch.\n\nSurgical adhesive tape (e.g. Micropore) can be applied to the edges to aid adherence.\n\nDispose of the remaining part of the cut patch according to local policy. Only store the remaining part of the patch if stability information is available confirming that it is safe for further use.\n\nDo not cut these patches\n\nSome patches must not be cut:\n\nReservoir style patches: Cutting these will cause the medicine to leak from the patch. (The exception is Scopoderm (hyoscine hydrobromide) 1.5mg patches, according to the BNF for Children )\n\nAny type of fentanyl patch (an opioid painkiller). The MHRA specifically advise not to cut fentanyl patches due to the risk of life threatening and fatal opioid toxicity.\n\nPatch has fallen off\n\nIf a patch has fallen off, staff should:\n\nLook carefully\n\nCheck the patch has fallen off completely. Check the patch records and ensure the patch is not stuck to another part of the body. Patches can fall off during showering or in bedding:\n\nIf a patch has inadvertently transferred to another person, it should be removed immediately and medical help should be sought urgently.\n\nConsider whether the loss of a patch appears suspicious. Extra vigilance is necessary for patches containing controlled drugs, in secure environments (e.g. prisons, secure hospitals) and in some patient groups.\n\nRecord the incident\n\nDocument that the patch has fallen off using the locally agreed method for documentation:\n\nSeek advice from the prescriber if there is concern that treatment has been interrupted or a new prescription is necessary.\n\nSignificant blood concentrations may exist for up to 24 hours because of the reservoir of medicine within the skin , but in some cases, dose re-titration may be recommended. Refer to the manufacturer’s literature.\n\nBe aware there is a risk of misappropriation with patches containing controlled drugs.\n\nApply a new patch\n\nApply a new patch to a different part of the body, once it has been confirmed that the patch has fallen off:\n\nContinue to change the patch on the usual day and time. e.g. if the patch is normally changed on a Monday and it falls off on Wednesday, replace it on Wednesday and change it as usual on Monday.\n\nFollow our advice on before application and during application.\n\nConsider using surgical adhesive tape (e.g. Micropore ® ) to the edges to help with patch adherence.\n\nMonitor for adverse effects\n\nMonitor for increased adverse effects (due to potential increased serum concentrations) or loss of efficacy:\n\nReport any cases of accidental exposure where harm has occurred via the local incident reporting system or suspected side effects via the Yellow Card Scheme (www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard).\n\nIn all cases, when unsure or concerned, seek advice from the prescriber or pharmacist.\n\nOmitted or delayed patch application\n\nDocument that the patch has been omitted or delayed using the locally agreed method for documentation.\n\nSeek advice from the prescriber if there is concern that treatment has been interrupted or a new prescription is necessary.\n\nSignificant blood concentrations may exist for up to 24 hours because of the reservoir of medicine within the skin but in some cases dose re-titration may be recommended. Refer to the manufacturer’s literature.\n\nApply a new patch to a different part of the body\n\nContinue to change the patch on the usual day and time e.g. if the patch is normally changed on a Monday but you have now been applied it on Wednesday, change it as usual on the next Monday.\n\nFollow our advice on before application and during application.\n\nMonitor for loss of efficacy.\n\nSwitching to and from patches\n\nAlways seek advice from the prescriber, pharmacist or the Medicines Information service if are unsure on the appropriate gap to leave when switching to and from patches. This is important because:\n\nBlood concentrations of the medicine increase gradually after patch application and decrease gradually when removed.\n\nThe time taken can vary considerably depending on the design of the patch and the active ingredient.\n\nLeaving an inappropriate gap can lead to toxicity or medicine interactions.\n\nLeaving an inappropriate gap can reduce therapeutic effect.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can heat transdermal patches containing metal components and cause a small increase in body temperature:\n\nThis can result in skin burns or drug toxicity.\n\nFentanyl and buprenorphine patches are known to result in serious overdose.\n\nIt can be difficult to accurately confirm which patches contain metal.\n\nAdvice for all transdermal patches during MRI:\n\nRemove the transdermal patch before the person enters the MRI scan room. Significant blood concentrations may exist for short periods because of the reservoir of medicine within the skin.\n\nReplace with a new patch straight after the scan. Follow our advice on before application and during application.\n\nUpdate records when the replacement patch is applied. Follow our advice under record and document.\n\nContinue to change the patch on the usual day and time e.g. if the patch is normally changed on a Monday and the scan is on Wednesday, replace it on Wednesday after the scan and change it as usual on Monday.\n\nRecord and document\n\nUse a locally agreed method\n\nThe following written or electronic methods are suitable to record key information:\n\nMedication administration record (MAR) charts or hospital medication charts\n\nElectronic prescribing and administration systems (EPMA)\n\nTransdermal patch application record sheets or body maps.\n\nTransdermal patch application record sheets or body maps do not replace the need to record administration on prescribing and administration systems (MAR chart, medication chart or EPMA).\n\nExamples (non-SPS content):\n\nNHS Wales Aneurin Bevan University Health Board\n\nTransdermal patch placement chart\n\n14 day patch rotation chart\n\nKey information to record\n\nDate and time of application\n\nSite of application (e.g. upper right arm)\n\nNumber of patches\n\nFrequency and interval between patch application\n\nDate and time of removal\n\nBrand of patch and strength\n\nPatches containing controlled drugs\n\nFollow local procedures for documentation in the controlled drug register during patch application and removal.\n\nAt transfer of care\n\nMedication errors can occur with patches during the transition of care. To reduce the risk of errors do the following:\n\nCommunicate the key information to record (listed above) when transferring people between settings.\n\nProvide a copy of records (including the transdermal patch sheet or body map).\n\nMonitor\n\nIn addition to regular medicine specific monitoring, we recommend people using transdermal patches are monitored for the following.\n\nPatch is in the correct position\n\nWe recommend to regularly check (e.g. every day) that the patch is in the correct position according to records. Document that the check has occurred using the locally agreed documentation.\n\nSigns and symptoms of overdose\n\nBe aware of signs and symptoms of toxicity from the medicine in the patch. Refer to information in the professional and patient literature on the Electronic Medicines Compendium (eMC) or provided with the packaging:\n\nMonitor the person for toxicity and seek medical attention immediately if overdose is suspected.\n\nBe aware that external heat and fever can increase the absorption of some medicines through the skin into the bloodstream and increased side-effects can occur.\n\nRemove patches before an MRI as there is a risk of medicine toxicity due to a possible small increase in body temperature.\n\nIt is recommended people using patches should avoid:\n\nHeat pads, electric blankets or hot water bottles\n\nSoaking in a hot bath, sauna or sunbathing for long periods of time.\n\nApplication site reactions\n\nPatches can cause local reactions which present as contact dermatitis with erythema (redness of the skin), rash, vesicles (small fluid-filled sacs or blisters), burning, stinging or itching. This can be related to poor patch application technique.\n\nMinimise risk\n\nTo reduce the risk of application site reactions:\n\nEnsure the manufacturer’s instructions have been correctly followed.\n\nFollow our advice on before application and at removal.\n\nOur key advice is to:\n\nremove patches carefully to minimise skin irritation.\n\nensure the skin is not broken, irritated or frail.\n\nrotate the site at each application.\n\nclean the irritated site with water.\n\nSeek further advice\n\nDiscuss with the prescriber when:\n\nLocal reactions persist. A decision to remove the patch should be done on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIf an allergic reaction is suspected to the ingredients or adhesive:\n\nCheck if the person has known medicine, excipient or chemical allergies.\n\nConfirm the brand of the patch as alternative brands may be suitable.\n\nDocument the suspected allergy in the person’s medical records.\n\nOther national advice on using patches\n\nMHRA Alerts\n\nThe MHRA has issued safety alerts for the following transdermal patches. All staff involved in administering these patches should be aware of the risks.\n\nFentanyl\n\nIn 2014, the MHRA highlighted the risk of life threatening harm from accidental exposure of fentanyl patches.\n\nReports of preventable accidental transfer of fentanyl patches have continued in recent years. The MHRA provide advice and actions to reduce the risk of:\n\nSerious and fatal overdose of fentanyl patches\n\nLife-threatening and fatal opioid toxicity from accidental exposure.\n\nHarm, including fatalities, in opioid-naïve patients\n\nRivastigmine\n\nMedication errors and inappropriate use of the rivastigmine transdermal patch have been reported, some of which resulted in overdose.\n\nThe MHRA advise patients and carers on the correct use of rivastigmine.\n\nPatient Information\n\nThe following leaflets are helpful if people would like to know more about their medicines or if they are being discharged home on a patch.\n\nNHS Patient Leaflets on fentanyl and buprenorphine.\n\nManufacturers’ Patient Information Leaflets are available as:\n\nPaper copies inside the product packaging\n\nElectronically on the Electronic Medicines Compendium (eMC).\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe are hugely grateful for input from NHS colleagues including pharmacists, technicians and nurses from the following sectors:\n\nAcute Trusts\n\nCare Homes\n\nClinical Commissioning Groups\n\nHealth and Justice\n\nPrimary Care Networks\n\nCare Quality Commission.
