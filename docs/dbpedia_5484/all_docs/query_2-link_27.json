A rival format was Sony’s Betamax, introduced in 1975. Both formats competed against each other in the marketplace during the latter part of the 1970s and into the 1980s. Eventually, VHS won the format war and Betamax slipped into obsolescence.Footnote 1 VHS boomed in the pre-recorded video market and blank tapes were popular for recording television programs in the home and for use with camcorders. For many years, VHS was in widespread useFootnote 2 and is consequently the most prevalent video format found in heritage institutions.\n\nFormat variations\n\nThere are four basic formats of VHS cassettes: standard VHS, compact VHS (or VHS-C), super VHS (or S-VHS), and compact S-VHS (or S-VHS-C).\n\nStandard VHS\n\nVHS cassettes make use of half-inch wide tape. The most common and standard cassette size is about 18.7 cm (7.4 inches) by 10.2 cm (4.0 inches) by 2.5 cm (1 inch). When purchasing blank VHS cassettes, the lengths of tape are well defined and are labeled with the letter “T” followed by a number, representing the recording time at SP speed mode. The letter “T” is used for NTSC video recordings, whereas the letter “E” is used for PAL or SECAM ones. NTSC, PAL and SECAM are the analog television standards that are used worldwide. For example, NTSC is used in North America, Japan and parts of South America; PAL is used mostly in Europe, Africa, Southern Asia and parts of South America; and SECAM is prevalent in Northern Asia and parts of Europe and Africa. These standards are not compatible with each other and therefore conversion is required in order to view a VHS recording made using one television system and viewed on another one. This document will focus on NTSC recorded tapes. Table 1 lists the common NTSC labels associated with blank VHS cassettes.\n\nTable 1. Blank VHS cassette tape lengths and recording times associated with different recording modes (NTSC only)\n\nLabel\n\nNTSC Recording Time SP Mode\n\n(minutes)\n\nNTSC Recording Time LP Mode\n\n(minutes)\n\nNTSC Recording Time EP Mode\n\n(minutes)\n\nT-20\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nT-30\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\nT-45\n\n45\n\n90\n\n135\n\nT-60\n\n60\n\n120\n\n180\n\nT-90\n\n90\n\n180\n\n270\n\nT-120\n\n120\n\n240\n\n360\n\nT-160\n\n160\n\n320\n\n480\n\nT-180\n\n180\n\n360\n\n540\n\nCollections may also contain VHS cassettes that are loaded with non-standard amounts of tape, as was common with recordings that were distributed by duplication houses. Pre-recorded content on VHS also has a variable amount of tape in the cassette, depending on the length of the content.\n\nThe SP setting is the most commonly used mode, and most pre-recorded movies use this setting. The LP mode runs at one half of the speed of the SP mode, and the EP mode (sometimes referred to as the SLP mode) records at one third of the SP mode. These longer recording times are used in order to maximize the amount of video that can be stored on one cassette, which limits the amount of tapes and provides cost savings. However, as the recording speed slows, the quality suffers. Therefore, SP provides the highest quality video and audio recordings and the EP mode provides the poorest.\n\nEven though VHS was used extensively, it is an inferior video format when compared to many others that have been produced. Table 2 lists the maximum lines of horizontal resolution for a variety of analog and digital video formats. The number of lines of horizontal resolution is a measure of the quality of the video recording.\n\nTable 2. A comparison of video quality between different formats Footnote 3\n\nFormat\n\nMaximum Lines of Horizontal Resolution\n\nVHS/VHS-C\n\n240*\n\nBetamax\n\n250\n\n8 mm\n\n280\n\nS-VHS/S-VHS-C\n\n400\n\nLaserdisc\n\n425\n\nHi8\n\n440\n\nDigital 8\n\n500\n\nminiDV\n\n520\n\nCommercial DVD\n\n540\n\nCommercial Blu-ray\n\n1080\n\n*VHS tapes labeled with the letters HQ were slightly better in horizontal resolution at 250 lines.\n\nVHS-C\n\nThe VHS-C format was introduced in 1982 and uses standard VHS tape but in a smaller cassette housing (Figure 1). This format was designed to be used in conjunction with smaller and more portable VCRs but then also became popular with less bulky VHS camcorders. The compact cassette size is 9.2 cm (3.6 inches) by 5.5 cm (2.2 inches) by 2.0 cm (0.8 inches) and, because of this smaller size, an adapter cassette is required in order to play it in a regular VCR. No signal conversion or any other adjustments are required when playing VHS-Cs in VCRs designed for standard sized cassettes. In SP mode, the maximum recording time for a VHS-C cassette is 60 minutes.\n\nS-VHS\n\nWhereas VHS is considered poor quality, the S-VHS format is a considerable improvement. It makes use of professional grade equipment and is aimed at the industrial and education markets instead of the home consumer. S-VHS was introduced in 1987 once again by JVC and provided an improved horizontal resolution to approximately 400 lines, improved chrominance (colour) and superior tape quality. The S-VHS tape width and cassette size are the same as the standard VHS format but the S-VHS tape requires an S-VHS VCR for proper playback. Both VHS and S-VHS often have logos imprinted on the cassettes, usually at the top right corner when viewing the front of the cassette, that can be used to identify the format (Figure 2). Some standard VCRs can playback S-VHS at VHS resolution if they have the S-VHS Quasi Playback feature, otherwise the video quality will be poor, highlighted by high brightness levels and image instability. VHS can be played in S-VHS machines and recorded in S-VHS machines with S-VHS-ET technology. Note that LP-recorded VHS tapes may not play properly in some S-VHS VCRs because these machines do not have an LP mode. The results will be that the video plays too fast and that irregular horizontal noise bands will appear in the image.\n\nS-VHS-C\n\nAs for VHS, S-VHS has a compact cassette version (introduced in 1987) for use in camcorders, referred to as an S-VHS-C. An S-VHS adapter cassette is required in order to play it in a regular S-VHS machine.\n\nVHS tapes are near end-of-life\n\nVHS is still in use today but its popularity has significantly decreased. There are a number of reasons for this decline such as the introduction and popularity of superior movie distribution formats like DVDs (in 1997) and Blu-ray discs (in 2006). In 2003, sales of movies on DVD format surpassed those of VHSFootnote 4 and, finally, in 2006,Footnote 5 after a long run, the major movie studios stopped releasing movies on VHS.\n\nIn addition, VCRs have been rapidly replaced for home recording by PVRs, which use a hard disk drive to record television programming, are more versatile and are convenient to use. With the exploding popularity of high-definition television sets, the VHS format simply cannot deliver the amount of detail that these sets can output. The shift in the use of camcorders from the bulky VHS to more compact Hi8 and, more recently, digital has also led to the decline in the use of VHS.\n\nThe family of VHS formats is considered outdated. VCR stand-alone units are no longer being manufacturedFootnote 6 as of 2014, although DVD/VCR, DVD-R/VCR and even Blu-ray/VCR units are being produced. VHS is still being used extensively in some parts of the world and in certain communities,Footnote 7 and blank tapes are being manufactured to a limited extent, although their quality is suspect. It is noteworthy that many households and organizations, even though they may have updated to better formats, still possess one or more working VCRs.\n\nDespite the availability of tapes and also equipment to play VHS videos, there is a serious concern about this format. On average, magnetic tape has a lifetime of 10 to 30 years and because the VHS format has been in existence for over 35 years, much of the media in collections today are in the latter part of their lifetime. VHS tapes cannot be stored indefinitely with expectation of future retrieval of the recorded information. Therefore, now is the ideal time to migrate or convert the recordings off of old VHS tape and into a new video format, while VHS playback devices are readily available. As more time passes, there is a greater risk of increased tape deterioration. This makes the tape more difficult to play and costly to migrate because remedial actions will be required to make it play properly. Waiting also results in the reduced availability of playback devices that are in good condition. This may lead to only an outside organization being able to perform the conversion process since it would have the equipment and expertise to do the work, but this also generally means a significant rise in cost for most projects.\n\nMigration is necessary\n\nThe information stored on these analog tapes needs to be migrated to a newer format if it is to remain accessible. There are basically two migration options: analog to analog migration (e.g. information from old VHS cassettes being copied onto new VHS tape, often referred to as refreshing) or analog to digital migration, where the VHS video is changed to a totally different form.\n\nThe analog to analog migration strategy is not recommended for a number of reasons. First, analog to analog migrations generally lead to a loss in quality from one generation to the next. Projecting this over several migrations into the future would result in a very poor video recording. The second reason is the upcoming obsolescence of VHS. Although not currently in a high risk category for obsolescence,Footnote 8 the amount and availability of good machines and tapes are declining, and this situation is continually becoming worse. In addition, there is little expectation of future support for this and other analog formats. Finally, analog migrations are very labour intensive. This option will therefore not be discussed further in this document.\n\nThe best option to preserve VHS tapes and, in fact, all other analog videotape formats is an analog to digital migration to a data file, as opposed to a specific digital video format (e.g. Digital Betacam). Digitization to a specific digital video format ties the recording to specific equipment and media, meaning that only this equipment can play the tape. Limiting how information can be accessed is not ideal in terms of preservation. On the other hand, a data file has greater flexibility and can be stored on any type of digital storage media and can be played using a wide variety of software media players. This is a better scenario for the long-term preservation of the video content. Conversion of analog recordings into data files will not only preserve them, but also make them more accessible to researchers and other interested parties, assuming the appropriate access infrastructure and metadata (information that describes the recording) associated with the files are properly put into place.\n\nThere are many other advantages. For example, there is potential for no quality loss with future migrations, depending on how the initial and subsequent digital migrations are performed. In addition, digitization simplifies mass transfers from one carrier to another because the transfer can be automated, saving significant labour costs. Once an item is digitized, it can easily be certified that digital copies are exactly the same as the original. Copies of the digital master can be produced that would be equal in every respect to it. Another advantage with digital conversion is that data can be transmitted electronically and without the use of physical media or regular mail. Digitization along with the inclusion of information about the digital file will allow the information to be more easily searchable than it was in its previous analog form. Finally, in the digital domain, error correction systems are in place to correct some problems that may occur with the file or media.\n\nAlthough the conversion of analog recordings to data files is the preferred preservation pathway, there are certain disadvantages that must be noted. Poor sampling or digitizing of the original analog record means that the digital version is not an accurate representation of the original and, if data compression schemes that eliminate data to save storage space (i.e. “lossy” compression) are chosen, then some data from the master analog recordings will be forever lost. Digital media generally have shorter lifetimes than analog media, and digital storage technologies tend to change more rapidly than the older analog technologies did. Therefore, more frequent migrations to new technologies, approximately every 5 to 10 years for some technologies, are required in order to preserve the content. Finally, whereas analog media tend to degrade slowly over time, digital media or files may be suddenly unreadable, without warning, which is problematic.\n\nPurpose of this Technical Bulletin\n\nIdeally, digitization for preservation should be performed at the highest quality and this generally involves the use of high-end and moderately expensive to very costly approaches. Unfortunately, many institutions lack the funds for the professional digitization of NTSC VHS videotapes. This Technical Bulletin provides information and procedures that small to mid-size heritage institutions can use to digitize NTSC VHS videotapes in their collections. A variety of in-house options are provided, including lower cost ones that may not be ideal but will still allow institutions to digitize their VHS videotape collections now.\n\nThe cost-effective options provided in this Technical Bulletin should produce reasonable results, but more costly options are also discussed that may provide better quality and flexibility going into the future. Higher end digitization of video is usually only available to well-equipped institutions with highly knowledgeable and trained staff, unless the work is outsourced. If several options are available, it is recommended to perform some tests in order to determine the quality of the end product and the system that works best for your organization. An organization should choose the highest quality option that is within its means.\n\nThere is no standard for video file format or digitization software to use or on how to store the digitized video. The results of a recent surveyFootnote 9 where 21 archives, representing a wide cross-section of size, mission and focus with audiovisual holdings, showed that 12 different file and video formats with varying technical parameters are being used for the production of digital preservation masters. This underscores the fact that certain standards for video preservation are lacking. In light of this, each institution needs to decide what is acceptable and what is not for their needs today and into the future. Often, this is a balance between ideal digitization and the realities of the costs associated with managing and storing the large files generated from a conversion project.Footnote 10 Waiting for an ideal video preservation format is problematic and will likely lead to a loss of assets.\n\nOutsourcing the Digitization\n\nPrior to investing time and resources into an in-house digitization project, it is worthy to investigate outsourcing in order to see if it is a viable option. At the very least, consideration should be given to using a professional service that will use high-end equipment and software for high quality and/or highly valuable recordings. This is likely not required for all the records in a collection and therefore a mix of strategies can be an effective method for successfully completing the digitization of the VHS videotape collection.\n\nIn addition, there are other cases where it may not be reasonable or cost‑effective to perform the digitization of VHS videotapes in-house as explained below:\n\nProblem cassettes (those where the cassette and/or tape inside it are not in good condition) could suffer further damage if they are played before the problems are remedied. In such cases, professional help or at least a consultation with a professional should be pursued before digitization is attempted.\n\nSmall collections may not be able to justify the expense to purchase or lease the equipment to set up a transfer facility and learn how to operate it effectively. In many instances, it may be more cost-effective to outsource the work, especially if no playback or other equipment is readily available. For small collections that have most of the necessary machines, and for mid‑sized to large collections, money can be saved by doing the work in-house, but this is only true if at least a portion of the work is done by volunteers or by employees who have spare time outside of their other assignments. If the transfer operator is a full‑time salaried employee, at the end of the day, this work might end up costing more than if it were outsourced.\n\nWhat to look for when outsourcing\n\nWhen outsourcing, there are certain questions that need to be asked and details that need to be sorted out in order to ensure that the digitization goals of the organization are met. These include the following:\n\nask for references from the outsourcing companies and ask other institutions for recommendations and their past experiences with vendors they have used\n\nlook at the credentials and credits of the organizations under consideration; qualifications of staff and experience; how long they have been doing transfers; what analog formats they specialize in (VHS only or other video formats as well)—organizations that only digitize VHS tapes may not produce the quality that is required\n\ntalk with the people involved with doing the work and do not hesitate to ask about specific challenges if you think your tapes are suffering from deterioration or damage\n\ndiscuss the shipping procedures, for example, how will the tapes be packed and what temperature and humidity environment will they be exposed to, and costs involved in shipping the originals or masters to and from the outsourcing organization; the shipping costs alone may make outsourcing prohibitive for smaller organizations\n\nverify whether the outsourcing company has insurance to cover loss of the materials during shipping or when the tape is being used\n\ndetermine how the originals will be stored and handled while with the outsourcing organization\n\ndetermine what equipment will be used to perform the digitization\n\nwill a TBC be used and will there be any other corrections made to the analog video, such as noise reduction, etc., prior to digitizing?\n\nis the playback machine regularly cleaned, aligned and maintained?\n\ndiscuss the available options for the quality of the digitization, the file format, and the delivery of the digitized content (i.e. on which type[s] of media)\n\nverify whether metadata will be provided/embedded in the digitized video files and how the files will be named\n\nestablish up front what the added costs would be for cleaning the tapes if necessary and especially for remedial procedures to make problem ones playable, because dealing with these tapes can raise the cost of outsourcing significantly\n\nensure that a priority list is established; begin with the most valuable material and proceed to other material if funds remain or become available in the future\n\nIt is prudent to do some trials with the outsource organization to test for quality and for satisfaction with the end product before committing to a larger scale project.\n\nMore guidance on how to develop a request for proposal for outsourcing the digitizing of video can be found in the Guide to Developing a Request for Proposal for the Digitization of Video (and More) [PDF version] by Chris Lacinak, which is available for free.\n\nOverview of the In-House Digitization Workflow\n\nThe basic procedure for digitizing the VHS format is summarized in Figure 3. Information on each step will be provided in this Bulletin.\n\nEvaluation of Tape and Cassette Condition\n\nThe first step in the workflow is to evaluate the condition of the cassette and tape. Deficiencies in one or both of these will impact the playback performance and ultimately the quality of the digitized video. All tapes should be visually inspected for signs of deterioration or damage and those with physical or chemical damage will need some form of treatment before they can be played. In most cases, successful recovery requires the services of a professional restorer. Some remedies can be performed in-houseFootnote 11 but success depends on the experience of the individual and the degree of degradation. Failure to remedy issues before playing the tape may result in loss of the video and damage to the playback equipment.\n\nA proper evaluation involves conducting a thorough condition survey of the materials in the collection while focusing on the following factors, which are discussed in more detail below:\n\ncassette condition\n\ntape quality\n\ntape condition\n\npresence of contaminants\n\nchemical degradation of tape\n\nphysical damage to tape\n\ncleaning of tape\n\nCassette condition\n\nThe cassette shell should be examined for signs of damage that, if found, could mean that the tape within it has also been compromised. Playing a damaged VHS cassette may not only damage or destroy the tape (stretching, breaking, tearing or edge damage) but also the playback equipment. Some typical cassette problems include cracks in the housing, a broken or missing window, broken reel flanges, hubs that have seized and do not freely rotate or are stripped, and a broken or improperly functioning cassette door. VHS cassette hubs have a lock feature that prevents them from turning when the cassette is not being used and therefore prevents the wind from becoming loose. In order to test that the hubs are functioning properly, the small button located between and below the hubs, as shown in Figure 4, needs to be depressed and held while gently rotating the take-up reel. Do not use excessive force if the hubs are not turning. The functioning of the cassette door can be verified by depressing the small release button found towards the top right side of the cassette, as shown in Figure 5. Once the button is pressed, the spring action of the door can be tested for smooth movement.\n\nLightly shaking a cassette and listening for excessive rattling noises can help determine if there is any internal damage. Note that the hubs normally do move around a little and will produce some rattle. Looking through the window of the cassette while moving it may lead to the discovery of loose parts within the housing.\n\nIf the cassette is damaged, it is recommended that the tape is transferred to a new shell so that it will play properly and without being damaged. Although this can be a challenging procedure for the inexperienced due to the many small parts (Figure 6), it can be done. If attempting to perform this type of repair, it is a good idea to practice on a discarded VHS cassette and to have an open one available for reference. Ideally, a shell from the exact same brand should be used, but generic cassette shells are also available and can be equally useful.\n\nTape quality\n\nWhen evaluating the condition of the VHS tape, it is worth taking note of the brand. Generic brands or those without a recognizable manufacturer brand name are generally inferior and likely to exhibit more dropouts or momentary signal losses during play, higher wear rate and other problems caused by shedding magnetic oxide material, such as video head clogging and contamination of the tape transport. Brand name tapes experience less of these problems, although a brand name does not always guarantee a good product because batch-to-batch variations do occur.\n\nVHS tape is often labeled (usually on the external packaging for the cassette but sometimes on the cassette itself) with a designation such as Standard Grade, High Grade or Extra High Grade. Although there is no standard for what these terms mean, High Grade and Extra High Grade generally refer to a better and more durable product, although in some cases there may not be a significant difference. Also, these terms only have meaning within the same brand. A high grade labeled tape from one manufacturer may be inferior to a standard grade one from another. Therefore, although generally useful, determining tape quality based on brand name and tape grading system can be unreliable in some cases.\n\nTape condition\n\nBecause videotape is in a cassette, the evaluation of its condition is not straightforward. One thing that can be done without opening the cassette housing is an inspection of a small portion of tape as well as of the two inner guide posts in the cassette. In order to perform this inspection, the cassette door needs to be opened and the hub lock released as described above under Cassette condition. The door should be propped open so that it will not slam shut on the tape. Once the hub lock is released, a small amount of tape can be pulled away from the posts. Always use lint-free cotton gloves when handling tape to avoid fingerprint contamination. Examine for contaminants or any damage. More importantly, examine the posts for any signs of buildup. This may be from degradation of the tape binder, which will appear as black or white debris, likely from lubricant breakdown. There may also simply be buildup from general dust or dirt particles. If anything is noticed on the tape or posts, then a good cleaning of the whole tape is required prior to it being played. After the inspection, ensure that the hub is turned so as to gather up the loosened tape so that it is snug. More advice on tape inspection can be found in ISO 18933:2012, Imaging Materials — Magnetic Tape — Care and Handling Practices for Extended Usage.Footnote 12\n\nPresence of contaminants\n\nOne of the first things to look for when visually inspecting a tape is contamination, which can appear in many forms.\n\nDust, dirt, liquids and other debris\n\nThe most common types of contaminants are dust and dirt. Other types of debris include smoke particles, skin flakes, fingerprints, particulates from deteriorating or damaged cassettes or storage containers (in particular, paper sleeves), and white powder or crystalline residue on tape edges from lubricant breakdown. Although not common with the VHS format, there may be adhesive residue from poorly made or aged splices. If debris is present on a tape and it is played, a separation will occur between the tape surface and the read heads. This separation will cause a signal loss. Particulates wound between tape layers will eventually cause permanent impressions in the surface of the tape and also result in signal losses or dropouts. Debris also contaminates and damages the read/record heads and other parts of the equipment. Finally, dust, dirt and other debris can scratch the tape as it plays, leading to signal losses and equipment contamination. It is possible that tapes may have come in contact with various liquids; stained labels are a good indication that this has occurred. Liquids are problematic because they can accelerate degradation and result in tape layers tightly sticking together.\n\nFungus or mould\n\nThese types of contaminants usually appear as fuzzy or thread-like growths that vary in colour but are commonly black, brown, dark yellow or mustard-coloured. A musty odour may be present and especially noticeable immediately after opening a closed storage container. If it is known that the tapes have been exposed to high humidity or, even worse, a water disaster event, then the presence of mould is a good possibility. If no knowledge of the history is known, look for signs of water damage on the cassette, the container or any labels. Look for mould on the inside of the container and inside the cassette housing. In particular, focus on the edges of wound tape.\n\nTapes contaminated with mould should be bagged and isolated from the rest of the collection material and dealt with by experts in mould remediation because mould is a health hazard. If treatment is attempted in-house, proper safety procedures and safety equipmentFootnote 13 need to be used by anyone handling or exposed to the mouldy items.\n\nWhen assessing a mould problem, if the mould smears when it is rubbed, it is considered active and, in this state, should not be cleaned. If the mould has the appearance of a dry powder, it is likely dormant. An active mould can be driven into dormancy by storing the affected item in a dry environment (less than 40% RH). Once dormant, the mould can be cleaned.Footnote 11 However, mould is difficult to eliminate completely and any traces left behind will result in a resurgence of the problem should the RH rise above about 65%. Mould is also very invasive and will penetrate between layers of wound tape. This scenario would require an extensive amount of cleaning beyond a surface wiping or vacuuming of the exterior of the wound tape pack and is beyond the scope of work that can be performed by non-experts in mould remediation.\n\nFinally, mouldy tapes should never be played as they will contaminate the equipment. Tapes that are subsequently played on the machine will become contaminated unless thorough and extensive cleaning is performed.\n\nPests (insects and rodents)\n\nIf tapes have been exposed to pests, it is possible that contaminants, such as droppings and urine, may have been left behind. Also, there may be a certain amount of gnawing damage on the tape, cassette shell or storage container, resulting in a significant amount of debris. Cleaning and repair will be required prior to playback. Tapes with droppings should be handled with appropriate personal protective equipment.\n\nChemical degradation of tape\n\nVHS tape is composed of a polyester plastic base coated with a polyester urethane binder material containing magnetic oxide particles. It is these oxide particles that hold the video signal. The polyester base is very stable and chemical degradation is not an issue under normal storage conditions. The magnetic oxide material is generally very stable as well and signal losses due to changes in the magnetic oxide are usually not significant over the lifetime of the tape. The main chemical degradation problem is the decomposition of the binder layer via hydrolysis. This is a reaction between the binder polymer and water molecules and results in a tape that can be very difficult to play. Binder hydrolysis, also known as the “sticky shed syndrome,” is more prominent in audio reel-to-reel tapes but is also present in videotape formats. This degradation can be identified by:\n\nthe presence of a pungent waxy or “dirty-socks”-type odour immediately detected when a tight storage container is opened (avoid direct smelling but instead fan air towards nose)\n\nstickiness when the tape is unwound\n\nsqueals when the tape is played\n\nbinder and magnetic particles readily flaking off the tape base resulting in sections of missing binder material (Figure 7)\n\nThe oxide flakes may be present inside the container or visible through the clear VHS cassette window. Often, there is no oxide loss until the tape is played and, as it plays, the oxide/binder debris accumulates on the posts and heads of the VCR. This buildup causes picture noise, friction and squealing that become progressively worse when playing the tape. Depending on the degree of degradation, the tape will also stick repeatedly to the equipment parts making play extremely difficult. In more severe cases, the tape may completely stop during play. Fast winding the tape will often not be smooth, and a slapping or knocking sound may be heard during the process. In addition to picture noise, playing a tape with binder hydrolysis can produce a video image with side-to-side ripples or a wavy appearance.\n\nPlaying a tape with binder degradation can lead to loss of the recording. Therefore, if obvious signs of binder degradation are present (debris and squealing), the tape should not be played or should be immediately stopped, and a treatment should be undertaken. Tapes should always be monitored during play.\n\nThe popular treatment for binder hydrolysis is “baking” or exposing the tape to moderate heat (less than 50ºC) for a period of 4 to 24 hours.Footnote 11 Footnote 14 Other treatments involve cleaning the tape surface with a lint-free fabric or desiccating it at room temperature or in cool conditions.Footnote 11 Footnote 15 These types of treatments should only be performed by individuals experienced in these methods. Baking and other remedies, if not performed properly, can lead to complete loss of the recording.\n\nPhysical damage to tape\n\nVHS tape is a thin medium and, consequently, is vulnerable to physical damage in many forms. In fact, many of the playback problems associated with videotape can be linked to a physical problem. This damage will result in reduced playback performance for the recording, represented by moderate to severe dropouts, the complete loss of picture in the damaged sections, or poor audio. Playing physically damaged tape can lead to additional damage, complete loss of the recording or damage to the VCR. Prior to playing, it is imperative that the tape condition is diligently assessed for physical damage and, if any is evident, remedial action is required.\n\nThere are characteristic physical damage problems that are associated with magnetic tape plus basic remedies for these problems to restore proper playback, for example:\n\nbreakage – results in an unplayable tape and requires a proper splice to be made, which may lead to possible loss of some content\n\nstretching and tears – results in image skewing to the left or right; the stretched or torn tape needs to be cut out and the good ends properly spliced together (note that there will be loss of content due to the missing piece of tape)\n\nwrinkles – cause a degradation in playback quality depending on the amount of wrinkling and is characterized by horizontal bands of picture noise lines rolling from top to bottom or bottom to top; if severe, the tape may jam in the equipment; wrinkled sections might need to be removed or, alternatively, smoothed out using techniques such as the application of mild heat under pressure, but such techniques should only be performed by a professional tape restoration expert\n\nfolds or cinches – describes tape that has folded over onto itself and created a crease or creases, often many in a row, creating an accordion look; this often occurs when the tension in the tape pack is too loose, allowing gaps to form in the pack; the problems encountered and remedies are similar to wrinkles in the tape, described above\n\ncupping – occurs when the tape deforms in the shape of the letter U and results in poor head-to-tape contact, creating dropouts or noise lines that cannot be removed with player adjustments; flattening techniques such as those used for wrinkles may be required\n\nscratches – result in dropouts or stationary noise band lines for longitudinal scratches, or noise bands drifting either down to up or up to down for diagonal scratches, if the magnetic oxide signal carrying layer has been affected; there are no remedies to repair losses caused by scratches, and scratched tapes that are played can contaminate the VCR\n\nedge damage – describes any type of damage to the top or bottom edges of the tape that can lead to information loss or significant playback problems; depending on the type of damage, some of the remedies discussed above may be required\n\nNote that improperly made splices can damage the VCR heads. The use of splices should therefore be limited as much as possible. When they are required, the appropriate splicing tape and splicing block should be used. Never try to perform free cuts and never use regular pressure sensitive tape (i.e. Scotch tape) to make the splice. CCI Technical Bulletin 27 Remedies for Deteriorated or Damaged Modern Information Carriers further discusses splicing and other problems, and provides more details on remedial actions where they exist.\n\nA key to determining physical damage to the cassette and tape is inspection of the storage container. If it is showing signs of damage, it is possible that the cassette or tape may also be damaged.\n\nCleaning of tape\n\nBecause of the many problems caused by debris and other contaminants, contaminated tapes should never be played without proper treatment. Cleaning will improve playback performance significantly.\n\nIf the videos have been stored in debris-proof containers and in known debris-free environments, then cleaning before digitization is generally not required. Cleaning should not be performed on tapes when it is not required in order to avoid damaging the tapes unnecessarily. Containers that are covered in debris should be vacuumed or wiped clean with a lint-free cloth and moistened if necessary prior to removing the cassette from the container in order to avoid contaminating it. If there is contamination inside the storage container but it is limited to the outside of the cassette, cleaning can be easily performed in-house. The same cleaning procedures outlined above for storage containers can be followed with cassettes that have debris on them, being careful to not suck up the tape if using a vacuum. Debris in a storage container should be cleaned prior to returning the cassette to it or, if contamination is significant, the container should be replaced.\n\nAny debris or other contaminants, including liquid contaminants, within the cassette shell and in between tape layers will require a more extensive cleaning effort. Cleaning of VHS tapes is generally performed with a device that begins by running the tape at high speed first over a burnishing blade to remove tightly adhered debris and smooth out the surface. A Pellon tissue (a non-abrasive, non-lint producing fabric) wiping stage follows to remove loosely held debris. Although this type of cleaner performs well on new tapes and eliminates dropouts caused by debris, it is too rough on older ones or those that have chemical or physical degradation issues. In this latter scenario, a specialized cleaner that is less aggressive is required to avoid completely damaging the fragile older tapes. Modifications of standard equipment, such as removing the burnishing blade and reducing the speed, may help reduce the risk of damage. Alternatively, there is also the option of hand wiping the tape using Pellon tissue. This is a very labour intensive process and there is a high risk of damage if not performed carefully.\n\nIf the contamination on the tape is due to residue from old splices, this residue should be cleaned and the splices remade with appropriate splicing material for videotape.Footnote 11\n\nCleaning of tape wound in a cassette is not a straightforward process. Once more extensive cleaning than the basic procedures outlined above is necessary, then specialized equipment and expertise is required that is beyond the capability of most non-experts in tape remediation. In these situations, cleaning of contaminated tapes should be left to companies equipped and trained to handle heavily contaminated and older fragile tapes.\n\nSelection of Material to Be Digitized\n\nChecks should be made to ensure that the material has not been previously digitized or an acceptable digital copy does not already exist, scenarios which would reduce the workload. Based on each individual institution’s mandate, it has to decide what videos are valuable and should be preserved and what should not. Footnote 16 Footnote 17 Digitization is not a minor effort and eliminating materials that have been properly appraised by the collecting institution and deemed insignificant will have a substantial impact on the resources required. The days of collecting and preserving everything are gone, and existing resources need to be used wisely.\n\nPrioritizing for digitization\n\nOnce the decisions have been made for the selection of material to be digitized, the next step is prioritization. In most cases, funds are limited and the recordings will likely be dealt with over several years as funds become available. Therefore, it is essential that certain materials are digitized first. Other than the fact that a recording has been deemed to be of high value, historical or otherwise, and these recordings should be the top priority for digitization, there is no other straightforward way to determine what should be digitized first. One way of quantifying the prioritization is to use a triage system as illustrated in Table 3.\n\nTable 3. A triage system for prioritizing the digitization of VHS videotapes Footnote 18\n\nQuestion\n\nPoint value if YES\n\nPlaying the Tape\n\nSelecting and outfitting the space\n\nThe initial step in any digital conversion project is to set up a workstation or work area. Ideally, a separate clean and quiet room should be used for the transfers described in this Technical Bulletin. The room should be equipped with a dedicated 15 A 120 V circuit to feed the video and computer equipment (i.e. no other electrical source such as lights should be on this circuit).\n\nIn terms of the play environment, tapes should not be played under high humidity conditions as this promotes the tape sticking to the spinning heads and other machine parts. This, in turn, leads to high friction, tape damage and premature wearing of the VCR heads. If the humidity is too low, static discharge may occur and it appears as a flash when the video is being played. The optimal playback environment is 21 ± 2ºC and 50 ± 10% RH.Footnote 19 Footnote 20\n\nPlayback equipment\n\nAny device that is used for playback should be clean, properly aligned and regularly maintained as indicated in the manufacturer’s instructions or as performed by a qualified service technician. This will result in the best playback signal and prevent damage to the recording. Machines with worn components can lead to greater friction during playback and cause distortion, wrinkling, creasing and stretching of the tape. A tape path that is out of alignment can lead to damages to the tape edges, making the playback problematic. A periodic inspection of the unit should be performed by a qualified individual, especially if the noted problems are encountered.\n\nA dirty tape path in the equipment will result in signal losses and physical damage to the tape, such as scratching. Cleaning of the path may involve the use of wet or dry cleaning cassettes, which can remove some debris on the machine parts. However, these cleaners are abrasive and may damage the video heads. Alternatively, manual cleaning may be performed with a lint-free swab and a suitable cleaning solvent. Whichever method is used, it is imperative to consult the manufacturer’s instructions to avoid damaging the components in the VCR. In addition, cleaning should only be performed by individuals that are experienced in or properly trained in VCR cleaning techniques. The frequency of cleaning is difficult to determine as it depends on the age and cleanliness of the tapes and the playback environment. Older recordings may shed more debris and, therefore, more frequent cleaning may be required than if only newer ones are played. However, it is important not to clean more often than necessary. Regular inspections of the playback unit and taking note of degradation in the video signal are two ways to determine when cleaning is required.\n\nIf playback is problematic and there are no obvious problems with the equipment, tape or cassette, it is worth attempting to play the tape in another VCR. Occasionally, there can be interchange or compatibility issues between the cassette and/or the videotape and the playback unit. This compatibility problem may also be due to the VHS recording being made with one television standard (NTSC, PAL or SECAM) and played back on a VCR that only plays a different standard (e.g. NTSC VHS recording being played back on a PAL VCR). If this occurs, the image may be distorted or there may be no image at all. Ensure that the player and recorded tape are compatible in terms of the television standards.\n\nPower conditioning\n\nHigh-end power conditioning (i.e. use of a device to deliver voltage of the proper level and characteristics to equipment in order for it to function without electrical issues) is not required, but plugging all of the devices into a standard computer UPS is a good idea. This will protect the equipment against power surges and against loss of data for short power interruptions. A 1000 VA or 1200 VA unit is more than adequate.\n\nPreparing the tape for playback\n\nVHS and S-VHS cassettes all contain write protect tabs on the cassette, as shown in Figure 8. It is good practice to break off the tab if it is still present in order to prevent the accidental erasing of the recording during use.\n\nFigure 8. Above: The write protect tab as indicated by the arrow is found on the top of all VHS cassettes. Below: The write protect tab should be broken off to prevent the accidental erasing of the recording.\n\nVHS cassettes in collections often have several adhesive labels attached to them. Ensure that there is no label that is loose or peeling and, if there is one, re-adhere or preferably remove it entirely. Ideally, labels on cassettes should be used as little as possible and situated only in the recessed portion on the front or spine of the shell, both areas designed specifically for label placement.\n\nThe tape pack should be inspected visually by looking through the cassette window. If there is any loose or slack tape present, then it needs to be taken up by releasing the hub lock (described above under Cassette condition) and gently turning one of the hubs in the direction that leads to the tape being taken up.\n\nIt is important that tapes are acclimatized to the playback environment and that playback occurs in the correct environment. Usually a couple of days should be sufficient for acclimatization. If tapes are being transferred from a cold or cooler environment, then precautions should be taken to avoid moisture condensation on the materials. These precautions involve keeping tapes in sealed containers or placing them in sealed plastic zip-lock bags until the containers have warmed to the playback environment. Alternatively, the materials can be slowly warmed in a staging area. Failure to acclimatize the tapes will result in poor playback performance and possible damage if moisture condensation has occurred on the tape surface.Footnote 21\n\nPlay procedures\n\nA tape and cassette in good condition should be loaded into the VCR and be fully engaged before beginning. It is best to minimize the number of times that a cassette is inserted and removed from the machine to avoid damaging the tape. Next, before playing, it is recommended to fast-forward to the end of the tape and, once at the end, stop the VCR. After a couple of seconds, rewind completely to the beginning. These actions benefit the playback by conditioning the tape to the wind tension of the VCR being used, restoring the tension in the tape pack after potentially several years of idle storage, and helping to acclimatize the tape to the use environment. Avoid fast-forwarding and rewinding repeatedly and do not leave the VCR in pause or still mode for long periods of time, as this can damage the tape. Always hit stop on the VCR when moving from one mode, such as fast-forward or rewind, to another to avoid stressing and possibly damaging the tape. The fast-forward and rewind processes should be smooth, otherwise this may be an indication of damage or degradation to the tape or cassette. Note that this fast-forward and rewind conditioning procedure should not be performed on fragile tapes or on tapes suspected of being in poor condition.\n\nAfter this preparation, the wound pack may still contain problems, such as individual strands of tape popping out from the main pack, commonly referred to as popped strands. If the problem is not severe, there should not be an issue. However, packs with many and significantly popped strands should not be played or, at the very least, be closely monitored during play and, if problems become evident, the poor wind needs to be remedied.Footnote 11\n\nThe prepared tape is then played in order to examine if the heads are properly tracking the video signals. Often, the video heads from the machine that plays back the tape will not have the same alignment to the recorded tracks as the heads from the VCR that recorded them. This difference in alignment, usually as small as a few micrometers, creates a tracking problem. Some VCRs perform automatic tracking adjustments to optimize the output. However, for others, the tracking may have to be manually adjusted by using the controls on the equipment or remote until the picture is optimum. Tracking that is not properly adjusted is indicated by the presence of horizontal noise lines across the screen. When the tracking is completely off, the heads are not following any part of the recorded signal tracks on the tape and the picture consists of “snow” (Figure 9). Properly adjusted tracking results in a video image with no lines. Once this adjustment has been made by playing the recording for a couple of minutes, the tape should be stopped, rewound, played to the point where the digitization is to begin and then stopped. The adjusted tracking is not likely to change unless another machine was used to make additional recordings on the same tape.\n\nThere are also a number of other problems that may be encountered when playing back VHS videotapes. Some of these problems are listed with some brief descriptions in Appendix A. It is important to remedy issues, where possible, prior to digitizing, otherwise the errors will be transmitted to the digital copy.\n\nViewing of the playback is performed via an attached television monitor or computer monitor with the appropriate viewing screen available through the capture software. This would depend on the type of digitization being performed.\n\nThe tape is now ready to be played and digitized. During play, listen to the sound of the transport mechanism in the machine. Any strange noises or indications that the play is not smooth, is slowing down or is straining are indications to stop the playback, as these are likely signs of a problematic tape or cassette. Visually, if the video image becomes progressively worse with play, then the machine should be stopped as well. The more familiar an individual is with the playback device being used, the easier it will be to identify abnormal sounds and performance. Careful monitoring during playback of the tape is recommended at all times.\n\nTest cassette\n\nA useful item to have on hand is a test cassette that is known to work well and contains good quality video. The purpose of this cassette is to determine whether a problem that is encountered during playback is due to the equipment, tape or cassette, or whether the problem was recorded onto the tape when it was first created. This allows for a more accurate treatment to be pursued for the problem encountered. For example, a tape is played and is displaying bands of noise lines consistent with a tracking issue. A manual adjustment of the tracking does not solve the problem. Therefore, the test cassette is played in the VCR to determine if the problem still exists. If it does, there is an issue with the equipment. If it does not, then either the effect was recorded on the tape when it was created or the tape and possibly cassette are damaged. This type of procedure can be followed for many of the video problems encountered during playback.\n\nAnalog to Digital Conversion\n\nIt is easy to fall into the trap of not doing anything because of the lack of the perfect solution for digitizing analog video. In fact, there is no “one solution fits all” and therefore institutions need to evaluate their own situations and move forward. It is imperative to do something now, at the best quality level available to the institution, before it is too late and tape degradation or playback machine obsolescence leads to the complete loss of the VHS recordings in a collection.\n\nThere are many options available for converting VHS recordings to a digital format, each with its own positive and negative aspects. Ultimately, the method chosen depends upon what is acceptable quality, what expertise and resources are available to perform the work, and what resources will be available for managing the newly created information in the future. This Technical Bulletin provides three options for digitizing VHS video that can be categorized as low (Digitization Set-up One), medium (Digitization Set-up Two) and high (Digitization Set‑up Three) quality. Always strive for the best quality option possible based on the parameters listed above as it is likely that the VHS tape will never be digitized again or perhaps even be playable again in the future.\n\nIdeally, for ease of management of the digital video in the future, it would be best to choose one standard format. However, it is possible to use different options depending on the value of the content being digitized. An organization may decide that its digitization of VHS goals can be met by using low to medium quality for most of the collection, but using high quality only for the most unique and valuable material. High quality digitization may also be the preferred route for deteriorated material as this may be the last time it would be playable and because it may require editing and corrections once digitized, a process that is more successful on a better quality digital file.\n\nIn terms of the three categories of digitization, there will not necessarily be much visual difference between them when the digital videos are compared. This is especially the case when dealing with VHS recordings as the source material, where the advantage of utilizing a higher quality digitization may be lost in the noise of the signal. In fact, some simpler or cost effective options can produce excellent visual results. However, differences may become evident with future migration or future manipulation of the files. This is where digitizing at the higher quality can be beneficial and, if possible, preferred over the other methods. The higher quality will provide greater flexibility in terms of file manipulation (e.g. a better end product after editing the content or after producing lower quality distribution files), and migration to other video file formats will result in no or minimal loss in details. Another point to keep in mind is that digitizing at a lower quality may appear to give a satisfactory result using today’s display monitors but, in the future, the result may prove to be unsatisfactory.\n\nWhichever digitization set-up is selected, it is important to conduct a variety of tests to become familiar with the equipment and software being used as well as the workflow being performed. Thorough experimentation and comparison tests are essential before commencing large scale projects in order to produce the best result possible and to limit mistakes that lead to projects having to be redone.\n\nThe conversion to digital process is in real time and, therefore, every hour of a recording will require one hour of digitization time plus one hour to view the converted video. In addition, time will also be required to preview the material prior to digitizing, which may necessitate cleaning and repairing, as well as other tasks. The amount of labour required is approximately three times the amount of video. For example, digitizing one hour of video will require about three hours of labour time. This is an important factor to consider when undertaking this type of project as labour costs can make it unaffordable unless costs can be reduced via the use of trained volunteers.\n\nDigitization Set-up One: conversion to DVD\n\nThe Digitization Set-up One workflow is shown in Figure 10. The simplicity of this set-up lies in the fact that the playback unit is also the digitizer and the end product is a movie DVD. Figure 11 shows an example of one of these units. One side is a regular VCR and the other is a recordable DVD drive. Internally, there is a device to convert the analog video to digital form. The options for units that contain internal analog to digital converters are limitedFootnote 22 (see Appendix C for suppliers) and the quality of the final result varies depending on how well the VCR portion plays the tape, the quality of digitization device within the unit, and the amount of signal correction that occurs.\n\nEquipment and connections\n\nDetailed instructions on how to use this machine are provided in the manual for the VCR/DVD‑R unit. Therefore, before beginning, it is best to become familiar with the unit by reading through the user manual and then performing some digitization tests. Most VCR/DVD-R units come with onscreen display menus or graphical user interfaces to guide the user through the process. The unit needs to be connected to a monitor in order to view this display. The monitor will also allow the recording to be examined during the conversion process to ensure that there are no problems. The connection between the unit and the monitor depends on the outputs available on the unit and what input options are available on the monitor that is being used. Most VCR/DVD-R units have three output options that are listed below in order of lowest to highest quality (the corresponding cables are illustrated in Figure 12):\n\nComposite – yellow connector for the video signal, red and white connectors for the left and right audio signals\n\nComponent – red, green and blue connectors for the video signal (these connections are not usually found on VCRs) and the audio is connected with the red and white composite cables\n\nS-video – 4-pin connector (Figure 13) for video, and the audio is connected with the red and white composite cables; the video signals of luma (brightness) and chroma (hue and saturation or colour) are carried separately through an S-video cable and this differs considerably from composite cables where the signals are blended together\n\nTo properly connect the equipment to the monitor, select one of the cable options above and connect from the Video Out and Audio Out of the VCR/DVD-R unit to the Video In and Audio In of the monitor.\n\nDigitization procedure\n\nFor this digitization set-up, since editing of the resulting product is not easily done, it is important to screen the tapes prior to digitization. During the screening process, duplicate content and material that is deemed invaluable may be discovered, eliminated and not digitized, leading to significant savings in terms of cost, time and human resources. Screening also involves determining the recording length or running time that is present on the cassette. Considering that a VHS cassette may contain up to six hours of material, it is imperative to know the length and other details before actually starting the digitization because only a limited amount of content can fit on a recordable DVD disc. Labels on cassettes or the storage containers may or may not contain an accurate description of this information. Proper organization of the content before digitizing will improve the efficiency and success of the digitization using this method.\n\nThe screening of the tapes should only be performed if they are in good condition and, if possible, on a machine other than the one used for digital conversion in order to preserve its life. If it is suspected that multiple plays may damage the tape, the digitization should be performed on the first playback (i.e. during screening). It will always be possible to redigitize if it turns out that the tape is not problematic.\n\nFor other digitization options, such as Digitization Set-ups Two and Three discussed further down, the digitized content can be more easily edited. For those options, it is likely a better approach to digitize all the content on the VHS cassette and then decide afterwards what needs to be kept. This will eliminate the time required to screen the tapes, subject the tapes to less wear and tear since they are not played twice, and preserve the life of the analog equipment.\n\nSome general details on how to digitize non-copy-protected VHS videotapes with this method are provided below. These procedures may differ from one unit to the next but do give some guidance on how to proceed. The details below pertain to the Panasonic DMR-ES36V unit.\n\nTo perform the digitization of the VHS, the VCR/DVD-R unit and the monitor are turned on. The prepared tape, as discussed above under Evaluation of Tape and Cassette Condition and Playing the Tape, is inserted in the VCR side of the machine and cued to the starting point. Next, a blank DVD-R is inserted in the DVD-R drive. From the onscreen menu, the Copy function is selected. Next, the Copy Direction has to be set and, in this case, the Source will be VHS and the Destination will be DVD. The next decision to be made is the Recording Mode and this refers to the calibre of the conversion to digital. There are three modes that can be selected: XP mode (also referred to as HQ mode) is the best option and allows one hour of VHS video to be recorded per DVD-R disc; SP mode is medium level and allows 2 hours of video content per DVD-R; LP mode is the lowest quality of digitization and allows for 4 hours of VHS content per DVD-R. In order to maximize the quality, the XP mode should be selected. The SP mode may be used in situations where it may not be feasible to separate a recording into two discs, but keep in mind that there will be quality loss. Once the Recording Mode has been selected, the copying process can begin by selecting Start Copying, which automatically starts the VHS playback and the conversion to digital.\n\nOnce the content has played through, the process is stopped. At this point, a title can be added and the content can be divided into chapters for easier navigation of the DVD. In order for the DVD-R to be playable on compatible DVD players, it needs to be Finalized. This process is selected from the menu options and, once initiated and completed, no other content can be added to the disc. Note that most VHS/DVD-R units can allow a recording to be stopped and for content from different tapes or different parts of the same tape to be added as long as the disc has not been Finalized. For most machines, this is the extent of the editing possible for this level of digitization and therefore there is very little flexibility on what can be done with the video.\n\nIt is a good idea to play the DVD through from beginning to end to ensure that the digitization process was successful and to spot any problems, such as signal losses or other glitches.\n\nStorage media\n\nAvoid the use of cheap generic DVD-Rs and other lower stability discs, such as the erasable DVDs (DVD-RW or DVD+RW) and recordable dual discs (DVD-R DL or DVD+R DL). In general, it is best to avoid the use of DVD+Rs as well because these discs tend to experience more compatibility issues with different drives. Also, if maximum longevity is desired, then gold metal layer DVD-Rs should be used.Footnote 23 Consult the user manual of the equipment because it may indicate the preferred brand of disc to use with the DVD recorder.\n\nAdvantages of Digitization Set-up One\n\nsimple and little expertise is required to learn how to use the system\n\nminimal knowledge of the equipment is required\n\na powerful computer to process the video is not required\n\nlow cost\n\nDisadvantages of Digitization Set-up One\n\nlossy compression is used to make the DVD and therefore information is irreversibly lost, video may be degraded if compression program is poor, and video is more susceptible to corruption if any data is damaged\n\nproper decoding of the video and audio information stored in the DVD video format may be problematic and future migration from the DVD without further degrading the video and audio may be an issue; software that extracts content from DVDs will often use another form of compression or format conversion and quality will be affected\n\nuse of recommended high quality setting or even standard setting may produce several DVD-Rs per VHS cassette and content from one recording may have to be spread over two or more discs; combining this content into one file in the future, if the content is extracted from the DVD, will be problematic\n\nsome units may use an internal TBC for signal adjustment, but there is no flexibility to do any adjustments other than tracking prior to creating the DVD; therefore, the video signal being fed into the digitization device may not be as good as possible\n\nediting options are very limited and labeling of the video segments is limited and not very user friendly\n\nflaws present in the original VHS video may be enhanced when digitized to DVD\n\nlimited selection of VCR/DVD-R units to choose from\n\nDigitization Set-up Two: conversion to a digital file with an external capture device\n\nThe Digitization Set-up Two workflow is provided in Figure 14. More flexibility is provided with this option when compared to Digitization Set-up One, especially with respect to the selection of the type of player, signal correction that can be employed, external capture device and, finally, the type of storage media that can be used. However, with flexibility comes more complexity and added cost.\n\nEquipment\n\nPlayer\n\nThe first part of this workflow is the playback unit. Everyday consumer VCRs will get the job done but will provide the poorest playback. Preferably, professional or prosumer (semi-professional) VCRs or S-VHS VCRs should be used, as these will provide a better playback. It is critically important to obtain the best and most problem-free signal off of the tape because the better the signal that is fed to the digitization device, the better the result. Therefore, the best player available or affordable should be used.\n\nSignal correction\n\nThe next element in the workflow is a TBC. It is used to correct variations in the synchronizing signals that would otherwise lead to distortions, such as skewing in the video image. The TBC is able to make this adjustment automatically without user intervention by delaying the video signal so that each scan line starts at the proper time. It can also rectify problems with white-black levels and colour. A TBC can be part of a VCR or S-VHS VCR but is generally only found in professional or prosumer units. The use of a TBC can actually cause artifacts to be created in the digitized recording. The two principal ones are over-enhancement (images appear as ghost images instead of sharp lines) and velocity errors (characterized by alternating dark and light horizontal bars).Footnote 24\n\nThere are other signal correction elements that can be used in addition to the TBC. Two examples are a waveform monitor and a vectorscope. A waveform monitor measures and displays the voltage levels of the video versus time in order to determine if the levels are too high (too white) or too low (too black), resulting in loss of details. A vectorscope does not measure brightness like a waveform monitor would but instead measures the colour data in the video signal, specifically saturation and hue. Both of these signal correctors can be hardware- or software-based, with the software versions that are now available being as accurate as the hardware ones. Often, both of these can be found in one piece of equipment or software package.\n\nWhether or not to use a TBC, waveform monitor and vectorscope for the creation of digital masters is open to debate and some believe that there should not be any signal processing of any kind. Indeed, adjustments not true to the original should not be made for the master but are often desired for distribution or access copies. Also, it is worthy to keep in mind that without thorough knowledge on how to use these tools, more harm may be done than good.\n\nAt the very least, a TBC should be used because not using one can lead to poor digitization and, usually, the benefits outweigh any shortfalls. Monitoring of the digitized video and performing some trials will help determine if the TBC has introduced any unwanted elements or not.\n\nMost TBCs have outputs for composite and S-video connections (Figure 15) and, therefore, the connection used depends on whether a regular VCR (composite connections) or a S-VHS machine (S-video connection for video and composite for audio) is used—see Equipment and connections above under Digitization Set-up One. There are a variety of different TBCs that are available, from low end to professional.\n\nTypical properties for a decent and reasonably priced TBC include:\n\ndigital processing at 8-bit video resolution and 4:2:2 sampling rate\n\nframe synchronization with full frame memory\n\nlow noise with S/N ratio >50 dB\n\nregeneration of all synchronization signals to stabilize the video\n\nFigure 15. Front (top image) and back (bottom image) view of the Datavideo TBC.\n\nDigitization device\n\nThere are a variety of different external digitization devices that can be used. These range in cost depending on the quality desired and the flexibility that is required. All of the devices in this class use compression and therefore are throwing out some information that is in the original video. As stated previously, although visually the video may be very good, compression can lead to problems indicated by artifacts and overall lower quality when the digital files are migrated into a new digital format at some point in the future. The conversion to digital for devices in this class basically allow for the following capture formats: DV, MPEG-2, MPEG-1 and MPEG-4. In this Technical Bulletin, the focus will be on DV and MPEG-2. The selection of the format will depend on how much editing is required after the conversion has taken place, on the institution’s capacity to deal with large files, and on current as well as future capabilities. More information on these two formats is provided below under Converting to DV using the Canopus ADVC110 from Grass Valley and Converting to MPEG-2 format using Pinnacle 710-USB.\n\nComputer\n\nThe most up-to-date as possible computer should be used for digitizing video. Older and slower computers do not handle the process well and can lead to the loss of content. In addition, older computers are likely to lack the required capacity to deal with the large files that are generated with video digitization.\n\nThe following basic minimum specifications are recommended:\n\nOperating system: Microsoft Windows 7\n\nProcessor: 2.4 GHz\n\nRandom-access memory (RAM): 4 GB\n\nHard disk drive capacity: 2 TB\n\nUSB 3.0 ports\n\nFirewire IEEE 1394 card or on-board connection\n\nInternal recording device for the storage media being used (e.g. DVD/Blu-ray recorder drive, LTO tape drive). Note that these devices may also be external or separate from the computer and connected via a USB connection.\n\nSome tips for a successful digitization process include:\n\nDefragment the hard disk drive, which consolidates fragmented files and ultimately results in a hard disk drive that is quicker and works more efficiently.\n\nClose programs not associated with the process, avoid copying files and disable a number of existing features on the computer such as screensaver, sleep mode and scheduled tasks. If open, these may impact computer performance and the digital conversion (e.g. dropping frames of video).\n\nAlthough the above specifications should meet the requirements of the digitization and signal correction units for this digitization set-up, it is recommended to consult the product literature of the devices to ensure that the computer is compatible with them.\n\nConnections\n\nThe following connections are summarized in the diagram shown in Figure 16.\n\nStandard TBCs have both the composite and S-VHS connections available. Therefore, for a standard VCR, connect the Video Out from the VCR to the Input of the TBC using the yellow composite cable. Connect the Audio Out from the VCR to the Input of the TBC using the red and white composite cables. For S-VHS, connect the Video Out from the S-VHS VCR to the Input of the TBC using an S-video cable and connect the Audio Out from the S-VHS VCR to the Input of the TBC using the red and white composite cables. Note that, instead of using the S‑video connection with the S-VHS machine, there is also the option to use the yellow composite cable for video. However, the S-video cable will provide a better picture.\n\nThe TBC is then connected to the digitization apparatus. For most units, if the Input to the TBC is connected with composite cables, the Output of the TBC is connected to the Input of the digitizer with yellow (video) and red and white (audio) composite cables; if the Input to the TBC is connected with an S-video cable, the Output is connected to the Input of the digitizer with an S‑video cable (for video) and red and white composite cables (for audio). If no TBC is used, then the VCR or S-VHS VCR is connected directly to the digitizing equipment.\n\nThe TBC does not process audio but merely passes it through. Therefore, the audio connections may bypass the TBC and connect directly to the digitization device. In fact, some TBCs may not have any audio connections at all.\n\nThe final connections are between the digitization device and the computer. Most will connect to the computer by attaching a USB cable from the Output of the digitizer to a USB port in the computer. If using a device that converts to the DV format, it is connected to the computer via a Firewire IEEE 1394 connection.\n\nDigitization procedure\n\nConnect the equipment as described above under Connections.\n\nTwo different pieces of digitizing equipment will be discussed in this Technical Bulletin in order to illustrate this set-up. Other units can be used and the procedures to use them should be similar. Examine the literature of the specific device being used in order to properly perform the digitization. Note that these types of devices and associated software change frequently and it may be difficult to find the exact products in the future. However, the details below will help to illustrate what is involved in the digitization procedure.\n\nConverting to DV format using the Canopus ADVC110 from Grass Valley\n\nThe DV format was first launched in 1996 and is a codec (coder-decoder or compressor decompressor) that is in use by many digital video cameras. It uses lossy compression in a 5:1 ratio and, therefore, information is being discarded when digitizing from the original analog video. Despite using compression, the overall quality is very good and the file size is still large, with one hour of DV requiring 13 GB of storage space. An advantage of selecting DV is that it is easily editable, a useful feature for those requiring manipulation of the video for publishing, distribution, etc.\n\nThe ADVC110 unit (Figure 17) has a switch on the front labeled Input Select that toggles between Digital In and Analog In. Since analog video is being captured, ensure that the Analog In setting is selected. In order to use the ADVC110, video capture software is required. There are many different types that are available, some at no cost and others that are more expensive. Many options can be found by performing an Internet search using the search terms “DV capture software” (see Video Editing/Capture Software in Appendix C for some examples). Higher cost software provides greater flexibility for editing the video after the capture process has occurred and is generally a better choice overall. Regardless of the software chosen, it is important to study the associated documentation and perform some tests in order to become comfortable with the software before beginning the digitization project. For basic capture, software that is free, such as Windows Movie Maker, can be used and the process for using it is described below. The instructions below relate specifically to Version 6.0.6002.18005 and are provided to illustrate the digitization process. Earlier or later versions of this software may not have the same functionality.\n\nFigure 17. Front (top) and back (bottom) view of the ADVC110 digitization equipment.\n\nWhen using Windows Movie Maker, the first step is to open the software. In the File tab, select the Import From Digital Video Camera option. A window will appear where the following fields need to be filled:\n\nName – provide a name for the video to be captured\n\nImport To – provide a location (folder) where the file will be stored\n\nFormat – select the Audio Video Interleave (single file) option\n\nAfter this data has been entered, hit the Next button and another window will appear and two options will be provided:\n\nImport the entire videotape to my computer\n\nOnly import parts of the videotape to my computer\n\nThe latter option provides more flexibility when capturing because it allows the user to decide what is being captured and produces individual files on the spot without the need for subsequent editing. The first option will capture the full tape into one file, which may not be desired when a variety of unrelated content has been recorded on one tape. Editing will be required after capture to divide up the video.\n\nNext, the prepared tape, as discussed above under Evaluation of Tape and Cassette Condition and Playing the Tape, is inserted in the VCR or S-VHS VCR. The recording is cued to the spot where the capture is to begin using the viewing screen associated with the Windows Movie Maker software and then the tape is paused. Click on the Start Video Import button and then press Play on the player. Note that some types of software may allow you to control the VCR from the computer. To stop the capture process, click on the Stop Video Import button and stop the VCR.\n\nNote that the connection from the digitization device to the computer will be via Firewire.\n\nConverting to DV format using the Pinnacle 710-USB\n\nThe Pinnacle Studio digitizer (Figure 18) comes with software to capture and edit digital video. One of the options available for capture is the production of DV movie files. The step-by-step instructions below relate specifically to the Pinnacle Studio HD Ultimate Collection Version 14.0.0.7255 software.\n\nTo begin the digitization, open the Pinnacle software. Select the Import tab and a new window will open. Under Import From, select the Pinnacle 710 and the appropriate connection, either Composite (yellow cable for video and red and white cables for audio) or S-video (S-video cable for video and red and white composite cables for audio). Next, under Mode, select DV; under Import To, indicate where the digital video will be stored; and, finally, under Filename, provide an appropriate name for the file. Note that the file extension will be .avi. Next, the VHS tape is prepared and adjusted for tracking, as outlined above under Evaluation of Tape and Cassette Condition and Playing the Tape, and cued to the point where the capture will begin using the viewing screen associated with the Pinnacle software and paused. Click on Start Capture and then press Play on the VCR. Once the segment of the video to be captured has ended, click on the Stop Capture button to end the process and stop the playback of the VHS recording.\n\nNote that the connection from the Pinnacle unit to the computer will be via USB.\n\nFigure 18. Front (top) and back (bottom) view of the Pinnacle 710-USB.\n\nConverting to MPEG-2 format using the Pinnacle 710-USB\n\nThe Pinnacle 710-USB also allows analog video to be digitized into MPEG-2. MPEG-2 is very flexible in terms of quality and is used in creating DVDs and for digital television signals. Like DV, MPEG-2 is a lossy compressed format, meaning that information from the original analog record is being discarded when digitized into this format.\n\nFollow the instructions as outlined above in the Converting to DV format using the Pinnacle 710-USB section with the following exception—under Mode, select MPEG instead of DV. In this case, the file extension of the digital video file will be .mpg. Next, click on the arrow next to Presets in order to bring up a small window. Within this window, select MPEG2 as the compression codec and then maximize the data rate using the slider. For the Pinnacle unit, the maximum data rate is 10 Mb/s. Other compression devices and software may have other maximum data rate settings up to a very high quality of 50 Mb/s and above. The highest data rate possible with the digitization equipment being used is the preferred selection because it will result in better video, but note that it will also take up more storage space than lower data rates.\n\nMonitoring and completing the digitization capture process\n\nIn all three conversion scenarios discussed above, the capture process can be monitored on the computer monitor using the viewing screen associated with the capture software. The audio can be monitored by using the audio speakers associated with the computer. At the end of the process, it is recommended that the digital file be viewed in its entirety to ensure that there are no problems with any portion of the final product.\n\nWindows Movie Maker is basic software, but it will allow video clips either from the same VHS tape or from others to be put together into one file. It will not allow editing, such as the removal of unwanted portions after the video file has been created. These portions must be removed by starting and stopping the digitization process, which will create individual files that can then be incorporated into one. Windows Movie Maker does not provide tools for correcting video-related problems (e.g. brightness, contrast). The Pinnacle software provides more flexibility and allows the files to be edited so that unwanted sections can be removed. It also provides a variety of tools such as colour correction, noise reduction and stabilization. Whether such tools should be used or not is a decision to be made by the institution. Some argue that the digitized master should be as close as possible to the original and any corrections or enhancements can be saved as a separate master file and identified as such.\n\nStorage media\n\nThere are a variety of options for the storage of the files that are generated by this digitization set-up. These options include DVD-Rs, BD-Rs, hard disk drives, RAID systems, LTO data tapes and flash media, such as SSDs or USB flash drives. CD-Rs cannot be used because their low capacity would only allow very short video segments to be stored. Another factor to consider other than capacity is how much media will be generated by storing these video files. An institution has to decide whether it can physically store and manage a large amount (e.g. a few thousand DVD-Rs or a few hundred BD-Rs) of media as opposed to only a few external HDDs. In addition, the cost is a significant variable in choosing media for storage. Appendix D summarizes the amount of media required and the associated cost for various digitization options. Appendix E summarizes the equipment costs. These appendices can help an institution determine what is manageable and feasible.\n\nA closer look at each of the storage options is presented below:\n\nOptical discs\n\nThe advantage of using optical discs for storage is that there is random access to files and therefore no need to fast-forward or rewind in order to locate files. Optical discs are portable and suffer no wear and tear with repeated use because there is no physical contact with the reading or writing device. The major disadvantages are the low transfer speed, meaning it will take a long time to copy or extract files from the discs, and the low storage density, resulting in many discs being required to store a digital video collection of any significant size.\n\nDVD-Rs\n\nA single layer DVD-R can hold 4.7 GB of data. This is the preferred recordable DVD to use instead of the DVD+R or dual layer discs, as indicated in the Digitization Set-up One section. Under ambient temperature and RH conditions, standard DVD-Rs have an approximate lifetime of 10–20 years, whereas gold metal DVD-Rs have a lifetime range of 50–100 years. By following some general guidelines,Footnote 25 recordings with low error rates can be produced, thus ensuring maximum longevity for the discs. Keep in mind that, although lifetime values may be high in some cases, technologies to read the discs may not be available in the future and therefore obsolescence of technologies should always be monitored. DVD-Rs are not a suitable option for storing DV video due to the high storage capacity requirement.\n\nBD-Rs\n\nBD-Rs are available in one layer (25 GB), two layer (50 GB), three layer (100 GB) and four layer (128 GB) versions. The most common disc is the one layer and offers about five times more storage capacity than a single layer DVD-R. There is generally little knowledge available with respect to the stability of Blu-ray discs. However, some recent testingFootnote 26 has indicated that, under accelerated aging conditions, the stability is slightly lower than standard DVD-Rs and significantly lower than the gold metal DVD-Rs. Gold metal BD-Rs are available but testing indicated similar stability to non-gold metal BD-Rs.\n\nThe use of BD-Rs is not as widespread as DVD-Rs. Also, this technology is still fairly new and evolving with changes in formulations occurring in order to achieve higher write speeds. It is likely that recording properly to these discs with low error rates may be difficult and, in some cases, the recorded discs may be of poor quality and questionable longevity.\n\nHard disk drives\n\nLike optical discs, hard disk drives provide random access to data but at faster speeds. The storage density is very high and therefore one hard disk drive can store a significant amount of data (up to 4 TB as of 2014), making it very cost-effective to store digitized video. The general problem with hard disk drives is that they are highly mechanical, and failure of the mechanical parts due to wear or shock results in short lifetimes. The approximate average lifetime of hard disk drives is five years, and sudden and early failures can occur. There is also uncertainty as to the actual lifetime rating of hard disk drives that are not used often and are stored on a shelf. If hard disk drives are chosen as the storage medium, the drives should be checked every year and replaced approximately every five years. Several different types of free software programs are available on the Internet that can monitor hard disk drives for performance and errors (see Appendix C).\n\nThere are a number of factors to consider when choosing a hard disk drive. All of the major manufacturers make reliable drives but all have had some that fail. If the drive will be running for many hours at a time, it is important to compensate for the heat produced because heat can damage the drive. A drive in a heavy-duty aluminum case that dissipates heat well is preferable to one in a plastic case that acts like an insulating blanket and keeps the heat in. If the drive is going to be moved frequently, consider an external laptop drive (2.5 inches). Laptop drives tend to be more resistant to damage from shock, since they are designed to be installed in devices that are carried around.\n\nA closer look at various hard disk drive options is presented below:\n\nInternal hard disk drives\n\nInternal hard disk drives reside in the computer case and therefore are tied to the computer and not portable.\n\nExternal hard disk drives\n\nExternal hard disk drives are similar to internal hard disk drives except they are more portable and connect to a computer via a USB connection.\n\nRAID systems\n\nRAID is the acronym for Redundant Array of Independent Disks. RAID systems are a series of hard disk drives linked together in order to provide one large compact storage system. They consequently provide more capacity than individual hard disk drives. A major benefit of using a RAID system is that it affords some protection for failure of the individual hard disk drives. RAIDs require software and controllers to make the system function and can be quite expensive depending on the type of RAID system that is implemented. RAID systems require ongoing management and, due to their complexity, more information technology skills are required compared to other storage options. While this technology can be significantly more expensive than the other choices, easier-to-use and inexpensive RAID arrays are becoming available.\n\nA RAID as referred to here is a stand-alone product that has multiple disk drives, a power supply and typically an Ethernet LAN connection. RAID can be built into computers, but the stand-alone array seems to be a better option as it is typically running dedicated storage software. As a stand‑alone product, it is generally referred to as an NAS unit and provides instant access to files. Other types of storage only provide off-line storage.\n\nThe two RAID configurations that could be considered are RAID-5 and RAID-6. In the case of RAID-5, the capacity of one disk drive of the set is reserved for redundancy and the array can tolerate the failure of one disk drive without the loss of any data. Once that disk is replaced, the system rebuilds the data on it and full protection is restored. RAID‑6 is similar but can tolerate the failure of two disk drives, with the penalty that the capacity of two disk drives is earmarked for redundancy. A RAID unit should be connected to a dedicated UPS via a data cable so that the unit can be shut down gracefully in the event of an electrical interruption. Another RAID type to consider is RAID-1, where the data is mirrored across two drives. In this case, if one drive fails, the other still exists with the data intact.\n\nLTO data tape\n\nLTO is an often-used technology for storing large amounts of data, making it a viable option for storing digital video. This is a very high capacity format and has some backward compatibility to previous versions. The existing LTO generations and their read and record compatibilities are provided in Table 4. A roadmap indicating the release of future versions is also available,Footnote 27 that allows institutions to plan on when they need to convert their older versions to newer ones. Because of the high capacity, LTOs are very cost effective for storing data. However, there are several drawbacks for using tape for storage. For example, there is slower access speed due to sequential storage of data. In addition, tape is in contact with machine parts when being used, resulting in wear and tear and possible damage. Another disadvantage is the requirement for a recorder drive, which adds much more cost when compared to some of the other storage options. Finally, changeover to a more current format is usually required every five to seven years because of the short tape life and short life of the various LTO generations (Table 4).\n\nTable 4. The compatibility of LTO generations\n\nLTO Generation\n\nYear of Introduction\n\nRead Ability\n\nRecord Ability\n\nLTO1\n\n2000\n\nLTO1\n\nLTO1\n\nLTO2\n\n2003\n\nLTO1\n\nLTO2\n\nLTO1\n\nLTO2\n\nLTO3\n\n2005\n\nLTO1\n\nLTO2\n\nLTO3\n\nLTO2\n\nLTO3\n\nLTO4\n\n2007\n\nLTO2\n\nLTO3\n\nLTO4\n\nLTO3\n\nLTO4\n\nLTO5\n\n2010\n\nLTO3\n\nLTO4\n\nLTO5\n\nLTO4\n\nLTO5\n\nLTO6\n\n2012\n\nLTO4\n\nLTO5\n\nLTO6\n\nLTO5\n\nLTO6\n\nFlash media\n\nStorage using flash media is gaining in popularity. Flash media, such as SSDs or USB stick flash drives, provide random fast access to data files. The media are very rugged and durable and do not contain mechanical moving parts that are prone to failure like those present in hard disk drives. The two main disadvantages of using flash media are:\n\nthe lower capacity relative to hard disk drives and LTO, although capacities are available that are much higher than optical discs\n\nthe cost per gigabyte, which is currently much higher than the other storage options\n\nAs time progresses, the capacity of flash media will continue to increase and the cost per gigabyte will continue to decrease and, at some point in the future, flash media will compare more favourably with other types of storage.\n\nThere is little data available as to the long-term stability of flash media. Some recent preliminary testingFootnote 28 has indicated very good stability under accelerated temperature and RH conditions, comparable to the highest stability gold metal optical discs. Note that, currently, it is uncertain as to how long this type of media can be stored on the shelf and be readable in the future.\n\nAdvantages of Digitization Set-up Two\n\nfairly simple system\n\nbetter quality can generally be obtained than DVD\n\nAVI files are easily editable\n\nonly basic expertise required to set up the system and perform the work\n\nflexibility in the selection of player used for the VHS playback\n\nsignal correction allows a better signal to be sent to the digitizing unit\n\nexternal (separate from the computer) capture devices have the advantage of not taxing computer functions with processing\n\nflexibility in the type of computer that can be used, depending on the requirements of the digitization device and software\n\ndigitized video can be stored on different media and in a few different types of file formats\n\nDisadvantages of Digitization Set-up Two\n\nmore equipment required than Digitization Set-up One and therefore higher startup cost\n\ndata compression is used and therefore\n\nsome information (part of the signal) is lost and this lost data can never be restored\n\nvideo is more susceptible to visible corruption in case of “bit rot” or damaged data\n\ndegradation of video will occur with poor compression\n\ndecompressing the data with a program other than the one that created or encoded it may yield visible artifacts\n\nlarge file sizes for some of the conversion options\n\ncapture devices that are low cost do not produce the best video possible\n\nflaws present in the original may be enhanced when encoding to MPEG-2 or, in other words, poor quality may be compounded\n\nediting may be problematic for MPEG-2 unless the interframe setting was selected for compression (note that interframe compression discards duplicate data within a single video frame and is a less efficient compression, resulting in larger files; intraframe compression discards duplicate information across several frames, resulting in smaller files and more efficient encoding, but making the video more difficult to edit)\n\nfairly powerful computer required to deal with the digitized video being fed to it from the capture device\n\nDigitization Set-up Three: conversion to a digital file with an internal video capture card\n\nThe Digitization Set-up Three workflow is provided in Figure 19. This set-up makes use of an internal (within the computer) video capture card and provides the most flexibility in terms of selecting the file format and the quality of digitization. Although the capture card and associated software are set up with default settings, there are a lot more decisions that need to be made in setting up the process. Therefore, this set-up may only be suitable for those with existing knowledge of video digitization.\n\nDespite the many options that are offered by capture cards, the focus will be on digitizing without compression, an option that has not been addressed in Digitization Set-up One or Two. The advantage of not using compression is that all the information from the original analog recording is maintained and future migrations are not likely to produce any artifacts or lead to losses. The drawback of using no compression is that large file sizes are created. This may pose a problem for some institutions in terms of data management. Nevertheless, producing uncompressed video may be the appropriate option in some cases, especially where the video is of high importance or value.\n\nThe use of a good capture card is a more expensive option than the other digitization equipment previously discussed.\n\nEquipment\n\nPlayer\n\nSee Player section under Digitization Set-up Two.\n\nSignal correction\n\nSee Signal Correction section under Digitization Set-up Two.\n\nDigitization device\n\nThere are a variety of different internal capture cards that can be used. The capture cards are usually specific to one of the television broadcasting standards—NTSC, PAL or SECAM—but some car"
