        "text": "Proper Use\n\nDrug information provided by: Merative, Micromedex®\n\nYour doctor will tell you how much of this medicine to use and how often. Your dose may need to be changed several times in order to find out what works best for you. Do not use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor tells you to. If too much of this medicine is taken for a long time, it may become habit-forming (causing mental or physical dependence).\n\nThe fentanyl skin patch is only used for opioid-tolerant patients. A patient is opioid-tolerant if oral opioids have already been used for severe pain. Check with your doctor if you have questions about this.\n\nIt is very important that you understand the rules of the Opioid Analgesic REMS program to prevent addiction, abuse, and misuse of fentanyl. This medicine should also come with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Read it again each time you refill your prescription in case there is new information. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\n\nYou will receive the Ionsys® patch while you are in a hospital. A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine after surgery. You will be taught how to use this medicine in the hospital, but the patch will be removed by your healthcare provider before you leave the hospital. Do not leave the hospital with the patch on your skin.\n\nTo use the Duragesic® patch:\n\nUse this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor. It will work only if it has been applied correctly.\n\nThis medicine should only be used on skin that is not irritated or injured. Do not put the patch in your mouth, chew it, or swallow it.\n\nFentanyl skin patches are packaged in sealed pouches. Do not remove the patch from the sealed pouch until you are ready to apply it.\n\nWhen handling the skin patch, be careful not to touch the adhesive (sticky) surface with your hand. The adhesive part of the system contains some fentanyl, which can be absorbed into your body too fast through the skin of your hand. If any of the medicine does get on your hand, rinse the area right away with large amounts of clear water. Do not use soap or other cleansers.\n\nBe careful not to tear the patch or make any holes in it. Damage to a patch may allow fentanyl to pass into your skin too quickly. This can cause an overdose.\n\nApply the patch to a dry, flat skin area on your upper arm, chest, or back. Choose a place where the skin is not very oily and is free of scars, cuts, burns, or irritation. Do not apply this medicine to areas that have received radiation treatment.\n\nThe patch will stay in place better if it is applied to an area with little or no hair. If you need to apply the patch to a hairy area, you may first clip the hair with scissors, but do not shave it off.\n\nIf you need to clean the area before applying the medicine, use only plain water. Do not use soaps, other cleansers, lotions, or anything that contains oils or alcohol. Be sure that the skin is completely dry before applying the medicine.\n\nRemove the liner covering the sticky side of the skin patch. Then press the patch firmly in place, using the palm of your hand, for a minimum of 30 seconds. Make sure that the entire adhesive surface is attached to your skin, especially around the edges.\n\nIf the patch becomes loose, tape the edges with first aid tape.\n\nIf the patch falls off after applying it, throw it away and apply a new patch in a different area.\n\nIf you need to apply more than 1 patch at a time, place the patches far enough apart so that the edges do not touch or overlap each other.\n\nWash your hands with a lot of clear water after applying the medicine. Do not use soap or other cleansers.\n\nRemove the patch after 3 days (72 hours), or as directed by your doctor. Choose a different place on your skin to apply the next patch. If possible, use a place on the other side of your body. Wait at least 3 days before using the first area again.\n\nTo use the Fentanyl extended-release patch:\n\nUse this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor. It will work only if it has been applied correctly.\n\nDo not remove the patch from the pouch until you are ready to use. Do not use the patch if the pouch seal is broken or the patch is cut, damaged, or changed in any way.\n\nThis medicine is available in 7 different strengths and patch sizes. Make sure you have the right strength patch that has been prescribed for you.\n\nApply the patch on the chest, back, sides of the waist, or upper arm in a place where there is no hair. For children, apply the patch on the upper back.\n\nDo not put the patch on skin that is oily, burned, broken out, cut, irritated, or damaged. Avoid sensitive areas or those that move around a lot. If there is hair, you may clip the hair, but do not shave it off.\n\nClean the skin area with clear water only. Do not use soaps, lotions, oils, or alcohol. Be sure that the skin is completely dry before applying the medicine.\n\nRemove the liner covering the sticky side of the skin patch. Then press the patch firmly in place, using the palm of your hand and hold for at least 30 seconds. Make sure it sticks well to the skin, especially around the edges.\n\nIf the patch becomes loose, tape the edges with first aid tape. You may instead cover the patch with a transparent adhesive film dressing. Do not cover the patch with any other kind of bandage or tape.\n\nIf the patch falls off after applying, throw it away and apply a new patch in a different area.\n\nRemove the patch after 3 days or as directed by your doctor. Choose a different place on your skin to apply the next patch.\n\nIn young children or persons with decreased mental alertness, the Duragesic® patch should be put on the upper back to decrease the chance that the patch will be removed and placed in the mouth.\n\nAfter a Duragesic® patch is applied, fentanyl passes into the skin a little at a time. A certain amount of the medicine must build up in the skin before it is absorbed into the body. Up to a full day (24 hours) may pass before the first dose begins to work. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose during the first few weeks before finding the amount that works best for you. Even if you feel that the medicine is not working, do not increase the amount of fentanyl skin patch that you apply. Instead, check first with your doctor.\n\nYou will probably need to take a faster-acting opioid by mouth to relieve pain during the first few days of using fentanyl skin patch. You may also need another opioid while your dose of fentanyl is being adjusted, and to relieve any \"breakthrough\" pain that occurs later on. Be sure you do not take more of the other opioid, and do not take it more often than directed. Taking 2 opioids together can increase the chance of serious side effects.\n\nDo not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you are using this medicine.\n\nDosing\n\nThe dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\nThe amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.\n\nFor transdermal dosage form (Duragesic® skin patch):\n\nFor relief of chronic pain:\n\nAdults and children 2 years of age and older—Your doctor will decide which dose of the patch you need based on your present daily opioid dose. The patch is applied to the skin and left in place for 3 days (72 hours). Your doctor may adjust your dose as needed.\n\nChildren younger than 2 years of age—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\nFor transdermal dosage form (Fentanyl extended-release patch):\n\nFor severe and persistent pain that requires an extended treatment period:\n\nAdults and children 2 years of age and older—Your dose will be based on your present daily opioid dose. Your doctor may adjust the dose if needed. The patch is applied to the skin and left in place for 72 hours.\n\nChildren younger than 2 years of age—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.\n\nFor transdermal dosage form (Ionsys® skin patch):\n\nFor short-term relief of acute pain after surgery:\n\nAdults—Your doctor will decide which dose of the patch you need based on your present daily opioid dose. The patch is applied by your healthcare provider to your upper outer arm or chest. Your doctor will show you how to adjust your dose as needed while in the hospital.\n\nMissed Dose\n\nIf you forget to wear or change a patch, put one on as soon as you can. If it is almost time to put on your next patch, wait until then to apply a new patch and skip the one you missed. Do not apply extra patches to make up for a missed dose.\n\nRemove the Duragesic® patch 3 days (72 hours) after applying it.\n\nYour healthcare provider will remove the Ionsys® patch before you leave the hospital. The Ionsys® patch is not for use at home.\n\nStorage\n\nStore the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.\n\nKeep out of the reach of children.\n\nDo not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.\n\nAsk your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.\n\nFentanyl can cause serious unwanted effects or a fatal overdose if taken by children, pets, or adults who are not used to strong opioid pain medicines. Make sure you store the medicine in a safe and secure place to prevent others from getting it.\n\nUse the patch-disposal unit that was provided with your prescription to dispose of the patches. Read and follow the printed instructions on the disposal unit and use one unit for each patch. Peel off the liner of the disposal unit to reveal the sticky surface. Place the sticky side of the used patch on the disposal unit and seal the entire package. If the patch has not been used, take it out of the pouch and remove the liner that covers the sticky side before placing it on the disposal unit. Throw the sealed disposal unit in a trash can. Talk to your pharmacist if you have questions about how to use the disposal unit. Do not flush the pouch or the protective liner down the toilet. Put them in a trash can.\n\nYour healthcare provider will dispose of the Ionsys® patch after removing it.\n\nDrop off any unused opioid medicine at a drug take-back location right away. If you do not have a drug take-back location near you, flush any unused opioid medicine down the toilet. Check your local drug store and clinics for take-back locations. You can also check the DEA web site for locations.
