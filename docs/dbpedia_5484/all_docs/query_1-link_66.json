        "text": "Scratching on celluloid film is also referred to “direct animation” which is made by etching designs directly onto the film print. These drawings can be made on black liter film or found footage films. What is required to make these films are using permanent markers, paints, and even ink! But here are the essentials you will need to make some cool moving scratch images!\n\nThe Essentials :\n\nLight table\n\n16mm Rewind\n\n16mm black liter\n\n16mm splicer and splicing tape\n\n16mm film projector with a take up reel\n\n16mm film core\n\nDental tool or other type of scratching tool\n\nHole puncher\n\nWet paper towel or cloth\n\nQ tips\n\nClothing line to dry film\n\nSTEP 1 : If you are making an found footage film it’s optional but try to watch the footage all the way through if an audio soundtrack applies on the film if not feel free to sift through the film on the 16mm rewind. From there you can figure out which scenes you want to pull from the film. If you are using black or clear liter none of this applies to you.\n\nSTEP 2 : Once you’ve found the scenes of your liking or have your black/clear film liter ready cut the strips to about three feet (1 meter long), and tape the strips to the light table keeping it nice and secure while scratching.\n\nSTEP 3 : Take the scratch tool and start scratching a design or pattern on the emulsion side of the film strip.\n\nKey Points\n\nLike stop-motion animation slightly alter each frame with subtle scratch marks evolving in each frame keep in mind 24 frames adds up to 1 second of run time.\n\nMake sure your mark fits in the frame so try to scratch very tiny but if you want to fill an entire frame with a solid color block it out with etching out the entire frame and filling it in with marker or paint.\n\nFeel free to even use bleach on footage making the film appear clear and wiping out the image slightly.\n\nmake sure to layer your ink or marker because one layer is not enough and your color will look lighter appearing more like a crayon scribble instead of an solid color.\n\nFinal Steps\n\nMake sure to hang up your film to air dry after applying multiple layers of ink and marker on it. Make sure the strips not touching one another you wouldn’t want to blend colors from other parts of the film\n\nSplice together the completed pieces of film in the order of your liking make sure when you splice the film together that when it is to be projected that your image isn’t flipped upside down and not playing backwards. And if a sprocket hole is broken chop it then make a splice. Also keep in mind when splicing that the tape doesn’t clog the sprocket holes.\n\nOnce everything is ready and set go wind the film up on an take up reel and project it on an 16mm projector.\n\nHave fun scratching!"
