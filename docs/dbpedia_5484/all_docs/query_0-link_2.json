        "text": "Hi @PedroRocha\n\nTo quote documentation:\n\n“Every library has a default scratch pool, which is automatically created when the library is configured. When the system creates a storage policy for the library (e.g., when the library or one of its drive pools is configured), the primary storage policy copy is associated with the default scratch pool. In addition, when you import new media into the library, this is the scratch pool to which they are assigned (unless you specify otherwise). You can create any number of additional scratch pools, and assign these to different storage policy copies that access the library. You can also designate a user-defined scratch pool as the default for the library. See Change the Scratch Pool Associated With a Storage Policy Copy for step-by-step instructions.”\n\nhttps://documentation.commvault.com/2022e/expert/10189_scratch_pools_configuration.html#b10198_change_scratch_pool_associated_with_storage_policy_copy\n\nHope this helps\n\nHi @PedroRocha\n\nTo quote documentation:\n\n“Every library has a default scratch pool, which is automatically created when the library is configured.

My question is if it is possible to specify them during a server plan creation/configuration in Command Center. If it is not possible, I believe I'll have to go to the Commcell Console and change it on the storage policy copy itself.\n\nRegards,\n\nPedro\n\nI do not see any option on Plan level:\n\nYou can however create storage pools with the scratch pool pre-defined and assign these storage pools to the Plans, eliminating the need for changing every storage policy copy:\n\nIf this is not the route you want to take, then you need to alter the policy copy"
