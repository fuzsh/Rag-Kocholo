        "text": "Default media vaults\n\nA media vault is a logical representation of the actual physical location of specified tape media. You can create media vaults to keep track of where media is physically stored, such as a scratch bin, or an off-site location. Backup Exec creates default media vaults to let you view all media that are online, offline, or in a media vault.\n\nYou must run the Configure Storage wizard to update the location of tape media in media vaults. From the Configure Storage wizard, you can print reports that detail which tape media are ready to move to and return from the vault. You can also update the location of the media if you choose to move them. However, you must physically collect the tape media, and move the media to and from the vault. The location of the tape media is updated in the Backup Exec Database, but the media is not ejected or exported. If Backup Exec detects that the media is in a robotic library, you are prompted to export media. If you choose to export the media, an export media job runs. If your environment includes remote sites, you should create separate media sets for each remote site. Then, the reports contain details on which media are ready to be moved for a specific site."
