        "text": "This probably isn't something you guys already don't know but thought it was an interesting article:\n\nhttp://www.computerworld.com/articl...-warns-of-short-life-span-for-burned-cds.html\n\nBeing 45 years old, In the 80s I was just as much into cassette tapes as anybody else was. Although being a cheapskate, I never bought any descent name brand cassettes. I always bought those 3 for dollar tapes at K-Mart. The ones with the red, green and white rainbow labels. Anyone remember those?\n\nI'd record allot of my own music off the radio. As I laid in bed waiting to fall asleep, if I heard a song I liked, I'd record it. So imagine using a cheap tape to begin with. HISS, SCREACH!!!\n\nAround 1990 I got a CD Walkman for Christmas. I remember the first CD I purchased was Fleetwood Mac's Greatest Hits. Ironically I read on Wikipedia it was the last mass produced album on 8 track.\n\nYet through the 90s, I still bought pre-recorded cassettes (I think because they were much cheaper than CDs) from music stores and recorded my own music onto Cassette tapes. After all CD burners were still not available to the general public and CD decks for cars were still not cheap.\n\nI only bought used CDs because I swear they were twice as much as cassette tapes at the time.\n\nThen along came Napster and MP3 technology. Now I was able to \"burn\" my own MP3s onto a Cassette tape using Winamp. Just load up a bunch of songs that total slightly less than 30 minutes, hit record on my ghetto blaster and then the return button on my computer.\n\nThis was about a close as I ever got to recording onto a cassette tape that actually sounded great. Without the usual sound degradation of recording off FM or dubbing off another tape.\n\nIt wasn't until around 1999 when CD burners and CDR blanks was available to the public. So I was one of the first people to jump on the bandwagon.\n\nSo I bought a name brand CD player for my Fiat Spider. I think it was made by Sony. What a POS. Every time I would hit just a slight bump, the CD would skip. But if I hit a pothole, it wouldn't! I pulled that thing out and stuck the old cassette player back in.\n\nIt wasn't until car decks capable of playing MP3s on CDs with anti-skip buffering came out a few years later that I had any success. Maybe around 2002 or 2003.\n\nHowever for some odd reason, this one particular CD player (Jenson I think) would scratch the hell out of my CDs and render them unplayable. Maybe the fact it was the car was a convertible and dust was getting into the player. Yet I kept my CDs in their jewel cases when not played.\n\nSo I used to argue you could play a cassette tape 100 times before it crapped out but a CD could only be played about 20 times because it became so scratched up it was unplayable.\n\nYears ago some guy at work (who would say stuff that was never believable) tried to tell me that these CDRs would fail after 10 years and the labels contained acid that would cause earlier degradation.\n\nSo today I dug out an old Pink Floyd CD I made around 2002 I had not played in years.\n\nI compressed four CDs (Dark Side of the moon, Animals, The Wall and Wish you were here) into 128 bit rate MP3s and burned them onto one CD.\n\nI've not burned a CD in about 10 years since FM/MP3 transmitters that use flash memory came out. Convenient, quick and dirty but still not as mellow as 8 tracks or vinyl.\n\nFor awhile this CD was in a duffle bag in my car. Although not exposed to sunlight it did see some hot summers. The following years this duffle bag has been in my basement.\n\nSo far I've been listening to it here at work and have not noticed any sound degradation.\n\nOne thing is for sure. One day while trying to make it through the turnstile at work with my duffle bag, I had a can of Pepsi explode in my duffle bag and it ate the aluminum coating off several CDs I had in my bag!\n\nSo what the moral of this story? Well nothing really. Just debating my experience with different forms of media.\n\nI'm still not sure if I'm sold on CDs and flash memory as being the standard media.\n\nI still have this fondness for cassette tapes. I guess because it reminds me of growing up in the 80s.\n\nGiven the date of the article, 2006 but obviously based on much older data, the article is as Wilhelm said, a hoax.\n\nSomeone that has no insight in the technology dares to comment something he does not know. Typical.\n\nFirst of all. If correctly burned, a CDR would go well beyond the 20 years and still has reserve for tiny errors (nothing is permanent). A conscious user (like govt agencies or tax ones ) would recopy the data (BECAUSE IT'S THE DATA THAT COUNTS not the MEDIUM) just before it becomes unreadable and reset the counter.\n\nSince 2006, probably the pinnacle of 54x burning, the things worsened a bit. Good manufacturing factories closed, and therefore the market was flooded with low quality CDRs. It wasn't a surprise to anyone, except maybe the stupid consumer that believes in fairy tales, that sometimes a CDR is unreadable next second after it is output from the burner.\n\nThese gather the bulk of those claiming analogue holds better. They were able to wait 1:1 when analogue was to be copied, but they don't have the time to wait 8:1, 10:1, 12:1 or even 16:1, they need to go directly to 54:1. And they criticize the double speed copying, too . Time is money - indeed - they just wasted the price of a CDR but saved 2 minutes. That is the difference between 54x and an honest 10x. Two minutes.\n\nTu summarize - at enterprise level, there are some huge libraries that are stored on optical discs. They are placed in huge changers so that the information carried onto them can be rather quickly accessed. These discs are not burned at 16x, 20x, 24x (for DVDRs), but at a very slow speed, like 2x, 4x. The discs are archival grade, also available to consumers, if they want to. Probably all enterprises also keep a backup on tape. It's one of the golden rules - keep the information duplicated onto two different media (eg if a magnetic field would destroy the tapes, it won't affect the DVD/CDs).\n\nAnd also the tapes are changed, without verification, after a number of passes (say 200) and/or a certain duration (say every second year). The enterprises do not believe in the fairy tales of the tape manufacturers, with minimum service duration of 10 years and so.\n\nAnd HDDs are changed EVERY 5 years in all enterprises where data integrity is paramount.\n\nTurning to consumers, here's chaos. They burn the CDRs and DVDRs like the \"Russians are coming\" and each second counts. Indeed, each second counts, but in the other direction.\n\nI am one of the few that still uses optical media in my car. All friends, relatives etc. use USB-sticks with MP3s. The same burner, the same CDR, the same software (not essential) - I cannot go beyond 10x without risking the CDR not to be recognized by the carstereo. I burn them at 4x. It happen to me to have a few burners that can burn a CDR at any speed from 1x to 54x WITHOUT any readability issue (and with similar PI/PE) - but most people have the cheapest burner and use it at the maximum speed onto the cheapest CDRs they find. They also treat the CDs like dirt, so the CD/CDR will be scratched faster than its natural decay.\n\nOn the other hand, the analogue lovers try to find the most expensive and the best recorders, never use a higher speed (and for LPs some even look for a HSM - half speed mastering), look for the best cassette, and treat these like St John's the Baptist relics.\n\nThe comparison is unfair.\n\nCDR is a solid storage solution. It is \"bidimensional\" so it provides non-sequential access in split seconds. Its information can be freely (if not DRMed) copied and WITHOUT ANY LOSS to another medium at the first sign of troubles. That shifts the burden of quality on the very first phase - digitization. If the digitization is well done, the music will live forever.\n\nAnalogue tapes are more resilient in that the information is so less dense that it can be recovered, not in full but sufficient to be recognizable, in case of accidents. Yet, its duplication requires high quality tools, an investment that also affects the subsequent phases.\n\nThis topic has been on and on discussed, to death.\n\nAny idiot can break a car, for instance keeping the engine above 8000rpm (if the electronics let him do this) then claim the cars are defective.\n\nThis happens in the CDR \"business\". They go beyond the common sense and then blame the others.\n\nI have a collection of less than half of a 25pcs spindle containing ALL MY COASTERS in 20 years of burning. And I started not when a CDR was 1$ a piece, but 30 (converted from DM).\n\nI burn at 4x not because at higher speed I get coasters, but because the number of errors is smaller. Even at higher speeds I have the errors well below the standard limits. To give an example, the standard requires a certain number of parity inner errors (PI), id est 180. Although there are units that read also a higher amount of errors, like 600 or 800, I am unhappy if I go beyond 60. This is because the DVDRs degrade in time, and if I have one already having 180 or let alone 500 (which is the case with all \"Speedy Gonzales\" around there), there is a greater chance that next year the DVDR cannot be read no matter what I do. Whereas, from 35-45 (my average) to 180 is a long, long way of course, if properly stored and used.\n\nAnd the problem is not the wasted money. Those 1-2$ apiece (I use only good discs) are not important today, but the content, which is invaluable, is lost. If the groom could stand still 1 hour in the church, isn't he able to wait 20 minutes to burn this unique (unless he remarries ) event in the best conditions? Has to do it in 2 minutes?\n\nI kind of sit between both camps on this one.\n\nOn the one hand, I don't think I have a single magnetic tape that as deteriorated or been damaged to an extent that I cannot play it. Whereas I have burned a few coasters and had a few digital discs \"die\".\n\nThat said, I have CDRs going back to 1997 that play fine. I've backed them up just in case. I have burned literally thousands of DVD-R discs and I think maybe 40-50 coasters....and most of those coasters were due to a drive that turned out to be defective. Two further discs that burned well and played fine later went bad, though they are just about playable - the picture jumps around and I lose perhaps a minute of a 53 minute documentary. However my PC will not copy them to back them up, as it balks at the missing chunks.\n\nWith BD-R discs I have burned fewer, perhaps 50. And two have later gone bad, such that no player or drive recognises them. Maybe that's down to being an early adopter of recordable BD technology back in 2009? It could be that early discs are less reliable?\n\nThe problem with digital media is that when some data in the middle is lost, many playback devices will simply spit the disc out rather than skipping over the missing data. Also one generally has no warning. With analogue tape, stored correctly I am not convinced the stuff deteriorates anyway....but given that often storage is not optimal one can still begin to see/hear problems and take steps to preserve the material.\n\nThe big archive issue is hard drives. I've had many of those die on me. So I keep multiple backups of my hard drives.\n\nI did a piontless experiment where I recorded a DVD and a CD and hung them out on my washing line for 1 year in all weathers both failed to play when I tested them a year later.\n\nHow about storing your tapes near any generator of magnetic fields, like speakers, motors, CRT TVs and monitors, etc.???\n\nHumidity should not affect the CD/DVD unless the seal is broken. And the seal on modern CDR/DVDR is very fragile.\n\nOn the other hand, UV radiation from sun is known to damage the dye. CDRs and DVDRs and BDRs are supposed to be kept in dark, vertical.\n\nI kind of sit between both camps on this one.\n\nOn the one hand, I don't think I have a single magnetic tape that as deteriorated or been damaged to an extent that I cannot play it. Whereas I have burned a few coasters and had a few digital discs \"die\".\n\nThat said, I have CDRs going back to 1997 that play fine. I've backed them up just in case.

Also one generally has no warning. With analogue tape, stored correctly I am not convinced the stuff deteriorates anyway....but given that often storage is not optimal one can still begin to see/hear problems and take steps to preserve the material.\n\nThe whole point here is that analogue is \"recognizable\" even if the information is missing. Digital, on the other hand, needs to be fully integral in order to be assessed.\n\nHave a look at a table of numbers, whereupon someone spilled some coffee, wine, ink. The table looses almost any value. A graph based on the same figures as the table, although not very accurate, can be recognized and interpreted by our brain much better.\n\nAnd a secondary issue, that is today however very important. The digital data density is very very high compared even to the smallest analogue media. A HDD smaller than a videocassette (VHS) can hold a few cubic meters of VHS at a better quality. An USB stick, even as CD-format as opposed to HiRes, can replace a whole wall of LPs.\n\nThat means that a similar damage is perceived as a splitsecond dropout on a magnetic tape but may incur the loss of a few files (songs, movies) from a HDD, DAT, DVD, USBstick etc.\n\nYet another important thing. In order to support the deluge of digital bits, the modern data are compressed. Some times lossless (BD, DVD-A, FLAC), mostly lossy (BD, DVD etc.). If no strong recovery algorithms are implemented, the damage done is amplified by the compression algorithm.\n\nI remember that once I had to recover the HDD using a (I believe) DDS cassette. Unfortunately, that cassette had a problem somewhere, and the backup software we used backthen had the nasty bug that it could not pass over the error - so everything beyond that point was lost. I used a day before DDS backup to recover the info, then replace the day-before info with the salvaged one, up to the error. Considering that the HDD was smaller than the DDS could hold, it was a PITA.\n\nThis was one of the decisive factors.\n\nYet another one, that concurred with the first one, was that the burning of CDRs was pretty reliable, and the files were instantly recovered, on an individual basis. The only 2 coasters I have from that period were due to Windows95, the modem connection (serial, high CPU load) and the lack of BurnProof technology - one time the screen saver started and provoked a congestion of data buses, the other time the internet buffer was suddenly emptied, again causing bus congestion and the loss of continuous data flow to the burner.\n\nThese two issues led me to my conclusion. And the passed time could only give right.\n\nIf I would have had coasters after coasters, I would certainly not embraced the digital technology, I would have remained to cassettes and stuff.\n\nBut digital was proven to be sufficiently reliable and of a better quality, so the analogue use faded almost to zero.\n\nIn addition, since I embraced digital media, I have not lost a single song. Yes, I have lost one or two USB sticks (lost, forgotten, stolen don't know), I scratch every month a CDR or two in my car, but I recreate the missing bits from the safety archive.\n\nIn the analogue days, each stolen cassette (and it happened quite often, during parties) meant actually an irreparable loss.\n\nI am not going to disagree with anyone and low speed burning is great. But we must also keep an eye on the media device that plays the Media. Take a DAT machine. If your player stops and you can not get it fixed and there are no parts what are you going to do? This is why I like to stick to open reel and then cassettes. I have tons of CD and DVD media too but they are more likely to fail due to the complexity factor. Plus like I said they can stop making CD players or burners any time. Streaming and Mp3 as well as solid state drives do not insure anything for me. I have too many thumb drives go south in a second when not even abused.\n\nIf your Jensen unit scratched discs then why did you not deal with it? My father had a DVD unit that was hardly used that I set up that scratched discs. I took it apart and found a spring attached to the magnet of the pickup. I suspect it came out of a VHS tape. How did it get into the unit- I will never know. Since it has been removed it never scratched a disc and plays them like the unit should.\n\nWhen I was working in refurbishing, I worked on repair of many Sony new arrival CD players for cars. Cars are not the correct environment for the type of construction they have on those PCB- there is too much vibration and temperature extremes. I fixed about 96% of the units I had to work on. Most of the problems were pretty simple. You should not draw conclusions based of an experience of low grade or cheap products.\n\nYou are grown up now and can know better than to buy K mart tapes.\n\nCassette decks can do a wonderful job if they are maintained properly. I think the vast number of cassette deck is a reason people are still using them. If there were few they would only be in the hands of specialist. Get a good basic unit and cassette will be better for you than ever before- it is possible that you never heard what they should really sound like.\n\nMost people do not handle CDRs correctly and this contributes to failures but as with any questionable media, you make backups and thus have to spend more time making them. Nero image makes this pretty easy."
