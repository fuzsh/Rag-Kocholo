In this topic, you can find basic documentation on how to configure the Commvault backup application for a Tape Gateway, perform a backup archive, and retrieve your data from archived tapes. For detailed information about how to use Commvault, see the Commvault Quick Start Guide on the Commvault website.\n\nConfiguring Commvault to Work with VTL Devices\n\nAfter you connect the VTL devices to the Windows client, you configure Commvault to recognize them. For information about how to connect VTL devices to the Windows client, see Connecting Your VTL Devices to a Windows client.\n\nThe Commvault backup application doesn't automatically recognize VTL devices. You must manually add devices to expose them to the Commvault backup application and then discover the devices.\n\nCreating a Storage Policy and a Subclient\n\nEvery backup and restore job is associated with a storage policy and a subclient policy.\n\nA storage policy maps the original location of the data to your media.\n\nYou create a subclient policy and associate it with your storage policy. A subclient policy allows you to configure similar file system clients from a central template, so that you don't have to set up many similar file systems manually.\n\nBacking Up Data to a Tape in Commvault\n\nYou create a backup job and write data to a virtual tape by using the same procedures you use with physical tapes. For more information, see the Commvault documentation.\n\nArchiving a Tape in Commvault\n\nYou start the archiving process by ejecting the tape. When you archive a tape, Tape Gateway moves the tape from the tape library to offline storage. Before you eject and archive a tape, you might want to first check the content on the tape.\n\nThe archiving process can take some time to complete. The initial status of the tape appears as IN TRANSIT TO VTS. When archiving starts, the status changes to ARCHIVING. When archiving is completed, the tape is no longer listed in the VTL.\n\nIn the Commvault software, verify that the tape is no longer in the storage slot.\n\nIn the navigation pane of the Storage Gateway console, choose Tapes. Verify that your archived tape's status is ARCHIVED.\n\nRestoring Data from a Tape\n\nYou can restore data from a tape that has never been archived and retrieved, or from a tape that has been archived and retrieved. For tapes that have never been archived and retrieved (nonretrieved tapes), you have two options to restore the data:"
