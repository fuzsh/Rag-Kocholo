        "text": "I am typically shooting then off loading footage on site to portable drives and a laptop. Often I will be editing on site, but just as often taking the footage back to a suite and transferring footage to a RAID for additional or not time sensitive projects. So, I’m constantly moving projects from different drives and computers. When I do this, I always get the “Scratch disks are write protected or unavailable. To open the project, the scratch disk will be sent to your Documents folder”.\n\nAnd so, I quickly go to the Project Setting>Scratch Disks tab and Preference>Media tab to try quickly to move thing to a new folder on the new drive. Also, it seems that Premiere is always recreating Peak files (and god knows where they are ending up).\n\nIn FCP there was a constant folder (Final Cut Pro Documents) that you could point to that would contain the Capture Scratch and other render files. Is there a protocol, or best practice that will allow me to do something similar w/ Premiere CS6 ?\n\nThanks,"
