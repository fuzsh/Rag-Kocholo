For example flight simulators use joysticks in order for trainee pilots to control the simulated plane.\n\nAdvantages of Joysticks\n\nEasier to control an on-screen cursor or move an in-game character\n\nVery simple to get used to and can be used by disabled people\n\nThe joystick allows fast interactions required in most games\n\nDisadvantages of Joysticks\n\nDifficult to use a joystick to select objects accurately on the screen.\n\nPeople with hand/wrist issues (like RSI) can find them painful to use.\n\nDifficult (but not impossible) to enter text.\n\nTouch Screens:\n\nTouch screens enable users to input commands into a computer by pressing or touching buttons/icons on the screen.\n\nTouch screens are more suitable for use with a limited amount of options.\n\nUses of Touch Screens:\n\nMobile phones and PDA’s use touch screens as a way of saving space (a separate keyboard would make the devices quite large).\n\nPublic information systems at airports or tourist information offices.\n\nInteractive whiteboards in schools.\n\nOn-screen multiple choice tests (like driving theory tests) sometimes use touch screens.\n\nAdvantages of Touch Screens:\n\nWith a touch screen, no extra peripheral is needed except the monitor.\n\nThe touch screen allows easy access to commands which are identified by words or symbols on the screen.\n\nDisadvantages of Touch Screens:\n\nLimited number of options available on the screen\n\nExpensive compared to other input devices.\n\nTouch screens are not suitable for inputting a large amount of data due to many arm movements involved\n\nScanners:\n\nScanners are used to enter information on paper (hard copies) into a\n\ncomputer.\n\nScanners can convert hard copies (printed documents, photographs) into\n\ndigital data.\n\nUses of Scanners\n\nUsed to scan hard copy / printed documents into a computer.\n\nOld photos and important documents (like birth certificates) can be scanned into the computer. This means you still have a copy if the original is damaged or lost.\n\nAdvantages of Scanners:\n\nVery fast to enter hard copies into the computer\n\nDigital copies of the stored data can easily be duplicated and backed up.\n\nDisadvantages of Scanners:\n\nScanned images are usually of lesser quality than the original document.\n\nScanned images can take up a lot of disk space (especially if you scan them at a high resolution).\n\nGraphics Tablet and stylus:\n\nA graphics tablet can be drawn on with a special pen called a ‘stylus’.\n\nWhatever is drawn onto the tablet can be seen on a computer screen.\n\nUses of Graphics Tablets:\n\nAllow designers to produce digital images much more accurately than if they were using a mouse.\n\nAdvantages of Graphic Tablets:\n\nThe stylus can be pointed to different positions on the tablet quickly.\n\nVery accurate drawings can be produced.\n\nUseful where drawings and symbols are used instead of text.\n\nDisadvantages of Graphic Tablets:\n\nVery expensive when compared to a mouse.\n\nNot useful for some input needs like entering data into the computer by clicking icons or menus.\n\nThe stylus and graphics tablet normally have to work together and cannot work separately.\n\nLight Pens:\n\nLight pens are used by directly drawing or selecting icons on a computer\n\nscreen.\n\nLight pens work by picking up light from the computer screen and then\n\nsignaling to the computer exactly where the light was picked up.\n\nUses of Light Pens:\n\nUsed for selecting objects on a computer screen.\n\nUsed for directly drawing onto a computer screen.\n\nAdvantages of Light Pens:\n\nMore direct and precise than using a mouse.\n\nConvenient for applications with limited desktop space.\n\nDisadvantages of Light

with friends and family on the internet.\n\nUsed to hold video-conferencing meetings over the Internet.\n\nCan capture image and video content for presentations and web sites\n\nSome people use web cams as a cheap alternative to security cameras.\n\nAdvantages of Web Cameras:\n\nAllow for long-distance face-to-face conversations.\n\nVideo conference business meetings and job interviews can be conducted very cheaply over long distances.\n\nWeb cams can be left running constantly which makes them useful as security devices on properties.\n\nDisadvantages of Web Cameras:\n\nThe image/video quality can sometimes be poor (low resolution).\n\nWebcams do not have their own storage and so must be permanently fixed to the computing device.\n\nAre usually in a fixed position and so cannot be easily moved around.\n\nMagnetic Stripe Reader:\n\nReads information from magnetic stripes found on Bank Cards, Membership Cards and Hotel Door Cards\n\nUses of a Magnetic Stripe Reader:\n\nATM’s use these readers to process the information on bank cards.\n\nEFTPOS (Electronic Funds Transfer Point of Sale) use the readers to transfer\n\ncustomer’s money from their bank accounts when they purchase goods in stores.\n\nHotel rooms sometimes use magnetic stripe readers in place of door keys.\n\nAdvantages of using a Magnetic Stripe Reader:\n\nEntering data is very fast.\n\nNo possibility of data entry errors as there is no typing involved.\n\nThe stripes on cards are not affected by water and so are not easily damaged.\n\nData held on the card cannot be read by eye so card details are safe.\n\nDisadvantages of using a Magnetic Stripe Reader:\n\nThe magnetic stripe on cards can only hold a small amount of data.\n\nCan be damaged easily by exposure to a strong magnetic field.\n\nMagnetic stripes on cards are easily duplicated\n\nBarcode Reader:\n\nUsed to read information on zebra stripped marks found on many\n\nretail products.\n\nUses of Barcode Readers:\n\nUsed

dirt).\n\nOnly numbers can be coded\n\nBar codes cannot be read directly by people\n\nOptical Mark Recognition (OMR):\n\nThis is a system which automatically reads marks made in pen or pencil.\n\nUses of OMR\n\nUsed to read the shaded areas on documents such as: Multiple choice examinations, multiple choice questionnaires, Lottery tickets\n\nAdvantages of OMR\n\nExtremely fast way of inputting information into a computer.\n\nVery accurate as document’s data is fed into the computer without manual typing.\n\nCan save money as there is no need to employ workers to enter form information into a computer.\n\nLarge volumes of data can be collected quickly and easily without the need for specially trained staff\n\nDisadvantages of OMR\n\nDocuments for OMR are difficult to design\n\nThe OMR reader needs to be reprogrammed for each new document design\n\nOMR readers are relatively slow\n\nThe person putting marks on the documents must follow the instructions precisely\n\nAny folding or dirt on a form may prevent the form from being read correctly\n\nOptical Character recognition (OCR):\n\nOCR devices read special pre-printed characters and convert them in a form which can be understood by the computer.\n\nUses of OCR’s:\n\nUsed in the processing of Passports and Identity Cards.\n\nOCR is also used in the process of digitizing books.\n\nAdvantages of OCR’s:\n\nWritten data and printed data can be read at the same time\n\nHard copies of documents can be read directly into a computer without retyping\n\nThe characters converted can be later edited by word processing software\n\nVery fast way of entering hard-copy text into a computer.\n\nCheaper than paying an employee to manually re-type printed text into a computer.\n\nAvoids typing errors as the process is automatic (no typing involved)\n\nDisadvantages of OCR’s:\n\nOCR readers often do not work well with handwritten characters or those in unusual fonts.\n\nNot 100% accurate. (relies on being able to read the original text)\n\nAs it is not 100% accurate, information needs to be manually checked for errors. This is time consuming.\n\nMagnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR):\n\nMICR is a system used to read information printed in special ink on documents like bank Cheques\n\nUses of MICR:\n\nMICR devices are mainly used to process Cheques.\n\nSome countries also use MICR devices to read the passport number on passports.\n\nAdvantages of MICR:\n\nCheques can be processed very quickly (up to 300 per minute).\n\nGreater security because the special ink characters cannot be changed or forged.\n\nNo manual input therefore less errors\n\nInformation can still be read even if someone writes over the magnetic ink characters.\n\nReading is accurate.\n\nDisadvantages of MICR:\n\nMICR readers and encoders are expensive.\n\nThe system can only accept a few different character sets.\n\nVoice recognition systems:\n\nProvide the computer with the capability to distinguish spoken words.\n\nNote that voice recognition implies only that the computer can take dictation, not that it understands what is being said.\n\nAdvantages of voice recognition\n\nNo typing of data is necessary\n\nThe system can be used by telephone or by people whose hands are occupied\n\nor disabled.\n\nAre ideal for blind or visually impaired users.\n\nDisadvantages of voice recognition\n\nError rate is still high at the moment\n\nRecognition of words is slow\n\nWords sound the same-see, sea cannot be distinguished\n\nNot suitable for use in noisy places\n\nSoftware must be trained to recognize specialist or technical words\n\nMany people find it difficult to speak in a ‘writing style’\n\nMIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) device:\n\nMIDI devices is used to create, record and play back musical compositions.\n\nMIDI is a standard that allows musical instruments to connect to the system unit.\n\nSensor and remote sensor: A sensor and remote sensor is an input device that can detect external changes in an environment.\n\nUses of sensors\n\nMonitoring and control

to record purchases.\n\nAn electronic funds transfer point of sale (EFTPOS) terminal transfers funds from a customer bank account to a retailer’s account.\n\nAn automated teller machine (ATM is a self-service banking machine attached to a computer.\n\nPointing stick:\n\nA pointing stick is located in the middle of the keyboard and to control\n\nthe pointer, you direct the stick with your finger.\n\nMost pointing sticks are pressuresensitive, so the pointer moves faster when more pressure is applied.\n\nProcessing devices\n\nProcessing devices serve the function of interpreting and manipulating instructions and data into information in a computer.\n\nThe main processing hardware include:\n\nCentral processing unit (CPU)\n\nMain memory\n\nCentral processing unit (CPU) microprocessor/micro chip\n\nThe CPU is the brain of a computer responsible for performing all the processing within the computer.\n\nFunctions of the CPU\n\nProcessing data\n\nFetching and sending of commands and instructions\n\nPerforms arithmetic and logic operations\n\nTemporary Storage/holding of data, instructions and results during processing\n\nThe more powerful the CPU, the faster the computer and the bigger the memory required.\n\nThe speed of the computer operations is determined by the system clock.\n\nThe faster the clock, the more instructions the CPU executes per second.\n\nThe clock speed is stated in Megahertz and Gigahertz.\n\nEach tick is a clock cycle and this is a hertz.\n\nClock speed/clock rate is the speed at which a processor undertakes instructions.\n\nIn terms of computing power, the CPU is the most important element of a computer system.\n\nThere are the two major CPU designs\n\nRISC-reduced instruction set computer: RISC is a design of the CPU that recognizes a relatively limited number of instructions.\n\nCISC-Complex instruction set computer: CISC is a design of CPU that supports a large number of instructions but at relatively low processing speeds.\n\nThere are two primary manufacturers of computer processors with Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) leading the market in terms of speed and quality.\n\nPentium processors\n\nThe current family of Intel Pentium microprocessors includes Pentium II, Pentium III, and Pentium 4, Xeon, multimedia extensions (MMX), Celeron, Itanium series and core 2.\n\nThe core 2 class is the current standard for processor chips.\n\nAMD processors\n\nThe best performing AMD processors are the Athlon, Athlon Xp, Thunderbird and Duron series.\n\nThese AMD processors are currently the most used microprocessors in high-end desktop systems, workstations and servers.\n\nThe main components of the central processing unit are:\n\nControl unit\n\nArithmetic logic unit (ALU)\n\nRegisters\n\nControl unit\n\nThe control unit directs all the operations that take place within the computer.\n\nUses of the control unit\n\nControls the entire operations of the computer system\n\nManages commands exchanged between the arithmetic logic unit and input/output devices and the memory.\n\nFetches, decodes and executes instructions\n\nOperations of the machine cycle\n\nFetching: Is the process of obtaining a program instruction or data item from the memory\n\nDecoding: Is the process of translating/change the instructions into\n\ncommands a computer can execute/handle/work upon\n\nExecuting: Is the process of carrying out commands\n\nStoring: Is the process of writing the results to the memory.\n\nArithmetic and logic unit (ALU)\n\nALU performs arithmetic operations and logical operations and controls the speed of those operations.\n\nArithmetic operations include:\n\nAddition\n\nDivision\n\nSubtraction\n\nMultiplication\n\nLogical operations are comparisons that the ALU compares two pieces of data to see whether one is:\n\nEqual to\n\nGreater than\n\nLess than\n\nGreater than or equal to\n\nLess than or equal to\n\nAND\n\nOR\n\nNOT\n\nRegisters\n\nRegisters are high speed temporary storage locations used to hold data and\n\ninstructions during processing.\n\nUses of registers\n\nTemporarily hold data and instructions needed by the CPU\n\nHelps the CPU to access data and instructions quickly\n\nCommon types of registers\n\nProgram counter: Holds the address of the next instruction to be fetched from the memory.\n\nStatus register: Holds a collection of condition flags which describe the status of the most recent operation carried out by the CPU.\n\nInstruction register: Holds the current instruction fetched from the memory.\n\nInstruction decoder: Interprets the instruction currently held in the instruction register.\n\nAccumulator: Holds the data item to be processed and the results of arithmetic and logic operations.\n\nThe main memory\n\nAlso called primary storage, internal memory or main memory is the part of processing hardware that is used to temporarily store data and instructions about to be processed by the computer.\n\nData in the memory is represented as electronic voltage in space called memory addresses.\n\nThe role of the computer memory in storing both data and instructions is called the stored program concept.\n\nComputer memory is the temporary storage space for data, programs, commands and instructions.\n\nThe three basic items stored in the memory include:\n\nOperating system and system software\n\nApplication programs\n\nData being processed\n\nMain memory:\n\nHolds data for processing\n\nHolds instructions for processing the data\n\nHolds data after it is processed\n\nTypes of computer memory\n\nComputers use two basic types of internal memory:\n\nRead only memory (ROM): ROM has contents that can be read but cannot be written to during normal computer operations.\n\nRandom access memory (RAM): RAM is used to store programs being used by the user when the computer is working.\n\nDifferences between RAM and ROM\n\nRAM ROM\n\nVolatile Non volatile\n\nRead and write Read only\n\nTemporal Permanent\n\nCan be increased Normally not increasable\n\nRead only memory (ROM)\n\nROM is used to permanently store instructions that tell the computer how to boot (startup).\n\nThese instructions are known as the BIOS (Basic input/output system)\n\nInformation stored in ROM is known as READ ONLY. This means that the contents of ROM cannot be altered or added to by the user.\n\nROM is Non-Volatile memory. This means that stored information is not lost when the computer loses power.\n\nContents of the read only memory are collectively called firm ware that is set during manufacture and cannot be altered.\n\nFirm ware contains permanently written data, instructions or information.\n\nROM is the smallest in size and contains programs that are built in during manufacture.\n\nTypes of ROM\n\nPROM-programmable read only memory:\n\nProgrammable read-only memory is memory on which data can be written only once. Once a program has been written onto a PROM, it remains there forever.\n\nEPROM- erasable programmable read only memory:\n\nErasable programmable readonly memory can be written to only once and erased once for new contents to be stored and cannot be erased any more.\n\nEEPROM-electronically erasable programmable read only memory:\n\nInstructions can be put in this memory as many times as one may like. The memory contains instructions up to when one decides to alter them.\n\nUses of ROM\n\nROM stores data and programs that must be kept permanent at all time\n\nROM stores system files that enable a computer to operate\n\nROM stores BIOS that enables a computer to start\n\nRandom access memory (RAM)\n\nRAM is used to temporarily store information that is currently in use by the computer.\n\nRAM can be read from and written to and so the information stored in RAM can change all the time (it depends what tasks you are using the computer for).\n\nRAM is a fast memory. Data can be written to and read from RAM very quickly.\n\nRAM is Volatile Memory. This means that information stored in RAM is deleted as soon as the computer is turned off.\n\nRAM forms a major portion of main storage and is in constant use for temporary storage.\n\nThe greater your machine’s memory capacity the better because:\n\nThe computer can create and use much larger programs\n\nThe computer can hold copies of more than one program\n\nThe computer can operate faster and more efficiently\n\nThe computer will be able to use new software/programs\n\nUses of RAM\n\nProvides storage of a copy of the system software program.\n\nProvides temporary storage of a copy of an application program\n\nProvides temporary storage of a copy of data items input from the key board and mouse.\n\nChips used for RAM\n\nDRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)\n\nSRAM (Static Random Access Memory).\n\nFRAM-Ferro-electric random access memory\n\nOther kinds of memory used:\n\nCMOS (Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor):\n\nCMOS stores configuration information about the computer such as:\n\nType of disk drives\n\nAmount of memory\n\nCurrent date and time\n\nKey board\n\nMonitor\n\nCMOS chips use battery power to retain information even when the computer is turned off.

computer.\n\nDisplay devices can be monochrome or colour. Monochrome means that information displays in one colour on a different colour background for example white on black.\n\nColours are used to make screen displays more attractive and to highlight\n\nmessages and menu options however screens with a lot of colours take longer time to process and more memory is required to display a lot of colours.\n\nResolution is the clarity and sharpness of imaged formed on the monitor.\n\nImages are formed on the monitor by a series of dots or pixels (picture elements).\n\nDot pitch is the distance between each pixel.\n\nRefresh rate indicates how often a displayed image is updated and redrawn on the monitor.\n\nFor a monitor to display information, it must be connected to a video card or graphics adapter.\n\nNear letter quality (NLQ) is a quality of print that is not quite letter quality but is better than draft quality.\n\nDrops per inch (DPI) the number of individual dots that can be placed in a line\n\nExamples of colour monitors\n\nColour graphics adapter (CGA)\n\nEnhanced graphics adapter (EGC)\n\nVideo graphics adapter (VGA)\n\nSuper video graphics adapter (SVGA)\n\nTypes of monitors\n\nCathode ray tube (CRT) monitors:\n\nCRT monitors are the most common type of monitors used in office and homes.\n\nCRT’s are becoming rare as TFT monitors are replacing them.\n\nUses of CRT Monitors\n\nCRT Monitors allow users to instantly see outputs from the computer.\n\nCRT’s are also used with light pens to allow drawings to be created on screen.\n\nAdvantages of CRT monitors\n\nCan produce fast and rich colour output\n\nCan be viewed from a very wide angle\n\nAre low cost monitors than LCD monitors\n\nDisadvantages of CRT monitors\n\nEmit higher radiations than LCD monitors\n\nConsume more energy than LCD monitors\n\nCRT monitors are bulky\n\nCRT monitors occupy a considerable amount of space on the desktop.\n\nFlat-Screen Monitor (TFT or LCD)\n\nThese are thin flat screened monitors that are commonly seen today. TFT’s are used with the newer desktop PC’s, laptops and mobile phones.\n\nUses of TFT Monitors\n\nTFT Monitors allow users to instantly see outputs from the computer.\n\nTFT Monitors are used as screens in laptops and also mobile phones.\n\nAdvantages of TFT/LCD monitors\n\nFlat screen monitors are portable.\n\nFlat screen monitors are very thin and do not take up as much desk space as a CRT monitor.\n\nFlat screen monitors produce much less glare than CRT’s and so are friendly to the eye.\n\nFlat screen monitors use less power than CRT monitors (cheaper to run).\n\nFlat screen monitors emit less radiation than CRT monitors.\n\nFlat screen monitors produce less heat than CRT’s.\n\nFlat screens are easy to mount onto the wall\n\nDisadvantages of TFT/LCD monitors\n\nMore expensive than CRT monitors\n\nCan only be viewed from a very narrow angle.\n\nExamples of flat panel monitors\n\nGas plasma\n\nElectroluminescent\n\nLiquid crystal display\n\nTFT and LCD are two of the technologies used in flat-screen monitors:\n\nTFT is Thin-Film-Transistor\n\nLCD is Liquid-Crystal Display.\n\nAdvantages of display devices such as monitors over printers\n\nAre generally quiet\n\nNeed no paper\n\nOutput can be modified or changed easily\n\nThe time taken to display the images is fast\n\nDisadvantages\n\nNeed separate devices to produce the hard copy\n\nUnsuitable for users with visual problems\n\nInformation produced on the screen is only temporary and will be lost when the power of the display device is turned off.\n\nPrinters:\n\nPrinters are output devices that produce text and graphics on a physical medium like paper.\n\nPrinters are categorized by how images are formed that is whether\n\nor not the image is formed by physical contact of the print mechanism with paper.\n\nAdvantages of printers\n\nInformation produced is permanent\n\nDisadvantages of printers\n\nThe time to get the printout is slow\n\nPaper is wasted for obtaining the output\n\nPrinters are

cartridge\n\nPurpose for which the printer is going to be put to use\n\nPrinter drivers\n\nThere are two major categories/types:\n\nImpact printers\n\nNon-impact printers\n\nImpact printers:\n\nImpact printers are a class of printers that work by banging a head or\n\nneedle against an ink ribbon to make a mark on the paper.\n\nImpact printers use pins or hammers which hit a ribbon to transfer images to paper.\n\nExamples of impact printers\n\nDot matrix printers\n\nDaisy wheel printers\n\nBraille printers\n\nDot matrix printers:\n\nDot matrix printers use a pattern of dots formed by pins on a print head to form out a character on paper.\n\nAdvantages of dot matrix printers\n\nDot matrix printers are inexpensive\n\nDot matrix printers reliable\n\nDot matrix printers are faster than daisy’ wheel printers\n\nDot matrix printers can print on continuous paper or multipart documents\n\nDot matrix printers have low per page cost\n\nDisadvantages of dot matrix printers\n\nDot matrix printers do not offer high quality output\n\nDot matrix printers are generally noisy because of the striking mechanism\n\nDot matrix printers are relatively slow\n\nDot matrix printers are not easily serviced because they are based on old technology\n\nDot matrix printers are not readily available on market.\n\nDaisy wheel printer:\n\nThe daisy wheel is a disk made of plastic or metal on which characters stand out along the outer edge.\n\nTo print a character, the printer rotates the disk until the desired letter is facing the paper.\n\nA hammer strikes the disk forcing the character to hit an ink ribbon leaving an impression of the character on the paper.\n\nYou can change the disk wheel to print different fonts.\n\nDaisy wheel printers cannot print graphics, are generally noisy and are slow.\n\nBraille printers:\n\nBraille printers produce characters that can be read by visually impaired people.\n\nNon-impact printers:\n\nNon-impact printers are printers that use chemicals, lasers or heat to form the images on the paper.\n\nExamples of non-impact printers\n\nDeskJet printers\n\nLaser printers\n\nThermal printers\n\nBubble jet printers\n\nInkjet printers:\n\nInkjet printers form characters on paper by spraying tiny droplets of ink on paper to form out a character.\n\nAdvantages of Inkjet printers\n\nInkjet printers are reliable\n\nInkjet printers quiet\n\nInkjet printers have very good quality output\n\nInkjet printers relatively inexpensive\n\nDisadvantages of Inkjet printers\n\nInkjet printers need special paper for highest resolution output\n\nInkjet printers have
