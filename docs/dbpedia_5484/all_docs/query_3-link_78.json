        "text": "What is Ram Board® used for?\n\nRam Board is a heavy duty, temporary surface protector, made to last. Ram Board can be used on a variety of floor types such as concrete, hardwoods, tile, stone linoleum, VCT, epoxy and most other floor types. This heavy duty surface protector is easy to install and lays out fast. Ram Board is designed with Vapor-Cure® technology, allowing floors to continue the curing process.\n\nHow to install Ram Board?\n\nTo install, kick out your roll of Ram Board (make sure the logo side is facing upward to prevent ink transfer). To ensure your Ram Board lays flat, roll the board up onto yourself to crush the fibers horizontally. Next, place your foot in the center of the board, pull up and crush the fibers vertically.\n\nOnce the board is laying flat, cut to your desired length with the Multi-Cutter™. This tool protects your floors from accidental nicks and cuts that might happen with a box cutter or utility knife. Overlap the seams, and join together using Ram Board Seam Tape®. Lastly, secure the perimeter with an Edge Tape (14- and 90-day options are available.)\n\nWhat is Ram Board Tape?\n\nTo protect a large area, you’ll need to overlap the Ram Board seams. Not only does this help avoid tripping over the edges, it also helps keep debris and spills from getting under the surface protection. To keep the surface protector in place, overlap the joining boards roughly an inch, and seam together using Ram Board Seam Tape.\n\nRam Board Seam Tape is designed with a unique kraft backing making it easy to tear. Seam tape is extremely durable and conforms with the paperboard for a long-lasting bond. It should never be applied directly to floors.\n\nWhat tape should you use for Ram Board?\n\nTo hold pieces of Ram Board together, Ram Board Seam Tape provides the best hold and is easy to remove. For taping to a floor, Ram Board 14-Day and 90-Day Edge Tape provide a good hold and can be removed within their respective timeframes without any tape residue transfer.\n\nHow to install Ram Board on stairs?\n\nRam Board Stair Armor® provides heavy-duty stair protection. Reduce the hassle of bending or cutting heavy-duty surface protectors to fit the shape of stairs. Stair Armor is the industry’s first paperboard protector designed solely for stairs. Made with Ram Board, the Stair Armor sheets can be adjusted to any size tread and feature bullnose protection and Spill Guard® technology.\n\nIs Ram Board Recyclable?\n\nRam Board is made from recycled materials and is FSC Certified. Ram Board can be recycled after use, depending on what substances come into contact with the surface protector.\n\nWhere can I buy Ram Board?\n\nRam Board products can be found at a wide range of distributors, retailers and home improvement stores. Want to find the location closest to you or looking for something specific? Contact us.\n\nHow to cut Ram Board?\n\nRam Board’s Multi-Cutter™ provides an easy to use, safe solution to cut Ram Board. The Dual Edge Guard System™ design allows you to cut directly on your finished surface, without risk of harming the floor beneath.\n\nIs Ram Board water proof?\n\nRam Board a leak resistant surface protector. Designed with a unique Spill Guard technology, the floor protector prevents water and spills from seeping through.\n\nDoes Ram Board tape leave residue?\n\nNo, Ram Board Edge Tape does not leave behind any sticky residue or debris, if removed within the specified time frame. Seam tapes should only be applied to Ram Board and never be applied directly to a surface.\n\nHow do you cut Ram Board?\n\nThe best way to cut Ram Board is with the Multi-Cutter, which you pull horizontally along Ram Board to get a precise cut without damaging the surface underneath. If you don’t have the Multi-Cutter, you can place a piece of cardboard underneath Ram Board and then cut using a box cutter or utility knife. To use the Multi-Cutter, simply place the cutting blade on the edge of the surface protection material you need to cut, and pull backwards.\n\nHow much does a roll of Ram Board weigh?\n\nOne roll of Ram Board weighs roughly 48 lbs per roll.\n\nCan you use Ram Board on carpet?\n\nYes, Ram Board works great on carpet by providing protection agains dust, debris, and anything else that may damage or stain carpet. Make sure to install logo side up to prevent any ink transfer.\n\nHow do you tape Ram Board to hardwood floors?"
