        "text": "CHAPTER 4\n\nSecurity Management\n\nChapter 4 in a Nutshell:\n\nIntroduction to Security Management\n\nCommonly Asked Questions\n\nNurturing Support within the Organization\n\nPlanning for the Unexpected\n\nTesting and Review\n\nImplementation and Day-to-Day Maintenance\n\nSecurity Management Checklist\n\nEffective security strikes a balance between protection and convenience.\n\nIntroduction to Security Management\n\nBecause system security is the aggregate of individual component security, \"system boundaries\" must encompass individual users and their workstations. But because personal computers are just that (personal), staff behavior can't always be dictated without potentially hampering workers' overall productivity. Recall that security policy becomes ineffective if it's so restrictive that legitimate user access is threatened. Thus, a key to successful security implementation is finding a reasonable balance between system protection and user autonomy and convenience. The person responsible for finding that balance and actively promoting organizational security is the security manager. Security management consists of nurturing a security-conscious organizational culture, developing tangible procedures to support security, and managing the myriad of pieces that make up the system. The security manager ensures that administration and staff are aware of their security roles, support security efforts, and are willing to tolerate the minor inconveniences that are inevitably a part of system change and improvement. After all, if personnel circumvent security procedures (e.g., write down passwords, share accounts, and disable virus-checking software), they put the entire system at risk.\n\nEffective system security depends on creating a workplace environment and organizational structure where management understands and fully supports security efforts, and users are encouraged to exercise caution. The security manager leads this effort.\n\nCommonly Asked Questions\n\nQ. Can an organization make do without hiring a security manager?\n\nA. Yes, but while a security manager doesn\"t always need to be hired (especially in smaller organizations), someone must perform the functions of security management all the same. Many organizations prefer to hire a systems administrator and include security management as one of his or her primary duties. This is an acceptable strategy as long as the administrator has sufficient time to dedicate to security management. If, however, routine administrative functions take up a considerable part of the administrator\"s work day, then the organization will be better served by having someone who is able to focus on system security.\n\nQ. Would assigning a top educational administrator to the security manager role show commitment to system security?\n\nA. Not necessarily. Although top administrators are often entrusted with sufficient authority to be effective security managers, it is quite possible that they do not possess the technical expertise necessary for the job. Security managers are responsible for operationalizing all aspects of system security- a task that requires significant technical competence. A secondary, but important, consideration is that managing system security can demand a great deal of time- time that policy-makers and other top administrators may be unable to devote given their other essential duties. While it is imperative that top administrators are actively committed to security effectiveness, in most cases it makes sense that the day-to-day administration of system security be assigned to a security/systems professional.\n\nQ. Where does the security manager fit into the organizational hierarchy?\n\nA. Just as the title implies, security managers and system administrators are most often considered to serve in a management capacity. The important tasks of developing security regulations, training staff, and monitoring implementation require that the security manager be vested with substantial authority. While the security manager is not to be confused with a superintendent or principal, he or she should be considered to be the system \"boss.\" If the security manager is not able to confidently address security miscues at even the highest levels of the organizational hierarchy, protecting system resources adequately becomes an impossibility.\n\nNurturing Support within the Organization\n\nEven when an organization is committed to improving its information security, security managers often find themselves having to work harder than should be necessary to remind staff of the importance of each step in the security process. Fielding questions about the necessity of sometimes burdensome procedures or the expense of technical and training initiatives is an inevitable but important part of the security manager\"s job. Make no mistake about it, the security manager must not only administer security policy but must also champion it.\n\nGarnering Administrator Support\n\nSupport for security at the managerial level is essential because security planning must be aligned within the context of greater organizational goals. Management must make sure that the organization\"s broader plans are adequately considered and that security policy conforms to existing rules, regulations, and laws to which the organization is subject- not to mention that adequate funding is budgeted. After all, every dollar that is invested in security, as necessary as it surely is, takes a dollar away from some other activity.\n\nSecurity must be a joint effort between decision-makers, technical staff, and all other personnel.\n\nWhile technical support staff may have the best understanding of the ramifications of given technology initiatives, only users have the opportunity to implement policies and management the power to enforce them- and policies that are neither implemented nor enforced are worthless. Real security requires strong, visible support from senior management as a group, as well as personal accountability and exemplary behavior from individual managers. If management ignores or circumvents security procedures, others will do likewise.\n\nManagement can encourage an atmosphere of security, or they can undermine it- their behavior in large part determines whether staff who are meticulous about security are considered to be the oddballs, or the norm.\n\nEmployees also have an ethical responsibility to maintain the security of confidential information entrusted to them.\n\nEnsuring User Support\n\nComputers and networks are valuable tools to their users. Many people rely on them every day to help perform their jobs more efficiently. When computer resources are not available, fulfilling job requirements can become considerably more difficult. One important role a security manager plays is communicating to staff that protecting the system is in their best interests as well as those of the organization.\n\nPlanning for the Unexpected\n\nTraditional computer security frequently relies heavily upon protecting systems from attack and minimizing the likelihood of software and equipment failure, but little attention is usually paid to how to handle an attack or failure once it actually occurs. The result is that when a problem does occur, many decisions are made in haste. Often, such decisions reflect this lack of forethought and don\"t contribute to tracking down the source of the incident, collecting evidence to be used in prosecution efforts, protecting the valuable information contained on the system, or preparing for system recovery.\n\nA good policy whenever security is threatened, whether it be a disk crash, an external intruder attack, or natural disaster, is to have planned for potential adverse events in advance. The only way to be sure that you have planned in advance for such troubles is to plan now- because you can never predict exactly when a security breach will happen. It could happen in a year, a month, or this afternoon. Planning for emergencies beforehand goes beyond \"good policy.\" There is no substitute for security breach response planning and other more overarching contingency planning!\n\nPossible responses to an attack:\n\nProtect and Proceed\n\nPursue and Prosecute\n\nPanic and Pray\n\nThe primary goal of \"Protect and Proceed\" is the preservation of site assets and the timely return to normal activities.\n\nThe primary goal of \"Protect and Prosecute\" is the identification of intruders and the gathering of evidence of all unauthorized activities.\n\nSecurity Breach Response Planning\n\nThere are three common responses to an attack on an information system: \"protect and proceed,\" \"pursue and prosecute,\" and \"panic and pray.\" Either of the first two strategies, while clearly opposite in design, can be appropriate depending on the nature of the security breach and the philosophy of the organization. The third approach, \"panic and pray,\" while unfortunately more common than the first two, is never an effective response. In fact, the entire rationale for contingency planning is to minimize the need for panic and prayer in the event of a security incident.\n\nProtect and Proceed. If management fears that the site is particularly vulnerable to attack, it may choose a \"protect and proceed\" strategy. Upon detection of an attack, attempts are made to actively interfere with the intruder's penetration, prevent further encroachment, and begin immediate damage assessment and recovery. This process may involve shutting down facilities, closing off access to the network, or other drastic measures. The drawback is that unless the intruder is identified directly, he, she, or it may come back into the site via a different path, or may attack another site.\n\nPursue and Prosecute. This alternative to the \"protect and proceed\" approach adopts the opposite philosophy and goals. Here, the primary goal is to allow intruders to continue to access the system until they can be identified and have evidence of their unauthorized activities gathered against them. While this approach is endorsed by law enforcement agencies and prosecutors because of the evidence it can provide, the major drawback is that the system and its information remain open to potential damage while the organization is trying to identify the source and collect its evidence.\n\nProsecution is not the only possible outcome when an intruder is identified. If the culprit is an employee or a student, the organization may choose to take internal disciplinary action.\n\nCareful consideration must be given to both of these security breach response philosophies by site management. It is imperative that forethought and planning take place before a problem occurs or else staff may not know how to respond in the event of a real emergency: to protect and proceed, or pursue and prosecute? In fact, the strategy eventually adopted might even be one of \"it depends upon the circumstances.\" For example, an education organization might be willing to accept the additional risks of allowing an intruder to access financial records (that have been properly backed up) while he or she is incriminating him- or herself and being identified. On the other hand, the organization might decide that threats that access confidential student records must be thwarted immediately because the potential costs of disclosure are not worth the benefits of capturing the intruder. Regardless of the approach selected, the pros and cons must be examined thoroughly by policy-makers, and users must be made aware of their responsibilities.\n\nAnother decision that management must make concerns any distinctions it chooses to make about different types of unauthorized users. Sites may find it helpful to define who it considers to be \"insiders\" and \"outsiders\" by referring to administrative, legal, or political boundaries. These boundaries imply what type of action should be taken to reprimand an offending party- from written censure to pressing legal charges. Security plans need to spell out these options and how an appropriate response will be determined if someone is caught behaving in an unauthorized manner.\n\nSecurity plans should also include procedures for interaction with outside organizations, including law enforcement agencies and other security support sites. The procedures should state who is authorized to make such contact and how it should be handled. Contact information for security support organizations can be found in Appendix E.\n\nContingency Planning\n\nHard drives will crash, electrical surges will zap data, and files will be erased accidentally. General system security (Chapters 5-9) is designed and implemented to protect an organization from these disturbing events. But as valuable as locks, virus scanners, disk labels, and passwords can be, if a fire, flood, or sophisticated intruder knocks at your door uninvited, be prepared for trouble.\n\nMake no mistake about the term contingency planning- events that could happen will happen, it's just a matter of when.\n\nFor those in the world who are not invincible (read \"everyone\"), being prepared to overcome the unpredictable is wise and necessary.\n\nContingency planning does not protect the organization from a threat but, instead, explicitly details what is to happen if (when) there is a penetration or the system goes down. It prepares the organization for recovery from a breach in security as quickly and efficiently as possible. In fact, another term for contingency-type planning is recovery planning. Planning for recovery from loss or downtime is not pessimistic as much as it is realistic.\n\nContingency planning can be complex and detailed; after all, it amounts to a blueprint for jump-starting the most important aspects of the organization from scratch and, perhaps, even at another site- all during or, at best, immediately after a catastrophe has struck. The following outline includes recommended steps and considerations for effectively and completely preparing a contingency plan. As with all other guidelines offered in this document, each organization (and its security manager and policy-makers) will need to consider these recommendations and customize them to meet their unique needs.\n\nBe inclusive when building the contingency planning team by including:12\n\nKey policy-makers\n\nThe security manager\n\nBuilding management\n\nTechnical support\n\nEnd-users\n\nOther representative staff\n\nLocal authorities\n\nKey outside contacts (e.g., contractors and suppliers)\n\nObtain and/or approximate:13\n\nAn exhaustive list of critical activities performed within the organization (as should be identified in your risk assessment)\n\nAn accurate estimate of the minimum space and equipment necessary for restoring essential operations\n\nA time frame for starting initial operations after a security incident\n\nA list of key personnel and their responsibilities\n\nContingency planning should be as specific as possible: If threat \"a\" happens, the organization will respond by doing \"b\"; if \"c\" happens, it will do \"d\".\n\nPerform and/or delegate the following duties as part of the development of a contingency plan:14\n\nCreate an inventory of all assets, including information (data), software, hardware, documentation and supplies- include item by item, the manufacturer's name, model, serial number, and other supporting evidence. Perhaps videotape your facility, including close-ups. Keep it up-to-date and don't forget peripherals.\n\nSet up reciprocal agreements with comparable organizations to share each other\"s equipment in the event of an emergency at one site (e.g., school district to school district, school district to state department, school district to school, school to local nonprofit). The key is that you have compatible equipment requirements (e.g., MAC to MAC or Windows to Windows).\n\nMake plans to procure hardware, software, and other equipment as necessary to ensure that mission-critical activities are resumed with minimal delay. Keep in mind that old equipment that you have replaced may no longer ideally meet your needs, but might suffice in a pinch if it still meets your minimum requirements.\n\nEstablish contractual agreements with \"hot\" and \"cold\" backup sites as appropriate.\n\nIdentify alternative meeting and start-up locations to be used in case regular facilities are damaged or destroyed.\n\nPrepare directions to all off-site locations (if and when moving off-site is actually required).\n\nEstablish procedures for obtaining off-site backup records (i.e., who, what, where, how, and under whose direction).\n\nGather and safeguard contact information and procedures for communicating with key personnel, suppliers, and other important contacts.\n\nArrange with manufacturers to provide priority delivery of emergency orders.\n\nLocate support resources that might be needed (e.g., equipment repair, trucking, and cleaning companies).\n\nEstablish emergency agreements with data recovery specialists.\n\nArrange for uninterrupted site security with local police and fire departments.\n\nSpecify the following within the plan:15\n\nIndividual roles and responsibilities- by name and job title so that everyone knows exactly what needs to be done\n\nActions to be taken in advance of an occurrence or undesirable event Actions to be taken at the onset of an undesirable event to limit damage, loss, and compromise\n\nActions to be taken to restore critical functions\n\nActions to be taken to reestablish normal operations\n\nTest the plan:\n\nTest the plan frequently and completely.\n\nAnalyze test results to determine further needs (e.g., more training and better backup storage).\n\nPeriodically try to restore files that have been backed up (be sure to make secondary backups so that you are not risking your only backup copy of the data, but otherwise make the process identical to a real emergency).\n\nDeal with damage appropriately:\n\nIf a disaster actually occurs, document all costs (even interim assessment costs) and videotape the damage (to serve as proof of loss).\n\nDon't do anything about water damage to technical equipment except immediately contact professional recovery technicians.\n\nBe prepared to overcome downtime on your own- insurance settlements can take time to be resolved. Once settled, rebuilding, repurchasing, and reinstalling can take even more time, so don't expect that anything short of being completely prepared will get your office rolling again in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nGive consideration to other significant issues:\n\nDon't make the plan unnecessarily complicated.\n\nMake one individual responsible for maintaining the plan, but have it structured so that others are authorized and prepared to implement it if needed.\n\nKeep the plan in a secure but convenient location so that it can be accessed as needed.\n\nUpdate the plan regularly and whenever changes are made to your system.\n\nRecognize that people always come first (before equipment, information, or mission).\n\nThis anecdote may sound far-fetched, but something remarkably similar was reported to have happened after the 1996 California earthquake.\n\nDon't let your organization contribute to the numerous stories of contingency plans that failed because of a minor oversight that easily could have been remedied, but wasn't identified until it was too late.\n\nTesting and Review\n\nMost organizations undergo some sort of annual financial auditing as a regular part of their fiscal life. So, too, are security audits an important part of running any computing environment. A complete security audit should include an examination of any policies that affect or are affected by system security, as well as a thorough test of each mechanism that is in place to enforce said policies. After all, a plan isn't much good if it can't be implemented- and the only way to really be sure that security policies and mechanisms are being implemented properly is through extensive testing (or during a real emergency, at which point it is too late to correct shortcomings).\n\nKeep in mind that there are limits to reasonable testing. The purpose of testing is to verify that security procedures are being implemented properly and meet critical policy goals, not to prove the absoluteness of every aspect of the system and policy.\n\nAlthough security drills can't be scheduled every day of the week without seriously affecting office productivity (and probably morale), they should be conducted as frequently as is necessary to determine that security procedures are being implemented effectively. What kind of drills? Well, if your risk assessment (see Chapter 2) identifies a particular type of natural disaster as a primary threat to your organization, then a drill based on that scenario could be constructed (e.g., a test to verify your backup and recovery mechanisms after an earthquake). On the other hand, if your greatest threat is from external intruders attempting to penetrate your system, a drill might be conducted that simulates a hacker attack in order to observe access countermeasures in action.\n\nAlthough security can't be tested each day, testing must be performed frequently enough to verify the effectiveness of security initiatives.\n\nIf full-fledged security drills prove to be too time-consuming and disruptive to normal operations to be implemented on a large scale, consider testing individual facets of the security system one at a time. Backup procedures can be examined to make sure that data can be recovered from storage tapes. Log files can be checked to make sure that information that is supposed to be maintained has been done so accurately. And other features of the system can be evaluated and analyzed as well. When a security drill is performed, great care should be given to devising the test. It is important to clearly identify what is being tested, how the test will be conducted, and what results are to be expected. All aspects of this process should be documented and included in, or as an adjunct to, the security policy.\n\nWho performs security audits and drills?\n\nThe organization's security professional(s)\n\nEmployee teams (peer reviewers from within the organization)\n\nExternal reviewer teams (from cooperatives, consortia, or other partner organizations)\n\nHired external expert security consultants\n\nImplementation and Day-to-Day Maintenance\n\nSecurity is more than keeping hackers and other trouble-makers out of your system. It involves a host of internal practices that serve to protect information in the case of system or disk failure. Some of the main activities security managers engage in on a day-to-day basis include administering backup and virus protection mechanisms, staying abreast of software updates, managing user accounts, and monitoring system activity.\n\nRecommended practices concerning actual backup procedures are included in Chapter 6.\n\nBackups\n\nIt is almost impossible to over-emphasize the need for a good backup strategy. System backups not only protect the organization in the event of hardware failure or accidental deletions, but they also protect staff against unauthorized or accidental changes made to file contents. If an error is ever made (and we all know that they are), having the option of accessing an unaltered backup can be very appealing. But reaching into those archives is a viable strategy only when backup files have been made properly- a backup of a file that contains the errors and/or viruses you are trying to eliminate usually isn't very helpful. Similarly, backup files need to be created at appropriate intervals and themselves must be well protected from damage and destruction.\n\nWhich type of backup strategy makes sense for your organization? That depends on the types and number of files in the system, the level of technical expertise within the organization, and the organization's commitment to security- information that can be found in the results of a well-executed risk assessment (see Chapter 2). Even after needs unique to the organization have been identified, however, there are several more overarching issues that need to be considered before establishing backup plans:\n\nWhat amount of exposure to data loss can your organization comfortably tolerate?\n\nHow old is your equipment? How reliable is it?\n\nWhat is the nature of your workplace? Do you process new data everyday?\n\nTo further evaluate the type of backup strategy that will best meet your organization's needs, also weigh the following factors:16\n\nThe time and effort required to make changes to the files:\n\nIf changes to the file take only a little time, backing up those changes may not be imperative. If the changes require a great deal of work (e.g., entering data collected from a long form), don't risk that effort and instead back it up frequently.\n\nThe time and effort required to back up the files:\n\nIf the actual backing up process requires little effort, why put it off? If it is time consuming, be more aware of proper timing.\n\nThe value of the data:\n\nIf the data are particularly valuable, back them up more often. If not, frequent backup may be less necessary.\n\nThe rate of file change:\n\nIf a document changes rapidly (e.g., because of the operator's speed in data entry), more frequent backup is probably needed.\n\nYou may choose a combination of complete and partial backup routines. However, when initiating any system, a complete backup should first be done to serve as a reference point.\n\nIn general, there are three types of backup strategies:\n\nA complete backup- backing up your entire hard drive. The advantage of this strategy is its completeness; you will get a snapshot of all your hard disk's contents.\n\nA partial backup- only backing up selected directories. This is useful and efficient if your work is concentrated in a specific area of your hard disk.\n\nAn incremental backup- only backing up those files that have been changed since the last backup. It means using backup software to scan the files to see if they have been changed since the last backup cycle. If so, the file is saved; if not, the previous backup is maintained.\n\nAbove all, devise a backup strategy that is realistic for your organization's setting.\n\nSo how do all of these factors get synthesized into an effective strategy for meeting an organization's needs? The answer is simple: use the information available in order to devise a backup plan that is most likely to be implemented. Whatever the solution might be, be creative enough to develop the strategy that is most likely to ensure that your data gets backed up. It is imperative to establish realistic policies based on your agency's environment.\n\nIn any case, set a backup schedule that fits your agency's needs and work style and stick with it. Here are a few examples of common backup routines:\n\nTwice daily: partial at noon, full at end of day\n\nOnce daily: full backup at end of day\n\nThree times weekly: full backup at end of every other day\n\nTwice weekly: full backup Tuesday, partial on Thursday\n\nOnce a week: full backup\n\nMonthly: full backup\n\nOption C, \"In a secure off-site location,\" is the best option from purely a security perspective. See Chapter 5 for recommendations on securing a location.\n\nA last major planning issue to consider is what to do with backup files once they have been created. The choice of backup location depends on the agency's needs, resources, and ability to secure its physical structure (see Chapter 5). Any single option, or mixture of options, can be chosen as long as they meet the site's needs and have a realistic chance of being implemented. Backup storage options include:\n\nOption A: In the same room- great for easily recovering files after data loss, but bad if a threat gets \"in\" the room. Option B: In the same building- less convenient for correcting mistakes, but physical separation increases security as a single event is less likely to damage everything Option C: In a secure, off-site location- not convenient at all for quick data recovery, but excellent for protection if maintained in a secure facility.\n\nLike all security decisions, selecting a location for off-site storage facilities should be based on risk assessment findings. If, for example, risk assessment shows that an earthquake is the threat of chief concern, locating an off-site storage facility 100 miles away but along the same fault line makes little sense. Similarly, if risk assessment identifies flood as a paramount threat, the location of off-site storage should be outside the same flood plain.\n\nSee Chapter 6 for more specific guidelines about combating viruses and other rogue programming.\n\nVirus Protection\n\nAny machine that is connected to a network or that interacts with others via diskettes or a modem is vulnerable to rogue programs: computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and the like. It is the security manager's duty to develop and monitor procedures for preventing viruses and other rogue programs from infiltrating the system. As a rule of thumb, no diskette from outside the system (including brand name, shrink-wrapped software) should ever be used on a system machine without first having been scanned by an up-to-date antivirus program.\n\nSoftware Updates\n\nIt goes without saying that computer systems have bugs. Even operating systems, upon which we depend for so much of the protection of our information, have bugs. Because of this, software publishers release updates on a frequent basis. Often these updates are, in fact, plugs for holes in the software's security that have been discovered. It is important that whenever these bugs are identified, the system manager takes all action possible to remedy them as soon as possible in order to minimize exposure.\n\nA corollary to the \"bug problem\" deals with the source for obtaining upgrades to software. Many computer systems and software packages come with support from the manufacturer or supplier. Remedies that come directly from such a source tend to be trustworthy and can usually be implemented fairly quickly after receipt (and proper testing no matter the source). Other sources, such as software posted on Internet sites, must be scrutinized more closely.\n\nAs a general rule, trust manufacturer upgrades more than those that are posted on the Internet.\n\nEffective security demands \"checks and balances\" so that every user, including the system adminis-trator and security manager, is accountable for system activity- no one should be able to print his or her own paycheck without being monitored.\n\nUser Account Management\n\nAs stated throughout this chapter, a single person needs to have primary responsibility for an information system. For this person, the security manager or systems administrator, to effectively supervise the system, he or she needs to have access to all system components and files- access that is commonly referred to as \"system administrator privileges.\" It is generally considered to be good practice to share system administrator access privileges with someone other than the system administrator, if for no other reason than to have emergency system access should the administrator ever become unavailable. But, having said this, such total access also requires total accountability, and should be limited to the fewest number of staff as is necessary to keep the system secure- after all, each person with total system access has the ability to override any and all security features.\n\nUsers other than the system manager (and an accountable replacement in case of emergency) should be given access to the system based solely on their job needs. Restricting user access minimizes the opportunities for accidents and other possibly inappropriate actions (see Chapter 8). Through the use of user accounts, each authorized user is identified before accessing the system, and any action that is made by that user is classified as such.\n\nUsers should be given access only to files and systems that they need to do their jobs, and nothing more.\n\nTo recognize deviations from normal system use, the manager must understand how the system behaves when it is running properly.\n\nSystem Use Monitoring\n\nSystem monitoring can be done by either the security manager or by software designed specifically for that purpose. Monitoring a system involves looking at all aspects of the system, identifying patterns of regular use, and searching for anything unusual. Most operating systems store information about system use in special files referred to as log files. Examination of these log files on a regular basis is often the first line of defense in detecting unauthorized use of the system. System managers should:\n\nCompare lists of currently logged-in users and past log-in histories. Most users typically log in and out at roughly the same time each day. An account logged in outside the \"normal\" time for the account may be a sign of unauthorized activity and require investigation and explanation.\n\nCheck system logs for unusual error messages. For example, a large number of failed log-in attempts in a short period of time may indicate that someone is trying to guess passwords.\n\nWhile the security manager is responsible for monitoring user activity, doing so becomes much more feasible when working with and not against the staff.\n\nThe task of systems monitoring is not as daunting as it may seem. Security managers can execute many monitoring tasks periodically throughout the day during even the briefest of free moments (e.g., while waiting on hold on the telephone). By executing the commands frequently, the manager will rapidly become familiar with seeing \"normal\" activities and become better able to spot things that are out of the ordinary.\n\nThe single most important thing about monitoring system use is that it be done regularly. Picking one day out of the month to monitor the system is not a solid security strategy, since a breach can take place in a matter of hours or even minutes. Only by maintaining a constant vigil can you expect to detect security violations in time to react to them- hence one appeal of monitoring software that, unlike even the most dedicated of administrators, is able to work 24 hours and seven days a week.\n\nDespite the advantages that regular system monitoring provides, some intruders will be aware of the standard log-in mechanisms used by systems they are attacking and will actively attempt to evade these mechanisms. Thus, while regular monitoring is useful in detecting intruders, it does not guarantee that your system is secure and should not be considered an infallible method of detecting unauthorized use.\n\nSecurity Management Checklist\n\nWhile it may be tempting to simply refer to the following checklist as your security plan, to do so would limit the effectiveness of the recom-mendations. They are most useful when initiated as part of a larger plan to develop and implement security policy throughout an organization. Other chapters in this document also address ways to customize policy to your organization's specific needs- a concept that should not be ignored if you want to maximize the effectiveness of any given guideline.\n\nSecurity Checklist for Chapter 4\n\nThe brevity of a checklist can be helpful,\n\nbut it in no way makes up for the detail of the text."
