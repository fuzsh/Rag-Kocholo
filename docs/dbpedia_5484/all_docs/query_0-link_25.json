        "text": "Before the rise of optical discs (CDs and DVDs) and hard drives, magnetic media formats such as cassettes, VHS or Betamax tapes and floppy disks were the most common way to store audio, video or digital data. However, this format is rapidly deteriorating, leading to the inevitable loss of what they contain.\n\nUnlike film, which typically presents obvious signs of deterioration such as vinegar syndrome – marked by a distinct and (you guessed it) vinegary smell – or a change in visual appearance, magnetic media deterioration is often only evident when the media is accessed via a stereo, computer, VHS player or similar playback device. These devices, however, are becoming increasingly rare. The potential loss of otherwise perfectly preserved data because of a lack of playback devices is known as obsolescence.\n\nThis guide is based on the conservation practices we employ at ACMI and is intended to help you preserve your own magnetic media home collection to ensure prolonged accessibility for future generations, such as the following gem from the ACMI Collection.\n\nWhen handling any media, magnetic or otherwise, work with clean, dry hands and in a clean environment. Handle only the enclosure and not the guard, even though the temptation is to continually flip it and have it spring back in place (and trust us, it is fun). In addition, care should be taken around the case or any paper labels glued on the enclosure, especially if they are ripped or contain any relevant information.\n\nStorage\n\nPre-Storage Actions\n\nBe kind, please rewind!\n\nPrior to storage, VHS, Betamax and cassette tapes should be wound to their beginning using a playback device. Doing this will tightly pack the magnetic tape with the appropriate tension, which can prevent tape distortion and exposure to dust.\n\nAny case that comes with the media, assuming it’s in good condition, can be kept with the enclosure. Damaged cases can introduce dust that can scratch the strip, introduce mould and may collect inside playback device, damaging it too. In this instance, it may be worth scanning the damaged case if it contains any pertinent information. If possible, transfer the tape to a plastic hinged case made of polypropylene, as they are sturdier and are made of archival-quality materials, which are specially formulated to degrade slower.\n\nAs anyone who has accidentally taped over home movie footage of a wedding with a footy game can attest, overwriting data is a real risk with irreversible consequences. To this end, some magnetic media formats come with a physical copy-protection feature, usually in the form of a button, switch or removable tab, located somewhere on the enclosure. When switched on, these prevent the overwriting of a tape’s contents by a playback device. As there are numerous types of magnetic media, each with its own copy-protection features, more detailed information about these can be found here. Note that in some formats, enabling copy-protection may be permanent as it requires the breaking off of a plastic tab on the enclosure.\n\nStoring Magnetic Media\n\nMuch like a conservative vampire, magnetic media loves being in the dark, hates change and abhors bad analogies. Magnetic media is best stored in an environment with no natural light and few fluctuations in temperature and humidity. An uninsulated attic or shed, for instance, may not be ideal due to uncontrollable environmental changes. Generally, the more barriers between your collection and any significant areas of water, heat, cold or humidity (the outside, a bathroom, a heating or cooling unit) the better.\n\nA centrally-located closet in your house might be a good home storage location. The items should be stored off the floor to lower the risk of damage from a flood or pests. Since magnetism is used to store data on the tape, prolonged exposure to outside sources of magnetisation can have adverse effects. To avoid this, move any strong magnets or objects that generate magnetic fields like loudspeakers. Tapes should be stored vertically to cut down on the risk of warping or cracking.\n\nTo Number or Not to Number\n\nMuch like the Dewey Decimal system in a library, giving each item a unique identifier makes them easier to track. Tapes, after all, tend to look the same after a while. This system can be as simple as a numeric sequence (001, 002, 003 etc) or as complicated as denoting the media type on the tracking number (VHS_001, CAS_002, BMX_003 etc).\n\nWhatever numbering system you choose, it is important that this number is both recorded in your inventory as well as physically attached to the item or its case. Use archival-quality labelling materials like acid-free paper and archival pens, which are generally more stable and able to resist change over time. Avoid placing a label directly on the object itself, as this may damage the enclosure or affect playback. If the object is too small or lacks a case, write the number onto a bag of archival-quality plastic like polypropylene and place the object inside. Writing the number onto a paper or cloth tape label and tying it onto the object, if practical, is also an option. Whatever your solution, it is important to remain consistent in your numbering and document the logic behind the system you chose, to prevent confusion in the future.\n\nSetting Priorities\n\nInventories can be daunting, especially in the beginning. Start simple and first view items as a single collection instead of a pile of separate items. For instance, you can divide your collection into different groups based on criteria like time-period, content or format. Grouping items also means you can easily see how much work it will take to inventory the items to a level of detail you prefer.\n\nDecisions made about your inventory can also be flexible and improved in the future. Don’t lock yourself into finding the ‘perfect’ system before documenting or digitising your first item only to realise that it may not work for the entire collection. The best system is what is logical, what works for your level of commitment to your collection and one that is understandable and will function independently of you in the future.\n\nDigitising Tapes and Backups\n\nMagnetic media, even under the best storage conditions, will inevitably become inaccessible regardless of its deterioration status due to obsolescence of its playback devices. The best way to ensure prolonged accessibility is by migrating the data from the magnetic media onto more contemporary (and therefore more accessible) formats. Migration of this data onto a digital format is (predictably) called digitisation. The good news is that there are plenty of companies that offer this service, many of which can be found online.\n\nWhile service options may differ, a good rule of thumb is to ask for a digital file on a USB or hard drive and avoid moving them onto DVDs. There are a host of reasons for this: First, obsolescence rears its head again, as DVD and DVD players are becoming less common due to the rise of streaming platforms. Additionally, a DVD has a limited and relatively small data capacity, may only work on certain playback machines and can’t be copied as easily as a digital file. In fact, with a digital file, you can create your own DVDs as well as make as many digital copies as you need.\n\nOnce you have a digital file, it is good to follow the 3-2-1 Backup Rule to lower the chance that it may accidentally deleted or corrupted:\n\nHave at least 3 copies of the digital file\n\nStore these backups on at least 2 different types of formats (e.g. a portable hard drive, a USB, on a computer, or cloud storage)\n\nStore at least 1 backup in a geographically separated location (e.g. a hard drive at a relative’s house).\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the process of preservation is cyclical. Obsolescence will eventually affect the hard drive or USB with the digital file, as it now does with magnetic media, so it will be worth occasionally updating these digital files to newer storage formats.\n\nA few last words\n\nWe all know that feeling of being overwhelmed when faced with a large, seemingly insurmountable, project. Just think of the memories you’ll rediscover, the new ones you’ll make and the satisfaction you’ll feel knowing that the next generation can appreciate the life you’ve documented. Well, let’s be honest, they’re probably going to make fun of your tragic haircut, music taste and fashion choices, but it’s not their fault they lack taste."
