        "text": "When the document is more about magneto-optical elements as such, it goes in G02F 1/09 or lower groups. However, if the field of application (G11B) is mentioned in the document or if the expert recognizes that the magneto-optical elements looks like those typically used in the G11B then the document should also be classified in the G11B\n\nHowever, the 'record carrier' subgroups (G11B 5/76 and the subgroups which depend upon it) are only used if there is something interesting about the carrier itself (other than the materials of which it is made, for which see G11B 5/62 et seq.) e.g. a disk has a series of timing slots or holes in it, or a drum is made removable by separating into two halves longitudinally, etc.\n\nIn H01F 10/00 are classified \"Magnetic thin films\" in general, i.e. thin films whose application is not specific or not limited for magnetic recording or reproducing. Examples are Magnetic Spin Tunnel Junctions (STJ) or Spin Valve structures (SV) which are classified in H01F 10/3254 and H01F 10/3268 respectively and not in G11B 5/39 if the invention does only relate to the magnetic films and their magnetic coupling, without a specific adaptation of the junction or Spin valve to MR reproducing heads, i.e. if the use of the STJ or SV as reproducing head is not mentioned or mentioned among other possibilities and the invention has no specific information related e.g. to the shaping, shielding and biasing necessary for a STJ to be adapted as reproducing head. If, on the contrary, the invention only refers specifically to an adaptation of the STJ or SV thin film structure as reading head, then only the code G11B 5/39 (or subcodes) is given. When the invention has both aspects, i.e. the thin film structure in general and the specific application as reproducing head, then both codes are given.\n\nClassification in this area is primarily of the claimed invention with each embodiment of claimed subject matter being Inventive unless the subject matter recited is nominal and well known in the art. Relevant disclosure in the specification should be classified primarily as Additional information unless deemed particularly relevant to the invention as a whole, in which case it may be given an Inventive symbol.\n\nAn invention is to 'plural inventive non-magnetic layers' for the purpose of placement in appropriate subgroups of G11B 5/736 - G11B 5/7379 if the independent claim is directed to multiple non-magnetic layers, even if these layers are recited in name only or if dependent claims recite multiple non-magnetic layers in other than name only. The sole exception would be if a dependent claim further limits the structural location of one of the inventive non-magnetic layers relative to an included soft magnetic layer (such that only a single non-magnetic layer is now above or below an included soft magnetic layer - see example 2, below).\n\nA base layer deposited solely as part of a substrate that has no disclosed utility in establishing the magnetic properties of the recording layer would not be classified here, even if containing non-magnetic particles. Such a layer would be classified in G11B 5/739 according to the scheme title of G11B 5/733 and would include layers typically denoted as smoothing layers, coating layers, etc. that are taught as part of the substrate, per se.\n\nCare must be taken to distinguish between (a) a composite or coated substrate and (b) a subsequently formed non-magnetic base layer when considering binder media type structures. A layer recited as an \"underlayer\", \"undercoat\", \"lower layer\" or \"intermediate layer\" is a layer distinct from a substrate. For a layer to be considered as a part of a substrate, it must be recited specifically in the disclosure of forming the substrate or as part of a substrate prior to any deposition of a recording layer structure.\n\nIncluded herein are NiP plated substrates wherein the NiP plating layer is inventive and is clearly taught as part of the substrate. NiP layers deposited with the purpose of corrosion prevention, adhesion, or establishing the microstructure of the recording layer are classified in G11B 5/7363 or G11B 5/7371 . The lines between these subgroups and the current subgroup can often be ascertained by looking at the method of depositing the NiP layer and/or whether the NiP layer is deposited on an already commercially formed substrate (as opposed to being deposited to form the substrate).\n\nThe distinction between a lower layer used in a binder-type media and a coating layer for purpose of classification here depends on the recited end use of the layer, as most are composed of similar mixtures of binder material plus non-magnetic particulate filler. If the layer is recited as a \"lower layer\", \"under layer\", \"first layer\", it is usually directed to establishing the deposition of the magnetic layer and are classified in G11B 5/733 - G11B 5/7334. The same applies if the deposition is a \"wet-on-wet\" process where the magnetic layer is immediately deposited following the non-magnetic layer.\n\nThe distinction between a lower layer used in a binder-type media and a coating layer for purpose of classification here depends on the recited end use of the layer, as most are composed of similar mixtures of binder material plus non-magnetic particulate filler. If the layer is recited as a \"lower layer\", \"under layer\", \"first layer\", it is usually directed to establishing the deposition of the magnetic layer and are classified in G11B 5/733 - G11B 5/7334. The same applies if the deposition is a \"wet-on-wet\" process where the magnetic layer is immediately deposited following the non-magnetic layer.\n\nDocuments are only assigned this class (or code) if the particular problem or solution of the invention disclosed relates to the aspect of phase depth AND if there is no better classification (see below). (Phase depth effects are the most common basis for reproduction of information in G11B 7/00: the reproduction of the usual data pits in a CD, DVD, BD (i.e. pits in the plastic substrate, covered with a reflective layer) relies on this effect.)\n\nIf the optical elements used are not especially adapted for the type of access, but e.g. just used or controlled in a special way then the document should be classified in G11B 7/083 and coded in the appropriate optical element group (e.g. galvanomirror G11B 7/08564 or G11B 7/00:0085B3).\n\nThere is no specific classification in G11B 7/00 for the manufacture of optical elements per se, therefore the manufacture of the optical elements is classified in the most relevant optical element group itself if this is closely related to the application of the element to optical recording/reproduction. (For mounting, aligning of elements in the head see G11B 7/22).\n\nElements for apodisation (e.g. for \"super-resolution\" i.e. to reduce the beam width of a main lobe of the beam below the diffraction limit for that wavelength) but G11B 7/1387 has precedence (i.e. if a lens for near-field apparatus includes a shielding element it is classified in G11B 7/1387, and not also G11B 7/1381).\n\nIn a hemispherical lens, the rays that come in at large angles (relative to optical axis) from the previous lens are totally internally reflected at the interface due to the refractive index difference BUT there is an evanescent wave which doesn't die to zero immediately. This can be used to read/write on a medium, as long as the medium is very close (e.g. if the hemispherical lens is on a flying head); Recording may also use the evanescent wave from a very fine tip held near a medium.\n\nFor apparatus compatible with different standards this often involves some way to block the outer part of the beam for a particular wavelength (see e.g. US6396791 Figure 10(a)(b), paragraph 63, and the prior art shown in Figure 11, paragraph 14) using dichroic effects, diffraction grating or phase difference that affect one wavelength more than another, or polarisation (e.g. by using beams polarised in different directions for different wavelengths), but it may involve elements located elsewhere (e.g. US6160646 Figure 6-9, the asymmetrical grating in the central part of the lens is used for CD medium)\n\nany kind of signal processing which is performed when reading data from or recording data to record carriers. This signal processing specifically includes analogue and digital filtering, equalisation, carrier and symbol synchronization (adjustment of read/write clocks), and the corresponding ways of assessing and improving the quality of the recorded/reproduced signal. Modulation and demodulation techniques (i.e. the actual codes and the stochastical methods for recovering the bit sequences that are reproduced from a record carrier), in the context of recording and reproducing. Techniques of applying error correcting codes in recording / reproducing devices, and likewise how interleaving techniques can be used to mitigate the effects of local burst errors. Techniques for actually detecting media errors (e.g. bad sectors), or data structures and algorithms for coping with these errors, e.g. by relocating data from defective sectors to non-defective spare sectors. The sub-group G11B 20/12 also covers the actual format of the record carriers (in the sense of how different kinds of data are arranged on the medium, e.g. documents which describe dedicated areas for storing specific kinds of user or control data, or documents which relate to the data structure of individual sectors). G11B 20/00086 is a prominent sub-group, which comprises documents about all sorts of copy protection and digital rights management for record carriers. Since recent copy protection initiatives address the copyright protection issue with techniques which apply likewise to all kinds of different storage media, this sub-group nowadays also includes copyright protection for record carriers which do not necessarily involve any physical movement between a head and the medium.\n\nModifying and improving the read or write signals (i.e. removing jitter, increasing the SNR), e.g. by using equalisers and filters; anything about how to adjust the frequency and phase of the read/write clock or the bit clock of the demodulation circuit, e.g. clock adjustment with a PLL; anything related to PRML techniques (Partial Response Maximum Likelihood); A/D conversion, recovering the bit string from the analogue HF signal; maximum likelihood estimation and related techniques for recognising the correct bit sequences, e.g. using the Viterbi algorithm. Wobble detection can also be classified here if the document is linked to clocking.\n\nInitially, G11B 20/10527 was supposed contain all documents about how to record PCM audio data. Nowadays it also comprises many documents about how to use intermediate memories (buffers), e.g., playback buffers for ensuring a seamless playback of a recorded video stream while reading the data intermittently in high-speed bursts, or recording buffers for making sure that even in case discontinuous data reception the recording process will not be interrupted; G11B 20/10527 will particularly be assigned if the aspect \"memory\" is important (e.g., addressing within the buffer, adjusting the read/write clock of the buffer, etc.). In the past (when people started recording digitised audio signals on record carriers), G11B 20/10527 was also used for documents about A/D conversion, filtering, quantisation errors, dithering, oversampling, or sampling frequency conversion; these aspects are now classified in G11B 20/10009.\n\nBroadly speaking, the sub-group G11B 20/12 covers formatting aspects which are at an intermediate level between, on the one hand, those covered by G11B 27/00 and, on the other hand, those covered by G11B 5/00 or G11B 7/00. The group G11B 27/00 relates to formatting aspects at the higher system level (e.g., formatting aspects which one would usually associate with the operating system, including specific file formats and the format of control structures such as the TOC, but also the format of playlists and data formats for organising separate A/V data streams, etc.). The groups G11B 5/00(magnetic recording media) and G11B 7/00(optical recording media) cover aspects that pertain to the physical structure of the recording medium, such as the physical arrangement of separate layers, and physical characteristics such as the chemical components of which the recording medium is made, the shape of the media, etc.\n\nE.g. binary phase modulation (Manchester codes); also phase or frequency modulation of wobbles. G11B 20/1419 generally relates to codes where a one is coded as a transition from a high to a low level during the middle of a bit cell and a zero is encoded as a transition from a low to a high level during the middle of a bit cell or vice versa, e.g. split phase code, Manchester code conversion to or from biphase space or mark coding, i.e. to or from codes where there is a transition at the beginning of every bit cell and a one has no second transition and a zero has a second transition one half of a bit period later or vice versa, e.g. double frequency code, FM code. Biphase level codes in general: H03M 5/12.\n\nDetecting and correcting errors, e.g. erroneous bits or sectors; testing the medium for defects. This sub-group covers, e.g., the detection of bad sectors, strategies for replacing these sectors by other sectors, the application of various kinds of error correction codes and error detection codes so as to reliably recover the recorded bit sequence, the usage of interleaving schemes for spreading the effect of local defects, the actual detection of such defects by verification and certification processes, the idea of mitigating the effects of a local defect by data interpolation, and the documentation of defects by maintaining different kinds of defect lists.\n\nIn case of defective areas (e.g., bad sectors), relocating the data that was supposed to be recorded to the defective area to another area. This other area can be part of a dedicated spare area (linear replacement), or it can be a sector following the defective sector (skip replacement). Subgroups for applying this principle to tapes (G11B 20/1886) and discs (G11B 20/1889).\n\nediting operations performed on audio or video content recorded on the type of recording medium historically falling under the subclass G11B and extended to any type of recording medium storing physically audio and video content in a permanent manner, resulting in a modified or new recorded content. This covers as well the physical implementations of operations such as cut, paste, merge, adding sound track as well as the definition of the editing operations to be performed within an editor (non-destructive editing, playlist arrangements, editing operations in a video editor).\n\ndetails concerning the type of information attached to a recording content which allows to access said content as well as information indicating reproduction of a sequence of addressed parts of recorded contents (play list typically). This can be with respect to the physical details of the recording medium (subcodes, lead-in, lead-out in case of a CD, AIT track for tape, prepits for DVD) carrying the information as long as the type of the recording medium falls under the subclass G11B. In addition, it covers the case of indexing or addressing information in a audio or video content which are not specific to the physical characteristics of the recording medium such as table of content, metadata and other information which allow navigation within a file containing audio video content (typically a specific file format with indexing and addressing information embedded) or other special modes of reproduction. Special modes of reproduction (trickplay, repeat) are also classified in G11B 27/00.\n\nMonitoring concerns the supervision of the progress of recording or reproducing, mainly monitoring power failure during recording or reproduction and logging the use of medium or apparatus for fault prevention It covers also the testing of the medium as a direct step in a recording and reproducing method and the use of information about the execution of the reproduction and/or recording (flags, power failure).\n\nIn particular, the group G11B 27/00 deals with content management (space management, erasure of programs) concerning pre-recorded material or recorded material such as television programs, once these programs have been recorded on the recording medium. The other aspects of television recording such as the reservation of programs to be recorded are not dealt with in G11B 27/00 but in H04N 5/76, unless it involves using information pertaining to the recording medium usage (dedicated recording area, free space, other meta information such as date for erasure)."
