        "text": "Append: In its most basic form, tape technology is linear in fashion. Later technologies employ serpentine recording where the tape is written/read in multiple passes moving forward and in reverse. There are also helical scan formats, such as DDS, 8mm and AIT, which are written diagonally across the tape.\n\nArchive: Long term on-site or off-site storage.\n\nASCII: American Standard Code Information Interchange. An ANSI (American National Standards Institute) code for transferring information from one computer language to another.\n\nBackup: To copy information from one type of data storage medium onto another data storage medium. Backup of data ensures information is preserved in case one medium is lost\n\nBit: Smallest amount of data that can be processed by a computer; represents the binary value of either one or zero.\n\nBlock: Consists of a specific, pre-determined number of bytes.

One reason CAS is so effective is its use of a hashing algorithm to assign a unique identifier, or digital fingerprint, to each stored object. That process, coupled with storage best practices, ensures that whatever goes into the system is exactly what comes out. If a data element changes, it receives a new unique identifier, aka content address. The stored object’s physical location doesn’t matter.\n\nCloud Storage: Is a model of networked online storage where data is stored on multiple virtual servers, generally hosted by third parties, rather than being hosted on dedicated servers. Hosting companies operate large data centers; and people who require their data to be hosted buy or lease storage capacity from them and use it for their storage needs. The data center operators, in the background, virtualize the resources according to the requirements of the customer and expose them as storage pools, which the customers can themselves use to store files or data objects.
