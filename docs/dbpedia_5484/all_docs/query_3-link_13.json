        "text": "If your child breaks a bone, a cast can help support and protect the injury as it heals. But a cast can't do its job without proper care. Find out more about the basics of cast care.\n\nWhat are the different types of casts?\n\nCasts are custom-made to fit and support injured limbs. There are two main types of casts:\n\nPlaster casts. Plaster casts are easier to mold for some uses than are fiberglass casts. Plaster casts are also generally less expensive.\n\nFiberglass casts. These plastic casts are typically lighter and more durable than plaster casts. Also, X-rays penetrate fiberglass casts better than plaster casts — making it easier for your doctor to examine your child's bones while he or she is still wearing the cast.\n\nWhat can be done to reduce swelling?\n\nSwelling can cause your child's cast to feel tight and uncomfortable. To reduce swelling:\n\nElevate the affected area. For the first 24 to 72 hours after your child's cast is applied, use pillows to raise the cast above the level of your child's heart. Your child will need to recline if the cast is on a leg.\n\nApply ice. Loosely wrap an ice pack covered in a thin towel around your child's cast at the level of the injury. Wrapping the ice is important to keep the cast dry. Ice that's packed in a rigid container and touches the cast at only one point won't be as effective.\n\nKeep moving. Encourage your child to frequently move the fingers or toes of the injured limb.\n\nWhat can I do if my child wants to scratch under the cast?\n\nA cast can cause your child's underlying skin to feel itchy. To relieve itchy skin, turn a hair dryer on a cool setting and aim it under the cast.\n\nDon't allow your child to stick objects, such as a coat hanger, inside the cast to scratch his or her skin. This could cause an injury or infection.\n\nIs it OK to get a cast wet?\n\nThat depends on the type of cast your child has. In general, casts are meant to stay dry. A wet cast can lead to skin irritation or infection.\n\nPlaster casts and fiberglass casts with conventional padding aren't waterproof. Keep your child's cast dry during baths or showers by covering it with two layers of plastic, sealed with a rubber band or duct tape. Avoid swimming while wearing a cast that isn't waterproof.\n\nA fiberglass cast that has a waterproof liner can get wet. Only certain types of breaks can be treated with a waterproof cast and liner. Ask your doctor if it's safe for your child to get his or her cast wet.\n\nIf the cast does get wet, you might be able to dry out the inside padding with a hair dryer. Use a low heat setting to avoid burning or irritating the skin.\n\nHow can my child keep his or her cast in good shape?\n\nTry these tips:\n\nKeep it clean. Keep dirt and sand away from the inside of your child's cast.\n\nSkip toiletries. Avoid placing powder, lotion or deodorant on or near the cast.\n\nLeave adjustments to your child's doctor. Don't pull the padding out of your child's cast. Don't trim the cast or break off rough edges without first asking your child's doctor.\n\nWhat else do I need to know about my child's cast?\n\nContact your child's doctor immediately if your child:\n\nFeels increasing pain and tightness in the injured limb\n\nFeels numbness or tingling in the injured hand or foot\n\nFeels burning or stinging under the cast\n\nDevelops excessive swelling below the cast\n\nCan't move the toes or fingers of his or her injured limb, or they become blue or cold\n\nSays the cast feels too tight or too loose\n\nDevelops red or raw skin around the cast\n\nDevelops a crack, soft spots or a foul odor in the cast, or gets the cast soaking wet and doesn't dry it properly\n\nCaring for a child's cast isn't always easy. Remind your child that taking care of the cast will help minimize discomfort during the healing process.\n\nSee more In-depth"
