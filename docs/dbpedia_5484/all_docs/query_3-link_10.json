        "text": "What is a corneal abrasion?\n\nA corneal abrasion is a scratch on, or an injury to, the surface of your cornea, the clear covering on your eye. The epithelium is the name of the surface or top layer of your cornea — there are five layers in total.\n\nOther terms for corneal abrasion include scratched eye or scratched cornea.\n\nAlthough a corneal abrasion isn’t likely to be a serious injury, you should make an appointment with your healthcare provider. If the scratch develops into an infection, it could cause more damage.\n\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of a corneal abrasion?\n\nSigns and symptoms of a corneal abrasion can include:\n\nEye pain.\n\nThe feeling that something is in your eye.\n\nWatery eyes.\n\nBlurred vision.\n\nRed eyes.\n\nSensitivity to light (photophobia).\n\nSwollen eyes or eyelids.\n\nWhat causes a corneal abrasion?\n\nYou can scratch your cornea by getting something in your eye while you’re working with equipment or tools. Things that can get into your eye and scratch it include:\n\nDust, dirt, sand or pieces of plants.\n\nTiny bits of wood or metal.\n\nMake-up brushes or applicators.\n\nYour fingernails.\n\nYou can also develop a corneal abrasion from your contact lenses if you:\n\nWear your lenses when your eyes are dry.\n\nHave contact lenses that don’t fit well.\n\nUse too much force to remove or insert your contacts.\n\nWhat are the risk factors for a corneal abrasion?\n\nRisk factors for corneal abrasions include:\n\nWorking around eye hazards, like grinding machines or sawmills.\n\nLandscaping without safety glasses.\n\nParticipating in sports that may cause eye injuries.\n\nWearing contact lenses.\n\nHaving dry eyes.\n\nRubbing your eyes repeatedly or with too much force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are the complications of corneal abrasion?\n\nCorneal abrasions are mostly minor and heal quickly when they’re small. Larger scratches on your eye are more likely to result in complications that could include:\n\nKeratitis.\n\nCorneal ulcers.\n\nIritis, inflammation of the iris (the circle of color that surrounds your pupil).\n\nRecurrent erosion syndrome, a condition where you can have repeated episodes of eye pain and blurred vision because the top layer of your cornea is breaking down. Another name for this is recurrent corneal erosion syndrome.\n\nHow is a corneal abrasion diagnosed?\n\nYour healthcare provider will first ask you questions about your medical history and your symptoms. They’ll probably want to know what you were doing around the time that your eye started to bother you.\n\nWhat tests will be done to diagnose a corneal abrasion?\n\nYour provider will do a complete eye exam. This includes the slit lamp exam with the microscope that lets your provider see into your eyes. The provider may have to flip your eyelids inside out if they suspect you have something under your eyelids.\n\nThe provider may instill a yellow dye called fluorescein into your eye. The dye fills in any breaks in the skin of your eye and helps find abrasions easily.\n\nHow is a corneal abrasion treated?\n\nYou, or your provider, may start with flushing out your eye with clean water or saline solution. It’s very important to avoid rubbing your eye.\n\nIf you have something in your eye, your provider may use a swab or an instrument to remove the particle. They’ll use topical anesthesia (numbing ointment or drops) so it won’t hurt.\n\nYour provider will prescribe medication to prevent infection. These may be antibiotic eye drops or ointment. They’ll let you know how long to use them. You’ll probably be able to stop when you go an entire day without symptoms. If you’re not better after three days, you’ll need to let your provider know.\n\nSome common topical antibiotic options include:\n\nErythromycin ointment.\n\nCiprofloxacin drops.\n\nMoxifloxacin drops.\n\nYou probably won’t need pain relievers for a very small scratch. But if you do, your provider will probably recommend that you take an over-the-counter (OTC) oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). In other cases, your provider may prescribe a topical analgesic (pain-relieving eye drops or ointment).\n\nQuite often, providers use a bandage contact lens to allow the abrasion to heal and to reduce pain associated with blinking. In cases where the risk with contact lenses is high, providers may recommend a pressure patch with gauze/tape instead.\n\nComplications/side effects of the treatment\n\nThere’s a risk of infection with a bandage contact lens. If you have one, you’ll need to follow up within one to two days for monitoring.\n\nHow long does it take to recover from treating a corneal abrasion?\n\nIf the corneal abrasion is minor, most people will feel better in 24 to 48 hours. The cells in that part of the eye reproduce very quickly. Larger scrapes may take longer to heal.\n\nIf your eye isn’t feeling better after 24 hours, you should contact your optometrist or ophthalmologist.\n\nHow do I take care of myself if I have a corneal abrasion?\n\nWhen the scratch happens, flush your eye with clean water or sterile saline. Don’t rub your eye. You can try blinking for a bit or keeping your eye completely closed.\n\nIt may help to pull your top eyelid over your bottom eyelid, which should make your eye water. This could make any piece of dust or other type of particle come out of your eye.\n\nWhen should I see my eye care provider?\n\nIf you think you have something in your eye and flushing or blinking doesn’t make it come out, you should see your eye care provider for further evaluation. This is especially true if you’re in a lot of pain or you can’t see well.\n\nAn optometrist or ophthalmologist should handle removing particles from your eye.\n\nIf you’ve followed your treatment recommendations, but your eye isn’t feeling better after 24 hours, call your provider.\n\nCall an eye care provider before going to the emergency room during normal business hours.\n\nYou may need to go to an urgent care center or emergency room if you’re unable to contact an eye care provider or if it’s outside of normal business hours in these cases:\n\nYou know that something has pierced your eye.\n\nYou’re in extreme pain.\n\nYou can’t see well or have had a sudden decrease in vision.\n\nYou have fluid coming out of your eye.\n\nWhat questions should I ask my healthcare provider?\n\nYou may want to ask your provider some questions, such as:\n\nWhat should I watch out for as I heal?\n\nAre there side effects or complications related to this treatment?\n\nDo I need a follow-up appointment?\n\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nYou’ve had times when you felt like you have something in your eye. It might be easy to dismiss this as something that will pass. You may have had someone look in your eye or tried to see your eye in a mirror. However, sometimes you really do have something in your eye, and it’s not an eyelash.\n\nSo, if you have eye pain and watery eyes and you’ve been working around flying particles of dust, wood, plants or metal, you should consider a trip to an eye care provider. It’s much safer for a medical provider to remove particles from your eyes and to evaluate the damage. You may need antibiotics to stop the corneal abrasion from becoming a corneal infection."
