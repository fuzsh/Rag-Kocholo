        "text": "oslomike,\n\nLennart_T is correct; neither your OP or subsequent posts made it clear that you were encountering the problem with the tape during a Rebuild of a Catalog for a AIT Tape Backup Setâ€”I thought it was during a Transfer of that Backup Set to a v6.1 Backup Set.\n\nI also thought you were having this problem using Retrospect Mac 6.1 on your old Mac Pro (2,1). It wasn't until I read this recent post in one of your other threads that I realized you have connected your Exabyte AIT tape drive to your newer Mac Pro (5,1), so you are encountering these problems running macOS 10.13 High Sierraâ€”as you've said in a recent post in the second of your other threads.\n\nNaturally the suggestion now occurs to me that you should move your AIT tape driveâ€”and the ATTO SCSI PCI card it's connected toâ€”back to your old Mac Pro (2,1), and try Rebuilding the lost Catalog for that AIT Tape Backup Set on your old machine. If you can do so including the \"bad\" first tape (which might only have a bad end-of-data marker when it is read by Retrospect Mac 10.5 under High Sierra; there could have been some limitation in the AIT-drive-handling code), then do a Transfer of all 3 tapes to an LTO Tape Backup Set on the old machine, and copy that complete LTO Tape Backup Set on the new machineâ€”to an LTO Tape Media Set. If OTOH you still get the error on the \"bad\" tape, then temporarily postpone copying the \"bad\" tape by doing what I said in the second paragraph of this up-thread postâ€”with the Transfer of the incomplete AIT Backup Set being to an LTO Tape Backup Set .\n\nAfter drafting the above paragraphs I went to dinner, and came back to find you had made another post (up past your Norwegian bedtime, aren't you? ðŸ˜²). Frankly I'm getting rather annoyed, oslomike, with your systematic refusal to clarify in this thread which of your two machines you're talking about. ðŸ¤¢ I'm here to help you, not to play guessing games.\n\nReturning to the final sentence of my third long paragraph aboveâ€”if the AIT tape turns out to be \"bad\" when read on both machines, you could later do one of two things to accomplish what you're asking Lennart_T how to do in the third sentence of the post directly above thisâ€”depending on whether Retrospect will quit when run on your old Mac Pro (2,1). If it will quit on your Mac Pro(2,1), mark the \"bad\" tape as Missing from the AIT Tape Backup Set per \"The Members Tab\" on page 155 of the Retrospect Mac 6 User's Guide and then Rebuild that Backup Set's Catalog with the \"good\" tapes per \"Rebuilding a Catalog\"on pages 188â€“189 of the UG. Alternatively you could try the \"Verifying Media Integrity\" operation on pages 190â€“191 of the Mac 6 UG. If it won't quit on your Mac Pro(2,1), first quit the Retrospect Engine on your Mac Pro(5,1) or uninstall itâ€”after making a Finder-copy of the files that are in Library->Application Support->Retrospect , then re-install if necessaryâ€”followed by a reverse--Finder-copy of the copied files back into Library->Application Support->Retrospectâ€”and follow the \"Verifying a Media Set\" procedure on pages 208â€“210 of the Retrospect Mac 10 User's Guideâ€”doing a Mark Lost for the \"bad\" tape. After that follow the \"Repairing a Media Set\" procedure on pages 210â€“213 of the Mac 10 UG, clicking the Add Member button for each of the \"good\" tapesâ€”this may not work unless you click Add Member twice to skip over the \"bad\" tape.\n\nThis 2012 OP of yours raises a new set of questions because it says \"I have this old Exabyte Mammoth LT drive\", and the Exabyte Mammoth LT has only SCSI connectors. Yet this very recent post of yours says \"I just brought the AIT drive home and it connects via firewire cable\". This later 2012 OP of yours says \"Retrospect v6.1 on one partition with Leopard running which will be mostly used for a SONY AIT-2 (firewire interface) and an older Exabyte Mammoth LT drive (SCSI 1 interface via ATTO UL5D card).\" Does that mean the \"bad\" tape was written on a different AIT tape drive from the drive on your Mac Pro(5,1) which had trouble reading it? And this CNet page says the interface on the Sony AIT e200-UL is FireWire 400, which meansâ€”I also have a Mac Pro (5,1)â€”that you must be using a FireWire-400-to-800 adapter. Hmmm! ðŸ¤”\n\nHi,\n\nSo sorry for all the confusion! I DO appreciate all the help and would hate to stir up any bad feelings. ðŸ™‚ I have multiple parallel challenges I'm facing and it's hard for me sometimes to organise it myself.\n\nIn regards to this thread to which I'm replying, I'm having an issue with the first AIT-2 tape of a 3-tape Media Set (Media Set was created using Retrospect 6). The system that was running the rebuild at the time of the \"replace media\" problem consists of a 5,1 Mac Pro High Sierra. The only tape drive connected is an AIT-2 via firewire. The version of Retrospect is v10.5. (An extra challenge I'm having with this machine is that I cannot get the Retrospect Engine to quit, but I won't get into that now). So after the above mentioned AIT-2 tape encountered some error at the end of the catalog rebuild, I was able to STOP the Retrospect process and it saved the contents of that first tape as a Media Set catalog. I don't find any snapshots but I can search for files and folders. What would be very nice is if I can continue rebuilding that catalog starting from the second tape but keep the contents of the first tape in the catalog.\n\nHere is where it starts to get confusing:\n\nSitting next to my 5,1 Mac Pro is my 2,1 Mac Pro . It has an ATTO SCSI PCI card connected to it and hanging off the card is an Exabyte tape drive. The Macpro 2,1 is running Retrospect v6.1. There are times when I also connect the AIT-2 drive to this 2,1 Macpro in order to recatalog any AIT tapes that were created with earlier versions of Retrospect (v4 and v5), which the 5,1 Macpro setup won't read (v10.5 reads v6 but nothing earlier). The 2,1 macpro runs v6.1 and it quits just fine.\n\nSo, back to the original problem of this thread, is there a clear best choice of paths to take to both recatalog and copy the data off the \"bad\" tape? I understand the different scenarios you mentioned above, I'm just hoping I might get a little guidance as to what to try first, now that you hopefully have a clearer picture.\n\nIn regards to older posts about an old Leopard running Mac, I have always used the same drive, or same drive model (I usually keep a spare for when one goes down.). I've never had any problems with reading or writing with the AIT drives and all the data I've retrieved is very well preserved and not much fuss, BUT I have had those drives do some nasty things to the tapes themselves (cut/crunch/twist). Interestingly, my Exabyte tapes are nearly flawless, both mechanically and data integrity wise.\n\nI'm really sorry if I'm not as clear as you'd like, I use a lot of time writing these posts, as I I'm sure you do as well, and I apologise if I seem unappreciative. I'm very happy to get help.\n\nThank you.\n\noslomike,\n\nWas the Tape Backup Set that contains the \"bad\" tape originally written with the Exabyte drive? I'm guessing that this may be so if the Backup Set was created by v4 or v5; the timeline of Retrospect Mac releases at the bottom of this Retrospect History article versus the Wikipedia timeline for the release of AIT-2 seems to show that a Backup Set written up through 1999 couldn't have been written on your AIT-2 drive.\n\nTherefore, if you still have it lying around, I suggest you try re-reading the tapes in that Backup Set using your old Exabyte drive. I'm not an expert, but differences in mechanical skew between drives can make tapes written on one drive hard to read on anotherâ€”especially for special characters such as end-of-tape markers.\n\nLet me tell you a tape story: In 1969 I was working as a programmer at ITT Data Services in Paramus NJ, and my boss asked me to write a program to read \"gapless\" tapes on the IBM S/360 DOS computer at our satellite Lakehurst office and copy them to ordinary \"gapped\" tapes. The \"gapless\" tapes were being written by the U.S. Navy's Lakehurst Naval Air Station (that's where the Hindenburg dirigible caught fire in 1937), using a tape drive attached to a radio-telemetry receiver that had no ability to store received data while an inter-block gap was being written. LNAS could read these \"gapless\" tapes using a Control Data minicomputer connected to a special tape drive that could somehow \"stop in less than 2 inches and navigate backwards to before the stop\", but the minicomputer had such a pitifully-small main memory (4K 12-bit words) that the LNAS engineers (testing top-secret aircraft; don't ask ðŸ™„ ) couldn't do any real analysis on it. The engineers wanted ITT to copy such tapes onto \"gapped\" ones that could be read by an ordinary tape drive on one of ITT's 512KB OS/360 IBM mainframe computers in Paramus. I wrote a tricky copy program in S/360 DOS Assembler, and it worked successfully on a test tape. However it turned out that the LNAS tape drive attached to the radio-telemetry receiver had a skewed read-write head, and the Control Data minicomputer's tape drive read-write head had been skewed to match. ITT wasn't willing to skew one of its satellite-office IBM tape drives to match, so my program never got used in production. See an audio expert for an explanation of tape skew.\n\nEdited January 14, 2021 by DavidHertzberg\n\nUnderlines and link in last two sentences of final paragraph, making it clear that the tape drives with skewed read-write heads were _not_ the IBM-standard model that ITT Data Services owned/rentedâ€”but were LNAS-owned models from _other_ manufacturers.\n\n12 hours ago, oslomike said:\n\nYou're correct about my old backups...\n\nSorry, I didn't make my point very well (or, indeed, at all!).\n\nWe often use \"backup\" and \"archive\" interchangeably, but you may find it helpful to consider them as two different things -- \"backup\" for recovery (disk failure, wrongly deleted files, reverting to a previous version), \"archive\" for long-term storage of data you want to keep. In many ways this is a false dichotomy -- you may need to keep your backups long-term (eg compliance) and you can restore files from your archive -- but it can help from a management POV to keep the two separate.\n\nOf course, being a belt-and-braces type guy, I'd then archive my backups and make sure my archive was backed up ðŸ™‚ More copies are good!\n\nIt's really a data management/business rules thing. It helps us because we tend to work on projects (or by person) so when the project is finished (or the person leaves) all associated data can be archived, keeping it in a single place while also freeing up resources on the \"live\" systems. YMMV.\n\nIt doesn't really matter whether you use DAS, NAS, a bunch of drives in a cupboard that you plug in when needed -- whatever works for you! NAS is more expensive per TB than comparable DAS because you are paying for the computer that \"runs\" it as well as the storage, but because it is a complete \"system\" you can take advantage of in-built scheduled disk-scrubbing etc rather than having to roll your own health checks on DAS. But if your RAID is a SAN it probably has those already -- in many ways, a NAS is just a poor man's SAN ðŸ˜‰\n\nBut the best system is the one that works for you. Managing data is a necessity but, after a certain point, can cost more than it's worth to your business.

In my case, an archive has been the priority. I have three media sets that are rotated three times a week. What I'm discovering is that we could probably benefit from having a RS Disk Media set that backups everything on the SAN RAID that's less than 18/24 months old. I guess this is something RS can do, yes? Is that what you mean by scrubbing? Is that also what Retrospect calls grooming? I'll look into it.\n\nAs far as if I REALLY need to keep old archives and every snapshot. I would need it only very seldom, but when I do need it it's a life saver. I will probably end up making v6.1 File Sets of all my old v4-v6 Media sets just so I can get the data off the old tapes that are getting increasingly problematic, and then back up all of those File Sets to the RS v17 on the LTO tapes. I don't really enjoy the IT hat I have to wear, but I'm getting better at it, especially thanks to people like yourself and others who have been very generous with what they know. I'm very grateful.\n\nThanks\n\n22 hours ago, oslomike said:\n\nWhat I'm discovering is that we could probably benefit from having a RS Disk Media set that backups everything on the SAN RAID that's less than 18/24 months old. I guess this is something RS can do, yes?... Is that also what Retrospect calls grooming?\n\nRS can do that, just by using filters on what is backed up. Grooming is the step after that where you then remove things from your backup set so it doesn't keep growing and growing. Personally I've never used grooming and, instead, start new backup sets every year -- I do that from scratch with a new full backup of every client, but you could do it by transferring the last backups from \"Old Set\" to \"New Set\" and continuing with incrementals to \"New Set\". The previous year's backups are \"archived\" by putting the tapes into secure storage.\n\n22 hours ago, oslomike said:\n\nIs that what you mean by scrubbing?\n\nNo, I mean automated scheduled checks of your NAS/SAN's integrity -- eg parity checking. Your SAN can probably do that, but if you just had a bunch of external drives you'd have to do it yourself (or rely on SMART warnings, by which time it might be too late).\n\n22 hours ago, oslomike said:\n\nI see that I didn't really understand the difference between backup and archive.\n\nIf it was me, I'd keep the SAN only for \"live\" data -- a good, performant, SAN is an expensive way of storing old data that you only need occasional (if any) access to. I'd get a slower, cheaper, NAS and move that old data to there from the SAN -- that NAS would now be my archive. How/when that happened would be a \"business rules\" decision -- for example, if you worked by project you might archive the whole project when the final invoice was issued (on the theory that work stops at that point so the data is \"fixed\"), or if work was less structured you might archive anything that hasn't been accessed in the last 12 months. Or you may not bother at all -- it may be better to pay for extra SAN storage than to waste your (chargeable!) time on such things ðŸ˜‰\n\nThere are many ways to skin this particular cat, so start with what you want to achieve, figure out the resources available to you, and go from there."
