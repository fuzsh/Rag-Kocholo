        "text": "Copycat\n\nUtility enables you to convert from one tape medium or format to another. Automated data set copy methods expedite the conversion process and significantly reduce the resource requirements demanded by manual conversions using JCL.\n\nCopycat\n\nUtility permits you to consolidate active data sets from multiple tape volumes onto fewer volumes, resulting in a larger scratch pool. By using\n\nEarl\n\n, the standard report writer, you can identify the control information that\n\nCopycat\n\nUtility needs to effectively improve the utilization of the entire tape library.\n\nCopycat\n\nUtility facilitates the migration to virtual tape systems by copying physical media to virtual media. If you want the virtual tape system to handle the file stacking, you can unstack the previously stacked tapes into the virtual system. The virtual system would then assign a unique volume to each file copied.\n\nCopycat\n\nUtility provides facilities to retrieve data from old or faulty media with the functionality to copy a tape volume, in its entirety, to a new replacement volume. Volume labels can be included in the copy function, if desired.\n\nCopycat\n\nUtility allows you to copy volumes or data sets onto other tapes without requiring the cataloging of the backup volume. The backup volume, as any other\n\nCA 1\n\nor\n\nTLMS\n\ncontrolled volume, is recorded in the TMC or VMF for tracking and management purposes. If required, a new high-level data set name qualifier can be specified for all files on the backup volume.\n\nCopycat\n\nUtility reduces the overhead of vaulting tapes to off-site locations. By copying volumes or data sets to devices or tape volume pools at specific off-site locations, the data center minimizes the tasks of pulling the vaulting list, packaging the tapes and transporting them.\n\nCopycat\n\nUtility can also be used to copy all files from a foreign tape onto a\n\nCA 1\n\nor\n\nTLMS\n\ncontrolled volume. This can be used to copy from an old physical tape that is not defined to your Tape Management System onto a new physical or virtual volume defined to your Tape Management System.\n\nCopycat\n\nUtility allows you to map a tape volume to help verify its contents. Detailed information is provided for each file residing on the tape volume.\n\nCopycat\n\nUtility furnishes tape copy and file copy functions that are compatible with\n\nCA 1\n\nand\n\nTLMS\n\noperations. Major functions allow you to perform the following:"
