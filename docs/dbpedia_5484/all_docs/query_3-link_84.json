        "text": "What are pubic lice?\n\nPubic lice (also known as crabs or pthirus pubis) are tiny insects that live in coarse body hair, including:\n\npubic hair\n\narmpit hair\n\nbeards\n\nchest hair\n\neyelashes\n\neyebrows\n\nThey do not live on the scalp.\n\nThe lice lay eggs (also known as nits) that are glued to the base of your hair, near your skin, and hatch after 7 days leaving behind empty egg sacs.\n\nAdult pubic lice are grey-coloured and smaller than head lice. They are a sexually transmitted infection (STI).\n\nHow might I catch pubic lice?\n\nPubic lice are most commonly spread through skin-to-skin sexual contact.\n\nYou can also catch pubic lice by having close, non-sexual contact with someone who has lice (e.g. kissing someone with an infested beard or moustache, sleeping in the same bed or sharing towels or clothing).\n\nPubic lice only infect humans, so you can't catch them from pets or other animals.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of pubic lice?\n\nIf you have pubic lice, you may notice:\n\nitching around your genitals or back passage (anus), especially at night, when the lice are most active\n\ntiny blue spots around your genitals\n\nspots of blood or fine, gritty debris in your underwear\n\nvisible lice or tiny eggs in your pubic hair\n\nPubic lice feed on human blood. Their saliva often irritates the skin, causing intense itching.\n\nPubic lice do not burrow under the skin.\n\nCHECK YOUR SYMPTOMS — Use the Symptom Checker and find out if you need to seek medical help.\n\nHow are pubic lice diagnosed?\n\nYour doctor can diagnose pubic lice by carefully inspecting affected areas and finding lice, eggs or empty sacs. Dark specks of louse poos or blue discolouration on your trunk or thighs can help make the diagnosis.\n\nYour doctor may apply a piece of tape to the infected area to pick up lice to examine them under a microscope.\n\nIf you are diagnosed with pubic lice, it's a good idea to also be tested for other STIs.\n\nWhen should I see my doctor?\n\nYou should visit your doctor or sexual health clinic if:\n\nyou think you might have pubic lice\n\nyou have had sexual contact with someone who has with pubic lice\n\nyou have developed a skin infection from scratching the infested area\n\nFIND A HEALTH SERVICE — The Service Finder can help you find doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and other health services.\n\nASK YOUR DOCTOR — Preparing for an appointment? Use the Question Builder for general tips on what to ask your GP or specialist.\n\nWhat is the treatment for pubic lice?\n\nPubic lice can be treated with a cream or lotions prescribed by your doctor. Depending on the severity of the infection, your doctor may advise applying the cream to the affected area only, or all over your body.\n\nYou should examine your whole body for lice or ask someone else to help you check.\n\nTreatment does not kill unhatched eggs, so you will need to repeat the treatment again 1 – 2 weeks later to treat any newly-hatched lice.\n\nIf you have pubic lice on your eyelashes, you will need a prescription for special ointment. It is usually applied twice a day for 8 days. You may need to see an ophthalmologist (eye specialist).\n\nAntihistamines can help with itchiness, which may also last a few days after treatment.\n\nYou do not need to shave your pubic hair or remove eggs.\n\nIn addition to treating pubic lice with a cream of lotion, you should:\n\nInform any sexual contacts from within the last month, so they can be checked and treated.\n\nAvoid sexual contact for 7 days after treatment or until your symptoms have gone away, whichever is later.\n\nThoroughly launder all your bedlinens and underwear on a hot cycle (60℃) and then dry them all in the dryer. If you have some items that cannot be washed, you can dry clean them or put them in a sealed plastic bag for 14 days so any lice present will die.\n\nCurrent sexual partners and household members should be treated at the same time as you.\n\nHow can the spread of pubic lice be prevented?\n\nHere's how you can reduce the risk of spreading pubic lice:\n\nDo not share your bedding, towels or clothing until you have finished your treatment.\n\nAvoid sexual contact until treatment has worked and you are clear of lice.\n\nEnsure that your sexual partner(s) have been informed and treated, otherwise they may re-infest you or infest others.\n\nIt is important to remember that condoms do not provide protection against pubic lice.\n\nPubic lice can only survive less than 24 hours if they are not on a human, so it's not necessary to treat carpets or spray insecticide in a room.\n\nCan pubic lice spread infectious diseases?\n\nPubic lice are not known to transmit any infectious diseases, but persistent scratching can cause a secondary skin infection.\n\nResources and support"
