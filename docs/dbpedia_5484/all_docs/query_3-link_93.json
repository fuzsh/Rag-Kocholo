        "text": "Washington D.C. — House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) delivered the following opening remarks at today’s Full Committee Business Meeting to approve the transfer of the official classified transcript from the March 7, 2024, executive session titled “Legislation to Protect American Data and National Security from Foreign Adversaries” to the Department of Justice (DOJ) in accordance with House Rules. “Good morning and welcome to today’s Committee business meeting. “The action we are taking is significant to preserving this Committee’s hard work to protect the American people and our national security.” THE THREAT POSED BY THE CCP “Foreign adversaries, like the Chinese Communist Party, pose the greatest national security threat of our time. “Our adversaries are actively working to undermine America’s global leadership. “It has been a bipartisan priority for this Congress and this Committee to take action to counter that threat. “The Energy and Commerce Committee led on the most significant effort to date to do that, passing H.R. 7521, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act , which has been signed into law. “Our efforts began on March 23, 2023, when the Committee held a hearing with the CEO of TikTok—his first appearance before Congress—to understand the risks posed by this CCP-controlled app. “That hearing further confirmed our greatest fears—that the CCP is weaponizing applications, like TikTok, against the American people. “Nearly a year later, on March 7, 2024, the Committee held a legislative hearing titled 'Legislation to Protect American Data and National Security from Foreign Adversaries.' “At that hearing, we heard from the intelligence community about the dangers posed by applications, like TikTok, that are controlled by foreign adversaries who are determined to exploit and weaponize Americans’ data and the importance of Congress taking action to defend the American people against this threat. “H.R 7521 gave TikTok a simple choice: divest from your parent company, which is beholden to the Chinese Communist Party, and remain operational in the United States or side with the CCP and face a ban. “Since then, the CCP has made it clear that it has no intention of giving up control over applications, like TikTok, further solidifying that the CCP is using these applications in nefarious ways against the American people.” TAKING ACTION TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE “Rather than divest, TikTok has filed suit against the United States to try and undermine the law this Committee passed. “I am confident this legislation will withstand legal scrutiny. “In June, this Committee received a formal request from the DOJ to receive a copy of the executive session transcript from our March 2024 hearing to assist in their litigation. “According to rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee must vote to release evidence or testimony taken in executive session. “We will vote to do that this morning and in doing so, will continue our efforts to protect the American people from foreign adversaries. “Companies controlled by a foreign adversary, like the CCP, will never embrace American values, virtues of our society and culture like freedom of speech, human rights, the rule of law, a free press, and others. “Our adversaries choose to rule through fear and control. “If given the choice, they will always choose the path for more control, more surveillance, and more manipulation. “This foreign interference and manipulation is not welcome here and we will do whatever it takes to stop it.”\n\nWashington, D.C. — House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) today announced a Full Committee markup of 11 bills this Thursday, June 27. “The Energy and Commerce Committee is continuing to deliver solutions for the American people.

I know he’s hit the ground running on our committee and has a bill on the agenda today. I’m thankful for his contributions.” SUPPORTING MOTHERS AND CHILDREN “A number of bills today continue the important work of the committee to support moms and children. “For example, the Accelerating Kids Access to Care Act will make it easier for children enrolled in Medicaid to get the important specialty care they need. “Dr. Miller Meeks has been a leader on this legislation, and we heard testimony from Iowa Children’s Hospital of the needless and detrimental delays in care due to red tape. “This bill is even more important now with exciting innovation in cell and gene therapies that could cure children with sickle cell and other rare diseases, but potentially require children to travel across the country. “Next is the SHINE for Autumn Act, which passed this committee and the House floor overwhelmingly last Congress. “This is the second piece of legislation we’ve moved to help prevent the heartbreaking tragedy of still birth. “I want to share a special thanks to Debbie Haine, who is in the audience today, for her steadfast support and dedication to raising awareness on stillbirths for over a decade. “This bill is named after her daughter Autumn Joy, who was born still on July 8, 2011. We are honored to remember Autumm today and thank Debbie for her tireless advocacy. “In addition, my friend, Representative Chris Smith, has for decades led the effort for more research into autism, and the best ways to support the entire population of individuals with autism and their families. “The latest reauthorization of the Autism CARES Act, which I am proud to support today, continues important HHS wide programs to further those goals. “We will also move Representative Obernolte’s HOLD Act forward, to further support living organ donors who give the miraculous gift of life to patients in need. “And while not included on today's agenda, reauthorizing the pediatric rare disease priority review voucher program at FDA ahead of its September 30th expiration remains a top priority. “Patients with rare diseases and their families continue to push for action, and by continuing to work together, we can pass it out of this committee with broad bipartisan support.” IMPROVING MEDICAID PROGRAM INTEGRITY “We are also voting on four bills to improve program integrity in Medicaid. “Bills from Representatives Bilirakis, Miller-Meeks, D’Esposito, and Garcia will all reduce the rate of improper payments by ensuring that only current, living beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicaid and only legitimate providers participate in the program. “Bills that require timely disenrolling of deceased beneficiaries from Medicaid may seem obvious, but the Office of the Inspector General continues to find it is an issue. “I’m glad these members have prioritized being good stewards of Medicaid funds.” STRENGTHENING TELEHEALTH & SENIOR ACCESS TO CARE “And finally, I want to highlight the work the Committee continues to do to help seniors access health care. “This committee led on site neutral reforms as part of the Lower Cost, More Transparency Act to make sure that seniors paid the same out of their own pocket for drug administration, regardless of whether it was administered in a hospital or at a doctor’s office. “During COVID-19, seniors were able to get specialty medications directly from their oncologist, but that is no longer the case. “Ms. Harshbarger's legislation will re-establish this option for seniors for another five years. “And we will continue work to improve access to telehealth in Medicare. “Mr. James’s legislation will ensure program integrity measures are in place so we can more effectively see how telehealth is working for patients on Medicare. “Ms. Steele’s legislation will make telehealth more accessible for patients with limited English proficiency. “I'll note that Members and our staff continue to work on a fully paid for package to extend telehealth flexibilities for seniors and include additional priorities on diabetic and cardiac care. “I am optimistic we will be able to move that package before the August recess and well before those authorities expire at the end of the year. “I want to thank all of the members for their hard work on these bills and taking the time necessary to get the policy right and move policies in a fiscally responsible way. “All the legislation today that increases spending in Medicare or Medicaid is offset with reductions in Medicare or Medicaid spending. “I am proud of all that we have, and continue, to accomplish working together.”\n\nWashington, D.C. — House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) today announced a full committee markup this week of 13 Health bills. “This week, the Energy and Commerce Committee will continue advancing smart, bipartisan policies that deliver solutions for the American people. The legislation we will consider builds upon the successes this Committee has led on this Congress to increase access to care, address waste, fraud, and abuse, and help make care more affordable,” said Chair Rodgers. “I thank all of the Members on both sides of the aisle for their hard work and leadership on these bills, and I look forward to advancing them to the full House later this week.” WHAT: A Full Committee markup of 13 bills.

The ability to express our individual identity helps define who we are and deepen ties to our families and our communities. “Encouraging individualism and identity is something that’s uniquely American, something the founders envisioned and fought for—a society that’s fiercely individual, where people are free to think, speak, and live their lives the way they want. “Many believed that the internet could empower the individual even more by creating new ways for people and businesses to connect, innovate, and share information. “Unfortunately, trust has been broken. “Instead, over time our identity has been slowly eroded our identity, freedom to think for ourselves manipulated, and Big Tech is capturing more and more data to surveil and control over our lives. “Americans should be in control of how that information is disclosed, and it should be voluntary, not coerced. “If the founders were here today, they would know, as we know, that this digital tyranny is not the American Dream.” AMERICAN PRIVACY RIGHTS ACT “The American Privacy Rights Act is an opportunity for a reset, one that can help return us to the American Dream our Founders envisioned. “It gives people the right to control their personal information online, something the American people overwhelmingly want. They’re tired of having their personal information abused for profit. “Right now, a person’s location, for instance, can be shared without their knowledge or permission by apps on their phone. “This bill stops those apps from sharing or selling this data without permission. “If a person searches the internet about something personal or something they want kept private that information could be tracked with hidden pixels and shared without them knowing about it. “This bill keeps people's search history private. “If someone buys a pair of shoes online, they almost instantly are bombarded with ads across the platforms they use. “The American Privacy Rights Act gives the power back to the people by equipping them with the knowledge of how their data is being used to monetize, manipulate, and exploit them.” PROTECTING KIDS ONLINE “This legislation is so important, and it is especially foundational for protecting kids online. “The average American teenager spends 4.8 hours a day scrolling social media platforms. “I’m a mom. I have three young kids. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. It’s my biggest fear: what’s going to happen online with my kids, because I don’t trust what’s happening at all. “As our kids scroll, companies collect nearly every data point imaginable to build profiles on them and keep them addicted. “They intentionally target children with dangerous and life-threatening content. “At our hearing last month, we heard from a young woman, Ava, who shared how Big Tech weaponized her data, collecting this arsenal of data and exploited her vulnerabilities. “Ava’s story is just one of countless we’ve heard from kids, young adults, and families across the country. “This legislation gets to the root cause of these problems by minimizing the collection and exploitation of our data. “It serves as a strong foundation from which to layer on other important policies to protect kids online, like the Kids Online Safety Act, which I’m excited we’re also considering today. “This draft includes key provisions from the Children Online Privacy Protection Act. “I’d like to thank Reps. Walberg, Castor, and Senators Markey and Cassidy, for working with us.” HELPING SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS THRIVE “We can achieve stronger protections for people while also continuing to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship. “18 states now have comprehensive data privacy laws, which means 18 different sets of rules that growing small businesses and startups are forced to navigate. “Ensuring compliance is costly. “Just last week, I had a company tell me they may be forced to pull out of certain states because they simply cannot comply with these conflicting standards. “Our bill would end this patchwork. “Today, we’ll also be marking up H.R. 8449, the A.M. Radio for Every Vehicle Act, led by Reps. Bilirakis and Pallone. “Millions across the country rely on AM radio for critical information, especially during public emergencies. “It’s vital we preserve this resource for Americans. “In the nearly 230-year history of this Committee, we have established a rich tradition of taking on the hard problems and delivering solutions for the people. “We have a moment to change the status quo and reset what our online ecosystem looks like. “The American Privacy Rights Act is a common sense, bipartisan, bicameral proposal. “I’m grateful for Senator Cantwell for working with me on this landmark legislation, as well as Ranking Member Pallone, who has been a trusted partner over the years as we have worked together on privacy and worked to improve this current draft. “As John Dingell has been known to say, there hasn’t been a perfect law since Moses came down from the mountain. “I urge my colleagues to advance the legislation today and I look forward to continuing working with all members and stakeholders to further perfect it before the full committee markup.”\n\nWashington, D.C. — House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Innovation, Data, and Commerce Chair Gus Bilirakis (R-FL) delivered the following opening remarks at today’s subcommittee markup of three bills: As prepared for delivery: “Good morning, and welcome to today’s Subcommittee markup where we will consider three significant Subcommittee priority pieces of legislation to protect Americans’ data privacy rights, protect kids online, and preserve access to AM radio. “I want to thank all the Subcommittee members for their input and feedback on these topics, and I am looking forward to continuing productive conversations in a bipartisan manner to refine these bills as we move through the legislative process. “We have a historic opportunity to advance legislation that will end the patchwork and finally provide a federal standard to govern how Americans’ personal information is collected, stored, retained, and transferred. “The American Privacy Rights Act is the strongest consumer data privacy and security framework to date—it provides businesses with certainty through a national preemptive standard, secures individual liberties through strong data minimization provisions, and cements America’s global leadership through data security provisions that warn consumers when their information is being collected and shared with our foreign adversaries, like China and Russia.“ YEARS OF CONGRESSIONAL EFFORT “For years, Congress has long tried to thread the needle when it comes to getting a national data privacy bill enacted into law, given the many differences in approach from both sides of the political spectrum. “I want to applaud Chair Rodgers and Chair Cantwell for their tireless efforts to move forward with a framework that strikes this critical balance, as well as all the members on both sides of the aisle that have provisions included in the draft before us today. “I understand many stakeholders have continued to engage with every office on their requests, and I look forward to hearing from my colleagues about how we can continue to incorporate that feedback. “I’m thankful for all the constructive comments we’ve received up to this point. “This is certainly not the last opportunity to deliberate and refine this draft further. “But time is of the essence, so let’s continue to move this process forward to protect Americans privacy rights, promote individual freedoms and civil liberties, and secure data from abuse by bad actors.” KOSA “In addition to APRA, I’m proud that we are also considering my bill, H.R. 7891, the Kids Online Safety Act. “I’m thankful to Rep. Castor for her partnership on this effort, as well as the many colleagues on this Subcommittee who’ve cosponsored our legislation. Sadly, in the face of an unprecedented youth mental health crisis in this nation, Big Tech has continued to turn a blind eye to harms perpetuated on their online platforms. “Congress has been forced to step in to ensure children and parents have the safeguards, tools, and transparency measures they need to stay safe. “KOSA requires the prevention and mitigation of harms to minors, such as the promotion of suicide, depression, substance abuse, sexual exploitation, and illegal drug sales such as fentanyl. “Too often we’ve seen the design features of social media fuel these problems, rather than prevent them. “This legislation is not perfect, and I’m hopeful conversations today can illuminate how we can better establish needed protections for children.” PRESERVING AM RADIO “Lastly, the Subcommittee will be taking a bipartisan bill I’m leading with Ranking Member Pallone, the AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act . “At our legislative hearing, we heard from our witnesses about the importance of having a robust emergency alert and public safety communications infrastructure. “Further, rural and underserved Americans still enjoy listening to AM radio broadcasts for their diverse viewpoints. “Given AM radio’s significant reach as a medium, much of it taking place in vehicles, we must ensure it remains a readily available option for all Americans, particularly as we approach hurricane season. “I’m proud to partner with Ranking Member Pallone on this initiative and look forward to advancing it through Subcommittee today. “In closing, I look forward to working with all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle today to get these critical bills across the finish line.\"\n\nWashington D.C. — House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health Chair Brett Guthrie (R-KY) delivered the following opening remarks at today’s markup of 23 legislative proposals to extend Americans’ access to telehealth services, strengthen and preserve Medicaid, and encourage innovation to help children with rare diseases. “Over the past several weeks, the Health Subcommittee has led the way bringing forward solutions to address some of the biggest challenges facing patients and our health care system. “Today we’re continuing that effort by advancing critical legislation that will help patients access life-saving cures, enable seniors to continue receiving care from the comfort of their homes, strengthen the Medicaid program for vulnerable patients, and support our workforce so that every American can get the care that they need. “We now have FDA approved therapies that in many instances are the only treatments available for rare disease patients and their families. “Part of the reason for the rapid development of these therapies is because of the congressionally established Pediatric Rare Disease Priority Review Voucher program in 2012. “Over 50 vouchers have been awarded as a result of this program, 39 for pediatric rare diseases and over half of which have been awarded over the past five years. “That’s why I am glad we’re considering legislation which would continue life-saving access to therapies for kids living with rare diseases who currently lack access to any treatments. “I would like to thank Representative Bilirakis for his leadership on this legislation and encourage my colleagues to support advancing the bill to the full committee today.” CONTINUING TELEHEALTH SERVICES FOR MEDICAID RECIPIENTS “The acceleration of telehealth has also transformed our health care system, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic. “Over 30 million seniors on Medicare utilized telehealth services throughout the first few months of the pandemic, giving beneficiaries the chance to have routine health care visits from the comfort of their homes. “Congress extended these flexibilities beyond the Public Health Emergency, but they are set to expire at the end of this year. “I would like to thank Representative Carter for his steadfast leadership on H.R. 7623, The Telehealth Modernization Act of 2024. “This legislation serves as an important guidepost to the work we’re doing today. “This policy extends the current telehealth flexibilities in our committee’s jurisdiction for an additional two years and includes other reforms. “While we have seen a number of positive developments in health over the past decade, not everything has been positive. “We have seen an explosion in the rate of improper payments in the Medicaid program, reaching $50 billion in improper payments in 2022 alone.” STEPS TO ADDRESS STATE MEDICAID PROGRAM INTEGRITY “The Energy and Commerce Committee has done extensive work over the past several years to address these challenges, most recently considering a number of legislative solutions to stabilize the program. “Among these ideas, we will be considering four bills that take steps to addressing key program integrity issues facing the Medicaid programs, such as increasing the frequency that State Medicaid programs check to make sure that they are not paying for deceased beneficiaries and requiring regular updates of address information for beneficiaries so that we don’t pay for care for people who live out of state. “I would like to thank Representatives Bilirakis, D’Esposito, Garcia, and Miller-Meeks for leading these bills and encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.” IMPROVING CARE FOR OUR SENIORS AND PATIENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY “Last, but certainly not least, we will be considering legislation to support our workforce and improve access to care for Americans across the country. “This includes the Accelerating Kids Access to Care Act, which will cut red tape for pediatricians, and my bill, H.R. 468, the Building America’s Healthcare Workforce Act, which will help build a more robust workforce pipeline for our nation’s nursing homes. “Both bills come at a critical moment for our country. “Our health care system is facing stark workforce shortages that existed before the pandemic but have only grown more severe in recent years. “Since 2020, over 500 nursing homes have closed across the United States and another 150,000 nurses are needed to reach pre-pandemic staffing levels. “In closing, I would like to thank my colleagues for bringing forth the solutions we’re advancing today. “Patients, providers, and taxpayers will all greatly benefit from the important bipartisan work we are doing today.”"
