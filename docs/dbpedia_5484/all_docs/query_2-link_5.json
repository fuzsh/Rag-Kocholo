        "text": "2.2: Secondary Storage\n\nExam Board:\n\nOCR\n\nSpecification:\n\nJ277\n\nSecondary storage is non-volatile storage used to save and store data that can be accessed repeatedly.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nSecondary storage is not directly embedded on the motherboard (and possibly even external) and therefore further away from the CPU so it is slower to access then primary storage.\n\nStorage Characteristics you should know:\n\n​\n\nCAPACITY: The maximum amount of data that can be stored on the device.\n\nDURABILITY: The strength of the device, to last without breaking.\n\nPORTABILITY: How easy it is to carry the device around.\n\nACCESS SPEED: How quickly data on the device can be read or edited.\n\nCOST: The average price it costs to purchase the storage device.\n\n​\n\nRELIABILITY: The likelihood of the device continuing to perform well over time.\n\nMagnetic Storage\n\nA magnetic hard disk drive (HDD) is the most common form of secondary storage within desktop computers. A read/write head moves nanometres above the disk platter and uses the magnetic field of the platter to read or edit data.\n\nAn obsolete (no longer used) type of magnetic storage is a floppy disk but these have been replaced by solid state devices such as USB sticks which are much faster and have a much higher capacity.\n\nAnother type of magnetic storage that is still used is magnetic tape. Magnetic tape has a high storage capacity but data has to be accessed in order (serial access) so it is generally only used by companies to back up or archive large amounts of data.\n\nMagnetic Storage Characteristics (Hard Disk Drive):\n\n​\n\n✓-Large CAPACITY and cheaper COSTper gigabyte than solid state.\n\n​\n\n✓ - Modern external HDDs are small and well protected so they are DURABLEand PORTABLE, however because of the moving parts, they should not be moved when powered on because it can damage the device.\n\n​\n\nX-Slower ACCESS SPEED than solid state but faster than optical storage.​\n\nOptical Storage\n\nOptical storage uses a laser to project beams of light onto a spinning disc, allowing it to read data from a CD, DVD or Blu-Ray.\n\n​\n\nThis makes optical storage the slowest of the four types of secondary storage.\n\n​\n\nDisc drives are traditionally internal but external disc drives can be bought for devices like laptops.\n\n​\n\nMagnetic Disks are spelled with a k and Optical Discs have a c.\n\nOptical Storage Characteristics:\n\n​\n\nX - Low CAPACITY: 700 MB (CD), 4.7 GB (DVD), 25 GB (Blu-ray).\n\nX - Not DURABLEbecause discs are very fragile and can break or scratch easily.\n\n✓ - Discs are thin and very PORTABLE. Also very cheap to buy in bulk.\n\n​\n\nX - Optical discs have the Slowest ACCESS SPEED.\n\nSolid State Storage\n\nThere are no moving parts in solid state storage.\n\nSSDs (Solid State Drives) are replacing magnetic HDDs (Hard DIsk Drives) in modern computers and video game consoles because they are generally quieter, faster and use less power.\n\n​\n\nA USB flash drive (USB stick) is another type of solid state storage that is used to transport files easily because of its small size.\n\n​\n\nMemory cards, like the SD card in a digital camera or a Micro SD card in a smartphone, are another example of solid state storage.\n\nQuesto's Questions"
