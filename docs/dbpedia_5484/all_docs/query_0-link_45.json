        "text": "Desktop computers\n\nDesktop workstations are still the best computer choice in a production environment. They are the most powerful, modular, expandable and upgradeable processing machines available. Although laptop computers can be attached to external drives and high quality monitors, they still do not have the ultimate processing power or support as much RAM or internal hard drive space.\n\nDesktop computers come in two basic configurations: tower systems and all-in-one systems. ￼\n\nFigure 1 A traditional tower system consists of a computer and a separate monitor. It may also include external storage devices.\n\nTower systems\n\nThe traditional configuration for a desktop computer is a tower with a separate monitor, as shown in Figure 1. They offer several advantages over a laptop or all-in-one that might have a similar processor speed.\n\nThese machines offer greater flexibility in upgrading individual components.\n\nThey can offer a lot more processor cores than the other machines.\n\nThey generally allow for more RAM to be installed.\n\nThey also let you choose monitors based on your specific needs.\n\nThey typically have room for multiple hard drives, and offer fast internal connections.\n\nThey offer the ability to add expansion cards. The most common expansion upgrades are GPU cards and additional storage connectivity.\n\nAll-In-one systems\n\nThis class of computers presents some real advantages in exchange for some trade-offs of expandability. Here are some of the benefits:\n\nThey offer a compact form factor.\n\nThey are typically less expensive than a comparable tower system.\n\nThey may support generous RAM installation.\n\nThey may offer very fast multi-core processors.\n\nThere are also some real drawbacks to some of these systems for some users.\n\nThey probably do not support upgrade of video card or processor.\n\nThe RAM capacity generally won’t be quite as large as in towers.\n\nYou may not like the built-in monitor.\n\nThere will be fewer connections available for hard drives. ￼\n\nFigure 2 An all-in-one system might look very appealing, but it may have some drawbacks, such as the more limited RAM capacity and the probable inability to support video card or processor upgrades.\n\nCheck the specifications of these machines when you purchase. Apple, for instance, has made a major commitment to these computers and produces some with few practical limitations other than lack of modular video card, and some limitations on drive connections.\n\nLaptop computers\n\nLaptop computers are increasingly powerful and modular and have the advantage of being portable. If a laptop is connected to a high quality monitor and external hard drives, they can come very close to the performance of a desktop machine. The Achilles heel of the laptop has been its screen quality. Laptop screens can be calibrated and profiled, but until recently, they had a much smaller gamut than stand-alone high quality graphics monitors. The newest LED backlit laptop screens have made great strides in closing this gap.\n\nThe four most important factors to look at when choosing a laptop are processor speed, total memory (RAM) capacity, the graphics processing unit (GPU), and external data connection options.\n\nAdding a second hard drive\n\nSome PC laptop computers are sold with multiple hard drives. In the MacBook Pro line it’s possible to replace the optical disc drive with a second hard drive for additional storage. If you can install two drives inside your laptop, you should consider if one of those should be a Solid State Drive (SSD).\n\nAdding a Solid State Drive\n\nThe use of a Solid State Drive can speed up image editing tasks by improving the performance and access of video files. Many choose to use the SSD to hold only their Lightroom or Aperture catalogs and leave the other drive to hold system applications.\n\nTwo systems – location and studio\n\nIf budget permits, the best combination for photography is to have two computers, a laptop and a desktop. The laptop can become an essential tool for location work. You can download and process while on location. This can be particularly valuable to check for critical focus and other issues of image quality. Once back at the studio, a more robust desktop can be used for other post-production tasks, and as your main photo archive.\n\nIf you are forced to have only one computer, consider whether performance or portability is the most important factor in your decision. The systems are easier to upgrade for performance and will have a longer useful life than a laptop."
