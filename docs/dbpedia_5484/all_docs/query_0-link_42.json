        "text": "Cataloging tapes is required for tapes that contain some data but are not registered in the Veeam database. For example, cataloging is required for tapes that were written on another Veeam backup server. After the cataloging procedure, you can restore data from the tapes.\n\nWhen a catalog job is performed, VeeamÂ BackupÂ &Â Replication first performs tape inventory, reads the information about backup contents on tape from the tape catalog information, scans tape contents and updates the database with details of new detected backup sets.\n\nYou can perform tape catalog job for a whole tape library or for selected tapes.\n\nCataloging Tape Libraries\n\nTo catalog a whole tape library:\n\nOpen the Tape Infrastructure view.\n\nExpand the Libraries node and select the library you want to catalog.\n\nClick Catalog Library on the ribbon. Alternatively, you can right-click the tape library and select Catalog library.\n\nÂ\n\nCataloging Tapes\n\nTo catalog selected tapes:\n\nOpen the Tape Infrastructure view.\n\nNavigate to the list of tapes either under the Media Pools or under the Libraries > LibraryName node > Media.\n\nSelect the necessary tapes in the list and click Catalog on the ribbon. Alternatively, you can right-click the selected tapes and choose Catalog.\n\nOnce the catalog job finishes, VeeamÂ BackupÂ &Â Replication ejects the tape to a library slot to prevent the tape from being accidentally overwritten. However, this does not apply to standalone tape drives.\n\nThe catalog log will display job session results. To access the catalog session details, you can open the History view and locate the necessary session under the Jobs > Tape node.\n\nÂ\n\nCataloging Tips\n\nRescanning of tapes during the catalog job may take a lot of time. To speed up the cataloging process, you can do one of the following:\n\nFirst, run inventory job to identify tape media sets and decide which tapes you want to catalog. Run the catalog job only against tapes in the necessary media set.\n\nIf you work with a tape library, you can run the catalog job against the whole media set at once.\n\nIf you work with a standalone drive, start cataloging from the last tape in the media set (as this tape usually stores on tape catalog information).\n\nSystem Requirements for Large Number of Files on Tape\n\nIf the tape backup contains a large quantity of files, for example, more than 1 000 000 files in 1 000 folders, you must provide the following system resources:"
