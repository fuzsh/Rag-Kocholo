        "text": "Greetings,\n\nHas anyone experienced issues with Symantec Backup Exec on the server, it runs 12.5 version, using HP Device.\n\nhere is the scoop…\n\nWhen the client, on a daily basis, the Symantec does not recognize the tape. They have 5 days worth of tapes from Monday thru Friday.\n\nI have to, every AM, go into: Tools > Backup Exec Services > Restart All Services, after this is completed, it now sees the tape.\n\nI’m wondering why, when tapes are changed tapes, it won’t see the tape automatically? It used to work before, not sure why it isn’t now.\n\nThe server has a weekly scheduled reboot.\n\nI attached screenshot of the HP tape drive, properties, in case you need the detailed info on it.\n\nAny feedback would be great.\n\nThanks\n\n@HP\n\nHave you tried cleaning the drive? There is likely a designated cleaning tape that you can pop in, watch the lights blink for a few minutes, and then it pops out. Also, have you tried turning it off and back on again? The tape drive, that is? Has something like Windows Updates updated the tape drive driver recently?\n\nIt’s more of a work around than a solution, but you could probably make a batch file to stop and then start the services using the “net stop” and “net start” commands and then put that into a daily task.\n\nI have already checked drivers and windows updates, they have the latest updates. But have not done any cleaning on that tape drive, don’t believe they do. I highly doubt tape cleaning won’t have any affects on recognizing the tape as it is basically more on services and possibly a driver glitch.\n\nWe manage everything remotely, might have to go onsite and perform an uninstall and reinstall of drivers.\n\nAlthough, I do like the idea of services scheduled to be restarted on task scheduler.\n\nI’m thinking an upgrade to 2014 would help much greatly.\n\nHrmmm…\n\nAn upgrade to 2014 would help greatly indeed! That being said, I like the idea of trying to clean the drive. I wouldn’t go out and buy a cleaning tape if you don’t already have one though. You mentioned that the latest drivers are installed, but I want to confirm that they are the Backup Exec drivers and not the Windows drivers. The BE drivers are preferred. To make sure they are up to date, download and install the latest DDI (Device Driver Installer) as well as all the latest service packs for Backup Exec 12.5.\n\nCheers,\n\nMatt\n\nCan you provide DDI drivers for me with a link? It’s currently running at the following attachment.\n\nTo be frank, I did not install this, so, I’m not sure who and how it was installed. I believe it was installed by another managed services and then we took over.\n\nI can’t tell if it is a genuine driver from Symantec or windows drivers.\n\nCan this, DDI, be installed over it or… ? I’m not keen with tape backups…\n\nThanks\n\nThat drive should be cleaned once a month at least. Cleaning it will not solve this problem however. Download the HP Tape Tools.\n\nhttp://h18006.www1.hp.com/products/storageworks/ltt/index.html\n\nYou will need to have someone insert a scratch tape (HP prefers new, but whatever). Shut down the BE services, then install HPTT and run the diagnostics. There are sensors on these drives that detect when a tape is ejected and inserted. Nine times out of ten it’s the drive.\n\nThat’s correct, but you do not have to run an inventory before a scheduled backup job. I thought of going down that road, but I think there is something wrong with that drive and might as well get to the bottom of that first. If that as all that is wrong, one could schedule an inventory 10 minutes before your backup jobs.\n\n@Matt - I applied this patch updates, seems to be working, I’ll update as soon as I see any errors that the Symantec and Tape or not communicating with each other…\n\nAs for tapes, I’m technically not a fan of using tape backups as it is very old. We have another client that has 0% issues.\n\nI’ll have to check the cleaning tool… I’m not sure enough about this inventory as stated before, I do not use tape backups, we only use NAS with RAID 5 or 6 for backups, but they wanted one tape for each day. Or for NAS, just add a USB HDD in the back of the NAS, just copy it over on a weekly scheduled, to be used as offsite, and swap weekly. I have this setup for another client, works perfect. Or better yet, swap out the USB HDD daily. I’m curious on the reliability and wear & tear of the USB port.\n\nEither way, after the patch it was able to see the tape when it was swapped out. I’ll check in tomorrow morning when the client swap tape.\n\nThanks!\n\nIf you have a valid maintenance contract, then you are entitled to upgrades during that time. If your maintenance contract has expired, then it is a paid-for upgrade. You can upgrade directly to 2014 from 2010 SP3. I also understand there is a downgrade process in place, but I am not 100% familiar with it. Your best bet is to contact your Symantec reseller for an upgrade quote. That being said, you still haven’t ruled out that this might be a hardware related issue. So a software upgrade might not fix the issue. You might want to contact HP as well to see if they have any recommendations.\n\nCheers,\n\nMatt\n\nDear HP, I thought I would tag you to this post with my issues in regards to the HP Tape Backup… I attached a screenshot for your convenience.\n\nIt may appear that installing driver patch for Symantec Exec Backup did not do the job, it doesn’t automatically recognize the tape when it is replaced. It was working fine 2 weeks ago, it has started to not automatically recognize the tape. I have to continue to restart all services for Symantec in order for it to see the tape swap.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks\n\n@HP"
