        "text": "Post by Michael Galloway\n\nPost by Flak Magnet\n\nDon't configure your jobs to USE the scratch pool. That's the root of the\n\nissue.\n\nInstead, set your job's pool to be something else OTHER than \"Scratch\", let's\n\nsay it's \"Client1_Pool\" just for example. Of course, you'll have to define\n\nthe pool to the director and reload the config before you run the job. It's\n\na good idea to test the config before you actually issue the \"reload\"\n\ncommand. Speak up if you need help with that.\n\nWhen your job \"Client1\" runs, if there are valid volumes in \"Client1_Pool\"\n\nthen bacula will use a volume in the \"Client1_Pool\".\n\nIf there is NOT a valid volume in the \"Client1_Pool\" THEN bacula will\n\nre-assign an appropriate volume from the \"Scratch\" pool into \"Client1_Pool\"\n\nand use that one.\n\nSo your jobs should never be explicitly told to use the Scratch pool. Bacula\n\ndoes it automagically.\n\nI hope that helps it make sense.\n\n--Tim\n\n*list pools\n\n+--------+---------+---------+---------+----------+-------------+\n\n| poolid | name | numvols | maxvols | pooltype | labelformat |\n\n+--------+---------+---------+---------+----------+-------------+\n\n| 1 | Default | 0 | 0 | Backup | * |\n\n| 2 | Scratch | 10 | 0 | Backup | * |\n\n| 3 | Full | 0 | 0 | Backup | * |\n\n+--------+---------+---------+---------+----------+-------------+\n\nRun Backup job\n\nJobName: Client1\n\nLevel: Full\n\nClient: molbio-fd\n\nFileSet: Full Set"
