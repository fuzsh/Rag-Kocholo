        "text": "Move the pointer over the image to skim the video.\n\nIf you’re batch sharing (exporting multiple items), the image is replaced by a list of the items you’re exporting.\n\nIn the Info pane, view and modify the still-image attributes, such as the title and description.\n\nSee Change metadata for shared items in Final Cut Pro for Mac. All of the attributes associated with the project or clip are included in the still-image output file.\n\nImportant: By default, the title field lists the project or clip name. Changing the title does not change the project or clip name, which is the name used for the exported file.\n\nScale image to preserve aspect ratio: Leave this checkbox selected unless your project uses a non-square pixel format (such as 1440 x 1080) and you want to use the exported still image in another video project with the same non-square pixel properties.\n\nBurn in captions: If you added captions to your project, you can choose a caption language to burn in to the output media file.\n\nNote: Burned-in captions are permanently visible in the output file and are not the same as embedded captions."
