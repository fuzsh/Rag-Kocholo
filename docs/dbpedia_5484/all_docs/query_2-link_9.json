        "text": "Backing Storage\n\nStorage that is intended as a copy of the storage that is usually actively in use so that, if the storage medium such as a hard disk fails and data is lost on that medium, it can be recovered from the copy.\n\nCD - Compact Disk\n\nA small, portable, round medium made of molded polymer (close in size to the floppy disk) for electronically recording, storing, and playing back audio, video, text, and other information in digital form.\n\nAdvantages of CDs\n\nSmall and portable\n\nVery cheap to produce\n\nMost computers can read CDs. If there is no CD drive, a DVD drive can usually read them\n\nFairly fast to access the data - quicker than magnetic tape\n\nDisadvantages of CDs\n\nFairly fragile, easy to snap or scratch\n\nSmaller storage capacity than a hard drive or DVD\n\nSlower to access than the hard disk.\n\nDVD - Digital Video Disk\n\nA type of compact disc able to store large amounts of data, especially high-resolution audiovisual material.\n\nAdvantages of DVDs\n\nVery large storage capacity\n\nSound and picture quality is excellent, making them ideal for storing films with video and sound.\n\nDVDs are now mass produced so they are relatively cheap\n\nDVD drives can read CDs\n\nDisadvantages of DVDs\n\nDVDs do not work in CD drives\n\nThere is no single standard of DVD\n\nThey can be easily damaged by breaking or scratching\n\nExternal Hard Disk\n\nAn external hard drive is a portable storage device that can be attached to a computer through a USB or FireWire connection, or wirelessly. External hard drives typically have high storage capacities and are often used to back up computers or serve as a network drive.\n\nAdvantages of External Hard Disk\n\nNecessary to support the way your computer works\n\nLarge storage capacity\n\nStores and retrieves data much faster than a floppy disk or CD/DVD\n\nStored items are not lost when you switch off the computer\n\nCheap on a cost per megabyte compared to other storage devices\n\nDisadvantages of External Hard Disk\n\nFar slower to access data than ROM or RAM chips\n\nRegular crashes can damage the surface of the disk, leading to loss of data in that sector\n\nThey're often quite large and therefore inconvenient to carry around.\n\nThey have moving parts so are more likely to break, especially if dropped.\n\nPen Drive/Memory Stick\n\nA very small, portable, solid-state hard drive that can be inserted into a USB port for storage and retrieval of data. Expand. Also, flashdrive. Expand. Also called flash memory drive, jump drive, pen drive, thumbdrive, USB drive.\n\nAdvantages of Pen Drive\n\nThey are extremely portable, so the user can take them wherever they go.\n\nThey're durable, because they have no moving parts.\n\nWon't get damaged easily when dropped compared to Hard Disks.\n\nDisadvantages of Pen Drive\n\nEasy to lose, get stolen or damaged as very small\n\nCannot hold as much data as Hard Disk\n\nSolid State Drives - SSD\n\nA storage device containing non-volatile flash memory, used in place of a hard disk because of its much greater speed.\n\nAdvantages of SSD\n\nFaster startup because there is no spin-up required.\n\nMuch Faster than Hard Disks\n\nFaster boot and application launch time when hard disk seeks are the limiting factor.\n\nSomewhat longer lifetime – Flash storages typically has a data lifetime of 10 years before it stops working.\n\nSecurity – allowing a very quick scan of all data stored.\n\nSome of the storage devices are waterproof.\n\nDisadvantages of SSD\n\nVery Expensive\n\nVulnerability to certain types of effects, including abrupt power loss, magnetic fields and electric/static charges compared to normal hard disk drives.\n\nLimited writes cycles. Typical Flash storage will typically wear out after 100,000-300,000 write cycles, while high endurance Flash storage is often marketed with endurance of 1–5 million write cycles\n\nSlow random write speeds – as erase blocks on SSDs generally are quite large, they're far slower than conventional disks for random writes."
