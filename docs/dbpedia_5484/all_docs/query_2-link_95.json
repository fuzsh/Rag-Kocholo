        "text": "Chapter 6 – Memory, Storage Devices and Media\n\nKEY WORDS:\n\nMIDI – Musical Instrument Digital Interface. Ring tones on your phone are stored in MIDI. Prestored note on electronic instruments as well as being prestored on your phone (ring tones). Midi is different from Mp3 due to the fact that it plays a prestored sound as well as being able to be played in instruments. Takes up more space than MP3\n\nPitch Byte – tells the MIDI device which note to play\n\nVelocity Byte– tells device how loud to play the note\n\nMP3 – This is also known as MPEG-3, takes up less space then MIDI\n\nMP4 – This is also known as MPEG-4\n\nAudio Compressions –\n\nFile Compressions –\n\nPerceptual Music Sharing –\n\nLossy Format –\n\nTopic Notes:\n\nTypes of memory – RAM, ROM. Memory indicates displays and speed\n\nStorage devices – can be both online, offline and on the cloud (eg ICloud)\n\nMedia – music files are typically saved as mp3 files whereas video files are more likely to be saved as either avi or mp4.\n\nFile formats: mp3,mp4, jpeg,png,MIDI, teXT AND\n\nHow to decrease the file size without compromising the actual file data itself\n\nMIDI – file is saved as .mid\n\nCalculating storage:\n\n1 min of a music track is about 12mb\n\nMusic files that are downloaded on a PC are generally compressed and are mp3.\n\nIMAGE TYPES – PNG, GIF ,JPEG, .TIF, .BMP\n\nThe quality of the image depends on the number of pixels, the more the number of pixels the higher the resolution/ the higher the qua.lity.,\n\nReducing the number of pixels will make the image pixelated\n\nCompression – to reduce the file\n\nMemory – how fast or slow the computer\n\nExternal Storage – usb, hard disk drive\n\nInternal – Solid State Drive\n\nCan the computer cope with the speed of the game in order to make sure that the graphics will load quick enough or enough\n\nTo convert MIDI. Removes the sounds that humans cant hear, the human ear that cant detect\n\n###Must remember the amounts of each different storage memory file\n\nFile format is very crucial when computing.\n\nIf there is no validation then there is a possibility that the data will be incorrectly stored. Validation routines need to be put in, the computer may store the wrong data or it will error (the computer wont understand what the data is)\n\nASCII is more human based – for generic users because it allows users to understand what you are doing\n\nHexadecimal is shorter and it is a lot faster than using binary\n\nBinary is overly complex and it is harder for us to read\n\nCOMPRESSION – it decreases/ reduces the size of the file\n\nYou can cut down the number of characters by representing the words with numbers. Thus, reducing the size\n\nNotepad doesn’t have any functions built into it so there are no extra bytes, so the number of kb or mb will be its original number which is 1 bit per character\n\nData Dictionary ^^^\n\nMust put data dictionary in the beginning\n\nWhen you zip a file the file size decreases but when it has already been sent then\n\nHacked -> sensitive data\n\nAir Gapped computer – a device that has never been connected to the interent\n\nPrimary Storage – hard disk or soft disk drive, can also be RAM and ROM\n\nSecondary Storage – HDD , SSD and external devices\n\nYou are able to expand your memory for your electronic device\n\nExpand the memory for our computer by connecting it with an SD card or an external card\n\nVolatile memory and Non volatile memory\n\nD RAM – chip would consist\n\nStatic RAM\n\nDynamic RAM\n\nRegular RAM\n\nHave a picture of the sizes on blogs – not going to know any size above petabyte in terms of storage capacity.\n\n(KEYWORD) Portable\n\n(KEYWORD) Durable\n\n(KEYWORD)Cost Per Megabyte\n\ntransfer speed – read and write from SSD and read and write from HDD\n\nCapacity – amount that you can store\n\nSuitability – when will it be suitable for the used to be used\n\nfloppy disk – obsolete. No one uses it anymore\n\nFile storage – tells you pixels -> in book for chapter 6 (check for more notes)\n\nreduce by a factor – seen in video about storage capacity below\n\nwork out rough capacity – then you have to pick a source of technology\n\nMIDI and MP3\n\nMIDI – raw sound\n\nCMYK – CYAN MAGENTA YELLOW KEY (BLACK) – four different colours\n\nRGB – Red Green Blue\n\nApplication Usage:\n\nMicrowave –\n\nROM: pre-set values, the different modes that have been set, the automatic lights, setting for sound.\n\nRAM: the time as well as the set temperature (Customized).\n\nRefrigerator –\n\nROM:the pre-set values, the pre-set temperature (in terms of how cold or warm), lights, prestored conditions (cold air blown)\n\nTemporary memory is in other devices (not only computers) such as printers.’\n\nMagnetic Storage – hard disk. normally made up of several platters (the layers in the disk e.g).\n\nOptical Storage – dvds, cds and blu ray,usb, sd card\n\nPrimary Storage\n\nSecondary storage\n\nif your computer becomes slow , clear the RAM by closing then different programs\n\nRAM never becomes full, it just becomes overloaded\n\noffline storage: you have to consider the speed of access . You can use a magnetic tape. Cheap storage method but it’s slow (you can store a lot though).\n\nCCTVS – most likely use magnetic tape.\n\nServers use hard disk – read data from hard disk quick enough\n\nTo back up : use external hard drive.\n\nFile Formats:\n\nMIDI :\n\nMusical Instrument Digital Interface. This stores music files.It allows the electronic musical instruments to interact with each other. It also uses parallel transmission as well as being asynchronous.\n\nIt is a one way conversion between MIDI and MP3. It can only be converted from MIDI to MP3.\n\nYou can use Midi to make music. Due to the fact that you are not limited to playing just 1 instrument. It doesn’t matter what sort of MIDI controller you use, you can still make it sound like any instrument you want.\n\nMIDI files don’t contain any sounds. Instead they are a communications protocol in which it allows electronic musical instruments to interact with each other.\n\nMIDI files store analogue data (pitch, volume etc)\n\nMIDI has two bites that have been additionally required. They are a pitch byte and a velocity byte. The pitch byte determines which note is played whereas the velocity byte determines how loud the note is played.\n\nThe music is stored as number of commands but there are actually no musical notes.\n\n8 bit serial transmission therefore making it asynchronous\n\nMPEG 3 :\n\nMotion Pictures Experts Group (MPEG). This uses audio compression in which is the lossy file compression method. This can only store sound or audio. It should reduce the file size of a normal music file to about 90% of the original.\n\nMP3 files use a ‘lossy format’ since part of the original file is lost following the compression algorithm. However, even the quality of MP3 files can be different since it depends on the ‘bit rate’ (it is the number of bits per second used when creating the file)\n\nThe bit rates are roughly about 80 – 320 kilobits per second. (usually 200 or higher gives a sound quality close to a CD)\n\nMPEG 4 :\n\nThis format will allow storage of multimedia files that includes more than sound. This is one of the differences between MPEG 4 and MPEG 3. Videos are also able to be streamed over the internet with the use of MPEG 4 without any noticeable changes in terms of its quality.\n\nJPEG :\n\nThis is a type image compression in which also involves lossy file compression. In which in this case the number of pixels per centimetre used to store that image will have changed. An example of this is reducing the picture resolution – this will decrease the quality. The number of pixels with determine the resolution. The higher the amount of pixels, the high the resolution (the better the quality). JPEG is also able to reduce a raw bitmap image by a factor of 5 to 15. Thus meaning that a 30MB image may become between 2MB and 6MB after being compressed with the use of JPEG. The size of the image with also have to do with the size of the number of pixels. The higher the number of pixels, the higher the size of the file (image file).\n\n.Tiff and .BMP :\n\nThese are known as raw bitmaps. The formats that provide the highest image quality due to the fact that they are not compressed.\n\n^^^The Human Eye – it can only pick out 10 million colours out of 40 million colours.\n\nText and Number Format :\n\nThis can be stored in multiple ways and in multiple formats. However, text is generally stored in ASCII.\n\nYou must know that the correct format is chosen. If number files are compressed in any way then they tend to be lossless. Due to the fact that it is crucial for the information to be kept as it is and for none of it to be lost.\n\nText files can also be compressed. This is done by replacing repetitive words or letter in order to make them simpler. For Example :\n\n‘THIS SECTION SHOWS YOU HOW THIS WOULD WORK’ – Before compression (replacing). This has 35 memory units, not including the spaces.\n\n‘1 SECTION S2S Y3 2 1 W3LD WORK ” – What happened was that ‘HOW’ and ‘OU’ were replaced with 2 and 3 . Whereas THIS was replaced with 1. This is now 23 memory units.\n\nConverting from MIDI to MP3 :\n\nWhen MIDI is converted to MP3, it uses ‘audio compression’. This technology reduces the size of the MIDI file by about 90%.\n\nThe conversion made from mp3 to MIDI is not possible because when the MIDI file has been converted to an mp3 file, the unnecessary sounds (instructions) have already been extracted. Therefore the sounds (instructions) that have been lost (taken out) can’t be put back in again. Thus meaning that the original MIDI can’t be restored after being converted into an mp3 file.\n\nCompression Techniques:\n\nLossy File Compression:\n\nLossy File Compression – is the type of compression where you lose some of the data during the process. For example jpeg files\n\nThe way that jpeg files work : averages out the colours within it, therefore there is a loss in quality. But you lose a lot of file size. However, this data cant be put back in once its taken out.\n\nCompression Artifacts :\n\nCompression Artifacts – after you save the jpeg file at a low quality if you save it at a low quality again (compressed once more). After multiple rotations then it can possibly become a compression artifact\n\nLossless File Compression:\n\nLossless File Compression – the data is compressed but the original data is stored.The file is basically reconstructed . Zip file, when you come back , the data is the same. However, zip files are not a very good example since it isn’t classified as a multimedia file. More of a generic file compression. The type of compression that comes from file types and codings.\n\n6.4 Memory and Storage\n\n6.4.1 Primary Memory :\n\n1. Random Access Memory (RAM) :\n\nRandom Access Memory (RAM) is a hardware device that allows information to be stored and retrieved on a computer.If the computer is turned off, all data contained in RAM is lost.\n\n2. DRAM (Dynamic RAM) :\n\nDynamic random-access memory (DRAM) is a type of random-access memory that stores each bit of data in a separate capacitor.A DRAM storage cell is dynamic in that it needs to be refreshed or given a new electronic charge every 15 milliseconds to compensate for charge leaks from the capacitor.\n\n3. SRAM (Static RAM) :\n\nSRAM (static RAM) is random access memory (RAM) that retains data bits in its memory as long as power is being supplied. Faster and doesn’t need to be refreshed.\n\n4. Read Only Memory (ROM) :\n\nThe start up instructions for the computer. Read only because if they are changed, then the computer will not start properly. Telling the computer to start up /transfer the operating system and the files to the RAM.\n\n6.4.2 Secondary Storage :\n\n1.Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) :\n\nIt keeps a hold of its data despite having the power turned off (in a computer). Inside the HDD there are sectors in which are stored on rotating platters. These platter have magnetic heads that move an ‘arm’ to read and write data to the drive. They are not volatile. The faster the platter itself spins; the faster the HDD can perform. Generally, the HDD can move from the center to the edge, and back again, 50 times a second.\n\nAdvantages + Disadvantages:\n\n–An HDD is capable of storing lots of data cheaply\n\n-cheaper than SSD\n\n-Higher storage capacity than SSD\n\n-It has a longer lifespan than SSD\n\n–It is slower than the SSD\n\n-It has a higher power consumption\n\n-it is not as durable when compared to the SSD\n\n2.Soft disk Drives (SSDs) :\n\nSSDs don’t have any moving parts and the tissue (Latency, which is found in HDD) has been removed to an extent. All the data within the drive itself is retrieved at the same rate. They also do not rely on magnetic properties. Commonly, the data is stored by controlling the movement of electrons in the NAND chip. Thus resulting in the data being stored in 1s and 0s. Similarly, SSDs are non-volatile.\n\nSometimes the SSD drives use EEPROM technology in which the only difference is that the chip is changed from NAND to NOR. Thus making it faster, however this also makes it more expensive.\n\nAdvantages + Disadvantages:\n\n-more reliable\n\n-in terms of weight it is lighter\n\n-they don’t have to wait for the computer to start up\n\nThey have no moving parts\n\n-data access is faster than HDD\n\n– more expensive than HDD\n\n-limited storage capacity\n\n– it is not as available as HDDs\n\n-It has a shorter lifespan than HDDs\n\n3.EEPROM / Electronically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory :\n\nThis is used in SSD. In which make them faster but the disadvantage is that it is more expensive. This also uses NOR chips as opposed to NAND chips. EEPROM can delete or read the data by the byte. Therefore making it useful when the bytes are really important and need to be read or deleted , rather than huge chunks of data that would be deleted if the NAND chips were used instead.\n\n6.4.3 Off-Line Storage:\n\n1.CD/DVD :\n\nThey are both considered as optical storage devices. Since laser light is used to read and write the data in the surface of the disk. Both have a thin layer of metal alloy or light-sensitive organic dye that is sued to store the data. As well as that both systems use a single, spiral track in which runs from the center to the edge of the disk. When the data is stored, it is stored in ‘pits’ and ‘bumps’ on the spiral track of the CD/DVD. Additionally when it reads and writes it uses a red laser.\n\nInside DVDs are a little bit different than CDs. There is only 1 big difference which is that DVDs have dual layering. Dual layering will enable the DVD to increase the storage capacity.\n\nAdvantages + Disadvantages :\n\n-large capacity\n\n-good sound and picture quality\n\n-DVD drives can read CDs\n\n-relatively cheap\n\n-DVDs don’t work in CD drives\n\n-They can be easily damaged by it being scratch or breaking\n\n2.DVD RAM :\n\nWhen compared to DVDs and CDs, DVD RAM is very different. It has different features including: the use of a number of concentric tracks, simultaneous read and write operations, they allow it to read and write multiple operations as well as it having a high longevity in which makes them a great choice for archiving.\n\nAdvantages + Disadvantages :\n\n-They last a long time (around 30 years)\n\n-can be written over 100,00 times\n\n-very fast access to stored files\n\n-it can simultaneously read and write data\n\n-large storage capacity\n\n-it is quite expensive when compared to DVDs and CDs\n\n-it doesn’t work in as many devices\n\n3.Blu Ray :\n\nIt is a type of optical storage media. The difference between DVDs and Blu-ray discs is due to its construction as well as they way to execute read and write operations. When the read and write operations are executed, Blu-ray disks use blue lasers as oppose to red lasers. In addition to that, Blu-ray disks can store up to 5 times more data than DVDs. Blu-ray disks don’t suffer from reading errors that are caused by the light refractions that separate the beams in 2 separate parts.\n\nAdvantages + Disadvantages:\n\n-these disks automatically come with secure encryption systems in which helps to prevent piracy and copyright infringement.\n\n-large storage capacity\n\n-expensive\n\n-The variety of movies for Blu-ray is less however, the variety should increase in the future\n\nUSB Flash Memories/Memory Sticks :\n\nThese use ‘solid state technology’.\n\nAdvantages : very small, lightweight thus making them suitable to transfer files between computers. As well as this they can be used for backup.\n\nDigital cameras often use memory cards – SD-XD cards.\n\nIf these sticks or cards happen to be removed during a read or a write operation, this would result in the possibility that the data on it might be lost or become corrupted.\n\nRemovable Hard Disk Drives:\n\nThese are hard disk drives that can be used in order to backup. This is done by connecting it to one of the USB ports.\n\nHow to estimate the size of a file:\n\n1 character in a computer system is 1 byte or 4 bits (the amount of space it takes up)- a space is 1 character\n\nDepending on the Fonts and functions will change the amount of storage (amount of mb or kb) that the file has. Also depending on the software or program used , this also may add on to the number of bytes (the size) due to the size of the software’s functions itself.\n\nNotepad will only use the data that has been typed in."
