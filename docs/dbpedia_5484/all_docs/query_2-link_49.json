        "text": "Does anyone know of a good guide for finding and using a tape drive?\n\nEbay seems to show that LTO-6 drives are somewhat affordable but I don‚Äôt want to have any idea about the software requirements to use of of those. I was looking at a cheapish Dell drive but then couldn‚Äôt see anything on Dells site (I guess the model is discontinued for newer tape standards), when looking at the newer models all I could see was the enterprise Dell Gui stuff which isn‚Äôt really something I want to casually use.\n\nI assume that I‚Äôm not the first ‚Äòconsumer‚Äô to want a tape drive. Surely someone has made some reasonable software that runs on Windows or failing that Linux that I can use to dump data onto the drive.\n\nPlease point me in the right direction\n\nI used to use iperius backup to write to an LTO-4 drive on windows because it was the easiest to use.\n\nNot to knock on LTO too hard but it isn‚Äôt cost competitive with just swapping out hard drives until you get into many dozens or hundreds of terabytes. The only other area it excels at is if you had to ferry around large amounts of data physically and you needed it to not break during rough handling.\n\nAnother thing you‚Äôll want if you buy a used tape drive is the drive‚Äôs corresponding low-level utility so that you can monitor the finite head life of the drive.\n\nTandberg‚Äôs TDtool; HP‚Äôs Library and Tape Tools; IBM‚Äôs ITDT\n\nSo I guess that just shows up as a drive, that‚Äôs not too bad. I was thinking there would be some extra program that would be needed to talk to the thing and then manage the data that way. LTFS seems pretty cool.\n\nOn Ebay at least it seemed like Dell had some tape drives that were cheap though I can‚Äôt seem to find any software for them which makes me question if that would even run under Windows. Based on what @twin_savage says HP and IBM seem to have accessible software so maybe that‚Äôs the way to go. I‚Äôll have to wait until a cheap unit comes along though‚Ä¶\n\nIs there anything to avoid when looking for a drive or is it all just the same thing with a different badge on the front?\n\nTape drives are literally went on their way to the dinosaurs.\n\nSome drives you could get with the ide interface but most were scsi.\n\nThe ide ones often worked with windows but usually you had to install a driver to even detect them.\n\nEven when they were detected by bios they could only be accesses through the backup and restore software.\n\nThey were not searchable like other media.\n\nYou could also use the ide to sata adapter.\n\nWhile they did indeed store a large amount of data they were damn slow to access.\n\nTapes themselves were susceptible to magnetic fields and could degrade over time, but usually failure resulted in wear and tear.\n\nIt was crucial to keep the heads, rollers, and capstan clean.\n\nThe other foible, belt wear!\n\nUnless you got one with direct drive capstain you had to deal with stretched belts and dry rot.\n\nIts one of the reasons i quit using them.\n\nOptical media ( providing it was stored in a cool dry place) last many times longer and by far much more economical.\n\nIf you want to use them, its up to you.\n\nBut your in for an expensive ride.\n\nTape drives aren‚Äôt dead yet, but their use case is very limited(very large amounts of data, very rarely read, stored for very long time).\n\nHDD/SSD/Optical might be more affordable. Would you mind telling us the amount of data that you need to backup? And how much new data is expected to be added to the backup, say per month? You probably want to plan for full and incremental backups, testing your backups with checksums, writing the tapes to new tapes when needed, and where to store them. Tapes don‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt have upkeep.\n\nRegarding software on Linux, you can often get away with just tar(and maybe some shell script plus cron).\n\nTar was actually ‚Äúdesigned for‚Äù tape drives(it stands for ‚ÄúTape ARchiver‚Äù), but evolved into the most common Linux archive format. It should come pre-installed on most Linux distributions.\n\nYou can do full or incremental backups, and don‚Äôt need to seek in a way ‚Äúincompatible‚Äù with tapes.\n\nWhen you say optical media I think of blue rays which are only 100GB per disk (or 50/25, I guess depending on what is most affordable at the time).\n\nThere is this stuff but it looks dead as the drives themselves have been discontinued and the ones that are for sale are way more expensive than even the newer tape drives (LTO-8 which stores 12 TB uncompressed per tape for ‚Ç¨71).\n\nAre you talking about blue-ray or is there some lesser known disk technology that people use? (I‚Äôm genuinely curios even if I don‚Äôt end up going this route cause I don‚Äôt hear much about this)\n\nI‚Äôm mainly looking to backup the 3TB though it grows 100-400GB a year. Then I have another 6-ish TB that is nice to have backed up but not the end of the world if lost.\n\nI was looking at LTO-6 cause it fits my current 3TB size quite nicely without compression. In 2 years that would be just 2 drives uncompressed or 1 compressed. I always feel a bit weird about using compression in backups cause it might make recovery a little harder if a little piece of it gets corrupted, is the built in compression something that has these kinds of issues?\n\nMaybe waiting for LTO-9 might trigger some datacentre somewhere to offload LTO-7 drives which I can get for cheap? Probably just wishful thinking though.\n\nProviding your data is not corrupted compression is not an issue.\n\nIts been a very long time since ive studied compressionüò≥ but from what i understand from classes ( over a half century ago)!\n\nSo this might not be accurate.\n\nEarly compression was removing all spaces, tabs, and indents, and paragraphs.\n\nLeaving a number representing what it was.\n\nTranslation to machine code, then to binary for storage by the compression software.\n\nThis 3 step process dramatically reduced the size of the file.\n\nBut like i said earlier, it might not be accurate because im an old fartü§£\n\nNumerous shareware utilities ( pkzip, / pkunzip, 7 zip, etc) were available for this.\n\nBut many os‚Äôs come with their own backup programs that give you the option of file compression.\n\nThe problem with backing up large amounts of data is that media size is a problem.\n\nThings to consider:\n\nWhat is the importance of the data?\n\nWhat will the cost of storage be?\n\nAnd what will the long term reliability of the storage media be?\n\nOptical media such as blueray for long term storage,\n\npros:\n\nmuch lower costs highly reliable, and relatively immune to magnetic corruption, searchable, and much higher speed.\n\nIn controlled temperature environments they can last centuries.\n\nCons:\n\nEasily damaged by excessive heat, excessive sunlight, dirt scratches and being fragile in excessive cold.\n\nAnd limit in size.\n\nTape drives\n\nPros: larger storage capacity due to recording procedure, and the size( length) of the tape\n\nCons: susceptibility to magnetic fields, fragility of the media, ( heat, cold, wearing, stretching, tearing, wrinkling, etc)\n\nSlow speed.\n\nExcessive cost for media, and drives.\n\nMaintenance expenses.\n\nAnd lastly the magnetic fields of the recorded data itself will fade over time if not refreshed periodically.\n\nThe major conundrum here is, technology is rapidly outpacing the storage capabilities.\n\nLook at how cdr and dvd are faring right now as compared to just 10 years ago.\n\nSure the dvd may last a long time ( 100 plus years)in storage\n\nBut will the drives be around that long?\n\nThats too far into the future for me to see.\n\nI guess it is blu-ray like? The two most recent gens use cartridges in the 3-5.5Tb range. Write-once only. The 1st Gen has multiple writes at smaller sizes but as you eluded too they are sunset products. I don‚Äôt know about tape as well as you do. In what you‚Äôve shared I would anecdotally say tapes may be cheaper. I also may be wrong with this but are tapes slow? Here you get transfer rates in the 1Gbps/write, 3Gbps/read area. Their sales team says its ‚Äúresistant and has a 100year life‚Äù, so to @Gnuuser point the real question is how important is your data. Apparently the Vatican uses it.\n\nFor this size of data, you might be better off with HDDs.\n\nI think it should be cheaper because you don‚Äôt need as much equipment(You‚Äôd probably need at least 2 tape drives for a proper backup, because if one fails you can‚Äôt get to your data until you have another tape-drive, and ordering a new one, if possible, could take days to weeks. Best to get 3 or more).\n\nYes, the tape drive media is cheaper per TB, but your I think in this case the static and running costs aren‚Äôt worth it.\n\n(I think bluray isn‚Äôt cheaper per TB, but haven‚Äôt checked for a while)\n\nHere‚Äôs what I think you should do:\n\nBackup strategy\n\nBuy a bunch of cheap drives, enough to store your important data at least 3x, with room to spare(e.g. 4TB * (3x redundancy + 1x spare).\n\nPut some drives in an ‚Äúonline-backup solution‚Äù, meaning reachable via network, make automatic incremental backups of live data\n\nThis is your ‚Äúmain‚Äù backup with the most recent data that you can restore the fastest.\n\nThis could even be a cheap consumer-grade NAS\n\nPut some drives in a storage room for ‚Äúcold-backup‚Äù\n\nnot network reachable(‚Äúoffline‚Äù) and lasts for a long time\n\nIn case online backups gets ransomware‚Äôd.\n\nMake sure storage conditions are good(temperature, humidity)\n\nPut some drives in another location for ‚Äúoff-site backup‚Äù(In case a building burns down or other natural disaster)\n\nMostly the same stuff as for the ‚Äúcold-backup‚Äù\n\nMake a nice backup plan:\n\nSwap out disks in the ‚Äúlive-backup server‚Äù every once in a while\n\nRegular tests for all backups: live, cold, off-site. A backup is useless when you can‚Äôt restore it!\n\nCompression\n\nCompress data or not?I think you should.\n\nYou can use both HDDs and Tape with compression, as long as you‚Äôve got enough redundancy/parity data.\n\nIt‚Äôs not that compression makes you more susceptible to bitrot. It‚Äôs just that sometimes a single flipped bit in some compression schemes can result in a larger block of invalid data, compared to ‚Äúplain binary‚Äù(same with encryption).\n\nEvery bitrot has the potential to make a file unreadable, compressed or not(bitrot destroys information). But you can absolutely combine compression with redundancy/parity information, to detect and correct bitrot. In that case it doesn‚Äôt matter if your data is compressed or not, as it should always be correct, as long as you‚Äôve gotten enough parity information.\n\nThere is some irony in first trying to remove any redundancy from a file(compression), and then re-introducing some on purpose(redundancy/parity)‚Ä¶\n\nKeep in mind that compression can lead to other problems, e.g. you might have enough storage for the compressed image, but not the uncompressed data.\n\nThat‚Äôs exactly why I don‚Äôt like it especially with tapes/discs where a scratch or imperfection in the recording medium can lead to bad blocks. I know there are algorithms to recover the data (like a scratch on a DVD is usually corrected by the hardware when possible) but with densely packed data it makes me a little nervous. If I was to zip things together a parity archive format would possibly be the way to go?\n\nMy question was more about he compression claims on the tapes themselves. All the tapes I‚Äôve seen say ‚ÄúX capacity uncompressed, X2 capacity compressed‚Äù, there seems to be a standard compression system that tapes use which I was more interested in the reliability of if anyone has first hand experience with that sort of stuff?\n\nSo the optical media your referring to as cheaper is Blue-Ray? (if it‚Äôs something else I would love to read up on it)\n\nLooking at blue-ray I can find them for around ‚Ç¨22/TB (ebay) which isn‚Äôt too bad, especially considering that the drives are ubiquitous. Question is how long are they going to keep making discs though? Film and TV are seemingly stopping releases which means that production lines making blue rays might start to constrain supply.\n\nThough saying that floppies where in production till ~2011, 30 years of production is pretty good considering BlueRay only come out in 2006 though the prevalence of blue rays is definitely not as large as the floppies so who knows\n\nOptical disc archive seems to cost 9k (source) for the drive and a single disk with a $92 (1.2TB) to $183 (5.5TB), plus shipping cost to Europe but at 9k that‚Äôs a drop in the bucket. Still it‚Äôs quite pricy, aside from the fact that these readers are quite rare (no used market for instance) with the risk of being discontinued. I also have a feeling that the software side is probably cause issues first with no way to repair/replace. I would avoid this because it‚Äôs obscure and expensive, personally.\n\nAh, the good-old-321.\n\nI think the advice of using multiple media types is a bit old, or depending on how you define ‚Äúdifferent media‚Äù, already met:\n\nIt‚Äôs not really about having different media, but different modes of failure and having an extra degree of separation in your backups.\n\nFor example, the failure modes of a typical NAS for ‚Äúhot-backup‚Äù are completely different that the failure modes of the pile-of-drives ‚Äúcold-backup‚Äù strategy, and thus could be considered ‚Äúdifferent media‚Äù. Having a ‚Äúcloud backup‚Äù service like https://www.backblaze.com/ could be considered a different media.\n\nEDIT: Conclusion: I think not having tapes in 2023 is fine, but YMMV, they‚Äôre not dead yet.\n\nIdeally I would have cold storage which I can put in a box somewhere or store a bit of data at a family members house by having a HDD/SSD/tape/disk lying there without having to think about it to much.\n\nIn my mind tapes are probably the best at achieving this cause of storage density and the long shelf life. Though blue rays seem like a good alternative (if only they stored more so data can be kept together in larger chunks, maybe there are automated systems for reading large collections of blue-rays?)."
