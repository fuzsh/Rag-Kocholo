The reverse of what people might think—sports, Larry King, Charlie Rose, Meet the Press, and 60 Minutes. What about prime-time series? Not too many, but if I do, it's usually a drama like Matlock or NYPD Blue. Maybe I'm too show-wise, but I always know where sitcoms are going after the first scene. You have to un- derstand, I started in TV in 1929. I was in vaudeville in Chicago, and TV was an experimental thing. When I was asked to appear on TV, I said, \"What's that?\" I still have it on tape. I stood cold in front of the cameras and whoever had a set in Chicago could see it, which was about 100 families. Do you own many other videos? Yes, a copy of every show I ever did on TV. Can you program a VCR? Of course! What am I, aschmuck? When did you get your first TV? In 1936. Do you still have it? If you're talk- ing about the TV, no, but I still have jokes from back then. (- JEERS To recent Cheers recipient Arsenio Hall, whom we praised prematurely for deciding to end his talk show with grace and good- will. Instead, in his final shows, he lashed out at the producers, telling them on-air they could \"kiss my black ———\" and ranting about how racism played a part in the cancellation. Too bad. Hall had a success- ful, groundbreaking five- year run in which racism presumably did not play a part—and had it within his grasp to depart with ap- plause all around. Instead, he joined the victim brigade and left us with a whine, not a woof-woof-woof. CoCHEERS To ESPN, for elevating spelling to championship level. By televising the 67th annual Scripps How- ard National Spelling Bee, complete with a host from its SportsCenter, ESPN sent an important mes- sage: In the quest for ex- cellence, academics are as worthy as athletics— and as fun to watch, too.

Developed by HBO and Warner Music Group and starring such hip performers as John Leguizamo, Onyx, Queen Latifah, and Chuck D, the spots will run on MTV, BET, and other teen-favor- ed channels. Rapper Sticky Fingaz of Onyx (a group that has been charged with glorifying violence) put it well: “If I’m a preacher, a little kid wont listen to me. But if I’m Sticky Fingaz, they'll listen. So I can grab their attention and say, ‘Stop killing yourself. ” CoCHEERS To the returns this week of HBO’s Dream On and The Larry Sanders Show. With rerun season upon us, the prospect of fresh episodes from cable’s finest and funniest sitcoms is as deli- cious as ice cream on a hot summer day. Inside Sanders stuff: Yes, Larry returns to his show. And guests who'll play themselves include Elvis Costello, Sharon Stone, and, back for a re- peat flirt, Mimi Rogers. Hey now!

Exhibit 1: The X-Files, the cult hit that believes “the truth is out there” but is hidden by some intergalactic conspiracy. It makes paranoia sexy and entertaining. Exhibit 2: Dead at 21, a thriller about a government plot to mess with young minds. It turns paranoia into a badge of youth—and gives it a cool soundtrack. Alive at 20: Ryan gives Noseworthy a hand. Dead is a Max Headroom for MTV with- out the wowy graphics or wacky humor but with the same sense of irreverence, menace, and fun. Jack Noseworthy plays a guy named Ed who discovers on his 20th birthday that he’s being hunted by a gov- ernment agent because he is a “neurocy- bernaut” (“cyb” for short) with a chip in his head—a chip that has made him a ge- nius but also will make him crazy, short- ing out his brain by age 21. So he runs away with a pal (Lisa Dean Ryan) to find the doc who did this to him, the cure— and the truth that is out there. Hard to swallow? Sure, I think so. But imagine you're a Generation Xer reading recent reports about children used in '50s radiation experiments. What's so far-fetch- ed about implanting chips instead? O imagine seeing the White House conspir- acies recounted in the Haldeman diaries —at the same time you see a funeral lion- izing the Conspirator in Chief. Who's to say the government is not conspiring still? Who's to say paranoia's nuts? Certainly pop culture is treating it as serious and big business, trying to keep the jittery spirit of the Cold War alive long after the uw fall of communism robbed us of a i$ common bad guy. Books and movies - try to fill that venal vacuum with drug dealers as their new enemy. But TV—in the exhibits presented here, plus every magazine, tabloid, and talk show—is turning within, looking for conspiracies in our gov- ernment, even our families. TV has met the enemy and it is us. I don't mean to read too much into what is really just a neat, excit- ing little series. But if Dead clicks, it will be because it is a true (and enter- taining) barometer of its generation's angst. That's why it matters that this is a show about paranoia. It's also a show about how tough it is being smart today. It's about grunge as a way of life in an era of lowered expectations. It's about young love (“I want you to live, Ed. Is that so wrong?\" asks his pal). It's about coming- of-age: \"Maybe it is time to find out just what is inside my head,\" Ed says, taking that vow more literally than my peers did. And it's about just plain adventure: bad guys vs. good guys. Thats whatll make this more than sociology. That's what'll make this a hip hit of summer. li | TV GUIDE JUNE 18, 1994 | WHEN THE BIG CITY CALLED, HE HAD TO ANSWER. BORN TO GO WILD.

Their anxiety had been filtering through phone and fax lines for more than a week over a request for an important photo session—known in the business as a “cover try.” They were in- terested, but would their star be on the cover?

New pow- er pooches—including Comet and Bark- ley from Full House, Eddie from Frasier, and Murray from Mad About You—are forcing Lassie (who does get her own PBS special in August) to make room as they paw their way into the ranks of Holly- wood's power players. How powerful? Well, their newfound clout is propelling the canine craze into daytime. Vinnie, a lovable one-eared mutt, has the run of ABC's new daytime talk show Mike & Maty.

The Full House regular’s thespian gifts are so wide-ranging that during his first season on the ABC sitcom, he played his own mother, then returned the next year as himself. “As an actor,” says Cristie Miele, his trainer, “he has tremendous range.” Like De Niro, the camera-mad golden will even undergo appearance-altering procedures for a part.

Lassie is coming out with a new movie—the ninth since the 43 classic “Lassie Come Home”—this summer. Barkley stole the show from Dana Carvey in spring's \"Clean Slate\" PETER IOVINO/MGM Eddie, Frasier Real Name: Moose Breed: Jack Russell terrier Age: 4 You've heard this kind of Hollywood story before: troubled childhood, then adversity, finally stardom. “His family gave him up; he was crazy,” says trainer Mathilde F KATZ FOR TV GUIDE deCagny.

He's making a music video, and in 1995 (it had to 3 happen)—Eddie calendars. and will appear this summer opposite Charles Grodin in “Tt Runs in the Family.\" And Comet stars with Matthew Modine in \"Fluke,\" an upcoming flick about a murder victim reincarnated as a dog. As a result of this newfound popularity and im- | pressive earning power, superdogs are in the posi- tion to ask for (and get) all the perks of the star system: contracts, agents, publicists, body dou- bles, videos, calendars, and enough adoration to make any dogs tail spin. It’s a Cinderella story for many of these dogs. Vinnie was rescued from the pound. Eddie was given up by his owners because he was too much to handle. Seeing a certain something—energy, in- telligence, or an unusual personality—Holly- wood animal trainers adopt these dogs, refine their skills, and take them to casting calls.

But Bear's seven years in the biz prove it can be done. Starting his NBC career at the tender age - of 11/2 years, the network stalwart has never been known to throw his weight (105 Ibs.) around. \"He's always there with a lick on the face,\" says executive producer Regina Stewart Larsen.

Son of an Italian immigrant who runs a barbershop, Meola was drafted by the Yankees, but why bother with a bat when you can send a ball soaring with your feet?

Its not quite ready for prime time, but soccer will get star treatment on TV this month By JANICE KAPLAN wildered by the World Cup. Sure, ev- eryone knows it’s the biggest sport- ing event on the planet and that some two billion viewers all over the world will be watching on their local stations. In places like Brazil, so many people cluster around their TV sets when the national team is playing that towns virtually close down. But in America? “I suspect that, de- pending on how the U.S. team does, this is going to have a bigger impact than peo- ple think,” hazards Jack O'Hara, executive producer for ABC Sports. With ABC airing 11 games and ESPN showing the other 41, fans can pretty much Ё the rest of America, ТУ is a bit be- WORLD CU occer COMES TO merica “I hope that people in this country will watch with an open mind,” says Al Traut- wig, опе of ABC's soccer analysts. \"We're going to cover it simply, we're going to talk about it simply, and it's 'Most goals wins.' It couldn't get easier than that.\" Almost half the population of the world watched the 1990 World Cup games in It- aly, and more nations are affiliated with FIFA, soccer's governing body, than with the United Nations. That the '94 World Cup is taking place at nine sites from Pasadena to Boston was a calculated decision by FIFA to seduce baseball/basketball/foot- ball-obsessed Americans who might other- wise ignore soccer's quadrennial party. For the American announcers, broad- casting these games is like teaching in a one-room schoolhouse: Everyone watch- ing has a different level of knowledge. “You don’t want to alienate the experts who grew up with the game and know all the strategies and intricacies,” says Rick Da- vis, a U.S. soccer star in the '80s and now a commentator for ABC and ESPN. “On the other hand, just as many people don’t un- derstand what's going on, and when the ball goes out of bounds, they want to know how it gets back in.\" They'll learn. \"When the crowd is hiss- з watch soccer day and night from June 17 é to July 17.

Action in each 45-minute half is continuous, and, says O'Hara, “You can't cut away for a commer- cial, because the minute you do, someone is sure to score the only goal of the game.\" The solution here: commercials before, af- ter, and at halftime, and a graphic that in- cludes a time clock with a sponsor's logo. Carlos Valderrama, cotombia нь changing hairstyles make him the Dennis Rodman of soccer, and on the field, Valderrama is as mercurial as his wild style would suggest. Coming from nowhere to be the class act of South American soccer, Colombia is sure to be the strongest team in the four-nation first-round bracket that includes the U.S. At the old age of 32, i < А Jurgen Klinsmann, Tall, lithe, and speedy, Klinsmann, 29, played for Germany's gold-medal team in '90 and is a powerful forward with explosive skills. | Opposing fans hate him because he is a master at fooling referees: He feigns injury, then gets up unhurt after the official has punished the alleged offender. Germany has sometimes been criticized for treating soccer like a military activity, but it won the Cup in '90. Only Brazil and Italy match its record of three World Cup titles. That clock, however, is one thing that will make fans realize they're not in the Superdome anymore. Unlike football— where 10 minutes left in the game means “Have dinner ready in half an hour'— there are no time-outs in soccer. But the referee can arbitrarily add time to the end of the game if there's been a pause in the action for an injury—real or imagined. “Can you imagine?\" asks O'Hara. “View- ers are used to the NBA clock, which shows hundredths of a second. Here, it's up to the referee. He blows the whistle— and it's over. The only official clock is in his pocket. Ours will be unofficial.\" The networks will have plenty of ana- lysts in the booth, but no sideline re- porters. That shouldn't be much of a prob- lem, since with only two substitutions (plus a LECOQ/SPORTS ILLUSTRATED Valderrama anchors a young squad hoping to change its country's image as a hotbed of drugs and violence.

Armen Forces ARMY fr NAVY Ýr AIR FORCE Ýr MARINES У COAST GUARD X | England says, \"Try the sport of Popes and Kings!’ merica and England may be an ocean apart, but there is much we share. Americans have given the world Baywatch, Wheel of Fortune, and Big Macs, and the English have sent back Mick Jagger, Oxford marmalade, and the simple game of soccer. With the U.S. hosting the World Cup, the tournament will no doubt have flair and pizzazz. But there are rumblings of disquiet around the globe about entrusting the world's soccer festival to a nation that is lukewarm about the sport. For some reason, Americans have been distinctly aloof to the seductions of soccer, and seem to have as much use for the World Cup as the Venus de Milo has for a pair of boxing gloves. A columnist in USA Today advised Americans to ignore the World Cup: \"Hating soccer is more American than Mom's apple pie, driving a pickup, or spending Saturday afternoons channel surfing....As someone who knows what real sports are, you are under no obligation to play footsie with the rest of the world.\" But it would be a pity if American armchair sportsmen were the odd ones out, miss- ing the soccer feast in their own backyard. Satellite signals will carry the soccer action from America to the farthest ends of the Earth this summer—to communal televisions in African jungle clearings in Cameroon; to the Royal Palace of King Juan Carlos in Spain; to Saudi Arabian souks; to the papal apartments in The Vatican (Pope John Paul II, a goalie in his youth, is a big soccer fan); and to the teeming shanty favelas of Brazil. Unfortunately, it's not yet in the national psyche to admire sportsmen who kick a ball with their feet. Even placekickers in the NFL are only allowed onto the field briefly. (Why that sport is called football is baffling to the rest of the world.) Americans have always favored sports where hand-eye coordination is paramount—whether it's a touchdown pass from Troy Aikman or a thunderdunk by Charles Barkley. Soccer is a very basic game. The object is to get possession of the ball, pass it up the field, using feet or head, and put it into your opponent's net. As the eccentric manager Brian Clough once said: \"God gave us grass for various reasons: for cows to eat and give us milk—and for soccer to be played on.\" As in any sport, there's no guarantee that every match will be exciting. The Russia teams can be as boring as a diet of borscht. Sometimes they can make 90 minutes of football seem like an entire Five-Year Plan. But with Brazil, Nigeria, Argentina, and the Indomitable Lions of Cameroon in the tournament, the unpredictable and magical will happen more often than not. For the best soccer players in the world, the big occasion will sharpen their reflexes and stimulate their skills. You'll kick yourself if you miss one kick of the action. And just think of the snob value. No other sport allows you to boast: \"Last night I watched the same game as the Pope and the King of Spain.\" —Joe Steeples, \"London Sunday Mirror\" goalie substitution) allowed, there wouldn't be anyone for them to talk to, anyway. An injury after the substitutions means the team plays shorthanded. But fans shouldn't worry if a favorite player falls down and doesn't immediately get up. Several players have perfected the art of the theatrical dive—while they stay down, winded teammates catch their breath and sip water. Soccer is the second-most popular kids' sport in this country (after basketball), but parents who know the game from watch- ing their daughters and sons play on Satur- TV GUIDE JUNE 18, 1994 day mornings will be startled by the feroci- ty on the field. \"What I think will surprise some people is how physical a game it is,\" Malin says. “I think there's a notion out there that it's a noncontact sport, kind of a namby-pamby sport played by soft Europeans. It's not.\" With 22 players on a field, it's hard to get up-close-and-personal, but TV execs are hoping some heroes will emerge (for possibilities, see boxes).

TV GUIDE: Were you disappointed that ABC isn't broadcasting any of the World Cup games in prime time? DR. HENRY KISSIN- GER: ABC wasn’t given the option. The sched- ule was set so the games could be shown live in prime time in Europe. If we played them during prime time here, it would be three o'clock in the morning in Europe. TVG: So, unlike the Olympic Games, Ameri- can TV didn't have any control over the sched- uling of play? HK: No. When Ameri- can TV can control the schedule, it will mean that we've done our job in making soccer as pop- ular here as it is else- where in the world. TVG: What have been your World Cup experiences in soccer-crazed countries? HK: I was at the final in Buenos Aires when Argentina was leading 1-0. Holland tied it up and in the last minute had a shot bounce off the goalpost. If that one had gone in, there could have been a rev- olution. But Argentina won in overtime, and there was such celebrating that I couldn't get out of the stadium. A heli- copter flew me out, or I think Td still be there.

And in World Cup, it’s not just one game—you have to play a couple of times a week for four weeks. TVG: Once we can’t root for America, which team is the most colorful to watch on TV? HK: Every town mourns when the Bra- zilians get eliminated—and the Brazilian fans leave. The Brazilians have fiestas in the streets. They don’t start riots—they just want to dance and have a good time. They're very friendly; there are no hooli- gans among the Brazilians. TVG: Are there any political implica- tions we can draw from the rise of the African teams? HK: From what I understand, the gov- ernments support soccer strongly, and it's one of the unifying elements in the African nation. The Africans, of course, are great athletes. They are very acrobat- ic. They play like the Brazilians did in the old days, which is to attack—and that's fun to watch. But the African teams T've seen have not been disciplined enough to play a strategic game toward the end of the match. TVG: Can you describe some other connections between soccer and national politics? HK: The Italian teams play absolutely strategic games. They play football the way Machiavelli conducted politics. They are beautiful to watch, but above all, they try to prevent scoring against themselves. The Germans won the World Cup in '90 and were in the final in '86 and '82. They have it all organized like it's the Schlieffen plan [of World War I military strategy]. 28 Their preparation is meticulous. They train like crazy, but if they get thrown off their game, they get depressed and melancholy. TVG: What about England, which didn’t make it to the World Cup this year? HK: England used to be the best team. I’m not saying that the decline of England's politics led to the decline of English soccer, but they didn't keep up with the times. The English style used to be the most ad- vanced, just as its industry was the most advanced. The English game became a little old-fashioned, so the very modern teams would usually beat them. TVG: If a soccer team reflects the na- tional style, how would you describe the American team? HK: There's no coherent American style because the good American players train with teams all over—in the Nether- lands, England, Germany. But this is our best team ever, and we have made good preparations. TVG: Some games can be tedious, low- scoring, and boring to watch. Will that tum Americans away? HK: The game has gotten very defen- sive, but there have been some rule changes that should help a little. TVG: Would high-scoring games make Americans like the sport? HK: Soccer hasn't been given a fair test because we've never had a competitive U.S. team. Everywhere else, there are club teams that play regularly and build strong loyalties. I don't know if baseball would be popular here if you only showed an occa- sional game that didn't matter. TVG: Will having the World Cup here be inspiring enough to Americans that there will be another attempt at forming a pro soccer league? HK: We're going to try.

HAIR & MAKEUP: THERESE Rising “Today star Matt Lauer will be even more visible in a new studio By MARK SCHOOFS t was a typical day on Today, NBC’s morning news show. Anchor Bryant Gumbel was winding up a segment on new and improved SATs, the dreaded college entrance ex- ams, and it was time to switch over to the news desk, manned by Today's newest member, Matt Lauer. “So, Matt,” Gumbel said, “what did you get on your SATs?” “I don't remember,” Lauer replied, grinning, “but I’m pretty sure it was the same as the guy sitting next to me.” The quip is vintage Lauer: spontaneous, funny, and slight- ly mischievous. \"Matt's kind of the boy next door,” says To- day co-anchor Katie Couric, “the kind of fellow you'd like to bring home to Mom, but not syrupy. There’s just enough bad boy in him to make him interesting.” And successful—so far. Lauer, 36, also co-anchors the lo- TV GUIDE JUNE 18, 1994 cal NBC morning news, Today in New York, which airs immediately before To- day. In the year and a half since Lauer started on the local show, its ratings have soared some 50 percent. People magazine recently named the square-jawed news- caster one of the year’s most beautiful people, and even the starched New York Times termed Lauer a “sex symbol.” No wonder industry mavens have dubbed him heir apparent to Gumbel. Already, Lauer sits in for Gumbel whenever the 12-year Today anchor can't make it. “Bryant will stay here as long as he wants to,” insists Today executive produc- er Steve Friedman. “But boy, it’s comfort- ing to have Matt there, it really is.” Lauer himself, however, can’t take too much comfort in his own success, promis- ing though it is. The behind-the-scenes history of the Today show reads like a thril- ler, full of clashing ambitions and stun- ning reversals, and Today is still locked in a brutal, seesaw contest with ABC's Good Morning America for top ratings in the high-stakes A.M. slot. In short, Lauer is dancing in a mine- field. Even his good looks could turn out to be a booby trap. On one hand Lauer's handsome mug is clearly an asset, attract- ing alot of viewers. Couric, who says she's known as a matchmaker, gets \"so many letters from women asking me if ГЇЇ set them up with Matt.\" And Lauer isn't just a ladies’ man—\"guys find him someone they could sit around a locker room with,\" says Couric. But on the other hand, that sex appeal could easily attract too much attention. Lauer has only the skimpiest journalistic credentials, exposing him to criticism that he was hired more for his looks than for his skills. ^I think he has to be careful,\" says Couric, “because any time so much emphasis is placed on your appearance, it can have the same effect that it has on women. You have to make sure that the impression is balanced out by real profes- sionalism, real ability, real substance. This isn’t asoap opera, it’s anews show.” Lauer admits he was nervous about the lack of “that big item on your résumé that jumps out in neon to say journalist with a capital J.” But producer Friedman shrugs off such concerns. “Over the past year, Matt has earned a lot of credibility with the audience,” he snaps, “and over the next year he'll earn a lot more.” Three years ago, Lauer was woefully underemployed, working just a day or two a week in a low-profile job for HBO. The only offers he and his agent were able to scrounge up were for infomercials and game shows—stuff Lauer describes as “cheesy.” Such rocky times were new for Lauer. His first job out of college was humble— a news producer in Huntington, W. Va.— but his star rose swiftly. For years he never had to hunt for a new job because, he says, \"jobs always came to me.\" He hosted P.M. Magazine in three different cities, and even co-hosted a live show in the Big Apple, 9 Broadcast Plaza. Then his career started sputtering. Five shows in a row were nixed after “embarrassingly short\" runs. He was ac- tually considering taking a job trimming trees one morning when his phone rang. It was NBC in New York, asking him to co-anchor the morning news. That quickly led to his other co-anchor slot on the Live at Five evening news, and then to his current post on Today. Working three different shows makes for a savage schedule. Lauer rises at 4 A.M. and an hour later arrives at the NBC stu- dios in Rockefeller Center (walking into the world-famous landmark still gives him a thrill). As soon as the local news winds up, Lauer dashes to the Today stu- 35 On June 20, Today moves to a new studio— a gleaming $15-miilion facility fronted by 100 linear feet of glass. “The competition can copy our format but they can't copy our view,” says executive producer Steve Friedman as he shows off the new space—which overlooks Rockefeller Plaza, with its gardens, ice rink and, at year's end, the world-famous Christmas tree. It's the interactive '90s: Three \"information kiosks\" outside on the street will enable passers-by to communicate with the show's hosts and guests by microphone or keyboard. But it's also the any- thing-can-happen '90s, so, should anything \"taste- less\" occur in full view, opaque panels and a heavy curtain can descend in 15 seconds. Viewers will also notice sleek new furniture and a tile floor emblazoned with a map of the world. Yet it's all a reinvention of the glass-walled, street-level studio introduced by NBC in 1952 (see photo). \"People want to be involved and we will let them,\" says Friedman, “whether it's holding up a sign or asking Vice President Gore or Jerry Seinfeld a question. We're in the се of a real place, das like David Letterman is. ўс. ртр т It’s a little dangerous, more exciting. It's a neck-and-neck race between Today and Good Morning Ameri- ca.\" Friedman, whose show has mostly been second to ABC's since 1990, adds, \"I expect this will put our neck ahead of theirs.\" —lleane Rudolph Today's Throwback Makeover dio, which used to be three flights down but now is six flights down and across the street (the step aerobics class he takes with Gumbel helps him make it without huffing). At 11, Lauer goes to his Manhat- tan home for a much-needed nap. He re- turns to the office at 3 to prepare for Live at Five, and finally goes home for good at 6. Soon afterward, he’s asleep. “Nine- 36 thirty is a late night for me,” he says. Tough schedule? It gets worse. On many weekends, Lauer flies halfway across the country to Waterloo, Iowa, to see Kristen Gesswein, the woman he’s been dating for four years. Worse still: Gess- wein, a reporter at an NBC af- filiate station, has to work weekends—‘so when I'm out there,” says Lauer, “I only get to see her for a few hours in the morning.” He sighs, “If we can get through this, we can get through anything.” You get the impression they'll pull through. Lauer is a man who likes simple plea- sures—golfing, barbecuing, | frolicking with his 3-year-old niece—and says he treasures family over career. “If you had to put your life on a pie graph, you gotta hope that your ca- reer would be the smaller sec- . * tion,” he says. That low-key attitude may be Lauer's most im- NE portant edge in his high- » flying career. He never ; takes things too serious- ly. Couric remembers a classic case, when Lauer was supposed to fill in for Gumbel the next day. To tease him, Couric zip- ped off an e-mail mes- sage, ribbing Lauer for not using his precious after- noon nap time to study for the show. Lauer sent a message back, insisting he had been studying. “I’m trying this new technique,\" he deadpanned, ^where I just put the research over my head as I sleep and hope that osmosis takes place.\" The show, of course, went off without a hitch. @ | Mark Schoofs is a freelance writer in New York.

Her tone is playful but £s obviously meant to preempt any snide comments that might accompany her re- turn to TV this week—as the host of sever- al interview specials on TNN: The Nashville Net- work—after an inglorious exit nine years ago. Until then, George had been on a roll with an im- pressive and sometimes unprecedented string of successes. After being crowned Miss America 1971, she became the first full-time female re- ~ 2 porter—and then co-host—of The NFL x27 Today for CBS Sports. Then came a М successful political Ше as First Lady ` of Kentucky, the wife of then-gover- nor John Y. Brown, with whom she had two children—son Lincoln and daughter Pamela. In 1985, however, when George was chosen to re- place Diane Sawyer as co- anchor of CBS Morning News, things took a down- turn. According to George, CBS executives assured her they wanted the show to be less news, more en- tertainment. But the for- mat stayed the same, and she was thrust into the daily grind of hard- news interviews, a move for which she was ill-prepared. | One morning, George interviewed N € “A Phyllis George Special” debuts Wednesday, ey June 22, at 8 PM./ET on TNN: The Nashville Network. 38 | y7 DEBOHAH FEINGOLD FOR TV GUIDE.

So did CBS News. “It was one of those tir- ed, spontaneous moments that sometimes just happen,” says George. “The interview was unscheduled and I was unprepared. As soon as the words were out, I thought, Oops, if I could just stuff that back in my mouth. But I couldnt. I think if Barbara Walters or a more seasoned reporter had said what I said, well, it would have been going out on a limb, but acceptable.” But it was unacceptable for Phyllis George. She left CBS News shortly after- ward and went back to Kentucky. So why return now? “This time,” she says, “Tve found the right formula—cable. It fits my lifestyle. Its not high-pressure. I can fly to a location for a day or two and then come home and be with my children.” In her first special, featuring country star Naomi Judd and father-and-son auto racers Richard and Kyle Petty, George is friendly, not tough. “I want to catch people not off guard, but with their guard down,” she says. \"That's a very important differ- ence.” But the stunner is that George also interviews President Bill Clinton. “My husband and Bill were freshman governors together,” she explains. \"We've known the Clintons for years—Hillary and I were pregnant with Chelsea and Lincoln at the same time.” When George's produc- TV GUIDE JUNE 18, 1994 Nine years after a controversial exit, Phyllis George returns to ТҮ on her own terms er discovered that Clinton was going to be at the Char- lotte Motor Speedway dur- ing the talk with the Pettys, George called the White Чо and requested ап in- terview with the President. “Within an hour, we had him.

We talked about a lot of personal stuff—life in the White House, the pressures of the Presidency, parenting a teenager. I can't believe Pm the parent of a teenager.\" There have been rumors that George's marriage is shaky, and she and Brown are living apart as he works on a business ven- ture in Florida. But she says it's for the children. \"We moved down there with him, but I feel so strongly that kids need place, you know? Roots. So we moved back and John commutes. We're not happy about it, but what can you do?\" George makes no excuses and isn't worried about being back in television. “Гуе never felt that what happened at CBS News was a failure. It was a learning ex- perience. At first it hurt me, but I’m not a quitter. If saying, 'Why don't you give her a hug?’ is the worst thing I’m known for, hey, I can live with it.” | —Hilary Cosell 39 SCI-F/FANT/ Dy Glenn Kenny The Ghost with the most \"This is not really a talk show,” says Mi- chael Lazzo, executive producer of the Cartoon Network's Space Ghost: Coast to Coast. ^Well, it is, but it's a talk show from outer space.\" Lazzo's confusion is under- standable. To put it mildly, Space Ghost (Fridays at 11 РМ./ЕТ) is the damnedest thing to hit television since SCTV's Count Floyd had “the kid from ‘Deliverance’ \" as a guest on his Christmas special. The concept of the show is, um, simple. ix. Space Ghost, that schlocky animated su- perhero from the '60s, sits behind an in- terviewer's desk and chats with live-action guests who appear on a video monitor. His technique is unorthodox, to say the least, often beginning by asking guests such as Dr. Joyce Brothers or former Partridge Family star Danny Bonaduce, “What’s your true form? Do you have a se- cret identity?\" Opening-show guest Susan Powter—the buzz-cut blonde of “Stop the Insanity” infomercial fame—respond- ed that she was, in fact, a man. Stop the insanity, indeed. Space Ghost is replete with cosmic in-jokes and bizarre interludes. In one episode, the action was repeatedly interrupted by a pleasant fe- male voice translating bits of dialogue into 40 RA 4 Sally the work of underground gui- Start the insanity: Space Ghost interviews Susan Powter. ^N f Spanish. “That was the work of a young woman on our writing staff for whom Spanish class was a childhood trauma,” notes Lazzo drolly. “Those segments were part of her therapy.” More wackiness is contributed by Space Ghost's sidekicks, who, oddly enough, are incarnated by his old enemies. Leading the house band is the locust Zorack, and at the video controls is the helmeted Mol- tar. They're assisting Space Ghost against their will, of course, and Lazzo promises that on future episodes they'll be wreak- «ing some serious havoc. i: As for the careening guitar rock ЁС that emanates from Zorack's band, ба > the Original Way Outs, that's actu- tar legend Sonny Sharrock. “So much music associated with sci-fi is done with keyboards and elec- tronics, which is kind of cliché,” says Lazzo. “I've been a big fan of | Sonny's for years—he can be disso- nant and melodic at the same time, and very out there—and when we approached him to do the show, = he was into it.” The Cartoon Net- work has even put out a six-song CD sampler of Sharrock's music for the show, and the end credits exhort viewers to “Support the genius of Sonny Shar- rock,\" although, sadly, Sharrock passed away on May 26 at age 53. While some celebs are understandably wary of undergoing the Space Ghost treat- ment, the show has developed such a hip cachet that a good number of quirky stars have asked to appear. \"We just scheduled David Byrne, who called ws,” reports Lazzo proudly. \"We've also been approach- ed by [alternative rock band] Sonic Youth, which we hope will happen soon.\" And while Space Ghost has thus far used his cheesy reverb voice on only one or two occasions, Lazzo promises it will happen again soon.

Over the last several years, such sexual vio- lators as General Hos- pital’s Luke Spencer, Another World’s Jake McKinnon, and Days of Our Lives’ Bill Hor- ton, Lawrence Alamain, and Jack Deveraux were each redeemed at the feverish behest of ME fans and allowed to tri- umph as heartthrobs. It’s really quite a phe- nomenon. And the most Roger Howarth of “One Life to Live.” interesting—and extreme —case study is occurring before our eyes on One Life to Live, where Todd Manning—rapist, sadist, psychopath, killer—now bears a new badge: dream- boat. As played by the dy- namic Roger Howarth (who won a much-deserv- ed Emmy last month), Todd recently saved the lives of three Llanview cit- izens—two young kids and Marty Saybrooke, the woman he violated last summer during a drunken fraternity gang rape. “This guy started out as Rapist Number One and has gone on to huge piles of fan mail—for months we've had young women standing outside the studio 42 screaming ‘Todd! Todd!’ whenever Roger walked out of the building,” re- ports One Life to Live head writer Michael Ma- lone, who along with his writing team won a '94 Emmy for the powerfully crafted rape saga. \"The day Todd rescued Marty, the phones started to ring —fans were calling to say he should be pardoned.\" The religious symbol- ism cannot be dismissed. Not only did Todd's beard- ed, bloody, long-haired visage remind us of Jeff- rey Hunter's portrayal of the crucified Christ in \"King of Kings,\" but the character's religious-fa- natic girlfriend, Rebecca, is played by Reiko Ayles- worth, a fleshy, exotic, kinky-haired actress who looks like every Mary Mag- dalene Hollywood ever turned out. What's more, Todd— who has survived scissor- stabbing, subzero waters, lethal drug doses, and sev- eral bullets—has an infi- nite ability to resurrect himself. But Malone, who is also an acclaimed novelist, places the zroot of Todds appeal 2 elsewhere. . \"The bond between ^the woman and the vio- lator is a great, histori- cal tradition in fiction and in films,\" he says. \"Rudolph Valentino, Humphrey Bogart, ONNA ERES Kirk Douglas, and Clark Gable all began as totally irredeemable villains, but the audi- ence perceived them as something different. It is a testament to the re- markable ability of [Ho- warth] that he is able to present the pain behind the villainy and rage.\" Still, Malone concedes \"there is something trou- blesome in the response [of female viewers]. You certainly don't want to say that these women want to be raped or that they are drawn to violence, be- cause that's not true. But they are responding to the intensity of passion and an actor who lets you in- side the torment. Some [women] believe they can be swept up in that pas- sion and still turn it good. They think, ‘With me, he'd be different.’” 8 TV GUIDE JUNE 18, 1994 > ' š Е rn > реу ; „а ДА? W Vm ii ecd е7: - = E y? y $5 СР Бы > 4 .

This weekend's U.S. Open finale from the Oakmont Country Club outside Pittsburgh (ABC, Saturday, June 18, 1:30 P.M./ET; Sunday, June 19, 1:30 P.M.) delivers that in spades. What’s more, Oakmont is as much of a test for ABC’s production team as it is for defending champion Lee Janzen and the oth- er PGA stars. ABC producer Terry Jastrow plans to use 30 cameras, some shuttling about, to cover 80 posi- tions. He points out that the greens are “exceed- ingly fast” with “undula- tion leading into hazards.” What's more: \"The greens fall away from front to back, forcing the players to deal with added pres- sure.\" Getting those nu- ances across on the small screen is no small feat. \"You need a three-di- mensional look and TV is a two-dimensional medium,\" says direc- tor Jim Jennett. \"Golf is traditionally covered from high camera angles that flatten the greens. That's especially so on a course lined with huge trees, which cut down sight lines. So we use pretaped heli- copter shots and three 100-foot cranes.\" Given the popularity of golf software for computers and game machines, one wonders if ABC could employ more high- tech graphics to illustrate course charac- teristics. Jennett says no. \"We've been looking at computer modeling of greens, but haven't yet found the perfect applica- 1993 champion Lee Janzen faces a tough course at this years Open. tion for our telecasts—and we don't want to become too technical.\" Jennett says his crew will go for lower camera angles on some of the greens, and Steve Melnyk will trace out Oak- mont’s irregular breaks on the Telestrator. “We'll also insert the player's face in the corner of the screen, watching and react- ing as his ball rolls.\" One factor that should be smooth and steady during the telecast is host Brent Musburger, coming into his own han- ? dling golf at ABC after a £ rough start two years ago. 5Musburger seems gen- uinely to enjoy the game now. He no longer makes birdie putts sound like goal-line stands, and he's been doing his homework. Walking through Oak- mont with Janzen a few weeks back, Musburger was struck by winter's ef- fect on the course: “Par is a real good score here.\" Musburger calls Greg Norman the \"odds-on fa- $ vorite,\" even though he dropped the Memorial to Tom Lehman. Musburger notes that foreign pros, in- cluding Nick Faldo, are playing below their best these days. And he says that while John Daly has come back from his battle with the bottle, ^he has a game that's not suited for the Open.\" What sort of Open drama will unfold on this course? Jastrow, who's been senior producer since 1988, wouldn't mind a re- peat of the '92 Open from Pebble Beach, when PGA veteran Tom Kite (finally) won. \"I grew up playing golf with Tom in Texas,\" says Jastrow. Aha...another subtlety to look for: ABC shooting Kite from more favorable cam- era angles than the other golfers. @ TV GUIDE JUNE 18, 1994 E La ань ЧИШ Buy ONE PAIR OF GLASSES Buy one complete pair of prescription glasses (frame and lenses) from our huge selection of famous brand names.
