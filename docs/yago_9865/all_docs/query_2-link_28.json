Here they are now arranged according to the series in which they are grouped for release on DVD box sets in the UK (which is the same as at IMDb, and which may be the same as production order), as that is what is likely to be of most use now. The UK broadcast order has to be determined from the dates given; broadcast order in other territories may differ again, as may grouping for DVD box sets.\n\nThe episodes continue to be released on DVD round the world. As of August 2012:\n\nEpisodes 1 to 89 are out on Region 2 PAL disks in the UK\n\nEpisodes 1 to 81 are out on Region 1 NTSC disks in N America (82-85 probably due out in Fall 2012)\n\nEpisodes 1 to 89 are out on Region 4 PAL disks in Australia\n\nSome novels by Caroline Graham on which the series is based are: The Killings at Badger's Drift [1987], Death of a Hollow Man [1989], Death in Disguise [1992], Written in Blood [1994], Faithful Unto Death [1996], A Place of Safety [1999], and Death's Shadow [?].\n\nThere is a behind-the-scenes book, Midsomer Murders [2003], by Jeff Evans."
