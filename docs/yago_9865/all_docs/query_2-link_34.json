Twelve episodes were made (two series, each of six episodes). The show was written by John Cleese and his then wife Connie Booth, both of whom also starred in the show.\n\nThe series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the \"English Riviera\". The plots centre around tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), a comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs) and their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.\n\nIn a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.[1]\n\nOrigins[]\n\nIn May 1971 the Monty Python team stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel (which is referred to in \"The Builders\" episode) in Torquay whilst filming on location.[2] John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, whom Cleese later described as \"the rudest man I've ever come across in my life.\" [3] This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive;[citation needed] and placing Eric Idle's briefcase (put to one side by Idle while waiting for a car with Cleese) behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (Sinclair explained his actions, by claiming the hotel had 'staff problems').[4] He also criticised the American-born Terry Gilliam's table manners for not being \"British\" (that is, he switched hands with his fork whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of the hotel owner. Cleese later played a hotel owner called Donald Sinclair in the 2001 movie Rat Race.\n\nAt the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom Doctor in the House for London Weekend Television. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode (\"No Ill Feeling\") of the third Doctor series (titled Doctor at Large). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.[5] Cleese parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, Video Arts.\n\nCleese said in 2008 that the first Fawlty Towers script, written with then wife Connie Booth, was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th-anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,\n\nPage Template:Blockquote/styles.css must have content model \"Sanitized CSS\" for TemplateStyles (current model is \"wikitext\").\n\n\"Connie and I wrote that first episode and we sent it in to Jimmy Gilbert,\" the executive \"whose job it was to assess the quality of the writing said, and I can quote [his note to me] fairly accurately, 'This is full of clichéd situations and stereotypical characters and I cannot see it as being anything other than a disaster.' And Jimmy himself said, 'You're going to have to get them out of the hotel, John, you can't do the whole thing in the hotel.' Whereas, of course, it's in the hotel that the whole pressure cooker builds up.\"[6]\n\nCleese was paid £6,000 for 43 weeks' work and supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements.[6][7]\n\nBill Cotton, the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said[citation needed] after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC's relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead.[citation needed] He said that the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, would never have let the programme get to the production stage on the basis of the scripts.[citation needed]\n\nProduction[]\n\nAlthough the series is set in Torquay in Devon, no part of it was shot in south west England. For the exterior filming, the Wooburn Grange Country Club in Buckinghamshire was used instead of a hotel.[8][9] In several episodes of the series (notably \"The Kipper and the Corpse\", \"The Anniversary\" and \"Basil the Rat\") the entrance gate at the bottom of the drive states the real name of the location. This listed building later served as a nightclub named \"Basil's\" for a short time after the series ended before being destroyed by a fire in March 1991.[10][11] The remnants of the building were demolished and a housing estate was built on the site.[12] Other location filming was done mostly around Harrow, notably the 'damn good thrashing' scene in \"Gourmet Night\" where Basil loses his temper and attacks his car with a tree branch which was filmed at the T-junction of Lapstone Gardens and Mentmore Close (\n\nFatal error: The format of the coordinate could not be determined. Parsing failed.\n\n). In the episode \"The Germans\", the opening shot is of Northwick Park Hospital. In the episode \"Gourmet Night\", the exterior of Andre's restaurant was filmed on Preston Road in the Harrow area (\n\nFatal error: The format of the coordinate could not be determined. Parsing failed.\n\n). The launderette next door to the restaurant still exists today and Andre's is now a Chinese restaurant called \"Wings\".\n\nCleese and Booth were husband and wife at the time of the first series. By the second, they had been divorced for almost a year, having ended their ten year marriage in 1978.[13]\n\nBoth Cleese and Booth were keen on every script being perfect, and some episodes took four months and required ten drafts until they were satisfied.[14]\n\nThe names of Basil and Sybil Fawlty are thought to have originated from Oscar Wilde's novel The Picture of Dorian Gray.[citation needed]\n\nThe first series was produced and directed by John Howard Davies; the second was produced by Douglas Argent and directed by Bob Spiers.\n\nThe series theme music was written by Dennis Wilson and was inspired by Ludwig van Beethoven's Minuet in G major.\n\nPlot directions and examples[]\n\nThe series focuses on the exploits and misadventures of short-fused hotelier Basil Fawlty, his wife Sybil and their employees, porter and waiter Manuel, maid Polly, and (in the second series) chef Terry. The episodes typically revolve around Basil's efforts to succeed in 'raising the tone' of his hotel and his increasing frustration at the numerous complications and mistakes, both his own and those of others, which prevent him from doing so. Much of the humour comes from Basil's overly aggressive manner, engaging in angry but witty arguments with guests, staff and in particular his formidable wife, whom he addresses (in a faux-romantic way) with insults such as \"that golfing puff adder\", \"my little piranha fish\" and \"my little nest of vipers\". Despite this, he frequently feels intimidated, she being able to stop him in his tracks at any time, usually with a short, sharp cry of \"Basil!\" At the end of some episodes, Basil succeeds in annoying (or at least bemusing) the guests and frequently gets his comeuppance.\n\nThe plots are occasionally intricate and always farcical, involving coincidences, misunderstandings, cross-purposes and meetings both missed and accidental. The innuendo of the bedroom farce is sometimes present (often to the disgust of the socially conservative Basil) but it is his eccentricity, not his lust, that drives the plots. The events test what little patience Basil has to the breaking point, sometimes causing him to have a near total breakdown by the end of the episode.\n\nThe guests at the hotel are typically comic foils to Basil's anger and outbursts. Each episode's one-shot guest characters provide a different characteristic that he cannot stand (including promiscuity, or being working class or foreign). Requests both reasonable and impossible test his temper. Even the afflicted seem to annoy him, with the episode \"Communication Problems\" revolving around the havoc caused by the frequent misunderstandings between the staff and the hard-of-hearing Mrs Richards. By the end, Basil faints just at the mention of her name. This episode is typical of the show's careful weaving of humorous situations through comedy cross-talk. The show also uses mild black humour at times, notably when Basil is forced to hide a dead body and in Basil's comments about Sybil (\"Did you ever see that film, How to Murder Your Wife? ... Awfully good. I saw it six times.\") and to the guests (\"May I suggest that you consider moving to a hotel closer to the sea? Or preferably in it.\").\n\nBasil's physical outbursts are primarily directed at the waiter Manuel, an emotional but largely innocent Spaniard whose confused English vocabulary causes him to make elementary mistakes. At times, Basil beats Manuel with a frying pan and smacks his forehead with a spoon. (The violence towards Manuel caused rare negative criticism of the show.) Sybil, on the other hand, is always condescending towards Manuel, excusing his behaviour to guests with \"He's from Barcelona.\"\n\nBasil often displays blatant snobbishness in order to climb the social ladder, frequently expressing disdain for the \"riff-raff\", \"cretins\" and \"yobbos\" that he believes to regularly populate his hotel. His desperation is readily apparent, as he makes increasingly hopeless manoeuvres and painful faux pas in trying to curry favour with those he perceives having superior social status. Yet, he finds himself forced to serve those individuals that are \"beneath\" him. As such, Basil's efforts tend to be counter-productive, with guests leaving the hotel in disgust and his marriage (and sanity) stretching to breaking point.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nBasil Fawlty[]\n\nBasil Fawlty, played by John Cleese, is a snobbish and miserly misanthrope who is desperate to belong to a higher social class. He sees a successful hotel as a means of achieving this (\"turn it into an establishment of class...\") yet his job forces him to be pleasant to people he despises.\n\nHe is terrified of his wife Sybil Fawlty. He yearns to stand up to her, but his plans frequently conflict with her demands. She is often verbally abusive (memorably describing him as \"an ageing, brilliantined stick insect\") but although he towers over her, he often finds himself on the receiving end of her temper, verbally and physically (as in \"The Builders\"). Basil usually turns to Manuel or Polly to help him with his schemes, while trying his best to keep Sybil from discovering them. However, Basil occasionally laments the time when there was passion in their relationship, now seemingly lost. Also, it appears that he still does care for her, and actively resists the flirtations of a French guest in one episode. The penultimate episode, \"The Anniversary\", is about his efforts to put together a surprise anniversary party, involving their closest friends. Things go wrong as Basil pretends the anniversary date doesn't remind him of anything, just to enhance the surprise (even accepting a slap in the process). Sybil believes he really forgot and leaves in a huff. In an interview in the DVD box set, Cleese claims that this episode deliberately takes a slightly different tone from the others, fleshing out their otherwise inexplicable status as a couple (as well as saying that, if a third series had been made, there would have been similar episodes).\n\nIn keeping with the lack of explanation about the marriage, not much is revealed of the characters' back-stories. It is known that Basil served in the British Army and saw action in the Korean War, possibly as part of his National Service. (John Cleese was only 13 when the Korean War ended.) Basil exaggerates this period of his life, proclaiming to strangers: \"I killed four men.\" To this Sybil jokes that \"He was in the Catering Corps. He used to poison them.\" Basil is often seen wearing a military tie (similar to the East Lancs Regiment and the Royal Agricultural College), and his moustache seems to betray an Army background. He also claims to have sustained a shrapnel injury to his leg; it tends to flare up at suspiciously convenient times. The only person Basil consistently exhibits patience and decent manners towards is old and senile Major Gowen, a veteran officer of one of the World Wars (which one is never specified) who permanently resides at the hotel. When interacting with Manuel, Basil displays a rudimentary ability with Spanish (Basil states that he \"learned classical Spanish, not the strange dialect he [Manuel] seems to have picked up\" (presumably Catalan; Manuel is from Barcelona)); this ability is also ridiculed, as in the first episode where a guest, whom Basil has immediately dismissed as working-class, communicates fluently with Manuel in Spanish after Basil is unable to do so.\n\nCleese described Basil as thinking that \"he could run a first-rate hotel if he didn't have all the guests getting in the way\", and as being \"an absolutely awful human being\", but says that in comedy, if an awful person makes people laugh, people unaccountably feel affectionate toward him.[15] Indeed, he is not entirely unsympathetic. The \"Hotel Inspectors\" and \"Gourmet Night\" episodes feature guests who are shown to be deeply annoying with constant, and unreasonable demands. In \"Gourmet Night\", the chef gets drunk and is unable to cook dinner, leaving Basil to scramble in an attempt to salvage the evening. Much of the time, Basil is an unfortunate victim of circumstance.\n\nSybil Fawlty[]\n\nSybil Fawlty, played by Prunella Scales, is Basil's wife. Energetic and petite, she prefers a working wardrobe of tight skirt suits in shiny fabrics and sports a tower of permed hair necessitating the use of overnight curlers. She is often a more effective manager of the hotel, making sure Basil gets certain jobs done or stays out of the way when she is handling difficult guests. Despite this, she rarely participates directly in the running of the hotel; during busy check-in sessions or meal-times, while everyone else is busy working, she is frequently talking on the phone to one of her friends with her phrase \"Oohhh, I knoooooooow\", or chatting to customers. She has a distinctive conversational tone and braying laugh, which her husband compares to \"someone machine-gunning a seal\". Being his wife, she is the only regular character who refers to Basil by his first name. When she barks his name at him, he flinchingly freezes in his tracks.\n\nBasil refers to her by a number of epithets, occasionally to her face, including \"that golfing puff-adder\", \"the dragon\", \"toxic midget\", \"the sabre-toothed tart\", \"my little kommandant\", \"my little piranha fish\", \"my little nest of vipers\", and \"you rancorous, coiffured old sow\". Despite these less than complimentary nicknames, Basil is terrified of her. There is only one time that he loses patience and snaps at her (Basil: \"Shut up, I'm fed up.\" Sybil: \"Oh you've done it now.\").\n\nSybil and Basil Fawlty are said[where?] to have married on 17 April 1958 and started their hotel in 1960. Prunella Scales speculated in an interview for The Complete Fawlty Towers DVD box set that Sybil married Basil because his origins were of a higher social class than hers.\n\nPolly Sherman[]\n\nPolly Sherman, played by Connie Booth, is a waitress and general helper at the hotel. She is the most competent of the hotel's staff and the voice of sanity during chaotic moments, but is frequently embroiled in ridiculous masquerades as she loyally attempts to aid Basil in trying to cover a mistake or keep something from Sybil.\n\nIn \"The Anniversary\" she snaps and refuses to help Basil out when he wants her to impersonate Sybil in semi-darkness in front of the Fawltys' friends, Basil having dug himself into a hole by claiming Sybil was ill instead of admitting that she had stormed out earlier. Polly only finally agrees on condition that he lends her money to purchase a car, which he has previously refused to do.\n\nPolly is generally good-natured but sometimes shows her frustration, and has odd moments of malice. In \"The Kipper and the Corpse\", the pampered shih-tzu dog of an elderly guest bites Polly and Manuel. As revenge Polly laces the dog's sausages with hot pepper, chilli powder and Tabasco sauce (\"bangers a la bang\"), making it ill.\n\nDespite her part-time employment (during meal times), Polly is frequently saddled with many other duties, including manager in \"The Germans\" when Sybil and Basil are both incapacitated. In the first series Polly is said to be an art student who, according to Basil, has spent three years at university. In one episode, she is seen to draw a sketch (presumably an impressionistic caricature) of Basil, which everyone but Basil immediately recognises. Polly is not referred to as a student in the second series, although in both series she is shown to have a flair for languages, displaying ability in both Spanish and German. In \"The Germans\" Basil alludes to Polly's polyglot inclination by saying that she does her work \"while learning two oriental languages\". Like Manuel, she has a room of her own at the hotel.\n\nManuel[]\n\nManuel, a waiter played by Andrew Sachs, is a well-meaning but disorganised and confused Spaniard from Barcelona with a poor grasp of the English language and customs. He is verbally and physically abused by his boss. When told what to do, he often answers, \"¿Qué?\" (\"What?\"). Manuel's character is used to demonstrate Basil's instinctive lack of sensitivity and tolerance. Every episode involves Basil becoming enraged at Manuel's confusion at his boss's bizarre demands and even basic requests. Manuel is afraid of Fawlty's quick temper and violent assaults, yet often expresses his appreciation for being given employment. He is relentlessly enthusiastic and is proud of what little English he knows.\n\nDuring the series, Sachs was twice seriously injured while playing Manuel. Cleese describes using a real metal pan to knock him unconscious in \"The Wedding Party\", although he would have preferred to use a rubber one. The original producer/director, John Howard Davies, explains that he made Basil use a metal one and that he was responsible for most of the violence on the show, which he felt was essential to the type of comical farce that they were creating. Later, when his clothes were treated to give off smoke after he escapes the burning kitchen in \"The Germans\", the corrosive chemicals ate through them and gave Sachs severe burns.[16]\n\nManuel's exaggerated Spanish accent is part of the humour of the show. The actor Andrew Sachs's original language is German; he immigrated to Britain as a child.[17]\n\nThe character's nationality was switched to Italian (and the name to Paolo) for the Spanish dub of the show, while in Catalonia Manuel is a Mexican.[18]\n\nOther regular characters and themes[]\n\nTerry Hugh, played by Brian Hall, is the sly, somewhat shifty Cockney chef at Fawlty Towers.[19] Terry's cooking methods are somewhat casual, which frustrates and worries the neurotic Basil. He appears in only the second series of episodes. Terry used to work in Dorchester (not at The Dorchester, as believed by a guest). In \"The Anniversary\" Terry and Manuel come to blows since he doesn't like anyone else cooking in his kitchen, and he proceeds to sabotage the paella Manuel is making for Sybil, leading to fisticuffs at the end of the episode. Cleese himself told actor Hall to portray Terry as if he were on the run from the police.\n\nMajor Gowen, played by Ballard Berkeley, is a slightly senile, amiable old soldier who is a permanent resident at the hotel.[20][21] He is one of the few guests whom Basil seems to like. This is because of his former military status, making him a symbol of the establishment status that Basil craves. He is often introduced as their \"oldest resident\". He enjoys talking about the world outside, especially the cricket scores and workers' strikes, and is always on the lookout for the newspaper. In the episode \"The Germans\", he shows that he has trouble forgiving the Germans because of the wars; the best he can say is that German women make good card players. In the same episode, he also demonstrates his outdated racial attitudes when he comments about the ethnic difference between \"wogs\" and \"niggers\" — but in a manner innocent of malice or bigotry. Despite his good intentions, the Major can cause Basil's plans to go awry, notably in the episode \"Communication Problems\", when Basil tries his best to keep the money he won in a bet a secret from Sybil.\n\nMiss Tibbs & Miss Gatsby, played by Gilly Flower and Renee Roberts respectively, are the other two permanent residents. Seemingly inseparable, these sweet-natured, dotty spinsters appear to have taken a fancy to Basil, feeling that they need to take care of him. In response Basil vacillates between superficial charm and blunt rudeness during his conversations with them.[20][21][22][23][24][25]\n\nAudrey has one on-screen appearance in \"The Anniversary\". Audrey is Sybil's lifelong best friend, and is mostly acknowledged during gossipy telephone calls to Sybil. Talking with Audrey is a refuge for Sybil. When times get tough (Audrey has a dysfunctional relationship with her husband George), Sybil will offer solutions and guidance, often resulting in the catchphrase \"Ohhh, I knowwww...\" when she tries to commiserate with Audrey's problems. In Audrey's one on-screen appearance she is played by actress Christine Shaw.\n\nThe Paperboy, though rarely seen, is revealed to be the prankster who rearranges the letters on the \"Fawlty Towers\" sign to sometimes crude phrases.[26] The shot of the hotel's sign appears at the beginning of every episode but one, \"The Germans\", when a hospital is used, since it is the only episode which does not begin at the hotel. During the first series, the sign loses letters each episode; episode five brings the first anagram, \"Warty Towels\". In the second series, the first episode sign correctly spells 'Fawlty Tower', but changes in each subsequent episode, from the correct spelling to various anagrams. 'Flowery Twats' is the only complete anagram, using all the letters.\n\nThe sign changes as follows:\n\nEpisode 1: \"Fawlty Towers\" (the letter \"S\" is askew)\n\nEpisode 2: \"Fawlty Tower\" (the letter \"L\" is askew)\n\nEpisode 3: \"Fawty Tower\" (the letter \"W\" is askew)\n\nEpisode 4: \"Fawty Toer\"\n\nEpisode 5: \"Warty Towels\"\n\nEpisode 7: \"Fawlty Tower\" (the letter \"L\" is askew)\n\nEpisode 8: \"Watery Fowls\"\n\nEpisode 9: \"Flay Otters\"\n\nEpisode 10: \"Fatty Owls\"\n\nEpisode 11: \"Flowery Twats\"\n\nEpisode 12: \"Farty Towels\"\n\nGuest characters[]\n\nFurther information: List of guest characters in Fawlty Towers and guest characters\n\nEpisodes[]\n\nSeries Episodes Originally aired DVD release date Series premiere Series finale Region 1 Region 2 1 6 19 September 1975 ( ) 24 October 1975 (1975-10-24) 16 October 2001 ( )[27] 8 October 2001 ( )[28][29] 2 6 19 February 1979 ( ) 25 October 1979 (1979-10-25)\n\nThe first edition of Fawlty Towers was originally broadcast on 19 September 1975. The 12th and final show was first shown on 25 October 1979. The first series was directed by John Howard Davies, the second by Bob Spiers. Both series had their premieres on BBC2.\n\nProduction of the last two episodes was disrupted by a strike of BBC technical staff, which resulted in the recasting of the role of Roger (the wisecracking friend of Basil and Sybil) in \"The Anniversary\", and delayed the episode's transmission date by one week. The episode \"Basil the Rat\" was also delayed, not being screened until the end of a repeat showing six months later.\n\nNot the Nine O'Clock News was originally scheduled to debut after an episode of Fawlty Towers and Cleese (in character as Basil Fawlty) was to have introduced Not the Nine O'Clock News in a sketch referring to the technicians' strike, explaining that there was no show ready that week, so a \"tatty revue\" would be broadcast instead. However, the 1979 general election intervened, and Not the Nine O'Clock News was postponed as being too political. Later that year, Cleese's sketch was broadcast, but its original significance was lost.\n\nWhen originally transmitted, the individual episodes had no on-screen titles. The ones in common currency were first used for the VHS release of the series in the 1980s. There were working titles, such as \"USA\" for \"Waldorf Salad\", \"Death\" for \"The Kipper and the Corpse\", and \"Rat\" for \"Basil the Rat\", which have been printed in some programme guides. In addition, some of the early BBC audio releases of episodes on vinyl and cassette included other variations, such as \"Mrs. Richards\" and \"The Rat\" for \"Communication Problems\" and \"Basil the Rat\" respectively.\n\nIt has long been rumoured that a thirteenth episode of the series was written and filmed, but never progressed further than a rough cut.[30] Lars Holger Holm, author of the book Fawlty Towers: A Worshipper's Companion, has made detailed claims about the episode's content, but he provides no evidence of its existence and it is most likely a hoax or fan fiction.\n\nOn the subject of whether more episodes would be produced, Cleese revealed (in an interview for the complete DVD box set, which was republished in the book, Fawlty Towers Fully Booked) that he once had the genesis of a feature-length special – possibly sometime during the mid-1990s. The plot (which was never fleshed out beyond his initial idea) would have revolved around the chaos that a now-retired Basil typically caused as he and Sybil flew to Barcelona to visit their former employee Manuel and his family. Of the idea, Cleese said:\n\nWe had an idea for a plot which I loved. Basil was finally invited to Spain to meet Manuel's family. He gets to Heathrow and then spends about 14 frustrating hours waiting for the flight. Finally, on the plane, a terrorist pulls a gun and tries to hijack the thing. Basil is so angry he overcomes the terrorist and when the pilot says, \"We have to fly back to Heathrow\", Basil says, \"No, fly us to Spain or I'll shoot you\". He arrives in Spain, immediately arrested and spends the entire holiday in a Spanish jail. He is released just in time to go back on the plane with Sybil. It was very funny, but I couldn't do it at the time. Making Fawlty Towers work at 90 minutes was a very difficult proposition. You can build up the comedy for 30 minutes, but at that length there has to be a trough and another peak. It doesn't interest me. I don't want to do it.\n\nCleese may also have relented because of the lack of Connie Booth's involvement. She had practically retreated from public life after the show finished (and had been initially unwilling to collaborate on a second series, which explains the four-year gap between productions).\n\nThe decision by Cleese and Booth to quit before a third series has often been lauded, as it ensured the show's successful status wouldn't be weakened with later, lower-quality work. Subsequently, it has inspired the makers of other shows to do likewise. Most notably, Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant refused to make a third series of either The Office or Extras, citing Fawlty Towers' short lifespan. Rik Mayall, Ben Elton and Lise Mayer, the writers behind The Young Ones, which also ran for only two series (each with six episodes), used this explanation too. Elton also took the decision to end his next sitcom, Filthy Rich & Catflap, after only one series, despite its popularity. Victoria Wood also indicated this influenced her decision to limit dinnerladies to just 16 episodes over two series.\n\nSeries 1 (1975)[]\n\nSeries No. Episode No. Title Sign reads Original air date 11\"A Touch of Class\"FAWLTY TOWERS (Crooked S)19 September 1975 ( )\n\nAs Basil tries to raise the tone of the hotel, the aristocratic Lord Melbury comes to stay at the hotel.

The Daily Mirror review of the show in 1975 had the headline \"Long John Short On Jokes\".[31] Eventually though, as the series began to gain popularity, critical acclaim soon followed. Clive James writing in The Observer said the second episode had him \"retching with laughter\".[32] By the time the series had ended, it was an overwhelming critical success.\n\nOne critic of the show was Richard Ingrams, then television reviewer for The Spectator. Cleese got his revenge by naming one of the guests in the second series 'Mr Ingrams', who is caught in his room with a blow-up doll.[31]\n\nIn an interview for the \"TV Characters\" edition of Channel 4's 'talking heads' strand 100 Greatest (in which Basil placed second, between Homer Simpson and Edmund Blackadder), TV critic A. A. Gill theorised that the initially muted response may have been caused by Cleese seemingly ditching his label as a comic revolutionary – earned through his years with Python – to do something more traditional.\n\nIn a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was placed first. It was also voted fifth in the BBC's \"Britain's Best Sitcom\" poll in 2004,[33] and second only to Frasier in The Ultimate Sitcom poll of comedy writers in January 2006. Basil Fawlty came top of the Britain's Funniest Comedy Character poll, held by Five on 14 May 2006. In 1997, \"The Germans\" was ranked No. 12 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time.[34]\n\nAwards[]\n\nThree BAFTAs were awarded to people for their involvement with the series. Each of the two series was awarded the BAFTA in the category for \"Best Situation Comedy\", the first won by John Howard Davies in 1976, and the second by Douglas Argent and Bob Spiers in 1980. John Cleese won the BAFTA for \"Best Light Entertainment Performance\" in 1976.[35]\n\nRemakes and reunions[]\n\nThree attempted remakes of Fawlty Towers were started for the American market, with two making it into production. The first, Chateau Snavely starring Harvey Korman and Betty White, was produced by ABC for a pilot in 1978, but the transfer from coastal hotel to highway motel proved too much and the series was never produced. The second, also by ABC, was Amanda's starring Bea Arthur, notable for switching the sexes of its 'Basil' and 'Sybil' equivalents. It also failed to pick up a major audience and was dropped.[36] A third remake called Payne (produced by and starring John Larroquette) was also produced, but was cancelled shortly after. A German pilot based on the sitcom was made in 2001, named Zum letzten Kliff, but further episodes were not made.\n\nThe popular sitcoms 3rd Rock from the Sun and Cheers (in both of which Cleese has appeared) have cited Fawlty Towers as an inspiration, especially regarding its depiction of a dysfunctional \"family\" in the workplace. Also Arthur Mathews and Graham Linehan have cited Fawlty Towers as a major influence on their sitcom Father Ted. Guest House on Pakistan's PTV also resembled the series.\n\nSeveral of the characters have made other appearances, as spin-offs or in small cameo roles. In 1981, in character as Manuel, Andrew Sachs recorded his own version of the Joe Dolce cod-Italian song \"Shaddap You Face\" (with the B-side \"Waiter, There's a Spanish Flea in My Soup\"). However, the record was not released after Joe Dolce took out an injunction; he was about to issue his version in Britain.[37] Sachs also portrayed Manuel (or a Manuel-like character) in a series of British TV advertisements for life insurance. Gilly Flower and Renee Roberts, who played Miss Tibbs and Miss Gatsby in the series, reprised the roles in a 1983 episode of Only Fools and Horses.[38] In 2006, Cleese played Basil Fawlty for the first time in 27 years, for an unofficial England 2006 World Cup song, \"Don't Mention the World Cup\", named after the phrase \"don't mention the war\" Basil famously used in \"The Germans\".[39][40] In 2007, Cleese and Sachs reprised their roles for a six-episode corporate video for Norwegian oil company Statoil. In the video, Fawlty is running a restaurant called \"Basil's Brasserie\", while Manuel owns a Michelin Star restaurant in London.[41]\n\nIn November 2007, Prunella Scales returned to the role of Sybil Fawlty in a series of sketches for the BBC's annual Children in Need charity telethon. The character was seen taking over the management of the eponymous hotel from the BBC drama series Hotel Babylon, interacting with characters from that programme as well as other 1970s sitcom characters. The character of Sybil was used by permission of John Cleese.[42]\n\nFawlty Towers: Re-Opened[]\n\nIn 2009, Tiger Aspect Productions produced a two-part documentary for digital comedy channel Gold, called Fawlty Towers: Re-Opened. The documentary features interviews with all four main cast members, including Connie Booth, who had refused to talk about the series for 30 years.[43][44] John Cleese confirmed at the 30-year reunion in May 2009 that they will never make another episode of the comedy because they are \"too old and tired\", and expectations would be too high.[45] In a television interview (shown in Australia on Seven Network and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation) on 7 May 2009, Cleese also commented that he and Connie Booth took six weeks to write each episode.[46][47]\n\nOverseas[]\n\nIn 1977 and 1978 alone, it was sold to 45 stations in 17 countries and was the BBC's best selling overseas programme for that year. Fawlty Towers became a huge success in almost all countries where it was aired. Although it was initially a flop in Spain, because of the portrayal of the Spanish waiter Manuel, it was successfully resold, with Manuel's nationality changed to Italian.[14] In the Catalan region of Spain, however, Manuel was Mexican.[37] To show how badly it translated, Clive James picked up a clip containing Manuel's \"¿Qué?\" phrase to show on Clive James on Television in 1982. The series was also briefly broadcast in Italy in the 90s on the satellite channel Canal Jimmy, in the original English with Italian subtitles.\n\nThe series is still shown in the United States on at least one PBS member station. Maryland Public Television, which covers the state of the same name and the surrounding area, airs all episodes in order on Tuesday afternoons (4:00 pm ET) and Saturday nights (11:00 pm ET), along with other BBC sitcoms.[48]\n\nOverseas titles\n\nBelgium, Flanders - \"De zoete inval\" (?)\n\nDenmark - \"Halløj i badehotellet\" (\"Chaos at the Beach Hotel\")\n\nFrance - \"L'Hôtel en folie\" (\"Hotel gone mad\")\n\nGermany Original title and \"Fawltys Hotel, Zimmer frei, Ein verrücktes Hotel\" (\"Fawlty's Hotel, room to let, a crazy Hotel\") and \"Das verrückte Hotel – Fawlty Towers\" (\"The crazy Hotel - Fawlty Towers\")\n\nNetherlands - Original title and \"Hotel op stelten\" (?)\n\nNorway - \"Hotell i særklasse\" (Outstanding Hotel)\n\nSweden - \"Pang i bygget\" (\"Smash in the [building] construction\")\n\nsources - local Wikipedias (.de, .dk, .fr, .nl, .no, .se) through articles of \"John Cleese\"\n\nHome video releases[]\n\nFawlty Towers was originally released by BBC Video in 1984, but was edited with the credits from all three episodes put at the end of the tape.\n\nA Laserdisc containing all episodes spliced together as a continuous episode was released in the US on Laserdisc on 23 June 1993.\n\nIt was re-released in 1995 unedited and remastered.
