        "text": "Nicky Henson, who played lothario Mr Johnson in Fawlty Towers, has died at the age of 74.\n\nIn a statement, his family said he had a ‘long disagreement with cancer’ – having been diagnosed with prostate cancer 19 years ago.\n\nThe actor also appeared in EastEnders, Downton Abbey and Vera Drake as well as a number of stage roles.\n\nBut it was as Mr Johnson, the open-collared, medallion-wearing, leather-trousered playboy trying to sneak a girl into his hotel room in the Fawlty Towers episode The Psychiatrist he is likely to be best remembered.\n\nIndeed, he once joked that despite a five-decade career in acting, his tombstone would probably read: 'Here lies Nicky Henson - he was in one episode of Fawlty Towers'.\n\nHe was paid just £150 to appear in the episode, but added that repeat fees kept topping up his pension.\n\nRecently he again worked John Cleese, directing a 2017 stage production of Bang! Bang! – a farce the Python star had adapted from Georges Feydeau’s 1892 play Monsieur Chasse.\n\nHenson was once married to Una Stubbs, but walked out on her. He also had relationships with actresses Linda Thorson and Susan Hampshire and ballerina Marguerite Porter, whom he married.\n\nAmong those paying tribute today were Confessions Of actor Robin Askwith, who tweeted: ‘Apart from anything else he was a fantastic stage actor. His Look Back In Anger at The New Vic was sensational. Although not close, e we knew each other well-he was insistent that I would never be taken seriously with long hair!’\n\nStephen Mangan added: ‘RIP Nicky Henson, fine actor and the first ever Garry Lejeune in Noises Off. I will salute you today by falling backwards down a flight of stairs.’\n\nAnd comedy historian Robert Ross said: ‘Farewell Nicky Henson. What an extraordinarily good actor. His horror (Witchfinder General, Psychomania) and comedy (Fawlty Towers: The Psychiatrist, Season’s Greetings) credentials will always be dear to my heart, but he was never less than impeccable. From the RSC to Downtown.’\n\nPublished: 16 Dec 2019"
