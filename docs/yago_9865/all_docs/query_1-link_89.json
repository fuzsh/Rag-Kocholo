        "text": "The former Fawlty Towers, and Eastenders star Nicky Henson has passed away at the age of 74 after a long battle with cancer.\n\nAfter battling prostate cancer for the past 19 years, his death was confirmed by fellow actor Ian Ogilvy.\n\nNicky had a long career spanning 57 years with roles in Eastenders, Downton Abbey and Fawlty Towers.\n\nHe also starred in Syriana alongside George Clooney, The Bill and Vera Drake.\n\nFriend and actor Ian revealed the news on Facebook, saying: 'After an illness which started twenty years ago, and which was born with great fortitude and good humour, my oldest and dearest friend, my mate Nicky Henson, has gone [sic].'\n\nA statement followed from his family which read: 'Nicky Henson has died after a long disagreement with cancer.'\n\nIn his most memorable role, he starred as a romantic guest who had a few run-ins with Basil after he was caught sneaking a girl up to his room.\n\nSpeaking about the role in the comedy show, he said: 'I played a flash guy, a medallion man in leather trousers and a chamois shirt, Basil was dreadfully nasty to me.'\n\n'We didn't realise what a huge hit the show was. John did say to me, 'I can probably guarantee 100 per cent of your original fee in repeats.' My fee was Â£150 - and Fawlty Towers is still topping up my pension!'\n\nAnd he then joked about what his tombstone would say when he died, despite having such a long career: 'Here lies Nicky Henson - he was in one episode of Fawlty Towers'.\n\nHe also was well known as Honey's father Jack Edwards on Eastenders who had a brief relationship with Peggy Mitchell on the show.\n\nNicky married two times during the course of his life, firstly to Sherlock star Una Stubbs and they had two children, he then married Marguerite Porter, who he had a third son with.\n\nHe also had entered relationships with Avengers star Linda Thompson and Susan Hampshire.\n\nThe actor had battled three different forms of cancer in three years and underwent 21 procedures for kidney stones that were caused by the radiation treatment for prostate cancer."
