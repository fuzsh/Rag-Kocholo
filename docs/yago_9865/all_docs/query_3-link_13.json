        "text": "Actress Una Stubbs who starred in Sherlock, EastEnders and Till Death Us Do Part has died today at the age of 84.\n\nThe star, who was born in Hertfordshire in 1937, had a long career in film, TV and theatre spanning more than 50 years, including a role as Mrs Hudson in the BBC's Sherlock with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman.\n\nStubbs, who was also known for her roles in Sir Cliff Richard's classic film Summer Holiday as well as Worzel Gummidge and In Sickness And In Health, 'passed away quietly' at home in Edinburgh surrounded by her family.\n\nAmong those paying tribute today was Sherlock creator Steven Moffat, who described Stubbs as 'just about the kindest, nicest, funniest person you could meet', and added: 'The loveliest light on Baker Street has gone out.'\n\nThe actress, who was married twice and had three children, had been suffering from an illness for a few months according to her agent, who praised her today as a 'wonderful actress' with an 'extraordinarily varied' career.\n\nStubbs, who played Aunt Sally in the 1979 version of Worzel Gummidge alongside Jon Pertwee as Worzel, was also in The Worst Witch, Fawlty Towers, Heartbeat, Midsomer Murders, The Catherine Tate Show and Benidorm.\n\nStubbs was married to The Onedin Line actor Peter Gilmore from 1958 to 1969, with whom she adopted son Jason, and then married Fawlty Towers star Nicky Henson in 1969, before they split in 1975. The couple had two sons, Joe and Christian. Gilmour died in February 2013 aged 81, and Henson died in December 2019 aged 74.\n\nJoe and Christian are now composers, and the latter tweeted today: 'Some of you may have known her as Rita, as Sally as Bat or Hudson but to my two brothers and I she was known as Mum. Thanks for everything Mum. RIP.'\n\nA family statement said: 'Mum passed away quietly today with her family around her, in Edinburgh. We ask for privacy and understanding at this most difficult and sad of times.'\n\nHer agent Rebecca Blond said: 'We are desperately sad to have lost not only a wonderful actress, whose screen and stage career, spanning over 50 years, was so extraordinarily varied, from Till Death Us Do Part to Sherlock, as well as memorable performances in the West End, at the Old Vic, Donmar Warehouse, Sheffield Crucible and National Theatre, but also a wickedly funny, elegant, stylish, graceful, gracious and kind and constant friend.\n\n'She was also a highly respected and exhibited artist. We will miss her enormously and remember her always.'\n\nStubbs was born in Welwyn Garden City on May 1, 1937, and made her television debut in 1956 as a dancer on the music programme Cool For Cats.\n\nSummer Holiday helped to make Stubbs's name alongside Sir Cliff in 1963 and she went on to star in BBC sitcom Till Death Us Do Part and its sequel In Sickness And In Health, playing Rita Rawlings.\n\nOther well-known television roles include Miss Bat in The Worst Witch, as well as a role in the Fawlty Towers episode The Anniversary. She first appeared on screen in the 1950s in series such as Benny Hill and Rush Hour.\n\nAfter her turn as Sandy in Summer Holiday, she appeared in Sir Cliff's next film Wonderful Life and later in his BBC TV series It's Cliff Richard!\n\nFor several years, she was a team captain in the weekly game show Give Us A Clue in the 1980s and also made appearances in Heartbeat, Benidorm, Victoria Wood's We'd Quite Like To Apologise, The Catherine Tate Show and Agatha Christie's Marple.\n\nShe also played Caroline Bishop in the BBC soap EastEnders and more recently appeared in The Durrells, Call The Midwife and Midsomer Murders.\n\nIn addition to her work as an actress, Stubbs was also a keen amateur painter who had her work displayed at the Royal Academy in London.\n\nSherlock's Steven Moffat said of Stubbs: 'The loveliest light on Baker Street has gone out. What a woman, what a talent, what a star - and just about the kindest, nicest, funniest person you could meet.\n\n'I don't know how anyone even starts summing up that career - Till Death Us Do Part, Fawlty Towers, the incomparable Aunt Sally in Worzel Gummidge... and, of course, the irreplaceable heart and soul of Sherlock'.\n\nAnd Sherlock co-creator Mark Gatiss tweeted: 'It was one of the great joys of my life to work so closely with and to adore Una Stubbs. She was a wonderful, wonderful woman and a great and serenely graceful actor. Mischief was in her blood. We were so blessed that she became our imperishable Mrs Hudson. Goodbye, darling.'\n\nA tribute from Sherlock producer Sue Vertue and the BBC programme's team said: 'Oh Una Stubbs, how we will miss you. You famously said to Sherlock that you were 'his landlady, not his housekeeper' but to us, you were so much more than either of those things - you were absolutely our Sherlock mum.\n\n'You knitted us together. Always loving life, always wise, always wickedly funny and always kind. Bye bye you darling lady, you will always be in our hearts. - Sue Vertue & the Sherlock family'.\n\nIn 2015, Stubbs said that when playing the part she treated her co-stars Cumberbatch and Freeman, who played Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson respectively, the way she treated her own sons.\n\nIn an interview with TV Times, she added that she liked 'the variation of the role... not being jolly and just being really sad was a nice change'.\n\nHappy Valley actress Sarah Lancashire was also among the first to pay tribute to Stubbs, tweeting: 'Rest in peace, Una Stubbs. Shocked at this news. Such a great actress. Sad news. Thoughts go out to her family and friends.'\n\nActress Bonnie Langford said: 'Such a loss. She made everything look so effortless. A consummate professional, kind, gracious, elegant, versatile and fun. Her Aunt Sally was a masterclass alone. Condolences and love to those loved ones left behind.'\n\nAnd EastEnders actress Lucy Benjamin tweeted: 'Such sad news. Had the honour of being in the stage production of Worzel Gummidge with Una Stubbs in the early 80s and she taught me so much as a child actor and really showed me the way. What a loss.'\n\nHollyoaks actress Jessica Fox added: 'Very sad to hear the news of Una Stubbs passing. She played Miss Bat in the version of the Worst witch I was part of. I always remember Una as being so kind and caring of the younger cast.\n\n'She was very quick, funny and incredibly professional. to this day I think Una was the most effortlessly chic and stylish woman I've ever met. I feel very lucky to have worked with her. My thoughts are with her family.'\n\nTV presenter Nick Knowles tweeted: 'I had the pleasure of working with Una Stubbs when she appeared in our film Golden Years. She was a lovely, generous, empathic Lady full of mischief and joy. Everyone on the crew loved her. She will be sorely missed. RIP, I will miss your infectious smile x'.\n\nA statement from the Call The Midwife team said: 'We are sad to hear of the death of the wonderful Una Stubbs, who we were fortunate to work with here on Call The Midwife. We send her family our deepest condolences at this time. xxx'\n\nMusician Paul Weller remembered her as 'a wonderful & talented lady', while Michael Moran said: 'I remember seeing Una Stubbs in the street in Victoria, and smiled at her out of recognition before I quite realised who she was. She responded with a lovely beaming smile. Good people.'\n\nBroadcaster Gyles Brandreth said: 'Oh, this is so sad. Such a funny, lovely, gifted lady - a marvellous actress with a special style & a great (and impish) sense of humour.\n\n'I first met her when she was in Cowardy Custard in 1972 and last saw her at Nicky Henson's funeral last year. A sad day.'\n\nMeanwhile TV star Baroness Floella Benjamin said: 'Una Stubbs was not only a great actress but a delightful person too.\n\n'I remember appearing on her team in 'Give Us a Clue' and she made my mum, who I took to the recording feel very special. I'll be eternally grateful to her for that. May she rest in peace.'\n\nTV channel Gold also paid tribute as a spokesman said: 'We're all deeply saddened to learn that the magnificent Una Stubbs has passed away at the age of 84. Our thoughts are with her family and friends at this sad time.'"
