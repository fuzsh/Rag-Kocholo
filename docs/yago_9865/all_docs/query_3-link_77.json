        "text": "Broadcaster Gyles Brandreth has recalled a rather brilliant anecdote with Una Stubbs, as he paid tribute to the icon who died this week aged 84.\n\nOn Thursday Stubbs’ family confirmed the Sherlock star died in Edinburgh, with tributes continuing to come in.\n\nFans of the veteran actress, who was best known for roles in the film Summer Holiday and in the BBC sitcoms Till Death Us Do Part and In Sickness And In Health, have shared their memories of the star, with Brandreth chiming in on Friday morning.\n\nAppearing on This Morning, the actor and former politician recalled interviewing Stubbs on his radio show and bearing witness to her cheeky charm when it came to her love life.\n\nStubbs was married to actor Peter Gilmore from 1958 to 1969, with whom she adopted son Jason, and then married Nicky Henson in 1969, before they split in 1975.\n\nThe couple had two sons, Joe and Christian, both of whom are composers.\n\nSharing they met in 1972, Brandreth went on to say: ‘And a very funny human being. Last time I interviewed her on the radio, she had an interesting love life, I said “how’s it going?” She said to me, “oh things are rather good at the moment, I’ve got a new boyfriend and he’s an architect. He’s very well off, he’s unattached, he’s gorgeous, in fact, he’s got a great sense of humour, doesn’t get in the way of my career. It’s going very well”.\n\n‘After the interview, I said “well done on your new man”, she said, “what new man?” I said, “the new man you were telling us about on the radio”.\n\n‘She said, “there isn’t a new man, I just said that, didn’t I? I didn’t want people to think I didn’t have a boyfriend!”‘\n\nBrandreth waxed lyrical on Stubbs, musing ‘she could do anything’, adding: ‘She was such a lovely human being and so versatile and brilliant.’\n\nA statement from Stubbs’ family on Thursday read: ‘Mum passed away quietly today with her family around her, in Edinburgh. We ask for privacy and understanding at this most difficult and sad of times.’\n\nSon Christian wrote on Twitter: ‘Some of you may have known her as Rita, as Sally as Bat or Hudson but to my two brothers and I she was known as Mum. Thanks for everything Mum RIP.’\n\nThe 1963 film Summer Holiday helped to make Stubbs’ name after she starred in the musical alongside Sir Cliff Richard.\n\nShe went on to star in BBC sitcom Till Death Us Do Part and its sequel In Sickness And In Health, playing Rita Rawlings.\n\nOther well-known television roles included Aunt Sally in Worzel Gummidge and Miss Bat in The Worst Witch, as well as a role in the Fawlty Towers episode The Anniversary.\n\nSherlock co-star Benedict Cumberbatch labelled Stubbs ‘a wonderful, talented, stylish, gentle, joyous and honest friend’.\n\nIn a statement, he added: ‘A joy to work with, to laugh with and to make laugh. So humble and yet so damn good.\n\n‘She lit up the room and will be sorely missed by all who were lucky enough to know her, but she will be remembered forever with fondness and love.’\n\nMORE : Christopher Biggins feels it is a ‘shame’ his late friend Una Stubbs was never made a Dame: ‘She deserved it’"
