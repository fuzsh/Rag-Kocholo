He was like Picasso. He was a fantastic artist.” A pioneering DJ who had worked as a coproducer with Russell, D’Acquisto delivered his overview with the fervid surety of an evangelist. “Arthur was one of the great songwriters of the twentieth century. I put him up there with Rogers and Hart, with Cole Porter. He had a whole new way of talking, a whole new way of saying things.” At that point D’Acquisto started to sing “Tell You (Today),” a song he recorded with Russell in the early 1980s. Walking down the street I knew it was my chance My chance today New shoes on my feet I thought that they could dance Dance away It makes me come alive I remember the look of sadness on your face But that was before I want to tell you today.\n\n​“It’s like you’ve broken up with somebody, but you still love them,” he enthused. “If I told you the words to some of his other records, you would flip out.” Transported by a rush of memories, D’Acquisto proceeded to sing “Let’s Go Swimming,” “Janine,” and “List of Boys.” It was a while before he realized his soup had gone cold. Occupied with researching the history of U.S. dance culture, I had agreed to set aside an afternoon to talk about Russell, because I needed to find out more about two of his twelve-inch singles, “Go Bang! #5” and “Is It All Over My Face?”—and Russell wasn’t around to tell me about them. But D’Acquisto ended up spending more time talking about Russell’s songs than his remixes, and by the end of the interview, I had noted down a series of names whose proximity seemed to violate some kind of musical taboo. Unable to explain how Russell had come to work with David Byrne, Allen Ginsberg, Philip Glass, and John Hammond, as well as Walter Gibbons, François Kevorkian, Larry Levan, and Will Socolov, D’Acquisto challenged me to write a biography about his low-profile friend, whom he had met at David Mancuso’s Loft, the influential private party that would frame my account of New York dance. I replied by noting that I already had my hands full with the dance book. Privately I wondered if it would be possible to write a book about such a manifestly diffuse figure. When D’Acquisto died from a brain tumor four years later, it seemed as though the opportunity to find out more about Russell’s scattered existence had passed on as well, and the sensation of having experienced a double loss stayed with me until I traveled to the EMP Pop Music conference in 2003, where I had a chance conversation with the Cuban music specialist Ned Sublette. “‘Is it all over my face? / You caught me love dancing,’” Sublette crooned the moment I told him about my forthcoming dance book. “‘Is it all over my face? / I’m in love dancin’.’” A downtown composer, musician, and record-label owner, Sublette had been friends with Russell and wanted to talk. He also offered to put me in touch with the composermusicians Peter Gordon and Peter Zummo, who had worked closely with Russell over a number of years. Imagining future interviewees, I wondered if they would sing to me as well. As a route into Russell’s history presented itself, I began to float the idea of a biography, only to hear questions about its marketability raised. They dampened my hopes but not my intrigue, so when Gordon visited London in June 2003, I took him up on his offer to “talk Arthur,” and by the xvi\n\nPreface\n\ntime I boarded a flight the following February to attend Mancuso’s party for the Loft’s thirty-fourth anniversary, Russell’s shadowy silhouette had been transformed. Responding to the simultaneous release of two posthumous compilations of Russell’s work, David Toop and the Wire ran a cover feature about the composer-musician in January 2004, and as Mancuso’s guests rolled into his East Village gathering, I met Steve Knutson, who was hoping to give the Loft host a vinyl copy of Calling out of Context—one of the albums that had prompted Toop to write his piece. “Arthur Russell is my favorite artist,” Knutson told me a couple of days later as I photocopied a pile of archival documents he was holding on behalf of Tom Lee, Russell’s long-term lover. “His music is pure spirit.” I went on to spend long afternoons talking with Lee and Zummo, and a couple of weeks later the New York Times and the New Yorker ran prominent features about Russell. Something strange was unfolding, while the potential for a biography had become much clearer. Beyond a clutch of occasional reviews, the archives revealed that Frank Owen, Toop, and Zummo had published interview-led features about Russell in Melody Maker, the Face, and the SoHo Weekly News. Subsequently, Gary Lucas, Sublette, and Toop penned articles to coincide with Russell’s passing and the posthumous release of Another Thought, a collection of Russell’s voice-cello recordings released in 1994.1 Informed by this material, I began to approach anyone who was willing to talk, and quickly generated a list of contacts that, beginning with Alan Abrams and ending with Zummo, resembled a phantom address book of Russell’s acquaintances. The task of pinning down milestone dates became easier after Chuck and Emily Russell (Russell’s parents) and Muriel Fujii (an exgirlfriend) sent me copies of the letters Russell had written to them (which I quote throughout the book). By the time Tom Lee invited me to rummage through an old box of flyers and letters, I was confident that the details of his life could be mapped out in credible detail. But one key question remained unanswered: were these the specifics of a life that would matter only to a band of dedicated listeners, or was there a reason to think they might amount to something more? As my research deepened, I began to realize that it wasn’t just Russell who cut an oblique figure; so, somewhat strangely, did the city in which he made his music. Between 1970 and 1985 disco, punk, new wave, no wave, hip-hop, and electro forged their distinctive sounds, the eclectic compoPreface\n\nxvii\n\nsitional movement of “new music” fashioned a compositional alternative to serialism, and free jazz continued to accelerate away from bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz. Yet while these sounds had been historicized as selfcontained movements, no meta-account had been written to explain why this extraordinary rush of sonic innovation had originated in the lofts, clubs, bars, and community halls that stretched across lower Manhattan (save for hip-hop, which germinated in the boroughs). Indeed with the exception of Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club, in which Bernard Gendron explores the exchange that took place between new music, new wave, and no wave, little had been written on how these downtown sounds didn’t exist as a series of discrete scenes but instead began to meet and blend until downtown resembled a mashed-up jukebox of illegitimate fusions. Revealing the way downtown New York came to function as a space of explorative flows, Russell’s blurry movements between pop, rock, folk, dance, hip-hop, and orchestral music did indeed resonate more widely still. In addition to describing the life of a musician, his biography could also help articulate the contours of a dynamic network: downtown New York during the 1970s and 1980s. This shift in scope resolved a related problem. Setting out, I had wondered how I would negotiate the apparent requirement that every biography must elevate the life of its subject to the point where it plays into a rather insidious form of individualism. Artists and composers might relish this kind of exalted write-up, because recognition can be emotionally and financially rewarding, and so might record companies, because individuals are easier to sell than amorphous collectives, but a less partial interpretation of the world requires a different approach. As Manuel DeLanda notes in A New Philosophy of Society, while individuals are not the passive products of a grand macrostructure, nor is the macrostructure a “mere aggregate”; it comprises not a sum of individuals but the way in which those individuals interact with each other.2 This idea of interaction (or what happens when two elements come into contact and develop a reciprocal exchange) was pivotal for Russell, who moved from Oskaloosa to Iowa City to San Francisco to New York because each new location offered him a greater opportunity to form relationships and explore sound. He didn’t settle in downtown New York because the statistics looked good—it’s likely more composers and musicians were living uptown during the early 1970s—but because downtown was a better place to exchange ideas, struggle over xviii\n\nPreface\n\nstructure, fool around, and get good sound. Russell’s biography, it follows, needed to emphasize not only his individuality but also his collaborative outlook and rootedness in a dynamic network. In case an explicit disclaimer is necessary, Hold On to Your Dreams isn’t intended as a history of that network. As a result the jazz loft scene is referenced only in passing, because although Russell grew up with jazz and introduced jazz aesthetics into many of his recordings, he didn’t frequent venues such as Studio Rivbea and Ali’s Alley, and he didn’t become involved in the improvisation scene that developed out of the Knitting Factory in the 1980s. Similarly the no-wave scene charted by Simon Reynolds in Rip It Up and Start Again and Marc Masters in No Wave is referenced only briefly, because Russell didn’t make music with its key protagonists, including the influential downtown figure Glen Branca. One of Branca’s peers, the newwave/no-wave composer Rhys Chatham, has a significant role because of his friendship with Russell and his heavyweight, institutional presence at the Kitchen Center for Video and Music. The unquestionably influential Kitchen is also a little more prominent than it might have been in a nonbiographical account of downtown because Russell curated its music program for the 1974–1975 season. Along with the topography of Russell’s choices, the testimonies of Russell’s family, friends, and collaborators have heavily shaped this book. Whether it’s clearer or foggier, hindsight is always a description of a past event rather than the event itself, and the memories and insights of interviewees can only be refracted through the present. I quote them because their recollections and opinions are either important or interesting, and although that’s not the same thing as saying they’re indisputably correct, their value becomes clearer when considered alongside the voices that are absent. Often cryptic and cagey when interviewed, Russell might have obstructed the writing of this biography if he was still around, but his passing has made it difficult to capture his voice, never mind check his movements and motives. Lovers, friends, mentors, and collaborators such as Louis Aquilone, John Bernd, Julius Eastman, Walter Gibbons, Allen Ginsberg, John Hammond, Larry Levan, Yuko Nonomura, and Kirk Winslow have also passed away, as has the more contentious figure of Ajari Warwick. I regret having interviewed Steve D’Acquisto about Russell on just the one occasion and that I was unable to locate the studio owner and engineer Mark Freedman, a significant figure in Russell’s life. Preface\n\nxix\n\nDrawing on all available sources, I’ve attempted to combine the burrowing mentality of the archaeologist with the presentational outlook of the museum curator and the emotional sensibility of a diarist. I have tried to evoke the delicate, calibrated, and immersive mode of Russell’s day-today music-making existence without letting minutiae suffocate his story, so while significant recording sessions and performances receive detailed descriptions, the kind of micro-detail that can be found in his notebooks is only included when it doesn’t threaten to wreck any semblance of flow and structure. Whenever I wondered about whom to include or exclude, I asked myself the question: would Russell have wanted this friend to appear in a photo album of his life? Having shaped this book around his favorite people and places, I also have attempted to infuse this crucial biographical information with an equally important level of contextual analysis. The hope is for this analysis to illustrate the importance of a figure who was soft-spoken. The chapters that follow are divided into seven chronologically ordered and overlapping blocks of time: Formations (1951–1973), Explorations (1973–1975), Alternatives (1975–1977), Intensities (1977–1980), Variations (1980–1984), Reverberations (1984–1987), and Tangents (1987–1992). The chronological framework allows the biography to carry out its first basic task, which is to outline the story of Russell’s life, because this work hasn’t been carried out beyond article-length detail. Far from forcing his story into an ill-fitting straitjacket, the chronology helps draw attention to the way in which, when faced with an array of choices, Russell’s modus operandi was one of inquisitive digression. Instead of “progressing” from one style of music to another, or even one group of musicians to another, Russell followed an illogical logic, pursuing a bemusing number of sounds. Like a vine, he only moved up or down if that movement helped him move sideways, and his striking simultaneity—his wanting to do everything at once—didn’t so much stop time as open up other ways of experiencing it. In the mid-1980s Russell worked on a song titled “Get Around to It,” but before I follow his advice, I should note a few points about the “it” that’s about to begin. Regarding the mode of biographical address, Russell is called Russell in the preface, introduction, and epilogue, but in the narrative description of his life he becomes Charley, Jigmé, and then Arthur, because he wanted to connect emotionally and wasn’t keen on formalities. Of course music provided Russell with his primary mode of connection, and xx\n\nPreface\n\nalthough this cannot be replicated or displaced, some background information hopefully will enrich future listening. For readers who want to find out more, all of Russell’s published recordings are listed in a discography at the end of the book, and the bibliography contains a list of websites of relevant record labels, musicians, and articles. Unless otherwise referenced, all quotations are taken from interviews that I conducted between 1998 and 2008. Regarding the title of the book, I decided to opt for the unashamedly uplifting “Hold On to Your Dreams,” the name of a song Russell wrote in the early 1980s for the producer and remixer François Kevorkian. Hatched while he was living in San Francisco, Russell’s dream was simple: he wanted to write music as it came to him, move between and even bring together different sonic-social worlds, and earn enough money to pay the rent as he went about his work. Financial difficulties and record company fallouts disrupted this ambition repeatedly, and from the mid-1980s onwards ill health threatened to end it once and for all. But Russell only gave up pursuing the perfect studio mix (as well as an integrated downtown music culture) when sickness finally overtook his body. Full of improbable transitions and vivid flashes, Russell’s life also took on the form of a dream, and while it’s impossible to capture that dream in its entirety as it fades from consciousness, the shards that survive continue to enthrall.\n\nPreface\n\nxxi\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nMy name appears on the spine of this book, but my primary task has been to coordinate, transcribe, and organize the memories of Arthur Russell’s friends, family, and collaborators. Many writers describe their profession as a lonely one, but the experience of working on this book has been collective and sociable, and when I sing Russell’s line “I wanna see all my friends at once,” as I often do, I think of many of the people I have been lucky enough to meet while researching his biography. I was admitted into Russell’s inner circle because his intimates were open, generous, and trusting, as well as willing to take a gamble and confide in an author who had only one book to his name—a book about disco. Everyone who contributed to this book also made the most difficult acknowledgment of all: that however precious their memories might be, Russell was and remains beyond the proprietorship of any single person, and that this book would contain only part of “their Arthur.” Russell could be fearless and contentious, especially if his activity seemed likely to lead to something interesting or even inspire personal growth, and because of this, it proved to be impossible to navigate an entirely smooth passage through the research and writing process. I remain grateful to those who might have been confronted with more information than they wanted to know at certain points, and hope I’ve learned a few things from the time bombs Russell left ticking after he died.\n\nI remain indebted to the following interviewees, many of whom spoke with me several times while contributing to an archive of more than six hundred emails: Alan Abrams, Mustafa Ahmed, Bob Blank, Lola Blank, Joyce Bowden, Ernie Brooks, Rhys Chatham, Mel Cheren, Don Christensen, Steve D’Acquisto, David DePino, Arnold Dreyblatt, Barry Feldman, Jim Fouratt, Muriel Fujii, Colin Gate, Bernard Gendron, Jon Gibson, Philip Glass, Peter Gordon, Kent Goshorn, Steven Hall, Steven Harvey, David Hill, François Kevorkian, Kevin Killian, Steve Knutson, Jim Kohn, Jill Kroesen, Joan La Barbara, Elodie Lauten, Sister LaVette, Mary Jane Leach, Tom Lee, Robbie Leslie, George Lewis, Eric Liljestrand, Gary Lucas, David Mancuso, William Allaudin Mathieu, John Moran, Bill Morgan, Donald Murk, Sydney Murray, Rome Neal, Phill Niblock, Thomas R. O’Donnell, Toni Pagliuca, Gladys Pizarro, Bob Rosenthal, George Ruckert, Chuck Russell, Emily Russell, Julie Russell, Kate Russell Henry, Bill Ruyle, Larry Saltzman, Alison Salzinger, Roger Sanchez, John Scherman, Carlota Schoolman, Nicky Siano, Jim Smith, Will Socolov, Robert Stearns, Ned Sublette, Elias Tanenbaum, Anne Tardos, Todd Terry, Geoff Travis, “Blue” Gene Tyranny, David Van Tieghem, Leon Van Weelden, Paul Waldman, Daniel Wang, Jennifer Warnes, Jeff Whittier, Christian Wolff, Ellen Ziegler, Robert Ziegler, and Peter Zummo. These individuals supplied the memories and insights that underpin this biography. Without them it would have amounted to a moribund fusion of press cuttings, reworked secondary sources, and personalized interpretations of recordings. With them, I hope it’s something more. Because it was so difficult to get hold of Russell’s music when I started my research, and because so much of his music remains unreleased, I turned to his collaborators and collectors, who supplied me with rare recordings. Ernie Brooks dug out a selection of Flying Hearts tapes and also made copies of the two Necessaries albums he worked on with Russell. Steven Hall sent me “C-Thru,” a track he recorded with Russell and Walter Gibbons. Working with Tom Lee, Steve Knutson passed on recordings of Russell’s interview on WUSB Stony Brook and his performance at 1750 Arch Street; a rare copy of Tower of Meaning; a bootleg of the Walter Gibbons mix of “Go Bang! #5”; and a selection of Bright and Early, Flying Hearts, Loose Joints, and solo efforts. Gary Lucas put together a compilation that included a recording of Russell’s rap session with Mark Sinclair. Nick the Record assembled a selection of Russell’s dance tracks, including xxiv\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nthe seven-inch version of “Pop Your Funk.” Sandro Perri provided me with his own Polmo Polpo remix of “Kiss Me Again.” Alex PeWin gave me another bootleg version of the Walter Gibbons remix of “Go Bang! #5.” Larry Saltzman copied more Flying Hearts material, including the group’s demo session with John Hammond. Matt Wolf forwarded Russell’s performance of “Eli” at the Kitchen. I also received valuable discographical assistance from Ernie Brooks, Steven Hall, Tom Lee, Chris Menist, Niki Mir, Nick the Record, Will Socolov, Lee White, and, above all, Steve Knutson, who has become the unrivalled authority on Russell’s unreleased tapes. I’ve also benefited from generous assistance during my documentary research. Rachael Dorsey-McGowen, Richard Guerin, Ben Hyman, Matthew Lyons, and Edith Whitsitt helped me access material from the Kitchen’s archives. Muriel Fujii was bold enough to send me the love letters she exchanged with Russell. Bernard Gendron shared information he had collected on early rock gigs that took place in the Mercer Arts Center as well as on Rhys Chatham’s work with Morton Subotnick. Steven Hall made copies of the impassioned faxes he swapped with Russell while he was living in Hong Kong. David Hill handed over material gathered in his own research on Russell, including Point Music’s inventory of Russell’s tape archive, which was completed on 7 December 1992. Steve Knutson fuelled the idea of writing a biography when he invited me to rummage through the archives he was holding in his office at Audika. Tom Lee welcomed me into the apartment he co-inhabited with Russell and took my breath away as he opened up the boxes of letters and notebooks he had refused to discard, and which we leafed through together across long afternoons. Chuck and Emily Russell sent copies of the precious letters written by their son, as well as pamphlets about their hometown. Robert Stearns made a photocopy of the delicate Kitchen Yearbook he compiled for the 1974–1975 season and also sent details from the even more fragile 1975–1976 edition. David Toop shared the handwritten notes he made during his interview with Russell for the Face magazine. Kurt B. Reighley forwarded a transcript of his interviews with Laurie Anderson and Steve D’Acquisto. Additional support in tracking down books and articles was provided by the library staff at the University of East London (especially Hugh Bowman) and the British Library. Collecting the artwork that appears in this book required much work, partly because Russell was notoriously camera-shy, and partly because phoAcknowledgments\n\nxxv\n\ntography was an expensive hobby in the 1970s and most of Russell’s friends were poor. A significant portion of the material came from the private collections of Tom Lee and Chuck and Emily Russell, as well as the archive held by Audika. In addition I would like to thank Mustafa Ahmed, Bob Blank, Maria Blondeel, Teri Bloom, David Borden, Joyce Bowden, Patricia Brennecke, Ernie Brooks, Pat Clare, Paula Court, Steve D’Acquisto, R. Dulman, Frances Eastman, Johnny Fu, Muriel Fujii, Jon Gibson, Allen Ginsberg, Michael Gomes, Peter Gordon, Peter Hale, Steven Hall, Andy Harris, David Hill, Patricia Kelly, François Kevorkian, Mary Jane Leach, Leonedis Designs, Gary Lucas, William Allaudin Mathieu, Mike Meagher, Sydney Murray, Phill Niblock, Yuko Nonomura, Wendy Perron, Robert Poll, Marsha Resnick, Richard Rogers, Marion Rosendahl, John Rosenfelder, Bob Rosenthal, Jo Sherman, Nicky Siano, Teri Slotkin, Robert Stearns, Ned Sublette, Joanna Voit, Carrie Waldman, Paul Waldman, Edith Whitsitt, Matt Wolf, Ellen Ziegler, and Peter Zummo, all of whom provided valuable help. I have attempted to contact Jo Bonney and Robert Longo, Richard Landry, Daniel Sussman, and Henry Wang without luck, but I remain grateful for their photographs and artwork, which enrich this book. Although it will involve repeating a number of names, extra-special thanks must go to Tom Lee, the unswerving and unsung friend, lover, and devotee, who has been courteous, gentle, and generous in answering all manner of inquiries; Chuck and Emily Russell, whose dedication to their son across the decades remains striking; Joyce Bowden, Ernie Brooks, Peter Gordon, Steven Hall, Elodie Lauten, and Peter Zummo, who continue to wrestle with the complicated legacy of their friend; Steve Knutson, whose work at Audika has done so much to raise Russell’s profile, and who has been generous with information and resources; Steve D’Acquisto for letting his enthusiasm get the better of him and me when we started to talk about Russell; Arnold Dreyblatt, Donald Murk, Ned Sublette, and Jeff Whittier for their willingness to share rich insights; Robert Stearns for digging deep in order to help me get the Kitchen story straight; and finally to Philip Glass, whose enthusiasm and support for a younger and less successful composer-musician has barely dimmed across a period of some twentyfive years. I would also like to thank Enrica Balestra, Andrew Blake, Bernie Gendron, Maggie Humm, and Helen Lane for reading earlier drafts of this book with such care; Danny Wang for initiating a conversation with one of this xxvi\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nbook’s most important interviewees; Drew Daniel for coming up with the theme for EMP’s 2006 gathering, which helped a great deal; Stuart Baker, Mel Cheren, Barry Feldman, David Hill, Gary Lucas, Will Socolov, Seymour Stein, Geoff Travis, and, especially, Philip Glass and Steve Knutson, for releasing Arthur Russell’s music, which can’t have ever been straightforward, but which lies at the heart of everything that follows; Stuart Aitken, Daniela Cascella, Sasha Frere-Jones, Jess Harvell, Tom Lee, Gary Lucas, Chris Menist, Thomas R. O’Donnell, Ben Ratliff, Kurt B. Reighley, Walter Rovere, Ned Sublette, Peter Zummo, and, in particular, David Toop for publishing articles that have already made the case for Russell’s music; Matt Wolf for the excellent Wild Combination: A Portrait of Arthur Russell as well as the check-ins; Donald Murk for flattering me with the thought that I’m a “good match”; Will Straw for supporting my application to the British Academy; Aaron Lecklider for inviting me to contribute an article about Russell to the Journal of Popular Music Studies; Michael LeVan for overseeing the publication of my ambitious piece about Arthur Russell and rhizomatic musicianship in Liminalities; and Ryan Dohoney for the Julius Eastman clarifications. More generally, I would like to thank Sarah Baker, Jeremy Gilbert, Maggie Humm, Mica Nava, Anat Pick, Ashwani Sharma, and Debbie Shaw in the Centre for Cultural Studies Research collective for the conversations about culture and politics; Enrica Balestra, Daphne Brooks, Garnette Cadogan, Maurizio Clemente, Jeremy Gilbert, Steve Goodman, Judith Halberstam, Yum Hara Cawkwell, Jason King, Charlie Kronengold, Josh Kun, David Mancuso, Fred Maus, Colleen Murphy, Carlos Palombini, ­Stefan Prescott, Alexandra Vázquez, Danny Wang, and Tim Watson for the conversations about music and politics; Eric Weisbard, Ann Powers, and the organizers and attendees at the EMP Pop Music conference in Seattle, who generate the most urgent conversations about popular music; my students in the music culture program at the University of East London for keeping me on my toes; Maurizio Clemente and Francesca Sulis (with Giovanni Ranieri and Luca Benini) for the Italian support; Tess and Greg, Helen and David, Rita and Nonna, and Giorgio and Elsa for the good food and feisty conversations; and Jeremy Gilbert and Colleen Murphy plus the rest of the Lucky Cloud Sound System collective—Ilaria Bucchieri, Lili Capelle, Guillaume Chottin, Simon Coppock, Cyril Cornet, Claude Dousset, Estelle du Boulay, Adrian Fillary, Emma Halpin, Simon Halpin, Darren Henson, James HogAcknowledgments\n\nxxvii\n\ngarth, Jo Kemp, Cedric Lassonde, Fabien Lassonde, Jo Littler, Iain Mackie, David Mancuso, Pauline Moisy, Darren Morgan, Pete Morris, Alex Pe Win, Alejandro Quesada, Sharon Reid, Janette Rosing, David Starsky, Tan UrRehman, Elin Vister, Shannon Woo, and John Zachau—for the Journey through the Light parties, which couldn’t be more rewarding. I have once again been fortunate enough to work with the staff at Duke University Press, who published my first book, Love Saves the Day: A History of American Dance Music Culture, 1970–1979. Molly Balikov has been rigorous and flexible in overseeing the production process, and Courtney Berger, Katie Courtland, Jennifer Hill, Michael McCullough, and Laura Sell have been as professional, responsive, and friendly as any writer could wish. Jan Williams, not of Duke but a good fit here, has created an index that is elegant and insightful. Extra special thanks must be reserved for my editor, Ken Wissoker, with whom I have shared some memorable evenings, and whose taste in music and food is never less than excellent. Boundless in his enthusiasm and global in his outlook, Ken has been good enough to allow me to run with ideas that have appeared improbable, and has also revealed a knack for making key suggestions at decisive moments. Above all, he has established Duke as a publishing house that nurtures dissenting voices with care and integrity, as well as urgency and wonder, even when these voices aren’t easily marketed. Could there be a better home for a biography of Arthur Russell? Writing a book about someone who has passed away has reminded me continually of my parents, who died when I was young, but who continue to inform so much of what I do; I wish they were around. During the final weeks of writing, my mother’s cousin Helen Franks, who must have been the first member of my family to publish a book, succumbed to a terrible illness; her vivacious mind and warm hospitality are missed. This book is dedicated to my wife, Enrica, who means everything to me and who helps me make sense of the world, and also to my two young daughters, Carlotta and Ilaria, who are such wonderful little and not-so-little human beings, and who carry such joy and hope. I’m lucky and thankful.\n\nxxviii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nIntroduction\n\nArthur Russell hailed from the Midwest, yet felt at home in downtown New York. Outwardly normal to those who observed his checkered shirt and acne-scarred face, he trod the mazelike streets that ran from the battered tenements of the East Village to the abandoned piers on the West Side Highway for hours at a time, and on a daily basis. The labyrinthine infrastructure and contrasting neighborhoods of lower Manhattan suited his purpose: equipped with a portable tape recorder or, when it became available, a Sony Walkman, Russell would play Abba alongside Mongolian throat music, or Bohannon back-to-back with Terry Riley, or Peggy Seeger followed by Grandmaster Flash—selections that were drawn from the global spectrum of sound and summoned the disjunctive backdrop of the city. Stopping only to offer his headphones to a friend, or to note an idea on one of the score sheets he stuffed into his bulging pockets, or to watch the sunset over the Hudson, Russell was a musical nomad who had downtown imprinted onto his sneakers. New York, a hub for sonic invention, hosted a spell of particularly manic productivity during the 1970s and 1980s, and Russell, who lived in the city from 1973 to 1992, became one of its most audacious musicians. Striving for a level of sonic mobility that matched his winding walks and unpredictable tape selections, Russell wrote and recorded folk, pop, new-wave, dance, and orchestral music while composing songs for the\n\ncello, all in a rush of scene-hopping simultaneity that carried him through many of downtown’s most vital spaces. Disco at the Loft, the Gallery, and the Paradise Garage; new music at the Kitchen Center for Video and Music (better known simply as “the Kitchen”) and the Experimental Intermedia Foundation; country at Sobossek’s and the Lower Manhattan Ocean Club; new wave and experimental pop at CBGB’s and Danceteria; hip-hop and electro at the Roxy; poetry at St. Mark’s; salsa on the streets of the East Village—skipping between these sounds and scenes with the nonchalant ease of a kid playing hopscotch, Russell embodied the creative mayhem of an era in which parties shimmered with energy and gigs brimmed with intent. A roamer at heart, Russell’s performances and recordings made him uniquely qualified to navigate the baroque complexity of the downtown music scene during this period. It would have been forgivable if Russell’s music sounded like the work of an amateur idealist, such was the scope of his migrant hike, but in fact his contributions were consistently notable. As an orchestral musician he worked as the music director at the Kitchen, the groundbreaking venue for experimental composition, and recorded pieces for the pioneering composer Philip Glass and the avant-garde theatre director Robert Wilson. In the pop/rock sphere Russell put together demos for Columbia Records’ legendary A & R executive, John Hammond, who believed Russell had the potential to become the next Bob Dylan, and he also played with the Necessaries, a new-wave band signed to Sire Records. Exploring the outer reaches of dance, he recorded a series of twelve-inch singles that blazed a trail between disco and house, working with pioneering engineers, producers, and remixers such as Bob Blank, Walter Gibbons, François Kevorkian, and Larry Levan. As he deepened his work, he cultivated a critically acclaimed voice-cello aesthetic that drew on orchestral music, dub, folk, and dance. Along the way he cofounded Sleeping Bag Records, one of the most influential independent labels for hip-hop and club music in the 1980s. Russell recognized that the new-music compositional movement, minimalist rock, and disco/dance shared an interest in stripped-down instrumentation, trancelike repetition, and affective intensity, and so he worked between genres; while many of his contemporaries found his vision unconvincing, history has demonstrated he was simply ahead of his time. As a composer, Russell helped pioneer the eventually prolific dialogue between\n\nIntroduction\n\norchestral music and pop/rock, and he reached out to black dance with more energy than any of his downtown peers. His use of classical Indian, Western orchestral, and jazz techniques helped establish the future coordinates of mutant disco, or disco-not-disco. And although some deemed his introduction of a skittish syncopation into his twelve-inch repertoire to be undanceable, the sound went on to be popularized by broken beat and then dubstep years down the line. Anticipating the emergence of indie music, Russell also developed a strand of folk-oriented pop that was emotionally honest and delicately vulnerable. By the time indie had established this style as its own, he was busy introducing a black funk and hip-hop sensibility into his electronic pop—a combination that remains a leap too far for most guitar bands to this day. Despite his itinerant sensibility, Russell has been recognized largely for just one set of recordings, his dance productions, which charted an aesthetic escape from the commercial cul-de-sac of late disco. Featuring David Byrne’s highly-strung rhythm guitar, the twelve-inch single “Kiss Me Again” contained enough dissonance for it to become Sire’s first foray into the disco arena. Remixed by Larry Levan, “Is It All Over My Face?” supplanted the polished aesthetic of late seventies disco with the bumpier atmosphere of the downtown dance floor. The equally pivotal “Go Bang! #5” featured a combination of orchestral and R & B musicians as well as the studio trickery of François Kevorkian. Even “Let’s Go Swimming” and “School Bell/Treehouse,” which failed to impress DJs when they were released, have resonated with gathering force over time. Russell’s twelveinch dance singles outsold his nondance releases by some distance, and this trend continued for several years after he died, during which time they appeared with gathering frequency on compilations that explored the less commercial recordings of the disco era as well as its mutant aftermath. Yet they also reverberated beyond dance, for Russell was set on taking the marginalized aesthetics of disco and even hip-hop into the heart of downtown. Quirky, fragile, and pensive, Russell’s songs didn’t have anything like the same kind of impact as his dance productions, in part because so few of them were released, but a series of posthumous albums have highlighted this side of his craft. “I don’t think there’s any other songwriting where the music and the lyrics are of the same order,” says the bass player and songwriter Ernie Brooks, who worked with Russell across the better part of two Introduction\n\ndecades. “Musically Bob Dylan was not nearly as advanced as Arthur. John Lennon comes close. There are songs and there are songs, but Arthur’s songs are the ones I always want to listen to.” Unsure of his looks as well as his voice, Russell was always on the lookout for a vocalist who could deliver his compositions to a wider audience, yet most of the candidates ended up deferring back to Russell, whose agile technique enabled him to sail across his hieroglyphic lines. Invention came easily to him, and in May 2004 the Wire included Russell among its list of sixty writers who have contributed to the reinvention of the song form.1 The ability to move without inhibition—to record and listen without prejudice—was pivotal to Russell. When asked how his voice-cello album World of Echo (1986) related to earlier dance releases, he replied, “I think, ultimately, you’ll be able to make dance records without using any drums at all,” forgetting to mention that choreographers were already working with his acoustic songs.2 As if to demonstrate the mutability of sound, Russell enjoyed rolling the same set of lyrics over a range of instrumental backdrops, and he ended up moving with such freedom it became impossible to associate him with a single style. This set him apart from other radically open-minded downtowners, such as Rhys Chatham, Philip Glass, Peter Gordon, and Peter Zummo, who worked across art music, pop, rock, and jazz, yet were ultimately rooted in the compositional scene, as well as from Laurie Anderson and David Byrne, whose eclecticism could be located in experimental pop. No navigation system could pinpoint the whereabouts of Russell. “He was way ahead of other people in understanding that the walls between concert music and popular music and avant-garde music were illusory, that they need not exist,” comments Glass, who participated in the exploration of rock while remaining rooted in orchestral music. “He lived in a world in which those walls weren’t there.” It’s tempting to believe that each time Russell picked up a musical instrument or entered a recording studio, he paused to wonder what would happen if he tried to do things differently. Russell devolved the responsibilities of the conductor to his musicians during rehearsals for an orchestral performance; he shepherded a bunch of percussion-happy dancers into Blank Tapes Studios in order to capture their energy on vinyl; he opened windows to let the “musicianship of the street” feed into his mixes; he encouraged gospel-trained vocalists to unlearn what they had been taught in order to become more expressive; and when he spotted an old school\n\nIntroduction\n\nfriend playing a broken guitar, he whisked him into the studio because, as Donald Murk (a companion from that moment) notes, he believed that “everybody has a voice.” As Russell explored the limits of musicianship, accomplished collaborators gleaned ideas about how they could develop their practice. “Arthur played a ‘classical/acoustic’ instrument, yet embraced and experimented with every new electronic gadget he could afford or get his hands on,” explains the percussionist Mustafa Ahmed. “Whenever he learned about a new drum machine or synthesizer, he would tell me about it. In spite of my initial opposition, he purchased electronic drum pads and gave them to me to use when I performed with him. That forced me to learn the new technology, and I eventually came to incorporate these new devices into other aspects of my music.” In the end Russell spread himself across too many scenes and worked with too many musicians to build up a major reputation in a single genre, yet his lack of commercial success cannot be attributed solely to the music industry’s distrust of eclecticism. Russell’s perfectionism was peppered with obstinacy—on one occasion he spent a whole day fine-tuning the sound of a kick drum while his co-musicians waited to begin—and collaborators became so accustomed to his protracted methods they learned to stop asking what they were working on, or when a certain piece might be finished. The Walkman contributed to Russell’s indecisiveness inasmuch as it enabled him to switch between two versions of a demo recording again and again as he tried to decide which was superior. But although Russell found it easy to become embroiled in a cycle of introspection, his recordings rarely suffered from the attention to detail. Like that of an accomplished improviser, the ease of his sound masked the prodigious amount of work that went into its making. There was something beautiful about Russell’s reluctance to decide on a final mix for many of his works. Playing, recording, and mixing amounted to a process of possibility, with every route a choice almost too tempting to resist, and the step of deciding on a final version—when a song would become static and therefore experience a form of death—often too painful to take. Instead Russell preferred to see music as a process that could reproduce itself in infinite ways and, in so doing, hint at the complexity and innate possibility of the universe. When he wrote orchestral music, Russell was drawn to the “generative” or “open form” approach championed by Christian Wolff (one of his mentors) because it allowed the musicians to Introduction\n\nembark on an uncharted exploration of sound. Dance music appealed in part because the practice of remixing allowed songs to experience several lives. Opportunities to release multiple versions of the same song were otherwise scarce, yet Russell generated something like a thousand reelto-reel tapes of unreleased recordings. Because much of that music was unfinished, it contained the promise of future life. Nevertheless Russell’s perfectionism and philosophical resistance to finishing shouldn’t obscure the fact that his output was substantial before he died in 1992 of complications arising from AIDS. In addition to his twelveinch singles, Russell released four albums of his own music and two albums with the Necessaries, even though he didn’t release any of the music recorded during the last five years of his life—a period of deliberate procrastination that risks overshadowing the years in which he was notably more successful (in terms of delivering an end product). “In those days it was hard to get a record released, and Arthur released more records than any of us,” notes Ned Sublette, a downtown collaborator. “That was part of his mystique. Despite everything, he was visibly in the process of creating a body of work on record.” Russell also laid down enough electronic pop, folk-oriented rock, acoustic songs, and off-the-wall dance tracks to fill four posthumous albums of previously unreleased material—Another Thought (1994), Calling out of Context (2004), Springfield (2006), and Love Is Overtaking Me (2008)—while another posthumous release, First Thought Best Thought (2006), included previously unreleased compositional pieces. With more albums of fresh material promised, Russell is beginning to look prolific, especially for a so-called serial procrastinator. Whether they nestled within or between the coordinates of genre, these recordings always sounded particular. “Russell’s work is stranded between lands real and imagined: the street and the cornfield; the soft bohemian New York and the hard Studio 54 New York; the cheery bold strokes of pop and the liberating possibilities of abstract art,” wrote Sasha Frere-Jones in the New Yorker in 2004. “Arthur Russell didn’t dissolve these borders so much as wander past them, humming his own song.”3 Innocent yet sophisticated, light yet serious, smooth yet angular, Russell’s sonic identity contained seemingly irreconcilable contradictions, something that the Loft host David Mancuso captures when he describes him as being “Dylan and Coltrane rolled into one.” The guitarist Gary Lucas, who has worked with the “trailblazers” Captain Beefheart and Jeff Buckley, remains captivated\n\nIntroduction\n\nby Russell, with whom he worked in the 1980s. “There was the Corn-Belttransplanted-to-New-York sensibility, the gay sensibility, the Buddhist sensibility—everything was in the mix,” he comments. “That’s what the best artists do. They give you a striking sense of personality.” Given his dynamic musical personality, it is perhaps surprising that Russell was also a bashful, complicated musician whose career could double as a tutorial in the frustration of narrative—including the tropes of self-made success and self-inflicted tragedy that run through so many biographies of musicians. Subdividing into a series of unresolved tangents, Russell’s life and work lacked a defining arc, and because his overwhelming concern was to get the music right, moments of commercial promise ended in argument or anticlimax. In the end Russell died a marginal figure because he wasn’t sufficiently self-centered, competitive, or coherent to convince the marketing departments of New York’s record companies to embrace his vision. But for those who judged him according to his ability to work collectively, creatively, and with contradiction, all without recourse to materialism and celebrity, his subjugated story suggested an alternative way of working in the world. “This was a musical revolt . . . and Arthur was part of it,” Glass noted in a 1995 interview. “We all became accepted except Arthur . . . He was an underground musician to the end of his life.”4 Russell remains a relatively marginal figure, even in accounts of the downtown era. Tom Johnson’s eyewitness account of downtown’s orchestral scene in the 1970s and early 1980s, The Voice of New Music, overlooks Russell, perhaps because the author (in the words of Sublette) “didn’t have a clue what our generation was doing.” Michael Musto was much more open to the innovative possibilities of popular culture, but his book Downtown celebrates the brash, the fashionable, and the extrovert, and Russell, who scored poorly on all of those counts, doesn’t get a mention. Marvin Taylor’s impressive edited collection from 2006, The Downtown Book, emphasizes the primitive anger, anxious nihilism, and postmodern confusion that ran through lower Manhattan between 1975 and 1984, and once again Russell doesn’t quite fit, even though downtown is lauded for having become a home for outsiders. Bringing together the photographs of Paula Court with a series of short essays by downtown players, the Soul Jazz publication New York Noise: Art and Music from the New York Underground, 1978–88 seemed certain to correct the historical record, but Russell was notoriously camera-shy and somehow slips away.5 A self-declared admirer, Introduction\n\nSimon Reynolds mentions Russell only briefly in his groundbreaking history of postpunk, Rip It Up and Start Again, because Russell didn’t have a significant impact on postpunk consciousness.6 Nor did Russell feature in Kyle Gann’s collection of writings on the downtown experimental scene, Music Downtown, perhaps because, as Gann wrote in his obituary of Russell, “he simply vanished into his own music.”7 The omission of Russell doesn’t amount to a conspiracy, or even an act of negligence, because he didn’t insist upon being heard or seen. “His importance has not been appreciated as broadly as it should because he left such a small paper trail,” comments Bernard Gendron, author of Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club, who didn’t include Russell alongside Laurie Anderson, Glenn Branca, Rhys Chatham, and Peter Gordon in his list of the key representatives of downtown’s “borderline aesthetic” because Russell left so little evidence of his work.8 As with many other histories of U.S. popular music, however, the foregrounding of downtown’s more audible and visible performers has resulted in the masculine and the straight being privileged above the feminine and the queer, as well as the white above the black and the Latin. While there is no disputing the influence of individuals such as Glenn Branca, James Chance, Rhys Chatham, and Richard Hell, as well as groups such as Blondie, the New York Dolls, the Ramones, Sonic Youth, Suicide, the Swans, Talking Heads, and the Velvet Underground, the historical focus on rock and its exchange with the noisier end of compositional music has helped strengthen the reputations of players who were already prominent. Insofar as they are recognized, African Americans have managed to appear on the periphery when they are masculine (such as the breakdancers and DJs of hip-hop, and the intrepid performers of free jazz) or when they have augmented white players (such as the session musicians who performed on Remain in Light). Meanwhile women have appeared, in general, if they reproduced the masculine (e.g., Lydia Lunch, Patti Smith), embraced a boyish techno-coldness (e.g., Laurie Anderson), or played the blonde seductress (e.g., Debbie Harry). Even given these restraints, downtown’s producers of pop, folk, and—above all—disco haven’t featured at all. Russell’s story, which is also a story of his collaborations, counterbalances rather than displaces these versions of the downtown era. Russell lived in a neighborhood that was heavily Latin, went to clubs that were predominantly gay and black, hung out with women who were drawn to\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe ethereal, and wrote songs with guys who were interested in the sublime. As he went about his work, Russell recorded rock and orchestral music, and when these scenes appeared to be trapped in a demographic or aesthetic loop, he mixed things up. “Arthur was always the one to bring in people from different backgrounds—blacks, gays, people from Brooklyn and the Bronx,” notes Zummo. “To him there was no question that these people could be drawn into the white downtown avant-garde scene. I would have never met Mustafa Ahmed if it hadn’t been for Arthur.” No other downtowner engaged with the visceral, creative, transcendental world of black gay aesthetics to the same degree as Russell, and the results could be heard in his performances and recordings. “Many New York artists around that time were using aggression and anxiety in their work,” wrote Ben Ratliff in the New York Times in 2004. “Russell’s work had no aggression in it whatsoever, but patience and kindness instead; this is one of the reasons it doesn’t now feel stuck in its time.”9 If downtown was violent, poor, dangerous, competitive, and macho— and it’s worth questioning the extent to which the macho element might have overstated the toughness of the conditions—Russell tried to not let it get to him. He lived in the East Village because as well as being hazardous, it was rich in rhythm and community. He frequented the seedy dives where desolation and unease were de rigueur, but preferred to hang out in the celebratory venues of downtown dance. And while a number of downtowners expressed a combination of poetic aggression and anxious frustration, he chose to introduce fun, sensitivity, and humor into his music. Along with Tom Lee, his supportive partner, these factors might have helped Russell survive, for while most of his peers ended up leaving downtown for more moderate climes, he stuck it out until the end of his life. “Downtown was a discourse on the nullification of absolutes that needs the full cacophonous chorus to be heard,” comments the popular-culture critic Carlo McCormick in The Downtown Book. Because his inquisitive ear, light feet, and generous spirit led him to work in so many scenes, Russell offers a rather lovely way to explore the musical elements of this chorus.10\n\nIntroduction\n\n1 Formations (1951–1973)\n\nCharles Arthur Russell—or Chuck—was born in Oskaloosa, Iowa, to a Methodist father and a Quaker mother in 1922. Having graduated from high school, he attended Parks Air College until he was expelled for spending too much time in Missouri, where his Oskaloosan girlfriend, Emily Alsop, was studying liberal arts. During World War II Chuck joined the U.S. Navy, after which he was accepted into flight school and married Emily, who gave birth to their first daughter, Kate, in 1946. By then Chuck had enrolled at Iowa State University to study civil engineering, and as he supplemented his GI Bill income with a series of unglamorous jobs, Chuck switched programs before he gave up his studies in order to open an insurance agency in the fall of 1948. Chuck and Emily’s second child, Julie, was born in 1949, and a couple of years later, on 21 May 1951, the arrival of their first son, Charles Arthur, marked the completion of the family. Although nobody remarked upon it at the time, it would later appear significant that he was born on the night of a full moon. Like John Cage, Captain Beefheart, La Monte Young, Harry Partch, Steve Reich, Lou Reed, Tom Waits, Frank Zappa, and other maverick musicians and composers born in the United States, Charles Arthur ended up developing a bold aesthetic practice that appeared to bear no relation to his place of birth. Founded in 1835 by Captain Nathan Boone, who had been ordered to find some land and build a\n\nfort, Oskaloosa was situated in the heart of the Corn Belt, some sixty miles southeast of Des Moines, the state capital of Iowa. It matured into a small municipality of some ten thousand residents, which made it the third largest town in Iowa. In 1938 Fortune magazine ran a feature titled “Oskaloosa vs. the U.S.,” having selected Oskaloosa as the subject because it was considered to be a perfectly typical town, and in 1950 the town was honored with a Freedom Foundation Award. Born the following year, Charles Arthur would later conclude that his idea of freedom could be best pursued elsewhere, and he ended up running away from home at the age of sixteen. Within a few years he was writing post-minimalist orchestral music, angular folk songs for the cello, and avant-garde disco—music that sounded strange to Chuck and Emily, never mind their Oskaloosan friends. Yet although Oskaloosa was a conservative town situated in a conservative state, Charley (as he liked to be referred to) was also challenged with the task of escaping a conservative era. “With the help of the GI Bill, men were ushered into schools and professions that would boost their economic status,” explains his sister Kate. “At the same time, the government, the corporations, and the media pushed for larger families, forcing women to give up their wartime jobs and settle for so-called woman’s work. But it was also an era of hope.” Having worked hard and seized his opportunities, Chuck flourished in his new insurance business, while Emily’s parents, the owners of the largest department store in Oskaloosa, also profited from the postwar economic boom. Elsewhere in the United States, economics and culture moved according to a similar rhythm. “Although activists and liberals may have been disappointed at the slow pace of social reform after World War II, the attention of most Americans was so riveted on the astonishing new world of consumerism and prosperity that social issues—for the moment, at least—seemed relatively unimportant,” writes the historian William Chafe. “Rarely has a society experienced such rapid or dramatic change as that which occurred in America after 1945.”1 Prosperity didn’t make the Russells synonymous with traditionalism, and they revealed themselves to be significantly less conservative than some of their friends at their country club when they adopted plans (put together by Chuck’s architect brother) to build a redwood home in the style of Frank Lloyd Wright. But they could find no reason to challenge other widely accepted conventions, so Kate, Julie, and Charley would return from school to find Emily curled up in a chair, reading the latest selec12\n\nOne\n\ntion from the Book-of-the-Month Club, and when Chuck returned from his office a little later, Emily would cook up a casserole while he put on a record. Stretching to the end of the flat Iowan horizon, the only clouds that lingered were “lucky ones” (as Charley would write later in his song “Lucky Cloud”). “Life was getting better, and my parents, along with almost everyone else, embraced the new lifestyle,” adds Kate. “Who wouldn’t after fifteen years of depression and war?” Relocating to Iowa City and then to San Francisco before settling in New York City, Charley would move farther and farther away from the calm, protected enclave of Oskaloosa, and each departure would add weight to his maverick credentials. As Michael Broyles argues, the tradition of the maverick musician lies at the center of “possibly the strongest and most sacred myth of American society, that of rugged individualism,” and the “inability or in some cases conscious unwillingness of the mavericks to compromise has been precisely why their voices have remained clear, or at least why they were not overwhelmed by the predominant European culture.”2 Charley certainly found it difficult to compromise, and he left the Midwest not in order to lead an equivalent lifestyle in another part of the country, but instead to find a different group of friends, a contrasting set of social expectations, and ultimately, a more vibrant music culture. “Oskaloosa is a nice-sized town, but it’s certainly rural,” comments Emily. “The opportunities in a community of this size for a boy like Charley were limited.” Chuck adds that his son needed to leave Oskaloosa in order to pursue his dream. “Looking back, I don’t think we would be talking about him today if he hadn’t run away. If he had stayed at home, he might have become an insurance agent or something.” For all his rebellious tendencies, however, Charley never left the experience of his childhood in Oskaloosa entirely behind. As a kid, he loved to listen to Chuck tell stories about the wind and the high seas of the South Pacific, where he had served on a minesweeper, and Chuck’s passion for music was another formative influence. Milling around the stereo, Charley would have heard Chuck select a range of classical composers, including Brahms, Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart, and Vivaldi, while on other occasions his father would opt for the songs of Frank Sinatra, Aretha Franklin, or Bessie Smith. More often than not, however, Chuck would pick out some jazz from his collection of three to four hundred LPs. Dave Brubeck, the Modern Jazz Quartet, and Ahmad Jamal featured regularly, Formations (1951–1973)\n\n13\n\nas did Leonard Bernstein’s What Is Jazz?. Instrumentalists who played with “real rhythm,” such as Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, and Fats Waller, raised the temperature, as did the full-throttle Dixieland of Bob Crosby and his Bobcats, Tommy Dorsey, and Jimmy Rushing. When Chuck was in the mood for something calmer, he favored the more sophisticated playing and writing of Duke Ellington, Jimmy Giuffre, and Teddy Wilson, along with the musicals and film scores of André Previn. This music continued to run through Charley long after he thought he had left Oskaloosa behind. Emily’s musical influence might have been even more profound. Having played the bass viola in her younger years, she took up the cello around the time Charley started to go to school, and when she wasn’t practicing in the family’s music room, she would sit down with Charley and talk about classical music as it played on the stereo. More musical than his sisters, Charley took up the piano when he was in second grade, aged six, and soon started to play by ear. His first tutor, Cecil Penniston, one of a handful of African Americans who lived in Oskaloosa, focused on theory, after which Raymond Comstock, who led the high-school orchestra, concentrated on getting him to read music—specifically because this was something Charley believed he could avoid. In the fourth grade Charley thought about switching to the trombone, but chose the cello when he was told he could join the school orchestra straight away (rather than wait a semester) if he opted for a stringed instrument. That decision deepened Charley’s musical bond with his mother, even if the two of them ended up fighting over access to the cello until Chuck bought his wife a $650 replacement. When he reached sixth grade, Chuck and Emily agreed to let him travel alone to Des Moines in order to take private classes at Drake University. Acknowledging Charley’s progress and talent, the school asked him to compose music for its production of The Emperor’s New Clothes, which was performed in the spring of 1966. After someone complimented Charley on the music he replied, “Just wait till I finish it.”3 Charley’s musical progress couldn’t paper over his shortcomings, however, and as he grew older Chuck and Emily began to worry about his social skills. Unlike his father, who was an athletics enthusiast, Charley preferred dinosaurs, Erector Sets, astronomy, fish, puppet-making, and magic to sports, and he broke his arm attempting the high jump on one of the few occasions he tried to be more athletic. Charley’s refusal to take sports 14\n\nOne\n\nFour-year-old Charley takes a bath with Kate (left) and Julie (center), 1955. Photograph by Charles Arthur Russell Sr. Courtesy of Charles Arthur Russell Sr. and Emily Russell.\n\nseriously became a major source of friction, especially with Emily and Kate, who feared it would mark him out as being irredeemably different from other boys, and some fierce battles ensued. “He was named exactly like my father, and it seemed like he had to be like my father,” says Kate, who attempted to play the role of mediator when arguments broke out, but usually ended up backing her parents. Having made Charley run laps around the backyard pond when he went through a chubby-boy phase, Chuck took to admonishing him for being a “poor sport” when he reacted badly to things not going his way, and although the barb was delivered with ribbing humor, it always drove Charley crazy. “At that moment when he really needed us, I think we failed him to a certain degree,” adds Kate. As Charley’s adolescent angst deepened, an aggressive rash of acne erupted over his face and back, and it’s possible that the success of Kate (who was outgoing, creative, and flamboyant), Julie (who blossomed into a popular homecoming queen), and Chuck (who became mayor of Oskaloosa in January 1964) compounded his sense of being an outsider and maybe also a failure. Morose and timid, awkward and dreamy, self-absorbed Formations (1951–1973)\n\n15\n\nCharley during his astronomy phase, 1962. Photograph by Charles Arthur Russell Sr. Courtesy of Charles Arthur Russell Sr. and Emily Russell.\n\nand self-conscious, Charley was an outwardly square kid, and although he was undoubtedly bright, his cleverness could be irritating. The owner of an unpleasant temper, Charley also required only the mildest provocation or mishap to go into a sulk or a rage, and he became something of a loner. “He was abnormal from the point of view of the all-American boy,” says Chuck. “He was different, and I think kids made fun of him.” At this juncture nobody could have imagined that he would only come into his own in downtown New York; even less that he would manage this with many of his personality traits intact. Charley wasn’t completely friendless, however, and it came as some relief to Chuck and Emily when he struck up a friendship with Kent Goshorn, who had been “kind of impressed” when he saw Charley react with laughter rather than tears after breaking his arm at the high jump. Although Goshorn was used to hanging out with what he calls “jock types,” he shared Charley’s interest in the arts as well as his frustration with life in Oskaloosa, and they started to get together for music-listening sessions when Chuck 16\n\nOne\n\nCharley Russell, 1964. Photographer ​ unknown. Courtesy of Tom Lee.\n\nand Emily went out on a Saturday night and the house was theirs to claim. During these evenings Goshorn would regularly pick out “British invasion” rock, while Charley would select a mix of classical music, folk, and jazz. “I would go over to his house to trade records, and trying to be precocious, I would bring out Bob Dylan or James Brown or something like that,” Goshorn commented later. “Arthur would bring out Stravinsky and John Coltrane.” At the same time, Charley also attempted to influence the taste of his parents, who didn’t appreciate rock and roll. “[Chuck and Emily] had a stereo system and the speakers went into their bedroom,” recalls Goshorn. “Charley would play the Rolling Stones at very low volume when they were sleeping to ‘re-programme them,’ so he said.”4 Entering into the countercultural spirit of the era, Charley and Goshorn also read poetry, smoked pot, and grew their hair long, and when the high school authorities started to quash this modest wave of oppositional culture in the fall of 1964, Charley refused to conform. “Come on, Charley,” Chuck and Emily would say. “You can’t rock the boat too much.” But the rocking had only just begun, and during 1965, Chuck’s second year as mayor, Charley started to spend time with a group of older boys and Formations (1951–1973)\n\n17\n\nyoung men who bonded around a commitment to rock and roll, folk music, and the arts, as well as a willingness to experiment with marijuana and LSD. “To me it was a spiritual awakening,” says Leon Van Weelden, one of Kate’s former high-school sweethearts and an established member of the group. “Having grown up in a conservative, fundamentalist religious community and family, it was an opening for me to see life through a totally different lens.” Appearing in black jeans and a white shirt, and demonstrating a preference for music that the rest of the group found uninteresting or incomprehensible, Charley became an awkward presence. “Some people saw him as a kind of nuisance,” recalls Van Weelden, who had been a dedicated sports enthusiast until he tried acid to the accompaniment of Eastern music and the Book of Dao. “He was a goofy little kid and we weren’t sure whether he was cool enough to hang out with us, or trustworthy enough to keep his mouth shut, or stable enough not to get into trouble one way or another.” Possessing the right combination of determination and intellectual flair, however, Charley was allowed to stick around, and in 1966, the group judged him to be ready to trip. “There were times when he would do marijuana or LSD for two or three days in a row and every weekend,” adds Van Weelden. “He sometimes went to school while he was tripping. He was pretty indiscriminate and really didn’t have any boundaries at that point. It was a blessing and a curse. It allowed him to explore without judgement. It helped form who he was.” Chuck’s and Emily’s tolerance reached its limit during this period. Although they didn’t discover he was experimenting with LSD until later, the realization that he was reading Timothy Leary—one of the key philosophers of the psychedelic movement—left them deeply worried. When they realized he was smoking marijuana, a relatively unknown drug at the time, they booked a session with a psychologist. Charley’s sophomore-year grades were disappointing rather than disastrous—he received a middling mixture of Bs and Cs, plus a D for P.E.—but Chuck and Emily believed he could do better and remained troubled by his disobedient, slothful, belligerent demeanor. Tempers spilled over eventually when Charley refused to cut his hair and swore in front of Emily, which prompted Chuck to “bounce him on the floor” (as Chuck puts it). The Russells were both furious and distraught that they had lost control of their wayward son, while Charley’s overriding concern was to escape from Oskaloosa. 18\n\nOne\n\nIowa City\n\nThe Russell family had always traveled around. Languid summers were spent in Minnesota, where Emily’s parents owned a cabin by one of the state’s ten thousand lakes, and it was there that C. C., Emily’s father, taught Charley how to drive a boat and fish. Cutting through Texas, the Russells also went on a road trip to Mexico and headed to the Gulf of Mexico before they made their way to Acapulco, where they came face to face with the Pacific Ocean. On a subsequent holiday they went to Chicago, where they visited museums and journeyed on the subway in order to witness the city’s tenements and slums. Chuck and Emily had built their home in the Midwest, but they wore UN-tinted spectacles and wanted their children to see the world. The vacations helped create a striking impression of the land that lay beyond Oskaloosa, as well as a working knowledge of how to get around, and when Goshorn traveled with his family to live in California, Charley was left with one less reason to remain in his hometown. In 1967 the Summer of Love broadcast the news that the best action was happening on the West Coast, and when Van Weelden moved to the liberal outpost of Iowa City, a realistic escape route began to materialize. Having already visited Iowa City, Charley declared a preference for continuing his high school education at University High, a progressive institution that was open to the children of professors at the University of Iowa. So toward the end of 1967, when he was sixteen years old, Charley ran away from home and went to camp on Van Weelden’s sofa in Iowa City. Responding to Chuck’s and Emily’s concern, a well-connected friend helped Charley enroll in University High, while Chuck and Emily agreed to give Van Weelden (who had conducted himself well during his relationship with Kate) a contribution toward his living expenses. “Letting Arthur [as Charley would soon call himself ] go to Iowa City and live with Leon was really smart,” says Kate. “Leon was on Arthur’s wavelength and Arthur needed space. He needed to follow whatever dream he was dreaming. He ran away and we had to let go. It was a good thing.” Chuck and Emily attempted to ease their anxiety by acquiring a thirty-foot, two-mast sailboat. In the end, Charley didn’t spend much time with Van Weelden. Once classes at University High were over for the day, he would head off with Formations (1951–1973)\n\n19\n\nLeft: Charley (far right) with his sisters and cousins while on vacation at Gull Lake, ​ Minnesota, 1956.

It wasn’t problematic. He was just unrestrained.” When Van Weelden left for California, Charley stayed in Iowa City and moved in with a preacher, but he didn’t settle down, and it appears that he spent a good number of nights out, often sleeping on the floor of a musician friend’s house. Unsurprisingly, he continued to slip further behind in his studies. San Francisco\n\nShacking up in an apartment of some “druggy friends” from Oskaloosa and Iowa City that was located between Haight-Ashbury and the old Fillmore District, Charley and Goshorn visited San Francisco during spring break of 1968 and returned to live there in the summer. “We didn’t ask if we could stay,” remembers Goshorn. “We just moved in and found a place on the couch.” Indifferent to the wider countercultural movement, Charley avoided discussing the Vietnam War and also steered clear of the rock scene that had gelled around the Monterey Pop Festival of June 1967, perhaps because, as Goshorn maintains, it was easier for him to be “different and ‘ahead’ of everyone else” if he was into Cage rather than Hendrix. Goshorn also felt Charley became distant and elusive during this period, and as LSD became an inconsequential part of their lives and their Oskaloosan bond weakened, they drifted apart. Enough of a connection remained for them to stick together when they decided to move out of the apartment; their roommates were heavily into heroin, and after a while it became too much. Charley found the two of them a room in a nearby commune, and they started to sell psychedelic newspapers to earn some money. But their relationship continued to sour, and a month or two later Goshorn moved to a rural commune. Left to his own devices, Charley appears to have drifted until he was arrested in early 1969. “The police explained to me that he was in a place where they investigated and found marijuana,” recalls Chuck. “Since he was underage, they wouldn’t release him until he turned eighteen.” The police were familiar with this kind of situation—the number of minors living outside parental care in San Francisco had skyrocketed during the second half of the 1960s—and they proceeded to ask the Russells if they Formations (1951–1973)\n\n21\n\nwanted Charley to be held in a detention home or sent back to Oskaloosa. “We consulted a friend who worked in law enforcement and he said, ‘If you force him home, you may never see him again.’ So I called back and said, ‘Hold and release!’” Rather than stay in the detention center, or return to Oskaloosa, however, Charley joined Kailas Shugendo, a Buddhist commune, on 14 February 1969, and he was released to its custody. Combining the teachings of the Tibetan Buddhist priest Lama Anagarika Govinda with the mountain asceticism practiced by the Shugenja followers of Japanese Shingon Buddhism, Dr N. G. Pemchekov Warwick founded Kailas Shugendo in the late 1960s. The name reflected his mongrel outlook: Kailas alludes to the revered Mount Kailas in Tibet, while Shugendo is the name given to the Shugenja’s brand of mountain asceticism. Mountain walking became a regular activity, while fire ceremonies (during which mantras were recited and participants walked across burning coals) took place on a weekly and later daily basis. Fair-skinned, dark-haired, and in possession of a Buddha-like paunch, Warwick called himself Ajari, which is the Japanese translation of the Sanskrit term for “senior teacher.” The circumstances of Charley Russell’s entry into Kailas Shugendo remain hazy. He had shown an interest in Buddhism back in Iowa, and the public adoption of the religion by the beat writers Richard Alpert, Gary Snyder, Jack Kerouac, and Allen Ginsberg, who were read by Charley, might have created a lasting impression. He didn’t get involved in Buddhism during his first months in San Francisco, and Kailas Shugendo was also a nonproselytizing organization, but Ajari Warwick was a charismatic public figure who needed to build up his commune’s numbers, and it’s conceivable that Charley joined the organization a little more readily than might have otherwise been the case when the police asked him to identify an adult guardian as a condition of his release. At the very least, Charley joined Kailas Shugendo at a time when he was alone and vulnerable. Because the commune lacked its own building, Charley stayed in a single room on Bush Street, and when Goshorn called on him that summer, they headed off to the Santa Cruz mountains for three days, during which time Goshorn hiked while Charley stayed put and played his cello (which he originally had left behind in Oskaloosa but had now recovered). After that Charley was taken into the Mill Valley home of Terry and Lorna Mills, who 22\n\nOne\n\nwere both members of Kailas Shugendo, and when Terry and Lorna started to call Charley “Jigmé,” the name stuck, maybe because Charley thought it would enable him to shed another layer of his Oskaloosan skin. Following Kailas Shugendo’s purchase of its first house at 1551 Octavia Street in April 1970, Jigmé moved into the premises, and he remained a resident when the commune relocated to a tall wooden house on Pine Street, near Japantown, in July. An intimate and devoted disciple of Warwick, Jigmé cut his long hair in order to be inaugurated as a “tonsured novice priest”; he took part in liturgical training and spiritual guidance; and he was given the responsibility of stocking the commune with food and drink. In addition, he participated in the organization’s fire walking rituals, played cello at its fire ceremonies, and joined the Kailas Shugendo Mantric Sun Band, a country-Buddhist outfit led by Warwick. Settling into his new surroundings, he also became a drug-free, vegetarian teetotaler and enrolled at a local community college, where he would go on to earn the equivalent of a high-school diploma. “My life is definitely taking direction in the mountains,” he wrote to Chuck and Emily in March 1970. Loaded with duties, Jigmé barely had time to practice cello, yet the commune paid for him to start taking private lessons with Andor Toth, the youngest player in the San Francisco Symphony Chamber Orchestra, and in April Jigmé reported to Chuck and Emily that his playing was “coming along very nicely.” “Each time I visit my teacher there is improvement, and with it in all of my life,” he added. “Problems which I was confounded with a year ago no longer exist.” Jigmé took to practicing in his closet, not because playing was forbidden, but because it was a quiet spot where he wouldn’t be disturbed, and he also loved the acoustics of the confined space. As the sound swirled around and through his body, he lost the capacity to distinguish between himself and music, and playing became a form of meditation. Chuck and Emily Russell visited Charley (as they continued to call him) in January 1971 and could barely conceal their delight at his transformation. Dr. Warwick’s brand of West Coast Buddhism might have seemed strange to their Midwestern Christian sensibility, but as far as they were concerned, the Kailas Shugendo guru had weaned their son away from drugs and enabled him to return to school and the cello. Kate visited later in the spring and glimpsed the commune’s magnetic appeal when she attended one of Formations (1951–1973)\n\n23\n\nJigmé and Emily Russell at a farmer’s market in San Francisco, 1971.

Sitting in yoga postures on tiered benches, some twenty-five congregants chanted as Jigmé played cello, and as the fire grew stronger, the chanting became louder. “I was almost transformed,” she remembers. “I could have seen myself getting involved.” Kate recalls being concerned about Dr. Warwick’s level of control over his followers, which made her “shudder,” yet she also recognized that the commune had given Jigmé a sense of perspective and an opportunity to “grow up.” A North Indian classical musician, Ali Akbar Khan established the Ali Akbar College of Music at the end of 1967, the annus mirabilis for Indian music in the West, during which the Beatles released Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band (featuring George Harrison’s sitar on “Within You Without You”); Ravi Shankar performed at the Monterey Pop Festival (sharing the bill with Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Otis Redding, and the Who); and Shankar and Yehudi Menuhin won a Grammy for their album West Meets 24\n\nOne\n\nEast (after which they performed at a UN human rights concert that was broadcast around the world).5 Initially based in a rented room in Berkeley, the college relocated to Marin County when Khan decided the noise generated by the antiwar protests wasn’t conducive to study, and a little later it moved again, this time to San Rafael.6 As Khan’s profile soared—his album Shree Rag was nominated for a Grammy in 1970—G. S. Sachdev, a bansuri (bamboo flute) musician, and a stream of teachers from India worked with musicians such as the Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, the folk artist Jody Stecher, Great Society’s lead guitarist Darby Slick, and the bass and saxophone player Peter Van Gelder. An unprecedented number of Western players wanted to absorb Eastern classical music, and Arthur Russell became part of this movement. Lacking a formal structure, the college’s program encouraged indefinite study, and Arthur (as Jigmé preferred to be called in this environment) gave himself up to the musical vortex, taking instrumental and vocal classes with Khan and Sachdev, as well as vocal classes with Sengupta Ghosh, another teacher in the college. Even though it lay outside the conventions of Indian classical music, Arthur held on to his cello, and in a chance meeting he was joined on the instrument by Mark Levinson, whose unparalleled audiophile amplifiers would eventually power the sound system at the Loft in New York City (and bring perfect clarity to Arthur’s future dance recordings). Playing against the drone—a single note played over an extended period of time—Arthur practiced hard, and carried out a good deal of this work with Jeff Whittier, a flautist he met on Mount Shasta in August 1969. A follower of Mother Mary Mae Maier, a spiritual leader who had traveled widely in India and Tibet before settling on the north Californian mountain, Whittier had been sitting with his teacher when a member of Kailas Shugendo approached to see if Mother Mary would be prepared to meet the group. The representative left a copy of The Way of the White Clouds by Lama Anagarika Govinda, Warwick’s guru, and when Mother Mary caught sight of the picture of Govinda she said, “He’s real. I want to meet with them.”7 Dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and sneakers, Whittier walked across the glacier at an altitude of eleven thousand feet to relay the news, and later that evening, when Kailas Shugendo returned from the top of the mountain to its campsite at Bunny Flat, Ajari lit a great fire and Mother Mary spoke for hours. “We spent the whole night up on the mountain, and Arthur and I talked,” remembers Whittier, who was struck Formations (1951–1973)\n\n25\n\nby his new friend’s intelligence and grasp of Buddhist philosophy. “We discovered that we were both interested in Indian music right away.” Arthur and Whittier stayed in touch, and following the death of Mother Mary in 1970, Whittier traveled to the Ali Akbar College of Music; he enrolled in the program in June 1971. Forming a close friendship, Arthur and Whittier practiced the scales of unusual ragas and, echoing the structure of the bhajan (devotional song), in which poetic lines are repeated with subtle variations, they also developed riffs. Because Whittier played the flute, Sachdev’s bow-flute class—on music for bowed instruments and the flute—provided them with practice material, and, teaming up with a tabla player, they worked on playing in rhythm cycles. As Arthur’s practice deepened, he began to explore the particularities of the classical Indian idiom, including the existence of notes that appeared only as “accidentals” in Western music. It was as if Arthur had something in common with these notes: unclassifiable in the West, they were fully recognized, integrated, and liberated in the parallel framework of the East. But instead of exchanging one tradition for another, Arthur hoped to fuse the two together. “Arthur was very interested in the forms of Indian music,” says Whittier. “It was giving him pause for thought. He was soaking it up.” Through Whittier, Arthur also became close with Ellen Ziegler, who enrolled in the College full-time after graduating from Antioch College, and Alan Abrams, who joined as a way of pursuing a non-sectarian spiritual practice, having studied meditation in India with the guru Nimkroli Baba, the author of Be Here Now. “We all lived in these group houses, drifted back and forth, and stayed up all night,” recalls Ziegler, a vocalist who also played the flute and drums. “We were a bunch of enthusiastic, mind-altered Americans, and we all became obsessed.” Ziegler says she would sit down with Arthur and create “little rivers of music” in which they tried to bring “all these diverse elements together.” Abrams remembers taking part in practice sessions where students played or sang a single note until it drew everyone into its inescapable logic. “Arthur was also doing his other music on the side,” adds Abrams. “We played acoustic guitar together a lot—folk music. He wasn’t letting anyone dictate to him that he needed to make a choice.” In many respects the college embodied the experimental freedom of the countercultural movement; contrary to established educational practice, 26\n\nOne\n\nfor example, female and male students shared dorms and shower rooms. Yet it was also a conservative institution ruled by a powerful patriarch in which, according to Whittier, a core group (including Ziegler) became the personal disciples of Khan while others (including Abrams, Whittier, and Arthur) were made to feel peripheral. Instrumental choice was often a determining factor—Khan played the sarod and tended to prefer those who did the same—and although Arthur would comment later that the cello was Khan’s “favorite instrument,” it appears to have predetermined his failure to enter the honored inner circle, which bothered him.8 College politics didn’t come between Arthur, Abrams, Whittier, and Ziegler, however, and as conversations about Buddhism segued into dusk-to-dawn, free-flowing jams, they took to meeting in Mill Valley, where Ziegler and Whittier rented a room, or in Abrams’s vine-covered abode in San Geronimo Valley, or at the bottom of a tree in Bolinas where Abrams took occasional refuge, or Mount Shasta, where they would head at every opportunity, instruments strung over their shoulders, rucksacks strapped onto their backs. Having enrolled as a part-time student in the San Francisco Conservatory of Music in the summer of 1970, around the time he joined the Ali Akbar College, Arthur also pursued a conservatory education in Western art music. His educational experience there was less frigid than it might have been had he enrolled some ten or fifteen years earlier, when serialist composers, such as Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Milton Babbitt, dominated. Abandoning melody, harmony, progression, and resolution in favor of twelve-tone theory and complex atonality, the composers of serial music produced deliberately discordant works because the world remained riven with conflict, and they believed it was their responsibility to write pieces that revealed rather than papered over these fissures. “[New music] abandons the deception of harmony that has become unsustainable in the face of the catastrophe toward which reality is veering,” argues Theodor Adorno, the celebrated theorist of serialism, in Philosophy of New Music. “It has taken all the darkness and guilt of the world on itself. All its happiness is the knowledge of unhappiness; all its beauty is in denial of the semblance of the beautiful.”9 The theories of the postwar serialists, who often held university positions that insulated them from the need to write music that attracted a wide listenership, were challenged by John Cage’s exploration of audience engagement and indeter"
