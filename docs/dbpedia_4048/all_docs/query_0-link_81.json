You cook your steak just to your liking on a hot lava rock at your table. There are no photos, unfortunately, as I was expecting an ordinary motel meal here. The desserts are cooked on hot rocks too, I later discovered from the exceptionally friendly and helpful receptionist – so we missed out there I think.\n\nAll in all a great choice for an overnight stop to break the long journey to Kalbarri – hats off to the team there. There is quite a bit to do in Carnarvon too – we could easily have spent two nights here rather than one – and got to try those desserts. Hindsight – is a wonderful thing."
