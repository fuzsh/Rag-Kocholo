        "text": "Carnarvon is perfectly positioned between Shark Bay to the south and the Ningaloo World Heritage areas to the north. It’s the starting point for your next adventure but stay a while and discover this fascinating town’s historic, cultural and foodie highlights. About 5,000 people currently call Carnarvon home, and the population is a rich mix of heritages and cultures.\n\nSitting on the edge of the mighty Gascoyne River delta. Carnarvon is a tropical oasis in a parched landscape. Thanks to this unique geographical advantage, Carnarvon’s fertile plantations and farms supply the majority of Perth’s fruit and vegetables during the winter months. And yet, if you visit during the summer months, this mighty river is dry as a bone; its parched, wide riverbed leaving an echo of its true nature, owing only after the rains fall further inland. Known as an ephemeral river, the Gascoyne is the key to Carnarvon’s extraordinary place in WA’s agricultural story. Its proximity to the bountiful Indian Ocean also means that Carnarvon has a thriving prawn, scallop, crab and fishing industry so make sure you sample some local specialities in Carnarvon."
