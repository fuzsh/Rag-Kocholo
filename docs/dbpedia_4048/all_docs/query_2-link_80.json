For the luxury – Wallaroo Outback Retreat\n\nIf you’re keen on experiencing Carnarvon Gorge, minus the swag and hiking backpack, put your feet up at Wallaroo Outback Retreat.\n\nThis five-star retreat is nestled amongst 72,000 acres of outback landscape – with panoramic views of the Carnarvon Ranges so you feel connected to the sandstone beauty while you recline in a hammock and sip on a cuppa.\n\nIt’s a self-catered affair with classic and deluxe glamping tents, a fully equipped kitchen, activities hall, and amenities.\n\nSpend a day venturing out to the gorge, with an easy one hour drive north to the start of short walking tracks, meaning you can get back to your afternoon cuppa without rushing back through the bush.\n\nFind out more about the Retreat here.\n\n2. Close to the action – BIG4 Breeze Holiday Parks Carnarvon Gorge\n\nNo matter your preferred accommodation style, BIG4 Breeze Holiday Parks Carnarvon Gorge has got you covered (previously known as the Takarakka Bush Resort).\n\nFrom self-contained studios, cottages and cabins to glamping safari tents and standard caravanning and camping sites, you can map out your very own Carnarvon Gorge adventure.\n\nWith the Park being nestled in the Carnarvon National Park and set on 100 picturesque acres, you’re going to want to explore the scenery. Check out the gorge and rock pools by day, ease into the night with a drink at the Bush Bar, and unwind under the starry sky with a roasted marshmallow or two around the campfire.\n\nPlus… if you spend some time down at the resort’s Carnarvon Creek, you might be lucky to spot a platypus!\n\nFind out more about the Park here.\n\n3. For the view – Sandstone Park\n\nGet the best of both worlds with a stay at Sandstone Park, which offers 360 degree panoramic views of the gorge and easy access into the thick of it.\n\nThis one is for those who aren’t about adventuring 24/7 – nestled on the base of the national park, this camping and caravanning oasis lets you appreciate its beauty from afar while you take a rest from exploring.\n\nA quick five minute drive takes you from scenic views to self-guided adventure, however it you’d prefer not to go it alone, there are guided tours and even helicopter rides available from Sandstone Park.\n\nDon’t want to leave the pooch behind? Sandstone Park is pet-friendly, so all members of the family can enjoy the holiday.\n\nJust keep in mind that the Park usually closes from around October – March.\n\n4. For a resort – Carnarvon Gorge Wilderness Lodge\n\nIf camping in the middle of nowhere with nothing but a swag and canned food isn’t your cup of billy – then settle in at this resort-style accommodation.\n\nWith a swimming pool, licenced restaurant, discovery centre, and cabins – the Carnarvon Gorge Wilderness Lodge allows you to stay amongst the wilderness, without sacrificing creature comforts.\n\nJust a short 3km from the lodge is the starting point for most of the national park’s walks, which take off from the Park Headquarters.\n\nHere you can grab a map, learn about what flora and fauna you’ll encounter, and plan your route to the different lookouts, swimming spots, and gorge walks.\n\nKeen to explore the wider Carnarvon Gorge area?\n\nHead to cattle country [read – Roma]\n\nGet to know Biloela – starting with these fascinating facts\n\nVenture further west and explore Tambo – the teddy capital of Australia\n\nHave you been to Carnarvon Gorge?
