        "text": "At a Glance\n\nCarnarvon is also a renowned fishing spot and has great surrounding coastal scenery.\n\nWhere is Carnarvon?\n\nCarnarvon is 904 kilometres north of Perth.\n\nCarnarvon is situated in the northern and isolated area of Australia's Coral Coast tourist region. Carnarvon faces west to the Indian Ocean and the Gascoyne River flows through Carnarvon to the ocean. The town is surrounded by banana and other crop plantations. One of the best ways to get to Carnarvon is hiring a car from Perth Airport, or flying to Carnarvon airport.\n\nThings to see in Carnarvon\n\nBlow Holes\n\nLocated 70km out of town, the trip is definitely worth taking. Powerful ocean waves are forced through sea caves which project jets of water high up into the air to heights of up to 20 metres. A protected cove, surrounded by coral reef lies just one kilometre south of the Blow Holes.\n\nImage © Australia's Coral Coast\n\nGascoyne Food Trail\n\nAllow your taste buds to be treated to the exotic tropical delights served to visitors of the region, including fresh crayfish and succulent seafood, fine meat and the freshest fruit and veg you'll find in Australia & fresh fruit cocktails. Pick up a brochure at the Visitor Centre on your arrival in town.\n\nImage © Australia's Coral Coast\n\nWhat's the weather like?\n\nCarnarvon has a moderate, tropical climate. The weather in this part of the region makes the area ideal for growing many kinds of fruit and produce including mangoes and bananas. Most rainfall occurs in the monsoon season. In Summer (December to February), the average maximum temperature is 32°C with an average minimum temperature of 27°C. In Winter (June to August), the average maximum temperature is 22°C with an average minimum temperature of 12°C.\n\nTropical Cyclones are a prevalent part of this region between December and April. It is essential that you understand the steps and the procedures in place for Tropical Cyclones when entering this beautiful part of the world.\n\nGet to know Carnarvon's history\n\nThe town, named after Lord Carnarvon, the British Secretary of State (1866-74), was founded in 1883 and for most of its early life it served as a port and supply depot for the surrounding pastoral industry. Carnarvon became the centre of an efficient wool producing area. The wide main streets can be attributed to the early uses of camels as a means to transport goods. The economic nature of the town changed from the 1930's as it was discovered that the Gascoyne River was a great area for supporting crops such as avocados, coconuts, dates, mangoes, pawpaws, pineapples, melons and especially bananas.\n\nThe biggest event in recent history was the establishment of the NASA tracking station in 1964 and which played a major role in relaying messages for the Apollo Missions. On July 20, 1969 when (the late) Neil Armstrong stepped out of Apollo 11, his famous words \"That's one small step for man. One giant leap for mankind\" were relayed via the tracking station at Carnarvon.\n\nLooking for visitor and tourist information, maps and brochures, booking assistance and local expert tips in Carnarvon?
