        "text": "Carnarvon Gorge cuts its winding path through a sandstone plateau in the heart of the semi-arid brigalow country of central Queensland. Within its steep-sided walls lies a rich natural and cultural heritage. It is a land of remnant rainforest and a refuge for ancient ferns, where palms and eucalypts grow side by side, and a place where water has carved magical side-gorges. It is also a place that has long been sacred to the Bidjara and Karingbal people and contains several rock art sites that date back more than 3000 years. This was a place definitely worthy of a visit on our way south from the Whitsundays.\n\nIt was 11am by the time we drove from Emerald to Carnarvon Gorge, got our packs sorted out and headed off for the short walk from the carpark to the visitor centre at the mouth of the gorge. Nobody was there, so we took one of the free walking maps and headed off (we had booked the overnight campsite on-line). In reality, to walk Carnarvon Gorge is fairly simple - there is one main track that follows Carnarvon Creek up into the lush and thickly forested gorge and a number of well-signed side tracks that lead to some of the more spectacular and beautiful side gorges.\n\nThe Moss Garden lies in a side-gorge where water, percolating through the sandstone is blocked by impervious shale, forcing it to flow down the outside of the rock which creates an environment were mosses, liverworts and ferns carpet the surface of the shale. It was but a short climb up to the face of the gorge and into the cleft of the Moss Garden. Cool air flowing down gave a hint of what was ahead, as did the tall tree-ferns on the gorge floor.\n\nReturning to the main trail, we picked our packs up and followed the path along as it criss-crossed the creek, to the next junction - The Amphitheatre. Again we dropped our packs, recrossed the creek and made the short climb up to the sheer white sandstone of the gorge wall. Ahead, there first appeared to be a blank rock face, then a slight crack appeared in the wall. It was the entry to The Amphitheatre - when we climbed up the final set of steel steps up to enter the cleft, we were greeted by a flurry of tiny insectivorous bats and a flow of cold air pouring out of gap.\n\nOnce again different, once again magnificent - a small creek trickled out from the opening over red-stained rocks. We followed it up its narrow and lushly vegetated course wedged between rock walls to the end of the accessible area. The rest of the canyon is a preserve, for here, amongst tall and delicate tree ferns, grows the King fern, a relic of Gondwana and the largest living fern in the world. It was incredible to see the massive fronds spreading out on the shady floor of the canyon - fronds that once were the food of dinosaurs.\n\nThe creek crossings were no longer broad evenly placed paving stones, and a little more care was required in choosing where to put your feet. That said, we still moved quickly, sometimes along the open creek bank or along its stony bed, a section of sandy beach or grassy flat, or beneath the shade of fan palm, eucalypt or casuarina - all beneath the grey-streaked white walls of Carnarvon Gorge, as it gradually became narrower and narrower.\n\nIn this half of the trail, the main gorge itself was the star, and not just a road to the beauty spots in the side gorges.\n\nDeep within the gorge, the night had not been as cold as we anticipated and we had a snug sleep. That said, Big Bend campsite is a place that sees little sun light and it was a chilly start to the morning. We ate our breakfast under the watchful surveillance of a currawong, which helped itself to a beakful of our porridge the moment our backs were turned (beware the birds of Big Bend).\n\nThere was no hurry to head off, as essentially our plan for the day was to retrace our steps directly back to the trail head. We did have one side-trip planned, an exploration of the nearby Boowinda Gorge. On the way through last night, its narrow cleft of a mouth was completely in the shade, giving it an ominous air. This morning it was lit by the sun and much more inviting. We dropped our packs and hurried in.\n\nAll too soon we reached the last crossing of Carnarvon Creek, so instead of taking it, we followed the east bank on the so called Nature Trail, hoping to see traces of platypus, as the information brochure suggested. The scenery was worth the detour, but alas, no platypi. We crossed a bit further downstream to reach the carpark and our car.\n\nWe both felt elated - Carnarvon Gorge had exceeded our expectations and the trip into Big Bend must surely rank as one of the best overnighters we have done.\n\nOur visit to Carnarvon Gorge was not quite over - the gorge is an isolated place and it was too late to be heading off anywhere else. Instead we drove 4km down the track and checked into Takarakka, a well-appointed camping ground favoured by grey nomads, set in pleasant surrounds on a bend of the Carnarvon Creek. We had reserved a safari tent, which gave us shelter and a comfortable bed for the evening, as well as a chance to feast on the Thursday night camp roast.\n\nWe wandered down to the tree-lined bank and sat quietly on the water's edge as the last rays of sun light reflected in its still surface. On the far bank, across from us, the vegetation hung low over the edge hiding the entrance to the platypus burrow ... we waited in the stillness of the evening.\n\nSuddenly, a streak of silvery ripples moved quickly and smoothly from the bank, to disappear in a thick patch of waterweed nearby. We waited again ... the weedy water rippled, the faint shape of a duckbilled head appeared on the surface, eyes watching. With a splash it was gone, to emerge again beneath the near bank, its presence betrayed by concentric silver ripple rings as it dabbled for food. Gone again, to reappear near a half-submerged log and then, foraging completed, streaking back like a silvery arrow to its burrow."
