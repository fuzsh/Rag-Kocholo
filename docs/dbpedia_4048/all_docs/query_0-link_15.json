        "text": "Carnarvon WA is a place that few people will ever end up visiting. This small ‘city’ is home to just 5000 people at the best of times and it’s located on the remote, north-west coast of Western Australia.\n\nIt’s a long way from anywhere, which is one of the reasons that few people ever visit. On the surface, there also doesn’t seem to be a lot of things to in Carnarvon. That’s the second reason not so many people ever visit.\n\nAt best, you might cruise on through and stop for supplies on a road trip further north.\n\nI’m here to tell you that actually though, there’s a lot more to Carnarvon than you might realise.\n\nThe city has a fascinating history that’s matched by few other places in WA and has even played an important role in space travel.\n\nThere’s an authentic local feel to Carnarvon that’s lost in many of the more touristy areas along the coast, and there are some epic natural attractions waiting for you that few people know even exist.\n\nMake sure you stop in Carnarvon for more than supplies, hang around to explore the coast and if you can, drive inland to experience the start of the Outback.\n\nHere’s my guide to Carnarvon, Western Australia.\n\nA Brief History of Carnarvon\n\nCarnarvon is a relatively young city, even in Australian terms. European settlement of the area only really began in 1883 when Carnarvon was officially established, however, since 1876 there had been farmers in the area working on pastoral leases in the wide open country.\n\nThe site that became Carnarvon was seen as a great location to set up a small port that could then give those farmers in the region access to the sea to trade their produce up and down the coast, or to send all the way south to Perth.\n\nSince then, Carnarvon has slowly grown into the largest ‘city’ in the north-west, although in such a sparsely populated area, it’s hardly a city by anything other than remote WA standards.\n\nThe Ingarrda People of Carnarvon\n\nBefore the Europeans arrived in the region, the area where Carnarvon WA is found and inland towards the small town of Gascoyne Junction was the home of the Ingarrda people.\n\nThey are still the traditional owners of the land and although they suffered greatly because of European expansion their culture has seen somewhat of a resurgence in recent decades.\n\nThe wider term for people from the north-west is Yamatji. Unfortunately in the city itself though, there is little left of this culture and even the local Aboriginal arts centre is now just a derelict building standing on the highway on the edge of town, an unfortunately common occurrence in locations across the state.\n\nEuropean Exploration of the Coast\n\nThe first Europeans to settle the area were generally from the British colonies to the south, however, the first expedition to explore the coastline is thought to be Dirk Hartog’s.\n\nHe was a Dutchman who made landfall to the south of Carnarvon, on what is now known as Dirk Hartog Island and he would have sailed past the site where the city is now built on his journey along the western shore of Australia.\n\nHe didn’t hang around for long though – just long enough to leave behind a plaque and an inscription – before carrying on again.\n\nOther European ships would be lost and wrecked along the coast, as several early explorers began to chart the dangerous currents, reefs and islands that line WA.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1826 that the first permanent European colony of Albany was established in Western Australia, far to the south, before in 1829 the Swan River Colony was proclaimed. This was to grow into the city of Perth.\n\nIn 1839, an English explorer by the name of Lieutenant Grey landed by the Gascoyne River, naming it for his friend, a Captain Gascoyne. Lieutenant Grey travelled inland, and his positive reports of the climate and land for agricultural purposes would lead to expansion north in the next few decades by settlers from Perth, with the first settlers arriving in the region in 1876 to begin grazing sheep.\n\nThe Earl of Carnarvon\n\nCarnarvon is named for Mr Henry Herbert, who while not only being titled the 4th Earl of Carnarvon, also held the important post of Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1866-67 and then again between 1874-78.\n\nHis influence at the time of founding across the emerging colonies of Britain, was profound enough for the new settlers to name their town Carnarvon, even after he gave up his wider colonial duties.\n\nBananas in Carnarvon\n\nAlthough Carnarvon and the wider region was settled to produce and export wool, this was never achieved on the scale it was hoped for. The land was not as suited to grazing as it was thought and soon the pastoral stations were irrevocably changing the landscape through overgrazing.\n\nToday though, Carnarvon is not known for its wool exports, but for its fruit and vegetable production. This is the ‘Food Bowl’ of Western Australia when it comes to many of the staple agricultural products that have entered into the average Australian’s diet, and it’s estimated that up to 70 percent of all fruit and veg in WA is produced in Carnarvon.\n\nAlongside avocados, eggplant, melons and much more, Carnarvon has become famous for its bananas. If you walk into a supermarket anywhere in the state, chances are the bananas will be from Carnarvon.\n\nThis focus on food production began in the 1930’s when the first banans plants were cultivated on the banks of the Gascoyne River. They flourished, and since then, agriculture has become the main focus of the city, and it’s all contained within a short radius of the city centre itself.\n\nWhen you are in Carnarvon WA, make sure you try some fresh fruit and veg and head to the Carnarvon Visitors Centre or to a local bakery to try some of the city’s fabled Banana Bread, you won’t be disappointed.\n\nSpace Travel, NASA and Carnarvon\n\nWhen you first near the city, the first thing you will inevitably see is the huge satellite dish that’s located on a hill on the edge of Carnarvon Western Australia. This is the OTC Dish, which is now part of the Carnarvon Space and Technology Museum but which from 1964 until 1976 played a huge role in the manned landings on the moon.\n\nThis is Carnarvon’s biggest claim to fame, but it’s a unique side of Western Australia’s history that few people know much about.\n\nThe station tracked satellites and the Apollo missions, being ideally suited to pick up their signals across the Pacific regions. In 1969, when Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon, the Carnarvon Satellite was the first to relay his message across the world to NASA in Florida.\n\nCarnarvon as a Tourist Destination\n\nAlthough the days of space travel tracking are over for Carnarvon, the city has the potential to be a much bigger tourist destination than it is, or at least, the surrounding coastline and inland areas of exceptional beauty are.\n\nBeing situated along the Northwest Coastal Highway, Carnarvon is already a popular stop off point for road trippers travelling further north from the south (or vice versa of course).\n\nThere are several caravan parks and a few backpacker hostels – many working holiday visa holders will travel here in search of farm work – but for the most part, people will call in, resupply at the supermarket and petrol stations and move on.\n\nEven the epic national parks to the east are barely visited at all, mostly due to their isolated locations. For anyone looking for a quiet area of WA to explore, the nearby Kenndy Ranges, Mount Augustus and the Ningaloo coastline offer exceptional scenery that is still mostly unknown to tourists.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Carnarvon evolves as a tourist destination, but while the city’s main focus remains its agricultural production, this will be unlikely. That does mean it will likely remain an authentic city to visit. Although, how a place of fewer than 5000 people can be termed a ‘city’, I will never understand. Only in WA.\n\nThe Best Time of Year to Visit Carnarvon\n\nBeing located far north, Carnarvon can experience some extreme tropical weather. The best time of year to visit is during the dry season, which coincides with winter when temperatures are mild – although still sunny and warm – and rain is practically non-existent. The dry season falls between April and November and this is the perfect time to travel in the north of Western Australia.\n\nDuring summer, temperatures can be extreme and the humidity suffocating. Tropical monsoons are frequent and cyclones can ravage the coast. Dangerously, the flat plains to the east are susceptible to flash flooding during the rainy season – which runs from December through to March – and as recently as 2010 the entire community of Gascoyne Junction was washed away in heavy flooding. Plan carefully if travelling during summer as roads can be washed away and many of the remote national parks and communities become cut off.\n\nHow to Travel to Carnarvon\n\nThe best way to travel to Carnarvon is to combine a visit to the region with a journey along the north-west coastal road. It makes for a great stop on a Perth to Broome itinerary, and after Carnarvon, you can carry on up the road to Coral Bay, Exmouth, Karijini National Park and eventually to Broome or even Darwin. Journey time from Perth is at last 9 hours, with a distance of 900 kilometres to cover.\n\nFor more inspiration then you can read my detailed Perth to Broome itinerary which maps out the best stops along the long road to the north of Western Australia.\n\nIf you don’t have your own vehicle, then Integrity Coach Lines have a bus service from Perth to Broome that calls in at Carnarvon as well as many other popular stops along the northwest coastline. They have a Hop on Hop off Pass that allows you to take your time while travelling through the state, although once you are in each destination, due to lack of public transport you will be very restricted as to where you can actually go.\n\nCarnavon also has a small domestic airport and if you would rather fly in and fly out, then there are regularly scheduled flights to Perth with the airline REX.\n\nThings to do in Carnarvon\n\nHere are the best things to do in Carnarvon, from Space Museums to incredible Blow Holes and a whole load of Bananas in between.\n\nCarnarvon Harbour\n\nThe city sprawls out from the local harbour, where you can see small boats calling into port and can enjoy the sight of the many islands across the water.\n\nThere are some great green spaces and parks that stretch along the edge of the esplanade that runs along the edge of the ocean, and there are BBQs, benches and seating areas to relax at.\n\nYou can also find some great restaurants and cafes, and at sunset, this is a beautiful place to be.\n\nCarnarvon Space and Technology Museum\n\nThe Carnarvon Space and Technology Museum is a great place to learn more about the unique history of the city.\n\nThis is where satellites were tracked and messages to NASA were relayed during the 60’s and 70’s and today, it’s an informative and intriguing museum that will certainly leave you enthralled.\n\nIt’s found on the edge of the city, just aim for the giant OTC satellite dish.\n\nThe Heritage Precinct of Carnarvon\n\nTo experience more of the earlier history of the city – well, only as early as the 1880’s – then visit Carnarvon’s Heritage Precinct.\n\nFound on Babbage Island to the west of the city centre, you can visit a number of local attractions of historical importance that will give you an insight into the European settlement of the region.\n\nThere’s the old lighthouse, the Sheep Shearing Hall of Fame and a Railway Museum that explores the history of the tramway.\n\nOne Mile Jetty\n\nOne Mile Jetty is found in the Heritage Precinct and extends for a mile over the water from the end of Babbage Island.\n\nThis is the longest jetty in the northwest – although that’s not really a huge achievement – and it dates back to the late 1890’s when it was constructed to facilitate the loading of wool onto ships offshore.\n\nIt’s all wooden and it’s a glorious piece of local history.\n\nThe Old Carnarvon Tramway\n\nThe tramway used to link the city centre to One Mile Jetty to allow goods to be easily transported to the coast for shipment, but it fell into disuse and is now more a heritage trail.\n\nYou can follow the 3 kilometres of tramline from Carnarvon out to Babbage Island, which makes for a great little hike.\n\nBanana Plantations and Local Farms\n\nAround the city centre and along the steep banks of the Gascoyne River you can find a whole load of Banana Plantations and local farms, many of which have small farm shops and even cafes.\n\nYou will find plenty of fresh produce for sale, many of it seconds that were misshapen and couldn’t be sold to the supermarkets, but all of which is straight from the fields.\n\nMany of the farms produce a wide range of products too, from the famous Carnarvon Banana Bread to fresh mangoes and delicious chutneys. The local Bumbak’s farm even sells wonderful flavoured ice cream that’s made with local fruits. Tourists have taken to calling the route around the farms, ‘The Fruit Loop’, as it’s starting to become a favourite amongst the few tourists that visit the city.\n\nQuobba Blowholes\n\nAlong the coast, to the north of Carnarvon, can be found the Quobba Blowholes. This is a spectacular natural sight to see, as the raging coastline here is windswept, rugged and brutal and the weather-beaten rocks have been shaped into huge blowholes.\n\nWhen the waves – known as King Waves, for their extraordinary size – smash into the rocks, they throw up spray hundreds of metres into the air. Don’t get too close though, because it’s been known for unlucky souls to be swept out to sea, so unpredictable and powerful are the waves here.\n\nThe Ningaloo Coast\n\nThe Ningaloo Reef is the largest fringing reef in the world – yes, even bigger, and a lot less well known, than the Great Barrier Reef. It’s thousands of miles long and stretches from Exmouth in the north, right down to the south to Carnarvon.\n\nMost visitors will visit the reef from the towns of Coral Bay or Exmouth, however, if you have a four wheel drive then you can explore the Ningaloo Coast which starts just north of the Quobba Blowholes.\n\nThe roads are dirt tracks, where there are roads at all, and there are some secluded, isolated and remote beaches and camping spots to explore. It’s a favourite for surfers, because of the huge waves, while some of the calmer bays can be snorkelled.\n\nTop spots to head for are the Quobba Station, Red Bluff, and Gnarlaroo where you can even camp overnight.\n\nChinamans Pool\n\nChinamans Pool is a small nature reserve on the banks of the Gascoyne River. It’s just north of the city, but is certainly within walking distance, making this a popular place for locals to relax and chill out when the hot weather is out in force.\n\nIt’s a secluded spot, that takes you far away from Carnarvon and into nature and it’s great for swimming.\n\nRocky Pool\n\nAnother great swimming spot in the region is Rocky Pool. Found out of the city, and on the way to Gascoyne Junction to the west, this is a great day out in the wild nature of WA.\n\nThis is a freshwater pool, surrounded by beautiful scenery and greenery. Bring your swimming gear and spend the day relaxing out in the middle of nowhere.\n\nGascoyne Junction\n\nGascoyne Junction is found three hours to the west of Carnarvon, and it’s really the next town down the road, at least inland. This is a peculiar little place and it’s a chance to see a real remote community because there isn’t anything here for miles around.\n\nThere’s not much to do, although you can call into the library which also acts as a visitors centre for a little bit of local history, while the caravan park makes for a good overnight stop if you heading into the Outback. You won’t stay here long, but it’s a good breakpoint on the road to the Kennedy Ranges and to Mount Augustus.\n\nKennedy Range National Park\n\nThe Kennedy Range National Park is a hugely under-appreciated and under-visited national park close to Gascoyne Junction. This is really where the outback begins, and from Gascoyne Junction, a dirt road leads to this area of natural beauty.\n\nIt’s a small range of mountains that in the otherwise flat landscapes come as a complete shock to the sense when you first lay eyes on them.\n\nThis unique part of the land is full of wildlife and some of the region’s only year-round watering holes ensuring it attracts what little wildlife is adapted to these harsh deserts.\n\nThere’s a small camping ground here but no facilities aside from a drop toilet and an open fire pit. Come prepared with water and food, as you will need to camp out to really appreciate the range.\n\nThere are some great hikes through the gorges and to top of the ridgeline and you will most likely find that you are the only person around.\n\nMount Augustus National Park\n\nMount Augustus National Park is even more remote than the Kennedy Ranges, but it’s worth the excruciatingly long journey through the wilderness to see what is the world’s largest rock.\n\nYes, Mount Augustus is bigger even than Uluru, although it’s hardly known at all, even within Australia.\n\nIt will take you two days to drive the almost 500 kilometres from Carnarvon to Mount Augustus – but Carnarvon is the closest city! – and you will need to be prepared with water, fuel and food, although you can do this in a two-wheel drive, as I did.\n\nThe roads are rocky and there’s almost nothing at all to see along the way. At Mount Augustus, there’s a Caravan Park that’s also a working cattle station where you can stay and resupply your fuel and water. There’s even a bar.\n\nThis is truly remote and it’s an extraordinary place to experience. You can hike to the summit of Mount Augustus itself, a journey of around 5 or 6 hours return depending on your fitness. It’s well worth the effort for the expansive views that reach for miles and miles over the flat landscape but remember to start early and to take plenty of water to avoid the heat.\n\nAccommodation and Camping in Carnarvon\n\nFor such a small city, there is a surprising quantity of accommodation in Carnarvon. This is mostly due to the fact that this is a very popular stop off point along the Northwest Coastal Highway. Most of the accommodation though is found at basic caravan parks in the city, while there are also a few backpackers catering to longer-term travellers looking to work on the farms.\n\nWild camping is technically illegal anywhere in the Shire of Carnarvon and it’s not uncommon for the Rangers to strictly enforce fines on anyone found sleeping in their cars or setting up camp at some of the popular outdoor attractions. If you are looking for campsites, then along the Ningaloo coast there are several, while Kennedy Ranges and Mount Augustus also have them.\n\nTravelling to Carnarvon?
