        "text": "A remote coastal community in north-west Australia has celebrated 60 years since NASA opened a tracking station on its outskirts, bringing together former staff to commemorate their pivotal role in putting a man on the Moon.\n\nCelebrations were held over the weekend at the Carnarvon Space and Technology Museum, which houses some of the station's equipment and other exhibits in the shadow of a 29-metre-wide Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC) dish.\n\nThe landmark, rising high above the town's banana plantations, was commissioned five years after the tracking station opened in 1964.\n\nStrategically placed across the planet from NASA's Cape Canaveral launch pad, the site was then the largest tracking station built outside the mainland US.\n\nIt served as a state-of-the-art communication link for the Gemini, Apollo and Skylab missions before NASA wound down operations in 1975.\n\nJohn Harmsen, 84, one of the station's longest-serving digital technicians, joined some of his fellow \"trackers\" to speak at the event.\n\nHe told the ABC the reunion was \"bittersweet\".\n\n\"I look as young as when I worked here but I look at other people and go, 'My god, that person is so old,'\" Mr Harmsen said.\n\nA fateful holiday\n\nThe events that led Mr Harmsen and his wife Lynn to Carnarvon are typical of the casualness that belies many of the trackers' career beginnings.\n\nA failed work transfer to the Pilbara outpost of Mundiwindi saw the young couple take a holiday to get over their disappointment.\n\nMr Harmsen called into the newly established tracking station on a whim to visit an old colleague.\n\n\"I left there an hour later with a job over double my salary, a brand new home in town, free transport to and from the site, with a guaranteed three-year contract,\" he said.\n\nHe was 24 years old at the time.\n\nThree years later, he would be closely scanning scrolls of telemetry data in the station's main computer room as Neil Armstrong and his crew left orbit.\n\n\"We were actually manning consoles and part of the mission,\" he said.\n\nTo this day, he describes Apollo 11 as \"a backstop in my whole life\".\n\nWhile her husband was flown to the Goddard Space Flight Centre in Maryland to retrain, Lynn Harmsen set about making a home with their firstborn child.\n\n\"All the ladies got together â€¦ we all congregated in one of the houses, and that way the kids could let go and enjoy themselves,\" she said.\n\nHundreds of men and women were employed by the Carnarvon tracking station.\n\nIt gave the quiet town of about 2,000 people a vibrant social life of mirror-ball dances and fishing trips between lengthy shifts at the station.\n\nEnd of an era\n\nTV repairman turned tracker Tito Teraci, 85, said while the success of Apollo 11 looms large, the \"almost catastrophe\" of Apollo 13 was particularly harrowing.\n\n\"Carnarvon was the one that, when they came back into Earth's orbit, we latched onto them, and we tracked them for nearly 12 hours,\" he said.\n\n\"We talked to them. We kept them going because they were freezing, the poor buggers.\"\n\nWhen the final manned mission to the Moon came along, the trackers were \"devastated\".\n\n\"[Apollo 17] was a very significant moment for us,\" Mr Teraci said.\n\n\"We knew that was going to be the end of the actual trackers tracking. There was going to be no more lunar landers.\"\n\nMr Teraci met the last man to walk on the lunar surface, Eugene Cernan, years later.\n\n\"He was the one that came to me and tapped me on the shoulder and told me that, you know, if it hadn't been for Carnarvon, America would never have got to the Moon.\"\n\nRecognising a mission accomplished\n\nCarnarvon's 60th anniversary celebration included international recognition for the trackers, with NASA sending a message of thanks.\n\nLoading...\n\nActing Consul General of the US Consulate in Perth, Somer Bessire-Briers, said she was initially surprised to hear about the remote town's special place in the history of space exploration.\n\n\"It speaks to ingenuity of the people there in Carnarvon,\" she said.\n\nFor Mr Teraci, the milestone has taken on deeper meaning.\n\n\"But while we can still do it, and while we can keep this party going, I'll be there.\""
