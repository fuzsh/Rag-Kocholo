        "text": "A successful partnership with Carnarvon Community College\n\nIn March 2024 Girls from Oz concluded its Community Program in Carnarvon.\n\nFollowing the successful delivery of our Carnarvon pilot program in 2012 Girls from Oz have been a welcomed and respected presence in the Carnarvon community where we consistently and reliably delivered four week-long programs to Carnarvon Community College, one per school term, across thirteen years.\n\nA typical week in Carnarvon saw us undertake a minimum of 24 hours of program delivery with girls and young women aged 8 to 18. Embedded into the students’ school schedule, g-oz program attendance was mandatory for those in Years 3 – 10 and optional for those in Year 11 and 12.\n\nSince 2012 44 g-oz Community Programs were successfully delivered in collaboration with Carnarvon Community College.\n\n‘I like singing because it’s my way of asking people to listen to what I have to say…express my emotions. My favourite part from g-oz was everything! The way the four [instructors] inspire everyone to get up and have a go. g-oz has helped me be more confident…before Girls from Oz I felt embarrassed and shy about dancing, now I feel like I can do that in front of people and do so much more without feeling so shy.’ – Chantele, Carnarvon Community College student, 2014.\n\nGirls from Oz would like to thank both Carnarvon Community College and the wider Carnarvon community for inviting g-oz into the community and welcoming us back each year to deliver high-quality performing arts education, initiatives and local community performances.\n\n‘The g-oz program has played a major role in the reengagement of our girls by providing a valuable structured program involving dance and singing. Opportunities like this are not provided elsewhere in the Mid-West Region. The g-oz program has provided opportunities for young Aboriginal women to acquire the knowledge, skills and confidence required to embark on adulthood with positivity and feelings of connectedness to the wider Australian community.’ – Michael Henderson, Carnarvon Community College Principal, 2015.\n\nWe would also like to extend our gratitude to our Carnarvon Community Partner Shooting Stars, the school-based engagement initiative of Netball WA; and the MidWest Education Region Office for their initial invitation in 2012, asking us to pilot a g-oz program at the then newly amalgamated Carnarvon Community College after seeing the successful delivery of our Halls Creek Community Program at La Grange Remote Community School.\n\nGirls from Oz wishes the Carnarvon g-oz alumni all the best in their future endeavours. Stand tall, sing loud and shine bright!\n\nWhere the desert meets the sea\n\nThe traditional owners of Gwoonwardu (Carnarvon), meaning ‘neck of water’, are the Yinggarda people.\n\nThis coastal town is part of Western Australia’s Gascoyne region, lying at the mouth of the Gascoyne River on the Indian Ocean, and located 900km north of Perth. Carnarvon is predominantly a fishing and agricultural region, particularly known for its banana and mango plantations. As of 2024 Carnarvon’s population is approximately 5000."
