        "text": "Welcome to our Australia Family Road Trip series! After visiting Lancelin, Jurien Bay, Kalbarri, Geraldton, and a couple of outback station stays, we continued north to Carnarvon. Situated between Shark Bay and the Ningaloo World Heritage area, Carnarvon was a great place to spend a couple of days and break up our drives both heading north and then back south.\n\nWe had heard mixed reviews about Carnarvon from other travelers we encountered, but we were looking forward to visiting the farms for fresh produce and sampling the local seafood. Carnarvon is known as “the food bowl of WA” because it supplies so much produce and seafood to the region. We weren’t disappointed! The town had a tropical feel, the produce and treats were oh-so-yummy, and the Carnarvon foreshore provided a quiet place to grab a coffee, let the kids loose on the playground, and walk the wooden jetty. Here’s what we got up to in Carnarvon!\n\nTop Tip: If you’re visiting Carnarvon May – October, be sure to visit the Gascoyne Growers’ Markets held every Saturday in the town center. Hosted by the growers, it’s your best bet for a plethora of farm-fresh goodies all in one place. We were so disappointed to miss it— we visited in July and August, but we didn’t know to plan our stay over a Saturday!\n\nA short loop drive that includes parts of South River Road, North River Road, and crossing the (dry) Gascoyne River twice, the Fruit Loop Drive Trail was a fun family morning. We found several roadside honesty stands offering a range of produce. You simply select what you want and drop your money in the box. Bring exact change! We scored tomatoes, cucumbers, red peppers, green peppers, bananas, a purple cabbage, a grapefruit, and frozen mango! The kids liked exploring the farm stands and marveling at the banana and mango trees.\n\nWe stayed at Wintersun Caravan Park just a few miles from the town center. It was packed! On our northbound stay, we enjoyed a self-contained, one-bedroom cabin. On our southbound stay, we camped!\n\nThe clean, well-maintained caravan park offers a farm stand at the registration office, a bouncy pillow and playground, a pool, weekly events like the Sunday Pancake Breakfast and Friday Pie Day, live music on the weekends, craft gatherings, and even line dancing! We met several guests who stay at Wintersun every year for its immaculate grounds and robust social calendar. Our family certainly enjoyed our stay!"
