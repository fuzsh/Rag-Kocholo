        "text": "Places to Visit\n\nCarnarvon Gorge\n\nHidden in the rugged ranges of Queensland's central highlands, Carnarvon Gorge features towering sandstone cliffs, vibrantly coloured side gorges, diverse flora and fauna and Aboriginal rock art.\n\nDrive west to Rolleston, and a further 61km to the Carnarvon turnoff.\n\nCarnarvon Gorge is an oasis in the semi-arid heart of Central Queensland. Here, towering white sandstone cliffs form a spectacular steep-sided gorge with narrow, vibrantly-coloured and lush side-gorges. Boulder-strewn Carnarvon Creek winds through the gorge.\n\nA wealth of cultural and natural heritage lies within this special place.\n\nThe gorge is home to a range of significant plant and animal species, many of them relics of cooler, wetter times. Remnant rainforest flourishes in the sheltered side-gorges while endemic Carnarvon fan palms Livistona nitida, ancient cycads, ferns, flowering shrubs and gum trees line the main gorge. Grassy open forest grows on the cliff tops. T\n\nhe park's creeks attract a wide variety of animals including more than 173 species of birds.\n\nRock art on sandstone overhangs is a fragile reminder of Aboriginal people's long and continuing connection with the gorge.\n\nOchre stencils, rock engravings and freehand paintings include some of the finest Aboriginal rock imagery in Australia."
