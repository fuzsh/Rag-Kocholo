        "text": "Gascoyne River, ephemeral river of west-central Western Australia. It rises in the northeastern Robinson Ranges west of the Gibson Desert, flows generally westward for 475 miles (760 km) through gold-mining and sheep-raising country, and empties into the Indian Ocean at Carnarvon on Shark Bay. It is joined by the 225-mile- (360-kilometre-) long Lyons River about 100 miles (160 km) above its mouth. Although frequently dry, it is the chief source of water for Carnarvon. Bananas and vegetables are grown along its lower course on land irrigated from wells dug in the riverbed. The wool-producing region along its upper course is known as the Gascoyne. The river was first sighted in 1839 by Captain (later Sir) George Grey, who became governor of South Australia (1841â€“45), and was named for his friend, one Captain Gascoyne of the Royal Navy."
