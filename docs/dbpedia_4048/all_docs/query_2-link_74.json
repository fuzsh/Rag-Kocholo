        "text": "Carnarvon Gorge\n\nOver millions of years, water has eroded a deep and dramatic gorge system within the layers of soft, white sandstone – creating majestic cliffs that change colour with the movement of the sun. Carnarvon Creek flows all year, giving life to a luxuriant growth of ferns, palms, shrubs and trees.\n\nWalking\n\nFrom the Carnarvon Visitor Information Centre, you can fit the top four attractions (Moss Garden, Amphitheatre, Art Gallery and Ward’s Canyon) into a (mostly!) leisurely four-hour roundtrip.\n\nMickey Creek Gorge track is another popular walk because it’s relatively easy and quick (3km return) but also stunning, especially when it branches off to Warrumbah Bluff. Start from the Mickey Creek carpark, which is a 4km drive from the national park entrance.\n\nIf you want to Explore More of the national park, we recommend setting aside at least three days to walk the tracks, explore the side gorges and visit Aboriginal cultural sites. Make sure you’re well-prepared with hiking gear and food and drink essentials to complete this amazing journey.\n\nCheck out the Carnarvon Gorge Discovery Guide for more details\n\nRock Art on sandstone overhangs are a fragile reminder of Aboriginal people’s long and continuing connection with the gorge. These ochre stencils, rock engravings and freehand paintings are some of the finest Aboriginal rock imagery in Australia. The best place to find this is the Art Gallery, where more than two thousand engravings, ochre stencils and freehand paintings adorn the 62-metre-long sandstone walls of this significant Aboriginal site.\n\nWildlife There are loads of opportunities for birdwatching! More than 170 bird species inhabit or visit the park. A night walk with a torch can reveal gliders, possums and bush stonecurlews. Catch a glimpse of platypus, possums and other creek life on an early morning stroll along the one kilometre Nature Trail.\n\nRewan Memorial On your way into Carnarvon Gorge, visit the Rewan Memorial, erected to honour the lives of the Australian and US soldiers who were aboard a Dakota C-47 aircraft that broke up in a violent storm in 1943. Explore More of its story here.\n\nSwimming Take a refreshing dip in the Rock Pool, carved from the bed of Carnarvon Creek by the turbulent waters of past floods. It is the only place designated for swimming.\n\nFacilities At the entrance to Carnarvon Gorge, a large, grassy picnic area is set amongst towering eucalypts and cabbage palms. Wheelchair accessible toilets and tables, gas barbecues and drinking water are available.\n\nCamping at the gorge is only available during Easter, June-July and September-October school holidays. Camping permits are essential and bookings must be made in advance at the Visitor Information Centre in Emerald or online with Queensland National Parks. Privately-run accommodation is available nearby year round – find more information here.\n\nGuided Tours and Talks Enhance your Carnarvon Gorge adventure with a guided tour by one of the commercial operators.\n\nOther popular sites\n\nOther Top Spots to Explore Carnarvon National Park has three other sections. Take a four-wheel-drive adventure to Salvator Rosa, Ka Ka Mundi (accessed via Springsure) and Mount Moffatt (accessed via Injune).\n\nSalvator Rosa Rocky sandstone crags and spires dominate the skyline. Enjoy crystal clear springs and colourful wildflower displays. Camp under the timeless night sky next to the Nogoa River.\n\nKa Ka Mundi Drive though the undulating sandstone country and discover stately bottle trees emerging from silver brigalow forest. Camp by the springs and watch abundant birdlife.\n\nMount Moffatt Enjoy spectacular views from the Consuelo Tableland, the highest plateau in Queensland.\n\nEssentials…\n\nVisitor Information Get Directions Get Weather Report CQH Visitor Guide + Touring Map Sandstone Wilderness Guide Carnarvon Gorge Discovery Guide\n\nExplore More…"
