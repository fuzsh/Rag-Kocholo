Warm sunny days, cool nights and friendly lay back people.\n\nFertile loamy soils and underground water support an extensive horticultural industry in Carnarvon.\n\nThe subtropical climate which promotes the growth of bananas, mangoes, tomatoes etc., is also loved by flowering plants.\n\nWe managed to land this Long Tom at Massey Bay.\n\nMiaboolya Beach, about sixteen kilometres from Carnarvon is a favourite place for sunset photography, fishing and enjoying nature."
