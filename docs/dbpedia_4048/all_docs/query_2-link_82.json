        "text": "SNACKS | Unfortunately, due to current COVID safety concerns, we are unable to provide home baked snacks for morning and afternoon tea.\n\nHOT CUPPA | Nothing beats a freshly pressed coffee, or a nice cup of tea when the energy levels start to dip. We promise we’ll choose a beautiful spot to enjoy it, too! Unfortunately, due to current COVID safety concerns, we can only boil the billy for you. Please BYO cup, tea bag etc to ensure a contactless process.\n\nCOMPANY | One of the benefits of spending the whole day together, is that we have plenty of time to chat. Make sure you spend some time walking up front with us. We’d love to get to know you, and answer any questions that some to mind as we wander along\n\nWATER | Approximately 2 litres per person. It may sound like a lot, but we’ll be active in the Gorge for approximately 9 hours, and there are no opportunities to pick up water along the way. You can always start to discard water along the way, when you realise you won’t finish it.\n\nLUNCH | Unfortunately, due to our remote location, and inability to guarantee fresh supplies at short notice, we are unable to provide lunch and snacks on our full day tours. So, please pack something tasty and nutritious to ensure you’re fueled up for the rest of the day.\n\nCAMERA | You’ll be kicking yourself if you forget this important piece of equipment! Ensure batteries are fully charged, SD cards have plenty of space, and that both are actually in the camera!\n\nSUN PROTECTION | Sunscreen, hat, and sunglasses. Light weight long sleeve shirts and long pants are great protection options too.\n\nAPPROPRIATE CLOTHING | Be sure to check the forecast close to your arrival. If there’s a chance of rain, pack a rain coat. In winter our days can start at 5 C, so wear lots of layers and peel them off the day warms up.\n\nFOOTWEAR | Please wear the best closed walking shoes you have. Boots with ankle support are best, especially for the Off The Beaten Track tour.\n\nBACKPACK | You’re going to need somewhere to store your lunch, water and layers. Make sure it’s going to be comfortable to carry for a full day walk.\n\nHIKING POLES | These are entirely optional, but can be of great benefit at the many stepping-stone creek crossings. Especially, if you are concerned about your balance.\n\nPROOF OF COVID-19 VACCINATION | Being a tourism experience, we are required to see proof of each patron’s COVID-19 digital vaccination certificate, immunisation history statement, international COVID-19 vaccination certificate, or approved medical exemption prior to tour commencement.\n\nFACE MASK | Please ensure you always have a face mask with you, as mask mandates are subject to change.\n\nWhilst you are not required to constantly wear a face mask in outdoor settings, there may be times where physical distancing won’t be possible.\n\nThis is our classic full day walk covering 14 km over the course of 8-9 hours. However, we allow plenty of time to stop and chat about the natural and cultural history of Carnarvon Gorge along the way. We’re certainly not in any great rush.\n\nThe main walking track is one way in, one way out, and we choose to walk to the furthest destination first. This allows us to knock off the single biggest chunk of walking whilst we are fresh, and break up the return walk into smaller chunks as we visit the remaining sites on the way back.\n\nThe first and last 3 km takes us over a series of three small ridges, meaning there are stairs and hills in both directions. The track then flattens out as it follows Carnarvon Creek.\n\nThere are 16 creek crossings via stepping stones throughout the day, so good balance is essential. If you’re concerned, consider purchasing a set of hiking poles prior to your visit.\n\nThe four major sites, Art Gallery, Ward’s Canyon, Amphitheatre, & Moss Garden are all accessed via staircases that deviate from the main walking track. Considering each of these major sites require a one way in, one way out detour from the main track, you may choose to sit one or two out. The choice is entirely up to you.\n\nFor some of you, this may have helped to make your decision. If it hasn’t, and you still have concerns or queries, please give us a call, and we’ll do our best to help.\n\nOnly you can make that decision, but here are a few things for you to consider:\n\nYOUR INTERESTS | Do you want to leave the Gorge with a wealth of knowledge, or would you prefer to step out on your own and explore at a faster pace? Do you want to escape the crowds, or stick to the main track? Do you have a specific interest in flora, fauna or geology, or are you happy to go with the flow?\n\nYOUR FITNESS & BALANCE | The Lower Gorge Explorer covers 14 km and includes 16 creek crossings via stepping stones. Off The Beaten Track covers upwards of 15 km, mostly off track, with countless creek crossings, and lots of rock-hopping.\n\nWith that in mind, here are our top suggestions:\n\nGENERAL KNOWLEDGE | Lower Gorge Explorer Tour\n\nWILDLIFE | Night Safari Tour\n\nSECLUSION | Off The Beaten Track Tour\n\nFLEXIBILITY | Custom Made Tour\n\nADVENTURE | Off The Beaten Track Tour // Custom Made Tour\n\nEASY GOING | Night Safari Tour // Custom Made Tour\n\nSPECIAL INTEREST | Custom Made Tour\n\nStill not quite sure? Reach out and get in touch with Simon or Michelle. We’ll do our best to help you make a wise decision.\n\nThis will depend on which tour you wish to book:\n\nNIGHT SAFARI TOUR | Closed shoes with good grip, such as runners, will do the trick. Yes, the walk is easy, but it takes place at night, and we may have to negotiate some stairs and stepping stones.\n\nLOWER GORGE EXPLORER | You’ll want your best walking shoes for this one, whatever they might be. Runners, walking shoes, or boots are acceptable, but anything with ankle support is better! After 14 km, your body will thank you!\n\nOFF THE BEATEN TRACK | Hiking boots with ankle support are essential for this tour. There is a lot of rock-hopping involved, and a wet foot or two is not unusual. You’ll be particularly comfortable if your boots are waterproof.\n\nCUSTOM MADE TOUR | This will depend entirely on the experience you design for yourself. Be sure to check in with Simon and Michelle when planning your itinerary.\n\nThe following local accommodation options are all within 5km of Carnarvon Gorge.\n\nHowever, they tend to book out well in advance, especially ahead of school holiday periods.\n\nNATIONAL PARK CAMPING | The Carnarvon Gorge Campground is only open for two week blocks at the Easter, July and September Queensland School Holidays. Big Bend is open year-round, but can only be accessed by walking in. It is a 10km from the Visitor Information Centre.\n\nBREEZE HOLIDAY PARK | Formerly known as Takarakka Bush Resort, this caravan park is open year-round and provides a bit of everything. Powered and unpowered sites, safari tents, ensuited safari tents, cabins and studi0 apartments. Plus, they have great camp kitchens, ablution blocks, and plenty of native wildlife sightings!\n\nSANDSTONE PARK | Open from Easter until October, this Caravan Park is designed for the self-sufficient traveller. There are no showers or powered sites, but they have epic 360 degree views and the best reviewed portaloos in the country! Check Tripadvisor and WikiCamps if you don’t believe us!\n\nCARNARVON GORGE WILDERNESS LODGE | Open from March until November. 28 ensuited, safari-style tents dotted throughout lovely grounds. Cafe and French patisserie open for breakfast and lunch. Camp kitchens for DIY dinner preparation."
