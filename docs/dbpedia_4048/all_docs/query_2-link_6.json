        "text": "Carnarvon Western Australia lets you experience natural wonders, extraordinary local history, adventure and the chance to bliss out. Carnarvon has it all.\n\nLaid-back Carnarvon is perfectly positioned between Shark Bay to the south and the Ningaloo World Heritage areas to the north. It’s the starting point for your next adventure.\n\nStay a while though and discover this fascinating town’s historic, cultural and foodie highlights. About 5,000 people currently call Carnarvon home, and the population is a rich mix of heritages and cultures.\n\nSince the 1930s it has become famed for its produce with the rich flats of the Gascoyne River being used to grow bananas, avocados, coconuts, dates, macadamia nuts, mangoes, pawpaws, pecans, tomatoes, pineapples, melons and various varieties of beans due to the aquifers on the Gascoyne River.\n\nCarnarvon is a tropical oasis in a parched landscape. Thanks to this unique geographical advantage, Carnarvon’s fertile plantations and farms supply the majority (70%) of Perth’s fruit and vegetables during the winter months.\n\nAnd yet, if you visit during the summer months, this mighty river is dry as a bone; its parched, wide riverbed leaving an echo of its true nature, owing only after the rains fall further inland. Known as an ephemeral river, the Gascoyne is the key to Carnarvon’s extraordinary place in WA’s agricultural story.\n\nCarnarvon Western Australia achieved fame when, on 20 July 1969, Neil Armstrong stepped out of Apollo 11 onto the surface of the moon. His famous words “One small step for man. One giant leap for mankind” were relayed via the tracking station at Carnarvon.\n\nToday the town has a range of tourist activities and is an important service centre for the surrounding properties.\n\nCarnarvon was named after Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, who was the British Secretary of State from 1866-74 and had been the Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1866-67 and 1874-78."
