        "text": "From the pub to the supermarket checkout line, it is not uncommon to hear Indigenous language sprinkled into conversation between Carnarvon's multicultural residents.\n\nAbout 900 kilometres north of Perth, the coastal community has cultivated a unique vocabulary of words, phrases, slang and hand gestures, drawing on the knowledge of First Nations people and the ways they have articulated life on country for tens of thousands of years.\n\nPassing a friend on the street, you might catch an affectionate buja or jij.\n\nWearing some new shoes? Those are dardy, though spellings may vary.\n\nMiddamia woman Sahneemah Moncrieff said the blending of Yinggarda, Wajarri, Noongar, English and other languages connected her heritage to an \"everyday living\" culture.\n\n\"Back in the day, the language was stolen or forbidden to be spoken,\" Ms Moncrieff said.\n\nCarnarvon, or Gwoonwardu — where the river water meets the sea, as the lands are traditionally known to Yinggarda people — has been a rich site of language exchange for generations.\n\nWith cultural ties to multiple Aboriginal language groups, the town's journey from remote wool export port to plantation-ringed food bowl also welcomed diverse migrant communities from across south-east Asia and the Pacific Islands.\n\nMs Moncrieff said it was heartening to see people from all walks of life learning the local lingo.\n\n\"If other people from different backgrounds and cultures are going to use Aboriginal slang, it's a way to say they understand us,\" she said.\n\nRyan Zare grew up in a bilingual household of English and Farsi.\n\nHe said it didn't take long to pick up Carnarvon's particular vernacular after moving from Perth five years ago.\n\n\"One [word] I use quite often is nyoongarji. That means goanna,\" he said.\n\n\"At first I thought, what in the world is that? But now I don't know it as anything else.\"\n\nSchoolyard slang\n\nYinggarda woman Marleigh Nugent, 18, understands the importance of language to preserving culture.\n\nMs Nugent said she was learning to speak Yinggarda from her grandmother, one of its few fluent speakers.\n\nBut since her school days, she has recognised several of her people's expressions in the slang of her peers.\n\n\"Always around the teachers ... our teachers [have] definitely started to pick up on the slang now and they will actually know what you're saying.\"\n\nShe said it often began as playful jabs on the playground.\n\n\"My favourite one to say is gulus,\" Ms Nugent said.\n\n\"Gulus means nits, but it can also be like, 'Oh, just gulu-ing around', so you're just having a look at something.\n\nA linguistic phenomenon\n\nWangka Maya Aboriginal Language Centre senior linguist Annie Cameron said it was no coincidence the more humorous words jumped barriers first.\n\n\"It's often in those situations that social connection is easier to make,\" she said.\n\n\"We know in smaller, rural and isolated communities, social cohesion can operate differently to metropolitan areas and we see that coming out linguistically.\n\n\"The use of Aboriginal languages [in these communities] ... can be a sign of a higher rate of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children growing up together.\"\n\nChildren, she said, were especially absorbent \"sponges\" of language.\n\n\"They don't necessarily have the social parameters around them that adults might have,\" Ms Cameron said.\n\n\"So they learn language very quickly and they learn to communicate with other people very quickly.\"\n\nAlthough often unconscious, Ms Cameron believes the embedded nature of Indigenous words in everyday speech signals their enduring value.\n\n\"[Whadjuk Noongar elder] Len Collard makes the incredibly valid point that most Western Australians use Noongar or some form of Aboriginal language every day without even realising it, in the use of speaking about place,\" she said.\n\nThreat of extinction\n\nThere are about 120 Aboriginal languages in Western Australia.\n\nOnly five are expected to be passed on to children by 2050, according to the Wangka Maya Aboriginal Language Centre in South Hedland.\n\nWattandee elder and one of last speakers of the Winjarroo language, Thomas Cameron, has called Carnarvon home for more than 40 years.\n\nHe said Indigenous language in any form played a crucial role in making the country legible to those who lived on it.\n\nMr Cameron would like to see language formally taught to everyone, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, in schools before it is too late.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it's not about the colour of our skin,\" he said.\n\n\"It's how we can work together in collaboration with one another for a better life, for the future.\""
