        "text": "Carnarvon is a coastal town situated approximately 900 kilometres north of Perth, Western Australia. Ideally situated between the Shark Bay and Ningaloo Coast World Heritage Areas, Carnarvon is a great place to rest, relax and recharge.\n\nIt lies at the mouth of the Gascoyne River on the Indian Ocean. The popular Shark Bay world heritage area lies to the south of the town and the Ningaloo Reef and the popular tourist town of Exmouth lie to the north.\n\nKnown as the fruit bowl of Western Australia, the town of Carnarvon produces 80% of WA’s total fruit and vegetable crops. Much of WA’s seafood comes from Carnarvon with a thriving prawn, scallop, crab and fishing industry."
