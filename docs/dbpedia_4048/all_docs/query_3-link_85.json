Powerful ocean swells force water through sea caves and up out of narrow holes in the rocks, jets of water erupt into the air, sometimes up to a height of 20 metres, creating a spectacular sight.\n\nOld Tramway Walk Trail\n\nThe tramway offers a 3 km walking and cycling trail between Olivia Terrace in Carnarvon and the heritage precinct around One Mile Jetty. The railway line has been rebuilt and the trail runs beside the rails.\n\nMt Augustus\n\nRising 715m above the surrounding alluvial plain, Mount Augustus is an inselberg, meaning ‘island mountain’. There are rocky creeks, gorges and open plains supporting a variety of vegetation and wildlife.\n\nRailway Station Museum\n\nPart of the Heritage Precinct, this wander-though museum (really a large open shed) houses an old steam train, plus info about sheep-shearing in the area. Climb the creaky water tower for views of the jetty, Carnarvon and the coast."
