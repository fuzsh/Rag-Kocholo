        "meta_description": "The Carnarvon Horticulture District is located along the fertile delta of the Gascoyne River. This irrigated area is one of the most productive in Western Australia for horticulture, producing a wide variety of fruit and vegetable crops including but not limited to bananas, table grapes, mangoes, melons, tomatoes, capsicums & green beans. The majority of Carnarvon's vegetable production occurs during the winter months where sunlight & temperature in Carnarvon is favourable for vegetable production.",

        "text": "There are approximately 170 plantations in the Carnarvon Horticulture District, which cultivate a yearly average of 1200 hectares of land. In 2019 the district produced 39,150 tonnes of produce with a gross value of over $94m. Land for future expansion is being investigated and will be made available in the near future.\n\nIrrigation water is utilised from aquifers beneath and adjacent to the Gascoyne River. The Gascoyne River is an ephemeral river that flows only when high rainfall events occur in the inland catchment. The aquifers are recharged during river flow events. Scheme water is available from the Gascoyne Water Cooperative through an allocation and water trading scheme. Growers utilise water from the scheme and individual Department of Water and Environmental Regulation’s licenced bores to irrigate crops. Most crops in Carnarvon are grown using drip irrigation which maximises water use efficiency.\n\nThe majority of produce is transported 1000km south via trucks to service the local Perth market. A smaller proportion travels further afield to interstate and overseas markets.\n\nDetailed statistics for the horticultural produce in Carnarvon are available from the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development Carnarvon Office and are attached to this webpage."
