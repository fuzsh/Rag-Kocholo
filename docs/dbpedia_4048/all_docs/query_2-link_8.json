        "text": "For the national park in Queensland, see Carnarvon National Park\n\nCarnarvon is a town in the Gascoyne region of Western Australia, with a population in 2016 of 4426. Once a port for the shipping of livestock, it's now a fruit & veg growing area and has a small fishing industry. It's the last town of any size before heading north into arid country towards Exmouth and Port Hedland, so for travellers it's a good overnight stop and chance to stock up.\n\nThe town stands at the mouth of the Gascoyne River. The Inggarda Aboriginal people called this area Kuwinywardu, meaning \"neck of water\".\n\nThe TIC, downtown at 21 Robinson St, is open M-F 9AM-5PM, Sa 9AM to noon. In April 2021 Carnarvon was badly damaged by Cyclone Seroja, which swept away the historic jetty, but all the hotels and facilities described here were back in business by 2022.\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nRex Airlines flies twice M-F and once Sa Su from Perth, either direct (2 hr 15 min) or via Shark Bay / Monkey Mia (3 hr). The return flights are direct with no Carnarvon to Shark Bay service. Neither Qantas nor Virgin Australia (the former Southwest) fly here.\n\nBy road, you approach on the NW Coastal Highway, and know you're close when you see the OTC Dish pointing into space.\n\nIntegrity Coaches run twice a week from Perth (12 hours) via Geraldton, and continue north towards Exmouth (4 hours) and Broome. TransWA buses don't run this far north.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nThe town's sights are a little way out, within range of a hot dusty hike, but think about the coming back and then hire a car. Avis and Budget have rental offices here.\n\nGascoyne Taxis (+61 477 757 977) and Carnarvon Taxis (+61 8 9941 1499) are both sound and reliable."
