        "text": "It's a dream job, but for Sheridan Lawton being a ranger where her ancestors have walked, sung and lived is also about reconnecting to her heritage.\n\nThe Bidjara, Butchulla and Ghungalu woman has worked at Carnarvon National Park in central Queensland for two years.\n\n\"I tried really hard to get a job here,\" she said.\n\n\"It wasn't a matter of working in any park, it was a matter of working in this park,\" she said.\n\n\"I wanted to get back to working on country and find that connection myself, and maybe re-establish a bit of that cultural knowledge that unfortunately has been lost.\"\n\nThe 30-year-old experienced her first taste of being a ranger at Carnarvon Gorge when she took a month off from work to volunteer in the role.\n\n\"A year later I applied for the job,\" she said.\n\n\"I've learnt so much, I've done so many things that I probably would never have done working in an office back home [in Rockhampton].\n\n'My heart sang'\n\nAs the son of a Bidjara man and Ghungalu woman, Milton Lawton, who is a relative of Ms Lawton, said having two Indigenous rangers at the park was significant.\n\n\"It's enormous, it's a matriarchal story. It makes sense that we have female rangers,\" he said.\n\n\"My heart sang when I heard that Sheridan was given an opportunity to work in that space and young Tasha Richards that's come along.\"\n\nThe traditional owner and his family have played a role at Kooramandangie, known as the Carnarvon Ranges, for many years.\n\n\"We've had 11 members from my family work as park rangers in the Gorge, Mount Moffatt and Blackdown Tableland, including my three children,\" he said.\n\nA former ranger himself, Mr Lawton said they were all compelled to work on their country.\n\n\"It's a way of giving back to the legacy that our forefathers and mothers have left us,\" he said.\n\nTrespassing for a selfie\n\nMs Lawton said the job was extremely rewarding and visitors treated the area respectfully, for the most part.\n\n\"But the odd few who don't, over time that impact can damage or destroy these sites and we won't have them for future generations,\" she said.\n\n\"There's been a few challenges with visitors in that they're entering our restricted access areas, more specifically our cultural sites, all just to get a photo.\n\n\"There's very clearly a cultural heritage site. There's cultural significance there, whether it's the rock art or rock etchings or just a spiritual place to be.\n\nRanger-in-charge Lindie Pasma said despite signage, people had continued to illegally jump barriers and post photos on social media.\n\nMs Pasma said people were also putting their lives at risk by standing on cliff edges.\n\n\"We have been able to issue them with penalty infringement notices based on that evidence, which is a $400 fine,\" she said.\n\n\"But the maximum penalty for that is more than $10,000.\"\n\nBoth relatives share a strong desire to manage the park and protect sites.\n\nMr Lawton said changing European names of sites to traditional or dual names would be a start, but more education was needed.\n\n\"There's no information there to inform people of what all those places are,\" he said.\n\nCall to reinstate ranger program\n\nMr Lawton was part of a Traditional Owner Management Group that introduced a Seasonal Ranger Program.\n\n\"It was quite successful, then it stopped,\" he said.\n\n\"It was basically implemented to give our young people an opportunity to work in a space like Carnarvon [and] be mentored by a gentleman by the name of Uncle Fred Conway, whose heart and soul belongs in that place.\"\n\nHe said the program ran for more than five years, but came to an end with the loss of several elders and subsequent disintegration of the original management group.\n\nThe Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service has been contacted for comment.\n\nMr Lawton's dream is to see a permanent presence of traditional owners such as Ms Lawton.\n\n\"You do have your days when you're really buggered and you've hiked 20 kilometres and you want to kick your feet up,\" she said.\n\n\"Then when people remind you, they say 'oh, you've got the best job in the world' – you stop for a minute and think, yeah I had a hard day, but I do work in a really beautiful place and I'm really fortunate to be here.\""
