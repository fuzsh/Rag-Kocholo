        "text": "The town was founded in 1883 when settlers in Carnarvon drove 4000 sheep from York east of Perth seeking warmer agricultural land. Some of Australiaâ€™s largest sheep stations were set up and the jetty 1493m became the first port in Western Australia, and perhaps the world, to regularly export livestock.\n\nNow, Carnarvon is situated approximately 904km north of Perth in Western Australia, on the west coast. This city offers an abundance of attractions such as the One Mile Jetty or the beautiful Blowholes but also some accommodation and exciting tourism products making Carnarvon a wonderful place for a truly memorable holiday.\n\nCarnarvon is recognised for its banana plantations, tropical fruits, fine seafood, its warm and tropical climate and is situated on the mouth of the Gascoyne River where it enters the Indian Ocean. It is the largest town in the Gascoyne Region where tourists can discover the numerous sparkling beaches, brilliant displays of wildflowers and spectacular ocean blowholes.\n\nWeather\n\nCarnarvon has a warm to hot semi-arid climate. Average yearly rainfall is 226 millimetres with the rainiest months (and the most reliable rainfall) being in May and June. Occasionally tropical cyclone will influence Carnarvon and bring very heavy rain, high temperatures and strong winds but apart from this, summers are hot and dry and winters are warm."
