There’s a few touristy things around town too.\n\nSpent midday at the blow holes. Quite fun!\n\nCooked up some lunch in the oven while taking pics of the huge waves crashing against the coast.\n\nCrazy kids jumping down on the rocks almost getting washed away.\n\nDrove south a few hundred k’s and camped on the side of the highway."
