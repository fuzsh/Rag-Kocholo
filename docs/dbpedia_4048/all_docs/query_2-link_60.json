        "text": "Prepare to be mesmerised.\n\nCarnarvon National Park is a mammoth area of gob-smacking splendour, led by a dramatic gorge that share its name.\n\nAnd there is a mountain of ways to appreciate the bucketloads of beauty that rush from these reaches.\n\nHere is your essential guide to one of Queensland’s most iconic natural gems.\n\nWhy is Carnarvon National Park so special?\n\nCommonly described as an ‘outback oasis’, Carnarvon National Park is lauded for its rich natural, ecological, and cultural elements.\n\nCarnarvon Gorge is the headliner: its colourful and rugged cloud-piercing walls seemingly stretch forever and leave many visitors gaping in sheer amazement.\n\nIt’s joined by all manner of natural wonders that include swimming holes, ancient cycads, rainforest, and other fascinating flora, and a huge assortment of animals, reptiles, and bird species.\n\nThere is also a deep Aboriginal connection to the area, most tangible for visitors via various ancient rock art sites.\n\nThings to do in Carnarvon National Park\n\nThere are some seriously unforgettable activities to enjoy, from the sedate to the stirring. They include:\n\nSwimming (designated rock pool area)\n\nBirdwatching\n\nNighttime safari-style tours\n\nAstronomy tours/star gazing (seasonal)\n\nScenic helicopter flights\n\nYet the signature experience is planting your feet along one of the park’s many scenic walking tracks. More on that below.\n\nAboriginal culture in Carnarvon National Park\n\nThese surrounds are of great historical and cultural significance to the Bidjara and Karingbal people. And their strong connection to Carnarvon National Park is best evidenced by the ancient rock art found on the gorge’s walls.\n\nOchre stencils, engravings, and freehand paintings all feature. Some examples of the ochre stencilling are regarded as the most sophisticated of their kind on the planet.\n\nTwo key walking trails incorporate the natural art galleries. They are:\n\nArt Gallery walk: 10.8km from visitor area return\n\nCathedral Cave walk: 18.2km from visitor area return\n\nCarnarvon National Park wildlife\n\nA wealth of wildlife calls the park home. Kangaroos and wallabies make regular appearances and echidnas, possums, and yellow-bellied gliders can be spotted after dark. Additionally, dozens of bat species are residents of the park.\n\nThere’s also the chance to spy platypus, best attempted early morning or at twilight while tackling the aforementioned 1.5km-long Nature Trail.\n\nThere’s an on-site general store, camp kitchens with BBQs, and communal fire pits for those cooler nights.\n\nAnd after a busy day’s exploration, the shade-filled Taka Bush Bar is the place to enjoy a well-earned beverage."
