These stories are passed down through the generations like a gift and keep the land and culture alive.\n\nAncient & Continuing Culture\n\nArchaeological sites from Shark Bay to Ningaloo show occupation by Aboriginal people between 35,000 – 30,000 years ago.\n\nStation Lives, Station Stories\n\nThe pastoral stations are central to the story of Aboriginal people, who remember the station days as hard but good times. They lived close to their land with their families.\n\nNot Just Lying Around\n\nWhen white people began travelling through the country, traditional material began to disappear. Sometimes things were found in the bush and removed because white people thought they had been abandoned.\n\nMission Lives, Mission Stories\n\nThe exhibition tells the story of how Aboriginal people were moved from the stations and their lives changed.\n\nCarnarvon Town\n\nAboriginal ancestors lived in the area known as Carnarvon long before it became a town.\n\nEntry fees\n\nGeneral entry to Gwoonwardu Mia is FREE entry fee to Permanent Exhibitions:"
