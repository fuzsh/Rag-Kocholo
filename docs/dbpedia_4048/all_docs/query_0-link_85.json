        "text": "23 kms across the peninsula from Denham is Monkey Mia, best known as the home of the Monkey Mia dolphins. There is only 1 resort at Monkey Mia, hence our staying at Denham which is a beautiful coastal town, with accommodation and restaurants.\n\nFamous for their almost daily ritual of swimming to shore to interact with humans, the dolphins of Monkey Mia attract thousands of visitors to the World Heritage listed region every year.\n\nThe bottlenose dolphins are wild, so numbers and the exact time of their visit varies. However they usually visit the shore up to three times a day and more frequently in the mornings.\n\nThe dolphins now days are protected by Western Australia’s Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC), the dolphins are well looked after. You may get the opportunity to feed the dolphins under the supervision of a national park ranger, though this privilege is not guaranteed.\n\nWe didn’t go there to feed the dolphins, but instead to have a look and see what everyone talks about.\n\nTony and I got there early 7:45am, we paid the entry fee to the National Park at the gate, parked and made our way up to the dolphin viewing area. We were surprised to see so many people already standing in the water waiting for the dolphins to show up. For about 15 minutes we waited but no dolphins appeared, so we went up to the resort to have breakfast. After breakfast we walked back to the dolphins and as we arrived, so did the dolphins. Talk about good timing.\n\nThe pervious day, we did not have time to stop and see everything there is to see on the 130km stretch of road in to Denham, so we had until midday to see what we could and be at the Overlander by midday.\n\nIn between the scenic stops, a thick covering of low bushes as far as the eye can see was the view from my window. A great environment for critters like Echidna’s and Bilbies.\n\nUp till now both days we had arrived at our destinations around 5pm, too late to do much as it gets dark around 6pm, so today we planned to get to our destination of Carnarvon by 3pm, so we could get to see the town before dark.\n\nEagle Bluff only a short distance from Denham features a spectacularly high cliff that overlooks the Denham Sound near Shark Bay. It offers a bird’s eye view of the surrounding area by way of a cliff top broad-walk.\n\nThe dark patches in the water is sea grass, which is home to a large population of dugong, sharks, sea snakes and the rare Western Australian Sea Horse.\n\nI could have spent hours and hours here, watching for marine life but we didn’t have the time.\n\nFurther along the road, Shell Beach is an absolutely beautiful snow-white beach made up of millions of tiny shells up to 10 metres deep and stretching for over 120 kilometres.\n\nIsn’t it wonderful to go places where there are no other people.\n\nIf you took the time to turn off and drive to the Shark Bay World Heritage area, you would be crazy not to stop and see the oldest and largest living fossils in the world, the stromatolites at Hamelin Pool Marine and Nature Reserve.\n\nHamelin Pool in Western Australia is one of only two places on earth where living marine stromatolites exist.\n\nScientists around the world have studied these living organisms and compare them to discovering a living dinosaur. The Hamelin Pool Stromatolites are the best example in the world of these rare organisms.\n\nIt’s believed the stromatolites were formed by algae, sediment and sand binding and forming hard rock over millions of years. They’ve survived in this area because of the high salt content of the water which is trapped by a sandbar.\n\nThe Stromatolites grow at an astonishingly slow rate – around 0.33 millimetres each year.\n\nBy the time we got to the Overlander Roadhouse we were only 15 minutes behind schedule. I decided I would drive as there was nothing to see except road and trucks from the Overlander to Carnarvon and I would get there quicker.\n\nCarnarvon lies just over 900 kilometres north of Perth, it is famous for it’s banana plantations, seasonal fruit and vegetables and top quality seafood. It’s population is less than 5,000 and while it is a very pretty town situated on the mouth of the Gascoyne River,\n\nthere really wasn’t a lot to do in town. Further inland there is Mount Augustus National Park located 460km east of Carnarvon and the Kennedy Range National Park located 150 kilometres east. 4wd vehicles are required to access most of the national parks.\n\nWe arrived in Carnarvon a little after 3pm and after doing a couple of circuits of the small town, we stumbled across our very nice accommodation over the road from the Fascine.\n\nWe met the apartment owner and asked where best to dine that evening. He told us we didn’t have many options and that the two pubs in town offered the best meals.\n\nDriving out to One Mile Jetty it was blowing an absolute gale, so I donned my fleecy jacket and too cold to walk the mile long jetty, we jumped on board the train that would carry us the distance and back.\n\nThe Carnarvon jetty is the longest jetty in the north of Western Australia and was constructed in 1897.\n\nIn the late 1800s, as the pastoral industry developed in Carnarvon, the local population pressured the government to develop a port for the town. By 1897 the jetty had been built and wool and livestock produced in the region began to be exported to Fremantle, and essential goods for the town imported using state shipping.\n\nIn 1904 the head of the jetty was added and in 1912 the jetty head was widened because of increasing traffic including passengers. Carnarvon was the first port in the world which loaded live stock on board ships for transport to markets. The One Mile Jetty once boasted an animal race the length of the jetty along which the sheep were driven from holding yards. I am not so sure that it is any thing to boast about.\n\nFreezing cold, we headed back to town. Our apartment was just around the corner from the main drag, so we walked into town to visit the local real estate office and see what property prices were like. Shocked by the prices of real estate we walked past the local police station, even as far north as Carnarvon the trees are effected by the prevailing winds.\n\nDinner was at the local pub, a 1 minute walk from our accommodation and it was exceptionally good food. Up till now I haven’t mentioned our meals but I should fore-warn anyone who is thinking of going to the West Coast and doing it on the cheap…………it is not possible. Food is outrageously expensive as is accommodation, restaurants are minimal and accommodation tends to be quite basic, until you get to Broome. There are a few exceptions like my unexpected find in Carnarvon which I booked before we left home. I had no idea our accommodation was going to be so well appointed and modern.\n\nA main meal price is up to $10 more per person than what we pay on the Gold Coast.\n\nWhen I first planned this trip, I thought we would try and do it quite cheaply and stay at motel style accommodation along the way, expecting to pay about $100 per night for the 2 of us. When I started looking at accommodation, I realised there was little accommodation available and that I would have to book before we left, otherwise we could find that when we arrived at a destination there would be nothing available, and it is a long distance between towns, as you will be learning by now. All our accommodation was booked about 10 weeks out and on average we paid $230 a night for a bed.\n\nPetrol is another big expense, costing anything from $1.65 to $2.00 per litre and as Australian petrol prices are about to soar, I can only assume they will get a lot higher in Western Australia\n\nI don’t mean to put anyone off, Western Australia is a wonderful destination with so much diversity but it is better to be pre-warned."
