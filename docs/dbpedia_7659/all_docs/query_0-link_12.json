        "text": "Richard Donner\n\nRichard Donner and Lauren Shuler Donner were honored with a rare double ceremony for the 2,372nd and 2,373rd stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Leron Gubler, President and CEO of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce presided over the ceremony. Guests included Dakota Fanning, Bob Daly, Rene Russo, Steven Spielberg, Nate Parker, Tristan Wilds, Gina Prince Blythewood, Gavin Hood, and many others.\n\n6712 Hollywood Boulevard on October 16, 2008.\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nDirector/producer Richard Donner is the creative force behind some of the most popular movies of the last twenty years: “The Omen”, “Superman”, the “Lethal Weapon” series and “Maverick”.\n\nAfter moving to Los Angeles, he won the assignment of directing his friend Steve McQueen for the television series “Wanted: Dead or Alive”. In 1961, he directed Charles Bronson in “X-15,” a melodrama about Air Force test pilots. He continued directing such television series as “The Twilight Zone,” “The Fugitive,” “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.” and “Kojak”.\n\nDuring the 1970’s, Donner directed several acclaimed movies-of-the-week, and in 1975 directed his first successful major feature, “The Omen”, which was released the following year to record-setting business. He next took on the task of transferring the adventures of the most popular pulp hero in five decades to film. Under his direction, “Superman -The Movie” became one of the all-time biggest international hits.\n\nFour films followed the success of “Superman”: “Inside Moves”; “The Toy” starring Jackie Gleason and Richard Pryor; “Ladyhawke”, by far his favorite for many reasons, (most importantly because he fell in love with producer Lauren Shuler, who later became his wife) and “The Goonies”, produced with Steven Spielberg.\n\nIn “Lethal Weapon”, Donner introduced two cops who would become the Cinema’s most popular crime fighting duo, played by Danny Glover and Mel Gibson. “Lethal Weapon 2” proved even more successful, and the two stars teamed up for “Lethal Weapon 3”, released in May of 1992, which went on to become one of the highest-grossing pictures of all time, earning more than $150 million. “Lethal Weapon 4”, with all the favorites, Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Rene Russo and Joe Pesci, was released in July of 1998, this time introducing Chris Rock and Jet Li. The Lethal Weapon quartet has grossed close to a billion dollars.\n\nDonner’s other films include: “Scrooged,” “Radio Flyer,” “Lost Boys,” “Maverick,” “Assassins,” “Timeline,” “Superman II, The Richard Donner Cut and Warner Bros.'”16 Blocks.”\n\namzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";amzn_assoc_search_bar = \"true\";amzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"wof04-20\";amzn_assoc_search_bar_position = \"bottom\";amzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"search\";amzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";amzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";amzn_assoc_region = \"US\";amzn_assoc_title = \"Shop Richard Donner\";amzn_assoc_default_search_phrase = \"Richard Donner\";amzn_assoc_default_category = \"All\";amzn_assoc_linkid = \"f60fad7e721b4a255f8de240becbd050\";"
