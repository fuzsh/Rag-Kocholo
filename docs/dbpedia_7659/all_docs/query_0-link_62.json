And re-fried beans.\n\nLord... whatever I've done to piss you off... if you could just get me out of this and somehow let me know what it was I promise to rectify the situation.\n\nAnnabelle Bransford\n\n[edit]\n\nYou thought that was fast? I thought it was fast. Well was it?\n\nIf I can't touch you, I can touch your shirt and dream.\n\nOther\n\n[edit]\n\nZane Cooper: I've never committed a cold blooded murder in my life, and I'm not about to. Not till I find Maverick.\n\nJoseph: Yeah, I know. You know the next time you people come and drive us off our land I'm gonna find a nice piece of swamp that's so God-awful, maybe then you'll leave us the hell alone.\n\nAngel: Almost got hung once myself. Didn't care for it much.\n\nLead Bank Robber: I'm getting too old for this shit.\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nAnnabelle: [speaking in a very southern drawl] Ah shouldn't be doin' this.\n\nMaverick: You're just standing in the hallway, Mrs Bransford, I think that's still legal in this state.\n\nAnnabelle: There isn't a Mrs. Maverick is there?\n\nMaverick: Oh I'm sure I would have remembered.\n\nMaverick: You tend to breathe hard when you get excited.\n\nAnnabelle: How did you - oh.\n\nMaverick: So, are you gonna miss me?\n\nAnnabelle: Are you gonna miss me?\n\nMaverick: You ARE gonna miss me.\n\nZane Cooper: Well, Bret, you know what we ended up with? A half a million dollar silk shirt.\n\nMaverick: Nope, we ended up with a quarter million dollar silk shirt, because my old pappy always used to say \"Don't put the chicken in front of\"... no, wait \"Never cut the cards before\"... no, wait, \"Don't put all you eggs in one basket\".\n\nZane Cooper: Now that, I said.\n\nTaglines\n\n[edit]\n\nThe greatest gambler in the West has finally met his match.\n\nIn their hands, a deck of cards was the only thing more dangerous than a gun.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nMel Gibson - Bret Maverick, Jr.\n\nJodie Foster - Mrs. Annabelle Bransford\n\nJames Garner - Marshall Zane Cooper\n\nGraham Greene - Joseph\n\nAlfred Molina - Angel\n\nJames Coburn - Commodore Duvall\n\nWikipedia has an article about:"
