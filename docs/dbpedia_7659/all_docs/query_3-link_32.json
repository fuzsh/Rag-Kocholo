        "text": "A film based in the concept of the American west captures our attention today with this review of the Richard Donner directed movie Maverick (1994). Written by William Goldman and based on Maverick (TV Series 1957-1962) created by Roy Huggins, the movie looks comedically at the gambling world with a penchant for hustling others out of their money.\n\nBret Maverick Jr., as portrayed by Mel Gibson, opens Maverick on the paddle steamer Lauren Belle. Maverick Jr. aims to prove his superior skills at playing five-card draw in a poker tournament while collecting $3,000 of a $25,000 entrance fee needed for a later tournament, encountering a grouchy gambler named Angel and a young con artist named Annabelle Bransford. Alfred Molina portrayed Angel as Jodie Foster portrayed Bransford. Angel takes to what he perceives as being cheated in the card game by Maverick Jr., which is based in a correct view of what actually happened.\n\nMarshal Zane Cooper, as portrayed by James Garner, encounters Bret Maverick Jr. and Annabelle Bransford as the pair makes a haste getaway from the rigged card game in Crystal River by stagecoach. The group nearly plunge into a ravine following the sudden death of their coach driver, later aiding a group of missionary settlers robbed by bandits disguised as native Americans. The trio of Cooper, Bransford and Maverick Jr. get cornered by a group of the natives led by Joseph, an unknown friend of Maverick Jr. for the others as portrayed by Graham Greene. Another elaborate ruse to swindle another group out of money that Joseph owes Maverick Jr. ties to the larger sequence of running action and gags that exemplify the action-based comedy underlining much of this Western‘s point-of-view.\n\nThe tournament that has been the operating objective for the movie’s tension throughout leads to the revelation of more previously unknown connections and motivations among movie characters, including for one Commodore Duvall as portrayed by James Coburn. Anyone found to be cheating, comically, gets summarily thrown overboard from the paddle steamer of the tournament. The resolution to tensions at this card game reveal much with panache worthy of the movie, with still further shenanigans culminating in further panache that brings forth more hidden planning that make clear the comedy Western this movie has been.\n\nComing into the movie expecting humor, entertainment and a meandering good time is the right point-of-view for experiencing this film. I grant Maverick as directed by Richard Donner 3.75-stars on a scale of one-to-five.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, July 31, 2024\n\nIt’s not every day that an action and thriller movie is set against the backdrop of a holiday. It has become more common to see moves themed as romances or romantic comedies set against Christmas. The Richard Donner directed Lethal Weapon (1987) managed to mix the action thriller against a Christmas in the households of the characters that inhabit the movie’s universe. Today, we look into the happenings of Los Angeles policemen, one celebrating a birthday while the other recently lost his wife.\n\nMel Gibson portrays Sergeant Martin Riggs of the narcotics division of the police, who we meet in a borderline suicidal anxiety in his home. The audience sees Riggs in the depth of his feelings while looking at a framed picture of his wife with what presumably is his service firearm. Captain Ed Murphy and Dr. Stephanie Woods as a mental health practitioner argue over whether Riggs is in a proper condition to serve. Riggs is given a new partner in the face of this. Steve Kahan and Mary Ellen Trainor portrayed Captain Murphy and Dr. Woods, respectively.\n\nSergeant Roger Murtaugh, as portrayed by Danny Glover, is introduced amongst his family on his birthday. Murtaugh’s kids surprise him as he soaks in the family bathtub with a birthday cake, which simultaneously embarrasses the father while showing him to be the consummate family man. By the next day, Murtaugh and Riggs are partners with experience in the Vietnam War and special forces of the military.\n\nThe past military lives of Murtaugh and Riggs come to relevance without discreet attempts by either man to specifically seek it out. This and other coincidences conspire when the daughter of Michael Hunsaker, a friend Murtaugh knew from the men’s time serving in Vietnam, dies in Los Angeles. Hunsaker had called Murtaugh just before Hunsaker’s daughter had suffered a death that seemingly had something to do with her life in an unsavory world. The possibility of there being more to this isn’t revealed until after Murtaugh and Riggs dig into their own professional relationship. Tom Atkins portrayed Michael Hunsaker.\n\nThe plot thickens with the introduction of Mitchell Ryan as General Peter McAllister and Gary Busey as Mr. Joshua. A criminal enterprise brings a genuine edge to the law enforcement perspective of the story that pairs with stylized comedic turns involving Riggs, Murtaugh, their relationship and the history both bring to their initial pairing as partners.\n\nThe pace of Lethal Weapon works to a positive effect in setting a comprehensible story that feels entertaining. I found myself engaged and giggling at some of the silly humor while rooting for things to end well for both sergeants. The full impact of Lethal Weapon as directed by Richard Donner leads me to grant the movie 4.25-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, December 22, 2021\n\nReturning yet again to the horror movie genre, we look into the movie The Omen (1976). Richard Donner directed a commercial success told at a quick, hard-hitting pace that builds suspense and dread in place of gore and guts in a thematic offering in a sandbox suggested for some with The Exorcist (1973).\n\nThe Omen opens with American diplomat Robert Thorn and his wife Katherine are living in Rome, Italy, where their biological son dies on June 6th at 6:00 AM. Robert is presented with an option to adopt a child that is offered to him in secret, which he chooses to present to Katherine as their biological child. The child, taking the name Damien Thorn, is portrayed at five years of age by Harvey Stephens. Gregory Peck portrayed Robert Thorn as Lee Remick portrayed Katherine Thorn.\n\nIt is in that five-years that Robert Thorn is appointed ambassador to the United Kingdom, where Katherine and Damien join him. It is in the United Kingdom that the tension begins to escalate dramatically. First, Damien’s nanny, as portrayed by Holly Palance, hangs herself for all to see at the child’s fifth birthday party. A rotweiler appears at the Thorn household, as does and unannounced Mrs. Baylock to serve as the boy’s new nanny. Damien reacts violently to the notion of entering a church. Damien later terrifies and infuriates animals at a wildlife park. Billie Whitelaw portrays Mrs. Baylock.\n\nA series of escalating incidents come in rapid succession, with the situations pointing to the inexplicable destiny that underpins the truth about Damien Thorn. Father Brennan, as portrayed by Patrick Troughton, warns Robert that there are questions. Brennan predicts a new pregnancy for Katherine, and that some sinister developments surrounding Damien will befall the situation. Life and death questions are answered decisively in the aftermath.\n\nPhotographer Keith Jennings, as portrayed by David Warner, takes an interest in the circumstances of tragedy surrounding the Thorn family. Housekeepers for the Thorns abruptly quit, with Mrs. Baylock taking over addition responsibilities while questions of faith surrounding Damien are raised. Keith and Robert return to Rome to investigate Damien’s origins. Father Spiletto, as portrayed by Martin Benson, points Jennings and Robert Thorn to a cemetery that reveals even darker secrets. Rottweilers appear on the scene.\n\nThe tension surrounding Damien’s truth escalates again. Katherine’s fate befalls her. Robert learns a further shocking reality suggested by Carl Bugenhagen, as portrayed by Leo McKern. The truth that Robert Thorn must face is unimaginable, yet what choice will he make? How much further can the truth force one man’s hands? How inevitable is the conflict’s force in this story?\n\nThat the screenplay of David Seltzer is so tightly filmed and edited for presentation by director Richard Donner offers the viewer a story that elevates suspense so clearly. That the audience is so dramatically taken for a ride without a graphic depiction of the underlying realities offer something to the imagination that elevates the story; it is in this restraint that the story itself hit its marks, at least for me. It is through this lens, coupled with the power of the story itself, that I grant The Omen as directed by Richard Donner 4-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Saturday, October 30, 2021\n\nTime travel in a movie can be a cool concept. Mixing in action, adventure and archeology can make for a nice mix of when heading to the past from Arizona. Mix in a fictional locale, castle and a supposedly decisive battle from the Hundred Years’ War set in the spring of 1357 in a made up town in France brings you a movie based on the 1999 Michael Crichton book Timeline. Richard Donner‘s Timeline (2003) brought these concepts to the big screen.\n\nThe movie begins by introducing the audience to an unusual circumstance of a man showing up on a desert road in Arizona, incoherent and mumbling words the seemingly made no sense. The man dies soon after that introduction, and quickly is cremated in what clearly seems an odd turn of covering ones tracks.\n\nPlace this next to an archeological dig in the hills of France, wherein we are introduced to archeologist Professor Johnston and his anti-archeology son Chris Johnston, played by Billy Connolly and Paul Walker, respectively. How the archeology might intersect with the man in a desert a few thousand miles away seems interesting. The notion for how the infatuation of Chris Johnston for archeology student Kate Ericson, as portrayed by Frances O’Connor, also intrigues. Character specific details were modified from the book.\n\nFrançois Dontelle and Andre Marek, portrayed by Rossif Sutherland and Gerard Butler respectively, are a pair of archeology students with relevant roles to be played in the supporting the main objective of pursuing the main intrigue introduced with the movie. A separate and interesting story emerges between Frank Gordon and William Decker, as portrayed by Neal McDonough and Marton Csokas, respectively.\n\nThe underlying notion for setting notions of right, justice and the main narrative of Timeline in motion are Steven Kramer and Robert Doniger, portrayed by Matt Craven and David Thewlis respectively. Their technology coupled with a scientific discovery helps us to explore the relationship between Chris Johnston and his archeologist professor father as well as Andre Marek and Lady Claire.\n\nAnna Friel portrays Lady Claire, whose brother Lord Arnaut becomes a clear rival Lord Oliver in the landscape of France. Lambert Wilson and Michael Sheen portray Arnaut and Oliver, respectively. The rivalry in the context of the larger story offers interesting fodder for the playful action that comes to depict much of the charm in the movie itself.\n\nIf you were seeking something as playful as an Indiana Jones movie, something as historically relevant or moving as Braveheart (1995), or something as action packed as Gladiator (2000), then Timeline will disappoint in comparison. There are redeeming things to Timeline that simply don’t rise to the level of the listed franchises. I reflect an enjoyment in something that made me think of other movies in rating Timeline at 3.5-stars on a scale of one-to-five.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, February 24, 2021\n\nWith the oddness that has been the year 2020, new movie releases have been few and far between. Matt Lynn Digital continued to look into the past for movies to enjoy and review with you. The year saw us review thirty-six (36) films through the year, which we will share with you by decade, shared from highest rated to lowest.\n\nArgo (2012) leads the way for movies from the 2010s. The film earned 4.5-stars on a scale of 1-to-5 stars, which is the highest rating matched only twice for movies this year. Earning 4.0-stars for the decade were Game Night (2018) starring Jason Batemen and Rachel McAdams, Captain Phillips (2013) starring Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi and The Lincoln Lawyer (2011) starring Matthew McConaughey and, for a second time this decade, Bryan Cranston.\n\nFord v Ferrari (2019) offers the first of two starring roles in the Matt Lynn Digital movie reviews for Matt Damon and Christian Bale. The story of the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans earn a rating of 3.75-stars along with The Martian (2015), which starred Matt Damon, Kristen Wiig and Jeff Daniels and Gravity (2013) starring Sandra Bullock, George Clooney, and Ed Harris.\n\nThe Robert Zemeckis film Cast Away (2000) starts in the holiday season where the character portrayed by Tom Hanks faces tremendous odds while delivering an outstanding movie granted 4.25-stars. The movie Ray (2004), starring Jamie Foxx in the role as Ray Charles and the Ang Lee movie Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) starring Michelle Yeoh and Yun-Fat Chow each earned 4-stars in their 2020 reviews.\n\nGangs of New York (2002) leads a stable of five movies to earn 3.75-stars from the decade that began the 21st century. While prominent, the performances by Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Brendan Gleeson, Liam Neeson and John C. Reilly held sway in part for where the ranking placed. Other films from this decade gaining 3.75-stars included The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007) starring Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck, The Blind Side (2009) starring Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw, Friday Night Lights (2004) starring Lucas Black, Billy Bob Thornton and Tim McGraw, and Elf (2003) starring Will Ferrell, James Caan and Zooey Deschanel. The Skulls (2000) starring Joshua Jackson, Paul Walker and Craig T. Nelson earned 3.5-stars.\n\nThe film Fight Club (1999) and the film Goodfellas (1990) bookend the 1990s with a pair of movies earning the 2020 top rating of 4.5-stars offered by Matt Lynn Digital. The football movie Rudy (1993) starring Sean Astin and Ned Beatty is joined by baseball movie The Sandlot (1993) with Denis Leary and the military, political intrigue movie The Hunt for Red October (1990) starring Sean Connery, James Earl Jones, Alec Baldwin and Sam Neill with ratings of 4.0-stars.\n\nBaseball and borderline romantic comedy film For Love of the Game (1999) earned 3.75-stars from Matt Lynn Digital in 2020. The film Mr. Holland’s Opus (1995) with Richard Dreyfuss and the Ron Howard film Far and Away (1992) with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman join For Love of the Game with 3.75-stars. Earning 3.25 stars is the film The Usual Suspects (1995), which starred Kevin Spacey, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro and Kevin Pollak.\n\nThe 4-stars earned by the organized crime movie Scarface (1983) is joined by the Steven Spielberg film Empire of the Sun (1987) starring Christian Bale, John Malkovich and Joe Pantoliano and Tim Burton‘s film Beetlejuice (1988) starring Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Winona Ryder and Michael Keaton. The Richard Donner film Scroooged (1988) starring Bill Murray, John Forsythe, David Johansen and Carol Kane completes the decade with 3.75-stars.\n\nAlien (1979) closed out the 1970s with quite the impact, garnering 4.25-stars for a science fiction story that stands on its own. The Martin Scorsese concert goodbye The Last Waltz (1978) with The Band leads three other productions getting 3.75-stars. Joining The Last Waltz with 3.75-stars include the baseball movie The Bad News Bears (1976) with Walter Mathau and Tatum O’Neal, the western movie The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) starring Clint Eastwood and John Vernon and the comedic war movie Kelly’s Heroes (1970) starring Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Don Rickles, Carroll O’ Connor and Gavin MacLeod.\n\nThe John Ford movie The Man Who Shot Liberty Vance (1962) starred John Wayne, James Stewart, Lee Marvin and Vera Miles in a western that earned 3.75-stars. The Lady Vanishes (1938) put Alfred Hitchcock on the proverbial map with a political commentary in the guise of a thriller starring Margaret Lockwood, Michael Redgrave, Paul Lukas and May Whitty. The Lady Vanishes earned 4.0-stars from Matt Lynn Digital.\n\nMatt Lynn Digital also enjoyed sharing a review of Richard Linklater‘s Before Trilogy of movies. Blog friend Cobra reviewed Before Sunrise (1995), Before Sunset (2004) and Before Midnight (2013) in a single review. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy explore the notion of relationships a bit more fully and cleverly than often happens with any movie franchise. It is with thanks that we look back to this sharing.\n\nShare the Matt Lynn Digital blog with your friends if you see value in what we are doing. We feel these reviews provide excellent content that we would like to continue offering.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, December 30, 2020\n\nMingle the notions of the Charles Dickens classic book A Christmas Carol with a selfish, cynical television executive portrayed by Bill Murray, you get a preview of the better executed Groundhog Day (1993) in the form of Scroooged (1988) as directed by Richard Donner.\n\nBill Murray portrays the character Frank Cross, who in his selfish ways plays the Ebenezer Scrooge role that makes the comedic take on Christmas, named Scrooged, a movie title and a transitive verb. The movie is unique in furthering the notion of making Frank a cynical character who cannot see that he has the chance for sustained love in Claire Phillips, who grants Frank the nickname Lumpy. Karen Allen portrays Claire Phillips.\n\nGrace Cooley, as portrayed by Alfre Woodard, serves as the assistant to Frank Cross. Cooley is the Bob Cratchit of Scrooged, with her son Calvin Cooley serving in the equivalent to Tiny Tim. Nicholas Phillips portrays Calvin Cooley, the son of Grace Cooley through the movie. The Cooley family does serve a role in helping uplift the feeling of Scrooged come the movies conclusion, though the resonance of their purpose in the film loses something in for me in the comedic story that the film means to offer.\n\nWhere Scrooged earns its marks lands moreover in the commentary about the cynical, partly dark, and the sometimes slapstick execution of the commentary made about executive leadership, love, the meaning of Christmas, and the sacrifices made in choosing to pursue certain parts of these competing priorities in the face of other points. Lew Howard, as portrayed by John Forsythe, speaks to the character of Jacob Marley. Frank Cross misunderstands the meaning Lew Howard’s example has for him. Cross and the audience begin the ghostly visits, in fact, with a visit by Frank’s former boss.\n\nDavid Johansen and Carol Kane both inject a brilliant sense of character in their portrayals of the Ghost of Christmas Past and the Ghost of Christmas Present opposite Bill Murray‘s Frank Cross. The sense of taking Cross through his paces both kicking and screaming offer charming examples of comeuppance for Frank Cross that speak well for the movie. The execution of these points reflect the parts of Scrooged that I enjoyed the most. The bringing about of Frank’s change, and the closing contrast of that storyline against Robert Mitchum‘s Preston Rhinelander and Bobcat Goldthwait‘s Eliot Loudermilk were part of where, as mentioned earlier, the movie Groundhog Day exceeds the movie Scrooged.\n\nScrooged as a film works as a Christmas movie, mostly for an older audience than films you would want as a first choice for young children. The point there is suggesting an audience that would most appreciate the humor of this film rather than the inherent sophistication of the film. As a comparison, Scrooged today hits me in a way that is similar to the television series Night Court (1984-1992). My rating for Scrooged as directed by Richard Donner is 3.75-stars on a scale of 1-to-5 stars.\n\nMatt – Saturday, December 18, 2020"
