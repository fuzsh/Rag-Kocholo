        "text": "I’m normally not one to sign a petition of any kind. That said, in my younger day as there was one small item I was willing to support. Back in 2004, after the death of actor Christopher Reeve I was more than willing to lend my name to supporting the release of the fabled “Richard Donner Cut” of Superman II. As a writer I strongly favor the idea of allowing a story teller to tell the original vision of their story, and I had long heard from documentaries and fans just how poorly Donner was treated by the producers of Superman: The Movie. To see this movie, even if it would have to use archived test screen footage would be a treat to see, if for no other reason than it would be the last chance to see “my Superman”. Warner Bros. listened to the fans, and just in time for the release of Superman Returns in 2006, this fabled cut was released, complete with a special introduction from director Richard Donner thanking fans like me for supporting his vision.\n\nIf any filmmaker learned a thing or two from the school of hard knocks, it was Richard Donner, known to his fans as “Dick Donner”. Born in 1930 to two Russian Jewish immigrants, Hattie and Fred Schwatrzberg, in The Bronx area of New York City, Richard aspired to be an actor and moved out to Hollywood. There a TV producer Martin Ritt noticed him in a bit role, took him aside and encouraged him to go into directing, with some of his first gigs being with Desilu studios.\n\nDonner soon showed himself to be a master at the craft directing everything from the classic Twilight Zone episode “Nightmare at 20,000 feet”, to The Rifleman, to Perry Mason, to Gilligan’s Island. With his experience in television firmly secure, he demonstrated a versatile range showing interested producers he could handle a verity of projects.\n\nHe later used his range to make a name for himself in film, directing such hits as The Omen, Superman: The Movie. Goonies, Scrooged, and Lethal Weapon. While he didn’t quite enjoy the notoriety of George Lucas of Steven Spielberg at the time for his work, Superman still became the benchmark that all superhero films would follow after. In fact, Jon Favreau, Christopher Nolan, Patty Jenkins, and Sam Raimi are among some of the directors who site his work as being influential on bringing Iron Man, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Spider-Man to the big screen. Thus, film critics and historians rightly site Donner’s Superman: The Movie along with Spielberg’s Jaws and Lucas’ Star Wars as being among the films responsible for creating the modern day block-buster.\n\nIts easy to see why his take on Superman has made such an indelible mark on cinema. When the producers insisted on a more Adam West style farce, he refused to give in and compromise his integrity by descending into camp, treating the cinematic story of Superman with the same respect and reverence given to a biblical epic like The Ten Commandments or Ben-Hur while framing it with stirring visuals befitting a John Ford western. The tagline for the movie promised that “you will believe that a man can fly”, and sure enough under his direction Reeve, Kidder, Hackman, Brando and company delivered on that promise, bound together by an amazing score from John Williams.\n\nHe could also command great loyalty form his cast. Look no further on how Hackman, and Kidder walked after Superman II because of how the producers treated him, as evidence of that fact. He also had little tolerance for divas on set as is evidenced by how he once remarked,\n\n“I have a bust of Abraham Lincoln in my office, and it’s not because of the greatness he did for our country, but it’s because that whenever I look at it I have to remember an actor killed him.”\n\nDespite how the producers of Superman: The Movie treated him, he never lost love for the character, even penning two Superman graphic novels, Last Son and Escape from Bizzaro World, that were inspired by unused ideas he had for Superman sequels, and short stories featured in the land mark 900th and 1000th issues of Action Comics. He was also one of the few directors who possessed a great collaborative spirit, as is evidenced by how with The Goonies it is impossible to tell where his vision ends and writers/producer Steven Spielberg’s begins. Later, with his wife and producing partner of over 30 years, Lauren Schuler-Donner, he mentored an entirely new generation of filmmakers, including Kevin Fiege of Marvel Studios, and launched the superhero movie renaissance with X-Men.\n\nHe was also great at finding raw, undiscovered acting talent to take on some big roles, ranging from insisting on casting an unknown Julliard trained soap opera star as Superman to insisting on going with an unknown song and dance man from Australia as Wolverine as a producer for X-Men. The bigger the role in his book, the smaller or more off the wall the name. To him the audiences had to “believe” they were seeing these larger-than-life figures without any excess baggage tied to a previous role.\n\nNowadays the idea of “realism” gets bandied about with little attention on what it means. Donner understood it to the core of his being, and it was why he could go from a portrait of a frightened airline passenger, the story of six stranded cast-aways on an uncharted island to the doomed planet of Krypton, to a scrappy bunch of kids trying to save their home, to a homesick killer whale, to a grizzled old veteran and a young play-by-his-own rules rookie.\n\nThat is all boiled down to one word: verisimilitude. Simply put, it’s the appearance of being true or real. For him that all came from grounding the characters in real-believable relationships. You hope someone will listen to William Shatner on “Nightmare at 30,000 feet” from The Twilight Zone. You hope that maybe this time Gilligan won’t much things up and the castaways will be rescued from Gilligan’s Island. You care about Superman and Lois Lane and want to see them wind up together. You care about Mikey and his friends in The Goonies and hope that maybe they’ll find the treasure they need to save their homes. Despite how much he complains about Riggs, you know that Murtaugh is going to work with him again, despite being too old for this “*stuff* in Lethal Weapon. Even a deviation from a text, such as Bill Murry’s Frank Cross ending up with Karen Allen’s Claire in his take on A Christmas Carol, feels like a wheel earned ending for Scrooged.\n\nA writer, or, a director needs to believe in the characters featured in the story they tell if the audience is going to have any investment in the journey. Richard Donner paved the way. I believed so strongly in his Superman at the age of three that I put my good church clothes on over my Superman pajamas and pretended to be Superman, and I believed in it so much at the age of 22 that Superman: The Movie not only became part of my primary resource selection for my Senior Thesis Paper, but was part of my Award Winning Program of Oral Interpretation for my university forensics team, and in my thirties it remains one of my own personal benchmarks as a writer as I hope that my readers can believe in my characters as much as I believed in Superman.\n\nDonner died this past week at the age of 91, coming as a surprise to his fans, not so much because of his age, but because he had been talking about a long-awaited sequel to The Goonies and a fifth Lethal Weapon movie. To his fans it felt like he had more stories left in him, and we were more than ready and willing to go along with him on the journey.\n\nIn Superman the movie Jor-El tells Superman,\n\n“ Live as one of them, Kal-El, to discover where your strength and your power are needed. But always hold in your heart the pride of your special heritage. They can be a great people, Kal-El, they wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way. For this reason above all, their capacity for good, I am sending them you, my only son.”\n\nAnd thank you, Dick for bringing that light to life on the big screen and serving as the guidepost for all superhero stories to follow. The world sorely needs that light, perhaps now more then ever. You made me the Superman fan I am today. To this day I still believe that a man can fly and I always will."
