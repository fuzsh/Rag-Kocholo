Some were strong, others wise, many were brave ... One knew to never draw an inside straight. Academy Award winners Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster star with James Garner in a romantic romp about the most charming con man to ever ply his trade in the West, the woman who may be his equal and the lawman pursing them both.",

        "text": "Maverick is pretty lightweight. It will probably please, though not thrill, undemanding viewers who are fans of the stars.\n\nMay 9, 2023\n\nBrought to you by the actor-director duo (Gibson and Richard Donner) who gave the world the mega-popular Lethal Weapon series, this offers the same winning mix of action and comedy.\n\nMarch 8, 2022\n\nThe script is notionally based on the old television series of the same name, but the screenwriter William Goldman, has produced something depressingly up to date in its incoherence, its crisis of confidence served up with a sickly grin.\n\nNovember 15, 2017\n\nMaverick is quintessential summer fare, an unpretentious no-brainer that relies mostly on the star wattage of Gibson, Foster and old reliable James Garner.\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\n[Maverick] succeeds, just barely, on the good will of its stars and the sumptuousness of its Western locations.\n\nJune 25, 2017\n\nBy the time Donner crowds his climactic poker game with a bevy of veteran Western character actors, decades of movie tradition have been reduced to window dressing, and Maverick leaves you hungry for the real thing.\n\nJune 25, 2017\n\n[Gibson and Garner] can make you smile contentedly even when the script is wandering and they're just sort of standing around waiting for its next good part to develop.\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nMaverick is smart-alecky without being very smart. It's full of spoofy, har-dee-har-har ribaldries -- this film practically winks at you.\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nThis movie doesn't have the wry kick of the TV show at its best. Too rich, too loaded, Maverick may have misplayed its cards, kept its eyes on the pot instead of the players. In movies, as in poker, you can't always trust a pat hand.\n\nAugust 16, 2017"
