        "text": "Richard Donner died yesterday at the age of 91. While still prolific and active behind the scenes, he hadn't directed a feature since the superb 16 Blocks in early 2006. That picture, starring Bruce Willis as an over-the-hill and alcoholic cop who makes a split-second decision to protect a witness from his fellow officers, works as both a character-driven action drama and a proverbial \"final Die Hard movie.\" It wasn't a hit, as even back then, we were starting to see the decline of the non-IP star vehicle. It turned out to be a good curtain call from one of our very best journeyman directors. Donner's legacy is prolific enough that inventing the modern superhero movie is just one line item on a long resume. What's notable, beyond mere talent, offscreen decency and mainstream success, is how he subtly helped shape the pop culture that drives our current nostalgia.\n\nDuring his prime period of fortune and glory, 1976 to 1989, he helmed several films that would invent, perfect, or define many still popular cinematic sub-genres. The Omen wasn't the first \"big horror movie for adults\" of its era. The Exorcist earned a Best Picture nomination and shattered box office records ($193 million domestic) in 1973. But the 1976 chiller, starring Gregory Peck as an ambassador who realizes that his young son may be the anti-Christ, helped define the modern upscale/religious horror movie. The Oscar-winning Jerry Goldsmith score, the over-the-top kills and the still-potent notion of a homicidal cherub helped make The Omen a modern classic. It's so good that when Fox remade it specifically to release it on June 6, 2006, they barely changed a damn thing. Cue a $48 million domestic gross ($211 million adjusted-for-inflation) and the end of \"Damien\" as a popular baby name.\n\nI'm not sure what's left to say about Superman: The Movie. You know that the producers (Alexander and Ilya Salkind) intended to shoot two movies back-to-back, only for Donner to be fired after the first film and replaced by Richard Lester despite 70% of Superman II already in the can. You know that Superman pioneered still-impressive special effects, which allowed then-unknown Christopher Reeve to fly all around Metropolis (and the world). You know the film's structure, with the first third dealing with the origins, the middle offering a super heroic introduction via feats of derring-do and the third act featuring a supervillain plot, became the template for \"part one\" superhero movies like Spider-Man, Batman Begins, Captain America, Wonder Woman and many more. The \"formula\" has also been used to justify any number of failed \"not a superhero\" would-be superhero origin stories, including Salkinds' own Santa Claus: The Movie in 1985.\n\nIt's no secret that I think Hollywood and the film nerd community generally overestimates the mainstream/general audience appeal of Superman. I'd argue he's closer in popularity to \"just because I've heard of this character doesn't mean I want a movie\" IP like Robin Hood and Peter Pan than \"folks will show up again and again\" IP like James Bond and Spider-Man. After all, Superman II, which earned $109 million domestically in 1981, was the last unquestionably successful Superman movie just over 40 years ago. But what if consumer interest in Superman back in 1978 was as much about the sheer quality and gee-whiz appeal (a relentlessly decent superhero in grim post-Watergate America) of Superman: The Movie? What if the very notion of what Superman \"should\" be was explicitly tied to Richard Donner and Christopher Reeves' moral sensibilities? Maybe audiences didn't want Superman movies. Perhaps they just really liked Superman: The Movie.\n\nThe Goonies is perhaps the single most definitive motion picture that comes to mind when folks think of 1980's kid flick nostalgia and Spielbergian pop culture. Nevermind that Spielberg produced but did not direct the YA adventure about five youngsters outwitting comical bad guys while hunting pirate treasure. Spielberg was busy accidentally creating the PG-13 with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and capturing 11 Oscar nominations with The Color Purple. The Goonies didn't invent the 1980's YA fantasy adventure. Still, it arguably came to define it after the fact, even if its specific charms (or demerits, especially to those who would rather define Spielberg by Hook instead of Jaws and Munich) were arguably credited to Spielberg instead of Donner. Anyway, after helping define the adult/religious horror movie, inventing the modern superhero movie and defining the YA adventure, what was next? Well, after Ladyhawke, how about reinventing the American action movie?\n\nLethal Weapon, starring Danny Glover as a family man cop and Mel Gibson as his widowed and suicidal partner, did not invent the buddy cop action movie. Although I'd argue Walter Hill's 48Hrs was a grimdark cop action-drama with a single hilarious character (played by Eddie Murphy) as Nick Nolte's co-lead. Nonetheless, the dynamite action flick, which put Shane Black on the map and turned Gibson into a pop culture icon, is one of three genre-revamping actioners from 1987, alongside John McTiernan's Predator and Paul Verhoeven's Robocop. McTiernan's Die Hard was next summer. Pitting its two traumatized vets against a conspiracy involving drug smuggling within the CIA during (and after) the Vietnam war, Lethal Weapon was less fantastical than the \"alien in the jungle\" movie or the robot cop satire. Those three would revitalize the present-tense Hollywood action movie, but only Lethal Weapon would spawn a successful franchise.\n\nLethal Weapon grossed $65 million domestic in 1987. Yet while the various sequels to Robocop and Predator would stumble, Lethal Weapon 2, a bigger, funnier and (depending on your preferences) arguably better action comedy parlayed earned goodwill over the first film and Gibson's increased star profile into a ridiculous $147 million domestic. During the same summer which Ghostbusters II made less than half ($109 million) of its $220 million-grossing predecessor and where Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade ($197 million) still fell short of Raiders of the Lost Ark ($242 million), Lethal Weapon 2 more than doubled its predecessor. This wasn't Rambo: First Blood Part II or Terminator 2, mega-bucks blockbusters that were significant events outside of whether you had seen First Blood or The Terminator. This was \"just another Lethal Weapon movie,\" taking the kind of leap we would rarely see again until the Captain America trilogy and John Wick.\n\nWhile Lethal Weapon mostly kept its politics merely implicit, Lethal Weapon 2 began a quasi-trend of Donner being pretty damn upfront about his bleeding-heart liberal sensibilities. Lethal Weapon 2 featured South African diplomats who murdered with impunity and were very much in favor of apartheid. Oh, and we learned about how tuna fishing was terrible because fishers would (allegedly) kill the dolphins that got caught in the nets. Lethal Weapon 3 dealt with corrupt cops exploiting inner-city violence to sell black market guns and couldn't have been more explicit about its \"gun control good, systemic racism which leads to street violence bad\" messaging. Lethal Weapon 4 explicitly tied the debate over illegal immigration to the anti-slavery abolitionist movements. That's not to say they are great movies. However, Donner sits alongside James Cameron as one of two unapologetic liberals excelling in a stereotypically conservative genre during a famously conservative time.\n\nScrooged, a darkly comic riff on Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol marked Bill Murray's comeback following a post-Ghostbusters vacation. It worked as a \"first Christmas Carol\" for a generation of kids growing up in Regan's America. I can vouch for Maverick (featuring one of Mel Gibson's best star performances and a hilarious against-type turn from Jodie Foster) and the aforementioned 16 Blocks. I will admit the (heavily compromised) Michael Crichton adaptation Timeline didn't do much for me. Plenty of folks liked Radio Flyer, Conspiracy Theory (a late-90's thriller teaming Gibson and Julia Roberts) and Assassins (teaming Sylvester Stallone with a white-hot Antonio Banderas via an early Wachowski siblings screenplay) more than I. But if Lethal Weapon 2 marked the end of Donner as a directorial pop culture giant, he and his wife Lauren Donner still had some tricks up their sleeves as producers.\n\nSimon Wincer's Free Willy spawned a franchise and became shorthand for \"save the animal\" movies. The Lost Boys, Joel Schumacher's \"cool teen vampires in small-town California\" flick, sits alongside The Goonies as the other side of the 80's nostalgia coin. The Donners were hands-on producers for Bryan Singer's X-Men. That game-changing hit ($299 million on a $75 million budget) revitalized the comic book superhero movie after a decade of post-Batman commercial misses (Dick Tracy, The Rocketeer, The Shadow, The Phantom, all copying Batman's pulp era sensibilities.). While X-Men doesn't take its narrative structure from Superman (its \"newbie gets introduced to an already existing team\" template worked for Rise of the Guardians and G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra), the film's present-tense setting and use of heroes that were popular to \"today's\" kids seemed to be at least as inspired by Superman as, say, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\n\nThe Omen remains among the best \"prestige horror movies for grown-ups,\" along with being a touchtone for religious horror and \"evil kid\" chillers. Superman: The Movie, with plenty of help from Tom Mankiewicz, invented the modern superhero movie and provided a pinpoint narrative structure for the \"hero's journey\" blockbuster. The Goonies remains a defining pop culture time capsule for 1980's kid-friendly cinema, even if its strengths and flaws are more attributed to the man who produced it (Steven Spielberg) than its director. Lethal Weapon helped revitalize the American present-tense action movie. It perfected the oft-copied buddy cop formula, while Lethal Weapon 2 was as groundbreaking a blockbuster sequel as Rambo: First Blood Part II and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Even Scrooged was an ahead-of-its-time as both a satire of and an excellent example of sentimental, feel-good holiday movies. That is an incredible under-the-radar cultural legacy.\n\nDonner had an unassuming persona and reputation for both workhorse sensibilities and offscreen decency. His essential movies weren't just modern genre classics. They implicitly and subtly proved as inspirational and aspirational to the pop culture landscape and related nostalgia as (offhand) Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Tim Burton, James Cameron and Robert Zemeckis. Yet, I would argue his unshowy persona and lack of easily identifiable \"trademarks\" (beyond general optimism alongside comparatively progressive politics) was part of what made him less of a big-deal filmmaker over the last 20 years. Even big-budget, franchise-specific blockbuster movies seem to prioritize (for better or worse) the buzz from established \"auteurs\" or indie darlings over an Andrew Davis or a Jon Turteltaub (there's a reason The Meg worked as nuts-and-bolts, well-oiled Hollywood entertainment). He wasn't a film school-friendly auteur with a flashy personality. Richard Donner was just an unquestionably talented and enviably skilled filmmaker who directed some of your favorite movies."
