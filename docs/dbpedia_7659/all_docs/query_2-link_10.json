        "text": "Over his six-decade career, Richard Donner made movies that endured. With Superman, he ushered in the modern superhero film. With The Goonies, he redefined childhood adventure. He worked across genres, always using the word “verisimilitude” as his mantra; he maintained that the key to a great film was to be truthful, honor the source material, and take it seriously. If a character happened to be able to fly, so be it.\n\nAnd to think that Donner almost didn’t become a director. When he was starting out as a young bit actor, he once recalled, filmmaker Martin Ritt told him: “You can’t take direction. You ought to be a director.” The rest was history. Academy members, including Edgar Wright, Kevin Smith, and Josh Gad, have all paid tribute to the film legend, who died this week at 91. Steven Spielberg called him “the greatest Goonie of all.”\n\nIf you’re new to Richard Donner’s work, or if you’ve seen the entire Lethal Weapon series more than once, it’s always a good idea to revisit the classics."
