        "text": "I took a quick snap of the disc purchases from the last month or so. Looking at them it looked a little curious, the spread of them- six Blu-rays, six 4K UHD so an even split on formats, there’s a few noir, a few westerns, a television show that I couldn’t (well ok, wouldn’t, paywall and all that) watch on streaming, and a few releases of old films I like/ have watched before. The 4K steelbook of The Green Knight was triggered by a sale on Amazon. I surprised myself by buying the deluxe edition of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, its not a film I’m particularly fond of. I bought a copy on R1 DVD back in that formats early days when I used to import loads of stuff, but it frankly disturbed me so much I only watched it once, maybe twice. But there you go- trust Second Sight to pull me back in. Its a nice set but the book is not as definitive as the one that came with their Dawn of the Dead release, I’d have preferred more variation in the choice of essays/writing, some focus on merchandising maybe or video releases over the years. But certainly as far as the film is concerned, this set is the final word. Five commentaries though: what’s the chance I’ll even manage to get through even one?\n\nHad a surprise yesterday when Amazon delivered the 4K UHD of Superman II a little early. Does me no favours, I intended to give the 4K disc of Superman: The Movie a rewatch first and didn’t manage to fit it in yet. Is that ridiculously anal of me to want to watch the first film again before watching this one? Its not as if I need to jog my memory or anything. I’m actually considering giving the theatrical cut of Superman II a go first, before the Donner cut, to refresh my memory as regards the changes between the two, but frankly I’m a bit daunted regards finding the time to do that. Its like commentary tracks, I love the idea of sitting down for them and taking them in but time always gets in the way; but alternate cuts of movies? There’s a few on that Dawn of the Dead release that are still waiting….\n\nSo anyway, all this about time brings me to this rather lacklustre list of what I watched this past week. Its all about the reality of how much of a time sink televisions shows are when there’s only so much free time around.\n\n51. All Quiet on the Western Front (2022) – Netflix\n\nStation Eleven (2021/2022), Episodes 2-10 – 4K UHD\n\nThe Last of Us Season One (2023), Episodes 2 -3\n\nStar Trek Picard Season Three (2023) Episode 9- Amazon Prime\n\nThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1973) – 4K UHD\n\nAll of the above results in my Best/Worst of the week section being as redundant as ever (restricted, as it is, to being just ‘new’ films – isn’t that a decision that’s biting me on the a–). By default the ‘best of’ the week is the most recent remake of All Quiet on the Western Front – maybe it should qualify as the worst of the week also, as goodness knows I had issues with it.\n\nStar Trek Picard nears it grand finale thank goodness. I’ve actually been writing a post about the show, an episode guide of sorts, and am waiting for the last episodes to land so that I can complete it. I was shouting at the screen again at the sheer stupidity of the ninth episode (have a guess how many people it takes to build a Galaxy-class starship). So, er, no its not very good. The series showed promise at times, it was fun seeing the old TNG gang slowly get together again, but as usual the writers clearly never had a decent plan. They seem to even ignore their own continuity/mythology, never mind that of the decades-long franchise as a whole: its even like last year’s season two of this show never happened (sure, we’d all like to think that but hey, they were the showrunners themselves so they have no excuse). Are writers these days so accustomed to multiverses and various timelines that they just go lazy and wing it? Maybe the tenth and finale episode can save the day, but I doubt it.\n\nNext week, either I’ll take a break from television and get on with some movies, or I’ll plunge back into For All Mankind with its second season. Which reminds me, I’ve yet to post a review of its first season! There it is again: Time. Makes me wonder how I managed to see over fifty ‘new’ films by mid-April…\n\nWhile reading through an old issue of Cinefantastique the other day (the Forbidden Planet double-issue, from Spring 1979, I assume) I came across a capsule review of Richard Donner’s Superman: The Movie which I hadn’t noticed before, and which, while I’m accustomed to the somewhat po-faced attitude of that mag’s editorials, quite took me aback. With due deference to its writer Robert Stewart, I quote the following:\n\n“The film fails to explore the possibilities of having a new and modernized Superman tackle the real problems of the world in the late 1970s- assassinations, mass suicides, mindf–kers, famine, the CIA, sexism, racism, provocateurs, ageism, unemployment and economic collapse, corporate takeovers, bureaucratic psychopaths, etc. Instead, he confronts villains not much different from those of the Batman television show…”\n\nMy initial thoughts were that this guy probably loved Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel and Batman v. Superman: his review seems more a manifesto for Snyder’s films than anything to do with Richard Donner’s film (clearly Donner’s respectful approach to the original comicbooks went right over Mr Stewarts head). It’s one of those reviews which criticises a film more for what it is not, than what it is.\n\nBut it did set me thinking, which was probably the point of the review (so bravo, Mr Stewart, wherever you are now). I’ve noted elsewhere that I’ve really not been a fan of the recent Spiderman films and much of this -and it applies to all three ‘versions’ of the character, the Tobey Maguire films, the Andrew Garfield films and Tom Holland’s films- is simply that none of them have really captured what I loved as a kid growing up reading the 1960s/1970s Spiderman comics by Stan Lee, Steve Ditko, John Romita, Gerry Conway and Ross Andru. They are perfectly fine films as they are (well, to varying degree anyway) but none of them capture the characters and mood/spirit of those comics, so its inevitable that, for me, they are lacking something. They are probably more faithful to the comics of the past twenty years (that I have never read, although I did read part of the J. Michael Straczynski run of Spiderman comics drawn by John Romita jr. which are likely indicative) which is fine, and I should maybe give them the benefit of the doubt there. But my question is, am I being fair? Is it a case though of me disliking films more for what they are not than what they are?\n\nWell, not exactly. I do think there are very real issues with the various films; retconning bad guys to be more sympathetic victims of misfortune than genuine villains is one of my pet peeves, likewise I utterly detest all the various Spidey suits of the Tom Holland films, all that nano-tech/Iron Man rubbish, all that metal arms out the back etc that defy reason, physics and gravity. That’s not any kind of Spiderman I want, just further evidence of the Marvel films increasingly playing fast and loose with comics canon etc (as far as I know, as it could be something featured in the comics, but I doubt it). Likewise some of the writing feels pretty dire, with some fairly shocking leaps of logic, but that’s something evident in much film and television now; the talent pool is pretty weak now because there is just so much content being produced across film/television streaming etc. And yeah, in defence of writers, maybe its all those producers and executive producers interfering with the material- some films and shows I see now have as many as twenty and more producer credits, and I often wonder if the time will come when the number of producer credits will outnumber that of the cast.\n\nI won’t even watch The Eternals; Jack Kirby’s 1970s comicbooks are amongst my very favourites. They possibly haven’t aged very well in some ways, but they were so bold and imaginative, full of the Chariots of the Gods stuff that excited me so much as a kid and was quite popular in that decade. The film, from what I have seen of it in trailers, has nothing in common with those comicbooks other than name (to be more faithful to Kirby’s work, it surely should have looked and felt more akin to 2017s Thor: Ragnarok film, which really captured the feel of a Kirby strip). I do know Neil Gaiman wrote a reboot/continuation and suspect the film has more in common with that than original creator Jack Kirby’s opus but I may be giving the film too much credit even there. Maybe I’ll get to watch it eventually but certainly I have little if any interest in it; the film was made to be something else, not something faithful to the original comics, and that’s surely true of much current Marvel Studios output.\n\nWhich is true, indeed, of what Disney is doing with Star Wars. They are making Star Wars tv shows and movies that are increasingly removed from the original film trilogy I grew up with, and they are as much not ‘my Star Wars’ as anything Marvel Studios films and tv shows are- and the same is true of the current crop of Star Trek tv shows. That being said though, some of these shows, certainly the Star Trek stuff that I have watched, are really woeful, regardless of how ‘faithful’ they aren’t in spirit and subject. The second season of Star Trek: Picard is especially diabolically poor, an absolute nadir for the Star Trek franchise.\n\nMind, even Star Trek: Discovery and Star Trek: Picard have their fans, I suppose, although those viewers must be especially forgiving of terrible writing, huge plotholes, leaps of logic (and illogic). Indeed I think the shows are fundamentally unforgivable in how crass and stupid they are, and seem to have been written by soap opera and tv sitcom writers rather than anyone actually skilled or knowledgeable of both science fiction or indeed the particular franchise canon (I can’t help but feel this is largely true of the Star Wars and Marvel stuff too, and I don’t know if this is from laziness, ignorance or simply an intent to strike off to pastures new on the back of established IP).\n\nThank goodness Blade Runner 2049 was sincere and respectful of the original film and extended upon the 1982 original film’s themes and mood thoughtfully, rather than just go the other, easier way, instead making a film about with a Roy Batty Mk.II or an action-based film about a new Blade Runner battling Nexus 7 or Nexus 8 improved, nastier Replicants. After all, it could have been, easily- look how generic the Terminator films became. I may not live to see any more Blade Runner movies, but at least I don’t have to witness what happened with Alien, its Lovecraftian alien creatures turned into spacesuit wearing bald guys in Ridley Scott’s ill-judged Prometheus. The more I think back on Prometheus, the more it actually seems a story about Space Gods akin to Jack Kirby’s 1976 Eternals comics repurposed to fit within the Alien franchise in order to get made (I can well imagine Ridley wanting to make a high-concept Space Gods movie and having to sell it as an Alien movie in order to get it greenlit).\n\nWhich I suppose means I should remain absolutely fearful regards that Blade Runner tv series which Ridley is producing. Maybe my luck is going to run out; and certainly, I will feel much more aggrieved regards something spoiling my appreciation and adoration of the 1982 film than I am by some Spiderman film not really being the web-slinger that thrilled me when I was seven years old.\n\n2017.24: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 (Cinema)\n\nI have to say, I found this sequel to be far superior to the original film. Other than the funky soundtrack of classic 70s songs and some of its quirky characters, I really didn’t understand all the fuss about the first film. The bad guy was generic at best, banal at worst, and confusingly undermined by having Thanos shoehorned in to ensure the ‘Marvel Universe’ continuity running through all these movies. In fact, the whole thing seemed confusing and unfocused, complete with its obligatory cgi-fest spectacle finale that had no real drama at all. I make it sound like a trainwreck. It really wasn’t, but neither was it the triumphant comicbook movie it seems universally touted to be. Fresher maybe, I’ll give you that, after so many ‘traditional’ Marvel movies…\n\nSo anyway, I was actually rather nonplussed about watching this at the cinema but finally did so. I’m so glad I did, as it was a thoroughly engaging and enjoyable experience. It was great. It had drama, emotion, focus, character arcs… yes it had spectacle and comedy and lots of rock songs, but… it was great fun. It had a surprising amount of darkness, too (the idea of Star Lord’s Celestial father impregnating hundreds/thousands of aliens with his seed only to destroy his ‘failed’ offspring every time is, well, pretty disturbing) which when I think back on it, just gets darker. I left the cinema with that buzz you only get when you’ve had a really good time with a great movie. I even stuck around to enjoy the end credits, admiring the 1970s graphics as much as the in-joke video segments and the usual added mid & post-credits scenes.\n\nYeah, it was a good time, and great fun. And so much better than the first film it really, really surprised me.\n\nIndeed, the film may even manage that trick of informing its predecessor- there are a number of revelations and character points in Vol.2 that impact on moments in Vol.1 that have me reaching for that blu-ray. The two films are, in a clever way, a two-part origin story for Star Lord himself, reinforcing each other in a way that reminds me of Richard Donner’s Superman: The Movie and Superman II (at least, how they should have turned out without producer interference).\n\nWe even get another Howard the Duck cameo. That guy really has to have his own movie someday. Meanwhile, I’m actually looking forward to the eventual Vol.3."
