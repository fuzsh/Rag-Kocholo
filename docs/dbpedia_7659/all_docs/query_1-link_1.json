        "text": "A former off-Broadway actor who began directing commercials and industrial films in the late 1950s, Richard Donner went on to become one of the top-grossing directors in the 1970s and 1980s before tapering off later in his career. After directing numerous episodes of top shows like \"The Twilight Zone\" (CBS, 1959-1964), \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" (NBC, 1964-68) and \"Kojak\" (CBS, 1973-78), Donner achieved critical and commercial success with his genre-defining horror movie, \"The Omen\" (1976), widely considered to be the best of its kind. He followed up with the epic \"Superman: The Movie\" (1978), which, after a difficult production that resulted in his firing while shooting \"Superman II\" (1980), became a huge box office hit while setting the bar for all other comic book-based movies to follow. After a few critical and financial flops like \"Inside Moves\" (1980) and \"The Toy\" (1982), Donner directed the cult favorite adventure, \"The Goonies\" (1985), before breaking the mold again - this time in the buddy action genre - with \"Lethal Weapon\" (1987), which spawned three sequels over the next decade. Throughout his career, Donner remained a true original that fans and colleagues held in high regard."
