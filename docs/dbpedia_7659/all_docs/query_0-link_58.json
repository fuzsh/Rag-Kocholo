        "text": "In 1951, an aspiring and ambitious young actor named Richard Donner played a small part in a TV production of “Of Human Bondage” (in the series “Somerset Maugham TV Theatre”). Although he had only a few lines to say, he ran into a little argument with director Martin Ritt who told him, “Your problem is that you can’t take direction, you ought to be a director,” and Mr. Ritt made him his assistant on the show. “Martin Ritt changed my life. He put me on the road that I’m on now, and he made my life extremely complete,” Mr. Donner says now, looking back to what happened to him sixty-five years ago. Ultimately, he became one of the screen’s most successful filmmakers of the past half a century—give or take a few years.\n\nAfter working for television, directing episodes of several top TV series in the 1960s, including working with Loretta Young in “Letter to Loretta” (1961) and Steve McQueen in his breakthrough role in “Wanted: Dead or Alive” (1961), and directing other successful series such as “The Twilight Zone” (1964), “The Man from U.N.C.L.E.” (1964), “Get Smart” (1965), “The Fugitive” (1966), “Cade’s County” (1971), “Kojak” (1973) and “The Streets from San Francisco” (1974), he got his break when Alan Ladd, Jr., head of 20th Century Fox at the time, only wanted to make “The Omen” (1976) with Mr. Donner directing the picture. “Then I realized that my television days were over,” he remembers.\n\nWhat happened then is screen history. Mr. Donner, born Richard Donald Schwartzberg in the Bronx in 1930, made screen classics such as “Superman” (1978), bringing the characters of Clark Kent/Superman back to the screen after many years of absence; he brought us the lively adventures of “The Goonies” (1985), launched the highly successful series of four “Lethal Weapons” movies (1987-1998) with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. He cast Bill Murray in “Scrooged” (1988), a hip and funny version of Charles Dickens’s ‘A Christmas Carol’. Mr. Donner, considered to be one of Hollywood’s most reliable producers-directors of action blockbusters, as well as being a truly remarkable genius when it comes to handling incredible, precious little gems like “Inside Moves” (1980) or “Radio Flyer” (1992), is one of the most versatile veteran filmmakers who can handle various genres very successfully.\n\nAfter working for television for so many years, though, he was Hollywood’s newest discovery almost overnight after “The Omen” (1976) was released. Who knows what his career would have been like if he would have been able to start making such prestigious film projects a decade earlier. We’ll never know, but what we do know is that it is typical for almost any Donner film that the lines are around the block once his films are out in the theaters. It’s almost his trademark.\n\nTalking to Mr. Donner, allowing me some of his time only a few days before he turned 86, makes you realize the importance and the incredible value of his films and his passion for his craft all the more. Upbeat, positive, kind-hearted, and supportive all the way through, and with the experience and expertise of a lifetime behind the camera as one of the leading filmmakers in the Emerald City, it’s no secret he likes to feel good by the end of a movie. “The more you work with him, the more you see him as a kid in a candy store. With his infectious laugh, you just want to follow him everywhere,” Christopher Reeve once said. With Mr. Donner adding, “If you want to be depressed, you can always watch the news.” This sums it up pretty much: just like no one else ever portrayed the character of Superman any better, or more beautifully than Christopher Reeve did in the first two “Superman” films (“I made two too many,” he later stated on BBC television, referring to the third and fourth episodes he made in 1983 and 1987), it all seems pretty logical why his films do so well: his love for people, for life, and the movies, along with his youthful exuberance and his passion for storytelling, make it an inspiring experience to watch his entire body of work.\n\nThirty years ago, Mr. Donner married Lauren Shuler. She became one of the top producers ever in the American film industry and frequently collaborated with Mr. Donner. The Donners’ Company, based in Los Angeles, is their production company. She is the driving force behind the “X-Men” films which she and her husband launched in 2000. The latest film in the series—a series which has dominated the box office for the past fifteen years—is called “X-Men: Apocalypse.” The film stars Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrence, and Michael Fassbender, and it will be out this month.\n\nMr. Donner, you have always been a very creative director. You also worked on a lot of successful TV series in the sixties. Do you feel you were creatively restricted since you couldn’t change the characters that had been going for years?\n\nThat was always a problem and usually the reason why I got fired: I wanted to introduce something new. After all, why did they hire you? Maybe for a new look or a new feeling, but in the end, they preferred it the way they had originated it. So every time I wanted to change something, I found myself being fired.\n\nAfter working for many years for television, I suppose “The Omen” [1976], which put you on the map immediately, was the turning point in your career?\n\nYes, that’s right. You know, the script had been turned down by most of the studios, and when the idea of taking it from a horror film and—into my mind—turning it into a mystery suspense thriller, that all of a sudden gave it a moment of class. So yes, I had the opportunity to make the changes I wanted, and I just had to find out if I was right or wrong. We were lucky enough to get Gregory Peck and Lee Remick to play the leading roles, which validated the story. When the film came out and was very successful, I was the new kid on the block.\n\nYour desire to make the changes you want, is that maybe the essence of your approach? Christopher Reeve once said about you: ‘I think that what makes Dick such a unique director, are two things, his desire to enable his co-workers to do their best, and a real innocence about the story, so that he can look at it from an audience’s point of view and say, ‘Tell me the story.” Would you consider that a good definition of your approach?\n\nThat’s very nice; I never heard that before. And yes, very much so. You think you are making a movie for yourself, but in reality, you’re making it for the audience: that’s your responsibility.\n\nHow do you look back to “Superman” [1978] and how important was Christopher Reeve to the success of the film?\n\nWell, the whole picture really was on his shoulders because the audience had to believe this character—he had to portray two roles—and in doing so, it was really Jules and Jim. Here you had Clark Kent; he had feelings for Lois Lane [played by Margot Kidder], while she had it for the character of Superman. What a role to play for a young actor. If that didn’t come off, you would never have a movie. That was more important than flying. As far as Christopher Reeve is concerned, I honestly don’t think anybody could have played that role the way he did. I don’t think anyone will ever come along and play it like he played it; he was a very special individual, a great person, a great friend, loving and devoted, with a wonderful sense of humor. And he also made my career. I think about him an awful lot.\n\nYou made several box office hit movies, but in between, you also took the time to make more intimate films like “Inside Moves” [1980] or “Radio Flyer” [1992]. Is that also a favorite genre of yours?\n\nTruthfully, yes. Those are the pictures I would like to have made more of, even though it was a difficult time getting those made. When these other films came along, like the “Lethal Weapons”, you were involved with the characters; you cared about them. But if I could have gone on and made mostly relationship films, I would have, but especially at that time, it was really tough to get them made.\n\nWhat would you consider your major quality as a film director?\n\nI don’t really know; I think it is working with actors. Having been an actor, trying hard, realizing all the insecurities, the need for assistance and assurance, I think I would say I have a sensitivity to the actors and their problems. I know how insecure I can be as a director, and for actors, it must be ten times harder because everything surrounds them all the time. So I think my relationships with them are pretty good.\n\nIs that why you always get to work with the biggest stars in the business, like Mel Gibson, Julia Roberts, Jodie Foster, Julianne Moore, Gene Hackman, Marlon Brando, etc.?\n\nNo, because you get to work with them before they know who you are. They may know your name or the films you made, but you don’t really get to build a relationship until you’re actually filming. So in those cases, you’re very committed to working with these people, but it’s during the process of filmmaking that the relationships work out. With every one of the people that you’ve mentioned, they worked out very well.\n\nWhat would you consider your proudest achievement so far?\n\nMarrying my producer-wife [Lauren Shuler Donner]. That’s my biggest achievement. Everything involves the talent of my wife; we have a great relationship. She’s a genius in creating projects, and I adore working with her. She’s built our production company more than I have. She still does it, continues doing it, and loves it. She’s the best.\n\nWhat has been your most challenging film to make?\n\nProbably “The Goonies” [1985]. I loved doing it, but it was incredibly difficult with all these little kids who were non-professionals, keeping them together and in line… Technically, of course, “Superman” was by far the most difficult, but technically, it’s not that important as the emotion and getting everything out of those kids. It was a wonderful dream and a horrible nightmare.\n\nWhat about Steven Spielberg, who produced “The Goonies”?\n\nHe’s a great guy, a close friend, and I was privileged to get a call from him and hear him saying, ‘Dick, I’m going to send you a script, it’s called “The Goonies”.’ When I had read it, I called him back and said, ‘I love it, but why did you pick me? Why aren’t you directing it?’ He said, ‘Well, I can’t, because I am doing another one. And why do I ask you? Because you’re as big as a kid as I am, or maybe bigger.’ Since then, we just had a great relationship; it was a great experience working with him, just to see how fertile his mind is. Amazing.\n\nWhat’s the first thing that comes to your mind when you think of your collaboration with Marlon Brando in “Superman”? Was he easy to work with, and did he improvise a lot?\n\nMarlon Brando did stick to the script pretty much, but when he had an idea, you just let him do it—after all, he was Marlon Brando. When it was over, we sat down, and ninety-nine percent of the time, it was just perfect. He was an amazing human being, not only as an actor; he stood up to the world, and spoke out whenever he wanted. So he did improvise, but most of the time, it came from an actor who knew what he was doing and was living the character he was playing. What came out of him was very honest.\n\nDid he use a specific acting style when he did his scenes?\n\nHe wanted to do his scenes fresh the first time. He said, ‘I’m an actor, and the first time I read something and do it before the camera, I want it to be me. If I do it over and over again, I’m rethinking, and then my instincts are gone.’\n\nHow do you respond when you don’t get a scene right?\n\nIf it’s during the day when you’re shooting it, you still have the opportunity to make changes. But when it’s too late—you’re in your car driving home, or you think about it in the middle of the night—and you realize what you should have done, then you think, ‘Oh my God, am I not qualified to do the job?’ But those are the moments that you learn about filmmaking, and you never, ever, stop learning. Most of those moments happen when you don’t trust your instincts or when you’re under pressure.\n\n“16 Blocks” [2006] with Bruce Willis was your latest film as a director so far. In the meantime, you have always been very busy producing. Would you consider directing again?\n\nYes, I’m writing a sequel picture right now. Whether it happens or not, I don’t know. Everybody wants to do it, and I’d say, I got to get it done. It’s “The Goonies 2” I’m talking about. It has such a great history; it has carried on in America for over thirty years as one of the top family films of the country. It’s a tradition we have to keep up to. So we’re working on it, slowly but steady. We’re also doing a theater version of “The Goonies,” which will open in New York, hopefully within a year or a year and a half. “Goonies” is a part of my life, and it’s a part that I love.\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nApril 21, 2016\n\n+ Mr. Donner passed away in Los Angeles on July 5, 2021, at age 91.\n\n“The Goonies” (1985, trailer)\n\nFILMS\n\nSALT AND PEPPER (1968) DIR Richard Donner PROD Milton Ebbins SCR Michael Pertwee CAM Ken Higgins MUS John Dankworth ED Jack Slade CAST Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, Michael Bates, Ilona Rodgers, John Le Mesurier, Graham Stark\n\nTWINKY (1970) DIR Richard Donner PROD Clive Sharp SCR Norman Thaddeus Vane (also story) CAM Walter Lassally MUS John Scott ED Norman Wantsall CAST Charles Bronson, Orson Beam, Honor Blackman, Michael Craig, Paul Ford, Jack Hawkins, Trevor Howard, Lionel Jeffries, Robert Morley, Susan George, Jill Ireland\n\nTHE OMEN (1976) DIR Richard Donner PROD Harvey Bernhard SCR David Seltzer CAM Gilbert Taylor MUS Jerry Goldsmith ED Stuart Baird CAST Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner, Billie Whitelaw, Harvey Stephens, Patrick Throughton, Martin Benson, Robert Rietty\n\nSUPERMAN (1978) DIR Richard Donner PROD Pierre Spengler, Richard Lester [uncredited] SCR Mario Puzo, Robert Benton, David Newman, Leslie Newman (story by Mario Puzo; characters created by Jerry Siegel, Joe Shuster) CAM Geoffrey Unsworth MUS John Williams ED Stuart Baird, Michael Ellis CAST Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, Marlon Brando, Ned Beatty, Jackie Cooper, Glenn Ford, Trevor Howard, Valerie Perrine, Maria Schell, Terence Stamp, Susannah York, Larry Hagman, John Ratzenberger, Richard Donner\n\nSUPERMAN II (1980) DIR Richard Lester, Richard Donner [uncredited] PROD Pierre Spengler SCR Mario Puzo, David Newman, Leslie Newman (story by Mario Puzo; characters created by Jerry Siegel, Joe Shuster) CAM Bob Paynter, Geoffrey Unsworth MUS Ken Thorne ED John Victor-Smith CAST Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty, Jackie Cooper, Valerie Perrine, Susannah York, Clifton James, E.G.
