        "text": "Prolific Hollywood director and producer Richard Donner, who helmed the original Superman, Lethal Weapon, and The Goonies, has died at age 91. His wife and producing partner, Lauren Shuler Donner, and Warner Bros. confirmed Donner passed away on Monday. No cause of death has been revealed.\n\nBorn in the Bronx, Donner began his storied, five-decades-long career in television, directing a bevy of classic shows from the ’60s including Route 66, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., Gilligan’s Island, Perry Mason, The Wild Wild West, and The Twilight Zone episode “Nightmare at 20,000 Feet,” starring William Shatner. In 1961, he directed his first feature film, X-15, starring Charles Bronson and featuring then newcomer Mary Tyler Moore. His big break in the film industry came with 1976’s horror film The Omen, starring Gregory Peck, David Warner, and Lee Remick, which became the fifth highest grossing film of the year.\n\nDonner followed up this success by directing Superman: The Movie, starring Margot Kidder, Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty, and relatively unknown Christopher Reeve as the titular Man of Steel. At that point, Superman was the most expensive film ever made with a budget of $55 million. Superman soared, grossing over $300 million at the box office, garnering three Oscar nominations (and winning a special Academy Award for its visual effects), and launching Reeve into superstardom.\n\nDonner continued to make hit films into the 1980s, directing the iconic children’s movie The Goonies, the Bill Murray Christmas Carol redux Scrooged, and the first Lethal Weapon film, spawning a successful franchise in the process. In 2006, Donner directed his last film, 16 Blocks, starring Bruce Willis.\n\n“Dick had such a powerful command of his movies, and was so gifted across so many genres,” said Steven Spielberg in a statement. “Being in his circle was akin to hanging out with your favorite coach, smartest professor, fiercest motivator, most endearing friend, staunchest ally, and—of course—the greatest Goonie of all. He was all kid. All heart. All the time. I can’t believe he’s gone, but his husky, hearty laugh will stay with me always.”\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n— An Exclusive Deep Dive Into Peter Jackson’s The Beatles: Get Back\n\n— Joseph Fiennes on His Handmaid’s Tale Fate\n\n— The 10 Best Movies of 2021 (So Far)\n\n— Jane Levy on the Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist Cancellation\n\n— Is Luca Pixar’s First Gay Movie?\n\n— How Physical Got Under Rose Byrne’s Skin\n\n— What Is Bo Burnham’s Inside Really Trying to Say?\n\n— Simu Liu Is Ready to Take On Marvel\n\n— From the Archive: Jackie and Joan Collins, Queens of the Road\n\n— Sign up for the “HWD Daily” newsletter for must-read industry and awards coverage—plus a special weekly edition of “Awards Insider.”\n\nMovies\n\nReintroducing Humphrey Bogart: The Untold Stories of a Hollywood Icon’s Volatile Private Life\n\nThe Casablanca star’s career was shaped by his relationships with women, from his distant mother to the love of his life, Lauren Bacall.
