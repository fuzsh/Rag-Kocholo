        "text": "RIP. In addition to the movies in the headlines, he also directed Ladyhawke, Radio Flyer, and Scrooged with Bill Murray. Not to mention the Twilight Zone episode with William Shatner in the airplane and (as I just learned just now while verifying that last fact) the Danger Island segment of the Banana Splits show, go figure.\n\nI know I always perked up at seeing his name since I loved Superman II so much.\n\nLet’s see,\n\nLoved: Superman II, Ladyhawke, Lethal Weapon 3\n\nReally Liked: Lethal Weapon, Lethal Weapon 2, Lethal Weapon 4, Maverick, Conspiracy Theory (Mel Gibson & Julia Roberts)\n\nMeh: Superman\n\nDidn’t like: The Goonies, Assassins (Stallone and Antonio Bandaras) (thought we got a great gif out of that one)\n\nHaven’t seen: The Rest.\n\nLove his work. I don’t know how to describe it other than to say that he deeply understood moviegoers.\n\nSay what you will, I’m glad Patty Jenkins gets him. His interview of her for DGA was one of my favorites. As seen from the Screening Room essay, it was as much about Superman as Wonder Woman.\n\nI had no idea he directed that Twilight Zone episode. I honestly thought that was a mistake and he actually did the segment of the movie or something(turns out that was George Miller). What a career!\n\nI’ve been watching the Darkseid plot line in the DCAU. There’s a scene in The Death of Superman where Clark is fighting Doomsday and he runs into Lois. Lois helps him stand and says, “I’ve got you.” Superman responds, “You’ve got me, but who’s got you?”\n\nAmbitious long takes are still a thing, though maybe not so much in superhero movies. Of course, '70s long takes are both ambitious and usually not egotistical. See also this amazing shot by Alan Pakula and the great Gordon Willis in All the President’s Men. I think it was basically the key inspiration for that whole ‘Homecoming’ TV series from a couple years back…"
