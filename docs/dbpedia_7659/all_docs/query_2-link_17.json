        "text": "Richard Donner (born Richard Donald Schwartzberg; April 24, 1930 – July 5, 2021) was an American filmmaker whose notable works included some of the most financially-successful films during the New Hollywood era. According to film historian Michael Barson, Donner was \"one of Hollywood's most reliable makers of action blockbusters\". His career spanned over 50 years, crossing multiple genres and filmmaking trends.\n\nDonner began his career in 1957 as a television director. In the 1960s, Donner directed episodes of the series The Rifleman, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Fugitive, The Twilight Zone, The Banana Splits, and many others. He made his film debut with the low-budget aviation drama X-15 in 1961, but had his critical and commercial breakthrough with the horror film The Omen in 1976. He directed the landmark superhero film Superman in 1978, which provided an inspiration for the fantasy film genre to eventually gain artistic respectability and commercial dominance. Donner later went on to direct films in the 1980s such as The Goonies and Scrooged, while reinvigorating the buddy cop film genre with the Lethal Weapon series.\n\nDonner and his wife Lauren owned their production company The Donners' Company (formerly Donner/Shuler Donner Productions), best known for co- executive producing the Free Willy and X-Men franchises. Donner also produced the Tales from the Crypt television series and co-wrote several comic books for Superman publisher DC Comics. In 2000, Donner received the President's Award from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films.\n\nEarly years\n\nRichard Donald Schwartzberg was born in the Bronx, New York City, to Russian Jewish parents, Hattie (Horowitz) and Fred Schwartzberg. His father owned a small furniture-manufacturing business and his mother was a stay at home mother. He had a sister, Joan. His grandfather owned a movie theatre in Brooklyn, which had an early influence on his perception of film.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Donner served in the U.S. Navy, becoming an aerial photographer. He briefly attended New York University but left to pursue a career in acting, relocating to Los Angeles and adopting the stage name \"Richard Donner\".\n\nTelevision\n\nInitially, Donner wanted to develop a career as an actor. He gained a bit part in a television program directed by Martin Ritt, who encouraged Donner to become a director instead. Ritt hired Donner as his assistant. Later, Donner was on the staff of Desilu, where he directed commercials. He made the transition into television dramas in the late 1950s, directing some episodes of the Steve McQueen western serial Wanted Dead or Alive and the Chuck Connors western The Rifleman.\n\nDuring his early career as a director he worked on over twenty-five television series, including Have Gun – Will Travel, The Fugitive, Combat!, Get Smart, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Wild Wild West, Gilligan's Island, Kojak, and The Twilight Zone (such as the episodes \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\" starring William Shatner and \"From Agnes—With Love\" starring Wally Cox), as well as the serial Danger Island from the children's program The Banana Splits.\n\nIn the 1990s, Donner served as executive producer of the HBO anthology horror series Tales from the Crypt, based on the EC Comics series of the same name. He directed three episodes during its run (\"Dig That Cat... He's Real Gone\", \"The Ventriloquist's Dummy\", \"Showdown\"), and also produced three feature film spinoffs.\n\nFilms\n\nDonner's first feature film was X-15 (1961), which starred David McLean, Charles Bronson, and Mary Tyler Moore. Seven years passed before he directed his next, Salt and Pepper (1968), with Sammy Davis Jr., and Peter Lawford. His breakthrough film was The Omen (1976). A supernatural horror made in the wake of the success of The Exorcist, the film stars Gregory Peck, David Warner, and Lee Remick. It was the fifth-highest-grossing film of 1976.\n\nSuperman (1978)\n\nIn 1978, Donner directed Superman: The Movie, starring Christopher Reeve in the title role. Donner approached the film with the concept of creating verisimilitude, an intuitive feeling in the audience evoked that makes the fantasy story feel real within the story's context. It was a hit worldwide, projecting Reeve to international fame. The film co-starred Margot Kidder as Lois Lane, Marlon Brando as Jor-El, and Gene Hackman as archvillain Lex Luthor. At the box office, it grossed $134 million domestically.\n\nPrincipal photography of Superman included filming of its first sequel, Superman II. Donner filmed most of Superman II with the expectation he would complete the sequel after the release of Superman. Despite the first film's success, Donner was fired from Superman II. Throughout the filming of both Superman films, Donner had a difficult relationship with executive producers Alexander Salkind and Ilya Salkind and producer Pierre Spengler. The Salkinds refused Donner's demand that Spengler be fired; instead, the Salkinds replaced Donner as director of Superman II with Richard Lester, who had worked with the Salkinds on The Three Musketeers and The Four Musketeers and as an uncredited producer on Superman. Following Donner's dismissal, Marlon Brando's scenes were removed from Superman II and much of the film was re-shot under Lester's direction. Gene Hackman refused to return for re-shoots; consequently, all the Lex Luthor scenes that appear in Superman II were filmed by Donner, although Donner refused to be credited.\n\nRotten Tomatoes' summary states that \"Superman II meets, if not exceeds, the standard set by its predecessor.\" Donner continued to promote the view that his contribution was superior to the rest of the series. Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut was released on November 28, 2006, the same date as the DVD release of the summer film Superman Returns. This version of the film features the re-insertion of Marlon Brando's scenes as Jor-El and relies on a minimum of footage shot by Richard Lester.\n\nPost-Superman career\n\nDonner directed mixed commercial flops (Inside Moves, Radio Flyer) and successes (The Goonies, the Lethal Weapon series, Scrooged, and Conspiracy Theory). In the case of Superman, it was Donner who insisted the subject of the comic book superhero should be treated \"straight\", that is, portrayed with respect to the fantasy genre's particular conventions and tone, rather than \"camp\"; this approach strongly influenced later genre directors such as Tim Burton (Batman, Batman Returns), Bryan Singer (X-Men, X2, X-Men: Days of Future Past), Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises), Kevin Feige (Marvel Cinematic Universe), and Zack Snyder (Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Zack Snyder's Justice League), who have made successful superhero films of their own.\n\nLethal Weapon (1987–1998)\n\nDonner's next blockbuster film was the action comedy Lethal Weapon, written by Shane Black. It starred Mel Gibson and co-starred Danny Glover. The film's action sequences were considered \"truly spectacular\" and made the film one of the year's biggest hits.\n\nDonner directed six films starring Mel Gibson in total, creating a Lethal Weapon franchise with three sequels; the last of these was Lethal Weapon 4, released in 1998.\n\nX-Men\n\nDonner became the executive producer for the 2000 Marvel Comics film X-Men, then also an executive producer for the 2009 X-Men prequel, X-Men Origins: Wolverine. In addition, Donner's wife has produced all of the films in the X-Men film series under their Donners' Company brand.\n\nOn October 16, 2008, Donner and Lauren Shuler Donner received stars in a double ceremony on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their achievements in motion pictures, located at 6712 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nUnrealized projects\n\nDonner was the first choice to direct the \"unofficial\" James Bond film Never Say Never Again, but turned it down after he decided he disliked Lorenzo Semple Jr's script. He would have served as director of Jurassic Park had Columbia/TriStar won the bidding war for the screen rights against other studios. Donner was also considered as director for The Lost Boys, The Last Boy Scout, Memoirs of an Invisible Man, Dave, Forever Young, and The Sandlot. In 2001, Donner claimed he planned to direct a sequel to The Goonies after Timeline, and he planned to direct the fifth and final Lethal Weapon film before his death in 2021.\n\nBooks\n\nAction Comics (co-writer with Geoff Johns)\n\nLast Son and Escape from Bizarro World (2009)\n\nYou're the Director... You Figure It Out: The Life and Films of Richard Donner (2010)\n\nComic books\n\nOne of Donner's assistants in the late 1990s was comic book writer Geoff Johns. In October 2006, Donner, Johns, and artist Adam Kubert became the new creative team on Action Comics, the publisher's most time honored publication and one of DC Comics' two main Superman titles. Together, Johns and Donner collaborated on the stories Last Son and Escape from Bizarro World, both of which have been released in collected book form. Donner and Johns also co-wrote a story for Action Comics #1000, released in April 2018.\n\nBiography\n\nIn 2010, Donner's authorized biography titled You're the Director... You Figure It Out: The Life and Films of Richard Donner by James Christie was published by BearManor Media. The book features a foreword by Mel Gibson.\n\nPersonal life and death\n\nDonner married film producer Lauren Shuler on November 27, 1985. The two merged their respective production companies to create Shuler-Donner Productions (now The Donners' Company) the same year. Donner and Shuler remained together until the former's death.\n\nDonner was a cousin of actor Steve Kahan, who played a policeman tracking Otis in Superman: The Movie, and played Captain Ed Murphy in the Lethal Weapon film franchise. Donner also cast Kahan in some of his other films.\n\nDonner died on July 5, 2021, at his West Hollywood, California home, at the age of 91. The cause of death was heart failure with atherosclerosis as an underlying cause.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nYear Title Director Producer Notes 1961 X-15 Yes No 1968 Salt and Pepper Yes No 1969 Lola Yes No 1976 The Omen Yes No 1978 Superman Yes No 1980 Superman II Uncredited No Replaced as director by Richard Lester during principal photography\n\nLester received sole directorial credit Inside Moves Yes No 1982 The Toy Yes No 1985 The Goonies Yes Yes Ladyhawke Yes Yes 1987 Lethal Weapon Yes Yes 1988 Scrooged Yes Yes 1989 Lethal Weapon 2 Yes Yes 1992 Radio Flyer Yes No Replaced David Mickey Evans Lethal Weapon 3 Yes Yes 1994 Maverick Yes Yes 1995 Assassins Yes Yes 1997 Conspiracy Theory Yes Yes 1998 Lethal Weapon 4 Yes Yes 2002 Tales from the Crypt: Ritual No Yes Directed by Avi Nesher 2003 Timeline Yes Yes 2006 16 Blocks Yes No Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut Yes No Director's cut of Superman II\n\nExecutive producer\n\nOmen III: The Final Conflict (1981)\n\nThe Lost Boys (1987)\n\nDelirious (1991)\n\nFree Willy (1993)\n\nFree Willy 2: The Adventure Home (1995)\n\nTales from the Crypt: Demon Knight (1995)\n\nTales from the Crypt: ... of Blood (1996)\n\nFree Willy 3: The Rescue (1997)\n\nAny Given Sunday (1999)\n\nX-Men (2000)\n\nX-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)\n\nTelevision\n\nYear Title Notes 1957 Men of Annapolis Wrote 4 episodes (only screenwriting credit in career) 1960 Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre 1 episode The DuPont Show with June Allyson 1960–1961 Wanted Dead or Alive 6 episodes 1961 Letter to Loretta 5 episodes Route 66 1 episode The Tall Man 2 episodes Wagon Train 1 episode 1961–1962 Have Gun – Will Travel 5 episodes 1962 The Detectives 1 episode The Rifleman 7 episodes 1962–63 Sam Benedict 6 episodes 1963 The Eleventh Hour 2 episodes Combat! 1 episode The Nurses 1963–1964 The Lieutenant 2 episodes The Twilight Zone 6 episodes Mr. Novak 7 episodes 1964 The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters 1 episode The Man from U.N.C.L.E. 4 episodes 1964–1965 Gilligan's Island 3 episodes Perry Mason 1965 Twelve O'Clock High 4 episodes Get Smart 2 episodes 1966 The F.B.I. 1 episode The Fugitive 2 episodes It's About Time 1 episode Jericho The Wild Wild West 3 episodes The Felony Squad 1968–1969 The Banana Splits Adventure Hour 6 episodes 1971 The Interns 1 episode Sarge Bearcats! 2 episodes 1971–1972 Cade's County 3 episodes 1971–1973 Cannon 4 episodes 1972 The Sixth Sense 1 episode Ghost Story Banyon Ironside The Bold Ones: The New Doctors 3 episodes 1973–1974 Kojak 1974 The Streets of San Francisco 2 episodes Sons and Daughters 3 episodes Lucas Tanner 1 episode Petrocelli 1975 Bronk 2 episodes 1989–1992 Tales from the Crypt 3 episodes\n\nAlso executive producer\n\nNominated – CableACE Award for Best Dramatic Series\n\n1992 Two-Fisted Tales Television film\n\nSegment: \"Showdown\" 1993–1994 Tales from the Cryptkeeper Executive producer 1996–1997 Secrets of the Cryptkeeper's Haunted House 1997 Perversions of Science 1999 Made Men Producer\n\nTelevision film\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nYear Association Category Work Result 1979 Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films Best Director Superman Nominated World Science Fiction Society Best Dramatic Presentation Won 1986 Ladyhawke Nominated 1993 National Cable Television Association Best Dramatic Series Tales from the Crypt Nominated 1994 Nominated 1995 Nominated 1997 National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Outstanding Game Show Secrets of the Cryptkeeper's Haunted House Nominated 2000 Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films President's Award N/A Won Hollywood Film Awards Outstanding Achievement in Directing N/A Won 2002 Director's View Film Festival Joseph L.
