        "text": "Virtually everyone predicted that \"Maverick\" would open strongly over the weekend. Well, everyone except Richard Donner.\n\nMr. Donner, the director of the droll western and one of the most successful film makers in town, views the opening of each of his movies with so much anxiety that he flees Hollywood and goes salmon fishing.\n\n\"I try not to answer the phones,\" he said after answering the phone this morning at his vacation home on one of the San Juan Islands, north of Seattle. \"I can't read. I can't do too much except go fishing. I live in fear.\"\n\nNot to worry.\n\nThe film opened the summer season with the largest gross of the year: $17.2 million. The figure, although formidable, was less than Warner Brothers, the producers, had expected. \"Surprisingly, it did not do as well on the East Coast, in New York, as on the West Coast,\" Mr. Donner said. \"Maybe it was the ballgames over the weekend. Who knows?\"\n\nA gravel-voiced, enthusiastic and blunt-spoken New Yorker, Mr. Donner spoke of \"Maverick\" today over the phone, as well as last week in his office at Warner Brothers studio in Burbank, Calif. The reviews have generally been mixed to favorable. Caryn James wrote in her review in The New York Times that it \"works like a movie mogul's dream and sets the summer-film season off to an unbeatable start.\"\n\n\"These reviews -- it should happen to me for the rest of my life,\" said Mr. Donner, who is 64. \"A lot of people see this movie for what it is. It's really a road picture. Like Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour. Here we have Mel, Jody and James Garner. What are we trying to say? We're just trying to say, 'Come out of the theater and feel good.' It's not Shakespeare. It's light entertainment.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
