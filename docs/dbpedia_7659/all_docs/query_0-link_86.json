        "text": "GMCoaches, Latex mask and prop head sculpting\n\nBret Maverick, charming con man and romantic adventurer, is a gambling man with a deeply rooted sense of fair play.\n\nA debonair drifter, Maverick has a flair for getting into and out of trouble that makes him one of the most colorful characters in Western legend.\n\n'Maverick' is filled with the familiar faces of Western heroes of series such as\n\n'Wagon Train', 'Laramie', 'The Virginian' and 'Rawhide'.\n\nIn addition, many well-known country stars make cameo appearances in the movie.\n\nThe filmmakers have gathered an outstanding creative team to conduct the western\n\norchestra, including Academy Award-winning director of photography Vilmos Zsigmond\n\n('Close Encounters of the Third Kind').\n\nThe old foxes have conjured up a charming and extremely entertaining Western.\n\nAnd a Western of this scope would not be complete without a runaway stagecoach for our hero to save.\n\n'Maverick' - The power of hilarity.\n\nJames Garner (Zane Cooper) and Mel Gibson (Bret Maverick).\n\nDirector Richard Donner ('Lethal Weapon') Director Richard Donner and Jodie Foster and Maverick. DOP Vilmos Zsigmond. (Annaballe Bransford). To be able to shoot close-ups under controlled conditions, the Stagecoach was mounted on a trailer.\n\nThe trailer had to be correspondingly wide to have enough space for the cameras and lighting equipment. Maverick (Mel Gibson) inside of the Stagecoach. The film is full of small allusions and insider jokes.\n\nMel Gibson is driving GMC trucks in the 'Lethal Weapon' series.\n\nIn 'Maverick' he is sitting in a GMCoach. Close-ups filmed on the trailer.\n\nThe Stage Driver, played by 'Rawhide' legend Paul Brinegar, is in trouble.\n\nOne could also say he's dead as a doornail. In the desert of Arizona.\n\nOne of the stunt boys is now playing the Stage Driver.\n\nSo that everything looks perfect, he gets a latex 'Paul Brinegar' mask. Paul Brinegar - Latex mask and prop head sculpting.\n\nWho was the artist? Make-Up department of Michael Hancock or someone at ILM?\n\nWho can enlighten me here?\n\nPaul was already 76 years old during the filming of the runaway Stagecoach scenes and\n\nhe was physically not able to play these scenes.\n\nIn particular, the scene where he hangs upside down from the coach.\n\nThese scenes were then taken over by a stuntman with a 'Paul Brinegar' mask. It can be hot in Arizona. Some air holes drilled into the mask.\n\nThe mask is first class - this is Paul Brinegar.\n\nI'm sure no one has noticed something. The crew filmed two weeks in the desert of Arizona on the Navajo Indian Reservation.\n\nThe journey on the trailer seems to be quite overbooked! The stuntman has put on the mask, the wild ride can begin. Maverick wants to stop the driverless stagecoach.\n\nMel Gibson did many of the stagecoach scenes himself.\n\nHis stunt double, Stunt Coordinator Mic Rodgers, was there for the tricky scenes.\n\nDirector Richard Donner:'With Mel, if you set a shot and have to walk away,\n\nwhen you come back he's doing what the stuntmen are doing ...and you want to kill him.'\n\n(pressbook) The Stage Driver (Paul Brinegar) is dead.\n\nA stuntman with the 'Paul Brinegar' mask on hangs upside down from the coach. Paul Brinegar ('Rawhide') in one of his last movies, of course, a western.\n\nHe died march 27, 1995, shortly after the big success 'Maverick'. Maverick will climb on top of the coach and jump to the first team. Cut.\n\nNow stuntman Mic Rodgers comes into play.\n\nMic Rodgers (Stunt double for Mel Gibson) says the stunt is much\n\nlike the dangerous team-to-team transfer done in John Ford's classic 'Stagecoach'.\n\nBut he adds, 'In order to make it suit Maverick's character, some twists were added.\n\nNormally he would come out of the coach and go up on the top then jump from\n\nteam to team. But Maverick is more happy-go-lucky and he really doesn't want to\n\nget into any trouble, so he has to get there reluctantly by hitting a bump and\n\nslipping and falling between the wheels of the coach before getting to the top and\n\ndoing the transfers. No one's ever done it that way before.'\n\nThe complete stunt is actually a combination of two separate feats that many have\n\ntried and few have succeeded in doing. Second Unit Director Terry Leonard and Stunt Coordinator Mic Rodgers went ahead with\n\nthe stunt. It did not go exactly as planned.\n\nMic Rodgers: 'It's tremendous bad luck to catch both horses out of stride.\n\nOne may stumble, the other one picks him up. When I jumped from the swing team to\n\nthe leaders, the left lead horse put his nose in the dirt for about 30 feet.\n\nI was just waiting for the coach to land on me, for all of them to wad up underneath me.\n\nThe only thing that kept them up was the four horses behind them, pushing them.'\n\nLuck being with him on the day of the stunt, Rodgers walked safely away and joined\n\nan elite group of stuntmen, including the legendary Yakima Canutt, who can claim\n\nthis feat in their repertoire. (Pressbook) The stagecoach stops suddenly and rough, just before a steep cliff.\n\nMaverick flies in a high arc from the coach ...and threatens to fall down.\n\nThe dialogue in this scene is great...what a satirical mirth! I need help, but do not want the help.\n\nMel Gibson dangles high above the Colorado River. The manageable dangerous cliff ...a small ledge. Help!Help! Cliff Close-ups. Movie scenes full of joy. Helter-skelter thrills and spills. The three have buried the Stage Driver (Paul Brinegar) and belting out a last song. James Garner is Marshal Zane Cooper. Director Richard Donner. Jodie Foster is the wily Annabelle Bransford. Spain - the untamed european canyons and prairies of the Wild West in the golden\n\ndecades of Western movies. Gunsmoke, sandstorms and much more.\n\nDirector Frank Perry and Faye Dunaway filming 'DOC' in Almeria, Spain.\n\nKit West was supervising the FX in the desert of Almeria.\n\nwww.moon-city-garbage.agency on a dusty ride through the West."
