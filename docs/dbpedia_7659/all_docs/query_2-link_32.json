        "text": "Iconic director Richard Donner, the prolific Hollywood filmmaker behind some of the most memorable movies of the 1970s and ’80s – from the modern superhero movie \"Superman,\" to the kid adventure \"Goonies,\" and the buddy cop series \"Lethal Weapon\" – died Monday. He was 91.\n\nDonner's production company confirmed his passing to USA TODAY without elaboration on the cause of death.\n\nSean Astin, star of the Donner-directed 1985 hit \"Goonies,\" tweeted a tribute Monday, citing the famed movie line, \"Goonies never say die.\"\n\n\"Richard Donner had the biggest, boomiest voice you could imagine. He commanded attention and he laughed like no man has ever laughed before. Dick was so much fun. What I perceived in him, as a 12-year-old kid, is that he cared. I love how much he cared.\"\n\nActor Ned Beatty dies: 'Network' and 'Deliverance' star, played 'Superman' henchman Otis\n\nThe genial Donner, born Richard Donald Schwartzberg in the Bronx on April 24, 1930, gained fame with his first movie feature, 1976’s horror film \"The Omen.\"\n\nA then-unheard-of offer followed: $1 million to direct 1978’s \"Superman.\" Donner channeled his love of the character into making the film, repeatedly facing off with producers over the need for special effects that would convince the audience that a superhero could really fly.\n\nDonner cast little-known Christopher Reeve in the starring role. The chisel-jawed actor shot to instant fame with the Superman/Clark Kent role and was associated with “Superman” for the rest of his life.\n\n\"Superman\" was a $300 million box office hit that scored three Oscar nominations, including best score by John Williams, winning a special achievement Academy Award for its visual effects.\n\nThe film set the template for superhero movies to follow. By the 21st century, the genre was dominating the box office in the U.S. and worldwide.\n\n\"Man of Steel\" and \"Justice League\" director Zack Snyder wrote on Twitter in tribute, \"Thank you, Richard Donner. You made me believe.\"\n\nGene Hackman, who played arch-villain Lex Luthor in \"Superman, revealed a hilarious anecdote to The Hollywood Reporter about Donner:\n\n“I showed up for the first day of makeup tests for 'Superman' with a fine Lex Luthor mustache I’d grown for the role. Dick, wearing his own handsome mustache, told me mine had to go. He bargained to lose his if I did mine. True to his word, he celebrated my last razor stroke by gleefully pulling off the fake whiskers he’d acquired for the occasion.”\n\nConcluded Hackman, “Dick made it fun, and that’s why the films turned out that way, too.”\n\nA dispute with producers led to Donner taking his name off directing the 1980 follow-up \"Superman II\" — with director credit going to Richard Lester, who was brought in after Donner had shot most of the movie. A \"Superman II\" director’s cut that featured additional Donner-directed scenes was released in 2006.\n\nIn 1985, Donner directed the classic kids adventure \"The Goonies,\" with a script by Chris Columbus based on a story by Steven Spielberg.\n\nSpielberg, who produced “The Goonies,” wrote in a tribute statement posted on Twitter.\n\n\"Dick had such a powerful command of his movies, and was so gifted across so many genres. Being in his circle was akin to hanging out with your favorite coach, smartest professor, fiercest motivator, most endearing friend, staunchest ally, and — of course — the greatest Goonie of all,\" wrote Spielberg.\n\n\"He was all kid. All heart. All the time,\" Spielberg added. \"I can’t believe he’s gone, but his husky, hearty laugh will stay with me always.\"\n\nWith 1987's action film \"Lethal Weapon,\" director Donner began a mega-franchise that paired Danny Glover with \"Mad Max\" star Mel Gibson as mismatched police partners. Donner directed all four \"Lethal Weapon\" movies in an 11-year span. The franchise grossed more than $900 million globally and shot Gibson, as Martin Riggs, to superstar status.\n\n\"Donner! My friend, my mentor. Oh, the things I learned from him!\" Gibson wrote in a statement. \"He undercut his own talent and greatness with a huge chunk of humility referring to himself as ‘merely a traffic cop.’ He left his ego at the door and required that of others.\"\n\n\"If we piled up all the good deeds he did, it would stretch to some uncharted place in the firmament,\" Gibson added. \"I will sorely miss him, with all his mischievous wit and wisdom. “\n\nDonner directed the 1988 Christmas classic \"Scrooged,\" featuring Bill Murray as a selfish television executive, and 1992’s coming-of-age drama \"Radio Flyer.\"\n\nHis wife of more than 25 years, producer Lauren Shuler Donner, told Variety on July 8, \"He would light up the room. He had a big booming laugh, and a hug. He made you feel like you were really special, and that was his personality. That was his gift — embracing life and embracing humanity.\"\n\n\"I’m so lucky we were together that long,\" Shuler Donner added. \"I grew with him. I learned from him. For me, for my career, I wouldn’t be where I am today without his advice and pure osmosis, watching him on the set, and learning how to command a set and respect the crew.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press"
