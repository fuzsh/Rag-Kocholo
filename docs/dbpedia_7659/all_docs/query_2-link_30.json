        "text": "Richard Donner Birth Name Richard Donald Schwartzberg Birth Date April 24, 1930 Death Date July 5, 2021 (aged 91) Location Los Angeles, California, United States of America Directed Superman\n\nSuperman II/Donner Cut\n\nRichard Donner (born Richard Donald Schwartzberg; April 24, 1930 – July 5, 2021) is an American film and television director. He directed Superman and Superman II.\n\nHistory[]\n\nDonner directed the film Superman, starring the then-unknown Christopher Reeve. The film became a hit worldwide in 1978, projecting Reeve to international fame but he became somewhat typecast after a brief period of leading man status.\n\nSuperman and the sequel Superman II had been originally planned as two-parts of the same film, to be released in close proximity with each other. Both were originally based on an epic singular screenplay by Mario Puzo, that was later split into two parts. In anticipation of releasing them as two-parts of the one epic-length film, Donner shot principal photography for both films at the same time.\n\nDonner approached the story material with the explicit philosophical goal of verisimilitude, a believable ambiance to the fantasy of a powerful superhero appearing in the contemporary world. Donner had Tom Mankiewicz re-write the scripts to take Krypton and Smallville sections more seriously. However, the movie would lighten up to be more modern and humorous in the Metropolis section of the film. This mostly manifested in the character of Lois Lane and her treatment of Clark in the workplace. The villains were also treated with a comical approach, rather than being overtly threatening or ominous. A bumbling assistant called Otis was created who did not exist in the source material, which usually had robots to aid him. Luthor also wore plaid leisure suits and bow ties rather than his purple/green bodysuit from the comics or traditional mad scientist garb. These changes would keep production costs down and compliment Gene Hackman's average physique, as well as add a bit of levity to the film.\n\nEditing[]\n\nthe original ending for the first movie where Superman stops a flood and nukes was deemed to be missing a certain something by the film's independent financiers Ilya Salkind and his father Alexander Salkind. The time reversal ending of Superman II was used to pad out and fulfill Superman once the film had been identified as a priority with a plan to create an alternative end to the second film later. The idea of releasing Superman II in close proximity to Superman was then scrapped, and further, the 'to be continued' ending of Superman was also discarded.\n\nFallout with the Salkinds[]\n\nAfter the first film's successful release in December 1978, Donner was offered the director's role a second time, but demanded that producer Pierre Spengler be removed from the project. Rather than give in to this demand, the Salkinds replaced him with director Richard Lester, who worked with them on The Three Musketeers and The Four Musketeers and as an uncredited producer on Superman. Lester was willing to work for much lower price tag and more compliant wither wishes. The decision to remove Donner from the film series by the Salkinds, paid off for them as their sequels still broke the $100 million mark for domestic USA alone. The third film was overseen by Lester from the ground up, which some have criticized for being a lessor imitation or parody of the tonal approach to the preceding movies.\n\nReturn to Superman[]\n\nA no-flexibility attitude from Donner resulted in his exile from the Superman franchise until around 1999, when WB asked for his involvement with Special Edition of the 1978 film for a possible theatrical re-release. Donner did not have final cut in 1978 and was able to partially restore his original vision for film. An entirely new foley track was made this version and has been widely criticized by fans who grew up the theatrical foley track, especially since the theatrical cut is rarely included for modern releases of the movie. Donner has proclaimed this cut to be his preferred version and his final word on the first film. In 2019 Warner Archive Collection released the three hour Extended Cut from the television premiere in a remastered blu-ray please bundled with the 2000 Special Edition. Many notable historians and collectors such as Jim Bowers and Jay Towers of CapedWonder.com consider the three-hour cut the definitive version of the film.\n\nSeveral years later Donner's definitive (or at least, as close to definitive as possible) version of the sequel, simply titled Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut was released on November 28, 2006 on the same date as the DVD release of the summer hit, Superman Returns. The footage includes never-before-seen footage of Brando, a new opening, a new ending and approximately 83% of Donner footage. Some Richard Lester footage was used to fill in the gaps caused by Donner's never completing principal photography for the sequel before his removal. Some entirely new pickup shots, involving lookalikes/Standins, and also general crowd shots of Metropolis, were filmed to fill gaps, particularly in the time reversal sequence towards the end. These important shots are often filmed in most Hollywood productions by a second unit, or after the main production is over and the actors are no longer required, but this had naturally not originally occurred for this film as Donner needed it to. Michael Thau, the editor of the Richard Donner cut also made some minor use of CGI. However, he did not create CGI villains in order to complete the \"villains rule the world scene\" which was in the original script, but was never shot by Donner.\n\nLegacy and influence[]"
