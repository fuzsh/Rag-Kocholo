        "text": "RICHARD Donner is responsible for directed some of the most popular films.\n\nThe late director died on Monday July 5, 2021.\n\nWhat movies has Richard Donner directed?\n\nRichard Donner was an American director, producer, TV, and occasional comic-book writer.\n\nThroughout his 46-year career in film, he has directed over 80 productions.\n\nThose movies include:\n\nLondon Affair (1970)\n\nThe Omen (1976)\n\nSuperman (1978)\n\nSuperman II (1980)\n\nInside Moves (1980)\n\nLadyhawke (1982)\n\nThe Goonies (1985)\n\nLethal Weapon (1987)\n\nScrooged (1988)\n\nLethal Weapon 2 (1989)\n\nLethal Weapon 3 (1992)\n\nMaverick (1994)\n\nAssassins (1995)\n\nConspiracy Theory (1997)\n\nLethal Weapon 4 (1998)\n\nTimeline (2003)\n\n16 Blocks (2006)\n\nWhen he was not directing movies, he also directed various episodes of TV shows, including, The Twilight Zone, Gilligan's Island, and Mr. Novak.\n\nHow did Richard Donner die?\n\nHis wife Lauren, 72, confirmed his death with Hollywood trade publications on Monday, July 5.\n\nWhile she confirmed his passing, there has been no cause of death released.\n\nSince his death has been announced, the entertainment world has been reacting to the sad news.\n\nAmerican director and producer Steven Spielberg released a statement on Monday about Donner that read, \"Dick had such a powerful command of his movies, and was so gifted across so many genres. Being in his circle was akin to hanging out with your favorite coach, smartest professor, fiercest motivator, most endearing friend, staunchest ally, and — of course — the greatest Goonie of all. He was all kid. All heart. All the time.”\n\nCarol Kane also talked highly of the director saying he was \"a creative guidance counselor in the most nourishing way.\"\n\nWhat was Richard Donner's net worth?\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, Donner himself had an estimated net worth of $100 million. The website estimates that combined with his wife, American producer Lauren Shuler Donner, they had a combined net wroth of $200 million.\n\nA large part of their net worth comes from his directing of the Lethal Weapon films. The couple also co-executive produced several X-Men movies.\n\nAlong with producing, the couple also had money in real estate.\n\nThey previously owned a custom-built mansion in Maui with over 160 feet of ocean frontage that sold for $16.5 million in 2016."
