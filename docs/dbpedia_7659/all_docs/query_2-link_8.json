        "text": "Originally directed Superman - Der Film (1978) and Superman II: Allein gegen alle (1980) back-to-back, then cut back on filming the sequel to focus on finishing the first one for a Christmas release. A clash with producers Alexander Salkind and Ilya Salkind over the material led to Donner being fired before he could finish filming the second one and he was replaced by Richard Lester. Donner later estimated that he had directed 80% of the sequel and saw about 50% of his work in the theatrical film.\n\nHe has directed two films that have been selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant: Superman - Der Film (1978) and Die Goonies (1985).\n\nWas asked to direct the fourth Superman film (Superman IV - Die Welt am Abgrund (1987)), and considered it alongside Tom Mankiewicz, who had been the writer of the first two Superman films, but ultimately both Donner and Mankiewicz declined, as they had other projects to deal with at the time.\n\n[acknowledging Geoffrey Unsworth for developing the photography process that made the flying scenes in Superman - Der Film (1978) possible] If it hadn't been for Geoffrey Unsworth, we wouldn't have had a movie.\n\n[on Mel Gibson] The most exciting thing that's come into my life as an actor and a friend. He's a very special human being."
