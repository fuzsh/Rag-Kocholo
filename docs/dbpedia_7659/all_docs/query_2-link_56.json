No cause of death has been revealed.\n\nBorn Richard Donald Schwartzberg, the Bronx-native made his feature film directorial debut with the little-known 1968 Sammy Davis Jr. crime comedy \"Salt & Pepper,\" with his first big break coming in the form of 1976's \"The Omen,\" starring Gregory Peck and Lee Remick.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers.

More than 25 years later, his re-edited version was released on DVD in 2006 as \"Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut\" with lost Man of Steel footage.\n\nPrior to films, he spent his career in television, including shows such as \"Route 66,\" \"The Twilight Zone,\" and \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,\" to name a few.\n\nTributes began pouring in as news of Donner's death spread, with writer-director Kevin Smith calling Donner \"a natural-born storyteller.\"\n\n\"Richard Donner made the devil a child in 'The Omen,' invented the modern-day comic book movie with \"Superman,\" and reinvented the buddy cop movie with Lethal Weapon.'\" Smith tweeted.\n\nRead next\n\nWatch: The FBI agent who helped recover $300 million worth of stolen art explains what Hollywood gets wrong about art heists\n\nHollywood\n\nAdvertisement"
