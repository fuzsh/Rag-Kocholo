        "text": "Richard Donner was born Richard Donald Schwartzberg in the Bronx, New York City in 1930. He joined the Navy after high school and became an aerial photographer for a small carrier. His interest in photography grew in the service and after he was discharged, he began working for a number of small industrial companies. Working as a truck driver, set painter, and assistant editor, he learned a variety of positions around the filmmaking craft. His experience in multiple jobs led him to work with director George Blake, who eventually gave him his first shot directing industrials, documentaries and commercials at his company. He would go on to direct commercials in an exclusive deal for Desilu Productions. Donner’s success in commercials gained the attention of writer and producer Ed Adamson. Adamson offered him an episode of Wanted: Dead or Alive starring Steve McQueen, igniting his episodic television career.\n\nDonner’s list of credits cover television and feature film in the genres of action, horror and comedy. In television, he has directed episodes of Zane Grey Theater, The Loretta Young Show, X-15, Have Gun – Will Travel, The Twilight Zone, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., The Fugitive and The Felony Squad. His feature film credits include Salt and Pepper (1968), London Affair (1970), The Omen (1976), Superman (1978), Inside Moves (1980), The Goonies (1985), Lethal Weapon (1987), Scrooged (1988), Maverick (1994), Timeline (2003) and 16 Blocks (2006).\n\nDonner has been a member of the Directors Guild since 1958.\n\nDonner passed away in July 2021."
