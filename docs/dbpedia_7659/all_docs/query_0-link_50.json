        "text": "Post by ck100 on\n\nAny fans of this western comedy? It's still a lightweight, fun, breezy western comedy starring Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, and James Garner, written by William Goldman, and directed by Richard Donner. The cast is clearly having a good time and playing their roles well, and it's nice to see Jodie Foster in a rare comedic role. There is a fun \"Lethal Weapon\" reference when Danny Glover appears in a cameo. Donner gives the movie a big-budget slick sense of direction just like with his \"Lethal Weapon\" movies. This movie marked Goldman's return to writing a western comedy since \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\". My only main criticism of the movie is that it runs a bit long for a comedy at 127 minutes. It may not be a movie of great depth or significance, but \"Maverick\" is fun if you go in with the right frame of mind.\n\nLeonard Maltin Movie Guide Review:\n\nMaverick (1994) - 2.5 out of 4 stars\n\n\"Lackadaisical update of the fondly remembered '60s TV show relies heavily on personal charm to carry a thin storyline that moseys along much too slowly--and much too long. Gibson is fun as a wily cardsharp on his way to a big-stakes poker game, and the cast is peppered with familiar faces from the world of vintage TV Westerns and contemporary country music; look for a couple of cameos by stars of earlier movies from director Donner. Garner, who starred in the old TV series, is cast here as a marshal. Script by William Goldman. Panavsion.\"\n\nPost by Spike Del Rey on\n\nMaltin described it pretty well, but I'm a bit more generous in my appraisal, I'd go a 3.5 out of 5. But then again I'm a big fan of Donner's and this is in my Bluray filmography of his."
