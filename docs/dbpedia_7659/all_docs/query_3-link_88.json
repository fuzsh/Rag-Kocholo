        "text": "Maverick\n\nWith all the movies being spawned out of old television shows, it's a wonder we haven't seen Welcome Back, Kotter: the Movie or CHiPs: Ponch Strikes Back. Well, if you think Maverick is just another cheesy spinoff, you're dead wrong. In fact, it's one of the most genuinely funny movies to come across the silver screen in a long time!\n\nDirector Richard Donner brings us Maverick, a hilarious tale about a gambling con man named Bret Maverick (Mel Gibson) who's doing everything he can to conjure up a $25,000 entrance fee to a $500,000 poker tournament. Besides being $3,000 short of the entry fee, Maverick has to deal with a villain (Alfred Molina), who is hell-bent on stopping him from reaching the tournament because of a grudge.\n\nAlong the way he runs into Annabelle (Jodie Foster), a woman trying to con any amount of money out of anybody she can by using her sparkling smile, innocent eyes and sexuality. She also wants in on this \"poker tournament of the century.\"\n\nLast, but not least, is Zane Cooper (the original Maverick on TV, James Garner). \"Coop\" is a lawman who's on his way to _ you guessed it _ the tournament. The old Maverick, the new Maverick and Annabelle make their way to the big poker game, with various cons pulled along the way. It seems there isn't a single character in Maverick who isn't swindling someone or something.\n\nGibson brings his usual charisma and charm to the role of Maverick, a swindler with a self-admitted aversion to bravery. His deadly accurate timing and delivery make this, without a doubt, his finest comedic performance. Gibson is seemingly the perfect modern-day movie icon; guys strive to emulate him, and the women can't stop drooling. Rarely do you see a combination such as that in movies these days.\n\nTwo-time Oscar winner Foster shines in her first comic performance since she was a teenager, proving to Hollywood that her talents extend far beyond drama. Her role as Annabelle is sure to lead to more comedies for Foster.\n\nGarner turns in another fine acting job as Zane Cooper, a well-respected lawman who isn't all he appears to be.\n\nThe scene-stealing performance, however, is that of Graham Greene, hilarious as an American Indian chief who is another in a long list of con artists who populate Maverick. The Indian he portrays here is decidedly different than his Dances With Wolves role for which he received an Academy Award nomination. Even though he's in the movie for only a few scenes, they're the funniest ones in the entire movie.\n\nYou can play \"spot the cameo\" in this movie. Country singers and old Western stars make appearances throughout the film, and you may even notice a rather familiar bank robber. Clint Black makes a cameo as an innocent-looking cheater and has a song on the sound track designed for country music fans.\n\nEven if you loathe Westerns for some strange reason, go see Maverick just to sit back and watch the chemistry between the actors. From what I've heard, everyone involved had a blast filming Maverick, and it shows on screen. Some of the scenes between Foster and Gibson are pure magic!\n\nBy COLIN ANDERSON\n\nSt. Petersburg Catholic\n\nHigh School"
