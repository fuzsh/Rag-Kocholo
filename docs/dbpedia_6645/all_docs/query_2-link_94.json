        "text": "Canada’s premier stamp news magazine\n\nCanadian Stamp News is Canada’s leading source of information about stamp collecting and related fields. The majority of our readers are Canadian, and we concentrate on the unique circumstances surrounding collecting in our native land. Our editorial pages include information on new and old issues, as well as commentary, investment tips and Canada’s most up-to-date listings of Canadian coin and paper money prices.\n\nThe magazine had its roots more than 40 years ago when Canada Coin News was formed by Chet Krause, who built the largest hobby publishing company in the world out of Iola, Wisconsin.\n\nVery early, on CCN started to include stories on stamp collecting. In 1976 then publisher Don Thomas split what was then called Coin, Stamp, Antique News into separate coin and stamp magazines, creating CSN.\n\nFrom that time on, CSN has been a strong advocate for stamp collectors, and a vital source of information about the hobby, as well as a meeting place for collectors and dealers.\n\nOver the years, the publication changed hands several times, ending up with its present owners, Trajan Publishing, in 1989.\n\nToday, with a presence at virtually every major philatelic event in Canada, the magazine continues to showcase the very best in stamp collecting news. New issues, major sales, shows and exhibits, and discoveries all regularly appear on our pages."
