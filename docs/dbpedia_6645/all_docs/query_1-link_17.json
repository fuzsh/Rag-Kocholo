        "text": "Total Revenue of $78.5 Million, Adjusted EBITDA of $28.1 Million\n\nDENVER, Aug. 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Highlights\n\n(Compared to second quarter 2023 unless otherwise noted)\n\nTotal Revenue decreased 4.8% to $78.5 million\n\nRevenue excluding the Marketing Funds1 decreased 4.8% to $58.4 million, driven by negative 4.5% organic growth2 and 0.3% adverse foreign currency movements\n\nNet income attributable to RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. of $3.7 million and earnings per diluted share (GAAP EPS) of $0.19\n\nAdjusted EBITDA3 increased 5.4% to $28.1 million, Adjusted EBITDA margin3 of 35.8% and Adjusted earnings per diluted share (Adjusted EPS3) of $0.41\n\nTotal agent count decreased 968 agents, or 0.7%, to 143,542 agents\n\nU.S. and Canada combined agent count decreased 4.4% to 78,599 agents\n\nTotal open Motto Mortgage franchises increased 2.6% to 241 offices4\n\nOperating Statistics as of July 31, 2024\n\n(Compared to July 31, 2023, unless otherwise noted)\n\nTotal agent count decreased 302 agents, or 0.2%, to 144,281 agents\n\nU.S. and Canada combined agent count decreased 4.3% to 78,440 agents\n\nTotal open Motto Mortgage franchises increased 0.8% to 239 offices4\n\nRE/MAX Holdings, Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"RE/MAX Holdings\") (NYSE: RMAX), parent company of RE/MAX one of the world's leading franchisors of real estate brokerage services, and Motto Mortgage (\"Motto\"), the first and only national mortgage brokerage franchise brand in the U.S., today announced operating results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n\"We continue to operate our business as efficiently and effectively as possible, which contributed to better-than-expected second-quarter financial results,\" said Erik Carlson, RE/MAX Holdings Chief Executive Officer. \"Both during and after the quarter, we were pleased to announce notable brokerage and team conversions to RE/MAX, testament to our brand's strong reputation and value proposition in the market. Our mortgage business also continues to be resilient as we saw a year-over-year increase in open Motto Mortgage franchises.\n\nCarlson continued: \"As sector dynamics continue to change, skill is no longer optional. Agents who are experienced, productive, and trustworthy – attributes widely associated with RE/MAX affiliates – have a distinct competitive advantage. Those professionals, supplemented by our extensive support and resources, including outstanding education and marketing, our industry-leading brands, and our abundant presence in local markets, position RE/MAX Holdings to succeed in the months and years ahead.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Operating Results\n\nAgent Count\n\nThe following table compares agent count as of June 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nRevenue\n\nRE/MAX Holdings generated revenue of $78.5 million in the second quarter of 2024, a decrease of $4.0 million, or 4.8%, compared to $82.4 million in the second quarter of 2023. Revenue excluding the Marketing Funds was $58.4 million in the second quarter of 2024, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 4.8%, versus the same period in 2023. The decrease in Revenue excluding the Marketing Funds was attributable to negative organic revenue growth of 4.5% and adverse foreign currency movements of 0.3%. Negative organic revenue growth was principally driven by a decrease in U.S. agent count and a reduction in revenue from previous acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in Broker fee revenue.\n\nRecurring revenue streams, which consist of continuing franchise fees and annual dues, decreased $2.2 million, or 5.4%, compared to the second quarter of 2023 and accounted for 65.9% of Revenue excluding the Marketing Funds in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 66.3% of Revenue excluding the Marketing Funds in the prior-year period.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nTotal operating expenses were $62.3 million for the second quarter of 2024, a decrease of $7.0 million, or 10.1%, compared to $69.3 million in the second quarter of 2023. Second quarter 2024 total operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower selling, operating and administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortization and Marketing Funds expenses were also lower compared to the second quarter of 2023.\n\nSelling, operating and administrative expenses were $34.9 million in the second quarter of 2024, a decrease of $5.4 million, or 13.3%, compared to the second quarter of 2023 and represented 59.6% of Revenue excluding the Marketing Funds, compared to 65.5% in the prior-year period. Second quarter 2024 selling, operating and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower personnel costs and a decrease in bad debt, legal, property taxes, and technology expenses.\n\nNet Income and GAAP EPS\n\nNet income attributable to RE/MAX Holdings was $3.7 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $2.0 million for the second quarter of 2023. Reported basic and diluted GAAP earnings per share were $0.20 and $0.19, respectively, for the second quarter of 2024 compared to basic and diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.11 each in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $28.1 million for the second quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.4 million, or 5.4%, compared to the second quarter of 2023. Second quarter 2024 Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense, lower personnel costs, decreased property taxes, a reduction in technology expenses, and lower legal expenses, partially offset by a decrease in U.S. agent count. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.8% in the second quarter of 2024, compared to 32.3% in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nAdjusted basic and diluted EPS were $0.41 each for the second quarter of 2024 compared to Adjusted basic and diluted EPS of $0.41 and $0.40, respectively, for the second quarter of 2023. The ownership structure used to calculate Adjusted basic and diluted EPS for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, assumes RE/MAX Holdings owned 100% of RMCO, LLC (\"RMCO\"). The weighted average ownership RE/MAX Holdings had in RMCO was 60.0% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\nBalance Sheet\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $66.1 million, a decrease of $16.6 million from December 31, 2023. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had $442.7 million of outstanding debt, net of an unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, compared to $444.6 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\nShare Repurchases and Retirement\n\nAs previously disclosed, in January 2022 the Company's Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program of up to $100 million. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares. As of June 30, 2024, $62.5 million remained available under the share repurchase program.\n\nOutlook\n\nThe Company's third quarter and full year 2024 Outlook assumes no further currency movements, acquisitions, or divestitures.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, RE/MAX Holdings expects:\n\nAgent count to change negative 1.5% to 0.0% over third quarter 2023;\n\nRevenue in a range of $75.0 million to $80.0 million (including revenue from the Marketing Funds in a range of $19.0 million to $21.0 million); and\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in a range of $24.5 million to $27.5 million.\n\nFor the full year 2024, the Company is slightly reducing its agent count guidance and narrowing its Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges. The Company now expects:\n\nAgent count to change negative 1.0% to positive 1.0% over full year 2023, changed from negative 0.5% to positive 1.5%;\n\nRevenue in a range of $305.0 million to $315.0 million (including revenue from the Marketing Funds in a range of $78.0 million to $82.0 million), changed from $300.0 million to $320.0 million (including revenue from the Marketing Funds in a range of $78.0 million to $82.0 million); and\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in a range of $93.0 million to $98.0 million, changed from $90.0 million to $100.0 million.\n\nWebcast and Conference Call\n\nThe Company will host a conference call for interested parties on Friday, August 9, 2024, beginning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

The Company defines revenue from acquisitions as the revenue generated from the date of an acquisition to its first anniversary (excluding Marketing Funds revenue related to acquisitions where applicable).\n\n3Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP measures. These terms are defined at the end of this release. Please see Tables 5 and 6 appearing later in this release for reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\n4Total open Motto Mortgage franchises includes only \"bricks and mortar\" offices with a unique physical address with rights granted by a full franchise agreement with Motto Franchising, LLC and excludes any \"virtual\" offices or BranchiseSM offices.\n\nAbout RE/MAX Holdings, Inc.\n\nRE/MAX Holdings, Inc.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. Except as required by law, the Company does not intend, and undertakes no obligation, to update this information to reflect future events or circumstances.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThe SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with the SEC and in public disclosures of financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, such as revenue excluding the Marketing Funds, Adjusted EBITDA and the ratios related thereto, Adjusted net income, Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS) and adjusted free cash flow. These measures are derived based on methodologies other than in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nRevenue excluding the Marketing Funds is calculated directly from our consolidated financial statements as Total revenue less Marketing Funds fees.\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA (consolidated net income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income and the provision for income taxes, each of which is presented in the unaudited consolidated financial statements included earlier in this press release), adjusted for the impact of the following items that are either non-cash or that the Company does not consider representative of its ongoing operating performance: loss or gain on sale or disposition of assets and sublease, settlement and impairment charges, equity-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense, gain on reduction in tax receivable agreement liability, expense or income related to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of contingent consideration, restructuring charges and other non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.\n\nBecause Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin omit certain non-cash items and other non-recurring cash charges or other items, the Company believes that each measure is less susceptible to variances that affect its operating performance resulting from depreciation, amortization and other non-cash and non-recurring cash charges or other items. The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA and the related Adjusted EBITDA margin because the Company believes they are useful as supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of its operating businesses and provides greater transparency into the Company's results of operations. The Company's management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as factors in evaluating the performance of the business.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing the Company's results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n\nthese measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company's working capital needs;\n\nthese measures do not reflect the Company's interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on its debt;\n\nthese measures do not reflect the Company's income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay its taxes;\n\nthese measures do not reflect the cash requirements to pay dividends to stockholders of the Company's Class A common stock and tax and other cash distributions to its non-controlling unitholders;\n\nthese measures do not reflect the cash requirements pursuant to the tax receivable agreements;\n\nthese measures do not reflect the cash requirements for share repurchases;\n\nthese measures do not reflect the cash requirements for the settlement of industry class-action lawsuits and other legal settlements;\n\nalthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often require replacement in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;\n\nalthough equity-based compensation is a non-cash charge, the issuance of equity-based awards may have a dilutive impact on earnings per share; and\n\nother companies may calculate these measures differently so similarly named measures may not be comparable.\n\nThe Company's Adjusted EBITDA guidance does not include certain charges and costs. The adjustments to EBITDA in future periods are generally expected to be similar to the kinds of charges and costs excluded from Adjusted EBITDA in prior quarters, such as gain or loss on sale or disposition of assets and sublease, settlement and impairment charges, equity-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense, gains or losses from changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, expense or income related to changes in the fair value measurement of contingent consideration, restructuring charges and other non-recurring items. The exclusion of these charges and costs in future periods will have a significant impact on the Company's Adjusted EBITDA. The Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP financial guidance to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures without unreasonable effort because of the uncertainty and variability of the nature and amount of these future charges and costs.\n\nAdjusted net income is calculated as Net income attributable to RE/MAX Holdings, assuming the full exchange of all outstanding non-controlling interests for shares of Class A common stock as of the beginning of the period (and the related increase to the provision for income taxes after such exchange), plus primarily non-cash items and other items that management does not consider to be useful in assessing the Company's operating performance (e.g., amortization of acquired intangible assets, gain on sale or disposition of assets and sub-lease, non-cash impairment charges, acquisition-related expense, restructuring charges and equity-based compensation expense).\n\nAdjusted basic and diluted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS) are calculated as Adjusted net income (as defined above) divided by pro forma (assuming the full exchange of all outstanding non-controlling interests) basic and diluted weighted average shares, as applicable.\n\nWhen used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, Adjusted net income and Adjusted EPS are supplemental measures of operating performance that management believes are useful measures to evaluate the Company's performance relative to the performance of its competitors as well as performance period over period. By assuming the full exchange of all outstanding non-controlling interests, management believes these measures:\n\nfacilitate comparisons with other companies that do not have a low effective tax rate driven by a non-controlling interest on a pass-through entity;\n\nfacilitate period over period comparisons because they eliminate the effect of changes in Net income attributable to RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. driven by increases in its ownership of RMCO, LLC, which are unrelated to the Company's operating performance; and\n\neliminate primarily non-cash and other items that management does not consider to be useful in assessing the Company's operating performance.\n\nAdjusted free cash flow is calculated as cash flows from operations less capital expenditures and any changes in restricted cash of the Marketing Funds, all as reported under GAAP, and quantifies how much cash a company has to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value. The restricted cash of the Marketing Funds is limited in use for the benefit of franchisees and any impact to adjusted free cash flow is removed. The Company believes adjusted free cash flow is useful to investors as a supplemental measure as it calculates the cash flow available for working capital needs, re-investment opportunities, potential Independent Region and strategic acquisitions, dividend payments or other strategic uses of cash.\n\nAdjusted free cash flow after tax and non-dividend distributions to RIHI is calculated as adjusted free cash flow less tax and other non-dividend distributions paid to RIHI (the non-controlling interest holder) to enable RIHI to satisfy its income tax obligations. Similar payments would be made by the Company directly to federal and state taxing authorities as a component of the Company's consolidated provision for income taxes if a full exchange of non-controlling interests occurred in the future. As a result and given the significance of the Company's ongoing tax and non-dividend distribution obligations to its non-controlling interest, adjusted free cash flow after tax and non-dividend distributions, when used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, provides a meaningful view of cash flow available to the Company to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value.\n\nUnencumbered cash generated is calculated as adjusted free cash flow after tax and non-dividend distributions to RIHI less quarterly debt principal payments less annual excess cash flow payment on debt, as applicable. Given the significance of the Company's excess cash flow payment on debt, when applicable, unencumbered cash generated, when used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, provides a meaningful view of the cash flow available to the Company to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value after considering its debt service obligations.\n\nSOURCE RE/MAX Holdings, Inc."
