        "text": "About Time Magazine's Bias Rating\n\nTime Magazine is featured on the AllSides Media Bias Chart™.\n\nTime Magazine is a news media source with an AllSides Media Bias Rating™ of Lean Left.\n\nNote: This rating is for TIME's online content only, not its print magazine content.\n\nWhat a \"Lean Left\" Rating Means\n\nSources with an AllSides Media Bias Rating of Lean Left display media bias in ways that moderately align with liberal, progressive, or left-wing thought and/or policy agendas. A Lean Left bias is a moderately liberal rating on the political spectrum.\n\nLearn more about Lean Left ratings\n\nTIME Rated Lean Left in May 2023 Blind Bias Survey\n\nTIME’s AllSides Media Bias Rating™ was confirmed as Lean Left in our May 2023 Blind Bias Survey.\n\nRespondents who rated their own bias as Left, Lean Left, Center or Lean Right rated TIME as Lean Left; respondents on the Right rated its bias as Left. The average rating was Lean Left, confirming AllSides' existing media bias rating for TIME.\n\nA total of 1,009 people across the political spectrum took the survey, including 102 respondents with a self-reported Left bias; 223 with a Lean Left bias; 309 with a Center bias; 299 with a Lean Right bias, and 76 with a Right bias.\n\nFeb. 2022 Independent Review\n\nAllSides conducted an independent review of TIME magazine in Feb. 2022. We found its bias remained on the left; the reviewer saw some evidence that TIME's bias is close to Left.\n\nTIME displayed a Lean Left story choice. Some top stories the day of review were issues typically deemed important by progressives, with a heavy focus on COVID-19, labor, mental health, and transgender individuals:\n\nA Remote Himalayan District's High COVID-19 Vaccination Rate\n\nInside Facebook's African Sweatshop\n\nNasal Vaccines Could Help Stop COVID-19\n\nPediatricians Who Serve Trans Youth Face Increasing Harassment. Lifesaving Care Could Be on the Line\n\nA Photographic Diary of One Man's Struggle with Mental Illness Across Two Decades\n\nThe reviewer noted that calling medical treatment for transgender youth \"gender-affirming care\" is terminology used on the left; the site's \"Featured Voices\" section featured mostly voices on the left, including Some of Us Don't Have the Luxury of Moving On From COVID-19, How to Stay Grounded in the Uncertainty of the Pandemic. Meanwhile, other news outlets at this time were focusing on the pandemic ending.\n\nSept. 2018 Editorial Review: TIME Shifts from Left to Lean Left\n\nAllSides conducted an extensive Editorial Review of TIME in Sept. 2018. We decided to shift TIME's AllSides Media Bias Rating™ from Left to Lean Left.\n\nDuring the Sept. 2018 Editorial Review, the AllSides team noted that TIME magazine's news pieces were written in a narrative-based way: rather than simply stating hard facts, TIME often painted a picture in its writing. TIME magazine occassionally included some Center perspectives. During our review, we saw a number of \"puff pieces\" favorable to Democrats featured prominently on the site's main pages. The AllSides team noted TIME was not as sensationalist and did not employ as much emotional language as other Left outlets, though it still did employ these tactics from time to time.\n\nTop of Page\n\nCommunity Feedback\n\nFeedback does not determine ratings, but may trigger deeper review.\n\nAs of August 2024, people have voted on the AllSides Media Bias Rating for Time Magazine. On average, those who disagree with our rating think this source has a Lean Left bias.\n\nConfidence Level\n\nConfidence is determined by how many reviews have been applied and consistency of data.\n\nAs of August 2024, AllSides has high confidence in our Lean Left rating for Time Magazine. Two or more bias reviews have affirmed this rating or the source is transparent about bias.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nBias of TIME Readers\n\nIn December 2015, TIME readers voted for Bernie Sanders, a Democratic Socialist, as Person of the Year. The amount of TIME readers who voted for Sanders surpassed Malala Yousafzai and Pope Francis.\n\nPrevious TIME Media Bias Rating and Community Feedback\n\nPrior to Sept. 2018, the AllSides Media Bias Rating™ for TIME Magazine was Left. However, as of April 2017, a majority of AllSides users who voted on this bias rating disagreed. Community feedback suggested the bias rating should be closer to the Center. When those who disagreed with our bias rating of Left were asked what the rating should be, the average of their votes was on the border of Center and Lean Left, but closer to the Center. AllSides conducted an Editorial Review of TIME in Sept. 2018, and moved TIME's media bias rating to Lean Left.\n\nAbout TIME Magazine\n\nTIME Magazine is an American weekly news magazine published in New York City.
