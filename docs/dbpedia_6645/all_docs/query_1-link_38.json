        "text": "Artificial Intelligence\n\nHow AI Solutions Can Impact the Student End-User Experience\n\nDeVry University applies an iterative and holistic approach to integrating artificial intelligence into the classroom, with a focus on how it can enhance the overall student experience. Here are key things to consider when implementing AI at your institution.\n\nArtificial intelligence has permeated nearly every industry, and higher education is no exception. AI-powered solutions promise to revolutionize learning by providing personalized and adaptive experiences.\n\nAccording to the 2024 EDUCAUSE AI Landscape study, most higher education institutions are working on AI-related strategic planning with goals primarily focused on preparing students for the future workforce (64%) and exploring new methods of teaching and learning (63%). To truly move the needle on educational transformation, educators need a holistic strategy that thoughtfully integrates people, processes, data, and technology.\n\nAt DeVry University, for instance, we apply an iterative and holistic approach to integrating AI into the classroom, always considering how it can enhance the overall student experience. Our goal isn't to implement flashy new tech but to elevate learning. This comprehensive approach reassures us that AI will be implemented thoughtfully and effectively.\n\nWe pose vital questions to ensure AI will integrate smoothly across platforms, avoiding siloed or disjointed tools. How can this boost interactivity and engagement? Does it address a critical gap in the current experience? Will it operate cohesively with other solutions to support users holistically? The student is always at the heart of every decision. Here are some key aspects to consider when evaluating AI applications:\n\nBe Mindful of Spot Solutions\n\nAI's effectiveness is limited to its design and application. A spot solution approach in AI-powered applications often only targets a specific issue, resulting in a disjointed experience that can negatively impact learning outcomes. For example, students can become frustrated having to toggle between multiple platforms that don't integrate. Valuable study time gets wasted trying to make fragmented systems work together.\n\nEducation leaders should be mindful about how these spot solutions leave learners without comprehensive support or lack human-in-the-loop procedures. AI has the potential to add value almost anywhere if creatively applied, but it's just one part of the equation. When we implemented a virtual assistant at DeVry, we considered how it would provide support across all classroom environments and the capability of the technology to dive deeper into academic technology and administrative knowledge bases. It makes sense to start small and ensure the capabilities you choose can scale with your opportunities.\n\nConnect Solutions to Critical Needs\n\nFor AI to truly transform education, solutions must connect to student support. This curated approach identifies gaps in the student experience and highlights where AI integration is lacking. Education leaders should adopt this connected mindset when evaluating AI solutions. Consider how new tools integrate with existing platforms and map to the entire learner lifecycle. AI should simplify, not complicate, the student experience. With thoughtful implementation, these intelligent technologies can personalize learning and improve outcomes from start to finish.\n\nBeing where our learners are is essential, and understanding the most common friction points creates a starting point for meeting their most critical needs. Using surveys, outcomes data, and expert testimonial from learners, faculty, and staff creates pathways to truly transforming results for learners in and outside of the classroom.\n\nStreamline the Experience\n\nTime is especially precious for our predominantly adult learners. Streamlining experiences is a major focus to reduce unnecessary steps, provide quick access to essential resources, and maximize satisfying interactions that help enable resilience against learning challenges. This resilience is crucial for skill development and successful graduation. Whether through technology, processes, or human interaction, any effort to reduce friction and enhance learner outcomes is valuable."
