        "text": "Digital news has become an important part of Americans’ news media diets, with social media playing a crucial role in news consumption. Today, half of U.S. adults get news at least sometimes from social media.\n\nNews consumption on social media\n\nWhen it comes to where Americans regularly get news on social media, Facebook outpaces all other social media sites. Three-in-ten U.S. adults say they regularly get news there. Slightly fewer (26%) regularly get news on YouTube.\n\nSmaller shares regularly get news on Instagram (16%), TikTok (14%), X (12%) or Reddit (8%). Even fewer Americans regularly get news on Nextdoor (5%), LinkedIn (5%), Snapchat (4%), WhatsApp (3%) or Twitch (1%).\n\n(Seven-in-ten U.S. adults say they have seen or heard something about the renaming of Twitter as X. The platform’s name change took place in July 2023.)\n\nSome social media sites – despite having relatively small overall audiences – stand out for having high shares of users who regularly go to the site for news. For example, roughly half of users on X (53%) get news there. On the other hand, only 15% of Snapchat users regularly get news on the app.\n\nWho consumes news on each social media site\n\nThere are demographic differences, such as by gender, in who turns to each social media site regularly for news. Women make up a greater portion of regular news consumers on Nextdoor (66%), Facebook (62%), Instagram (59%) and TikTok (58%), while men make up a greater share on sites like Reddit (67%), X (62%) and YouTube (58%).\n\nSome partisan differences also arise when it comes to who regularly gets news on some social media sites. The majority of regular news consumers on many sites are Democrats or lean Democratic. No social media site included here has regular news consumers who are more likely to be Republicans or lean Republican, though there is no significant partisan difference among news consumers on Facebook, X or Nextdoor. (Read the Appendix for data on U.S. adults in each demographic group and party who regularly get news from each social media site.)\n\nFind out more\n\nThis fact sheet was compiled by Research Analyst Jacob Liedke and Research Associate Luxuan Wang.\n\nRead the methodology and the topline.\n\nPew Research Center is a subsidiary of The Pew Charitable Trusts, its primary funder.
