        "text": "The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has claimed a title not even Scott Morrison, in his many roles, managed to snag.\n\nHe has been named one of Time magazine’s most influential people in the world, joining the ranks of Jennifer Coolidge, Beyoncé and Joe Biden.\n\nThe annual list honours leaders, icons, artists, titans, pioneers and innovators, with Albanese lauded by the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, for choosing a “path of hope and opportunity” in a world where “it’s easy for politicians to sow fear and division”.\n\n“From growing up in public housing to taking office last spring as Australia’s new prime minister, he is a symbol of hope and inspiration,” Trudeau said.\n\n“To choose the path of hope and opportunity takes immense courage, and that courage lives within Anthony Albanese.”\n\nTrudeau’s glowing praise may raise some eyebrows domestically, with the Canadian prime minister extolling Albanese for working to “lift up and amplify the voices of those who need to be heard from, particularly Indigenous peoples”.\n\n“His government supports those who need it most, believes that we need to take ambitious climate action, and unwaveringly supports democracy in the face of unprecedented threat,” Trudeau said.\n\nSince coming to office, the Albanese government has not changed the welfare rate, has been criticised for not being ambitious enough in setting legislated climate targets or emissions reductions policies, and continues to turn back boats.\n\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoonemail newsletters for your daily news roundup\n\nThe signing of the Aukus agreement, put in train by Morrison, has also raised concerns domestically and within the region.\n\nTrudeau, the son of a politician, was also taken with Albanese’s more modest beginnings.\n\n“Progressives around the world are united in the idea that we should leave no one behind,” Trudeau said. “The idea that no matter who you are or where you come from, you should have every chance to succeed in life. Few politicians embody that journey as Anthony Albanese does.”\n\nThe last Australian prime minister to make the list was Kevin Rudd, Albanese’s political ally and friend, who was named one of the most influential people in the world in 2008, just a few months after riding the Kevin ’07 wave into the Lodge.\n\nRudd was a finalist for the list the following year, but did not make the cut.\n\nAlbanese was listed as one of the world’s most influential leaders alongside the US president, and Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, whom Dr Jill Biden celebrated as: “A mother. Protector. The pride of her nation. A beacon of hope for the people she loves.”\n\nTwitter boss and meme lord Elon Musk was named as one of the globe’s most influential titans, with US journalist Kara Swisher lamenting his transformation into “the world’s richest online troll after his purchase of Twitter”.\n\n“Under Musk’s erratic rule, Twitter has become a nonstop grievance tantrum we must all endure, and he wastes far too much of his time fiddling on his toxic violin while it burns,” Swisher said. “What’s the opposite of progress? Elon Musk 2023.”\n\nInternet darling and gay icon Coolidge joined the list as a “national treasure” according to Mia Farrow, while entertainer Doja Cat was recognised by Australian director Baz Luhrmann as an innovator and “true child of the internet”."
