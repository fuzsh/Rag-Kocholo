        "text": "What Medical Expenses Are Includible?\n\nFollowing is a list of items that you can include in figuring your medical expense deduction.

The cost of permanent improvements that increase the value of your property may be partly included as a medical expense. The cost of the improvement is reduced by the increase in the value of your property. The difference is a medical expense. If the value of your property isn't increased by the improvement, the entire cost is included as a medical expense.\n\nCertain improvements made to accommodate a home to your disabled condition, or that of your spouse or your dependents who live with you, don't usually increase the value of the home and the cost can be included in full as medical expenses. These improvements include, but aren't limited to, the following items.\n\nConstructing entrance or exit ramps for your home.\n\nWidening doorways at entrances or exits to your home.\n\nWidening or otherwise modifying hallways and interior doorways.\n\nInstalling railings, support bars, or other modifications to bathrooms.\n\nLowering or modifying kitchen cabinets and equipment.\n\nMoving or modifying electrical outlets and fixtures.\n\nInstalling porch lifts and other forms of lifts (but elevators generally add value to the house).\n\nModifying fire alarms, smoke detectors, and other warning systems.\n\nModifying stairways.\n\nAdding handrails or grab bars anywhere (whether or not in bathrooms).\n\nModifying hardware on doors.\n\nModifying areas in front of entrance and exit doorways.\n\nGrading the ground to provide access to the residence.\n\nOnly reasonable costs to accommodate a home to your disabled condition are considered medical care.

Enter the value of your home immediately before the improvement 3. _____ 4. Subtract line 3 from line 2. This is the increase in the value of your home due to the improvement 4. _____ • If line 4 is more than or equal to line 1, you have no medical expenses due to the home improvement; stop here. • If line 4 is less than line 1, go to line 5. 5. Subtract line 4 from line 1. These are your medical expenses due to the home improvement 5. _____\n\nOperation and upkeep.\n\nAmounts you pay for operation and upkeep of a capital asset qualify as medical expenses as long as the main reason for them is medical care. This rule applies even if none or only part of the original cost of the capital asset qualified as a medical care expense.\n\nImprovements to property rented by a person with a disability.\n\nAmounts paid to buy and install special plumbing fixtures for a person with a disability, mainly for medical reasons, in a rented house are medical expenses.\n\nExample.\n\nYou have arthritis and a heart condition.

This includes amounts paid for meals and lodging. Also see Lodging, later.\n\nInsurance Premiums\n\nYou can include in medical expenses insurance premiums you pay for policies that cover medical care. You can't include in medical expenses insurance premiums that were paid and for which you are claiming a credit or deduction. Medical care policies can provide payment for treatment that includes:\n\nHospitalization, surgical services, X-rays;\n\nPrescription drugs and insulin;\n\nDental care;\n\nReplacement of lost or damaged contact lenses; and\n\nLong-term care (subject to additional limitations). See Qualified Long-Term Care Insurance Contracts under Long-Term Care, later.\n\nIf you have a policy that provides payments for other than medical care, you can include the premiums for the medical care part of the policy if the charge for the medical part is reasonable. The cost of the medical part must be separately stated in the insurance contract or given to you in a separate statement.\n\nEmployer-Sponsored Health Insurance Plan\n\nDon't include in your medical and dental expenses any insurance premiums paid by an employer-sponsored health insurance plan unless the premiums are included on your Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement. Also, don't include any other medical and dental expenses paid by the plan unless the amount paid is included on your Form W-2.\n\nExample.\n\nYou are a federal employee participating in the premium conversion plan of the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) program. Your share of the FEHB premium is paid by making a pre-tax reduction in your salary. Because you are an employee whose insurance premiums are paid with money that is never included in your gross income, you can't deduct the premiums paid with that money.\n\nLong-term care services.\n\nContributions made by your employer to provide coverage for qualified long-term care services under a flexible spending or similar arrangement must be included in your income. This amount will be reported as wages on your Form W-2.\n\nRetired public safety officers.\n\nIf you are a retired public safety officer, don't include as medical expenses any health or long-term care insurance premiums that you elected to have paid with tax-free distributions from a retirement plan. This applies only to distributions that would otherwise be included in income.\n\nHealth reimbursement arrangement (HRA).\n\nIf you have medical expenses that are reimbursed by a health reimbursement arrangement, you can't include those expenses in your medical expenses.\n\nMedicare Part A\n\nIf you are covered under social security (or if you are a government employee who paid Medicare tax), you are enrolled in Medicare Part A. The payroll tax paid for Medicare Part A isn't a medical expense.\n\nIf you aren't covered under social security (or weren't a government employee who paid Medicare tax), you can voluntarily enroll in Medicare Part A. In this situation, you can include the premiums you paid for Medicare Part A as a medical expense.\n\nMedicare Part B\n\nMedicare Part B is a supplemental medical insurance. Premiums you pay for Medicare Part B are a medical expense. Check the information you received from the Social Security Administration to find out your premium.\n\nMedicare Part D\n\nMedicare Part D is a voluntary prescription drug insurance program for persons with Medicare Part A or B. You can include as a medical expense premiums you pay for Medicare Part D.\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment\n\nYou can include in medical expenses the amounts you pay for personal protective equipment, such as masks, hand sanitizer and hand sanitizing wipes, for the primary purpose of preventing the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). For more information, see IRS Announcement 2021-7.\n\nPrepaid Insurance Premiums\n\nPremiums you pay before you are age 65 for insurance for medical care for yourself, your spouse, or your dependents after you reach age 65 are medical care expenses in the year paid if they are:\n\nPayable in equal yearly installments or more often; and\n\nPayable for at least 10 years, or until you reach age 65 (but not for less than 5 years).\n\nUnused Sick Leave Used To Pay Premiums\n\nYou must include in gross income cash payments you receive at the time of retirement for unused sick leave. You must also include in gross income the value of unused sick leave that, at your option, your employer applies to the cost of your continuing participation in your employer's health plan after you retire. You can include this cost of continuing participation in the health plan as a medical expense.\n\nIf you participate in a health plan where your employer automatically applies the value of unused sick leave to the cost of your continuing participation in the health plan (and you don't have the option to receive cash), don't include the value of the unused sick leave in gross income. You can't include this cost of continuing participation in that health plan as a medical expense.\n\nInsurance Premiums You Can't Include\n\nYou can't include premiums you pay for:\n\nLife insurance policies;\n\nPolicies providing payment for loss of earnings;\n\nPolicies for loss of life, limb, sight, etc.;\n\nPolicies that pay you a guaranteed amount each week for a stated number of weeks if you are hospitalized for sickness or injury;\n\nThe part of your car insurance that provides medical insurance coverage for all persons injured in or by your car because the part of the premium providing insurance for you, your spouse, and your dependents isn't stated separately from the part of the premium providing insurance for medical care for others; or\n\nHealth or long-term care insurance if you elected to pay these premiums with tax-free distributions from a retirement plan made directly to the insurance provider and these distributions would otherwise have been included in income.\n\nTaxes imposed by any governmental unit, such as Medicare taxes, aren't insurance premiums.\n\nCoverage for nondependents.\n\nGenerally, you can't deduct any additional premium you pay as the result of including on your policy someone who isn't your spouse or dependent, even if that person is your child under age 27. However, you can deduct the additional premium if that person is:\n\nYour child whom you don't claim as a dependent because of the rules for children of divorced or separated parents;\n\nAny person you could have claimed as a dependent on your return except that person received $4,700 or more of gross income or filed a joint return; or\n\nAny person you could have claimed as a dependent except that you, or your spouse if filing jointly, can be claimed as a dependent on someone else's 2023 return.\n\nAlso, if you had family coverage when you added this individual to your policy and your premiums didn't increase, you can enter on Schedule A (Form 1040) the full amount of your medical and dental insurance premiums.\n\nIntellectually and Developmentally Disabled, Special Home for\n\nYou can include in medical expenses the cost of keeping a person who is intellectually and developmentally disabled in a special home, not the home of a relative, on the recommendation of a psychiatrist to help the person adjust from life in a mental hospital to community living.\n\nLaboratory Fees\n\nYou can include in medical expenses the amounts you pay for laboratory fees that are part of medical care.\n\nLactation Expenses\n\nSee Breast Pumps and Supplies, earlier.\n\nLead-Based Paint Removal\n\nYou can include in medical expenses the cost of removing lead-based paints from surfaces in your home to prevent a child who has or had lead poisoning from eating the paint. These surfaces must be in poor repair (peeling or cracking) or within the child's reach. The cost of repainting the scraped area isn't a medical expense.\n\nIf, instead of removing the paint, you cover the area with wallboard or paneling, treat these items as capital expenses. See Capital Expenses, earlier. Don't include the cost of painting the wallboard as a medical expense.\n\nLearning Disability\n\nSee Special Education, later.\n\nLegal Fees\n\nYou can include in medical expenses legal fees you paid that are necessary to authorize treatment for mental illness. However, you can't include in medical expenses fees for the management of a guardianship estate, fees for conducting the affairs of the person being treated, or other fees that aren't necessary for medical care.\n\nLifetime Care—Advance Payments\n\nYou can include in medical expenses a part of a life-care fee or “founder's fee” you pay either monthly or as a lump sum under an agreement with a retirement home. The part of the payment you include is the amount properly allocable to medical care. The agreement must require that you pay a specific fee as a condition for the home's promise to provide lifetime care that includes medical care. You can use a statement from the retirement home to prove the amount properly allocable to medical care. The statement must be based either on the home's prior experience or on information from a comparable home.\n\nDependents with disabilities.\n\nYou can include in medical expenses advance payments to a private institution for lifetime care, treatment, and training of your physically or mentally impaired child upon your death or when you become unable to provide care.

This rule doesn't apply in situations where the future care is purchased in connection with obtaining lifetime care of the type described earlier.\n\nLodging\n\nYou can include in medical expenses the cost of meals and lodging at a hospital or similar institution if a principal reason for being there is to receive medical care. See Nursing Home, later.\n\nYou may be able to include in medical expenses the cost of lodging not provided in a hospital or similar institution. You can include the cost of such lodging while away from home if all of the following requirements are met.\n\nThe lodging is primarily for and essential to medical care.\n\nThe medical care is provided by a doctor in a licensed hospital or in a medical care facility related to, or the equivalent of, a licensed hospital.\n\nThe lodging isn't lavish or extravagant under the circumstances.\n\nThere is no significant element of personal pleasure, recreation, or vacation in the travel away from home.\n\nThe amount you include in medical expenses for lodging can't be more than $50 for each night for each person. You can include lodging for a person traveling with the person receiving the medical care. For example, if a parent is traveling with a sick child, up to $100 per night can be included as a medical expense for lodging. Meals aren't included.\n\nDon't include the cost of lodging while away from home for medical treatment if that treatment isn't received from a doctor in a licensed hospital or in a medical care facility related to, or the equivalent of, a licensed hospital or if that lodging isn't primarily for or essential to the medical care received.\n\nLong-Term Care\n\nYou can include in medical expenses amounts paid for qualified long-term care services and certain amounts of premiums paid for qualified long-term care insurance contracts.\n\nQualified Long-Term Care Services\n\nQualified long-term care services are necessary diagnostic, preventive, therapeutic, curing, treating, mitigating, rehabilitative services, and maintenance and personal care services (defined later) that are:\n\nRequired by a chronically ill individual, and\n\nProvided pursuant to a plan of care prescribed by a licensed health care practitioner.\n\nChronically ill individual.\n\nAn individual is chronically ill if, within the previous 12 months, a licensed health care practitioner has certified that the individual meets either of the following descriptions.\n\nThe individual is unable to perform at least two activities of daily living without substantial assistance from another individual for at least 90 days, due to a loss of functional capacity.

The contract must:\n\nBe guaranteed renewable;\n\nNot provide for a cash surrender value or other money that can be paid, assigned, pledged, or borrowed;\n\nProvide that refunds, other than refunds on the death of the insured or complete surrender or cancellation of the contract, and dividends under the contract must be used only to reduce future premiums or increase future benefits; and\n\nGenerally not pay or reimburse expenses incurred for services or items that would be reimbursed under Medicare, except where Medicare is a secondary payer, or the contract makes per diem or other periodic payments without regard to expenses.\n\nThe amount of qualified long-term care premiums you can include is limited. You can include the following as medical expenses on Schedule A (Form 1040).\n\nQualified long-term care premiums up to the following amounts.\n\nAge 40 or under—$480.\n\nAge 41 to 50—$890.\n\nAge 51 to 60—$1,790.\n\nAge 61 to 70—$4,770.\n\nAge 71 or over—$5,960.\n\nUnreimbursed expenses for qualified long-term care services.\n\nNote. The limit on premiums is for each person.\n\nAlso, if you are an eligible retired public safety officer, you can't include premiums for long-term care insurance if you elected to pay these premiums with tax-free distributions from a qualified retirement plan made directly to the insurance provider and these distributions would otherwise have been included in your income.\n\nMeals\n\nYou can include in medical expenses the cost of meals at a hospital or similar institution if a principal reason for being there is to get medical care.\n\nYou can't include in medical expenses the cost of meals that aren't part of inpatient care. Also see Weight-Loss Program and Nutritional Supplements, later.\n\nMedical Conferences\n\nYou can include in medical expenses amounts paid for admission and transportation to a medical conference if the medical conference concerns the chronic illness of yourself, your spouse, or your dependent. The costs of the medical conference must be primarily for and necessary to the medical care of you, your spouse, or your dependent. The majority of the time spent at the conference must be spent attending sessions on medical information.\n\n. The cost of meals and lodging while attending the conference isn't deductible as a medical expense..\n\nMedicines\n\nYou can include in medical expenses amounts you pay for prescribed medicines and drugs. A prescribed drug is one that requires a prescription by a doctor for its use by an individual. You can also include amounts you pay for insulin. Except for insulin, you can't include in medical expenses amounts you pay for a drug that isn't prescribed.\n\nImported medicines and drugs.\n\nIf you imported medicines or drugs from other countries, see Medicines and Drugs From Other Countries under What Expenses Aren't Includible, later.\n\nNursing Home\n\nYou can include in medical expenses the cost of medical care in a nursing home, home for the aged, or similar institution, for yourself, your spouse, or your dependents. This includes the cost of meals and lodging in the home if a principal reason for being there is to get medical care.\n\nDon't include the cost of meals and lodging if the reason for being in the home is personal. You can, however, include in medical expenses the part of the cost that is for medical or nursing care.\n\nNursing Services\n\nYou can include in medical expenses wages and other amounts you pay for nursing services. The services need not be performed by a nurse as long as the services are of a kind generally performed by a nurse. This includes services connected with caring for the patient's condition, such as giving medication or changing dressings, as well as bathing and grooming the patient. These services can be provided in your home or another care facility.\n\nGenerally, only the amount spent for nursing services is a medical expense. If the attendant also provides personal and household services, amounts paid to the attendant must be divided between the time spent performing household and personal services and the time spent for nursing services. For example, because of your medical condition, you pay a visiting nurse $300 per week for medical and household services. Ten percent of the nurse’s time is spent doing household services such as washing dishes and laundry. You can include only $270 per week as medical expenses. The $30 (10% × $300) allocated to household services can't be included. However, certain maintenance or personal care services provided for qualified long-term care can be included in medical expenses. See Maintenance and personal care services under Long-Term Care, earlier. Additionally, certain expenses for household services or for the care of a qualifying individual incurred to allow you to work may qualify for the child and dependent care credit. See Pub. 503.\n\nYou can also include in medical expenses part of the amount you pay for that attendant's meals. Divide the food expense among the household members to find the cost of the attendant's food. Then divide that cost in the same manner as in the preceding paragraph. If you had to pay additional amounts for household upkeep because of the attendant, you can include the extra amounts with your medical expenses. This includes extra rent or utilities you pay because you moved to a larger apartment to provide space for the attendant.\n\nEmployment taxes.\n\nYou can include as a medical expense social security tax, FUTA, Medicare tax, and state employment taxes you pay for an attendant who provides medical care. If the attendant also provides personal and household services, you can include as a medical expense only the amount of employment taxes paid for medical services, as explained earlier. For information on employment tax responsibilities of household employers, see Pub. 926.\n\nOperations\n\nYou can include in medical expenses amounts you pay for legal operations that aren't for cosmetic surgery. See Cosmetic Surgery under What Expenses Aren't Includible, later.\n\nOptometrist\n\nSee Eyeglasses, earlier.\n\nOrgan Donors\n\nSee Transplants, later.\n\nOsteopath\n\nYou can include in medical expenses amounts you pay to an osteopath for medical care.\n\nOxygen\n\nYou can include in medical expenses amounts you pay for oxygen and oxygen equipment to relieve breathing problems caused by a medical condition.\n\nPhysical Examination\n\nYou can include in medical expenses the amount you pay for an annual physical examination and diagnostic tests by a physician. You don't have to be ill at the time of the examination.\n\nPregnancy Test Kit\n\nYou can include in medical expenses the amount you pay to purchase a pregnancy test kit to determine if you are pregnant.\n\nPremium Tax Credit\n\nYou can't include in medical expenses the amount of health insurance premiums paid by or through the premium tax credit. You also can't include in medical expenses any amount of advance payments of the premium tax credit made that you did not have to pay back. However, any amount of advance payments of the premium tax credit that you did have to pay back can be included in medical expenses.\n\nExample 1.\n\nYou are under age 65 and unmarried. The cost of your health insurance premiums in 2023 is $8,700. Advance payments of the premium tax credit of $4,200 are made to the insurance company and you pay premiums of $4,500. On your 2023 tax return, you are allowed a premium tax credit of $3,600 and must repay $600 excess advance credit payments (which is less than the repayment limitation). You are treated as paying $5,100 ($8,700 less the allowed premium tax credit of $3,600) for health insurance premiums in 2023. You will enter $5,100 on Schedule A, line 1.\n\nExample 2.\n\nThe facts are the same as in Example 1, except you are allowed a premium tax credit of $4,900 on your tax return and receive a net premium tax credit of $700. You are treated as paying $3,800 ($8,700 less the allowed premium tax credit of $4,900) for health insurance premiums in 2023. You will enter $3,800 on Schedule A, line 1.\n\nProsthesis\n\nSee Artificial Limb and Breast Reconstruction Surgery, earlier.\n\nPsychiatric Care\n\nYou can include in medical expenses amounts you pay for psychiatric care. This includes the cost of supporting a mentally ill dependent at a specially equipped medical center where the dependent receives medical care. See Psychoanalysis next and Transportation, later.\n\nPsychoanalysis\n\nYou can include in medical expenses payments for psychoanalysis. However, you can't include payments for psychoanalysis that is part of required training to be a psychoanalyst.\n\nPsychologist\n\nYou can include in medical expenses amounts you pay to a psychologist for medical care.\n\nSpecial Education\n\nYou can include in medical expenses fees you pay on a doctor's recommendation for a child's tutoring by a teacher who is specially trained and qualified to work with children who have learning disabilities caused by mental or physical impairments, including nervous system disorders.\n\nYou can include in medical expenses the cost (tuition, meals, and lodging) of attending a school that furnishes special education to help a child to overcome learning disabilities. Overcoming the learning disabilities must be the primary reason for attending the school, and any ordinary education received must be incidental to the special education provided. Special education includes:\n\nTeaching Braille to a visually impaired person,\n\nTeaching lip reading to a hearing disabled person, or\n\nGiving remedial language training to correct a condition caused by a birth defect.\n\nYou can't include in medical expenses the cost of sending a child with behavioral problems to a school where the course of study and the disciplinary methods have a beneficial effect on the child's attitude if the availability of medical care in the school isn't a principal reason for sending the student there.\n\nSterilization\n\nYou can include in medical expenses the cost of a legal sterilization (a legally performed operation to make a person unable to have children). Also see Vasectomy, later.\n\nStop-Smoking Programs\n\nYou can include in medical expenses amounts you pay for a program to stop smoking. However, you can't include in medical expenses amounts you pay for drugs that don't require a prescription, such as nicotine gum or patches, that are designed to help stop smoking.\n\nSurgery\n\nSee Operations, earlier.\n\nTelephone\n\nYou can include in medical expenses the cost of special telephone equipment that lets a person who is deaf, hard of hearing, or has a speech disability communicate over a regular telephone.

You can also include the cost of repairing the equipment.\n\nTelevision\n\nYou can include in medical expenses the cost of equipment that displays the audio part of television programs as subtitles for persons with a hearing disability. This may be the cost of an adapter that attaches to a regular set. It may also be the part of the cost of a specially equipped television that exceeds the cost of the same model regular television set.\n\nTherapy\n\nYou can include in medical expenses amounts you pay for therapy received as medical treatment.\n\nTransplants\n\nYou can include in medical expenses amounts paid for medical care you receive because you are a donor or a possible donor of a kidney or other organ. This includes the cost of medical care for the donor, in connection with the donation of an organ to you, your spouse, or dependent. This also includes transportation expenses.\n\nTransportation\n\nYou can include in medical expenses amounts paid for transportation primarily for, and essential to, medical care.\n\nYou can include:\n\nBus, taxi, train, or plane fares or ambulance service;\n\nTransportation expenses of a parent who must go with a child who needs medical care;\n\nTransportation expenses of a nurse or other person who can give injections, medications, or other treatment required by a patient who is traveling to get medical care and is unable to travel alone; and\n\nTransportation expenses for regular visits to see a mentally ill dependent, if these visits are recommended as a part of treatment.\n\nCar expenses.\n\nYou can include out-of-pocket expenses, such as the cost of gas and oil, when you use a car for medical reasons. You can't include depreciation, insurance, general repair, or maintenance expenses.\n\nIf you don't want to use your actual expenses for 2023, you can use the standard medical mileage rate of 22 cents a mile.\n\nYou can also include parking fees and tolls. You can add these fees and tolls to your medical expenses whether you use actual expenses or the standard mileage rate.\n\nExample.\n\nIn 2023, you drove 2,800 miles for medical reasons. You spent $400 for gas, $30 for oil, and $100 for tolls and parking. You want to figure the amount to include in medical expenses both ways to see which gives the greater deduction.\n\nYou figure the actual expenses first. You add the $400 for gas, the $30 for oil, and the $100 for tolls and parking for a total of $530.\n\nYou then figure the standard mileage amount. You multiply 2,800 miles by 22 cents a mile for a total of $616. Then you add the $100 tolls and parking and mileage for a total of $716 (616 + 100).\n\nYou include the $716 of car expenses with the other medical expenses for the year because the $716 is more than the $530 figured using actual expenses.\n\nTransportation expenses you can't include.\n\nYou can't include in medical expenses the cost of transportation in the following situations.\n\nGoing to and from work, even if your condition requires an unusual means of transportation.\n\nTravel for purely personal reasons to another city for an operation or other medical care.\n\nTravel that is merely for the general improvement of one's health.\n\nThe costs of operating a specially equipped car for other than medical reasons.\n\nTrips\n\nYou can include in medical expenses amounts you pay for transportation to another city if the trip is primarily for, and essential to, receiving medical services. You may be able to include up to $50 for each night for each person. You can include lodging for a person traveling with the person receiving the medical care. For example, if a parent is traveling with a sick child, up to $100 per night can be included as a medical expense for lodging. Meals aren't included. See Lodging, earlier.\n\nYou can't include in medical expenses a trip or vacation taken merely for a change in environment, improvement of morale, or general improvement of health, even if the trip is made on the advice of a doctor. However, see Medical Conferences, earlier.\n\nTuition\n\nUnder special circumstances, you can include charges for tuition in medical expenses. See Special Education, earlier.\n\nA lump-sum fee which includes education, board, and medical care—without distinguishing which part of the fee results from medical care—is not considered an amount payable for medical care. However, you can include charges for a health plan included in a lump-sum tuition fee if the charges are separately stated or can easily be obtained from the school.\n\nVasectomy\n\nYou can include in medical expenses the amount you pay for a vasectomy.\n\nVision Correction Surgery\n\nSee Eye Surgery, earlier.\n\nWeight-Loss Program\n\nYou can include in medical expenses amounts you pay to lose weight if it is a treatment for a specific disease diagnosed by a physician (such as obesity, hypertension, or heart disease). This includes fees you pay for membership in a weight reduction group as well as fees for attendance at periodic meetings. You can't include membership dues in a gym, health club, or spa as medical expenses, but you can include separate fees charged there for weight loss activities.\n\nYou can't include the cost of diet food or beverages in medical expenses because the diet food and beverages substitute for what is normally consumed to satisfy nutritional needs. You can include the cost of special food in medical expenses only if:\n\nThe food doesn't satisfy normal nutritional needs,\n\nThe food alleviates or treats an illness, and\n\nThe need for the food is substantiated by a physician.\n\nThe amount you can include in medical expenses is limited to the amount by which the cost of the special food exceeds the cost of a normal diet. See also Weight-Loss Program under What Expenses Aren't Includible, later.\n\nWheelchair\n\nYou can include in medical expenses the amounts you pay for a wheelchair used for the relief of a sickness or disability. The cost of operating and maintaining the wheelchair is also a medical expense.\n\nWig\n\nYou can include in medical expenses the cost of a wig purchased upon the advice of a physician for the mental health of a patient who has lost all of their hair from disease.\n\nX-ray\n\nYou can include in medical expenses amounts you pay for X-rays for medical reasons.\n\nWhat Expenses Aren't Includible?\n\nFollowing is a list of some items that you can't include in figuring your medical expense deduction. The items are listed in alphabetical order.\n\nBaby Sitting, Childcare, and Nursing Services for a Normal, Healthy Baby\n\nYou can't include in medical expenses amounts you pay for the care of children, even if the expenses enable you, your spouse, or your dependent to get medical or dental treatment. Also, any expense allowed as a childcare credit can't be treated as an expense paid for medical care.\n\nControlled Substances\n\nYou can't include in medical expenses amounts you pay for controlled substances (such as marijuana, laetrile, etc.) that aren't legal under federal law, even if such substances are legalized by state law.\n\nCosmetic Surgery\n\nGenerally, you can't include in medical expenses the amount you pay for cosmetic surgery. This includes any procedure that is directed at improving the patient's appearance and doesn't meaningfully promote the proper function of the body or prevent or treat illness or disease. You generally can't include in medical expenses the amount you pay for procedures such as face lifts, hair transplants, hair removal (electrolysis), and liposuction.\n\nYou can include in medical expenses the amount you pay for cosmetic surgery if it is necessary to improve a deformity arising from, or directly related to, a congenital abnormality, a personal injury resulting from an accident or trauma, or a disfiguring disease.\n\nExample.\n\nAn individual undergoes surgery that removes a breast as part of treatment for cancer. The individual pays a surgeon to reconstruct the breast. The surgery to reconstruct the breast corrects a deformity directly related to the disease. The cost of the surgery is includible in the individual’s medical expenses.\n\nDancing Lessons\n\nYou can't include in medical expenses the cost of dancing lessons, swimming lessons, etc., even if they are recommended by a doctor, if they are only for the improvement of general health.\n\nElectrolysis or Hair Removal\n\nSee Cosmetic Surgery, earlier.\n\nFuture Medical Care\n\nGenerally, you can't include in medical expenses current payments for medical care (including medical insurance) to be provided substantially beyond the end of the year. This rule doesn't apply in situations where the future care is purchased in connection with obtaining lifetime care, as explained under Lifetime Care—Advance Payments, or qualified long-term care insurance contracts, as explained under Long-Term Care, earlier.\n\nHair Transplant\n\nSee Cosmetic Surgery, earlier.\n\nHealth Club Dues\n\nYou can't include in medical expenses health club dues or amounts paid to improve one's general health or to relieve physical or mental discomfort not related to a particular medical condition.\n\nYou can't include in medical expenses the cost of membership in any club organized for business, pleasure, recreation, or other social purpose.\n\nHealth Savings Accounts\n\nYou can’t include in medical expenses amounts you contribute to a health savings account. You can’t include expenses you pay for with a tax-free distribution from your health savings account. You also can’t use other funds equal to the amount of the distribution and include the expenses. For more information, see Pub. 969.\n\nHousehold Help\n\nYou can't include in medical expenses the cost of household help, even if such help is recommended by a doctor. This is a personal expense that isn't deductible. However, you may be able to include certain expenses paid to a person providing nursing-type services. For more information, see Nursing Services, earlier, under What Medical Expenses Are Includible. Also, certain maintenance or personal care services provided for qualified long-term care can be included in medical expenses. For more information, see Long-Term Care, earlier, under What Medical Expenses Are Includible.\n\nIllegal Operations and Treatments\n\nYou can't include in medical expenses amounts you pay for illegal operations, treatments, or controlled substances whether rendered or prescribed by licensed or unlicensed practitioners.\n\nInsurance Premiums\n\nSee Insurance Premiums under What Medical Expenses Are Includible, earlier.\n\nMaternity Clothes\n\nYou can't include in medical expenses amounts you pay for maternity clothes.\n\nMedical Savings Account (MSA)\n\nYou can't include in medical expenses amounts you contribute to an Archer MSA. You can't include expenses you pay for with a tax-free distribution from your Archer MSA. You also can't use other funds equal to the amount of the distribution and include the expenses. For more information on Archer MSAs, see Pub. 969.\n\nMedicines and Drugs From Other Countries\n\nIn general, you can't include in your medical expenses the cost of a prescribed drug brought in (or ordered and shipped) from another country. You can only include the cost of a drug that was imported legally. For example, you can include the cost of a prescribed drug the Food and Drug Administration announces can be legally imported by individuals.\n\nYou can include the cost of a prescribed drug you purchase and consume in another country if the drug is legal in both the other country and the United States.\n\nNonprescription Drugs and Medicines\n\nExcept for insulin, you can't include in medical expenses amounts you pay for a drug that isn't prescribed. A prescribed drug is one that requires a prescription by a doctor for its use by an individual.\n\nExample.\n\nYour doctor recommends that you take aspirin. Because aspirin is a drug that doesn't require a physician's prescription for its use by an individual, you can't include its cost in your medical expenses.\n\nNutritional Supplements\n\nYou can't include in medical expenses the cost of nutritional supplements, vitamins, herbal supplements, “natural medicines,” etc., unless they are recommended by a medical practitioner as treatment for a specific medical condition diagnosed by a physician. These items are taken to maintain your ordinary good health and aren't for medical care.\n\nPersonal Use Items\n\nYou can't include in medical expenses the cost of an item ordinarily used for personal, living, or family purposes unless it is used primarily to prevent or alleviate a physical or mental disability or illness. For example, the cost of a toothbrush and toothpaste is a nondeductible personal expense.\n\nIn order to accommodate an individual with a physical disability, you may have to purchase an item ordinarily used as a personal, living, or family item in a special form. You can include the excess of the cost of the item in a special form over the cost of the item in normal form as a medical expense. See Braille Books and Magazines under What Medical Expenses Are Includible, earlier.\n\nPremium Tax Credit\n\nYou can't include in medical expenses the amount of health insurance premiums paid by or through the premium tax credit. You also can't include in medical expenses any amount of advance payments of the premium tax credit made that you did not have to pay back. However, any amount of advance payments of the premium tax credit that you did have to pay back can be included in medical expenses.\n\nSurrogacy Expenses\n\nYou can't include in medical expenses the amounts you pay for the identification, retention, compensation, and medical care of a gestational surrogate because they are paid for an unrelated party who is not you, your spouse, or your dependent.\n\nSwimming Lessons\n\nSee Dancing Lessons, earlier.\n\nTeeth Whitening\n\nYou can't include in medical expenses amounts paid to whiten teeth. See Cosmetic Surgery, earlier.\n\nVeterinary Fees\n\nYou generally can't include veterinary fees in your medical expenses, but see Guide Dog or Other Service Animal under What Medical Expenses Are Includible, earlier.\n\nWeight-Loss Program\n\nYou can't include in medical expenses the cost of a weight-loss program if the purpose of the weight loss is the improvement of appearance, general health, or sense of well-being. You can't include amounts you pay to lose weight unless the weight loss is a treatment for a specific disease diagnosed by a physician (such as obesity, hypertension, or heart disease). If the weight-loss treatment isn't for a specific disease diagnosed by a physician, you can't include either the fees you pay for membership in a weight-reduction group or fees for attendance at periodic meetings. Also, you can't include membership dues in a gym, health club, or spa.\n\nYou can't include the cost of diet food or beverages in medical expenses because the diet food and beverages substitute for what is normally consumed to satisfy nutritional needs.\n\nSee Weight-Loss Program under What Medical Expenses Are Includible, earlier.\n\nHealth Insurance Costs for Self-Employed Persons\n\nIf you were self-employed and had a net profit for the year, you may be able to deduct, as an adjustment to income, amounts paid for medical and qualified long-term care insurance on behalf of yourself, your spouse, your dependents, and your children who were under age 27 at the end of 2023. For this purpose, you were self-employed if you were a general partner (or a limited partner receiving guaranteed payments) or you received wages from an S corporation in which you were more than a 2% shareholder. The insurance plan must be established under your trade or business and the deduction can't be more than your earned income from that trade or business.\n\nYou can't deduct payments for medical insurance for any month in which you were eligible to participate in a health plan subsidized by your employer, your spouse's employer, or an employer of your dependent, or your child under age 27, at the end of 2023. You can't deduct payments for a qualified long-term care insurance contract for any month in which you were eligible to participate in a long-term care insurance plan subsidized by your employer or your spouse's employer.\n\nIf you qualify to take the deduction, use the Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction Worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1040 to figure the amount you can deduct. But if any of the following applies, don't use that worksheet.\n\nYou had more than one source of income subject to self-employment tax.\n\nYou file Form 2555, Foreign Earned Income.\n\nYou are using amounts paid for qualified long-term care insurance to figure the deduction.\n\nIf you can't use the worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1040, use Form 7206, Self-Employed Health Deduction, to figure your deduction.\n\nUse Pub. 974, Premium Tax Credit, instead of the worksheet in the 2023 Instructions for Form 1040 if the insurance plan established, or considered to be established, under your business was obtained through the Health Insurance Marketplace and you are claiming the premium tax credit.\n\nWhen figuring the amount you can deduct for insurance premiums, don't include amounts paid for health insurance coverage with retirement plan distributions that were tax free because you are a retired public safety officer.\n\nWhere to report.\n\nYou take this deduction on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. If you itemize your deductions and don't claim 100% of your self-employed health insurance costs on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, include any remaining premiums with all other medical expenses on Schedule A (Form 1040) subject to the 7.5% limit.\n\nChild under age 27.\n\nIf the insurance policy covers your nondependent child who was under age 27 at the end of 2023, you can claim the premiums for that coverage on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. If you can't claim 100% of your self-employed health insurance costs on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, any excess amounts attributable to that child aren't eligible to be claimed on Schedule A (Form 1040).\n\nGenerally, family health insurance premiums don't increase if coverage for an additional child is added. If this is the situation, no allocation would be necessary. If the premiums did increase (such as where coverage was expanded from single to family to add the nondependent child), you can allocate the amount on Form 1040 or 1040-SR to the nondependent child and any excess amounts not attributable to that child would be eligible to be claimed on Schedule A.\n\nExample 1.\n\nYou were self-employed in 2023 and had self-only coverage for health insurance. Your premium for that coverage was $5,000 for the year. You change to family coverage only to add your 26-year-old nondependent child to the plan. Your health insurance premium increases to $10,000 for the year. After completing the Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction Worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1040, you can only deduct $4,000 on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. The $4,000 is allocable to the nondependent child. You can only claim the $5,000 allocable to your coverage on Schedule A. The $1,000 excess premiums allocable to the nondependent child can’t be claimed by you.\n\nExample 2.\n\nThe facts are the same as in Example 1, except that you had family coverage when you added your 26-year-old nondependent child to the policy. There was no increase in the $10,000 premium. In this case, you could claim $4,000 on Form 1040 or 1040-SR and $6,000 on Schedule A.\n\nMore information.\n\nFor more information, see Pub. 535.\n\nHow To Get Tax Help\n\nIf you have questions about a tax issue; need help preparing your tax return; or want to download free publications, forms, or instructions, go to IRS.gov to find resources that can help you right away.\n\nPreparing and filing your tax return.\n\nAfter receiving all your wage and earnings statements (Forms W-2, W-2G, 1099-R, 1099-MISC, 1099-NEC, etc.); unemployment compensation statements (by mail or in a digital format) or other government payment statements (Form 1099-G); and interest, dividend, and retirement statements from banks and investment firms (Forms 1099), you have several options to choose from to prepare and file your tax return.

If you choose to have someone prepare your tax return, choose that preparer wisely. A paid tax preparer is:\n\nPrimarily responsible for the overall substantive accuracy of your return,\n\nRequired to sign the return, and\n\nRequired to include their preparer tax identification number (PTIN).\n\n. Although the tax preparer always signs the return, you're ultimately responsible for providing all the information required for the preparer to accurately prepare your return and for the accuracy of every item reported on the return. Anyone paid to prepare tax returns for others should have a thorough understanding of tax matters. For more information on how to choose a tax preparer, go to Tips for Choosing a Tax Preparer on IRS.gov..\n\nEmployers can register to use Business Services Online.\n\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA) offers online service at SSA.gov/employer for fast, free, and secure W-2 filing options to CPAs, accountants, enrolled agents, and individuals who process Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, and Form W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement.\n\nIRS social media.\n\nGo to IRS.gov/SocialMedia to see the various social media tools the IRS uses to share the latest information on tax changes, scam alerts, initiatives, products, and services.

Direct deposit also avoids the possibility that your check could be lost, stolen, destroyed, or returned undeliverable to the IRS. Eight in 10 taxpayers use direct deposit to receive their refunds. If you don’t have a bank account, go to IRS.gov/DirectDeposit for more information on where to find a bank or credit union that can open an account online.\n\nReporting and resolving your tax-related identity theft issues.\n\nTax-related identity theft happens when someone steals your personal information to commit tax fraud. Your taxes can be affected if your SSN is used to file a fraudulent return or to claim a refund or credit.\n\nThe IRS doesn’t initiate contact with taxpayers by email, text messages (including shortened links), telephone calls, or social media channels to request or verify personal or financial information. This includes requests for personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords, or similar information for credit cards, banks, or other financial accounts.\n\nGo to IRS.gov/IdentityTheft, the IRS Identity Theft Central webpage, for information on identity theft and data security protection for taxpayers, tax professionals, and businesses. If your SSN has been lost or stolen or you suspect you’re a victim of tax-related identity theft, you can learn what steps you should take.\n\nGet an Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN). IP PINs are six-digit numbers assigned to taxpayers to help prevent the misuse of their SSNs on fraudulent federal income tax returns. When you have an IP PIN, it prevents someone else from filing a tax return with your SSN. To learn more, go to IRS.gov/IPPIN.\n\nWays to check on the status of your refund.\n\nGo to IRS.gov/Refunds.\n\nDownload the official IRS2Go app to your mobile device to check your refund status.\n\nCall the automated refund hotline at 800-829-1954.\n\n. The IRS can’t issue refunds before mid-February for returns that claimed the EIC or the additional child tax credit (ACTC). This applies to the entire refund, not just the portion associated with these credits..\n\nMaking a tax payment.\n\nPayments of U.S. tax must be remitted to the IRS in U.S. dollars. Digital assets are not accepted. Go to IRS.gov/Payments for information on how to make a payment using any of the following options.\n\nIRS Direct Pay: Pay your individual tax bill or estimated tax payment directly from your checking or savings account at no cost to you.\n\nDebit Card, Credit Card, or Digital Wallet: Choose an approved payment processor to pay online or by phone.\n\nElectronic Funds Withdrawal: Schedule a payment when filing your federal taxes using tax return preparation software or through a tax professional.\n\nElectronic Federal Tax Payment System: Best option for businesses. Enrollment is required.\n\nCheck or Money Order: Mail your payment to the address listed on the notice or instructions.\n\nCash: You may be able to pay your taxes with cash at a participating retail store.\n\nSame-Day Wire: You may be able to do same-day wire from your financial institution. Contact your financial institution for availability, cost, and time frames.\n\nNote.\n\nThe IRS uses the latest encryption technology to ensure that the electronic payments you make online, by phone, or from a mobile device using the IRS2Go app are safe and secure. Paying electronically is quick, easy, and faster than mailing in a check or money order.\n\nWhat if I can’t pay now?\n\nGo to IRS.gov/Payments for more information about your options.\n\nApply for an online payment agreement (IRS.gov/OPA) to meet your tax obligation in monthly installments if you can’t pay your taxes in full today. Once you complete the online process, you will receive immediate notification of whether your agreement has been approved.\n\nUse the Offer in Compromise Pre-Qualifier to see if you can settle your tax debt for less than the full amount you owe. For more information on the Offer in Compromise program, go to IRS.gov/OIC.\n\nFiling an amended return.\n\nGo to IRS.gov/Form1040X for information and updates.\n\nChecking the status of your amended return.\n\nGo to IRS.gov/WMAR to track the status of Form 1040-X amended returns.\n\n. It can take up to 3 weeks from the date you filed your amended return for it to show up in our system, and processing it can take up to 16 weeks..\n\nUnderstanding an IRS notice or letter you’ve received.\n\nGo to IRS.gov/Notices to find additional information about responding to an IRS notice or letter.\n\nResponding to an IRS notice or letter.\n\nYou can now upload responses to all notices and letters using the Document Upload Tool. For notices that require additional action, taxpayers will be redirected appropriately on IRS.gov to take further action. To learn more about the tool, go to IRS.gov/Upload.\n\nNote.\n\nYou can use Schedule LEP (Form 1040), Request for Change in Language Preference, to state a preference to receive notices, letters, or other written communications from the IRS in an alternative language. You may not immediately receive written communications in the requested language. The IRS’s commitment to LEP taxpayers is part of a multi-year timeline that began providing translations in 2023. You will continue to receive communications, including notices and letters, in English until they are translated to your preferred language\n\nContacting your local TAC.\n\nKeep in mind, many questions can be answered on IRS.gov without visiting a TAC. Go to IRS.gov/LetUsHelp for the topics people ask about most. If you still need help, TACs provide tax help when a tax issue can’t be handled online or by phone. All TACs now provide service by appointment, so you’ll know in advance that you can get the service you need without long wait times. Before you visit, go to IRS.gov/TACLocator to find the nearest TAC and to check hours, available services, and appointment options. Or, on the IRS2Go app, under the Stay Connected tab, choose the Contact Us option and click on “Local Offices.”\n\nThe Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) Is Here To Help You\n\nWhat Is TAS?\n\nTAS is an independent organization within the IRS that helps taxpayers and protects taxpayer rights.

Services are offered for free or a small fee.
