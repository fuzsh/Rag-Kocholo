        "text": "TELUS was also ranked the 2nd most sustainable company in Canada and ranked 21st out of 500 companies, globally, further highlighting its leadership in sustainability and social capitalism\n\nVANCOUVER, BC, June 25, 2024 /CNW/ - Today, TELUS proudly announced that it has been recognized by TIME Magazine and Statista in their inaugural list of the World's Most Sustainable Companies, ranking 21st out of 500 global companies overall. Notably, TELUS was ranked the 2nd most sustainable Canadian company and took first place as the most sustainable telecommunications company in Canada. These accolades reflect TELUS' global leadership in corporate citizenship and philanthropy, innovation management and environmental and social reporting for more than two decades.\n\nTIME Magazines' World's Most Sustainable Companies were selected through a rigorous four step process and data analysis that considered over 20 key performance indicators including emissions and energy intensity, disclosure of its sustainability to investors assessed by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Score â€“ reflecting TELUS' exceptional \"A- leadership\" ranking of its operations. Of the more than 5,000 eligible companies globally, only 500 companies were recognized as delivering the most impactful sustainability outcomes and building a more sustainable world.\n\n\"Our team's commitment to sustainability is foundational to our leadership in social capitalism. Indeed, earning recognition as the top ranking Canadian communications company in respect of sustainability by TIME Magazine reinforces our dedication to not only eliminating our carbon footprint, but as well, helping proactively improve the health of the planet our children will inherit, while also creating meaningful value for our fellow citizens,\" said Darren Entwistle, President and CEO, TELUS. \"Thanks to the unparalleled efforts of our team, we have set ambitious environmental and sustainability targets to help ensure the well-being of our societies.
