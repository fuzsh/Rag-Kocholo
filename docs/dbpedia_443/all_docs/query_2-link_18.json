Shannon. Claude Shannon knew Edmund C. Berkeley quite well. Berkeley had two young associates working part-time with him on his early robots, by the names of Ivan and Bert Sutherland. Ivan was soon to have Claude Shannon as his Thesis supervisor. Berkeley was keen …\n\nRead More “1950 – Maze-Solving Mouse – Claude Shannon (American)”\n\n1951 – SNARC Maze Solver – Minsky / Edmonds (American)\n\nIn 1951 Marvin Minsky teamed with Dean Edmonds build the first artificial neural network that simulated a rat finding its way through a maze. They designed the first (40 neuron) neurocomputer, SNARC (Stochastic Neural Analog Reinforcement Computer), with synapses that adjusted their weights (measures of synaptic permeabilities) according to the success of performing a specified …\n\nRead More “1951 – SNARC Maze Solver – Minsky / Edmonds (American)”\n\n1950 – Maze Solver – J. J. Coupling (John Pierce) – (American)\n\nIn the pulp magazine \"Astounding Science Fiction\" of August, 1950, J. J. Coupling (Pseudonym) wrote an article titled \"How To Build A Thinking Machine\". It used a trial and error approach, using a maze as an example. There is no evidence to date that suggests it was ever realized. The article is quite interesting in that Coupling …\n\nRead More “1950 – Maze Solver – J. J. Coupling (John Pierce) – (American)”\n\n1950-1 – Maze Runner – Ian P. Howard (England)\n\nIan P.
