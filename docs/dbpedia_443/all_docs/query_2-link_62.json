        "text": "Sleek and striking Abby Dalton became a very familiar perky and sexy presence in 1960s TV households. Known not only for her award-worthy acting on TV comedy, she became an avid game-show panelist and appeared on a slew of TV's more popular programs. It might come as a surprise to some that she honed her wholesome sitcom personality only after apprenticing in Roger Corman cheap-jack cult movies -- sometimes as a juvenile delinquent. She was born Gladys Marlene Wasden on August 15, 1932 in Las Vegas, Nevada, and started working in the entertainment field as a teen magazine cover model, also appearing at times on record album jackets. An acting company member for writer/producer Roger Corman beginning in 1957, Abby made her dubious debut in the low-grade beatnik film, Rock All Night (1957), in which she and others are trapped and held hostage in a bar by a pair of killers. Corman continued to use her in his films, some with and some without billing, including Teenage Doll (1957), Carnival Rock (1957), Rauschgift (1958), and the absurdly-titled The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent (1957), in which she played Desir, a stalwart leader of Nordic women in search for men, after presumably losing their own at sea. Outside the Corman fold, she appeared in the equally low-budgeted and exploitable Die Draufgänger von San Fernando (1958) and Asphalt-Hyänen (1958). The blonde, toothy beauty fared much better on TV starting in the late 1950s, popping up on several TV's best known westerns (Have Gun - Will Travel (1957), Tausend Meilen Staub (1959), Maverick (1957), Westlich von Santa Fe (1958), Sugarfoot (1957)). She eventually earned a steady role on Jackie Cooper's Hennesey (1959) series and both actors received Emmy nominations for their roles -- she playing his girlfriend. The TV couple \"married\" just before the demise of the sitcom in 1962. A higher degree of visibility was achieved when Abby won the role of Joey Bishop's pert-looking wife on The Joey Bishop Show (1961). She gave birth to a TV baby in 1963 (played by her real-life infant son, Matthew David Smith). Her daughter, Kathleen Kinmont, also appeared on the program. Following the end of its four-season run, Abby engaged more fans to her corner by appearing regularly on the game show circuit. She showed off a delightfully off-the-cuff humor and sexy edge as a mainstay panelist, alongside Cliff Arquette, Wally Cox, and Rose Marie, on The Hollywood Squares (Daytime) (1965) and was located in the lower middle square for about four seasons before leaving her then-permanent post in 1970. During that time, she also played the \"straight woman\" in a number of sketch sequences for Jonathan Winters on his show, playing Margaret, his wife. The series, however, was rather short-lived (1967-1969). The only film she made during the 1960s was as \"Calamity Jane\" opposite Don Murray's Wild Bill Hickok and Guy Stockwell's Buffalo Bill Cody in a lackluster remake of the Gary Cooper starrer, Tausend Gewehre für Golden Hill (1966). For the most part, she focused on TV. Abby continued to be seen here and there throughout the 1970s. She might have enjoyed a major career boost as Hal Linden wife, Elizabeth, in the pilot of sitcom favorite Barney Miller (1975) had she stayed with it, but she was replaced by Barbara Barrie, when the show was picked up for its first season. Abby became part of the original cast of Falcon Crest (1981), a prime-time soap. As winery heiress Julia Cumson, Jane Wyman's daughter and Lorenzo Lamas' mother, she eventually shows her true colors as a murderous schemer. Coincidentally, Abby's daughter, actress Kathleen Kinmont, was later married for a time to \"Falcon Crest\" star Lorenzo Lamas. After leaving the show, she was seen only sporadically on TV and in films, including a short stint on a daytime soap. Her work continued until 1999, though she remained active in volunteer work. Twice married, her second to Jack Smith in 1960, produced three children, including daughter/actress Kathleen and son Matthew David. Her first marriage to Joe Mondragon ended in divorce in 1959.\n\nAdam West was born William West Anderson on September 19, 1928 in Walla Walla, Washington, to parents Otto West Anderson, a farmer, and his wife Audrey V. (Speer), an opera singer. At age 10, in 1938, West had a cache of comic books; and starting in 1939, Batman, who appeared in Detective Comics, made a big impression on him--the comic hero was part bat-man (a la Count Dracula) and part world's greatest detective (a la Charlie Chan and Sherlock Holmes). When his mother remarried to a Dr. Paul Flothow, she took West and his younger brother, John, to Seattle. At age 14, West attended Lakeside School, then went to Whitman College, where he got a degree in literature and psychology. During his last year of college, he married 17-year-old Billie Lou Yeager.\n\nWest got a job as a disc jockey at a local radio station, then enrolled at Stanford for post-grad courses. Drafted into the army, he spent the next two years starting military television stations, first at San Luis Obispo, California, then at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. Afterwards, West and his wife toured Europe, visiting Germany, Switzerland and Italy's Isle of Capri. When the money ran out, he joined a childhood and college buddy, Carl Hebenstreit, who was starring in the kiddie program \"The Kini Popo Show\" in Hawaii. West would eventually replace Carl but not the other star, Peaches the Chimp. In 1956, he got a divorce and married a beautiful girl, originally from Tahiti, named Ngatokoruaimatauaia Frisbie Dawson (he called her \"Nga\" for short). They had a daughter, Jonelle (born 1957), and a son, Hunter (born 1958). In 1959, West came to Hollywood. He adopted the stage name \"Adam West\", which fit his roles, as he was in some westerns.\n\nAfter seven years in Tinseltown, he achieved fame in his signature role as Bruce Wayne / Batman, on the wildly popular ABC-TV series Batman (1966) (though he has over 60 movie and over 80 television guest appearance credits, \"Batman\" is what the fans remember him for). The series, which lasted three seasons, made him not just nationally but internationally famous. The movie version, Batman hält die Welt in Atem (1966), earned West the \"Most Promising New Star\" award in 1967. The downside was that the \"Batman\" fame was partly responsible for ruining his marriage, and he was typecast and almost unemployable for a while after the series ended (he did nothing but personal appearances for two years).\n\nIn 1970, he met and then married Marcelle Tagand Lear, and picked up two stepchildren, Moya and Jill. In addition, they had two children of their own: Nina West in 1976 and Perrin in 1979. You can't keep a good actor down--West's career took off again, and he appeared in 50 projects after that: movies, television movies and sometimes doing voices on television series. West wrote his autobiography, \"Back to the Batcave\" (1994). One of his most prized possessions was a drawing of Batman by Bob Kane with the inscription \"To my buddy, Adam, who breathed life into my pen and ink creation\". Beginning in 2000, West made guest appearances on the animated series Family Guy (1999), on which he played Mayor Adam West, the lunatic mayor of Quahog, Rhode Island.\n\nOn June 9, 2017, Adam West died at age 88 after a brief battle with leukemia in Los Angeles, California. On June 15, 2017, Los Angeles shone the bat-signal on City Hall, and Walla Walla shone the bat-signal on the Whitman Tower, both as a tribute to West.\n\nAlbert was born on June 24, 1919 to Raffaele Molinaro and Teresa Marrone. His father was born in Calabria, Italy and immigrated to the US when he was 15 years old and worked as a water boy with a railroad crew going west from New York. He ended up in Kenosha Wisconsin where he met and married Albert's mother Teresa on December 22, 1901. His father named Albert after his favorite Italian Prince, Umberto II who was born 15 years earlier. A school teacher later suggested that \"Albert\" might be more suitable. His mother chose his middle name Fransico after Santo Francisco since he was born on Saint Francis Day. The midwife who's English was only slightly better than Albert's parents spelled his middle name with a feminine \"A\" at the end which was never corrected. His legal named remained Umberto Francisca Molinaro. He was the ninth child of what would later become a family of ten children, eight boys and 2 girls. At 19 years of age Albert became a union leader at the Vincent-McCall furniture spring factory after working there for only 4 months. He later became the special assistant to the Kenosha City Manager when he was 20. At this time Albert's best friend from Kenosha, Mills Tenuta, who had moved to Southern California to work in an aircraft plant, began harassing him to come out to Hollywood. He was sure that Albert could be a movie star. Albert left a promising career with the city after only a year to head to Hollywood to become an actor. Albert had many jobs while pursuing his acting career. His first job was at Reginald Denny's Hobby shop in Hollywood. He spent 2 years as a live action animator at George Pal's studios. If Technicolor hadn't gone on a sympathy strike with the Studio Carpenters union he might have spent his career as an animator. He managed the M&G Grand Variety Store for a year and then became a bill collector for the \"Collection Agency of America\" in downtown LA. He quickly learned the art of bill collecting and was able to become a salesman who procured collection accounts for another agency which he later purchased. This gave him flexible hours and a steady income so he could focus again on his dreams of Hollywood. Even after his acting career took off he kept his Bill Collection business until he retired. Albert married Jacqueline Martin in 1948. They moved into a home in Granada Hills, CA and adopted their son Michael Molinaro. Albert and Jacqueline were divorced in 1980. Albert then married Betty Sedillos in 1981 and they lived in Glendale CA until his death in 2015. Albert had two step children, Jim Sedillos & Victoria Sedillos and a total of 6 grandchildren and 2 great-grand children. Albert's movie debut happened when he was 25 years old. After appearing as the lead in a Chekhov play called \"The Bear\" at the old Sartu Theater that used to be on the corner of Hollywood Blvd. and La Brea Ave. A movie producer saw the performance and cast him in a picture that had three separate stories, one of the stories was Chekhov's play \"The Bear\" but changed from a Russian setting to a Spanish locale. The movie was titled \"Love Me Madly\". Albert was not told that some of the scenes they shot without him were R rated in today's standards but X rated for 1954's standards. He was surprised and upset during the movies premiere and vowed to never again be in a film that his mother couldn't watch. During the early 1950's Albert began producing live television shows for local televisions stations channel 5 KTLA, channel 9 KHJ & channel 11 KTTV. He Co-created \"Insomnia\" a late night live show and a \"Ski Show\" in which Warren Miller allowed him to use some of his skiing footage. He created \"Star Finder\" a pre-teen amateur show, \"Square Dance Party\" and \"The Tiny Late Show\" which was his own late night one man show that filled the few minutes of time between the end of the late night movie and the station signing off for the night.\n\nAll the time Albert was working to pay his bills he was also acting in small plays in theaters all over Hollywood. After 25 years of theater acting he was convinced to play a small part in a play directed by his friend, Leo Matranga, at the Hollywood Horseshoe Theater. After the show, a commercial agent named Don Schwartz offered to represent him. Albert swore off acting and never called Don. One year later, Don called Albert telling him that he already set up an appointment for him and convinced him to audition for a national commercial. Albert got the commercial for the Volvo 140. You can see his commercial debut on youtube \"Volvo 140 advertising\". It's 3 min. & 30 seconds into the video (they have strung many vintage Volvo ads together). Take a look at his first commercial and you will see the face that went on to land over 100 commercials. 42 of them were nationals. He also landed a 10 year deal with \"Encore\" frozen dinners becoming their spokesperson. A friend from George Pal's Studios named Glenn Grossman cast Albert whenever he could in the industrial films that he would make from time to time. It was while working on one of Glenn's films that Albert met another working actor named Harvey Lembeck. When Harvey wasn't acting he ran an actor's workshop. Harvey convinced Albert that he could help him with his comedy timing. Gary Marshall's sister Penny was also a member of Harvey's workshop. One night Penny asked her brother to come down and see Albert. Gary was in the process of producing a movie starring Jacquiline Bissett called \"The Grasshopper\" and wanted Al to play the part of a truck driver. Albert did not play the part because the shooting dates conflicted with a Pepto-Bismol commercial he was scheduled to shoot in Phoenix. A year later, when Albert learned from his writer friend, John Rappaport, that Garry Marshall was casting for The Odd Couple TV show, John convinced him that he would be perfect to play one of the poker players. Albert first refused to call Gary but John badgered him enough to finally make him call. Albert made numerous phone calls but got no response so he decided to dress up like a delivery man and deliver a 2'x3' card with many pictures of himself glued to it stating that \"Al Molinaro is a Poker Player. ...Assorted Poker Faces ... More faces available upon demand. Just Call (his Phone #) Dear Gary, If you don't call me for an audition, I'll put a curse on you to make you sterile for life. Sincerely, Al Molinaro. The delivery outfit did not get him past the guard at the Paramount gate but it did get the card delivered and Albert got an audition and landed the part of Murray the Cop. Later, Gary stated that, \"Although we thought Albert was wrong for the part, we decided to take a chance on Al because of all the men who we auditioned, he was the funniest. Albert spent 5 years on The Odd Couple and when it finished, due to the fact that Jack Klugman wanted to do drama, he was offered the roll of the Malt Shop Owner on Gary's new show \"Happy Days\". Albert turned down the role feeling he did not want to work with a \"bunch of kids\". After the first season of Happy Days, Pat Morita, who was cast in the role of the malt shop owner, was offered his own show so Gary once again asked Albert to work on the show. Albert asked Gary that if he didn't like working on the show, could he quit whenever he wanted. Gary said he couldn't put that in writing but that they would shake on it. Albert enjoyed 10 years on \"Happy Days\" from 1974 to 1984 and 1 more year on \"Joanie Loves Chachi. He guest starred on many television shows during and after the filming of the Odd Couple and Happy Days. He also worked on a short lived sitcom called \"The Family Man\" from 1990-1991 but decided to stop taking roles by the mid 90's. He completed his 10 year contract with Encore Frozen Foods and as his last job he surprisingly accepted an offer to be in a music video with Wheezer.\n\nAlbert was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in the mid 90's and lived with the illness for 20 years. Early diagnosis and careful medication allowed Albert to enjoy life until he had a small heart attack in May of 2015. He was a wonderfully kind man. He taught himself to play the piano, clarinet and ukulele and even had a few real gigs in Reno playing the clarinet in his youth. His family believes that his improvisational skills allowed him to mask his Alzheimer's disease from most people until just before he died. He continued to personally answer his fan mail until his health did not allow it. In June he celebrated his 96th birthday but he was declining quickly. He developed a gall stones and due to his age and the recent heart attack, surgery was not recommended. Albert died on October 30th 2015.\n\nBorn Alexander Viespi, Jr. in Floral Park, New York in 1933, handsome, often mustachioed Alex Cord was stricken with polio at the age of 12. Confined to a hospital and iron lung for a long time, he overcame the illness after being sent to a Wyoming ranch for therapy. He soon regained his dream and determination of becoming a jockey or professional horseman.\n\nA high school dropout at the age of sixteen, he grew up to be too tall to be a jockey so he joined the rodeo circuit and earned a living riding bulls and bareback horses. During another extended hospital stay, this time suffering major injuries after being thrown by a bull at a rodeo in New York City's Madison Square Garden, he reevaluated his life's direction and decided to finish his high school education by way of night school. A voracious reader during his long convalescence, he later studied and received his degree in literature at New York University.\n\nProdded by an interest in acting, Alex received dramatic training at the Actors Studio and began his professional career in summer stock (The Compass Players in St. Louis, Missouri) and at the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Connecticut where he played \"Laertes\" in a production of \"Hamlet\". A British producer saw his promise and invited him to London where he co-starred in four plays (\"Play With a Tiger\", \"The Rose Tattoo\", \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" and \"The Umbrella\"). He was nominated for the \"Best Actor Award\" by the London Critics' Circle for the first-mentioned play.\n\nHe sought a Hollywood \"in\" and found one via his equestrian skills in the early 1960s. Steady work came to him on such established western TV series as Am Fuß der Blauen Berge (1959) and Geächtet (1965) and that extended itself into acting roles on crime action series (Route 66 (1960) and Gnadenlose Stadt (1958)). Gaining a foothold in feature films within a relatively short time, he starred or co-starred in more than 30 feature films, including Die Gierigen (1965), San Fernando (1966), Stiletto (1969) and Auftrag Mord (1968).\n\nAfter his film career declined in the late 1970s he turned to action adventure overseas with the \"spaghetti western\" Mehr tot als lebendig (1967) [A Minute to Pray, A Second to Die] and the British war drama The Last Grenade (1970) with Stanley Baker and Richard Attenborough. Around that time as well, he played the murderer opposite Sam Jaffe's old man in Edgar Allan Poe's dramatic short, The Tell-Tale Heart (1971). It was TV, however, that provided more career stability. Cord has more than 300 credits, including roles in Hotel (1983), Fantasy Island (1977), Simon und Simon (1981), Jake und McCabe - Durch dick und dünn (1987), Kobra, übernehmen Sie (1966), Walker, Texas Ranger (1993) and Mord ist ihr Hobby (1984). He situated himself in a number of series, notably Airwolf (1984), in which he co-starred with Jan-Michael Vincent and Ernest Borgnine as the mysterious white-suited, eye-patched, cane-using \"Michael Archangel\".\n\nLater commercial interest was drawn from his title role in Grauadler (1977), a remake of the John Wayne film, Der schwarze Falke (1956), in which he played the Indian kidnapper of Ben Johnson's daughter. Lana Wood, sister of star Natalie Wood (who appeared in the original), also co-starred in this film. Alex can still be seen from time to time in low-budget films and the occasional television appearance, but other interests took up his time. His last film role was in the dismissible thriller Fire from Below (2009) in support of Kevin Sorbo.\n\nAlex's love for horses extended itself into work for numerous charities and benefits. He was a regular competitor in the Ben Johnson Pro-Celebrity Rodeos that raised money for children's charities, and he is one of the founders of the Chukkers for Charity Celebrity Polo Team which has raised more than $3 million for worthy causes. He chairs \"Ahead with Horses\", an organization that provides therapeutic riding programs for the physically and emotionally challenged. Alex also turned to writing, thus far publishing several novels including A Feather in the Rain (2005), Days of the Harbinger (2013), The Man Who Would Be God (2014 and High Moon (2016). He has also sold three screenplays.\n\nThe actor's three marriages all ended in divorce. His second wife was British-born actress Joanna Pettet and third, Susannah, was a horse trainer. He had three children -- Toni Aluisa, Wayne and Damien Zachary. His son by Pettet, Damien, died tragically in 1995 of a heroin overdose at the age of 26.\n\nTough, gruff, thick-browed, volatile-looking character actor Alex Rocco was born Alessandro Federico Petricone, Jr. on February 29, 1936, to Italian immigrants in Cambridge, Mass. He grew up a member of Boston's Winter Hill gang (his nickname was \"Bobo\") and was briefly detained regarding a murder at one point after an alleged personal incident triggered the Boston Irish Gang War (1961-1967). Rocco decided to straighten his life and relocated to Hollywood in 1962 following his detainment and release.\n\nDeveloping an interest in acting, Alex initially trained with such notable teachers as Leonard Nimoy and Jeff Corey in order to curb his thick Boston accent. Working as a bartender during the lean years, his film and TV career finally kick-started in 1965, immediately relying on his sly, lethal menace, toothy toughness, and prior gangland past to realistically portray gritty anti-heroes and villains. He made an effective movie debut, co-starring as a vengeful veterinarian and Vietnam vet who goes after motorcycle \"bad boys\" following his wife's beating and rape in the exploitation flick Motorpsycho - Wie wilde Hengste (1965) directed by Russ Meyer. Despite this bold beginning, it was followed by a disappointing gangster bit in Chicago-Massaker (1967) and a nothing role as a police Lieutenant in Der Frauenmörder von Boston (1968). On TV, he found sporadic work playing thugs and other unsavory types on such TV shows as \"Run for Your Life,\" \"Batman\" and \"Get Smart.\"\n\nRocco came into his own in the early 1970s. After featured roles in such violent exploitation like Porno Mania (1970) and Des Teufels tolle Hunde (1971), he received a huge boost in an Oscar-winning \"A\" film. He made a brief but potent impact essaying the role of Las Vegas syndicate boss Moe Green who gets a bullet in the eye during the violently explosive \"christening sequence\" of Mario Puzo's Der Pate (1972). From there he found a comfortable supporting niche playing various swarthy-looking cronies, hoods and cops in such crime films as Brutale Schatten (1972), Schleuderpartie (1973), Die Freunde von Eddie Coyle (1973) (in which he made good use of his Boston criminal past), Der Superschnüffler (1974), Drei eiskalte Profis (1974) and A Woman for All Men (1975). Similar urban roles followed him on TV with yeoman work on such 1970s cop shows as \"The Rookies\", \"Get Christie Love\", \"Kojak\", \"Cannon\", \"The Blue Knight\", \"Police Story\", \"The Rockford Files\", \"Barnaby Jones\", \"Dog and Cat\", \"Baretta\", \"Starsky and Hutch\", \"Delvecchio\", \"CHiPs\", \"Matt Houston\", \"Hardcastle and McCormick\", and \"Simon & Simon\", along with the TV movies or miniseries Eingekreist (1978), The Gangster Chronicles (1981) and Das As im Ärmel (1985).\n\nIn the midst of all this, Alex was handed the starring role of his own series Three for the Road (1975) in which he played a new widower photographer with two teenage sons (played by Vincent Van Patten and Leif Garrett) who assuage their grief by leaving town and \"discovering America\" together. Although well-received, it was short-lived (13 episodes) as a result of poor scheduling. The actor returned to series TV in the late 1980s and was much more successful as a slick Hollywood agent in The Famous Teddy Z (1989) for which he won a \"Supporting Actor\" Emmy Award. Other regular comedy series work, such as Keine wie die andere (1991), The George Carlin Show (1994), Lady Cops - Knallhart weiblich (2001) and Magic City (2012), added to his healthy resume over the years, with over 400 TV appearances racked up in all. Recurring roles on such programs as Die Simpsons (1989) and The Facts of Life (1979) (as Nancy McKeon's father) also kept his career going at a steady pace. Other memorably flashy film roles include Der Superschnüffler (1974), Der lange Tod des Stuntman Cameron (1980), Die phantastische Reise ins Jenseits (1988), Schnappt Shorty (1995) and Just Write - Alles aus Liebe (1997).\n\nTwice married, Rocco's first wife, Sandra Garrett, a nightclub performer and screenwriter, died of cancer in 2002. He married actress Shannon Wilcox in 2005 and together they appeared in the film Scammerhead (2014). Rocco appeared in two films helmed by his adopted son, screenwriter and director Marc Rocco: Scenes from the Goldmine (1987) and Dream a Little Dream (1989), who died in 2009. Two other children by his first wife were Lucian, a poet, and Jennifer, an attorney. Alex Rocco died of pancreatic cancer on July 18, 2015 at age 79.\n\nStatuesque, smart Canadian-born Alexis Smith, with her blue/green eyes and a seductively husky voice, lent a touch of class to her leading ladies of the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nAfter her family moved to California, Alexis grew into a precocious talent and performed ballet in public by the age of thirteen -- dancing to 'Carmen' at the Hollywood Bowl. She later graduated with a degree in drama from Los Angeles City College having previously won an acting contest whilst still in high school. During a performance of a play on campus she was spotted by a Warner Brothers talent scout and signed to a contract in 1941. Until the early 1950s she was paired with the top male stars in Hollywood, including Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart, William Holden and Bing Crosby. While often simply decorative (as, for example, in Of Human Bondage (1946) and Stallion Road (1947)), stylishly attired by costume designers like Milo Anderson and Helen Rose in the most glamorous gowns, Alexis also proved to be a capable and spirited actress in spite of relatively few opportunities to break out of the mold of \"the other woman\".\n\nEarly on in her screen career the studio's publicity department touted Alexis -- much to her chagrin -- as the \"Dynamite Girl\". While she claimed in later years to have typecast herself (saying that few of her assigned roles ever challenged her on any level) Alexis nonetheless enjoyed good critical reviews for many of her performances. She was also popular with directors and film crews who appreciated her relaxed, professional manner on the set. Commencing her Hollywood tenure, she was cast in two films with Errol Flynn (she would make a total of four films with him): Dive Bomber (1941) and the boxing drama Der freche Kavalier (1942). Though decidedly second fiddle to both the action and the charismatic Flynn, Alexis made a good first impression as the fetching romantic interest. Her next performance, in Jungfräuliche Liebe (1943) opposite Charles Boyer, was described by a reviewer as an \"intelligent rendition\". Her biggest hit of the mid-1940s was as Cole Porter's wife in the inaccurate--but hugely successful--biopic Tag und Nacht denk' ich an dich (1946). She also appeared in two \"noir\" films with Humphrey Bogart at his most menacing: the interesting and underrated Konflikt (1945) and the excellent Die zwei Mrs. Carrolls (1947). As Clark Gable's wife in the gambling drama Hoher Einsatz (1949) she was critically lauded as \"genuinely appealing\". In between, there were also some conspicuous failures, in particular her rather stolid performance in the period drama Das Geheimnis der Frau in Weiß (1948). She had little to do in Hochzeitsparade (1951) and The Turning Point (1952) and her best part in the 1950s, though small, was that of Carol Wharton in Der Mann aus Philadelphia (1959).\n\nDuring the 1960s, Alexis took a sabbatical from the screen to appear on stage with her husband, actor Craig Stevens (her marriage, a rare Hollywood success, lasted 49 years) in \"Critic's Choice\", \"Cactus Flower\" and \"Mary, Mary\". She reserved her best acting for the stage, becoming the Tony Award-winning star of Stephen Sondheim's musical \"Follies\" in which she played Phyllis during the 1971 run on Broadway (which landed her on the cover of the May 3 issue of 'Time' Magazine) and at the Shubert Theatre in Los Angeles in 1972. In 1973, she played Sylvia Fowler in a revival of Clare Boothe Luce's \"The Women\" and was nominated for another Tony for her leading role of Lila Halliday in \"Platinum\" in 1979.\n\nAlexis was seen infrequently on television from the mid-'50s, sometimes appearing on the same show opposite her husband. She had a recurring role as the homicidal Lady Jessica Montfort in Dallas (1978) during the 1984 and 1990 seasons and was nominated for an Emmy for a guest-starring role on Cheers (1982). It was fitting, or perhaps ironic, that her last film role in Zeit der Unschuld (1993) was as a New York socialite, the kind of stereotypical persona she had portrayed so often in her heyday at Warners.\n\nNew York Times Best Selling author of \"Confessions of A Prairie Bitch: How I Survived Nellie Oleson and Learned to Love Being Hated\", Alison Arngrim is best known to viewers world-wide for her portrayal of the incredibly nasty \"Nellie Oleson\" on the much loved, long running hit television series \"Little House On The Prairie,\" and continues to amuse audiences through her many film, television, stage and multi-media appearances.\n\nHer one woman show \"Confessions of a Prairie Bitch\", which started at Club Fez in New York in 2002, has now become a world-wide phenomenon, having been performed to packed houses in New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, Green Bay, San Francisco, Seattle, and in France, where Alison performs entirely in French to standing room only crowds in her all French version titled: \"Confessions d'une Garce de La Prairie\" and \"La Malle aux Tresors de Nellie Oleson.\"\n\nAs a stand-up comedian, Alison has headlined at nightclubs such as the Laugh Factory, the Comedy Store and the Improv in Los Angeles; as well as the Laurie Beechman Theatre in New York and assorted comedy venues all across the United States and Canada.\n\nShe is currently starring in two comedy series pilots: \"Life Interrupted\", as the ex-wife of commercial child star Mason Reese, with Erin Murphy, (\"Bewitched\") as her new wife and Dawn Wells, (\"Gilligan's Island), as her mother, as well as, \"C.P.R. - Child Performers Resurrection Talent Agency\", as an ex-child star gone wrong, trying to save herself and her assorted misfit cohorts by opening a talent agency.\n\nShe recently fulfilled a childhood dream to be in a horror movie, with her role as \"Leeza\", the somewhat ambivalent Satanic high priestess in the new supernatural web series \"The Mephisto Box\".\n\nAlison has mocked her status as an \"ex-child star\" on Jay Leno's Tonight Show, during their month long parody, \"Hollywood Survivor\" and continues to be a frequent interview subject on everything from \"A&E\", \"E! Entertainment\", \"TV Land\" and \"VH-1\", to CNN and the Travel Channel. The TV Land network honored her undying image as TV's worst bitch, by declaring her the winner of their 2006 award for, \"Character Most Desperately In Need Of A Time Out\".\n\nShe starred in the heartwarming, gay, Christmas cult classic, \"Make the Yuletide Gay\", as the overbearing \"Heather Mancuso\". Her other television and film appearances include, \"Livin' the Dream\", \"Tinder & Grinder\", \"The Bilderberg Club\", \"For the Love of May\" with Ru Paul and Patricia Neal, and \"The Last Place On Earth\" with Billy Dee Williams and Phyllis Diller. In 2007, she began her foray into French cinema with the role of \"Edith\" in the French detective comedy, Jean Pierre Mocky's \"Le Deal\".\n\nAlison's stage work includes, \"The Vagina Monologs\", \"Sirena: Queen of the Tango\", \"Dear Brutus\", \"The Wool Gatherer\", the French bedroom farce, \"In One Bed And Out The Other\", Michael Kearns' \"AIDS/US II\", \"Rita\" in the 2005 GLAAD Award nominated production of \"Last Summer At Bluefish Cove\", \", the somewhat off kilter \"Reverend Pat Miass\" in \"Joni and Gina's Wedding\", and the Ovation Award Nominated musical-drama, \"Flirting with Morty\", as the abusive, trashy and tragic Ray Lee.\n\nIn her spare time, she takes tourists on the rollicking comedy outing, \"Nasty Nellie's Tour of Hollywood\", (featured at Dearly Departed Tours), where she simultaneously enlightens and amuses passengers with behind the scenes tales from both Hollywood history and her own life.\n\nNever one to forget her \"Prairie\" roots, Alison enjoys making appearances several times a year at various \"Little House on the Prairie\" historical sites for educational events and gatherings of fans. She has been a frequent visitor to the Laura Ingalls Wilder Museum in the real life Walnut Grove, Minnesota as well as Green Bay, Wisconsin's Heritage Hills, Mumford's Genesee Country Village, Laura Ingalls Wilder Historic Home and Museum in Mansfield, Missouri and many, many others.\n\nAlison has a long history of activism. In 1986 when her friend and \"Little House husband\" co-star, Steve Tracy, passed away due to complications of HIV/AIDS, Alison immediately began volunteering at AIDS Project Los Angeles. Her duties ranged from working on the Southern California AIDS Hotline and the APLA food bank, (APLA's Necessities of Life Program,) to chairing the steering committee of the volunteer speakers bureau and developing \"Safer Sex\" workshops. She has provided AIDS education to doctors, nurses, prison inmates, service clubs, churches, department stores and schools, written AIDS education articles for the magazines \"Frontiers\" and \"Designers West\", and spent seven years hosting the APLA educational cable television show, \"AIDS Vision\". In 1992, Joel Wachs presented Alison with a resolution by the Los Angeles City Council commending her on her work on behalf of people living with HIV and AIDS.\n\nFrom 1989 through 1993 she served as Program Manager at Tuesday's Child, an organization assisting children and families affected by HIV and AIDS. From 1989 through 2003 she served as both hostess and producer for the comedy stage at the AIDS Project Los Angeles Annual Summer Party, (on the back-lot of Universal Studios), where through an evening of raucous entertainment, featuring name comedians, she helped to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for people living with HIV.\n\nShe currently serves as California Chair, National Spokesperson and Founding Board Member on the National Advisory Board of The National Association to Protect Children, or PROTECT.org, fighting to give children a legal and political voice in the war against child abuse. As an activist for the improvement of child protection laws, she has spoken before the California Senate and worked on legislative and political campaigns in several states, including Virginia and New York, in addition to PROTECT's work on federal legislation in Washington, D.C.\n\nShe has appeared on numerous television news programs discussing the legal and political issues surrounding child sexual abuse and exploitation. She came forward to tell the world about the sexual abuse she suffered in her own life, during her 2004 interview on Larry King Live.\n\nShe continues to be interviewed on this and other topics on Nancy Grace, CNN's Showbiz Tonight, The Insider, Court TV, and Bill O'Reilly's The Factor. Alison currently lives somewhere in the wilds of Tujunga with her husband of over twenty years, musician Bob Schoonover, (from the rock and roll band \"Catahoula\") and their evil cat, Clarice. She takes pride in the fact that so many people enjoyed hating her as a girl and is more than happy to give them the opportunity to do so in the future."
