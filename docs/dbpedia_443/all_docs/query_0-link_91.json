        "text": "Tag: Edmund C. Berkeley\n\n1953 – “Franken” Maze-Solving Machine – Ivan and Bert Sutherland\n\nFRANKEN The original Franken maze solver was designed and built by Bert and Ivan Sutherland. I suspect it was built for Edmund C. Berkeley. Berkeley , it appears, had used the early version as a prototype, and engaged his other associates, namely Bob Jensen, Juli Skalski and Stan Skalski in drawing up a revised document suitable for …\n\nRead More “1953 – “Franken” Maze-Solving Machine – Ivan and Bert Sutherland”\n\n1951 – James the Intelligent Robot – Edmund C. Berkeley (American)\n\nDespite his attempts in trying, as seen in the attached documents, I don't believe Edmund C. Berkeley ever realized the construction of James the intelligent robot. Specification of James: A man-like robot, with six sound tracks, a load speaker, and three or four sensory organs, which will seem to respond intelligently. – For rent to …\n\nRead More “1951 – James the Intelligent Robot – Edmund C.

Berkeley quite well. Berkeley had two young associates working part-time with him on his early robots, by the names of Ivan and Bert Sutherland. Ivan was soon to have Claude Shannon as his Thesis supervisor. Berkeley was keen …\n\nRead More “1950 – Maze-Solving Mouse – Claude Shannon (American)”\n\n1957 – Machina Versatilis – Ivan Sutherland (American)\n\nIvan Sutherland with M. Versatilis. Source: Carnegie Mellon University Archives Machina Versatilis , pictured above and below, was so named due to the versatile modular plug-in boards. M. Versatilis was the final of three models built, and at least two of this model were supposedly built. The first version, see blog post here, was originally built in …\n\nRead More “1957 – Machina Versatilis – Ivan Sutherland (American)”\n\nW. Grey Walter, Edmund C. Berkeley, Ivan E. Sutherland and the Tortoise\n\nWho is Ivan E. Sutherland? Ivan was born in 1938, Nebraska, USA and is a computer pioneer, inventing Sketchpad, being the first what we now call a Graphical User Interface (GUI). He also built a walking machine, but that will be the subject to another post later. As an under-graduate student, Ivan, with his elder brother …\n\nRead More “W. Grey Walter, Edmund C.
