        "text": "Biography\n\nSutherland earned his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University), his master's degree from Caltech, and his Ph.D. from MIT in EECS in 1963.\n\nHe invented Sketchpad in 1962 while at MIT. Professor Claude Shannon signed on to supervise Sutherland’s computer drawing Thesis. Among others on his thesis committee were Marvin Minsky and Steven Coons. Sketchpad was an innovative program that influenced alternative forms of interaction with computers. Sketchpad could accept constraints and specified relationships among segments and arcs, including the diameter of arcs. It could draw both horizontal and vertical lines and combine them into figures and shapes. Figures could be copied, moved, rotated, or resized, retaining their basic properties. Sketchpad also had the first window-drawing program and clipping algorithm, which allowed zooming. Sketchpad ran on the Lincoln TX-2 computer and influenced Douglas Engelbart's oN-Line System. Sketchpad, in turn, was influenced by the conceptual Memex as envisioned by Vannevar Bush in his influential paper \"As We May Think\".\n\nSutherland replaced J. C. R. Licklider as the head of the US Defense Department Advanced Research Project Agency's Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO), when Licklider returned to MIT in 1964.\n\nFrom 1965 to 1968, Sutherland was an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering at Harvard University. Work with student Danny Cohen in 1967 led to the development of the Cohen–Sutherland computer graphics line clipping algorithm. In 1968, with the help of his student Bob Sproull, he created the first virtual reality and augmented reality head-mounted display system, named The Sword of Damocles.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1974, Sutherland was a professor at the University of Utah. Among his students there were Alan Kay, inventor of the Smalltalk language, Henri Gouraud, who devised the Gouraud shading technique, Frank Crow, who went on to develop antialiasing methods, and Edwin Catmull, computer graphics scientist, co-founder of Pixar and now President of Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios.\n\nIn 1968 he co-founded Evans and Sutherland with his friend and colleague David C. Evans. The company has done pioneering work in the field of real-time hardware, accelerated 3D computer graphics, and printer languages. Former employees of Evans and Sutherland included the future founders of Adobe (John Warnock) and Silicon Graphics (Jim Clark).\n\nFrom 1974 to 1978 he was the Fletcher Jones Professor of Computer science at California Institute of Technology, where he was the founding head of that school's Computer Science department. He then founded a consulting firm, Sutherland, Sproull and Associates, which was purchased by Sun Microsystems to form the seed of its research division, Sun Labs.\n\nSutherland was a Fellow and Vice President at Sun Microsystems. Sutherland was a visiting scholar in the Computer Science Division at University of California, Berkeley (Fall 2005–Spring 2008). On May 28, 2006, Ivan Sutherland married Marly Roncken. Sutherland and Marly Roncken are leading the research in Asynchronous Systems at Portland State University.\n\nHe has two children, Juliet and Dean, and four grandchildren, Belle, Robert, William and Rose. Ivan's elder brother, Bert Sutherland, is also a prominent computer science researcher.\n\nAwards\n\nComputer History Museum Fellow \"for the Sketchpad computer-aided design system and for lifelong contributions to computer graphics and education,\" 2005\n\nR&D 100 Award, 2004 (team)\n\nIEEE John von Neumann Medal, 1998\n\nThe Franklin Institute's Certificate of Merit, 1996\n\nAssociation for Computing Machinery Fellow, 1994\n\nElectronic Frontier Foundation EFF Pioneer Award, 1994\n\nACM Software System Award, 1993\n\nTuring Award, 1988\n\nComputerworld Honors Program, Leadership Award, 1987\n\nIEEE Emanuel R. Piore Award, 1986\n\nMember, United States National Academy of Sciences, 1978\n\nNational Academy of Engineering member, 1973\n\nNational Academy of Engineering First Zworykin Award, 1972\n\nCyberEdge Journal Virtual Reality Pioneer Award, 1996\n\nKyoto Prize 2012, in the category of advanced technology.\n\nNational Inventors Hall of Fame Inductee 2016.\n\nQuotes\n\n\"A display connected to a digital computer gives us a chance to gain familiarity with concepts not realizable in the physical world. It is a looking glass into a mathematical wonderland.\"\n\n\"The ultimate display would, of course, be a room within which the computer can control the existence of matter. A chair displayed in such a room would be good enough to sit in. Handcuffs displayed in such a room would be confining, and a bullet displayed in such a room would be fatal.\"\n\nWhen asked, \"How could you possibly have done the first interactive graphics program, the first non-procedural programming language, the first object oriented software system, all in one year?\" Ivan replied: \"Well, I didn't know it was hard.\"\n\n\"It’s not an idea until you write it down.\"\n\n\"Without the fun, none of us would go on!\"\n\nPatents\n\nSutherland has more than 60 patents, including:\n\nUS Patent 7,636,361 (2009) Apparatus and method for high-throughput asynchronous communication with flow control\n\nUS Patent 7,417,993 (2008) Apparatus and method for high-throughput asynchronous communication\n\nUS Patent 7,384,804 (2008) Method and apparatus for electronically aligning capacitively coupled mini-bars\n\nUS patent 3,889,107 (1975) System of polygon sorting by dissection\n\nUS patent 3,816,726 (1974) Computer Graphics Clipping System for Polygons\n\nUS patent 3,732,557 (1973) Incremental Position-Indicating System\n\nUS patent 3,684,876 (1972) Vector Computing System as for use in a Matrix Computer\n\nUS patent 3,639,736 (1972) Display Windowing by Clipping\n\nPublications\n\nSketchPad, 2004 from \"CAD software – history of CAD CAM\" by CADAZZ\n\nSutherland's 1963 Ph.D. Thesis from Massachusetts Institute of Technology republished in 2003 by University of Cambridge as Technical Report Number 574, Sketchpad, A Man-Machine Graphical Communication System.
