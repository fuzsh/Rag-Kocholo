        "text": "Why stay with us?\n\nStyle and character are everything at Oliver’s Travels, and our collection of handpicked villas in Dordogne have this in spades.\n\nWe have destination experts who know the ins and outs of all our regions, picking villas that aren’t only unique, but also in the best locations. What's more, our villas are 100% family-friendly, and have the ‘wow’ factor.\n\nOur helpful concierge team are on-hand to make your stay extra special. Whether you want a fully-stocked fridge, a local in-house chef to cook your meals, housekeeping or any other extra service – consider them your holiday genie, who will happily grant your wishes.\n\nThe Dordogne is home to a wide range of family-friendly activities that will keep your kids busy for the duration of your stay. We offer a large number of Dordogne family-friendly villas and villas with pools to ensure that the kids can entertain themselves at home, giving you lots of time to plan your daily excursions.\n\nExplore the Dordogne River\n\nWinding through the picturesque countryside, the Dordogne River is the heart of the region. A day on the river is the ideal way to combine sightseeing with adventure activities - canoeing trips allow you to hop between the villages and towns on its banks, while the excellent Brantome kayak tour lets you experience one of the region’s prettiest cities from a different perspective. Both are ideal for kids.\n\nVisit a medieval castle\n\nThere’s no doubt that castles are pretty cool and a great way of bringing history to life, so why not make the experience even more special with battle re-enactments, medieval weaponry and a large display of siege machines? The Castelnaud la Chapelle boasts all of these, making it the ideal place to visit with any little historians you may have in the family.\n\nDiscover the forest\n\nOver 40% of the Dordogne is forested, making it an important natural habitat and a major part of the regional landscape. It’s also somewhere you can take the kids to spot local wildlife. With wild boar and deer roaming free in the forest, there’s a good chance you’ll come face to face with some of the local fauna.\n\nDiscover more information about things to do with kids in Dordogne in our blog.\n\nIn the Dordogne, you’re never lacking things to do. For foodies, there’s a wealth of local ingredients, dishes, and restaurants to discover. For history enthusiasts, there are endless castles and pre-historic artwork to enjoy. For those who like to up the ante, cycling, kayaking, and swimming are all on offer.\n\nYou can’t visit the Dordogne without pigging out on its culinary treats. Foie gras is a regional speciality, as are the various types of cheeses you’ll inevitably smell as you make your way through a bustling market. Though it’s not as famous as the nearby Bordeaux region, the Dordogne still produces a wide range of fantastic wines, the vast majority of which are very affordable.\n\nBest things to do in the Dordogne\n\nTour Lascaux II: This art site has a detailed replica of the original ancient cave paintings. Book a guide and learn the fascinating reasons behind the reproduction, as well as the history of the people who created the stunning and intriguing images.\n\nExplore the Musée Gallo-Romain Vesunna Museum: Housed in a beautiful glass structure, the Musée Gallo-Romain Vesunna and archaeological site are beautifully preserved. You can roam the streets like a Roman, or book a tour guide and find out the stories behind the sites.\n\nVisit La Roque Saint-Christophe: In a beautiful, lush valley beside the River Vezere, the World Heritage Site La Roque Saint-Christophe features a complex network of caves and rock shelters. Get a glimpse of the lives of the prehistoric people who lived there and learn how the caves were converted into a fortress in the Middle Ages.\n\nSee a fortified Manor House: An impressive example of architectural ingenuity, Maison Forte de Reignac is the only completely intact strong house of its kind in France. Deceivingly small from the outside, the rock hides an enormous interior that features bedrooms, dining rooms, bathrooms and even a chapel. Its dark past is also revealed in the grisly torture exhibition.\n\nExplore the magical garden – Classified as one of the Notable Gardens of France, a romantic excursion to the Hanging Gardens at Marqueyssac will not disappoint. With over 5 km of walking paths, 150,000 skilfully sculpted boxwood trees, and a chateau built on the edge of the cliffs, it’s a sublimely peaceful treat.\n\nDiscover more information about the best group activities in Dordogne in our blog.\n\nUnlike many other French regions, the Dordogne isn’t dominated by a regional super-city. Instead, the population is spread out amongst a collection of smaller towns and villages, many of which are styled in the traditional bastide style, with a grid layout, central square and fortified walls.\n\nOthers, like the striking Brantome, are wrapped up in the curves of the Dordogne River and make the water their focal point.\n\nStone walls and vibrant markets\n\nThe Dordogne is home to some of the most picturesque villages in the country. The region is actually split into four different 'zones.’ In the centre, where bright, white rocky crags and outcrops are more common, there’s the Périgord Blanc. To the south, where thick oak forests and the fortified bastides rule, you have the Périgord Noir. In the north are the green pastures and forests of the Périgord Vert and to the southwest is the Périgord Pourpre, named for the grapes that cover its hills.\n\nOur Dordogne holiday villas ensure easy access to all four of these areas and allow you to take day trips out to all the major towns, villages and attractions in the area."
