        "text": "Players With NBA Experience Coached Larry Sanders - Milwaukee Bucks/Portland Trail Blazers Eric Maynor - Oklahoma City Thunder Steve Blake - Portland Trailblazers/LA Lakers James Jones - Miami Heat\n\nTony Pujol begins his fifth season on the Alabama staff and fourth as an assistant coach in 2013-14, after initially serving as the program[apos]s director of operations during the 2009-10 campaign. During his first three seasons as an assistant coach, Pujol played a pivotal role in assisting the Crimson Tide to three consecutive 20-win seasons for the first time since the 1990, 1991 and 1992 campaigns - a span of just over 20 years. In 2012-13, Pujol helped lead Alabama to a 23-13 overall record (12-6 SEC) as the squad reached the quarterfinals of the NIT and finished second in the SEC. It marked the third consecutive season the Tide has reached the postseason. During Pujol[apos]s second year as an assistant, the Crimson Tide was selected to participate in the 2012 NCAA Tournament, its first trip to the NCAAs since 2006, after winning 21 games overall and nine against Southeastern Conference opponents. Alabama played one of the toughest schedules in the league and the nation, ranking third and 29th, respectively. The Tide[apos]s signature gritty defense was ever present as its opponents shot only 38.9 percent from the floor while averaging 58.1 points per game. In his first season as an assistant for the Tide, Pujol helped guide the 2010-11 squad to a 25-12 record, an SEC Western Division championship and an appearance in the NIT title game. His work with the Tide[apos]s defense helped produce one of the toughest defenses in the nation, as the Tide surrendered only 59.4 points per game, the eighth-lowest average in the nation. That 2010-11 defensive effort also ranked as one of the best in the history of the Southeastern Conference, as the 10th-lowest average in SEC history and lowest since 1984. Alabama[apos]s tenacious defense helped make Coleman Coliseum one of the toughest places in the nation to play, as the Tide posted a 19-0 home record in 2010-11. On the recruiting trail, Pujol has helped turn Alabama into a national presence. His efforts helped the Tide land a 2011 recruiting class that rivals.com ranked as the fifth-best in the nation, with four prospects ranked in the top 100 nationally. Pujol and Crimson Tide head coach Anthony Grant have a long and dynamic relationship, as Pujol served on Grant[apos]s staff at VCU for three seasons. The pair also both hail from Miami and began their coaching careers as high school coaches in south Florida. While at VCU, Pujol and Grant coached the Rams to three straight conference titles and postseason appearances, including a pair of NCAA berths. He worked with 12 all-Colonial Athletic Association selections, two-time CAA Player of the Year Eric Maynor, and helped recruit a class that was ranked No. 5 among mid-major programs. Pujol[apos]s ties to his native South Florida also helped attract future NBA lottery pick Larry Sanders to VCU, along with a host of other talented players from the Sunshine State.\n\nCareer Timeline 2010-Present: Alabama - Assistant Coach 2009-10: Alabama - Director of Operations 2006-09: VCU - Assistant Coach 2004-06: Appalachian State - Assistant Coach 1995-2004: Northwest Christian Academy - Head Coach 1992-95: La Progresiva Presbyterian - Head Coach\n\nPujol joined Grant[apos]s staff after two seasons at Appalachian State, where he helped recruit the foundation that led to a school-record 25 wins in 2006-07. Pujol also was instrumental in obtaining the Mountaineers[apos] Public Recognition Award, based on the program[apos]s Academic Progress Rate (APR) data released by the NCAA.\n\n[quote]Tony has a great feel and understanding for what it takes to build a championship-caliber program. He is a great relationship builder and understands the identity and culture we are striving to create here at Alabama. His experience, professionalism and attention to detail help make my job easier as the head coach.[quote] - Anthony Grant\n\nPrior to his collegiate career, Pujol was a high school coach in south Florida for 13 seasons, including nine at Northwest Christian Academy in Miami, where he posted a 250-46 record and won state titles in 1999, 2003, and 2004. He graduated from Sterling College (Kansas) in 1989 with a degree in business administration and was a standout in both basketball and baseball, earning baseball all-conference honors in his final three seasons at Sterling. Pujol and his wife Mayle have three daughters, Kasey, Kristen and Mia."
