        "text": "Why do this PhD?\n\nThe PhD programme in Microbiology is addressed to graduates in Microbiology and other related areas (Biochemistry, Biology, Biomedical Sciences, Biotechnology, Environmental Biology, Environmental Science, Food Science and Technology, Genetics, Medicine, Pharmacy, Veterinary Medicine) who wish to acquire advanced skills in Microbiology research. At the end of the PhD, our students are fully prepared to join the working world, whether that’s academia or joining research teams in the field of clinical microbiology, the environment, biotechnology, or the food industry.\n\nThe programme's teaching staff includes researchers from the Department of Genetics and Microbiology at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, who are also members of leading research groups in their respective fields. The research groups are located on the Bellaterra Campus and in three hospitals in the metropolitan area of Barcelona (Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital, Vall d'Hebron Hospital and Santa Cruz y Sant Pau Hospital). The programme also has the privilege of collaborating with several research centres belonging to the UAB or affiliated with the CSIC, which are either located on site at the UAB or nearby.\n\nProfessional opportunities\n\nMicrobiologists are able to carry out research work in the pharmaceutical and biomedical industry, developing new therapeutic and diagnostic tools.\n\nIn the food industry they play an important role both in developing new products and in implementing quality-control systems. In hospitals and clinics they are involved in the study of pathogenicity mechanisms and in the development and evaluation of new therapies for infectious diseases.\n\nIn the clinical and hospital setting, they participate in the study of pathogenicity mechanisms as well as in the development and evaluation of new therapies for the treatment of infectious diseases.\n\nIn the environmental industry PhD graduates in microbiology are able to conduct environmental diagnoses, assess and manage the quality of treated and non-treated water, study the impact of human activity on environmental microbiota, and develop and use bioremediation tools to mitigate the effects of human pollution.\n\nFinally, in the area of university and public research institutions PhD graduates in microbiology can plan and direct basic and applied research projects, supervise research conducted by master's and PhD students, and teach on undergraduate and postgraduate courses.\n\nPhD presentation video\n\nCoordinator\n\nEsther Julián Gómez\n\nAdministration\n\nGenetics and Microbiology Department\n\nBuilding C - UAB Campus\n\nContact: Elena García Serrano\n\nPhone: +34 93 581 1662\n\nEmail: coordinacio.doctorat.microbiologia@uab.cat\n\nThesis supervision and thesis tutoring\n\nThesis supervision\n\nPhD thesis supervisor\n\nAt the time of making the admission proposal, the academic tribunal of the PhD programme assigns the PhD candidate a thesis supervisor, and this figure will be responsible for the coherence and appropriateness of the activities, impact and innovation in the subject field of the thesis and will guide the planning and adequacy of the research to other projects and activities.\n\nThe designation of a thesis supervisor may fall on any Spanish or Foreign PhD with accredited research experience independently of the university, centre or institution in which they work. At the same time, each PhD programme may establish additional criteria as necessary for the PhD thesis supervisor.\n\nThe supervisor's responsibilities are the following:\n\nTry to ensure that the project is original, innovative and viable, under the terms of the rules, and also that it is coherent with the group or line of the research to which it is linked.\n\nAgree to the plan for the supervision of research work and plan regular meetings. The supervisor informs what documents are required for each meeting (written reports, messages, minutes, handwritten papers etc) to be able to accredit the frequency of the meetings.\n\nAdvise the PhD candidate on the research in general and the preparation of the thesis in particular.\n\nIndicate to the PhD candidate the most appropriate activities for their research when the PhD programme has been identified and sign the activities document.\n\nFacilitate the candidate's participation in the specific and transferrable training activities for the PhD programme in accordance with that established in the commitment document.\n\nSign the commitment and activities document for the PhD candidate.\n\nAssist the PhD candidate in the definition of the PhD research project and the research that will eventually culminate in the PhD thesis.\n\nRevise and sign the research plan for the thesis.\n\nUndertake to regularly supervise in accordance with the commitment document, the research plan for the PhD candidate, and help them to focus the project while it is being carried out.\n\nTry to ensure that the PhD student takes the initiative and achieves increasing autonomy throughout the project.\n\nAssist the PhD candidate to find solutions for different aspects related to their research and establish the specific details and the means required and, where necessary, the experimental design.\n\nLet the PhD candidate know about all the means available to them at the University that are important for their research and help them to access them.\n\nWrite the forms required for the annual review.\n\nRead, correct and comment on the draft thesis before it is deposited, on the conditions that the candidate has provided a copy a reasonable time beforehand.\n\nEnsure that the candidate understands the administrative and academic requirements for the assessment and defence of the thesis as well as the corresponding deadlines throughout the process.\n\nCommunicate health and safety rules to the PhD candidate where necessary.\n\nCommunicate any rule or ethical aspect that may be related to their research.\n\nThe designation of the thesis supervisor may be modified at any time during the PhD programme: whenever there are justified reasons the supervisor may reject supervision of the thesis (in which case the academic tribunal for the programme will suggest a replacement); on petition of the PhD candidate where there are justifications for doing so the academic tribunal of the PhD programme may change the designation of the PhD supervisor.\n\nThesis supervisors outside the PhD programme\n\nThesis supervisors who are not lecturers at the UAB or who have not been appointed as a thesis director must accredit their own PhD qualification and research experience, i.e. specific details of publications, research projects they have worked on and any other information relevant to the lines of research proposed on the PhD programme. Once the above supervisor has been approved, the academic tribunal for the PhD programme may authorise their incorporation into the programme as a possible thesis supervisor (or assign them to a single doctoral thesis).\n\nEach PhD programme must establish which other lecturers, whatever their category as long as they are not included in the programme, are able to supervise the thesis.\n\nJoint supervision of the PhD thesis\n\nThe PhD thesis may be supervised by other PhD holders where there are academic arguments for doing so (such as interdiscplinarity of the subject or national or international programmes) with the prior authorisation of the academic tribunal of the PhD programme. This authorisation may be withdrawn at a later date if, in the opinion of the academic tribunal, the joint supervision is not beneficial to the progress of the thesis.\n\nA PhD thesis may be jointly supervised by up to three PhD holders.\n\nMaximum number of theses per supervisor\n\nEach supervisor may supervise a maximum of five PhD theses simultaneously. The supervision of the PhD thesis concludes at the time the thesis is presented and defended or if the PhD candidate withdraws. In terms of recognition of the teaching and research dedication in situations of joint supervision these should be divided equally.\n\nRecognition of thesis supervision\n\nOne essential way to encourage thesis supervision is by ensuring that this task is recognised and valued: something that the UAB regulations achieve. The approval of the Academic Workload Model for UAB Teaching Staff by the Governing Council on 13 December 2017, significantly improved the system used to calculate and take account of supervision tasks. Article 10.3 stipulates that the supervisor of a doctoral thesis is to have 100 hours recognised per thesis supervised. If supervision is carried out by more than one person, this recognition is shared equally between them.\n\nThesis tutoring\n\nAt the time of application the academic tribunal of the programme will assign the candidate an academic tutor. The academic tutor must be a doctor with accredited research experience, linked to the programme in which has been admitted the doctoral student..\n\nThe academic tutor has the following responsibilities:\n\nEnsure coherence in the tasks of the PhD candidate and supervisor and the research group.\n\nProvide communication between the PhD student and the academic tribunal of the PhD programme.\n\nEnsure the appropriateness of the PhD training and research activity to the programme and the norms of the School for Doctoral Studies.\n\nSign the commitment and activities document for the PhD candidate.\n\nCheck and sign the PhD research plan.\n\nWrite the reports required for the annual review.\n\nThe academic tribunal of the programme can establish, where possible, that the academic tutor can also be the thesis supervisor.\n\nThe designation of the academic tutor may be changed at any time during the PhD course: on the part of the PhD candidate, where there are justified reasons; on the part of the thesis supervisor, where there are justified reasons. In these cases the academic tribunal of the PhD programme has to propose a new tutor.\n\nAdmission application\n\nAdmission\n\nThe UAB PhD programs are onsite.\n\nCandidates who wish to access a PhD programme must apply to the academic committee for admissions using the online application form and follow the procedure established by the coordinators or administrative managers responsible for the PhD programme for the proposal of a tutor and thesis supervisor.\n\nYou can find more information about the academic tutor and supervisor of the thesis in the section \"Lines and supervision\".\n\nBefore beginning your application make sure you satisfy the admission requirements, have all the necessary documents which you will need to scan and have seen the admissions calendar.\n\nIf you want to apply for a place on a PhD programme, please note the sections that you must fill in on the application form.\n\nThe applicant must also propose if he wants to do the thesis full-time or part-time. You will find more information on this page.\n\nWe recommend that you check this video before starting the application (video in Spanish; click on the CC button to display the English subtitles):\n\nSummary fo the steps to follow in your application\n\nTo acces the application form, you will need a university identificacion number (NIU) and a password. To obtain these:\n\nIf you are not a UAB student, enter identification details to register.\n\nIf you are already or have been a UAB student, but you cannot remember your NIU and/or your password, re-enter your identification details to recover them.\n\nSelect the PhD programme that interests you.\n\nEnter your personal and academic details (and, if applicable, the line of research in which you want to work) in the appropriate parts of the application form. Your name and surname must be those that appear on your DNI, passport, NIE or identity card of your country.\n\nScan the necessary personal and academic documents and attach them to your application. Documentos should be in .pdf, .jpg or .doc format (maximum 4 MB).\n\nBeforehand, consult the file for the PhD programme you have chosen. In the 'Admission' tab you will find the Documentation section.\n\nPrepare the documents. Check how the documentation of the studies completed and personal should be, to attach it.\n\nIf it is a program requirement, you must also include, filled out and signed, a document stating the approval of your thesis supervisor / academic tutor (if the director is external to the UAB, you will first have to check , when you do the pre-registration, if you already appear as an internal director -you have to search for the director by last name and if you find him/her with a code, you have to select him/her since already registered-). Check the documentation section of your program that you will find in the 'Admission' tab to see if the program has a specific document model.\n\nFailure to include the requested documents in each of the specific sections of the application may lead to the denial of your application.\n\nConnect to sia.uab.cat, make the request and attach the necessary documentation.\n\nRemember that you must present this same access documentation to register. Check this link for more information.\n\nYou can download the proof of receipt of your application. Decisions on applications will be sent by e-mail to the address indicated in the pre-registration application. If you need an early admission motivated by a scholarship, you must indicate it in the field of observations as well as indicate for which scholarship. The coordination of the program, depending on the situation, will resolve your early admission, if applicable.\n\nConsult some indications that may be useful for you to pre-register online:\n\nRemember that you must indicate on the previous studies screen of the application, in the section 'data of the study of origin', the highest level qualification (if, for example, you are admitted to a master's degree, you must indicate this information, not that of the bachelor). In the event that you indicathe other information, this admission will be wrongly recorded and no subsequant changes can be made.\n\nWhat to do if you have taken a master's degree in Spain and you do not find it in the list of masters that are listed in the university where you studied it?\n\nIf you have a master's degree (official) in a Spanish university and when you indicate the university does not appear in the list of masters, you can indicate as follow:\n\nRemember that you will have to indicate if you have finished it or not and, once informed this field, click the 'Next' button to continue the online application.\n\nChoose the option \"Master obtained outside Spain\".\n\nIn the country selection popup screen, enter \"Spain\" and search for the university (you can use * to facilitate the search, for example: * Rioja *).\n\nIn the field of studies indicate the name of the studies you have taken (for example: \"Master in Information Technology\").\n\nConsiderations for filling in personal information\n\nIn the institutional email field, if you do not have it indicated, you must add your personal email address.\n\nAs for the addresses, you have to incorporate both the usual and the during the course. If the latter does not yet know, you must indicate the same address that you indicated in the usual address.\n\nRegarding the birth zip code, if you were born in a Spanish population that has more than one code, you can indicate any of them.\n\nIf you apply for more than one doctorate at the UAB, the application will retrieve the information of the mandatory documentation that you indicated in the first application for doctoral access. If the second request asks for other documentation, you can indicate it in the optional documents.\n\nIf you do not find your university registered in the system, you must select any other university in your country and in the field of observations of the same application indicate the name of the university where you got the degree.\n\nCHECK THE DOCUMENTATION SECTION BELOW IN CASE YOUR PHD PROGRAMME REQUIRES YOU TO DO ANY OTHER MANAGEMENT BEFORE STARTING THE PRE-REGISTRATION AND YOU WILL ALREADY BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE PRE-REGISTRATION APPLICATION\n\nEnter the application request\n\nOnce your application has been saved, you will enter the selection process. You will receive the result of the resolution in a personalized way in the email that you indicated in the application for admission, according to the schedule of the doctoral program. Check the spam tray to verify that it has not been treated as junk mail.\n\nThis PhD programme has, for the 2024-2025 academic year, the following pre-registration periods:\n\nFrom February, 15 to March, 20\n\nRESOLUTION maximum by the School of Doctorate: April, 25\n\nFrom April, 5 to May, 30\n\nRESOLUTION maximum by the School of Doctorate: June, 25\n\nFrom June, 10 to July, 30\n\nRESOLUTION maximum by the School of Doctorate: October, 1\n\nFrom September, 1 to October, 15\n\nRESOLUTION maximum by the School of Doctorate: November, 5\n\nFrom October, 15 to November, 15\n\nRESOLUTION maximum by the School of Doctorate: December, 20\n\nDocumentation necessary for admission\n\nApplicants must be able to accredit before the coordinators or academic managers of the PhD programme that their previous studies are sufficient for access to a PhD programme in accordance with prevailing legislation and must provide this obligatory documents relatet to previous studies (degree and academic certificates) on registering (see the required documents in the 'Documents to be submitted for registration' point on the 'Enrolment' section in this website).\n\nIn the 'Admission' section you can also see all the possible paths for access to PhD programmes that are permitted under the current regulations.\n\nThe required documents may be presented in Catalan, Spanish or English.

It is only necessary that you enter your application in the computer application and that you indicate it in the Observations field, where you must indicate that you need a letter of admission and the scholarship to which you are opting. If the computer application is closed, you can contact the coordination of the programme.\n\nIf you need a preadmission, the coordination of the programme can issue it if it considers it appropriate. You must contact the coordination of the programme to inform you of the procedure.\n\nOn the International Support Service website you can see more information about future foreign students related to residencies in Catalonia, legal procedures and the UAB campus.\n\nMonitoring your application\n\nYou can monitor your application using the same page as you made it. Below are the explanations of the different stages:\n\nApplication made by student: your pre-registration has been saved.\n\nIncomplete application: there are documents missing from the application.\n\nValidated by the administrative office: the application and attached documents have been checked.\n\nAdmitted: the coordinator has considered the pre-registration and proposed an offer or admission.\n\nOffer of admission: the Doctoral School has considered the proposals for admission made by the coordinator and has made a definitive offer. The PhD student will also receive an e-mail informing them of this decision. The PhD student must wait to register.\n\nWaiting list: the coordinator has considered the pre-registration and has agreed on admission but there are no places on the PhD course.\n\nApplication rejected: the coordinator or the Doctoral School have considered the application but do not agree to admission as not all the requirements have been fulfilled.\n\nIf you need it, here you will find a complementary information document on PhD studies.\n\nRequirements and selection criteria\n\nGeneral access requirements\n\nIn general, to gain access to an official PhD programme the candidate must hold a Spanish degree or equivalent and a Master's degree.\n\nAccess may be granted where the following cases apply:\n\nHold an official Spanish university degrees or equivalent Spanish degrees provided that at least 300 ECTS credits have been passed in all of these courses and accredit level 3 of the Spanish Qualifications Framework for Higher Education.\n\nHold a title obtained in accordance with foreign educational systems belonging to the European Higher Education Area (EHEA), without the need for its homologation, which accredits a level 7 of the European Qualifications Framework provided that said title authorizes access to studies of PhD in the issuing country. This admission will not imply, in any case, the homologation of the previous degree held by the interested party or its recognition for purposes other than access to PhD studies.\n\nHold a degree obtained in accordance with foreign educational systems outside the EHEA, without the need for its homologation, after verification by the university that it accredits a level of training equivalent to that of the official Spanish university Master's degree and that it authorizes in the country of issuance of the title for access to PhD studies. This admission will not imply, in any case, the homologation of the previous degree held by the interested party or its recognition for purposes other than access to doctoral studies.\n\nHolder of of another title of Doctor.\n\nLikewise, university graduates who, after obtaining a place in training in the corresponding entrance test to specialized health training places, have passed with a positive evaluation of at least two years of training in a program to obtain the Official title of one of the specialties in Health Sciences.\n\nAdmission to the PhD programme is decided by the Rector and depends on having passed the bridging courses, where they exist.\n\nSpecific access requirements\n\nThe specific requirements of the PhD programme in Microbiology aim to establish a student profile that maximises the chances of success on the programme. Applicants must have recognised research experience, thorough knowledge of the basic concepts and tools in microbiology and the capacity to assimilate new knowledge.\n\nIn addition to the general requirements for admission to doctoral studies, the PhD programme in Microbiology applies further criteria for evaluating applications, which are detailed below along with their weighting\n\nAcademic record and affinity of previous studies with Microbiology (40%)\n\nResearch grants obtained (20%).\n\nPersonal interview (40%).\n\nRegistration and fees\n\nRegistration\n\nEach academic year the PhD candidate must register for the annual review as part of the administrative process to form a contract between the PhD student and the university.\n\nFirst year Registration\n\nRegistration in the first year should be done once the decision is made and no longer than one month after the date of admission. Check the information about procedure, calendar, documents and prices on this page.\n\nPrior to registration, please check the additional information and indications on the registration procedure.\n\nHere is a video to show you how to self-register:\n\n(Video in Spanish with English subtitles)\n\nIn this programme, complementary mobility insurance is mandatory.\n\nCalendar and Registration documents\n\nCalendar and registration documents\n\nCalendar\n\nWhen the PhD applicant is accepted onto a PhD programme they must formalise the PhD review registration document in a period of not more than one month after being accepted. The following courses must be registered for within the established registration period:\n\nRegistration calendar\n\nFirst year registration\n\nRegistration for subsequent years\n\nRegistration documents\n\nPhD applicants should bring the following obligatory documentation when registering at the School for Doctoral Studies. Check the documentation on this link.\n\nThe documents may be presented in Catalan, Spanish or English. For documentation in French, Italian or Portuguese, you can send it to the Language Service at the UAB. The applicant is responsible for the getting the documents translated and paying for the service. For other languages you need to provide a translation in to Catalan by a sworn translator, any diplomatic or consular service of Spain abroad or the Spanish consular or diplomatic representation of the applicant’s national country.\n\nTo legalise the documentation that accredits the courses taken abroad, please check the 'Legalisation' section (in Spanish). Nevertheless, at the time of pre-admission or admission the doctoral student may submit the non-legalised documentation although it must be legalised by the time the students registers.\n\nTraining activities\n\nTransversal training activities\n\nThe PhD programmes include research training that is both transferrable and specific to the area of each programme and consists of both compulsory and optional activities.\n\nAll the activities that the PhD student must complete are recorded in an activities document, but in any case there are compulsory activities that must be completed in the first academic years. It may also include transferrable activities offered by the same university.\n\nOther professional who are not PhD holders may participate in these activities as long as they hold a relevant qualification in the corresponding area.\n\nErasmus\n\nYou can also do other mobility, under the Erasmus programme, both studies and internships. Check the information in the corresponding links.\n\nTo include these activities in your academic record, please check this video (click on the subtitle icon at the bottom right corner).\n\nMandatory and optional specific activities\n\nFor this PhD programme the following training activities are scheduled.\n\nMandatory activities:\n\nResearch paper sent to a high-impact scientific journal\n\nWriting and publishing research papers is one of the key elements of a good research project. This is the PhD student's responsibility but it needs close involvement on the part of the supervisor and, in some cases, of co-authors.\n\nOral presentations or posters at national or international conferences\n\nThrough an oral or poster presentation at a national or international specialist conference, students get the opportunity to try out their communicative skills by presenting their findings for critical appraisal by experts.\n\nAttendance at seminars or lectures given by experts in the subject area\n\nAttendance at seminars or lectures given by experts is an important element in PhD students' training, as it allows them to interact with experts in their field in an atmosphere that encourages the open exchange of ideas. This activity can take place within the framework of national or international scientific conferences or in departmental seminar cycles.\n\nOptional activities:\n\nResearch stays in public or private centres, at home or abroad.\n\nWe recommend that students undertake at least one short stay at a research centre other than their own, so as to familiarise themselves with new methodologies and exchange information with specialist groups working in similar areas.\n\nTeaching assistance\n\nStudents can carry out teaching tasks permitted under the regulations in order to gain experience and improve their communication skills This activity is to fall within the department's teaching schedule.\n\nTypologies and Research Ethics\n\nThe aim of this set of good research practices is to get an idea of the regulatory framework for activities linked to research and which follow the directives set out in the Statutes of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, based on principles of freedom, democracy, justice, equality and solidarity. This commitment therefore involves orientating the teaching, research and other university activities towards a culture of peace, respect for human rights, social progress, respect for the environment and sustainable development, and the explicit renouncement of research for military ends.\n\n• Good Research Practices: this is a set of points for action, recommendation and commitments when carrying out research.\n\n•Good PhD Practices: is a set of recommendations and commitments that should serve a guide for PhD candidates in their dual role of students and trainee researchers.\n\n• Institutional Biosafety Committee: technical committee made up of experts in evaluating the safety of facilities and activities conducted with biological agents, in identifying any type of potential risk and in ensuring that all regulations relevant to biosafety are met.\n\n• Ethics Committee on Animal and Human Experimentation (CEEAH), establishes mechanisms and procedures to ensure experimentation is complies with prevailing legislation.\n\n• Good Open Acces Practices, good practices of Catalan universities to meet the Open Acces's mandates about publications, as specified on the 'Ley de la ciencia española' and the European Union's Horizon Europe.\n\n• is a European initiative providing access to a complete range of information and support services to researchers wishing to pursue their research careers in Europe or remain connected to research activities in Europe.\n\nInternationalization\n\nForeign residencies\n\nPhD students can progress further in their area of research through stays abroad, which may, when appropriate, come within the framework of bilateral joint-supervision agreements with a foreign university (thesis under joint international supervision) and within the International Doctoral Research Component. Stays abroad can also be made under Erasmus agreements.\n\nStays with Erasmus\n\nYou can make stays abroad (mainly in Europe) with both Erasmus Studies and Erasmus Internships. In the following links you will find the call and the calendars to request them:\n\nErasmus Studies\n\nErasmus Internships\n\nPhD thesis under joint international supervision\n\nOn the proposal of the academic tribunal for a PhD programme, the UAB may make agreements with foreign universities or centres of higher education that are authorised to award PhD qualifications for the purpose of preparing the PhD thesis.\n\nIn that case the PhD student will carry out research under the control and responsibility of a thesis supervisor in each of the institutions in the agreement, and these in turn will each award the PhD qualification on the basis of a single thesis.\n\nJoint supervision agreements may only be signed during the first year of the research work, counted from the day the student is accepted on the PhD programme.\n\nThe period for working on the thesis will be split between the two centres and the minimum stay at the UAB must ne a total of nine months, which may be divided into shorter periods.\n\nSee the detailed application procedure for joint international supervision (in Spanish).\n\nInternational Doctoral Research Component\n\nThe PhD qualification may also include the International Doctoral Research Component, as long as the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\nDuring the training period necessary to obtain the qualification of PhD, the candidate must have been outside Spain for a minimum of three months in a higher education institution or research centre of prestige, and have carried out research or study there. The period and the activities must be assessed by the supervisor and approved by the academic tribunal, and must be included in the students' PhD activities report. The period may be divided as long and the total is not less than three months but must be spent at a single institution.\n\nPart of the PhD thesis, at least the abstract and conclusions, must be written in one of the usual languages for scientific communication in that field of knowledge, different from any of the official languages in Spain. This regulation does not apply when the periods abroad, the reports and the experts involve a Spanish-speaking country.\n\nThat at least two PhD holding experts from a non-Spanish higher education institution or research centre have submitted their reports on the PhD thesis.\n\nThat at least one of the experts belongs to a non-Spanish higher education institution or research centre, holds a PhD, and is different from the person responsible for the period abroad, formed part of the PhD examination panel.\n\nThe defence of the PhD thesis must take place at the Spanish university where the candidate is registered or, in the case of joint doctoral programmes, in any of the participating universities or under the terms stated in the collaboration agreements.\n\nSee the detailed application procedure for the International Doctoral Research Component (in Spanish).\n\nEvaluation and annual review\n\nAnnual PhD review\n\nOnce the PhD student is accepted on the programme, they must register every academic year (including the year when the thesis is deposited) in order to confirm their status. The subject registered for is called review, and it is an evaluation of the training received during the year and progress on the writing of the PhD thesis.\n\nEach academic year the academic committee arranges a review, in which three PhD holding lecturers assess the progress made by the candidate in their research plan and activities document and the report by the thesis supervisor and academic tutor. In the report, the director and the academic tutor state, at least, that the candidate has fulfilled the number of meetings arranged between themselves and the thesis supervisor and has carried out the activities planned for that academic year.\n\nIn exceptional cases (research stays or work camps), and with a previous report from the thesis supervisor and from the academic tutor, the Academic Committee of the PhD programme may authorise substitute the oral and face-to-face presentation of the annual review by another format.\n\nIn accordance with current PhD regulations, the positive evaluation during the review is an essential requirement for continuing on the programme and registering for the following year. Failure to present an annual review with no justification will lead to the PhD candidates definitive withdrawal from the programme. If the annual review is negative the candidate may re-register for the same review within the registration calendar, make a new research plan and present for a new review in a maximum period of six months. However, if the new review is negative the candidate must withdraw from the PhD programme.\n\nThesis deposit\n\nOnline Deposit\n\nIn this section you will find the indications and the specific documentation of the programme, if applicable, that you must incorporate in your online deposit application. Check in advance what is the procedure to make the deposit online.\n\nOnce your application has been recorded and validated by the coordination of the PhD programme, you will be able to monitorise the deposited theses and the theses for which the examining board has been approved, as well as the agenda where the theses defenses are published.\n\nIf you want to deposit the doctoral thesis in this PhD programme, remember that you must confirm the complete application (status DI) 20 days before the maximum thesis completion date that appears in your file.\n\nLook out! If you want to deposit before the end of this academic year and thus not have to pay the fees for the next course, you must confirm your deposit request before 11 September 2024.\n\nAt the time of making your online deposit, you must attach these documents to your application, in the section \"Attach documentation\":\n\nAll PhD students\n\n01 - Examining board proposal (the signature is not necessary)\n\n44 - Turnitin Report\n\n45 - Affidavit document\n\nInternational Doctoral Research Component: Mandatory documentation if requested\n\n09 - International Doctoral Research Component: 1 report of the external member\n\n10 - International Doctoral Research Component: 2 report of the external member\n\nCompendium of publications: Mandatory documentation if requested\n\n08 - Compendium: Resolution of acceptance by the CAPD\n\nWriting a thesis in a language other than Catalan, Spanish and English: Mandatory documentation if requested\n\n11 - Resolution if the thesis is written in other language than Catalan, Spanish or English\n\nInformation related to the thesis\n\nInformation related to the thesis\n\nIn this section you can find indications and / or regulatory aspects of your PhD programme, if applicable.\n\nThere are PhD programmes that have regulated the presentation of the thesis as a compendium of publications, how the constitution of the examining board should be, etc.\n\nInternal Quality Assurance System of the centers\n\nInternal Quality Assurance System of the centers\n\nThe process-based management system used by the UAB faculties and schools stems from a commitment to offering degrees with their own policy on quality and measures in place to evaluate and improve performance continuously, according to the European quality standards. These elements together make up this university's Internal Quality Assurance System (SGIQ).\n\nThis system involves all the following:\n\nEstablishing and monitoring the faculty's policy and objectives regarding teaching standards, in accordance with the university’s strategic lines\n\nEstablishing and renewing the offer of PhD programmes.\n\nProcesses directly linked to teaching activity: tutoring, assessment, mobility, etc.\n\nProcesses to gauge the level of satisfaction of the different groups.\n\nProcesses linked to the people and resources needed: lecturers, administrative and service staff (PAS), infrastructure and services, course scheduling, academic organisation, etc.\n\nProcesses linked to the life cycles of degrees: verification (evaluation before implementation), regular monitoring, modification (continuous improvement) and accreditation (evaluation of performance and renewal of the authorisation to continue offering the programme), which seek to organise, renew and improve the offer of PhD programmes.\n\nVerification\n\nEvaluation process previous to the implementation of the degree: presentation of a proposal for a new PhD programme for AQU-Catalunya (Agency for the Quality of the University System of Catalonia) to issue the binding evaluation for the Council of Universities (Ministry of Universities), which is the responsible agent for verification.\n\nReport on the PhD programme\n\nResolution on verification by the Spanish Universities Council\n\nRegistry of Universities, Centres and Degrees (RUCT)\n\nMonitoring\n\nPeriodic monitoring process of the development and results of the PhD programme: self-evaluation carried out, every 3 years, by themselves.\n\nMonitoring report on the programme\n\nAccreditation\n\nDegree implementation renewal process: presentation, every 6 years from the implementation of the programme, of a self-report so that AQU-Catalunya issues the binding evaluation for the Council of Universities, which is the body responsible for accreditation.\n\nAccreditation self-report\n\nAccreditation report\n\nResolution of accreditation of the Council of Universities\n\nRegister of Universities, centers and degrees (RUCT)\n\nAQU VSMA Framework\n\nInternal Quality Assurance System of the faculty\n\nSet of processes to manage and monitor the different aspects of degrees, with the strategic objective of ensuring continuous improvement\n\nInternal Quality Assurance System\n\nTutoring Action Plan (PAT)\n\nStanding Committee\n\nOpina UAB\n\nA channel for suggestions, complaints and praise regarding the functioning of the UAB\n\nPhD data\n\nSatisfaction surveys of Doctors\n\nSatisfaction surveys of thesis supervisors\n\nCheck here the results of the doctor's job placement survey\n\nThe PhD figures\n\nRecognition and awards\n\nSpecial Prize Awards\n\nThe Special Prize Awards are awarded for each PhD programme among all the theses defended in an academic year, at the rate of one prize for every five theses or fraction thereof, without the need for the doctor to request it. The winners are entitled to a refund of the fee they paid for the application for the degree certificate and to an accrediting certificate..\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n\nA pannel appointed by the Academic Commission of each PhD programme makes the proposal of candidates for the Special Prize Award, following the criteria previously established by the same commission. You can do it up to three courses after the defenses.\n\nThe PhD Commission awards the prizes according to the proposals made by the PhD programmes.\n\nThe Doctoral School contacts the winners to refund the fee.\n\nThe certificates of the Special Prizes awarded in the previous PhD Commission are delivered in the PhD special prize award ceremony.\n\nCheck the prizes that have already awarded by the PhD Comission, ordered by defense course.\n\nIn this link you will find the doctors who have obtained the Special Prize Award in this PhD programme.\n\nYou can also consult this document."
