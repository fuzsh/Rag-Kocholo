        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to be responsible for a high number of hospitalizations. 12%–20% of patients with COVID-19 need hospitalisation due to a severe illness causing acute respiratory failure that can develop even just a few hours after the beginning of the dyspnoea1 , 2. Mortality is extremely high in this subgroup of patients, with a reported rate of 20%–52%3 , 4.\n\nThese alarming statistics have posed an enormous threat to the capacity of hospitals, which have had to reduce the use of hospital beds for non-COVID-19 illnesses and expand the number and availability of ICU hospital beds as well as providing other resources and amenities. In fact, the demand for available beds was so high in Madrid during the first pandemic surge that it was necessary to convert hotels to hospital-hotels5 and to adapt an exhibition space into a provisional hospital. In fact, a new pandemic hospital has been constructed specifically for this difficult situation, and throughout the Spanish territory numerous field hospitals have been built.\n\nTo improve the data on treatments and outcomes, several therapies for hospitalised patients have been evaluated. Thus far, corticosteroids3, together with anticoagulation, the antiviral remdesivir, or immunomodulators such as tocilizumab or the Janus kinase inhibitor baricitinib have shown some efficacy in randomised clinical trials, but many others are under investigation6.\n\nRegarding systemic corticosteroids, experience in other viral acute respiratory distress syndromes (ARDS), such as Middle East respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza, had shown delayed viral clearance, no benefit and even potential injury7., 8., 9.. Therefore, although corticosteroids were not recommended for COVID-19 treatment in the early phases of the pandemic10, we now know that in the inflammatory phase of severe COVID-19 they can reduce proinflammatory and augment anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as improve lung barrier integrity and microcirculation11., 12., 13.. Fortunately, the evidence is growing, and in the RECOVERY randomised trial, dexamethasone demonstrated a reduction in mortality in patients with respiratory failure3. In addition, in several observational studies, the benefits of corticosteroids in regard to delaying intensive care unit (ICU) admission, shortening mechanical ventilator support14, and even reduced mortality have been observed14 , 15.\n\nDexamethasone is a well-known drug with more than 60 years of clinical use. Its therapeutic potential comes from several actions. First, it binds to glucocorticoid receptors present in the cell cytoplasm, which are responsible for the initiation of immune cells responses that lead to proinflammatory suppression of several cytokines, some of which are related to COVID-19 progression. It also increases the gene expression of interleukin (IL)-10, which is an anti-inflammatory cytokine mediator. Second, it inhibits neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells, preventing the release of lysosomal enzymes and chemotaxis at the site of inflammation, as well as inhibiting macrophage activation, one of the main authors of cytokine storms in COVID-19, which in turn is the landmark of severe COVID-19. Additionally, dexamethasone has other important benefits, such as its low-cost, easy availability and its long-lasting effect that allows a once-a-day regimen11 , 16.\n\nGiven the positive results of previously mentioned studies on corticosteroids, we suspected that corticosteroids also could shorten the hospital length of stay (LOS), thus reducing the consumption of resources and increasing available beds for other patients who need them. However, no study has focused on this outcome. Furthermore, while the evidence has been accumulating on dexamethasone, other groups of corticosteroids have not yet been evaluated.\n\nThus, we focused on the first wave of the pandemic, when corticosteroids were beginning to be used, and we compared patients who received corticosteroids with patients who did not. We conducted a real-world study in which we aimed to determine the efficacy of corticosteroids in shortening the LOS in patients with COVID-19 compared with patients who did not receive corticosteroids. In addition, we evaluated which group of corticosteroids was the most effective in reducing the LOS.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has meant, especially during the first wave, the near paralysis of hospitalisations for non-COVID-19 health problems as well as for non-urgent surgeries, in order to deal with all the patients with serious COVID-19 who required hospital admission. In addition, although the number of ICU beds has been significantly increased, in some time periods it was still insufficient19. Therefore, reducing the hospital LOS was (and still is) profoundly beneficial in helping cope with new patients who need hospitalisation.\n\nIn the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, we had a period in which corticosteroids were not routinely recommended and were even contraindicated, after which the first evidence supporting their use was reported18. This real-world controlled retrospective cohort study suggests that corticosteroids, specifically dexamethasone, reduced the LOS in patients with higher inflammation markers compared with the control group. As we have seen, patients in the CG expressed higher levels of platelets and white blood cells, and they had two times higher ferritin levels than those in the NCG. Severe COVID-19 is caused by an excessive systemic increase of cytokines and chemokines in the patient, also called a “cytokine storm”, which leads to immunopathological lung damage and diffuse alveolar injury, with the development of ARDS and death20. In this subgroup of patients, a hyperinflammatory phenotype has been described in which the serum concentrations of inflammatory and coagulation markers (including ferritin, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein), as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10 and tumour necrosis factor-α) are increased, accompanied by reduced lymphocytes and neutrophils with immunometabolic reprogramming13 , 21 , 22. Given corticosteroids are potent immunomodulatory drugs that can break the inflammatory feedforward loop in some individuals 11, as we have seen in the CG group, those with higher inflammation might obtain a greater benefit in terms of LOS11., 12., 13. , 21.\n\nThis investigation occurred during a time period in which the first evidence on the benefit of corticosteroids in COVID-19 was being published. At the time of this study, given the data were heterogeneous and we did not know which corticosteroid type was the most appropriate, our hospital protocol allowed us to choose between the 3 corticosteroids described based on the criteria of the attending physicians. We have shown that, while dexamethasone reduces the LOS, methylprednisolone and prednisone did not achieve this outcome.\n\nMost of the evidence accumulated to date on COVID-19 is on dexamethasone. Indeed, the largest randomised study with corticosteroids in severe COVID-19 was the RECOVERY trial, in which it was observed that dexamethasone administration led to a reduction in mortality in patients with respiratory failure3. This outcome has been further supported in 2 meta-analyses that included a high number of critically ill patients with heterogeneous data23 , 24. Methylprednisolone has also been shown better clinical outcomes, to increase ventilator-free days, and a lower mortality rate in moderate to severe COVID-1914 , 25 , 26. In fact, there have been published two randomized trials with hospitalized COVID-19 patients in which methylprednisolone demonstrated a lower ventilator use and shorter length of hospital stay compared to dexamethasone27 , 28.\n\nIt is important to note that, when assessed both clinical trials, the applied dose of methylprednisolone was much higher than that of dexamethasone, which makes difficult to draw conclusions regarding whether methylprednisolone is better option than methylprednisolone, or if the higher dose of corticosteroid is the reason for the improvement in this group of patients. In the other hand, when comparing the results of our study with other series, we have several observations. First, although this cohort exhibited a higher mortality rate than that of the RECOVERY trial3, it is within the range reported in other series2., 3., 4.. We must consider the selection bias of randomised clinical trials, in which the most severe patients could be excluded. Fortunately, mortality might be decreasing as the pandemic progresses. Second, there was also a lower proportion of patients who were admitted to the ICU compared with other cohorts3 , 4 , 29. This difference is probably due to the participation of the Intermediate Respiratory Care Units within the Pulmonary Department in our hospital during the pandemic19 , 30. Noninvasive ventilation and other noninvasive respiratory support, such as high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, have played an important role here1 , 29 , 31. These therapies could be applied together with close cardiorespiratory monitoring in these units to try to reduce or delay ICU admissions among patients who require noninvasive respiratory support in a crisis situation, as well as to manage early discharges from the ICU and for those patients who were ineligible for admission to the ICU due to comorbidities.\n\nThe main strength of our study is that it is a real-world cohort at a time when corticosteroid treatment had started; therefore, corticosteroid treatment groups could be compared in the same clinical setting (one hospital’s treatment protocols, during the same COVID-19 surge). Additionally, we included a control group, matched for sex, age and severity of disease, and representative of a large proportion of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Spain.\n\nThis study has several potential concerns and limitations. First, it is a single-centre study with a limited sample size, which reduces the external validity of our results and is insufficient to analyse the effect on mortality. However, it is larger than most of the observational studies evaluating corticoid effects14 , 26 , 27. Second, although we have explored several baseline characteristics of the patients, due to the design of the study and its retrospective nature, it is possible that confounders have not been evaluated. Nevertheless, the data have been extracted from a complex database that includes a multitude of possible confounders as described previously. Third, the cross-sectional design only permits assessing potential associations or relationships. To evaluate causality, it would be necessary to conduct a longitudinal study with long-term patient follow-up. Additionally, we have no information about the need for oxygen supplementation or noninvasive mechanical ventilation. A final limitation is that, at the time of the compilation of these results, we did not have data on long-term outcomes and mortality, which would further enrich the results. However, these patients are in a post-COVID follow-up consultation, which could resolve this limitation in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, corticosteroids, especially dexamethasone, might reduce the length of stay in hospitalised patients, which would have a positive impact on hospital capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic."
