        "text": "The Finnish surnames refer mostly to the place where the family lived, and there's very often the ending -nen or -lainen. Another very common ending is -la.\n\nUntil this year Virtanen has been the most common name, and it can be interpreted like this: Virta = river; Virtanen = someone who lives on a river. Similarly, the third common name is Nieminen: Niemi = cape; Nieminen = someone who lives on a cape.\n\nStill some 150 years ago the surname was the same as the name of the farm. When a person or a family moved to another place, they often took a new surname.\n\nThere are only a few Finnish surnames referring to a profession. Seppä (smith) with a couple of variations is the most common.\n\nUnder the threat of closing this thread I won't put a list of the most common Finnish surnames, but it might be interesting to know that just a few months ago the surname Korhonen overtook the so far leader Virtanen, just as suddenly as Räikkönen overtook Fisichella in Spa today. (Maybe Korhonen used the KERS?)\n\nKorhonen probably means someone who lives on a high place (korkea = high) but this is only my own guess.\n\nThe Finnish surnames refer mostly to the place where the family lived, and there's very often the ending -nen or -lainen.
