        "text": "This is a 1797 guitar by Juan Pagés made in Cádiz,\\Na very old guitar that I have been restoring for some months.\n\nA guitar that was in very bad condition and we are\\Ntrying to follow the most current system of restoration\n\nand that follows, so to speak, the dictates of the\\NInternational Institute of Museum Conservation.\n\nFrom ICOM. With materials as similar as possible\n\nto the original and without trying\\Nto falsify the parts, but to try to make it noticeable\n\nclearly which part is not original.\n\nThat’s fundamental. That when\\Nsomebody sees, some expert sees the instrument,\n\nthen they know which parts are original and which parts\\Nare the parts that I have replaced.\n\nJuan Pagés is perhaps the initiator of the very famous\\N18th century Cadiz school. He was born in a village\n\nof Seville. He was already building guitars there. And he moved\\Nto Cadiz, which was where the contracting house was.\n\nHe started to make some guitar models that were very advanced\\Nof the time compared to what was being done in Europe.\n\nIn history he is a very important figure.\n\nIn the history of the Spanish guitar.\\NHis brother or his son, that’s up for debate,\n\nhis brother is José Pagés, from who are preserved many more\n\ninstruments\n\nAnd then there are also other family members who also\\Nbuilt guitars at the end of the 18th century.\n\nand early 19th century\n\nThe fan bracing system,\\Nthe internal bracing of the guitar is made\n\nThere are already some guitars made by Sanguino de Sevilla\\Nwhich had a fan bracing system on the top for reinforcement.\n\nbut they make this system very well known.\n\nFor example, Panormo’s 19th century English guitars.\n\nare very much influenced by this model of\\Nguitar. And then also, not only the ones\n\nfrom Panormo, also in the USA,\n\nMartin’s guitars are also very,\\Nvery similar to this model of guitar.\n\nWell, they don’t really have much in common,\\Nthe Pagés worked together with other greats\n\nmakers like Benedict and Recio in Cádiz. And\\Nthey may have had an influence on the Sevillian school.\n\nWhen Torres arrived in Seville in the middle of the 19th century.\\NBut by then the guitar had already changed a lot.\n\nI think that the Pagés are an earlier\\Nprevious generation\n\nand their guitars have a different structure.\n\nBut, for example, the use of\\Nnoble materials like the Brazilian Rosewood\\N(Dalbergia Nigra)\n\nand spruce tops of very good quality.\\NVery low weights, very light guitars.\n\nand of course the fan bracing system.\n\nTorres does not rely directly.\\NTorres learned\n\nto make guitars probably in Granada\n\nin the fourth decade of the 19th century, and then moved to Seville.\n\nThis is what the priest Sirvent already said in a letter, a famous\\Nletter that reflects Romanillos in his book that Torres told him\n\nthat he made his first guitar in Granada.\n\nAnd then there are many authors of the period and\\Nimmediately afterwards. Like Pujol,\n\nlike Domingo Prat, who say that Antonio de Torres\\Nwas a pupil of José Pernas here in Granada.\n\nWe did not find any data on this relationship\n\nmaster and disciple.\n\nBut the guitar, the constructive style and the secondary sources\\Ndo speak to us.\n\nspeak of this relationship. For example, Domingo Prat in his\\Ndictionary of guitarists, says it on up to five occasions\n\nthat Antonio Torres was a pupil of José Pernas.\n\nAnd it’s not the only basis.\n\nSo, I believe that Antonio de Torres is based\\Nmore on the Sevillian school when he arrives at\n\nSeville in the 19th century, and what he learned in Granada.\n\nAnd possibly some notions that he had earlier\\Nof Almeria.\n\nMore than on the models that by that time were already\\Nwere a bit obsolete, which the Pagés had made.\n\nThe Pagés almost always worked with six double courses strings.\n\nSo they were making the model that I call the\\Nneoclassical guitar and what Romanillos calls vihuela.\n\nWell, I think something Torres actually invented…\n\nin fact he didn’t invent anything.\n\nAll the innovations\\Nthat are usually attributed to Torres\n\nhad already been done before by some guitar maker, both in the size of the body\\Nand in scale lenght..\n\nIn the type of bridges, in the use of mechanical tuning pegs, even in the\\Neven in the bars systems, we can say,\n\nthat except for the floating harmonic bar\\Nused by La Leona on which the fan struts\n\npass underneath that bar, which then became\\Nworld famous as the Bouchet system,\n\nexcept that, I think that’s an innovation of Torres.\n\nBut everything else\n\nsome guitar makers has done it before.\n\nBut the great importance that Torres has is that he knew how to\\Nperfectly understand all the innovations\n\nare taking place in the schools of Granada, Malaga,\\NSeville, Cadiz and group them together in a model of instrument.\n\nthat from that date onwards will be copied by all the guitar makers.\\NAnd a few decades later, all of Europe.\n\nAnd we can say that even today\\Nthis model is still being copied.\n\nThe classical guitar model.\n\nI think the biggest influence may be in the ornamentation.\n\nin the design of the head on the guitars.\\NLaprévote and Lacote used to make a trilobed design\n\nand then it was used here in Granada\n\nby José Pernas. There is a guitar by José Pernas dated 1851\\Nwhich already has this trilobate motif and which is\n\na stylisation of the trilobulates\\Nused by Laprévote and Rene Lacote in France.\n\nThis is a copy that I am making of a guitar by José Pernas\\Nthat is currently in the\n\ncollection of Jesús Bellido. It was previously owned by Marcelino\\NLopez Nieto. This Pernas is probably earlier than the guitar La Leona\n\nby Torres, the most famous guitar in the world. And which has\\Nsome characteristics that we could say that\n\nare predecessors of La Leona de Torres. Such as,\\Nfor example, the three-part background, the 650mm scale lenght,\n\nthe slightly larger size than the previous guitars…\n\nWe are talking that this Pernas guitar is from\\N1851 and La Leona is from 1856.\n\nThe top is perhaps what makes the difference between them because\n\nTorres uses in La Leona a tornavoz, which is a kind of brass cone\\Nthat is glued on this part\n\nand which remains on the inside of the instrument.\n\nThis is the copy of the top of Pernas’ guitar,\\Nwhich, curiously, has a fan bracing made in struts pairs.\n\nNormally they tend to be in the majority of instruments\n\nusually has an strut in the middle\\Nand then struts on the other both sides\n\nThere are some guitars by Torres\\Nthat also has this struts system by pairs.\n\nSo there’s quite a lot of relation. And another\\Nrelationship that we can also make\n\napproaching the French guitars, which is the rosette.\n\nThis rosette of Pernas’ guitar is exactly the same as\\Nthe rosette of La Leona by Torres.\n\nAnd this type of rosette had also been made\\Npreviously in France by several makers.\n\nNow that we’ve talked about the tornavoz, uh, I think it’s\\Npossibly that the Tornavoz is also an invention of Torres.\n\nI’m convinced that it’s Torres’ invention, although\\Nwe know that Pernas also used it and that there were many other makers\n\nimmediately after Torres who used the tornavoz.\n\nok,\n\nThe oldest guitars…\n\nWell, there are practically none of them\\Nleft\n\nbut the medieval guitar was actually a small lute.\n\nI can show you here I have a\\Nreconstruction that I’m making of\n\na medieval guitar.\n\nIt would play like a lute\n\nWith a plectrum, and it would have double courses of\\Nstrings. Three or four double courses.\n\nand pegs in the style of the medieval lute.\n\nBut it was already called at that time\n\n“guitar” here in Spain.\n\nAlso in France and in Italy.\n\nIt’s what we now call medieval guitar.\n\nWe’re talking about the 14th-13th century and there’s only one\\Npreserved in Germany. By Hans Oth (1450)\n\nFrom this point on the\\Nthree or four courses guitar\n\nand with a curved back,\n\nwe can say that it disappears, and appears\\Na new instrument with flat back.\n\nAnd with four courses of strings.\n\nThat’s seven pegs; one single first string, two second strings,\\Ntwo thirds, and two fourths, four courses.\n\nand suddenly they call it a guitar.\n\nWhat we call a renaissance guitar\n\nThis instrument was probably born between\\NValencia and central Italy, that is to say,\n\nwhat was the kingdom of Aragon at that time.\n\nThat’s when the instrument began to be called guitar.\n\nAnd at one point there is a famous poet, priest\\Nand playwright from Ronda called Vicente Espinel.\n\nby who is celebrated next year\n\nthe 400th anniversary of his death,\n\nWhat did he add to that guitar? we’ve said before\\Nthat already the guitar has a basic structure\n\nwith seven pegs and with a parallel back and top.\n\nThen, this poet adds a fifth string to it.\n\nA fifth course.\n\nIn the treble part to increase the possibility of playing\\Nmore pieces, more possibilities\n\ntechnical, above all. So this instrument\\Nis what normally we know as baroque guitar,\n\nthat instrument, it starts to be called in Italy, in France and\\Nother countries… it starts to be known as Spanish Guitar.\n\nLearning methods were made, they were printed,\\Nit was very successful and it was exported to France.\n\nIn France they also build\\Na lot of this instrument\n\nand it’s what we know as the\\Nbaroque guitar and at one point already\n\nin the second half of the 18th century\n\nApproximately around 1770\n\nthere is a very important figure who is José Contreras,\\Nborn in Granada and who worked in Madrid.\n\nThe most important luthier in the history of Spain.\n\nHe made violins, violoncellos…\n\nSo he’s quite an important figure\\Nbut he’s practically…\n\nwe don’t know anything about him,\\Nonly that he was born in Granada around 1710.\n\nHe married in Madrid.\n\nHis son was also dedicated\n\nto the construction of instruments\n\nIn fact, on the label his son said “El Granadino’s son”.\\Nto see how famous his father was.\n\nHe made some violins, above all, some very good violins.\n\nAnd those violins are preserved\n\nmade by Jose Contreras. And one of his guitars is preserved.\n\nwhich has 14 strings.\n\nSeven double courses or having six\\Ncourses in which the first and second orders were triples.\n\nwhich was an arrangement that was also,\n\nshall we say, a bit common in the 18th century\n\nAnd we don’t know if he was the one who decided\\Nto put six course like the guitar today.\n\nSix course to the guitar.\n\nBut the oldest data of a guitar from 1760\n\nwhere in a Madrid newspaper a guitar by “El Granadino” is for sale\\Nwith six courses of strings (Jose Contreras guitar)\n\nThis is the first piece of information we have.\\NUntil then they always had five courses of strings.\n\nThis was also widespread in Europe.\n\nIt caught on very quickly.\n\nThere were also some cases of seven-course guitars,\\Nbut that wasn’t so successful, but actually\n\nthe guitar is this guitar that we’re talking about\\Nwith six course (double strings)\n\nThe next evolution was from\\Ndouble strings to single strings.\n\nFor tuning reasons, for playing possibilities,\\Nof technique, of getting strings that match tuning better…\n\nit was also an innovation that can have a basis in the\\Nlyre guitar of France.\n\nthe neoclassical lyre-shaped guitars.\n\nAnd also in the Italian and\\NFrench theorboes … which also had single strings.\n\nSo maybe that’s what influenced\\Nthis 12-string guitar to be\n\nmade the strings be single strings\n\nThe oldest ones we know of are in Italy.\n\nFabricatore and other makers.\\NAnd also in France it was made\n\nThe oldest data we have about single strings guitars in Spain\\NI think it’s in Ronda in a text by a writer\n\nwhere he talks about a guitar that had\\Nonly six single strings\n\nAnd then we have also about the same date,\\Nin 1803 the guitar maker from Granada, Agustín Caro\n\nmakes a guitar with three single strings.\n\nThis is the oldest surviving guitar with single strings.\\NIt was in the collection of Angel Cañete.\n\nand is now in an Italian collection.\n\nBut it is the oldest surviving example\\Npreserved example of a guitar with single strings.\n\nLater, many of these guitars, for example, by José\\NPagés, Juan Pagés and other makers of the time,\n\nwhat they did was to leave three strings on each side,\\Nthree pegs, and cut off the head.\n\nA lot of guitarists had this modification done\n\nfor use with the new fashion of single strings.\n\nAnd that was something that in practically 20 years,\\Npractically no luthier made double strings anymore.\n\nAll over Spain, all over Europe, all over the world, people are already\\Nfrom double strings to single strings.\n\nThat was something that happened very quickly. And then also that time…\n\nBecause here we see that the fretboard\n\nis in the same plane as the top.\n\nAnd at that time, because.. also the earliest one\\Nthat we know again is from Agustín caro.\n\nHe superimposes an ebony fingerboard on top of it. And it is an\\Ninnovation that is also very successful.\n\nAnd already all the makers who are after that time made it like that,\n\nat least in Spain. In France for a few decades, they built with the guitar\n\nwith the top in the same level with the fingerboard.\n\nBut the Romantic guitar in Spain already has single strings, the fretboard\\Nsingle strings, the raised fretboard ,\n\nthe bridge with the detachable bone,\\Nmodern bridge.\n\nThose are the features, that one, up to the Torres model.\n\nWhen we talk about Torres and later on Santos\\NHernández, we are already talking about the contemporary guitar.\n\nThere has no longer been any innovation that has been\\Nspread among the makers since them.\n\nSanto Hernández, possibly\\Nthe best guitar maker in history.\n\nSantos Hernández is\\Nfundamental for the guitar.\n\nAnd I would say that practically the whole of the Granada school of\\Nguitar makers has its basis in Santos Hernández,\n\nin the models of Santos Hernández. And they already said that\n\nin the time of Benito and Eduardo Ferrer, and many guitar makers\\Nfrom Granada have commented that they\n\ncopied, let’s say, followed, the models of Santos Hernández.\\NManuel de la Chica, for example,\n\nManuel de la Chica guitar is a copy of Santos Hernández.\n\nSantos Hernandez made a guitar a little bit bigger than\\NTorres and he is the one who gives the actual dimension,\n\ncompletely up to date. Because Torres’ guitars are usually\\Na little bit smaller than the actual ones.\n\nAnd Santos Hernández\n\nlet’s not forget that Santo Hernandez learnt,\\Nwell, he was with Viudez and also he learned in\n\nRafael Ortega’s factory. Rafael from Granada.\n\nRafael and his father Francisco Ortega\n\nwere guitar makers here in Granada and moved to Madrid.\n\nAnd they had a factory in the Placeta de la\\NBerenjena which is at the end of Cava Baja street.\n\nwhich is where Santos Hernández was born. Santos Hernández as a\\Nchild would pass by almost every day, for sure,\n\nby the guitar factory and\\Nlearned how to make guitars there.\n\nI think some of the most important innovations,\n\nthe definitive innovations\\Nin the evolution of the guitar,\n\nhave been given above all by Agustín Caro in Spain. What is the\\Nthe contemporary bridge, the elevation of the neck, and the reduction of the\n\ndouble strings to single strings.\n\nAnd some more.\n\nSo, he’s not very well known,\\NAgustin Caro,\n\nwe don’t have any biographical information about him,\n\nwe only know his first name and his first surname.\n\nWe don’t know anything else. But he’s a guitar maker\\Nvery, very important. That then Caro influenced\n\na lot on José Pernas and José Pernas had\\Na lot of influence on Antonio de Torres\n\nI think so.\n\nWell,\n\nRomanillos’ work is impeccable.\n\nIt’s an amazing work what he did\\Ntogether with his wife, together with Marian\n\nAnd they have achieved a world-wide fame for Antonio de Torres\\Nwhich seems to me to be deserved in all aspects. But perhaps they have\n\nremained anonymous, or almost anonymous,\n\nother very important makers, such as\\Nfor example, Pernas and Agustín Caro.\n\nAnd in the Granada school there are more.\n\nIn fact, my doctoral thesis in musicology\\NI did on the Granada school of guitar making,\n\nthe old Granada school,\\Nnot the 20th century, but the previous one until the end of the 19th century.\n\nAnd there I try to give a little bit of all these clues\\Nand I continue the research, because I think\n\nthat it’s worthwhile for people to know about this.\n\nThat there’s scientific work on this.\n\nAnd then there are also other very important makers…\\Nbecause Torres worked in Seville with Gutierrez.\n\nwith Manuel Gutierrez, who is also very important. Even\\Nsome of the guitars that Gutierrez started\n\nTorres finished them. And there are some\\Nguitars that were made with Torres’ materials.\n\nThere are some necks, that are typical of\\NGutiérrez guitars in authentic Torres guitars.\n\nRomanillos I think it\\Nclearly states that Torres worked\n\nwith Gutierrez or that they had a relationship. The same\\Nalso with Manuel Soto y Solares\n\nin Seville, they had in Calle Cerrajería,\n\nthey had their workshops almost door to door with Torres\n\nAnd it is known that sometimes it is said that some of the guitars\\Nof Soto Solares were sold by Torres and some guitars by Torres\n\nwere sold by Soto and Solares. There is a direct relationship\n\nand that can’t be forgotten.\\NBut I don’t want to play down the importance of Antonio de Torres.\n\nHis figure is enormous.\n\nTorres worked very well, but Torres also\\Nmade guitars that leave a lot to be desired.\n\nI remember a quote from Domingo\\NPrat that I find funny:\n\n“Torres made a lion, several cubs, and many junk”. (playing with Spanish words and meanings)\\N”Torres hizo La Leona, algunos cachorros y muchos cacharros”\n\nSo you can see that Domingo Prat was not very…\\Nalthough he bought a lot of guitars by Torres.\n\nand sold in Argentina … but he also knew that…\n\nAntonio de Torres had to eat and was\\Na guitar maker that he was ruined several times with business\n\noutside from building guitars, and he had to make\\Ngood guitars, regular guitars, and very cheap guitars.\n\nThere are examples of very cheap guitars\\Nwhere you see very good workmanship,\n\nbut sometimes the materials look a bit disappointing let’s say.\n\nI don’t think the business\\Nwas that kind to dothat,\n\nfor there to be subcontracting.\n\nIt is possible that some guitar makers, as in the case\\Nof Hermanos Moya,\n\nworked with him or had a relationship with him.\n\nBut I don’t think that neither in his first\\Nnor in his second period\n\nwas the business so flourishing\\Nto have employees and subcontractors.\n\nIt’s not like, for example, workshops in Valencia or Madrid where there were\\Nworkers, apprentices…\n\nwhere there were a number of people working for the name\n\nof the owner of the workshop\n\nTorres, I think he worked alone, more or less, as we work here,\\Nas we work in Granada.\n\neach one of us, in our workshop, we make our own guitars\\Nwith our tools, and we don’t have… there’s no\n\napprentices, there’s no system like that, there’s no such thing as a guild or anything like it.\n\nSo this is the culmination of a\\Nformative process at the University in my studies of\n\nmusicology in the University of Granada, and after several years\\Nof research, I presented my doctoral thesis\n\non the Old Granada school of guitar making,\\Nwhich unfortunately, there are not many theses\n\nabout the world of the guitar and about guitar making.\n\nSo, I dedicated myself, well, that’s why, to the\\Nold school of Granada that I believe is\n\nvery important and it hasn’t been, it’s not reflected,\\Nin most of the bibliography.\n\nI do a study\n\nfrom the history of the evolution of the guitar…\n\nAnd here I have a lot of data about the 18th century, about guitar makers…\n\nHere you can find a detailed\\Nhistory of the guitar.\n\nIts evolution.\n\nIts most important innovations up to the\\Npresent day guitar. And the role that I think it played\n\nvery important role that the Granada school played in that evolution.\n\nSo, some of the most important innovations that\n\nhave taken place in the guitar\n\nthe oldest instruments that\\Nare made by makers from Granada.\n\nA history of the guitar,\n\nfirst a state of the question is made\\Nwhich is discussed in all the bibliography of\n\nthe subject of the Granada school.\n\nThen there is also a history of the guitar\n\ntrying to put the most up to date\\Ncurrent advances on the research of the subject.\n\nAnd then a system is also proposed\\Nof research on antique guitars.\n\nA system, then, a battery of tools\\Nand techniques to study scientifically\n\na guitar and get the maximum information of it.\n\nAnd then there’s a history of all the guitar makers that we know,\\Nthat have worked in Granada\n\nfrom the 16th or 17th century to the present day.\n\nFor example, Romanillos in his book\n\nI don’t remember if there were 120 or 100 guitar makers from Granada that he mentioned\\Nand, in the last inventory, I mention more than 200 or 230.\n\nA lot of guitar makers have been found and well, also\\NI include the actual guitar makers,\n\nso it’s a complete history, although the investigation\n\nends in the 19th century\n\nThe 20th century I do not include it in my work\n\nLater in some work it can be done."
