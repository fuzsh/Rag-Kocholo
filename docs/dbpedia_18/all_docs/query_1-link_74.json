        "text": "FRONT PAGE\n\nAn article on Wednesday about Goldman Sachs’ quarterly earnings misstated a detail from the quarterly results of another Wall Street bank, Citigroup. One-time gains, like reversing the reserves set aside to cover bad loans, accounted for 67 percent of Citigroup’s third-quarter earnings — not 85 percent.\n\n•\n\nA news analysis article on Saturday about the NATO military operations in Libya referred imprecisely to the role of Lt. Gen. Ralph J. Jodice II, a United States Air Force officer who spoke of coordinating the actions of various allied forces. While he is the air commander of the operation, he is not the overall commander. (Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard, a Canadian, heads all operations.)\n\nSPORTS\n\nAn illustration on Wednesday with coverage of the World Series erroneously included one program cover among those representing the World Series through the years. The cover showing a pirate promoting a World Series matchup between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Yankees in 1938 was printed before the participants were known; it was not the official program for that year. (The Chicago Cubs passed the Pirates for the National League pennant in the final week of the 1938 season and went on to play the Yankees in the World Series.)\n\n•\n\nAn article in some editions on Thursday about the St. Louis Cardinals’ 3-2 victory in Game 1 of the World Series misidentified one of the runners who scored for the Cardinals on a hit by Lance Berkman in the bottom of the fourth inning. Along with Albert Pujols, Matt Holliday scored — not Berkman himself.\n\n•\n\nAn article in some copies on Monday about the Texas Rangers’ 4-0 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 4 of the World Series misstated, at one point, the surname of the Texas pitcher who walked Allen Craig in the ninth inning. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, the pitcher is Neftali Feliz, not Perez.\n\n•\n\nAn article in some editions on Saturday about the Texas Rangers’ making a name for themselves in the Dallas area since relocating from Washington misidentified the baseball franchise that inspired a vaudeville joke — “First in war, first in peace, last in the American League. ” The joke was about the Washington Senators franchise that became the Minnesota Twins in 1961, not about the Senators franchise that began play in 1961 and became the Rangers in 1972.\n\nBUSINESS DAY\n\nAn article on Monday about Nokia’s pending introduction of smartphones bearing Windows Phone software misidentified the smartphone that resulted from Nokia’s now-defunct alliance with Intel. It was the N9, not the N8.\n\nOBITUARIES\n\nAn obituary on Saturday about John M. Blum, the presidential historian and author of an influential biography of Theodore Roosevelt, referred incorrectly to Roosevelt’s family. His wife and mother died in 1884, but his daughter Alice, who was born that year, lived until 1980. Roosevelt did not lose “his wife, newborn daughter and mother in the span of a few days in 1884.”\n\n•\n\nAn obituary on Monday about Antonio Cassese, who helped found two international war crimes tribunals, misstated the publication schedule of The Journal of International Criminal Justice, which he founded. It is published five times a year, not monthly.\n\nOPINION\n\nAn editorial on Sunday about military detentions misstated the number of senators who voted for a measure that would have stopped federal courts from trying terrorism cases. It was 47, not 42. The editorial also should have said that an almost equally bad measure was produced by Senators Carl Levin and John McCain, not Mr. Levin alone.\n\nThe Times welcomes comments and suggestions, or complaints about errors that warrant correction.
