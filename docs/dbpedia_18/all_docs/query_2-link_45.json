The former assistant coach at the University of Wyoming was hired at UNA on April 2, 2018, and has nearly two decades of collegiate coaching experience.\n\nIn 2022-23, Pujol led the Lions to their highest win total since 2013-14 with an 18-15 record. The Lions also competed in their first NCAA Division I postseason game with an appearance in the CBI Tournament in Florida.\n\nPujol led North Alabama through its transition to NCAA Division I basketball. Since making the move, which included membership in the ASUN Conference at the start of the 2018-19 season, UNA has improved its record each of the first three years. The Lions posted a 10-22 record during their first Division I season, earning a No. 6 seed in the ASUN Tournament with a 7-9 league record after being picked to finish last in the preseason coaches' poll. Pujol followed with a three-win improvement in the second year and a No. 5 seed in the conference tourney. Mervin James was also named to the ASUN All-Freshman Team.\n\nIn the 2020-21 campaign, North Alabama secured its first winning record at the Division I level, posting a 13-10 mark that included a postseason run. After earning a No. 5 seed, UNA won consecutive ASUN tournament games, knocking off North Florida 68-60 and FGCU 96-81 to earn a spot in the championship against top-seeded Liberty. The Lions held a late lead before falling 79-75.\n\nPayton Youngblood and James earned all-tournament honors. Youngblood later added ASUN All-Academic and CoSIDA Academic All-District honors to his resume while James was a second team all-conference pick. Detalian Brown was also named to the league's All-Freshman Team.\n\nUNA had several standout performances during its inaugural Division I season, including Jamari Blackmon being named the ASUN Freshman of the Year and Christian Agnew also being named to the league's All-Freshman team. Under Pujol, UNA secured the program's first-ever Division I victory with a 72-59 home on over Blue Mountain on Nov. 10, at Flowers Hall. On Jan. 8, Florida Gulf Coast became the first Division I opponent to fall. The 61-56 home victory over FGCU also represented the Lions' first-ever win in ASUN Conference play.\n\nA road game against seventh-ranked Gonzaga, the renewal of the home-and-home rivalry series with Jacksonville State and a No. 2 finish on ESPN's SportsCenter Top 10 Plays were among the other first-season highlights for Pujol and the UNA program.\n\nPujol also served as an assistant basketball coach at Appalachian State University, Virginia Commonwealth University and the University of Alabama before taking a position at Wyoming in 2016. He became just the seventh head coach in the 88-year history of the UNA’s men’s basketball program.\n\nPujol helped lead Wyoming to a 20-13 record in 2017-18. In 2016-17, Pujol helped lead the Cowboys to the College Basketball Invitational Championship. The Cowboys finished the season 23-15 overall with a 19-3 home record. Pujol helped mentor Mountain West Sixth Man Justin James, as he also was named the Most Valuable Player of the CBI. Junior Forward Hayden Dalton also received Honorable-Mention All-Mountain West honors. The Cowboys set a school and MW record with 369 three-pointers last season.\n\nPujol coached collegiately at Alabama for five seasons from 2010-2014 under head coach Anthony Grant. Pujol helped the Crimson Tide compile a 99-71 record during his time on the staff, including three-straight 20-win seasons for the first time since 1990-92. Alabama earned two NIT bids and one NCAA bid from 2011-13 and finished runner-up in the NIT in 2011. That 2010-11 Crimson Tide team featured one of the toughest defenses in the nation, as Alabama surrendered only 59.4 points per game, the eighth-lowest average in the nation. Alabama's tenacious defense helped it go 19-0 at home during that season.\n\nOn the recruiting trail, he helped the Tide land a 2011 recruiting class that Rivals.com ranked as the fifth best in the nation with four prospects ranked in the top 100 nationally. After the 2013-14 season, Pujol stepped away from collegiate coaching to dedicated more time to his family and has coached the last year and a half in the AAU ranks in New Jersey.\n\nPreviously, Pujol served under Grant at VCU from 2006-09 with Edwards. The staff guided the Rams to a 76-25 record in those three seasons, including 45-9 in the Colonial Athletic Association. VCU won three conference regular-season titles and two tournament titles in that span to play in the NCAA tournament twice and NIT once. Two Rams from that team, Eric Maynor and Larry Sanders, would go on to be selected in the NBA draft.\n\nPujol joined Grant's staff after two seasons at Appalachian State from 2004-06, where he helped the Mountaineers win the Southern Conference North Division in 2005. The team also earned the NCAA's Public Recognition Award based on the program's APR. His recruits would help ASU win a school-record 25 games the season after he left.\n\nPrior to his collegiate career, Pujol was a high school coach in south Florida for 13 seasons, including nine at Northwest Christian Academy in Miami, where he posted a 250-46 record with state titles in 1999, 2003 and 2004.\n\nHe graduated from Sterling College (Kansas) in 1989 with a degree in business administration and was a standout in both basketball and baseball, earning all-conference honors on the diamond in his final three seasons.\n\nTony and his wife, Mayle, have three daughters, Kasey, Kristen and Mia.\n\n\"Tony Pujol is a first class human being and coach. The University of North Alabama is getting ready to be touched by a winner on and off the court.\"\n\n-- Frank Martin, Head Basketball Coach, University of South Carolina\n\n\"Tony Pujol is an outstanding basketball coach, strategic planner and relationship builder. He will be a perfect fit for UNA on campus, in the community and in the transition to ASUN competition.\"\n\n-- Anthony Grant, Head Basketball Coach, University of Dayton\n\n\"Tony is an excellent coach who understands what it takes to win at a high level. He will have a tremendous impact on the student-athletes and athletics department at the University of North Alabama, as well as the community of Florence.\"\n\n-- Allen Edwards, Head Basketball Coach, University of Wyoming\n\n\"Tony is a great hire by UNA. He was one of my favorite people when he was at Alabama. I'm confident the people in the Shoals are going to love him.\"\n\n-- Patrick Murphy, Head Softball Coach, University of Alabama\n\n\"North Alabama has made a great hire in Tony Pujol. I am excited for him to have this opportunity to be the head basketball coach. Coach Pujol will be a great leader and mentor for the student-athletes and will do great things for the Lions' basketball program.\"\n\n-- Shane Lyons, Director of Athletics, West Virginia University\n\n\"Congratulations to North Alabama on the hiring of Tony Pujol! Having known Coach Pujol for 18 years, I've always been impressed with his work ethic, his commitment to his players and his ability to recruit talented student-athletes. With his wealth of experience, excellent basketball knowledge and incredible family, he will do a tremendous job leading the North Alabama program forward.\"\n\n-- Matt McMahon, Head Basketball Coach, Murray State University\n\n\"Tony is a first class coach who can recruit, coach and be a great ambassador of the Lions. He has tremendous passion and his teams will play with focus. He did a tremendous job at VCU and was instrumental in building the foundation for VCU's success. Good days are ahead for UNA basketball.\"\n\n-- Dr. Richard Sander, Assistant to the President, Executive Director in Residence,\n\nEast Tennessee State University Doctoral Program in Sports Leadership\n\nYear-By-Year - Coach Tony Pujol\n\nSeason Team Overall Conference Standing Postseason\n\n2018–19 North Alabama 10–22 7–9 6th 2019–20 North Alabama 13–17 8–8 5th 2020–21 North Alabama 13–11 7–8 5th 2021–22 North Alabama 9–21 2–14 6th (West) 2022–23 North Alabama 18–15 10–8 6th CBI First Round\n\nNorth Alabama: 63–86 (.423) 34–47 (.420) Total: 63–86 (.423)"
