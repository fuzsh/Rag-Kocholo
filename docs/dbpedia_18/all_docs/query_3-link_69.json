        "text": "Our training courses help our customers:\n\nUnderstand the products in depth.\n\nBuild on prior knowledge and increase employee specialisation.\n\nAnswer their questions about the product range.\n\nDifferent training modules are made available to our customers\n\nOven operation course for ovens acquired by the customer. This course will show workers how to operate the machine, its processes and cycles, and answers any questions they might have.\n\nCourse on advanced Pujol e-Connect system operation. A technological innovation that connects the operator to their oven via any mobile device, tablet or computer. The integration of this technological innovation in Pujol ovens allows for production control, remote and safe traceability, and remote assistance with Pujol technicians.\n\nThis lamination course shows how the various thermoplastics are used and the myriad of possibilities offered by their associated machines. The majority of the ovens designed by Hornos Pujol use EVA, although the Pujol 100 PVB + has also been developed with EVA, PVB and other thermoplastics in mind.\n\nAssembly and commissioning of Hornos Pujol machinery can be carried out in person or remotely:\n\n1.- In person\n\nA team of assembly technicians and electricians travel to the installation site. They take care of assembly and adjustments performed on the oven. They also perform all the necessary tests to ensure that the glass lamination process is carried out correctly. Customer training and lamination assistance is provided.\n\n2.- Remotely\n\nIf the customer prefers, or in situations where, due to force majeure, it is not possible to perform commissioning tasks in person, Hornos Pujol has prepared a comprehensive manual that includes instructions for mechanical and electrical assembly, commissioning, and a section on lamination processes. Further assistance and customer support is available in the form of a video-conference service to support the commissioning process.\n\nIn recent years Hornos Pujol has been able to develop cutting-edge technological solutions for the laminated glass sector. Pujol's engineering team has created sophisticated laminating ovens that are packed with features, such as the Pujol 100 CO, Pujol 100 PVB +, and our Chemical Tempering Oven.\n\nOurs is a company that is constantly evolving, adapting to the circumstances of an ever-changing world. That is why there is one thing that is crystal clear to us: adaptation and innovation is of paramount importance. For us, this is crucial; in fact the way we do things is based on these two fundamental pillars.\n\nThe engineering team at Hornos Pujol works ceaselessly to stay abreast of these changes and to open up new horizons. This extra effort is made to satisfy the present needs of customers, but also those of the future.\n\nHornos Pujol has been designing and manufacturing ovens in Spain for more than 100 years. This company is run by the fourth generation of the Pujol family, which has helped to preserve the same fighting, hard-working and innovative spirit as always. The is the same spirit that has brought us to where we are right now. We are and will continue to be market leaders.\n\nFrom the outset, innovation has been a clear goal of ours and we have the patents to prove it; our technological advances have helped to move the industry forward.\n\nLatest innovations in ovens:\n\n● Pujol 100 PVB+.\n\nIn this high-capacity glass laminating oven, EVA and PVB can be used interchangeably without the need for an autoclave, and it also ideal for larger production needs.\n\nPujol patents:\n\n● Oven for transparent sinks.\n\nThis machinery has been especially designed to create whole, thermoformed one-piece glass sinks.\n\n● Safeglass.\n\nThis system prevents the glass from breaking apart and falling in case of breakage.\n\n● Ovens for industrial stripping of painted tools and parts; it is able to clean hooks and remove paint at low temperatures."
