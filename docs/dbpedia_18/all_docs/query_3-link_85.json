I ask this because guys like Navarro (Pastor) and Almagro (Sanchez) dropped their second surname when they became more well known....\n\nWhat a couple of ungrateful pricks :lol:\n\n4083 posts ·\n\n#7 ·\n\nYes in Spain people are required to have a double barrelled surname by law. The father's surname usually comes before's the mother's, and many people are only referred to by their first/paternal surname in common, everyday use.\n\n9762 posts ·\n\n#9 ·\n\nIt is the Romans fault.\n\n12 posts ·\n\n#10 ·\n\nIn Spain the woman doesn't lose her surnames when she gets married, so, the children gets not only 2 but infinite surnames: the first of the father, then the first of the mother, then the second of the father... and so on.\n\nMe for example I can only recall 10 surnames, but you can do a little research and find hundreds of them.\n\nMy name is ***** ***** ****** oliva sebastián garcia del campo berdugo garcia cercadillo de dios\n\nAnd the \"-\" symbol that they put (sanchez-vicario) is just because they want the surname of the mother to be present, so they \"merge\" both surnames into one, with the - symbol, and the atp/wta computers only have room for one surname\n\n9875 posts ·\n\n#13 ·\n\nThat sounds like hard work. :lol: I have 4.

I Ethiopia you just take you father's first name and use it as your surname and so on for your kids. If they were Ethiopians, it would be Novak Srdjan or Maria Yuri :lol: Or Venus and Serena Richard.\n\nHenry Chinaski Discussion starter\n\n13760 posts ·\n\n#35 ·\n\nThat's the old viking way.

Everywhere they travel on the tour they are called by that double name, even in the press when they win, but it is not how they want to be called (just the father's last name in most cases).\n\n11130 posts ·\n\n#32 ·\n\nAndre♥;7157292 said:\n\nStill about Portuguese people: as an example, Frederico Gil's full name is João Frederico Limpo Franco Gil. :lol:\n\nBtw limpo means clean in portuguese and franco means straightforward! :lol:\n\nIf he had \"limpo\" in his name for tennis there would be a lot of jokes about him from English speakers. :devil:\n\nHenry Chinaski Discussion starter\n\n13760 posts ·\n\n#37 ·\n\nIn fairness verde is spanish for green and greengay does sound pretty funny especially as it relates to a certain \"punk\" band that I despise.\n\n11325 posts ·\n\n#38 ·\n\nSomething a bit off topic but wasn't Albert Costa called Alberto at the start of his career?\n\nWhy did he drop the \"o\"?\n\n3056 posts ·\n\n#41 ·\n\nAlberto is in Spanish, and Albert, in Catalan. Costa is Catalan, so maybe he preferred to be called as Albert despite his real name was Alberto (the one in the passports, etc.).\n\n0 Reply\n\n42127 posts ·\n\n#39 ·\n\nBy tradition we get two surnames. One from our dad and another from our mom's dad. Easy.\n\n5168 posts ·\n\n#43 ·\n\nIn southamerica, central america and Mexico, we have two surnames too , except in Argentina I think :shrug:\n\nI will contribute with something more to this thread; do you notice that players with anglo names change their real name into how they usually being called in an unformally way when they become more \"famous\": for example Andrew Roddick and Andrew Murray, Michael Bryan, Robert Ginepri, Thomas Haas... I remember time ago (last year I think) that it also appeared Luis Horna as Lucho Horna in his ATP profile :lol: , but it only was for a few weeks...\n\nFor conclusion, I think the thing to drop the second last name it's only to facilitate the pronnountion by the umpires, journalists, etc.\n\n7606 posts ·\n\n#60 ·\n\nI have plenty of argentinian friends and they have both last names too.\n\n0 Reply\n\n2437 posts ·\n\n#44 ·\n\nUs, Spaniards, are the result of a father and a mother therefore we carry both their last names. Even when women marry we do not change our last name. To change the last name is primitive, we do not belong to the husband. In the US not only your last name is changed but you become Mrs. John Smith! HORRENDOUS! primitive ...\n\nWhen these players become famous they can use only one because two would be too long.\n\n2437 posts ·\n\n#45 ·\n\nI actually know women in Spain that give their kids their own last name first, not the father's. I think that I know two French women that did the same thing."
