        "text": "I spotted that too. Some of the other surnames are Spanish (Aquino, Santos, Rom?n, Dur?n), or Middle Eastern (Al?, Salad?n), Deetjen looks Dutch or Flemish and Pujol is Catalan.\n\nYou spoiled my fun Chiri, Duran is one of Mr. AE's Cibao surnames, I wish I had a camera to capture the look on his face when I told him he might be part Haitian. One of his best friends from SD is a Roman, and he's as white as I am.\n\nI think there are definitely some inaccuracies in that 'study'.\n\nThat's what happen with the Espaillat family. They would be categorized as Haitian and many people are not even aware that the patriarch of the Espaillat was a Frenchman that migrated east and settled in the Cibao when all the disturbances began to arise in Haiti.\n\nI forgot to add in my previous post that for many years, the patriarch of the Espaillat was saluted by everyone with the title of Monseur Espaillat, a French title despite he was already on the Spanish part and should had been referred to as Se?or.\n\nGurabo, are you familiar with the series of books called \"Familias Dominicanas\" by Carlos Larraz?bal Blanco.\n\nIn over 10 years, I have only been able to buy 3 volumes. They're impossible to find.\n\nIf your surname starts with A, B, C, O or P, send me a PM and I can look up your family.\n\nMy wife's family name is Batista and her mother's name was Breton. What do your books have to say about those names?\n\nInteresting, yes, but how did the Bonetti's end up on that list? I'm pretty sure they are of Italian ancestry, Mr. AE worked with a couple of them in SD.\n\nThey have money and class! is the most important in DR.\n\nJJ\n\nYou spoiled my fun Chiri, Duran is one of Mr. AE's Cibao surnames, I wish I had a camera to capture the look on his face when I told him he might be part Haitian.

One of his best friends from SD is a Roman, and he's as white as I am.\n\nI think there are definitely some inaccuracies in that 'study'.\n\nYou don't have to show him my post\n\nDur?n may well be a Hispanicised form of Durand.\n\nMr C has a couple of those \"French\" surnames in the extended family too - Coiscou is still spelt and pronounced the French way and I have met people with that surname in Haiti.\n\nMy grandfather surname was Arnaud, his mother family.\n\nI was told is a French surname... Just curios where this people came from before they settle in Moca.\n\nJJ\n\nThe surname ARNAUD does not appear in the books....the closest is ARNAO, who came from France in the 1600s\n\nMy paternal surname is Lozano. They have had their seat in Valverde in the last century (and Santiago on the XIXth one) but the farthest back I have seen the surname here was from an oidor (Spanish colonial official) of Monte Cristi (and later Monte Plata) during the dark times of the devastations of Osorio in 1605-06.\n\nJust found out reading this article that some of my friends's surnames are rooted in Haiti.\n\nEncuentre al haitiano detr?s de su apellido \"dominicano\" consultando esta lista - Peri?dico Digital Dominicano - 7d?as.com.do\n\nTheses families have being in DR for many generation.\n\nJJ\n\nThen I can say with all property that I'm an all around spic (with an Anglo touch), cuz' these are my surnames:\n\nLozano, Gil, Bueno, Taveras, Soto, Matos, Melo, Pe?a, Vallejo, Kelly (this one from the BWI's, from my maternal great- great grand mammy), none of which are on that list.\n\nInteresting, yes, but how did the Bonetti's end up on that list? I'm pretty sure they are of Italian ancestry, Mr. AE worked with a couple of them in SD.\n\nMoreover, Moya Pons is BSing as far as the Pujol is concerned. The real root of that family was the Canarian inmigrant to our borders, Pablo Pujol, which would be coerced by Toussaint to vote on the 1801 constitution. To see more info about Canarian surnames, read \"La Colonizacion de la Frontera Dominicana 1680-1795\" from the Canarian historian Manuel Hernandez Gonzalez. While it's true that the Pujol would leave descendents in Haiti too (a proof of which is the Haitian intellectual Alexandre Poujol), it's not the less true that this would be in the elite, and not in the ex-slave mass, as Moya Pons is implying. Moreover, the Haitian intellectual in question that I mentioned would marry a woman from the Dominican branch of the family.\n\nI spotted that too. Some of the other surnames are Spanish (Aquino, Santos, Rom?n, Dur?n), or Middle Eastern (Al?, Salad?n), Deetjen looks Dutch or Flemish and Pujol is Catalan.\n\nDeetjen is a Dutch surname, the name being traced to the Dutch inmigrant Alfredo Detjeen, which was one of the first representatives of the congress of the first Republic, representing the town of San Miguel de la Atalaya, which is now in Haitian possession. I think that Moya Pons is doing the dishonest exercise of putting as \"Haitian\" some of the surnames there just because they happened to hail from the Central Plateau, which he seems to conveniently forget that it used to be Hispanic first.\n\nThe surname ARNAUD does not appear in the books....the closest is ARNAO, who came from France in the 1600s\n\nMy Mother allaways told me they came from france a few generation before my Dad was born.\n\nShe say there it was a white man who came in the 60s to visit the family.\n\nHe couldn't speak Spanish but Franch.\n\nJJ\n\nMoreover, Moya Pons is BSing as far as the Pujol is concerned.
