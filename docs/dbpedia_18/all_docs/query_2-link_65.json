        "text": "In 2017, after his successful restaurant in New York, Enrique Olvera opened Pujol to celebrate the essence of Mexican culture, and what better place than his homeland? Chef Olvera was able to transform Mexican street-food into a more sophisticated style. Simple ingredients, as chilies, beans, tomato, and corn, are at the base of Pujol menu; crafted with the finest techniques, to bring to life unexplored flavors, from the deepest roots of Mexico.\n\nPujol is located in the suburb of Polanco in Mexico City and is not what we expect from a Mexican restaurant. Modern and luxurious with stylish interiors of wood and marble, it’s simple in details, however it gracefully stands out. Pujol includes a spacious dining room and a bar section, that serves its own taco selection and Mexican-style drinks.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Pujol\n\nProducts are sourced locally and from the Chef’s own greenhouse, where he grows lettuce and herbs, located in Xochimilco suburb. Olvera exalts the work, not only of chefs but also, of the farmers and local producers.\n\nThis cuisine is rich, as it differs in style and versions of traditional dishes by regions and cities. Among, particular ingredients and spices we find the Mole Madre, Mole Nuevo. A dish that made Pojul known around the world but is still a mystery on the palate; the dense, spicy, and nutty taste of this sauce is the detail that impresses more than the meat, usually, aged over 1000 days. The dish is served with the sauce that draws two circles with a yolk of young sauce and a darker circle of a more aged one. The result is an explosion of flavors and the wonderful contrast between the two Moles.\n\nAddress: Tennyson 133, Polanco 11550, Mexico City\n\nWebsite: www.pujol.com.mx\n\nVictor’s, unique culinary creations by Christian Bau in Perl, Germany\n\nA dedicated team.
