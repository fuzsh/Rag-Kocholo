        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The jazz guys dealt with the same issue decades ago: How do you do something new and interesting amid the long shadows of greats like John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk?\n\nThe shadows are just as long when it comes to rock 'n' roll, where even the punks that tried to tear down the canon are now seen as part of it.\n\nSo what is a rock 'n' roller do in 2017?\n\n\"It's been a style of music for 60 years,\" says Daniel Pujol, the Nashville rocker who leads the band that takes its name from his surname. \"And in many ways is not unlike the Catholic liturgy, where you have a routine and performance and you know what the symbols mean. Except with rock 'n' roll and pop culture it's a sort of secularized media-saturated liturgy.\"\n\nOK, so how do you do your own thing - or, as the aesthetes would say, transcend? For a decade, the singer-guitarist has been giving it a good shot.\n\nPujol - who will lead his band to Now That's Class at 8 tonight - has mixed and matched (and at times deftly mismatched) a wide range of sounds and styles to create a charming blend of garage-rock and power-pop.\n\n\"I grew up in a small town in Tennessee called Tullahoma,\" says Pujol, via phone from Nashville. \"We didn't get many bands coming through town and my exposure to things was pretty much limited to popular music from the '50s to the '80s - so when I started discovering a lot of other music I was doing it my own way with a handful of friends and at the public library.\"\n\nPujol went to use the wifi, since he didn't have any at home.\n\n\"When I moved to Nashville I realized that how culturally studied and literate people are in more urban environments,\" he says. \"And I appreciated that exposure to things can be a lot more meaningful and intense when you're finding out about them in isolation.\n\n\"There's some really exciting about music when you're living in backwater,\" he adds, referring to his hometown, population 19,000. \"If someone gives you the Beatles 'White Album,' it can be a very big event.\n\nAt times, you get the feeling that Pujols soaked up a lot of music in isolation and got it right even he got it wrong. Songs such \"Black Rabbit\" are a refreshing blast -- sugar-sweet power-pop in structure yet it sounds as if it's played by high-speed lawn mowers.\n\nOr, perhaps, a punk-rock band weaned on garage rock, if you'd have some pop-culture references. His 2015 disc \"Kisses\" mixes music with spoken-word and comes from a similar place, in terms of attitude.\n\n\"I got into punk rock while reading about it at the library,\" he says. \"But I was more influenced by its rejected of mass media and consumer culture than the fashion of it. I understand having references in your music is a form of communication with people and familiarizing them with your music, because it reminds them of something else they've heard. But being reverential is boring - and you really want to transcend.\"\n\nMUSIC PREVIEW\n\nPujol\n\nWhen: 8 tonight.\n\nWhere: Now That's Class, 11213 Detroit Avenue, Cleveland.\n\nAlso on the bill: Slug Fest and Bitchseat."
