I think this is super cool and would love to hear some tips so I can keep up with him!\n\nFor instance, he once mentioned something like surnames ending in “-escu” and some others are indicative of Romanian ancestry. I could be recalling that incorrectly, but stuff like that I find very cool and I would love to hear some from your country! Please don’t hesitate to say obvious ones, too. :)"
