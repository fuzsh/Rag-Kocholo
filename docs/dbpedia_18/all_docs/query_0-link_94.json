        "text": "Background: Journalism and public relations are two fields that collaborate and compete with each other. Several studies have confirmed this dualism, where both terminologies are interrelated in the same scientific publication. Purpose: This study is aimed to find the interconnection between the two fields in several studies published in international journals. Method: This inquiry applies the bibliometrics method with data sources from the Web of Science and uses VosViewer as an analysis and mapping tool. Results: Results show that the number of keywords containing “public relations” counts more than “journalism.” This study reveals six clusters of keyword mapping that form specific themes: crisis communication management, ethics, professional education, public relations practitioners- journalist relationships, media relations, and publicity scope, news media management, and public relations and the media. Comparing the most cited references from the field of public relations and j...\n\nThere is no second opinion on the fact that in today&#39;s highly digitalized communication world, PR has emerged as an indispensable function in almost every organization regardless of its size and nature and it is the most important requirement for securing the desired outcome for every business policy or business initiative. It is also true that this profession is evolving everyday at an accelerating rate ever since the advent of Digital PR and various new and innovative forms of content messaging. But one should not forget the fact that no matter how experienced you are or how much skills you possess, the core is that until and unless you take help of research in planning and executing PR plans or strategies either by being updated about the current trends in information distribution or having an analytical data of the demographic profile of public or by conducting content analysis or readership studies etc, you cannot expect a desired outcome of your PR Programmes and PR strate...\n\nThis article traces the origins and continuing development of a research tradition that conceptualizes public relations as a strategic management function rather than as a messaging, publicity, and media relations function. The tradition began serendipitously with the development of the situational theory of publics in the late 1960s, followed by the application of organization theory to public relations, the symmetrical model of public relations, and evaluation of communication programs. The Excellence study, which began in 1985, brought these middle-level theories together and produced a general theory, a theoretical edifice, focused on the role of public relations in strategic management and the value of relationships with strategic publics to an organization. Since the completion of the Excellence study, scholars in this research tradition have continued to improve and furnish the edifice by conducting research to help public relations professionals participate in strategic decision processes. This research has been on environmental scanning and publics, scenario building, empowerment of public relelations, ethics, relationships, return on investment (ROI), evaluation, relationship cultivation strategies, specialized areas of public relations, and global strategy. I conclude that the greatest challenge for scholars now is to learn how to institutionalize strategic public relations as an ongoing, accepted practice in most organizations. Throughout the 40 years of my academic career, I have used the literature of philosophy of science and of cognitive psychology to inform my attempts to build public relations theory. Early in my career, I rejected logical positivism— the idea that theories are \" true \" because they reflect an underlying order in the\n\nPartisanship has been a topic of interest mainly for political scientists who try to understand its impact on political behavior. In a political context, the concept of partisanship explains the strong commitment of people to a specific party and how it influences their opinions, attitudes, decisions, and behavior in a one-sided way (Hetherington, 2016). Research on topics such as partisan voting, party identification, partisan political orientation , and mass partisanship was focused on the U.S. political experience and its two-party system. Communication scholars expressed interest in partisanship in studies on partisan press, partisan bias in the news, and partisan selective exposure to news. It is worth noting that very similar topics might have been discussed under different titles (e.g., biased and one-sided media) thus describing partisanship without mentioning the term. One rare discussion of partisanship was published in public relations literature within the context of the profession's ethics. According to Fitzpatrick and Gauthier (2001) and Curtin and Boynton (2001), Albert Sullivan (reviewed in Pearson, 1989) criticized excessive partisanship in public relations in his 1965 proposal for a theory of public relations ethics. According to Sullivan, partisan values were tied to loyalties such as commitment, obedience, and trust in the organization. In contrast to partisan values, mutual values consider the rights and well-being of others and emphasize institutional obligations to the public. Sullivan rejected public relations practitioners' tendency to rely too heavily on the views of their organization's management and provide zealous advocacy on its behalf while ignoring or minimizing other voices. Such partisan approach to communication involves self-serving messages incompatible with democratic open, inclusive, and dialogic communication. Partisanship thus reflects the strategic communicator's total identification with the employing organization and its top management in similar ways to a voter's identification with a specific political party. Political scientists explained such identification as an intense psychological attachment to a political group that reinforced rather than challenged voters' views. In the same way, the professional self-identity of partisan strategic communicators emphasizes total commitment to the values and goals of the employing organization. Such partisan practitioners see their role as promoters of the organiza-tion's public image at all costs and ignore or dismiss stakeholders' expectations and needs. A partisan approach is actually used in all types of organizations and all sectors-business, governments, as well as nonprofit associations. Based on Hal-lahan, Holtzhausen, Van Ruler, et al.'s (2007) definition of strategic communication,\n\nMost public relations practitioners and scholars agree that public relations’ functions include communication, stakeholder relationship management, reputation management, and strategic management. The purpose of this position paper is to continue the discussion on the current and future directions of the public relations discipline, which impacts both the practice and education of public relations. We start with a brief overview of the history of public relations and investigate the four functions of public relations (which have been suggested as paradigms) via an examination of seven studies on public relations practitioner roles in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland. After examining these studies, we suggest that there seems to be an increasing practitioner focus in Europe and Australia on public relations’ strategic management function, which marks a return to public relations’ earlier, more solid foundations. We contend that the professionalisation of the public relation..."
