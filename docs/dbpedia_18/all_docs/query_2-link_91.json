        "text": "The Portuguese man-of-war has been spotted in the waters of Torrevieja.\n\nAccording to Proyecto Mastral and the biologist Juan Antonio Pujol’s website, Crónicas Naturales, specimens have been observed near the coves and Cabo Cervera in Torrevieja.\n\nThe biologist notes that the presence of the Portuguese man-of-war had already been recorded in other parts of the Alicante coast, including Guardamar del Segura.\n\nHowever, he believes that the current situation does not appear to be alarming.\n\nPrecautionary Measure\n\nAs a precautionary measure, the Maritime Unit of the Local Police and the lifeguard service on Torrevieja’s beaches are on alert.\n\nAlthough it may resemble a jellyfish at first glance, the Portuguese man-of-war (Physalia physalis) is a colonial organism made up of several specialised individuals working together.\n\nIts upper part, which resembles a balloon or bladder, floats on the surface, giving it the appearance of a small boat.\n\nThis structure acts like a gelatinous sail, enabling it to drift with the wind, tides, and currents.\n\nBeneath the Surface\n\nBeneath the surface, the Portuguese man-of-war has long, venomous tentacles that can extend up to 50 metres.\n\nThese tentacles are equipped with stinging capsules that release toxins upon contact.\n\nContact with a Portuguese man-of-war can be harmful to humans.\n\nCommon Symptoms\n\nThe most common symptoms include severe itching and burning, but more serious reactions can include intense pain, nausea, fever, and in extreme cases, it could be life-threatening, especially for individuals with pre-existing health conditions."
