        "text": "I would divide my academic career into three periods. The first one, focusses on acquiring international teaching and research experience, from completing the degree (1988) to obtaining a full professor position (1997). I would highlight the following. (1) The Impact of the Doctoral Thesis, “Techno-scientific rhetoric and new reproductive techniques” (1993, ISBN: 8449000467), which progress and results were presented at national and international conferences (Alicante, 1988; Budapest, 1990; Barcelona, 1991; Seville, 1993; Lisboa, 1993; Chile, 1993; Athens, 1995), and in scientific publications (Eudema, ES, 1993; Visor, ES, 1995; Open University Press, UK, 1999). (2) The National Social Sciences Prize from the La Caixa Foundation, which led to a book publication “Non-delinquents: how citizens understand crime” (ISBN: 8476645082), with results presented to national and international conferences (Seville, 1993; Huddersfield, 1995). (3) Research and teaching experience at undergraduate and postgraduate level in England, thanks to the Batista-Roca postdoctoral fellowship (Reading, United Kingdom, 1994-95) and the professorship at the University of Huddersfield (1995-97). (4) Participation in transfer projects, such as The Labour Market in Vilanova (1989); Study of the Raval Neighbourhood for a Positive Intervention through Comprehensive Urban Planning (1989-90); Blood Donation in Catalonia (1990); Health reform in Catalonia: comparative analysis of urban and rural areas (1991); Study of the Impact of the Health Emergency Service 061 (1992-93); some of them presented at conferences (Santiago de Compostela, 1990; Manchester, 1991; Madrid, 1992) and published (Barcelona, 1991, ISBN: 8476656866). (5) Researcher in R&D project funded by the Ministry of Education (1995-98). (6) The publication of 3 books, 10 book chapters (Spanish and English publishers), 5 articles in national and Anglo-Saxon journals, 8 publications from conference presentations, and 29 presentations at conferences.\n\nThe second period focussed on the consolidation of the Department of Social Psychology (DSP) and the Master of Research and Psychosocial Intervention (MIIP). In this period (1997-2020), I highlight the following achievements. (1) Transformation of the Social Psychology Unit (SPU) into DPS. After obtaining the position of full professor, I was elected coordinator of the SPU (1998-2022). From this position, I actively participated in the transformation of the Unit into the DPS, coordinating and defining the academic contribution of the Social Psychology Discipline to the curriculum of the Faculty of Psychology. (2) Creation and consolidation of the MIIP. After consolidating the DSP, I took the task of designing the Master in Research in Social Psychology, of which I coordinated (2005-11). Subsequently, I participated in its professional redefinition, transforming it into an interdepartmental master's degree, the MIIP, which I also coordinated (2012-2020). (3) Organization of 3 international conferences. As a promotion and visualization strategy for the Master's Degree, I promoted and participated in the organization of three international conferences, organized by the MIIP : FEMIGRA: International Feminism and Migration Congress (2012); Critical Social Psychology: Discourse, Materiality and Politics (2013); Critical Social Psychology: Affect, Corporation and Politics (2015). These conferences promoted the MIIP and had an important on the enrolment of international students. (4) Participation and direction of research projects funded by: the Ministry of Education, DGICYT, (1998-00); Ministry of Education and Science, MEC, (2004-07); Women's Institute (2007-09, 2010-11); Agency for Management of University and Research Grants, AGAUR (2010-11); Catalan Women's Institute, ICD (2010-11). (5) Publications. Publication of 30 academic contributions in national and international journals.\n\nThe last period, from 2020 to the present, focusses on the internationalization and consolidation of research. I would like to highlight the following. (1) Obtaining significant national and international research projects: European Commission, EC (2019-21; 2020-24); Spanish Service for the Internationalization of Education (2019-23); Ministry of Science and Innovation, MICINN (2021-25); Agency for Management of University and Research Grants, AGAUR, (2023-25). (2) Certification of two research periods of six years. (3) Publication of seven articles in high tranked scientific journals.\n\nFinally, I would like to stress two aspects. (1) Students to whom I contributed to their Ph.D. are working as lecturers in Spanish, Latin American or American universities. (2) I have jointly developed a qualitative analysis methodology. The Methodology of Narrative Productions started in the 90s and has nowadays acquired international recognition. In 2023, the journal Qualitative Research in Psychology (volume 20, 4) had a special issue on Narrative Productions."
