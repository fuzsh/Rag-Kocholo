        "text": "Tag: Article\n\nHow to Stay in Havana without Dying in the Attempt\n\nAlmost two decades ago I arrived in Havana convinced that, after finishing my five years of university, I would return to my native city, like a Spaniard who returns home with the wealth of knowledge, the audacity of the capital and a certificate I would hang in my parents’ living room, over the TV set, just beside the Sacred Heart. Naïve….\n\nIt was a brutal shock, not so much because of the indescribable early morning train ride from Sancti Spíritus, practically being thrown onto the platform of the Central Station, but rather because of the 20 flights of stairs without an elevator that awaited me in the student dorm of F and 3rd, an old den of initiations, the building where I would stay for five intense and licentious years.\n\nI only needed a week in that place, retracing the stairs on an almost empty stomach, to promise and swear to myself that there was no way I would stay in Havana where the people, as my grandmother used to say, became “physically and spiritually lost.” Perhaps it was the bohemian nights, the readings of Mayito Wolf or the late nights preparing my thesis, but the truth is that I evidently took leave of my senses, because knowing what would happen, I burned my boats and stayed here.\n\nWork was never a problem. When I was a student I used to make a living writing for one or another media, for a wage that would now be ridiculous. Well, before it was also like that, but living in a student dorm, free and single, I got along in life. The problem was, is and will be the roof. I don’t live in Havana to work: I work to live in Havana.\n\nIn an exercise of historical masochism I once tried to add up how much I have paid in years and years of rent. I gave up halfway, because of my mental health and because that martyrdom simply was not worth it: I stayed and that’s it. I don’t regret it, since if I would have returned to my city I would have quite a paunch, a wife, a lover and a string of kids to feed by writing feature articles in farms and cooperatives.\n\nWell, I stayed, and only God knows what I have done to finance my dreams. Do you remember that song by Sabina, the one about the pirate with the wooden leg, the one about living other lives? Nonsense compared to what we “guajiros” (peasants) do to live (or survive) in Havana, a whore who opens her legs according to what you pay her. And that bitch is expensive. I am proof of this, having to sell sweets and recycled clothes, giving urbanity lessons in San Isidro and Cerro, doing publicity for home rentals and restaurants that I can’t afford, translating movie subtitles from Australian to Spanish, dividing myself into a thousand styles and pseudonyms, and stretching the day so that it has, let’s say, some 32 hours…just to pay the rent.\n\nIn addition, in that adventure I have walked Havana more than Eusebio Leal. Moreover, I doubt that our loquacious and very learned historian has even visited some of the corners where I have more than lost the status of mama’s boy with which I got to the capital. I can’t imagine the good Eusebio Leal waking up at dawn in Cocosolo, because your neighbor, who is always drunk, needs a match. Or buying cheap rum in Mantilla, powdered milk in Cayo Hueso, or eggs in Los Sitios…. Perhaps it could be, but I doubt it….\n\nIt’s not easy being from the countryside and living in Havana. Perhaps that’s why I enjoy it more, and I believe that if one blessed day my house it really mine, and not the place where I live, I would madly love its four walls, and I would live more peacefully, without fears, without the anguish of the end of the month, without the ghost of eviction.\n\nWhat peace and quiet…. How boring!\n\nClandestina: A way of creating “99% Cuban design”\n\nIn February of 2015, when the store and design studio Clandestina opened its doors a few blocks from the Capitolio, Idania del Río and Leire Fernández had set out to create a design boutique right in the middle of Old Havana, with San Sebastian, New York and Paris as references.\n\nAmid décor that includes pop-art hearts and nods to the unavoidable tradition of revolutionary poster-making, with the epic slogan “On to the sugar cane harvest,” a certain minimalist halo immediately distinguishes this place from the conventional labels framing more popular businesses that spring up all over the city on a daily basis.\n\nIt’s not an art gallery or a paladar (private restaurant). These two young women have found a way to prosper in a different enterprise, one that is economically sustainable, and with the fearlessness needed to open up a path of creative flexibility for designers whose desire is to offer a different image of Cuba today. Beyond the recurrent souvenirs that dominate the market and legitimize symbols of identity, their concern is for customers to find a certain touch of sophistication, which is often missing in national products.\n\nThe birth of a brand\n\nA declaration of principles identifies the T-shirts and purses sold by Clandestina: “99% Cuban design.” They started out with tank tops and posters by Del Río, which have attracted attention overseas, leading them to exhibit their work in the United States, Europe and Asia.\n\nThen they incorporated other garments: drinking glasses, pillowcases, hats, toys and items made-to-order. Their most ambitious project to date is making and establishing a Cuban clothing brand, Clandestina and Vintrashe.\n\n“What we offer is a discourse,” says Leire Fernández. “We’re interested in making a totally consumable product, for both local customers and visitors. And we would like for anyone from a reggaeton musician to an office worker to dress in our clothes.”\n\nA very discernable philosophy marks every piece in this store/studio, the idea that the value of their products does not lie merely in the final result, appearance or utility, but also in the daring and inventiveness involved in the whole process of their production. There is little or no similarity between the routines of production here and the artificial and mechanical processes of a capitalist megafactory, or its opposite, a Cuban state enterprise.\n\nCertainly, the recycling of a tank top that is turned into a Vintrashe miniskirt has different meanings for a Cuban and for those who are passing through the city and visit the store. And these young women entrepreneurs admit that it’s the sort of originality that Europeans love.\n\nIngredients for success\n\nDesigners are said to belong to a race of humans who spend their lives trying to understand the grace of how and why certain objects look better than others. But, how to transcend that mental and material state of being resulting from a context where a utilitarian sense, necessity, and a shortage of raw materials constrain the elegance of form?\n\nThis first year, Del Río and Fernández have contributed lessons that perhaps they were able to understand only from the whole of the creative process itself: it is only possible to be successful in a business here when it flows in the same logic of ideas and production used by Cubans to “resolve” things in their lives.\n\nEvery obstacle is met with a more criolla (native-born) solution, and the most unexpected situation is met with playfulness. When it is almost impossible to import cotton, at Clandestina, they opt to recycle garments from used clothing stores, or transform the ones that customers are wearing for a reasonable price. If there aren’t many potatoes on the market, they find some, color them, and put them for sale in a shop window. And last August, when U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visited Havana for the opening of the U.S. Embassy, they made a series of commemorative “Welcome Kerry” fans.\n\nThere is a well-known principle that a designer’s ingenuity is measured by his or her capacity for dealing with change, for bringing about the metamorphosis of something ordinary into an ordinary object. Idania del Río, a 2004 graduate of Cuba’s Institute of Design, ISDI, sums up the philosophy that has guided her project to success: “In Cuba, that’s how things are, and we love doing it this way.”\n\nValdés Jazz Club, a fusion of flavor and melody\n\nTo say the name Valdés, in the world of Cuban music, is to invoke jazz, swing, improvisation and other words that refer to that genre.\n\nLazarito Valdés, a well-known Cuban musician, arranger, and composer, leader of the popular band Bamboleo and an heir to the musical legacy of his surname, opened a new place a couple of months ago where music lovers can go to enjoy themselves; the Valdés Jazz Club.\n\nLocated at 105 Calle E, between Quinta and Calzada streets in Havana’s Vedado district, this new temple to music and cuisine is a place where flavor and sound converge.\n\nCarefully decorated, the club comprises a cafeteria, restaurant and bar, and in the evening it mutates and becomes an attractive jazz club. It also has a large smoking area, with a splendid terrace, or courtyard.\n\nPhotos of relatives, singers and musicians decorate its walls. The acoustics are fantastic, allowing the public to enjoy a good show. Every night, a different artist performs and the program is very open and constantly renovated. Maestro musicians such as José Luis Cortés, Bobby Carcassés, and Maraca are regulars, although others have brought a fusion of jazz and other genres, such as singers Kelvis Ochoa and Tania Pantoja, among others, including newcomers and veterans.\n\n“In my home, people always cooked. My grandfather, who is the forerunner of the musical part of our family, was a very good cook, along with my great-uncles, who were also musicians,” Lazarito told OnCuba.\n\n“My dad is one of the best, especially with Asian cuisine, and especially with Chinese cuisine, because he always alternated between that passion and music from a very young age, when he first got into martial arts. That’s where he met my godfather, Miguel Chang, a judo pioneer in Cuba. He would go with him every day to eat in Havana’s Chinatown, and to learn about China’s food traditions. In addition, my grandfather very much liked Spanish food; he was always cooking fabada [bean stew], ham and potatoes, paella, and other delicacies, and as a little boy I became familiar with many different flavors. That’s how my culinary passion was born, in sync with music and the opportunity of opening this place. I’m really pleased, really happy.”\n\nThe new restaurant’s menu proposes fusion cuisine, with a predomination of international and stylized Cuban dishes. It features seafood in a variety of preparations, and also a diversity of meat dishes and soups. This surprising space offers the public the possibility of enjoying contemporary trends in mixology, the art and passion of mixing flavors, textures and colors in beverages and foods, very much in vogue in bartending all over the world. Its wine list also features a notably wide variety.\n\n“The menu is based on dishes prepared by my ancestors, and there are also creations of my own, such as rice with ‘an artistic touch,’ which has a little bit of everything. We serve Arroz Valdés, similar to fried rice, but using a secret récipe that we can’t reveal because therein lies its charm,” the musican-cum-cook told us.\n\nModern times and tradition converge at the Valdés Jazz Club, where our traditional Cuban cocktails are enhanced with today’s trends. Spices like pepper and colorful tropical fruits give originality to its beverages, such as the house cocktail, the Cosmopolitan Valdés Jazz.\n\n“We always wanted to have a place for playing Cuban jazz, a place where musicians could perform their work. In the short time that we’ve been open, we’ve become like home for many of our artists,” Valdés told us.\n\nHello Cuba!\n\nThe restoration of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States marks a historical turning point for both countries. In terms of tourism, various scholars are analyzing the possible impact that could be created by the elimination of U.S. restrictions on travel to Cuba, even though all signs seem to indicate that it won’t happen in the short term. A number of tourism industry analysts have gone ahead and provided their predictions, and Professor José Luis Perelló Cabrera, an economist with the University of Havana’s Center for Tourism Studies, talked to OnCuba about some of these expectations.\n\nWe have to take into account that 50.79 percent of tourist arrivals to Cuba come from North America, that is, three large segments: Canada, our top market; the United States; and Cuban-Americans. The process aimed at normalizing relations, in terms of meetings and the signing of agreements, is moving faster than Cuba’s possibilities of preparing for increased tourism. It’s not just a question of U.S. tourism. According to reports from the National Office of Statistics and Information, ONEI, at the close of February 2015, tourism in Cuba (which had already increased compared to the previous year) had grown by 14.2 percent, which means strong growth occurred in all markets except for Russia and Argentina. All of that represents a challenge for Cuba, and time is needed.\n\nIt is also known that the United States is the main market for tourists to this part of the world, except for Cuba. It is a market with high levels of spending at the place visited, which represents economic advantages for both countries, translated into more airlines, travel agencies, offers from tour operators, competition in transport, and etc. In addition, there are the so-called gift exchanges. One of the measures announced by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, OFAC, is that each visitor to Cuba can import up to $400 worth of goods, including up to $100 in cigars and rum. The question would be whether that amount of Cuban-made products is enough to meet demand. In 2014, the island was visited by 91,254 people from the United States for reasons that included religion, education, research, and other, directly bringing in some $146 million for Cuba that year. At the same time, this is a challenge for the country, because it would have to supply its domestic market for foreign consumption.\n\nIn that sense, it is necessary to accelerate the pace of new construction provided for under the new Investment Law. This includes the expansion of Terminal 3 at Havana’s José Martí International Airport, which is underway, to achieve a capacity of four million passengers annually. This project could take two years, but during that time, Cuba’s situation could change greatly, increasing demand sharply.\n\nCan we talk about a North American market for Cuba?\n\nI think we should talk about a U.S. market, because in geographical tems, North America includes Canada, which is Cuba’s main tourism market. The reason we need to start doing so is the following: while in Europe we have France, Germany, Italy and Spain, which are all part of a single space or geographic territory, we must then prepare ourselves for considering the U.S. market as one big issuing market—a megamarket—and within that, we would also be talking about California and New York, for which different strategies would have to be prepared.\n\nI can assert that Cuba’s main tourism market is and will continue to be Canada. In 2014, Cuba was visited by 1,175,077 Canadians; however, it is unlikely that will be matched by an equal number of U.S. travelers. Market quotas would have to be analyzed based on historic quotas for the Caribbean; we’re talking about 6.8 million U.S. travelers to this region.\n\nWhat commercial and tourism interests does Cuba have in this market?\n\nObviously, the U.S. market is the larger market in terms of both commerce and tourism, and it is closer to Cuba. The interests are mutual. In terms of commerce, Cuba is going to buy a large quantity of products at lower prices, because of proximity, and the United States is going to sell a large quantity of goods to Cuba, increasing its market level. For the United States, the Cuban market is a virgin market that needs—I would say urgently—to be supplied in general to be able to increase the country’s domestic supply, both for foreign visitors and for the domestic market. Logically, the island will return—to a certain extent—to being a place nearby for average U.S. tourists to spend their vacations, consuming the same products that would be sold in the United States, but enjoying Cuba’s idiosyncrasy. I don’t think there are any interests other than commerce, tourism, and goodwill.\n\nIn your opinion, what are the most general travel tendencies of U.S. tourism?\n\nI think that the segments that would travel to Cuba, initially, would include people with Latino roots, young people 18-34, and older adults, for short stays. What would be the preferences of these segments that would travel to Cuba? About 78 percent would prefer to visit places of historic/cultural interest; 76 percent would be interested in shopping, including for Cubita coffee, Cuban cigars and cigarettes, a handcrafted guayabera shirt, or maybe a piece of artwork. Visits by these segments to cities and rural areas include so-called people-to-people exchange, authorized by the United States, and regarding which tourism specialists like me say: if only all global tourism were people-to-people, and not just sun and beach. Beyond the cultural and social implications, this type of approach brings the financial advantage of tourism. Tourists who come on all-inclusive trips don’t consume anything in the community; they don’t buy any hats or bats, because they’ve already paid and have everything they need at their hotel.\n\nForty-one percent would be interested in local food and drink, especially at non-state establishments, and in historic centers and excursions, preferably guided. Cultural and ethnic heritage is another motivation, along with nocturnal activities and aquatic sports, precisely because 18 percent of the interests of tourists to travel to the Caribbean are centered on these types of products. Cuba is an island and should exploit to the maximum its nautical tourism.\n\nIn your view, what interest does the U.S. maritime industry have in Cuba? How is the island preparing for nautical tourism?\n\nFirst of all, we need to take into account that the U.S. maritime industry is the largest in the world. The main cruise companies that operate the largest ships, with 5,400 passengers and 2,400 crew members, are veritable floating resorts. When any of these ships arrive at a destination, it’s comparable to the simultaneous landing at an airport of 16 Boeing 747 jets. Therefore, a whole number of conditions must be prepared for receiving these cruise passengers, who have everything on board and are out to find a people-to-people experience; that is, the attraction is the stopover.\n\nThe main ports for these cruise lines are on the southeast coast of Florida, and Cuba is the closest territory for any cruise itinerary. Transport by ferry, such as the commercial maritime lines in southern Florida, uniting the Bahamas and Havana, or direct lines, would permit a daily flow of passengers and cargo, with a significant cost savings for passage and transport.\n\nWith respect to yachting, we should note that more than one million recreational yachts sail between the southern coasts of the United States and Cuba. I think that the principal product-sector on the island, the one with the greatest tourism growth, is the nautical one, in every variant. In a scenario of rapprochement in relations with the United States, Cuba could become the principal nautical destination of the greater Caribbean, including its islands and the whole basin.\n\nFor this scenario, our country has been preparing a diversity of projects, although the cost of investment is in the millions. It is in that direction that our plan for tourism development and foreign investment should be aimed, as I see it. We are and will be a nautical destination by our very nature, as the largest island in the Antilles and as the center of the American continent’s geography. We are surrounded by water, and from it we will extract resources for building and developing a sustainable country and society.\n\nCuban anti-cholera vaccine\n\nDr. Rafael Fando, of Cuba’s National Center for Scientific Research, (Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas, CNIC) is the leading researcher for the anti-cholera vaccine. He began working on the vaccine since he was a student and continued after graduating. The CNIC has existed for half a century and the average age of its scientists is 40. They carry out biomedical research on natural products, environmental studies, and biological products for preventing infectious diseases.\n\nWhy work on a vaccine against cholera, a disease whose incidence is practically non-existent in Cuba?\n\nIt was an idea of Fidel’s, in 1991, when the epidemic began in Peru. Cuba was going through its most difficult years of the Special Period (economic crisis) at that time. The idea emerged because no pharmaceutical company would work on the issue; it’s not a vaccine that can generate major revenue. A number of us at different research center began the work, some with an inactivated variant, while we used a live vaccine to be administered in a single dose. Anti-cholera vaccines are meant for poor destinations, underdeveloped countries, which is why the ideal is for a single dose to be enough.\n\nWork on this vaccine has been going on for almost 25 years. Why so long?\n\nCuba does not have enough resources to devote them to rapidly developing a vaccine for a disease that we practically don’t have in this country. We’ve made progress to the extent that there’s been financing. The first vaccine candidates were obtained in ’96, and that same year we initiated clinical trials. In 2006 we were able to carry out a trial in Mozambique, but then the project came to a standstill and we came back to it in 2013, when we obtained financing to set into motion this costly system for evaluating vaccine.\n\nWhen cholera came to Haiti and we had some outbreaks in Cuba, we returned to the work in coordination with the Finlay Institute (to obtain experimental batches of the vaccine) and the Pedro Kourí Institute (which oversaw clinical evaluation).\n\nYou’ve never received international support?\n\nNever. Credits for this project are 100 percent Cuban, except for the trial in Mozambique, where there was co-sponsorship with that country’s health department.\n\nThe WHO believes that the Cuban vaccine is important for Haiti. Why?\n\nThere is an extensive cholera epidemic there, and coincidentally, the vaccine that we’ve been developing has the same serotype as the strain in Haiti. Our vaccine has the advantage that if we administer it properly, it provides protection against a subsequent infection.\n\nHow long will it take for the vaccine to be available?\n\nWe have to finish Phase II clinical trials. Then we would have to have a factory that would guarantee the necessary production. And moreover, the vaccine would have to be prequalified, that is, certified by the WHO. We need to locate a scenario where there is sufficient cholera development to be able to evaluate our vaccine in a Phase III study, where safety is also measured, but above all, effectiveness. In our trials, the vaccine has generated 100 percent protection against cholera, and in 80 percent of cases, it has prevented the infection of the individual as a consequence of the bacteria, which means we are preventing the disease from being transmitted, by acting as a barrier.\n\nIf vaccines already exist in the world, why not use them?\n\nBecause they are vaccines that are used in the travelers’ market; one dose costs 40 euros, and you need two doses. It’s not a vaccine that can be used by the countries that have cholera, which are the poorest.\n\nHow much would the Cuban vaccine cost?\n\nOur vaccine could compete with India’s, which requires two doses and costs about $3.70 per dose. In Haiti, 300,000 doses of that vaccine will be administered at a total cost of $3 million, a sum that is not feasible for countries that suffer from cholera. The advantage of ours is that we might have a better price, and by being administered in a single dose, we would save on an immunization campaign, which is more expensive than the vaccine itself.\n\nCould relations with the United States facilitate any type of collaboration?\n\nWithout question; it will do a lot to facilitate academic exchange. In 1999, I traveled to the United States, to a conference on cholera, but every other time I’ve been invited they’ve denied me a visa. I hope that we can achieve better connections now, and even investment to be able to develop this product. Today we can make batches of up to 4,000 doses in Cuba, but that’s not enough. A small investment is planned, to be able to obtain up to 250,000 doses annually, but that’s not enough either.\n\nWe are planning a factory in the Mariel zone to be able to achieve external financing. We would need about $40 million, and with those resources we could have the vaccine in a minimum of three years.\n\nHow do you give form to experience? Interview with Jorge Fernández, Director of the Havana Biennial\n\nWhat does the “biennial model” mean, and to what extent does that ideal model approach that of the Havana Biennial?\n\nFor me, the biennial model is like museums, like a burial and a resurrection; we move between the two things. Picasso used to say that museums were like funeral homes; that the artwork was alive in the studio, and as soon as it was taken to a museum, it was like it was buried. From time immemorial, these questions have been debated, but nobody has found another form of promoting and legitimizing art. What’s interesting in referring to the Havana Biennial is that it marked its differences right from the start. It was more of an underground biennial, which did not entail large sums of money, and that clearly had a deep conceptual objective of change and transformation, and that is what can be seen today, and what is recognized internationally. And more than 30 years have gone by since its start, which is why the Biennial also involves rethinking things—what we can contribute today within the international context is one of them. Talking about something new is extremely pretentious. I don’t think that anything new can be done in art. What we can do is mark certain differences, certain proposals than can be distinguished with respect to what’s being done elsewhere.\n\nSome people hold that the Havana Biennial, that “sounding board,” as Nicolas Bourriaud called it, is no longer a launching pad for artists who are not very visible inside or outside their spaces of action. Instead, the list of names increasingly features well-known artists, legitimized by galleries and international events. In this case, what would be the contribution of this year’s biennial?\n\nWhat’s interesting is creating intersecting dialogues. In this case, artists who are coming to the Biennial include Fredman Barahona (Nicaragua, 1989); Antonio José Guzmán (Panama, 1971); Ebony Patterson (Jamaica, 1981); and Steeve Bauras (Martinique, 1982), artists who are no so well-known outside of the Caribbean, and they will come into contact with great figures such as Michelangelo Pistoletto (Italy, 1933); Daniel Buren (France, 1938); Joseph Kosuth (USA, 1945). For many of these artists, the Havana Biennial is going to be an important launch. In other words, the event is not about a single glance, but also deploying your presence. I think that the Biennial will open up to the world more and more, but the world has its nuances. In the last two Biennials, I have championed the facilitating of generational, historic exchange, where certain hierarchies are managed between people from the art establishment who are now part of art history from the past century, and totally unknown artists from Central America, the Caribbean, and Africa. I’m also interested in creating a dialogue between our context, relatively young artists, and those who have a certain amount of international legitimacy. I can mention three of them who have won the Venice Biennale’s Golden Lion, taking into account that any award is always erratic. They are Tino Sehgal (Germany, 1976) and Gregor Schneider (Germany, 1969), with different proposals, with work that features processes, social insertions, something that they are also interacting with, reflecting and intervening in problems that are related to the Cuban space. Really, there are many artists at that level who are participating with us now.\n\nWhat will be the spaces and contexts for this edition?\n\nThere are many spaces. It’s not a question of finding a standard, given that it is a biennial that moves in the particular, not in the general. Art in its place. We have adapted to using the word nucleus—in everything that we’re talking about, there are, in effect, connectors, communicating vessels—but it’s not a question of putting things into groups by nucleus or theme. It’s a question of looking for that particular element that has to do with context, where that piece can function, even if that place is distant from another work in the Biennial. That is another risk. This is a Biennial that very much wants to involve neighborhoods, and in that sense, it’s been very important to have a dialogue with a group of architects who are concerned with phenomena, not just of the visual aspect of the architecture, but also of phenomena that have to do with urban planning, how to create new “urbanisms.” Some have very thorough studies—and we’re talking about Casablanca, or Parque Trillo. Moreover there are young people who are connected with others who are more experienced. It’s also important for theaters to function, too, not with cultural programming outside the Biennial, but also as part of it. Exploring this area of intersection between dance, theater and performance. All of this is important for the twelfth edition (of the Biennial). It’s the same with music, which is also going to have a major presence. In that sense, many artists who come from other countries are going to work on that relationship of intersecting disciplines, demonstrating that music is also a medium of expression related to the visual arts.\n\nÁngel Íñigo Pérez. Sculptor\n\nIn what used to be called Yateras, now the city of Manuel Tames, in Guantánamo province, a zoo filled with stone animals sits atop a hill. A strip of land still full of dense brush, despite its concrete paths, is home to these beasts. And if one looks closely, they even seem to shake their limestone-and-moss loins, darkened by the humidity of countless rainstorms and dewy mornings, emerging from green vines and fantasies.\n\nÁngel Íñigo Pérez is a man from the countryside and a self-taught sculptor. His father was the famous Ángel Íñigo Blanco, also self-taught, who created this fantastic panorama. The stone zoo, the only one of its kind in the world, was created on Dec. 21, 1977, on a farm, the Finca San Lorenzo.\n\nFrom a very young age, I would see my dad carving those huge rocks that had slid down from the mountains thousands of years ago, and that had a big influence on me. You have to have a real vocation for sculpture! It is an art that requires a lot of work; you need determination and a lot of talent to continue. A rock is just a rock when you first look at it, but you have to see what it has inside, what forms it can take.\n\nThis Ángel is a chivalrous man with the strength of a giant. He speaks calmly, as if his daily battle with stone hasn’t hardened him. For 15 years, he worked as his father’s assistant. As evidence of this, 120 of the stone zoo’s 426 animals were sculpted by him.\n\nMy first piece was a little donkey that is over there, on the hill. My dad asked me to make it. Previously, when I was 10 years old, I made some small sculptures at home, but when I was 20 I began my job at the zoo.\n\nYou gradually find your own line, your own style, which is why my sculptures are now depicting the world of farmers. The zoo’s surroundings are what suggested the farmer theme to me. Each piece takes a while, depending on volume and complexity. For the last two years, I’ve been creating a life-size bohío (palm-thatch hut). The rocks I use are limestone, which are right there on the farm; I don’t move them anywhere.\n\nThe bohio is enormous, like an ancestral rock. When you see his tools (a chisel, small mallet, pick, and machete) you can understood the magnitude of the job. On the outside, it looks like a typical rural bohío; his titantic task now is to recreate the interior with several rooms.\n\nI have three children. One son, who’s 19, has artistic leanings, and studied at the Visual Arts Academy; another, 14, is studying the trumpet; and my 7-year-old girl says she’s going to be a doctor. Maybe the continuation of my work is guaranteed.\n\nI ask him to pose for me inside the bohío. He’s almost finished the living room. The sculpture of a woman stands at the window and a farmer drinks coffee, standing up. Ángel sits down on one of the two stone taburetes (rustic chairs); his father is surely sitting in the other.\n\nThe sound of Miami\n\nIt’s not a surprise anymore. Every weekend, Miami fills up with Cuba. Wherever you go, you find music, dancing and enjoyment. Little by little, the city is abandoning the sordid space of memory and looking at the island’s culture as a friendly part of daily life.\n\nWhile the Torricelli bill, in its Track Two form, outlined the people-to-people policy with the goal of the participation of Cuban academics, artists, and intellectuals in U.S. forums, what has come to be called “cultural exchange” is a different phenomenon. Beyond ideology or a deliberately political use of the issue, what is happening far exceeds any predictions.\n\nIn culture, the elements associated with the constitution of nationality travel with immigrants. Nobody finds it strange that in cities marked by certain immigrant populations, these populations cultivate and extol their cultures. In the case of Miami and Cuba, a sector of the Cuban community sees the growing participation by artists from the island as a deliberate maneuver by the Cuban government to influence, penetrate and weaken anti-government positions.\n\nThe accusation of unequal exchange is made; that Cuban artists based in Miami cannot perform in Cuba and don’t enjoy the same freedom of expression there enjoyed by some musicians in defending their ideas in Miami.\n\nThis same sector wants Willy Chirino, Gloria Stefan and Paquito d’Rivera to perform in the Plaza de la Revolución, and to be allowed to express themselves politically. But it has been these artists themselves who have set conditions on going to Cuba.\n\nIt is at least questionable that artists should renounce having a natural relationship with their public. It is strange that they should set conditions, or shield themselves behind a government. With that attitude, the only ones deprived of enjoying their art are the same people they are claiming to defend.\n\nWhat’s certain is that with or without conflicting positions, increasingly more émigré artists are performing in Havana’s plazas. Some of them have expressed a desire to move back to Cuba, such as Manolín, “El Médico de la Salsa,” or Issac Delgado. Others, such as Tanya or Pancho Céspedes reunite with their natural public without any complexes, and with the freedom of offering their art to those who want to enjoy it.\n\nThe media is trying to create the idea that there is a Ministry of Cultural Exchange that is contrary to the interests of the Cuban community. For them, the United States is an accomplice to the Cuban regime, because it permits a disparity to exist between the number of artists who come and go. They don’t understand that in any case, the exchange is not between Cuba and Miami; it is between Cuba and the United States. There needs to be an understanding that this participation is a result of the logic of interaction between an artist and his or her public, not political planning.\n\nThe most recent incident was caused by the Buena Fe concert at the Miami Dade Auditorium. Those opposed to Cuba’s social project attacked the performance and tried to sabotage it in every way possible.\n\nFor once, common sense prevailed and the mayor of Miami-Dade County, Carlos Giménez, said that the concert would not be suspended, and that in his county, despite the protests, U.S. law would be upheld. On the day of the concert, at about 5 p.m., according to the Miami Police, the peak number of “protesters” was reported to be about 300. At the start of the concert, three hours later, almost 2,000 people were singing “Cuba Va” and the other 22 songs that the duo played for their public.\n\nNeither the 300 people protesting outside nor the almost 2,000 enjoying the concert represented the entire Cuban community resident in the United States, but while these may be antagonistic forms of participation they don’t necessarily have to be exclusive. You can’t describe as anti-Cuban somebody who thinks that praising Fidel or Raul can be offensive for part of the émigré community, in the same way that loving them cannot be a motive for being insulted. In the end, we enjoyed the concert without worrying about the placards or the shouts of “communist” and insults. They enjoyed their protest as well, without worrying about the fact that in the theater, people were on their feet singing the songs that have accompanied a generations of Cubans for the last 10 years.\n\nOf the Cuban artists who fill Miami’s halls, not all are coming from Cuba. The dynamic itself of culture, along with demographic changes in the émigré community, show that the times of exclusion are over. Recently-arrived Cubans want to stay in touch with their culture; they want to enjoy their music, film, and visual arts. The same way that they go to the concerts of Los Van Van, La Charanga, David Torrens or former members of Habana Abierta, they also seek out Cuban soap operas, TV series and movies on the Internet.\n\nIt is time to stop using the phrase “cultural exchange” for what is a natural reencounter between members of a cultural community with its own identity. The participation of art produced on the island in North American spaces is for the North American public a way of approaching the culture of a neighboring country that it cannot fully enjoy because of an absurd policy. For Cuban immigrants, it is a question of being in contact with our identity, with their common noise, with the atmosphere from which we have distanced ourselves but which we have never given up.\n\nCulture is the soul of the nation. Beyond any slogans that attempt to place equal signs between homeland, state, country, government, and nation, it is through culture that identity becomes rooted, something that rises above any specific ideology or politics.\n\nA Cuban arrives at this piece of land 90 miles from home and feels that its smells, mixed in with the sea and traditional food, is what defines him. Hundreds of Cuban flags line the main streets of this city and at every other step, an ad reminds you that you can send money to your family, or how cheap it is to call the island.\n\nNow, Miami also sounds like Cuba.\n\nSandra Ramos: My commitment is to freedom\n\nPainter Sandra Ramos has made her apartment in Miami into an extension of her studio. Her table, floor, and walls hold paintings that are finished or half-finished; fragments of that world of loss and disillusionment that can be seen in her work. From one wall, the Christ of Havana observes me; a bridge emerges from his stone chest and leads to the clouds, or heaven, or maybe nowhere. The painting is called “Christ” and belongs to a series of digital prints, Puentes, from 2004. “For me, bridges are very necessary,” she admits.\n\n“You spend your life on a bridge, and that’s good. Each person should follow his or her bridge, or path, even if in the end, you don’t know where it leads.” In her voice, you can still perceive something of that innocence that identifies the little girl, a combination of herself and Lewis Carroll’s Alice, who is the central figure in many of her paintings. That character appeared in 1993, in the first of her many solo exhibition: Manera de matar las soledades (Way of Killing Lonelinesses).\n\nBy that time, a number of the themes that have marked Sandra’s work had emerged: immigration, unattainable dreams, the crisis of the 1990s, the fall of the socialist bloc, the end of utopia; conflicts that marked Cuban society and her personally. “This little girl character initially was a self-portrait and then it almost became a symbol of my generation,” she says in an interview.\n\n“That series includes a painting, “Mi diaria vocación de suicida” (“My Daily Vocation for Suicide”) which is one of the most important for me, because it is related to my questions about the role that artists should play in society, and their commitment to their context. In addition to personal catharsis, art also transcends the artist as an individual and becomes something shared that reflects his or her era, or time.” Maybe that is why she no longer lives in Cuba but has never stopped feeling like part of the country’s everyday reality: “I always had a certain resistance to leaving Cuba because it was where I obtained the themes for my work, and I have always felt like I have an obligation to do something for Cuban society.\n\nIn fact, I still feel that. Even though I live somewhere else for personal reasons, it doesn’t mean that I’ve stopped belonging to Cuba. Now we are going through a process of change and I think that the next five years will be very important for defining the path of Cuban society, to which we are all committed, and that goes the same for those of us outside and in [the country].” Sandra will return to Cuba in October as part of the project “Ellas crean” (“Women Create”), a festival of creative women organized by the Women’s Institute of Spain, and held for the first time in Cuba last year.\n\nThis time, Ramos will work with trova singer-songwriter Gema Corredera on the set design of the recently-restored Martí theater for a concert by Corredera. “For me it is very important to work with Gema, because my work has a lot of references to Cuban trova and I think it is positive that all artistic expressions will be linked to create a much more varied and complete show, something that enriches the public.”\n\nIn addition, Sandra views cultural exchange, especially what is currently taking place between Cuba and the United States, as vital both for the development of Cuban culture and so that Cuban artists will be recognized outside the country. “It is something that has to do with freedom; if people are limited by one side or another, that doesn’t contribute to anything. I think that exchange should not just be cultural, but also scientific. There should be a flow of people going both ways, and everybody should be able to travel and learn and come to his or her own conclusions.\n\nThat is also an important part of freedom.” She adds: “Freedom is a concept that is very difficult to classify because it varies according to the person, but I think that we all should have the freedom to be different, for our individuality to be respected, and to have freedom of movement and expression. My commitment is, above all, to freedom.”\n\nJewelry design route\n\nJEWELRY DESIGN IS ONE OF THE ARTISTIC manifestations that has developed the most in Cuba in recent years. All over the country, diverses artists, some art school graduates and others self-taught, have enriched the country’s artistic heritage with excel- lent work that can compete with the best on the continent.\n\nCuban jewelry is made out of all types of materials: metals are combined with precious and semiprecious stones, mother-of- pearl, wood, coral, bone, quartz crystals, and more. The most beautiful work is made out of silver, although out- standing pieces can be found in gold, platinum, nickel silver, titanium, and different alloys and combinations. Cuba has ex- cellent jewelry-makers, true masters whose work can be seen in galleries and other exhibition and marketing spaces.\n\nAll of the pieces created with these metals are very beautiful and enduring. Unique in their design and elaboration, they spark praise from critics and are also very popular. This has made it possible for them to enjoy a good deal of demand among the public, both domestic and foreign. Visitors can take home a lovely piece or two reflecting an intertwining of contempo- rary tendencies with the most authentic traditions of Cuban jewelry-making.\n\nSCALE, TITANIUM AND THE JEWELS OF A SCULPTOR\n\nInfused with the dynamic quality of modern life, the sculptures and jewelry made by Cuban artist Jorge Gil have the same persistent and whimsical qualities as their creator. Titanium is a metal that has almost no history, and Jorge is helping us to write that history with his original pieces.\n\nWhen we look at his work, all kinds of questions come to mind about the genesis of his project “The jewels of a sculptor”: what exists according to scale? What is the difference between a small corporal sculpture and the same piece, oversized? In the process of being made, Gil’s unique and exotic works withstand heavy blows, because he avoids soldering and finds solutions within the qualities of this metal, which when bent can be colored and transformed into a series of jewelry pieces that escape conventional canons and terms.\n\nSimplicity, audacity and innovation are then translated into small sculptures that can exist on human skin.\n\n(+537) 8810209, (+535) 2724428/ [email protected], [email protected]/ www.jorgegil-jewellery.com\n\nBETWEEN EXPERIMENTATION AND MOVEMENT\n\nWhen referring to experimental and innovative jewelry design in Cuba, Osvaldo Castilla is an essential name. In his transgressive and irreverent pieces, design is more important than materials, and the preciousness of the elements used is subordinated to concept and esthetics.\n\nFollowing his first exhibition in 1979, he revolutionized the way that jewelry is made and conceived of in this country. Many of his exhibitions become true visual arts actions, in which he fuses his conception of pieces and performance art.\n\nModels and dancers wear his creations, and his kinetic sculptures provide a more complex vision of how this creator views jewelry design: what’s essential in his art is movement.\n\n(+537) 2094934/[email protected]\n\nSKILL AND POST-MEDIEVAL INSPIRATION\n\nAs the educator of several generations of artists, creator Miguel Ángel Pulgarón moves skillfully between sculpture and jewelry-making. He bears the name of a renaissance maestro, and his imagination—perhaps reincarnated—has produced medieval-inspired pieces that very well may have existed before, and that are now presented to the viewer after having mutated into art.\n\nAs with other artistic expressions, when we observe this artist’s work, we realize that he has appropriated Cuban and foreign influences from all sorts of eras to consolidate a style and materialize his own code into unique pieces, unprecedented in our context, and with great mastery, he invents abstract forms that challenge the imagination of those who see them to interpret them through their own subjectivity.\n\n(+537) 6403755\n\nMETAL BRAIDS WITH THEIR OWN LIGHT\n\nDespite his youthfulness, Yaniel Rodríguez has been able to achieve his own identity within contemporary Cuban jewelry design. The composition of his pieces reflect his marked interest in highlighting formal elements by emphasizing the volume, texture, and geometry of his jewelry.\n\nHis esthetic search, expressed through his mastery of jewelry-making technique, always involves playing with forms imbued with sculptural minimalism, leading to elaborately-designed, superbly-made pieces.\n\nFabric, relief, braids, and embossed metals characterize his work. Silver is the material he prefers for his work, using it in harmony with his skillfullness to invite us mortals to give thanks for the fire.\n\nContactos: (+537) 8813938/[email protected]\n\nROX JEWELRY, FEMININITY HALFWAY BETWEEN GEOMETRY AND DESIRE\n\nLike designer Rosana Vargas, Orfebrería ROX (ROX Jewelry) was inspired by minimalism, sculpture and engineering, using refined lines and a mirror-like shine on flat surfaces to present authentic examples of Cuba’s best contemporary jewelry design.\n\nThe pureness of the lines, delicacy of the metal features, freedom of movement, sophistication, femininity, modern quality and original elegance are all elements that characterize her innovative way of working in a difficult trade, one that male-dominated for many years. Her impeccably made pieces can sway the opinions of those who still hesitate to call jewelry-making art.\n\nROX confirms that a good piece of jewelry is forever, and while perfection does not exist, you can try to come close.\n\n(+537) 2091479, (+535) 2817118, (+535) 3814030/ [email protected]\n\nWEAVING SILVER\n\nAmong the disparate conceptual lines of contemporary Cuban jewelry- making, the work of young artist Jorge Oliva stands on its own. His pieces, in silver and copper, reminds us of the work of a spider: he weaves with delicate metallic threads to achieve a diversity of forms that can be applied to all types of jewelry.\n\nHis manual dexterity in handling small pieces has allowed him to move more confidently into large-format work; his sculptures are also praised for their originality.\n\nHis esthetic concepts are imbued with the study of forms and filigree, and in some of his figures, volume and depth dominate any interpretation of the piece.\n\n(+535) 3467495/[email protected]/ www.filigranasoliva.atodoclick.com\n\nPhotos: Darío Leyva"
