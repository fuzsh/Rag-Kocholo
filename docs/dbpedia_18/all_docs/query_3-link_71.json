        "text": "Developed by i-ON by Pujol\n\nDynamic window display\n\nAn interactive touch window with overhead projection. i-ON by Pujol can turn a normal window display into a great surface to project any kind of advertisement with which passers-by can interact.\n\nThis development means a great progress for advertising. The dynamic window display by i-ON by Pujol allows each person passing by the store to search, or even buy, any item catching their attention. This window is active 24/7, 365 days a year.\n\nInteractive tables\n\nRestaurant businesses\n\nThis innovation makes it possible to place orders directly from the table, as well as to access the Internet. Waiting time is considerably reduced because the clients are in charge of placing their own orders. In addition, this makes the work of waiters and kitchen staff easier.\n\nEducation\n\ni-ON by Pujol technology provides the students with interactive tables on which they can write, draw or watch projections shown by the teachers.\n\nSpecial laminated glass inserts\n\nOur work has allowed us to laminate glass with every kind of material, including marble plates or high-quality gold fragments.\n\nCertificates\n\nI-ON by Pujol complies with every necessary applicable regulation according to ECC law on glazing construction in exterior spaces. In addition, we demand that all the necessary products for lamination (EVA by Evalam or AB-AR) are tested by external laboratories and certified according to the use we will make of them.\n\nSafety solutions are also granted the certifications guaranteeing the suitability of the different laminated compositions for a variety of uses involving safety.\n\nFurthermore, PDLC from i-ON by Pujol has been certified more than 100,000 on/off cycles."
