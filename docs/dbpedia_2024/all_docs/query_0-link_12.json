We'll dive into their narrative poems on love: Galip’s masnavi Love and Beauty breathes new life into rhyming couplets, and Robinson’s “Sappho and Phaeon” contributes to the revival of the sonnet sequence, with both poets writing at historical crossroads. As the Ottoman Empire undertakes structural modernization efforts amidst decline, England expands its colonial outreach while contending with the legacies of the American and French Revolutions. We will analyze how these poets navigate the delicate balance between tradition and innovation, with a fundamental inquiry into their use of ornamentation and excess. Coleridge’s quip, “she overloads everything,” nods to Robinson’s affiliation with the “Della Cruscans,” while Galip’s opulent works reflect the so-called “Indian style.” What draws poets, or anyone, to such ornate expressive techniques? We'll ponder these questions, exploring their intersections with gendered, cultural, and political realms. In doing so, we might just stumble upon intriguing theories to explain the eventual rise of symbolist movements in modern art.\n\nMelih Levi\n\n2024-2025 Autumn\n\n21810 The Werewolf in Literature and Film\n\n(GNSE 21810 )\n\nHuman transformation into animals (and into wolves in particular) is a recurring trope in many cultures’ storytelling. Authors have used the story device to explore the nature of humans and animals, human fear and vulnerability, psychological problems and mental illness, gender and sexuality, social/racial hierarchy, marginalization, identity, and our own capacity for violence and savagery. In this course we will examine werewolves in literature and film from several cultures (French, English, German, Finnish, Blackfoot, Japanese) in English translation, primarily from the late 20th century onward. We will focus on how the aforementioned themes are used and developed in each work and the overarching patterns of werewolf stories. Students will write a final analytical paper or produce a creative project.\n\n2024-2025 Autumn\n\n28633 Monkeys, Elephants and Cows\n\n(SALC 28633 )\n\nNon-human animals are ubiquitous in India’s literary and visual cultures, whether as characters in epics, fables and moral tale; as objects of study by court scholars and painters; as pets and hunting companions; as part of the Hindu pantheon (such as the elephant-headed god Ganapathi, or the monkey god Hanuman) or as symbols and metaphors. This course explores the complex interactions among human and non-human animals and the realms of animals/mortals/immortals through examples from India’s literatures, Indian painting and film - across times, places, spaces and religious traditions. It will conclude with contemporary debates on animal activism and provide a non-Western entry point into the field of animal studies.\n\n2024-2025 Autumn\n\n26771 Stories of Oceans and Archipelagos\n\n(FREN 26770, CEGU 26770, RDIN 26770)\n\nAccording to Fijian-Tongan writer Epeli Hau‘ofa, “There is a world of difference between viewing the Pacific as ‘islands in a far sea’ and as ‘a sea of islands.’” In this course, we will delve into the “world of difference” that exists between viewing islands as remote and insignificant, and considering them as crucial nodes in an ever-expanding planetary network. Simultaneously, we will consider the stakes of moving away from traditional representations of the ocean as a blank canvas for human movement, to instead consider it as a vibrant material and multispecies space. This course will encourage students to formulate their own approaches to cutting-edge debates in archipelagic theory and critical ocean studies, and to situate those debates within the broader fields of environmental humanities and postcolonial studies. Readings will be drawn from the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean (including the Caribbean Sea), and the Indian Ocean.\n\nNikhita Obeegadoo\n\n2024-2025 Spring\n\n28690 The God of Small Things, Revisited\n\n(SALC, ENGL)\n\n2024-2025 Spring\n\n20109 Comparative Literature – Theory and Practice\n\n(ENGL 28918)\n\nThe course will consider translation—both theory and practice—in relation to queer studies, transgender studies, disability studies, and gender and women's studies. We will consider the intersections of translation with religion, postcolonialism, decolonialism, and feminist thought. Authors studied will include Monique Balbuena, Roque Raquel Salas Rivera, Kate Briggs, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, and others. There will be workshops with guest translators. Students may undertake a final research paper or translation project. A minimum of reading knowledge with at least one non-English language is required.\n\n2024-2025 Winter\n\n22515 Reading and Writing Ecological Objects\n\nThis seminar will explore how writers, philosophers, and anthropologists think through one ecological object of investigation e.g., the air, oil, moss, rocks, palm trees, or mushrooms. We will study how a seemingly simple and local living or non-living object can be a guide, source, muse, and catalyst for social, political, and cultural knowledge. How do 21st-century thinkers integrate creative practices like autobiography, storytelling, and speculative fiction to engage with the politics of the earth? We will reflect on this question to frame our own interdisciplinary final projects. The course literature will focus on topics like the Anthropocene, deep time, extractivism, decoloniality, indigeneity, and futurisms; We will close-read representative works by Anna Tsing, Marisol de la Cadena, Achille Mbembe, Reza Negarestani, Eduardo Kohn, and Robin Wall Kimmerer.\n\n2024-2025 Winter\n\n24510 Kawaii (cuteness) culture in Japan and Beyond\n\n(ENGL 24510, GNSE 24511 )\n\nThe Japanese word kawaii (commonly translated as \"cute\" or \"adorable\") has long been a part of Japanese culture, but, originating from schoolgirl subculture of the 1970s, today's conception of kawaiihas become ubiquitous as a cultural keyword of contemporary Japanese life. We now find kawaii in clothing, food, toys, engineering, films, music, personal appearance, behavior and mannerisms, and even in government. With the popularity of Japanese entertainment, fashion and other consumer products abroad, kawaii has also become a global cultural idiom in a process Christine Yano has called \"Pink Globalization\". With the key figures of Hello Kitty and Rilakkuma as our guides, this course explores the many dimensions of kawaii culture, in Japan and globally, from beauty and aesthetics, affect and psychological dimensions, consumerism and marketing, gender, sexuality and queerness, to racism, orientalism and robot design.\n\n2024-2025 Winter\n\n24725 Transatlantic Feminism. French, Francophone, and North American perspectives (20th-21st c.)\n\n(GNSE 23172, FREN 24725)\n\nThis course explores modern and contemporary feminism through a transatlantic lens. We will consider three major moments and sites of a multi-centered conversation. First, we will explore the modernist desire for cosmopolitanism which drew writers across the Atlantic (Simone de Beauvoir’s adventures in the US; Djuna Barnes and Gertrude Stein’s lives in Paris). In the central part of the quarter, we will focus on the period between 1960 and 1990 which witnessed intense conversation and contestation between a French paradigm of “écriture féminine” (Hélène Cixous, Monique Wittig), and the rivalling practices and theories in America (from Adrienne Rich and Mary Daly to Judith Butler). Finally, we will explore the ways in which feminist thought has endeavored to account for race, class, rurality, and disability (from Maryse Condé to Aurélie Olivier and Roseline Lambert). The course will explore various media (novels, poetry, theater and performance, film), and various ways to engage critically and creatively with this history of transatlantic feminism.\n\nLéon Pradeau\n\n2024-2025 Winter\n\n28550 Comparing epic, then and now\n\n2024-2025 Winter\n\n21505/31505 Mourning and Struggle in African, Native American, and Palestinian Narratives\n\n(NEHC 21500, NEHC 31500, RDIN 21500, RDIN 31500)\n\nThis course focuses on expressions of mourning and explores how in response to catastrophic experiences and histories of colonialism, writers and filmmakers narrate loss and trauma. We will investigate how these authors renegotiate their identities, how they fashion national and political imaginaries, and how they envision alternative futures in their diverse bodies of work. Engaging with an array of literary and cinematic depictions, our aim will be to examine and compare the rich landscape of voices that animate African, Native American, and Palestinian experiences and representations. Together, we will analyze source materials related to the themes of violence, memory, gender, race, and trauma. Through our weekly assignments and discussions, we will seek to determine the tropes and aesthetic tools that ignite modes of storytelling, and to answer: how do writers and artists employ aesthetic form to portray catastrophes? How might expressions of grief also be mobilized for resistance and struggle?\n\nOur class will be organized into three modules, touching upon African, Native American, and Palestinian prose, poetry, and film alongside theoretical works in memory and trauma studies. By the end of the quarter, students will be able to develop their own complex evaluations of these narratives—and recognize how comparisons through artistic expression can be a powerful tool for amplifying a multiplicity of stories about mourning and defiance.\n\nStephanie Kraver\n\n2024-2025 Winter\n\n21815/31815 Strange Lit: Estrangement and Literature\n\n(ENGL 21815, NEHC 21815, RLST 26815)\n\nThis course explores the genre of the strange, weird, bizarre and wonderous in literary works from around the world and across various time periods. In contrast to the voyeuristic and expected othering of the ‘exotic’, the course interrogates the strange as an aesthetic mode that estranges the reader and disturbs and upends our familiar and predictable worlds. Theorists have explored art’s ability to unsettle our automatized perception, interrogating our relationship to reality, the way we know things, and the basis on which we make assumptions. This course will trace how specific literary forms (like magical-realism, fantasy, sci-fi, miracle literature, comedy/dark comedy, and even scripture) evoke wonder and a sense of the strange. We will explore how these genres mystify and make strange things like the individual, society, modernity, the nation-state, the secular, economy, and more to unearth the myth-making inherent in processes of world-building, as well as in narrative. We will see ghosts in court, hallucinating nation-states, dead narrators, animated-inanimate objects as we move into the world of dreams, madness, and the supernatural in literary works from Iceland, Iran, Palestine, Japan, Egypt and more.\n\n2024-2025 Autumn\n\n22501/32501 Vico’s New Science\n\n(FNDL 21408, ITAL 22900, ITAL 32900)\n\nThis course offers a close reading of Giambattista Vico’s seminal work, New Science (1744), which aimed to challenge prevailing notions regarding the fundamental principles of humanity. Often dubbed the “last Renaissance man” or a representative of the “Counter-Enlightenment,” Vico rejected the detached rationalism of his time as he set out to recover the attitude and emotions relevant to the humanities in contrast to the natural sciences. His inquiry revolves around the connection between the factum or what is “made” – anything resulting from human skills (literature, art, law, institutions, etc.) – and the verum or God-begotten truth. What kind of epistemology and interpretive methodologies arise when we turn to Vico, Descartes’s scourge? In our own dissatisfaction with rational empiricism, Vico’s alternative unfolds as an epic exploration through time, guiding us to witness primitive humans uttering their first word, partake in Noah’s ark journey, and retrace the origins of writing and the foundation of civilizations.\n\nRocco Rubini\n\n2024-2025 Autumn\n\n22705/32700 Diasporic Literature and Modern Islam in the Imperial Core\n\n(AASR 36717, GLST 22710, ISLM 36717, RLST 26717, RDIN 22700, RDIN 32700)\n\nThe 19th century enslaved scholar Omar Ibn Said opens his autobiography with the words: “I cannot write my life.” This seminar takes this starting point –the thick of chattel slavery, mercantile capitalism, and colonial violence – to investigate literary productions by racialized others dispersed in and by the so-called era of modernity. We will complicate what constitutes the modernity and how Islam, perhaps more than any other tradition, has been configured as its inverse. In doing so, we will read works ranging from poetry, novels, short stories, comics, and memoirs as they relate to encounters and engagements particularly with Islam as a religious tradition, colonialism, industrialization, and nationalism, even as global understandings of tradition, genre, and form are being contested and rapidly changing. In addition to these primary sources, we will theoretically situate these works within larger discussions of racecraft, oral transmission and culture, “folk” vs. “high” literature, Orientalism, politics, gender, sexuality, and identity. We will look at this is articulated in diasporic literary forms written within – and sometimes for - the imperial core. Through in-class discussions, readings, and a final paper, students will strengthen their global literacy, demonstrate knowledge of global historical trends, analyze the shifting and even contradictory interpretations of the role of religion in racial formations, all while identifying, critiquing, and assessing these key course themes within our primary source material.\n\nSamah Choudhury\n\n2024-2025 Autumn\n\n33709 The New Socialist Realism\n\n(REES 33709)\n\nTaking the astonishing fiction of Andrei Platonov (1899-1951) as a starting point this course asks: how have realist fictions in general and socialist realism in particular been used to transform material and ideological realities? Can realism be revolutionary? Can it be dictated by the state? Grounded in historical context, our reading will venture into the afterlife and future of socialist realism. As philosophers across the world reinterpreted Platonov and other Soviet and socialist authors, what appeared to be gaps in intellectual and literary history now seem to be continuities of influence across borders. Reading Shklovsky, Lukács, Jameson, Timofeeva, Malabou and others, this course traces the new and transnational socialist realism. Topics include ideology, gender, community, colonialism and decolonization.\n\nAnia Aizman\n\n2024-2025 Autumn\n\n25550/35550 Machiavelli: Politics and Theater\n\n(ITAL 25550, ITAL 35550, FNDL 29305, TAPS 28481, TAPS 38481)\n\nArguably the most debated political theorist of all time due to The Prince, Machiavelli genuinely aspired to be remembered for his creative prowess. He explored various literary genres, such as short stories, dialogues, satirical poetry, letter writing, and, notably, theater, where he demonstrated mastery with The Mandrake, an exemplary Renaissance comedy. This course aims to reintegrate these two aspects of Machiavelli: the serious politician and the facetious performer, a Janus-faced figure who serves as a precursor of both Hobbes and Montaigne. We will revive the image of this “Renaissance man,” and, through him, shed light on his era and fellow humanists by restoring their intellectual unity of prescription and laughter. Indeed, we will discover that Machiavelli encourages us not to take things, including him and ourselves, too seriously! Taught in English.\n\nRocco Rubini\n\n2024-2025 Autumn\n\n25810/35810 Childhood and Fairy Tale in Bachelard, Benjamin, and Agamben\n\n(ITAL 25800, ITAL 35800)\n\n‘The child’ is a complex and fascinating notion that plays a crucial role in the writings of some of the major twentieth-century thinkers. The child is often linked to ‘fairy tale,’ as if one concept couldn’t exist without the other. What constitutes a fairy tale, what is the difference between fairy tale, myth, and allegory, and who is the real narrator and listener of fairy tales are questions that can only be addressed through a second, fundamental query: What is ‘the child’? What does ‘the child’ represent? What role does the imagination play in the formation of ‘the child’? These issues are especially significant in the writings of Gaston Bachelard, Walter Benjamin, and Giorgio Agamben.\n\nReadings will include: Bachelard, \"Poetics of Reverie: Childhood, Language, and the Cosmos\"; Bachelard, \"Air and Dreams. An Essay on the Imagination of Movement\"; Bachelard, \"The Flame of a Candle\"; Benjamin, One-Way Street; Benjamin, “The Fireside Saga”; Benjamin, \"Berlin Childhood around 1900\"; Benjamin “Goethe’s Elective Affinities,”; Benjamin, \"The Storyteller\"; Agamben, \"Infancy and History\"; Agamben, \"Profanations\"; Agamben, \"Pulcinella or Entertainment for Children\"; Agamben, \"Pinocchio\". We will also read an ample selection of classic fairy tales from Giambattista Basile (\"The Tale of Tales\"), the seventeenth-century French conteuses, The Brothers Grimm, Clemens Brentano, and Collodi’s \"Pinocchio.\" Taught in English.\n\nArmando Maggi\n\n2024-2025 Spring\n\n26680/36680 Literary Games: Oulipo and Onward\n\n(ENGL 26680, ENGL 36680, FREN 26680, FREN 36680)\n\nDoes constraint foster creativity? Can wordplay carry political meaning? Is formal innovation divorced from lyrical expression? How do experimental literary movements respond to their sociopolitical moments and local contexts, and how do they transform when they travel across geographical and linguistic borders? We will consider these questions via the work of the longest-lived French literary group, the Oulipo (Ouvroir de littérature potentielle or Workshop for Potential Literature), examining its origins as a quasi-secret society in 1960 and its expansion into an internationally visible and multilingual collective (with members from Italy, Spain, Argentina, and the US). We will investigate debates about inspiration and authorship, copying and plagiarism, collective creation, multilingualism, constraint and translation, and the viability of the lyric subject. While considering antecedents (Edgar Allan Poe, Raymond Roussel), our readings will explore several generations of Oulipians (Raymond Queneau, Georges Perec, Italo Calvino, Michèle Métail, Anne Garréta, Frédéric Forte), and conclude with some very contemporary Oulipo-inspired writing from around the world (Christian Bök, Urayoán Noel, Mónica de la Torre, K. Silem Mohammed). Alongside critical essays, students will carry out short experiments with constraint and procedure, as well as translation exercises; and they will have the opportunity for dialogue with acclaimed writers and scholars who will visit our seminar.\n\nRachel Galvin, Alison James\n\n2024-2025 Spring\n\n26702/36702 Arabic into Hebrew: Translation and Cultural Change during the Middle Ages\n\n(HREL 36702, HIJD 36702, ISLM 36702, JWSC 26702, MDVL 26702, NEHC 26702, NEHC 36702, RLST 26702, RLVC 36702)\n\nReligions, like all cultural phenomena, are akin to organic beings: they change, grow and adapt, absorb and assimilate what they encounter, become transformed constantly in relation to challenges and opportunities – and sometimes react against them. This course will focus on one example of religious-cultural-philosophical adaptation and change through a study of the medieval translation of Arabic and Judeo-Arabic works into Hebrew during the 12th-15th centuries. We will focus on the translations themselves and translation technique, but principally on what was translated and why, when and where, by whom and for whom. All this with an added emphasis on the result: how did Judaism and Jewish culture change through translation – in all its forms – during the high middle ages.\n\nJames T. Robinson\n\n2024-2025 Autumn\n\n38810 Empire, Slavery & Salvation: Writing Difference in the Colonial Americas\n\n(SPAN 38810, LACS 38810)\n\nThis course explores portrayals of human difference in literature, travel writing, painting, and autobiography from Spain, England, and the Americas. Students will become versed in debates surrounding the emergence of human distinctions based on religion, race, and ethnicity in the early modern era. Understanding these debates and the history surrounding them is crucial to participating in informed discussion, research, and activism regarding issues of race, empire, and colonialism across time and space.\n\nLarissa Brewer-García\n\n2024-2025 Spring\n\n28990/38990 La Princesse de Clèves and the Genesis of the Modern Novel\n\n(FREN 28900, FREN 38900, FNDL 29405)\n\nMadame de La Fayette’s 1678 novel represents a turning point in the international development of the psychological novel and historical fiction. Set in a Renaissance past of courtly international intrigue, the novel plumbs its characters’ interiorized struggles with erotic desire, marriage, and adultery, forging a path for later novelists such as Flaubert, George Eliot, and Tolstoy. We will examine debates about its literary form and moral impact, as well as around gender and women’s writing, placing the novel in a transnational context (Spanish, Italian, and English romances, drama, and moral philosophy) and its later reception, including film adaptations and its role in heated contemporary controversies around the place of the humanities in society. Students are encouraged to undertake individual comparative research projects in relation to the novel. Course taught in English but reading ability in French required.\n\nLarry Norman\n\n2024-2025 Winter\n\n45602 Zionism and Culture, 1881 to the Present\n\n(HIST 45602, NEHC 45602, CDIN 45602)\n\nThis course investigates the shifting relations between Hebrew/Israeli literature and culture and Zionism as a political project, ideology, myth, and power structure. We will investigate multiple forms of cultural articulation, from built environment, to popular culture, to culture as a set of practices that govern everyday life, while devoting special attention to poetry – an institution valorized by classical secularist Zionism yet one often seen as standing in tension with Zionism’s contemporary religious-nationalist forms. What role has Hebrew culture played within the Zionist project, as bearer, expression, reflection, or refraction of nationalist ideology or myth? What are the relationships between culture’s putative forms of autonomy and forms of dissent, resistance, or alternative political vision in Israel and Palestine? How might this connect to Mizrachi and other ‘minority’ identities, and the roles of Palestinians as cultural producers within Israeli frames? What is to be learned about secular nationalism, Jewish secularism, post-secularism, religiosity, and political theology particularly in an era of what seems to be the rising hegemony of expressly religious Zionism.\n\nNa'ama Rokem, Kenneth Moss\n\n2024-2025 Autumn\n\n46100 Beyond the Blanks of History: When Women of Color Reclaim the Narrative\n\n(FREN 46000, GNSE 46001, RDIN 46000)\n\n“History” is skewed and incomplete. It leaves out as much as it reveals. As they relegate past suffering to oblivion, historical omissions perpetuate the violence that they seek to hide. And this violence is often felt on multiple levels by women of color who find themselves imbricated within (neo)colonial, patriarchal, heteronormative, classist and ableist societal structures. In this course, we will situate ourselves at the intersection of literature, history and gender studies. We will explore the following questions together: Faced with the blind spots of history, how can literature function as an alternative archive that draws attention to the invisibilized stories of women of color? Simultaneously, how does literature sensitize us to the impossibility of fully knowing the past, no matter how hard we try? Course material may include theoretical texts, fiction, poetry, songs, podcasts, film, graphic novels and social media material. Potential examples include Saidiya Hartman’s “Venus in Two Acts” (2008), Gina Prince-Bythewood’s The Woman King (2022), Gaiutra Bahadur’s Coolie Woman: The Odyssey of Indenture (2013), Nathacha Appanah’s La Mémoire Délavée (2023), Lia Brozgal’s Absent the Archive: Cultural Traces of a Massacre in Paris, 17 October 1961 (2022), Marie Clements’ Bones of Crows (2022), and Natasha Kanapé Fontaine’s poetry.\n\nTaught in English. All course material will be available in English, though students are encouraged to engage with original materials. Work may be submitted in English, French or Spanish.\n\nNikhita Obeegadoo\n\n2024-2025 Spring\n\n26605/46605 Testimonial Montage: Interdisciplinary Approaches to Holocaust Testimony\n\n(GRMN 26605, GRMN 46605, HIJD 46605, JWSC 26605, RDIN 26605, RDIN 46605, RLST 26605, RLVC 466065)\n\nThe Fortunoff Archive at Yale, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Shoah Foundation, and Yad Vashem are just a few of the repositories of audiovisual Holocaust testimonies throughout the world. As these testimonies come to be all that remains of the generations of Holocaust survivors to tell their stories, how are researchers approaching them? In this class we will explore four distinct discourses and their approaches to testimony: Historical, Literary, Cinematic, and Photographic. Our final projects will be an analysis of a testimony from one of the above-named archives that incorporates all four perspectives.\n\nSheila Jelen\n\n2024-2025 Winter\n\n48647 Trauma and Narrative\n\n(ENGL 48647)\n\nThis graduate seminar invites students to engage with literary trauma studies, a field that first emerged in the 1990s, and that has more recently been undergoing decolonization processes. Following calls by scholars such as Stef Craps in Postcolonial Witnessing (2013), we will examine foundational and current literary theory by questioning its validity and applicability across different cultural contexts and languages. We will read select fictional trauma narratives, in English translation or in the original language when possible. Readings will include select psychological and psychoanalytical theoretical literature from Judith L. Herman and Cathy Caruth to Bessel van der Kolk; (literary) theory by Ruth Leys, Lauren Berlant and Stef Craps, as well as fictional texts, largely from non-Euro-Anglo-American contexts. Students working on trauma-related literary projects are welcome to contribute materials in their respective research languages. We will end the course by bridging discussions of literary trauma studies with recent debates around a pedagogy of trauma, especially as applicable the context of higher education. Students need to be available for 2 synchronous online meetings per week.\n\n2024-2025 Autumn\n\n50201 Pre-modern Critical Theory: Theory, Critique, and the Making of the Past\n\n(ENGL 50201, RLVC 50201)\n\nThis course introduces students to ancient, medieval, and early modern literary theory and to modern engagements with these theoretical interventions. We will explore how communities in the past imagined their practices of reading, writing, and interpretation—with especial emphasis on scriptural exegesis—but also what constituted a text, in the first place. How, indeed, were these practices foundational to the formation of communities and, in turn, to alterity? And what role do these literary theories and practices play in longer histories of \"theory\" and \"critique.\" Staging dialogues between the past and the present, this course will ask what the political implications of designating an archive as \"ancient,\" \"archaic,\" \"medieval,\" or \"premodern\" are in order to understand how and why the past is continually made and remade.\n\n2024-2025 Spring\n\n53400 Salvage Poetics: Literature as Ethnography\n\n(AASR 53400, ANTH 53401, HIJD 53400, REES 43400, RLVC 53400 )\n\nThis interdisciplinary course will synthesize ethnographic and literary discourses to consider the ways in which the culture of the Jewish “shtetl,” the small towns and villages in eastern Europe where Jewish culture thrived for nearly a millennium, has been represented in the United States after the Holocaust, from the 1940s to the present day. We will read a wide variety of materials within the field of anthropology as well as Jewish literatures and cultures to tease out the concept of “salvage poetics” or a literary poetics that has been forged in popular attempts to bridge dramatically different historical moments, different geographic locations, and different cultures across the abyss of the Holocaust.\n\nSheila Jelen\n\n2024-2025 Autumn\n\n26311 Worlding Otherwise: Speculative Fiction, Film, Theory\n\n(ENGL 26312, GNSE 26311)\n\nThis course examines literary and cinematic works of speculative fiction in a comparative context. An expansive genre that encompasses science fiction, fantasy, magic realism, horror, as well as utopian and dystopian literature, speculative fiction envisions alternate, parallel, possible, or imagined worlds. These worlds often exhibit characteristics such as: scientific and technological advancements; profound social, environmental, or political transformations; time or space travel; life on other planets; artificial intelligence; and evolved, hybrid, or new species. Speculative works frequently reimagine the past and present in order to offer radical visions of desirable or undesirable futures. We will also consider how this genre interrogates existential questions about what it means to be human, the nature of consciousness, the relationship between mind/body, thinking/being, and self/other, as well as planetary concerns confronting our species. Fictional works will be paired with theoretical readings that frame speculative and science fiction in relation to questions of gender, race, class, colonialism, bio-politics, human rights, as well as environmental and social justice. In addition to studying subgenres-such as Afrofuturism-we will explore speculative fiction as a critical mode of reading that theorizes other ways of being, knowing, and imagining.\n\n2023-2024 Autumn\n\n29887 Iterations of Oedipus: Folktale, Tragedy, Theory, Fiction\n\n(FNDL 29887, CLCV 2572)\n\nEngaging themes of agency and freedom, criminality and guilt, self-knowledge and identity, reason and truth, consciousness and the unseen, the story of Oedipus is among the most reworked and reimagined in world literature. This course explores a wide range of versions of the story across a variety of artistic forms. In the first half of the course, as well as reading both of Sophocles' plays about Oedipus, we will explore the traces of the story as folktale and legend both before and after Sophocles. The second half of the course will be devoted to modern adaptations of the story. These will include dramatic versions from mid-twentieth-century Egypt; the Italian film director Pier Paolo Pasolini's autobiographical Edipo Re (1967), inflected with Freudian and Marxist themes; Philip Roth's bestselling novel The Human Stain (2000); and the contemporary Chicano playwright Luis Alfaro's Oedipus El Rey (2017), set between a California state prison and South Central Los Angeles. Students will be introduced to theories of adaptation and reception, and will have a creative option for the final assignment.\n\n2023-2024 Autumn\n\n21090 Reading Transnational Early Modern Race through Gender\n\n(GLST 21090, GNSE 23166, RDIN 21090, SPAN 22090)\n\nIs race an anachronistic expression in Renaissance Europe? What are the stakes for studies of race in premodern periods? How did early modern race operate differently from contemporary racialized epistemologies and in what ways are we continuously influenced by the premodern times? This course tackles these questions by foregrounding two vocabularies in the early modern racial paradigm: gender and transnational constructions. We will read primary texts set and produced both in Renaissance Europe and its colonies in Africa, Americas, and Asia, and ask: how did the structural relationship of race and gender work in tandem with, or against each other? What roles did transnational and transcultural exchanges such as Christian missions, colonization, commerce, and slave trade play in the ideations of race? We will pay close attention to fictionalized female characters and women writers, ranging from the desired white beauties in Shakespeare’s Othello and Cervantes’s The Bagnios of Algiers, to Nahua (Mexico) and Visayan (the Philippines) women in The Florentine Codex and The Boxer Codex, to the spiritual diaries of indigenous and black nuns in the Colonial Spanish America, to Aphra Behn’s depiction of Oroonoko’s execution in Surinam, and finally to the unwritten disposable lives of enslaved black women in the Atlantic slave trade.\n\n2023-2024 Spring\n\n22210 Decolonization and Culture\n\n(CRES 22210)\n\nThis course introduces students to the various theories of militant or \"fighting\" cultures engendered by global struggles for decolonization throughout the twentieth century. Beginning with the global upswell of revolutionary movements at the end of World War I, intellectuals and artists from the colonial world began to enlist poetry, novels, art, music and other cultural forms in the struggle for decolonization. At the same that culture was instrumentalized for larger political struggles, meanwhile, \"culture\" itself was increasingly understood as a distinct site of struggle: The decolonization of culture was part and parcel of the decolonization of peoples. This course traces this evolving global discourse linking culture and decolonization across the twentieth century, exploring how writers and activists from the colonial world articulated a new cultural agenda within the context of broader programs of social transformation. Throughout we will contend with key questions and dilemmas faced by culture producers in the age of decolonization: What is the role of artists in a revolution? How does culture serve as a staging-ground larger political and ideological conflicts? What are the promises and pitfalls of treating decolonization as a metaphor? To answer these and other related questions, we will draw on case studies from the Harlem Renaissance, the Proletarian Literature movement, Haitian and Latin American Indigenist movements, Négritude, and Third Worldism.\n\nNoah Hansen\n\n2023-2024 Spring\n\n23325 Ukrainian Art, Literature and Film in the Wake of the Russian Invasion (2014-present)\n\n(REES 23325)\n\nHow does war affect art? Over the past decade, Ukrainian artists have been raising this question in their work, alongside questions about personal and collective identity, authority and authenticity, language and imperial violence, epistemic injustice and decolonization. In this course, we will examine art, literature, and film arising out of the war-triggered crises, whether political, aesthetic, ethical, or existential, focusing on the artists’ creative engagement with different kinds of documentary and source material, experiments with form, and intermodal and inter-genre dialogue. Readings may include work by Stanislav Aseyev, Yevgenia Belorusets, Andrey Kurkov, Olena Stiazhkina, Natalya Vorozhbit, and Serhiy Zhadan; as well as films, cartoons, and a range of audiovisual sources. Students can expect to engage with the newest cutting-edge work from Ukraine; to develop individual research projects in collaboration with their peers; and to write a final paper.\n\nMax Rosochinsky\n\n2023-2024 Spring\n\n23411 Ecological identities: Reading and writing ‘You’ in the Anthropocene\n\nAs our bodies acquire plastics and carcinogens, and as our minds become more entangled with images and digitized knowledge, what it means to be a human in nature will change—has changed. Climate change challenges us to realize how ecological processes and interspecies relations structure bodies, minds, collectives, and ‘corporate persons’ in real, material ways. Our senses of personhood and collective loyalties shift along with our material milieus. In this course, we will read and write these emergent ecological identities into view. We ask who, or what, are these (in)human agents and how can we locate a sense of self within such fluid boundaries? What role does narrative and metaphor—aesthetic forms, devices, mediums— play in locating the person and its ethical responsibilities? How can we make visible communities of bodies bonded through shared nonhuman bodies of water, air, toxic accumulation, conglomerates, and technologies. We will engage with questions of gender, race, class, regional, and planetary affiliations, to reorient our inherited, traditional borders and boundaries of identity, and broach the question of what it might mean to be a human—to be ‘You’—in the Anthropocene. Our readings and writings must likewise cross traditional boundaries of genre, discipline, time-period, and place: environmental history, film, critical theory, speculative fiction, multimedia pieces, visual art, geography, juridical theory, theoretical biology, essays, and poetry.\n\n2023-2024 Spring\n\n24223 Parrhesia: Fearless Speech from Socrates to Greta von Thunberg\n\n(RLST 24223, CMLT 34223, GRMN 34223, GRMN 24223, PARR 24223, RLVC 34223)\n\nThe course will examine the long history of parrhesia, the Greek term for free and fearless speech, from ancient Athens to its current renaissance through the rediscovery by Michel Foucault. Focusing on the relation of truth and discourse, the course will consider not only the extraction of truth as a form of subjection to disciplinary power but also acts of telling truth to power as a practice of self- formation and exercise of freedom. Parrhesia implies a relation between the human self and the act of truth-telling that is suffused with interesting political, philosophical, and ethical possibilities, which students will be encouraged to explore. The course will begin by reviewing Foucault's final lectures on parrhesia and \"the courage of truth.\" It will then examine some of the ancient Greek and Christian texts that Foucault analyzed. It will go on to consider early modern instances of parrhesia (e.g. Galileo and Descartes) and will conclude by surveying relatively recent versions (e.g. Greta von Thunberg and James Comey, JD'85), including contemporary feminist and queer practices of parrhesia. Lectures and discussions in English. No prerequisites.\n\nChristopher Wild\n\n2023-2024 Spring\n\n25105 In the Beginning\": Origin, Style, and Transformation in the King James Version Matrix\n\nThe 400th anniversary of the King James Bible (KJV) set off a series of events and texts dedicated to the great influence of this literary classic-a vernacular English Bible from 1611. What is it about the KJV that has so obsessed readers and writers? How has it become part of and affected world literature? Are there competing ways of conceiving the biblical text in English literature? In this course, we will trace some of the KJV's thematic and stylistic influences in global Anglophone literature; sometimes we will deal with direct allusion and rewriting, and other times we will study the possibilities of more tenuous links. In parallel to this work, we will problematize the KJV's astounding centrality by: examining some pre-KJV literature and alternative early- modern and 20th century translations (particularly as these intersect with Jewish tradition); attending to subversive and postcolonial literary uses of the translation; and close-reading the political and ideological motivations behind certain forms of critical adulation. Texts examined may include works by authors such as George Peele, William Shakespeare, Herman Melville, William Faulkner, Toni Morrison, Cynthia Ozick, Zora Neale Hurston, Chinua Achebe and Wole Soyinka.\n\nChloe Blackshear\n\n2023-2024 Spring\n\n26269 Religious Authority in Comparative Perspective\n\n(DVPR 36269, RLST 26269)\n\nWhen somebody tells us about the nature of God or the gods, about what such beings want from us, about our experiences before this life or our destinies after it-why should we believe them? With equal and opposite force, why shouldn't we believe them? Are the standards of acceptable belief entirely independent of what we're told by religious authorities, or is it impossible to arrive at any such standards without presuming something we've been told? When confronted with diverse claims about the divine, should we try to ascertain which ones are true, should we combine or harmonize them in some way, or should we dismiss the entire conversation as wrongheaded? In this course, we'll think through these questions with the help of influential texts drawn from the Buddhist, Hindu, Platonic, and classical Chinese traditions.\n\nStephen C. Walker\n\n2023-2024 Spring\n\n28013 Love, Desire, and Sexuality in Islamic Texts and Contexts\n\n(RLST 28013, GNSE 23135, NEHC 29018, MDVL 28013, SALC 28013 )\n\nWhat separates love from lust? How do our erotic desires and sexual practices intersect with our beliefs? This interdisciplinary class explores these questions in conversation with foundational thinkers from the Islamic tradition alongside insights from feminist and queer theory. We will delve into questions on the relationship between romantic, familial, and divine love; gender, sexuality, and the body; and Orientalism and the politics of reading desire cross-culturally. Exploring a diverse set of primary sources that range from the Qur'ān to Rūmī's Masnāvī to contemporary Bollywood, we will encounter different representations of love, desire, and sexuality in religious and philosophical discourses, literary representations, and visual media. We will examine not only how these representations reflect different historical norms, but also how and to what extent texts and images can inform or impact the norms of their contexts as well. No prerequisite knowledge of the topics or time periods discussed is needed, and students will have the opportunity over the course of the class to develop a project that relates our content to their own interests.\n\nAllison Kanner-Botan\n\n2023-2024 Spring\n\n28280 The Good Place and the Bad Place: Judgement, Punishment, and Living a Good Life\n\n(FNDL 28280, RLST 28280 )\n\nDo you believe that you are a good person and, if so, why are you good? This course will investigate the connections between personal intentions to be a \"good person\" and the fear of punishment. What do we owe each other as ethical actors? Do the intentions of our actions matter or only the results of our actions? How can one be good in an increasingly complicated web of intersecting needs, social developments, and understandings of morality? This course will examine conceptions of hell, eternal punishment, and justice in a variety of religious traditions. In addition to reading authors such as Dante and John Milton, students will critically engage The Good Place, a sitcom which tackles deep questions of faith, morality, and the complexity of the human person. We will think through competing understandings of justice (retributive, distributive, and restorative) alongside our individual beliefs surrounding fairness and deservingness. No prior knowledge of religious studies or ethics is expected.\n\nFoster Pinkney\n\n2023-2024 Spring\n\n28506 Jesus: From Scripture to the Silver Screen\n\n(RLST 28506)\n\nJesus holds particular significance for believers all around the world. But how is he portrayed in modern films? How faithful are these depictions to the Bible? Do these portrayals push a certain kind of theological position? In this course, we will examine film adaptations of Jesus, including biopics, dramas, comedies, and musicals. As we watch everything from Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) to Monty Python's Life of Brian (1979), we will compare these modern depictions to ancient texts and theology. During the course, students will become familiar with significant aspects of Jesus's life both in canonical and noncanonical Gospels, as well as to how those texts have been understood in the antiquity and today. After the class, students will be able to analyze critically portrayals of Jesus in order to understand why certain decisions are made and address pivotal questions about biblical interpretation, cinema and adaptation, and the ethical challenges of representing religious figures in media. No prior familiarity with biblical studies or film criticism is required.\n\nRichard Zaleski\n\n2023-2024 Spring\n\n28872 Lion Feuchtwanger’s The Oppenheimers in historical context: Jews, Nazis and exile\n\n(GRMN 28872, ENGL 28872, JWSC 28872, FNDL 28872)\n\nRecently republished in 2022, Lion Feuchtwanger’s 1933 best-seller The Oppermanns depicts a Jewish family who grapple with the Nazi seizure of power in Germany. Like many at the time, the Oppemanns think that the regime will be short-lived, but Feuchtwanger’s prescient novel anticipates the entrenchment of Nazi power and the creeping curtailment of Jewish life in Germany with uncanny accuracy—from the thugs attacking individuals to the Ministry of Propaganda’s demonization of Jewish Germans in mass media, via the enforced “Aryanization” of businesses required to employ non-Jewish managers. Discussion will focus on Feuchtwanger’s nuanced portrayal of the distinct ways in which family members react to these assaults, supplemented by historical texts, including the analysis of Nazi language (1946) by Victor Klemperer, a Jewish-German survivor, and documents in the Weimar Republic Sourcebook\n\n2023-2024 Spring\n\n29026 Loyalties, Friendships, Loves\n\n(REES 29026)\n\nAngelina Ilieva\n\n2023-2024 Spring\n\n29590 Poetics of Science\n\n(GLST 21090, GNSE 23166, RDIN 21090, SPAN 22090)\n\nIn 1959, C. P. Snow expressed his anxiety over the widening “gulf” between the literary and the scientific cultures of his time, attributing such a phenomenon to the pressure of industrialization and the application of advanced, systematic techniques to industry. Yet while science and literature started to submit themselves to growingly different logic, epistemology, and modes of production in the twentieth century, they became inextricably linked at the same time: contemporary scientific discoveries served as a major source of literary inspiration; scientists explored the possibilities of approaching their projects through literary strategies. In this course, we will read theories and practices by major poets, literary critics, and scientists during the twentieth century. Through analyzing how the tension described by Snow is rendered, problematized, and transformed, especially through the medium of poetry, we will study how poetry and science provide each other with new vocabularies, forms, and critical angles to address modern experience. While we will concentrate on endeavors by anglophone poets and scientists, we will also bring a few international cases (in translation) into discussion to establish a comparative perspective. Possible scientists include Henri Poincaré, Alfred North Whitehead, and Brian Rotman; possible poets and critics include I. A. Richards, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, Hart Crane, Laura Riding, Wallace Stevens, Muriel Rukeyser, and Lyn Hejinia\n\n2023-2024 Spring\n\n20109 Comparative Literature – Theory and Practice\n\n(ENGL 28918)\n\nThe course will consider translation—both theory and practice—in relation to queer studies, transgender studies, disability studies, and gender and women's studies. We will consider the intersections of translation with religion, postcolonialism, decolonialism, and feminist thought. Authors studied will include Monique Balbuena, Roque Raquel Salas Rivera, Kate Briggs, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, and others. There will be workshops with guest translators. Students may undertake a final research paper or translation project. A minimum of reading knowledge with at least one non-English language is required.\n\n2023-2024 Winter\n\n20124 The Bible Throughout History: From the Dead Sea Scrolls to King James\n\n(MDVL 20124, HIST 29908, RLST 20124, FNDL 20124, JWSC 20924)\n\nWhile the collection of ancient texts found in modern Bibles appears fixed and is read by many people as a source of edification or theological insight, it has not always been this way. Though absent from most Bibles, there is an entire body of literature commonly known as \"rewritten bible\": early translations, retellings, or entirely new stories with familiar names and faces that update, retcon, or subvert their \"biblical\" sources. How might we understand these ancient forms of fan fiction? The class will introduce this corpus (including some of the Dead Sea Scrolls) and its sources, production, and historical contexts. We will confront significant problems in understanding religious texts: how is it that some texts become authoritative while other very similar texts do not? Who gets to retell foundational religious narratives, and within what social or political constraints? What does it mean to relate to sacred texts as artistic prompts or imperfect points of departure? Can a biblical text be rewritten for an entirely different religious tradition? We will consider similar questions for contemporary religious practice, asking: how did rewriting the Bible get started, and has it stopped?\n\nDoren Snoek\n\n2023-2024 Winter\n\n23324 The Human Form in Contemporary Art\n\n(ARTH 23324, MUSI 23324, GRMN 23324)\n\nIn a present where humanity faces planetary challenges with an unprecedented urgency, the human form – what Marx calls our \"genus-being\" (Gattungswesen) – has become a focus for artistic production of all sorts. The thesis of the class is this: Contemporary art is an actualization of the human form that doesn't presuppose the form, doesn't take it for granted, but instead troubles the form and poses it as a question. The class considers presentations of the form in performance art (Tino Sehgal, Anne Imhof, Wu Tsang), sculpture (Kara Walker, Cai Guo-Qiang, Cecilia Vicuña), writing (Friederike Mayröcker, Layli Long Soldier, Tracie Morris), sound (Maria Chavez, Christina Kubisch, Samson Young), and painting (Michael Armitage, Tammy Nguyen, Mark Bradford). The class contextualizes these artists with theoretical work by Sylvia Wynter, Donna Haraway, Bruno Latour, Peter Sloterdijk, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Jane Bennett, Achille Mbembe, Eva Horn, and Emanuele Coccia. Readings and discussion in English.\n\nFlorian Klinger\n\n2023-2024 Winter\n\n24510 Kawaii (cuteness) culture in Japan and the world\n\n(ENGL 24510, GNSE 24511 )\n\nThe Japanese word kawaii (commonly translated as \"cute\" or \"adorable\") has long been a part of Japanese culture, but, originating from schoolgirl subculture of the 1970s, today's conception of kawaiihas become ubiquitous as a cultural keyword of contemporary Japanese life. We now find kawaii in clothing, food, toys, engineering, films, music, personal appearance, behavior and mannerisms, and even in government. With the popularity of Japanese entertainment, fashion and other consumer products abroad, kawaii has also become a global cultural idiom in a process Christine Yano has called \"Pink Globalization\". With the key figures of Hello Kitty and Rilakkuma as our guides, this course explores the many dimensions of kawaii culture, in Japan and globally, from beauty and aesthetics, affect and psychological dimensions, consumerism and marketing, gender, sexuality and queerness, to racism, orientalism and robot design.\n\n2023-2024 Winter\n\n28405 Religion in Anime and Japanese Pop Culture\n\n(RLST 28405, MAAD 14805, EALC 28405 )\n\nHow does Spirited Away reflect teachings of Japanese Buddhism and Shinto? Or what about Neon Genesis Evangelion? What can pop culture tell us about religion? In this course, we will consider what Japanese religions are (and are not) by looking at their representations in popular cultural forms of past and present. Sources are drawn from a range of popular cultural forms including anime and manga, but also literature, artistic performances, visual arts, and live-action movies. The course covers foundational aspects of Japanese religious life through non-traditional sources like Bleach, The Tale of Genji, and Your Name. At the end of the course, students will be able to speak to the great diversity of religious practices and viewpoints in Japan, not only its centers but also its peripheries and minorities. Meanwhile, we will consider broader questions about the complex connections between religion and popular culture. No prior knowledge of Buddhism, Shinto, or Japanese history is expected.\n\nMarshall Cunningham\n\n2023-2024 Winter\n\n28870 Infinite Narrative: The Arabian Nights and its Global Refractions\n\n(NEHC 28871, FNDL 20221)\n\nThe Arabian Nights, or A Thousand and One Nights, has had a profound influence on global culture. A shaping force in the formation of European Orientalism and Romanticism in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the work has since inspired a vast array of writers, filmmakers, and artists across the world. We will begin this course by studying the Nights as a product of the medieval Arabo-Islamic world, examining the major themes and formal features of the work. We will then investigate the translation and reception of the Nights in early modern Europe, before analyzing a selection of short stories, films, and novels based on or inspired by the Nights spanning the nineteenth to the twenty-first century. These will include stories by Edgar Allen Poe and Jorge Luis Borges; films by Masaki Kobayashi and Pier Paolo Pasolini; and novels by one or more of Naguib Mahfouz, Radwa Ashour, Salman Rushdie, and Isabel Allende. The primary texts will be supplemented with readings concerning narratology and the art of storytelling, the fantastic and magic realism, and contemporary debates about world literature. All texts will be read in translation, but students with knowledge of Arabic will be encouraged to participate in additional sessions devoted to reading parts of the Arabic texts in the original.\n\n2023-2024 Winter\n\n22400/32400 History of International Cinema I: Silent Era\n\n(MAAD 18500, CMST 28500, ENGL 29300, CMST 48500, ENGL 48700, ARTV 20002, ARTH 38500, ARTH 28500, MAPH 33600)\n\nThis course provides a survey of the history of cinema from its emergence in the mid-1890s to the transition to sound in the late 1920s. We will examine the cinema as a set of aesthetic, social, technological, national, cultural, and industrial practices as they were exercised and developed during this 30-year span. Especially important for our examination will be the exchange of film techniques, practices, and cultures in an international context. We will also pursue questions related to the historiography of the cinema, and examine early attempts to theorize and account for the cinema as an artistic and social phenomenon.\n\nAllyson Nadia Field\n\n2023-2024 Autumn\n\n22500/32500 History of International Cinema II: Sound Era to 1960\n\n(ARTV 20003, CMST 48600, CMST 28600, ARTH 28600, MAAD 18600, REES 25005, MAPH 33700, ARTH 38600, ENGL 48900, REES 45005, ENGL 29600)\n\nThe center of this course is film style, from the classical scene breakdown to the introduction of deep focus, stylistic experimentation, and technical innovation (sound, wide screen, location shooting). The development of a film culture is also discussed. Texts include Thompson and Bordwell's Film History: An Introduction; and works by Bazin, Belton, Sitney, and Godard. Screenings include films by Hitchcock, Welles, Rossellini, Bresson, Ozu, Antonioni, and Renoir.\n\nJames Lastra\n\n2023-2024 Winter\n\n22668/32668 Suffering and Justice\n\n(HMRT 22668)\n\nWhat is suffering, and what is its relationship to justice? This course explores the construction and circulation of understandings of suffering and justice through literary and aesthetic representations, the law, non-governmental organizations, and intellectual discourses. We will consider how local and transnational contexts shape understandings of suffering and the various attempts to respond to it (through, for instance, human rights advocacy, revolutionary politics, humanitarianism, and bearing witness). Readings will include works by Rigoberta Menchú, Antjie Krog, Chinua Achebe, J.M. Coetzee, Ariel Dorfman, Hannah Arendt, Jean-Paul Sartre, Martha Nussbaum, Elaine Scarry, Didier Fassin, and Paul Farmer.\n\n2023-2024 Winter\n\n23401/33401 The Burden of History: A Nation and Its Lost Paradise\n\n(HIST 24005, NEHC 20573, REES 39013, HIST 34005, REES 29013, NEHC 30573)\n\nWhat makes it possible for the imagined communities called nations to command the emotional attachments that they do? This course considers some possible answers to Benedict Anderson's question on the basis of material from the Balkans. We will examine the transformation of the scenario of paradise, loss, and redemption into a template for a national identity narrative through which South East European nations retell their Ottoman past. With the help of Žižek's theory of the subject as constituted by trauma and Kant's notion of the sublime, we will contemplate the national fixation on the trauma of loss and the dynamic between victimhood and sublimity.\n\nAngelina Ilieva\n\n2023-2024 Autumn\n\n24723/34723 Philosophical Anthropology: Origins of the Human\n\n(GRMN 34723, GRMN 24723 )\n\nWhat makes us human? What is our place in the cosmos? What common condition unites us as a species across race, gender, and ethnicity? In this course, we will explore these questions through the lens of twentieth-century German thinkers who placed the human being at the center of philosophical inquiry. Seeking an alternative to both religious and scientific accounts, the philosophers Max Scheler, Arnold Gehlen, and Helmut Plessner developed new conceptions of the human that sought to do justice to both our spiritual and our biological being. We will take an historical approach to this intellectual movement, considering how philosophers such as Herder, Kant, and Nietzsche laid the groundwork for a reevaluation of who we are. In the conviction that literature also plays a vital role in formulating a philosophical anthropology, we will also consider several poets, in particular Friedrich Hölderlin and Rainer Maria Rilke. All texts will be read in English translation.\n\nSimon Friedland\n\n2023-2024 Spring\n\n25424/35424 Spiritual Exercises: Giving Form to Thought and Life from Plato to Descartes\n\n(GRMN 25424, GRMN 35424)\n\nThis course will examine the tradition of spiritual exercises from antiquity to the early modern period. Spiritual exercises were at the core of classical paideia, the regimen of self-formation designed and promoted by ancient philosophers, orators, and other pedagogues. As Pierre Hadot and Michel Foucault have demonstrated, ancient philosophy first and foremost has to be understood as a “way of life,” as a set of techniques and practices for shaping the self according to wisdom. It was not until philosophy’s critical turn with Kant that it shed its practical dimension and became a “theoretical” discipline. Early Christianity, stylizing itself as the “true philosophy,” eagerly adopted the ancient spiritual exercises and retooled them for its salvational ends. Throughout the middle ages and early modern period spiritual exercises and meditative techniques informed a host of religious, cultural, and artistic practices and media such as prayer and devotional reading, religious art and poetry, but also theatrical performances and musical works. We will focus on individual exercises like the meditation, the examination of conscience, the discernment of spirits, the application of senses, prosoche (attention), consolation, contemplation, etc., and discuss authors such as Epictetus, Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, John Cassian, Augustine, Bonaventure, Ignatius, Descartes, and others.\n\nChristopher Wild\n\n2023-2024 Spring\n\n35993 The Sublime\n\n(SCTH 35993, CLCV 25521)\n\nThe sublime has traditionally been thought to have had a merely marginal place in ancient Greek and Latin aesthetics and literary theory; but some scholars have recently argued that it was instead more central, and it is difficult not to apply this category to many ancient literary works. However the explicit category of the sublime did not become central to European aesthetics until the 17th century and then continued until the 19th century to play a central role in discussions not only of art and literature, but also of religion, politics, and other fields. By the middle of the 19th century the wave of interest in the sublime seems to have subsided, but in the past forty years this concept has returned to play an important role in aesthetic theories. The seminar will consider the odd history of the sublime, examining central texts from ancient (Longinus), early modern (Boileau), and modern aesthetics (certainly Burke, Kant, Schiller, and Hegel; perhaps also, depending on students' interest and preparation, Tieck, Schlegel, Schelling, Solger, and Jean Paul) as well as some more recent discussions (again depending on student preferences, Nietzsche, Lyotard, Adorno, Zizek). It will also ask whether the concept of the sublime can still play an important role today, or, if not, then what has taken its place. We will deal primarily with theories of the sublime but also to some extent with works of art. Open to undergraduates with consent.\n\nGlenn Most\n\n2023-2024 Spring\n\n25999/35999 Realism: Art or Metaphysics?\n\n(ARTH 39609, ARTH 29609, KNOW 25010, SCTH 35010, KNOW 35010, SCTH 25010)\n\nBesides its historical role as the first capital-letter avant-garde in painting and literature, Realism is making a return in many current artistic and, for that matter, cultural and journalistic contexts. But whether one examines its entanglement with reputed adversaries like Romanticism and Idealism, its origins in ancient and medieval metaphysics, or its strange side career as a label for amoral pragmatism in political theory and practice, the many-sidedness of realism makes pinning it down quite a challenge. Is there any common thread binding Plato and Courbet, Virginia Woolf and García Marquez, Catherine Opie and Ai Weiwei? Can there be a realism of dreams and desire, such as one might find in Freud? And is realism a revolutionary venture, or a consolidating surveillance of social types? What role do new technologies and forms of spectatorship, from oil painting to photography, the printed book to streaming media, play in its rise and evolution? Readings in art history, fiction, and philosophy will alternate with film screenings and gallery visits.\n\nApoorv Gupta\n\n2023-2024 Autumn\n\n26551/36551 The Hidden Word: Gender, Class and Trauma in Post-War Germany\n\n(CMLT 36551, GRMN 26551, GRMN 36551)\n\nThis seminar will introduce issues of gender, class, post-war trauma and the so-called Wirtschaftswunder (“economic rise”) in West Germany during the decades following World War II. To approach these, we will read the novel Das verborgene Wort (The Hidden Word) by poet and novelist Ulla Hahn (b. 1945) who ranks among Germany’s best-known living writers. Despite the acclaim it has received, Hahn’s work remains largely untranslated and thus little known outside the German-speaking world. In this course, we will read her first autobiographical novel slowly and carefully in German, paying particular attention to the nuances of Hahn’s poetic prose style. Since the novel contains sentences in the Rhineland dialect (Rheinländisch/Kölsch), the instructor will provide explanations and a brief introduction to the regional culture.\n\n2023-2024 Spring\n\n26912/36912 Strangers to Ourselves: Emigre Literature and Film from Russia and Southeast Europe\n\n(REES 39010, REES 29010)\n\nBeing alienated from myself, as painful as that may be, provides me with that exquisite distance within which perverse pleasure begins, as well as the possibility of my imagining and thinking,\" writes Julia Kristeva in \"Strangers to Ourselves,\" the book from which this course takes its title. The authors whose works we are going to examine often alternate between nostalgia and the exhilaration of being set free into the breathless possibilities of new lives. Leaving home does not simply mean movement in space. Separated from the sensory boundaries that defined their old selves, immigrants inhabit a warped, fragmentary, disjointed time. Immigrant writers struggle for breath-speech, language, voice, the very stuff of their craft resounds somewhere else. Join us as we explore the pain, the struggle, the failure, and the triumph of emigration and exile. Vladimir Nabokov, Joseph Brodsky, Marina Tsvetaeva, Nina Berberova, Julia Kristeva, Alexander Hemon, Dubravka Ugrešić, Norman Manea, Miroslav Penkov, Ilija Trojanow, Tea Obreht.\n\nAngelina Ilieva\n\n2023-2024 Autumn\n\n27512/37512 Dream of the Red Chamber: Forgetting About the Author\n\n(EALC 27512, FNDL 27512, EALC 37512, SCTH 37512)\n\nThe great Chinese-Manchu novel _Honglou meng_ (ca. 1750) has been assigned one major author, Cao Xueqin, whose life has been the subject of much investigation. But before 1922 little was known about Cao, and interpreters of the novel were forced to make headway solely on the basis of textual clues. The so-called \"Three Commentators\" edition (_Sanjia ping Shitou ji_) shows these readers at their creative, polemical, and far-fetched best. We will be reading the first 80 chapters of the novel and discussing its reception in the first 130 years of its published existence (1792-1922), with special attention to hermeneutical strategies and claims of authorial purpose.\n\nHaun Saussy\n\n2023-2024 Autumn\n\n37652 Broken Mirrors: Writing the Other from Herodotus to the Jewish/Christian\n\n(HIJD 37652, CLCV 21922, JWSC 26603, HREL 37652, RLST 27652 )\n\nHow are Others represented in Greco-Roman, Jewish, and Christian canons? Is the Other purely a mirror of the self who represents it? Or do self and Other interact? Can we trace and compare patterns of representation and taxonomies for human difference across cultures, genres, regions, periods, and sciences? How can we develop new critical frameworks and concepts for this task, if we refuse to take for granted the categories and conventions of today's academic disciplines? What might this new approach to the Other help us to learn, or unlearn, about the making of \"the West\"? In order to answer those questions, our course will survey the most influential literary models of the Other, from Herodotus to the early medieval \"Life of Jesus\" polemic tradition. Beyond developing a new framework for exploring and connecting these diverse sources, it has three historical aims. First, to interrogate the limits of modern anthropology as the institutionalized site for writing and knowing the Other. Second, to reveal the centrality of the figure of the Jew in the prehistory of anthropology, where it plays a neglected but crucial role in the European history of human difference in general. Finally, to expose the premodern roots of \"scientific\" categories-\"primitive,\" \"civilized,\" \"Oriental,\" \"Aryan,\" \"Semite,\" etc.-where racial, linguistic, religious, and cultural differences still intersect today.\n\nJames Adam Redfield\n\n2023-2024 Spring\n\n28871/38871 Horror, Abjection and the Monstrous Feminine\n\n(GNSE 20137, GNSE 30137)\n\nThis course explores cinematic and literary works of horror (the uncanny, gothic, sci-fi, paranormal, psychological thriller, killer/slasher, gore) from around the world. As a mode of speculative fiction, the genre envisions possible or imagined worlds that amplify curiosities, dreads, fears, terrors, phobias, and paranoias which simultaneously repel and attract. Horror frequently explores the boundaries of what it means to be human by dwelling on imaginaries of the non-human and other. It often exploits the markers of difference that preoccupy our psychic, libidinal, and social lifeworlds—such as race, class, gender, and sexuality, but also the fundamental otherness that is other peoples’ minds and bodies. Interrogating the genre’s tension between desire and fear, our course will focus on the centrality of abjection and the monstrous feminine—as both thematic and aesthetic tropes—to works of horror. Films and fiction will be paired with theoretical readings that contextualize the genre of horror while considering its critical implications in relation to biopolitical and geopolitical forms of power.\n\nContent Warning: Course materials will feature graphic, violent, and oftentimes disturbing images and subjects. Enrolled students will be expected to watch, read, and discuss all course materials.\n\n2023-2024 Winter\n\n29023/39023 Returning the Gaze: The West and the Rest\n\n(HIST 23609, REES 29023, REES 39023, NEHC 39023, HIST 33609, NEHC 29023 )\n\nAware of being observed. And judged. Inferior... Abject... Angry... Proud... This course provides insight into identity dynamics between the \"West,\" as the center of economic power and self-proclaimed normative humanity, and the \"Rest,\" as the poor, backward, volatile periphery. We investigate the relationship between South East European self-representations and the imagined Western gaze. Inherent in the act of looking at oneself through the eyes of another is the privileging of that other's standard. We will contemplate the responses to this existential position of identifying symbolically with a normative site outside of oneself-self- consciousness, defiance, arrogance, self-exoticization-and consider how these responses have been incorporated in the texture of the national, gender, and social identities in the region. Orhan Pamuk, Ivo Andrić, Nikos Kazantzakis, Aleko Konstantinov, Emir Kusturica, Milcho Manchevski.\n\nAngelina Ilieva\n\n2023-2024 Winter\n\n22410/42410 Proust: The first volume\n\n(DVPR 42410, FREN 22410, FREN 32410, RLST 28410)\n\nThis course will undertake in-depth readings of the first volume of Proust’s In Search of Lost Time. While we will use a translation, any student who can read the French is strongly encouraged to do so (alongside the English, to facilitate class discussion). By doing close readings, we will explore the famous Proustian world, its textual and cultural complexities, the literary style it inaugurates, as well as the belle époque it depicts. The course will thus consider social, literary, historical, and critical approaches to this seminal text.\n\n2023-2024 Winter\n\n42503 Renaissance Humanism\n\n(HIST 42503, ITAL 42503)\n\nHumanism in the Renaissance was an ambitious project to repair what idealists saw as a fallen, broken world by reviving the lost arts of antiquity. Their systematic transformation of literature, education, art, religion, architecture, and science dramatically reshaped European culture, mixing ancient and medieval and producing the foundations of modern thought and society. Readings focus on primary sources: Petrarch, Poggio, Ficino, Pico, Castiglione, and Machiavelli, with a historiographical review of major modern treatments of the topic. We will discuss the history of the book, cultural and intellectual history, and academic writing skills especially planning the dissertation as a book and writing and submitting articles to journals.\n\nA. Palmer\n\n2023-2024 Spring\n\n22900/42900 Cinema in Africa\n\n(CMST 24201, CMST 34201, ENGL 27600, ENGL 47600, GNSE 28602, GNSE 48602, RDIN 27600, RDIN 37600)\n\nThis course examines Africa in film as well as films produced in Africa. It places cinema in Sub Saharan Africa in its social, cultural, and aesthetic contexts ranging from neocolonial to postcolonial, Western to Southern Africa, documentary to fiction, art cinema to TV, and includes films that reflect on the impact of global trends in Africa and local responses, as well as changing racial and gender identifications. We will begin with La Noire de... (1966), by the “father” of African cinema, Ousmane Sembene, contrasted w/ a South African film, African Jim (1960) that more closely resembles African American musical film, and anti-colonial and anti-apartheid films from Lionel Rogosin’s Come Back Africa (1959) to Sarah Maldoror’s Sambizanga, Sembene’s Camp de Thiaroye (1984), and Jean Marie Teno’s Afrique, Je te Plumerai (1995). The rest of the course will examine 20th and 21st century films such as I am a not a Witch and The wound (both 2017), which show tensions between urban and rural, traditional and modern life, and the implications of these tensions for women and men, Western and Southern Africa, in fiction, documentary and fiction film. (20th/21st).\n\n2023-2024 Spring\n\n43121 Translation Theory and Practice\n\n(CRWR 43121, CRWR 51503, ENGL 43121)\n\nThis course introduces students to the field of Translation Studies and its key concepts, including fidelity, equivalence, and untranslatability, as well as the ethics and politics of translation. We will investigate the metaphors and models that have been used to think about translation and will consider translation as a transnational practice, exploring how “world histories” may be hidden within “word histories,” as Emily Apter puts it. In the process, we will assess theories of translation and poetry from classical antiquity to the present; compare multiple translations of the same text; and examine notable recent translations. Students will carry out translation exercises and create a final translation project of their own.\n\n2023-2024 Winter\n\n46150 Heidegger and the Poets\n\n(GRMN 46150, THEO 46150, DVPR 46150 )\n\nAn investigation of the role(s) that poetry plays in Martin Heidegger's thinking. We will begin by focusing our attention on Heidegger's reading of the German poet Friedrich Hölderlin. We will then consider his interpretations of figures such as Rainer Maria Rilke, Stefan Georg, and Georg Trakl. We shall conclude by examining poetic responses to Heideggerian thought by figures such as René Char and Paul Celan, among others.\n\nRyan Coyne and Eric Santner\n\n2023-2024 Spring\n\n48647 Trauma and Narrative\n\n(ENGL 48647)\n\nThis graduate seminar invites students to engage with literary trauma studies, a field that first emerged in the 1990s, and that has more recently been undergoing decolonization processes. Following calls by scholars such as Stef Craps in Postcolonial Witnessing (2013), we will examine foundational and current literary theory by questioning its validity and applicability across different cultural contexts and languages. We will read select fictional trauma narratives, in English translation or in the original language when possible. Readings will include select psychological and psychoanalytical theoretical literature from Judith L. Herman and Cathy Caruth to Bessel van der Kolk; (literary) theory by Ruth Leys, Lauren Berlant and Stef Craps, as well as fictional texts, largely from non-Euro-Anglo-American contexts. Students working on trauma-related literary projects are welcome to contribute materials in their respective research languages. We will end the course by bridging discussions of literary trauma studies with recent debates around a pedagogy of trauma, especially as applicable the context of higher education. Students need to be available for 2 synchronous online meetings per week.\n\n2023-2024 Autumn\n\n29003/49003 Islam Beyond the Human: Spirits, Demons, Devils, and Ghosts\n\n(GNSE 29003, AASR 49003, ANTH 49003, RLST 29003, KNOW 49003, GNSE 49003, NEHC 29003, ANTH 29003, ISLM 49003, NEHC 49003)\n\nThis seminar explores the diverse spiritual and sentient lifeforms within Islamic cosmology that exist beyond the human-from jinn, angels, and ghosts to demons and devils. We will focus on theological, scientific, philosophical, anthropological, and historical accounts of these creatures across a variety of texts, as well as their literary and filmic afterlives in contemporary cultural representations. In so doing, we consider the various religious, social, and cultural inflections that shape local cosmological imaginaries. We ask how reflecting on the nonhuman world puts the human itself in question, including such concerns as sexuality and sexual difference, the boundaries of the body, reason and madness, as well as the limits of knowledge.\n\nHoda El Shakry, Alireza Mohammadi Doostdar\n\n2023-2024 Autumn\n\n50101 The Problem with Theory\n\n(CRES 50101, GNSE 50102, ENGL 50101)\n\nThis graduate course offers a critical introduction to comparative theoretical methods by attending to theory's political and epistemological antagonisms and how they have shaped the ways in which we read literature and art. The seminar begins by tracing critical theory's historical contours-from the high theory boom of the 70s and 80s and the rise of postcolonial, performance, and queer theory in the 90s and 2000s to contemporary critical theory in a comparative context. The course thus attends to problems in thinking about critical theory's scope, boundaries, and canons, as not only as a mode of doing thought but as a site for disciplinary and institutional critique. The seminar explores how theory has both emerged from and animates the worldliness of literature and art as textured imprints of historicity, imagination, and experience across social, cultural and political contexts.\n\n2023-2024 Autumn\n\n50201 Pre-modern Critical Theory: Theory, Critique, and the Making of the Past\n\n(ENGL 50201)\n\nThis course introduces students to ancient, medieval, and early modern literary theory and to modern engagements with these theoretical interventions. We will explore how communities in the past imagined their practices of reading, writing, and interpretation—with especial emphasis on scriptural exegesis—but also what constituted a text, in the first place. How, indeed, were these practices foundational to the formation of communities and, in turn, to alterity? And what role do these literary theories and practices play in longer histories of \"theory\" and \"critique.\" Staging dialogues between the past and the present, this course will ask what the political implications of designating an archive as \"ancient,\" \"archaic,\" \"medieval,\" or \"premodern\" are in order to understand how and why the past is continually made and remade.\n\n2023-2024 Spring\n\n58613 Poetry of the Americas\n\n(ENG 58613)\n\nIn what tangled ways does poetry transform through dialogue across linguistic and geographical distances, and through performance, translation, and collaboration? This seminar takes a comparative, hemispheric approach to 20th- and 21st-century poetries from the Southern Cone to the Caribbean to Canada, with significant attention to Latinx poets. We will examine developments in poetic form, especially transformations of the epic and the lyric, in conjunction with questions of decoloniality, neoliberalism, immigration, labor, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and gender. This course is held in tandem with Fall quarter events including Chicago’s Lit & Luz Festival, which stages Mexican-U.S. artistic collaborations. Seminar members will have the opportunity for dialogue with poets and translators who visit our seminar and/or give poetry readings on campus. (No knowledge of Spanish, French, or Portuguese is required.)\n\n2023-2024 Autumn\n\n26802 Epic Religion: From the Ramayana to Game of Thrones\n\n(GLST 26802 / SALC 26802)\n\nWhat can epic literature and media teach us about religion? In this introductory seminar, students explore answers to this question, focusing on the ways epics dramatize the human relationship to divinity. We read the epics through the relationships of its central characters—humans, heroes, and gods. By following the winding quests and gory battles of these narratives, students examine how epics present various forms of human-divine relationships—transactional, intimate, inspirational, and manipulative. We employ a comparative approach to the genre; our readings originate in different world regions and historical periods—from ancient India and Greece to West Africa, England, and the contemporary US. We will read these texts closely and examine how they reflect particular views of the human condition within religious worldviews. Considering the contexts of post-colonization, nationalism, and globalization, we analyze how mass media—comic books, TV series, films, and social media—shape and spread those views to new popular audiences.\n\nAndrew Kunze\n\n2022-2023\n\n26212 Moses and Modernity\n\n(CRES 26212, GRMN 26212, JWSC 26212, RLST 26212)\n\n“The story of Moses is at once the most nationalist and the most multiculturalist of narratives.”\n\n—Barbara Johnson\n\n“Moses fails to enter Canaan, not because his life is too short, but because it is a human life.”\n\n—Franz Kafka\n\nThe biblical figure of Moses has furnished a diverse range of interpreters—from the early Rabbis, to Black abolitionist activists in the antebellum U.S., to mid-20th century German authors challenging Nazism—with a powerful exemplar of the potential of emancipation and the meaning of national identity. At the same time, the sheer number of interpretations and retellings of the story of Moses and the Exodus of the ancient Israelites from Egypt suggests the contradictions and ambiguities which persistently haunt those political projects. In this discussion-based seminar course, we’ll reflect on both of these aspects of the Exodus story as it is told and retold in modernity. Our journey begins with the books of Exodus and Deuteronomy as well as early rabbinic and Christian exegesis before moving on to more recent representations and interpretations. These include visual artworks (Michelangelo, Chagall); music (Schoenberg, African American spiritual songs); Cecil B. DeMille’s 1923 silent blockbuster The Ten Commandments; Freud’s Moses and Monotheism and a response to Freud by Edward Said; and literary writings by Yehuda Amichai, Shulamith Hareven, Frances E. W. Harper, Zora Neale Hurston, Alain Mabanckou, Thomas Mann, and Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg. The course thus serves as an introduction to comparative methodologies for cultural studies: diachronic, transcultural, and intermedial. Supplementary readings include scholarship by authors like Daniel Boyarin, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Paul Gilroy, Barbara Johnson, Albert Raboteau, and Michael Walzer. All readings are available in translation, but students with reading knowledge of Hebrew, German, or French are welcome to read certain texts in the original languages. Prerequisite: At least one quarter of any Humanities Core sequence.\n\n2022-2023 Autumn\n\n20467 The Nobel Prize In Literature\n\n(FNDL 20467)\n\n2022-2023 Spring\n\n22210 Decolonization And Culture\n\n(CRES 22210)\n\nThis course introduces students to the various theories of militant or “fighting” cultures engendered by global struggles for decolonization throughout the twentieth century. Beginning with the global upswell of revolutionary movements at the end of World War I, intellectuals and artists from the colonial world began to enlist poetry, novels, art, music and other cultural forms in the struggle for decolonization. At the same that culture was instrumentalized for larger political struggles, meanwhile, “culture” itself was increasingly understood as a distinct site of struggle: The decolonization of culture was part and parcel of the decolonization of peoples. This course traces this evolving global discourse linking culture and decolonization across the twentieth century, exploring how writers and activists from the colonial world articulated a new cultural agenda within the context of broader programs of social transformation. Throughout we will contend with key questions and dilemmas faced by culture producers in the age of decolonization: What is the role of artists in a revolution? How does culture serve as a staging-ground larger political and ideological conflicts? What are the promises and pitfalls of treating decolonization as a metaphor? To answer these and other related questions, we will draw on case studies from the Harlem Renaissance, the Proletarian Literature movement, Haitian and Latin American Indigenist movements, Négritude, and Third Worldism.\n\nNoah Hansen\n\n2022-2023 Spring\n\n24223 Parrhesia: Fearless Speech from Socrates to Greta von Thunberg\n\n(GRMN 34223 / PARR 24223 / RLST 24223 / RLVC 34223)\n\nThe course will examine the long history of parrhesia, the Greek term for free and fearless speech, from ancient Athens to its current renaissance through the rediscovery by Michel Foucault. Focusing on the relation of truth and discourse, the course will consider not only the extraction of truth as a form of subjection to disciplinary power but also acts of telling truth to power as a practice of self- formation and exercise of freedom. Parrhesia implies a relation between the human self and the act of truth-telling that is suffused with interesting political, philosophical, and ethical possibilities, which students will be encouraged to explore. The course will begin by reviewing Foucault’s final lectures on parrhesia and “the courage of truth.” It will then examine some of the ancient Greek and Christian texts that Foucault analyzed. It will go on to consider early modern instances of parrhesia (e.g. Galileo and Descartes) and will conclude by surveying relatively recent versions (e.g. Greta von Thunberg and James Comey, JD’85), including contemporary feminist and queer practices of parrhesia. Lectures and discussions in English. No prerequisites.\n\nChristopher Wild\n\n2022-2023 Spring\n\n24623 The Psalms: Communication, Conversion, and Meditation\n\n(FNDL 24625 / GRMN 34623 / RLST 22623 / RLVC 34623)\n\nThe Psalms are the most cited book of the Old Testament in the New Testament. No book of the Bible received more commentary by early Christian and medieval theologians, representing the foundation of all religious knowledge. Lay people through the ages used it in personal prayer and meditation, drawing strength and consolation from this unique Biblical genre. Teachers employed the Psalms to teach children how to write, ensuring that they became part of the linguistic vocabulary and mental imagery of literate people. Not surprisingly, the poetic sensibility and practice of major Western writers from Augustine, Judah Halevi, and George Herbert to Emily Dickinson and Paul Celan was informed by their reading of the Psalms. Given their importance for the religious and literary culture of the Judeo-Christian world, we will begin our course by closely reading a good number of the 150 Psalms, focusing on how they model a paradoxical communication, namely the conversation between a fallible self and an almighty and distant God. We will then hone in on the role of the Psalms for the conversion and formation of the self in number of seminal Christian thinkers such as Augustine, John Cassian, Saint Benedict, Martin Luther, among others. Since the Psalms were disseminated so widely, we will pay particular attention the material and medial forms in which they were read and performed. Readings and discussions in English.\n\nChristopher Wild\n\n2022-2023 Spring\n\n26269 Religious Authority in Comparative Perspective\n\n(DVPR 36269)\n\nWhen somebody tells us about the nature of God or the gods, about what such beings want from us, about our experiences before this life or our destinies after it—why should we believe them? With equal and opposite force, why shouldn’t we believe them? Are the standards of acceptable belief entirely independent of what we’re told by religious authorities, or is it impossible to arrive at any such standards without presuming something we’ve been told? When confronted with diverse claims about the divine, should we try to ascertain which ones are true, should we combine or harmonize them in some way, or should we dismiss the entire conversation as wrongheaded? In this course, we’ll think through these questions with the help of influential texts drawn from the Buddhist, Hindu, Platonic, and classical Chinese traditions.\n\nStephen C. Walker\n\n2022-2023 Spring\n\n26654 Money Matters\n\nMoney is everywhere: in people’s pockets and minds, behind their actions and beyond their dreams. And yet, what money is, how it works or organizes a society are questions that appear to elude us. For some, money is merely a tool used to carry out forms of exchange ingrained in human nature; for others, it is the most fundamental form of cultural mediation affecting from the manner we relate to each other to the way we think. This class aims to understand the functions, uses and representations of this peculiar object from a variety of perspectives. We will read short stories, ethnologies, philosophical texts, or analyze paintings and movies to try to understand money in its different milieux and as the complex institution it is. Other questions addressed in this course are the relation between money and value, the link between commoditization and ethics, or the different substances that historically have functioned as monetary tokens. Materials for this course will include a variety of sources from Marx and Smith to Marco Polo and Shakespeare among many others.\n\n26654 Money Matters\n\nMoney is everywhere: in people’s pockets and minds, behind their actions and beyond their dreams.

What are the stakes of remembering, narrating, and/or fictionalizing these moments of violence? This course, supplemented by historical and theoretical texts, takes a close look at a selection of Caribbean literary works in order to illuminate the complex interaction between violent histories and cultural production. How do Caribbean writers represent historical epochs of terror and torture? What has been the function of violence in literary and cultural history? How do we ethically approach narratives of violence? Is it even possible? Thinking alongside these questions, students will craft close readings, argumentative stances, and personal reflections on the works read in class. These exercises will prepare students for the course’s final research project. Some of the authors we’ll read include Alejo Carpentier, Edwidge Danticat, Rita Indiana, and Jamaica Kincaid, which will help broaden our understanding of literary history across the varied Caribbean region. Materials will be available in their English translation and in their original languages. Course taught in English.\n\n2022-2023 Spring\n\n26789 What is Art for?\n\n(TAPS 26335)\n\nIn October 2022, two Just Stop Oil activists were arrested after throwing tomato soup on Vincent van Gogh's “Sunflowers” painting. Their environmentally-motivated protest raises the question: did their action degrade the famous painting, or, on the contrary, did they revitalize the artwork's relevance in a world where \"Sunflowers\" has become a cliché image, adorning the walls of corporate offices and printed on mass-produced T-shirts? In other words, did the activists make \"good\" use of art? In this seminar, we will study and debate different positions regarding the uses and misuses of aesthetic experience, particularly art, while also taking seriously the possibility that, as Oscar Wilde wrote, “all art is quite useless.” We will consider questions such as: What constitutes good art? Should art be political? Beautiful? Useful? Can the experience of an artwork redefine our understanding of these very concepts? Does art change us, and if so, how? We will explore these themes through a variety of philosophical and literary texts, works of art, and creative assignments designed to expand and enrich our discussions. Theoretical readings include Aristotle, Longinus, Kant, Schiller, Nietzsche, Artaud, Huizinga, Arendt, Nussbaum, and others.\n\n2022-2023 Spring\n\n26789 What is Art For?\n\nTBD\n\n2022-2023 Spring\n\n27125 Voices of Alterity and the Languages of Immigration\n\n(CHST 29025 / ENGL 27125 / ENST 27125 / HIST 27710 / PBPL 27125)\n\nThis course investigates the individual experience of immigration: How do immigrants recreate themselves in this alien world in which they seem to lose part of themselves? How do they find their voices and make a place for themselves in their adoptive homes? If in the new world the immigrant becomes a new person, what meanings are still carried in traditional values and culture? How do they remember their origins and record new experiences?\n\nAngelina Ilieva\n\n2022-2023 Spring\n\n28887 Listening to Gangsta Rap\n\n(CRES 28887)\n\nA study of gangsta rap in from its American origins to its international manifestations. The aim is to graph gangsta rap’s aesthetic conception through a discussion of core “canonical” albums in the history of gangsta rap. Most weeks, album-texts will be paired with essays and book chapters as a way to engage with but ultimately critique Western White Supremacist Hetero-Normative Patriarchal Logo-centrism. To mark our engagement, we ask about the impact of gangsta rap in how we conceptualize other forms of art-making. The working thesis of the course is that gangsta rap is, ironically, the apex of Western culture. Readings in English. I will provide digital copies of the texts/films. All albums can be found on YouTube.\n\n2022-2023 Spring\n\n29887 Iterations of Oedipus\n\n(CLCV 25722 / FNDL 29887)\n\nEngaging themes of agency and freedom, criminality and guilt, self-knowledge and identity, reason and truth, consciousness and the unseen, the story of Oedipus is among the most reworked and reimagined in world literature. This course explores a wide range of versions of the story across a variety of artistic forms. In the first half of the course, as well as reading both of Sophocles’ plays about Oedipus, we will explore the traces of the story as folktale and legend both before and after Sophocles. The second half of the course will be devoted to modern adaptations of the story. These will include dramatic versions from mid-twentieth-century Egypt; the Italian film director Pier Paolo Pasolini’s autobiographical Edipo Re (1967), inflected with Freudian and Marxist themes; Philip Roth’s bestselling novel The Human Stain (2000); and the contemporary Chicano playwright Luis Alfaro’s Oedipus El Rey (2017), set between a California state prison and South Central Los Angeles. Students will be introduced to theories of adaptation and reception, and will have a creative option for the final assignment.\n\n2022-2023 Spring\n\n29943 Diasporic Narratives and Memories\n\n(CHST 29943 / CRES 29943 / HIPS 26943 / KNOW 29943 / MAPH 39943 / REES 29950)\n\nOf the many emigrant communities in Chicago, Belarusians are the only group that does not yet have its own museum. Our course takes this lack as an opportunity to train students to create a grassroots community-driven initiative that empirically develops a conceptual foundation for a new type of multi-ethnic museum of emigration, one that is informed by the experiences of community members themselves and their relationship to the artifacts that define their identities and memories. This course will allow students to actively participate in a museum creation project which takes as its point of departure not a nation-state narrative but the everyday life of a multi-ethnic community with the goal of informing research, policy, and public discourse about emigration. We will center our course around the material heritage of Belarussia and its dispersal in emigration. We will analyze how a diasporic museum's main role is to collect, protect and curate the material legacy of the Belarussian community to ensure its future stability. The course participants will collaborate with the Chicago Studies Program, the NGO Belarusians in Chicago, and the Chicago History Museum to study the role of artifacts in museums. The students will conduct the field work about multi-ethnic Belarusian emigration to include experiences of Belarusian Jews, Belarusian Russians, Belarusian Lithuanians, Belarusian Tatars, and other groups from Belarus.\n\nOlga V.

We will take up interdisciplinary approaches, including translation and critical theory. Students will develop and deepen their skills in close reading and the comparative analysis of text and art forms.\n\n2022-2023 Winter\n\n20800 Brecht and Beyond\n\n(ENGL 24400, CMST 26200, FNDL 22400, TAPS 28435)\n\nBrecht is indisputably the most influential playwright in the 20th century, but his influence on film theory and practice and on cultural theory is also considerable. We will explore the range and variety of Brecht's work, from the Threepenny hit to the agitprop film Kühle Wampe) to classic parable plays, as well as Brecht heirs in German theatre and film (RW Fassbinder & Peter Weiss) theatre and film in Britain (Peter Brook & John McGrath), African theatre and film influenced by Brecht, and the NYC post-Occupy adaptation of Brecht’s Days of the Commune. (Drama, 1830-1940)\n\nThis course also includes a weekly screening session.\n\n2022-2023 Winter\n\n22120 Clair de Lune: Etude comparée de la lune dans le Romantisme littéraire et musical\n\n(FREN 22120)\n\nLe poète romantique éprouve une fascination pour la nuit, lieu des mystères et des passions cachées. La lune est l’élément sublime par excellence, déchirant la nuit, confondant mystère et grandiose. Le thème du clair de lune devient un thème de prédilection du Romantisme, et en particulier des peintres, des poètes et des compositeurs. A travers une étude des œuvres majeures du Romantisme français et allemand (poésies, tableaux, lieders et sonates), nous tenterons d’examiner les différentes phases de la lune, afin de comprendre la versatilité des enjeux et des topoï du Romantisme. C’est l’occasion de revoir des genres littéraires consacrés (le sonnet, la ballade) mais aussi des genres musicaux ou picturaux traditionnels du Romantisme (le paysage surplombant, le nocturne, le lied).\n\nLa lune entraîne le poète romantique dans une rêverie, et revêt tantôt un rôle consolateur (dans une symbiose parfaite avec la nature), tantôt un rôle mélancolique, le poète y voyant le symbole de la féminité et de l’être aimé. Parfois, le mystère de la lune qui avait d’abord frappé le poète laisse place à l’évocation de la mort ou d’une menace. Il arrive enfin que le poète se trouve embarqué dans un voyage extraordinaire : la lune devient alors le fantasme d’une destination surnaturelle et idéale. Nous adopterons également une perspective comparatiste dans ce cours, en examinant les liens entre texte et image, ou bien entre musique et contexte politique.\n\nTaught in French. All of the German texts will be available in French translation.\n\nMaximilie"
