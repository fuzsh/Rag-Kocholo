He was 59.\n\nPOLLOCK\n\nA longtime executive with Hawaiian Airlines, Pollock was responsible for securing and supporting air service to rural Neighbor Island destinations and extending routes to the Mainland and Pacific, including Samoa and Tonga. He is credited with bringing a sense of Hawaiian culture to the airline's product.\n\n\"Lindsey was a visionary with enormous creativity,\" Hawaiian spokesman Keoni Wagner said last night. \"At Hawaiian Airlines, he carved a niche in the airline industry that was uniquely Polynesian, and proud of its heritage. That culture will live on as his legacy.\n\n\"He was also a generous leader and mentor to a lot of us at Hawaiian, and we will all miss him dearly.\"\n\nPollock's concern for Hawai'i and Pacific island nations led him to work closely with public officials to address an array of transportation and tourism issues affecting the islands.\n\nHe grew up in Kalihi in a large Hawaiian family and was schooled in Hawaiian tradition under the guidance of his aunt, the late Muriel Pono Lupenui. As a successful consultant, he became known for coupling his marketing skills with his island roots.\n\nAmong his achievements, Pollock helped build the Miss Hawai'i pageant into a major scholarship program.\n\nIn his public relations work at Hawaiian Airlines, Pollock positioned the company as a sponsor of island festivals and other events, including statewide canoe races. He was the driving force behind making the airline among the original sponsors of the fledgling Merrie Monarch Festival.\n\nHis large family included a brother, the late kumu hula Darrell Lupenui, who is credited with Merrie Monarch performances that changed the look and power of men's hula.\n\nPollock knew the cost of travel would be an obstacle to some entrants, so he created halau discount travel. The airline also flew in judges and provided tickets for hula workshops.\n\nAfter leaving Hawaiian, Pollock provided consulting services to a number of businesses.\n\nHe served as president and longtime board member of Aloha Festivals, and contributed his floral design skills to its award-winning parade floats.\n\nA graduate of Kamehameha Schools, Pollock earned a journalism degree at the University of Oregon. He served two years with the Peace Corps in South Korea and taught briefly at the University of Hawai'i and the state Department of Education in special education.\n\nServices begin with a visitation 5 to 8 p.m. Tuesday at Borthwick Mortuary. There will be another visitation at the mortuary at 10 a.m. Wednesday, followed by a service at noon. Burial is at 2 p.m. at Hawaiian Memorial Park in Kane'ohe.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to Friends of Lindsey Pollock to help establish the Lindsey Pollock Scholarship for the Creative Arts. Donations will be accepted at the service, or can be mailed to Friends of Lindsey Pollock c/o American Savings Bank.\n\nHe is survived by two brothers, four sisters, many nieces and nephews, and an extended family that includes several half brothers and sisters.\n\nSome postings on Peace Corps Online are provided to the individual members of this group without permission of the copyright owner for the non-profit purposes of criticism, comment, education, scholarship, and research under the \"Fair Use\" provisions of U.S. Government copyright laws and they may not be distributed further without permission of the copyright owner.
