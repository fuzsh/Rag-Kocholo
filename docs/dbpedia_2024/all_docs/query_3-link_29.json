        "text": "At PositiveNegatives we produce comics, animations and learning resources about contemporary social and humanitarian issues. You can read more about the power of our personal stories and refugee comics here.\n\nOur educational department, PosNeg Learning, use these comics and animations to connect pupils with new perspectives, helping them to develop their creativity and critical thinking skills. We believe that by doing so, students can be encouraged to look beyond headlines and to tackle globally significant topics such as migration, inequality, health, and development.\n\nWhile many of us are adapting to the new challenges posed by remote learning, we want to share some of our own, and our creative partners’ learning resources. All of these can be downloaded and used for free, by educators anywhere in the world. They are designed for cross-curricular use, and are aimed at KS3-4.\n\nSelected portfolio\n\nThese are stories from our portfolio which especially appeal to younger audiences through character design, storyline and feedback we’ve received from educators and teachers.\n\nOla\n\nDear Habib\n\nBorn Julius and Julian\n\nLife on the Move\n\nA Perilous Journey\n\nLife on the Move\n\nPositiveNegative resources\n\nOur learning resources are produced in collaboration with educators, teachers and pupils. They have been downloaded over 4K times. You can access them all for free on TES.\n\nCreating Safe Spaces\n\nMaths of Migration\n\nOla- There Were Signs: Citizenship & Irregular Status Activities\n\nCitizenship/Young Unaccompanied Asylum Seeker\n\nChoosing A World Free From Female Genital Cutting\n\nAll of our resources have received 5* reviews from teachers who have used them. Educators who are using our resources during remote learning have stated:\n\n‘this is an excellent way to allow students to think outside the box, allowing them to look at real-life stories’.\n\nRead ‘How comics can help students understand the deluge of data‘, one teacher’s account of using our Maths of Migration resources based on MEDMIG data:\n\nCollaborative resources\n\nIn addition to making our own resources, we have also worked in collaboration with partner-organisations. Learning packs that are based on our portfolio of animations and comics include:\n\nTeaching Refugee Experiences produced by House of Illustration\n\nMigrants on the Margins, produced with RGS-IBG\n\nUnravelling the Mediterranean Migration Crisis, produced by RGS-IBG\n\nSyrian Refugees: understanding with comics, produced by Brown University\n\nFriends resources\n\nThese resources are produced by friends of our organisation exploring themes of migration, refugee experience and humanitarian issues.\n\nMigration Museum\n\nCounterpoint Arts (LearningLab)\n\nRunnymede Trust Our Migration Story\n\nWe Belong\n\nLifeworlds Learning\n\nExtra Reading\n\nThese are our suggested extra-curricular reading on topics such as migration, refugee experience and citizenship. They’re accessible to all and written by research partners we work with closely:"
