Our campaigns promote critical thinking and build compassion, capturing the attention of tens of millions of people, providing them with pathways for direct action to solve some of humanity’s most challenging issues.\n\nEDUCATOR HUB\n\nOur Educator Hub is both a network and a set of resources for tens of thousands of educators, reaching 1 million+ students nationwide! Our learning experiences help students: explore new ideas through art & technology; analyze how those ideas relate to their own lives, and; activate their voices and advocacy for a shared world.\n\nDownload and Print\n\nAmplifier makes all of our 1000+ artworks available for free non-commercial download so you can print them and put them up in your home, your place of work or school, and around your community!\n\nShop\n\nOur online store features printed artwork such as limited edition posters, apparel, stickers, postcards & more! Every dollar we raise goes directly to distributing the work to places we believe need this art the most — in the streets, classrooms across the country, and to community organizers working at the frontlines of change."
