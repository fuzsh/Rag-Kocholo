She married Richard Lindsay on June 11, 1994, in Port Huron.\n\nMrs. Lindsay graduated from the Port Huron School District and went on to attend Baker College, where she finished at the top of her class. She had a passion for taking care of the elderly and worked as a medical assistant in nursing homes. She loved spending time with her family. Debra was a beautiful, strong and warmhearted woman, that always had a warm bubbly smile on her face and would give anyone the shirt off her back. She was also an active member of Faith Christian Community Church.\n\nShe leaves to cherish her memory, her devoted and loving husband, Richard Lindsay; her adoring children, Jimmy Boshaw-Conroy and Sean Boshaw-Conroy; two loving stepdaughters, Theresa (Charles) Rice and Brandi Lindsay; a warm step grandson, Terez Watkins; five fond brothers, Ronald Boshaw, Sam (Jean) Catanzaro, Dan (Teresa) Catanzaro, Joe Houle and Michael Houle; a loving sister, Vickie Humphrie; and a host of brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, nieces, nephews and friends.\n\nFuneral services will be held at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, February 14, 2017 in Faith Christian Community Church with visitation beginning at 10 a.m. Pastor Tray Smith will officiate.\n\nMemorials may be made to the family. Arrangements are by Pollock-Randall Funeral Home."
