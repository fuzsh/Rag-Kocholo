        "text": "Given the scope of the problems we face, partnering with corporations is really the only feasible way forward. I think we are more attuned to 'burnish image' #DistractionMarketing these days, but #activists haven't moved to using the skills and techniques that have been effective in the corporate world, and the money that those skills and techniques generated, to create sustainable change. I see articles about 100 companies produce 70% of emissions, as if closing corporations is the answer. Yes, they do pollute, but some of those products are necessary for our continued existence, they've lifted billions out of poverty. It's challenging the system of waste, emissions, regulations (or lack of), lobbying, taxes, worker exploitation that needs to change. It's the reason I keep talking about #marketing. The principles come from #socialpsychology, its basic understanding of how we engage emotions to change attitudes and behaviors. We assume that because the techniques are used effectively by business that they must be evil. They aren't, not if we take back the power and apply them to #socialchange.\n\nI've been seeing this chart make the rounds and really take issue with the assumption by many sharing it that company funding of civil society orgs (CSOs) is inherently bad. As someone who has both worked at CSOs that received grants from tech companies and helped tech companies themselves plan CSO funding, I can tell you the reality is far more nuanced. As background, the source of this chart is this report on big tech lobbying in the EU, which was written a few years back by Corporate Europe Observatory and LobbyControl and was recently updated: https://lnkd.in/daME3tnK. First, there is no doubt that corporate lobbying generally (not just in the tech sector) is often at odds with companies' stated commitments to things like human rights and sustainability. It absolutely deserves more scrutiny and at BSR we regard it as a major barrier to achieving a just and sustainable world. However, just because a CSO receives funding from a tech company does mean it is somehow compromised or part of a sinister corporate lobbying agenda. Companies often provide much needed flexible funding for CSOs that foundations and government funders don't. They tend to come with fewer strings attached, are easier to manage than traditional grants, and often provide CSOs with the freedom to implement as they see fit. In many ways it can be the dream type of funding is generally hard to come by. At BSR we often recommend tech companies fund civil society as part of their human rights responsibility to remedy. Tech harms are complex and cross-society and cannot be remedied by individual companies alone, and funding CSOs can help contribute to the broader remedy ecosystem. Many tech companies fund great activities like emergency support for human rights defenders, human rights convenings, digital security training initiatives, research on human rights issues, and even general organizational funding that CSOs can use however they want. And even when companies fund CSOs to work issues that are in the company's business interest, it does not necessarily mean they are somehow acting as puppeteers or have co-opted the organization. Frankly, companies probably wouldn't have the capacity to do that even if they wanted to. Now of course there is always a risk with any funding source of compromising independence. Companies are no different. It's something CSOs will always have to contend with and make their own decisions about. The devil is usually in the details, and the same funding entity might be great for one issue but concerning for another. It's not always black and white for any type of funder. Finally, I do not know all of the CSOs in this chart, but some like Center for Democracy & Technology do excellent human rights aligned work and frequently criticize the very companies that fund them. So let's not implicitly accuse any organization that receives company funding of somehow being compromised.\n\nCelebrating Nigeria's Democracy Day: A Call to Action for Tech Enthusiasts. Hello Tech Family, Today, as we celebrate Nigeria's Democracy Day, it is a moment to reflect on our journey as a nation and the crucial role we, especially the youth in tech, play in shaping the future. Our country stands at a crossroads, facing numerous challenges that require innovative solutions and strong leadership. This is where our expertise and passion come into play. Leadership in Tech: More Than Just a Skill. Leadership is not just a title; it's a mindset and a responsibility. Whether youâ€™re writing code, developing applications, or managing projects, your leadership can inspire change and drive progress. Great leaders in tech are those who mentor others, share knowledge, and build inclusive communities. They are the ones who see problems as opportunities to innovate and make a difference. Embracing Grit, Resilience, and Tenacity. The current state of our nation can be discouraging, but remember, every significant change starts with resilience and tenacity. Grit is what keeps you going when the going gets tough. It's the determination to keep pushing forward, learning from failures, and celebrating small victories. As tech enthusiasts, we have the tools and the mindset to overcome obstacles and create solutions that can improve lives and transform our society. Love Your Nation and Pray for Her. Despite the challenges, we must keep our love for Nigeria alive. Letâ€™s continue to pray for our country and its leaders, hoping for wisdom and guidance to steer us toward a brighter future. Our prayers are a reflection of our hope and faith in the potential of our nation. Make a Difference in Your Own Space. You donâ€™t need a grand stage to make an impact. Like the hummingbird, doing small things with great love can create ripples of change. In your small space, you can: - Volunteer your skills: Offer to help NGOs, schools, or community projects with tech solutions. - Mentor others: Share your knowledge with younger tech enthusiasts or those just starting out. - Innovate locally: Create solutions that address specific local problems, be it in healthcare, education, or governance. - Advocate for good governance: Use your platforms to speak up about the importance of democracy and accountability. Stay Inspired and Keep Building. To my fellow tech enthusiasts, stay inspired. Continue to build, learn, and grow. Our nation needs us now more than ever. Each line of code, each project completed, and each tech solution developed brings us one step closer to the Nigeria we dream of. Letâ€™s keep our spirits high and our minds focused on the possibilities. Together, we can build a stronger, more resilient nation. Happy Democracy Day, Nigeria! In Tech and Unity, Olusola.\n\nðŸ’¡ If I may share some observations about what I perceive as a highly acrimonious approach in platform accountability and, therefore, unhelpful and ineffective. ðŸ’¡ I come from a background in politics as an opposition MP, where, in committee, I was often the sole voice in a room with ten other MPs whom I had to convince to do the right thing. Sometimes, I lost my temper, and we would have heated arguments. There is a place for that. We are all human, after all. But do you know what remained constant? I had respect and understanding for each one of them. And they had the same for me. I wasn't just there to criticize or to look down my nose at them. This meant that when I presented arguments, which I made sure were compelling, they would listen to me and often make U-turns on issues, even when it was likely to get them into trouble with their party headquarters. Funny story: I was so effective at this that a very corrupt public official, subject to an inquiry we had planned, went to court to have me removed from the committee because he considered me a 'persuasive bad apple.' He lost his case, the committee held the inquiry, and it was bye-bye to him. This brings me to activism against Big Tech. This is not meant as a criticism but rather to suggest a new way of doing things. IDENTIFYING PROBLEMS is excellent, but is that without strategies to solve the problem? A list of grievances. Having SOLUTIONS implemented is what should be the goal - catalyzing change. You should aim to eventually sit at the table with the platforms and make compelling arguments about what needs to change. Press statements and public outrage certainly have their place in advocacy. Still, they should aim primarily to suggest reform and indicate a willingness to work with the platforms to implement those reforms. You will not get all your asks, but that's lifeâ€”win and lose some. This hate-hate relationship that casts everyone working at tech companies as horned demons is not only untrue, but it also creates an atmosphere where the other person feels disrespected and closed off to anything you have to say. They are PEOPLE. Treat people with the humanity you expect for yourself, and magic will happen. This is not a war; it is activism to bring about change, not to vanquish your \"enemy.\" Also, don't inherit enemies and beef. Meet a person, talk to them, and then decide for yourself. You're not required to assimilate and toe any lines about enemies and who you should have beef with. Be YOU. That's all I'm saying. You attract more bees with honey than with vinegar. #activism #accountability #socialmediareform #techethics #advocacy #problemsolvers #solutionoriented\n\nKudos to Joe Schoffstall at Fox News Media for actually doing some research into the funding of groups like American Economic Liberties Project (AELP) and AI Now. There's nothing inherently wrong with bringing in outside experts to help an agency understand new policy areas. But just calling yourself a \"public interest group\" does not necessarily mean that your interests are 100% aligned with the public. In the case of AELP, where the former Executive Director is now Chief of Staff to FTC Chair Khan and the former communications director is now Deputy Chief of Staff to Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, George Soros' Open Society Foundations ($500,000) and Pierre Omidyar's Omidyar Network ($230,000) gave 26.6% of the entity's operating budget for 2021. And, according to AAG Kanter's financial disclosures, the Omidyar Network was a client of his law firm before he became Assistant Attorney General. What is less clear is the motivations that the Omidyar Network and Soros' Open Society Foundations had for making those donations. For instance, on December 5, 2023, AELP, along 10 other groups sent a letter to National Economic Council Director Lael Brainerd requesting greater antitrust enforcement in the AI space against \"Big Tech.\" Of those 11 organizations, five had received funding from the Omidyar Network in either 2021 or 2022 totalling $1,095,000. On that same day, the Omidyar Network announced an \"initial $30M investment across a diverse slate of organizations to support the responsible development of generative AI.\" Buried within the press release was a statement that \"Omidyar Network will also invest in private venture capital funds to support companies that are using generative AI to innovate in healthcare diagnosis, chip design, next generation EV batteries, and analytics support for small and medium-sized businesses.\" It's impossible to tell just from that line in the press release, but using the term \"invest\" in conjunction with \"private venture capital funds\" suggests that the Omidyar Network could see a return on its investment. In other words, there is a real possibility that the Omidyar Network stands to gain financially from its investments in AI - and therefore has a monetary stake in how the regulatory environment shapes up. Maybe those developments are related. Maybe they are not. But pretending that there is no possibility of conflicts of interest just because an entity claims to be in the \"public interest\" is not, well, in the public interest. #ai #competitionlaw #antitrustlaw #conflictsofinterest\n\nWe're asking questions. We're getting answers. TechFounder's parliamentary questions were raised by Deputy Louise O'Reilly with answers from Minister for Enterprise Simon Coveney on the level of enterprise funding going to women founders. DÃ¡il Ã‰ireann Debate, Monday - 11 September 2023. Answers back include the shocking stat that three-quarters of Enterprise Ireland funding goes to men. https://lnkd.in/eunfHCuy Women founders want to fully contribute to our society and economy and we are impatient for change. TechFoundHer has been busy. The starting point is getting the facts. This is an important issue, as you cannot change what you don't measure. And we're getting the answers! Change come from collective action and seeking transparency and accountability from government and decision makers. But more than that it's time for a game change in how we enable women and diverse entrepreneurs to contribute and thrive. TechFoundHer wrote a number of parliamentary questions requesting data about the level and amount of government enterprise funding going to women and shared these with opposition and government parties. We have identified from the Department of Enterprise's answers that there is insufficient and poor quality data on the number of applicants and the share and amount of funding going to women founded companies. Our parliamentary questions and answers were picked up by the Business Post and this is just the start of the debate. https://lnkd.in/e-dgceuU Over the months ahead our campaign for answers and change continues. #EnoughIsEnough #TechFoundHer #WomenInTech #FemaleFounders Tony Marron Kathleen K.

This week, we're taking a closer look at Hypha Worker Co-operative (hypha.coop). I spoke with Hypha members Lexa Michaelides & Vincent Charlebois about what it's like to be part of a tech worker co-op. In Toronto, Ontario, Hypha Worker Co-op emerges as a beacon of innovation, community engagement, and sustainable solutions. Merging collective growth with the democratization of technology, Hypha is charting a course where technology is aligned with cooperative principles. Hypha operates as a tech consultancy. Their projects range from blockchain explorations with Cosmos Hub, to prototyping Data Integrity tools and principles through Starling Lab, to pioneering decentralized publishing with Distributed Press. Their work showcases not just technical expertise, but a deep commitment to leveraging technology for societal benefit. Hypha's non-hierarchical structure inspires collective participation and responsibility among all member-workers. Vincent explains, \"We are a flat organization...there are no bosses, right? It's us. It is our co-op. Our involvement will be what we get out of it\". Lexa adds \"Even when there's something that I ostensibly could be mad at a boss [for], well, the eight of us decided to do it that way, and I was part of that decision. So [if] I'm upset and want it changed, we'll all talk about it and probably find a better solution\". The co-op's policies foster a culture in which each member's contributions drive the collective success. Their dedication to innovation and transparency is reflected in the development and use of open-source technologies and the promotion of open collaboration. Vincent states, \"One of our values is to work open...our intranet is our handbook, and it's openly available\". This approach not only strengthens Hypha's internal community but also contributes positively to the broader technological landscape by advocating for openness and shared knowledge. Hypha leverages its non-profit legal structure to maintain its mission-focused trajectory. \"Being structured as a non-share capital entity, certainly helps. There's nothing to own...[it's] just being us and not like purely a wealth generation mechanism\", Lexa explains. As Hypha navigates the tech landscape with integrity and transparency, their open handbook (handbook.hypha.coop) invites all to explore the cooperative model and the sustainable practices that guide their technology development. How would your work life be different if you were part of a worker co-op? Share your thoughts in the comments below! Join us next Tuesday as we spotlight Pavilion, a freelancer co-op leveraging the open-source Discourse platform to solve community problems. Until next time -- stay collaborative! #TechCoopTuesday #Technology #Cooperatives #WorkerCoops #DecentralizedWeb"
