Growing up on the prairies of South Dakota, her interest for drawing and painting was sparked from a very early age. Currently living part time in the beautiful St. Croix Valley of Northwest Wisconsin and surrounded by lakes and Wisconsin farmland, this place continues to nurture her love for the outdoors and is a continual source of inspiration.\n\nWith the opportunity to live abroad in London, England and her extensive travel to various parts of the world, these opportunities have provided many subjects to draw from for inspiration. She is particularly drawn to cultural diversity when picking her subject matter. Patricia prefers painting natural landscapes, people, animals, architecture, and still life.\n\nWith Patricia’s interest in art since childhood, to further her education in the arts, she pursued a fine arts degree at the University of Utah in the performing art division of ballet. Through these experiences, her passion and desire to continue to develop her artistic endeavors grew stronger. After raising five children, her life long dream is being realized to pursue her art. She has participated in classes and workshops taught by nationally and internationally recognized and known artists. Patricia continues to train extensively under Plein Aire Painters of America signature artist, Joseph Paquet. Her desire to refine her drawing and painting skills is evident to her commitment to artistic growth.\n\nGuild membership is encouraged but not required to attend monthly programs. Dues of $20 per year support Guild programs and contribute to the museum’s Art Acquisitions Fund.\n\nThe South Dakota Art Museum’s Art Guild series continues with “Art Is…Your Passport to Creativity” featuring Watertown artist Jennifer Stone.\n\nWatch the replay.\n\nAn award-winning artist, Jennifer Stone has been painting for over 25 years. Her expressions are primarily water media, and feature unconventional methods to enhance design, color, and texture. The art she creates is typically abstracted, or non-representational, and reflects her own interpretation of our world. Stone says, “To this day, I am still humbled when I am made aware my painting has touched the soul of another person, or brought them pleasure. This inspires me and gives me hope that I can continue to leave an impression with some of the images I have created.” Creating art for Jennifer Stone is as natural and necessary to her as breathing. Primarily self-taught, Stone dedicates the majority of her time to painting in her studio. “My studio is located next door to our home, on an acreage surrounded by trees, wildlife and serenity. This keeps my mind free of any of life’s busyness and gives me the opportunity to focus with an open and clear mind.”\n\nMixed media is Stone’s preferred medium at this time. Her curiosity in creating her own handmade collage papers has launched a new workshop that she teaches and has been well-received by other mixed media enthusiasts.\n\nStone’s singular style has earned her numerous awards and countless admirers. Her accolades include both state and national titles, with her work displayed in private and corporate collections internationally. Stone has studied with a variety of artists, including Cheng Khee Chee, Gerald Brommer, Robert Burridge, Zoltan Zsabo, Anne Bagby, Mark Mehaffey, Andy Evansen, Karen Knutson, Janet Rogers, and many more. This assisted her on her journey to find her voice. While the influence of each of these learning experiences can be found in her art, Stone’s own voice speaks clearly in her work. She attributes this to the dedication she puts forth in working at her craft. Her artwork may be viewed at jenniferstoneartwork.com. Guild membership is encouraged but not required to attend monthly programs. Dues of $20 per year support Guild programs and contribute to the museum’s Art Acquisitions Fund.\n\nWatch the replay.\n\n\"Moments of Is: Stuart Artists-in-Residence Alums\"\n\nJoin us for this Virtual Artist Chat with some of the innovative contemporary artists who participated in the Stuart Artist-In-Residence at South Dakota State University:\n\nJessica Campbell, Toronto\n\nLori Larusso, Louisville, Kentucky\n\nTanner Lind, Portland, Oregon\n\nIzel Vargas, Delray Beach, Florida\n\nExplore their unique perspectives and techniques behind their works of art.

She began ballet at Dance Gallery of South Dakota. At age 13 she moved to Philadelphia, PA to train at the Rock School for Dance Education. Madeleine competed in Youth America Grand Prix (the world’s largest scholarship ballet competition) where she was invited to compete in New York City Finals each time she has competed. Madeleine’s professional dance training also includes the School of American Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, Chautauqua Dance Festival, Ballet West Academy Trainee Program, Ellison Ballet, Jose Carreno Dance Festival, Cecchetti Council of America Summer School and many more. Madeleine trained privately in New York City with Elena Kunikova throughout her career.\n\nShe is a profoundly driven young woman with a vision to bring ballet to all 50 states. Madeleine began planning for South Dakota Ballet amidst her senior year at the University of Utah where she earned her degree in ballet. She also studied nonprofits and community engagement. She has gained unique insight while performing professionally with companies such as Ballet West, Aspen Santa Fe Ballet, L.E.D. Boise (“Dance Magazine” 2019 Top 25 To Watch) and Sacramento Ballet.\n\nShe looks forward to sharing ballet and its culture with the residents of South Dakota. While she may be starting from scratch, Madeleine sees this as an advantage. She sees South Dakota Ballet as a clean slate with the opportunity to implement the best ingredients of traditional ballet culture through a modern lens. Madeleine strives to design a company that will become an example to others across the country, leading the future of ballet to a more inclusive culture and broadened vision for sustainable community impact. Madeleine is currently a professional dancer with Dance Aspen.\n\nGuild membership is encouraged but not required to attend monthly programs.

Peonies, poppies, marigolds and hollyhocks “bloom” in her watercolors. Her botanical paintings convey the fantasy world she created in her imagination as a child. Binkley describes her purpose in art “to conjure joy.” Binkley, a graduate of South Dakota State University in Fine Arts and Painting and Art Education, taught for a number of years in the Brookings School System. A year ago, she transitioned from full-time teacher to full-time artist and stay at home mother. She teaches various community art classes, commissions paintings and makes her art available through on-line sales and regional art festivals.\n\n2022\n\nWatch Replay\n\nDr. Lindsay Twa is Professor of Art and Chair of the Humanities Division at Augustana University, where she teaches a wide range of art history courses and leads study away to India, England, and New York City.

This is the 2nd free Community Art Day, co-sponsored with the Brookings Arts Council.\n\nWatch Replay\n\nGerald Cournoyer is an artist and educator and an enrolled member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe. He followed in the footsteps of prominent Dakota painter Oscar Howe to the University of Oklahoma to pursue and eventually achieve his Masters of Fine Arts in painting. He previously attended the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, NM where he received an Associate Degree in Fine Arts in painting. He received his BFA and Master’s Degree from the University of South Dakota in interdisciplinary studies. After receiving his MFA from the University of Oklahoma, he was employed as a professor of painting. Cournoyer also holds a Master’s of Arts in Arts Management utilizing his expertise in networking and developing relationships among artists and the funding agencies who support artist philanthropy. He recently returned to school to earn another Master’s degree in Philanthropy and Fundraising from Central Michigan University.\n\nCournoyer came from a skilled background of stylized ledger art and figurative Indian portraits. Over time, his work expanded into vibrant abstract watercolors and acrylics. This eventually led him into patterns of Lakota quillwork, and rawhide parfleche, beadwork on canvas, including large nonfigurative expanses of color and form that offer the viewer an opportunity to explore the depth of scintillating color combined with Native patterns. These intricate patterns are based on the early geometric patterns of the Northern Plans quill designs and are prominent in the Lakota iconography. Gerald Cournoyer states: “As an artist, I strive to bridge the gap between traditional Lakota art and contemporary movements by incorporating traditional symbols in a contemporary fashion.” His work is shown in regional, national and international venues.\n\nWatch Replay\n\nGinny Freitag is an artist and teacher living in Madison, South Dakota. She primarily works in mixed media ceramic, sculpting the female figure and its relationships with nature and ritual. She also incorporates found objects into her works. Some of them she discovers while hiking in the outdoors, and others while wandering through flea markets. Ginny tries to create a narrative in her work that the viewer can translate into their own experience.\n\nShe graduated from Dakota State University in 1984 with a bachelor’s degree and a major in art. She retired from teaching art in the Madison Central School District in 2018, and currently creates her art from a studio in her home. Ginny received a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1996, and an artist project grant from the South Dakota Arts Council in 2012. She has been in one- and two-person shows at the Oscar Howe Art Gallery at The University of South Dakota, the South Dakota Art Museum, the Firehouse Gallery, the Eastbank Art Gallery, and the Karl Mundt Library, as well as many group-shows. Ginny is also a founding member of Journey Women, a group of female artists who have had three exhibitions at the Washington Pavilion. Ginny has taken numerous graduate classes, also spending time in Grand Marais each summer in a mentored workshop with noted artist and women activist Hazel Belvo. Ginny lists artists Connie Herring and Hazel Belvo as the major influences in the development of her work.\n\nGrab your morning coffee with a fun livestream look at artwork from the South Dakota Art Museum Collection with Dr. Craig Howe, Center for American Indian Research and Native Studies (CAIRNS) Director, and SDAM Collections Curator, Taylor McKeown.\n\nNo replay is available.\n\n\"The Gift\", is based on a traditional Lakotan narrative about when White Buffalo Woman, an emissary from the Pte Oyate (Buffalo Nation), gave a sacred pipe to the Itazipco Oyate, one of seven oyates of the Lakota division of the Oceti Sakowin Confederacy. In the Standing Rock Reservation in 1911, Lone Man shared a narrative, “The White Buffalo Calf Pipe (Ptehin’cala Canonpa),” about the gift, with Frances Densmore who published it in 1918. It is a wondrous account of that event.\n\nThe exhibitions features visual artworks, music and poetry by contemporary Lakota artists, musicians and poets.
