        "meta_description": "Listen to this episode from Cracking Coconuts on Spotify. In this episode, we discuss Vanni, a graphic novel illustrated by Lindsay Pollock and written by Benjamin Dix. The novel draws on research and eye-witness accounts to bring to you a family’s struggle to survive during the Sri Lankan civil war.  The conflict claimed the lives of over 220,000 Sri Lankans and generated a global diaspora of 600,00 to 800,00 Sri Lankan Tamils. This year marks a decade since the end of the Sri Lankan civil war, one of the world’s deadliest conflicts. Our guest, Benjamin Dix, shares with us his work as well as personal anecdotes that are sure to take you on an emotional rollercoaster.
