        "text": "Dr. Lindsey Pollock’s love for public education was born long before her. Inspired by the passion and work ethic of her father (a college professor), her mother (a first-grade teacher), and her grandfather (a school custodian), education was all Lindsey knew as a child – and she loved it! From a young age, she’d line up her dolls in a makeshift classroom, pretending to be a teacher and making her brother attend her “classes.” That Lindsey would go on to earn her doctorate in education didn’t surprise her mother, who predicted she’d be a principal one day. While her journey has been filled with exciting adventures along the way, her public education career has far exceeded her childhood dreams.\n\nIn addition to her doctorate in educational leadership, Lindsey holds master’s degrees in educational leadership, social work and Montessori integrative learning. Along with a variety of Texas teaching certifications, Lindsey is a licensed social worker and holds a Montessori administrator credential. She recently retired from the Houston ISD after 13 years as the principal of Garden Oaks Montessori, a PK3 – 8th grade public school. Her public school service spans over two decades. Today, as the Executive Director of The Lian Dante Foundation, Lindsey coordinates Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts as well as social services to children, families and campuses. Her efforts continue to impact classrooms and communities in a new and ever-meaningful way."
