        "text": "Installing Officer\n\nGrand President Amy Burnham Onken, Illinois Epsilon\n\nInstallation at Alabama Beta\n\nThe chapter was installed on September 19, 1949. The installation banquet was held at the McLester Hotel. During the banquet, the Birmingham, Alabama, Alumnae Club presented each new initiate with Pi Phi stationery. The celebration concluded the next day with a reception at the chapter house.\n\nLiving at Alabama Beta\n\nIn the spring of 2018, Alabama Beta will be introducing a new house to the Alabama campus. It will be 40,000 square feet, double the size of the most previous home. There are 32 bedrooms, which holds 63 members. There will be one single bedroom, one guest room and the rest are double bedrooms. This house will be an exciting milestone for the Alabama Beta chapter once the facility is open, not only because it will be just as big as the other sorority chapter houses on campus, but the sisters will also be able to live in a home once again. For the 2016–2017 school year, chapter housing consists of a modular unit which does not allow members to live in a house while the new one is being built. The chapter is so proud and excited to have this new home in the Alabama Panhellenic family.\n\nIn the old home, there was a fountain in the backyard that was donated by alumnae. There were also engraved bricks that made up the porch from the house before that where people could donate to have their names put on them for the new house. There is also a painting of a floral arrangement that was donated by the family of an Alabama Beta member who was killed in the 1970s.\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nAlpha Chi Omega, Alpha Delta Chi, Alpha Delta Pi, Alpha Omicron Pi, Alpha Phi, Chi Omega, Delta Delta Delta, Delta Gamma, Delta Zeta, Gamma Phi Beta, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Delta, Kappa Kapp]a Gamma, Phi Mu, Pi Beta Phi, Sigma Delta Tau and Zeta Tau Alpha.\n\nPhilanthropic Events\n\nGreek Man of the Year and Follow Your Arrow 5K\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nThe chapter's philanthropic events include Greek Man of the Year in the fall and Follow Your Arrow 5K in the spring.\n\nNotable Alumnae\n\nEugenie Bondurant, Actress, Played “Tigris” in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 2\n\nCarolyn Helman Lichtenberg Crest Award Winners from Alabama Beta\n\nBecky Griffith (2015)\n\nDr. Kathleen Boyle Bond (1993)\n\nInstalling Officers\n\nGrand President Alice Weber Mansfield (Johnson), Missouri Beta\n\nInstallation of Arizona Beta\n\nThe chapter was installed on May 1, 1965. That May Day, 29 New Members were initiated into Pi Beta Phi by Grand President Alice Weber Mansfield (Johnson), Missouri Beta. Other installing officers included Grand Secretary Fay Martin Gross, Illinois Zeta; Grand Treasurer Olivia Smith Moore, Missouri Alpha; NPC Delegate Dorothy Weaver Morgan, Nebraska Beta; Director of Membership Helena Dingle Moore, California Gamma; Pi Province South Alumnae President Mary Emrich Van Buren, Illinois Beta; Pi Province President Carolyn Moody Lockhart, Oklahoma Alpha; and Past Pi Province South Alumnae President Jesse Moeur French, Alberta Alpha.\n\nThe setting for the weekend festivities of Initiation and Installation of the Arizona Beta Chapter was the renowned Camelback Inn.\n\nAfter the afternoon initiation, an installation banquet was held. The banquet theme was “Lift Off.” Special guest speakers included Fraternity officers who described their personal experiences with some of the founders. Charter members included alumna initiate Margaret Johnson Goldwater, wife of U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater.\n\nAmid telegrams, flowers, gifts and the Candlelighting Ceremony, it was a festive evening. Past Pi Province South Alumnae President Jesse Moeur French, Alberta Alpha, presented the chapter with a gavel used by her father, Benjamin Moeur, when he was Governor of the State of Arizona. The Pi Province Chapters presented a Loving Cup and the charter members presented the new chapter with an arrow plaque and a mosaic of the Pi Phi crest. To complete the weekend, on Sunday, the new initiates and visiting officers attended church together. Sunday afternoon, Pi Phi alumnae and the new initiates hosted a reception for Arizona State University faculty members, parents of initiates, the Dean of Women and President of the University.\n\nLiving at Arizona Beta\n\n“Pi Phi Paradise” at the Adelphi clusters in Tempe, Arizona, is what is home to members! The cluster consists of double occupancy rooms and a few single suites. Currently, there are 27 women living in the cluster from various New Member classes. You can always find members doing homework in the newly remodeled study room, watching TV in the newly decorated chapter room or sitting outside together enjoying the Arizona weather on the porch! Every couple of weeks, the chapter hosts “family dinner” where all members get together, enjoy a delicious catered meal and spend time talking about their weeks. You can always find members in each other’s rooms (and closets!). There is never a dull moment in Pi Phi Paradise.\n\nThe chapter has an awesome collection of Arrow magazines dating back since the 1950s! They are carefully kept and are organized in a bookcase. Along with the old Arrow magazines members can look through, there are a few scrapbooks from previous years with photos of different events that the chapter still hosts. Chapter members love seeing the strong sisterhood that was here years and years before the current members came along. One of the most special items the chapter has is a scrapbook from charter members from 1965. It has photos of initiation, events and sisterhoods. It means so much to the chapter to have those memories to look to and remind the current members why they chose Pi Phi.\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nAlpha Chi Omega, Alpha Gamma Delta, Alpha Phi, Alpha Delta Pi, Chi Omega, Delta Gamma, Delta Zeta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Kappa Delta, Kappa Alpha Theta, Pi Beta Phi and Sigma Kappa\n\nPhilanthropic Events\n\nArrowspike and\n\nPi Beta Phry\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nThe chapter’s main philanthropy event is Arrowspike in the fall. A recent Arrowspike, raised more than $22,100! Events during this week of fundraising included a Chipotle® fundraiser, “Penny Wars” during the week leading up to the main event, Pi Beta Phry (where chicken tenders and fries are sold), Tug-of-War, Paint a Pi Phi (one big color war!) and of course, a Sand Volleyball tournament. One year the chapter ran out of more than 300 pounds of chicken tenders in the first two and a half hours of Pi Beta Phry!\n\nNotable Alumnae\n\nDr. Christine Kajikawa Wilkinson, Vice President for Student Affairs at Arizona State University\n\nNicole Powers Ramirez, Blogger of lovinglifeandlivingonless.com\n\nSamantha Ponder, Sportscaster for ESPN college football and basketball sideline reporter\n\nCarolyn Helman Lichtenberg Crest Award Winners from Arizona Beta\n\nDr. Christine Kajikawa Wilkinson (1993)\n\nInstalling Officer\n\nGrand President May Lansfield Keller, Maryland Alpha\n\nInstallation of Arkansas Alpha\n\nA local group, Gamma Epsilon Delta, was formed in February 1906. There were 28 members initiated on December 29, 1909, in the bottom right bedroom of Mary Campbell’s home on Dickson Street.\n\nThe group officially became a chapter of Pi Beta Phi on December 29, 1909. Installation activities took place in had been the Arkansas building at the 1904 World’s Fair.\n\nLiving at Arkansas Alpha\n\nRecently the chapter members moved into its new home after a large renovation. The first home on the University of Arkansas campus sits at 519 North Oakland Avenue in Fayetteville. This house was called “The Arrow Lodge” when Pi Phis still lived there, but Alpha Delta Pi moved into this house in 1952.\n\nThis is when the chapter moved to 502 W. Maple Street, where the second home and new house currently sit. The second house on campus held many nicknames including the Princess Palace and the Pink Palace, was torn down in 2015 so the chapter could rebuild and expand. “The Pink Palace” still holds a very special place in chapter member’s hearts; however, the women are excited about this new era for Arkansas Alpha.\n\nThe new house is 42,000-square-feet. There are 98 beds for chapter members and an additional bed for the House Director. The chapter room has a \"hidden wall\" that will allow it to function as a New Member room during the New Member period as well as the chapter room all at the same time! After initiation, the wall will be pushed back and the space will function as one larger chapter room. Members are proud of this new facility, because it was built to meet the needs of college women today, and also for decades to come. Arkansas Alphas everywhere were challenged to build the house, and they rose to the occasion. It is a beautiful, fresh and welcoming home for all who live and visit the house, which is reflective of the wonderful members who will live there.\n\nIn the old house, members had a saying of \"I'll leave it on the marble,\" or \"sign up on the marble,” and everyone knew exactly what it meant. The marble was removed from the old house and a custom piece of furniture was made with the marble on the top, in hopes that it can serve the same purpose in the new house. This piece of furniture is located where everyone passes by on a regular basis, so there is excitement to see how the marble's purpose remains the same.\n\nIn the new house there are two fireplaces. The stone and brick was saved from the old house's two fireplaces to be used in the new house. Especially relevant is the brick from the old fireplace which was brick from the original Wilson homestead that once stood on the property. This brick is used on the second story fireplace. The crest that was in the old chapter room was saved for the new chapter room. The table where the President sits during chapter meetings was also preserved. The chapter has a tradition that all Chapter Presidents sign the bottom of the table.\n\nThe cornerstone of the new house is being inscribed for Arkansas Alpha Mary Campbell Gregory, who was a founding member and first Chapter President. She and her husband also donated the property to the chapter in the 1950s, which is noted on the cornerstone. Sealed in the walls of the new chapter room is the \"graffiti\" of the women who served on Chapter House Corporation, Alumnae Advisory Committee and Executive Council during the building process. There are two special Balfour Cup displays that were carefully removed from the old house and saved for the new one. One case, holding the three latest consecutive Balfour Cup wins is displayed in the living room. The other case, which holds one Balfour Cup, representing the previous three consecutive wins, are displayed in the library and foyer.\n\nThe new home houses 98 women in 37 bedrooms consisting of doubles, triples and quads and a presidential suite. This new facility is incredibly special because many of the rooms in the house and bricks around the outdoor living space were purchased and dedicated by alumnae who have made a huge impact on the chapter.\n\nOne of the trademark decorations in the house is the “arrow wall” of framed arrows that previously lined the staircase in the old house, but is now in the dining room. Another special piece in the home is the angel fountain that members often sat around to chat, study and share meals. The angel fountain was rebuilt for the new house in order to maintain some of chapter member’s favorite aspects of the old house and to keep tradition alive.\n\nArrow pillows are one of the chapter’s favorite traditions. Each New Member receives a handmade arrow pillow that is unique to them with their name from their Big Sis/mentor after initiation. Members keep their arrow pillows on their beds or in their rooms for the duration of the collegiate experience. It is definitely the most common decoration in the house!\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nAlpha Chi Omega, Alpha Delta Pi, Alpha Omicron Pi, Chi Omega, Delta Delta Delta, Delta Gamma, Kappa Delta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Phi Mu and Zeta Tau Alpha\n\nPhilanthropic Event\n\nPi Beta Phi 5k\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nArkansas Alpha’s largest philanthropy event is the annual “Pi Beta Phi 5k.” Recently the chapter raised $39,000, and the event continues to grow within the community each year. The race starts and ends at the Pi Beta Phi Centennial Gate on campus and businesses in the community come to show their support for the philanthropy. The Pi Beta Phi Centennial Gate is a beautiful gate donated to the University of Arkansas campus by Arkansas Alpha after raising $1 million to celebrate 100 years on the University of Arkansas Campus in 2009.\n\nNotable Alumnae\n\nGene Jones, philanthropist\n\nJennie Allen, author\n\nBeth Brickell, actress\n\nRev.

It has been reinstalled twice, a strong testament to the dedication the chapter has to Pi Beta Phi. The chapter was reinstalled for the first time on February 11, 1905, and again on November 11, 1979. In both instances when the chapter closed, it was due to the University ordering the women’s fraternities to close.\n\nThe first installation occurred on September 13, 1893, less than three years after Stanford University opened its doors. The chapter lived in Roble Hall, one of the oldest dorms on campus today and held their chapter meetings there.\n\nIn 1905, a group of Pi Phis transferred to Stanford and formed an initiative to reinstate the chapter. After several relocations and multiple denied applications, the California Alpha Chapter was approved to be rechartered on February 11, 1905. Until 1944 the Pi Phis on Stanford’s campus lived in what is today known as “French house,” but in 1944 Stanford University imposed a ban on all women’s Greek organizations and California Alpha was forced to disband for a second time.\n\nFinally, in 1979, the chapter was reinstated and since then the chapter has thrived, with the University awarding the chapter with a University-owned house in 2000.\n\nLiving at California Alpha\n\nThe chapter house has 57 Pi Phis, sophomores to seniors, living in a combination of triples, doubles and singles. The chapter is one of the only three sororities at Stanford allowed to have its own house, which makes the house very special to the chapter and a privilege members are very proud to have. Members feel incredibly fortunate to have a place to call home and to conduct all official business. The house is the heart of the chapter and there is never a time where there aren’t Pi Phis gathered in the dining room or common areas working, talking or just spending time together. What sets the house apart, besides the unique and diverse members, is the effort put into creating a welcoming atmosphere for fellowship and comraderie. The house is also known for its amazing meals, thanks to a fabulous chef. The dining room is never empty!\n\nThe chapter house is owned by the University, in accordance with University policy. When sororities were reinstated on Stanford’s campus in 1978, it was conditional upon each organization demonstrating they would operate with values in mind. As a result, the University insisted upon retaining ownership of the house and restricted certain practices. Because Pi Phi does not own the house and Stanford considers it a part of the school housing system and places non-members in the house when the chapter is not present, the chapter members are not free to decorate as they choose. Instead, members rely upon the comraderie and close friendships within the chapter to make the house special and put a strong emphasis on community.\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nAlpha Epsilon Phi, Alpha Phi, Chi Omega, Delta Delta Delta, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma and Pi Beta Phi\n\nPhilanthropic Events\n\nArrowspike\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nRecently, the chapter hosted a sand volleyball tournament called Arrowspike, allowing members of the Stanford community to sign up in teams to compete in support of Read > Lead > Achieve®. In addition to fundraising on campus and selling food and merchandise at the event, corporate sponsors can donate at a variety of levels to support the cause. Not only does the event help raise awareness and money in support of Read > Lead > Achieve, but it also helps foster a sense of community amongst the broader Stanford student body.\n\nNotable Alumnae\n\nDr. Louise Pearce, physician and pathologist whose research led to the cure for African Sleeping sickness in the early 20th century\n\nAmy Biehl, social justice advocate who was killed while working in support of the transition from apartheid to democracy in South Africa\n\nLucy Davis, silver medalist in team jumping for the US Equestrian Team at the 2016 Rio Olympics\n\nJayne Appel, center on the San Antonio Stars in the WNBA who also played basketball for Stanford\n\nLaura Granville, professional American tennis player who set Stanford’s record for the most consecutive singles victories at 58\n\nInstalling Officer\n\nGrand President Sarah Ruth Mullis, South Carolina Alpha\n\nInstallation of California Nu\n\nInstallation weekend took place November 15–17, 2002. The local Installation Committee Chair was Kentucky Beta Karen Emberton. Her committee included Anne Zantop Cioffi, Jan Kincaid Clifford, Anne-Marie Anderson Bulawka, Desiree Dexter Brown, Sherry ZeBrack Berg, Ashley Dye, Sheila McKenna, Christina Running, Carolyn Stirling and Mary Allison Davis Kusserow.\n\nFriday included the reading of the Constitution and Statutes, followed by a formal ceremony for alumnae initiates at the Huesman Hall. Following the formal ceremony, the Preparatory Service was held. Chapter members participated in a Cookie Shine that included alumnae. The Initiation Ceremony was held at the Holy Activity Parish on November 16. Grand President Sarah Ruth \"Sis\" Mullis conducted the Initiation Ceremony for 71 collegians and three alumna initiates. Grand Vice President Finance Maurine Hager Jones, Montana Alpha, and Grand Vice President Membership Kay Knittle Brock, Colorado Alpha, assisted during the ceremony. Saturday evening's banquet was held at the Renaissance Hotel. Following the introduction of the collegiate and alumna initiates, Sis Mullis presented a silver tray from Grand Council. Past Grand Council Member Evelyn Peters Kyle, Illinois Alpha, also presented a silver tray to the chapter. Kim Barger Durand presented a pair of candelabras from the chapters of Alpha-Zeta Province.\n\nGrand President Sis Mullis installed the chapter. The women then provided entertainment by leading the group in Pi Phi \"Ring Ching\" and \"One Two Three Words.\" Karen Emberton read a poem from Poet Laureate Evelyn Peters Kyle, written in honor of the installation. On Sunday, a model chapter meeting was held in Pereira Hall on the LMU campus. California Nu New Chapter Assistance Officer Jane Landreth Russell presided over the meeting. Grand President Sis Mullis installed chapter officers and presented Chapter President Meghan Elizabeth Bryan with the president's badge. Grand President Emerita Jean Wirths Scott, Pennsylvania Beta, then presented the Panhellenic Delegate with a pin designed to commemorate NPC's Centennial. More than 200 guests attended the reception on Sunday, including parents, friends, Pi Phi collegians and LMU administration and faculty.\n\nLiving at California Nu\n\nLoyola Marymount University does not recognize official chapter houses, and therefore, California Nu does not have a facility. The chapter meets in lecture halls on campus for chapter meetings and official chapter business, which suits the chapter’s need for a large amount of space.\n\nThe California Nu Chapter has an “Angel Box,” which is passed around for members to put in affirmations or notes to other members. The Angel Box has been present since the beginning of California Nu. It is a small wooden box engraved with a small plaque that reads \"Angel Box, California Nu.\" These notes and affirmations are then read aloud by the President, Vice President of Member Development and Vice President Administration at the close of chapter. Normally, bigs and littles will congratulate each other on a job promotion, a great grade on a test or a significant life event. It is special for the whole chapter to hear wonderful news about other members!\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nAlpha Chi Omega, Alpha Phi, Delta Delta Delta, Delta Gamma, Delta Zeta, Kappa Alpha Theta and Pi Beta Phi\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nCurrently, the chapter has two main philanthropy events. Dodge the Arrow, held in the fall, is a dodgeball tournament with a twist — if and when you get out, you can get back into the game if you speed read a page from a Dr. Seuss® book! Arrowspike, held in the spring, is a large volleyball tournament held on Sunken Gardens, the largest community space on campus!\n\nNotable Alumnae\n\nLauren Froderman, winner of the 7th season of “So You Think You Can Dance.”\n\nInstalling Officer\n\nGrand President May Lansfield Keller, Maryland Alpha\n\nInstallation of California Gamma\n\nThis year, the California Gamma chapter celebrates the 100th anniversary of its founding in the summer of 1917. The origins of the chapter really began 22 years earlier, in 1895, when seven young women started planning a local sorority they would call Entre Nous. The group became an organized part of USC campus life in 1898. It had the distinction of being the oldest, by some five years, of the six sororities in the College of Liberal Arts. The aim of the Entre Nous founders was “to seal their friendships with a unity of purpose, to build up an organization which should prove an inspiration and a pleasure to all its members and to encourage scholarship and the highest standards of student life among the women of the university,” historical documents note. “It has been [the] purpose from the beginning.” A total of 43 charter members of Pi Beta Phi were initiated by Grand President May Lansfield Keller.\n\nThe Initiation Ceremony took place at the home of Indiana Beta Netta Nixon Young, President of the Los Angeles, California, Alumnae Club. The installation banquet that evening took the form of a reunion, with nearly 150 Pi Phis in attendance, including members of the San Diego, California, Alumnae Club and others living throughout Southern California.\n\nLiving at California Gamma\n\nThe California Gamma Chapter house is special because it was built by a Pi Phi’s husband; and therefore it was the only sorority house at the University of Southern California that was built for that function. There are 26 bedrooms with the ability of 64 women to live in 24 rooms. The other two rooms consist of room for the House Mom and the other is a guest room.\n\nOn the first floor in the living room there are two large mirrors, one wine and one blue, that face each other and constantly reflect wine and blue.\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nAlpha Chi Omega, Alpha Delta Chi, Alpha Delta Pi, Alpha Gamma Delta, Alpha Phi, Delta Delta Delta, Delta Gamma, Gamma Phi Beta, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Delta, Kappa Kappa Gamma and Pi Beta Phi\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nThe main charitable event is celebrating Read > Lead > Achieve®.\n\nNotable Alumnae\n\nJenna Dewan Tatum, actress\n\nAnn Marie “Ree” Smith Drummond, TV personality and chef\n\nMarilyn Horne\n\nHelena Dingle Moore\n\nCarolyn Helman Lichtenberg Crest Award Winners from California Gamma\n\nJoan Singleton Prestine (2002)\n\nMarilyn Horne (1995)\n\nInstalling Officers\n\nGrand President Emma Harper Turner, Indiana Alpha (1889); Grand President Emily Russell Tarr, Texas Beta (2007)\n\nInstallation of D.C. Alpha\n\nIndiana Alpha charter member, Emma Harper Turner enrolled in Columbian College and established the chapter. She installed the D.C. Alpha Chapter and became a charter member of it as well. The chapter was the first one installed as a chapter of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity; the previous chapters had been installed as chapters of I.C. Sorosis. Other charter members included Anna Hazelton, who would later write the Ritual, Lillian Hazelton, Phoebe Russell Norris, Augusta Pettigrew Shute and Sallie Sparks Eggleston. In 1968, the D.C. Alpha Chapter closed because of declining membership and an unfavorable Greek life climate. In addition, The George Washington University (GW) became less attractive to students due to protests and unrest in Washington during this time.\n\nIn the early 2000s, there was a big push to bring Pi Phi back to GW. There were alumnae in the D.C. area who were supportive of a reinstallation. The presentation team that worked to bring Pi Phi back to campus was headed by Grand President Emily Russell Tarr, Texas Beta. California Delta Karen Shelton Chevalier, current Alumnae Advisory Committee Chairman, was also on Grand Council at the time of reinstallation and played a major role.\\\n\nDuring recruitment, there was so much interest in Pi Phi’s new chapter, there was no problem meeting total. Total at the time was 85 members, including seniors; and all of the New Members were initiated. Recruitment took place on October two weeks after the formal Panhellenic recruitment was held. The chapter was installed in January. Virginia Epsilon at the University of Virginia assisted with recruitment. They came to the first party and to preference round. Colleen Briley (Dywalt), Kentucky Beta, was the Resident Leadership Development Consultant. The D.C. Alpha Chapter made a big impact on the campus as soon as it was colonized. Pi Phi had a virtual book drive across the entire country and D.C. Alpha placed first in that. The chapter was very active and involved on campus from day one. After the success Pi Phi had at GW, other urban chapters were installed at New York University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nD.C. Alpha’s reinstallation weekend was lovely. The Preparatory Ceremony took place in the Marvin Center. There was a huge Cookie Shine at E Street, the large room on the top floor. The Cookie Shine included a lot about the amazing history of D.C. Alpha, and there were several older D.C. Alphas alumnae who attended. The chapter was presented with the badges of some members. The installation was also held at the Westin hotel. Many local alumnae participated and made everything just perfect. Dr. Julie Freischlag was supposed to be the speaker, but she had a family emergency at the last minute. Former Grand President Sarah Ruth \"Sis\" Mullis, South, South Carolina Alpha, stepped in with 20 minutes’ notice and did a great job. The next day a model chapter meeting was held in the Marvin Center.\n\nLiving at D.C. Alpha\n\nD.C. Alpha’s home at Strong Hall is nestled between the corners of 21st and G Streets NW, right in the heart of the GW campus and also the exciting and vibrant atmosphere of downtown D.C. With 35 rooms and 54 residents, Pi Phi’s home in Strong has enabled entire New Member classes to live in the house and forge strong and lasting bonds of friendship and sisterhood with one another. Strong Hall itself is listed on the National Historic Register, and was one of the first dormitories on GW’s campus. Today, the building still honors the legacy of Hattie M. Strong, and serves as an all-girls dormitory for Pi Beta Phi and Chi Omega members, respectively.\n\nPerhaps the most wonderful aspect of Pi Beta Phi’s time in Strong Hall is the merging of the chapter’s rich and multi-layered history with that of the essence of Strong, and the years of memories that have been created throughout each space. The D.C. Alpha Chapter is proud to call Strong home, for with its historic halls and spaces, members have promulgated the continuation of the chapter’s history, present, and future, intertwined with the spirit of the founders, Hattie and The George Washington University.\n\nThroughout the years, Pi Phi’s home of Strong Hall has accumulated a number of interesting items that have a unique sense of history, culture and perspective on the essence of the chapter’s presence and legacy in time. One of the most favorite pieces is the collection of antique and commemorative pins on display in the dining room. Additionally, there is a cherished silver collection that lists D.C. Alpha’s awards of excellence throughout the years as well as an ornate and truly beautiful tray that was given in celebration of the re-colonization of the sisterhood on GW’s campus nearly a decade ago. Pi Beta Phi’s history at The George Washington University is an extensive one. Members are lucky to have items like these that remind them of the chapter’s unforgettable past, and maintain reverence and appreciation for those who came before them, as members seek to carve and delve further into the future.\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nAlpha Delta Pi, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Alpha Phi, Chi Omega, Kappa Delta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Phi Sigma Sigma, Pi Beta Phi, Sigma Delta Tau, Sigma Kappa\n\nPhilanthropic Events\n\nArrowstrike\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nArrowstrike is D.C. Alpha's annual fundraising week in the spring. The week is full of fun events that involve the fraternity and sorority community at large and aim to educate and fundraise for Pi Beta Phi Foundation. The events of the week vary from year to year, but a few events have stood the test of time and have become chapter favorites. The annual event, Pie a Pi Phi, is where community members can pay to throw a pie at their favorite Pi Phi! There is also an annual wiffle ball tournament, Arrowstrike, which traditionally happens on the last day of the festivities. In years past, other activities during the week have included pancake breakfasts, book drives, and food truck fundraisers!\n\nNotable Alumnae\n\nMargaret Truman Daniel, a collegian while her dad, Harry S.

Pi Phi guests were welcomed by University President, Dr. Lincoln Hulley, and his wife, Pennsylvania Beta Eloise Mayham Hulley. Installation activities took place at John B. Stetson University. This was the second installation of a Greek organization on campus and the first of a fraternity for women. Prior to the installation, the organization was a Stetson University society for women. When the group of women discovered Pi Beta Phi, they applied to become a chapter. Upon approval, 18 women were initiated and chartered the Florida Alpha Chapter of Pi Beta Phi. These women were Ruth Allen, Marie Dye, Fay Cribbett, Nina Phillips, Mabel Eldredge, Marguerite Blocker, June Loel Adams, Mary Ellen Keown, Lee Craig Bowers, Gladys Louis Sidway, Mildred La Verne Vorce, Annie Nadine Holden, Harriett Spratt Hulley, Louise Crisfield Hulley, Sarah Van Hoosen Jones, Mary Landes Buttorff, Lillian Wadsworth Eldredge, and Katherine Brice Carpenter. Harriett Hulley, one of the charter members, was the daughter of Lincoln Hulley, the playwright/poet and President of Stetson University at the time.\n\nLiving at Florida Alpha\n\nWhile the house is really an on-campus residence hall, it is still clearly the Pi Beta Phi house. The chapter room is full of sisters watching movies, doing homework, and eating dinner. Sixteen of the 112 sisters live in the eight bedrooms in the house. In 2016, the entire chapter room was renovated. The area received a fresh coat of paint, new tables and chairs and new décor, giving the chapter room a classy, contemporary look. Chapter members are extremely proud of these changes and are forever grateful for the everlasting memories created within the four walls of the Pi Phi house.\n\nThe Florida Alpha house was the first house created on “sorority row” at Stetson University. Thus, the groundbreaking shovel is in the chapter room. There is also a trophy case full of chapter awards from recent years, including the silver plate for Phi level in 2015 and awards from Stetson University’s Panhellenic community. In 2011, Florida Alpha won runner-up for the Balfour Cup. The vase is proudly displayed in the trophy case. For nine years, Florida Alpha has won the Christensen Cup, the intramural championship trophy, which sits on a stand in the TV room. Florida Alpha is extremely proud of its chapter’s accomplishments, and that pride is evident upon walking through the chapter room. Another interesting piece in the chapter room is the brand-new Cookie Shine plate that the 2016 graduating class gave the chapter as their senior gift. This plate is a beautiful silver plate that stands out in the chapter room. The Florida Alpha Chapter charter is prominently displayed on a wall in the chapter room, serving as a constant reminder of the shared values and dedication to the women who paved the way for Pi Beta Phi to be the first fraternity for women on campus.\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nAlpha Chi Omega, Alpha Xi Delta, Delta Delta Delta, Kappa Alpha Theta, Pi Beta Phi and Zeta Tau Alpha.\n\nPhilanthropic Events\n\nPie a Pi Phi, Arrow Week\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nFlorida Alpha has two main philanthropy events. This fall, the chapter held Pi Beta Battle, a capture the flag tournament raising money for the Fraternity’s philanthropy. At the event, food, T-shirts and pies to “Pie a Pi Phi” are also sold to raise money. In the spring, the chapter hosts Arrow Week, a Greek-wide competition week. This week includes a book drive, Pie a Pi Phi, a literacy talk by Dr. Shankar-Brown, a spelling bee and a fashion show. There is also Pi Phi Parlor, a late-night philanthropy event/ice cream social. These events have been extremely successful in not only raising money for Read > Lead > Achieve®, but in educating members of the fraternity and sorority and Stetson community about the importance of literacy.\n\nInstalling Officer\n\nGrand President Jean Wirths Scott, Pennsylvania Beta\n\nInstallation of Florida Epsilon\n\nThe chapter was installed on January 10, 1981. Installation activities took place at the First Presbyterian Church of Orlando. Special guest speakers at the installation banquet included Florida Beta Jean Curtis Yothers, Curator of the Orange County Historical Museum.\n\nLiving at Florida Epsilon\n\nThe Pi Beta Phi house at the University of Central Florida holds a very special place in its members’ hearts, especially since 2012 when it was named the “Little Blue Cottage.” It is one of the only houses on Greek Park that stands out with its bright baby blue color. Furthermore, the facility is noticeable due to its very large roof, which is supposed to one day become a second story. There are 39 women who live in 10 bedrooms with two sets of full-size bunk beds. Chapter members find the TV room to be one of the best rooms in the house due to its comfy rug, large TV and gift ledge. The TV room was an extension to the facility and is the location of very special bonding moments like watching “The Bachelor” or a place to leave a present for a sister.\n\nIn the TV room, there are rows of shelves called the “Gift Ledge.” The Gift Ledge is used for sisters to leave presents for other sisters. It used especially during big/little (before reveal) and year round for Guardian Angels to drop off gifts secretly. There is nothing quite like seeing the Gift Ledge full of Pi Phi love! The chapter also has a very special silver vase displaying the winners of the Carol Crockett Campus Involvement Award from 1986–1996. Finally, one of the most important items in the house is the stained glass that rests above the front door. The stained glass was donated by a chapter member Jennifer Pierce’s father, Warren. He designed and donated it to the chapter in honor of his daughter when the house was first built!\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nAlpha Delta Pi, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Alpha Xi Delta, Chi Omega, Delta Delta, Delta Zeta, Gamma Phi Beta, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Delta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Pi Beta Phi and Zeta Tau Alpha\n\nPhilanthropic Events\n\nPi Burger Phri and Color Me Literacy\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nFlorida Epsilon has two main philanthropy events, one per semester. Both of these events are relatively new, but have earned a lot of support from the fraternity and sorority and University of Central Florida’s (UCF) communities. Pi Burger Phri is the fall philanthropy event, and it is an all-you-can-eat burger, fries and pies event. The event is set up in the backyard with a huge white tent, tons of tables, lights, a stage and live music (even featuring a Florida Epsilon alumna). In the spring the chapter’s philanthropy event is Color Me Literacy. It is a color run around the UCF campus and has garnered a lot of support in last three years the chapter hosted it. Runners received a shirt and a packet of color powder, and the top three runners in each age group (male and female) receive a medal. The run ends with a “Color Party,” featuring a DJ and sisters throwing color powder all around the backyard. In 2016, the third Color Run raised $15,000 for Read > Lead > Achieve®!\n\nNotable Alumnae\n\nThe Florida Epsilon chapter values the connection to Pi Beta Phi history and therefore, it is notable that the chapter has two charter members, Barbi Stiles and Cindy Pajak, on AAC. These two women truly exemplify lifelong commitment both to Pi Beta Phi and their chapter.\n\nCarolyn Helman Lichtenberg Crest Award Winners from Florida Epsilon\n\nKautia Dawn Vaden Hampton (2007)\n\nInstalling Officer\n\nGrand Secretary Lulu Clark Ingraham, Virginia Alpha\n\nInstallation of Florida Beta\n\nA local group, Alpha Omega, was formed in 1913. The group officially became a chapter of Pi Beta Phi on October 14, 1921. The Initiation Ceremony took place at the Practice House, a model home supervised by the University’s home economics department. The installation banquet was held at the Leon Hotel in Tallahassee, Florida. Pi Phi songs were sung and toasts were performed.\n\nLiving at Florida Beta\n\nFlorida Beta’s chapter members are so fortunate to have their home. Commonly referred to as “the Beta” chapter members take every opportunity gather inside the house! The house is located at 519 West Jefferson Street in Tallahassee, Florida, right on Florida State University’s (FSU) campus. The house currently holds 47 women upstairs with a combination of quad rooms, double rooms and a single room for the Chapter President. Downstairs the House Director has her own suite located right by the dining room. Each year the chapter members are lucky to come back to a new renovation, which is always an amazing surprise. The home is made up of several large rooms downstairs that are prefect for hanging out in larger groups.\n\nOne of the chapter's most prized possessions in the Florida Beta Chapter facility is the guest room named after an amazing alumna, Maggie Allesse, who was FSU’s first cheerleader. The room is beautiful and such a nice part of the home. When chapter members have guests stay, it is so nice to share the home with them. Maggie generously donated the funds to furnish the guest room. The chapter is so happy to host her every year for homecoming!\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nAlpha Chi Omega, Alpha Delta Pi, Alpha Gamma Delta, Alpha Omicron Pi, Alpha Phi, Chi Omega, Delta Delta Delta, Delta Gamma, Delta Zeta, Gamma Phi Beta, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Delta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Phi Mu, Pi Beta Phi, Sigma Delta Tau and Zeta Tau Alpha\n\nPhilanthropic Events\n\nPi Burger Phri, All Fraternity Revue, Annual Chili Cook-off\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nEach year Florida Beta hosts several philanthropy events. In the fall the chapter hosts Pi Burger Phri, which is a dinner served outside the home. This brings the community together while sharing hamburgers, cheese burgers, corn dogs, French fries and Ms. Betty’s famous funnel fries. About a week after the dinner Florida Beta hosts another main philanthropy event, All Fraternity Revue, which is a line dance competition for the fraternities on campus. It is always a crowd favorite. The following semester, members come together outside the chapter home again for the Annual Chili Cook-off where different organizations on campus compete to win the best pot of chili award!\n\nNotable Alumnae\n\nFaye Dunaway\n\nTraylor Howard\n\nLeslie Sampson Waters\n\nNancy Kulp\n\nInstalling Officer\n\nGrand President Amy Burnham Onken, Illinois Epsilon\n\nInstallation of Georgia Alpha\n\nBeing impressed with the University of Georgia and the potential for growth, the 1938 Asheville Convention unanimously voted to establish Georgia Alpha. In September 1938, eight Pi Phi members transferred to the University to recruit and colonize the new chapter. The chapter was installed on February 4, 1939. Installation of Georgia Alpha took place at the Georgian Hotel, which is located just off campus in downtown Athens, Georgia. Many Pi Phi events, such as formal dances, are still held at the venue. The installation was held later that night at the Georgian. More than 50 Pi Phis from around the country were present for the event. Amy Burnham Onken gave a speech reminding the initiates of the work to be done to continue building the chapter. Awards and gifts were presented and the group sang Pi Phi songs.\n\nLiving at Georgia Alpha\n\nThe Georgia Alpha Chapter house is located at 886 South Milledge Avenue and affectionately referred to as “The 886.” It actually started out as a family home. It was owned by the Mortons, a well-known Athens family. Over the years it has been renovated and added onto to become the house it is today. The chapter facility is also special because it really is the central part of the sisterhood. From weekly chapter meetings, to hosting dinners on the lawn to raising money for philanthropy, the chapter house is where the sisterhood thrives. We house 58 women in two women rooms, three women rooms, four women rooms and five women rooms.\n\nA portrait of Winifred Smith Page, Colorado Beta/Wisconsin Alpha, hangs in the foyer. A great-niece of founder Inez Smith Soule, she was a notable Atlanta community leader instrumental in chartering Georgia Alpha. Winifred and her husband were among those lost in the 1962 plane crash in Orly, France. The Atlanta Memorial Arts Center was built from donations given in honor of those outstanding citizens.\n\nAnother interesting artifact is an angel figure which sat in an armoire in the living room. During a preference round ceremony in 1998, a candle caught the drapes in the living room on fire. Much of the house was badly burned. The armoire stood near the drapes, and almost everything inside of it was destroyed by the fire. The only thing that wasn’t touched by the fire was the angel figure inside the armoire.\n\nPanhellenic Chapters on Campus\n\nAlpha Chi Omega, Alpha Delta Pi, Alpha Gamma Delta, Alpha Omicron Pi, Chi Omega, Delta Delta Delta, Delta Gamma, Delta Zeta, Delta Phi Epsilon, Gamma Pi Beta, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Delta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Phi Mu, Pi Beta Phi, Sigma Delta Tau, Sigma Kappa and Zeta Tau Alpha\n\nPhilanthropic Event\n\nPi Phiesta\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nGeorgia Alpha hosts two large philanthropy events throughout the year. During the fall semester, the event is called “Pi Phiesta,” and features an all-you-can-eat taco buffet as well as live music from a local Athens band. The event is hosted on the front lawn and has become a very well-known and popular event around campus. The spring semester event changes every year. The most recent event was a skating night, called “Classic City Skate Night.” We rented out an ice skating rink in downtown Athens for an evening, and invited University of Georgia students, and members of the Athens community.\n\nNotable Alumnae\n\nLisa Masters​\n\nNotable Fact\n\nPi Beta Phi's founding chapter; Original I.C. chapter (Alpha)\n\nInstalling Officers\n\nFounders (1867) and Amy Burnham Onken, Illinois Epsilon (1928)\n\nInstallation of Illinois Alpha\n\nThe story of Illinois Alpha is the story of Pi Beta Phi. On April 28, 1867, ten young women gathered in the southwest second floor bedroom of Holt Houseand created I.C. Sorosis. Two of their friends couldn’t attend and agreed to abide by whatever the ten decided to do. They chose the arrow as their badge and they agreed to “conceal and never reveal” that the organization was founded in Monmouth. The organization grew despite the opposition from the college authorities. By the late 1870s the chapter was operating sub-rosa. At the 1884 convention, the chapter relinquished its charter.\n\nIn 1928, Amy Burnham Onken reinstalled the chapter. Five of the six living founders attended. Jennie Horne Turnbull could not make it, but Clara Brownlee Hutchinson, Inez Smith Soule, Margaret Campbell, Libbie Brook Gaddis and Fannie Whitenack Libbey were all in attendance.\n\nIllinois Gamma Minnie McDill McMichael, wife of the Monmouth College President, along with the townspeople, worked together to set up a great installation weekend. The ceremony took place at the home of the McMichaels. There, members of the local organization Zeta Epsilon Chi, both active and alumnae, were pledged to Pi Beta Phi. On Thursday, the initiation and installation ceremonies took place. Over the three days there were many banquets. On the first day a luncheon was prepared by Phi Delta Sigma and a breakfast was given by Kappa Alpha Sigma to promote Panhellenic spirit. After the Pledging Ceremony, there was a dinner held at the home of Iowa Alpha Adaline Ward Barnum by the Monmouth, Illinois, Alumnae Club. There the constitution was read and explained. Then, on Thursday after the initiation ceremony, there was a buffet luncheon served by the Zeta Epsilon Chi alumnae. That evening the new chapter held a formal banquet.\n\nLiving at Illinois Alpha\n\nFor decades, the chapter had a chapter room in Marshall Hall, where the sororities each had a room. In the early 2000s, the College furnished the chapter with a small house where some of the members could live and the chapter could congregate. In 2015, the son and daughter (Vicki Knapheide Wood, Arkansas Alpha) of Illinois Alpha Mary MacDill Knapheide made a $1.2 million donation to the College to provide the chapter with a new house. The house was completed in the early April 2016. A house dedication took place on April 28, 2016. At the house dedication, many alumnae returned to campus to tour the brand new house as well as see the graves of the founders at the Monmouth cemetery. The Pi Phis who attended the house dedication joined together and sang “Ring Ching” as one; it was a very unique and inspiring moment. The house includes a TV room, a formal living room, dining room, full kitchen, chapter room, craft room, multiple lounge areas, multiple bathrooms and an outdoor pavilion. There are around 15 women living in the house. Overall, the chapter members find themselves extremely blessed to be able to call this beautiful building home. The chapter is very thankful to all who have helped construct the house and worked on the project. Chapter members have already began making new memories in the house such as primary recruitment, sisterhood events, chapter meetings and big/little bonding activities.\n\nOverall, the entire house can be viewed as a museum containing a plethora of Pi Beta Phi history. However, there are three main focal points that really encompass Pi Beta Phi as well as make the house unique. In the casual TV room, there is an interactive history wall. On the history wall, one can look back to the very beginning of Pi Beta Phi. The history wall contains a timeline that starts with the Founders and ends with notable Pi Phi’s as well as covers all the history in-between. On the wall there is also an I.C. Sorosis badge as well as a copy of one of the early editions of The Arrow. However, the most unique part of the history wall is the interactive touch screen where one can learn more about the history of the chapter or look through past composite pictures. Outside the chapter room, there is a sisterhood wall as well as a values wall. The sisterhood wall displays pictures ranging from the very beginning of Pi Beta Phi (such as pictures at Holt House) and to more recent pictures (such as recruitment and the house dedication). On the values wall, there are pictures of the chapter’s sisters embodying the values of Pi Beta Phi. The wall also includes the mission and vision statements of Pi Beta Phi.\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nAlpha Xi Delta, Kappa Kappa Gamma and Pi Beta Phi\n\nPhilanthropic Event\n\nChampions Are Readers® (CAR)\n\nNotable Alumnae\n\nEvelyn Peters Kyle, Pi Phi’s Poet Laureate\n\nMary MacDill Knapheide\n\nCarolyn Helman Lichtenberg Crest Award Winners from Illinois Alpha\n\nTiffany Mekshes Cole (2002)\n\nGrand Council Members from Illinois Alpha\n\nEvelyn Peters Kyle\n\nInstalling Officers\n\nGrand President Grace Lass Sisson, Illinois Delta and Jessie Davidson, Illinois Delta\n\nInstallation of Illinois Zeta\n\nThe chapter was installed on October 26, 1895. Initiation took place at the home of Nellie Lapham Swigart, Illinois Beta, on South Neil Street. Following initiation, an elegant banquet was given by Mrs. Swigart. The house was decorated in wine and silver blue, and with wine carnations. After the banquet, the members held their first Cookie Shine. The charter members were Amelia Darling Alpiner (Stern), Edith Marie Weaver (Gilhulely), Blanche C. Lindsay (Wood), Martha Vivian Monier (Morissy), Laura E. Busey (Fulton), Nellie Besore (Sears), Edith M. Yoemans, Anne B. Montgomery (Bahnsen) and Lelia White. The charter members are memorialized in the Vabelman Award given out each year. The name of the award was created from the first letters of the names of the charter members.\n\nLiving at Illinois Zeta\n\nThe Illinois Zeta Chapter house can be home to 63 collegiate members. Recently, house interior was redone, which makes the prospect of living in exciting for many. The chapter has the largest house parking lot of any sorority on campus. In addition to the main house, there is also an annex house lovingly referred to as “Little Pi Phi,” where members can live in singles or doubles in a more intimate atmosphere.\n\nThe Illinois Zeta Chapter house is one of the oldest on campus. It has many beautiful antique features, including the stained glass windows, a large gold mirror and a watercolor painting in the front television room. There are stained glass windows lining the front facing doors of the house, some dating back to 1895, while others have been redone in the past and are marked with their year (1995). The chapter house’s stained glass windows incorporate the crest of Pi Beta Phi as well as various colors and shapes. The gigantic, gold-painted mirror sits on the landing to greet members as they enter up the stairs. The mirror runs from the carpet to the ceiling, nearly nine feet tall and four feet wide. The water color painting of the chapter house is a lovely feature and was donated by the 1989 pledge class.\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nAlpha Chi Omega, Alpha Delta Pi, Alpha Gamma Delta, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Alpha Gamma Delta, Alpha Omicron Pi, Alpha Phi, Alpha Xi Delta, Chi Omega, Delta Delta Delta, Delta Gamma, Delta Zeta, Gamma Phi Beta, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Delta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Pi Beta Phi, Phi Mu, Phi Sigma Sigma and Sigma Delta Tau\n\nPhilanthropic Events\n\nPi Phi Sugar High, ArrowGames, Pi Burger Phri, Pi Beta Spike and Lemonade for Literacy\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nThe Illinois Zeta chapter holds a series of philanthropy events throughout the school year. Money is raised for Read > Lead > Achieve® through Pi Phi Sugar High, an ice cream social in the fall, and ArrowGames, a flag football tournament for fraternity men. Pi Burger Phri, a cookout, and Pi Beta Spike, a sand volleyball tournament, take place at the house in the spring. The chapter also coordinates Lemonade for Literacy, a lemonade stand outside their house, whenever weather permits.\n\nNotable Alumnae\n\nRobin Baumgarten, news anchor from WGN Morning News in Chicago\n\nAmelia Alpiner Stern, one of the first Jewish students to attend the University of Illinois and founder of the Mom's Day/Weekend tradition at Illinois Zeta\n\nHarriet Haycock Brown, author who wrote “Ocean to Ocean”\n\nGrand Council Members from Illinois Zeta\n\nAlison Veit Heafitz\n\nAmelia Alpiner Stern\n\nBarbara Sands Olsen\n\nLois Franklin Stoolman\n\nFay Martin Gross\n\nInstalling Officer\n\nGrand President May Lansfield Keller, Maryland Alpha\n\nInstallation of Illinois Eta\n\nA local group, Delta Theta Psi, was formed in 1904. The group officially became a chapter of Pi Beta Phi on March 29, 1912. There were a number of women who petitioned to install Delta Theta Psi, a local organization, as a chapter of Pi Beta Phi. These women included Pearl Tippett, Irene Handlin, Esther Starr, Grade Lorraine Thift, Florence Sarah Page, Lucille Logan, Edith Ward Bower, Lucy Curtis, Jessie Elizabeth Patterson, Lois Scott, Norma Louise Council, Lois Brown, Mabel Edmonson, Marie Scott, Helen Page, Margaret Hessler, Helen Keeley, Eula Mason, Ann Stoker, Virginia Bower, Irma Nicholson, Helen Roby and Fannie Johnson.\n\nGrand President May Lansfield Keller, Maryland Alpha, performed the Initiation Ceremony for these women. There were 12 chapters of Pi Phis represented at the ceremony. Illinois Eta was the first of national women’s fraternity on Millikin’s campus. Installation took place in the home of Maryland Alpha Caroline Lutz. It was reported, “The house was an ideal one for the purpose and the local Pi Phis had introduced a few unusual features in decoration and concluding ceremony, which added an especial charm to the initiation.”\n\nAt chapel, which some of the visiting Pi Phis attended, the College President announced the establishment of the first women’s fraternity on campus. He then suggested that the student body rise and sing the college song in Illinois Eta’s honor. The President and his wife, a chapter Patroness, hosted an open house at their home to honor the chapter.\n\nThe “First Annual” dance announced the installation. Pi Phi colors and carnations provided the decorations. The following afternoon Adele Blackstone hosted the Pi Phis; her sister Marguerite Blackstone, Illinois Zeta, had helped the chapter secure the charter, but was not in town for the installation festivities.\n\nLiving at Illinois Eta\n\nThe Illinois Eta Chapter house sleeps 40 women. There are 13 bedrooms and many great common areas. Each room in the house has a specific name — bedrooms and common areas. Even with the renovations that have occurred over the years, these names have all stayed the same.\n\nThe archival closet contains a lot of chapter history and antique books such as a few books from the Delta Theta Psi chapter (before being installed as a Pi Beta Phi chapter). There are original signatures and pictures of each founding woman. There are many old scrapbook and old pictures that date back to the late 1920s. Everything that is important to the chapter stays in the archives.\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nChi Omega, Delta Delta Delta and Pi Beta Phi\n\nPhilanthropic Event\n\nGreen Eggs and Ham\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nGreen Eggs and Ham, which occurs in the spring, is Illinois Eta's main philanthropy event. This fundraiser takes place in the chapter house where members sell breakfast food. There are usually speed reads for entertainment, a children’s book donation bin and presale tickets.\n\nNotable Alumnae\n\nKatelyn Epperly, Season 9 American Idol contestant\n\nGrand Council Members from Illinois Eta\n\nMary Elizabeth Frushour Hill\n\nInstalling Officer\n\nGrand President Amy Burnham Onken, Illinois Epsilon\n\nInstallation of Indiana Epsilon\n\nA local group, Pi Phi Epsilon, was formed in 1941. The group officially became a chapter of Pi Beta Phi on September 1, 1942. The ceremonies began in the room in which the third national convention of Pi Beta Phi was held in 1872, when DePauw University was called Indiana Asbury University. The Pledging Ceremony, conducted by Marianne Reid Wild, was followed by a Cookie Shine at the new chapter house in the afternoon. The next day, the first New Member class was initiated at Gobin Memorial Church, DePauw’s campus church. There were 33 members who received their shining new arrows. A formal banquet was held that night in the large dining room of Mason Hall, which was then the newest residence hall on campus.\n\nLiving at Indiana Epsilon\n\nThe Indiana Epsilon Chapter house has 27 rooms housing 70 women. The chapter house carries on the tradition of painting an arrow on one of the cement blocks in the stairwell after a member graduates. Big sisters have a tradition of painting a step ladder for their little that includes traditions such as symbols or quotes. The swings on the front porch are a favorite; countless hours are spent studying, talking or relaxing on them, and it is the location for thousands of pictures. The chapter house truly wouldn’t be the same without the porch swings.\n\nIn the formal living room there is a beautiful, large grandfather clock that was donated by the Mother's Club in 1967. It rings at random intervals and is quite loud, yet the members cherish it all the same.\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nAlpha Chi Omega, Alpha Phi, Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma and Pi Beta Phi.\n\nPhilanthropic Event\n\nPi Burger Phri and Pie a Pi Phi\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nThe Indiana Epsilon chapter holds many philanthropy events throughout the year, but the most successful event is called Pi Burger Phri, which is held at the end of October every year. A barbeque is set up behind the chapter house with music and games, including “Pie a Pi Phi” where people can pay to throw a pie in a Pi Phi’s face. Prior to the event, members sell Pi Burger Phri T-shirts, where a percentage of the proceeds go directly to Read > Lead > Achieve®.\n\nCarolyn Helman Lichtenberg Crest Award Winner from Indiana Epsilon\n\nNancy Ford (1991)\n\nInstalling Officer\n\nElizabeth Middleton, Indiana Alpha\n\nInstallation of Indiana Beta\n\nThe chapter was installed on April 13, 1893. Indiana Beta was organized by Elizabeth Middleton, Indiana Alpha, and chartered by the following members: Elizabeth Middleton, Jessie Traylor (Grimes), Delia Evelyn Mount (Wooden), Laura Rogers Grimes (Anderson), Eleanor Pearl Grimes (Wright), Blanche McLaughlin, Edna Earl Stewart and Carrie Bell Burner. Installation took place at the Henry Springer House in Bloomington, Indiana. There was an informal installation banquet held at the Springer House as well. The women had a Cookie Shine and ate ham sandwiches, pickles, potato salad, deviled eggs and cookies.\n\nLiving at Indiana Beta\n\nThe Indiana Beta Chapter house is a special one. The house is one of the oldest on campus and has a very classy, yet welcoming, feel to it. There have been recent renovations to the foyer to make it elegant and new but still match Pi Phi style. The chapter house is also special because it has a “cold dorm” system where members share “day rooms” with roommates, which include a desk, dresser, futon and closets. Members sleep in dorms upstairs. This is nice because the dorms are always dark, quiet and perfect for when members want to go to bed early or later than other roommates. This also allows more women to be able to live in the house. There are more than 100 women who currently live in the house. There are 42 “day rooms” in the house with two to three women in each depending on the size of the room. Some of the bigger rooms in the house hold four women. Chapter members appreciate the opportunity to live with this many women and get to know everyone on such a personal level.\n\nThe pictures that hang in the living room offer visitors a glimpse into the history of the chapter. Nikkita Chawla recently donated a wine colored shadow box containing arrow pins, angel pins and other cute items associated with Pi Phi. In addition, certain rooms in the house have been donated by Indiana Betas and there are plaques to identify the donors.\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nAlpha Chi Omega, Alpha Delta Pi, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Alpha Gamma Delta, Alpha Omicron Pi, Alpha Phi, Alpha Sigma Alpha, Alpha Xi Delta, Chi Omega, Delta Gamma, Delta Phi Epsilon, Delta Zeta, Gamma Phi Beta, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Delta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Phi Mu, Pi Beta Phi, Sigma Delta Tau, Sigma Kappa, Theta Phi Alpha and Zeta Tau Alpha\n\nPhilanthropic Events\n\nPi Burger Phri and Angels in the Outfield\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nIndiana Beta has two main philanthropies a year. Burgers and fries are served at the first event, Pi Burger Phi, which supports Read > Lead > Achieve®. It is a great night bringing the Indiana University community together. The second event is Angels in the Outfield, which is a softball tournament where members raise money to support cystic fibrosis. This philanthropy is near and dear to members’ hearts because two chapter members have been directly affected by this disease.\n\nCarolyn Helman Lichtenberg Crest Award Winner from Indiana Beta\n\nPatricia Root Bash (1993)\n\nInstalling Officer\n\nGrand President Marianne Reid Wild, Kansas Alpha\n\nInstallation of Indiana Zeta\n\nA local group, Gamma Gamma, was formed in 1920. The group officially became a chapter of Pi Beta Phi on August 23, 1952. At the time of the chapter’s installation, the University was called Ball State Teacher’s College. It was the first Pi Beta Phi to be installed on a teacher’s college campus after the Association of Education Sororities became part of the National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), a process that began when Illinois Epsilon Amy Burnham Onken, chaired NPC.\n\nThe Installation Ceremony took place in the Arts Building on campus. There was an installation banquet after the event at the Delaware Country Club. The theme was “Royal Gems of Pi Phi” and three women spoke before singing Pi Phi songs.\n\nLiving at Indiana Zeta\n\nThe Indiana Zeta Chapter does not have a house. However, recently construction began on a sorority “village,” and it is to open in the fall of 2018. This chapter house will house 28 members. Currently, the chapter has a suite located on the fourth floor of Ball State’s all-female residence hall. It is a relatively small space, but it has a small kitchenette, a large ritual closet and an open area with couches for Pi Phis to study, meet, socialize and relax. While it is a struggle to fit even one New Member class in the suite due to chapter size, it is a great place to hold Leading with Values® workshops, sisterhoods, Policy and Standards Board meetings, study sessions and other smaller gatherings. Curious Pi Phis can also rummage through the closets to find lots of chapter history and memorabilia from past Pi Phis, including chapter minutes, awards, letters, manuals, scrapbooks, newspaper articles, newsletters and so much more.\n\nThere is not a lot of room in the suite to display many items; however, there is a beautiful silver platter donated by an alumna that is proudly displayed. Chapter members also love the book used for pledging signatures, which is the same one the Indiana Zeta founders used. Members can flip through and see the names of every Indiana Zeta who ever pledged to the Fraternity. One of the chapter’s beloved current Alumnae Advisory Committee members was a founding member of the chapter in 1952. It is special to look in the book and see her name on the very first page. It is also very special when she visits and shares stories about what the University and Pi Phi were like when she was a student.\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nAlpha Chi Omega, Alpha Gamma Delta, Alpha Omicron Pi, Alpha Phi, Chi Omega, Delta Zeta, Kappa Delta, Sigma Kappa, Pi Beta Phi and Phi Mu\n\nPhilanthropy Event\n\nPaint Warz\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nThe chapter’s most recognized philanthropic event is called Paint Warz. It typically occurs in September. The chapter has paired with fraternities in the past and has also completed it alone. This event is a hit because every game involves getting messy with paint in one way or another. Students (Greek and non-Greek alike) love it. Events include a tug-of-war, an obstacle course, messy paint Twister, paint dodge ball and several other exciting games students look forward to every year. The participant turnout increases every year, and the chapters are also honored to help Phi Delta Theta support their national philanthropy, the ALS Association.\n\nNotable Alumnae\n\nChristine Dobbyn, a news anchor who received the Radio & Television Director Association Award for Young Journalists in 1997 and a regional Emmy award in 2004\n\nCarolyn Helman Lichtenberg Crest Award Winners from Indiana Zeta\n\nJudith Summers McCollum (2008)\n\nGrand Council Members of Indiana Zeta\n\nJulie Pratt Simmons\n\nLucy Baker Warner\n\nInstalling Officer\n\nGrand President Grace Lass Sisson, Illinois Delta\n\nInstallation of Indiana Gamma\n\nThe Indiana Gamma chapter was an outgrowth of a local organization in existence at Butler University as early as 1894. It was organized through the effortd of Indiana Beta Bertha Holland. Pi Beta Phi was the third Greek letter sorority at Butler after Kappa Alpha Theta and Kappa Kappa Gamma.\n\nOn the evening of November 19, 1894, six women met at the Delta Tau Delta house on campus and organized a local fraternity. They drew up and signed a short constitution. A few days later, they met again at the house of one of the women, where the name Alpha Phi Psi was chosen, the constitution enlarged and the colors of crimson and light blue were chosen.\n\nIn the winter of the third year, 1896, with only five active members, plans were started for obtaining a national charter. After careful consideration of existing women’s fraternities, Pi Beta Phi was chosen on April 12th. At the end of May, a letter was received from pi Beta Phi’s Grand Secretary stating the charter would be granted in a few days. Less than two weeks later, another letter was received from the Grand Treasurer, who had voted against the charter because she felt that Butler was too small in enrollment and size. Without a unanimous vote of Grand Council, a charter would not be granted.\n\nAlpha Phi Psi decided to appeal to Pi Beta Phi’s Convention, which was being held that summer in Madison, Wisconsin. Ethel Boor (Roberts) was chosen to go to the convention at their representative. The Grand Treasurer did everything to discourage the establishment of a Pi Beta Phi chapter at Butler University, but with the help of Professor Sober of Wisconsin, the charter was granted July 18, 1897. The charter included the condition that if at the end of three years, the standard of the university had declined, the charter would be withdrawn.\n\nInstallation of the Indiana Gamma Chapter of Pi Beta Phi was August 27, 1897. There was a banquet that followed the Installation Ceremony at Annie and Mary McCollum’s home. After the banquet, Grand President Grace Lass Sisson gave an informal speech. The charter members were Mabel Gertrude Hauk, Edith Boor Roberts (Loop), Ethel R. Curryer, Annie Mercer McCollum, Olive Inez Phares (Tittsworth), Jessie Lanier Christian (Brown), Emily Matilda Helming, Elizabeth Moxon Banning, Annette Maybelle Seeley, Mary Gertrude McCollum (Moorhead) and Marietta Lamb Thompson (Sprague).\n\nLiving at Indiana Gamma\n\nThe Indiana Gamma Chapter house is home to 50 collegiate members each year. Indiana Gamma’s house is known for its beautiful white exterior with its bright red door. One of the most unique attributes to the house is the option to live either in a more intimate double dorm room or in a large cold dorm (sleeping porch).\n\nThe Indiana Gamma Chapter house is about to celebrate its 120th anniversary. Since its start as a large family home, it has undergone an addition and many renovations to make it into a place 50 members can call home. Its original character is still present in the “old” side of the house, while the “new” side of the house is more modern. Some of its most notable features include a family tree painting with pictures of each of the chapter's family branches and the house's large outdoor porch. The family tree, a newer addition to the house, is a large painting to the left of the staircase that helps showcase sisterly bonds. The large outdoor porch has large, white Greek style pillars. The porch has many uses including social events, philanthropy events, and a place for sisters to study. Off of the porch, large banners will fly in support of events occurring on campus.\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nAlpha Chi Omega, Alpha Phi, Delta Delta Delta, Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma and Pi Beta Phi\n\nPhilanthropic Event\n\nWings of an Angel\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nWings of an Angel is Indiana Gamma’s fall philanthropy event where the chapter members sell chicken wings and veggies.\n\nNotable Alumnae\n\nDonna Burgard received the Evelyn Peters Kyle Angel Award for Club Service in 2010\n\nMadge Oberhotlzer, whose death and the subsequent murder trial contributed to taking down the Indiana chapter of the Ku Klux Klan\n\nCarolyn Helman Lichtenberg Crest Award Winners from Indiana Gamma\n\nLeslie King (2015)\n\nGrand Council Members from Indiana Gamma\n\nBetty Blades Lofton\n\nNotable Fact\n\nOriginal I.C. chapter (Lambda)\n\nInstalling Officer\n\nEstella Walters Ball, Iowa Alpha\n\nInstallation of Iowa Beta\n\nIn a letter Ida Cheshire Barker wrote to the Iowa Beta Chapter in 1940, she recalled the beginnings of the chapter, \"I was fifteen when I received the letter from Anna Porter of Monmouth asking me to get together other young ladies and organize a chapter of the fraternity. It was S. L. Lindsay who had gone from Indianola to Monmouth, who gave my name to Anna Porter.\"\n\nAnna Porter wrote to Ida, in part, “You will no doubt be surprised at receiving a letter from a person you never heard of before, but I trust we will be very well acquainted before long. Your name has been handed to me with several other ladies, as among the first class of Indianola, and as we are desirous of starting a chapter of the fraternity in your college, to me was given the privilege of writing ... [The fraternity] is an old fraternity and we always try and have the No. 1 ladies of the college ... We only take in the girls we can love, not only as friends, but as sisters. \"\n\nIda talked to \"her best friend,\" who later became her sister-in-law, Kate Barker (McCune) and the two along with eight other girls — Nell Todhunter (Richey), Estella Walters (Ball), Emma Patton (Noble), Louise Noble (Curtis), Bessie Guyer (Linn), Marie Morrison (Samson), Fannie Andrew (Noble) and Elizabeth Cooke (Martin) — met and organized in the Cheshire house the first woman's national fraternity on Simpson's campus. The Minute Book of Iowa Beta, containing the minutes of the first meeting of the chapter, is the earliest minute book known to be in existence in the fraternity. The members borrowed $20.00 from the bank to buy their pins, large golden arrows, for $3.00 each and a bolt of cloth to make long gingham aprons which they wore to chapel, attending as a group, wearing their arrows for the first time. The installation ceremony took place in the bedroom of Ida Cheshire (Barker).\n\nIowa Gamma Carrie Chapman Catt, an American women's suffrage leader, came to Indianola to speak at a lecture promoted by Iowa Beta.\n\nLiving at Iowa Beta\n\nIn 1927, the Schee home was bought for a Pi Phi house through the efforts of Sarah Eikenberry Sigler. The house has undergone many transformations in the last eight decades.\n\nNotable Alumnae\n\nJuli Holmes Willeman, current Executive Director of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity\n\nPhylliss Hickman Howlett, Former Assistant Commissioner of the Big 10 Intercollegiate Conference\n\nRosemary Lane, Actress from the 1930s\n\nEugenia Moore Anderson, the first Woman Ambassador to Denmark and the First Woman Minister to Bulgaria\n\nRuth Buxton Sayre, Iowa Women's Hall of Fame\n\nNotable Fact\n\nOriginal I.C. chapter (Kappa)\n\nInstallation of Kansas Alpha\n\nThe chapter was installed on April 1, 1873 as Kappa of I.C. Sorosis. The chapter was established through the influence of Illinois Beta Sara Richardson, who spent the summer of 1872 at home in Lawrence, Kansas. Three of her sisters — Flora Richardson (Coleman), May Richarson and Alma Richardson (Wallace), who later became charter members — were attending the University. It was at the first party given by the chapter, to honor Sara, that the Cookie Shine took on its name and place in Pi Beta Phi.\n\nLiving at Kansas Alpha\n\nKansas Alpha was the first chapter to be installed at the University of Kansas. The Arrow magazine was also founded at Kansas Alpha and the chapter published the first edition. There is a grand history to everything that makes Kansas Alpha so special, including the Cookie Shine. The Cookie Shine was a tradition started at Kansas Alpha.\n\nThe chapter house is special because the amount of women who receive the chance to live in. Currently 87 women live in the facility. There are 30 bedrooms ranging in sizes from two to eight beds. What makes the Kansas Alpha Chapter house so great is the wonderful alumnae who have donated and supported the house throughout the years. In the fall of 2017, a beautiful garden was added to the side of the house, due to the generosity of alumnae. The garden will be great on nice fall and spring days to go outside and study or entertain. This is just one example of their support. Each room in the house is named after an alumna who served in some way to help Kansas Alpha. Walking down each flight of stairs you will see plaques with lists of notable alumnae who have donated to or received awards within Pi Phi.\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nAlpha Chi Omega, Alpha Delta Pi, Alpha Gamma Delta, Chi Omega, Delta Delta Delta, Delta Gamma, Gamma Phi Beta, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Delta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Pi Beta Phi and Sigma Kappa.\n\nPhilanthropic Events\n\nPie a Pi Phi and Hoops for Haley\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nThe Kansas Alpha Chapter has two philanthropy events, one for each semester. In the fall semester, the event is “Pie a Pi Phi.” Pie a Pi Phi is held on campus so students can walk up anytime during the day and throw a “pie” in a Pi Phi’s face for $2. All of the money raised goes to Read > Lead > Achieve®. Recently, the chapter added a new philanthropy event “Hoops for Haley,” in honor of sister Haley Drown who passed away in the summer of 2015. For this event, each fraternity on campus can create a basketball team to play in a basketball tournament. This is a huge event for Kansas Alpha, because all of the proceeds go to the Ali Kemp Foundation as decided by Haley Drown’s family.\n\nNotable Alumnae\n\nDr. Leona Baumgartner, Scientist.

Pi Kappa Phi first began to petition Pi Beta Phi in 1911, and by 1915 it was confirmed that this society of women would integrate into Pi Beta Phi. The original petition of signatures is hanging in the chapter’s living room.\n\nThe installation banquet for the Kansas Beta Chapter occurred at Carnegie Library in Manhattan, Kansas; 23 women were initiated in the first New Member class of Pi Beta Phi. The first official chapter meeting was held on June 5, 1915. The ritual was recited and the newly founded chapter elected its first slate of officers.\n\nLiving at Kansas Beta\n\nThe Kansas Beta Chapter house was specifically built for the Kansas Beta in 1963. Along with the unique story each chapter member contributes, there are physical attributes to the chapter house that remind members of how special the home is. In the foyer staircase, there are arrows lining the railing, and the light fixtures give off the reflection of angel wings onto the wall. Recently, the chapter house was expanded. The alumnae took charge of the fundraising and planning, and the collegiate members feel lucky to have alumnae so willing to continue to make the chapter home unique.\n\nThe addition includes an entire expansion that will add on space to the chapter room, dining room and add two additional living suites on second and third floor. Currently, the house has a capacity of 84 women, which allows all sophomores and many juniors to experience living in their home away from home. One special room in the house is the second floor living area called the “smoker.” Back in the 1960s and 1970s, this balcony room was where members smoked. Obviously smoking is prohibited in the house currently, but the name has stuck, and members continue to use this comfortable living area as a hangout room for movies and homework. One fun tradition members still continue to do is date sendoffs. The chapter has a balcony overlooking the front walkway of the house, and any time one of the members is being picked up for a date, members flood the balcony and scream and send them off.\n\nOne unique item that is displayed in the chapter house is a mosaic setting of the Pi Beta Phi coat of arms. This mosaic was handmade by a Kansas Beta alumna and is very special to us. This coat of arms is presented in the front staircase to show off to guests and alumnae. The chapter house also displays the Balfour Cup, which was retired in 2001 at Kansas Beta. The chapter won the Balfour Cup three years in a row (1999, 2000 and 2001), which caused allowed the chapter to retire it into the living room showcase. The living room is also lined with the original documents that were published during the installation of the Pi Beta Phi chapter at Kansas State University. These documents and photos give chapter members a glimpse into the past of the founding.\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nAlpha Chi Omega, Alpha Delta Pi, Delta Delta Delta, Kappa Gamma and Pi Beta Phi\n\nPhilanthropic Events\n\nPi Burger Phry and Ali Kemp Bandstand\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nKansas Beta participates in Pi Burger Phry and Ali Kemp Bandstand. Pie Burger Phry made its debut in spring 2016. The event took place at a large pavilion in the local city park. The ticket price included a meal from a local food truck vendor, for a few extra dollars, one could “Pie-A-Pi-Phi” of one's choice in the face! All proceeds of the event went to Read > Lead > Achieve®. In the fall of 2016, Kansas Beta hosted its 13th annual Ali Kemp Bandstand in honor of one of fellow sister Ali Kemp. Ali Kemp was a Kansas Beta whose life was taken after her freshman year at Kansas State. Her father, Roger Kemp, founded The Ali Kemp Educational Foundation, or T.A.K.E. Foundation. The organization hosts self-defense classes all over the country. And Kansas Beta hosts a class for free for all women on the community before Ali Kemp Bandstand. Ali Kemp Bandstand is a concert featuring a local artist and all proceeds benefit The Ali Kemp Educational Foundation as well as Read > Lead > Achieve®.\n\nNotable Alumnae\n\nFrances Allison Weaver, Senior editor for the \"Today Show.\" Author of \"I'm Not As Old As I Used to be,\" among others, and lecturer\n\nHelen Eakin Eisenhower, Instrumental in founding Pennsylvania Epsilon\n\nCarolyn Helman Lichtenberg Crest Award Winners from Kansas Beta\n\nChris Giza (2015)\n\nKaren Milner Graves (1998)\n\nFrances Allison Weaver (1997)\n\nBalfour Cup Winner - 2018\n\nGrand Council Members from Kansas Beta\n\nMarla Neelly Wulf\n\nCynthia Rice Svec\n\nInstalling Officer\n\nGrand President Amy Burnham Onken, Illinois Epsilon\n\nInstallation of Kentucky Alpha\n\nA local group, Tri Xi, was formed in 1921. The name was chosen because it rhymed with Pi Phi, whose charter was the goal. The group officially became a chapter of Pi Beta Phi on October 9, 1925. The Initiation Ceremony took place at the home of Ontario Alpha Emma Woerner, a 1925 Lake of Bays Convention initiate. The Installation Banquet took place in the Red Room of the Seelbach Hotel. The general plan of the program was that of the ship Tri Xi arriving at the port of Pi Beta Phi, carried out in detail through place cards, decorations and more.\n\nLiving at Kentucky Alpha\n\nThe Kentucky Alpha Chapter does not have a traditional house. The chapter has a suite in a residence hall on campus that members enjoy using. It has a chapter room, TV room, kitchen, a large front porch, two bathrooms as well as various offices and storage spaces. It is very convenient, and it is used for various meetings, practices and initiation.\n\nBefore the residence hall was built in the early 2000s, the chapter had a house on Greek Row. It sat across the street from the suite and there are several items that were carried over from the old house to the current space. The main double doors between the TV room and the chapter room contain two panels of stained glass that were salvaged from doors within the old house. Kentucky Alpha has been on University of Louisville’s campus for nearly 100 years and has had many spaces even before the house on Greek Row and the current suite. In the TV room there is a piece of art for each past location the chapter members have used next to a large wooden carving of the crest that has been with the chapter for many years.\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nAlpha Omicron Pi, Chi Omega, Delta Zeta, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Delta, Pi Beta Phi, Sigma Kappa and Zeta Tau Alpha.\n\nPhilanthropic Events\n\nBingo for Books and Hoops for Halos\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nMiniature golf competitions, wing-eating contests, Bingo for Books and Hoops for Halos are all philanthropic events that Kentucky Alpha hosts.

On Saturday morning, November 20, Grand President Mary Loy Tatum, Oklahoma Beta, initiated 61 New Members, including one legacy and five alumna initiates. Before installation activities began, every New Member was given a pink flower. She then shared her favorite Pi Phi memory and added her flower to a bouquet. That flower arrangement was present at all installation events, representing the diversity of the group. The Initiation Ceremony took place at the Doubletree Inn at The Colonnade. The installation banquet was held at The Glass Pavilion on the Homewood campus. The charter was received at convention in Orlando, Florida, in 2011.\n\nLiving at Maryland Gamma\n\nAt Johns Hopkins University, the fraternity and sorority communities do not live in houses, but that doesn’t impact the sisterhood Maryland Gamma shares! Weekly chapter meetings are held on or around campus. Maryland Gamma occupies a storage unit which is maintained and operated from Pi Beta Phi Headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri, by the Fraternity Housing Corporation (FHC).\n\nEven though Maryland Gamma does not have a house, there is a tradition. After women are initiated, the women sign the tapestry on which they sit during a Cookie Shine. Usually women sign near their big’s name so that family clusters are visible throughout the tapestry\n\nThe chapter also has a “loving cup” that was given to the chapter from Maryland Beta’s Sally Hueble Moran. The cup says “Pi Beta Phi Maryland Beta June 17th 1944, 1959”. Even though the Loving Cup Ceremony is no longer a Pi Phi ceremony, Maryland Gamma members like having a piece of Pi Phi history as part of the chapter.\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nAlpha Phi, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Phi Mu and Pi Beta Phi\n\nPhilanthropic Events\n\nPi Phi Gives You Wings and Pie a Pi Phi\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nThe chapter’s fall philanthropy event is “Pi Phi Gives You Wings” for which members sell tickets to students to come and eat an assortment of chicken wings. Maryland Gammas also host a wing eating contest with a representative from each of the fraternities, sororities and sporting teams, so all of their friends come to cheer them on (and enjoy wings themselves).\n\nThe spring philanthropy event is “Pie a Pi Phi” during Hopkins’ Spring Fair weekend. At America’s largest student-run weekend festival, thousands of people come through campus to enjoy food, carnival rides, vendors and activities hosted by student groups. Visitors can make a donation to “Pie a Pi Phi” with whipped cream.\n\nInstalling Officer\n\nJennie Colegrove, Illinois Beta\n\nInstallation of Michigan Alpha\n\nIn the spring of 1887 the presidents of Alpha Kappa Phi and Germanae Sodales, brother and sister literary societies, were James E. Davidson and Minta Morgan, respectively. When James heard from Minta that a second women’s fraternity was being contemplated at Hillsdale, he suggested petitioning I.C. Sorosis. As early as September 1881, the college had been on the I.C.'s radar as a place of possible extension, so the petition was granted at once by the Grand Officers.\n\nOn May 21, 1887, Minta Morgan, May Copeland, Anna Burgoyne, Josephine Graham, Belle Armstrong, Carrie Charles and Myra Browne gathered at the Adams house, 73 West Street South, the home of Minta’s grandfather, Strickland Adams and the Michigan Alpha Chapter was installed by Jennie Colegrove, Illinois Beta. The event was kept secret, so that word would not reach the faculty of their plans because there was some anti-fraternity sentiment on campus. Jessie C. Sheldon was initiated two weeks later.\n\nThe chapter made its existence known when classes resumed in the fall of 1887. Although six the seven charter members had been expected to return, Myra Brown and Belle Armstrong unexpectedly withdrew from school. The new chapter had to quickly recruit new members to remain viable, and bids offered to Adah Browne (cousin of Josephine Graham), Mame Kerr and Grace P. Higbee were quickly accepted. The first reference to “the ladies of Pi Beta Phi” appeared in the student newspaper in December, 1887.\n\nLiving at Michigan Alpha\n\nFrom chartering until 1898, the College did not provide either residential housing or meeting rooms for the women’s fraternities. Members of Michigan Alpha tried renting houses near the College to serve as chapter houses. Only one of these has been identified, the “Olney House” — today known as “Dow House.” From 1898–1911, the College permitted women’s fraternities to use a double suite in East Hall dormitory as a chapter room. In 1898, the College finally assigned each women’s fraternity a suite in East Hall, the women’s dormitory. Alumna Kate King Bostwick (initiated 1892) donated a “mission-style cabinet” to the chapter to help furnish the suite; it is still in use in the chapter archives. At the same time, she donated an upright piano that remained in the various chapter houses for about 100 years. Beginning in 1913, the College became more receptive to the women having residential facilities and the chapter leased a series of houses, often from owners related to past chapter members, near the college.\n\nIn 1922, President William Spencer Gear decided that the women’s fraternities needed their own residential facilities, and two houses were purchased for this purpose. Pi Beta Phi was given a long-term lease to the house at 234 N. Manning Street; it was first occupied in the fall of 1923, and charter member May Copeland Reynolds Drybread was the first house mother.\n\nThe current house opened in 1970; alumna Roberta Simpson Ansbaugh led the fundraising that made the new facility possible. In the 1980s, it was remodeled to add the front staircase, breakfast nook and kitchen addition. There are 19 bedrooms, 37 women living in the house, and 42 on the meal plan here. Eating meals together really bonds sisters together!\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nPi Beta Phi, Chi Omega, and Kappa Kappa Gamma\n\nPhilanthropic Event\n\nMr. Hillsdale\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nMr. Hillsdale is a male beauty pageant in which the whole campus participates.\n\nNotable Alumnae\n\nElizabeth Clarke Helmick, Historian and Chairman and vital force behind the establishment of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School\n\nLeah Stock Helmick, teacher at Settlement School, 1914\n\nMaryAlice Chaffee Gerund, Director of the Settlement School, 1933-1934\n\nCarolyn Helman Lichtenberg Crest Award Winners from Michigan Alpha\n\nMichelle Morrow O’Brien (2015)\n\nRebecca Schmidt Abel (2014)\n\nInstalling Officer\n\nMay Copeland (Drybread), Michigan Alpha\n\nInstallation at Michigan Beta\n\nTwo Pi Beta Phi members, Minnie Newby, Iowa Alpha, and Statia Pritchard, Iowa Gamma, were attending the University Michigan and they selected women to be charter members of Michigan Beta. The charter members were Minnie, Statia, Lucy Parker, Fannie Read and Franc Arnold. Michigan Alphas May Copeland and Jessie Sheldon conducted the installation. On April 7, 1888, the Pi Beta Phi chapter was installed in the rooms of two charter members in the east wing of the lower floor of the Miner house at 42 Liberty Street.\n\nThe founding members had no badges. On the day after initiation they wore wine and silver blue ribbons in their hair. Later for pictures they made badges of gilt paper. The installation banquet took place at another charter member’s residence where there was a cake baked by the mother of a Delta Gamma. The chapter did not have a home until 1891 when the chapter established a residence at 720 South State Street. The owners gave the women the use of all but one room on the second floor, the use of their parlors for meetings and the use of their dining room and kitchen for parties.\n\nMichigan Betas were instrumental in starting other chapters. Michigan Betas Lucy Marris and Zuell Preston installed Pennsylvania Alpha at Swarthmore College on October 12, 1892. With the help of the Michigan Betas, five Northwestern University women applied for a Pi Phi charter. Illinois Epsilon was chartered on May 26, 1894. On November 1, 1894, Wisconsin Alpha was installed. Gertrude Clark Sober, a Michigan Beta, helped organized the chapter.\n\nLiving at Michigan Beta\n\nOn April 7, 1888, Minnie Newby Ricketts from Iowa Iota (later Iowa Alpha) and Statia Pritchard Oursler from Iowa Gamma met with three like-minded University of Michigan collegians in a private home adjacent to the University’s campus. The house was located at the corner of Liberty and Thompson Streets. These five women were the first members of the Michigan Beta chapter of Pi Beta Phi.\n\nAs the membership grew, the chapter rented meeting rooms in homes on Packard Street, East Ann Street, South State Street, and Monroe Street. Finally, the Detroit Alumnae Club established a building fund, and in 1908 Pi Phi was able to purchase the home of Professor Andrew McLaughlin at 836 Tappan Street, which they had been renting for two years. The lovely home was expanded several times and in 1958 a new wing was added.\n\nThere are now 37 bedrooms, 10 full bathrooms and many common rooms for gathering, socializing, and studying. The chapter has maintained an unbroken presence at the University of Michigan for almost 130 years, longer than any other sorority on campus. Generations of Pi Phis have called the Federal brick house with a white picket fence their beloved home.\n\nThe Michigan Beta Chapter House Corporation embarked on a Capital Campaign for the 125th Anniversary! With donations from support alumnae, the CHC was able to make wonderful improvements! These improvements include exterior renovations and fresh landscaping, history cabinet, new furniture and flooring in the living rooms, a new baby grand piano and updated bathrooms and bedrooms.\n\nCarolyn Helman Lichtenberg Crest Award Winners from Michigan Beta\n\nCatherine Wartinbee Townsend (2005)\n\nInstalling Officer\n\nGrand President Emily Russell Tarr, Texas Beta\n\nInstallation of Mississippi Gamma\n\nMississippi Gamma was installed the weekend of April 3–5, 2009 at Mississippi State University. The charter was received at the 2009 Dallas Convention. All of the installation events were held in the Colvard Student Union on Mississippi State University’s campus. The members enjoyed a Pledging Ceremony, banquet, and Cookie Shine. The activities far exceeded anyone’s expectations with such a large group in attendance, from family members, Pi Phi international and regional officers, Pi Phi alumnae, current collegians and fellow Mississippi State Greek members. Initiation was held at Starkville First United Methodist Church on Saturday, April 4. In attendance was Sarah Ruth “Sis” Mullis, South Carolina Alpha, and Oklahoma Beta Mary Loy Tatum, who served as New Chapter Assistance Officer until she became Grand President in 2009. Sarah Ruth “Sis” Mullis was then appointed as the Chapter Assistance Officer.\n\nLiving at Mississippi Gamma\n\nMississippi Gamma's house was the first house to be owned by the Fraternity Housing Corporation (FHC). FHC ensured the property would be environmentally sustainable by making it the first Greek house in the nation to be LEED certified (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design). With this distinction, the house was recognized by the U.S. Green Building Council with a LEED Silver certification for new construction. Covering over approximately 20,000 square feet, the house consists of 21 bedrooms housing 40 members along with the Housing Director. Ground was broken on April 8, 2010, and the women moved in 2011. The house has a painted brick exterior; inside features include dining and study halls, as well as a formal living room, library, study rooms and TV lounges.\n\nWhen they graduated, the founding class of 2009 purchased a commemorative iron bench. On the sprawling front porch, beautiful rocking chairs were donated by the Parents Club. Leading up to the front entrance of the house, brick pavers are placed in recognition of members. On the front of the house next to the porch stands a young Japanese maple tree in memorial of Tess Veal, a member who passed away in 2012.\n\nPanhellenic Groups on Campus\n\nAlpha Delta Pi, Chi Omega, Delta Delta Delta, Delta Gamma, Kappa Delta, Phi Mu, Pi Beta Phi and Zeta Tau Alpha\n\nPhilanthropic Service\n\nThere are two large philanthropy events throughout the year. In the fall there is Pie Night, where various types of pie are served and the proceeds go to Pi Beta Phi Friendship Fund and the Pi Phi Literacy Fund. In the spring there is Pi Phi Pizookie, where pizookies (skillet cookies with a scoop of ice cream on top) are served and the proceeds go to the Laura Carson Fund, the chapter’s local philanthropic partner.\n\nInstalling Officer\n\nGrand Vice President Lida Burkhard Lardner, Colorado Beta\n\nInstallation of Missouri Gamma\n\nThe Missouri Gamma Chapter of Pi Beta Phi was originally established as the Mu Beta sorority in 1906 on Drury College’s (later renamed Drury University) campus the chapter was notified via telegraph that the chapter was granted a charter for membership in Pi Beta Phi. The Pi Beta Phi chapter was officially installed on January 9, 1914. The Initiation Ceremony took place in the chapter room in Burnham Hall on campus. The installation banquet was held at the Colonial Hotel. In lieu of speeches, the banquet featured a morality play written for the occasion by charter member Mary Criss.\n\nLiving at Missouri Gamma\n\nThe Missouri Gamma Chapter at Drury University is special because in that it does not have a typical chapter house. Instead, the chapter has their own suite in the Panhellenic building, which includes three other chapters on campus. Chapter members come to the suite for chapter meetings, to do homework, watch TV and to hang out. To every member, the suite is a special gathering place filled with laughs and support, which makes it easy for the Missouri Gammas to feel at home.\n\nAn interesting item in the suite is the pin of Orpha Smith Dillard. Orpha is the mother of Dorothy “Dottie” Dillard who won two Grammy Awards as a singer with The Anita Kerr Quartet.
