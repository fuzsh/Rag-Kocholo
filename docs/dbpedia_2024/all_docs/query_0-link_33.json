While not a degree program, the Comprehensive Sciences program provides a series of basic science courses critical to the core general education curriculum requirements for students enrolled in university baccalaureate degree-granting programs. The Center for Pre-professional Education organizes and directs programs that strengthen the motivation and preparation of undergraduate and graduate students for success in the curricula for the health professions.\n\nThe Division of Social Sciences offers BA degrees in the Departments of African studies; Afro-American studies; Air Force ROTC; Army ROTC; Economics; History; Political Science; and Sociology and Anthropology.\n\nCOAS is accredited by the following agencies:\n\nAmerican Alliance for Health, Physical Education, and Dance\n\nNational Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education\n\nAmerican Chemical society\n\nAmerican Psychological Association\n\nMiddle states Association of Colleges and Schools\n\nNational Association for Sport and Physical Education\n\nNational Association of Schools of Art and Design\n\nNational Association of Schools of Music\n\nNational Association of Schools of Theatre\n\nThe College of Arts and Sciences currently occupies space in nine buildings on the Central Campus. The aging buildings do not allow for flexibility and also constrain scheduling for various programs. Specific needs include additional lecture halls with updated A/V and acoustics, studio space for the Department of Fine arts, an observation room for psychology, improved laboratory space for the hard sciences, and improved technology for labs and classroom spaces. Additionally, the Math and Economics departments are housed in a building that was designed to be temporary and does not meet ADA requirements.\n\nSCHOOL OF BUSINESS\n\nSCHOOL OF BUSINESS\n\n2600 6th St NW\n\nWashington, D.C. 20059\n\nPhone: 202-806-1500\n\nThe Howard University School of Business was founded in 1970 and has grown to prominence over the years. In 2006, its Master of Business Administration (MBA) programs were recognized by the Princeton Review as number one for “Greatest opportunities for minority students”, and number five for “most Competitive students.”\n\nThe School of Business offers the following undergraduate degrees, as well as MBA programs:\n\nAccounting\n\nHospitality Management Program\n\nFinance International Business and insurance\n\nInformation Systems and Decision Sciences\n\nHospitality\n\nMarketing\n\nManagement and Hospitality management\n\nSupply Chain management\n\nExecutive Leadership Honors Program\n\nTwenty-First Century Advantage Program\n\nThe School of Business is accredited by the Association of Advanced Collegiate Schools of Business International.\n\nExisting space in classroom space was determined to be largely adequate for the School of Business; however, there is need for additional space to accommodate additional space needs such as seminar rooms and informal gathering space. All space used by the School of Business needs additional technology and security to protect investments.\n\nTHE CATHY HUGHES SCHOOL OF COMMUNICATIONS\n\nCATHY HUGHES SCHOOL OF COMMUNICATIONS\n\n300 Bryant St NW\n\nWashington, D.C. 20059\n\nPhone: (202) 806-7694\n\nThe School of Communications (SOC) offers four departments: Radio, Television and Film; Journalism; Communication and Culture; and Communication Sciences and Disorders.\n\nSOC offers an MFA in Film program; traditional scholarly programs are housed within the Graduate School. SOC is accredited by the accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications and the American Speech, Language and Hearing Association.\n\nThe current location in the C.B. Powell Building (formerly Freedman’s Hospital) is undesirable due to the physical facility conditions, as well as the building layout. The many wings of the facility result in compartmentalization of the school, thereby limiting collaboration. Three Centers of Excellence are not physically located with the school, which is undesirable.\n\nSOC has worked extensively to plan a new facility, which would include state-of-the art technology, additional production studios and screening rooms, an auditorium, and opportunities for partnership with external groups.\n\nCOLLEGE OF DENTISTRY\n\nCOLLEGE OF DENTISTRY\n\n600 W Street NW\n\nWashington, D.C. 20059\n\nPhone: (202) 806-6100\n\nEstablished in 1881, the College of Dentistry is the fifth oldest dental school in the United States.

And, as one of the 14 schools and colleges within Howard, it is the only African-American theological school connected to a comprehensive category I research institution.\n\nSCHOOL OF EDUCATION (HUSOE)\n\nSCHOOL OF EDUCATION\n\n2441 4th Street, NW\n\nWashington, D.C. 20059\n\nPhone: (202) 806-7340\n\nHoward university school of Education (HUSOE) offers degree and certification programs through its three departments: Curriculum and Instruction; Educational Administration and Policy; and Human Development and Psychoeducational Studies.\n\nHUSOE offers four doctoral, 20 masters, and seven certificates of advanced studies programs, and one undergraduate degree: BS in Human Development with certification in early childhood education.\n\nThe mission of Howard University’s school of Education is to prepare teachers, administrators, researchers, program evaluators, and human development professionals for leadership in urban and diverse educational settings; significantly influence the national education agenda for African-American children; conduct and disseminate research that supports the belief that all students can learn; and provide a research-based blueprint for developing professionals who are capable of creating environments that evoke the abilities and talents of all students.\n\nThe School of Education is accredited by National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education and the National Association of State Directors of Teachers Education and Certification. The PhD program in counseling psychology is accredited by the American Psychological Association.\n\nThe majority of the spaces used by the school of Education are currently housed in a “temporary” building that is past its useful life. (Academic Support Building B)\n\nRecent renovation of Miner Hall has provided five classrooms that meet the needs of the School of Education; renovation of the remainder of the building would allow the School of Education to move out of academic support Building B and into space that is more appropriately designed for the school.\n\nHUSOE requires new space for research and teaching assistants, a curriculum library, observation rooms, and additional faculty offices. All School of Education space should be located in a single facility.\n\nCOLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, ARCHITECTURE, AND COMPUTER SCIENCES (CEACS)\n\nCOLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND ARCHITECTURE\n\n2300 Sixth Street, NW\n\nWashington, D.C. 20059\n\nPhone: (202) 806-6565\n\nThe College of Engineering, Architecture and Computer Sciences is home to the Departments of Architecture; Chemical Engineering; Civil Engineering; Electrical and Computer Engineering; Mechanical Engineering; and Systems and Computer science. The vision of CEACS is to become a recognized leader in research and the creation of learning environments conducive to the solution of problems which transcend the boundaries of discipline and profession.\n\nThe Howard University Science, Engineering, and Mathematics program (HUSEM) is a multidisciplinary program involving nine departments in CEACS and the College of Arts and Sciences. The goal of the HUSEM program is to promote academic achievement as well as increase the numbers of underrepresented minorities who receive baccalaureate and graduate degrees in STEM disciplines.\n\nIdeally all departments and colleges in the HUSEM program should be co-located in a facility conducive to cutting-edge research and collaboration.\n\nCEACS is accredited by the following agencies:\n\nAccreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc.\n\nComputer Science Accreditation Board\n\nNational Architectural Accrediting Board, Inc.\n\nThe College of Engineering, Architecture, and Computer Science space needs are related to Howard university’s increased emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.\n\nCEACS requires flexible classrooms with updated technology, as well as large studio spaces for the architecture program.\n\nCEACS is housed in three buildings on the west side of the Campus: Chemical Engineering, Downing Hall and the Howard Mackey Building. These three buildings face onto both Georgia avenue and 6th street.\n\nCHADWICK A. BOSEMAN COLLEGE OF FINE ARTS\n\nChadwick A.

The three facilities are Annex I, Annex II and Chauncey Cooper. Annex II was intended to be a temporary facility. These facilities are largely in need of significant upgrades to address deferred maintenance issues. Ideally, all departments within the College would be co-located in a single facility with state-of-the-art laboratory spaces. The existing space occupied by the Department of Physical Therapy was noted to have been recently renovated and meeting the departments’ needs.\n\nSCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK (SSW)\n\nSCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK\n\n601 Howard Place, NW\n\nWashington, D.C. 20059\n\nPhone: Main: 202-806-7300\n\nThe goals and objectives of the school of social Work emphasize preparation of advanced level Master of Social Work (MSW) professionals to practice at the local, national and international levels for the solution of human problems and to become leaders in their communities.

Its origins in the historic Freedmen’s Hospital (now the C.B. Powell Building). HUH has become one of the most comprehensive health care facilities in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. In April 2007, HUH ranked number one among selected area hospitals on 19 quality measures published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. HUH is the nation’s only teaching hospital located on the Campus of an HBCU.\n\nHUH operations are integrated with the academics of the university, particularly those of the schools and colleges focused on health sciences. The hospital offers students a superior learning environment and opportunities to observe or participate in ground-breaking clinical and research work approximately 300-350 beds for targeted patient types, such as hypertension, certain types of cancer, organ transplantation (kidneys), orthopedic surgery, and podiatry are provided.\n\nHUH operations are integrated with the academics of the university, particularly those of the schools and colleges focused on health sciences. The hospital offers students a superior learning environment and opportunities to observe or participate in ground-breaking clinical and research work with professionals who are changing the face of health care.\n\nHoward university Hospital facilities include:\n\nMain Hospital Building\n\nTower Building\n\nCancer Center (shared with the university)\n\nMedical Arts Building (shared with the university)\n\nMental Health Clinic\n\nTwo parking structures along Fifth Street NW, which are operated by a separate management company\n\nThis campus' master plan did not include a full analysis of the hospital’s programmatic needs. This must take place within the context of a separate specialized master plan for the hospital. The Health Science Enterprise is conducting a strategic planning exercise that will form the basis for such a plan.\n\nDuring the course of interviews, some of the suggestions noted for HUH included the following:\n\nApproximately 300-350 beds for targeted patient types, such as hypertension, certain types of cancer, organ transplantation (kidneys), orthopedic surgery, and podiatry with a training program.\n\nComprehensive approach to deferred maintenance liabilities.\n\nLIBRARIES\n\nThe Howard University library system is comprised of a number of general and specialty libraries across the three campuses. The central library complex is located at the south end of the yard and includes Founders Library and the attached Undergraduate Library. Branch libraries include the Architecture Library (Howard Mackey Building), the Business Library (Classroom Building Four/School of Business), and the Social Work Library (Inabel Burns Lindsay Hall). The Louis stokes Health Sciences Library is located at the southern end of Central Campus and serves the Health Sciences Complex.\n\nA small library is located at the School of Divinity’s East Campus location, and the Law Library is located on the West Campus.\n\nThe university is considering closing the Social Work Library and the Architecture Library because these facilities are too small to be sustainable, have duplicate materials, and are costly to operate. Collections would be moved to the Central Library Campus (Founders/Undergraduate Library).\n\nSpecial collections space includes:\n\nMoorland-Spingarn Research Center – The Moorland-Spingarn Research Center is one of the world’s largest and most comprehensive repositories for the documentation of the history and culture of people of African descent in Africa, the Americas, and other parts of the world. This center is located within Founders Library.\n\nChanning Pollock Theatre Collection – The Channing Pollock Collection contains the playwright’s published works, manuscripts, and personal correspondence with celebrities of his day; as well as clippings, photographs, programs, broadsides, and sheet music representing different phases of the theatrical and entertainment world. This collection is located in Founders Library.\n\nAfro-American Studies Resource Center – The Center houses one of the premier collections of literary and social science publications on the black experience in America. This collection is located in Founders Library.\n\nRalph J. Bunche International Affairs Center Reading Room – This is a collection of about 1,000 books and current periodicals on various subjects in international affairs, including foreign policy, international law, diplomacy, politics, international trade, conflict resolution, economic development, strategic studies, military affairs, and international organizations. This collection is located at the Bunche Center.\n\nFounders Library was opened in 1938 (designed by Albert Irvin Cassell) and is home to the following uses:\n\nBrowsing Room\n\nMoorland-Spingarn Research Center\n\nAfro-American Resource Center\n\nDigital Learning Classroom\n\nChanning Pollock Theater Collection\n\nHoward University Museum\n\nReference Room\n\nInterlibrary Loan Services\n\nStacks\n\nThe Undergraduate Library was opened in 1983 and is contiguous with Founders Library. This building houses study space, as well as stacks/collections storage.\n\nThe Howard University Library system has more than 2.5 million volumes; 16,600 current journal subscriptions; 4.2 million microform pieces; 18,000 manuscripts; and thousands of audio-visual items.\n\nWith the exception of the collections listed on the previous page, the university’s libraries do not house any special collections and do not have special temperature and humidity requirements. The most valuable collections are stored off-site in remote storage.\n\nThe university is a member of the Association of Research Libraries and the Chesapeake Information and Research Library Alliance (CIRLA). CIRLA offers faculty and graduate students direct reciprocal borrowing privileges at member libraries, which include George Washington, Georgetown, University of Maryland, Johns Hopkins, and the University of Delaware.\n\nSPIRITUAL LIFE\n\nThe Andrew Rankin Memorial Chapel serves as a center for cultural and religious activities of the university and is dedicated to fulfilling the spiritual and religious needs of the students, faculty and administration. Besides traditional Sunday services which are broadcast on WHUR, the Chapel also hosts on-Campus events and serves as a quasi-student affairs group (i.e., hosting alternative spring break to New Orleans).\n\nBuilt during the presidency of Jeremiah Rankin (1890- 1903), Andrew Rankin memorial Chapel was constructed in 1894-95 and was dedicated in 1896. Designated as a National Historic Landmark, Rankin Chapel has been served by four deans. Additionally, chaplains from a variety of denominations and ministries, the Friends of Chapel, the Chapel Assistants, the Chapel Ushers, and the Chapel Choir all support the ministry of Rankin Chapel. The Chapel Choir, which is noted for its excellence and inspiring music, is composed of members of the various university choirs, the alumni, and individuals from the wider community.\n\nAndrew Rankin memorial Chapel is 90 feet long and 50 feet wide, not including the tower. The Chapel has two floors: the first story was once used as the Howard university art Gallery and was remodeled in 1948 into a religious activities Center; the auditorium, on the upper floor, is the sanctuary.\n\nThe Chapel holds about 500-600 people, but chapel services are nearly triple that at times, and nearly always double. These services are currently held in Cramton Auditorium. additional Dean of the Chapel space (offices/administration) is located next to the Chapel in the Carnegie Building. Other events held in the chapel include weddings, funerals, and some revenue-generating functions. There are also regular programs by both the Dean of the Chapel’s office and student organizations.\n\nThe Rankin Chapel is identified as a national chapel, but it does not have the space required to serve this function."
