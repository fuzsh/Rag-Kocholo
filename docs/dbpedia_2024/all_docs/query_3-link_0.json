And some arenâ€™t\n\nThe space will resemble a home and host dinners and educational events\n\nHigh priced male artists such as Warhol and Picasso dominate the stands\n\nBlue-chip dealers have been using Basel as an opportunity to build the potential stars of the future\n\nHigh priced male artists such as Warhol and Picasso dominate the stands\n\nWe noted in 2010, amid a painful global downturn, that a Picasso nude carried the largest pre-sale auction estimate in history at $70m to $90m\n\nBuilding, staff and some artists on the way out\n\nGalleries such as Gagosian and Matthew Marks see opportunities, despite small collector base\n\nA loss of 60 galleries does not seem to have affected morale as the fair returns with redesigned space and more dealers\n\nThe inaugural exhibition at the Rennie Collection will showcase sculptor Mona Hatoum\n\nNo return to the boom, but is the worst really over so soon?"
