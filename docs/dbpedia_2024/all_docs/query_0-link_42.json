For the Canadian award, see Canadian National Magazine Awards.\n\nNational Magazine AwardsAwarded forExcellence in the magazine industrySponsored byAmerican Society of Magazine Editors in association with Columbia University Graduate School of JournalismDateAnnualLocationNew York City, New YorkCountryUnited StatesPresented byAmerican Society of Magazine EditorsFirst awarded1966; 58 years ago ( )Websitewww .asme .media /asme-awards\n\nThe National Magazine Awards, also known as the Ellie Awards, honor print and digital publications that consistently demonstrate superior execution of editorial objectives, innovative techniques, noteworthy enterprise and imaginative design. Originally limited to print magazines, the awards now recognize magazine-quality journalism published in any medium. They are sponsored by the American Society of Magazine Editors (ASME) in association with Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, and are administered by ASME in New York City. The awards have been presented annually since 1966.[1]\n\nThe Ellie Awards are judged by magazine journalists and journalism educators selected by the administrators of the awards. More than 300 judges participate every year. Each judge is assigned to a judging group that averages 15 judges, including a judging leader. Each judging group chooses five finalists (seven in Reporting and Feature Writing); the same judging group selects one of the finalists to be the winner of the Ellie Award in that category. Judging results are subject to the approval of the National Magazine Awards Board, which is composed of current and former officers of ASME, the dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, and veteran judges.\n\nFinalists in each of the Ellie Award categories receive certificates of recognition. The winner in each category receives a reproduction of Alexander Calder's stabile \"Elephant\", the symbol of the awards since 1970. Among the notable changes for 2017 are the expansion of the Design and Photography categories to include digital entries and the suspension of the Fiction award.\n\nHonors print and digital magazines in several categories based on content and audience.\n\nBusinessweek received the first ever award in 1973. No award was given from 1974 through 1980. When General Excellence returned as a category in 1981, it was given to four magazines per year until 1998, when five magazines received General Excellence awards. Six magazines received awards in 2002. From 2003 to 2010, the award went to seven different magazines and in 2011, to eight. Since 2012, the award has gone to six magazines.\n\nStarting 2016, it is defined into four groups: \"News, Sports and Entertainment\", \"Service and Lifestyle\", \"Special Interest\", \"Literature, Science and Politics\".\n\nYear Title 1973 Businessweek 1981 Glamour, Businessweek, Audubon, ARTnews 1982 Science 81, Rocky Mountain, Newsweek, Camera Arts 1983 Science 82, Louisiana Life, LIFE, Harper's Magazine 1984 Outside, National Geographic, House & Garden, The American Lawyer 1985 Manhattan, Inc., American Heritage, American Health, TIME 1986 New England Monthly, Money, Discover, 3-2-1 Contact 1987 People, New England Monthly, ELLE, Common Cause 1988 The Sciences, Parents, Hippocrates, Fortune 1989 Vanity Fair, Sports Illustrated, The Sciences, American Heritage 1990 Metropolitan Home, 7 Days, Texas Monthly, Sports Illustrated 1991 The New Republic, Interview, Glamour, Condé Nast Traveler 1992 Texas Monthly, The New Republic, National Geographic, Mirabella 1993 Newsweek, Lingua Franca, The Atlantic, American Photo 1994 Health, Businessweek, Wired, Print 1995 The New Yorker, Men's Journal, I.D., Entertainment Weekly 1996 The Sciences, Civilization, Outside, Businessweek 1997 I.D., Wired, Vanity Fair, Outside 1998 Rolling Stone, Preservation, Outside, DoubleTake 1999 Vanity Fair', I.D., Fast Company, Condé Nast Traveler 2000 Saveur, The New Yorker, Nest, National Geographic 2001 Teen People, The New Yorker, Mother Jones, The American Scholar 2002 Vibe, Print, Newsweek, National Geographic Adventure, Entertainment Weekly 2003 Texas Monthly, Parenting, Foreign Policy, ESPN The Magazine, The Atlantic, Architectural Record 2004 Popular Science, Newsweek, Gourmet, Aperture, Budget Living, Chicago 2005 Wired, The New Yorker, Print, Martha Stewart Weddings, Glamour, Dwell 2006 The Virginia Quarterly Review, TIME, New York, Harper's Magazine, Esquire, ESPN The Magazine 2007 Wired, Rolling Stone, New York, National Geographic, Foreign Policy, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists 2008 Print, The New Yorker, National Geographic, Mother Jones, GQ, Backpacker 2009 Foreign Policy, Field & Stream, Wired, Texas Monthly, Reader's Digest 2010 San Francisco, New York, National Geographic, Mother Jones, GQ, Men's Health 2011 Women's Health, Scientific American, Garden & Gun, Poetry, New York, LA mag 2012 Inc., House Beautiful, IEEE Spectrum, O, The Oprah Magazine, Bloomberg Businessweek 2013 The Paris Review, Martha Stewart Weddings, National Geographic, Vogue, Outside 2014 New York, Poetry, Inc., Field & Stream, Bon Appétit, Sunset 2015 Garden & Gun, Glamour, The Hollywood Reporter, Nautilus Quarterly, The New Yorker, Men's Health 2016 New York, Lucky Peach, The Hollywood Reporter, Oxford American 2017 ESPN The Magazine, Bon Appétit, Modern Farmer, The Marshall Project 2018 The New Yorker, The New York Times Style Magazine, San Francisco, Aperture 2019 National Geographic, The New York Times Style Magazine, Kazoo, Virginia Quarterly Review 2020 The New York Times Magazine, Bon Appétit, The Hollywood Reporter, Quanta 2021 The New Yorker, The New York Times Style Magazine, Audubon, Stranger’s Guide\n\nPreviously known as Visual Excellence (1970–1979).
