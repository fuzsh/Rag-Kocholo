        "text": "What's it like being an HCSS intern? Hear it straight from our very own Giulio Damiani! HCSS general intern Giulio Damiani sat down with Stephanie Govaerts to talk about the various research topics he worked on, advice for applying and the connections made during his HCSS journey. \"The first thing I say to my friends and family when they ask me what I do as a general intern, is that I learn more at HCSS in a single day than I do outside of work in an entire month. This is because the diverse data gathering, data analysis and writing tasks that you are assigned with are extremely valuable in both expanding your general knowledge of international politics, as well as honing more practical skills that may be useful for the future.\" \"What I enjoyed most about the internship was being able to personally connect with and professionally learn from some of the smartest and kindest people I have ever met. I think this was possible only because of the horizontal hierarchy that exists at HCSS: roles are well-defined, but everyone truly respects and values everyone else, and an intern with a question or interest can always set up a meeting or politely go up to a Senior Analyst and ask for some advice.\" \"This experience taught me how much there is to learn within the field, and how working at this company allows you to tread outside of your comfort zone in the best way possible.\" Read the entire interview here on the HCSS website ‚òü https://lnkd.in/ebaC-5fS ‚è∞ The HCSS general internship programme is open for applications - if you want to gain experience working on some of the most significant global issues of our time while being part of a dynamic team driving innovation in the field of geopolitics, then apply now!\n\nI love learning how different parts of the world are intertwined. ‚≠êÔ∏è Aiden Giarnese '25 üíº Economics & Social Affairs Intern at the United States Mission to the UN üóΩ New York City, NY üìö Analytical Economics I‚Äôve always had an interest in economics, sustainability, and international affairs. What better way to bring those interests together than to intern at the UN? Now I'm living my dream in NYC, with days packed full of diplomacy in action: üîπAttend United Nations policy meetings üîπWrite briefing papers for U.S. Ambassadors üîπResearch global issues üîπSupport multilateral negotiations üîπAnalyze international voting patterns I've had so many unbelievable opportunities. I drafted remarks for a meeting with the Colombian president! Took notes as leaders from different countries discussed global AI guidelines. Helped organized a vote to accredit UN committees. Talk about a crash course in international relations! üåç It‚Äôs a major confidence boost to be part of such meaningful work. This experience has taught me how to manage time effectively, prioritize tasks, and say 'no' when my plate is too full. I‚Äôve also learned how to synthesize research into succinct, actionable papers. All skills that will serve me in any career. Paul College prepared me for this internship in ways I never imagined: üìà Leadership role in The Atkins Investment Group sharpened my research skills üá®üá≥ Study abroad in China gave me a global perspective üíª Hands-on learning experiences built my confidence for high-stakes situations And living in NYC is incredible. I have a studio in midtown Manhattan! (My internship provides housing, which has been a huge help.) I've found a great group to play ping pong with and have seen some Broadway shows. I love walking the city ‚Äì there‚Äôs always something new to discover. One drawback: groceries add up fast! Paul‚Äôs Internship Opportunity Fund has been a lifesaver to help cut my overall costs. Pro-tip for future interns: Don't be afraid to apply for positions you think you're unqualified for. UNH and Paul College have opened doors I never thought possible. You never know what they're looking for. Dream big and go for it!\n\nIn just a few day‚Äôs time, European Studies will proudly hand out over 100 diplomas to a fresh group of graduates. Wha are they? What have they done and what are they doing next? These are nice to know for anyone who is thinking about starting the programme their finishing, but our students are so diverse that it‚Äôs hard to give simple answers to these questions. That‚Äôs why we like sharing examples, like Elly Ambatzidellis, who just finished her internship. ‚ÄúI'm thrilled to share that I have successfully completed my 5-month internship with KPN's Public Affairs team, earning a score of 8.3! During my internship, I had the incredible opportunity to dive deep into telecom regulation and work on a fascinating research project. My focus was on the impact of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in terms of European regulation and exploring how KPN can leverage this technology to enhance and expand its services for consumers. This experience significantly enriched my understanding of telecom regulation, especially within the context of the European Union and its institutions such as the European Commission. I am immensely grateful to my internship supervisor, Jos√© Moure, for his invaluable guidance and support throughout these months. A big thank you also goes to my work placement mentor, Bert van den Bergh, for his continuous encouragement and mentorship.Completing this internship marks the final stage of my Bachelor's in European Studies, and I am excited to graduate this July. Looking ahead, I will be pursuing an online Master's in International Relations and Eastern Mediterranean Studies at the University of Nicosia starting this fall.‚Äù Elly is a great example of the types of things that European Studies students do, and the ways in which European Studies brings the words of politics and European regulations together with the needs of businesses, among other things. We have no doubt that you‚Äôll be successful in whatever you do Elly. Good luck.\n\nDear network, I recently completed my Master Thesis on Neurodiversity at Work, where I analyzed hundreds of papers to see how the literature about neurodiversity evolved and to confirm the growing academic interest of the subject for Business and Management journals. Seeking to answer the question \"how has the concept of neurodiversity at work evolved over the years?\", the paper unveils the growing number of academic articles on neurodiversity in all spheres, including business. When brainstorming the different ways we can include neurodivergent people at work, the subject can include psychology, social sciences, and management. It can also be of particular importance for HR professionals and recruiters! This thesis was one of the main academic requirements for me to pass my year as a PGE 4 International Track student at Internationa Business School, alongside the completion of a detailed internship report. As my internship recently ended, my focus is now on the academic exchange semesters during which I will be in Montr√©al, attending McGill University! üéâ"
