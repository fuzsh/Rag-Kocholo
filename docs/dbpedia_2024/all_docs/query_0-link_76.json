The images by the artist have never been displayed in China, due to the government’s censorship.\n\nStamatoudi, Irini, Research Handbook on Intellectual Property and Cultural Heritage (2022). This Research Handbook offers a comprehensive analysis of the intersections between intellectual property and cultural heritage law. It explores and compares how both have evolved and sometimes converged over time, how they increased tremendously in significance, as well as in economic value, despite the fact that intellectual property mainly pertains to the private sphere, whilst cultural heritage is considered a common good.\n\nStech, Molly Torsen, Artists’ Rights: A Guide to Copyright, Moral Rights and Other Legal Issues in the Visual Art Sphere (January 2015). “Artists’ Rights introduces artists to legal concepts in the intellectual property space that could become important tools in managing their artworks, now and into the future.”\n\nRes Strehle, Jürg Wildberger, Dölf Duttweiler, Ruedi Christen, Rosa Lichtenstein, Die Bührle-Saga (November 2021).

Why would a smart New York investment banker pay $12 million for the decaying, stuffed carcass of a shark? By what alchemy does Jackson Pollock’s drip painting No. 5, 1948 sell for $140 million? Intriguing and entertaining, The $12 Million Stuffed Shark is a Freakonomics approach to the economics and psychology of the contemporary art world. Why were record prices achieved at auction for works by 131 contemporary artists in 2006 alone, with astonishing new heights reached in 2007? Don Thompson explores the money, lust, and self-aggrandizement of the art world in an attempt to determine what makes a particular work valuable while others are ignored.\n\nYoung, Alison., Street Art, Public City: Law, Crime and the Urban Imagination, (2014). Since the late 1990s, a distinctive cultural practice has emerged in many cities: street art, involving the placement of unsolicited artworks in public places. Sometimes regarded as a variant of graffiti, sometimes called a new art movement, its practitioners engage in illicit activities while at the same time, the resulting artworks can command high prices at auction and have become collectible aesthetic commodities. Such paradoxical responses show that street art challenges conventional understandings of culture, law, crime, and art.\n\nWagner, Ethan and Wagner, Thea Westreich, Collecting Art for Love, Money and More (April 2013). Arranged into ten topics that are approached through a key question and answer format, art advisors Thea Westreich Wagner and Ethan Wagner offer an accessible yet unrivaled insider’s view into the often opaque world of collecting art, drawing from their extensive experience in working with collectors and institutions of contemporary art.\n\nWerbel, Amy, Lust on Trial: Censorship and the Rise of American Obscenity in the Age of Anthony Comstock (April 2018). Anthony Comstock was America’s first professional censor. From 1873 to 1915, as Secretary of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, Comstock led a crusade against lasciviousness, salaciousness, and obscenity that resulted in the confiscation and incineration of more than three million pictures, postcards, and books he judged to be obscene. But as Amy Werbel shows in this rich cultural and social history, Comstock’s campaign to rid America of vice in fact led to greater acceptance of the materials he deemed objectionable, offering a revealing tale about the unintended consequences of censorship.\n\nWerner, Gephart & Jure, Leko (editors), Law and the Arts (May 2017). If we dare to relate law and the arts, we should be aware of the possible danger arising from the commingling of their respective spheres – and yet there are many insights to be gained from confronting them in philosophical-sociological reflection. As the broad topical variety of contributions on literature, visual arts, film, music, and architecture in this volume serves to show, we are thus learning about law from art and acquiring a deeper understanding of the peculiarity of the arts from the law.\n\nWilliams, Elizabeth and Russell, Sue, The Illustrated Courtroom: 50+ Years of Court Art, (June 2022).

At a time where museums are facing difficulties to acquire new works of art because of high prices on the art market and low public funds, this collection of 34 short essays, prepared or delivered in honor of Peter Hecht, an art historian, guides readers through a description of the important and complex role of museum acquisitions in creating public collection. Hecht, who recently retired from Utrecht University has been described as “the great champion of public art collections, who throughout his career has worked to show…why museums matter and how their collections, large or small, national or local, can make a profound difference to the lives of those who use them.”\n\nCostamagna, Philippe, The Eye: An Insider’s Memoir of Masterpieces, Money, and the Magnetism of Art, (2018) Tr. by Frank Wynne An insider’s view into the “rarified world of connoisseurs devoted to the authentication and discovery of Old Master art works,” ARTnews calls it a “picaresque tale” by an expert who “has been driven to follow a passion outside the money game of art.” An art adventure story and memoir all-in-one, the book focuses on author’s foray into authentication in the furtherance of both the art market and scholarship. Costamagna is a specialist in 16th century Italian painting and director of the Musée des Beaux Arts in Ajaccio, Corsica.\n\nGaillemin, Jean-Louis, Trop Beau Pour Etre Vrai (Oct. 2019).

In Tiffany Jenkins’ new strongly-worded essay on repatriation, she traces the sometimes messy histories of how artifacts ended up in Western museums. The book is written amid an increase in repatriation cases over the last few decades, a recent phenomenon that Jenkins assesses. Controversially, Jenkins argues in favor of the museum as crucial centers for knowledge and culture, and for these artifacts to stay in them.\n\nJoyner, Andrew (Illustrator), Dr. Seuss, Dr. Seuss’s Horse Museum (September 2019).

This book illustrates a history of how people have been represented in museums, with displays of anthropological scenes, art and artifacts, as well as human remains – skulls and skeletons, largely of foreign and prehistoric peoples. The book explores the colonial impetus behind this kind of collection and exhibition at institutions, and probes questions around the contemporary custodianship of these objects.

In the book, Adam Kuper addresses issues of race, colonialism, difference and cultural appropriation, through an examination of the coexistence of human lives and the role of the museum in it.\n\nLehmann, W., Museum Administration: Law and Practice, Independently Published (Sept. 2020).

Written by the former Director of the Queens Museum, this book aims to examine what cultural institutions can do to address historical context for the current controversies.

From the publisher: Between 1900 and 1950 the British state amassed a huge collection of over 800 historic buildings, monuments, and sites and opened them to the public. This engaging book explains why the extraordinary collecting frenzy took place, locating it in the fragile and nostalgic atmosphere of the interwar years, dominated by neo-romanticism and cultural protectionism. The government’s activities were mirrored by the establishment of dozens of voluntary bodies, including the Council for the Protection of Rural England, the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, and the National Trust. Men from the Ministry sets all this activity, for the first time, in its political, economic and cultural contexts, painting a picture of a country traumatized by war, fearful of losing what was left of its history, and a government that actively set out to protect them. It dissects a government program that established a modern state on deep historical and rural roots.\n\nVikan, Gary, Sacred and Stolen: Confessions of a Museum Director (Sept. 2016). Critically acclaimed already, this 2016 publication is a memoir of an art museum director who looks at the “messy underbelly of museum life: looted antiquities, crooked dealers, deluded collectors, duplicitous public officials, fakes, inside thefts, bribery, and failed exhibitions.” Museum directors come and go, but their journeys are often lesson-forming and memorable. In case of Vikan, his experiences included meeting “the elegant French oil heiress, Dominique de Menil, the notorious Turkish smuggler, Aydin Dikmen, his slippery Dutch dealer, Michel van Rijn, the inscrutable and implacable Patriarchs of Ethiopia and Georgia, and the charismatic President of Georgia, Eduard Shevardnadze—along with a mysterious thief of a gorgeous Renoir painting missing from a museum for over sixty years.”\n\nCultural Heritage & Property\n\nAlbright, Evan, The Man Who Owned A Wonder Of The World, The Gringo History of Mexico’s Chichén Itzá, Bohlin Carr, (Dec. 2015). In 2007 the ancient Maya city of Chichén Itzá in Yucatán, Mexico, was named one of the new Seven Wonders of the World. The honor came with a shocking revelation — Mexico’s greatest archaeological treasure was private property! How could one family come to own one of the archaeological crown jewels of Mexico? The answer was more incredible: they had bought the ancient city from an American, Edward H. Thompson, who had owned Chichén for half a century. Thompson, an archaeologist, explored Chichén and had made one of the greatest archaeological discoveries in North America. All it cost him was his reputation, his fortune, and even his life. In this gripping non-fiction narrative, award-winning writer Evan Albright travels to Yucatan to investigate Thompson’s incredible true story and stumbles upon Thompson’s biggest secret–the son he left behind.\n\nBlake, Janet, International Cultural Heritage Law (August 2015). “Providing both a perfect introduction to cultural heritage law and deeper reflection on its challenges, this book should be invaluable for students, scholars, and practitioners in the field. The book provides a comprehensive overview of the development of international cultural heritage law and policy since 1945. It sets out the international (including regional) law currently governing the protection and safeguarding of cultural heritage in peace time, as well as international cultural policy-making. In addition to analyzing the relevant legal frameworks, it focuses on the broader policy and other contexts within which and in response to which this law has developed.”\n\nBrocas, Sophie, Le Baiser (January 2019). The novel unveils the story of two women in search of justice and independence, questioning the status of works of art, eternal mercantile properties, which are nevertheless the common heritage of humanity.\n\nChechi, Alessandro, The Settlement of International Cultural Heritage Disputes (May 2014). This book “provides a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the issues created by current system governing the settlement of cultural heritage disputes; Examines in detail the applicable legal regimes and dispute settlement procedures, assessing the merits and drawbacks of the governing national and international norms; Offers innovative solutions to the problem of fragmentation within settlements of cultural heritage disputes by focusing on rethinking existing fora and on evolving principles and rules.”\n\nCohen, Monica. F, Pirating Fictions: Ownership and Creativity in Nineteenth Century Popular Culture (January 2018). Using landmarks in copyright history as a backdrop, Pirating Fictions argues that popular nineteenth-century pirate fiction mischievously resists the creation of intellectual property in copyright legislation and law. The book demonstrates how literary appropriation was celebrated at the very moment when the forces of possessive individualism began to enshrine the language of personal ownership in Anglo-American views of creative work.\n\nColwell, Chip, Plundered Skulls and Stolen Spirits: Inside the Fight to Reclaim Native America’s Culture (March 2017). Who owns the past and the objects that physically connect us to history? And who has the right to decide this ownership, particularly when the objects are sacred or, in the case of skeletal remains, human? Is it the museums that care for the objects or the communities whose ancestors made them? These questions are at the heart of Plundered Skulls and Stolen Spirits, an unflinching insider account by a leading curator who has spent years learning how to balance these controversial considerations.\n\nCooper, Elena, Art and Modern Copyright: The Contested Image (September 2018). The book is the first in-depth and longitudinal study of the history of copyright protecting the visual arts. Exploring legal developments during an important period in the making of the modern law, the mid-nineteenth to early twentieth centuries, in relation to four themes – the protection of copyright ‘authors’ (painters, photographers and engravers), art collectors, sitters and the public interest. It uncovers a number of long-forgotten narratives of copyright history, including views of copyright that differ from how we think about copyright today.\n\nCulture in Crisis: Preserving Cultural Heritage in Conflict Zones, (April 2017). Produced by The Antiquities Coalition in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, this book features contributions from students in the conflict management program. Each student explored a specific topic related to looting, trafficking, and destruction of cultural heritage in Syria and Iraq. The result is an interdisciplinary look at a wide range of issues in the field from both an academic and practical perspective.\n\nCultural Heritage Law And Ethics: Mapping Recent Developments, Studies in Art Law, vol. 26 (Dec. 2017). Cultural heritage is a unique and important testimony to the history and identity of different peoples and should be preserved in all circumstances. Regrettably, it is increasingly threatened in both peacetime and duringconflict. This topic was discussed during the “Second All Art and Cultural Heritage Law Conference” organised by the Art-Law Centre of the University of Geneva on 24-25 June 2016, and is further examined by the authors of this book. This volume looks at the overall question of how the existing legal framework for the protection of cultural heritage can be improved. To this end, a number of recent legal developments arising from domestic and international legal practice are critically examined. These developments mostly revolve around the question of responsibility for the commission of illicit activities, on the one hand, and the relationship between law and ethics, on the other.\n\nCuno, James, Cultural Heritage and Mass Atrocities, (September 2022). Cultural Heritage and Mass Atrocities assembles thirty-eight experts from the heritage, social science, humanitarian, legal, and military communities. Focusing on immovable cultural heritage vulnerable to attack, the volume’s guiding framework is the Responsibility to Protect (R2P), a United Nations resolution adopted unanimously in 2005 to permit international intervention against crimes of war or genocide. Comprehensive sections on vulnerable populations as well as the role of international law and the military offer readers critical insights and point toward research, policy, and action agendas to protect both people and cultural heritage.\n\nFinkelstein, Claire, Gillman, Derek, and Rosén, Frederik ed., The Preservation of Art and Culture in Times of War, (Sept. 2022). Today, systematic exploitation, manipulation, attacks, and destruction of cultural heritage are involved in most violent conflicts across the world. With an increasing awareness of the role cultural heritage plays in war, scholars and practitioners have progressed from seeing the conflict-related destruction of cultural heritage as a cultural tragedy to understanding it as a vital national security issue. This volume seeks to deepen public understanding of the evolving nexus between cultural heritage and security in the twenty-first century. Drawing on a variety of disciplines and perspectives, the chapters in this volume examine a complex set of relationships between the deliberate destruction and misuse of cultural heritage in times of conflict, on the one hand, and basic societal values, legal principles, and national security, on the other.\n\nGonzález, Pablo Alonso, Cuban Cultural Heritage: A rebel past for a revolutionary nation; foreword by Paul A.

It starts from a broad conception of cultural heritage that encompasses both tangible property, such as museum objects or buildings, and intangible heritage, such as languages and traditions. Cultural heritage thus defined is protected by various legal regimes, including the law of armed conflicts, UNESCO Conventions, and international criminal law. With a view to strengthening international protection, the authors analyze existing regimes and elaborate innovative concepts, such as blue helmets of culture and safe havens for endangered cultural heritage. Finally, the ends of international protection come to the fore, and the authors address possible conflicts between protecting cultural diversity and wishing to strengthen cultural identity.\n\nLevy, Reynold, They Told Me Not to Take That Job: Tumult, Betrayal, Heroics, and the transformation of Lincoln Center (May 2015).

Yet there has been no comprehensive survey to date of the current state of affairs with regard to immunity from seizure of foreign cultural objects belonging to foreign States that are on loan for temporary exhibition. This study fills that gap by examining whether there is any rule of (customary) international law stipulating that such cultural objects are immune from seizure, or whether such a rule is emerging.”\n\nWatenpaugh, Heighnar Zeitlian, The Missing Pages: The Modern Life of a Medieval Manuscript, from Genocide to Justice (February 2019).

The second part of Georgina Adam’s study of the art market depicts the “dark side” of art transactions, from the purchase of art as an investment to money laundering. “It is a world that is unrecognizable to the millions of people who go to shows, the art lovers who join museums such as the Tate, the thousands of artists, curators, writers, and traders who feel privileged to make a modest living in the art world. But it is a world, Adam argues, increasingly distorted as art grows ever closer to the luxury goods industry.”\n\nBandle, Anne L., The Sale of Misattributed Artworks and Antiques at Auction, (October 2016).

This book examines lotteries as devices for distributing images and art objects and constructing their value in the former Low Countries. Alongside the fairs and before specialist auction sales were established, they were an atypical but popular and large-scale form of the art trade.

Journalist Michael Shnayerson traces the back-stabbing, money-driven history of the contemporary art market in this engrossing account.

Within forty-eight hours in the fall of 2014, buyers in the Sotheby’s and Christie’s New York auction houses spent $1.7 billion on contemporary art. Non-taxed freeport warehouses around the globe are stacked with art held for speculation. One of Jeff Koons’ five chromium-plated stainless steel balloon dogs sold for 50 percent more at auction than the previous record for any living artist. A painting by Christopher Wool, featuring four lines from a Francis Ford Coppola movie stenciled in black-on-a-white background, sold for $28 million. In The Orange Balloon Dog, economist and bestselling author Don Thompson cites these and other fascinating examples to explore the sometimes baffling activities of the high-end contemporary art market.

Based on the concept of mimesis, this volume illustrates that forgeries are not to be understood as a negative copy or disgraced ripoff of an original but as an autonomous aesthetic practice, a creative act in itself. The contributions focus on such different implementations as faked traditions, pseudotranslations, imposters, identity theft, and hoaxes in different arts and historic contexts.\n\nBennett, Michael, Praxiteles: The Cleveland Apollo (October 2013). “The Cleveland Apollo is most likely the only surviving original sculpture by Praxiteles, and the only life-size Greek bronze that can be securely attributed to a Greek sculptor by name.

Today, with prices in the hundreds of millions, and billionaires’ collections among the most conspicuous and liquid of their assets, crime is more rampant than ever in the world of art. Increased prices and globalization have introduced new levels of fraud and malfeasance into the art world.

In Art and Crime, art experts Stefan Koldehoff and Tobias Timm tell stories of high-stakes, brazen art crimes–everything from “artnapping,” to forgery and tax fraud. The authors also provide a well-founded analysis of what needs to change in the art market and at museums.\n\nLee, Wendy, The Art of Confidence, (November 2016).

How can we determine whether it was Leonardo’s hand that created Salvator Mundi? How can we prove that a suspected Pollock is a forgery? And how can Man in a Black Cravat be attributed to Lucian Freud, despite Freud’s adamant refusal to recognize it as one of his own?

The readership of this book is expected to include academics, researchers, and practitioners in the fields of criminology, sociology, law, and heritage studies who have an interest in art and heritage crime.”\n\nArt theft and Nazi-era Looted Art\n\nAlford, Kenneth D., Hermann Göring and the Nazi Art Collection: The Looting of Europe’s Art Treasures and Their Dispersal After World War II (April 2012). “This book explores the formation of the Nazi art collection and the methods used by Goring and his party to strip occupied Europe of a large part of its artistic heritage.”\n\nBahrmann, N., Kunstfund Gurlitt: Wege Der Forschung, (May 2020).
