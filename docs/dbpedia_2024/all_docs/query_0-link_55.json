        "text": "WOMEN: A Century of Change\n\nNational Geographic’s Unparalleled Image Collection\n\nNow – June 30, 2024\n\nVisual Arts Center | Everist Gallery\n\nJoin us as we celebrate trailblazing women who have made it possible to say definitively that the future is female! “WOMEN: A Century of Change” boasts more than 100 images drawn from the National Geographic archives and reveals the lives of women from more than 30 countries from the turn of the 20th century until now. These powerful images are organized into six themes including joy, beauty, love, wisdom, strength and hope. Through these themes, visitors will experience how women around the world have filled their days, been perceived, faced challenges and more.\n\nIn celebration of the Washington Pavilion’s 25th anniversary, we are thrilled to host this powerful traveling exhibition. These iconic and celebrated photographs were taken by renowned National Geographic photographers such as Jodi Cobb, Lynsey Addario, Ami Vitale, Erika Larsen and Steve McCurry.\n\nSponsored by: Sioux Falls Woman’s Alliance Fund of the Sioux Falls Area Community Foundation\n\n\"WOMEN: A Century of Change\" is organized and traveled by the National Geographic Society.\n\nTo mark the 100th anniversary of the U.S. constitutional amendment confirming women’s right to vote in 2019, a powerful exhibition and book from National Geographic showcases iconic women around the world. WOMEN: A CENTURY OF CHANGE illuminates, celebrates and reflects on where the world’s women have been, where they are now and where they are going.\n\nThe exhibition’s stunning photographs, drawn from National Geographic’s unparalleled image collection, span nine decades and feature a myriad of countries. Each image creates a portrait of some aspect of women’s existence and shows exhibition visitors how the depiction of women has evolved since National Geographic’s founding in 1888.\n\nFeaturing additional behind-the-scenes stories from famed female National Geographic photographers, including Lynsey Addario, Jodi Cobb and Ami Vitale, about some of their most arresting images of women, this provocative exhibition examines women’s lifestyles across world cultures, from historic images to the haunting green-eyed “Afghan girl.”\n\nComplementing the exhibition is an additional section: Portraits of Power. These are 24 intimate portraits and biographies of an iconic group of activists, luminaries, politicians and celebrities who were interviewed for the book by National Geographic magazine’s first female editor-in-chief, Susan Goldberg. Among those featured are Oprah Winfrey, Dr. Jane Goodall, gun control activist Emma González, House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.\n\nWOMEN is a compelling, timely and richly diverse exhibition. It honors groundbreaking women everywhere who’ve made it possible to say, definitively, that the future is female.\n\nWoven\n\nArtwork by Chad Nelson and Lindsay Twa\n\nNow – January 28, 2024\n\nVisual Arts Center | Everist Gallery\n\nIncluded in this exhibition are examples of a wide range of printmaking techniques including Mezzotint, Relief Engraving, Woodcut, Linocut and Lithography. Artists Lindsay Twa and Chad Nelson have co-created this exhibition with individual works of art that speak to their unique journeys of self-discovery through struggle and life changes.\n\nSupport for this exhibition was made in part through grants from the Augustana Research and Artist Fund.\n\nArtist Statement: Chad Nelson\n\nI am drawn to printmaking because I am really drawn to a process with an emphasis on drawing and its endless possibilities and methods that push drawing into uncharted places. I also like the idea of multiple originals; I can keep some of my work for myself and children and perhaps sell some of my work, although selling work is never a catalyst for me to create. I like to see how far I can push myself in terms of technique and visualize my thoughts and work through problems. Through this dialog with the images, I sometimes discover things I would have never thought of without visualizing my thoughts and dreams.\n\nMuch of the imagery I begin with has its root loosely based in Nordic Mythology. It's my attempt to connect to the past, culturally, that is the closest thing for me to grab on to as some sort of heritage. After beginning the image, those ideas quickly ebb away as bigger considerations flow in, family, metal health, nature and science. The Nordic thing is just a safe jumping off point for me.\n\nThe pieces selected for this exhibit are a record of my journey over the last couple of years; they are about painful transition from one stage in life to another. My kids have grown up and my marriage faded away. Now I am left empty nested and alone. The question is: now what do I do?\n\nFor the last several years I have included woven lines in my work, and honestly, I don’t know what it means yet. That is one of the wonderful things I like about using symbols and metaphor in my work; my dialog with the work and process sometimes produces revelations about myself and the world that I would not have thought of on my own.\n\nArtist Bio: Chad Nelson\n\nChad Nelson, a printmaker and art educator based in Sioux Falls, is dedicated to both teaching and creating art. He imparts his knowledge as an art teacher at Brandon Valley High School and as a Printmaking instructor at Augustana University. Nelson's artistic achievements extend to national and international portfolio exchanges and exhibitions, showcasing his talent on a global scale.\n\nNelson pursued a Preprofessional Art and Art Education degree at Augustana University and furthered his education through graduate studies at institutions such as Carlton College, University of South Dakota, University of Sioux Falls and Augustana University. His commitment to advancing his skills led him to study under renowned printmakers like Tom Huck, Bill Fick, Art Werger, Deborah Mae Broad, Brett Anderson, Tom Christianson and Oscar Gillespie at Frogman's Press and Workshop.\n\nWhile Mezzotint, Relief Engraving, Woodcut and Linocut printmaking form the core of Nelson's artistic expression, he also delves into the realms of watercolor and silverpoint, continuously exploring new artistic avenues. His work finds representation locally at Rehfeld's Gallery in Sioux Falls and Mesh Gallery in Chicago.\n\nBeyond his personal artistic pursuits, Nelson actively engages in community outreach projects, workshops and collaborative endeavors, frequently partnering with fellow artist Dr. Lindsay Twa. Nelson's commitment to both teaching and creating art as well as his diverse artistic skills and collaborative spirit make him a respected figure in the printmaking community.\n\nArtist Statement: Lindsay Twa\n\nWorking in the studio is a way for me to be mindfully present in the world. The processes of printmaking force me to tackle problems by breaking them into smaller steps. By moving step by step, a little every day, I arrive at a place on a much longer journey. The results are always a blend of what I intended in dialogue with the uncontrollable aspects of printmaking’s techniques and materials. In this way, I open myself up to discovery through struggle.\n\nMany of my images are close-up studies of the natural world: “found images” that have presented themselves in my garden or on my hikes. These help me meditate on environments that allow life to be sustained, to develop and to grow. In another series, I have focused on Brunelleschi’s Dome for Florence Cathedral as a symbol of solutions to seemingly insurmountable problems. Most recently, I have been thinking of my relationship to history and myths and responding by re-telling narratives from a feminist perspective. Whimsy also asserts itself, allowing playfulness to be its own truth.\n\nTo be a printmaker is to be like a percussionist. One has to practice multiple instruments that are quite diverse in their techniques and sounds. For example, the snare drum, marimba and Indian tabla all demand different things of the musician and contribute different characteristic voices. Like a percussionist, I select the printmaking technique based on what the image demands. Some ideas require the bold forms of woodcut, while others need the sensitivity of a direct drawing, which lithography enables. All techniques could take a lifetime (or more!) to master, and some printmakers do indeed choose to specialize in one process.\n\nIncluded in this exhibition are examples of a wide range of printmaking techniques. Currently, my practice gravitates toward lithography and HIP engraving. Lithography involves drawing or painting with a greasy material directly onto a special limestone that is then chemically processed. The printing of a lithograph operates around the science that oil and water do not mix; the stone is kept damp and the printer’s oily ink will go to where you have drawn. HIP engraving, in turn, is a relief carving process that has the advantage of not requiring any chemicals. The artist carves into high-impact polystyrene, a dense plastic, allowing the artist to capture remarkably fine details and textures or, alternatively, bold forms that can produce embossed areas when printed under the high pressure of an etching press. Compare my Daphne’s Story to Bowing Sunflower and you can get a sense of the stylistic range of HIPs engravings. My co-exhibitor and collaborator, Chad Nelson, is a trailblazer in this technique, and he is constantly pushing its potential in detail and scale.\n\nTo be a printmaker is also to be a part of a community that extends back centuries, with knowledge of techniques passed down in an apprenticeship tradition that crosses cultural, national and temporal borders. I stand on the shoulders of so many artists who have gone before me, and alongside so many who serve as my mentors. And there is always more to learn! In the past two years, I have had the opportunity to study at Frogman’s Print Workshop, where I have been introduced to Mokulito, a form of lithography on wood, and Mokihana, a form of Japanese woodcut that is traditionally printed by hand using watercolors. I am eager to see where those new instruments take me.\n\nArtist Bio: Lindasy Twa\n\nDr. Lindsay J. Twa is Professor of Art and Chair of the Humanities Division at Augustana University, where she teaches a wide range of art history courses and leads study abroad experiences to India, London and New York.

Oprah featured Pascale on her Future Rising platform for Black trailblazers, describing her as a “powerhouse woman” who is “actively changing history.” Obama has also praised Pascale’s advocacy work, saying that “she is making a real difference in the world by bringing visibility and voice to the issues concerning women and BIPOC designers.”\n\nPascale has been featured in a variety of publications, including the New York Times, Forbes and NPR. In a profile in Forbes, she was described as “the powerhouse woman ... actively changing history with a simple mission: women and designers of color must claim and be credited for their contributions to the built environment.” In an interview with NPR, Pascale emphasized the importance of the connection between the professionals conceiving and constructing our environments and the people they should serve.\n\nPascale’s impressive career and advocacy work make her an inspiration to architects and activists around the world. Her commitment to diversity, equity and justice is a powerful reminder of the potential of design to create a better world for all people.\n\nAstrographica: Preparations for Space Exploration\n\nPhotography by Wes Eisenhauer and Selections from NASA’s Extensive Image Library\n\nNow – March 31, 2024\n\nVisual Arts Center | University Gallery\n\nWes Eisenhauer explores the endless expanse of the universe and seeks to capture its raw power, innovation and beauty. A Sioux Falls-based photographer, Wes is inspired by our extraordinary world and aims to document it from a unique perspective and with a sense of wonder. Wes' immense talents have led him to photograph for NASA, where he was tasked with creating images to help them celebrate Artemis Day across the country.\n\nThis exhibition is a tribute to humanity’s curiosity and pursuit of understanding the cosmos. As we celebrate the opening of our state-of-the-art Wells Fargo CineDome & Sweetman Planetarium, we also celebrate a local photographer with a particular eye for capturing the stars and are excited to showcase this artistic exploration of cosmic inspiration and wonder.\n\nArtist Statement\n\nIn the endless expanse of the universe, few events stir the human spirit quite like the awe-inspiring spectacle of a NASA/SpaceX launch. Through my lens, I seek to encapsulate the raw power, innovation and profound beauty of these technological marvels as they push the boundaries of what’s possible in space exploration. Each NASA launch represents the culmination of human ingenuity, collaboration and the insatiable thirst for knowledge.\n\nI am humbled by the opportunity to catch a glimpse of the delicate process and showcase the confluence of science and art through my perspective.\n\nOn my trips to these NASA facilities, I was able to witness the dedication, courage and sacrifice etched into the faces of the engineers, scientists and astronauts who make these launches possible. Their commitment to exploration serves as a constant reminder that humanity's reach extends far beyond its grasp, and that we are all merely pieces of the stars themselves.\n\nAs I documented these events, I felt guided by a respect for the pioneers of space exploration whose dreams continue to shape our reality. Through my photographs, I strive to echo their legacy and remind viewers that the quest for knowledge knows no bounds.\n\nIn the end, my photographic journey documenting NASA/SpaceX launches is a tribute to the inherent curiosity that drives humanity to look to the stars and ask, \"What lies beyond?\" Through my lens, I invite others to join me on this journey, to embrace the wonder and possibility of the cosmos and to celebrate the unbreakable spirit of exploration that propels us toward the infinite unknown. - Wes Eisenhauer/Kickturn Studio\n\nAbout the Exhibition\n\nWes Eisenhauer is a Sioux Falls-based photographer who has had the incredible opportunity to document the people and fascinating events of NASA’s facilities. Through these visits he has witnessed the dedication, courage and sacrifice of those who make space exploration possible, as well as the sheer power and energy that goes into a NASA/SpaceX launch. These images remind us that science is not divorced from aesthetics, but rather the visuals act as an integral part of the human endeavor to grasp the mysteries of existence.\n\nWes says about his work: “My photographic journey documenting NASA/SpaceX launches is a tribute to the inherent curiosity that drives humanity to look to the stars and ask, \"What lies beyond?\" Through my lens, I invite others to join me on this journey, to embrace the wonder and possibility of the cosmos and to celebrate the unbreakable spirit of exploration that propels us toward the infinite unknown.”\n\nIn addition to Wes Eisenhauer’s breathtaking photography, there are two photos in this exhibition from NASA’s extensive Image Library. This online gallery is an incredible resource that includes historic images, current missions, astronomy pictures, Earth images, as well as a search engine for educational purposes.\n\nHow to See: A Dialogue Between Landscape and Imagination\n\nArtwork by Molly Noem Fulton and Tom Dempster\n\nNow – April 27, 2024\n\nVisual Arts Center | Bates Trimble Gallery\n\nThis series of work was born out of the spirit of collaboration between two artists that understand the prairie. Tom Dempster and Molly Fulton are South Dakota based artists working in their respective mediums of photography and acrylic paint. Together these collaborative “photo paintings” speak to an expression of what lies beneath the visual senses of the landscape. As Tom said to Molly, “My photographs are going to show you what things look like. I want you to paint on the photographs and show me what’s really there.”\n\nThis series embodies the stillness of the grasslands and hillsides of South Dakota. As Molly says, “This stillness is often referred to in my family as ‘the silent minute.’ Through various connections to land and the encouragement to be outside, we became aware of the silence the landscape provides. We have come to value stillness and allowing ourselves to listen to the land.”\n\nThis “stillness” is clearly at play in the connection of photograph to paint. What Molly adds through paint connects the image to the past, to motion, to pattern in the natural world and to the briefest moments shared with those who’ve gone before us.\n\nThe landscape of South Dakota has a special dialogue with us if we let it. In this silence there is a connection to our deepest imagination and a way of seeing beyond the visible. These photo paintings by Molly Fulton and Tom Dempster bring that imagination to the surface.\n\nArtist Biographies\n\nMolly Fulton is a South Dakota based artist. Her paintings and mixed media works explore the people and places that shape us, forming our identity and values. She works predominantly in gouache and acrylic marker, using repetitive shapes and forms to reflect on individual, familial and societal identity and values.\n\nA graduate of Saint Mary’s College, Notre Dame, Indiana, followed by a Master of Arts degree in instruction from Saint Mary’s University, Winona, Minnesota, Molly and her husband, Neil, live in Vermillion. Their three boys keep the house bubbling with action, and she has chosen to spend her time observing and participating in that action while exploring and growing her art practice.\n\nTom Dempster is a Director of IFAM Capital and a native of Sioux Falls. He served in the South Dakota Senate and the Minnehaha County Commission. He is a University of South Dakota graduate with a bachelor’s degree in economics. He and his wife, Patti, are parents of three daughters, each married to a man they admire and love. They relish their nine grandchildren.\n\nTom is the photographer of Behold, and the author of North of 12th Street, a finalist for Foreward Review’s book of the year. His work has appeared in international, national and local media and in solo gallery exhibitions. He hosted Dakota Heroes, a South Dakota Public Broadcasting documentary earning a national Edward R. Murrow Award. Tom also provides political commentary on Political Junkies, a South Dakota Public Broadcasting program. Tom’s involvement with Rotary, in politics, as a sailor and as a photographer has taken him to many continents and countries throughout the world. Tom has served as chair of the Avera McKennan Hospital board along with many other non-profits. He is one of the founders of the Levitt at the Falls.\n\nTom is working on a new book about the prairie and the sea. His grandfather was a fisherman in Norway’s Arctic Lofoten Islands, as was author Ole Rolvaag, author of Giants in the Earth. He recently was one of six sailors who sailed a 46-foot sailboat across the North Sea into the Lofotens so he could experience the oceans and seas of his grandfather and Rolvaag.\n\nHow to Say Goodbye\n\nArtwork by Amber Hansen\n\nMay 6 – October 30, 2022\n\nVisual Arts Center | Bates Trimble Gallery\n\nAbout the Artist\n\nAmber Hansen is a muralist and visual artist who creates socially engaged and community-based artwork throughout the middle of the U.S. Hansen’s studio work is a dialogue between her formal education and her rural upbringing. She promotes creative engagement for all ages while raising questions about the ethics of animal welfare and our relationship with food. Hansen is the co-director and co-editor of the feature documentary “Called to Walls.” She is an Assistant Professor at the University of South Dakota, where she teaches painting, and the President of the Board of the Community Built Association.\n\nArtist Statement\n\nThis collection of paintings is an ongoing journey that continues to unfold with the passing of time. Fueled by a backlog of sketches, photos and imagery I’ve been saving for several years, I decided it was time to see what stories they tell when brought together, and though this is where the collection stands now, the stories continue to evolve and change.\n\nIn these paintings you will find a reflection of what I’ve gained and lost in the past two years. In the summer of 2020, I buried a lifelong companion—a horse named Autumn that my family and I have raised for 20 years. When I started my journey drawing and painting, horses were often an image I created repeatedly. The practice helped prepare me for Autumn’s departure and has helped me grieve her passing. Her memory will continue to live on in the work you see here and the many works to come.\n\nThe painting standing as a cornerstone of this collection is Ghost Horse. It was the first painting of this series created from an image of a desolate Vermillion playground wrapped in caution tape during the summer of 2020—the height of the pandemic. This painting fuels and guides the artwork that follows it.\n\nAs I grow and learn, the process and the way I create is forever changing. A constant battle of finding new ways of thinking, creating and seeing is a challenge many artists face. I choose to allow the world around me to influence my changing artistic adventures. Embedded in the paintings are scenes of local and regional landscapes that help me process the political and social climate of the surrounding region. In these paintings you will find a reflection of what I have learned over the past years creating artwork as an individual and as a team of artists creating community-based murals.\n\nWhile creating this series, I am reminded that the searching that exists in life, that propels creative thinking and action, is a transformative process. There is knowledge and understanding that can be revealed through the process of creating that can be activated in no other form of learning/remembering.\n\nDonde Nacen Las Palabras:\n\nWhere Words Are Born\n\nArtwork by Hilda Esperanza Langle\n\nJuly 1 – October 2, 2022\n\nVisual Arts Center | Shultz Gallery\n\nABOUT HILDA ESPERANZA LANGLE\n\nHilda Esperanza Langle studied Spanish in Colombia at the Universidad Pedagógica Nacional (1984). In 2003, Esperanza studied fine arts at Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell, S.D.; that year, her work “The Hungry Child” was featured on the poster for the annual McGovern Conference. Esperanza returned to Colombia, her country of origin, to study at the Instituto Caro y Cuervo, where she obtained her master’s degree in Spanish Linguistics in 2009. Esperanza presented her first charcoal exhibit at the Dakota Discovery Museum in Mitchell in fall 2010. “Sustenance” was her visual description of the wool trade of Colombian peasants. Two years later, Esperanza presented “Nature’s Pattern” at the Museum of Visual Materials in Sioux Falls, a pyrography study that followed the secret marks of trees and exposed their hidden stories. Her work “El Arbol De La Vida” (2018) was on permanent exhibit at the Bishop Dudley Hospitality House and was the product of workshops with Lincoln High School students, members of Translators of Culture and the guests at Bishop Dudley. In fall 2021, her abstract wood carving of deformed birds titled “Aviary” was exhibited at the Carver Gallery in Sioux Falls. Esperanza has taught Spanish at primary, secondary and university levels. Her love for art led her to teach it and to participate in the development of the fine arts program for the first fully certified school with the International Baccalaureate Program in Bogotá, Colombia. Today, Esperanza is a teacher at Sonia Sotomayor Elementary, the first Spanish immersion school in South Dakota. During her free time, she also develops workshops to fuse creativity, feelings and language through art. Esperanza loves being a grandmother, a mother, a reader, a dreamer and a painter of words and things.\n\nARTIST STATEMENT\n\nThe spirit of “Donde Nacen Las Palabras” is not only to achieve the relationship of words with things but also to establish the relationship between word, thing, meaning and all the possible experiences that you, the spectator, have of the thing. Therefore, Donde Nacen Las Palabras attempts to bring the semiotic feeling that you have of the thing and trap it in a net behind the words so that you can choose from the plethora of meanings the appropriate one for the occasion. Donde Nacen Las Palabras is a visual recount of my presentation “Grammar, Scope and Sequence as Inclusion to the Spanish Immersion and Dual Language Programs” this year in New York at the NABE International Conference. Donde Nacen Las Palabras is an introduction to grammar without grammatical categories and a presentation of vocabulary that seeks to connect the extreme lover of words to the everyday world around us. Donde Nacen Las Palabras is an interactive exhibit in Spanish with English translation that literally shows you where words are born and takes you through the world of words. Welcome to Donde Nacen Las Palabras.\n\nJune 1 - October 5, 2020\n\nVisual Arts Center | Shultz, Everist and Contemporary Galleries\n\nNotes from the Curator:\n\nThe Visual Arts Center Permanent Collection has a long and rich history, beginning in 1961 with Civic Fine Arts Association and living today with the Washington Pavilion Visual Arts Center. This collection has grown from a few paintings and sculptures to just shy of 1,700 pieces in 2020. The collection of the museum is its mark to the preservation of culture and community. A well-cared-for permanent collection can ensure the enrichment and preservation of a cultural identity for the future generations to learn from and be inspired by.\n\nJudith to Another End, the title of this Permanent Collection exhibition, is both a voyage through time and a practical application of utility. The exhibition aims to give viewers a full breath of the history of arts collection and acquisitions. This exhibition also serves as a valuable intuitional audit of collections allowing the museum to have accurate records and provenance on all objects in the vault.\n\nIt was my great pleasure to live through the work and thoughtfully and carefully organize the works in this exhibition. As you enter the third floor, you are greeted by the Shultz and Young Artists Galleries, each of these housing separate conceptual works. The Shultz Gallery is driven by the work of Jeff Freeman. Jeff’s work is playful and vibrant, his expressive abstractions and precise renderings evoke Freudian concepts and deep subconscious probes. Across the hall you will find a wildlife and landscape room. These works are bound by the use of nature and represent the very essence of prairie life.\n\nWhen you enter the Everist Gallery, I wanted you to feel the experience of walking through time. To your right, you will see the salon style wall. In the center, you will see the Judith painting: object number 1000.01.01, the first chronological piece in the collection. The room is then laid out by conceptual groupings, moving from the very classical works into abstract expressionism and then to figurative works. In the center of the room, you will find the largest amount of works we own by a single artist. In the Contemporary Gallery, I have looked at works that hallmark American expression and evoke the certain indelible rights.\n\nCody Henrichs, MFA\n\nCurator of the Visual Arts Center"
