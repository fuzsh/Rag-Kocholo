        "text": "Providing Continued Value to the Holton Experience\n\nThe Holton-Arms Alumnae Association is comprised of over 6,000 alumnae worldwide. Whether or not you graduated, all are considered alumnae and members of the Alumnae Association.\n\nThe Alumnae Board consists of elected members, across generations of Holton women, representing the entire Holton-Arms Alumnae Association. The Alumnae Board coordinates activities, locally in DC and beyond, that foster alumnae traditions, support, and value to the overall Holton experience.\n\nIn 1994, the Holton-Arms Alumnae Association instituted the Alumnae Scholar Award, an annual award designed to honor an outstanding member of the rising senior class. The awarded student exemplifies Holton’s core values in her pursuit of excellence and initiative both inside and outside of School, from her academic successes to her community involvement. She epitomizes Holton’s motto: \"I will find a way or make one.\"\n\nIn recognition of her accomplishments and contributions to the School, the Alumnae Scholar recipient receives a $15,000 tuition credit towards her senior year at Holton and serves a 1-year term on the Alumnae Board as a student representative. The selection of the Alumnae Scholar is based wholly on merit, not on need. We invite and encourage all interested juniors to apply. Please contact the Director of Alumnae Giving & Engagement, Kate Healy Johnson ’05, 301-365-6005, to receive more information and application materials."
