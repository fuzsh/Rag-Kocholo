        "text": "STS Circle at Harvard\n\nThe STS Circle at Harvard provides a space for weekly conversations about contemporary issues in science and technology that are relevant to fields such as anthropology, history of science, sociology, STS, law, government, public policy, and the natural sciences. Dissertation writers and recent graduates are working on exciting topics that intersect with STS at the edges of their home disciplines. The Circle offers wide exposure to such emerging STS scholarship that otherwise has no forum at Harvard.\n\nThe STS Circle meets weekly during the academic semester. For Spring 2024, all meetings are planned to take place in person on Mondays, from 12:15-2:00 p.m., in CGIS South S050, 1730 Cambridge Street unless otherwise noted. Sandwich lunches will be provided. To receive the abstract and bio for each talk, and to register to attend, please join our mailing list.\n\nThe STS Circle at Harvard is co-sponsored by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, and the Harvard University Center for the Environment.\n\nSpring 2024\n\nJules Gill-Peterson (Johns Hopkins, History)\n\nWho Really Invented Gender?
