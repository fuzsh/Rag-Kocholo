        "text": "June 29, 2024 - August 17, 2024\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery is pleased to present Anna Lukashevsky: The New Immigrants. This is the Haifa-based artist's first exhibition with the gallery. The exhibition will be on view June 29th through August 17th, 2024, with an opening reception on Saturday, June 29th from 4-6pm.\n\nAnna Lukashevsky is interested in the psychological and sociological aspects of the traumatic events, especially in portraits. Over the past two years, she has painted portraits of new immigrants from Russia and Ukraine. Lukashevsky’s subjects abandoned comfortable lives in Russia because their beliefs were no longer tolerated in the place they called home. The cast of artists, writers, journalists, and filmmakers seen in Lukashevsky’s paintings make up a fraction of the 70,000+ Russian and Ukrainian immigrants to Israel, and each portrait relays the subject’s story. As Lukashevsky speaks with her subjects during lengthy portraiture sessions, their experiences transform her images from an archetype to an individual.\n\nThe New Immigrants project began in 2022 with paintings of Russian and Ukrainian immigrants, but after October 7th Lukashevsky was instilled with a desire to capture the emotional impact of Israel’s war against Hamas. These new portraits depict the trauma, depression, and sadness that Israelis have felt since the war with Hamas began. Lukashevsky imbues her paintings with a sense of empathy and fear, portraying an uncertain future and viewing the work as warning signals to the cultural world.\n\nAs an immigrant from the USSR herself, Lukashevsky has felt an intrinsic connection to her subjects, and viewed herself as an outsider in the Israeli cultural world. Lukashevsky is a part of the New Barbizon Group, a collective of five Israeli painters born in the USSR who offer a contemporary version of the tradition of painting en plein air. Following in the footsteps of the 19th century Barbizon School, the artists attempt to hold a mirror to contemporary life and highlight the lived experiences of those around them. In The New Immigrants, Lukashevsky utilizes this philosophy to represent the beauty and trauma of the present through those living in it. By deeply engaging with and sharing the stories of her subjects, the artist humanizes the refugee crisis and the effects of war.\n\nAnna Lukashevsky was born in Vilnius, Lithuania and studied at HaMidrasha Art School, Israel. She has had solo exhibitions at the Haifa Museum of Art, and Bat Yam Museum of Art. Lukashevsky’s work can be found in the collections of the Israel Museum, Jerusalem; Tel Aviv Museum; Haifa Museum, Israel; and numerous private collections.\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery is pleased to present Dinh Q. Lê: Survey 1998-2023. This is the artist’s eighth solo exhibition with the gallery, and the gallery’s first posthumous showing of Lê’s work. Survey 1998-2023 serves as a memorial exhibition celebrating Dinh’s life and legacy. The exhibition will be on view August 27th through October 11th.\n\nSurvey 1998-2023 traces the arc of Lê’s career, beginning with works shown in 1998 at the Los Angeles Center for Photographic Studies and concluding with the artist’s most recent and final works from the Cambodia-Reamker series. Bringing together work from Lê’s series: From Vietnam to Hollywood, Persistence of Memory, A Quagmire This Time, Empire, and Cambodia Reamker, the exhibition foregrounds the artist’s investigations into memory and homeland. It also honors the relationship Dinh had with Shoshana Wayne Gallery, presenting previously exhibited works alongside pieces never shown by the gallery.\n\nThe main exhibition space features a selection of photo-weaving works by Lê, exemplifying the work he was known for. Inspired by a traditional Vietnamese matmaking technique taught to the artist by his aunt, Lê’s woven works exposed contradictions between American depictions and memories of the Vietnam War, and the lived realities of those who experienced it. By uniting disparate images, Dinh exposed western audiences to the reality of the war (called the American War by the Vietnamese people) and the long shadow it cast over his homeland. Hollywood productions, victims of the Khmer Rouge, and archival images of war are some of the many images Lê mined to force viewers to confront these truths.\n\nLê’s 2003 work Mot Coi Di Ve occupies the space of the second gallery, featuring hundreds of prewar family portraits the artist found in Vietnamese secondhand shops. The installation, whose title translates to “spending one's whole life trying to return home” is a series of curtain-like sculptures comprised of woven portraits with fragments of text. The text comes from three sources: the epic Vietnamese poem The Tale of Kieu, excerpts from interviews with Vietnamese-Americans about their experiences, and excerpts from letters from soldiers and their wives during the Vietnam War. The piece hangs from the ceiling of the space, allowing viewers to examine the photographs and read the texts in Vietnamese, Chinese, and English. By appropriating these family photographs almost as if they were his own, Lê intensely personalizes them while generalizing their content, allowing every viewer to share in the heartaches and remembrances and to see in them their own experiences.\n\nSurvey 1998-2023 is the first exhibition of Lê’s work following his death in April 2024, and it showcases a decades-long relationships between the gallery and the artist. This relationship was cultivated by trips to Vietnam over the years, where Lê shared the beauty and culture of his home country, and a mutual collaboration to found San Art. Dinh was not only an incredible artist, but also an incredible human being. His absence is felt by everyone who had the privilege of knowing him.\n\nDinh Q. Lê has exhibited extensively nationally and internationally at prestigious venues including: Hiroshima Museum of Contemporary Art, Japan; Mori Art Museum, Japan; dOCUMENTA (13), Kassell, Germany; and the Venice Biennale, Venice, Italy. Solo exhibitions include: Projects 93: Dinh Q. Lê (MoMA, New York), True Journey Is Return (San Jose Museum of Art, California), Photographing the thread of memory (Musée du Quai Branly, Paris, France), and Memory for Tomorrow (Mori Art Museum, Tokyo, Japan). His work is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Israel Museum, Jerusalem; Fukuoka Asian Art and the Mori Museum in Japan; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and Los Angeles County Museum of Art amongst many others. Lê has been the recipient of the Rockefeller Foundation’s Bellagio Residency Award and the Prince Claus Fund for Cultural and Development amongst others.\n\nMay 18, 2024 - June 22, 2024\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery is pleased to present Zadok Ben-David: From Here, There, and Everywhere. This is the London and Portugal-based artist’s fourth exhibition with the gallery. The exhibition will be on view May 18th through June 22nd, 2024, with an opening reception on Saturday, May 18th from 4-6pm.\n\nFrom Here, There, and Everywhere contains over seventy hand-cut aluminum sculptures from Ben-David’s ongoing series People I Saw But Never Met (2015-present), bringing together a heterogeneous cast of characters based on real people. Each work is inspired by a passerby the artist discreetly photographed while traveling, sketching their likeness before rendering the drawing in aluminum. The installation includes strangers from Europe, the United States, South America, Asia, Australia, and Antarctica in an attempt to chronicle the breadth of the human experience. A metaphor for the diversity of our world’s population, Ben-David’s sculptures materialize our shared humanity, allowing viewers to empathize with strangers from around the globe.\n\nRead More\n\nPeople I Saw But Never Met has travelled the world and grown with each presentation, as the artist adds new figures for each exhibition. The work has been shown in Japan, Portugal, Siberia, Ecuador, Tel Aviv, Australia, and South Korea; and now includes over 8,000 sculptures. During the COVID-19 pandemic, People I Saw But Never Met took on a new meaning, becoming a powerful symbol for humanity’s isolation and communication and demonstrating that we are more alike than different. Work in From Here, There, and Everywhere encompasses the 9+ years of Ben-David’s series, placing early work in conversation with new sculptures.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of environmental disasters, wars, and global crises that threaten humanity’s continued survival, Zadok Ben-David presents a message of optimism and hope. A lack of hierarchy between the sculptures gives dignity and respect towards every stranger whose likeness is captured, regardless of origin. Ben-David believes communication and empathy are the solution to many of the problems humanity faces, and the installation visualizes human beings as a collective, emphasizing that our similarities are greater than our differences.\n\nZadok Ben-David lives and works in London and Portugal. He has exhibited extensively throughout Europe and Asia including: Itchimbia Cultural Center, Ecuador; Kew Gardens, London; Centro de Arte Contemporanae Graca Morais, Bragança, Portugal; Kenpoku Art Festival, Irabaki Prefecture, Japan; The Art Gallery of Uzbekistan, Tashkent; Singapore Botanical Gardens; and The Tel Aviv Museum amongst many others.\n\nBen-David has participated in group exhibitions, biennials, and museum shows worldwide including recently at The Kröller-Müller Museum, Netherlands; Arts Maebashi, Japan; and Breda Photo Biennial, Netherlands (2020). Additionally, the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice, Italy; The Israel Museum, Jerusalem; Cerveira Internatonal Art Biennale Cerveira, Cerveira, Portugal (2022, 2020); Busan Biennial, South Korea (2010); Wonder Singapore Biennale, Singapore (2008); and the Venice Biennale, Italy (1988). His art can be found in the collections of museums and public sites across Europe, East Asia, Australia and America including: Guangdong Museum of Art, Guangzhou, China; the Israel Museum, Jerusalem; and The Kröller-Müller Museum, Netherlands; among others.\n\nFebruary 3, 2024 - March 29, 2024\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery is pleased to present The Gravity of Color by Rachel Lachowicz. This is the Los Angeles-based artist’s eighth solo exhibition with the gallery. The exhibition will be on view February 3rd through March 29th, 2024, with an opening reception Saturday, February 3rd from 4-6pm.\n\nLachowicz’s newest body of work utilizes materiality as a lens to examine our reality through color and geometric abstraction. Materiality has been a through line in Lachowicz’s work, and through her use of cosmetics the artist attempts to break down strict and outdated binaries of gender. Where previous works have addressed these topics through direct representation and interpretations of the western art historical canon, Lachowicz has shifted her focus to geometric abstraction in an effort to make sense of the systems and laws which define our existence.\n\nRead More\n\nMany of the works in The Gravity of Color were born from the artist’s interest in quantum physics and cosmology, and showcase a desire to illustrate the intangible. Works like Time (2024), Deep Weave (2024), and Radiofrequency (2024) are abstract representations of longitudinal waves, multiverse theory, and radiofrequency radiation. Depicting these monumental ideas through her signature medium of pressed-eyeshadow allows Lachowicz to examine them at a granular level, shifting the scale to something relatable. Etymology further strengthens a connection between cosmetics and cosmology, as both words share the Greek root of cosmos/kosmos. This shared root roughly translates to ‘order’ or ‘proper arrangement’ and by representing the forces which order our universe through makeup, Lachowicz illuminates and strengthens these connections.\n\nLachowicz’s engagement in geometric abstraction and desire to experiment with materials situates her in a lineage of California artists stretching back to the 1950’s. Abstract eyeshadow pieces in the gallery’s main space are reminiscent of works by Southern California’s Abstract Classicists, while also drawing inspiration from Victor Vasarely and Joseph Albers. In the second gallery, Lachowicz has created two sculptures: Granularity of Space (2024) and Packets of Light (Yellow Field) (2024), which feature powder-coated eyeshadow tins. The two works evoke the Finish Fetish movement of the 1960’s, but the artist’s decision to combine cosmetic tins with industrial material puts a feminist spin on this male-dominated movement. While previous exhibitions sought to directly recreate iconic works of art, works in The Gravity of Color are wholly original outputs.\n\nMaterial relationships lie at the center of Lachowicz’s newest pieces, and by showing the links between paint and cosmetics the artist further blurs the line between the two. While materiality has always been central to her practice, recent work sees Lachowicz taking this interest a step further and creating ‘hybrid’ pieces that combine lipstick and oil paint. These are unlike the lipstick-coated canvases and sculptures present in past bodies of work, and appear closer to gestural works of abstract painting than anything Lachowicz has created before. Powder-coating sculptures of enlarged eyeshadow tins furthers the artist’s explorations of material relationships, as Lachowicz sees a link between the industrial practice and her use of eyeshadow powder as paint. A guiding principle of Lachowicz’s work is her use of ‘other’ materials, which she sees as a way to ‘other’ her oeuvre within the art world due to the materials she employs. In The Gravity of Color, Lachowicz continues to make a case for the inclusion of cosmetics as a form of painting, and demonstrates how structurally similar the two mediums are.\n\nAs Lachowicz investigates the makeup of our universe in her signature medium of lipstick and eyeshadow, she represents larger-than-life ideas on a human scale. Varying relationships between scale lie at the heart of The Gravity of Color, and by shedding light on these relationships Lachowicz helps viewers ask philosophical and scientific questions about the nature of our existence. The eyeshadow dust that comprises the colors in Lachowicz’s work is not unlike the cosmic dust which forms our universe, and illustrating this allows us to see the gravity that color holds.\n\nRachel Lachowicz (b. 1964) lives and works in Santa Monica, CA. She received a BFA from California Institute of the Arts and is currently a professor of studio art at Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, CA. Her work is currently included in ‘Inner Worlds: Sigmund Freud and Art’ at Kunsthalle Tübingen in Tübingen, Germany. Lachowicz has exhibited extensively in the United States and abroad, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Denver Art Museum; ICA, London; Benaki Museum, Athens; AKG Art Museum, Buffalo, NY; Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts Museum, Tianjin, China; The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, Israel; MIT List Visual Arts Center, Cambridge, MA; New Museum, New York City; Museum moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig Wien, Vienna, Austria; Museum of Modern Art, New York; and the Venice Bienanale (1993). Her work can be found in the collections of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Israel Museum, Jerusalem; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, CA; The Denver Art Museum, Denver, CO; the Perez Art Museum Miami, Miami, FL, among many others.\n\nDecember 2, 2023-January 27, 2024\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery is pleased to announce Storyteller Yellow, Jiha Moon’s first solo exhibition with the gallery. Storyteller Yellow will be on view from December 2, 2023 through January 27, 2024, with an opening reception on Saturday, December 2, 2023 from 4-6 PM.\n\nJiha Moon’s ceramics and painting draw from Korean folklore, Western contemporary art, and popular culture to create hybrid forms with a vibrant and personal visual language. Born in Daegu, South Korea and recently moving to Tallahassee, Florida after living in Atlanta for 18 years, Moon’s iconography speaks to the complexity of human experience in a globalized world where images are easily shared and recontextualized. She is a cartographer of cultures and an icon maker of cultural landscapes, including symbols from American and Korean culture to produce works that look both familiar and unconventional. In Storyteller Yellow, Moon’s visual vocabulary includes dumplings, fortune cookies, peach, Haetae, banana peels, Pennsylvania Dutch folk art, Milagro, and fireworks along with images of the artist’s son and pets to connect these motifs to her personal history. Embracing contrasting ideas and imagery is a way for Moon to subvert commonly held stereotypes of Asian and Asian-American communities, instead celebrating Asian culture by putting traditional symbols in conversation with emblems of contemporary pop-culture.\n\nRead More\n\nThe title Storyteller Yellow is drawn from Moon’s interest in the color yellow, which she investigates in both aesthetic and racialized contexts. Moon uses yellow for its “social, political, or cultural point of view,” acknowledging an association between the color and racial slurs towards Asian-Americans. Through abundant and prominent uses of yellow in her work, Moon subverts biases against the color and transforms yellow into a point of joy. The blossoms of chrysanthemums, broad strokes of yellow dancing between visual references to landscape painting, the inclusion of a banana peel stretching across a canvas, and the bold use of yellow as a vibrant base become points of exuberance in these works. By centering and celebrating yellow, the color becomes a piece of conversation through Moon’s work, forcing viewers to acknowledge its presence and conjure positive associations with yellow, such as sunshine.\n\nMoon’s work acknowledges the multicultural world taking shape around us, and her mixing of iconography asks the viewer to reflect on how art and society can benefit from this fusion. Posing the question of where someone or something “comes from” is not simple – and often times not important – in the 21st century. All of the works in Storyteller Yellow push the boundaries of categorization, inhabiting many identities at once and reflecting the diversity of experiences and cultures in our world.\n\nJiha Moon (b. 1973) lives and works in Tallahassee, Florida. She received a BFA from Korea University, Seoul, an MFA from Ewha Woman’s University, Seoul, and an MFA from the University of Iowa. She is currently an assistant professor in the Department of Art at Florida State University, Tallahassee. Moon is a 2023 John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellow in Fine Arts. She has exhibited in museums and galleries internationally including the Asian Art Museum, San Fransico, CA; Renwick Gallery, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington DC; FSU Museum of Fine Arts, Tallahassee, FL; Crystal Bridges Museum, Bentonville, AR; and The Fabric Workshop and Museum, Philadelphia, PA. Her work is in the collections of the Asian Art Museum, San Fransico, CA; Renwick Gallery, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington DC; High Museum, Atlanta, GA; Asia Society and Museum, New York, NY; Mint Museum, Charlotte, NC; and Chrysler Museum of Art, Norfolk, VA, among many others.\n\nSEPTEMBER 23 - NOVEMBER 22, 2023\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery is pleased to announce tomorrow is just a thought, Terri Friedman’s third solo exhibition with the gallery. tomorrow is just a thought will be on view from September 23 through November 22, 2023, with an opening reception on Saturday, September 23 from 4-6 PM.\n\nTerri Friedman’s work responds to internal and external uncertainty through woven tapestries. Seeing the act of weaving as a unification of warp and weft – or left and right brain – Friedman attempts to weave new neural pathways on her loom and in her brain, combatting a climate of anxiety and instability with fiber. The human brain is wired for negativity and catastrophe, with our fight or flight responses being our first reaction to anxiety. Neuroplasticity and the brain’s ability to repair neural pathways has informed Friedman’s work. If tomorrow is just a thought, then Friedman encourages viewers to ask themselves ‘what can go right?’ instead of considering what will go wrong.\n\nRead More\n\nThe work presented in tomorrow is just a thought explores the relationship between mind and body, considering the effects brain chemistry has on creating elevated emotional states and utilizing color, fiber, language, and abstract gestures to activate chemicals like Serotonin, Endorphins, Dopamine, and Oxytocin. Cultivating these elevated states and happy hormones is a political and personal weapon for Friedman that serves as barrier against indulging in despair. Though not representational or figurative, the work is imbued with an organic quality: orifices, uvulas, eyes, intestine-like cords, veins, and hair are primary in the work. Holes and cracks within the work allow light to penetrate each piece.\n\nWeaving has become an extension of Friedman’s practice of exploring methods of painting without using paint. In previous bodies of work the artist explored painting through the use of everyday material, and Friedman brings her experience in painting, kinetic sculpture, and installation to the loom. Her meticulous process begins by drawing a work on her iPad and selecting fibers before weaving. These “yarn paintings” undermine a traditional hierarchy of materials, incorporating objects like painted piping, hemp cords, and stained glass with naturally dyed wools and acrylic threads. The warp and weft of these threads carry equal importance, as the artist embeds stripes or plaid into each piece. By strategically placing fibers of varying thickness and texture, Friedman creates pieces that appear multi-layered and borrow from other artistic practices: black lines allude to the solder of stained glass while disparate patterns placed side by side recall quilting techniques.\n\nLanguage and color are employed in Friedman’s work to create somatic posters of urgency. Words like ‘heal’ ‘alive’ and ‘refresh’ can be found in these pieces, alongside a palate of acid yellows, dirty ochres, reds whites and blues, and hot pinks that envelop and camouflage their meaning, acting as a suggestion rather than a lecture. Friedman is drawn to abstraction because it “creates the most powerful picture of the unexplainable and unknowable.” It allows the artist to make sense of personal and world events, exploring places where the political and emotional bodies intersect. A response to anxiety, anger, and grief; each weaving is an agitated yet affirmative scream.\n\nTerri Friedman lives and works in El Cerrito, California. She is Associate Professor at the California College of the Arts where she has taught both undergraduate and graduate students for the past two decades. Born in Colorado, Friedman received her BA with Honors from Brown University and MFA from Claremont Graduate School. She has exhibited nationally and internationally at venues including the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; The Contemporary Jewish Museum, San Francisco; CUE Art Foundation, New York City; CODA Museum, Netherlands; Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley; the San Jose Museum of Art; Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco; John Michael Kohler Arts Center, Sheboygan, Wisconsin; and Orange County Museum of Art, Costa Mesa, California. Friedman has received numerous awards including The San Francisco 2021 Artadia Award, Facebook Artist in Residence, CUE Art Foundation Grant, Santa Barbara Arts Fund Grant, Wallace Alexander Gerbode Foundation Grant, Albin Polesak Award. In 2022 the De Young Museum acquired her seminal work ‘ENOUGH’ (2021).\n\nAUGUST 5th - SEPTEMBER 15th\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery is pleased to announce It Ain’t Necessarily Soft, Gil Yefman’s first solo exhibition with the gallery. It Ain’t Necessarily Soft will be on view from August 5 through September 15, 2023, with an opening reception on Saturday, August 5 from 4-6 PM. The exhibition will be accompanied by a series of performances and walkthroughs, including a conversation between Gil Yefman and Norman Kleeblatt, former chief curator of the Jewish Museum (New York, NY), on August 10.\n\nIn his debut solo exhibition at Shoshana Wayne Gallery, Yefman exhibits sculptural and two-dimensional installations created over the past decade. Yefman’s practice explores a unique artistic language defined by brightly colored knitted sculptures of grotesque, fluid, multi-organ beings. The knitted work becomes an extension of the body, and felting becomes a memorialization of the experiences held within that body. Though knitting and felting are commonly associated with female, queer, and domestic tasks that would traditionally fall into a strictly decorative category, Yefman redefines them into works that honor a memory within the individual to provide a sense of justice and new presence in the world. These soft objects that were once read as defense mechanisms representing a vulnerable or threatened body are transformed into a new relationship with social injustices.\n\nRead More\n\nIn Yefman’s work, there is a constant state of transformation – of an interdependence between history, memory, and imagination – which contributes to the remission of personal and social hurt. At the center of this investigation into transformation is Tumtum (2013), a crocheted sculpture which hangs from the gallery’s ceiling. The work’s title originates from a pre-medical biblical term used to describe the gender of an individual with ambiguous genitalia. However, in modern Hebrew the term is a common curse referring to stupidity. Yefman’s sculpture investigates the evolution of the term, positing that the contemporary meaning may be the result of political agendas of separation and control, coding non-binary forms of identity as transgressive. Throughout It Ain’t Necessarily Soft, Tumtum will be activated by artist performances.\n\nIt Ain’t Necessarily Soft draws attention to the relationship between fiber arts and language by emphasizing the textual and narrative sources embedded in Gil Yefman’s artistic objects. The words “text” and “texture,” which share the same root, emphasize the crossing and interweaving of personal, mythological, historical, and political narratives in his work. Identities dissolve and reappear in constant flux, from the particular to the universal. Yefman’s work points to the continued existence of identities that have been ‘othered’ throughout history, connecting echoes of the past to today’s political landscape.\n\nThe uncanny, and even romantic, nature of the nostalgia exemplified in Yefman’s work is both familiar and strange, standing in contrast to human nature. It Ain’t Necessarily Soft presents a body of work both grounded in history and looking forward. It demands a new relationship to difficult realities of the past, and requires that something beautiful must be made from that pain.\n\nGil Yefman (b. 1979) lives and works in Tel Aviv. He earned his BFA at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, Jerusalem, Israel and was a recipient of a two-year fellowship from Alma College for Hebrew Culture Studies, Tel Aviv, Israel. Yefman was the 2017 recipient of the Rappaport Prize for a young Israeli artist, and has completed residencies at the ISCP, Brooklyn, NY; Aomori Contemporary Art Center, Japan; and the 18th Street Arts Center, Santa Monica, CA. Recent solo exhibitions include the Tel Aviv Museum of Art (2018) and Haifa Museum, Israel (2017-18). Yefman’s work has been included in group shows at the Weatherspoon Museum of Art, Greensboro, NC; the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, Israel; The Jewish Museum, New York City; Espace culturel Louis Vuitton, Paris, France; and MOCA Museum, Taipei, Taiwan; among others. His work can be found in the permanent collections of The Jewish Museum, New York, NY; The Rubell Family Collection, Miami, FL; The Tel Aviv Museum, Israel; The Herzliya Museum, Israel; Shocken Collection, Tel Aviv, Israel; and Bronner Family Collection, Düsseldorf, Germany.\n\nJUNE 10th - JULY 22nd 2023\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery is pleased to announce Frock-Conscious, Elaine Reichek’s 5th solo exhibition with the gallery. Frock-Conscious will be on view from June 10 through July 22, 2023, with an opening reception on Saturday, June 10 from 2:00–5:00 PM.\n\nFrock-Conscious explores the relationship between textiles and painting through nearly 50 works produced over the past 5 years. Although the exhibition is primarily grounded in Reichek’s signature medium of embroidery, it also expands spatially to restage the studio itself as a blended site of artistic production, domestic life, intergenerational conversation, and critical investigation.\n\nRead More\n\nIn the large gallery is a salon-style installation of 24 embroideries, featuring images of clothing or textiles that Reichek has appropriated from a wide assortment of paintings, drawings, and designs. Collectively these art-historical sources — ranging from Michelangelo to Kerry James Marshall — read like an associative mini-survey of the artistic pleasures and challenges in rendering costume, drapery, and pattern. Whether full-bodied or a tight crop, each image has been re-created entirely in thread, by either digital or hand-sewing techniques. Reichek thus engineers a cyclical translation of depicted fabric back into actual material, as well as a conceptual inversion of the distinctions between the fine arts and craft.\n\nReichek’s investigation of the semiotic repertoire of fabric also examines its function as a second skin, whether through haptic textures or with an embroidered text that conjures the erotics of touch. Coding is another through-line, as she compares darning patterns to Sol LeWitt’s systems- work seriality.\n\nThe largest works in the exhibition, JP Textile/Text 1 and 2, reimagine Jackson Pollock’s legacy as a collision of metaphors and materials. Each unfurls a considerable length (12 and 17 feet, respectively) of fabric commercially printed in 2 colorways with a pseudo-Pollock pattern — Spatter, by Kravet Inc. — over which Reichek has digitally sewn 25 citations selected from Pollock’s critical bibliography. Each citation is embroidered in a distinct typeface and appears randomly at least 3 times in each work, as Reichek cheekily literalizes the idioms “an embroidered reputation” and “art by the yard.”\n\nRounding out this associative exploration of the repressed connections between Pollock and the decorative is a triptych of 3 silk charmeuse scarves that reproduce Cecil Beaton’s 1951 photoshoot, for Vogue, of models in couture gowns posing against Pollock’s drip paintings at Betty Parsons Gallery.\n\nThe small gallery space stages a conversational installation devoted to Henri Matisse and the Bloomsbury artists Vanessa Bell, Duncan Grant, and Roger Fry. Although Matisse profoundly influenced the Bloomsbury artists, their entrepreneurial efforts actually anticipated his own forays into commercial decoration and textiles by nearly two decades. Along the right as one enters, 4 embroideries reflect on the Bloomsbury artists’ sustained engagement with fabrics and patterns, both in their paintings and through their short-lived but influential design business, Omega Workshops. Reichek also displays 2 dresses sewn from Omega fabrics (now marketed by The Charleston Trust) featuring painterly patterning by Bell and Grant. Both dresses are made in a modern high-waisted, corset-free style, for which Bell herself was widely known within her social milieu. To each is pinned an embroidered remembrance of Bell’s fashion sensibility from her daughter, Angelica, and her granddaughter Henrietta, respectively.\n\nIn a similar spirit of cross-pollination, Un petit salon après Matisse is a staged mashup of current-day commercial product adapted from Matisse’s work, intermixed with vintage items that evoke his extensive and eclectic personal collection of textiles and furniture. A double-sided green-velvet folding screen, entitled Screen Time with Matisse, serves as a kind of Warburgian atlas of printed archival images, assorted fabric swatches, and miscellaneous merch. And in another related mode of deconstruction, Scattered “Sheaf” with Felt and Fabric reimagines Matisse’s 1953 ceramic tile mural The Sheaf as fabric cut-outs pinned around a tricolor, imitation-block-print floral pattern.\n\nAs Reichek brings each new round of conceptual and material repartee back to her own artistic production, she reveals herself as both subject and object, maker and viewer, fan and critic, engaged in an ever-renewing reflective dialogue.\n\nElaine Reichek (b. 1943) lives and works in New York. She received a BA from Brooklyn College and a BFA from Yale University. She has exhibited extensively in the US and abroad, with solo exhibitions at Secession, Vienna; the Palais des Beaux Arts, Brussels; the Tel Aviv Museum; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; The Jewish Museum, New York; Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus, OH; Stichting De Appel, Amsterdam; and the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin. Her work is in the collections of New York’s Whitney Museum of American Art, Museum of Modern Art, and Jewish Museum; The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum; the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts Museum, Philadelphia; Menil Collection, Houston, TX; Dallas Museum of Art; Spencer Museum of Art, University of Kansas; and the Irish Museum of Modern Art in Dublin, among others. Reichek’s work was included in Joan Didion: What She Means at the Hammer Museum in 2022; Venedigsche Sterne at the Bündner Kunstmuseum, Chur, Switzerland, in 2022; Art_Textiles at the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, UK, in 2015; Art/Histories at the Museum der Moderne, Salzburg, in 2014; the 2012 São Paulo Biennial in Brazil; and the 2012 Whitney Biennial.\n\nMARCH 4th - APRIL 22nd, 2023\n\nIn the third of three innovative exhibitions featuring pairs of artists whose work is sometimes overtly, sometimes inadvertently linked through the intimacies of living together, Shoshana Wayne Gallery highlights the paintings of Chie Fueki and the paintings and drawings of Joshua Marsh.\n\nRead More\n\nChie Fueki\n\nIf one of the ways in which we’ve exacerbated the environmental crisis has to do with assumed hierarchies in which animals, plants, and the objects of the earth are valued principally for how they serve human beings, the so-called apex species, then Chie Fueki’s art is tonic— and timely. The filmmaker Agnès Varda once noted that “If we opened people up, we would find landscapes.” Fueki’s paintings, in which the outlines of human figures can contain green leaves or midnight blues, is a case in point. Made during the pandemic in the especially lambent light of dawn or gloaming, Fueki’s new body of work radiates emotional tones that twine longing and pathos.\n\nHuman figures, architectural graphics, symbols, and pattern fields coexist as a pluralistic, integrated painted organism. Pervading her figurations are radiant lines of energy, colorful swaths of abstract ornamentation, and variant but simultaneous perspectives. None is more central or more important than the others. There is even a democracy of material and method in Fueki’s approach to art making. What we call her painting is really a collaborative endeavor between wood panels, mulberry paper, glue, rubbings, drawing, collage, brushwork, pour, and acrylic paint. The realms we often assign to “inside”— our emotions, for instance, or our living room— and “outside”— the landscape, other people— have no clear boundaries in Chie’s work; they are one and the same. In most of the paintings in this show, inside— Fueki’s Hudson Valley apartment with its many curiosities— and outside— Mt. Beacon in the near distance—present themselves in an alliance with decorative motifs. The result is a radical, non-logocentric realism, where objects, figures, world, imagination, ornament, and lines of energy harmonize in a multi-perspectival mutuality we might recognize as actual experience.\n\nJoshua Marsh\n\nA body of Joshua Marsh’s small— 5” X 4”—graphite drawings share their image repertoire with two sets of paintings roughly five times the size of the drawings. In both, we see still life arrangements of apples, spools of thread, flasks, skulls, drawers, pipes, a bee, occasional scrawled words, and curious image rhymes that link, for instance, the springy wire doodle in one image with the curlicue hairs of a satyr’s soul-patch in another. There are also more ambiguous objects and shadows or ghosts of objects, and nascent faces— and we’re given (by their titles) to connect them to the Faust legend, that drama of lust for knowledge and pleasure, and its tragic repercussions. Often, it seems as though an object is appearing playfully next to the idea it generates. The congeries of images unsettle us; we don’t know how to categorize their roles in this context of conflicted relations. Rather than sating our desire for immediate satisfaction, Marsh’s work insistently introduces strategies of incongruity, perspectival and graphemic play, humor, and restraint that end up intensifying the fulfillment of our looking.\n\nThe acrylic paintings generally hew to a color palette of brown, green, grey and blue, with the blues sometimes enacting contradictory perspectives, morphing between sky-like space and the clearer shape of an object. The ambiguities invite our extended attention as our eyes restlessly negotiate the intervallic leaps between conventional (skulls), personal (pipes), and inscrutable (cubes) object-symbols. What invests those symbols with significance is repetition and secrecy. In Marsh’s visual panoramas, our encounters with various symbols offer us the peculiar sense of wild disjunction tempered by meticulous detail. They are never a means for arriving at some predetermined, politically expedient, or instrumental supposition. Instead, we find that we keep coming across human absence and human trace: what we find in the paintings are hauntings.\n\nWe see the trace of the human, for instance, in the assemblages of flasks, vapors, and scale levers that are missing their Faustian alchemist. If Faust used alchemy to arrive at answers, Marsh is drawn to alchemy because he’s fascinated by questions, by the processes of transformation. What do we witness in his still lifes but mutability, the apples rotting, the blocks melting into biomorphic shapes. Marsh’s still lifes aren’t still at all. While we watch, they are turning into landscapes.\n\nABOUT THE ARTISTS\n\nChie Fueki (b. 1973) lives and works in Beacon, NY. Fueki was born in Yokohama, Japan, and raised in São Paulo, Brazil.

Fascinated by the appearance of the city from her family’s apartment, Chie would often stand by the window entranced by the patterns, structures, lights, fog and traffic movements of the city. Joshua grew up in Pennsylvania, where he often dwelt around streams, observing the flows, reflections, and intersecting processes that have remained inquiries within his work. Maintaining neighboring studios in all the places they have lived and worked, Chie and Joshua have continuously engaged in close artistic conversation, intertwining interests while exploring their distinct practices.\n\nWritten by Forrest Gander\n\nClick here for the full PDF\n\nJANUARY 14th - FEBRUARY 25th, 2023\n\nIn the second of three innovative exhibitions featuring pairs of artists whose work is sometimes overtly, sometimes inadvertently linked through the intimacies of living together, Shoshana Wayne Gallery highlights the artwork of Ashwini Bhat and the poetry of Forrest Gander. Bhat and Gander’s work will be on view until February 25th, 2023, with an opening reception on January 14th from 2pm to 5pm.\n\nRead More\n\nAshwini Bhat grew up in rural, South India where she trained in a 2000-year-old dance form, Bharatanatyam, before coming to tour internationally with a contemporary Indian dance company. Her tumultuous, color-dappled ceramic sculptures relate the fire-and-earthquake-altered landscape of her adopted home, California, to female nature spirits of India. Bhat says she learned from dance how to keep her energy rippling and visible, even when her body is still, and only when her sculptures do the same does she think of them as finished. The large sculptures, which dominate the first room at Shoshana Wayne, appear to have been heaved upward from the earth, twisting, turbulent, merging sensual corporeality with tectonic drama. It’s as though the human body and the geologically active California landscape have become one thing. The smaller works in the second room bring into play thread— used in India to assign sacrality to objects— and Calla Lilies, symbols of regeneration whose orange-yellow spadices contain both male and female flowers in a spiral pattern. Bhat’s labor-intensive process involves the manipulation of soft clay slabs directly over her own body in an act of transformation and translation. She says the work in this show “responds to the phenomenon of the rift, the rupture, and the renewal of nature, body, clay, and self.” Her practice, and its attentive focus on the mutuality between human and non-human, comes to serve as a radical revision of our exploitative and transactional relation to a world of complex interrelationships.\n\nForrest Gander’s poems appear in both rooms of the show, in the first as a kind of word-detritus strewn along the central rift of a fault zone created by the sculptural components of Bhat’s wall installation, and then— in the second room— as vinyl text on the walls and in an invocational lenticular print. Gander, who has a degree in geology and a long practice as an ecological writer, traveled with Ashwini Bhat exploring many sections of the 800-mile-long San Andreas Fault. Each short poem, with its left margins stepped to enact the horizontal movement of a strike-slip fault, hovers behind a sculpture “perhaps like,” he says, “the low rumbling vibration that accompanies an earthquake.”\n\nBoth Bhat and Gander are interdisciplinary collaborators whose lives are intertwined by their mutual interest in ecology and place, emphasizing species interconnectedness. They live in the foothills of the Sonoma Mountains in northern California.\n\nABOUT THE ARTISTS\n\nAshwini Bhat grew up in Southern India, studied literature and classical Indian dance, and later traveled the world as part of the radical modernist Padmini Chettur dance company. After sustaining injuries, she began working with clay and apprenticed with the architect and ceramicist Ray Meeker in Pondicherry. Bhat works in sculpture, ceramics, installation, video, and performance to develop a unique visual language exploring the intersections between body and nature, self and other. She’s the recipient of fellowships from the Howard, the Pond Farm Julia Terr, and the McKnight Foundations. Her work has been exhibited nationally & internationally and can be found in collections at the Newport Art Museum, USA; Shigaraki Ceramic Cultural Park, Japan; FuLe International Ceramic Art Museum, China; the Watson Institute at Brown University, USA; New Bedford Historical Society, USA; Daugavpils Mark Rothko Centre, Latvia; and in many private collections.\n\nForrest Gander, a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and translator with degrees in geology and literature, was born in the Mojave Desert. His books, often concerned with ecology, include Twice Alive; Be With; and The Trace, a novel hailed as one of fifteen recent books that have “revived America’s Quintessential Genre, The Western.” Among Gander’s many translations are It Must Be a Misunderstanding by Coral Bracho, Spectacle & Pigsty by Kiwao Nomura (Best Translated Book Award), and Then Come Back: the Lost Poems of Pablo Neruda. Gander frequently collaborates with artists, including Sally Mann, Graciela Iturbide, Ann Hamilton, Eiko & Koma, Kay Rosen, and Jack Shear. He has received grants from the Library of Congress, the Guggenheim, Howard, Whiting, and United States Artists Foundations.\n\nWritten by Forrest Gander\n\nClick here for the full PDF\n\nClick here to WATCH the walkthrough with Ashwini Bhat and art historian Jenni Sorkin\n\nOCTOBER 29th - DECEMBER 22nd, 2022\n\nIn the first of three innovative exhibitions featuring pairs of artists whose work is sometimes overtly, sometimes inadvertently linked through the intimacies of living together, Shoshana Wayne Gallery highlights the paper constructions of Rakuko Naito and the paintings of Tadaaki Kuwayama. Naito and Kuwayama’s work will be on view until December 22nd, 2022, with an opening reception on October 29th from 2 to 5pm.\n\nRead More\n\nThe auras radiated by Tadaaki Kuwayama’s smooth-surfaced paintings transform rooms and routine experience. They meet the eye with peaceable intensity. They are, perhaps, as much objects as gestures— if there were gestures equivalent to someone extending their mind like a hand. If you look at Kuwayama’s evenly-hued paintings for thirty seconds and think you’ve seen them, let yourself look longer. Look for three minutes and the color begins to adjust— like a body shifting its weight. If you’re standing directly before the painting and you take a step to the left or right, the aluminum strips between panels wink at you. Then lighter swaths of color suggest themselves in what you took, at first glance, to be sustained monochrome; other panels seem to darken ever so slightly. Or is this a trick of the mind or the light as your eyes keep pulling toward the center of the four-panel square, toward the hub, the cynosure? The gravity is strongest there. You feel its pull, its invitation. The subtlety of the painting draws you as a chimney is said to draw, at once into its color field and into yourself.\n\nIn another part of the gallery, we find Rakuko Naito’s boxed paper assemblages. One looks like the cross- cut of a hive or a bed of ooliths. Another like white cocktail umbrellas pressed flat. One like a constellation of baby octopus suckers. Another looks like a handmade Japanese go game board. Still another like the silence of a Phillip Glass composition playing in your head. Like and like and like. And yet, Naito’s art is gloriously independent of analogy. There is no nature, no narrative, no figure, no line, no colors, no titles. Her art doesn’t provoke likeness so much as it enacts its own distinct, insistent mode of intoxication. A signal blend of imagination and labor. Naito’s lushly exacting, iterative work is a paean to the hand and eye, and to the joy of repetition. Finger-torn and delicately arranged, her pieces of mulberry-bark paper take on the gorgeous rigor of the Fibonacci number sequence. Pressing outward, toward the edges of the white frames that contain them, Naito’s constructions give no quarter. Because there is no foreground or background, every element is equally essential. Her method, then, involves the highest degree of risk per unit of space. Every aspect is alert, on point.\n\nABOUT THE ARTISTS\n\nTogether, Rakuko Naito and Tadaaki Kuwayama immigrated from Japan to the United States in the late 1950’s and quickly found their place in New York City’s artistic avant-garde. Naito, the daughter of a doctor and amateur architect, has long worked abstractly using mulberry bark paper colored with plant pigmentation. Kuwayama’s large metallic color paintings, critically celebrated since his first New York shows in the 1960’s, rigorously upend conventional painting techniques and ambitions as they instigate an impervious aesthetic concentration.\n\nNaito and Kuwayama live and work in New York City. Naito received her BFA from Tokyo National University of Art in Tokyo, Japan in 1958. She has exhibited in museums and galleries internationally, including the Tokyo International Biennale; Karuizawa New Art Museum, Karuizawa, Japan; and Museo D’arte Contemporanea, Rome, Italy. Naito’s work can be found in the permanent collections of San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, CA; Voorlinden Museum, Wassenaar, Netherlands; Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ; Museo de Arte Contemporaneo, Buenos Aires, Argentina; and The Larry Aldrich Museum, Ridgefield, CT.\n\nKuwayama received his BFA in painting from Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, Tokyo, Japan in 1956. He has exhibited in museums and galleries internationally, including The Museum Modern Art, Hayama, Kanagawa, Japan; The National Museum of Art, Osaka, Japan; and Rupertinum Museum, Salzburg, Austria.Kuwayama’s work can be found in the permanent collections of Guggenheim Museum, New York City, NY, USA; 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa, Japan; Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, CA; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, CA; The National Museum of Art, Osaka, Japan; and Indianapolis Museum of Art, Indianapolis, IN.\n\nWritten by Forrest Gander\n\nClick here for the PDF\n\nSEPTEMBER 17th - OCTOBER 22nd, 2022\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery is pleased to present ‘Inheritance’ by Anina Major. This is the artist’s first solo show with the gallery. ‘Inheritance’ will be on view from September 17th through October 22nd, 2022, with an opening reception on September 17th from 2-5 pm.\n\nThe decision to voluntarily establish a home contrary to the location in which Major was born and raised (The Bahamas) motivates her to investigate the relationship between self and place. In search of a place to articulate the essence of her practice, the artist returns to the inspirational source of her work—the straw market, an actual place that possesses metaphorical meanings, to further explore her own migration and the emotional complexities of transactional relationships between people and places. At its juncture a sense of belonging is generated from a combination of characteristics, core values and deep-rooted histories that are often undervalued in the context of tourism.\n\nRead More\n\nIn the desire to fabricate her own terms of cultural integrity and its defining influence, viewers experience sculptural works that act as present-day manifestations of the traditional weaving technique known as plait, taught to Major by her grandmother. Beach balls and straw bags collide into forms that through the material transformation of clay, exemplify the power of legacy building through making. And vintage postcards provide composition for the performative video work, Heavy is the Head as an alternate narrative to the utopian landscapes promoted.\n\nAs a counteraction to culture erasure, the work is a continued celebration and reclamation of the ideas behind ‘women’s work’, specifically regarding expressions of identity and imagination. Layering references to post-colonial themes, cultural commodification, feminism and migrational experiences, the abstract nature of the work has the capacity to exist in both traditional and contemporary realms.\n\nAnina Major was born in Nassau, Bahamas. She lives and works in New York. Major received an MFA in ceramics from Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), Providence, RI, and a BS in graphic design from Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA. She has exhibited in museums and galleries internationally, including Mass MoCA, North Adams, MA; New Museum, New York, NY; National Gallery of The Bahamas, Nassau, Bahamas; and DeCordova Sculpture Park, Lincoln, MA. Major’s work can be found in the permanent collections of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the National Gallery of The Bahamas, Nassau, Bahamas; the RISD Museum, Providence, RI; and Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), Los Angeles, CA.\n\nClick to read PDF version\n\nAUGUST 6th - SEPTEMBER 10th, 2022\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery is pleased to present the LIFE II by Jinyoung Yu. This is the Korean artist’s first solo show with the gallery. the LIFE II will be on view from August 6th through September 10th, 2022, with an opening reception on August 6th from 2-5 pm.\n\nWorking with a cast of semi-transparent sculpted characters, Jinyoung Yu explores the disparity between the outer and inner self. Yu’s work acknowledges the anxiety of social situations and exposes implicit acts of cover-up one engages in when adhering to social conventions. This critique of social modes is developed using two opposing materials: vibrantly painted plaster and transparent PVC.\n\nRead More\n\nThe weight of the hardened façade of these figures is carried by their thin bodies, and some even appear to carry the weight of others. As the artist captures the many faces we have created for ourselves, she implores us to examine who we truly are. Behind the flamboyant exterior, outside of ever-present hierarchies and oppressive social structures, we may be left with a hollow shell conditioned to be invisible.\n\nJinyoung has dealt with immense social anxiety and avoided being the center of attention from a young age. Though she as an artist utilizes extroverted expression to convey narratives, her introverted nature manifests in the transparent bodies of her sculptures. The subtle, nearly impassive expressions on the masks relate to the artist’s childhood, where she had to quickly notice subtle differences in the facial expressions of her parents to avoid being berated.\n\nThe artist’s exploration of family dynamics and ego ultimately led her to delve into the insecurities and inequalities prevalent throughout society. She shifts her focus from the individual, to society, to the world, and reflects on our reality where no one can escape the weight of ‘life’. Jinyoung Yu exposes the dualities that exist within us all, urging viewers to look inward for a solution to break this cycle.\n\nJinyoung Yu was born in Seoul, South Korea, where she lives and works. Yu received an MFA and BFA in sculpture from Sungshin Women’s University, Seoul, South Korea. She has exhibited in museums and galleries internationally, including the Vestfossen Museum, Norway; the Seoul Museum of Art, South Korea; the Yellowstone Art Museum, Billings, MT; Gyeongnam art museum, Gyeongnam, South Korea; and Woljeon Museum, Icheon, South Korea.\n\nthe LIFE II is in collaboration with CHOI&CHOI Gallery, Seoul, South Korea; and Cologne, Germany.\n\nPhilip Argent, James Richards, Brad Spence\n\nAUGUST 6th - SEPTEMBER 10th, 2022\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery is pleased to present Inquiries in Abstraction featuring Philip Argent, James Richards, and Brad Spence. The exhibition brings together the work of three California-based painters who use abstraction to investigate materiality, the human condition, and the digital world. Each artist has presented two paintings created in the past year, which reflect the turbulence and uncertainty of the present moment. Inquiries in Abstraction will be on view from August 6th through September 10th, 2022, with an opening reception on August 6th from 2-5pm.\n\nRead More\n\nPhilip Argent’s paintings present an interpretation of the swift flow of experiential and technological influences. They also offer a counter to that rapidity; their meticulous surfaces and processes invite a slow read. Paint is applied using a variety of methods (masking, printing, atmospheric and linear) and allows for an intuitive selection of forms that often mutate, reappear, and transform as a series develops. The use of vivid color relationships stem from observations of natural phenomena, personal memory, and the influence of commercial or screen-based sources. Color plays an intrinsic role both as an indicator of depth and shape and as a referent for a non-objective internal logic.\n\nBrad Spence’s paintings are improvised abstract spaces for fantasy projection. Viewers’ bodies are mobilized in search of a distance where the scenes come into focus. However, clarity is just out-of-reach as what resembles human forms dissolves into fingered smudges at close inspection. The mingled clusters of marks suggest social events, the nature of which is elusive and changing. They shift between celebrations, rites of passage and rituals of the carnal and carnivalesque. The paintings are intended to provoke viewers’ subconscious yearnings as expressed in social ceremonies and unsober excess. They are meant to activate both memories and their erasure.\n\nJames Richards’ two paintings initiate a new body of work inspired by the building technique of wattle and daub. Instead of mud on top of woven branches, paper-mache is applied to the expanded weave of the canvas. The paper-mache is then treated to look like unfired clay. An open structure of various materials including repurposed fabric, painted areas that mimic pen and ink drawings, and an ample amount of negative space contribute to an alchemy of surface and support.\n\nPhilip Argent received an MFA from UNLV and a BA with honors from Cheltenham School of Art. Argent lives and works in Santa Barbara and teaches in the Department of Art at UC Santa Barbara. James Richards holds an MFA from Art Center of College and Design, Pasadena, CA and a BFA from California State University, Fullerton, CA. Richards lives and works in Los Angeles. Brad Spence holds an MFA from California Institute of the Arts, Valencia, CA and a BA from the University of Florida, Gainesville, FL. Spence lives and works in Los Angeles.\n\nJUNE 18th - JULY 30th, 2022\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery is pleased to present Lompoc Stories by Shirley Tse. This is the Calfiornia-based artist’s sixth solo show with the gallery. Lompoc Stories will be on view from June 18th through July 30th, 2022, with an opening reception on June 18th from 2-5 pm.\n\nContinuing on the concept of “Stakeholders”- a solo exhibition representing Hong Kong at the 58th Venice Biennale in 2019- Tse wants to bring to attention the biggest stake we all hold as stakeholders is anthropogenic climate change. Her current work contemplates all form of sustainability: our environment, our energy use, our mental health and our economic disparity. Tse has relocated to Lompoc – “stagnant waters, or lagoon” in Purisemeño language by the Chumash people - in search of a model for a sustainable art practice.\n\nRead More\n\nNon-human stakeholders of Lompoc- animals, minerals, flower seeds, rocket- enter into her studio. Incorporating shed snake skin, diatomaceous earth, tar and charred wood from wild fire into her sculptures, Tse makes palpable the fragility of our life-world.\n\nHong Kong–born, California– based artist Shirley Tse works in the media of sculpture, installation, photography, and text. She at once deconstructs the world of synthetic objects that carry paradoxical meanings and constructs models in which differences might come together. To visualize heterogeneity, Tse conflates different scales, fuses the organic with the industrial, moves between the literal and the metaphorical, merges narratives, and collapses the subject and object relationship. Tse received a Master of Fine Arts degree from ArtCenter College of Design, Pasadena, California, and a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Her work has been exhibited internationally at venues including: M+ Pavilion, Hong Kong (2020); the Pasadena Museum of California Art (2004/2017); Osage, Hong Kong (2010/2011); K11, Hong Kong (2009); Kettle’s Yard, University of Cambridge (2009); the Museum of Modern Fine Art, Minsk (2006); the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, Cornell University (2005); Para Site, Hong Kong (2000/2005); the Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts (2003); the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto (2002); the Bienal Ceará América, Fortaleza (2002); the Biennale of Sydney (2002); Capp Street Project, San Francisco (2002); the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston (2002); MoMA PS1, New York (2002); the New Museum, New York (2002); Palazzo dell’Arengo, Rimini (2002); the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (2001); TENT, Centrum Beeldende Kunst Rotterdam (2001); and Govett-Brewster Art Gallery, New Plymouth, New Zealand (2000). Her work is held in the permanent collections of M+ Museum, Hong Kong, Hong Kong Heritage Museum, Vancouver Art Gallery, Rhode Island School of Design Museum, Altoids Curiously Strong Collection, among others. Tse represented Hong Kong at the 58th Venice Biennale in 2019. Tse received the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship in 2009 and has been on the faculty at California Institute of the Arts since 2001.\n\nJUNE 18th - JULY 30th, 2022\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery is pleased to present Living in the End Times by Thordis Adalsteinsdottir. This is the Icelandic artist’s second solo show with the gallery. Living in the End Times will be on view from June 18th through July 30th, 2022, with an opening reception on June 18th from 2-5 pm.\n\nTaking inspiration from her personal surroundings and current events, Adalsteinsdottir’s surrealist paintings let go of any notion of sense or reason. Living in the End Times, whose title is inspired by its biblical theme and a Slavoj Žižek book of the same name, is comprised of paintings created between 2020 and 2022.\n\nRead More\n\nWorks included in Living in the End Times display scenes from everyday life: a man uses his phone in bed, a boy smokes a pipe, two figures play badminton; but Adalsteinsdottir makes sure these events are anything but ordinary. Animals often cohabitate with humans, vacuuming our floors and wearing our clothes, often appearing so large that seem like our equals. Figures are set against vivid colors and beautiful patterns, making these routine events into dreamlike compositions.\n\nA lack of separation between an inner world and our environment, and portraying the inappropriate desire to define reality, is at the heart of Adalsteinsdottir’s paintings, and much of the work deals with spectatorship. Humans and animals peak into the windows of these interior scenes, becoming part of the composition as they watch from the background. The inclusion of security cameras and cellphones reinforces this ill-defined boundary between public and private life, hinting that these moments are much less intimate than they appear.\n\nTo summarize the experiences and feelings that inspired the works in Living in the End Times, the artist has prepared a statement for the show’s press release:\n\nI am with everyone at once and never with anyone. Kissy-wink-face, heart emoji, thumb up my butt. I live in someone’s diary, it’s written in 1898. The world will never be the same. A large window is open and someone plays an instrument on the cobblestoned street. I check my phone, longing for nighttime and longing for sleep. Luckily the days rush past at lightning speed.\n\nSomeone goes out running, his woolen socks make a thump thumping sound on the cobblestones. He is building up strength and stamina, it is important so that he can run with other people who have built up strength and stamina. This seems to be a great year, a good diary; the smog is thick, the injustice is endless. I keep planting strawberries and the cats keep pooping on them. Thump- thump-thump- thump-\n\nThis man is very good at running and knowing what is important.\n\nFinally, an angry pigeon closes the window from the outside, and I cannot hear the musical instrument anymore. I turn up the news and realize that the world will never be the same. Someone looked up and everyone was dead.\n\nIn a square meant for young people drinking and old people kissing, I kiss a running man on the lips and realize that the world will never be the same.\n\nThordis Adalsteinsdottir was born in Reykjavik, Iceland and splits her time between Reykjavik and Rennes, France. She received an MFA from the School of Visual Arts, NY after graduating from the Icelandic Academy of Arts and the Universidad de Barcelona, in Spain. Adalsteinsdottir has exhibited in galleries and museums nationally and internationally with exhibitions at The Reykjavik Art Museum, Reykjavik Iceland, Shoshana Wayne Gallery, LA, Myokos Biennale, Greece, Laumeier Sculpture Park, Saint Luis, MO, Chiang Mai Art Center, Thailand, and Socrates Sculpture Park, New York.\n\nAPRIL 30th - JUNE 11th, 2022\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery is pleased to present Revival by Max Colby. This is the artist’s first solo show with the gallery. Revival will be on view from April 30th through June 11th, 2022, with an opening reception on April 30th from 2-5pm.\n\nRevival highlights two mature bodies of work by the artist. Colby’s most ambitious and prominent work to date, They Consume Each Other - an installation comprised of 42 meticulously crafted sculptures atop custom glass plinths - sits majestically in the main gallery. In the second gallery, new work from 2022 titled Shrouds connects Colby’s interest in material relation to the body in disquieting ways. The title, Revival, references Colby’s interest in mundane objects, aesthetics, and excessive consumption in contemporary culture’s relationship to normative, violent systems.\n\nRead More\n\nThey Consume Each Other explores the body and its relation to material through references to ceremony and ritual, evoking a monumental altar. Her subversive and campy usage of mundane material seduces the viewer into complex dialogues on the role of aesthetics in binary, cultural constructions of gender, class, and taste in this playful, yet unsettling installation. With a focus on material, Colby’s approach is research-oriented, utilizing Western and American textiles, crafts, and everyday objects. The application is tender and careful, lush and highly embellished, opening a lens to reframe oppressive structures embedded in these materials from a trans and non-binary perspective.\n\nShrouds connects primary conceptual threads in Colby’s practice to the body through familiar objects - quilts. These works begin with reclaimed ‘Crazy’ quilts from 1900- 1950. The movements style uses a hodge-podge of fabrics lacking repetition and highly embellished embroidery, leading to an aesthetic of visually and culturally conflicting fabrics spliced together piecemeal. Colby’s quilts provide a remarkable overabundance of reclaimed materials sewn and embroidered on top. From party supplies to complex hand embroidery, connections drawn in Shrouds focus on reimagining relationships to popular culture and consumption through common associations with quilts of comfort, embrace, and home. Some ominous in scale, others small, the title Shrouds reflects the works anthropomorphic and haunting presence.\n\nColby has been exhibited internationally including at Wave Hill, the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art, Sugar Hill Children’s Museum of Art and Storytelling and Museum Rijswijk, among others. She has completed residencies at the Museum of Arts and Design (New York), the Wassaic Project, MASS MoCA and a Leslie-Lohman Museum Fellowship. In 2022, Colby exhibited a campus-wide public commission for Art in Focus at Rockefeller Center in partnership with Art Production Fund.\n\nColby (born 1990, USA) lives and works in New York City. She received a BFA from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts University in 2012.\n\nMARCH 12th - APRIL 19th, 2022\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery is pleased to present Scarce Material by Sabrina Gschwandtner. This is the Los Angeles based artist’s third solo exhibition with the gallery. The exhibition will be on view from March 12 through April 19, 2022, with an opening reception on March 12 from 2-5pm.\n\nFor this exhibition, the artist looks back to the earliest iterations of the cinematic form, during the Silent Film era. Using black and white 35 mm film, video, silver gelatin photography, and fabric, Gschwandtner offers an alternative to the male-dominated history of film, and a literal mending and repairing of film history. “Scarce Material” refers both to a quilting term for anything that can be stitched together into a quilt, and to the archived early cinema made by pioneering women filmmakers that is in short supply.\n\nRead More\n\nThe artist worked with local and international film archives over three years to source digital copies of some of the earliest films made by women cinema pioneers, whose work from the late 1800s - early 1900s is woefully under-recognized. She prints these movies onto black and white 35 mm film stock, and then cuts and sews the film into configurations based on quilt motifs. She intermingles footage to create a dialogue between the images inside the frames and the overall patterns of the quilt designs. The artist’s sewing of film is a three-dimensional form of cinematic editing and a reconfiguration of the notion of \"filmic suture\" (the use of editing to draw audiences into a story). It is also a way to center marginalized material histories of cinema, in which women with sewing skills translated their handcraft to film editing, and certain early film technology was based on the mechanical advancements of the sewing machine.\n\nMany movies made by pioneering female filmmakers were never archived, and have been lost to history. To honor these works, the artist hand-embroiders filmmaker’s names and hand-writes the titles of their films and the dates the films were made onto blank film. The time she invested in handwork gives permanence and gravity to lost narratives by directors like Fatma Begum, India’s first woman director, who pioneered the fantasy genre in 1926, and Mimí Derba, a pioneering actress, writer and director from Mexico. Gschwandtner’s silver gelatin photos and video evoke cinema’s earliest origins in stop motion photography through a translation of moving images into patterns of women’s self-portraiture.\n\nGschwandtner has exhibited internationally at museums including the Victoria & Albert Museum; Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), Smithsonian American Art Museum, and Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, among many others. Her 3 channel video “Screen Credit,” commissioned by LACMA, is currently on view at the museum’s Stark Bar. Her work is held in the permanent collections of LACMA, the Smithsonian American Art Museum; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the RISD Museum, and the Carl and Marilynn Thoma Art Foundation, among other public and private collections worldwide. Her ‘zine KnitKnit is included in the permanent collections of The Museum of Modern Art, the New York Public Library, the J. Paul Getty Museum, and the Fine Arts Library at Harvard University. She received a BA from Brown University and an MFA from Bard College.\n\nThe artist wishes to thank: EYE Filmmuseum, the Netherlands; Gaumont-Pathé Archives; British Film Archives; Kino Lorber; Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences Film Archive; Women Film Pioneers Project; Gregory Yee Mark; Suzan Mischer; Aimee Mann, and Maia Julis.\n\nView the ‘Scarce Material’ Walkthrough & Conversation between Sabrina Gschwandtner and film historian Jennifer Peterson on April 2nd, 2022.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLJye6oigQ4\n\nJANUARY 29th - MARCH 5th, 2022\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery is pleased to announce the inaugural exhibition at our new location on West Adams, Where Do We Go From Here an exhibition of new works by Tel Aviv-based artist Orly Maiberg.\n\nThe exhibition opens January 29th, 2022 and runs through March 5th, 2022. Where Do We Go From Here is the artist’s debut exhibition with the gallery and her first solo show in the United States.\n\nRead More\n\nAt first glance, Orly Maiberg’s works seem like abstract paint spaces, resembling satellite images. Raw matter touched by delicate gestures of paint. A closer look suggests a topographic map, patches that form landscapes, mountaintops, deserts and seas.\n\nMaiberg’s work begins in dipping the naked canvas in a tub of ink, allowing the appearance of initial contours of fluid, topographical marks. Then the artist collages pieces of canvas, covering parts of the painting and creating frayed geological layers of states and textures. From that point onwards, her treatment of the canvas resembles a musical arc: actions lead to actions or a pause – an empty space within the painting. Any suspension demands another action and thus, repetitively, the painting is being created, variation upon variation.\n\nThe movement in the studio evolves intuitively, with moments of alertness that allow the mind to capture the story that emerges from the painting and illuminate it. Slowly, the arbitrary makes room for the rational, and the unconscious - for the conscious. Premeditation and randomness are being merged into a complex artistic progression, combining the pre-structured outline with that which appears out of the blue.\n\nThis repetitive process is evident in all Maiberg’s works. Wandering among them enables the viewer to weave fragments into an incomplete body, hallmarked by tear, disruption, scars and fragmentation, implying the complexity of our life’s reality. An event, a narrative-led occurrence begins to emerge from the painted scene. The eye wanders upon the canvas and what seems to be an overview of the abstract, the elusive and infinite, focuses at once when a fragile figure appears and forces a scale, sharpens the perspective, permitting the gaze to hang on to it for a short while and linger. Emerging like that, the figures define the painted space, which is bound by somewhat vague rules. The human presence disciplines the painted reality.\n\nThe works in the current exhibition were all created during the latest period of lockdowns, isolations and restrictions. As a way of challenging our restraining reality, the processes in the studio sought a release, spreading while the correlation between their fragmented forms and their inner chaos grew, gradually. In Sitting on a Branch the canvas’ boundaries are broken; the painting splits and branches out, as if it could go on growing.\n\nMaiberg draws her themes from within the world’s onwards movement and lets them mirror for us, make us confront their – our – loneliness. They require us to pour our own notions onto the canvas, in order to stitch it together, raise questions and reassess, where do we go from here?\n\nOrly Maiberg received her B.F.A. at the New York School of Visual Arts. She has exhibited her work extensively in Israel and internationally, and can be found in museum collections including the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. Maiberg lives and works in Tel Aviv.\n\nText by: Tal Bechler\n\nJUNE 15th - AUGUST 21st, 2021\n\nMax Colby, Terri Friedman, Jeffrey Gibson, Sabrina Gschwandtner, Dinh Q. Lê, Anina Major, Madame Moreau, Elaine Reichek, James Richards, Frances Trombly, Yveline Tropéa, and Gil Yefman\n\nClick here to inquire.\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery is pleased to announce “Above & Below,” an exhibition of work by 12 artists working with fabric, cloth, beads and woven materials. The exhibition opens to visitors June 15th and runs through August 21st, 2021.\n\nThe exhibition title refers to the process of weaving—threading above and below lines of thread to create a fabric. Though the use of weaving and woven materials is what unites each of these artists, they employ a diverse range of artistic processes and practices from weaving, quilting, sewing, needlepoint and felting to assemblage and threading.\n\nRead More\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery has a long history of showing artists using woven practices. Most artists in the show previously have exhibited or continue to exhibit with the gallery: these artists are Gil Yefman, Dinh Q. Lê, Sabrina Gschwandtner, Elaine Reichek, Frances Trombly, Anina Major, Jeffrey Gibson, Terri Friedman, and James Richards. In addition, Madame Moreau, Max Colby, and Yveline Tropéa are all showing their work in our Los Angeles gallery for the first time.\n\nThis is not a textile art exhibition. Much of the artwork has less to do with conventional ideas of weaving or an affinity for textile art as such and more to do with a sense of craftsmanship and process in art making. Major for instance works in clay, her process inspired by Bahamian basking weaving techniques. African beads and beading similarly underscore the work of both Moreau and Tropéa, while Gibson takes inspiration from Native American beading.\n\nIt is curious to observe that much of what you might call the ‘assembly language’ of each of the works tends to follow a basic pattern, the design made of successive foldings above or below a line. This harkens back to early human craft practices and even resembles in some respects the systemic architecture of initial, low-level computer programming languages. Machines, it would seem, were first taught to learn and perform basic tasks in ways which mimicked creative human thoughts patterns.\n\nMaking is the key here, with individual pieces carefully, sometimes painstakingly arranged, stitched, woven, handcrafted or embellished through loving labor. Several of the artworks were produced over a few months, sometimes in the studio or via social collaboration as in the case of Gil Yefman who worked with the Kuchinate, an African Women’s collective in Israel on the initial wet felting for his artworks, created originally for his exhibition “Kibbutz Buchenwald” at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.\n\nForm, scale and color are the considerations of utmost importance for all these artists, as much as materials and process in the works. Gschwandtner, Richards, Lê, Trombly, and even Friedman embrace abstraction to some extent: weaving or related techniques are used to obscure or to abstract raw, even sometimes graphic social and political visual source material ranging from posters and film stills to text, rope and printed bolts of fabric.\n\nColby and Reichek are conceptual artists who consciously work in decorative art styles with prosaic, malleable materials. Their artwork is intended to evoke an immediate association with domesticity, gendered labor, or women’s work specifically, and is therefore political in its orientation, if not intention, as a statement of social and cultural identity and gender (and ongoing fluidity) in contemporary culture.\n\nThe identity of the artist is a latent subject in a good deal of the artwork in this show, making many of the works autobiographical as in the case, most visibly, of Gibson, Lê, Colby, Major, Moreau, and Tropéa. To engage with their artwork is to enter their minds, to see a world anew through their eyes. Working above and below the line becomes a formal vehicle for a process of subjective storytelling, a way of ordering information to make sense of who they are, why and where they belong.\n\nAppointments encouraged, but no longer required.\n\nFor more information please contact Rosie Morales at director@shoshanawayne.com\n\nJANUARY 22nd - MAY 15th, 2021\n\nClick here to inquire.\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery is pleased to announce, ”Yellow Haze,” an exhibition of new work by New York-based artist Kathy Butterly. The exhibition opens at the Los Angeles gallery January 22nd and runs through May 15th, 2021. This will be the artist’s sixth solo exhibition with the gallery, since joining in 2003.\n\nRead More\n\nKathy Butterly creates ceramic sculpture and yet she combines it with a painters’ intuitive process of experimentation of color through glazes. Her latest body of work, made over the past 12 months in her New York studio, pushes her practice in a new direction— slightly larger clay forms are in evidence, to give herself, Butterly says, “a bigger canvas with which to work.”\n\nButterly has chosen to work with a restricted scale for over 30 years. “I find a strength in the intimate,” she explains, “I find power in scale shifts within the works, I enjoy making works that are not rushed and demand a lot of skill and knowledge. The small scale is very demanding. I have a deep understanding and relationship with my materials and this skill allows me to work with passion and allow humor to flow. Beauty, humor, awkwardness are all important to me. Humor is a gateway to provoking deeper thoughts, tough thoughts.”\n\nWorking with restricted scale is also, she says, a conscious social and political statement. ”I choose not to take up a lot of space with my artwork, to impose, but rather to engage the time and thinking of viewers. The works sort of demand you look at them and you take time to look at them —smaller forms pull you in and you spend a lot of time looking at them, they keep unraveling information. Environmentally I also do not want to create a large footprint, that is important to me as a world citizen.”\n\nThe variation in the scale of her clay forms is matched by a simultaneous expansion in the complexity of formal schemes. Colors are familiar, but mixed or sometimes muted to cover or to occlude sculptural detail, such as her trademark minute hand beading, that remains a feature. Her latest forms are at once more ambitious and more subtle, the artist totally in control of her media.\n\nButterly is creating artworks which can be appreciated fully from all sides. Her artworks have always been able to be contemplated in the round, but these pieces are striking in so far as they have no front, or frontal aspect, with each and every angle designed to give the viewer a perspective on the same object.\n\nNot surprisingly her new clay forms take almost twice as long to produce. Partly it is the scale shifts and complexity of designs, but simultaneously it is because she has allowed herself a greater freedom of decision making. Butterly attributes this change in part to a year of being at home, and deeper, unavoidable thoughts about life and art.\n\nOver the last 12 months she has renewed her interest in poetry and jazz, both highly improvisational, abstract art forms. The artist explains that in poetry and jazz she found a companion during protected periods of lockdown but also, creatively, a growing “comfort and freedom with abstraction rather than complete thought- rather than a song with words I felt connected to sound, to flow, staying away from fact and enjoying the freedom of not knowing.”\n\nSymbolic connections between color and emotion can no doubt be made, for each piece seems to have its own temperament or mood. But that’s not the goal, just as pure abstraction conversely does not interest her. These objects are about feeling, about being human in the world—as complicated, painful, messy and joyous as that can be and often all at the same time.\n\nKathy Butterly received her MFA from the University of California, Davis and her BFA from Moore College of Art, Philadelphia. She has exhibited extensively and her work can be found in numerous museum collections including, MoMA, New York, NY; the Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn, NY; the Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum, Saratoga, NY; the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC; the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, PA; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA; and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, TX amongst many others. Butterly has been the recipient of prestigious awards including the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award (2017), New York Foundation for the Arts Artist Fellowship (2017), Siena Art Institute Artist Fellowship (2017), John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship (2014), the Moore College of Art & Design Visionary Woman Award (2013), the Smithsonian American Art Museum Contemporary Artist Award (2012), and the Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant (2011) amongst many others. In 2017, Butterly was inducted as a fellow into the National Academy of Design. The artist lives and works in New York.\n\nMARCH 5th - APRIL 30th, 2021\n\nPlease click here to inquire\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery is pleased to present an online-exclusive exhibition by Japanese born and New York-based artist Rakuko Naito. This is her first solo exhibition with a Los Angeles gallery. The show will be live online March 5th through April 30th, with selected artwork available for viewing at the gallery.\n\nRakuko Naito was born in Tokyo and in the 1950s studied Nihonga painting at the prestigious Tokyo National University of Art. In 1958 she moved permanently to the US with her husband, Minimal painter Tadaaki Kuwayama, settling in New York where for more than 30 years she has worked exclusively with hand-made natural papers.\n\nRead More\n\nNaito uses paper the way a painter manipulates oil paint. Her vision is always two dimensional, she says, and her breathtaking, painstakingly detailed work is conceived to hang on the wall much like a painting does. She is interested in she says, “the simple beauty of shapes, both shapes of nature and geometric forms” and strives above all else in her art for “appealing forms as well as the tactile qualities of the surface and the texture.” Color is intentionally, rigorously restricted to focus the viewer on the formal elements of her designs.\n\nHer latest body of artwork made over the last 12 months in her New York studio deepens her love of natural and geometric forms, texture and surface qualities in art. Her paintings are aligned formally with Minimalism, but the processes, materials, inspiration are entirely different—even unique. She does not begin with a drawing or a sketch in mind but she prefers to allow an image, often found in nature, to imprint itself on her mind and then to recreate it from memory.\n\nShe begins work in the studio with a box like frame, usually a square, and decides what shape to place on top of it. She then chooses the paper—always Japanese, white or off-white, hand-made and 100% natural and archival, but she does not work with the usual, known traditions of Japanese paper art like Origami. She prefers to casually tear or cut up paper she uses. The design evolves as she goes, but she tries to keep close to the original idea in her head. She explains, “A line formed naturally is not the same as a line drawn by hand. I try to experiment and manipulate materials to create my own world.”\n\nEvery work has a different image, a different inspiration even if they superficially look the same. This is not art about repetition or Zen or meditation. Nor is it artwork with a message or didactic quality. “I’m not trying to tell people what they should think or should see,” she says “it’s up to them. I always try to find beauty in simplicity and so for me that is the hardest thing to do, to do something complicated that looks more straightforward. My concern is purely art and visual stimulation.”\n\nRakuko Naito has presented more than 25 solo exhibitions over the last half century and participated in more than 50 group shows in a dozen countries. Her work is held in numerous museum collections including The Aldrich Museum, Ridgefield, CT; The Davis Museum at Wellesley College, Wellesley, MA; El Museo de Arte Contemporaneo, Buenos Aires Argentina; Museum Voorlinden, Wassenaar, Netherlands and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, CA.\n\nJANUARY 7th - APRIL 3rd, 2021\n\nPlease click here to inquire\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery is pleased to present an online-exclusive exhibition of the work of New York-based painter Elena Sisto, “Empathy Machine,” and her first solo show at the gallery, consisting of over 20 graphic, gleeful paintings in India ink and graphite on masonite made in response to the rapidly changing social, cultural and political events of the past few months and years.\n\nRead More\n\nWomen are the protagonists in her paintings, of all ages and types and engaged in everything from climbing mountains, brandishing weapons, to responding to threats of global warming, the trials of quarantine and social distancing along with civil unrest during the Covid 19 pandemic. Themes of bravery, caring, companionship and solidarity abound in these paintings coupled with a more subtle message of strength and resilience.\n\nSisto describes the central female character in her paintings as an anima or avatar, loosely modeled on events and feelings from her own life but also the imagination and news media images as well as dreams. “I think of my character as a loose proxy, a being of internal feeling rather than external looks that I can send into the world to do things I've never done, will never do, and that can enter difficult situations I'm interested in—sort of an empathy machine.”\n\nThe formal female figure evolved from cartoon characters of compelling women, especially Olive Oyl, girlfriend of Popeye, though greatly simplified, abstracted, exaggerated or made indeterminate to better slip in and out of different social roles and situations. The artist’s idea was to create immediate character recognition for the viewer but with sufficient ambiguity, verve and wit so as to enable broader, even universal identification. She is an everywoman, one with power and vulnerability but also potential.\n\nBesides Olive Oyl, Daisy Mae from Li'l Abner is frequently referenced in these works, albeit in an elliptical fashion along with other popular cultural characters like Snow White, Annie Oakley, Nancy or the warrior women starring in films like the Hunger Games and Wonder Woman. The graphics of Matisse also remain a formal touchstone for the artist not surprisingly. “I go back to him always,” Sisto says, “the brilliance and joy of his work and the idea that the pose of the figure is the sign for the movement of the space.”\n\nSisto works these paintings using a subtractive process of her own invention. The figures are drawn up with pencil on an all black ground, built with layers of India ink, and then are subsequently carved out with a sharp instrument similar to the process of etching or dry point. The graphic intensity of the final images coupled with restriction of color gives the paintings an editorial quality, as if the artist is bearing witness to events. Equally important is the relationship between negative and positive space, the artist throwing her figures and their actions into sharp, almost heroic relief resembling monochromatic mythological scenes depicted on Grecian vases.\n\nElena Sisto lives and works in New York. She received her BA in Art from Brown University and studied at the New York Studio School. Sisto has exhibited at numerous museums including the Miami Dade Museum of Art + Design (2012), Katzen Museum of Art at American University, Washington, DC (2008), Maier Museum, VA (1999), Greenville County Museum, SC (1997), and Wexner Center for the Arts (1992), among others. In addition, she was included in the 43rd Biennial of Contemporary American Painting at The Corcoran Gallery, Washington, DC (1993-94). She is the recipient of several awards and fellowships including the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship (2013), the Inglis Griswold Nelson Prize from the National Academy Museum and School (2008), and the National Endowment for the Arts Visual Artist's Fellowship (1984-85 & 1989-90). In 2015, she was inducted as a fellow to the National Academy of Design.\n\nDECEMBER 15th, 2020 - APRIL 3rd, 2021\n\nThordis Adalsteinsdottir, Shiva Ahmadi, Nicole Eisenman, Chitra Ganesh, Angela Heisch, Orly Maiberg, linn meyers, Bridget Mullen, Rebeca Puga, Fiona Rae, and Beverly Semmes.\n\nONLINE EXCLUSIVE EXHIBITION\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery is pleased to announce “UnRealism,” an exhibition of over 30 paintings by 11 women artists that reflect their own highly personal response and attitude to the ‘unrealism’ of our times. For some of the artists this has been a moment of existential crisis requiring bold statements and reflection on our place in society and the world, while for others ‘unrealism‘ has meant a doubling down on the role of art as a space for quiet, peaceful contemplation.\n\nRead More\n\nDrawn from different generations and backgrounds in Europe, Asia and America, what connects the artists is their difference: Thordis Adalsteinsdottir, Shiva Ahmad, Nicole Eisenman, Chitra Ganesh, Angela Heisch, Orly Maiberg, linn meyers, Bridget Mullen, Rebeca Puga, Fiona Rae, and Beverly Semmes. Together they take the pulse of painting in the world today, reflecting what is being made now, among women painters, as well as in the art world more broadly at a time in which no particular art style or movement dominates and everything seems to coexist and mingle.\n\nThe artwork speaks for itself. But there are commonalities. Each of the artists in their own distinct way is socially minded. A commitment to painting is also unwavering and paramount— even if the materials and the surfaces which they use in their work clearly differ. So too is a commitment to realism, as a mode of expression, although this varies in the work from painterly forms of figuration to a new surrealism and expressionism bordering at times on abstraction. Unrealism is therefore reflected not just in the chosen content or subject matter of their work but a straddling and confusion of formal lines between figuration and abstraction. To all of the artists the distinction does not seem to be a hard or fast one but evocative of the doubts and questions we all face today.\n\nRealistic depiction is a starting point for Ganesh, Rae, Adalsteinsdottir, Eisenman, Ahmadi, Semmes. The body in particular is the preferred subject, usually women’s bodies but not in a conventional sense of a female nude: these are bodies in transition, dissolution, movement, wracked with conflicts from within and out. Bodies of the past mingle with present life to forge a vision of what could or should be, at the least according to the artist. There is always something that disturbs us in these paintings, repressed or forgotten feelings welling up.\n\nA similar evocation of energy and tension characterizes the artwork of the other main group of artists in this exhibition, Heisch, Puga, Mullen, Maiberg and Meyers who tend to abstract their focus with forms that defy easy categorization. The landscape or some kind of space emerges tangentially as a theme here, though frequently one has a feeling when looking at this work of falling into or through space.\n\nWORLD VIEWS: HORIZONS AND LOOKOUT TOWERS\n\nNOVEMBER 20th, 2020 - FEBRUARY 28th, 2021\n\nONLINE EXCLUSIVE\n\nShoshana Wayne Gallery is pleased to announce an exhibition of over 30 photographs by the Los Angeles-based British-Mexican-American artist Sze Tsung Nicolás Leong, selected by the artist from his ongoing and iconic series Horizons, as well as a new image series Lookout Towers. Shown at a time when confinements and lockdowns have increasingly constricted us into looking near, these two series explore the opposite: the act of looking far. The exhibition opens online November 20 and runs through January. This will be the artist’s second solo exhibition with the gallery.\n\nRead More\n\nSze Tsung Nicolás Leong’s artistic practice focuses, he has previously written, “on how we see, understand, and belong to the world.” His Horizons, begun in 2001, are a series of photographs taken throughout the globe of the line of sight separating ground from sky, and at the same time, on a more cognitive level, they are “an exploration of the horizon as the limit of what we can see and know, that questions the boundaries separating the present from the past, near from far, familiar from foreign.”\n\nMr Leong’s Horizons presented in this exhibition again reiterate his exploration of the range of environments within which our lives and histories unfold, and highlight, in addition, connections between abstraction and landscape, the picture plane almost dissolving into vast fields of color. Among the works on display here are horizons taken this year at Playa del Rey in Los Angeles, capturing the turquoise light generated by bioluminescent algae found in the ocean—the algae absorbs light during the day and gives off a bright glow at night.\n\nLookout Towers is a new series of black and white photographs of a building type particular to the Hoiping and Toisan regions of Canton, which emerged in the 16th century and reached an apogee of construction volume during the early 20th century. While these lookout towers served a defensive purpose against bandits and often functioned to represent social standing (whether of a family or a village), as a genre they are built expressions of diaspora—enabling, both literally and metaphorically, the act of looking out to distant horizons, and embodying the changing nature of living in and belonging to the broader world. Funded by remittances from communities in cities as dispersed as Mexicali, Lima, Caracas, San Francisco, Liverpool, Johannesburg, Kolkata, and Singapore, the towers symbolize an emerging form of global identity and cross-cultural melding that challenges ingrained assumptions about fixed borders and identities.\n\nMuch like the contemporaneous Beaux Arts movement, these towers mined historical architectural styles to create new forms from an eclectic mixture of influences—from Greek and Roman columns, to medieval turrets, to Fung Seoi geomancy, to Spanish arches, to Han dynasty watchtowers, to classical Han script and iconography. Growing internationalism, aided by migration, cultural exchange and integration, education abroad, the rise of the World Fairs, along with the increased distribution of books, postcards and magazines, all influenced and encouraged this stylistic diversity. For Leong, Lookout Towers is also a personal exploration into ancestry, as his grandfather emigrated from Toisan to England during the First World War and sent money back to construct such buildings.\n\nSze Tsung Nicolás Leong was born in Mexico City, where he spent his childhood as well as in London and Los Angeles, and has lived and worked in those cities as well as in New York, Rome, Houston, and Beijing. His visual practice has, over the past two decades, focused on creating new pictures of the world, whether by assembling together a new landscape that uncovers unexpected relationships, as in his series Horizons; by revealing how a society can be reshaped through the erasure of its history, as in his series History Images; or by surveying the newly unfamiliar terrains of a political map di"
