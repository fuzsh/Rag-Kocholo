Had to Google some titles that didn’t include the author’s name. Included info tips where I could.\n\nNow, what to do? :confused:\n\nI could close my thread and that would leave two open ones on books. Note that both fiction and non-fiction have been recommended, so both this thread title and mine aren’t totally accurate to what people are suggesting.\n\nOh, well, the list is great — so many great books!\n\nI’ll post the big list here — might have to do it in a few posts, as it’s long.

I like to listen to books on tape when working in the studio, and have discovered quite a few good authors by just borrowing audio-books that look interesting. These days I can even request them online via the Library website!\n\nNow, some more books come to mind.\n\nVreeland’s novel based on the Canadian painter, Emily Carr brings to my mind Carr’s own writing. She was a prolific writer and journal-writer, and lots of these have been published. “Klee Wyck”, “The Book of Small” and “Hundreds and Thousands” are a few I can recall. I’ll look them all up and post them here later. She is a very entertaining writer. Emily Carr lived 1871-1945 — very innovative and passionate. Very popular here in Canada and I saw a wonderful big retrospective of her work here in Ottawa at the National Gallery of Canada a few years ago.\n\n:confused: Mystery of a Mystery… :confused:\n\nAlso, darned if I can’t remember the title and the author of a good little art-related mystery I read in the summer — something I picked up second-hand. Might have it packed away in a box for a garage sale in the spring… :rolleyes:\n\nAt first, I thought it was one of the books mentioned and listed here (“Faking It” by Jennifer Crusie). However, when I checked out that book on the author’s website, I realized it was not the same book. In case someone else knows this book, I’ll recall what I can: mystery/ female protagonist whose grandfather (I think that was the relationship) was an Italian art forger who had passed on his skills to her, but she doesn’t want to follow in the family biz, though her family’s past does tend to ‘haunt’ her. She is an art restorer, and worked for an art museum, and was “let go” through a corrupt collegue framing her. I think it takes place in San Francisco (or LA); perhaps she also does Trompe d’Oeil too….. Anyway, in this book she is trying to solve the murder of another art restorer or curator who is found dead with a painting missing in the museum, just after she visited him — framing her again. Lots of misadventure & action in this one. A good fun read — but what is the book?? :confused: It might even be one in a series; if so, I’d like to read more of them.\n\nCheers, Lauren\n\nCheers, Lauren\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/LaurenFosterMacLeod/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lauren.fosterm/"
