        "text": "Released 10 years after the end of the war, this moving graphic novel portrays the personal experiences of modern warfare, the processes of forced migration and the struggles of seeking asylum in Europe. Inspired by Benjamin Dix's personal experience of working in Sri Lanka for the United Nations during the war, Vanni, named after the Tamil region of northern Sri Lanka, draws upon over four years of meticulous research - including first-hand interviews, references from official reports and cross-referencing with experts in the field. Elegantly drawn by Lindsay Pollock, and with a real sense of immediacy, Vanni takes readers through the otherwise unimaginable struggles, horrors and lifechanging decisions families and individuals are forced to make when caught in the crosshairs. Dr Benjamin Dix is Senior Fellow at SOAS, University of London, founder and Director of the non-profit PositiveNegatives which produces literary comics that explore complex social and humanitarian issues. He has worked across South Asia as a professional photographer and as a Communications and Liaison Manager for the United Nations. From 2004 -2008 he was based in the LTTE (Tamil Tigers)-controlled Vanni, in north Sri Lanka, throughout the post-tsunami reconstruction and subsequent civil war. Lindsay Pollock is a Senior Artist at PositiveNegatives, where he has illustrated a number of testimonial comics. His work has appeared on the BBC, Channel 4 and in multiple languages across Europe, Asia and Africa. Vanni is his debut graphic novel.\n\n'Elegantly drawn by Lindsay Pollock, and with a real sense of immediacy, this exceptionally moving graphic novel portrays the personal experiences of modern warfare, the process of forced migration, and the struggles of seeking asylum in Europe.' Good Reads\n\n'The book is an essential read for a wide audience, from human rights advocates and policy makers, right through to casual tourists who are considering Sri Lanka as their next holiday destination.' Tamil Guardian\n\n'A thought-provoking and beautifully told story, this is an extraordinary piece of work that deserves the utmost praisel' Pipedream Comics\n\nPaperback with flaps. 272 pages.\n\n25cm x 25cm.\n\nISBN: 978-0-271-08497-8.\n\nPublished September 2019."
