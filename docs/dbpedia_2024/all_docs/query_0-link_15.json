She works primarily in sound, combining oral history, archival recordings, spoken word and environmental recordings to investigate histories, environments, our collective and individual memories, and the forces that shape them. She is inspired by places or themes which are rooted in everyday experience and is particularly interested in ‘hidden histories’ and historical amnesia and how this can be investigated from a feminist perspective through the medium of composed sound. She is interested in what other people hear and don’t hear and the stories that they tell about these listenings. Most of her work is in the form of gallery installations, concert pieces, books, and essays. She is Professor of Sound Arts at University of the Arts London and directs Creative Research in Sound Arts Practice (CRiSAP), a UAL research centre.\n\nwww.cathylane.co.uk\n\nLouise Gray writes on music and sound art for The Wire and other publications. Her interest in the sonic knowledge created through dialogue came out of doctoral research, which used in-depth interviews with five post-1945 female composers, each one working in a different transmission of music and sound art, as a way of understanding the methods and networks necessary to create work. Her recent writing has focused on ways of listening in the works of Eliane Radigue, Annea Lockwood and Pauline Oliveros.

Her work is aimed at the question: how do we live together? Not to provide a rigid answer as such, but to pull apart the nuances of mutuality, co-existence, and multiplicity.

Her work explores how spaces such as museums, state archives and other institutions reinforce colonial biopolitics in relation to the Palestinian living and dead, and asks how individuals and collectives can create materials which subvert these power regimes, preserve folk/oral histories and respond generatively to absence, particularly in the context of cultural erasure and unfolding genocide. Nadia is also a co-founder of Sarha Collective, an artists collective for experimental art forms from Palestine and the broader SWANA region.\n\n@sarhacollective\n\nZeinab Shaath is a singer-songwriter from Gaza. More than 50 years ago, she recorded a set of revolutionary folk music — the first English-language songs to introduce the Palestinian cause to the wider world. Inspired by Vietnam-era protest music from Bob Dylan and Joan Baez, ‘The Urgent Call of Palestine’ was intended to share the stories and messages of Palestinian resistance with an international audience. In 1973, Shaath was immortalised in a film shot by exiled Palestinian artist Ismail Shammout in the mountains of Lebanon.

Across this panel, the idea that feminist archives do not precede exhibition but instead are constituted through expanded practices of curating, exhibition and distribution is introduced and tested. How do feminist archival practices that happen through collective kinship networks enable materials to be available for exhibition? How does distribution also function to preserve archives of feminist practice? What processes of creative and ethical custodianship does the feminist archive require? And how do ephemeral textual materials that blur distinctions between archive and collection promote not only new forms of exhibition making but the re-imagining of institutions?\n\nRita Keegan Heritage Project (Rita Keegan, Lauren Craig & Gina Nembhard), Radclyffe Hall (Laura Guy & Mason Leaver-Yap), Charlotte Procter, Chair: Catherine Grant\n\n15.15–16.30 Panel 7: Community-Building Filmmaking\n\nA community-building impulse has been at the core of feminist filmmaking in Latin America. This meant not only creating activist films in a collective fashion but also developing intersectional and participatory processes with the subjects involved in the production. In this panel, we propose three different perspectives on Community-Building Filmmaking in Latin America and its diaspora. We start with an overview of the feminist film collectives that emerged in the region during the 1970s and 1980s, followed up with a particularly interesting exilic experience on lesbian activism and finalising with a current inter-generational archival activation process.\n\nLorena Cervera, Livia Perez, Isabel Seguí, Chair: Rosie Thomas\n\n17.00–18.30 Panel 8: Devolved screens: alternative approaches, changing content\n\nThis panel explores works and makers who changed and subverted industrial cinema and television. Focussed on artists and collectives who invented new ways of working, showing and funding cinema and television, contributions will discuss how they sought and portrayed alternative subjects and experiences, necessarily inventing new approaches to making and telling stories.\n\nBarbara Evans, Nicole Atkinson, Jessica Boyall, Beth Bramich, Chair: Lauren Houlton\n\nParallel events in the Taylor Digital Studio (opposite Women in Revolt!)\n\n11.30–13.00 Women of Colour Index Reading Group\n\nLed by Samia Mailk and Sophie Carapetian.\n\nWOCI (Women of Colour Index) Reading Group is currently organised and facilitated by founder and director Samia Malik.

In 2015 Samia started working with WOCI at the Women’s Art Library (WAL) at Goldsmiths University, which raised urgent, paramount questions about institutional censorship of the Index and women of colour artists, between 2015–2016 these issues have been explored and investigated by Samia as an artist and curator.\n\nWorkshop text\n\n“Roadworks is a six-minute colour video of an hour-long performance under-taken by Mona Hatoum for Brixton Art Gallery, London in 1985, during which she walked around barefoot with Doc Martin boots tied to her ankles. The work responded to the socio-political context of Brixton, which at the time was plagued by police violence towards people of colour, which had fuelled the uprisings of 1981 and 1985.” – Women in Revolt!, Linsey Young (2023)\n\nMona Hatoum was born in Beirut, Lebanon, to a Palestinian family in 1952. During a short visit to London in 1975, civil war broke out in Lebanon preventing her from returning home. Stranded in London, she decided to study art, first at the Byam Shaw School Art and then the Slade School of Fine Art until 1981. Hatoum’s experience of being stranded in the UK significantly shaped her practice, which deals with issues of living in exile, displacement, containment, and the notion of home. She works across installation, sculpture, video, photography, performance and works on paper.\n\n15.00–16.30 What Do We Mean When We Talk About Care? Feminist Duration Reading Group\n\nFeminist Duration Reading Group, led by Beth Bramich, Katrin Lock and Helena Reckitt, with guest artist Leah Clements\n\nIn the light of current debates on the need for art institutions to be more ‘accessible’ and ‘inclusive,’ The Feminist Duration Reading Group leads an out-loud reading session on intersectional feminist explorations of care and access, collectivity and healing.\n\nReadings open up questions about the different associations and political urgencies of terms including ‘care,’ ‘hospitality,’ ‘access’ and ‘access intimacy.’ Highlighting how art institutions have both co-opted and wilfully misconstrued practices of care, the session points to how we might care for one another better, while also pushing cultural institutions to take better care of us.\n\nReadings\n\nTexts include selections from Johanna Hedva’s ‘Sick Woman Theory’ (2016) and ‘Why It’s Taking so Long’ (2022); Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha’s ‘Care Work: Dreaming Disability Justice’ (2018); Mia Mingus ‘Access Intimacy: The Missing Link’ (2011), and Tabita Rezaire ‘Decolonial Healing*: In Defense of Spiritual Technologies’ (2019).\n\nThere is no need to read in advance as we will read together, one person, one paragraph at a time.
