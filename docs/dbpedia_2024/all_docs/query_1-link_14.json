        "text": "The Whitney Museum of American Art in New York announced today that Lindsay Pollock, a former editor in chief of Art in America, has been named its chief communications and content officer. She will take up the post on May 7.\n\n“The Whitney is one of the most dynamic and vibrant art institutions in the US, which happens to have been founded by a visionary woman, and whose nearly century-old mission is rooted in the desire to support and engage with American art,” said Pollock. “I am sincerely honored to be part of the talented team helping to shape the Whitney’s next chapter.”\n\nPollock served as editor in chief of the monthly contemporary art magazine from 2011 to 2017. Prior to her time at Art in America, she covered the arts for various sources, including Bloomberg News, the Art Newspaper, and the New York Sun, a daily newspaper that was published in Manhattan from 2002 to 2008.\n\nPreviously, Pollock worked as the marketing director of the Central Park Conservancy and as a marketing manager at Sotheby’s. She is also the author of The Girl with the Gallery, a biography of the pioneering American art dealer Edith Halpert (Public Affairs, 2006). Pollock earned her bachelor’s degree in art history from Barnard College and her master’s degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism."
