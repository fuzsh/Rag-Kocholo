        "text": "First year at FCDS: 6th grade\n\nMy favorite FCDS memory was the first day of our senior year. Even though this year was difficult, all the seniors still got to feel special, and seeing all my friends together again for the first time in months was really exciting!\n\nCollege: Howard University\n\nFirst year at FCDS: 10th grade\n\nMy favorite teacher is Dr. Sponholtz. He taught me so much and helped fuel my love for chemistry and just supported me the entire way. He is always checking in and making sure I am pushing myself to be the best I can be. Also, I always remember to have a wonderful weekend full of WISE CHOICES because of him.\n\nCollege: High Point University\n\nFirst year at FCDS: 6th grade\n\nMy favorite FCDS memory was heading to Washington D.C. our eighth grade year. This trip is one of my favorite memories because I got to spend a lot of quality time with my friends. I also got to see our nation's capital for the first time along with a lot of cool monuments.\n\nCollege: University of North Carolina Wilmington\n\nFirst year at FCDS: 6th grade\n\nFCDS has provided me with the writing and discussion skills that I will need in university and workplace settings. Had we not been prepared in these areas, we would not stand out as much as we do.\n\nCollege: University of Rochester\n\nFirst year at FCDS: 9th grade\n\nMy favorite memory at FCDS was taking the trip to Nashville with the orchestra family in 10th grade. We had a great time exploring the city and learning about the musical history. My favorite moment of the trip was getting on the stage at the Grand Ole Opry. There were thousands of people in the audience and more on the radio listening to me yell \"howdy\" like Minnie Pearl.\n\nCollege: Appalachian State University\n\nFirst year at FCDS: 9th grade\n\nMy favorite teacher is Mr. Cavanaugh because he truly cared about my well being rather than just a grade on a paper.\n\nFCDS has prepared you for what's ahead by making me a thousand times better at writing a solid paper.\n\nI am most looking forward to learning more things that will benefit me in the real world.\n\nCollege: Appalachian State University\n\nFirst year at FCDS: 4th grade\n\nMy favorite FCDS memory happened during my sophomore musical. It was at the end of one of our performances. The curtain closed on us singing, and once it closed it we all rejoiced and hugged. Theatre has been such an amazing experience for me during my time at FCDS. I’ve made so many friends and I will carry the memories I’ve made with them into college and beyond.\n\nCollege: North Carolina State University\n\nFirst year at FCDS: 10th grade\n\nMy favorite teacher during my years at FCDS has to be Dr. Sullivan. This one was not an easy choice to make, as I have enjoyed every single teacher I have had during my time at Forsyth, and that is not an exaggeration. However, Dr. Sullivan was someone who I have learned so much from and truly fostered my love for people and the way our minds work. He pushed me to think critically and challenge myself, while also teaching me way more about myself than I ever imagined.\n\nCollege: Furman University\n\nFirst year at FCDS: 9th grade\n\nMrs. Lopez is by far my favorite teacher! She is so kind and helpful. I never really liked Spanish until I have her my ninth and tenth grade class. She made it fun and easy to comprehend. She has also helped me by being there for me to talk to about things outside of class!\n\nCollege: North Carolina Wesleyan College\n\nFirst year at FCDS: 6th grade\n\nMy favorite teacher was Mr. Kildahl. I was fortunate enough to have him all four years of high school, and, while he taught me some fascinating photography techniques, he also served as a personal role model of kindness and generosity.\n\nCollege: University of Pennsylvania\n\nFirst year at FCDS: 7th grade\n\nMy favorite teacher and class would be Mr. Trotter's engineering courses. The friendship and student-teacher relationship I have formed with and Mr. Trotter over my high school career has truly been remarkable. We have worked side by side on numerous projects in the engineering building after school, before school, you name it. We feed off of each other's ideas and I am honored to have the privilege to work alongside him on so many projects. I appreciate all he has taught me and will forever value the relationship we have formed.\n\nCollege: North Carolina State University\n\nFirst year at FCDS: 12th grade\n\nMy favorite class was English IV, I loved this class because of the teacher Mrs. Holloway. Mrs. Holloway has been beyond helpful to me this year. Whenever I had a question or just needed some help, she never failed to help me. She has been the best teacher I have had throughout high school, and I cannot thank Mrs. Holloway enough for all she has done for me.\n\nCollege: Hampden-Sydney College\n\nFirst year at FCDS: 9th grade\n\nI am most looking forward to meeting new people in college. It's bittersweet leaving the people I have grown up with, but I am excited to make new friends.\n\nCollege: The University of North Carolina Chapel Hill\n\nFirst year at FCDS: Pre-K\n\nFCDS has prepared me for what's ahead by teaching a majority of my morals and sense of character. With my time at FCDS, I know how to pace myself and how to put in the work to achieve success.\n\nCollege: Clemson University\n\nFirst year at FCDS: Junior Pre-K\n\nMy forever favorite teacher will have to be Mr. Mike Martin. He was the most amazing, fun, outgoing teacher I have had. I had for science in middle school and he made a subject that was always so hard for me so easy to understand and fun to learn. I will forever be grateful and feel so blessed to have learned from Mr. Martin.\n\nFirst year at FCDS: Pre-K\n\nMy favorite FCDS memory was during sophomore year soccer season. We were underdogs in the state tournament, seeded at #7. After defeating our first opponent, we had to face the #2 on their own field. And, in the cold and rain, we triumphed, beating them 3-2 and reaching the program’s first state semi-final in years.\n\nCollege: University of Virginia\n\nFirst year at FCDS: Junior Pre-K\n\nMr. Craven and his orchestra class has been my favorite class even since I started playing the violin in fifth grade. I don’t think anyone cares about the success of their students more than Mr. Craven. Joining the orchestra family was the best decision I have ever made and music is my passion because of Mr. Craven.\n\nCollege: Ohio University\n\nFirst year at FCDS: 6th grade\n\nI am really looking forward to college because I am excited to meet new people, have different experiences, and get out of my comfort zone. I am extremely grateful to FCDS for preparing me for college and I will always remember the memories I made there.\n\nCollege: Wofford College\n\nFirst year at FCDS: 10th grade\n\nI am most looking forward to the freedom I will have in college. I am looking forward to taking a variety of classes but also class specific to my interests. I am also looking forward to meeting lots of new people.\n\nCollege: University of Rhode Island\n\nFirst year at FCDS: 9th grade\n\nMy favorite teacher at FCDS is Mrs. Sutton. She really helped me, not just in the classroom but outside the classroom. She always put a smile on my face and she was always so caring.\n\nCollege: Cape Fear Community College\n\nFirst year at FCDS: Pre-K\n\nMy favorite FCDS memory has been running on the cross country and track and field teams. I had the opportunity to discover a new sport that I ended up loving and also met so many great people during my seven years on the teams.\n\nCollege: University of Vermont\n\nFirst year at FCDS: 9th grade\n\nWhat I’m looking most forward to in college is I get to meet new friends and I know that college is one more step to being in the real world and me being on my own.\n\nCollege: High Point University\n\nFirst year at FCDS: 8th grade\n\nMy favorite memory at Forsyth is competing for a state championship in lacrosse and building relationships with my peers throughout the 4 years. My favorite teacher has got to be John Kildahl. I have spent five years with him. We have a great relationship and he is always there for me if I need someone talk to. FCDS has prepared me in many ways that probably won’t admit going in I didn’t even know how to write an essay but the time management and resources they offer really helped and am forever thankful for. I’m most looking forward to college is being in a new environment and meeting and forging new relationships while being able to play the sport I love at a high level.\n\nCollege: Marist College\n\nFirst year at FCDS: 1st grade\n\nMy favorite memory would have to be playing on the eighth grade basketball team with Coach Winbush. Even though we only won one game, going 1-17, it was an amazing season. My favorite teacher is John Kildahl. He's an awesome teacher and an even better friend.\n\nCollege: High Point University\n\nFirst year at FCDS: Pre-K\n\nThe thing I am looking forward to most in college is being able to go on hikes more often since I will be in Boone which has lots of hiking trails. I have always loved hiking in the mountains, but I had to drive a while to get to the trails, but going to college in Boone will allow me to hike a lot more.\n\nCollege: Appalachian State University\n\nFirst year at FCDS: 9th grade\n\nIn the first semester of my junior year, flying drones with my friends from the drone club on campus and making the drone mixtape (the first video I ever edited) is my favorite memory.\n\nMy favorite teacher is Mr. Trotter and his engineering classes are my favorite. His way of teaching made the difficult engineering concepts easy to understand, and his humor and positivity enabled me to enjoy and appreciate the learning process throughout three years. His patience and encouragement have ensured that I establish confidence in the field of engineering – the confidence needed to inspire me to study engineering in college.\n\nI am most looking forward to continuing pursuing my passions developed over the past several years and to exploring the new environment and to meeting peers who share my passions.\n\nCollege: University of Southern California\n\nFirst year at FCDS: 9th grade\n\nWhat I am most looking forward to in college is being independent, making new friends, and continuing my track and field career. I like to see college as a new beginning and I am ready for everything that lies ahead.\n\nCollege: High Point University"
