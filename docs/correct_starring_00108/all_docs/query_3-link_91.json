        "text": "One of the best parts of the release of Godzilla (2014) from last year is that it brought the big guy back to mainstream moviegoer’s mind. Godzilla is a household name, but for millions of normal people all over the entire world to be reminded of him, and to go see a movie featuring the King of the Monsters, was great. Godzilla was talked about in the US and beyond for the first time in 16 years. The film brought some new fans to the franchise, myself included, though, a little early. The film was first announced at San Diego Comic Con 2012, in July of that year, where at the Warner Brothers panel, director Gareth Edwards surprisingly revealed a concept teaser for the film, announcing it had been greenlit and it was coming. I’m a large movie aficionado, and I saw that the film was coming out and I realized, “I have never seen a Godzilla film. I should do that.” So, the first Godzilla film was saw was 2004’s Godzilla: Final Wars, and after that, I was hooked. And it’s funny because Godzilla: Final Wars was the last Godzilla film, before the release of the 2014 movie, so I started with the last. And funnily, and sadly enough, I have not seen all 29 Godzilla films. There are only four I haven’t seen, Destroy All Monsters, Godzilla vs Gigan, Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla II, and Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla II. But I bought them recently on Blu-Ray, so, this weekend I think I will finally watch them all, so I can now finally say I have seen all the Godzilla films. Though, then again, I have yet to see The Peanuts Movie, and I told a friend I would come over on Saturday, and I still haven’t finished Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Season 2, and the addictiveness of Fallout 4, Call of Duty: Black Ops III, and Halo 5: Guardians, and today’s Friday the 13th, and I usually watch AT LEAST two Friday the 13th movies each Friday the 13th, so……\n\nBut remember when I said that Godzilla (2014) was the first time Godzilla was talked about in 16 years? That is because 16 years prior they released a movie called Godzilla (1998). Well, it’s not literally called Godzilla 1998, but, you know. Anyway, another great thing about the release of Godzilla 2014 is they released TONS of new Godzilla films on DVD and Blu-Ray for the first time ever! Prior to a couple months before the release of the movie, a lot of the movies had not been on Blu-Ray yet, just DVD, some, not even DVD at all, just VHS, and Sony, who owns the rights to the Heisei and Millennium era of Godzilla films (for those that don’t know, there are three separate era’s, or series, of Godzilla films, apart of different timelines. The original movies, released from the 50’s-70’s, is called the Showa series, the films released from the late 80’s to early 90’s is called the Heisei series, the films released in the early 2000’s is called the Millenium series, and some fans are starting to call the new Hollywood series, “The Legendary Series”, after the studio that produces them, Legendary Pictures.) So Sony, who still owns the home video rights to the Heisei and Millennium series, released just about every Godzilla film apart of these two series on Blu-Ray. Though some of them came a lot later. For example, the first film in the Millennium series, Godzilla 2000, did not come out on Blu-Ray until October 2014. So, again, Godzilla (2014) was a really good time for the series, and not only that. Godzilla (1998) did this too. A film studio named Tristar did Godzilla 1998, a studio owned by Sony, so Sony released some films of the Godzilla Heisei series on DVD for the first time around the release of the film, and they brought the Millennium series over to the US on DVD after they released in Japan. So even though they got Godzilla completely wrong in their movie (more on that later, of course) at least they had enough respect and courtesy to release some of the movies for the first time in the US and other Eastern countries, and brought the Millennium series over to us. Also, another thing I should mention is a lot of smaller film distributors brought many films from the Showa era to Blu-Ray and DVD for the first time as well, which was fantastic.\n\nOne of the big significant reasons for this is, as The Angry Video Game Nerd (James Rolfe) said in his Godzilla video, being a Godzilla fan in the late 80’s and early 90’s, wasn’t easy for Americans. All the Godzilla films up to that time had been released on VHS (DVD did not come until 1997) but they weren’t too easy to come by. VHS tapes were a bit pricey back then from what I’ve heard, so the only way for someone to really see these films was to flip through the TV guide and hope one of them would be on (which they were a lot, I’ve heard of adults mention how they use to watch Godzilla films on TV when they were kids) or go to the video store and rent the VHS tape. So, the release of these films on DVD in the late 90’s and early 2000’s, especially the Blu-Ray releases in 2014, is extremely significant. So, in the early 1990’s, I think 1993, Sony announced it had gained the rights from Toho to make it’s own Godzilla movie, making Godzilla fans those 20 years ago crap their pants. There was a HUGE marketing campaign. The film was EVERYWHERE. There were tons of trailers, TV spots, billboards, food tie ins, in fact, Godzilla 1998 is considered to have one of the biggest film campaigns in American history. So the hype was HUGE. And, it was a disappointment. A lot of general moviegoers thought the film was, Meh, and Godzilla fans, oh boy were they furious. I can’t imagine how hardcore fans first reacted to what they saw in May 1998. Especially because the trainwreck of it all is still felt 17 years later. It’s been 17 years and Godzilla fans STILL talk about the film regularly, about how much of a disaster it was, and what could’ve been.\n\nNow I know what you may be thinking of you aren’t really a huge Godzilla fan. Why? What’s the problem with Godzilla (1998)? What is it so hated amongst Godzilla fans, why is Roland Emmerich considered the devil among Godzilla fans? Seriously, I’ve seen Godzilla fans call Roland Emmerich the devil. And also, one of my favorite films of the year so far is The Walk, a Tristar film, and someone on a Godzilla forum said he refused to see it because it was done by Tristar. As you can tell, people REALLY hate Godzilla (1998). But why? Let me explain.\n\nFirst, let’s take a look at the poster.\n\nOk, to be honest, I love the logo of the movie.\n\nLook! He looks huge! And the poster says, Size Does Matter. So, the trailers and posters hid Godzilla’s design which is pretty exciting. We did not really know what this new American Godzilla was gonna look like. And the trailer teased he was gonna be huge! It was really exciting for not just Godzilla fans, but general moviegoers. Godzilla is a very recognizable image:\n\nThe big guy is a very recognizable image. His face, his size, his dorsal fins, his skin texture, it is something very easy to recognize, and should be easy for Hollywood to replicate. Well, they made him look like this:\n\nDoes that look like the picture you see above? No, right? Because it isn’t. That giant T-Rex iguana looking thing is NOT Godzilla! It just isn’t! It’s a dinosaur! I mean, who in god’s name designed this? Who approved this? It’s clear that Tristar did not really care about Godzilla or know about the character. They just heard about Godzilla and thought, “Yeah, so Godzilla is a giant lizard, right! We can do that!” And they made that thing. That is not Godzilla! So, the fact that instead of us seeing that recognizable look of Godzilla, the badass look of him, we could’ve seen that, but instead, we got that. Seriously?! That right there is possibly the biggest reason why Godzilla (1998) is so hated. But not just that. He did not act like Godzilla.\n\nFor example, you know what Godzilla does? He attacks the miltary. He destroys them. Those military soldiers that have families that wanna defend Japan, their country, from a giant creature, Godzilla does not care, he will destroy them. And guess what GINO does in this movie? Oh, he runs away from them:\n\nYeah, that’s right. Godzilla is supposed to view those military soldiers as ANTS, just tiny little bugs that stand in his way and he can destroy easily without much thought. In this movie, GINO is like this,\n\n“Aaaaaah no the military! Those guys are shooting at me! Run away!” Well, to be clear, GINO does kill them, straight up kill them in this movie. And well, I guess he kinda had to run away. As I’m sure you know, Godzilla is practically invincible. As we see in the original Godzilla Japanese films, the military will shoot missiles at the guy, and it’ll just bounce off of him. In this movie, well, a few missiles kill him.\n\nYep, those things that would simply bounce off of him before, kill him. Take his life. Ok, seriously?! Really?! And you know Godzilla’s iconic atomic breath?\n\nWell, the creature in Godzilla (1998) does not use it this movie. Yep, that iconic, badass blue flame of death he uses to wipe out everyone and everything in his path, they decided to take out. Just let that sink it for a moment……\n\nWell, to be fair, there actually is a throwback to it. In the film, the military is chasing the creature, and it turns around and blows on it’s cars, causing them to blow up and cause fiery flames, looking like it’s coming out of his mouth. So at least they allude to it.\n\nAnd not only that, most people view the film as not good. The story was weak, the characters were annoying, and also, it kinda rip offs Jurassic Park. Remember the iconic scene in that movie where the velociraptors chase everyone? Well, this movie rips that off. Towards the last act of Godzilla 1998, they pull this plot point where the creature has babies, and they look like this:\n\nAnd they chase people. Yep.\n\nSo, to sum up the reasons why Godzilla (1998) is so hated, let’s sum it up:\n\nGodzilla Does Not Look Like Godzilla\n\nThe Creature Does Not Act Like Godzilla\n\nIt Dies From Just A Few Missiles\n\nThe Movie Itself Is Not Even That Good\n\nNo Atomic Breath\n\nRips Off Of Jurassic Park\n\nWhich is one of the reasons why so many fans love Godzilla (2014). In that movie, the story was good, the characters were good, and, Godzilla looks like Godzilla:\n\nHe acts like Godzilla:\n\nHe can take a few missiles:\n\nAnd they absolutely NAILED the atomic breath:\n\nGodzilla (2014) is what Godzilla (1998) should’ve been. A large Godzilla that actually looks and acts like Godzilla with atomic breath along with great monster action and a good story to go with it. It was a giant bandage. So, again, almost every Godzilla fan hates Godzilla (1998). And to be honest, I don’t.\n\nNow, I know what you’re thinking if you’re a Godzilla fan,\n\n“YOU DARE?!”\n\nBut, well, I have basically a love-hate relationship with the movie, I love it, and I hate it. I hate it because of what it did to Godzilla. They just butchered the character by messing up everything about him and it was done by people who didn’t even like Godzilla. For those that don’t know, in interviews, director Roland Emmerich and one of the producers said in an interview that the viewed the Godzilla franchise as “A great idea done stupidly by Japan” And thought they were making the superior version. Stubborn jerks…\n\nBut, I also love it because, I think it actually is a good movie. Now, I understand why some people think it isn’t. Sure it was pretty silly. The character’s, story, and some action moments were pretty silly, sure, and the blonde reporter I forget her name did get pretty annoying at times, but, the movie itself is what all action disaster movies should be:\n\nFun\n\nThe movie is very fun and entertaining to watch, and I actually like the characters. Matthew Broderick played an interesting scientist, Hank Azaria had some amusing moments, and Jean Reno’s character was awesome. Also, even though it looked and acted nothing like Godzilla, the creature in the movie, which some people call Zilla, because it is unworthy of the God name, you cannot deny looks pretty cool:\n\nNot Godzilla, but still cool."
