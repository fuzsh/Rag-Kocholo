        "text": "So maybe you caught the last American Godzilla movie and are a little excited about this one because the trailer has 11 from Stranger Things (Millie Bobbie Brown) in it. Or maybe you're an old Godzilla head like me and grew up watching King Kong battle Godzilla and always heard there were two different endings. Well, guess what? There's a lot more to the story of the giant monster that rises out of the sea and destroys Tokyo than you realize. Also, I should add you might also be one of the unfortunate ones whose first experience with the king of the monsters was the monumentally awful Matthew Broderick film that took the worst elements of disaster movies and Jurassic Park and combined them and was advertised by a Taco Bell dog saying \"I think I need a bigger box.\"\n\nIf that is indeed the case then I sincerely apologize for your subpar Godzilla experience and would encourage you to watch almost any other Godzilla movie except for the one with the dream sequences where he's playing with baby Godzilla. Also, you should listen to the new episode of the iHeartRadio Original Podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class where hosts Tracy V. Wilson and Holly Frey look at the origins of Godzilla to prepare us for the release on May 31 of the new film Godzilla: King of the Monsters.\n\nStuff You Missed is a podcast that does a deep dive into one topic per episode utilizing a variety of sources to produce a narrative with context told in a geeky and fun way related by two hosts who are obviously having way too much fun talking about history. Recent episodes include white women as slave owners, the discovery of phosphorus, and premiering this week it's all about the origins of Godzilla in an episode developed in collaboration with Warner Bros. Pictures and featuring insights from the director of the new film Mike Dougherty about how he's created a love letter to the original films that respects the stories origins.\n\nIt turns out that the 1956 film Godzilla: King of the Monsters! starring Raymond Burr that Holly and so many of us great up with was actually an American re-edit of the original Japanese film Gojira released two years earlier.\n\nWhy the change? Studio heads believed that the original films focus on the results of nuclear fallout with its echos of the bombs dropped on Japan during World War II and nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll in the South Pacific between 1946 and 1958 would be uncomfortable for American audiences. So they were mostly removed and Burr was added as a kind of narrator for English-speaking audiences to relate to as a guide to this strange and distant land.\n\nBut Tracy and Holly go a lot deeper than that and tell the story of the production and background of the original film. When Gojira producer Tomoyuki Tonaka pitched Toho about making a monster movie, the company was skeptical about the project because monster movies were seen as the province of American filmmakers starting with King Kong in 1933 and all of its subsequent sequels and rip-offs.\n\nIt took a lot of convincing of everyone involved and the director and designers were so concerned about making what they believed to be a serious film that no one was allowed to see the 200-pound rubber suit that actor Haruo Nakajima wore to portray Godzilla unless the actor was actually in it. Incredibly the whole production was finished in a few months and all of their efforts were worth it - Gojira became the highest grossing Japanese film of 1954.\n\nIn addition to warning audiences about the dangers of radiation, Gojira and its sequels had a sympathy for the monster and wanted to try and understand it, something that's missing from the earlier American films. Holly describes the American approach as \"there's the monster let's kill it.\"\n\nWith all this in mind, director Mike Dougherty says his new film Godzilla: King of the Monsters will hew more strongly to the monsters origin and aesthetic and respect where he came from. The new film premieres in America on May 31 and I think I speak for Kaiju fans everywhere when I say \"I can't wait.\" Hail to the king!"
