As an unnamed kaiju movie it's borderline fantastic.\n\nNov 5, 2021\n\n#8\n\nI actually love the creature design and the buildup to its reveal was decent, but everything else was crap (the acting, the story, the acting). The CG was great for the time, I think.

Will watch it anytime.\n\nNow, is it almost intentionally disrespectful of existing Godzilla lore & design? Yes it is. Does it rip off sequences & camera tricks from multiple other famous blockbusters? Yes it does. Does it go out of its' way to drag Siskel & Ebert through the dirt for the crime of not liking Roland Emmerich's other trash movies? Indeed it does. Still love it.\n\nStrikerrr\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n2,250\n\nNov 5, 2021\n\n#14\n\nNever fully seen it, but I hear Godzilla fans hate it with a passion. In fact, Toho designates it as \"Zilla\" as it took the God out of Godzilla.\n\nmin the plus side, it did spawn a pretty decent animated series that's pretty underrated.\n\nIt was heavily inspired by the success of Jurassic Park, so the 1998 Godzilla is more like a larger T-Rex than a giant monster that stands amongst skyscrapers.\n\nAlso, Godzilla jobs to a bunch of attack helicopters\n\nDeleted member 25606\n\nUser requested account closure\n\nOct 29, 2017\n\n8,973\n\nNov 5, 2021\n\n#15\n\nI thought it was bad. And not just in a \" not a good version of Godzilla but otherwise it's fine\" way, I really just thought it was bad and annoyed me that the Puffy shitposting vocally over Zeppelin song was everywhere and unavoidable for a couple months.\n\nCommodoreKong\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n7,911\n\nNov 5, 2021\n\n#16\n\nThe monster isn't really Godzilla. It's constantly running and hiding from the military and is easily killed by the military when they finally get some clean shots on it.\n\nGodzilla is a nearly indestructible force of nature with a real fighting spirit.\n\nTemascos\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n12,834\n\nNov 5, 2021\n\n#17\n\nA lot of fish.\n\nBut seriously, the military are the most idiotic shooters, they seem to cause more destruction than Godzilla does. Especially when Godzilla slightly ducks they decimate a ton of buildings.\n\nThe only building that seems to be spared is one that Godzilla dry humps.\n\nScarlet Spider\n\nOne Winged Slayer\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n5,823\n\nBrooklyn, NY\n\nNov 5, 2021\n\n#18\n\nGodzilla 1998 is divisive for making the creature a mutated Iguana that is relatively weak and would prefer to avoid confrontation. Compared to its offspring in the sequel cartoon that is actually more like standard Godzilla. I never hated it, I enjoyed it as a child and still enjoy it today. Minus the romance nonsense.\n\nSome fans being unable to get over it and still acting like the movie came to their house and shot their pet. Some people liked it, some hated it, some didn't care. Godzilla went from a tragic beast to a dancing super hero, to a vengeful monster, to an iguana, to a ghost, to a mutated sea creature, to a literal walking plant, to an interdimensional alien. Some incarnations of Godzilla are hated more than others, it's just the nature of things. Your mileage will vary.\n\nBesides Toho even included Godzilla 1998 in their Godzilla calendar for their 67th anniversary a few days ago. He ain't hated like he used to be, at least from what I've seen in Japan.\n\nRyuelli\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n15,209\n\nNov 5, 2021\n\n#19\n\nIt's fun as fuck, I enjoy it quite a bit.\n\nFat4all\n\nWoke up, got a money tag, swears a lot\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n98,448\n\nhere\n\nNov 5, 2021\n\n#20\n\nhow is the military so fucking braindead in every single roland emmerich film\n\nPankratous\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n9,589\n\nNov 5, 2021\n\n#21\n\nIt's my favourite Godzilla film by far\n\nNoisepurge\n\nCorrupted by Vengeance\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n8,838\n\nNov 5, 2021\n\n#22\n\nIt's an entertaining enough film, but just shouldn't be called Godzilla :D stupid characters, stupid ending, just a Jurassic Park ripoff mostly.\n\nBLEEN\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n22,148\n\nNov 5, 2021\n\n#23\n\nI think it's a great Godzilla movie.
