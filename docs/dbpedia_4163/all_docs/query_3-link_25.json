        "text": "I created NOVA in 2018 as a response to the challenges imposed by the theatre space I was working in back then. The small stage and unconventional architecture of the place required an innovative idea, so I came up with NOVA. From the beginning, NOVA was a project about being in the present and finding joy in exploring new ways of experiencing art with curiosity.\n\nSince its first edition was created in a theatre space, the program reflected a great amount of performances. But since, NOVA has outgrown these beginnings. It is mainly an approach to life behind NOVA. Expanding technologies help us get jiggy in this dance of co-creating interesting universes through interactions. However, it's not about the technologies but how these new tools create a context for growth. Technology makes art more alive in many dimensions. How thrilling for us to have the opportunity to experience creativity this way! For sure, you will take that experience with you and expand it in your life.\n\nThe 2022 edition starts on November 22nd with a splendid performance-lecture held by Sougwen 愫君 Chung at Excelsior Theater and live-streamed on the Streamerse platform.\n\nWhat I love about Sougwen most is her unique way of embodying technology and working with it in a very personal way. How she draws with her self-created machines is so beautiful to discover.\n\nThen, we open the immersive exhibition at Goethe Institut on November 23rd. This space is really, for me and the artists that have works there, a journey of self-exposure, while for the audience, we propose a journey of self-discovery. We put some very personal parts of ourselves in this exhibition space, and hopefully, this creates a context where people feel safe to bring themselves in a similarly personal way.\n\nWhat I love about the exhibition this year is that it is created to be in constant change. Just like our emotions, the space's sound, image and tactile language transform in real-time, following the dynamic of the people in it. So the exhibition will never sound, feel, or look exactly the same.\n\nFinally, NOVA has also developed into a growth platform for artists and audiences. We have an extensive program of workshops, talks, lab-like performances, and now even an educational residency program in Slovenia we offer to a young Romania artist, together with our partners at DDT Lab. The deadline for applications is December 1st."
