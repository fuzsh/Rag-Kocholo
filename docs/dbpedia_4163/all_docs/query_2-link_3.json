        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nA large portion of present-day Moldovan territory became a province of the Russian Empire in 1812 and then unified with Romania in 1918 in the aftermath of World War I. This territory was then incorporated into the Soviet Union at the close of World War II. Although Moldova has been independent from the Soviet Union since 1991, Russian forces have remained on Moldovan territory east of the Nistru River in the breakaway region of Transnistria.\n\nYears of Communist Party rule in Moldova from 2001 to 2009 ultimately ended with election-related violent protests and a rerun of parliamentary elections in 2009. A series of pro-Europe ruling coalitions governed Moldova from 2010 to 2019, but pro-Russia candidate Igor DODON won the presidency in 2016, and his Socialist Party of the Republic of Moldova won a plurality in the legislative election in 2019. Pro-EU reformist candidate Maia SANDU defeated DODON in his reelection bid in 2020, and SANDU's Party of Action and Solidarity won a parliamentary majority in an early legislative election in 2021. Prime Minister Natalia GAVRILITA and her cabinet took office in 2021. In early 2023, Moldova's parliament confirmed a new cabinet led by Prime Minister Dorin RECEAN, which retained the majority of the former ministers.\n\n√Ç\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\ntotal: 3,599,528\n\nmale: 1,698,249\n\nfemale: 1,901,279 (2024 est.)\n\ncomparison rankings : female 131; male 134; total 132\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Moldovan(s)\n\nadjective: Moldovan\n\nEthnic groups\n\nMoldovan 75.1%, Romanian 7%, Ukrainian 6.6%, Gagauz 4.6%, Russian 4.1%, Bulgarian 1.9%, other 0.8% (2014 est.)\n\nLanguages\n\nMoldovan/Romanian 80.2% (official) (56.7% Moldovan; 23.5% Romanian), Russian 9.7%, Gagauz 4.2% (a Turkish language), Ukrainian 3.9%, Bulgarian 1.5%, Romani 0.3%, other 0.2% (2014)\n\nmajor-language sample(s):\n\nCartea informativa a lumii, sursa indispensabila pentru informatii de baza.

Moldova√¢¬Ä¬ôs aspirations to join the EU have encouraged the government and regulator to adopt a range of measures to bring the country√¢¬Ä¬ôs telecoms sector into line with EU principles and standards; in July 2017 the Electronic Communications Act was amended to accommodate the 2009 European regulatory framework, while further amendments were adopted in December 2017 and additional changes were proposed in 2019; Moldova is also part of the Eastern Partnership group of countries, and as such has set in train a glidepath to reducing roaming charges, effective between 2022 and 2026; the country√¢¬Ä¬ôs broadband strategy through to 2025 has been supported by the ITU and industry counterparts from Korea; the internet market is developing rapidly, and though the penetration rate is well below the average for most European countries there are many opportunities for further development; the number of cable broadband subscribers is increasing steadily, though fiber is now by far the strongest sector; by the end of 2020 fiber accounted for about 72.3% of all fixed broadband connections; the mobile market has also grown rapidly, and the sector accounts for the majority of total telecoms revenue; the launch of LTE services has opened up a new revenue growth opportunity centered on mobile broadband; the near comprehensive geographical reach of their mobile networks, market brand recognition and existing customer relationships will make for steady subscriber growth in coming years\n\n(2024)\n\ndomestic: fixed-line service is 29 per 100; mobile cellular tele density is 127 per 100 persons (2022)\n\ninternational: country code - 373; service through Romania and Russia via landline; satellite earth stations - at least 3 - Intelsat, Eutelsat, and Intersputnik\n\nBroadcast media\n\nstate-owned national radio-TV broadcaster operates 1 TV and 1 radio station; a total of nearly 70 terrestrial TV channels and some 50 radio stations are in operation; Russian and Romanian channels also are available (2019)\n\nBroadband - fixed subscriptions\n\ntotal: 719,001 (2020 est.)\n\nsubscriptions per 100 inhabitants: 18 (2020 est.)\n\ncomparison ranking : total 80\n\nMilitary and Security\n\nMilitary and security forces\n\nArmed Forces of the Republic of Moldova (For√à¬õele Armate ale Republicii Moldova): National Army (comprised of a General Staff, a Land Forces Command, and an Air Force Command); Ministry of Internal Affairs: General Carabinieri Inspectorate (aka Carabinieri Troops or Trupele de Carabinieri) (2024)\n\nnote 1: the Carabinieri is a quasi-militarized gendarmerie responsible for protecting public buildings, maintaining public order, and other national security functions\n\nnote 2:√Ç the national police force reports to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and is the primary law enforcement body, responsible for internal security, public order, traffic, border security, and criminal investigations; the Moldovan Border Police (Poli√à¬õiei de Frontier√Ñ¬É) are under the Ministry of Internal Affairs; prior to 2012, Border Police were under the armed forces and known as the Border Troops\n\nMilitary expenditures\n\n0.5% of GDP (2023 est.)\n\n0.4% of GDP (2022 est.)\n\n0.4% of GDP (2021 est.)\n\n0.4% of GDP (2020 est.)\n\n0.4% of GDP (2019 est.)\n\ncomparison ranking : 160\n\nMilitary and security service personnel strengths\n\napproximately 6,500 active-duty troops; approximately 2,000 Carabinieri (2023)\n\nMilitary equipment inventories and acquisitions\n\nthe military's inventory is limited and almost entirely comprised of older Russian and Soviet-era equipment; in recent years, it has received donated equipment from other nations, including the US (2024)\n\nMilitary service age and obligation\n\n18-27 years of age for compulsory or voluntary military service; male registration required at age 16; 12-month service obligation (2024)\n\nnote: as of 2021, women made up about 20% of the military's full-time personnel\n\nMilitary - note\n\nthe National Army is responsible for defense against external aggression, suppressing illegal military violence along the state border or inside the country, and supporting other internal security forces in maintaining public order if necessary; its primary focuses are Transnistrian separatist forces and their Russian backers; the 1992 war between Moldovan forces and the Transnistrian separatists backed by Russian troops ended with a cease-fire; the separatists maintain several armed paramilitary combat units, plus other security forces and reserves; Russia maintains approximately 1,500 troops in the breakaway region, including some Transnistrian locals who serve as Russian troops; some troops are under the authority of a peacekeeping force known as a Joint Control Commission that also includes Moldovan and separatist personnel, while the remainder of the Russian contingent (Operational Group of Russian Forces - Transnistria or OGF-T) guard a depot of Soviet-era ammunition and train Transnistrian separatist forces\n\nMoldova is constitutionally neutral but has maintained a relationship with NATO since 1992; bilateral cooperation started when Moldova joined NATO√¢¬Ä¬ôs Partnership for Peace program in 1994; Moldova has contributed small numbers of troops to NATO√¢¬Ä¬ôs Kosovo Force (KFOR) since 2014, and a civilian NATO liaison office was established in Moldova in 2017 at the request of the Moldovan Government to promote practical cooperation and facilitate support (2023)"
