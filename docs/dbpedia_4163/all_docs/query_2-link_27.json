        "text": "Communist Occupation and Dictatorship in Moldova (1918-1941; 1944-1991)\n\nThe present-day territory of the Republic of Moldova is comprised of two distinct areas, both of which have specific historical legacies. The first one represents two thirds of historical Bessarabia and a small part, about one tenth, of the left bank of the Dniester River, known also as Transnistria, in Romanian, or Pridnestrov’e, in Russian.\n\nBessarabia and Transnistria had different and divergent backgrounds in many respects, such as the timing of their settlement, state traditions, ethnic composition, linguistic diversity and political culture. For more than four centuries, Bessarabia was part of the medieval and early modern principality of Moldavia, stretching from the Carpathian Mountains in the west to the Dniester River in the east, and from Poland’s borders in the north to the Black Sea and Danube delta in the south (totalling around 94,000 km²) while Transnistria had never been an integral part of the Principality of Moldavia.\n\nSituated between several great powers, namely the Ottoman Empire, Hungary and Poland, Moldavia succeeded in fighting either one of them individually or in alliance with one of them for about one century. It prospered and fought successfully especially against the Ottomans, under the legendary ruler Stephen the Great between 1457 and 1504. It is generally acknowledged that he lost only two out of 36 battles.\n\nThe 1484 Ottoman seizure of the fortresses of Chilia and Cetatea Albă located on the Danube mouths, and Dniester Liman respectively, anticipated the downfall of the Moldavian Principality. Both fortresses became the Ottomans’ first strongholds in the northern Black Sea region and were consequently converted into military bases (raya)[i].\n\nIn 1514 Moldavia finally succumbed to the Sublime Porte. In contrast to most areas south of the Danube and parts of Hungary after 1526 which became pashalyks, i.e. integral parts of the Ottoman Empire, Moldavia and the other Romanian principality, Wallachia maintained autonomy status.\n\nOnly after a row of attempts by the local voivodes to shake off their Ottoman rulers did the Sultan decide to establish a tighter grip on Moldavia by creating more rayas along the Dniester River. After an abortive attempt to shook the Ottoman yoke was made in 1538 by a son of Stephen the Great, Petru Rareș, two rayas have been established, at Ismail, on the mouths of Danube, and Bender (Tighina, in Romanian). A more northern raya was established at Hotin in 1716 after the final and most important failed uprising by a Moldavian prince, Dimitrie Cantemir (1709-1711)[ii].\n\nThe strategic importance of the region was clear, as the Russian Empire’s Peter the Great was present to support the Moldavian troops in the decisive battle, at Stănilești, on the Prut River. Cantemir’s alliance with Russia was signed at the Treaty of Lutsk (April 13, 1711) following Peter’s victory over Sweden at Poltava and the subsequent refusal by the Ottomans to turn over King Charles XII sheltered at Varnița, near the fortress of Bender[iii]. Other Turkish-Russian wars followed in the next two centuries over the dominance of the Balkans. Following the Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji in 1774, the Tsarist Empire gained the right to protect Christians in the Ottoman Empire and intervene in case the Turks would abuse the Christians in Moldavia and Wallachia.\n\nMeanwhile the Austrians, also participating in the war effort against the Turks, annexed in 1775 the northern part of Moldavia and renamed it Bukovina which tempted the Russians to get their share as well. The next Turkish-Russian war of 1787-1792 was equally successful for Saint Petersburg. In accordance with the Treaty of Jassy (January 1792) Russia annexed the northern Black Sea territories, including present-day Transnistria and, most notably, the area that would become modern-day Odessa. Transnistria, now part of the Republic of Moldova, has never been a part of the Principality of Moldavia, except for a few years in the 17th century when Gheorghe Duca, the voivode of Moldavia, was also named hetman of Ukraine (1680-1684).\n\nIt thus took until the late 18th century for the Principality of Moldavia to share a border with the Tsarist Empire along the Dniester River for the very first time. However, Russia did not stop there and annexed the Eastern part of the Principality of Moldavia from the Ottoman Empire. Following the Treaty of Bucharest (May 1812), the new territory was named Bessarabia and had natural borders in the east (Dniester), west (Prut) and south (Black Sea). Previously, only a tiny area in the south close to the Danube delta had been called Bessarabia in memory of a short period in the 15th century when it was seized by Wallachia and ruled by the Bessarab dynasty. This would be the last territorial acquisition of the Tsarist Empire in the South East Europe[iv].\n\nBetween 1818 and 1871, Bessarabia was an oblast’ in the Russian Empire and was turned into a gubernia until 1917. Only for a short period, from 1818 to 1828, did Bessarabia enjoy a degree of autonomy comparable with that of Finland or Poland[v]. The linguistic Russification of the province was driven by the Orthodox Church, especially after 1859 when Western Moldavia united with Wallachia to create the modern Romanian state. By the early 1860s all publications and educational materials in Romanian/Moldavian were prohibited altogether.\n\nThe share of Romanian-speaking Moldavians would decrease steadily from about 80 % in 1818 to 47 % in 1897 when the first imperial census took place. Though some historians contest the accuracy of these findings, it is beyond doubt that huge ethno-demographic changes took place and were caused by a wide range of policies: administrative Russification, linguistic and educational Russification, and the colonisation of southern Bessarabia by Bulgarians, Gagauz and Germans. The south which was termed Budzhak by the Turks had been granted to the Crimean Nogai Tatars prior to 1812, so they could use it as pastureland for livestock breeding. After 1812, the Tartars were resettled in Crimea and thus the area was had to be populated[vi].\n\nThe national Moldavian movement emerged slowly and rather late compared to those in Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and even Ukraine. Only after 1898 were the graduates of the Chișinău seminary, usually the sons of rural priests and the backbone of the future, the national elites, were admitted for university studies in main imperial cities or towns with a university tradition.\n\nAfter graduating from the universities in Kyiv, Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Odessa and especially Dorpat (Tartu) most of these students returned home. In time, they would become leaders of the national revivals of 1905-1907 and 1917-1918 as well as in the interwar years. Some Bessarabian intellectuals first turned into narodniks and were exiled to Siberia.\n\nOne way of escaping Tsarist repression was to flee to Romania. Constantin Stere and Zamfir Arbore are just two examples[vii]. In the tumultuous first Russian Revolution between 1905 and 1907, Stere helped the local intelligentsia to publish the first Latin-alphabet newspaper called Basarabia which was consequently prohibited by the Russian authorities following the publication of the Romanian national hymn Wake up, Romanian! [viii]\n\nJust like the Soviets later, the Tsarist regime tolerated national intelligentsia and the expression of national identity in a narrow, regional sense. Still, it was – for understandable reasons – unacceptable for the Tsarist administration to even consider accepting the incorporation of the Romanian-speaking population of Bessarabia into what would soon become the nation state of Romania.\n\nAt the end of the First World War, the nations within the Russian Empire witnessed a period of extraordinary national revival. The hard experiences in the trenches of the Eastern Front and the abrogation of monarchy in early 1917 contributed to the rise of cultural, linguistic and, most importantly, political nationalism of non-Russians.\n\nThe Bessarabian soldiers mobilised in the Russian Army numbered around 300,000 and became the leading social strata to push for change in both the political and national sense in 1917. The soldiers’ Congress of Bessarabians in Odessa decided to establish the Sfatul Țării, the Council of the Country.\n\nThe latter was convoked in its first session on December 2nd 1917 in Chișinău and declared the creation of the Democratic Moldavian Republic (DMR) as an integral part of the future Russian Federation. Much like other similar institutions formed by other nations within the former Russian Empire, the Sfatul Țării was a quasi-parliament created to decide on the nation’s fate on the principle of representation of all main social, religious, ethnic and political groups.\n\nShortly after the Bolsheviks disbanded on January 6th 1918 (old style) the only legally representative institution of Russia, the Constituent Assembly, the Sfatul Țării adopted the declaration of independence of the DMR on January 24th 1918. Following the Bolshevik peace of Brest-Litovsk with the German Empire in early March, the Sfatul Țării declared the union of Bessarabia with Romania on March 27th 1918 (April 9, new style). Curiously, the union was endorsed by representatives of both Entente (France and Britain) and Central Powers (Germany)[ix].\n\nSoviet Russia, however, did not recognise the union of Bessarabia with Romania and tried to regain the former territory of the Russian Empire, first by staging a rebellion at Bender in May 1919, and later at Tatarbunar in September 1924[x]. Both failed because of the lack of societal support. Following the second failed rebellion, Moscow decided to create an Autonomous Moldavian Republic on the left bank of the Dniester River on October 12th 1924.\n\nComprising only 30 % of the Romanian-speaking population, the establishment of the MASSR was the first application of the so-called Piedmont principle within the Soviet nationalities policy and was aimed at the internationalisation of the Bessarabian issue[xi]. The interwar MASSR served as a kind of laboratory for policies to be implemented later in the Soviet-occupied Bessarabia in 1940-1941 and after 1944.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful attempt at creating a new Moldavian language based on local popular vernacular without any literary tradition, Moscow pursued a policy of Romanianisation from 1932 to 1938.\n\nThe Latin alphabet was introduced and modern Romanian, which was already the literary standard of Bessarabia and Romania, was adopted in the areas of education and culture[xii]. Behind the idea of Romanianisation in the MASSR was the goal to create a new, national, Communist elite which would Sovietise Bessarabia in the future and prepare spies and agitators fluent in Romanian to be sent to Romanian Bessarabia in the 1930s. As a result of the Great Terror of 1937-1938, however, the very elite created by Moscow was decimated on Stalin’s orders even though he was the one to introduce Romanianisation in the early 1930s.\n\nIn the late 1930s, Moscow perceived the national Communist elites of the MASSR as potential enemies and spies. This meant that during the summer of 1940 when the Red Army occupied Bessarabia, the Soviet Union could not rely on a national elite fluent in Romanian to rule Bessarabia. The members of the clandestine Bessarabian section of the Romanian Communist Party, with just a few exceptions, were denied co-option in power both in 1940-1941, and after 1944.\n\nPolitical movements and parties in Bessarabia, 1870s - 1918\n\nThe classic Soviet narrative on the revolutionary movement in Tsarist Bessarabia begins with the early 1820s. At that time, Chișinău hosted several circles and personalities that would later be known as members or supporters of the Dekabrists. Indeed, Chișinău was one of the main centres in southern Russia to witness the establishment of would-be-Dekabrist organisations initiated and led by M.F. Orlov, the chief of the 16th division which found itself relocated in the Bessarabian capital.\n\nOther important members of the rebellious intelligentsia were V.F. Rayevski, K. A. Okhotnikov P.S. Pushchin, and A. G. Nepenin. Alexander Pushkin, the greatest Russian poet, often attended the meetings of the Chișinău organisation while being exiled in the region (1820-1823)[xiii].\n\nThe second most important political idea to bring about modern political parties in the Russian Empire was the Narodnik tradition, animated by the organisation called the Will of the People. In Bessarabia, this current was represented in the 1870s-1880s by Russian revolutionaries N. G. Kulyabko-Koretski and A. A. Kvyatkovski alongside the Moldavians N.G. Zubcu-Codreanu and C. F. Ursu[xiv]. Along with Odessa and Rostov-on-Don, Chișinău was the third city in the southern part of the Empire to register activities of the Union of Workers from southern Russia led by E. O. Zaslavsky (1875). The first circle of workers attended mainly by railway workers was established in Bessarabia in 1880 by F.M. Denish.\n\nSoon after the first volume of Marx’s Capital was published in the Russian language in Saint Petersburg in 1872, it also entered the private libraries of Bessarabian intellectuals. Just like in other parts of the Empire, however, decades passed until the first Marxist groups would convene. Marxist organisations in Chișinău were set up in 1896, its membership largely made up by workers, intelligentsia and students.\n\nFour years later, in January 1900, a social democratic circle with members such as M. Veltman-Pavlovich, Ja. Bograd, I. Basovski, M. Volgin, L. Gimpshman, R. Duganov and V. Broască was founded[xv]. The Chișinău Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Party of Workers (RSDPW) was set up in December 1902.\n\nIn 1907, the local organisation of the RSDPW had 350 members, whereas the Mensheviks and Bolsheviks combined saw their support dwindle to just 30 in 1909, a result of years of discontent[xvi]. Their impact on society as a whole was rather limited in comparison to that in other important industrial centres of the Russian Empire – simply put, there was no proper social basis for such radical political ideas.\n\nBy 1900, Bessarabia was a backwater of Tsarism, mainly an agricultural area with a tiny share of industry and an insignificant proletariat. In 1902, there were just about 130 small industrial enterprises in the gubernia of Bessarabia, only 3,500 workers and around 30,000 artisan workers altogether. In 1907, these local businesses would average between two and nine workers each.\n\nThis is one of the main reasons it was difficult to organise mass strikes against small salaries, bad working conditions and other issues that affected the everyday life of the working class and poor urban population more generally. Between 1901-1903, 19 small-scale strikes were organised in Chișinău and several other towns. Lenin’s Iskra was published in Chișinău in 1902-1903 and allegedly became a success story with the local social democrats. It had already been published abroad previously.\n\nIn contrast, the peasant rebellions were bigger in terms of participants and area affected, but it is not very clear what role Mensheviks, Bolsheviks or Social-Revolutionaries (SR) played in stirring up the mass protests that would often turn violent. Between 1901-1904 at least 25 peasant protests were officially reported; the biggest and most violent was the protest in Trifănești, Soroca county, with 600 participants[xvii]. The apogee of the peasant uprisings coincided with the first Russian Revolution (1905-1907). About 100 violent peasant protests were registered[xviii].\n\nThese actions involved burning the landowners’ properties which would regularly prompt the brutal intervention of police forces and even the military. The revolution was followed by a period which saw the implementation of harsh measures as to discourage mass protest and hamper any further democratisation of Russia. One of the strategies pursued by the Tsarist regime to maintain its hold on power was to displace traditional rural communities.\n\nBearing certain positive economic results, the new policy known as the Stolypin reforms led to the large-scale voluntary resettlement of peasants across the Russian Empire. Some 60,000 Bessarabians migrated to Siberia and Kazakhstan between 1907-1914, two thirds of whom would never return. The resettlement policy did not, however, help ease the social tensions in rural areas.\n\nIn 1911-1913 alone, more than 50 peasant rebellions were officially registered in Bessarabia. Their causes were diverse; in some cases protests targeted peasants that had only recently become rich as a result of the Stolypin reforms. The other target of dissatisfaction were the landowners who would often suffer arson and destruction of property similar to the disruption in 1905-1907.\n\nThe extent of the peasants‘ discontent on the eve of the First World War is testified by a high number of fines applied by authorities against rural inhabitants during that time. Between 1910-1913, around 18,000 fines were registered[xix].\n\nIn the more urban areas, the post-1907 reactionary policies accelerated the further fragmentation of the political spectrum as well. In 1910, out of the 51 Chișinău City Duma members 22 represented monarchists, there were 22 Octobrists, one Constitutional Democrat (cadet), and six representatives of other political parties.\n\nThe social democrats enjoyed a certain support among the working class. This was especially true with respect to Mensheviks and Bundists (half of the population of Chișinău was Jewish). The Bolsheviks were not particularly popular and did not figure as an important political organization.\n\nThe outbreak of WWI in 1914 created further turmoil amidst the rural dwellers. Taxes went up, and food requisitioning became commonplace in 1916. In the beginning of that year, around 250,000 Bessarabians, mainly peasants, were drafted into the Russian Army.\n\nAnother 72,000 were mobilised for various military support roles, such as digging trenches. In addition, horses were requisitioned for the front. These policies added further hurdles to the agricultural sector which now suffered a shortage of both manpower and draft animals. This is not to say that the urban population remained unaffected by the war; access to staple food became difficult and became unaffordable.\n\nThe war also pressured the Russian Empire into a massive overhaul and expansion of its railway network. In early 1917, there were about 80,000 workers mobilised for railway and defense constructions, the majority of them coming from Ukraine and Russia. The newcomers ended up strengthening the social base for anti-Tsarist and left-leaning parties.\n\nHowever, time and again, the winners in this battle for the masses were by no means the Bolsheviks. The Mensheviks and SR started dominating the local Soviets in late March 1917 until the end of that year. The local Bolshevik organisations became stronger in November-December 1917 after Lenin’s followers were sent in, mainly from Petrograd and Moscow. For much of 1917, the new republic witnessed tensions between the Provisional Government and the Soviets, and other tertiary actors.\n\nIn Bessarabia, the Sfatul Țării, the Council of the Country, became the third important actor in the struggle for power. Since fall 1917, the council had been largely dominated by the organisations of the Bessarabian/Moldavian soldiers set up in Odessa and Kiev. Created on the same principles as the Ukrainian Rada, the Sfatul Țării sought to reconcile various social, political and ethnic divisions in Bessarabia. Initially, it comprised 120 members, later expanding its membership to 150. Two thirds of the seats went to ethnic Moldavians/Romanians which by no means formed a politically united front. The remaining third of the council’s seats went to ethnic minorities.\n\nThe greatest political party represented in the Sfatul Țării was the Moldavian National Party (about 100 members) which was in favour of uniting with Romania. The second-most important faction was the Peasant Bloc which focused on agrarian reforms rather than cultural and educational questions.\n\nThe Mensheviks, SR and Bolsheviks had their own factions as well. Lenin’s adepts were in the minority in most of the local Soviets, including in Chișinău. All parties, including the Bolsheviks, recognised the legitimacy of the Sfatul Țării. In late December 1917-early January 1918, however, the authority of the latter started to be contested violently. This change was triggered by the decision of leaders of the Sfatul Țării to ask the Romanian government to send troops to Bessarabia.\n\nThe demobilisation of the Russian Army on the Romanian front resulted in anarchy and lawlessness; crime was rampant. General Shcherbatchev, commander of the Russian troops, endorsed the idea of sending Romanian troops to Bessarabia in order to re-establish public order as quickly as possible.\n\nFor the Bolsheviks, the prospect of an incursion by the Romanian Army was unacceptable. Thus, they launched a military offensive modelled on a battle used by their party in Petrograd in late October 1917. The Bolsheviks were strengthened not just by cadres sent in from the centre and Odessa (Rumcherod), but also as a result of their proficient use of propaganda, leading to some success in mobilising a part of the local population in support of their cause."
