These documents are included in the State Archival Fund.\n\nStored documents are organised in files that are included in fonds. All fonds have inventories and other tools for searching the required information. Most of the fonds are in Russian.\n\nANRM holds 96,1102 archival files organised in 2,043 fonds and collections. ANRM Audiovisual Fund comprises 15,590 cinema documents, 228,767 photographic documents and 5,624 phonograph documents.\n\nThe most important fonds of original documents reflecting the social, economic, cultural and administrative life of Moldova for XV-XIX centuries are the collection of Moldovan medieval acts which covers the period 1420-1904 and the fond of „Senatorilor preşedinţi în Divanurile Principatelor Moldovei şi Valahiei, anii 1808-1812” (Senators presidents ruling principalities Moldavia and Vallachia, 1808-1812).\n\nThe Russian Empire Administration of Bessarabia is reflected in many collections of documents, among the most important are: \"Chancellery of the governor of Bessarabia, 1793-1919\"; \"The Regional Council of Bessarabia, 1818-1873\" and \"Administration of Bessarabia region, 1828-1918\", as well as fonds of other institutions from that period.\n\nA valuable section of information is represented by the documents that reflect the history of Bessarabia as part of Romania (1918-1940, 1941-1944). Various information, however incomplete, can be found in the documents of the fonds of administrative bodies of Bessarabia, as such as: \"Sfatul Ţării, 1917-1918\"; \"General Commissariat of Bessarabia, 1917-1918\"; \"Governmental Commissariat of Bessarabia and Bucovina, 1924-1927\" and \"The Cabinet of Administration of Bessarabia, Bucovina, and Transnistria, 1941-1944\". Particularly relevant for research into the history of local towns and villages are the fonds of counties' prefectures, praetures and city halls.\n\nMSSR history, since 1940, and then from 1944 is reflected in the documents of the central administration (government), ministries, state committees and commissions, prosecution and judiciary bodies, industrial enterprises, cultural and educational institutions etc.\n\nOver time ANRM took over a number of 170 fonds of personal origins. These fonds are comprised of personal documents and creation materials of scientists and culture personalities.\n\nPrimăria oraşului Tighina\n\nТигинская городская примария\n\nTiginskaya gorodskaya primariya\n\nArhiva Naţională a Republicii Moldova\n\n1354.2\n\nEnglish, Russian\n\n1926\n\n79 items\n\nUpdated 5 years ago\n\nCorrespondence on administrative issues and the issuing certificates of Romanian citizenship to the residents of the town of Tigina' petitions by the residents of the county to become members of the organization of the “National Revival Front”; citizenship of the residents of the town of Tigina; correspondence with the Tigina police on the provision of material assistance to the families repressed by the Soviet authorities; reports of the Tighina police about the trustworthiness of individuals; lists of persons, repressed by Soviet power; the case of the issuance of passports to the residen..."
