        "text": "Hollywood has a complicated history with sound and deafness. The silent era of film was accessible to deaf, hard-of-hearing and hearing audiences alike, but once sound became an integral part of the global film industry, equal access for deaf and hard-of-hearing audiences was sidelined.\n\nNowadays, we are seeing more access again in movie theatres – with captioned sessions for some screenings – and also more storylines featuring deaf and hard-of-hearing characters. But what about the actors who play those characters, and hearing characters too?\n\nThough they might have received limited attention from the mainstream press, there are many actors on screen today who are deaf or hard-of-hearing and who have gained respect and awards for their powerful performances.\n\nWe highlight 17 of them here as part of our Famous Deaf People series. You can also read about famous deaf people who changed the world, and famous deaf and hard-of-hearing musicians on our blog.\n\nNyle DiMarco\n\nNyle DiMarco shot to fame when he won America’s Next Top Model in 2015.\n\n“Not many people realize, actually, my entire family is deaf,” DiMarco said in an interview with Yahoo Life. “I myself am the fourth generation in my family — meaning my two brothers, my parents, my grandparents and even my great-grandparents were all deaf.”\n\nAs such, DiMarco’s first language is American Sign Language (ASL), though he’s also fluent in English and reads lips.\n\nIn 2013, DiMarco had a leading role in the independent film In the Can, an American Sign Language Films movie. Then, in 2015, America’s Next Top Model reached out.\n\n“I thought that they probably weren’t ready to have a deaf person on the show,” DiMarco said. “I sent in my audition video anyway. All of it was in sign language with captions, fully accessible, and turns out, they liked it.” DiMarco was also the winner of Dancing with the Stars in 2016.\n\nDiMarco has used his platform to raise awareness about deaf culture and accessibility. Watch his satirical video about reality show Love Is Blind below.\n\nMarlee Matlin\n\nMarlee Matlin is, to date, the only deaf performer to have won an Academy Award.

There are so many opportunities for authentic deaf and hard-of-hearing representation in television and film. The industry just needs to take action on realizing them.\n\nThese actors have lead the way in many respects, and many of them are also great advocates for others in the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.\n\nThe television and film industries are also learning more about captioning content, but they’re absolutely not perfect. Pushing for this accessibility is why organisations like Ai-Media exist!"
