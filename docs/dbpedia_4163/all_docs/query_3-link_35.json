        "text": "In the Forest of the Impaled by Lotte Laub\n\nPublished in: Anton Roland Laub. LAST CHRISTMAS (of Ceaușescu), ed. by Frizzi Krella, Heidelberg: Kehrer, 2020.\n\nTranslated from the German by Bridget Schäfer\n\nHearing is, among other things, the organ of fear. While the eye catches its prey, the ear listens to what makes prey of us. But when we are repeatedly exposed to an acoustic signal, we soon stop listening to it; our reaction declines to the point that it completely disappears. In Nicolae Ceaușescu’s last speech from the balcony of the Central Committee building on 21 December 1989, he calls “Hello!” into the microphone fifteen times. He starts his speech repeatedly, but the crowd no longer reacts to him; the mood has changed. One day later he and Elena Ceaușescu flee by helicopter from the building’s roof. The couple is executed on Christmas Day 1989.\n\nCeaușescu’s cries of “Hello” run together to form an endless echo. Just as typewriter bars catch in each other and get stuck, the repeated “Hello” indicates the total gridlock of a system that has lost all connection to reality, that has become self-referential and hermetically sealed off.\n\nMao-Cescu was the name given to the dictator behind his back – although it is said that his personality cult exceeded even Mao’s. Ceaușescu was elected Secretary General of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party (Partidul Comunist Român, PCR) in 1965. He was the only head of state in the Soviet bloc who criticised the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia that put down the Prague Spring uprising in 1968, which initially earned him approval within Romania and the West; after his trips to China and North Korea in 1971, however, his behaviour changed dramatically. What is known as the “mini cultural revolution” initiated the end of the culturally more liberal phase in Romania. Ceaușescu’s stubborn determination to pay off the country’s external debt, and the resulting economic decline, starved his own population that was at the same time supposed to provide him with cheering crowds.\n\nPoems revering the “beloved Conducător” were published; the pronoun referring to him was written in capital letters. “HE” was presented as the epitome of courage, dedication, honesty and intelligence: as the “Titan of Titans”, as the “mountain that towers over the country”, “proudest fir tree”, “glorious oak of Scornicești“ (his home village), “world’s honey”, the “elected one”. Ceaușescu’s portrait was painted in the style of saints’ pictures. His biography took the form of a hagiography. As a child, it was said, he told to his brothers, who were afraid of wild animals, in biblical tone: “Come with me and fear not”. A splendid album was published for his 60th birthday, in which Adrian Păunescu wrote a poem of 27 stanzas called “The Man of the Country”: “I don’t dare speak his name. I fear that I may reduce his greatness by speaking of him. Yet history demands it of me. We should all love him: he who embodies victory in the battle for mankind.” Later stanzas (from 1989) show that this was merely sycophantic flattery: “Look at him, this inhuman face with its Neolithic jaw. This illiterate who wants to teach us all like a lisping snake”.\n\nElena Ceaușescu was a textile worker and communist activist in the 1930s; later, she had important positions in the communist party. She left school at fourteen and never went to university, yet she was awarded a PhD and even became president of the Romanian Academy. In this way she was celebrated as a “world-renowned scholar”. Privately, she was passionately interested in designer fashion and furs – in contrast to the dictator couple’s misleadingly modest appearance as presented in public.\n\nThe filming of national epics was also part of the personality cult. Historical heroes were called on to serve Romania’s national communism. They were intended to underpin the legitimacy of Ceaușescu’s rule. Films about well-known luminaries of history from the Dacian period, the Middle Ages and the early modern age – Decebalus, Michael the Brave (Mihai Viteazul), and Stephen the Great (Ștefan cel Mare) were already the subjects of great historical films. Finally, the only candidate left was Vlad Țepeș, alias Dracula, who just needed to be shown in the right light. Since 1462, when the Sultan’s army discovered the “Forest of the Impaled”, a plain covered with heads of Turks and other victims impaled on stakes, in Târgoviște – capital of Wallachia until the 19th century – Vlad was always known as Vlad the Impaler, due to this cruel method of execution. Now he was to be rehabilitated as a historical ruler who used every means to fight for Wallachia’s independence and to defend Christendom against the Ottomans. At the same time, the film was intended to supersede the reshaping of the character in the Dracula myth attributed to Bram Stoker. Vlad Țepeș’ cruelties were interpreted as justified and necessary defensive measures, so they could be applied to discipline the population and be a warning to possible dissidents. Another comparison was drawn between Romania as a besieged fortress, “a Christian island in the Ottoman sea” (a topos of the antemurale christianitatis) and Romania’s situation under Ceaușescu as a “Roman-Western island in the Slavic-communist sea”. The film was released in Romanian cinemas in 1979, three years after the 500th anniversary of Vlad Țepeș’ death.\n\nIn the 1980s, state control of Romanian television was at its height. The core strategy was to depersonalise television. Broadcasting was reduced to two hours a day, focused exclusively on presenting the dictator couple. Other figures, even of TV journalists, were almost entirely removed from the picture.\n\nWhen fleeing on 22 December 1989, the couple’s own extreme self-aggrandizement finally catches up with them. They are arrested near Târgoviște, the Forest of the Impaled, of all places, and appear before a military tribunal in the local barracks. During his three-day imprisonment there, Ceaușescu is apparently not told whether he is a prisoner or is being guarded by soldiers for his own protection. On Christmas Day, 25 December 1989, Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu are sentenced to death in a brief show trial. The death sentence is carried out immediately. On the same day, Christmas mass is broadcast live on Romanian television for the first time, directly from Bucharest’s Patriarchal Cathedral (Catedrala Patriarhală).\n\nThe images of the execution go around the world on 26 December. They show two elderly people behind a table, wrapped in their coats. They refuse to recognise the court, yet the verdict is announced despite this. Their hands are bound, they are taken out and shot in front of a wall. This is all filmed, apart from the moment of the shooting which the cameraman missed: someone had tripped over the cable. When the cameraman hurried up with batteries, the shooting is apparently repeated for the camera. Dust from the gunshots obscures the images; the camera focuses on the faces of the dead couple.\n\nThe depersonalisation of the television programme had resulted in a vacuum in the representation of personalities that was filled in December 1989 by the direct, live broadcast of the revolutionary events during the broadcaster’s transition from communist institution to Free Romanian Television (Televiziunea Româna Liberă, TVRL). What was shown was an improvised crowd, giving outsiders the impression that these were new faces. However, among them were key figures who had already been part of the former regime but were invisible behind Ceaușescu’s personality cult. They had had careers in the communist party and thus were part of the communist power structures. Was it a spontaneous revolution or a coup d’état? People in Romania talk of a “stolen” or “betrayed” revolution.\n\nIon Iliescu served as president of Romania from 1990 to 1992, 1992 to 1996 and 2000 to 2004. He announced the founding of the National Salvation Front (Frontul Salvării Naționale, FSN) during a TV broadcast on 22 December 1989. He was a communist party functionary who was demoted in 1971 from his position as secretary of the Central Committee to local party secretary in the district of Timiș, due to his criticism of Ceaușescu. Now he claimed leadership of the “revolution”. He and the FSN whipped up fear of “terrorists”, as Vlad Țepeș once aroused fear of the Ottomans. In television broadcasts, the people were called on to go out onto the streets to protect the revolution from the terrorists. Over one thousand people died in street fighting in December 1989, three-quarters of them after December 22, when the dictator and his wife had already been removed from power. They were murdered by supposed terrorists. Even today it is still not clear who the killers were. The dead of 1989 form the collective trauma of post-communist Romania. While the overthrow of other communist dictatorships in 1989 was mostly peaceful, Romania’s revolution ended in a bloodbath.\n\nThe events of 1989 have not been officially processed; the dead of December 1989 have never been atoned for. On 19 December 2019, 30 years after the system change, the EU passed a resolution calling on the Romanian state to process the past events. Among other things, the resolution states: “The European Parliament calls on the Romanian State to strengthen its efforts to clarify the truth in relation to the events of the revolution, an absolute necessity for the country, the Romanian people, Europe and the European Union, in light of the right of the Romanian people to learn the truth, 30 years on from the revolution of December 1989.”\n\nThe Romanian state’s failure to address the unatoned crimes of 1989 in a legal process weighs on the state like a curse. Every year in December, friends and families of the dead ask anew: who did the shooting? Who gave the orders? The unexplained crimes still rumble underground. Perpetrators who have not been called to account remain a threat, like the undead, sucking the blood and thus the life-force of the living, as the vampire myth puts it. On the other hand, the myth also states that the undead cannot be seen in a mirror, nor can they be filmed. There is no proof of their reality. They continue to have an immaterial existence until they are finally laid to rest by the processing of the disaster. So we can ask, in the terms of the myth: Did the cameraman in Târgoviște fail to film the moment of death because an undead regime that cuts off its own head can’t be filmed?\n\nThe topic of vampirism clearly relates to the body and is linked to a twisted eroticism. Lifeblood is not given but taken: one body lives at the expense of another. But the vampire motif has also always been a metaphor for a mental state. The vampire and its victim form a body in which one can only live from the strength of the other, thus developing a violence in which the other offers up its convictions and values without resistance, leading finally to completely hollowing out the existence of both. Vampirism is an allegory for an attempt to survive that is destined to fail. A conflict that remains unsolved for too long leads to resignation, a trauma caused by a profoundly disturbing experience, a wound due to an act of violence. The Ceaușescus presented themselves as Vlad Țepeș’ heirs and thus involuntarily followed the path of Dracula the vampire.\n\nWater is used for cleaning, and also has a ritual significance in the cleansing from guilt or as intiation (baptism). During the 1980s there were persistent rumours of a bathroom of pure gold that was supposedly to be found in the Ceaușescus’ private house in Bucharest. This rumour articulated the people’s powerless rage about the vast discrepancy between the rulers’ wealth, as they washed their hands of responsibility, and the people’s own extreme poverty.\n\nFrom the empty bathroom, that can now be visited, the banality of evil looks back at the viewer. The Ceaușescus’ private home has been opened to the public, as have the place of execution in Târgoviște and the Casa Poporului, the ironically named “House of the People”, for which an entire city neighbourhood was demolished and that was to be officially inaugurated on 26 January 1990, Nicolae Ceaușescu’s birthday. In this ruler’s palace, the “Carpathian Genius” intended to reflect himself as the “creator of an epoch of unprecedented renewal”. All three sites now are, or contain, museums; at the same time they are also “traumatised” places, silent witnesses of an undead past, degraded to curiosities for tourists, in which the echo of the personality cult still sounds today. Transparency is pretended, an openness claimed, whereas these museums in fact articulate the continuing personality cult. The Casa Poporului is one of the most popular tourist attractions, along with the supposed Dracula’s Castle, Bran Castle, over one hundred kilometres further north of Târgoviște, where Dracula never lived, let alone fought against the infidel. Today the Casa Poporului is the seat of parliament. However, everyday political life is overshadowed by the past that has still not been addressed in a legal process and thus points to an uncertain future.\n\n_________\n\n1 Cf.

The non-sense of history by Sonia Voss\n\nPublished in: Anton Roland Laub. Mobile Churches, ed. by Sonia Voss, Heidelberg: Kehrer, 2017.\n\nTranslated from the French by Nickolas Woods\n\n“Leaving Europe and leaving history, the two go together.” In a text that was read before the European Parliament on 21 February 1989, the Romanian-born playwright Eugène Ionesco used these words of caution to denounce the destruction of Romanian villages under Nicolae Ceaușescu’s rule.1 The latter had been in power since 1965. After a few years of relatively liberal politics, the start of the 1970s saw a toughening of the regime. Influenced by a recent visit to China and North Korea, the Romanian dictator decided to remodel his country and its capital city in line with his “new man” vision. The “systematisation” plan that he conceived consisted of territorial and social homogenisation, notably by means of eliminating thousands of villages by the year 2000. The announcement was given effect from 1985 onwards: many villages were razed, these traditionally rural habitats being replaced by dormitory towns. An entire way of life based on secular social organisation and traditions was threatened. The international community was aware of the situation but unable to intervene.\n\nBucharest had already been subjected to the Conducator’s excesses a few years before this occurred. On 4 March 1977, an earthquake measuring 7.2 hit the capital and reduced several districts to rubble. Totally ignoring the proposals of town planners to rebuild the city rationally and respectfully, and despite a local population bled dry by shortages, Ceaușescu exploited this pretext to impose a radical solution: from 1982 to 1989, one-third of the city’s historic centre was wiped out, an area far greater than the disaster zone itself. It is said to be the largest peacetime destruction in Europe. Several thousand buildings were engulfed by the Civic Centre construction project, around the immense Casa Poporului (House of the People) and the Boulevard of the Victory of Socialism. Tens of thousands of Bucharest residents were expropriated.\n\nCeaușescu’s actions not only attacked the Church but also – and this is undoubtedly what interests Laub even more – the image of the city; that is, according to the hypothesis put forward by the American urban planner Kevin Lynch in his eponymous work, the mental or graphic representation a city’s inhabitants develop from its topography and organisation – its nodes and axes – but also from their own points of reference.2 A church is more than an edifice: it is also a structuring element in the city. This is particularly true of Bucharest, which grew from Saint George Old Church, then from the successive emplacements of various venues of Orthodox worship.3 To move a historic construction is to effect a distortion. It not only ruptures the temporal chain of events that produced a district’s form but also attacks the locus, the spatial organisation that links the monument to its environment.4 To comply with Ceaușescu’s new urban plans, two of the churches in Bucharest were subjected to an additional insult: not only were they displaced, they were also slightly rotated away from the west-east axis. Churches have to point towards the rising sun, towards the east; it’s their “orientation”. So these churches were, in compass terms, disorientated. Ultimately, displacing the churches, denying them their spatial relevance and their symbolic significance (not to mention their usage, as masses were now forbidden) may have constituted an attack that was admittedly less definitive but nonetheless as pernicious as their destruction.\n\nThe residents of Bucharest, deprived of a good “environmental image” offering them “emotional security” and “the depth and intensity of human experience”,5 shared in this disorientation. Born in Bucharest, Laub was still a child when the great Civic Centre project was launched. In the evenings, on his way home from school, his mother took him on detours to observe the demolition. The house that belonged to his grandparents on his mother’s side had already disappeared and the bulldozers were now advancing northwards, away from the heart of the city, threatening the home of the other branch of the family. One imagines the dizziness felt on seeing this changing space, these brutal, quick metamorphoses. Some years later, after completing his initial studies at the University of Bucharest, Laub left his country, like thousands of other young Romanians, and settled in Germany. He studied photography at the New School for Photography and the Weissensee School of Art in Berlin. He lost no time in choosing Ceaușescu’s authoritarian regime and its impact on urban space in Bucharest as his main topic. But how can this disorientation, this feeling of instability resulting from absurd space management, be acknowledged when no traces exist? To witness the ravages of war, photographers can aim their lenses at rubble, at façades ripped open. Even absence – gaps or hollowness – can be made visible. But in Bucharest, the new topography erased squares and avenues, and there is no indication of the former sites of the monuments that were destroyed or displaced.\n\nThe first step was to locate the churches. The old addresses no longer existed and some of the churches had changed their names. There is no official archive documenting the displacements that were often decided by the presidential couple in an arbitrary fashion, disregarding the recommendations of the Historic Monuments Commission, which had, incidentally, been dissolved in 1977.6 In most cases, the new addresses led to buildings whose façades offered no clues.\n\nLaub searched and enquired. He went around buildings, walked down passage-ways and explored narrow lanes. And suddenly they appeared: jammed against a back wall, stranded in a courtyard, parked among a sea of cars. He could, therefore, work, but the seven churches had been relegated to such cramped places that it was often impossible to photograph them without the availability of a wide angle view, that is, without subjecting them to fresh distortion, once again skewing their relationship with their vicinities, which is something Laub refused to do. There is an additional obstacle and absurdity in front of the “Schitul Maicilor” Church, the first church to have been displaced: the ministerial buildings and the Romanian Intelligence Service surrounding and overhanging it are protected by numerous signs prohibiting the taking of photographs and in doing so limiting camera angles drastically. Laub’s first step was to give these churches visibility, an image, or rather two, using the process known as digital photo stitching. Cut off from their contexts, the churches can only be photographed by being segmented again then reassembled. This obligatory photomontage enriches a series of dialectic relationships that constitute the complexity of this story: past/present; visible face/hidden face; displaced churches/ immovable edifices; curtain-wall façades/organic backdrops. The resulting square-format photographs with strict framing and precise, nuanced tints open each chapter of this book and re-establish, as far as possible, the visual integrity of the photo subjects. On the other hand, the following shots focus on their disparate nature and break them down into left and right halves, convex and concave buildings, exterior and interior views, etc. Laub is particularly interested in the diptych, the dialectic organisation of forms – conflicts, the coexistence of contradictory realities and the resulting absurdity influence his observation of the world.\n\nThis formal method can be likened to the detached aesthetic of Germany’s objective photography and particularly that of its most influential representatives, the couple Bernd and Hilla Becher. The shots are devoid of human presence, the skies are uniformly grey, the building classification follows the logic of a survey, and the recourse to archives gives the series a scientific dimension. The foray into the churches’ interiors is the only twist in this very regulated approach. This inventory is directly related to Laub’s personal history, however, and it reminds us that the Bechers themselves, in developing their typologies of water towers and gasometers, not only documented a disappearing world, but also, and possibly first and foremost, the rural setting in which Bernd Becher grew up, the industrial landscapes of his childhood.7 Moreover, despite the serial nature of his work, Laub’s oeuvre is no lexicon of forms. The seven displaced churches are different from each other in every way: they date from different eras, boast different dimensions and are of different architectural value. Their only link is the uniqueness of the fate that history thrust upon them. In this, and in a particularly original way, Laub continues a lineage of photographs of places of worship that make it possible to establish a genuine history of the genre: from the forerunners commissioned by the French state for heritage purposes to the perfect images of cathedrals resulting from Markus Brunetti’s technical achievements via Wilmar Koenig and his Gotteshäuser, or via Petra Wunderlich’s New York synagogues and churches. Most have chased similarities, sought to discern a system of forms. Often the perspective is abandoned in favour of a frontal approach and a design or recurrent traits. In Laub’s photographs, however, the key factor lies not in the church but in its incoherent and chaotic cohabitation with its environment. For him, it is not a matter of establishing continuity but instead one of exposing the consequences of a political strategy, of appreciating a new artificial locus born of a despot’s insanity. Laub also distinguishes himself by his indifference to the sacred character of the churches he photographs: he exhibits no devotion, no spiritual concern. His biting eye enjoys disclosing prosaic details, like this patriarch whose portrait is enthroned on a chair protected by a fire extinguisher, as red as it is incongruous; or, in the garden of Saint Stephen “Stork’s Nest” Church, the family of plastic storks, intended to add a bucolic touch. Stepping back from irony, Laub also recalls the Church’s involvement in the darkest chapters of Romanian history. One photograph, taken at the entrance of the venerable “Mihai Vodă” Church, isolates a fresco featuring the patriarch Nicodim standing next to Marshal Antonescu who, during his time in office from 1940 to 1944, was responsible for the death of around 300,000 Jews.8\n\nLaub’s series closes with the Great Synagogue in Bucharest. It was neither destroyed nor displaced but its treatment was no less brutal: as Ceaușescu’s rule was coming to an end, it was enclosed by a U-shape of apartment blocks that round it up and erase it from the urban landscape. An indescribable sadness takes hold on seeing these final images, the synagogue sometimes looking melancholic under a blanket of snow, sometimes imprisoned behind a wire fence. The history of Romanian Jews and particularly the genocide mentioned above can be discovered inside the synagogue: a few photocopies have been tacked to panels to denounce a state-perpetrated crime that has no museum dedicated to it. Marshal Antonescu makes another appearance, accompanied by a description of his convoys of death.\n\nWith Mobile Churches, Laub uncovers a surprising chapter in recent European history, but his work can also be understood as adopting a critical stance against the current situation in Romania. Beyond its astonishing character, the phenomenon of the displacement and concealment of churches can be seen as a metaphor for the logic of amnesia that governs the country. Today, as recently highlighted by ICOMOS, the absence of consideration for old buildings in addition to inappropriate urban policy is once again threatening Bucharest’s architectural wealth.9 To this must be added the inadequacy of the administration and the non-completion of the process of property restitution, initiated after 1989, which is slowing down individual attempts to rehabilitate heritage to a considerable extent. In an unfortunate irony of history, buildings from the Communist era are now being masked by giant billboards reaching mercilessly across entire city-centre façades. At the start of 2017, Romanians came together en masse to protest against the corruption of their leaders and the decline of democracy. Almost 30 years after they were read, Ionesco’s words still resonate with all their strength.\n\n_______\n\n1 Eugène Ionesco, discourse read by Marie-France Ionesco before the European Parliament on 21 February 1989, cf.

Mobile Churches, ed. by Sonia Voss, Heidelberg: Kehrer, 2017.\n\nTranslated from the German by Nickolas Woods\n\nIf you take the bus down one of Bucharest’s grand socialist avenues today, you may see a few passengers, young and old, suddenly crossing themselves several times in an orthodox way. You look out the window for a reason but only see the eight-to-ten-storey facades of socialist apartment blocks. The answer to the riddle only emerges by going into the backyards on foot and discovering orthodox churches crammed into the angles between the buildings. The people on the bus know the churches are there even if they’re hidden behind the uniform socialist facades of the apartment blocks, which tower over the churches by several storeys, stealing their light and air. How did blocks of flats come to be built so closely around the churches?\n\n“I had reached the age of six hundred and fifty miles.” This sentence, spoken by the protagonist Helward Mann, opens Christopher Priest’s 1974 science fiction novel Inverted World. In tells of a city is surrounded by high walls, its residents unaware that the entire city is mounted on rails and being pulled by a massive winch. The city moves northwards one tenth of a mile per day, advancing eternally towards a mysterious optimum. When people’s ages are given in spatial rather than temporal measurements, the concept of linear progression, namely from a start to a finish, is lost. Although the rails simulate this kind of progression, the fact the rail track covered is being taken from behind the city and replaced in front of it creates an idea of meaningless drifting in endless space, even though the authoritarian system in place is promising residents an illusory destination. The odyssey has its origins in a vague apocalyptic event that took place 200 years earlier, a “crash” that could be seen as the seizure of power by a few people who regard the population as a mass to manipulate in order to maintain power, regardless of the demise in the population’s condition.\n\nPriest’s fictional description became reality under the dictatorship in Bucharest in the 1980s. Nicolae Ceaușescu wanted to turn Bucharest into a Socialist city with a new capital and government district, the Centru Civic. The Communist regime subjected the population to a radical cut in consumption to repay foreign debt. Even though queuing up in front of empty shops or rationed electricity supplies became part of everyday life, even in winter, Ceaușescu accepted the extreme burden on the economy and the decline in living standards as part of the realisation of his pompous city plans. The government district was planned around Arsenal Hill in southwest Bucharest with the government palace, the Casa Republicii – known locally, and ironically, as the Casa Poporului (House of the People), on the crest of the hill. The official opening of the palace was due to take place on Ceaușescu’s birthday on 26 January 1990, but political transition came first. Nonetheless, the Casa Poporului’s surface area makes it the second-biggest building in the world after the Pentagon, and even today it is centre of the new political system.1 The intention was to link Ceaușescu’s government palace with a new business centre in the east via a 3.5-kilometre grand boulevard, the Bulevardul Victoria Socialismului (Boulevard of Socialist Victory). Ceaușescu exploited the damage caused by the earthquake of 4 March 1977 for his own ends, but the 1935 Master Plan during the rule of King Carol II (1930–40) also suited his plans. Bucharest was not allowed to fortify itself under the Ottoman Suzerainty; it therefore resembled a garden city. However, the 1935 Master Plan already envisaged condensing the inner city and designing it with straight axes of view and representative monuments. Forty thousand people were resettled to realise the Centru Civic project. Relics that were seen by the Socialists as forming part of an outmoded city model were to be removed. Ceaușescu had entire old-town districts bulldozed, namely the Izvor and Dudești-Văcrăști districts with buildings from the 18th and 19th centuries including monasteries and other religious buildings, a total surface area of 400 hectares in the southern section of Bucharest’s inner city. In the Centru Civic, ten orthodox churches and six synagogues were demolished.2 Some were kept but banished to backyards, possibly to avoid provoking the religious population.\n\nAlthough atheism certainly influenced state ideology in Romania’s Socialist era, the Romanian Orthodox Church escaped prohibition because the majority of the population belonged to it, so it was instead used to serve political objectives. Metropolitans and bishops critical of the regime were replaced by loyalists. Members of the government were involved in the appointment of new dignitaries and the church was subjected to strict control mechanisms. The Romanian Orthodox Church did have to endure government repression, but other confessions, for example the Greek Catholic or Jewish communities, were harder hit.3 The connection between state and the Romanian Orthodox Church originates in the Byzantine era. Canon law in the Byzantine Empire took the principles of consonantia and symphonia as ideals in the collaboration between Emperor and religious dignitaries. Later, in its national organisation and rootedness, the Orthodox Church offered an opportunity to differentiate from Ottoman foreign domination.4 In the Romanian Orthodox Church under Ceaușescu’s dictatorship, there was a more passive internal-theological protest against the rampant atheistic propaganda. Instead of active resistance, which would have jeopardised the level of state protection it enjoyed, the Church opposed the new ideology via means of deep spirituality.5 This retreat into spirituality still lives on today – in the signs of the cross made by people on buses – and ultimately shows how unsuccessful socialist re-education was, or how far it produced the opposite effect.\n\nIn the 1980s, seven churches in Bucharest were moved on rails then hidden behind socialist blocks. The oldest of the seven churches is the biserica “Mihai Vodă”, which was built in 1591. Other sacred buildings, if not completely destroyed, were concealed behind pre-fabricated high-rise buildings, as is the case with the Great Synagogue (Sinagoga Mare “Poloneză”).6 The method for displacing buildings was developed by the engineer Eugeniu Ion Iordăchescu. In the course of his career, he moved 29 buildings including 13 churches or monasteries alongside secular constructions.7 Had he read Priest’s science fiction novel? Approximately one-half of the novel is dedicated to a detailed description of the moving of an entire city on rails.\n\nThe biserica “Schitul Maicilor” was the first of the seven churches to be moved, shifted 245 metres in 1982. The church once stood on Schitul Maicilor Street, on what is now the southeast corner of the Casa Poporului. It was moved to Mitropolit Antim Ivireanu Street and is concealed by blocks of flats on the new grand boulevard, the Bulevardul Victoria Socialismului. In its original location, the church was surrounded by a monastery, built in 1726, but all of the monastery buildings were torn down. Only the church itself – its nave size of 17.75 x 6.8 metres making it relatively small – survived. The translocation procedure can be described as follows: the church was cut horizontally, initially using drill holes in the church walls below ground level. Liquid concrete was then pumped into an underground steel construction that produced a weight-bearing plate instead of the church floor, which was removed. The church could then be lifted onto rails, as if onto a tray. It was then pulled to its destination using winches. The church interiors were stabilised using a wooden construction, as Iordăchescu describes,8 as any cracking of the wood during transportation would give an indication of instability. The orientation of the church was also respected – which is why it had to be turned, on curved rails – and enough space needed to be left to be able to walk around the church during Easter parades. The relocation took five months to prepare and it took 72 hours to shift the church onto rails. Schitul Maicilor Church then operated for another month before being closed by the Communist regime. It wasn’t until 1995 that the church was restored and re-consecrated.9 The displacement of Schitul Maicilor Church meant that it lost its characteristic surroundings – the monastery complex with a garden. On its mount, it towered above other buildings. Today it sinks, almost drowning, behind profane buildings. Extracting Schitul Maicilor Church from the monastery contradicts Article 7 of the Venice Charter, which was adopted in 1964 as a result of World War II and post-war reconstruction, and which updated the Athens Charter. It states:\n\n“A monument is inseparable from the history to which it bears witness and from the setting in which it occurs. The moving of all or part of a monument cannot be allowed except where the safeguarding of that monument demands it or where it is justified by national or international interest of paramount importance.”10\n\nThe churches in Bucharest were not moved to safeguard them but to banish them from view and render them insignificant. Their displacement calls into question the natural spatial relationship to a certain locality. If a specific view is removed, the mental horizon widens, and the concealed construction increases in importance and has a stronger impact, such as the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem, which is actually the former Western Wall of the plateau of the Second Temple that once stood here. The memory of a previously existing holy building lives on in people’s minds. Moving the churches thus achieved the opposite effect: rather than devaluing them in society’s consciousness, it kept them alive, like a memory trace, and thereby gave the churches (the newest one was built in 1877) added importance. The seven displaced churches are in some way begging to be released from the disturbing visual imbalance of their surroundings. In any event, this arrangement compromises the underlying social model even if it documents a high level of technical skill. Under Ceaușescu, it was the churches that were forcibly displaced; today it is the country’s Communist past that is being driven out. The students who revolted against Ceaușescu’s dictatorship in 1989 feel cheated by their victory. No justice was awarded to the victims of the yearlong state terror and brutal suppression of the student protests by miners in 1990; there has still been no atonement for the crimes. Today, the Catedrala Neamului (Cathedral of Ancestors/the Nation) is being developed behind the Casa Poporului. The new construction was already envisaged in the 1935 Master Plan and will tower above the Casa Poporului. It will be the church of the Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church and – at 120 metres long, 70 metres wide and 120 metres tall – it will be one of the biggest orthodox cathedrals in the world. Rather than attempting to reappraise its past, its close symbiosis with the state, the Church is making a fresh claim on a position of power.\n\nThe city in Christopher Priest’s science fiction novel moves towards an optimum, just as the Communist regime moved towards an optimum, namely Communism, on rails. It begs the question whether Bucharest isn’t still moving along the same rails today. Even after the fall of the Iron Curtain, the Casa Poporului is at the centre of the new political system. According to Renata Salecl, memories of the Socialist regime are blocked by the trauma suffered while a semantic rewriting of the Centru Civic is facilitated by collective suppression, which suggests continuity but is only masking the trauma.11 The Romanian Orthodox Church is also moving along on the same rails if a cathedral as colossal and immovable as the Casa Poporului is being built.\n\n______\n\n1 Cf.
