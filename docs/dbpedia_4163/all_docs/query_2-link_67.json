        "text": "\"Check against delivery\"\n\nThe original version of the speech is available here.\n\nANSWERING THE CALL OF HISTORY\n\nINTRODUCTION – DELIVER TODAY, PREPARE FOR TOMORROW\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nIn just under 300 days, Europeans will take to the polls in our unique and remarkable democracy.\n\nAs with any election, it will be a time for people to reflect on the State of our Union and the work done by those that represent them.\n\nBut it will also be a time to decide on what kind of future and what kind of Europe they want.\n\nAmong them will be millions of first-time voters, the youngest of whom were born in 2008.\n\nAs they stand in that polling booth, they will think about what matters to them.\n\nThey will think about the war that rages at our borders.\n\nOr the impact of destructive climate change.\n\nAbout how artificial intelligence will influence their lives.\n\nOr of their chances of getting a house or a job in the years ahead.\n\nOur Union today reflects the vision of those who dreamt of a better future after World War II.\n\nA future in which a Union of nations, democracies and people would work together to share peace and prosperity.\n\nThey believed that Europe was the answer to the call of history.\n\nWhen I speak to the new generation of young people, I see that same vision for a better future.\n\nThat same burning desire to build something better.\n\nThat same belief that in a world of uncertainty, Europe once again must answer the call of history.\n\nAnd that is what we must do together.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nThis starts with earning the trust of Europeans to deal with their aspirations and anxieties.\n\nAnd in the next 300 days we must finish the job that they entrusted us with.\n\nI want to thank this House for its leading role in delivering on one of the most ambitious transformations this Union has ever embarked on.\n\nWhen I stood in front of you in 2019 with my programme for a green, digital and geopolitical Europe I know that some had doubts.\n\nAnd that was before the world turned upside down with a global pandemic and a brutal war on European soil.\n\nBut look at where Europe is today.\n\nWe have seen the birth of a geopolitical Union – supporting Ukraine, standing up to Russia's aggression, responding to an assertive China and investing in partnerships.\n\nWe now have a European Green Deal as the centrepiece of our economy and unmatched in ambition.\n\nWe have set the path for the digital transition and become global pioneers in online rights.\n\nWe have the historic NextGenerationEU – combining 800 billion euros of investment and reform – and creating decent jobs for today and tomorrow.\n\nWe have set the building blocks for a Health Union, helping to vaccinate an entire continent – and large parts of the world.\n\nWe have started making ourselves more independent in critical sectors, like energy, chips or raw materials.\n\nI would also like to thank you for the ground-breaking and pioneering work we did on gender equality.\n\nAs a woman, this means a lot to me.\n\nWe have concluded files that many thought would be blocked forever, like the Women on Boards Directive and the historic accession of the EU to the Istanbul Convention.\n\nWith the Directive on pay transparency we have cast into law the basic principle that equal work deserves equal pay.\n\nThere is not a single argument why – for the same type of work – a woman should be paid less than a man.\n\nBut our work is far from over and we must continue pushing for progress together.\n\nI know this house supports our proposal on combating violence against women.\n\nHere too, I would like that we cast into law another basic principle: No, means no.\n\nThere can be no true equality without freedom from violence.\n\nAnd thanks to this Parliament, to Member States and to my team of Commissioners, we have delivered over 90% of the Political Guidelines I presented in 2019.\n\nTogether, we have shown that when Europe is bold, it gets things done.\n\nAnd our work is far from over - so let's stand together.\n\nLet's deliver today and prepare for tomorrow.\n\nEUROPEAN GREEN DEAL\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nFour years ago, the European Green Deal was our answer to the call of history.\n\nAnd this summer – the hottest ever on record in Europe – was a stark reminder of that.\n\nGreece and Spain were struck by ravaging wildfires – and were hit again only a few weeks later by devastating floods.\n\nAnd we saw the chaos and carnage of extreme weather – from Slovenia to Bulgaria and right across our Union.\n\nThis is the reality of a boiling planet.\n\nThe European Green Deal was born out of this necessity to protect our planet.\n\nBut it was also designed as an opportunity to preserve our future prosperity.\n\nWe started this mandate by setting a long-term perspective with the climate law and the 2050 target.\n\nWe shifted the climate agenda to being an economic one.\n\nThis has given a clear sense of direction for investment and innovation.\n\nAnd we have already seen this growth strategy deliveringin the short-term.\n\nEurope's industry is showing every day that it is ready to power this transition.\n\nProving that modernisation and decarbonisation can go hand in hand.\n\nIn the last five years, the number of clean steel factories in the EU has grown from zero to 38.\n\nWe are now attracting more investment in clean hydrogenthan the US and China combined.\n\nAnd tomorrow I will be in Denmark with Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to see that innovation first hand.\n\nWe will mark the launch of the first container ship, powered by clean methanol made with solar energy.\n\nThis is the strength of Europe's response to climate change.\n\nThe European Green Deal provides the necessary frame, incentives, and investment – but it is the people, the inventors, the engineers who develop the solutions.\n\nAnd this is why, Honourable Members,\n\nas we enter the next phase of the European Green Deal, one thing will never change.\n\nWe will keep supporting European industry throughout this transition.\n\nWe started with a package of measures – from the Net-Zero Industry Act to the Critical Raw Materials Act.\n\nWith our Industry Strategy, we are looking at the risks and needs of each ecosystem in this transition.\n\nWe need to finish this work.\n\nAnd with this, we need to develop an approach for each industrial ecosystem.\n\nTherefore, starting from this month, we will hold a series of Clean Transition Dialogues with industry.\n\nThe core aim will be to support every sector in building its business model for the decarbonisation of industry.\n\nBecause we believe that this transition is essential for our future competitiveness in Europe.\n\nBut this is just as much about the people and their jobs of today.\n\nOur wind industry, for instance, is a European success story.\n\nBut it is currently facing a unique mix of challenges.\n\nThis is why we will put forward a European Wind Power package – working closely with industry and Member States.\n\nWe will fast-track permitting even more.\n\nWe will improve the auction systems across the EU.\n\nWe will focus on skills, access to finance and stable supply chains.\n\nBut this is broader than one sector:\n\nFrom wind to steel, from batteries to electric vehicles, our ambition is crystal clear: The future of our clean tech industry has to be made in Europe.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nThis shows that when it comes to the European Green Deal:\n\nWe stay the course.\n\nWe stay ambitious.\n\nWe stick to our growth strategy.\n\nAnd we will always strive for a fair and just transition!\n\nThat means a fair outcome for future generations – to live on healthy planet.\n\nAnd a fair journey for all those impacted – with decent jobs and a solemn promise to leave no one behind.\n\nJust think about manufacturing jobs and competitiveness: a topic we are discussing a lot these days.\n\nOur industry and tech companies like competition.\n\nThey know that global competition is good for business.\n\nAnd that it creates and protects good jobs here in Europe.\n\nBut competition is only true as long as it is fair.\n\nToo often, our companies are excluded from foreign markets or are victims of predatory practices.\n\nThey are often undercut by competitors benefitting from huge state subsidies.\n\nWe have not forgotten how China's unfair trade practicesaffected our solar industry.\n\nMany young businesses were pushed out by heavily subsidised Chinese competitors.\n\nPioneering companies had to file for bankruptcy.\n\nPromising talents went searching for fortune abroad.\n\nThis is why fairness in the global economy is so important – because it affects lives and livelihoods.\n\nEntire industries and communities depend on it.\n\nSo, we have be to be clear-eyed about the risks we face.\n\nTake the electric vehicles sector.\n\nIt is a crucial industry for the clean economy, with a huge potential for Europe.\n\nBut global markets are now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric cars.\n\nAnd their price is kept artificially low by huge state subsidies.\n\nThis is distorting our market.\n\nAnd as we do not accept this from the inside, we do not accept this from the outside.\n\nSo I can announce today that the Commission is launching an anti-subsidy investigation into electric vehicles coming from China.\n\nEurope is open for competition. Not for a race to the bottom.\n\nWe must defend ourselves against unfair practices.\n\nBut equally, it is vital to keep open lines of communication and dialogue with China.\n\nBecause there also are topics, where we can and have to cooperate.\n\nDe-risk, not decouple – this will be my approach with the Chinese leadership at the EU-China Summit later this year.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nIn the European Union, we are proud of our cultural diversity.\n\nWe are a ‘Europe of the Regions' with a unique blend of languages, music, art, traditions, crafts and cuisines.\n\nWe are also a continent of unique biological diversity.\n\nSome 6 500 species are found only in Europe.\n\nIn northern Europe, we find the Wadden Sea, a world natural heritage site and unique habitat offering a home to rare species of flora and fauna and a vital resource for millions of migratory birds. And with the Baltic Sea we have the largest area of brackish sea in the world.\n\nSouth of that is the European Plain, characterised by vast tracts of moorland and wetland.\n\nThese regions are important allies against ongoing climate change.\n\nProtected moors and wetlands absorb enormous volumes of greenhouse gases, secure regional water cycles and are home to unique biodiversity.\n\nAnd Europe is a continent of forests.\n\nFrom the mighty coniferous forests of the North and East, via the last remnants of virgin oak and beech forest in central Europe to the cork oak forests of southern Europe: all these forests are an irreplaceable source of goods and services.\n\nThey absorb carbon dioxide, supply wood and other products, generate fertile soils, and filter the air and the water.\n\nBiodiversity and ecosystem services are vital for all of us in Europe.\n\nLoss of nature destroys not only the foundations of our life, but also our feeling of what constitutes home.\n\nWe must protect it.\n\nAt the same time, food security, in harmony with nature, remains an essential task.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to our farmers, to thank them for providing us with food day after day.\n\nFor us in Europe, this task of agriculture – producing healthy food – is the foundation of our agricultural policy.\n\nAnd self-sufficiency in food is also important for us.\n\nThat is what our farmers provide.\n\nIt is not always an easy task, as the consequences of Russia's aggression against Ukraine, climate change bringing droughts, forest fires and flooding, and new obligations are all having a growing impact on farmers' work and incomes.\n\nWe must bear that in mind.\n\nMany are already working towards a more sustainable form of agriculture.\n\nWe must work together with the men and women in farming to tackle these new challenges.\n\nThat is the only way to secure the supply of food for the future.\n\nWe need more dialogue and less polarisation.\n\nThat is why we want to launch a strategic dialogue on the future of agriculture in the EU.\n\nI am and remain convinced that agriculture and protection of the natural world can go hand in hand.\n\nWe need both.\n\nECONOMY, SOCIAL AND COMPETITIVENESS\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nA fair transition for farmers, families and industry.\n\nThis is the hallmark of this Mandate.\n\nAnd it is all the more important as we face strong economic headwinds.\n\nI see three major economic challenges for our industry in the year ahead: labour and skills shortages, inflation, and making business easier for our companies.\n\nThe first has to do with our labour market.\n\nWe have not forgotten the early days of the global pandemic.\n\nWhen everyone predicted a new wave of 1930-style mass unemployment.\n\nBut we defied this prediction.\n\nWith SURE – the first-ever European short-time work initiative – we saved 40 million jobs.\n\nThis is Europe's social market economy in action.\n\nAnd we can be proud of it!\n\nWe then immediately restarted our economic engine thanks to NextGenerationEU.\n\nAnd today we see the results.\n\nEurope is close to full employment.\n\nInstead of millions of people looking for jobs, millions of jobs are looking for people.\n\nLabour and skills shortages are reaching record levels – both here and across all major economies.\n\n74% of SMEs are saying they are facing skill shortages.\n\nIn the peak of the tourist season, restaurants and bars in Europe are running reduced hours because they cannot find staff.\n\nHospitals are postponing treatment because of lack of nurses.\n\nAnd two thirds of European companies are looking for IT specialists.\n\nAt the same time millions of parents – mostly mothers – are struggling to reconcile work and family, because there is no childcare.\n\nAnd 8 million young people are neither in employment, education or training.\n\nTheir dreams put on hold, their lives on stand-by.\n\nThis is not only the cause of so much personal distress.\n\nIt is also one of the most significant bottlenecks for our competitiveness.\n\nBecause labour shortages hamper the capacity for innovation, growth and prosperity.\n\nSo we need to improve access to the labour market.\n\nMost importantly for young people, for women.\n\nAnd we need qualified migration.\n\nIn addition, we need to respond to the deep-rooted shifts in technology, society and demography.\n\nAnd for that, we should rely on the expertise of businesses and trade unions, our collective bargaining partners.\n\nIt is almost forty years since Jacques Delors convened the Val Duchesse meeting that saw the birth of European social dialogue.\n\nSince then, social partners have shaped the Union of today – ensuring progress and prosperity for millions.\n\nAnd as the world around us changes faster than ever, social partners must again be at the heart of our future.\n\nTogether we must focus on the challenges facing the labour market – from skills and labour shortages, to new challenges stemming from AI.\n\nThis is why together with the Belgian Presidency next year, we will convene a new Social Partner Summit once again at Val Duchesse.\n\nThe future of Europe will be built with and by our social partners.\n\nThe second major economic challenge: persistent high inflation.\n\nChristine Lagarde and the European Central Bank are working hard to keep inflation under control.\n\nWe know that returning to the ECB's medium-term target will take some time.\n\nThe good news is that Europe has started bringing energy prices down.\n\nWe have not forgotten, Putin's deliberate use of gas as a weapon and how it triggered fears of blackout and an energy crisis like in the 70s.\n\nMany thought, we would not have enough energy to get through the winter.\n\nBut we made it.\n\nBecause we stayed united – pooling our demand and buying energy together.\n\nAnd at the same time, different to the 70s, we used the crisis to massively invest in renewables and fast-track the clean transition.\n\nWe used Europe's critical mass to bring prices down and secure our supply.\n\nThe price for gas in Europe was over 300 euros per MWh one year ago. It is now around 35.\n\nSo we need to look at how we can replicate this model of success in other fields like critical raw materials or clean hydrogen.\n\nThe third challenge for European companies is about making it easier to do business.\n\nSmall companies do not have the capacity to cope with complex administration.\n\nOr they are held back by lengthy processes.\n\nThis often means they do less with the time they have – and that they miss out on opportunities to grow.\n\nThis is why – before the end of the year – we will appoint an EU SME envoy reporting directly to me.\n\nWe want to hear directly from small and medium sized businesses, about their everyday challenges.\n\nFor every new piece of legislation we conduct a competitiveness check by an independent board.\n\nAnd next month, we will make the first legislative proposalstowards reducing reporting obligations at the European level by 25%.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nLet's be frank – this will not be easy.\n\nAnd we will need your support.\n\nBecause this is a common endeavour for all European institutions.\n\nSo we also have to work with Member States, to match the 25% at national level.\n\nIt is time to make business easier in Europe!\n\nBut European companies also need access to key technologies to innovate, develop and manufacture.\n\nThis is a question of European sovereignty as the Leaders underlined in Versailles.\n\nIt is an economic and national security imperative to preserve a European edge on critical and emerging technologies.\n\nThis European industrial policy also requires common European funding.\n\nThis is why – as part of our proposal for a review of our budget – we proposed the STEP platform.\n\nWith STEP we can boost, leverage and steer EU funds to invest in everything from microelectronics to quantum computing and AI.\n\nFrom biotech to clean tech.\n\nOur companies need this support now – so I urge for a quick agreement on our budget proposal.\n\nAnd I know I can count on this House.\n\nAnd there is more when it comes to competitiveness.\n\nWe have seen real bottlenecks along global supply chains, including because of the deliberate policies of other countries.\n\nJust think about China's export restrictions on gallium and germanium – which are essential for goods like semiconductors and solar panels.\n\nThis shows why it is so important for Europe to step up on economic security.\n\nBy de-risking and not decoupling.\n\nAnd I am very proud that this concept has found broad support from key partners.\n\nFrom Australia to Japan and the United States.\n\nAnd many other countries around the world want to work together.\n\nMany are overly dependent on a single supplier for critical minerals.\n\nOthers – from Latin America to Africa – want to develop local industries for processing and refining, instead of just shipping their resources abroad.\n\nThis is why later this year we will convene the first meeting of our new Critical Raw Materials Club.\n\nAt the same time, we will continue to drive open and fair trade.\n\nSo far, we have concluded new free trade agreements with Chile, New Zealand and Kenya.\n\nWe should aim to complete deals with Australia, Mexico and Mercosur by the end of this year.\n\nAnd soon thereafter with India and Indonesia.\n\nSmart trade delivers good jobs and prosperity.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nThese three challenges – labour, inflation and business environment – come at a time when we are also asking industry to lead on the clean transition.\n\nSo we need to look further ahead and set out how we remain competitive as we do that.\n\nThis is why I have asked Mario Draghi – one of Europe's great economic minds – to prepare a report on the future of European competitiveness.\n\nBecause Europe will do “whatever it takes” to keep its competitive edge.\n\nDIGITAL & AI\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nWhen it comes to making business and life easier, we have seen how important digital technology is.\n\nIt is telling that we have far overshot the 20% investment target in digital projects of NextGenerationEU.\n\nMember States have used that investment to digitise their healthcare, justice system or transport network.\n\nAt the same time, Europe has led on managing the risks of the digital world.\n\nThe internet was born as an instrument for sharing knowledge, opening minds and connecting people.\n\nBut it has also given rise to serious challenges.\n\nDisinformation, spread of harmful content, risks to the privacy of our data.\n\nAll of this led to a lack of trust and a breach of fundamental rights of people.\n\nIn response, Europe has become the global pioneer of citizen's rights in the digital world.\n\nThe DSA and DMA are creating a safer digital space where fundamental rights are protected.\n\nAnd they are ensuring fairness with clear responsibilities for big tech.\n\nThis is a historic achievement – and we should be proud of it.\n\nThe same should be true for artificial intelligence.\n\nIt will improve healthcare, boost productivity, address climate change.\n\nBut we also should not underestimate the very real threats.\n\nHundreds of leading AI developers, academics and experts warned us recently with the following words:\n\n“Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.”\n\nAI is a general technology that is accessible, powerful and adaptable for a vast range of uses - both civilian andmilitary.\n\nAnd it is moving faster than even its developers anticipated.\n\nSo we have a narrowing window of opportunity to guide this technology responsibly.\n\nI believe Europe, together with partners, should lead the way on a new global framework for AI, built on three pillars: guardrails, governance and guiding innovation.\n\nFirstly, guardrails.\n\nOur number one priority is to ensure AI develops in a human-centric, transparent and responsible way.\n\nThis is why in my Political Guidelines, I committed to setting out a legislative approach in the first 100 days.\n\nWe put forward the AI Act – the world's first comprehensive pro-innovation AI law.\n\nAnd I want to thank this House and the Council for the tireless work on this groundbreaking law.\n\nOur AI Act is already a blueprint for the whole world.\n\nWe must now focus on adopting the rules as soon as possible and turn to implementation.\n\nThe second pillar is governance.\n\nWe are now laying the foundations for a single governance system in Europe.\n\nBut we should also join forces with our partners to ensure a global approach to understanding the impact of AI in our societies.\n\nThink about the invaluable contribution of the IPCC for climate, a global panel that provides the latest science to policymakers.\n\nI believe we need a similar body for AI – on the risks and its benefits for humanity.\n\nWith scientists, tech companies and independent experts all around the table.\n\nThis will allow us to develop a fast and globally coordinated response – building on the work done by the Hiroshima Process and others.\n\nThe third pillar is guiding innovation in a responsible way.\n\nThanks to our investment in the last years, Europe has now become a leader in supercomputing – with 3 of the 5 most powerful supercomputers in the world.\n\nWe need to capitalise on this.\n\nThis is why I can announce today a new initiative to open up our high-performance computers to AI start-ups to train their models.\n\nBut this will only be part of our work to guide innovation.\n\nWe need an open dialogue with those that develop and deploy AI.\n\nIt happens in the United States, where seven major tech companies have already agreed to voluntary rules around safety, security and trust.\n\nIt happens here, where we will work with AI companies, so that they voluntarily commit to the principles of the AI Actbefore it comes into force.\n\nNow we should bring all of this work together towards minimum global standards for safe and ethical use of AI.\n\nGLOBAL, MIGRATION AND SECURITY\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nWhen I stood here four years ago, I said that if we are united on the inside, nobody will divide us from the outside.\n\nAnd this was the thinking behind the Geopolitical Commission.\n\nOur Team Europe approach has enabled us to be more strategic, more assertive and more united.\n\nAnd that is more important than ever.\n\nOur heart bleeds when we see the devastating loss of life in Libya and Morocco after the violent floods and earthquake.\n\nEurope will always stand ready to support in any way we can.\n\nOr think about the Sahel region, one of the poorest yet fastest growing demographically.\n\nThe succession of military coups will make the region more unstable for years ahead.\n\nRussia is both influencing and benefiting from the chaos.\n\nAnd the region has become fertile ground for the rise in terrorism.\n\nThis is of direct concern for Europe – for our security and prosperity.\n\nSo we need to show the same unity of purpose towards Africa as we have shown for Ukraine.\n\nWe need to focus on cooperation with legitimate governments and regional organisations.\n\nAnd we need to develop a mutually beneficial partnership which focuses on common issues for Europe and Africa.\n\nThis is why, together with High Representative Borrell, we will work on a new strategic approach to take forward at the next EU-AU Summit.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nHistory is on the move.\n\nRussia is waging a full-scale war against the founding principles of the UN Charter.\n\nThis has raised immense concerns in countries from Central Asia to the Indo-Pacific.\n\nThey are worried that in a lawless world, they might face the same fate as Ukraine.\n\nWe see a clear attempt by some to return to bloc thinking – trying to isolate and influence countries in between.\n\nAnd it comes at a time when there is a deeper unease by many emerging economies about the way institutions and globalisation work for them.\n\nThose concerns are legitimate.\n\nThese emerging economies – with their people and natural assets – are essential allies in building a cleaner, safer and more prosperous world.\n\nEurope will always work with them to reform and improve the international system.\n\nWe want to lead efforts to make the rules-based order fairer and make distribution more equal.\n\nThis will also mean working with new and old partners to deepen our connections.\n\nAnd Europe's offer with Global Gateway is truly unique.\n\nGlobal Gateway is more transparent, more sustainable, and more economically attractive.\n\nJust last week I was in New Delhi to sign the most ambitious project of our generation.\n\nThe India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor.\n\nIt will be the most direct connection to date between India, the Arabian Gulf and Europe: With a rail link, that will make trade between India and Europe 40% faster.\n\nWith an electricity cable and a clean hydrogen pipeline – to foster clean energy trade between Asia, the Middle East and Europe.\n\nWith a high-speed data cable, to link some of the most innovative digital ecosystems in the world, and create business opportunities all along the way.\n\nThese are state-of-the-art connections for the world of tomorrow.\n\nFaster, shorter, cleaner.\n\nAnd Global Gateway is making the real difference.\n\nI have seen it in Latin America, South-East Asia and across Africa – from building a local hydrogen economy with Namibia and Kenya to a digital economy with the Philippines.\n\nThese are investments in our partners' economy.\n\nAnd they are investments in Europe's prosperity and security in a fast-changing world.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nEvery day, we see that conflict, climate change and instability are pushing people to seek refuge elsewhere.\n\nI have always had a steadfast conviction that migration needs to be managed.\n\nIt needs endurance and patient work with key partners.\n\nAnd it needs unity within our Union.\n\nThis is the spirit of the New Pact on Migration and Asylum.\n\nWhen we took office, there seemed to be no possible compromise in sight.\n\nBut with the Pact, we are striking a new balance.\n\nBetween protecting borders and protecting people.\n\nBetween sovereignty and solidarity.\n\nBetween security and humanity.\n\nWe listened to all Member States and focused on all routes.\n\nAnd we have translated the spirit of the Pact into practical solutions.\n\nWe were fast and united in responding to the hybrid attack that Belarus launched against us.\n\nWe worked closely with our Western Balkan partners and reduced irregular flows.\n\nWe have signed a partnership with Tunisia that brings mutual benefits beyond migration – from energy and education, to skills and security.\n\nAnd we now want to work on similar agreements with other countries.\n\nWe stepped up border protection.\n\nEuropean Agencies deepened their cooperation with Member States.\n\nAllow me to thank in particular Bulgaria and Romania for leading the way – showcasing best practices on both asylum and returns.\n\nThey have proved it: Bulgaria and Romania are part of our Schengen area.\n\nSo let us finally bring them in – without any further delay.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nOur work on migration is based on the conviction that unity is within our reach.\n\nAn agreement on the pact has never been so close.\n\nParliament and the Council have a historic opportunity to get it over the line.\n\nLet us show that Europe can manage migration effectively and with compassion.\n\nLet's get this done!\n\nHonourable members,\n\nWe know that migration requires constant work.\n\nAnd nowhere is that more vital than in the fight against human smugglers.\n\nThey attract desperate people with their lies.\n\nAnd put them on deadly routes across the desert, or on boats that are unfit for the sea.\n\nThe way these smugglers operate is continuously evolving.\n\nBut our legislation is over twenty years old and needs an urgent update.\n\nSo we need new legislation and a new governance structure.\n\nWe need stronger law enforcement, prosecution and a more prominent role for our agencies – Europol, Eurojust and Frontex.\n\nAnd we need to work with our partners to tackle this global plague of human trafficking.\n\nThis is why the Commission will organise an International Conference on fighting people smuggling.\n\nIt is time to put an end to this callous and criminal business!\n\nUKRAINE\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nOn the day when Russian tanks crossed the border into Ukraine, a young Ukrainian mother set off for Prague to bring her child to safety.\n\nWhen the Czech border official stamped her passport, she started crying.\n\nHer son didn't understand. And he asked his mother why she was crying.\n\nShe answered: “Because we are home.”\n\n“But this is not Ukraine,” he argued.\n\nSo she explained: “This is Europe.”\n\nOn that day, that Ukrainian mother, felt that Europe was her home.\n\nBecause “home is where we trust each other”.\n\nAnd the people of Ukraine could trust their fellow Europeans.\n\nHer name was Victoria Amelina.\n\nShe was one of the great young writers of her generation and a tireless activist for justice.\n\nOnce her son was safe, Victoria returned to Ukraine to document Russia's war crimes.\n\nOne year later she was killed by a Russian ballistic missile, while having dinner with colleagues.\n\nThe victim of a Russian war crime, one of countless attacks against innocent civilians.\n\nAmelina was with three friends that day – including Héctor Abad Faciolince, a fellow writer from Colombia.\n\nHe is part of a campaign called “Aguanta, Ucrania” – “Resist, Ukraine”, created to tell Latin Americans of Russia's war of aggression and attacks on civilians.\n\nBut Héctor could never imagine becoming the target himself.\n\nAfterwards, he said he didn't know why he lived and she died.\n\nBut now he is telling the world about Victoria. To save her memory and to end this war.\n\nAnd I am honoured that Héctor is here with us today.\n\nAnd I want you to know that we will keep the memory of Victoria – and all other victims – alive.\n\nAguanta, Ucrania. Slava Ukraini!\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nWe will be at Ukraine's side every step of the way.\n\nFor as long as it takes.\n\nSince the start of the war, four million Ukrainians have found refuge in our Union.\n\nAnd I want to say to them that they are as welcome now as they were in those fateful first weeks.\n\nWe have ensured that they have access to housing, healthcare, the job market and much more.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nthis was Europe answering the call of history.\n\nAnd so I am proud to announce that the Commission will propose to extend our temporary protection to Ukrainians in the EU.\n\nOur support to Ukraine will endure.\n\nWe have provided 12 billion euros this year alone to help pay wages and pensions.\n\nTo help keep hospitals, schools and other services running.\n\nAnd through our ASAP proposal we are ramping up ammunition production to help match Ukraine's immediate needs.\n\nBut we are also looking further ahead.\n\nThis is why we have proposed an additional 50 billion euros over four years for investment and reforms.\n\nThis will help build Ukraine's future to rebuild a modern and prosperous country.\n\nAnd that future is clear to see.\n\nThis House has said it out loud: The future of Ukraine is in our Union.\n\nThe future of the Western Balkans is in our Union.\n\nThe future of Moldova is in our Union.\n\nAnd I know just how important the EU perspective is for so many people in Georgia.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nI started by speaking of Europe responding to the call of history.\n\nAnd history is now calling us to work on completing our Union.\n\nIn a world where some are trying to pick off countries one by one, we cannot afford to leave our fellow Europeans behind.\n\nIn a world where size and weight matters, it is clearly in Europe's strategic and security interests to complete our Union.\n\nBut beyond the politics and geopolitics of it, we need to picture what is at stake.\n\nWe need to set out a vision for a successful enlargement.\n\nA Union complete with over 500 million people living in a free, democratic and prosperous Union.\n\nA Union complete with young people who can live, study and work in freedom.\n\nA Union complete with vibrant democracies in which judiciaries are independent, oppositions are respected, and journalists are protected.\n\nBecause the rule of law and fundamental rights will always be the foundation of our Union – in current and in future Member States.\n\nThis is why the Commission has made the Rule of Law Reports a key priority.\n\nWe now work closely with Member States to identify progress and concerns – and make recommendations for the year ahead.\n\nThis has ensured accountability in front of this House and national parliaments.\n\nIt has allowed for dialogue between Member States.\n\nAnd it is delivering results.\n\nI believe that it can do the same for future Member States.\n\nThis is why I am very happy to announce that we will open the Rule of Law Reports to those accession countries who get up to speed even faster.\n\nThis will place them on an equal footing with Member States.\n\nAnd support them in their reform efforts.\n\nAnd it will help ensure that our future is a Union of freedom, rights and values for all.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nThis is in our shared interest.\n\nThink about the great enlargement of 20 years ago.\n\nWe called it the European Day of Welcomes.\n\nAnd it was a triumph of determination and hope over the burdens of the past.\n\nAnd in the 20 years since we have seen an economic success story which has improved the lives of millions.\n\nI want us to look forward to the next European Day of Welcomes and the next economic success stories.\n\nWe know this is not an easy road.\n\nAccession is merit-based – and the Commission will always defend this principle.\n\nIt takes hard work and leadership.\n\nBut there is already a lot of progress.\n\nWe have seen the great strides Ukraine has already made since we granted them candidate status.\n\nAnd we have seen the determination of other candidate countries to reform.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nit is now time for us to match that determination.\n\nAnd that means thinking about how we get ready for a completed Union.\n\nWe need to move past old, binary debates about enlargement.\n\nThis is not a question of deepening integration or widening the Union.\n\nWe can and we must do both.\n\nTo give us the geopolitical weight and the capacity to act.\n\nThis is what our Union has always done.\n\nEach wave of enlargement came with a political deepening.\n\nWe went from coal and steel towards full economic integration.\n\nAnd after the fall of the Iron Curtain, we turned an economic project into a true Union of people and states.\n\nI believe that the next enlargement must also be a catalyst for progress.\n\nWe have started to build a Health Union at 27.\n\nAnd I believe we can finish it at 30+.\n\nWe have started to build European Defence Union at 27.\n\nAnd I believe we can finish it at 30+.\n\nWe have proven that we can be a Geopolitical Union andshowed we can move fast when we are united.\n\nAnd I believe that Team Europe also works at 30+.\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nI know this House believes the same.\n\nAnd the European Parliament has always been one of the main drivers of European integration.\n\nIt has been so throughout the decades.\n\nAnd it is once again today.\n\nAnd I will always support this House – and all of those who want to reform the EU to make it work better for citizens.\n\nAnd, yes, that means including through a European Convention and Treaty change if and where it is needed!\n\nBut we cannot – and we should not – wait for Treaty change to move ahead with enlargement.\n\nA Union fit for enlargement can be achieved faster.\n\nThat means answering practical questions about how a Union of over 30 countries will work in practice.\n\nAnd in particular about our capacity to act.\n\nThe good news is that with every enlargement those who said it would make us less efficient were proven wrong.\n\nTake the last few years.\n\nWe agreed on NextGenerationEU at 27.\n\nWe agreed to buy vaccines at 27.\n\nWe agreed on sanctions in record time – also at 27.\n\nWe agreed to purchase natural gas – not only at 27 but including Ukraine, Moldova and Serbia.\n\nSo it can be done.\n\nBut we need to look closer at each policy and see how they would be affected by a larger Union.\n\nThis is why the Commission will start working on a series of pre-enlargement policy reviews to see how each area may need to be adapted to a larger Union.\n\nWe will need to think about how our institutions would work – how the Parliament and the Commission would look.\n\nWe need to discuss the future of our budget – in terms of what it finances, how it finances it, and how it is financed.\n\nAnd we need to understand how to ensure credible security commitments in a world where deterrence matters more than ever.\n\nThese are questions we must address today if we want to be ready for tomorrow.\n\nAnd the Commission will play its part.\n\nThis is why we will put forward our ideas to the Leaders' discussion under the Belgian Presidency.\n\nWe will be driven by the belief that completing our Union is the best investment in peace, security and prosperity for our Continent.\n\nSo it is time for Europe to once again think big and write our own destiny!\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nHonourable Members,\n\nVictoria Amelina believed that it is our collective duty to write a new story for Europe.\n\nThis is where Europe stands today.\n\nAt a time and place where history is written.\n\nThe future of our continent depends on the choices we make today.\n\nOn the steps we take to complete our Union.\n\nThe people of Europe want a Union that stands up for them in a time of great power competition.\n\nBut also one that protects and stands close to them, as a partner and ally in their daily battles.\n\nAnd we will listen to their voice.\n\nIf it matters to Europeans, it matters to Europe.\n\nThink again about the vision and imagination of the young generation I started my speech with.\n\nIt is the moment to show them that we can build a continent where you can be who you are, love who you want, and aim as high as you want.\n\nA continent reconciled with nature and leading the way on new technologies.\n\nA continent that is united in freedom and peace.\n\nOnce again – this is Europe's moment to answer the call of history."
