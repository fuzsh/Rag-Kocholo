        "text": "Update from November 2023:\n\nOn 1 November 2023, an amendment to the Citizenship Law entered into force which provides that a child born on the territory who meets the conditions to be recognised as stateless will be granted Moldovan nationality. This legislative amendment prevents cases of statelessness among children born on the territory of the Republic of Moldova, improving how Moldova is assessed in the existence of this safeguard. Previously, a stateless child’s ability to acquire nationality was dependent on the status of their parents (as shown below).\n\nThe information below was last updated in February 2023. A full update to this page will be available in early 2025.\n\nLaw, policy, and practice on the protection of stateless people and prevention and reduction of statelessness is generally positive in Moldova. The country’s record on treaty accession is good and it has established a dedicated Statelessness Determination Procedure (SDP) in law. The SDP is accessible, with a mandatory interview, an option to initiate the procedure ex officio, and some rights are granted to applicants. People recognised as stateless in Moldova are granted rights in line with nationals, but do not have any political rights (for example, they cannot vote in any elections). Although there is an accelerated route to naturalisation, reduced from ten years, a stateless person must still wait eight years before being eligible to apply for naturalisation.\n\nMoldovan law provides for detention to be used only as a last resort and a country of removal must be set prior to detention for removal. There are partial safeguards in nationality law to prevent statelessness and the Moldovan legal framework provides for universal birth registration. However, access to birth registration and a birth certificate is hindered in practice by the requirement that parents must be documented to register a birth, with some communities at higher risk of remaining unregistered, including Roma. Provisions for deprivation of nationality are broadly in line with international standards.\n\nIdentifies whether countries have a definition of a stateless person in national law that aligns with the 1954 Convention, and whether they have a dedicated statelessness determination procedure (SDP) leading to a dedicated stateless status. If an SDP is not place, it assesses whether there are other procedures in which statelessness can be identified or other routes through which stateless people could regularise their stay or access their rights. Countries are subdivided in three groups to enable comparison between those with an SDP leading to protection, those with other procedures, and those with a statelessness status but no clear mechanism to access protection. The existing procedures and rights granted to stateless persons are examined and assessed against international norms and good practice. Assesses whether stateless people fleeing war have access to temporary protection.\n\nMoldova has had a dedicated SDP in law since 2011, which in many ways is an example of good practice. The procedure is accessible, with no fee or residence requirement, and can be initiated ex officio, in person, orally or in writing. The dedicated Statelessness Unit must examine claims within six months, free legal aid is provided by NGOs, an interview is mandatory, an interpreter can be arranged, and training is provided to the competent authority by UNHCR. The burden of proof is shared, and although not established in law, the standard of proof is the same as in the asylum procedure, and cross-referral between procedures is established. Applicants are protected from expulsion and have access to some basic rights, including the right to work; and there is an automatic right to appeal. People recognised as stateless are granted permanent residence and rights in line with nationals. Eligibility for naturalisation is reduced from the standard 10 years but stateless people must still wait eight years before being eligible for naturalisation.\n\nThere are several gaps in detention law, policy, and practice in Moldova. Although there are some protections against the arbitrary detention of stateless people in that powers to detain are provided for in law, detention should be a last resort and a country of removal must be set prior to detaining; in practice, it is unclear how these principles are implemented. The maximum time limit differs for different types of detention, but there is no time limit for detention pending deportation following a criminal conviction. The provision of information to detainees on their rights is not set out in law and is provided by UNHCR’s NGO partners at the discretion of the government. There are some remedies for detainees, but periodic judicial reviews were removed in 2016, although a 2018 advisory opinion of the Supreme Court requires this to be reinstated. People released from detention will either be transferred to the Statelessness Unit for documentation if recognised as stateless or granted ‘tolerated stay’ if not.\n\nMoldovan nationality law previously contained full safeguards to prevent childhood statelessness, but amendments in 2018 increased the risk that children may be born stateless on the territory. Since 2018, children born on the territory who would otherwise be stateless may only acquire nationality automatically at birth if at least one of their parents has legal residence, international protection, or stateless status. Foundlings automatically acquire nationality and children born to Moldovan parents acquire Moldovan nationality automatically. However, efforts to prevent statelessness in Moldova are hindered by barriers to universal free birth registration. At least the mother must be documented to register a birth, which means that some parents face barriers to registering births, including Roma and other members of minority groups."
