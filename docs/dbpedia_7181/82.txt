Petroglyph Games Inc. is a video game development studio based in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. The company was formed by a group of former Westwood Studios employees who had resigned when Electronic Arts merged Westwood Studios into EA Los Angeles in 2003. Other former Westwood employees initially accepted EA's relocation offer, but eventually returned to Las Vegas to work with Petroglyph. Coincidentally, the old Westwood Studios building is not that far away from the current Petroglyph building.

Petroglyph is primarily known for their strong experience in RTS game development. The company's founding members have worked on seminal and influential games in the genre, most notably Command & Conquer and Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty, which affected Petroglyph's focus on strategy games.

After announcing a partnership with the publishing studio True Games Interactive in April 2008, the action strategy title Mytheon was revealed in December of the same year.
