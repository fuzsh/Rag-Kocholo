        "text": "Background\n\nPetroglyph Games is an American video game developer based in Las Vegas. It was founded in 2003 by Joe Bostic, Michael Legg and Steve Tall, programmers formerly from the ashes of the recently closed Westwood Studios.\n\nLogo (February 16, 2006-)\n\nVisuals: On a stone wall, there is a drawing of a figure holding a spear in an attacking pose, facing a UFO. The logo flashes to gold and the wall fades to black. The text \"PETROGLYPH\" in an ancient-style font fades in underneath.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn Star Wars: Empire at War, the logo flashes into view, blurred at first before sharpening to normal. It turns to brown as a result.\n\nOn some games, the logo wipes into view while glowing. The glow effect fades out.\n\nSometimes, the logo is still.\n\nSometimes, pixels wipe in and form the logo, which becomes clearer later.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: A Chinese-style tune with whooshes. Otherwise it's the opening theme of the game."
