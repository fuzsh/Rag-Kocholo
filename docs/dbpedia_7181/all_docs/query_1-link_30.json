It's a throw back to the older Command & Conquer games with a simplified building system.\n\nI'm glad for them since after the cancellation of End of Nations the developer was in trouble. I hope this game doesn't share the same fate.\n\nFive centuries after humans first left earth, three factions fight to control the lifeblood of a rocky oasis: Ecosystem Nine. It is a world of chaos. Survival depends on the ability to grow, fight—and to evolve.\n\nAs commander to one of three factions, your goal is simple: to wage war. To forge machines of battle from catalyst, Nine’s powerful resource—because whoever attains the largest supply has the tightest grip on the future.\n\nHere are a few links.\n\nPC Gamer preview- http://www.pcgamer.com/previews/grey-goo-preview/\n\nGames Webpage- http://greygoo.greybox.com/\n\nLast edited: March 13, 2014\n\nJoined\n\nOct 1, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n37,618\n\nLocation\n\nSpudlandia\n\nBerek\n\nCommunity Manager\n\nJoined\n\nNovember 2, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n5\n\nLocation\n\nHouston, TX\n\nMarch 24, 2014\n\n#2\n\nThanks Couchpotato for posting about the game!\n\nJoined\n\nNov 2, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n5\n\nLocation\n\nHouston, TX\n\nCouchpotato\n\nPart-Time News-bot\n\nJoined\n\nOctober 1, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n37,618\n\nLocation\n\nSpudlandia\n\nMarch 24, 2014\n\n#3\n\nThanks Couchpotato for posting about the game!\n\nYour welcome I enjoyed playing most of the games made by Petroglyph.
