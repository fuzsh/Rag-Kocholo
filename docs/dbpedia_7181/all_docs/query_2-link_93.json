Rise of Immortals is a free-to-play MOBA -- i.e. \"it's like Defense of the Ancients\" -- that features persistent character creation and, of course, plenty of microtransaction-fueled goodies. The game allows players to choose from twelve customizable Immortals with different abilities and take them into battle in either player-vs-player or player-vs-environment matches.\n\nThose wishing to sign up for the beta should head over to the Rise of Immortals website; the test is currently offered only to \"friends & family,\" though it will expand to more players in the coming weeks. Check out some screens in the gallery below and find a trailer after the break.\n%Gallery-117314%",
