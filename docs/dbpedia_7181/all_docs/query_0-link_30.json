        "text": "The Deer Valley Petroglyph Preserve is proud to partner with Agents of Discovery to bring an AR tour to your visit of the preserve!\n\nMeet Kit the Kestrel! Join Kit on two different Missions of the Deer Valley Petroglyph Preserve through interactive games that are fun for the whole family! You may choose to experience a general Mission of the preserve, learning about the archaeological research conducted by Dr. J. Simon Bruder in 1980, the petroglyphs and the people who made them, or play a Mission on Sonoran Desert Ecology.\n\nThe Agents of Discovery app is free to download and requires no Wi-Fi or cellular data in order to play. It is especially great for educators who are wanting to provide students with a field trip experience. Aside from our site, Agents of Discovery missions can also be found around the state at the S'edav Va'aki Museum and a few locations run by the Bureau of Land Management. There are many Agents of Discovery Missions you can find throughout California, Colorado, Washington, and more!\n\nTo Get Started:\n\n1. Download the Agents of Discovery app on your mobile device before your visit: Google Play | Apple Store\n\n2. After downloading, visit the Deer Valley Petroglyph Preserve! In order to have access to the Missions, you must be physically at our site.\n\n3. Open the app, click on \"Missions,\" and select whichever mission you are wanting to play! The Preserve's Missions are called \"Explore the Deer Valley Petroglyph Preserve!\" and \"Desert Ecology at Deer Valley!\""
