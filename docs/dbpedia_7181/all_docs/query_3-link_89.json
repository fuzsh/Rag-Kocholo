        "text": "Background to the rock art in Zimbabwe\n\nIn general, almost every animal encountered in Zimbabwe has been drawn on the rock art sites, along with scenes of hunter-gatherers engaged in different activities from hunting and dancing to camp scenes. More rarely painted are birds, fish, insects and reptiles, such as crocodiles. Other objects painted include trees, roots and abstract shapes called ovoids or formlings which are unique to Zimbabwe and not found in the rock art of South Africa.\n\nKatz observes from living amongst the San community that a large dance, in which several camps participate, includes about fifty to eighty persons. In such a large dance, fifteen to thirty women may be singing at different times. They are usually adult, joined by some of the more enthusiastic adolescents, as shown at Thetford site in the adjacent photo from the Thetford Game Reserve rock art site. The adolescent participants are shown as smaller versions of the adults, but otherwise identical.\n\nAbout seven to fifteen men may be dancing at any one time, most of them young or middle-aged.\n\nThe healing dance itself would last all night and includes every member of the community, plus the invisible spirits of the dead, the gauwasi, who are drawn by the singing and dancing and who stay in the darkness, outside the fire-light and try to shoot small, invisible “arrows of sickness” into people. The San believe that all members of the community have sickness in them, but through the spirits of their dead relatives the gauwasi, this sickness can turn into a real illness, or injury. The trancer then engages in a struggle with the gauwasi over the person.\n\nThe photo above is situated directly above the dancers and healer depicted on the Thetford site and may show the gauwasi crouched, preparing their “arrows of sickness.” Garlake suggests that the large elaborate arrowheads are a key indicator of trancing. Clearly arrowheads of this size were not used in hunting and thus they must have an alternative significance.\n\nThe trance dance process\n\nTo the right of the above scene, the male dancers are painted in a different shade of ochre and are scattered around in a frenzy of dancing movement and facing different directions.\n\nPeter Garlake, in his book The Hunter’s Vision,[vii] describes how hoops drawn on either side of the neck are intended by the artists to portray the enlarged arteries of a shaman in trance and this rare image is seen very clearly in the photo enlargement alongside of the trance.\n\nKatz quotes a trancer “You dance, dance, dance, dance. The n/um lifts you up in your belly and lifts you in your back and you start to shiver. N/um makes you tremble, it’s hot. Your eyes are open, but you don’t look around; you hold your eyes still and look straight ahead. But when you get into !kia, you’re looking around because you see everything, because you see what’s troubling everybody. Rapid shallow breathing draws n/um up. What I do in my upper body, the breathing, I also do in my legs with the dancing. You don’t stomp harder, you just keep steady. Then n/um enters your body, right to the tip of your feet and even your hair. ”\n\nThe power or potency of n/um could be attained by any in the San community who participated in the communal dance activities. Dancers who attain trance state and out-of-body experiences on a regular basis are termed shamans. Katz states that dancers can only heal when they learn to control their boiling n/um, or energy. Then they learn to “pull out sickness.”\n\nThe photo above from the Thetford site shows four male figures below the trancer. One appears to have large animal ears and wavy arms; the second is in a wide-apart stance and has one raised wavy arm, the third has a V-shape object on his shoulder and a line rises vertically from his head.\n\nAll of these features are indicative of trance dance. The fourth figure is four times larger and painted in orange ochre. One arm is much longer than the other, the feet are attenuated and the torso is headless, although several lines flow from the neck. The elongation of limbs has already been discussed within the context of trance.\n\nAccording to Marshall, San healers may use plant substances which contain n/um. These plants are ground to a powder, mixed with marrow, or fat, and put in an empty tortoise shell, several inches long. Healers place a burning coal into the mixture, wafting the smoke, which carries n/um, toward the patient.\n\nIn support of this, the rock face at the Thetford site provides a very real example of being an active part of the vision the shaman artists are attempting to portray. The patient at the heart of the healing process lies huddled within a natural circular hollow within the rock face. The author is not aware of any other reported examples in Zimbabwe of the artists actually incorporating the physical features of the rock surface into their art.\n\nAcknowledgements"
