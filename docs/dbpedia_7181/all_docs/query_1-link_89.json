        "text": "Video game enthusiasts have long mourned the loss of the Westwood Studios, which arguably invented the real-time strategy genre by creating Dune II back in1992.\n\nThe Las Vegas-based studio was bought by Electronic Arts in 1998, and closed down just five years later after two ambitious projects --Command & Conquer: Renegade and Earth & Beyond -- didn't sell as well as EA had hoped.\n\nWhat most people don't know is that after Westwood Studios closed, a group of former Westwood employees opened up an independent Las Vegas-based studio, Petroglyph Games, in 2003. They've been releasing games ever since, with varying degrees of success, and have even worked with Electronic Arts to release .\n\nRELATED |\n\nNow, it looks like Petroglyph is hoping to recapture some of their former glory by creatingEarthbreakers, a hybrid of the first-person-shooter and real-time strategy genres that looks to capture the spirit of Command & Conquer: Renegade.\n\nThe game will involve working as a team to harvest resources and build a base as you fight against opposing forces in a race to create better equipment and defenses and destroy the enemy headquarters.\n\nThe similarities to its predecessor are clear, right down to the iconic \"boink\" sound-effect and using vehicles to harvest a strange, almost-magical resource to build improvements. Command and Conquer: Renegade's old, defunct Facebook page even gave the game a wink and a nod when the trailer was first released.\n\nWhat's more, Frank Klepacki, the iconic video game composer who created the scores for dozens of Westwood Studios' old games, that he will be creating music for Earthbreakers."
