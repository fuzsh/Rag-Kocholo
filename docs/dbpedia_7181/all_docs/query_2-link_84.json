        "text": "The Great War: Western Front\n\nby\n\nPetroglyph Games\n\nPublished by Frontier Foundry\n\nOnce again, we travel to the first part of the 20th century for a look at a game. Oddly enough, it is not a boardgame but a computer one. There are tons of World War II games, both board and computer, but not many computer World War One games. I think you can count them using your fingers. So, why has Petroglyph Games decided to drop us into the mud, blood and frustration of the Western Front? Maybe it is because the field is rather thin, and they would stick out more, rather than designing the 1000th WWII game. The game has a campaign and allows you to play historical battles (historical battles in my eye should always be included in wargames). It also comes with a skirmish mode.\n\nVisually the game is stunning. The putrid treeless morass that was most World War One battlefields is present in the game. It is almost too correct looking for a game. Everything that was used to kill in WWI is also here. The game has artillery, tanks, gas, and planes plus a lot more. The uniforms are even correct. For the history lover or wargamer, it is history brought to life.\n\nAs you can see by this statement about the game, it has a great pedigree:\n\n\"Revel in an authentic historical strategy game that captures the gravity and intensity of The Great War. Partnering with the Imperial War Museums, their expertise enables us to accurately portray these pivotal moments in history.\"\n\nIf you are partnering with the Imperial War Museum for a game, you best have all your ducks in a row.\n\nThe game keeps you on the edge of your seat. You need to add reinforcements to your beleaguered troops in the trenches. However, you also need to target the incoming enemy with your guns. How much time you have to do everything is the question. You can slow down the time. However, it is not a turn-based game, it is a real-time strategy game. Also, you can pause the battle whenever you want to catch a breather. Does it get a bit frenetic at times? Yes, if you let it and forget that you can take it slower. One of my bad habits with the game is forgetting that I can slow down and think more about things.\n\nYou cannot forget that you are playing a WWI game. The defense has a great advantage over offense, if you are playing correctly. You will see your troops just disintegrate before the enemy trenches. If you are attacking and have 'rolling barrages' pounding on the enemy, you have to make sure that your troops are following them closely. How close? As close as you can get them without having them perish. As I said, use the pause button and look around. Also, be aware of your reinforcements and continually feed them into the meat grinder.\n\nIt seems so easy to do when you look at this screen.\n\nThis is a game where the player can get frustrated at times. Just take your time and use your head. This is an RTS, but it is a thinking man's RTS. Also, your troops are not all equals. You will have mediocre ones and you will have much better-quality ones. This is one game where going through the tutorial is mandatory. Do not just flippantly jump out of it and head toward a historical battle or campaign. You will end up dying quickly and possibly just leaving the game in your library, never to be played again. Trust me, the game is worth taking your time with. When you do direct a well-conceived assault for the first time, and it all goes as planned, it is a great feeling. It also looks great watching it on the screen. This game has tons of history built into it.\n\nOnce again, I taste bitter defeat.\n\nThe campaign game has even more than the entire other parts of the game. You get put into Haig's or Falkenhayn's shoes. It is up to you to run the entire Western Front. It gives you the choice of not only where, but also how, you are going to attack the enemy. This is what the game says about the campaign game:\n\n\"As Theatre Commander, experience enthralling turn-based grand-strategy as you direct the deployment of forces, perform research and carefully consider how you disseminate your resources. Alongside this, take up the mantle of Field Commander in dynamic real-time battles as you direct units to defeat your opponent, build trenches and perform direct assaults by sending your infantry over the top.\"\n\nThank you very much Petroglyph Games and Frontier Foundry, for letting me review this beautiful game. Just remember that it is also deep and not just eye candy.\n\nRobert"
