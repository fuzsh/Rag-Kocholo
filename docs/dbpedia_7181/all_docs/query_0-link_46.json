        "text": "On low-lying rocks, often on the beach or beside a stream, Alutiiq ancestors pecked holes in rocks and sometimes cut lines between the holes. Most of the holes, also known as cupules, are circular and just a few centimeters across. Some rocks have a few holes, others have many. What are these holes? In the Alutiiq world circles and holes are passages between the human and the spirit worlds. Perhaps pecked holes helped the souls of captured fish and animals return to the spirit world so they could be reborn. Cupules are often found by salmon streams and at bay mouths, places where people harvested fish and game.\n\nAnother kind of petroglyph shows human faces, animals, and geometric designs. Dancing people, groups of faces, whales, birds, and spirals are among the designs. These images are much larger than the small pecked holes and delicate lines, and they are often in visible places. Some may have been part of hunting rituals, created to ensure success at whaling. Others may have been territorial markers, designed to show that an harvesting area was used by a particular family or community."
