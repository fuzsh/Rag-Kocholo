        "text": "Archaeologists, anthropologists, and historians know that prehistoric people did not spend all their time finding and collecting food. For many nomadic hunter-gatherers and later agricultural societies, food sources were abundant. Their lives allowed free-time to play games, to tell stories and socialize with their family groups, and to create. Prehistoric people used rock for tools, but also as a medium for artistic communication and expression. Many examples of prehistoric rock art survive today. Ancient rock art is found around the world and can be attributed to many different cultures. Cave pictures such as those found at Lascaux, France (c. 15,000 - 10,000 BC) and Altamira, Spain display animals and hunt scenes. This rock art is not ancient grafitti. These people did not have an alphabet, paper, pen or pencils, cameras, or any other way to record their beliefs and experiences. The rock art tells us stories, reveals traces of their religious beliefs and ceremonies, and relates some of the history of the people who created the images.\n\nSouthwestern US Rock Art\n\nAncient rock art can also be found everywhere in North America. Tens of thousands of rock art sites are found in the Southwest (Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, Texas, Utah, and New Mexico), over 7,500 sites in Utah alone. The mysterious images and markings that were pecked or painted on boulders and cliffs are referred to as primitive art; however, they are also communication efforts. Their messages convey a mental image from one mind to another, similar to today's road signs, trademarks, cartoons, advertisments, and other symbols. These ancient images - - symbols of their times - - are found above stone shelters, inside caves or ceremonial rooms, alongside watering places, near game trails, at food gathering spots, and near cultivation areas.\n\nReasons for their creation could have included marking territory; depicting shamanic prayers or visions; recording rituals, successful hunts and battles; ensuring rain, harvests, and fertility; creating designs for pleasure, or chronicling human presence. Whatever the purpose, these artifacts provide a visual record from ancient societies.\n\nPictograph or Petroglyph - What's the Difference?\n\nThere are two types of pictured rocks: petroglyphs and pictographs. Confusingly, some experts classify both petroglyphs and pictographs as being pictographs - - that is, they recognize the term pictograph to include both pictographs and petroglyphs. If we can get past that, lets concentrate on separating the two types or techniques.\n\nPetroglyphs are motifs that are pecked, ground, incised, scratched, or abraded into the rock surface. The name petroglyph is Greek with petro referring to rock and glyph meaning drawing or engraving. Many of them were executed on cliff faces or boulders that were covered in 'rock varnish' (Above right photograph). In a few locations, you can find petroglyphs on an unvarnished rock surface - - an 'intaglio' design that is carved directly into the rock (Example: Inscription Rock shown below). In both instances, rock tools were used to dent, chisel, or chip the images into the stone canvas.\n\nSouthwestern rock art is often composed of anthropomorphs (human-like figures), zoomorphs (animal-like figures), and abstract designs. Other image types are found including body parts such as hands and feet, plants, masks, shields, and maplike images.\n\nIt is difficult to establish the exact age of rock art. In some instances, dating clues are easily identified. The presence of bows and arrows indicate a date after 500 AD. If a horse and rider are shown, it is known to be after 1540 AD when Spaniards reintroduced the horse.\n\nIn the foothills near the historic mining town of Chloride in northeastern Arizona are the rock murals of well-known artist Roy Pucell (See photos below). These unusual examples of modern rock art were created in 1960s by the artist, then an unknown graduate student and also a working miner in that area. The artwork includes scenes of weathered buildings, ghost towns, landscapes, and symbolic figures. The Murals have held up well through the years and the colors remain vibrant even after almost forty years. Curiously if one searches nearby, you find a few weathered and faded petroglyphs from hundreds of years before.\n\nMore Information\n\nRock art sites are found on private, state, federal, and Native American tribal lands. All ancient rock art sites are protected areas; that is, federal laws are enforced to protect them from theft, defacement, and vandalism. Take care of them. The sites are extremely fragile. Once damaged, the site cannot be restored to its original condition. Never touch the rock surfaces. Oils from your skin chemically alter the surface and also attract insects and animals. Do not make chalk rubbings or try to change the images in any manner. Take care when walking around rock art sites; avoid treading on panels that you did not notice.\n\nFor additional information about rock art, pictographs, and petroglyphs, visit some or all of these websites:\n\n\"The Journey\" of Roy Purcell from Roadtrip America\n\nhttp://www.roadtripamerica.com/places/chloride.htm\n\nPetroglyphs and Rock Paintings http://www.execpc.com/~jcampbel/\n\nRock Art Pages by by J.Q.
