After all, we've got plenty of trails for getting mud on those tires, including those in Guernsey, Buffalo Bill and Curt Gowdy State Parks.\r\n\r\nIf making a splash is more your style, we've got space for water sports and fishing at our many reservoirs . Once you're done playing, soak those bones in the therapeutic mineral water at Hot Springs State Park. When bedtime rolls around, park the RV or roll out a sleeping bag; because at our overnight sites, all it takes to check in is a zip of the tent.",

        "text": "About Our Site - Legend Rock State Petroglyph Site\n\nLegend Rock State Petroglyph Site is a 400 meters long (1,312 feet) near vertical cliff with more than 92 prehistoric petroglyph panels and over 300 petroglyph figures. While the site is not extensively promoted, Legend Rock is already a world-renowned petroglyph site. Legend Rock has been a sacred site for Native Americans of this region for thousands of years. Local concern for the preservation and protection of the site led to acquisition of the property as a Wyoming State Petroglyph Site in 1973. During the same year, the site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Legend Rock Petroglyph Site is one of the most fragile in the Wyoming State Parks system.\n\nLegend Rock is located 29 miles northwest of Thermopolis. Completed in 2011, Legend Rock now has a visitor center, interpretative trails, and picnic shelter. During the summer, the visitor's center will be operated by volunteer site hosts.\n\nWe are open. Please view our hours to find a good time to visit!\n\nSunrise to sunset.\n\nSeason\n\nSite grounds open year-round, weather permitting:\n\nMay through September, no key required, open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nOctober through April, key required, can be picked up at State Bath House.
