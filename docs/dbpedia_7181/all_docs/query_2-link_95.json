The company was formed by a group of former Westwood Studios employees who had resigned when Electronic Arts merged Westwood Studios into the EA Pacific studios in Los Angeles to form EA Los Angeles. Other former Westwood employees initially accepted EA's relocation offer, but eventually returned to Las Vegas to work with Petroglyph. Coincidentally, the old Westwood Studios building is not that far away from the current Petroglyph building.\n\nPetroglyph is primarily known for their strong experience in RTS game development. The company's founding members have worked on seminal and influential games in the genre, most notably \"Command & Conquer\" and \"Dune II\", which established the template for modern RTS games. Petroglyph Games' employees average more than 12 years of industry experience.\n\nHistory\n\n*Petroglyph Games is formed on April 1, 2003.\n\n*On June 25, 2004, the company moved into their own building.\n\n*On November 16, 2004, Petroglyph announced a project which they were working on, a new \"Star Wars\" real-time strategy (RTS) game called \"\", which was released on February 16, 2006.\n\n*On September 12, 2005, it was announced that they would be working on an original military/sci-fi RTS franchise with Sega.\n\n*On January 27, 2007, Petroglyph announced their second game, \"\". \"Universe at War\" was released on December 10, 2007.\n\n*On April 15, 2008, Petroglyph announced that they would be working in partnership with True Games Interactive on a Free-to-Play micro-transaction based online game for the PC.\n\nGames developed\n\n* \"\" (February 2006)\n\n** \"\" (October 2006)\n\n* \"\" (December 2007)\n\nee also\n\n* Alamo (game engine)\n\nExternal links"
