        "text": "Everyone who had ever had a chance to be in places outlined in the monograph knows, what kind of strength, dedication and desire to overcome one's limitations a person needs just to see these monuments [rock art] since the location of them often are kept in secret in order to avoid evil shamanic spirits.\n\n—A. P. Okladnikov and A. I. Mazin (1976)\n\nThe region that embraces the Lena, Olekma, Aldan, and Amur rivers basins has the densest concentration of rock art paintings in Eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East. Starting in the eighteenth century, every famous expedition led by imperial explorers with ethnographic, archaeological, geographical, and historical interests of this remote and unexplored region also paid attention to rock art as objects of “uncovered mystery” (Georgi 1799; Klements 1895: 33; Miller [1750] 1937; Vitashevskii 1897). However, these rock art paintings—made with red ochre on flat surfaces of large and prominent rocks located near rivers—reached their peak of scientific popularity and public fascination during the postwar Soviet times. Indeed, the Soviet state supported many archaeological expeditions searching for and documenting rock art sites in the context of state mega-plans for the industrial development of remote Siberian areas, like hydroelectric plants or river dams. The Soviet archeologist Alexei Okladnikov led an expedition along the Lena River and conducted field research even during the World War II when most academics—including those with doctoral degrees—were mobilized to the front (see Klein 2014: 312). This oportunity to conduct field research during the most turbulent years could be explained by arguing that Soviet officials needed heroes and their fascinating exploits to entertain a devastated postwar society. With extensive state support, rock art became a systematic multidisciplinary academic trend, as well as one of the most enigmatic and romantically charged subjects in Soviet archaeology (see Brandišauskas forthcoming c). A few monumental monographs and dozens of articles dedicated to the rock art research were published and became famous in the Soviet academic world (see Kochmar 1994; Mazin 1986; Okladnikov and Mazin 1976, 1979; Okladnikov and Zaporozhskaia 1959, 1969, 1970, 1972).\n\nScientific descriptions and publications of certain rock art sites often start with reference to the first scientist(s) or explorer(s), who are praised as the “discoverer(s)” of a rock art site. To be a discoverer of the archeological monument was a prestigious achievement signifying (or representing) of one's academic success and professionalism. These newly “discovered” rock art sites had been well known to local hunters and villagers for ages. Rock art offerings found and documented by archeologists also confirmed that these sites had been recently tended by local hunters and reindeer herders. Most rock art sites had been well known as significant landscape features and cosmologically significant subjects for local populations for many centuries. Most sites were reached by Soviet scientists with the help of local indigenous people, with their domestic reindeer employed as transport animals for different research expeditions. Since the seventeenth century, almost all Siberian exploration expedition relied heavily on the knowledge of indigenous guides. Many documents report how scientists and indigenous people cooperated in the documentation of rock art sites, but the contemporary indigenous interactions with rock art sites were mainly ignored by archeologists. This was because of the archeologists were mainly interested in the ancient past of the rock art, while contemporary reindeer herders’ beliefs and their offerings left behind were referred to as useless pozniatiny (later artifacts).\n\nAs my previous ethnographic research in the Republic of Buriatiia and Zabaikalskii region shows, such rock art sites have been important sites for both the personal and social life of individuals and local indigenous communities as a whole up to the present time (Brandišauskas 2017).1 These sites can be seen as being linked to the ideas of animism as well as human interactions with spirits and animals (see Brandišauskas 2011). During my field research in the Republic of Sakha, the Zabaikalskii region, and the Amur region in 2016–2017, I visited various rock art sites and worked with different Evenki hunters and reindeer herders living in the basins of the Chara, Olekma, Tokko, Tiania, and Nyukzha rivers, as well as scientists, administrators, and natural reserve workers based in large villages and cities of different regions.2 This ethnographic research, along with archival work, allowed me to understand the temporal and spatial permanency of many ideas and practices linked to the indigenous perception of rock art sites as well as compare it to existing knowledge. My research also shows that contemporary indigenous Evenki reindeer herders and hunters living in remote villages, as well as nomadic taiga camps have been continuously visiting rock art sites with personal aspirations, respect, and offerings (Brandišauskas forthcoming b). Various unpublished reports or publications in small journals, as well as monographs, can still provide us a fragmented view of what ideas local indigenous people had about rock art in Soviet times and how they interacted with rock art sites on a daily basis over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. These valuable references of indigenous perceptions taken together with my ethnographic research also allow us to understand some different variations of persisting ideas linked to the sensory perception and use of rock art sites and paintings.\n\nAlthough Soviet archaeologists strived “to make this old writing talk,” they put little effort into elaborating upon contemporary people's interactions with rock art. They were mainly interested in documenting the rich material remains, such as that found in the cracks of the rock art itself. They interpreted rock art by the ethnographic descriptions of nonexistent rituals published by early ethnographers. At the same time, their findings, processes of documentation, and personal perceptions were also shaped by their sensual experiences. Various hardships related to site exploration and the respect shown to indigenous ontologies often demonstrated by archeologists suggest that sensory experiences also played an important role in the subjective perceptions of drawings by both archeologists and indigenous people. In this article, by studying the experiences of some prominent Soviet rock art archeologists along with indigenous engagement with rock art sites, I want to show how so-called intuition—or the sensory perception of the rock art—guided archeologists’ interpretations as well as indigenous peoples’ worldviews. Scientists and indigenous people also left their material imprints on the rock art sites; as active participants into the production of meaning and the modification of rock art, this has shaped how contemporary indigenous people perceive the sentience of many sites of rock art. In such a context, rock art sites can be interpreted as not as something fixed or given, but rather something made and remade over the course of time, depending on the shifting sociopolitical contexts of the involved social actors.\n\nConclusion\n\nIndigenous knowledge as well as wayfinding were important for both access and interpretation of rock art by explorers and scientists. At the same time, little has been revealed about the persistence of meanings and contemporary views and attitudes enacted by communities at these rock art sites. This is especially true for publications during the Soviet times, when the rock art research reached the peak of professionalism, in terms of academic as well as public popularity. First, there was a lack of interest in the interpretations of late and so-called ethnographic artifacts irrelevant to the archeological inquiry. Second, because of Soviet antireligious views, it was hard to ask and write about existing practices and beliefs. Archeologists were mainly interested in revealing the ancient meanings that were encoded in rock art paintings as well as excavating below the rock art paintings when searching for rock art offerings and material traces representing different cultural periods.\n\nRock art rituals have been enacted by Evenkis in communication with nonhuman beings, giving rise to offerings, predictions, emotions, and sensory experiences as well as moral stories that shape humans’ daily practices of subsistence such as hunting and herding. The use and perception of the rock art are inseparable from the active involvement of indigenous Evenkis with a site itself. Rock art drawings displayed on high flat rock surfaces—often under cornices of large and outstanding rocks—were created with the sense of providing monumental and visual importance for the drawings. Hence, the natural environment also plays its role in the creation of a sense of significance around the site and its paintings, in many cases significantly influencing humans’ sensory perceptions such as visual and audible effects. Since most of the drawings have been greatly exposed to sunlight, the sun's positions also affected the “appearance or disappearance” of paintings as well as the gradual interpretations of both scientists and local indigenous people.\n\nDifferent sites still hold easily visible offerings left in cracks, as well as decorated, carved, and marked nearby trees; it is also common to find piles of wooden idols, sometimes also stuck into crevices with the end pointing toward the rock art site. In this way, the offerings create even bigger impressions for the nomadic reindeer herders and hunters passing by. Leaving offerings is part of the continuum of creation of the rock art site, and can be a source of empowerment and inspiration for future generations. It is apparent that rock art should also be researched in the context of indigenous users of these rock art sites, as the nomadic Evenki reindeer herders and hunters as they also modified rock art sites, adding additional meanings to it. Archeologists also modified these sites by leaving excavation sites, empty cracks, lines of chalk, or red pencil—as well as proposing their own interpretations. Different marks left by archeologists and tourists also gained cosmological and moral meanings for indigenous people. Thereby, rock art sites are not only static archeological monuments or relics of the past; rather, they are alive, powerful, generous, and magical places for the Evenki indigenous people who use it on a daily basis.\n\nIn this article, I demonstrated how prominent rock art archeologists of East Siberia and the Far East were guided by their sensory perceptions and interpretation of the rock art. Soviet scientists considered rock art as an archeological and artistic monument that could reveal ancient humans’ emotions, creative expressions, and anxieties. Archaeological excavations and research also show that ritual interactions with rock art have persisted over the centuries. At the same time, various archaeological interpretations were also produced, focused on scientists’ sensory experiences, emotions, and empathic encounters gained through interactions with rock art sites. Scientists and indigenous people not only borrowed some interpretations from each other but also relied on the same experiential knowledge while interacting with actual sites and discovering drawings and meanings. Hence, as many examples show, such rock art research that included searching, discerning, documentation, and interpretation of the rock art was inseparable from embodied experiences of being in the field and in the sentient landscape. Scientific knowledge came to be a result of experiential and sometimes “magic” interactions with a rock art site as well as its natural surroundings. Such scientists’ perceptions of the rock art sites share many common features with how indigenous people find, interact, and make meanings from their encountered rock art sites as well. Thereby, long-term fieldwork in the wilderness brought not only indigenous sensibilities to the researchers, but also influenced their beliefs and ways of seeing and being in the world in an “indigenous way,” which was a way to legitimate the force of their intuitive interpretations. In other words, such sensory and experiential perception of the rock art enabled archeologists to believe that they were fulfilling their promise to “open the window to the unknown world.”"
