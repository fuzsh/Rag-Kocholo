        "text": "YouTube Trailer Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSQXwsMdIX0\n\n8-Bit Invaders is a tribute to classic RTS games and is suitable for existing fans and new players of the genre seeking a friendly approach to strategy gaming. With a colorful, blocky voxel art style, the game is accessible to anyone regardless of experience. Players will collect resources, build up and defend their bases, amass armies of Alien or Galactic Marine units, and ultimately crush their opponents! Packed full of features, the game at launch includes 2 factions, 24 single-player missions, 10 two-player cooperative missions, 10 AI skirmish maps, and up to 8-Player battles online.\n\nA new, strategic Multiverse Mode lets players compete against AI on a larger scale across multiple locales while managing tech, economy, and their grouped armies. The game is also cross-compatible with its two predecessors allowing players from all three 8-Bit titles to play cooperatively or competitively, using any of the 6 factions on dozens of official maps or player-made maps created with the supplied map editor.\n\nWith multiple difficulty levels, inspiring gameplay and beautifully-rendered voxel-themed visuals, 8-Bit Invaders excels at bringing a complex game genre to the masses with its casual approach to the compelling world of RTS.\n\n8-Bit Invaders released on Friday, December 16th, for $19.95 USD (or equivalent in other territories) on Steam, GOG, and Humble Store! A 25% launch discount is available for a limited time.\n\nRelated Images\n\nimage1.png\n\nimage2.png\n\nimage3.png\n\nimage4.png\n\nThis content was issued through the press release distribution service at Newswire.com.
