        "text": "Corner-notched and Basal-notched projectile point petroglyph images are found in the Coso Range of eastern California. These points are repeatedly depicted in association with composite animal-avian-human petroglyph figures. The points are also portrayed in singular or grouped images, and are most often illustrated as hafted configurations. We argue that these points are symbolic representations of Elko and Humboldt Series dart points dating from the Middle Archaic Period (2000 B.C. to A.D. 1) as represented in the southwestern corner of the Great Basin. Supporting this estimated age are direct measurements of rock art panels using experimental, pXRF (portable x-ray fluorescence measurements) of desert varnish (Lytle et al. 2008). The pXRF dates provide a mean age of 2,750 BP, with a sigma of 20% which calculates to a calendar age of about 3,300 to 2,200 years before present. We explore symbology surrounding animal-avian-human petroglyphs depicted with these types of dart points. Several alternative models help contextualize the petroglyph panels studied, illuminating implied cosmological content and visual metaphor, including gender. We suggest certain parallels and patterns that appear to connect Coso petroglyph panels with later cultures in the American Southwest and Mexico.\n\nA recently recorded Colorado Desert rock art site within the Palen-McCoy Wilderness, CA-RIV-12421, reflects a fascinating intersection between prehistoric and historic peoples. The vibrant petroglyph expressions include Western Archaic Tradition, Patayan, and equestrian motifs. The heaviest concentration of scratched motifs known in the Colorado Desert can be found here. Historic inscriptions are also present beginning in 1873, including that of O. P. Calloway and possibly the “infamous” land grafter John Benson. All tolled, CA-RIV-12421 provides a relatively high mixture of potential chronological markers. An attempt has been made to analyze the context of this site utilizing its environmental setting and the extant temporal clues available in the rock art. Findings of this investigation include a suggestion that much of this art was created in the Historic Period (ca. 1540-1774), with equestrian motif creation occurring between the early 1700s and 1873. The site’s geomorphology, ecological, and archaeological aspects, in conjunction with its high concentration of bighorn sheep petroglyphs, suggests that it may have functioned as a destination locality for spiritual and hunting purposes.\n\nAbstract The Harris Ranch petroglyphs, recorded as part of 41CX110, are a series of geometric designs pecked into the flat limestone bedrock adjacent to an intermittent creek in Crockett County, Texas. Site features include burned rock mounds, hearths, rock rings, cairns, mortar holes, and cupules, set on and adjacent to a huge outcrop of fine quality chert. The glyphs are primarily meandering lines and abstract designs with animal tracks, weaponry, and humans notable for their absence. The remarkable feature of the site is a series of 35 cm diameter cylindrical and conical holes around a low cairn that was laid between two deeper holes that now support large trees. Rectangular rocks were placed in, not on, several of these holes in prehistory, perhaps to support poles used in some ritual associated with glyph production or mortuary behavior.\n\nFormerly known as Black Mesa, Mesa Prieta is a unique and highly signiﬁcant cultural landscape in Northern New Mexico along the banks of the Rio Grande. With 60,000 petroglyphs recorded to date and tens of thousands presumed not yet documented, Mesa Prieta is in the same league as world-renowned rock art landmarks such as the Mojave Desert’s Coso Range. Surprisingly, however, very little recent professional attention has been given to this remarkable tableland and even less has been published about it. Research biases dismissing the Northern Rio Grande as a cultural backwater have contributed to this paucity of research and lack of published data. This article is intended as a brief report on the current state of recording, research, and interpretation of the mesa’s petroglyphs. By consolidating published and largely unpublished summary data, this report will assist those with avocational or scholarly interests in becoming more familiar with Mesa Prieta.\n\nWestern Basketmaker II style petroglyphs (Ca 1000 BCE to 450 CE), are found along the lower San Juan River, Little Colorado River, and Chinle Wash drainages of the Southwest, USA. They are affiliated with two cultural groups, (Group 1 and Group 2). The methodology involves a systematic analysis of proxemic and spatial context, body posture and gesture displays, superimposition sequences for temporal chronology and cultural associations by ethnographic analogy. Cultural diagnostics include cultural directionality, mythic iconography and cultural idioms specific to each language group. Superimposition sequences of BMII panels, show an earlier culture with assemblages of iconography nominated as ‘Group 1’, overlaid by a second assemblage of iconography nominated as ‘Group 2’. This paper addresses Group 1 iconography that finds its contemporary counterpart in myths and Katsinas, (masked and not masked) and altar paintings of the Keres language speakers.\n\nWestern Basketmaker II style petroglyphs (Ca 1000 BCE to 450 CE), found along the lower San Juan River, Colorado River into Grand Gulch, the Little Colorado River, and the Chinle Wash drainages including Canyon De Chelly can be shown through several lines of evidence to represent two cultural groups. The methodology involves a systematic analysis of proxemic (spatial) arrangements, body posture and gesture displays, superimposition sequences for temporal chronology and cultural associations by ethnographic analogy. Cultural diagnostics include cultural directionality, mythic iconography and cultural idioms specific to each language group. Superimposition sequences of Western BMII panels, show an earlier culture with assemblages of iconography nominated as ‘Group 1’, overlaid by a second assemblage of iconography nominated as ‘Group 2’. Group 1 iconography finds its contemporary counterpart in myths and Katsinas, (masked and not masked) and altar paintings of the Keres language speakers. The distribution of Group 1 iconography occurs along the San Juan River and exclusively along Little Colorado River drainages. Group 2 iconography finds its counterpart in the myths, duck shaped pots, Katsinas, masked and not masked, and altar paintings of the Zuni language speakers. Group 2 iconography co-exists with Group 1 on the San Juan River but is exclusive in the Chinle Wash drainages and in Canyon De Chelly.\n\nThe original of this paper was deleted due to contention over the photographs used in the illustrations. The photograph used in this revision of the paper, as well as the explanatory illustrations, are based solely on a photograph attributed to WvBailey. The photo of the petroglyph panel covers most of the glyphs found in the panel. The objective is to translate as much of the panel as possible so the reader may see the relationship, or lack of it, among the various glyphs. The translation is based on the ancient depicted sign language system. In re-processing this paper several errors in translation were discovered and corrected."
