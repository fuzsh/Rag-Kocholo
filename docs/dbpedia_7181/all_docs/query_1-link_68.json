        "text": "Petroglyphs are ancient carvings etched into the top layer of stone. People created them using stone chisels and hammerstones. Archaeologists have estimated there may be over 25,000 petroglyph images in Dinosaur National Monument.\n\nGet a glimpse into Utah’s ancient past and discover the lives of people who lived here thousands of years ago!\n\nOur state has some of the world’s best petroglyphs. And Dry Fork Canyon, one of the world’s most famous sites, is right here in Vernal!\n\nWant to see more? There are plenty of historical sites that you can visit across Utah.\n\nDry Fork Canyon Petroglyphs\n\nLocation: McConkie Ranch, just north of Vernal\n\nThe Dry Fork Canyon petroglyphs are famous for their quality and accessibility. These panels cover 200 feet of cliff face and date from 1000-1200 A.D. They are excellent examples of the Fremont Native American culture.\n\nThe petroglyphs are located on private land. Access is granted to those who treat the artwork with respect.\n\nMcConkie Ranch Petroglyphs\n\nAddress: 6228 McConkie Rd, Vernal, UT 84078, United States\n\nPhone: 435-789-6932\n\nDetails: Cultural Site. Free Admission. Donations accepted.\n\nHow close are the Petroglyphs to Dinosaurland?\n\nGetting to McConkie Ranch from Vernal, Utah, is easy:\n\nHead west on the 500 North.\n\nFollow this road for 3 miles.\n\nTurn right onto 3500 West.\n\nHead north for 4 miles.\n\nThe 3500 becomes Dry Fork Settlement Road.\n\nFollow this for another 2 miles.\n\nMcConkie Road is on your right.\n\nOther Petroglyph Sites Near Vernal, Utah\n\nDinosaur National Monument, near Vernal Utah, has many petroglyph sites. Here are some you can visit:\n\nMcKee Spring\n\nImage courtesy of Mark Byzewski\n\nMcKee Spring is one of Dinosaur National Monument’s best sites. It is easily accessible from the road, either by hiking or driving. However, the track becomes muddy in wet conditions and may be impassable.\n\nMcKee Spring is about 22 miles from the Dinosaur National Monument visitors’ center. The best way to get there is to go there, ask for directions, and find out if the conditions are suitable to go there.\n\nTilted Rocks\n\nTilted Rocks is home to many stunning petroglyphs. This includes the Swelter Shelter, a rock panel showing many animals, including snakes, birds, and lizards. The best way to see them is to go to the Quarry Visitor Center north of Jensen and then follow the scenic Cub Creek Road. Viewing some of the petroglyphs may involve a short, steep walk from your car. It’s a good idea to ask for the exact location of the petroglyphs at the visitor center.\n\nEcho Park\n\nImage courtesy of Matthew Dillon\n\nThe Echo Park area is home to many petroglyphs. Some are located on a ledge above the campground, others are at Pool Creek, and a few are across the Green River opposite the raft-launch site.\n\nThe last 13 miles on the road to Echo Park are unpaved roads. These roads are impassable when wet and steep in some places. A 4×4 is recommended. It’s also a good idea to speak to the folks at the Canyon Visitor Center about weather conditions before heading to Echo Park. You can contact them at (970) 374-3000.\n\nJones Hole Trail\n\nImage courtesy of Bruce Hope\n\nThe Jones Hole area is a scenic canyon with some of Dinosaur National Monument’s most impressive petroglyphs.\n\nThese petroglyphs can be found near Deluge Shelter, approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from the trailhead at the fish hatchery.\n\nOther Petroglyphs Sites in Utah\n\nVernal, Utah, is a great base from which to explore other ancient petroglyph sites across Utah.\n\nSome famous examples include:\n\nNewspaper Rock State Historic Monument, Canyonlands National Park\n\nLocation: Indian Creek Canyon, 53 miles south of Moab, just outside Canyonlands National Park\n\nNewspaper Rock is one of the largest known collections of petroglyphs in the United States. The rock panel is covered by hundreds of designs.\n\nIt’s called Newspaper Rock because its images depict past events like a newspaper. It also features carvings of deer, buffalo, pronghorn antelope, and riders on horseback.\n\nNewspaper Rock provided the ideal surface for petroglyphs thanks to its desert varnish. This is a dark coating on the rock created when manganese-iron deposits form on exposed sandstone cliffs over thousands of years.\n\nIndigenous people were able to chip away the desert varnish, revealing the lighter-colored rock underneath. This helped their designs stand out.\n\nCourthouse Wash, Arches National Park\n\nLocation: Near the junction of Courthouse Wash and the Colorado River, Arches National Park.\n\nThe Courthouse Wash doesn’t just have petroglyphs. It also features a series of ancient rock paintings known as pictographs. These images show a range of figures, some measuring up to 5 feet in height.\n\nThe painted figures are thought to have been created by the Fremont people and are between 1,500 and 4,000 years old.\n\nTo reach the site, follow the trail half a mile from U.S. 191 northeast of Moab. Sadly, the site was once vandalized, but it has since been restored. These sites are to be visited with respect.\n\nSand Island Petroglyph Panel, Bears Ears Monument\n\nLocation: Bears Ears National Monument, Southeastern Utah\n\nBears Ears National Monument features many examples of Anasazi petroglyphs. Some of the most impressive ones can be seen on the Sand Island Petroglyphs Panel.\n\nThe rock features over 100 years of designs that are thought to be between 300 to 3,000 years old.\n\nIt is thought that the panel held special significance to the people who created it, and it could have been an ancient gathering place.\n\nThe main petroglyph panel is located near the Sand Island Campground which has restrooms, camping sites, a seasonal ranger station, a boat launch, and seasonal drinking water.\n\nSand Island is just off Highway 191. At the bottom of the hill leading up to Sand Island, you will see a sign directing you to the Petroglyph site to the right. Drive 0.2 miles to the parking lot near a chain-link fence. The petroglyphs are only a short walk away up a dirt path.\n\nEverything You Need to Know about Utah’s Petroglyphs\n\nThe ancient petroglyphs in and around Vernal, Utah, raise so many questions! Who created them? How? And why? In this section, we answer these questions and more.\n\nWho created the petroglyphs?\n\nThe Indigenous Fremont people created most of Utah’s petroglyphs thousands of years ago. Their culture revolved around farming and they lived in the state between 800 and 1,500 years ago. Many examples of their art, culture, and society still exist today.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t just the Fremont people who created rock art in Utah. Others include:\n\nOther ancient cultures: Some petroglyphs and pictographs in southern Utah were created by another farming group called the Anasazi. They lived in southern Utah 700 years ago. Other indigenous people behind these petroglyphs include the Ute, Paiute, Shoshone, and Goshute.\n\nEuropean settlers: More recent inscriptions were made by European explorers, trappers, pioneers, and freighters.\n\nPrehistoric cultures: Some petroglyphs are many thousands of years old. One in the Moab area is thought to represent mammoths and may have been created by Ice Age artists over 10,000 years ago!\n\nWhat do the petroglyphs show?\n\nUtah’s petroglyphs show a wide range of animals, symbols, and humans.\n\nThe inscriptions give us an exciting glimpse into how Utah’s ancient people lived. The petroglyphs show people wearing elaborate face paint, jewelry, and clothing. They also have a variety of different hairstyles.\n\nSome figures are shown holding shields, spears, or bows and arrows—suggesting that these people hunted and even went to war.\n\nMany animals are shown too, including bighorn sheep, grizzly bears, rattlesnakes, buffalo, deer, elk, birds, scorpions, lizards, coyotes, and dogs.\n\nWhy did ancient people create petroglyphs?\n\nNo one knows for sure! Petroglyphs were probably created for a variety of reasons. Some theories include:\n\nTelling stories or depicting myths\n\nProviding instructions for hunting or growing crops\n\nMaps and directions\n\nPlaying games or counting\n\nWriting\n\nDecoration\n\nDoodling\n\nSome even think they may have originated when people sharpened tools against the rock!\n\nWhat is the difference between a pictograph and a petroglyph?\n\nPictographs are prehistoric drawings created by painting on the top layer of the rock. They are different to petroglyphs, which are created by removing the top layer of rock.\n\nPictographs are more delicate and vulnerable to being weathered away. This makes them rarer and they are typically found only in caves or other places protected from the elements.\n\nTogether, these ancient art techniques are known as petrographs.\n\nHow do we know how old petroglyphs are?\n\nThere’s no way to be certain. However, the images themselves give us some clues.\n\nWe know some tools, weapons, and even animals were not in the area before a certain date. For example, we know that horses weren’t introduced to North America until Europeans arrived. Images showing horses must therefore be relatively recent in comparison to others.\n\nPetroglyphs showing a bow and arrow, on the other hand, could be up to 2,000 years old.\n\nHelp Protect Utah’s Petroglyphs\n\nPetroglyphs and pictographs are very fragile, so it’s important not to do anything that could damage it.\n\nWhen visiting petroglyphs remember:\n\nLook closely\n\nTake photos\n\nDon’t touch them\n\nDon’t draw on the rock\n\nDon’t try to take rubbings or make a mold of the petroglyphs\n\nDo not cut into or try to remove the art\n\nDon’t make fires nearby\n\nLeave nothing behind\n\nTake your rubbish with you\n\nTouching the art may seem harmless, but if thousands of people do this over many years, it will eventually wear away or discolor. If this happens, then it will be lost forever.\n\nUnfortunately, some damage to the petroglyphs happened because of vandalism. It is a federal offense to deface, damage, or remove any part of the petroglyphs.\n\nDiscover Vernal’s Petroglyphs\n\nPetroglyphs allow you to step into Utah’s ancient past. No visit to Dinosaurland is complete without visiting one of these fascinating sites."
