        "text": "Archaeology Southwest\n\nArchaeology Southwest practices a holistic, conservation-based approach to exploring the past and advocates for the protection and preservation of threatened and vulnerable archaeological sites and resources. As part of our efforts to inform our visitors about southwestern archaeology, we sell copies of the organization’s magazine in our museum store, offer lectures presented by their team of archaeologists and research associates and consult on local research as it pertains to the preserve and surrounding areas.\n\nCanyon Records\n\nOur relationship with Canyon Records began in 2017. Since that time, Canyon has worked with us to promote contemporary Native American cultural and heritage at the preserve. Our unique setting provides us with opportunities to explore the past and make connections to the present using various cultural expressions, such as music, dance, poetry and song.\n\nAgents Of Discovery\n\nAgents of Discovery is a digital education technology platform that features a web-based dashboard where educators turn their educational content into augmented reality games or using their own, customized materials. Learners can then access the ‘gamified’ content through the free Agents of Discovery app on a smartphone or tablet. Instead of taking players “inside the internet,” educators can engage learners with the real world through three-dimensional augmented reality.\n\nOsher Lifelong Learning Institute\n\nWe develop themed lecture classes with OLLI at ASU offered at the preserve specializing in cross-disciplinary topics including life sciences, archeology, anthropology and global health. Our courses are led by faculty and graduate students at ASU and are run in the fall semester of every year. Membership in OLLI is offered to 50+ citizens which includes a number of benefits.\n\nS'edav Va'aki Museum\n\nThe S'edav Va'aki Museum is recognized as the gateway to the cultural history of the Phoenix area. In collaboration with local communities, they create memorable experiences that link past to present. ​To honor the site of S'edav Va'aki Museum as a unique community resource through sound preservation practices, engaging educational programs, and the thoughtful care and presentation of cultural materials. For all audiences, S'edav Va'aki Museum​ fosters understanding, appreciation, and respect for our shared cultural history.​​"
