From its founding in 1897 to 1931 when it merged with erstwhile rival record label Columbia to form EMI, The Gramophone Company was one of the was one largest record companies in the world, producing and releasing era defining recordings from all corners of the world.

We are proud to host the most extensive database of the 78rpm format records released by The Gramophone Company and EMI from the end of the 19th century to the mid-1950s. This remarkable database of over 430,000 recordings is derived from lists assembled by the late Dr. Alan Kelly to whom we are immensely grateful for his work and kindness in sharing this treasure trove with the EMI Archive Trust.
