        "text": "Around 1000 years.\n\nWhen stored undisturbed for a very long time, vinyl disks will deform slightly, but there would be no mechanical deterioration of the surface. This will may make the sound terrible, but it still be \"understandable\".\n\nThe main limiting factor would be longevity of PVC which is what vinyl disks are made of.\n\nUsing a laser stylus from a company like this, the records will be readable for centuries, if not millennia.\n\nLaser Advantage Because there is no contact, the laser reproduces without any distortion. The laser picks up all of the audio signals in the groove, lower signal through higher as it is. This results in laser sound quality that is quite similar to the original sound in the recording's master tape. Most of people never get to hear the master tapes, but with the Laser Turntable, you get comparable quality, as acknowledged by Professional Sound Recording Engineers in Japan.\n\nNo Contact and No Wear The same audio information has been engraved on the groove wall from the top through the bottom. A stylus reads audio information close to the bottom. The laser reads audio information close to the top. Namely the laser reads audio information which never been read by a stylus, without any contact and without any digitization or audio compression.\n\nhttps://www.elpj.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LT-classic.jpg\n\nSince one inch (2.5 cm) of grove record approximately one second of audio, degradation over millimeter sections will result in only millisecond aberrations in the sound. It is not like a DVD, where very small areas of local damage can cause severe glitches in audio.\n\nSince the analog signal on a record track maps the frequency exactly, with the eventual degradation of the PVC, it will be the high end frequencies that are lost first. The lower frequencies will remain intact. That is, unlike digital, there is always information that can be retrieved from all sections of the grove, even if it is damaged, until the track is totally destroyed. With digital, ALL information is lost in a sector if ANY information is lost, on most players."
