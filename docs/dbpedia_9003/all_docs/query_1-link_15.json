        "text": "The Daily Herald was a British national newspaper published between 1912 and 1964. At one point, it was the top-selling newspaper in the world, with a monthly circulation of more than 2 million.\n\nEvery photograph and negative taken for the newspaper was stored in a picture library, categorised and filed for easy access should they ever be needed again. This amazing collection—comprising 3.5 million photographs, contact sheets and glass negatives—is the Daily Herald Archive, which we now care for at the National Science and Media Museum here in Bradford.\n\nThis story is based on a selection of images from the archive.\n\nRecording in wax\n\nThe first step in making a record involved preparing the recording medium: plate-sized wax discs known as ‘blanks’.\n\nContinuously filtered in large vats at the record factory to ensure it stayed bubble-free, liquid wax was poured into circular moulds to cool and harden, and then turned on a lathe to ensure a perfectly smooth surface. Imperfections could spoil a recording!\n\nOnce the carefully packed discs arrived at the recording studio, technicians placed the wax blank on a turntable. As the turntable spun it also moved sideways under the ‘cutting head’, the stylus slicing a groove into the wax from the outer edge toward the centre.\n\nThe turntable spun at a standard 78 rotations per minute (RPM)—at least in theory—to create recordings of about 3 minutes per side. This is how early gramophone records came to be nicknamed ‘78s’.\n\nOnce cut, the wax discs—now ‘masters’—were returned to the record factory for inspection and processing. In the photo below, we can see two technicians carefully inspecting the grooves of the wax master to ensure the absence of obvious flaws that might spoil the recording.\n\nMaking stamps\n\nWax masters were ‘positive’ recordings, meaning that their grooves were suitable for reproducing the recorded sound. The problem was that the wax was delicate; running a stylus over the groove could ruin the recording.\n\nThe solution? Create a ‘negative’ or mirror image of the grooves that could be used to stamp the recording into a more robust material for playback.\n\nWax masters were dusted with graphite (a conductor) and then submerged in a bath of copper sulphate and sulphuric acid for several hours. This ‘electrolysis’ process built up a layer of metal on the outside of the wax master, aptly called a ‘shell’. The result was a copper negative with ridges that could be used to stamp grooves into a record.\n\nTo help ensure the longevity of the stamp, the copper was plated with nickel and a heavy steel backing was affixed to each stamp.\n\nOnce the metal stamp was ready, the wax master’s job was finished: it could be planed down and shipped back to the studio for another round of recording.\n\nThe photos featured in this story date from 1925 to the early 1940s. From its introduction at the turn of the century to the advent of vinyl and ‘long play’ (LP) records in the 1940s, little changed in the record making process. Indeed, Berliner’s gramophone technology is recognisable in the manufacture of records even in the 21st century.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean there weren’t innovations along the way!\n\nFlexible records\n\nFilmophone Flexible Records were flexible cellulose discs that, like a standard gramophone record, were 10 inches in diameter, double-sided, and designed for playback at 78 RPM.\n\nUnlike brittle shellac records that might shatter if dropped, Filmophones were quick and cheap to produce. Unfortunately, each record could only be played about a dozen times before wearing out. Though Filmophone released nearly 400 titles between 1931 and 1932, very few of these delicate discs survive to the present.\n\nLacquer discs\n\nIn 1934, blank lacquer-coated discs hit the market and created new possibilities for sharing sound. In principle, lacquer discs worked like a wax blank, but the more robust medium enabled playback without certain destruction of the recording (though the recordings, admittedly, didn’t last forever).\n\nCommercial versions of lacquer discs were widely adopted by broadcasters and in the mastering process of recording studios. And for DIYers, the availability of blank discs for personal use offered exciting new possibilities for communication. The Daily Herald’s caption for the photograph below describes how ‘The latest method of sending Xmas greetings to friends abroad is to make permanent Gramophone records of your message at home or in a small London Studio equiped [sic] for that purpose’."
