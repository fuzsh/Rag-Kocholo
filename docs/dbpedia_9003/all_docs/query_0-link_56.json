        "text": "Introduction\n\nShellacs or 78s, also called coarse groove gramophone discs, were the main mass produced audio format of the first half of the 20th century. The shellac discs were pressed from a wax matrix that was made during a professional recording. Although individuals could not make recordings themselves, they were now able to listen to professional recordings of much better quality than those of the wax cylinders and discs.\n\nThe main difference between vinyl discs and 78rpm discs was due to the groove cutting technical capabilities. Thanks to electrical recording and the invention of new material, it was possible to burn discs with much smaller, closer grooves.\n\nIn 1948, Columbia Records marketed the first vinyl discs (or long playing records). These discs were no longer made out of shellac but from PVC. Several standards were released during the first years, the most common being the 33rpm long play and the 45rpm long play.\n\nTrademark gramophone\n\nThe Gramophone Co. trademark gramophone has become the standard image of an early record player as a result of the painting, His Master's Voice, by Francis Barraud. The painting portrays a dog, Nipper, listening with curiosity to the voice of his owner being reproduced by a gramophone. Barraud's iconic picture became the trademark of The Gramophone Company, later known as His Master's Voice. The trademark gramophone, more accurately called the 'No.5', represents an important step in the public's acceptance of the flat disc player as opposed to the earlier cylinder system. Its clockwork motor set a new standard in speed consistency, reliability and control. This was an improvement over the earlier, simpler mechanisms whose speed decreased more rapidly.\n\nPathéphone prototype\n\nPathéphone is a generic name for disc phonographs built from 1906 to the early 1930s by the Pathé Company, the most significant company of its kind in France at the time. These machines played sapphire discs, recorded vertically and needing a special diaphragm on which the needle was replaced by a sapphire. The Pathé Company worked out this recording technique, which was used mostly in France and in the United States, but was never able to compete successfully with the lateral recording technique in the international field. This item was offered as a gift to the French Speech archives by the Pathé Company. Its glass case was designed to allow people to see the double spring motor, the finest technology of the time. It was introduced and demonstrated in public gatherings, among these the matinées poétiques organised in 1911 by the Speech Archives, which recorded the great voices of the time. This enabled people to hear famous contemporary French poets reciting their own texts, such as Guillaume Appollinaire, who would die during World War I, a few years after being recorded by the Speech Archive.\n\nStradivox Phonograph\n\nThe Laberte et Magnié phonographs were luxury machines. Produced during the early 1930s, they were made of the kinds of fine and rare woods most often used for musical instruments like violins. Laberte and Magnié were famous instrument makers from Mirecourt, a village in the north of France well-known for this activity. All their phonographs were man-made and signed. They marketed their machines on the basis of their expertise and the quality of woods they used, which allowed their phonographs to have a better quality and louder sound. This Stradivox is a spring motor phonograph designed to be portable: it is shaped into a suitcase and contains hidden compartments to host the accessories: a needle box, a cleaning brush to rub the discs before playing, and places to stack the diaphragm and crank. This Stradivox was offered to the Musée de la parole et du geste (Speech and Gesture Museum) in 1931 and won the Grand Prize at the Colonial Exhibition that took place in Paris the same year."
