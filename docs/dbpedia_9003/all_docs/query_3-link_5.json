        "text": "Last Updated: June 17, 2024\n\nThe groove-type found on a Blue Note record offers a useful indication of the probable date of manufacture, and can help confirm or discount the status of a particular copy being an “original pressing”.\n\nResidual marks from the vinyl manufacturing process\n\nA record is made by compressing a heated vinyl biscuit between two metal stampers, one for each side. Each stamper is clamped in a press at several points around its edge, and braced in the centre by a large round metal die which fits through the stamper’s empty centre hole. The “deep groove” is the trench-like impression left behind in the vinyl at the join between the centre die and the stamper.\n\nAll Blue Note records manufactured at Plastylite before mid-1961 have a deep groove on both sides. The design of the deep groove die was modelled on the dies used in pressing shellac records. New pattern dies were introduced across the vinyl pressing industry, including in Autumn 1961 at the Plastylite plant, New Jersey. The new dies impression in the label area was a single “step” or ridge, described as no-DG.\n\nStampers for each side had their own independent pressing die. The old DG and new no-DG dies were functionally interchangeable, and coexisted for some four years between 1961 and 1965. In those years Blue Note pressings appeared with every combination of old and new dies, being selected at random by the press operator – both sides DG, both no-DG, DG on only one side or the other. The stock of old dies gradually dwindled, until the last remaining old deep groove die finally became worn out and discarded in late 1965.\n\nThe two types of groove are illustrated below:\n\nDeep Groove (DG) on Side One and no Deep Groove on Side Two.\n\nVarious theories have been put forward by collectors – the use of old dies for re-pressings, new dies for new original pressings, – but recollections of a Plastylite press operator in the early 60s (Larry C) was that type of die was of no significance: he merely used whichever came to hand.\n\nThe first pressing run of each Blue note title is associated with a particular groove combination, noted by Fred Cohen in his Guide to Blue Note Original Pressings. That schedule was compiled by Cohen in conjunction with “elite collectors” with extensive first hand knowledge of Blue Note original pressings, gained through a lifetime of collecting.\n\nThe groove combination assigned to the first pressing run depends on pressing being carried out on one press, with one pair of stampers affixed, typically, pressed over a number of working days. This would be consistent with around 4,000 records pressed for the original Blue Note release (my own estimate for early ’60s titles). In the event that anything interrupted a single first pressing run, e.g. a busted stamper, mounting a fresh stamper, on different press, using two presses, the identifying marks are hostage to difference which could invalidate the “first pressing” characteristic. There is evidence, from the changing position of the Plastylite P, that stampers were fabricated in batches, more than one stamper pair was sometimes used in pressing runs, which may have introduced a different groove combination from the Cohen classification.\n\nDate of recording, date of manufacture and date of release\n\nA study of all session and release dates for all titles shows on average, there was a ten month gap between the original recording session date (recorded on the tape box) and the month of release (according to Schwann Catalogues) . For some titles it was as little as 4-6 weeks, most often it was about 3 months, not uncommonly 6 – 9 months, and some titles waited several years. It is likely that the pressing of vinyl (expensive item) was only a month or two prior to release, and the groove pattern reflects what was current at the time of release, and not at the date of recording or inferred from the catalogue number sequence. When the labels were printed to accompany the first release is another unknown. Label designs changed.\n\nThe best indicator of the date of manufacture (after 1962) is which of the nine patterns of inner sleeve the record was packed with. Before those dates, there is a degree of uncertainty.\n\nBeware the DG hype\n\nBecause DG dies continued in use at Plastylite until 1965, there are anomalies where the original pressing is no deep groove, and a subsequent repressing appears with deep groove, merely by chance. Deep Groove is definitive only for releases before 1961, and even then, there were many repressings within the deep groove era.\n\nConsult Fred Cohen’s book on identifying first pressings for specific details on all mono releases by Blue Note Records (note, Fred has changed his judgement on a few since publication).\n\nThe presence or absence of deep groove is not a guarantee of superior audio performance, which is impacted by many other factors. Early pressings with DG suffered more wear and tear over the years. Second and subsequent pressings by Plastylite possibly not DG still employed stampers derived from the same intermediate Van Gelder metalwork, and still sound distinctively “Blue Note”, and are often in better condition. However, sentiment still holds sway over many collectors: they want a piece of history, they want the original.\n\nHow vinyl records were made\n\nTo better understand the phenomenon of deep groove, see the LJC Slackers Guide to making records below and gain “Instant Expert” Status.\n\nLJC ” Expert in Thirty Seconds” Slacker’s Guide to making records\n\nIn only 30 seconds, everything you need to know to become an authority, shaving 30 seconds off the previous instant expert record of the One Minute Manager\n\nStep One – from music to stamper\n\nMusic is cut onto a master laquer by lathe. All that important information (catalogue number, master engineer signature) stamped or written is here on the runout area of the soft laquer. Mother/stamper positive/negative metal parts are created. The stamper central area is punched out. Printed paper labels are trimmed and center-punched ready for use.\n\nStep Two – from stamper to finished record\n\nHot vinyl biscuit is sandwiched by labels, and mounted between a side A and side B stamper. Ensuring the labels were bone dry was critical at this point, as any moisture converts to steam during pressing. The press applies 100 tons pressure to the biscuit at a temperature near 200 C for 30 seconds, pressing the grooves from the stamper image into the vinyl. As the press lifts away from the newly pressed record (bottom right) you see the indentation left behind in the central label area by the metal dies holding the stampers in the press. Deep Groove, or not Deep Groove, this is where it all happened.\n\nCongratulations.You are now a fully certified 30-second Vinyl Expert, saving nearly four minutes on watching the whole Discovery Channel You Tube.\n\nOrigins of Deep Groove\n\nThe deep groove has its origins in the pressing 78 r.p.m. records. The deep groove circle is just slightly smaller than the label of a 78, located within the label edge. As the recording and distribution medium switched from the breakable shellac 78 first to the 10″” and then 12″ unbreakable microgroove 33/1/3 LP, with its larger label, the deep groove was incorporated into the design of the new labels. Deep groove remained a feature during this period until pressing plants commissioning new presses to keep up with the expanding demand for vinyl records, phasing out the old presses, and with them, the older deep groove dies.\n\n(Thanks to Cristian for the info on 78 rpm)\n\nOther record labels and the Deep Groove\n\nDeep groove impression is found on many other record labels such as Riverside and Contemporary pressed around this time. There is not as much documented about how these fit into the chronology of other pressing plant processes as there is for Blue Note and the Plastylite vinyl pressing plant. Eight different types of pressing die grooves from late Fifties to early sixties, ranging from Plastylite-like on Contemporary, to deep pudding bowl on Verve\n\nAn example of more PPM – pressing plant mayhem – is this interesting “anomaly” on the Prestige label (photo courtesy of Albert of Ohio) of Coltrane’s 1958 recording Black Pearls, first released by Prestige in August 1964. Stereo copies of the original pressing exist with different label designs, one with deep groove, another with no deep groove.\n\nThese differences are almost certainly attributed to the spread of manufacture to different plants, who may also have been tasked to print labels locally, hence variations in typesetting, pressing dies, even the use of “out of date” designs. Whilst Blue Note used just one plant, Plastylite (plus one known exception), it became common for some labels to press at two or three plant location, some times contracting pressing to independents for cost advantage.\n\nAnyone with a more serious interest in the subject of pressing die indentations on record labels, I recommend to seek professional help. Or indeed amateur help, such as myself."
