        "text": "Brain Records was a German record label, which released many Krautrock bands like Jane , Gorilla , Klaus Schulze . Brain was formed by two formed by two ex-Ohr employees. The green Brains are partly to interest of collectors because of some great Krautrock presented on this label. The first release dates back to 1972. The Green label was replaced by a multicolour design in 1975.\n\nThe original 1st issues of the releases up to 1056 have the word \"metronome\" under the logo. The later series are a bit brighter coloured and do not have \"metronome\". With this design some of the first series are reissued. Most of the releases have gatefold sleeves.\n\nBrain also produced some Germany Heavy/Speed Metal bands like: Accept\n\nSee also the Metronome record label\n\nColumbia records was the \"Columbia\" label used for production and distribution of records in the USA.\n\nOutside the USA the records were distributed under the CBS logo.\n\nIn 1955, Columbia introduced the \"6 eye\" label. There are six camera/eye logos on the label, and the \"LP\" logo is at the bottom. This label continued on all (mono) pressings until 1962.\n\nIn 1958, stereo was introduced, and so a stereo version of the \"6 eye\" label was created. The prefix for standard stereo LP's was CS.\n\nThe 6 eye were arranged in sets of three opposite each other, along the outer edge of the label, at \"3 o'clock\" and \"9 o'clock\" as it were. The logos look like LP discs that have been squashed into ovals with two sick figure feet coming out of the bottom. These logos are referred to as \"eyes\" because they sort of resemble eyes. The \"pop\" records were red white and black. When browsing LP's for sale, a record collector who sees an item listed as a \"6-eye\" naturally assumes that this record was made in the 1950's or early 1960's. These records typically have a catalog number consisting of two letters followed by four numbers\n\nIn 1962, Columbia switched to the \"2 eye\" label, which lasted in one form or another until 1970. The first variety (1962-1963) featured the words \"Guaranteed High Fidelity\" at the bottom for mono LP's and \"360 Sound\" twice around the word \"STEREO\" at the bottom for stereo LP's.\n\nIn Fall, 1963, arrows were added to the stereo logo.\n\nIn 1963, the print on both mono and stereo copies -- for mainstream and Masterworks albums -- was changed to white, which contrasted better with the red (or gray) label.\n\nFrom the late '60's or early 1970's on, Columbia returned to a form of 6-eye style. This time the logos or eyes were repeated in a circle around the outside of the label (sometimes known as \"ringarounds\"), and in between each eye the word \"Columbia\" appeared. For pop records the background was red and the writing was also yellow (typically, though sometimes it was white or black). Most of these records have catalog numbers that consisted of a letter code followed by five numbers (eg: JC 35709)\n\nEarthshaker Records\n\nEarthshaker records was a German label formed by renowned Metal-scenester Axel Thubeauville .
