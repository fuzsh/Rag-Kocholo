        "text": "PHOTO: FACEBOOK.COM/CARLSOLWAYGALLERY\n\nBY STEVEN ROSEN /CINCINNATI CITYBEAT / JULY 6, 2020\n\nSeeing and talking to Carl Solway, who died on June 25 at age 85, were visits to a wise elder. His knowledge about Contemporary art and its ability to change a person for the better came from having had his own life changed by his experiences with some of the most important artists of his (and our) time.\n\nI quickly learned, writing about art for CityBeat starting in 2007, that not only was he a good source for any story, but he also often had first-hand experiences with the subjects of my stories. It wasn’t long before I was sometimes selecting stories because Solway knew the artist.\n\nAnd I was also doing stories that involved the imaginative ideas that Solway had had for improving our city and region through art. He thought big! For instance, when his Carl Solway Gallery in the West End had its Thanks: 50th Anniversary Celebration in 2012 (he opened his first gallery, Flair, with his first wife Gail in 1962), I was taken by a striking but odd 1990 drawing by Claes Oldenburg and his wife Coosje van Bruggen, “The Colossal Soap on the Ohio River.”\n\nNear it was “The Soap at Baton Rouge,” a cast resin worn bar of soap, part of a 250-edition multiple that Solway and Oldenburg produced in 1990. Asking Solway about these unearthed the quixotic tale of how he and Oldenburg — one of our greatest living artists, known for his large public sculptures of utilitarian objects (his wife died in 2009) — proposed to Procter & Gamble floating a perhaps-inflatable version of a giant soap bar down the Ohio River to celebrate Ivory soap’s 1979 centennial.\n\n“I said to Claes that it would be great to do some public art around it,” Solway said then. “What about the idea of doing a 400-foot inflatable bar of Ivory soap? You make a big inflatable balloon-like structure that you can blow up. It wouldn’t actually be real soap.”\n\nIt would, he explained, sit atop a barge that could guide it.\n\nThe idea didn’t get far beyond the two, but Solway tried again in 1983 after Christo wrapped 11 islands in Florida’s Biscayne Bay. And he couldn’t help but make a new pitch for it during our interview in 2012.\n\n“It would be fantastic if that could finally happen,” Solway said. “And now would be the time, following all the attention from the (then-fresh Cincinnati-staged) World Choir Games, to do something like this.”\n\nThat was what made Solway so special. He combined visionary ideas with a non-parochial, non-defensive civic pride that sought to joyfully elevate our culture. He wanted to work with the best artists possible, preferably on big projects, and he wanted to help the city by doing so.\n\nAs result of being a prestigious art dealer and one of some 180 members (in just 30 cities) of the Art Dealers Association of America, he had quick, easy access to those artists. For the story about the “Colossal Soap,” he provided me with a contact email for Oldenburg, who quickly replied to my inquiry: “To answer your question, if someone would have come up with the money and means to create the giant ‘Soap’ or its balloon double, of course Coosje and I would have responded, and given it a try. The impossible was always an inspiration to us.”\n\nAnother time, I discovered Solway had artwork by a 1960s Pop artist, the late Bob Stanley, whom I owned a print by but knew little about. The print was of an unidentified female singing group, and I had long wondered who it was. I told him that and within a few days he forwarded me an email from Stanley’s widow, Marylin, identifying it as The Shirelles and part of a set of Rock & Roll prints created in 1965. It’s now in our dining room, and I know who it is when people ask.\n\nSolway was a charismatic speaker; he was supportively professorial. He talked about Contemporary art with a relaxed smile and in an inviting, narratively unfolding way that was just plain friendly. As a result, he was very convincing.\n\nFor instance, in 1985 Solway arranged for the Cincinnati Art Museum to commission Andy Warhol to create a portrait of Pete Rose, because the Red was about to break Ty Cobb’s all-time hits record. But neither man, Rose nor Warhol, knew the other — it’s said neither even knew who the other was — and it was hard to get Rose to go to Warhol’s New York studio to have a reference photograph taken. As a result, Warhol based his portrait on an existing newspaper image by Cincinnati photographer Gordon Baer, and presented his finished work like four large baseball cards.\n\nI had not been predisposed to like the result much; there didn’t seem much artist-subject connection to the project. But in 2010, as part of the portrait’s 25th anniversary, I heard Solway explain why this is a significant artwork for Warhol. He had a gift for being able to emphasize what he believed was significant about a particular Contemporary artist or artwork.\n\n“It was so brilliant of Andy to make it into a baseball card,” he said. “And that’s so interesting because baseball cards are collectible and negotiable. So it was a statement about the commercialization of art, just like his soup cans are about the commercialization of branding.”\n\nHe made me see it a different way.\n\nThere is much else about Solway’s career and life that is memorable. He worked with such major names in Contemporary art (and creative thinking) as Buckminster Fuller, Richard Hamilton, Nam June Paik and, of course, Oldenburg. He advocated for more and better public art in Cincinnati — with Jack Boulton, starting a late-1960s mural project, Urban Walls.\n\nAnd while, like all gallerists, he operated a business and thus tried to sell its art, he did so with quality exhibitions. He also took pride in supporting women artists, including four who became MacArthur Foundation “genius grant” recipients: Judy Pfaff, Ann Hamilton, Aminah Robinson and Joan Snyder.\n\nPat Steir, another distinguished artist, presented a transcendent gallery show in 2008 — abstracted, Asian-influenced paintings of waterfalls. (The Cincinnati Art Museum bought one.) In 2010, when she returned to Cincinnati for a Contemporary Arts Center show, I had the chance to talk to her about Solway.\n\n“Carl goes deep into the art he works with,” she said. “He cares about the people, too — the art and the people as one. He goes for the groundbreaking, not the ordinary — I think that’s his true obsession. He’s a great person and a great friend.”\n\nI use the term Contemporary art to mean art of our time, often work by living artists attuned to changes in Post-World War II America. Solway once called the Pop artists, Minimalists and Conceptualists “my generation.” Yet he had started off emphasizing prints by Modern Masters, good but safe art for a developing regional market. He changed direction after meeting John Cage, the man he considered “the 20th century’s greatest artist.”\n\nThat’s kind of a remarkable statement, since Cage is primarily known as an avant-garde composer, although one influenced by Marcel Duchamp’s radical conceptualism. Cage’s most famous work is “4’ 33,” representing the amount of time that a musician “plays” an instrument by making no intentional sound whatsoever. It makes you hear music, or the lack of it, in a totally new way.\n\nIn the 1967-68 school year, Cincinnati arts patrons Alice and Harris Weston sponsored Cage’s stay at the University of Cincinnati’s College-Conservatory of Music as a composer-in-residence. And Cage would visit Solway’s Flair gallery and play chess with him.\n\n“We became friends,” Solway said in a 2010 CityBeat story that I wrote, and from which I have repurposed excerpts for this remembrance. “And John said to me one day, ‘What are you doing, showing all these people who are dead? Why aren’t you working with artists of your own times? Come to New York and I’ll introduce you to some of my friends.’ ”\n\nAt the same time, Alice Weston suggested Cage try his hand at visual art. Cage agreed — although he had never done it before — and Solway ended up publishing Cage’s “Not Wanting to Say Anything About Marcel,” a limited-edition tribute to the recently deceased Duchamp. It’s an important work, now in the collection of many art museums, including Cincinnati’s, because it so imaginatively encapsulates Cage’s belief in the liberating role of chance in art…and life.\n\nWorking off the fact the Chinese I Ching contains 64 hexagrams (oracular statements), Cage rolled dice and used the I Ching to devise an artwork that — in complete-set form — contained 64 silk-screened Plexiglas pieces, or “plexigrams,” with individualized word fragments and images. Solway published Cage’s “Marcel” in an edition of roughly 125 “objects.” (A single object contained eight plexigrams and two lithographs.)\n\n“That was a life-transformative experience for me, both in terms of my personal life and in terms of my career,” Solway said. “It was a wonderful project. I traveled all over Europe trying to sell it — (the objects) were selling for $200 apiece in those days.”\n\nIn the 1970s, the Carl Solway Gallery replaced Flair, he and his first wife divorced, and second wife Elizabeth (Lizi) became his gallery administrator for many years. At the time of his death, they had been married 42 years.\n\nIt is a bit strange to write about the importance of a career devoted to “art of the living” while knowing that refers to many who are now deceased. Now, Carl Solway is one of them. (His son Michael will continue operating the gallery.) But the fact that what once was so new is becoming history doesn’t diminish its importance. The art he championed was revolutionary, and everything new grows from it.\n\nI hope everyone realizes just how great a Cincinnatian Carl Solway was. His impact will live on.\n\n(Editor/writer’s note June 25, 2021: I wrote this interview with Ron Mael of Sparks year for Rock’s Back Pages, when it looked like 2020 was going to be the duo’s long-awaited “breakout” year. COVID-19 interfered with those plans, but so far it seems like 2021 might actually be the year that the Mael brothers and their fans have long awaited. — SR)\n\nBY STEVEN ROSEN / MAY 15, 2020\n\nWhen 2020 was still new, it looked to be The Year of Sparks, the beloved cult rock/pop band of brothers — Ron and Russell Mael — that have released 23 studio albums and numerous compilations since 1971. This year could still turn out that way, but COVID-19 has interfered.\n\nThe new studio album A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip was scheduled early on for May 15 release (digital at first; physical copies July 3), and Sparks began offering previews online. New songs like “One for the Ages,” “I’m Toast,” “Self-Effacing,” “Lawnmower” and “Please Don’t Fuck Up My World” showed Sparks still capable of their artful, quirky yet accessible pop songs enlivened by Russell’s theatrically expressive vocals and Ron’s expert keyboard work and lyrics emphasizing humorously sophisticated wordplay or just plainly spoken poignant truth.\n\nThat record is still coming out. But the Mael brothers also had announced a European tour with their supporting musicians for October — a prelude to a 2021 world tour. They also revealed that the long in-the-works movie for which they wrote the mostly-sung screenplay — Annette, by French auteurist director Leos Carax and starring Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard — was finished and ready for theatrical release. Further, they said, British director Edgar Wright’s (Shaun of the Dead, Baby Driver) feature-length documentary chronicling Sparks’ long career was quickly approaching completion.\n\nWhat a year to look forward to! But then, the pandemic arrived in Europe and the U.S. (and much of the rest of the world). Public entertainment, such as movie theaters and concerts, pretty much was halted everywhere. The Cannes Film Festival, where Annette was scheduled to appear, was an early casualty.\n\nDuring a recent telephone interview with Ron, ensconced in his L.A. home, he worried about whether the October tour could happen. And he displayed great anxiety about what the future might hold for Sparks if concerts return at some point with strict social distancing procedures in place. Sparks concerts have played a key role in giving the duo a raison d’etre for continuing. The shows are joyful celebratory events, a chance for close bonding among those devoted to Sparks’ unconventional musical aesthetic. Audiences also boisterously enjoy the brothers’ visual presentation, with the animated, exuberant Russell playing off the studiousness with which Ron plays keyboards, his Charlie Chaplin-ish mustache a longstanding trademark. When (and if) Ron breaks character and dances, everyone goes wild.\n\nThat friendly, lively rapport now is at risk. “I try not to dwell on it too much, but it’s so depressing,” Ron says. “It isn’t just a small thing for us. There are bands that don’t enjoy live concerts, but we love doing that. An album is almost an excuse for us to play live. In classical music there is shared experience, but it’s not quite as outwardly passionate as a rock concert or festival. There’s just no substitute for that.”\n\nAfter the Mael brothers started the band Halfnelson in L.A., producer Todd Rundgren took the five-member group to Albert Grossman’s Woodstock N.Y.-based Bearsville label. When a first album flopped, Grossman — tickled by the brothers’ humor and concerned that Halfnelson wasn’t a good name — suggested Sparks Brothers because it rhymed with Marx Brothers. They compromised on just Sparks. The first album was reissued credited to Sparks and a second album debuted in 1973. Still nothing.\n\nThe Mael brothers relocated to England hooked up with Island Records in time for the glam revolution and its love of music with the kind of arty, hip knowingness reflected in the title of that second album, A Woofer in Tweeter’s Clothing.\n\nTheir 1974 British hit (and their first masterpiece) “This Town Ain’t Big Enough for Both of Us” still sounds miraculous today, an operatic pop song with a jittery melodramatic melody, a veritable sound collage of special effects, authoritative rock-guitar licks and Russell’s acrobatic voice reaching high notes worthy of Maria Callas. Their accompanying album, Kimono My House, also was huge. After some further British success, Sparks moved back to L.A. The Mael brothers have continued to compose and record such much-admired songs, to an international following, as 1979’s “The Number One Song in Heaven,” 1980’s “When I’m With You,” 1994’s “When Do I Get to Sing ‘My Way,’ ” and 2017’s “Hippopotamus.” There have been some detours — Annette and the Swedish public radio musical The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman — but general they’ve stalwartly produced pop.\n\nA Steady Drip, Drip, Drip, their first studio album since 2017’s Hippopotamus, opens with what may be a surprise to some fans — a heartfelt and straightforwardly emotional composition, “All That.” With a lovely Beatlesque melody and arrangement, driven by acoustic guitar strumming, handclaps and choral vocal effects, Russell sings, “All that we’ve done/we’ve lost/we’ve won/all that, all that and more.”\n\nI asked Ron if this was a statement of purpose for the brothers, a vow of togetherness, considering he and Russell have been together as Sparks for almost 50 years. “I saw it less as an autobiographical thing,” he says. “We don’t have a lot of songs that are love songs, so I felt the challenge of trying to come up with something sincere but not achingly saccharin. I never thought about it as being anything about our working relationship. The two of us are not very sentimental when it comes to (that). We never speak about those things. Neither of us are introspective in those kinds of ways.”\n\nThe funny, charming “Self-Effacing” seems more conventionally Sparks-like. It appears a subtle self-referential put-on. After all, how can someone who publicly declares himself or herself “self-effacing” — in a song, no less — actually be so? It’s a contradiction, right?\n\n“You’re right,” Ron at first concedes. “If you were truly self-effacing, you wouldn’t be writing a 4-minute song about it.” But then he begs to politely differ. “But I also just like the idea, with so many songs in pop and rock being so macho and self-assured, of somebody stating so strongly that they’re not that. In general, and I’m sure there are exceptions, we try to be as sincere as possible about things, but because of the way things are phrased, they can come out as, ‘What are you guys really getting at?’ Sometimes we’re not really trying to get to something; things really can be taken at face value.”\n\nRon and Russell long have harbored hopes of being involved with movies. In the 1970s, the late French director Jacques Tati, a comedy master, wanted them to appear in his Confusion project as American television executives set loose on a television station in rural France. But the film never happened.\n\nThus, they are particularly proud that a film they wrote some eight years ago, Annette, has been completed. And during the process they seem to have maintained a good relationship with director Carax, whose past films include the critically acclaimed Holy Motors and Pola X. The director actually put in a guest appearance on Sparks’ Hippopotamus album, singing “When You’re a French Director.”\n\nRon hopes, given the Cannes cancellation, Annette can premiere at another prestige festival later this year, if such festivals can resume. “It’s a story about a standup comedian, a real shock guy played by Adam (Driver), and an opera singer played by Marion (Cotillard), and they have kind of an affair that is unlikely because of the discrepancy between their manners,” he says. “And they have — I can’t go into too many details — a child who has some special talents, and the child’s name is Annette.” (Set in Los Angeles, the movie mostly was filmed on sets in Brussels, with some scenes shot it Germany and L.A.)\n\n“It’s 95 percent sung,” Ron explains. “We actually wanted it all to be sung, but Leos felt some of the scenes could use normal dialogue even if just as a breather. But we’re really proud it’s basically sung from beginning to end.”\n\nOf that music, he says that there are “a lot of pieces you wouldn’t necessarily call pop songs, although there are some of those in it, but it’s more geared to that (pop) stylistically. The only pieces that aren’t occur because Marion is supposed to be an opera singer in the film, so when she’s on stage she’s performing our style of opera in front of audiences.”\n\nDriver, of course, received acclaim last year for singing Stephen Sondheim’s “Being Alive” as part of his Academy Award-nominated performance in Marriage Story. So he’s going from Sondheim to Sparks. “A lot of times you almost forget he’s singing — it just sounds like Adam Driver acting, but within a musical context,” Ron says. “People really will be surprised. It’s one thing to sing one song, but to do it for 2 hours and 20 minutes, that’s different.”\n\nMeanwhile, there is now a completed three-hour edit of the Sparks documentary that Edgar Wright has been working on. He wanted Ron and Russell to come to London and see it in a theater for the first showing, but they had to cancel once the pandemic struck. “He really likes it, but the plan is to also have a theatrical release,” Ron says. “So he’s trying to figure out how to get down to a two-hour version. We’d prefer to see it for the first time in a theater setting, rather than getting a link to watch it on computer. But if this goes on too much longer, we might have to do it that way.” (They have seen individual sections of the film.)\n\nThe Mael brothers think Wright is the right person to make a Sparks documentary. “We’ve had offers in the past to have documentaries done about Sparks and we always turned them down,” Ron says. “But when Edgar approached us we said yes immediately because of our respect for him as a director. He really understood what we’re all about and also has the energy and maybe even the discretion to try to maintain a certain amount of mystique about the band.”\n\nWright’s plan is to give equal weight to all phases of Sparks’ career. That fits Ron’s vision. “We didn’t want it to just be a nostalgic look,” he says. To highlight the present, Wright accompanied Sparks last year to shows in Los Angeles, London, Tokyo and Mexico City. “He feels what we’re doing now is as strong as anything we’ve ever done, so he wanted to make sure there is a balance to the whole thing,” Ron says.\n\nStill, Sparks do have a long, colorful career that the film will explore. “He has very capable people working for him and they’re able to get footage we wouldn’t have been able to,” Ron says. “It’s a treat for us in a way. Some of it is slightly embarrassing but also kind of cool, old cooking shows in England in the 70s and all.”\n\nRon sees A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip as continuation — an advancement, actually — of Sparks’ vision of popular music as capable of having a commercially conventional structure, a fun danceable Big Beat (to quote a previous album’s title), and also be taken seriously for its unpretentious but not accidental artfulness.\n\nSparks records have been guided by that unifying belief since 1971, and there’s no planned change now even if Ron is 74, Russell is 71 and they’ve just written a movie musical of sorts.\n\n“We think we can be as meaningful in pop music as in any other genre,” Ron says. “That’s why when we’re working on film and go back to working on an album, it’s always exciting for us to see how far we can continue to take that. That’s our first love — pop music. We like seeing what can be done with it that remains within the general area of pop music but is something very, very special. We’re always pleased whenever people notice that at least we’re trying.”\n\n(Photo of new record album from Allsparks.com website)\n\n(Photo of illustration of Johnny Appleseed from Wikimedia Commons)\n\nBY STEVEN ROSEN/CINCINNATI ENQUIRER/2012\n\n(Writer’s note 4/23/20: Today, the Enquirer reported that Urbana University — which became a campus of Franklin University in 2014 — will shutter for good due to financial problems. In 2012, I visited the lovely small town campus to write about its unusual Johnny Appleseed Museum. I hope it survives in some form, ideally at its existing location.)\n\nIt is fitting that Florence Murdoch is buried at Spring Grove Cemetery, since it is home to a lovely statue honoring Johnny Appleseed. For Murdoch, who died in 1977 at the age of 90, was such a devoted protector and defender of Appleseed’s legacy that some think she funded the statue.\n\nShe didn’t, but without her gift the Johnny Appleseed Educational Center and Museum in Urbana, about 40 miles northeast of Dayton, would be severely devoid of information and artifacts. The museum, on the campus of Urbana University has the world’s largest collection of items related to Chapman. And authors writing about Appleseed would find it much more difficult to search information.\n\nWhile Appleseed is one of the great American folk heroes, like John Henry and Paul Bunyan, his legend is actually based on the life, times and exploits of a true person. John Chapman, who lived from 1774-1845, was a nurseryman who traveled this region saving apple seeds and planting trees to help residents of the still-rugged frontier find shade and sustenance from the land.\n\nHe was born in Massachusetts and traveled Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana before his death in Fort Wayne. Through time and storytelling, he came to be portrayed as a mythical itinerant figure that walked the land barefoot and wore an upside-down pot as headgear.\n\nHe was also a missionary with the Swedenborg church, founded by followers of 18th Century Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg, who claimed to have been directed by God to reform and update Christianity. A key church belief was that angels are real. Chapman traveled to Swedenborg meetings in Cincinnati in the 19th Century, as the church had made Cincinnati a Midwest center. (Urbana College is a Swedenborgian-founded university.)\n\nAnd as a member of Cincinnati’s Swedenborg Church of the New Jerusalem as well as its librarian, Murdoch fiercely collected and preserved material related to Chapman, and advocated on his behalf. She had a personal connection – he stayed with her great-uncle, Milo Williams. (She grew up in Urbana.)\n\n“She became known as the keeper of the Johnny Appleseed collection,” says Joseph Besecker, director of Urbana University’s Johnny Appleseed Society. “People sent her things they felt were worthwhile to save.” When the church, at the corner of Oak Street and Winslow Avenue, was demolished for Interstate 71 in the 1970s, all of Murdoch’s collection was donated to Urbana. (The church’s Tiffany-designed stained-glass windows, also preserved, were displayed this year at Taft Museum.)\n\nMurdoch, who lived in Clifton and never married, held powerful sway in her church. In Carol Skinner Lawson’s short 1999 memoir of the Church of New Jerusalem, It’s Not in Buildings, she remembers the older Murdoch as “a pear-shaped lady of great determination (who) used her snapping black eyes to underscore her opinions.” She also says Murdoch was “a watercolorist who specialized in tiny florets, which she observed through a 30-power microscope as she pained the enlargements.”\n\nMary Ann Fischer, who today is keeper of the church’s records (the congregation no longer has a building) says she has heard colorful stories about Murdoch from members. “Florence had a great big trunk and traveled through Europe sell her stuff. She did that rather than having a coming-out party, because she did have a family with money.” She also helped the state purchase Cedar Bog nature preserve in Urbana.\n\nThe “definitive” biography of Appleseed, in Besecker’s estimation, would never have come about without Murdoch. The museum has bound copies of letters between her and Robert Price, an Otterbein College professor who wrote Johnny Appleseed: Man and Myth, that go back years before he finally published in 1954. (The book has been republished three times since, most recently last year by Urbana University.) Price’s book was groundbreaking in locating the actual properties that Appleseed owned and/or was active. He relied on her information and contacts. “As you look through the letters, it’s clear how much she helped,” Besecker says. “He gave her credit, but didn’t give her enough. He did the legwork, but she saved him a lot of trips by telling him where to go.”\n\nThe museum separates the history from legend concerning Chapman’s life, while celebrating both. It is inside the oldest building at Urbana University, the 1850 Bailey Hall. The historic building had been closed and slated for demolition before concerned faculty and trustees put the Appleseed museum there in 1999.\n\nAfter a $1.6 million renovation to stabilize Bailey Hall, and a $75,000 remodeling of the museum space, the museum at Urbana University now has a bright, cheerful, modernized space. The gallery has one wall lined with book cabinets and an apple-shaped table for children. There are graphics repeating quotes about Chapman from the likes of General William Sherman, Sam Houston and Chapman, himself. In an entry room, there is a small gift-shop area with items ranging from books and photo reproductions to apple earrings and glass apples.\n\nSome display items are pop-cultural – you can hear songs about Appleseed by Bing Crosby and Gene Autry; there’s a case full of Appleseed figurines. And there are offbeat ephemera – a fire department patch, depicting an apple, from Chapman’s birthplace of Leominster, Mass. Some items are historic. The museum owns the cedar apple press that belonged to an Urbana resident, John James, whose trees were planted by Chapman and who gave his land to create the school.\n\nAnd for those doing library research, there is invaluable information on how he has been remembered throughout American and Ohio history. That includes files on Ohio’s now-forgotten Appleseed Highway, which followed existing state routes from the Ohio River in the southeast to Toledo and was planted with crabapple trees. The museum would like to replant and rededicate that highway.\n\nIt was Murdoch’s attempt to protect Chapman’s reputation that is responsible for one of the museum’s most fascinating artifacts – correspondence between her and Walt Disney Studios relating to its 1948 animated movie, “Melody Time.” These are framed and occupy choice display space. The film, which combined storytelling with American popular music, featured a segment on “The Legend of Johnny Appleseed,” (The character was voiced by a singer of the era, Dennis Day.)\n\nMurdoch had only seen an ad for it when she wrote to Disney, on May 26, 1948, to complain that the animated Appleseed is shown with the “extraordinarily grotesque figure of a ‘guardian angel.” She requested it be changed to a child or the “spirit of the frontier.”\n\nLess than a month later, she received a reply from Hal Aldequist, manager of Disney’s Story Department, that showed how seriously the company took her complaint. “We trust that after you have viewed the picture you will agree that we have treated the angel with a sincere respect and endowed him with a certain dignity,” he wrote. Aldequist goes on to argue that Chapman believed in “the direct physical manifestation of heavenly beings upon this earth.”\n\nMurdoch did see and enjoy the film, and wrote back to say so. But she waited until 1955 to do it. That letter, and so much more concerning Johnny Appleseed, is on display at this museum.\n\nMORE INFORMATION: urbana.edu/about-us/community/johnny-appleseed-education-center-and-museum\n\n(photo of Alex Chilton graced the cover of Holly George-Warren’s biography of him, A Man Called Destruction.)\n\nBY STEVEN ROSEN / SONIC BOOMERS / 2010\n\nThe respect shown to Alex Chilton upon his recent death — from the press, blogs, fellow musicians, South by Southwest attendees, the pop world in general — revealed just how well-loved his work with the band Big Star had become.\n\nNot that Chilton, who was just 59 when he succumbed to a heart attack in March, had done nothing besides sing/compose/play guitar for the short-lived Big Star. He had been the teenage lead singer with the Box Tops previously, had a long and varied (and controversial) career as a solo artist after Big Star, and even occasionally played and recorded with an updated Big Star II from the early 1990s onward.\n\nBut it was the two albums that the youthful Memphis band Big Star put out on Ardent Records (and recorded at Ardent Studios) in 1972 and 1974 that are considered his classic, most enduring work. More, they’re considered rock classics, period — game-changers that pointed the way out of album-rock’s virtuosic excess and toward sometimes-quietly introspective, sometimes-celebratory, always-tuneful and intelligent alternative rock.\n\nThey also showed at times an intimately disquieting, disaffected edge that rejected the braggadocio of the era’s strutting big stars in favor of the more intimate, maybe more melancholy, work of the Beatles of “Norwegian Wood” or “You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away.” (A third album bearing the Big Star name, but recorded under different conditions and with a different spirit, came out in 1978 after the band had ceased to exist.)\n\nThe band’s legacy has now outlived Chilton, just as it has the band’s originator and co-writer/singer (on the first album), Chris Bell, who left before “Radio City” and died in 1978. And it seems a safe bet it will keep on lasting — “Keep an Eye on the Sky,” a four-disc retrospective with a variety of previously unreleased material, came out just last year.\n\nBut Big Star’s ongoing power isn’t the result of the strong sales or radio play that accompanied 1972’s “#1 Record” and 1974’s “Radio City,” despite their deceptive titles. Both were ignored in the marketplace — partly because of problems that Ardent’s parent company, Stax Records, had with its national distributor, Columbia Records.\n\nRather, the Big Star legacy is due to something that now seems quaint and even endangered in this Internet/download/“American Idol” age — the power of the print press, especially music critics, to champion and call attention to a band’s music at the time of its initial release. They made Big Star stand out — and while it took time, eventually the world noticed, especially other musicians who found themselves attracted to the same unpretentious values.\n\nIn Big Star’s case, the initial press came as the result of an extraordinary one-of-a-kind event that once seemed comical but, as time passes, can now be seen as extraordinarily prescient. It was the convention of the National Association of Rock Writers, sponsored by Ardent and held in Memphis over Memorial Day weekend in 1973.\n\nMore than 100 — some sources say as many as 175 — rock writers descended on Memphis from all over the U.S. (and England) for the event. Among those who attended were Richard Meltzer, Lester Bangs, Lenny Kaye, Bud Scoppa and a teenage Cameron Crowe. On the final night, a three-piece Big Star closed a multi-act concert and wowed the attendees, resulting in many loyal champions and good press when their album “Radio City” came out the next year.\n\nThe “comical” aspect was due to the fact that rock-writing was not a highly evolved “profession” at the time and a lot of the people who came didn’t have much money. That meant they were eager for the free food and drink made available by Ardent. (According to anecdotal reports, the writers angered Memphis hookers because – unlike other conventioneers – they had no spending money.)\n\nBut some of the historical accounts make it seem like freeloading was all they were interested in. There was more to it than that – there was even hope of starting a union. “The context of the time was that music criticism was not taken seriously by mainstream anything,” recalls Billy Altman, who attended from State University of New York — Buffalo, where he had started an irreverent fanzine called Punk that had put the 1960s garage band the Seeds on its cover. “Nobody outside our little community thought anything we did had any validity. So what we were doing was to at least validate our own existence.”\n\nIn retrospect, with Big Star they did. But it took time for the word to get out. “I felt after that convention that it wasn’t happening — rock critics were really powerless,” recalls Jon Tiven, who had started New Haven Rock Press and had become a writer for several national music magazines while still attending college. He had helped organize the convention at Ardent’s request. “Here we had Big Star and all the critics liked them, but rock writers didn’t have impact at all and it was very frustrating. But I proved myself wrong,” Tiven says.\n\n(As an aside, I supervised the pop-music section of the Harvard Coop’s record store when “Radio City” came out and remember featuring and promoting “Radio City” because of its great press. I also tried to order in “#1 Record” but Columbia Records — Ardent/Stax’s distributor — wouldn’t fill requests. So I know first-hand how crippled the band was by distribution problems. I also saw them play the Performance Center in Cambridge on a short tour supporting “Radio City” and opening for Badfinger, although only Chilton and drummer Jody Stephens from the original line-up were left. I can attest they were indeed magical live.)\n\nJohn King III, the Ardent promotion manager who was close friends with head of Ardent Records/Ardent Studios John Fry, came up with the idea for the convention based on the good reviews “#1 Record” had received in the still-small rock press. The two believed in Big Star. But with Bell gone, Chilton, Stephens and bassist Andy Hummel were struggling to stay together. They’d recorded a few new songs but were undecided.\n\n“I wanted Big Star to stay together and have a venue where these writers who really seemed to like them a lot could come into town and see them,” King recalls. “I had hero worship. Here were these guys who were passionate about music, while sometimes I was more passionate about the business. So I had a fascination with their magazines. And at that time, I really did hope an association could be formed from the meeting because these people weren’t getting paid.”\n\nIf the convention was dreamed up by King as a way to showcase Big Star, it became something more in order to get Stax approval. Primarily a soul-music label, Stax had signed a journeyman British rock band called Skin Alley and saw the event as a way to announce its intentions to move into rock. (Skin Alley’s presence helped lure the British press.) Another act on Ardent, Larry Raspberry and the Highsteppers, were soulful rockers with a volatile live act, fronted by the former lead singer of the Gentrys (“Keep on Dancing”). They were beloved by Stax co-head Jim Stewart.\n\nBy setting up a convention-ending show at a venue called Lafayette’s Music Room in Overton Square – featuring Don Nix (a Southern-rock singer-songwriter who was on Stax’s Enterprise label), Skin Alley, Raspberry and finally Big Star – King guaranteed funding from Stax. “That’s how the Rock Writers Convention squeaked through in getting approval,” King says. He estimates it cost Stax about $100,000. “That was a substantial sum, but I tried to protect Stax too, from things like long-distance calls from hotel rooms, without being a chintz ass,” he says.\n\nKing turned to Tiven for help because he was among the first to herald “#1 Record.” His story on it appeared in Boston’s Fusion magazine, a rival to Rolling Stone, and was teased on the cover. “I remember how many thousands of Fusions we had with ‘see page 56’ on the cover,” King says.\n\nAs a result of Tiven’s coverage, and before the Rock Writers Convention, Ardent had invited him to Memphis to see the studio, and then flew him to San Francisco to attend a Bill Gavin Radio Convention where the label was pushing Big Star. “They made me part of the team and I was happy to be part of the team – I was very happy to be part of t he team,” Tiven says.\n\nTiven, now Nashville-based and a record producer whose recent projects include new albums by soul-music veterans Howard Tate and Garnet Mimms, has complicated feelings about Big Star today. After befriending Chilton, he had a difficult time trying to produce his 1975 solo session that resulted in the 1977 EP “The Singer Not the Song.” In fact, during this interview, he told some horror stories about Chilton’s conduct during the period, both during the recording sessions and afterward. Also during the mid-1970s, Tiven moved to Memphis and got to know Bell.\n\n“I found out Chris Bell was what I liked about Big Star,” Tiven says. “His songs were great – the songs that had his stamp on it were the things that really had struck me the hardest. By the time I was interested in Big Star, everybody was pushing Alex because Bell had left and nobody wanted him to meet anybody.”\n\nThere were some other events at the convention, headquartered at Holiday Inn – a screening of “The T.A.M.I. Show,” a bus trip past Graceland, a party on a Mississippi riverboat that featured music by bluesman Furry Lewis. And drinks did indeed flow. There was also a lot of talk, formally and informally, about rock writing.\n\nAnd there was the big show. However well the other acts on the bill played at the convention, Big Star’s show defined the event. “Their performance was really terrific,” Altman recalls. “It was a tough gig because they were doing a show for rock writers, but everybody was blown away. They were really doing more of their newer stuff – songs most of us weren’t familiar with, but they sounded really good. I do remember being impressed with how good a guitar player Chilton was, because in the Box Tops he was a singer.” (The band also threw some oldies into the mix, including a version of the Box Tops’ “The Letter.”)\n\nAnd that success convinced Chilton to stay with Big Star, at least long enough to record the great “Record City.” The critics supported it – Altman still calls it “lightning in a bottle.”\n\n“They nailed it,” King says of Big Star’s performance at the convention. “And Alex was going to leave the band. I talked to him and said, ‘You’ve got all this publicity, it’s foolish to throw it all away. Do another album. That’s why they stayed together.”\n\nThey didn’t stay together that much longer, actually. Just long enough to become iconic. As for the National Association of Rock Writers – it changed its name after the convention to Rock Writers of the World. Nothing much happened with that. But, all these years later, they have proved their worldwide influence by supporting Big Star.\n\n(In addition to interviews with Altman, Tiven and King, I also used as resource material a variety of articles available at rocksbackpages.com, including Barney Hoskyns’ “The Great Lig in the Sky” and his 2000 Big Star article for Mojo. Bruce Eaton’s 33 1/3 book “Radio City” and the pamphlet accompanying Stax’s 1992 re-release of the first two Big Star albums were also sources.)\n\nBY STEVEN ROSEN\n\nCINCINNATI CITYBEAT/2014/citybeat.com\n\nWith Blood Oranges in the Snow, Over the Rhine treats the Christmas album as a major artistic statement that questions the holiday’s celebratory nature as much as it acknowledges it.\n\nThe married duo of Linford Detweiler and Karin Bergquist, augmented by other musicians, will perform songs from the new album Saturday at Taft Theatre. Lily & Madeleine will open. This will be Over the Rhine’s 16th straight holiday show at the Taft, but this one’s a little different because of the new album. (They have recorded two previous Christmas records.) Longtime Cincinnati residents, they now live on Nowhere Farm in rural Highland County.\n\nTypical of Over the Rhine, this new album has acoustic-oriented material with gently powerful melodies and sensitively introspective lead vocals, most but not all by Bergquist. But Blood Oranges can’t just be described as a typical Christmas album.\n\nNot when the songs include the likes of Detweiler’s “My Father’s Body” (about Christmas Eve being the right time to visit his father’s grave) and “First Snowfall” (which begins with a description of “ragged and rusty” Christmas decorations and later references “two stray dogs runnin’ in Newport, Ky.”) The album also has a cover of Kim Taylor’s “Snowbirds,” about escaping winter, and Merle Haggard’s aching tale of working-class hardship, “If We Make It Through December.” The surface of Blood Oranges reflects great beauty, but melancholy ripples and rumbles underneath.\n\n“Karin at one point while we were making this leaned over to me and said, ‘I think we’ve stumbled onto a new kind of music called Reality Christmas,’” Detweiler said, by phone from Cleveland before a recent show there.\n\n“I think one aspect of that would be that losing a loved one or losing a job or any of these difficulties we deal with all year round doesn’t really go away during the holidays.\n\n“And those of us who grew up with the Christmas story were taught that something amazingly redemptive happened with the birth of Jesus. Angels were singing, there was good news, peace was coming to earth, this tiny child was somehow going to break the cycle of violence to which we’re so addicted.\n\n“When we kind of look at that ancient dream and the reality of where we are today, the distance between the two can seem like a wound too deep to heal, too wide to bridge,” he continued.\n\n“I think a lot of our songs live in that distance, that tension between the two. Who doesn’t want to believe peace can come to earth and these wrongs put right and forgiveness would trump retaliation? But we’re not there.”\n\nStill, Christmas does bring hope – if not for religious reasons, then because of the weather. December brings the possibility of a purifying snowfall, which occurs in the song “First Snowfall” when the flakes fall on a weary, downtrodden city. A city like Cincinnati.\n\n“I lived right on Main Street in Over-the-Rhine for 10 years, right across the street from where Kaldi’s (coffee house) eventually started,” Detweiler recalled. “It could get a little dingy down there in December back in the day – trash blowing around in the street, lots of characters hanging out drinking out of brown paper bags.\n\n“It seemed like there were a number of years when I lived in this little third-story apartment where the first big snowfall of the year was pretty significant and it seemed like it always started after dark. So it would come down and you’d see each one of the streetlights become its own snow globe. All of a sudden the city started going quiet and it always felt like something a little sacred was happening. To me, it always felt like a fresh start.”\n\nThe song’s reference to stray dogs in Newport comes from a the photograph that Michael Wilson — the Cincinnatian whose work has been featured on Over the Rhine album covers — took for the Replacements’ 1990 All Shook Down.\n\n“That was one of the first Michael Wilson photographs I saw in his basement when I met him and was starting this band,” Detweiler said. “That seemed to embody something important to us. We’ve been haunted by that image for years and I was glad to finally get it into a song.”\n\nAfter a quarter century as a musical act (sometimes with additional members), big changes are looming for Over the Rhine in 2015. “No way we can repeat those 25 years of touring and recording moving forward. So I think we need to reinvent or perish,” Detweiler said. “We’ve decided we need a creative home base. We are restoring a 140-year-old barn on another farm nearby. Nowhere Else will be second property.”\n\nSomewhat modeled on what the late Levon Helm did in Woodstock by using a barn on his property for a series of Midnight Ramble concerts with guest musicians, Detweiler plans to convert that barn into a 150-200-seat concert/recording venue and with 12-15 shows per year featuring the duo and invited guests. Near to Nowhere Farm, the Nowhere Else property is in Clinton County.\n\n“We’ll selectively begin introducing some of the amazing people we’ve met over the years, like Jack Henderson or Kim Taylor or Joe Henry or someone like Buddy Miller,” Detweiler said.\n\nWork is set to get underway soon and be finished by the end of May. On May 24 and 25, Over the Rhine is staging special barn-raising concerts for fans – tickets are $100 per person with information available at www.overtherhine.com. Over the Rhine has previously turned to fans to fund its last three albums, The Long Surrender, Meet Me at the Edge of the World and Blood Oranges.\n\n“Our fans have stepped forward and together we have learned we can make significant projects together,” Detweiler said. “We’re going to take this to the next level and really collaborate on building this barn together.\n\n“We’ll see if we’re crazy. If it ends up not working at all, we’ll be selling two farms and moving back to the neighborhood of Over-the-Rhine. But we might not be able to afford that now.”\n\nShola Lynch, director of Chisholm ’72: Unbought and Unbossed , has had an ongoing discussion about the nature of remembrance with her father, a retired history professor at Columbia University.\n\nWhy does history so quickly forget so many fascinating people? she asks him. She knows the father-daughter, back-and-forth by heart: “I go, ‘He was left out of American history!’ And he says, ‘A lot of people get left out.’ I say, ‘But that’s unjust.’ And he says, ‘Relax.'”\n\nBut she hasn’t relaxed and accepted it—and she’s not alone, either. Lynch is among a growing group of documentary filmmakers making features about often-forgotten or overlooked figures and events from the turbulent 1960s and 1970s-the “backwash,” so to speak, from the simultaneous political, sociological and cultural revolutions of the period.\n\nOne person Lynch felt had been left out is Shirley Chisholm, the African-American New York congresswoman who in 1972 improbably sought the Democratic presidential nomination. She was the first black woman to do so.\n\nIn that year, the first in which 18-year-olds could vote for president, Chisholm was one of many Democrats seeking the unenviable task of challenging President Nixon. But she also represented something more—the aspirations of women and minorities to fully participate as equals in all aspects of society. Including being President of the United States.\n\n“I studied American history, and I knew very little about her,” says Lynch, who at the time was too young to be aware of Chisholm’s campaign. “So, as a woman and a person of color, it made me think there are all these other people who may have been left out of the American historical landscape. I thought I’d start with her while she was still alive. Often, historical documentaries tell stories about people who have already passed, so they don’t get to participate in the telling of the story.”\n\nLynch’s film, which Lantern Lane is preparing for a limited theatrical release before a POV broadcast on PBS early next year, reveals just how serious and thoughtful Chisholm’s campaign was.\n\nBesides Unbought and Unbossed , there are other new documentaries about this period. One, Steve Vittoria’s One Bright Shining Moment: The Forgotten Summer of George McGovern, even covers the same 1972 Democratic primary—as well as the Presidential election that underdog liberal Democrat candidate McGovern, an anti-Vietnam War South Dakota senator, lost in a landslide.\n\nOthers include Guerilla, Robert Stone’s look at the Symbionese Liberation Army’s (SLA) kidnapping of Patty Hearst; Negroes with Guns, about early Black Power advocate Rob Williams and his flight to Cuba; and Home of the Brave, Paola di Florio’s remembrance of Viola Liuzzo, a white civil rights worker slain in Selma, Alabama, in 1965.\n\nThese follow such previous works as the Oscar-nominated The Weather Underground (Sam Green and Bill Siegel, dirs./prods; Carrie Lozano and Marc Smolowiz, prods.); The Cockettes (Bill Weber and David Weissman, dirs./prods); Alcatraz Is Not an Island (James M. Fortier, dir.; Jon Plutte, prod.); MC5* A True Testimonial (David C. Thomas, dir./prod.; Laurel M. Legler, prod.); Festival Express (Bob Smeaton, dir.); The Same River Twice (Robb Moss, dir./prod.) and others.\n\nFor the most part, such films are looking back at the liberal/radical side of that era’s famous “generation gap,” when a youth- and minority-oriented protest culture, with its own heroes and celebrities, challenged virtually everything that older society valued. Divisions over Vietnam and civil rights, especially, often spilled onto the streets. With time, the nation made its accommodations with its various rebels and moved on. Some parts of the counterculture successfully merged with mainstream pop culture, while others were written off and faded from public consciousness.\n\nExcept, apparently, from the memories of documentary filmmakers.\n\nIn a way, these new films represent a revived “power to the people” movement, albeit backward-looking, to redress history’s forgetfulness. It’s helped by the fact that many subjects are still alive and eager to do interviews, and also by the plethora of available footage. It’s also helped by a philosophical sense of mission among the filmmakers.\n\n“You fail a lot in pursuing success,” Lynch says. “But somehow in history we only talk about the success. I could not be interested in history until I understood the failures that lead to success. And this is from a period where there was a feeling of hope that I, as an individual, could make a change. That’s not failure.”\n\nThat’s certainly how Chisholm, herself, sees her life. Now retired, but still outspoken in the same demonstratively articulate way she was in 1972, she closes Lynch’s film by saying, “I want to be remembered as a woman who lived in the 20th Century, who was a catalyst for change.”\n\nIf Lynch’s motivation for the Chisholm film is to teach people who she was, Vittoria’s purpose in One Bright Shining Moment is to restore McGovern’s reputation. Most people still have an opinion about him; he’s derided as a loser.\n\n“American history has used George McGovern’s campaign for the past 30 years as a punching bag for producing the biggest presidential loss,” says Vittoria, whose film will screen at this year’s Mill Valley Film Festival and then seek theatrical release. “But my message is that in fact it was one bright shining moment in American politics. He was being fair and honest with people, working on issues instead of rhetoric. He got destroyed by one of the most unsavory characters in political history.”\n\nFor Vittoria, the film also was a way to finally meet McGovern, who is now 81 and cooperated with the project along with Gary Hart, Warren Beatty and others active in the campaign. In 1972, as a teenager, Vittoria temporarily dropped out of high school to work for the McGovern campaign. Afterward, fired by political activism, he ran for the school board in West Orange, New Jersey, while still a 16-year-old student. It took a decision from a US Supreme Court justice to get him off the ballot.\n\nWhereas Chisholm and McGovern sought change within the system, Rob Williams, the subject of Negroes with Guns, was ready to fight the system, if need be. A black activist in Monroe, North Carolina, in the 1950s, he got into trouble for advocating armed self-resistance against the Ku Klux Klan and other racist groups.\n\nQuestionably charged with kidnapping a white couple, he fled to Cuba in 1961, where he exhorted blacks via his Radio Free Dixie broadcasts to fight for power. He also wrote the book Negroes with Guns, the story of his life and a manifesto, of sorts. Returning to the US in the early 1970s after first going to China, he became a symbol for the Black Panthers and other militants but never a crucial player in the civil rights movement. He died in 1996, a mere footnote.\n\nSandra Dickson, who wrote and co-directed (with Churchill Roberts) the film with support from the University of Florida’s Documentary Institute, says she likes stories about “unsung heroes.” She earlier made Freedom Never Dies, about a forgotten Southern civil rights activist, Harry Moore, who was murdered by segregationists.\n\n“He’s an incredibly important part of the civil rights movement that hasn’t gotten much attention, so people don’t know the story,” Dickson says of Williams. “Rob was representative of the way many African-Americans felt, particularly in the South. They were non-pacifist, particularly when off the protest line.”\n\nFor some filmmakers looking at contemporary America, studying the revolutionary militancy at the fringes of 1960s and 1970s protest has value. They want to root around in that era’s shadowy corners, looking for hidden keys to what troubles us today.\n\n“In many ways, there was a wound that opened in American society then, a conflict as to what sort of direction our country would go in, what we would be about, what we would stand for,” said The Weather Underground ‘s co-director Sam Green, when interviewed by this writer for a recent Denver Post story. “That hasn’t entirely healed. It keeps bubbling up in strange ways. A lot of these movies are trying to come to terms with that. They’re trying to make more sense of it than simple histories of the ’60s and ’70s would do.”\n\nNothing seems wilder—or more aberrant—about the period today than the story of the California-based SLA, which assassinated an Oakland school superintendent in 1973 and then kidnapped Patty Hearst in 1974. Though tiny, it was essentially a revolutionary cell. Stone’s Guerilla: The Taking of Patty Hearst, about that event, will be released theatrically by Magnolia Pictures in November.\n\nThe film is lively and frequently even witty, incorporating images from old movies and TV series like The Adventures of Robin Hood and Zorro to attempt to show the all-American roots for the SLA’s strange ideas. Stone also shows that the group could be trenchantly biting in critiquing Big Business and Big Media, as when it issued demands on Hearst’s father, newspaper publisher Randolph Hearst, to spend his money giving away food.\n\nAnd when Patty Hearst joined the SLA and started participating in bank robberies and issuing leftist communiqués of her own, the story set off the kind of hysterical journalistic circus that today seems commonplace. She eventually was arrested, and she stood trial and spent time in jail; other members were either killed in a shoot-out with Los Angeles police or are in jail now for a bank robbery that resulted in a woman’s death. “The story is epic,” Stone says of the SLA. “I certainly think it merits a feature-length tribute.”\n\nStone’s 1987 film Radio Bikini, about the atomic bomb testing at Bikini Atoll in 1946, was an Academy Award nominee. He subsequently directed and edited a multimedia exhibition about President John F. Kennedy for the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, among other projects. He is interested in finding contemporary meaning in historical events, and believes the SLA’s impact continues to reverberate.\n\n“Their adventure really marked the end of what we know as the 1960s,” he says. “A whole period of upheaval came to a symbolic crashing end with the SLA. I think that’s one of the things that drew me to the story. It was a way to come to understand these crazy times we were emerging from. The SLA was probably the most extreme group politically to emerge from the time.\n\n“One of the interesting things about the SLA is that their focus was anti-corporate,” he continues. “They were ahead of the curve, and a lot of what they said was true. That was another thing that drew me to it—you could separate the craziness from the core message, and there was some truth to it, which is probably why Patty Hearst got sucked into it.”\n\nTo Stone, we are not in a quieter time now, nostalgically looking back on the weirdness of those good old radical days of baby boomer youth. Since September 11, 2001, we are in a new, different kind of constant state of alert and fear—and there are lessons to be learned in the recent past.\n\n“It’s always difficult when you’re in the middle of a transformative moment—as we are now—to come to grips with it and to make a film about it,” he says. “It’s a moving target. We’re in a swirl of chaos now. That’s why history is useful—to look back at things in the past where there are similarities and lessons to be learned.\n\n“And it’s best to do that with a really good story rather than doing some kind of didactic documentary about terrorism and media,” he says. “If you’ve got a story that’s compelling and you can take people on a journey and they walk out and think about something, you’ve made a movie.”\n\nMeanwhile, where will this documentary trend end? The better question is, What will the next one’s subject be? “Is anybody doing a film on Eugene McCarthy?” asks One Bright Shining Moment ‘s Vittoria."
