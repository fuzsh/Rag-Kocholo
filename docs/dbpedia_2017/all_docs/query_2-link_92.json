        "text": "History\n\n[edit]\n\nFormerly known as Losantiville, the city was renamed Cincinnati by the first governor of the Northwest Territory, Arthur St. Clair, in honor of the Society of the Cincinnati, a society named after Roman dictator Cincinnatus who famously gave up absolute power and returned to his farm after serving his country in times of crisis and founded at the end of the Revolutionary War. Many members of the society were prominent men in the early years of the United States.\n\nThe city's early economy was based on the pork industry, and this was celebrated in the summer of 2000 with the Big Pig Gig, during which large flying pig statues took up residence along the city's main thoroughfares. Many of these pig statues later found homes downtown in offices, parks and even private residences. The Miami and Erie canal was completed in the 1840s, and was used to transport hogs and butchered pork products to Cincinnati from much of western Ohio.\n\nDuring this time period massive waves of Germans settled into the city populating neighborhoods which at their height in the late 1800s were some of the most densely populated outside of New York City. These German immigrants built a culture based on beer gardens, beer brewing, dance and music halls giving Cincinnati a very distinct and vibrant local culture. Very little remains from this era due to both World War I anti-German backlash and the prohibition of alcohol in 1920. Lately, with the beginnings of revitalization of the Downtown Basin neighborhoods, there has been a renewed interest in this heritage and some of it can be seen to this day in faded German signs on densely built ornate Victorian buildings in Over-The-Rhine, a high per-capita number of bars, and the celebration of large German festivals such as Bockfest, Mayfest, and the largest Oktoberfest celebration in the United States.\n\nCincinnati also has a charming riverboat heritage that dates back to the days when large, steam and paddle-wheel driven vessels were used to transport locally produced pork products. In recognition of this tradition, the city plays host to the Tall Stacks Festival once every few years (although it hasn't been held since 2006), during which time the river front is transformed into a mass of color, with river boats of all shapes and sizes jostling for positions along the river banks. Baseball is another Cincinnati tradition, and the Cincinnati Reds were the first professional baseball team in the United States; in deference to that, Opening Day is always a home game for the Reds, held at Great American Ball Park.\n\nCincinnati has a thriving local industrial economy and is home to many businesses ranging from manufacturing to services, including General Electric, Procter and Gamble, Fifth Third Bank, Milacron, Kroger, and the American Financial Group. In World Wars I and II, Cincinnati's local machine tool companies, such as LeBlond (now Makino) and the Cincinnati Screw and Tap Company (now Milacron), played an important role, providing what is commonly considered the best machine tool technology in the world for its time.\n\nCincinnati has undertaken some large scale revitalization projects, such as the construction of Great American Ball Park, Paycor Stadium, and TQL Stadium; the reconstruction of Fountain Square, the construction of the first and second phases of the Banks neighborhood, the beginnings of restoration of Over-The-Rhine south of Liberty Street, and a streetcar line connecting downtown to the historic Findlay Market in Over-the-Rhine. This has given the central areas of Cincinnati a vitality that hadn't been around for decades, and a small degree of national attention from travel publications. In spite of the sweeping changes over the last 10 years its still a work in progress creating an odd mix of abandoned buildings next to high end restaurants and boutiques.\n\nThis progress did not come easy. For instance, county officials, city government, and area residents were flabbergasted that large-scale projects like \"The Banks\" were undeveloped for over 10 years while the smaller cities of Newport and Covington, across the Ohio River, continued to develop their riverfronts and draw visitors away from Cincinnati. However the tide seems to be flowing back in Cincinnati's favor; time will tell as these developments mature.\n\nThere is a rivalry between the \"East Side\" and \"West Side\" of Cincinnati. Historically people from the West Side were blue collar workers, while those from the East Side were white collar workers\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nThe main form of public transportation is by bus. The region is served by two bus systems. The Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (Sorta) operates Metro, the bus company that serves the Ohio side of the state line. The Transit Authority of Northern Kentucky (Tank) serves Northern Kentucky and all routes between Northern Kentucky and Cincinnati. Bus lines marked with a \"X\" are express routes and make less frequent stops. Be sure to check whether the bus makes a stop at your required destination before you get on. Sorta and Tank operate a different fare rate system, though both require passengers to submit the exact fare and no change is given.\n\nIf you plan on taking the bus, highly recommended is the \"Cincinnati Frequent Transit Map\" which was developed by a concerned citizen looking to increase transit use. This will give you a good idea of which parts of town are well served by transit as well as which parts of town are underserved, eliminating lines from the official map that don't have frequent service. More information here: https://web.archive.org/web/20221211225107/http://cincymap.org/\n\nFor sightseeing the recommended option is the Metro 1 bus. Metro's tag line for this bus is \"Ride the One for Fun,\" because it visits the most important cultural destinations in the city. The bus loops from the Union Terminal Museum Center, to downtown's theaters and museums, to the sports stadiums and parks on the riverfront, to the upscale Mount Adams residential neighborhood, to Eden Park and Krohn Conservatory, ending in nearby Peebles Corner, Walnut Hills. This bus is $1.75 a ride, but passes are available. If taking the 1 especially if from a more transit rich city, make sure to check a schedule first as the line can close early and doesn't have the highest frequencies of routes.\n\nIf you wish to cross the river into Kentucky be sure to ride the Southbank Shuttle, which loops around the riverfront on the Ohio and Kentucky sides. Stops include Fountain Square, The Banks, Newport on the Levee, and Roebling Point. The Shuttle is often used by locals who do not want to drink and drive or pay high parking prices, as the shuttle stops at many popular nightlife spots. The Shuttle is instantly recognizable by its old-fashioned trolley look, but are newer and cleaner than the regular TANK bus system. The shuttle is also cheaper at $1 a ride. Daily passes are available.\n\nMetro charges passengers based on zones: Zone 1 (The City of Cincinnati), Zone 2 (Hamilton County, outside of Cincinnati), and Zone 3 (Stops outside of Hamilton County and the City of Cincinnati). Prices for each zone are respectively: $1.75, $2.65, and $3. Metro has several routes, most notably routes 71X and 72 (both $4.25), which charge a slightly higher fare than normal. Transferring between one bus route to another on the Metro system requires another 50 cents for a transfer ticket and passengers transferring from a Zone 2 or 3 bus to another Zone 2 or 3 bus should ensure that the bus driver hole punches the appropriate zone on the transfer ticket. Otherwise a further payment equivalent to the difference between the zone you're traveling to, if your trip ends in zone 2 or 3, and zone 1 fare must be paid.\n\nTANK (Transit Authority of Northern Kentucky) buses charge a flat rate of $1.50 for all adults, 75¢ for seniors, $1; for students. Transfers between TANK buses are free. However, transferring between TANK buses and a Metro buses costs an additional 50¢ or 40¢, if you're transferring to a TANK bus from a Metro bus.\n\nGovernment Square\n\n[edit]\n\nGovernment Square is the main bus hub for Metro and is on Walnut Street. Occasionally, when large events are going on downtown, bus routes will be re-routed to avoid Government Square. The square received its name due to the government buildings that border the square, such as the Federal Office Building, a Federal Courthouse, and a Federal Reserve Bank branch. Within the complex is an information kiosk providing details of bus routes and a free Wi-Fi service.\n\nLines\n\n[edit]\n\nBelow is a short list of the most important SORTA (Metro) lines that serve tourist sites.\n\nRoute 1 is a route marketed to tourists as the 1 for Fun, and although it only runs about every 30 min on weekdays and every hour on weekends, its still useful for getting to some major sites between Union Terminal and Mt Adams just make sure to get a schedule on Metro's website before trying to catch it: Museum Center,Ezzard Charles and Linn Street (Near Music Hall and Washington Park), Government square area F(eastbound)/4 & Walnut Downtown (westbound), Art Museum (Mt. Adams), Park and Taft Ave.\n\nRoute 72 - stops from Downtown to Kings Island: Walnut Street & Court Street (Downtown), Government Square, Area B, Kenwood Road & Montgomery Road, Mason-Montgomery & Fields Ertel Road (\"Park and Ride\"), Mason-Montgomery & Western Row Road, Kings Island.\n\nRoute 71X - stops from Downtown to Kings Island: Walnut Street & Court Street (Downtown), Government Square, Area B, Kings Island, Mason-Montgomery & Fields Ertel Road (\"Park and Ride\").\n\nRoute 17 - one of the more frequent routes in Metro, good for going to OTR, University of Cincinnati, Clifton and Northside. The ride up from Main Street in OTR to the hilltop neighborhoods on E Clifton is a good way to soak in the gorgeous Victorian architecture of the area and see a few of the more vibrant urban neighborhoods too.\n\nMetro*Plus - Metro's try at speeding up bus times by reducing stops. This limited route goes between Downtown and Kenwood Mall passing by University of Cincinnati (not far from the Zoo) and Xavier University along the way. Runs every 15-30 min, weekdays only. See website schedule for details.\n\nSome of the older neighborhoods in Cincinnati are quite walkable, with the Clifton Gaslight District (Ludlow), Over-The-Rhine, Mt. Adams, and Downtown being amongst the easiest to travel by foot. Due to massive depopulation of neighborhoods that had densities approaching that of New York City, (like Over-The-Rhine and the West End), Cincinnati is way more car oriented these days with most destinations being too spread out to walk to. However, many of these districts were built to pedestrian scale and are worth a stroll so long as one exercises caution (see the stay safe section). A visitor from a larger East Coast city may expect neighborhoods of similar scale and architectural composition to be filled with people, but instead oftentimes they are full of abandonment and the problems that come along with it. However, places like Mt. Adams, Downtown, or Clifton around the Gaslight District don't have these problems are well worth exploring by foot, park your car outside of the neighborhood and walk right in.\n\nSkywalk\n\n[edit]\n\nCincinnati's Downtown has a Skywalk path. The Skywalk is an indoor, above-ground path through the streets of Cincinnati's Downtown. The Skywalk is free, and only used by pedestrians. Urban analysts hired by the city and downtown business leaders want to tear down chunks of the elevated passageways. Although most of the paths have been torn down, some of the Skywalk still exists, allowing travelers to continue to beat the weather.\n\nHillside Steps\n\n[edit]\n\nCincinnati has over 400 hillside steps for the adventurous traveler to explore. These steps were built before people had cars to facilitate easy transportation by foot up and down the steep hillsides that populate the city. Some steps are very famous such as the Mt. Adams Steps up to the Holy Cross Immaculata Church (described under the To See section) while others underused and/or are falling apart. Still more, like St. Gregory's steps in Mt. Adams, are hidden gems, guiding a traveler through a hidden forest oasis in a densely populated neighborhood. Be cautious when traveling on these steps, as they sometimes go through remote areas and while the neighborhood on one end of the steps could be safe, the neighborhood at the other could be crime infested. The city has a somewhat difficult to decipher but extensive guide of the locations and conditions of the steps here.\n\nBy bicycle\n\n[edit]\n\nCincinnati has a long way to go before it reaches the level of Portland or Chicago in terms of bicycle culture and accessibility. However, the city has installed bicycle lanes and on-street bicycle parking in some key neighborhoods like Over-the-Rhine and Northside. Biking in Cincinnati is challenging, and is recommended for experienced urban riders, as the terrain is quite hilly producing often curvy roads that can go up or down very steep grades.\n\nDespite the challenge, the narrow roads and urban setting are well suited for using a bicycle. Residential neighborhoods along the river near downtown (Roebling Point, The Banks, Over-the-Rhine, Newport Historic East Row) are relatively flat and quiet. The city posts a color-coded map/guide to recommended bicycle routes and facilities, and provides information regarding its bicycle policies and projects here. All buses have bike mounts on the front if you get tired or don't want to pedal up a hill.\n\nYou can rent bikes from the Cincinnati Bike Center at Smale Riverfront Park or from Wheel of Fun Rentals by Sawyer Point on the Riverfront downtown (charges hourly, including tandem bikes).\n\nBike share is also available: Cincy Red Bike - $8 for a day-pass which will give you unlimited free hour-long trips over the course of a day (different from the 30-min trips common for most cities). The bikes come with locks and baskets. If you have a yearly pass with another Bcycle bike share system your card will work with Cincy's (see website for details). Most stations are concentrated in Downtown, Over the Rhine, and by the university with a map available on the website and on individual stations, though the system is expanding with new stations in Northern Kentucky's river towns, Northside and Eden Park being the newest locations. Be careful to return the bikes within an hour as the longer you leave the bikes off of a station the more you will get charged!\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nFor getting quickly and conveniently to most places in Cincinnati, you will need a car. There is a street grid only in Downtown and its surrounding neighborhoods. Outside of those parts of the city navigation can be tough, with street names changing constantly and unintuitive routes being the norm. It can be particularly tough getting up to Mt. Adams. If you don't go down the right series of one-way streets, you could wind up getting flung out to one of the surrounding neighborhoods or Eden Park. There are a few signs directing drivers through the neighborhood, but they are easily missed. A good roadmap or GPS system is highly recommended if you plan on driving around.\n\nMany roads are very narrow and very hilly reflecting the age of most of Cincinnati, which was built well before the automobile was the mainstay of transportation. Some streets will feel like country roads with the occasional urban house or apartment built where the terrain can support it. Other roads like the aptly named Straight Street quite literally go straight down a hill at a very steep grade. Be careful when driving in inclement weather. When parking on a steep slope, point your tires towards the curb (if downhill) or away from the curb (if uphill) and use your emergency brake.\n\nI-75 is to be avoided around rush hours at all costs. While traffic isn't as heavy as one would encounter in much larger cities, it can still be quite formidable. The large amount of truck traffic, combined short ramps and many blind corners create a traffic nightmare. If you can, take the less traveled (though still somewhat congested) I-71.\n\nParking is generally cheap and plentiful in Cincinnati. The few trouble spots are around the University in the Clifton/Corryville areas (Uptown), Downtown, Mt. Adams and Over the Rhine south of Liberty Street. When parking in Mt. Adams, be aware of parking restrictions by reading the signs. There are far more parking restrictions here than anywhere else in the city, due to the narrow streets and dense population of that neighborhood."
