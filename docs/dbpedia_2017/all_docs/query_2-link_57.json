        "text": "Cincy Fringe preps for year twelve, the DodecaFringe!\n\nKnow Theatre of Cincinnati is hitting the home stretch for the 12​th annual Cincinnati Fringe Festival —lovingly referred to in-house as the “DodecaFringe.” This year’s Festival runs May 26-June 6, 2015 and is shaping up to be the biggest Cincy Fringe yet. The Fringe is once again set to welcome over 8,000 visitors to Downtown and Over-the-Rhine as we offer the region’s only theatre and arts festival that’s ​Kinda Weird​. Like You.​.\n\nCincy Fringe will begin on Tuesday, May 26 with the official CityBeat Fringe Kick-Off Party and continues through June 6, with 40 Performance Fringe Productions (including 4 FringeNext participants), 2 FringeDevelopment pieces, a handful of exciting Special Events, and another larger-than-life mural project from Higher Level Art as part of the Visual Fringe…with more to be announced!\n\nThe official CityBeat Fringe Kick-Off Party launches the festivities on May 26​ at 6:00pm. Guests will enjoy local bands ​Pop Goes the Evil and​ Lagniappe, the launch of the 2015 ​Channel Fringe Hard-Hitting Action News Update, complimentary food, cash bar, and more. It is a great way to meet Fringe artists, staff, volunteers, and other audience members. A suggested donation of $10 will grant admission to the event and a drink ticket for Know’s Underground bar.\n\nThe 2015 Festival brought in a record-setting number of applications for the Performance Fringe. Associate Producer Chris Wesselman notes, “We weren’t on pace to set any records this year but the final day we accepted applications saw a tidal wave pour in that pushed us to an all-time high. Cincy Fringe continues to attract artists old and new as we maintain our focus on the festival’s goal of creating an artist-friendly environment, including keeping the cost of producing at Cincy Fringe lower than any other festival, providing unique opportunities for artists to grow and collaborate while they are here, and preserving the amazingly loyal and supportive audience that comes out for Fringe every year.”\n\nThis year’s line-up includes a wonderful balance of local vs. out of town producers with 53% of shows coming right out of Cincinnati. “Over the last few years, we’ve seen the numbers tip slightly in favor of out-of-town productions,” Know’s Producing Artistic Director Andrew Hungerford explains, “so it’s exciting to see that balance tilt the other way. Cincinnati has a deep pool of talented artists and we love being able to provide a showcase for their work. Cincy Fringe provides a unique opportunity for the entirety of the Cincinnati theatre community to play together and this year’s lineup truly underscores that.”\n\nA total of 40 shows have been accepted for the Performance Fringe and, of those accepted productions, 21 hail from the Cincinnati region and 19 come from outside of immediate area, including a record-setting four international acts arriving from South Africa, Japan, Canada, and the UK. Know’s Associate Artistic Director Tamara Winters adds, “International acts bring a worldly perspective to Cincy Fringe that really provides something special. Our ability to attract artists from all corners of the globe is thrilling and it’s great to see how our reputation amongst Fringe Festivals and artists continues to grow.”\n\nThe breakdown of this year’s line-up is as follows: Dance – 3, Interdisciplinary/Other – 10, Musical – 3, Play – 15, Solo – 9.\n\nThe FringeNext portion of the Performance Fringe heads into its fifth year of providing local teens a unique opportunity to produce, write, direct, and act in original works alongside the rest of the Fringe artists. FringeNext is aimed at fostering high school performers and providing a training ground for these aspiring theatre professionals. We’ve accepted four FringeNext productions this year, representing artists from three local schools; The School for the Creative and Performing Arts (SCPA), Highlands High School, and St. Xavier High School. Chris Wesselman remarks, “We’re always blown away by the overall strength of our FringeNext submissions and this year was no different. With the opportunity to work on projects they might otherwise be unable to, these young artists don’t hold back. They dive into their work with all the gusto and passion of regular Fringers and we’re elated to have these groups joining our lineup.” Three FringeNext productions are Plays, one is Interdisciplinary/Other.\n\nThis year the Performance Fringe Jury, which adjudicates all submissions (including FringeNext), was increased to a record twenty-four jurors to expand upon application feedback in an effort to increase the diversity and variety within the lineup. This year’s jury was composed of notable actors, writers, directors, producers, and other individuals rooted within Cincinnati’s amazing theatre community, consisting of: Andrew Hungerford, Betsy Shank, Brandon Robert Martin, Brian Isaac Phillips, Burgess Byrd, Chris Wesselman, D. Lynn Meyers, Darnell Benjamin, Daryl Harris, Dave Levy, Derek Snow, Heather Britt, Jeanne Mam-Luft, Jim Stump, Julie Engebrecht, Justin McCombs, Maggie Lou Rader, Mark Lutwak, Michael Burnham, Mike Flohr, Richard Hess, Rico Reid, Shannon Rae Lutz, and Tamara Winters.\n\nThe 2015 Fringe Festival will also include the fourth year of our FringeDevelopment programming. FringeDevelopment is an opportunity for artists to leverage the overwhelming creativity of the Fringe community and focus it into the development of a new work during the 12 days of the Festival. FringeDevelopment partners writers, producers, actors, and other artists from across Fringe groups and provides the time, space, and support for them to create or continue developing a new work and culminates in a one-night-only performance towards the end of the festival. This year we’re proud to welcome a familiar face – and a not-so-familiar face – to FringeDevelopment. Local artist Alison Vodnoy, no stranger to the Cincy Fringe, will be workshopping a new project, ​HUNGRY MOTHER and we’ll soon announce a second exciting development project from an internationally acclaimed Fringe artist.\n\nRounding out the performance offerings this year will be our Special Event presentations. “Every year we feature a collection of special, one-off events that bring added flavor to the Festival,” Andrew Hungerford explains, “and we’ve got some really cool presentations to share in 2015, both returning classics and brand new events.”\n\nBack for another year will be ​trueFRINGE, the Festival-focused installment of True Theatre, a storytelling series featured quarterly at Know Theatre as part of the Jackson Street Market resource-sharing program, which will feature Fringe staff and artists.\n\nOTRimprov, another Jackson Street Market participant, also returns to Fringe with a one-night preview of their Improv Festival of Cincinnati (IF Cincy) where local improvisers (and maybe some other not-so-local special guests) will give you a taste of what you can expect at the 2​nd Annual IF Cincy in September of 2015. We also welcome back Ensemble Theatre Cincinnati’s Intern Company with their production of ​Love and Information by Caryl Churchill​.\n\nThe final item on the docket for our Special Events is a crossover promotion with the OTR Performs Series at Washington Park as Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park presents an exciting staged concert reading of KJ Sanchez’s play ​Cincinnati King, which tells the story of music pioneer Syd Nathan and King Records. More information on all these events can be found at the end of this release.\n\nThe Cincinnati Fringe Festival also features unique art projects every year as part of our Visual Fringe. This year we’ll once again welcome the team at Higher Level Art to coat a side of our building with one of their amazing murals, with this year’s project planned for the south side of Know Theatre.\n\nThis year’s Visual Fringe will also feature a series of mini-projects still in the planning stage. Final information can be expected in the official Cincy Fringe Guide when it is dispersed by our print and media sponsor, Cincinnati CityBeat, on May 13​th\n\nAfter all the shows are finished each day, artists, audience members, staff, and volunteers gather together at Know Theatre’s Underground/Fringe Headquarters for the Fringe Bar Series, headlined by the ​Channel Fringe Hard Hitting Action News Update, a broadcast that can get a little silly as it covers all the pertinent information about goings-on at Cincy Fringe, including openings, closings, sell-outs, schedule changes, and reminders about upcoming events. Following ​Channel Fringe, the Bar Series will feature different activities and themes, such as the 60 Second Fringe Previews, Fringe Olympics, Fringe-A-Oke, Fringe Prom, Segway Night, and Fringetoberfest. Food will be provided and select food vendors will be on site for special nights in the Bar Series. The entire 2015 Bar Series lineup will be revealed in the official Cincy Fringe Guide.\n\nTickets:\n\n$15​ for single tickets\n\n$30 One Night Stand Pass ​- two ticket pass plus a drink at Know’s Underground bar.\n\n$65 Voyeur Pass​ – 6-ticket pass good for any combination of tickets and patrons.\n\n$200 Full Frontal All-Access Pass​ – good for as many shows as possible (one patron)\n\nArtists receive 50% of ticket and pass sales.

They may redden cheeks, make eyes water, and elicit eruptions of laughter. They take you somewhere. Although great storytelling is not limited to true, personal stories, True Theatre believes that these real moments of our lives, from the mundane to the extraordinary, give both the speaker AND the listener the ultimate sense of being part of a larger community than they were aware.
