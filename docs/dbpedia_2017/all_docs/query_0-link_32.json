The practice’s non-surgical services include Botox®-type injectables, dermal fillers, laser treatments, and microneedling. In addition to specializing in cosmetic surgery procedures for the face, breast, and body, the cosmetic surgeons offer a safe choice for non-surgical med spa treatments in the Cincinnati and Dayton area.\n\n“We are proud to offer these popular aesthetic enhancements to our patients in a sterile, safe medical environment,” commented Dr. Mark Mandell-Brown, who founded the award-winning plastic surgery practice. “While there are more choices than ever as far as where to receive Botox and filler, patients appreciate that they can receive these from a board-certified cosmetic surgeon at our practice.”\n\nTo learn more or contact the practice, visit www.mandellbrown.com.\n\nAbout Dr. Mandell-Brown: Dr. Mark Mandell-Brown is a triple-board certified plastic surgeon known throughout the Cincinnati Tri-State area for Natural Look™ cosmetic surgery.
