        "text": "Minority populations and those of low-socioeconomic status are among the most vulnerable to housing instability. When people are pushed out of their long-time homes into more disinvested areas, they are pushed farther away from jobs, access to affordable and healthy food, medical services, and social service resources. Additionally, if people are not getting their basic needs met such as having a dry, temperature-controlled, clean home, they cannot sufficiently address their other needs. [01] Housing stability, or lack thereof, is a determinant of health that can affect rates of infectious diseases, chronic diseases, injuries, childhood development and nutrition, mental health, and create inequities in housing which can lead to more health disparities. [02] The stress of being displaced from an area your family has lived in for generations can have detrimental health effects, and unsustainable mortgage or rent payments correlate with lower self-reported mental health. [03]\n\nOver-the-Rhine (OTR) is a neighborhood just north of downtown Cincinnati, Ohio with health-related issues tied to housing instability from gentrification since the early 2000s. The neighborhood is currently home to Cincinnati’s largest concentration of businesses, social services, and subsidized housing. [04] OTR has recently undergone urban development resulting in the displacement of the 80% black working-class community who has resided there for generations. [05] This is not a new problem, as shown in the context of the OTR neighborhood; housing instability should not be treated as a new type of crisis but a crisis that oppressed groups have faced for decades. [06]\n\nHistory of the Over-The-Rhine Neighborhood\n\nTo understand the context of this situation, a thorough understanding of this neighborhood’s history is needed. OTR began as a German immigrant hub in the 1830s and 1840s which the culture of the neighborhood continues to reflect. [07] Findlay Market opened in 1855 and later morphed into an expensive farmers market—within walking distance to those living in OTR but not affordable for those same people. Many cultural businesses were created in the OTR neighborhood including breweries, Music Hall and Hamilton County Memorial Hall. As the breweries became larger, the wealthy German employees and entrepreneurs could afford to move out of the packed city and into the suburbs. Appalachian immigrants and African Americans moved into the city to capitalize on the industrial jobs offered in the city and the inexpensive rents. The living conditions were poor: many apartments were without running water and no outside investments arrived to aid in quality, safe, affordable housing.\n\nIn the 1960s and 70s, African Americans who had low-income moved into OTR because they were pushed out of their neighborhoods when the highways I-71 and I-75 were built. Over the next thirty years, more organizations threw money into OTR to preserve the historical buildings rather than adding quality, affordable housing. [08] In 2001, one of the largest providers of subsidized housing in OTR went bankrupt, resulting in a loss of 1,089 subsidized homes. [09]\n\nToday, the population most affected by the gentrification and housing instability are black, working-class, low-socioeconomic status individuals. In 2010, OTR still had a 72% black community. [10] By 2014 the population of OTR changed to two-thirds white. [11] In 2018, one need only walk north on Vine Street and cross Liberty Street to see the situation is noticeably different for the two populations: immediately run down houses and cracked sidewalks are prevalent—this part of OTR is still 80% black and has not yet been redeveloped. [12]\n\nRole of 3CDC\n\nReal estate consultant, John Alschuler, was the architect behind revitalizing OTR (Woodard, 2016). Beginning in the early 2000s, Alschuler marketed the endeavor as a mixed-income neighborhood that would be great for everyone in Cincinnati. He insisted there not be any more studies on the neighborhood to evaluate its needs but rather hire outside people to run the project. He then eliminated the original planning committee for the project and created his own non-profit, 3CDC, with funding from several large Cincinnati based corporations. New restaurants were created, the park was revitalized and infrastructure was added to make a more walkable neighborhood. [13]\n\nA study conducted by the Over-the-Rhine Community Council found that between 2002 and 2015 there was a 73% reduction in affordable housing. [14] This study illustrated large numbers of households either spend more than 30% of their income on housing or are forced to leave the neighborhood their family has lived in for generations. [15] This population who is underserved has seen several waves of displacement over the past 50 years and it is unclear when the city, or its investors, will see the damage they are causing and begin incorporating community-based solutions to create a mixed-income and diverse neighborhood.\n\nOTR apartment rents are on the rise, as is the median income of the community. This is because those who cannot afford the housing price increase are forced north to an underdeveloped and underserved area of Cincinnati with affordable housing but lacking many of the resources OTR offers—development is concentrated but not widespread. [30] 3CDC has met their goal: increase mixed-use housing in order to decrease crime and increase the perceived vitality of the neighborhood. However, their goal of mixed-income housing has not been met which has cost thousands of people their homes, community support, and access to necessary resources.\n\nPotential Solutions\n\nOTR is not an anomaly; stories of gentrification continue to permeate our literature about urban areas. Solutions seem elusive at times because the issues are so multi-dimensional. Politics and economics drive this issue which are difficult to combat with typical public health solutions. Knowing this, two solutions are proposed based on other similar cities’ plans and actions. Gentrification is a piece of OTR’s history but does not need to be a part of their future.\n\nThe inspiration for the housing policy idea created is “A Roadmap Toward Equity: Housing Solutions for Oakland, California.” [31] They call for policy changes that will prevent displacement of multi-generational residents, improve their housing conditions, and increase affordable housing stock. Their plan is intricate but one significant recommendation was the city should work with regional bodies to form a partnership leading to a housing trust fund. They hope to gain money for this trust by requiring developers to give 25% of their proceeds when building non-affordable housing units. [32] This could be modeled from the Ontario-based organization, Healthy Communities Coalition (HCC), which seeks to create space for innovative solutions and build sustainable and equitable communities. HCC leads many projects which intervene on the policy, organization and community level. [33]\n\nA well-known activist in Cincinnati, Buddy Gray, once said this about OTR: “We’re much like a colony far away in the Third World who’s being attacked by outsiders who want our land. Our land is really valuable now, and we are not.” [35] This statement seems more applicable than ever. Currently, organizations are working on their own and journalists are writing exposés to convince the council members of the negative impacts that arise from allowing 3CDC to develop without being forced to respect the wishes of the neighborhood’s population. While the OTR Community Council is doing great work, they need to connect beyond individuals in the community to more organizations. Therefore, a community coalition should form with the intent to connect local organizations with residents of OTR. The coalition also needs to recruit the newcomers who have moved into OTR. Without their voting support, it will be far more difficult to create meaningful change to the OTR neighborhood.\n\nThis community coalition should hold meetings and re-write the original community plan (originally titled “Over-the-Rhine Comprehensive Plan”) with OTR council members and the Cincinnati City Board of Directors as the primary intended audience. The document must illustrate why the residents’ ideas and lives are valuable, and how they are not currently being respected. It will also need to be realistic; the original document was extensive and had widespread support but without financial buy-in from policy-makers, 3CDC was able to ignore their suggestions and proceed with its plans. [36] OTR’s organizations have the power to increase social cohesion by forming a coalition that will connect residents with policymakers who can influence how developers are regulated. Such efforts will undoubtedly require creativity, hard work, and patience.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe combination of stress and low social support can lead to negative health outcomes. [37] Therefore, increasing social support and cohesion in this community is vital if change is to occur. Nevertheless, Yvette Simpson who is a councilwoman in Cincinnati said 3CDC is a private nonprofit and therefore does not need to answer to the community, only the organization’s board. Simpson’s advice was, “What probably can and should happen going forward is for the city to be a more meaningful intervener to help make sure the expectations the community has for 3CDC are more realistic, and that 3CDC becomes more transparent.” [38] A combination of policy and a community coalition is important to give responsibility to both OTR residents and the city government if mobilization and change are to occur.\n\nReferences:\n\n[01] Sing P.
