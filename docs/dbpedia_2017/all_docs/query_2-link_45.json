Quasimodo, the deformed bell-ringer, observes all of Paris reveling in the Feast of Fools, but he is held captive by his devious caretaker, the archdeacon Dom Claude Frollo. He escapes for the day and joins the boisterous crowd, only to be treated cruelly by all but the beautiful gypsy, Esmeralda. Quasimodo isn’t the only one captivated by her free spirit, though — the handsome Captain Phoebus and Frollo are equally enthralled. As the three vie for her attention, Frollo embarks on a mission to destroy the gypsies and it’s up to Quasimodo to save them all. In 1999, the musical premiered as Der Glöckner von Notre Dame in Berlin. Parental discretion is advised. Victor Hugo’s novel contains mature themes and situations, which may be distressing for young viewers.\n\nLocation: Corbett Auditorium\n\nTickets: Purchase tickets online.
