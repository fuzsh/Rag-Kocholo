        "text": "How design is taught in a particular place can be influenced by many factors, and some of them may not be immediately obvious. From local history, geography, economics and politics, to access to natural resources and industry can all have an impact on the design philosophy of a particular school in a particular city or a country. This is why one approach to teaching design may vary markedly from that in another, and both can be perfectly appropriate when used within their own contexts. This is what makes the field of design so diverse and exciting. It is also what makes the leadership of a design school so complex and demanding. Each design school faces a unique set of challenges, problems, and opportunities; but it is the combined contribution of each of these schools that helps define the field of design nationally and globally. The focus of this text is the legacy of one of the oldest university-based design programs in the United States, The Myron E. Ullman, Jr. School of Design at DAAP, University of Cincinnati. By examining the 150-year history of the institution, and reflecting on its present state of affairs, the School Director Gjoko Muratovski sets the tone for the future of one of America's leading design schools.\n\nIn cities across the nation, a few enjoy rising affluence while many struggle to get by. This situation is created in part by the practices of traditional economic development. Current trends threaten to worsen, unless we can answer the design challenge before us. Can we create an economic system—beginning at the local level—that builds the wealth and prosperity of everyone? The 20 cities profiled in this Democracy Collaborative report show the way forward. Economic development professionals and mayors are working in partnership with foundations, anchor institutions, unions, community organizations, progressive business networks, workers, and community residents. What’s emerging is a systems approach to creating an inclusive, sustainable economy where all can thrive. The work is place-based, fed by the power of anchor institutions, and built on locally rooted and broadly held ownership. It’s about building community wealth."
