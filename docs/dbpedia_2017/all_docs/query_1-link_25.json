        "text": "Our Director Dr. Mark Mandell-Brown has over 30 years of experience in plastic surgery. He is one of only 50 United States physicians who is triple board certified in Head and Neck Surgery, Facial Plastic Surgery, and Cosmetic Surgery. He is also one of only five surgeons in the country who has served as President of the largest cosmetic organization, the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery, and as a Board of Trustee for the largest surgery accreditation organization, AAAHC, which promotes safety for surgery centers.\n\nBut most important, he is known for “Natural Look”™ cosmetic surgery and focuses on helping you look better, but not different.\n\nDr. Mandell-Brown and Dr. Gina Maccarone spend time during your consultation understanding your goals and individualizing your plan. Although we can not promise results, we promise that we will strive with all our care and concern to hopefully achieve your goals. Our Before and After gallery speaks for itself, so we hope you will check out our patient results.\n\nWe are proud of our award winning facility, our outstanding staff, and our dedicated physicians. We are also appreciative of our over 300 patients who have posted reviews about their wonderful experience.\n\nWe are also proud of being selected year after year as the “Top Plastic Surgery Practice” in Cincinnati by CityBeat Magazine and Cincinnati Enquirer, as well as “Top Doc “ in plastic surgery by fellow physicians in Cincinnati Magazine.\n\nI am beyond satisfied with my results!\n\n“I am beyond satisfied with my results! I did my research on selecting the right plastic surgeon. Mandell-Brown explains everything so well during the consultation. With other doctors I had checked out I didn’t know the questions to even ask. With Mandell-Brown I always felt super confident and at ease that I was going to get the results that I wanted. He is also very personable and has a great sense of humor. The nurses were all great and made sure I was always comfortable.”\n\nDr. Mandell-Brown is a plastic surgery genius!\n\n“Recently, Dr. Mandell-Brown performed a neck/face-lift on me. The results are amazing! The outcome far exceeded my expectations! Dr. Mandell-Brown is a plastic surgery genius! Words can’t describe how happy I am with the results. I had a LOT of loose, sagging skin and it’s gone. It looks so natural, too! For the first time, I’m taking selfies and I don’t feel the need to “hide” in the back row of a group pic! If you’re considering plastic surgery, don’t do anything until you’ve had a consult with him! You won’t be sorry!!”\n\nI’m very happy with the results of my cosmetic surgery\n\n“Dr. Mark Mandell-Brown and his staff are always pleasant. From the first call to schedule a consultation I was made to feel special, comfortable, and in control. I’m very happy with the results of my cosmetic surgery. The surgical process went flawlessly, and aftercare was handled well. I have nothing but praise for Dr. Mandell-Brown and his staff.”"
