        "text": "about me:\n\nHello there!\n\nMy name is Hailey. Welcome to my website! Whether you’re interested in working with me to document your love story, family or are just browsing through to enjoy some drool-worthy food photos and beautiful homes, it really means a lot that you’re here. I poured a lot of love into this website, just like I do with my work.\n\nPhotography is my passion, but my interest in it goes beyond the creativity that comes with telling stories through images — I love connecting with people. Those real, genuine connections that transcend stiff smiles and uncomfortable small talk — that’s what I’m after.\n\nI want to illuminate the best and most authentic version of you or the work I’m capturing for you.\n\nAs you can see from my portfolio page, I have expertise shooting a wide variety of subjects. I’ve been a professional photographer for the better half of a decade, during which time I’ve grown through education and opportunities that have allowed me to gain experience in everything from food photography to weddings and real estate. I graduated from the University of Cincinnati’s DAAP program in 2016 where I studied Fine Arts with a focus on photography and minored in Marketing. After graduation, I began working as the staff photographer for a Cincinnati-based magazine called CityBeat. Working for this publication was incredibly special, as I had the opportunity to grow as a photographer, writer and editor. In fall of 2021 I left my position at the magazine to focus on my photography business full time.\n\nA little about the gal behind the camera? I am married to my best friend, Nick, and we have two fur children named Arya and Winnie (Arya is the scruffy pup in the photo above). I love to cook with my husband, throw elaborate themed parties with our best friends and travel whenever possible.\n\nI would love to talk to you about your photographic needs and answer any questions you may have. Please fill out the form on my contact page to get the conversation started!"
