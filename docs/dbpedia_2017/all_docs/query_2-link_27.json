        "text": "Lamanai Ruins – The trip begins in Orange Walk with a guided boat ride down the New River with stops to appreciate the unique local birds, plants and hopefully the howler monkeys. The boat then drops you off at the Lamanai Ruins where we have a guided tour and lunch. Those adventurous enough can climb to the top of the tallest ruin and see for hundreds of miles. This trip suggests bringing a rain windbreaker, as a pop-up shower can make this boat ride or at the ruins unpleasant.\n\nSan Pedro – Fly to the town of San Pedro on Ambergris Caye (short 20-minute flight and $100 extra. You can walk, rent a golf cart, taxi, or bicycle to get around. There are only ten streets so do not worry about getting lost. Most people go barefoot or sandals, everywhere. You can swim in the warm Caribbean Sea, which is protected by the reef, or have lunch along the water or chill on a blanket and enjoy the sun. There are numerous options for purchase on the island including snorkeling, scuba, snuba, sport fishing (bone fish or deep-sea), sailing. These are all additional costs. Some of the snorkeling or scuba (Hol Chan Marine Reserve in particular) requires US cash versus credit cards. Don’t miss the last plane back to Mainland or you will have to hire your own water taxi to return."
