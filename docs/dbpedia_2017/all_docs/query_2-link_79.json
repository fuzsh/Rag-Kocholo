        "text": "Thanks to everyone who attended the Town Hall Saturday afternoon! If you missed it, here’s a recap of the news.\n\nWe kicked off January 2024 as the Year of Accountability. Three new directors were hired, the IC Advisory team was created and met in January, and the Performance Support Committee was established. We’ve defined roles & responsibilities, created Q1 goals and reported on those goals through monthly emails.\n\nThe Artistic Department created a new look for advertising and a brand bible. IC’s website is mid-overhaul, including a Performer Resource page. A Coaching Class was held in March and a Hosting Workshop is planned for May 26th. With the tech overhaul, we now record our shows. Rachel can supply teams with a copy, upon request. Our drive will be emptied every 3 months.\n\nThe Education Department updated course syllabuses and began sending them out to each class. IC held a Musical 101 class, and a 201 is coming soon. An IC Teacher’s Summit will be held in June, date TBD. On 4/22 we held DEI training for staff, teachers and coaches on mental/physical disability awareness, and antisemitism awareness will be held 5/19.\n\nSketch Department is celebrating it’s 2nd year.

Anything that can be bought on Fourth Wall: classes, workshops, shows.\n\nIntro Workshops & Classes: We’re missing out on opportunities for concessions. Can we sell any kind of concessions?\n\nReminder: Anyone can contribute drinks to back fridge!\n\nLook into installing water fountain for water bottles by bar.\n\nEric P: Very grateful.\n\nCan we drink before shows? Is that written anywhere? Official rule: Don’t perform buzzed or inebriated. Recommendation to wait until after show to drink. If it’s affecting your performance, you will be pulled.\n\nConsider having teams do Stacked, rather than having a mix of people.\n\nFrequent questions from students: Who will be my next teacher? Where will class be? Is it possible to have that info sooner than it is currently? Seconded.\n\nThanks for having ComedySportz here.\n\nBig news! Our inaugural Mentorship cohort kicked off on Sunday, January 14th, with a crew of 8 Mentorship pairs, from fresh-faced students to seasoned performers.\n\nErin Kessler, our Cohort lead, says, “I’m so incredibly grateful for every Mentor who has joined us for this journey, and proud of all the mentees for trusting us to match them with a Mentor who will help them grow!”\n\nSo, what's in store? Monthly meet-ups, a handy handbook, and a whole lotta laughter!\n\nThe goal? To help up-and-coming improvisers develop their skills and confidence and maybe even discover their own inner mentor!\n\n\"I truly believe in the power of mentorship,\" Erin says. \"This program can be life-changing. That's why we want to pair up as many improv veterans as possible! I challenge the leaders in our community to let their students, teams, and friends know this program exists and encourage them to sign up as Mentors and Mentees.

In case you couldn't make it, no worries—here's the scoop on what went down.\n\nFirst off, we reminded ourselves and each other of our purpose and values, which you can catch up on right here. It's the heartbeat of what we're all about!\n\nWe reminisced some of the amazing highlights since our last get-together:\n\nRemember the Improv Leadership Summit in October? We had a blast hosting over 100 improv geniuses from around the globe right here in Cincinnati! Think big names like Mick Napier from Annoyance Theatre, Coko Galore from Second City's main stage, and Michael Lutton from Magnet Theatre in NYC—it was an epic experience that put IC on the map. There were a whole lot of workshops for the IC community as well as a “campfire conversation” with Mick Napier.\n\nOver the last year we've had visits from so many improv legends like; Susan Messing, John Lehr, Louis Kornfeld, Rich Talarico and more. The energy they brought was infectious and their workshops were game-changing!\n\nOh, and have you seen our snazzy new marquee? It's a beacon in the night, helping us showcase the awesome shows happening each week.\n\nSince April and the inspirational Kitchen Sink Show, we’ve had a whole host of additional, amazing collaborations, including;\n\nThe Pride show🏳️‍🌈\n\nAlphas ♀️\n\nWonderbrain ♾️\n\nDungeons & Drag Queens ⚧️\n\nComedySportz 🏆\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, as a company we’re focusing on mutual accountability. IC Leadership is stepping up and adding new staff and advisors to help keep us accountable and to help us grow in incredible ways:\n\n🌟 Clearly defined roles and responsibilities 🌟 Amped-up efficiency and organization 🌟 Rock-solid internal and external communication 🌟 Checks and Balances 🌟 Diverse input and ideas from our team as well as advisors 🌟 Regular cross-department meetings 🌟 Quarterly goal-setting sessions to keep us on track\n\nWe're shaking things up into five departments:\n\nEducation Team led by Colin Thornton, who's jazzed about bringing back Electives\n\nMarketing Team under Kelly Morton's wing, aiming for top-notch branding consistency\n\nOperations Team headed by Kelly Gruber, focusing on ace internal communication and leadership\n\nArtistic Team co-led by Tone Branson, curating the vibe and developing coaches\n\nImprov Applied Team guided by Jon Ulrich, masterminding corporate team building\n\nThe department heads will meet monthly to collaborate, and keep each other on track with short term and long term goals. Each quarter a bigger advisory group will meet to give perspective, offer feedback, problem solve and ideate. Stay tuned for an infographic to help wrap your head around it all, as well as updates from us on what we’re up to.\n\nMore you say? Yes!

The current free show policy is too complicated. It’s important to us that students see shows, so we’ve overhauled our procedures to reduce the friction. Here’s how it will work…\n\nNo more coupon codes or lining up late for rush tickets.\n\nJust show up (early if you’d like) and tell the box office your name to enter.\n\nEach student receives four tickets for themselves to use for any single IC show (doesn’t include ComedySportz or Alphas). One ticket cannot be used to get an All Evening Pass - that would require two tickets.\n\nFree entry is dependent upon availability.\n\nAUDITIONS! - We have heard the feedback that you want auditions twice a year. The next auditions on Sunday May 21st will be closed to IC graduate teams, 501b students, and invitation only for IC underclassmen. The house teams themselves will be involved in recruiting new players. Sign up here!\n\nNew Merch: We want to make it easier for our community to buy IC merch to their preferences. Now you can order merch from TeePublic web store! Customize your shirts with your own taste for style, fabric, color, etc. You want a blue sweatshirt with IC logo? You got it. You want an IC pillow? You got it.\n\nMeeting Notes\n\nMeet the Team\n\nColin Thornton - Artistic & Education Director (Shows and and classes)\n\nJon Ulrich - Executive Director (Team building)\n\nColette Lindemann - Operations Manager (Theater space)\n\nBrady Dunn - Tech Director (Lights and sound)\n\nKelly Gruber - Administrative Assistant and Lifesaver\n\nTone Branson - Designs\n\nDelmar Davis - Facebook Marketing\n\nTeddy Shivers - New Sketch Program!\n\nAccomplishments since Feb 2022 Town Hall\n\nTheater upgrades:\n\nExterior: New awning and rain drainage mitigation\n\nTheatre Space: New floors, Painted to become a black box theater, new TV for pre-show and in-show content, and new mixtiles photo gallery for house teams and retired teams.\n\nGreenrooms: Progress with organizing/cleaning the utility bathroom and tech closet, and added sound dampening to the back room\n\nShows:\n\nBigtime guests: Bassprov, Susan Messing, Carla Cackowski, The Mayor, EB Byland\n\nCincinnati Night Live - We accomplished the near-impossible task of creating a weekly original sketch comedy show with hosts and musical guests. While the process was a little bumpy, the net result was pretty awesome.\n\nWisenheimer - This is a new collaboration with Esquire Theater where our team of smart asses offer commentary to movies that are deserving of mockery. The next movie to be scorched is Fear of Clowns on Sunday, October 30th at 7:00pm.\n\nOutdoor shows - Thanks to everyone who braved the heat and shared your talents at the plaza.\n\nAuditions = Three new house teams\n\nHalloween shows - Each OG house team is performing a Halloween-themed long form show. Check out Werewolf, Fearscape, and Treachery at the House of Ham this weekend.\n\nCommunity\n\nSix Year Anniversary NYE: COVID couldn’t stop the party. It may have been delayed, but it was awesome.\n\nVolunteer incentive program: All volunteers receive $5 in credit for any IC show, workshop, or class.\n\nReturn of rush tickets: All existing students and performers receive free admission to shows. Ask us if you don’t know how it works.\n\nClasses\n\nPractice teams - One of our values is to provide the skills to succeed, the opportunities to try, and the freedom to fail. Our Practice Team Program allows IC graduates the opportunity for weekly coaching and monthly performances. This program is still in development, but we’re excited to see it grow. We had our first practice team town hall a few months ago.\n\nNew classroom venues - We are back at our original Dramakinetics classroom venue at North Church in Northside (anyone remember Coincidence Improv?). And we are collaborating with Cincinnati Public School for use of their classroom at Fairview-Clifton German Language School.\n\n501B: premise-based long form — a new level that focuses on UCB-style premise-based formats like the Armando and pattern game.\n\nTeam Building\n\nLots! - including special trips to Orlando and DC for 2022 Institute of Supply Management Conference and session w/Capital One Directors\n\nPersonnel\n\nKelly Gruber has been added to provide support with areas of weakness: organization and marketing. She acts as a double-check for all show info, she submits all shows to event pages, she sends out weekly show emails to the newsletter list, and she provides spot help whenever we need it (like hanging the sound proofing curtain in the backroom, and spearheading the runoff mitigation project!). Her next mission is creating “connection posts” to broaden our social media messaging.\n\nColette had a scare with a vicious stomach virus that sent her to the hospital. We’re happy to see her (mostly) recovered, and she’s under orders to never get sick again because she’s invaluable to IC.\n\nBrady Dunn is in the process of adding new software in our tech booth, which will make lighting and sound more efficient and professional. Stay tuned!\n\nUpcoming Changes and Future Plans\n\nImportance of protecting women and minorities - We need to take care of each other onstage. If someone is “walked on” or “walked over” in a scene, bring it up. (Ie, someone starts a scene with an idea. Another performer enters the scene and ignores it or hijacks it.) If you are impacted negatively in a scene this way, a few options provided at the meeting by Tatiana Godfrey:\n\nAcknowledge it happened, continue the scene and not address it further\n\nAcknowledge it happened, continue the scene but say you’d like to discuss later\n\nStop the scene, take a break, discuss when comfortable.\n\nAssume good intentions, but don’t ignore the unintended impact.\n\nDiversity Council - Caleb Robinson, Morgan Christie and DeVon Cunningham have volunteered to lead a new initiative to foster and support diversity. The council’s overall goals will be to increase diversity in the IC community and mainstage shows, and to provide resource and training to keep IC a safe space for everyone. They’re planning to create a workshop on “not punching down” in January. Keep on the lookout for more.\n\nHoliday Show - IC’s annual holiday show is coming! This year’s “Clickbait Christmas” will be written by Chance Kilgour and Elliot Teemley, and directed by Tatiana Godfrey. Auditions are Sunday October 30 from 10am-12:30pm. Learn more and register for auditions here.\n\nSketch Program Rises from Ashes of Mistakes - Colin made some mistakes with CNL (communication and expectations) and Sketch Lab (scheduling snafus and charging for a student show). This mea culpa has made us realize that we need a dedicated Director of Sketch Education. Welcome Teddy Shivers! Teddy has taken almost every sketch and improv class available at every improv theatre in New York City, and he shows an unrivaled passion for sketch comedy. We’re happy to have him join the team. Watch for the new sketch program to begin in January!\n\nNew Swag - We just restocked our black paint splatter t-shirts (they’re slightly softer this time) and we’re also in the process of acquiring new soft sweatshirts and stylish hats. To reserve a sweathirt or hat, click this link.\n\nThe Ups and Downs of the Pandemic - The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been extremely hard on theatres (not to mention everyone else!). Fortunately, IC never let the virus stop our fun. Classes continued with masks. And shows moved outdoors to Clifton Plaza where we reached a wider audience with our new microphones and sound equipment (not to mention free performances!).\n\nThe pandemic also became an opportunity to connect with the international improv community. We continued our Improv Touchstones podcast with incredible guests like Jonathan Mangum from Whose Line Is It Anyway and Dave Pasquesi from Book of Boba Fett. We also had some amazing workshops with Rich Talarico from Key & Peele and improv power couple Rance Rizzutto and Tara DeFrancisco from Columbus.\n\nWe were also very happy to bring on new staff members. Our new stage manager and Queen of CCT is Colette Lindemann. Our new tech director is Brady Dunn. Our new marketing consultant is Delmar Davis. And our new mainstage coaches are Tatiana Godfrey and Chance Kilgour.\n\nShuttering our doors really put a crimp in our annual revenue, but we were very excited and thankful to see our community step up and join our patreon. In addition to receiving quarterly merch, our patrons receive exclusive access to workshops, drop-ins, and free tickets. It’s truly a win-win.\n\nStudent Safety - Our goal in 2021 continues into this year, and that is to improve and enhance our existing student safety protocols and procedures. We know that this is an ongoing process and that we always have opportunities to grow, but we’re happy that so much has been accomplished…\n\nWe clarified and improved our Safe Space Committee process for investigating and resolving reports and revised the “Report a Problem” page.\n\nJon and Colin participated in an online course, specifically geared toward making improv theatres safer.\n\nThe company members attended sexual violence training by Women Helping Women.\n\nWe created a “Bill of Rights” for students and performers, which is now posted in every room at CCT.\n\nGetting Our House in Order: We’ve decided to make Clifton Comedy Theatre our home for a while. That being said, we need to make some upgrades to the space. Here are some of our plans…\n\nA new branded awning\n\nNew lighted signage so people can find us more easily\n\nA new refinished floor - epoxy resin on concrete.\n\nA new paint job in each room of the theatre.\n\nNew photos on the wall\n\nA new tech booth and new bar.\n\nComing Soon! We have some fun ideas for the upcoming year. We’ll be welcoming and announcing special guests. We’ll be having a belated New Year’s Eve (and 6 year birthday) party on April 30th. And we’re planning a variety show in the summer called Cincinnati Night Live with guest hosts, sketches, news segments, and musical acts.\n\nThank you for being a part of our community. As the world thaws from a two year winter and spring into the roaring twenties, we hope you come see a show, take a fun workshop, make some new friends at a 7-week class, or schedule an uplifting and lively team building event. We can’t wait to see you again!\n\nColin & Jon\n\nSam Fisher is a Cincinnatian who moved to Los Angeles a few months after Jon Ulrich relocated to Cincinnati from Baltimore. While Sam was away learning improv at UCB and Westside Comedy, Jon and Colin were creating \"Coincidence Improv\". And while Sam was performing at UCB LA, Second City Hollywood, and IO West, Improv Cincinnati was in the process of becoming an improv hotspot with multiple classes, scripted and unscripted shows, and a thriving community of fun-loving weirdos (that's you LOL).\n\nSam has returned (for the time being), and we're happy to welcome him to the IC family. He's clearly grown and developed as an improviser during his five years away. So, we're giving him all of October to introduce himself to our community...\n\nImprov Drop-In: On Sunday, October 10 6-8pm, Sam will lead a drop-in focused on a format called \"Soundtrack\", in which the scenes are inspired by random songs. As always, participants will receive individual coaching and feedback. Register here.\n\nSupercharge Workshop: On Sunday, October 17 6-8pm, Sam will lead a workshop called \"The Inner Game of Improv\", which will be an approach to game-of-the-scene that is rooted in mindfulness. Register Here.\n\nSecond City Mainstage alum Adam Cawley popped in to the comments on Facebook to say that he wanted to visit Comfort Station, one of America's best bars owned by IC alumni Stuart King. Adam is a working actor living in Los Angeles, so he was only half joking. Or was he? A few hours later, Improv Cincinnati locked in Mr. Cawley for a weekend of workshops and a show. When one of your favorite improvisers says he wants to visit, you extend an invitation. That is the law.\n\nAdam will be teaching a super-sized \"Advanced Armando\" supercharge workshop over two days on June 19 and 20, 9:00am - 12:00pm. Learn how to perform true-story-inspired improv show from an improv legend who writes for television and teaches improv internationally.\n\nRegister immediately at the link above. Or consider subscribing to our patreon to receive opportunities for free and discounted workshops like the one Adam is providing.\n\nOver the past year, most people have personally experienced the mentally unhealthy side effects of social isolation. Reports of depression have tripled since the beginning of the pandemic. When the world returns to normal, everyone will need to find ways to give themselves an infusion of happiness. One potential source of positivity is the joy and friendships that can be found in the improv community. Here are three ways that improv can boost your overall level of happy vibes.\n\nImprov Creates Social Interaction - Some are saying that the post-covid reality will be a continuation of working from home and more meetings through the cold connection of Zoom. People are social creatures; they need the social interaction and bonding they find in lively and interactive communities. In short, togetherness makes us happier.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the fun atmosphere of an improv class encourages friendship and bonding. It’s the same feeling of spiritual renewal that you might get from a yoga class, but with even more interaction between fun-loving strangers from a variety of ages and backgrounds. And not only are these students regularly fueling up their empty tanks of social interactions, they’re also learning tips and tricks that will continue to enhance their social lives outside of class.\n\nResearch done by positivity psychologists Ed Diener and Marty Seligman discovered that people who describe themselves as extremely happy generally had one thing in common: strong social connections. It seems that being around other people is a necessary condition for very high levels of happiness. In fact, loneliness and isolation can be as unhealthy as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. The circumstance of the pandemic has created a worldwide handicap for people achieving their optimal level of happiness. And though many people are doing their best to compensate for their loss of in-person socializing with zoom meetings, the truth is that virtual interactions are an artificial sugar for the true sweetness of socializing in real life.\n\nImprov Helps Us Focus On Others - Before every performance, improvisers will give each other a reassuring tap and say “I got your back”. This simple tradition is significant because each performer is making a promise of mutual support to the other members of their team. One helpful principle of improv is the principle that we should focus less on ourselves and more on our scene partners. Improv is a team sport. Shows are often more successful when everyone appreciates, supports, and wholeheartedly engages with their teammates’ choices.\n\nResearch done by Michael Norton and Liz Dunn reveals that a significant source of happiness is derived from altruism and mutual support. It turns out that charity, volunteering, and tithing offer a long-lasting hit of dopamine. It’s not necessarily the giving of money that makes you feel good, it’s the idea of surrendering your ego to help others. Helping others is good, not only for yourself but also for the people in need. Kindness and empathy are encoded in human DNA because helping the tribe has always been a survival mechanism.\n\nMindfulness One quality of good improv is that the most rewarding scenes are discovered in the moment through active and deep listening. By observing the what, how, and why of their scene partner’s behaviors and words, a curious performer can unlock secrets within the scene that gradually reveal themselves. When improvisers are distracted by anxious thoughts and ruminating on past mistakes, they lose the benefits of being aware and present. Whether you are listening to your scene partner like someone newly in love or like someone who is incredibly paranoid, you’ll find avenues to explore that are enriching and scenically nutritious.\n\nThe biggest villain in the war of staying present are the smartphone devices we keep tethered to our souls. You might even be reading this article on your smart phone. These powerful all-knowing multipurpose devices are small enough to fit in our pockets. By all rights, our phones should be making us happier, but the opposite seems to be true. Research shows that enjoyment of face-to-face social interactions can be undermined simply by leaving your cell phone on the table during dinner. Other research shows that just the presence of a smart phone reduces how much we enjoy spending time with our children. If smartphones are the villains, the hero in this story is mindfulness meditation. Among the many benefits of mindfulness meditation, one benefit is that it offers the true gift of making us happier. Ignoring the distraction of smartphones may be easier said than done, but human well-being is optimized when people lean in to the present moment.\n\nNobody can promise that improv (or anything) can 100% make you happier. The attainment of happiness is complicated simply by the fact that it’s hard to measure and define. However, what we know to be true through scientific studies is that certain things reliably seem to increase happiness: social interaction, prosocial altruism, and eliminating distractions. There are many paths to strengthen these qualities of happier people, but consider improv class as an all-in-one cure to boosting your mood.\n\nBy now, you already know the innumerable ways that 2020 sucked. In the spirit of improv, let’s focus on 2020’s positives and the plans we have for 2021.\n\nOne of our long term goals is to become a Cincinnati comedy destination. IC has always had an awkward charm (and we never want to lose that!), but we felt it was time for the theatre to start dressing for the job we want. That meant several notable improvements. Thanks to 2019’s Kickstarter fundraiser we were able to incorporate:\n\nDedicated ticketing software\n\nNew box office with procedures for house staff volunteers\n\nNew tech booth (nicknamed Locknuts Lindemann) with updated procedures for our tech volunteers, AKA “vibe curators”\n\nNew speakers and microphones\n\nA new modular set design with walls, doors, and windows that are interchangeable.\n\nMore weekly shows and more efficient scheduling.\n\nAnother major 2020 achievement was the creation of a standardized reporting procedure for the safety of our students, performers, and staff. To that end, we created a web page where anyone can make an anonymous report. All reports will be thoroughly investigated by our student safety committee, which is filled with passionate members of the community who care deeply about this topic.\n\nOn the front end, we now ask everyone involved with IC to sign a pledge that defines our culture and expectations. We want improv to be fun and welcoming to everyone. IC has zero tolerance for bigotry and sexual harassment. Pump your fist and say “Hell yes!” if you agree. We’re imagining everyone doing this, and it feels good.\n\nWe’re glad we reached these achievements early in the year because the pandemic then simplified our focus to: keep the theatre alive! We're still in the midst of this mess, but here are five ways we've survived so far\n\nThe Revolution Will Be Zoomified: We switched to performing on Zoom with weekly broadcasts to Twitch and Facebook. Admittedly, the magic is not always the same when improvising over the internet, but our teams made the most of the circumstances by creating new formats and developing creative solutions. Honestly, these performers kept the engine running, and we owe them a huge debt of gratitude. And a huge shout out to Brenden Davis, Josh Elstro, Mark Mascolino, and Tone Branson for producing those shows!\n\nThe wise and lovable Sean Dillon helped us learn improv class can work surprisingly well on Zoom! His weekly drop in class, Zoomtopia, helped spearhead the way for other IC classes to be held online. (Sean also did a bang up job of hosting the recent IC Holiday Party).\n\nIt’s a Small World: We turned the limitations of the pandemic into advantages by connecting our community with world class performers and teachers. We had masters and improv legends on our Zoom stage and in our virtual classroom; these are opportunities we likely would not have had without COVID. Silver lining.\n\nNew Mediums: We launched two new podcasts. Improv Touchstones is an interview podcast with notable Improvisers who talk about their lives and the quality ingredients of good improv. It's pretty cool that we had the chance to interview our heroes. Worth a listen!\n\nYeti Or Not is an audio enhanced improvised performance podcast that is inspired by the discussion of a suggested question. It's a really slick show filled with talented performers. Please subscribe and enjoy.\n\nUncle Sam and Gaslight Properties: We would be in bad shape without the PPP loan and Hamilton County Cares Grant funding. We're thankful for these boosts to our financial morale. We also received much-needed rent reduction from Gaslight Properties. The owners love the idea of a comedy club in Clifton and have treated us very well. Grateful!\n\nNew Faces: OSU (and IC) student, Audrey Neyer, volunteered to be our marketing intern, and we’re pleased as punch. If you notice any new marketing efforts, it’s thanks to Audrey.\n\nThe Community Has IC’s Back: Despite fewer in-person opportunities, we’re still feeling the love from the IC community. We have much to be thankful for - the many students who braved our outdoor, socially-distanced classes. Everyone who attended the regular Friday lunch Zoom calls or watched (or performed in) one of the online shows. The incredibly thoughtful and generous participants in the recent Secret Santa gift exchange. And everyone who has donated money to keep IC going. It’s clear that this community is involved for more than just laughs. You all are the fuel that keeps IC going and we could not have done it without you.\n\nAs we move into 2021, you might be wondering how we will continue to evolve and how you might help. The downtime has made us ponder how to bounce back. Here are some goals…\n\nAn Official Bar - No news to announce, but we thought we might as well speak this goal openly so that it will manifest into reality.\n\nNew Staff - Jon's having a baby, which means we will be needing to hire a Chief of Staff who can keep us organized while Jon focuses on his growing family. He’ll still be working his magic as Executive Director, but we might see less of him for a bit.\n\nPatreon - a monthly membership where your donation becomes a win-win. Your monthly contribution will help IC thrive, and in return, you will receive rewards and benefits like merchandise, monthly workshops, and other exclusives. Check it our here!\n\nWe will get through this together. If you are ever feeling down, just know that we have your back. Improv Cincinnati has become a family where we have a “Yes And” spirit -- this is the way.\n\nOur gratitude,\n\nColin and Jon\n\nWe are seeking your favorite food and drink recipes to be included in this special digital publication.\n\nThis PDF cookbook will be lovingly compiled from your submissions and then made available for sale at a modest price. The sale of this cookbook will help Improv Cincinnati survive and thrive until we can all be together again!\n\nWe are looking for recipes for food and drinks (main dishes, sides, salads, condiments, desserts, cocktails, mocktails, etc.).\n\nWe would also LOVE it if you would include any preparation tips, notes, musings, memories, or stories you have associated with these recipes!\n\nEmail them to Colette Lindemann at cdmarine@gmail.com. Use the subject header \"IC Cookbook.\"\n\nSubmission deadline is July 31. Please submit a maximum of 5 recipes per person."
