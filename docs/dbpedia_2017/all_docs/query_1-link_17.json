Voting is only open until February 1st so we would appreciate it if you would VOTE as soon as you can.\n\nTo VOTE, click here http://vote.citybeat.com/survey-125-best-of-cincinnati-2017.html\n\nYou must vote in 20 categories this year in order for your vote to count. Goodwill’s network of 17 stores is included in the “Shops and Services” category. “Goodwill” is listed under the “Best Thrift Store” category.\n\nThe Voter registration form starts with the following:\n\nWelcome to the 21st annual Best of Cincinnati ® readers choice poll! Your votes will determine the area’s best restaurants, bars, arts organizations, retail stores, services, parks, media personalities, sports teams, politicians, causes and urban experiences.\n\nThe ballot is organized into six major sections: Eats, Shops & Services, Arts & Culture, Nightlife, Sports and City Life. Here are the basic rules: You don’t have to vote in every individual category, but you must vote in at least 20 for your ballot to count. Voting will run through midnight on Wednesday, Feb. 1.\n\nTo get started, enter your name and email address in the Voter Registration area on the landing page. The ballot is pre-populated with top vote-getters from last year, but CityBeat will accept write-in votes in every category. Write-ins won’t be immediately added to the drop-down menus, but we will add any that garner a significant number of votes. Regardless, all write-in votes count toward determining the category winners."
