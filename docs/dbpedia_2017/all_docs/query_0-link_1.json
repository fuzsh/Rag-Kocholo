        "text": "I hope the tabloid Enquirer holds current subscribers and attracts new readers, especially folks who are drawn more to the visual than the verbal.\n\nPublisher Margaret Buchanan promises its debut Monday. Trucks will bring it from Columbus, where it’ll be printed on Dispatch presses.\n\nFormat doesn’t change function: News is a way to deliver readers to advertisers.\n\nThe new format is transitional from traditional print to online; Gannett is just waiting for older readers who are wedded to print to die.\n\nYounger readers — including the not-so-young Boomers by the time the rest of us are buried with a final edition — will read about the death of the daily “paper” online.\n\nThink of the tabloid Enquirer as training wheels for when it’s online or nothing, the glorious day when the publisher needn’t buy paper by the roll or ink by the barrel and skilled printers and pressmen will become redundant.\n\nMeanwhile, Cincinnatians maintain the American tradition of pissing and moaning about the local daily, often adding proudly, “I don’t read the Enquirer.” To paraphrase a World War II cartoon by Bill Mauldin, “If you can find a better foxhole (or paper) go to it.”\n\nHere, there is no better foxhole . . . or news hole. The Enquirer’s franchise is local news. Hire more reporters; we can get national and international news online.\n\nThe tabloid Enquirer will be new to Cincinnati, but the format is a staple of the news industry: small page, big graphic or photo, screaming headline, maybe an ad across the top and/or bottom and a little bit to read. Inside, it’s a little less dramatic, but the emphasis remains on bold headlines and illustrations instead of breath-taking storytelling.\n\nThe Enquirer has been practicing some of this in the current format, already narrower than the traditional broadsheet. It’s tabloid writ large. Now, the staff need only to add tight, bright writing and editing.\n\nMeanwhile, despite the endless jeremiad about the future of newspapers, billionaire Warren Buffett appraised the Internet-diminished newspaper industry for his Berkshire Hathaway stockholders. It’s a warning and complement to what the Enquirer says it hopes to accomplish. I’m grateful to romenesko.com for a copy of Bu-ffett’s letter. Here are excerpts:\n\n“I love newspapers and, if their economics make sense, will buy them. … We do not believe that success will come from cutting either the news content or frequency of publication. Indeed, skimpy news coverage will almost certainly lead to skimpy readership. And the less-than-daily publication that is now being tried in some large towns or cities — while it may improve profits in the short term — seems certain to diminish the papers’ relevance over time. …\n\n“Newspapers continue to reign supreme in the delivery of local news. If you want to know what’s going on in your town — whether the news is about the mayor or taxes or high school football — there is no substitute for a local newspaper that is doing its job. … (P)eople will seek their news — what’s important to them — from whatever sources provide the best combination of immediacy, ease of access, reliability, comprehensiveness and low cost. …\n\n“Wherever there is a pervasive sense of community, a paper that serves the special informational needs of that community will remain indispensable to a significant portion of its residents. ... (P)apers delivering comprehensive and reliable information to tightly bound communities and having a sensible Internet strategy will remain viable for a long time. …\n\n“Our goal is to keep our papers loaded with content of interest to our readers and to be paid appropriately by those who find us useful, whether the product they view is in their hands or on the Internet. …\n\n“At appropriate prices — and that means at a very low multiple of current earnings — we will purchase more papers of the type we like. … During the past 15 months, we acquired 28 daily newspapers at a cost of $344 million. …\n\n“Berkshire’s cash earnings from its papers will almost certainly trend downward over time. Even a sensible Internet strategy will not be able to prevent modest erosion. At our cost, however, I believe these papers will meet or exceed our economic test for acquisitions. Results to date support that belief.”\n\nFinally, Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway will not continue the operation of any business doomed to unending losses. One daily paper was significantly unprofitable. He says he reluctantly shut it down. “All of our remaining dailies, however, should be profitable for a long time to come.”\n\nCURMUDGEON NOTES:\n\n•\n\nThe satirical website, The Onion, added kiddie porn to the Academy Awards. It tweeted about the 9-year-old Oscar nominee for Best Actress: “Everyone else seems afraid to say it, but that Quvenzhané Wallis is kind of a cunt, right? #Oscars2013.” Miss Wallis was nominated for Best Actress in Beasts of the Southern Wild . Traditional and new media exploded with contempt but few spelled out the “C-word.” Most offered the first letter and asterisks: C***. The Onion took down the tweet in about an hour and Onion CEO Steve Hannah crawled back on Facebook. He wrote, in part, “I offer my personal apology to Quvenzhané Wallis . . . for the tweet that was circulated last night during the Oscars. It was crude and offensive . . . No person should be subjected to such a senseless, humorless comment masquerading as satire.” Hannah wrote that “We have instituted new and tighter Twitter procedures to ensure that this kind of mistake does not occur again. In addition, we are taking immediate steps to discipline those individuals responsible. “Miss Wallis, you are young and talented and deserve better. All of us at The Onion are deeply sorry.”\n\n•\n\nCiao, papa vecchio. Viva il papa nuovo! Did anyone else notice that Benedict was driven to his helicopter in German cars? I didn’t recognize one macchina italiana among the black sedans. At the helicopter, a papal aide belted Pope Emeritus into his passenger seat. He knows the drill; Benedict is a licensed pilot who has piloted a chopper from the Vatican City to the summer villa at Castel Gandolfo. He left this flight to the Italian Air Force. CBS followed Benedict’s chopper from liftoff to arrival in suburban Castel Gandolfo about 15 miles southeast of Vatican City. Boring video. Really boring. Obviously, CBS feared missing something if anything went wrong. It’s the same reason the press travels with the president...\n\n•\n\nUnless Benedict really wants to live out his days in the Vatican City, why would he leave Castel Gandolfo? That lovely Alban Hills town was a favorite for long lunches when I worked in Rome: a great view over Lago Albano, wonderful pollo al diavolo and fresh trota.\n\n•\n\nMost Cincinnatians don’t read the Enquirer . They never did. However, they often are affected by reporters watchdogging government and businesses that rarely appreciate the attention. In recent years, no one was better at this vital First Amendment function than the Enquirer ’s Barry Horstman. His coverage of the Cincinnati city pension fiasco and other issues was vital to public awareness. He died last week after a heart attack in the newsroom. Barry was a good man and a fine reporter. When then-editor Tom Callinan hired Barry despite a chill on new hires, it was a coup. The city gained a seasoned investigative reporter who understood the necessity of depth in reporting and writing; quickie stories don’t suffice when public millions are involved. After Barry’s memorial service, Callinan told me, “\n\nIt was an important message to the staff that while we may have fewer people we will have the best. He was that and more.”\n\n•\n\nRandy Mazzola and Julie Irwin Zimmerman have returned to the Enquirer . I’ve worked with both; it’s good news. Randy is a talented graphic artist. If the new tabloid format is to work, visuals are vital. Julie is a fine reporter and writer. At different times, we both covered religion.\n\n•\n\nI’ll never understand the news media fuss about snow storms in the Plains states and Midwest. It’s winter. Snow happens. Plows clear streets. Kids slide. Image-hungry TV is the worst. They just don‘t get it. Sort of like Cincinnatians who try to drive up Straight or Ravine streets or West Clifton Avenue after an inch of snow. Those of us who grew up with snow storms expect traffic snarls. We keep warm stuff in the trunk in case we must drive but get stuck. We mumble, “I am not going to die of a heart attack shoveling snow.” Then we shovel. Or hope a neighbor kid tackles the job.\n\n•\n\nFarmers love snow. It melts and nourishes their crops, replenishes their wells and waters their cattle. Blizzards can kill but drought is worse. This by AP via the London Guardian: “Meteorologist Mike Umscheid of the National Weather Service office in Dodge City, Kansas, said this latest storm combined with the storm last week will help alleviate the drought conditions that have plagued farmers and ranchers across the Midwest, and could be especially helpful to the winter wheat crop planted last fall. But getting two back-to-back storms of this magnitude doesn't mean the drought is finished. ‘If we get one more storm like this with widespread two inches of moisture, we will continue to chip away at the drought, but to claim the drought is over or ending is way too premature,’ Umscheid said.”\n\n•\n\nI don’t know the laws governing public records in South Africa, but two inexplicably tardy news stories suggest that inattentive reporters were dazzled by the premeditated murder charge against the Olympic gold medal winner Oscar Pistorius. He’s the double amputee sprinter and that nation’s most famous living athlete. It took days after Pistorius shot his girlfriend to report that Hilton Botha, chief police investigator and disgraced star witness at Pistorius’ bail hearing, already was charged with seven counts of attempted murder arising from a traffic stop. Botha reportedly shot at the van and its seven occupants and his bosses took him off the case when the attempted murder charge made news. Still later, reporters told us that Oscar Pistorius’ brother Carl faced imminent trial, charged with unlawful negligent killing/culpable homicide after his car collided with a female motorcyclist.\n\n•\n\nThe Oscar Pistorius murder case is perfect for the American news media: hero athlete killer, lovely blonde victim. Oh, we’ve done that story. Here’s a different angle for reporters: releasing Pistorius on bail wasn’t a race issue; it’s what happens in almost any country where a rich and famous person hires the best legal defense possible. Oh, we’ve done that story. Repeatedly.\n\n•\n\nPistorius is white, but even in race-conscious South Africa, fame and cash can speak louder than color. If you doubt me, look up the criminal record of Jacob Zuma, a black man and a longstanding leader in the ruling African National Congress. A South African judge acquitted him of rape in 2006, saying the unprotected sex was consensual. In 2005 and again in 2007, Zuma was charged with corruption, racketeering and tax evasion. Prosecutors dropped charges, saying political interference fatally tainted their case. Zuma was elected president of South Africa in 2009.\n\n•\n\nI love a good hoax and \"Golden Eagle Snatches Kid\" on YouTube was delicious. Reactions illustrate the credulity of old and new media and people who believe what they see/read online.\n\nBuzzFeed.com\n\nfreelancer Chris Stokel-Walker said the video got “17 million views within a day, just shy of 42 million views in total, 14 million minutes in viewing time in the U.S. alone, embedded on major news websites\n\nworldwide\n\n, broadcast on morning talk shows and linked from countless message boards — which proved this in historically impressive style.” Stokel-Walker traced the hoax to Professor Robin Tremblay’s video-effects class at Centre NAD, a technology university in Montreal. “In October, he challenged his students — as he did the previous two semesters — to make a viral hoax video. If it got more than 100,000 views, then congratulations, you got an A.” Four students created \"Golden Eagle Snatches Kid.\" Twenty minutes after showing the video to their class, they uploaded it to YouTube and adjourned to a local bar. Meanwhile, Portuguese teenager Tiago Duarte spotted the hoax. \"It looked so fake to me,\" he told Stokel-Walker. \"The main thing that gave it away was the baby falling down. It really looked like a 3-D model to me.\" He went online and \"every single person was believing it, and the top comment at the time was something like, 'If you want to say this is fake, you better provide some proof.' So I did.\" Stokel-Walker said “it took the 17-year-old less than five hours to debunk a month-and-a-half's worth of work. Duarte used his video editing skills, uploaded his version of \"Golden Eagle Snatches Kid\" to YouTube and proved his point.\n\n•\n\nUnintended effects of a helter-skelter search for cheaper health care can be deadly, as British news media have revealed. In a reality that recalls Sarah Palin’s fantasy “death panels,” the British government is paying incentives to hospitals to reduce the number of beds occupied by the terminally ill. One response is for physicians to hurry patients into the hereafter by withdrawing nourishment, hydration and medical treatment. Without intended irony, Brits call this lethal option Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP). Revelations are beyond sensational. Here’s part of a National Health Service press release: “The LCP is intended to allow people with a terminal illness to die with dignity. But there have been a number of high-profile allegations that people have been placed on the LCP without consent or their friend’s or family’s knowledge. Concerns have also been raised about hospitals receiving payments for increasing the number of patients who are placed on the LCP . . . (A)s we have seen, there have been too many cases where patients were put on the pathway without a proper explanation or their families being involved.” Worse, some patients or families didn’t give required permission.\n\n•\n\nLondon’s Daily Mail, among those most actively pursuing the Liverpool Care Pathway story (above), wrote Sunday that:\n\n“Leading doctors have claimed NHS patients are being routinely placed on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway by out-of-hours medics who are ‘strangers’ who have never been involved in their care. The claims suggest patients are often left to die on . . . ‘bedside evidence’ alone and without fully understanding the patients’ condition or medical history.\n\n“The LCP has been the subject of much debate since it was introduced in the 1990s. More than 130,000 people are put on it each year but it was revealed in December 60,000 patients die on the procedure each year without giving their consent. “Concerns have been raised that clinical judgments are being skewed by incentives for hospitals to use the pathway. Health trusts (that run National Health Service hospitals) are thought to have been rewarded with an extra £30million ($45m) for putting more patients on the LCP. Critics say it is a self-fulfilling prophecy because there is no scientific method of predicting when death will come.”\n\n•\n\nHere’s a story that any reporter could do: did the advent of ubiquitous urban and suburban school busing — for whatever reasons — cause or coincide with the explosion of K-12 obesity? News media are full of obesity stories bemoaning fat Americans and blaming everything from school lunches, fat, salt and sugar to oversize portions of everything. Maybe, just maybe, it has more to do with the end of walking or biking to school.\n\n•\n\nDeath cafes aren’t Starbucks spinoffs where philosophers and others have spirited conversation as they sip soy milk hemlock lattes. (Gift cards are one-use only.) Rather, death cafes are where people can talk about what comes next. This growing movement appears to be news to Cincinnati-area news media. Huffington Post tipped me to Columbus, Ohio, leadership in the U.S. death cafe movement. Here’s some of what HuffPost and others reported: Ohioans met on a Wednesday evening in a community room at a Panera Bread near Columbus for tea, cake and conversation “over an unusual shared curiosity. For two hours, split between small circles and a larger group discussion, they talked about death: How do they want to die? In their sleep? In the hospital? Of what cause? When do they want die? Is 105 too old? Are they scared? What kind of funerals do they want, if any? Is cremation better than burial? And what do they need accomplish before life is over? Organizer Lizzy Miles says the latest gathering included new and previous attendees plus a public radio reporter. “I set the ground rules. No recording during the Death Café. He had to participate as a regular guy. Then afterwards, we would ask for volunteers as to who would be willing to talk for radio. Several people volunteered and we had a mini Death Café discussion . . . I felt he did a good job of capturing the essence of the Death Café in his WOSU broadcast, ‘Columbus Death Cafe concept Spreads Across the U.S’.”"
