        "text": "spotlight series: midcentury materials, brands & accoutrement\n\nchapter 1 – vitrolite\n\nIt’s not just the time that makes the look of a particular era. It’s as much the slate of materials available as it is the design(ers) and craftsman that put it all together. Imagine the amazing midcentury modern structures that could be built now with the advances in roofing materials coupled with craftsmanship of the days of yore….but I digress.\n\nOne of our favorite materials to run across in early to mid 20th century structures is Vitrolite, a pigmented structural glass usually found in panels or large flat tiles. Think of it as the forerunner of the early 2000’s glass tile backsplashes, but in a larger format with a deeper opacity and a more brilliant sheen. This high strength material was developed in the United States in 1900 and was used widely around the world in Art Deco and Streamline (Art) Moderne buildings. It is seen locally in Cincinnati in some of our finer midcentury bathrooms, obviously a favorite material of architects. Originally marketed under the names Carrara glass, Sani Onyx and Vitrolite, the trademarked name Vitrolite eventually became the generic term for the material.\n\nNot going to lie – I geek out every time I see a house that has it, usually in a well preserved vintage bathroom. My mind immediately goes back to the time when the house was being built, and the difficult decision that must have been made to use the pricier structural glass over the cheaper and more readily available ceramic tile. I may have let out an audible squeal when Arlen and I first walked though our most recent Cincymod Project House (currently on the market for the next lucky owner). The deco era Craftsman/Tudor hybrid had the most stunning celadon colored Vitrolite bath. With one major flaw.\n\nSeems the previous owner, Miss Martha (bless her heart), had a bit of a plumbing issue with the shower, and came up with a ‘fix’ of plywood and contact paper. How to save this gorgeous bathroom (and the Vitrolite tile) and make it not only functional, but like it could be original to this 1920’s house? I recalled a gorgeous Art Moderne house near Ault Park that was on the market years ago whose stunning original baths had Streamline and Deco motif patterns in the tile. Could I design something similar? A skyscraper motif might do it? Hmm… a Famous deco era skyscraper…..\n\nArmed with inspiration, I carefully measured and drew out what I wanted to accomplish. Our contractor carefully salvaged and moved the Vitrolite to fill in the gaps and added black ceramic subway tile. And voila! My very own Carew Tower tile bath surround.\n\nSaved the vitrolite (and the vintage Kohler tub) ✅\n\nMade a cool deco inspired bath that functions well in the 21st Century ✅\n\nMission accomplished!\n\nMore info on this wonder material makes me wonder why it is no longer manufactured.\n\nIn its day Vitrolite was widely used for: countertops, bathroom partitions, storefront signs, refrigerator lining and cladding (lobbies, storefronts, entryways, and even ceilings – any application to make an old building look “modern”).\n\nby the 1930’s, pigmented structural glass could be made translucent with more than 30 colors available, and even in marble like color patterns. Black glass could be silvered to give it a reflective finish. It could be manufactured in flat panels or curves and in a wide range of sizes and thicknesses. They also found that it could be carved, cut, inlaid, laminated, sandblasted and sculpted to create a wide range of finished and textures. When translucent it could be illuminated from within.\n\nUnlike masonry, structural glass does not craze, swell or warp. It is highly burn and stain resistant, is impervious to moisture and cannot absorb any bacteria.\n\nAt the height of its popularity, it was manufactured by 8 different companies. But the Great Depression greatly reduced demand and by 1960, all domestic manufacturers ceased production. There was still a company in Germany that made it until the end of the 20th century.\n\nNow, if you do run across it, it is your responsibility to save it and cherish it!"
