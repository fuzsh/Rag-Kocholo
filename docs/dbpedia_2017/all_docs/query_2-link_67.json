        "text": "Written by Kiersten Wones with additional research by Janet Chu, Sara Skaggs, and Chelsie Walter. Photography by Chelsie Walter. All photos that show protestors’ faces were taken with permission from each individual during a peaceful demonstration.\n\nAs I knelt in the front line of the crowd and everyone around me chanted, “Hands up; don’t shoot,” I was struck by the simple privilege of being able to reach into my pocket for my phone while staring the police in the eye. I was part of a barrier of white people called forward to shield our Black cohorts – despite the fact that it was 1:30 in the afternoon and the event had been peaceful so far.\n\nAs white folks are called forward to literally place our bodies in defense of the oppressed Black community, the question on our minds shouldn’t be, “Has it really come to this?” but rather, “How the hell did we let it get this far?”\n\nAnd more importantly: “What are we going to do about it?”\n\nSaige Smith, a recent high school graduate, asked the crowd: “What will you do once you leave this protest?”\n\nThis particular event was Monday, June 1, in front of the Hamilton County Courthouse, but I took her directive and spent the week asking folks on the ground and on social media: What specific, actionable change do you want to see in this city? Solidarity is lovely. Protesting is powerful. But I wanted to know what further actions are required to see our city change.\n\nHere’s a collection of the community’s answers. Note that these are paraphrased, edited, and combined for clarity, but all represent direct viewpoints from those I interviewed at protests and via social media, and/or demands published by protesters around the city. (See *The Ohio Justice & Policy Center and the Cincinnati Black United Front’s “Protests and the Pandemic: Recommendations for a More Equitable Cincinnati” and **protesters’ “The Demands of the People of Cincinnati.”)\n\nI hope these protests represent progress, action, real change – but change doesn’t come easily, or quickly. I hope you feel like it’s time to do something – and understand that everyone holds an important role in a movement like this: the organizers, the protesters, the caretakers, the storytellers, the teachers, the donors. Do not think your role is more or less than another’s; do not waste energy looking sideways when we must look forward. Here are some things you can do...\n\n...on your feet:\n\nVigil Against Police Violence, every day, 6 p.m.\n\nWomen in Heels Peaceful March, Saturday, June 6, 12 p.m.\n\nThe Path Forward: Creating Our Vision in Cincinnati, Saturday, June 6, 4 p.m.\n\nCincinnati March for Racial Justice, Sunday, June 7, 1 p.m.\n\nMason Black Lives Matter Peaceful March, Saturday, June 13, 1 p.m.\n\nProtesters also need water, sunscreen, masks, gloves, snacks, first aid, and more. Can’t march? Swing by and drop off supplies.\n\n...with your voice:\n\nCheck out this local advocacy guide with contact info and email templates for Cincinnati Police, Cincinnati City Council, Ohio state representatives, and more.\n\nExplore statements and motions made by the following folks and organizations and let them and people in power know what you think:\n\nCity Council Motion (Councilmembers Jan-Michele Lemon Kearney, Greg Landsman, Chris Seelbach, P.G. Sittenfeld, and Wendell Young)\n\nCouncilmember P.G. Sittenfeld\n\nCincinnati Public Schools\n\nUniversity of Cincinnati President Neville Pinto\n\nWomen Helping Women\n\nUrban League of Greater Southwestern Ohio\n\nHamilton County sheriff candidate Charmaine McGuffey\n\nReginald Harris, director of Community Life at Community Builders\n\nTimm T. West, senior managing director of L.G.B.T.Q. Community Initiative at Teach For America\n\nSpeak up at Cincy Nice’s Community Vent Line\n\nSigning local and national petitions like Color of Change and the Hands Up Act\n\n...with your money:\n\nDonate to the Cincinnati Bail Fund\n\nShop local Black businesses – check out the City of Cincinnati’s directory and these lists from The Voice of Black Cincinnati, Mortar, CityBeat, and Cincinnati Magazine\n\nSupport local media outlets and organizations that elevate Black voices: The Cincinnati Herald, The Voice of Black Cincinnati, CityBeat, WVXU, Women of Cincy (yes, that’s us), Greater Cincinnati Association of Black Journalists, and more\n\nSupport minority entrepreneurs and donate to Mortar\n\nSupport Black teen mothers and donate to Rosemary’s Babies\n\nStream YouTube videos and channels that are donating their AdSense money\n\n...by educating yourself:\n\nWork to understand the context of racism in Cincinnati; for starters, try CityBeat’s “Unrest in O.T.R.: 15 Years Later” and “That Which Divides Us”\n\nReview our city’s current Collaborative Agreement and consider its shortcomings\n\nWork through these lists of books, articles, films, and trainings on race, racism, history, and more from: Greater Cincinnati Foundation, Women Helping Women, Cincinnati Public Library, Blavity\n\nThis article will continue to be updated at least once a week to the best of my ability. Please feel free to fill out this form to contribute ideas, demands, resources, and needs and we will work to review and add those in.\n\nI want to leave a reminder that the issue of police accountability is barely the tip of the iceberg when it comes to fighting racism: For example, just Thursday, Hamilton County announced it would restart eviction hearings a month earlier than expected – a move we know will disproportionately affect our city’s Black families.\n\nThis article, these lists are far from comprehensive. I am no expert; I am not perfect. I’m a pissed off girl who’s very active on Twitter, who has some very trusted friends here in Cincinnati, who’s passionate about justice and putting your money where your mouth is, and who’s also trying really hard to keep her 5-year-old alive and maybe occasionally get the dishes done. Each of you has your own passions, skills, shortcomings, and obstacles. But together, we can get things done if we are focused, diligent, determined, and honest. I’ll leave you with these words from Klarke Griffith, a recent high school graduate and co-organizer of Monday’s protest:"
