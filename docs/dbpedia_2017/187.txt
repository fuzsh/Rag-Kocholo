History

CityBeat was founded in November 1994. It was backed by local entrepreneur Thomas Schiff and co-founded by John Fox, who left his editor position at Everybody's News (at that point Cincinnati's only print source for independent news) to start the paper. CityBeat has won numerous national, statewide and local journalism and design awards, most recently being named Best Weekly Paper in the state of Ohio in 2005 by the Society of Professional Journalists.
