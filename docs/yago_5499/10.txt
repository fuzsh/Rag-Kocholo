This postcard is the latest from this interesting building. The movie Sonnenallee came to German cinemas on October 7, 1999. It was directed by Leander Haußmann after a novel by Thomas Brussig and tells about a youth in East Berlin in the late 1970s. The Sonnenallee is an actual street in Berlin that was intersected by the border between East and West during the time of the Berlin Wall, although it bears little resemblance to the film set.

On the large poster you can see Detlev Buck as an East German policeman. His 1993 movie Wir können auch anders ... is one of the best German movies about the situation in East Germany in the early 1990s. And I remember children clapping after his excellent children movie Hände weg von Mississippi.

At all it is a set of three postcards, advertising postcards publishing by the Yorck Kinogruppe - owner and co-owner of different cinemas in Berlin and Dresden. It is an interesting view outwards to the Café Moskau, it is so often on the postcards together with Kino International.

Thanks for this good idea! (And my wish for the next time: More people on the postcards.)
