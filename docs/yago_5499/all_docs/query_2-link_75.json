This it?\n\nJust take a look at that!\n\nSo we're off again?\n\nYes. Cheeri off you go.\n\nShould we look for something else?\n\n- I wouldn't know what.\n\nWe saw that old car.\n\nShould we take a closer look at it?\n\nOld car? Where?\n\nCorner of BIschestrae and\n\nMyliusgarten.\n\nIf you must. Have a look.\n\nSo what was it,\n\na circular saw?\n\nCircular saw? Underwater?\n\nWhere'd it get the electricity?\n\nIt takes 380 volts.\n\nYou won't get that underwater.\n\nI know something about this.\n\nI made honor films\n\nin New York.\n\nA circular saw gives a straight cut,\n\nnot a ragged mess like this.\n\nD'you want this back?\n\nNope. Too late.\n\nI've got the new one now.\n\nIt's a good one.\n\nIf it wasn't a circular saw,\n\nwhat was it?\n\nWhatever it was,\n\nit's still out there, I reckon.\n\nPerhaps now we should consider\n\nthe city's marketing point of view.\n\nThere are three possibilities\n\nof dealing with this situation\n\nwith the city's branding in mind:\n\na) we issue a shark alarm\n\nor b) we carry on as before\n\nc) no one goes in the water\n\nbut in a positive way.\n\nAny questions?\n\nWhat I don't get is,\n\nif we carry on as before,\n\nwhat use is that to us?\n\nYou mean b)?\n\n- Yes, b).\n\nThat's plan b) and doesn't come\n\ninto question, yet.\n\nI like shark alarm.\n\nThat's a).\n\nShark alarm?\n\nJust for my hand?\n\nThen c).\n\nOr d).\n\n- d) doesn't exist.\n\nAnd who are you exactly?\n\nI am the Fish Expert\n\nfrom Humboldt University.\n\nI've been called up.\n\n- Not by me.\n\nNo, by my wife,\n\nbut that's another story.\n\nWhat I wanted to say was:\n\nd) someone catches the carp.\n\n- Carp? I thought it was a shark.\n\nCarp doesn't work.\n\nIt has no traction\n\nmarketing-wise.\n\n- It's a Bighead Carp.\n\nThey bite?\n\n- No.\n\nYes, well...\n\nthe Bighead Carp\n\nis a sociable, freshwater fish\n\nfrom the carp family\n\nthat came from Asia in the '60s\n\nThen I'm for c).\n\n- Me too.\n\nWhat was c) again?\n\nC):\n\nNo one goes in the water,\n\nbut positive!\n\nHooold on!\n\nWhat's this nun?\n\nJust look at you!\n\nIs this a gay parade or what?\n\nGot something against gays?\n\n- Got something against gays?\n\nWhat, me? Against gays?\n\nWould I have a hand like this\n\nif I had something against gays?\n\nWhat are you doing there,\n\nMrs Schneider? - I'm swimming.\n\nThat's not good. Better come out.\n\n- Why is that not good?\n\nI'm not saying that in a bad sense,\n\nI mean it positively!\n\n- I've been doing this for 60 years,\n\nOfficer Mller!\n\n- Won't you let me finish?\n\nDo I have to be constantly interrupted?\n\nWhat's that?\n\n- Bathing's...!\n\nI don't hear so well with\n\nthis bathing hat.\n\nBathing is not good!\n\nWater isn't good for you!\n\nWhy isn't it good?\n\n- It isn't now.\n\nDo I have to explain everything?\n\n- Yes please!\n\nIt's because water really\n\ndoesn't solve the problem.\n\nWhat problem is that then?\n\n- Can't a man talk in peace?\n\nCan't a man follow a complex train\n\nof thought to its logical conclusion?\n\nJust how often is it not true that\n\nthe decisive thought\n\ndoesn't arrive at the exact\n\nmoment of formulation?\n\nGay is not only not bad, gay is good,\n\nas I've always said.\n\nThat's it, and so it will remain,\n\nmy friend.\n\nI just don't know why it shouldn't\n\nalso be good to be straight,\n\nbut there you go these days\n\nyou can be as gay as you want.\n\nHey! You there!\n\nPet's comer!\n\nThe skin suffers.\n\nThe skin suffers terribly.\n\nAsk a dermatologist.\n\nI've been doing this for 60 years,\n\nevery day,\n\nwhether Nazis or Communists.\n\nNow look at your skin,\n\nMrs Schneider:\n\nwrinkles everywhere!\n\nI actually wanted to get out\n\na while ago,\n\nbut now I'll swim a bit more.\n\nJust for you.\n\nBefore, everyone thought\n\nall lifeguards were gay,\n\njust because we're so good looking,\n\nbut there you go why not,\n\nit's all the same to me.\n\nCan we go in the water nun?\n\nThe question is something"
