        "text": "As a kid, Steffen Wink dreamed of becoming an inventor like Gyro Gearloose. He consequently enrolled at an engineering school to receive vocational training there. His German teacher -assigning an analysis of the play Andorra by Max Frisch- prompted a change of direction for Steffen Wink. Steffen delved deeply into the play entirely relating to the character of \"Andri\". This experience ultimately caused the change in his professional trajectory. Determined to become an actor, he first acted for a year in school plays at the Kammerspiele Frankfurt along with other young ambitious students. He then applied successfully for acting school in Berlin for a study period of eight semesters. The director at the Residenztheater München, Eberhard Witt, offered him a contract of two years after graduation from acting school. During that time at the Resi, he collaborated with the likes of Leander Haußmann and Amélie Niermeyer. He cites feeling uncomfortable in closed and dark rooms and also not being able to see the light of day there as easily comprehensible reasons for leaving the theater as a workplace. Besides, only a fool would have turned down offers to play leading roles in Maja or Coming In and also working for Doris Dörrie in Bin ich schön? and opposite Fatih Akin in Black Souls. His most prominent roles so far were the recurring sidekick Schrader opposite Götz George in the long-lived TV series Schimanski and in the TV mini-series called Les Miserables opposite John Malkovich and Gérard Depardieu. Additionally he got the leading role in the movie Die Quellen des Lebens of the well-known director Oskar Roehler."
