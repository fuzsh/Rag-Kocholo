        "text": "The Sonnenallee is a real street in Berlin with the loveliest of names: “Boulevard of the Sun”. The “short end” of the boulevard, to which the title of Thomas Brussig’s novella refers, is the one that ended up on the wrong – that is to say, the Eastern – side of the Berlin Wall, protruding tragically from West Berlin into the Soviet Zone.\n\nThe Short End of the Sonnenallee, about a group of teenagers living in and around the boulevard, was published in 2001. That was a couple of years after a film of the same title, based on his screenplay and featuring the same characters, had been released in Germany. The film and book were conspicuous examples of the curious phenomenon of “Ostalgie”. The word refers, roughly, to a widely felt nostalgia for the days before the Wall came down, days spent in the painful awareness of just how much was denied to East Berliners that the lucky citizens of the West took for granted.\n\nThis book, for some reason never previously translated into English, has found an influential champion in the American novelist Jonathan Franzen. Franzen’s collaboration with Jenny Watson, an academic scholar of German, has produced an airy, cheerful translation that delivers on everything Franzen’s introduction promises. Brussig’s Berlin, Franzen writes, is “neither a dystopia nor a utopia”. It is, simply, one more place for human beings to be human – and more specifically, for teenagers to be teenagers. It plays the sorry situation of its teenagers – living so close to the Wall that they can hear the voices of western gawkers even while aware they may never get to visit them – as gentle comedy.\n\nImprobably, Brussig avoids most of the usual clichés: Coca Cola isn’t mentioned once, and the Stasi, although ubiquitous, appear in the guise of officious neighbours, not strangers in black coats. He leaves us in no doubt about the evils of the GDR regime, but treats that regime in a tone of irony so forgiving that one is tempted to forget in which year the book was published and assume that he must be trying to get around an official censor.\n\nTheirs is a world in which a misdemeanour at school will result in the students having to deliver self-abasing lectures on their ideological crimes, with titles such as “What Quotations from the Classical Authors of Marxism-Leninism Have to Say to Us Today”. One cheeky boy, invited by his school sports coaches to train for Olympic cycling, replies, “Training’s not my thing. Pole-vaulting’s as far as I’ll go.” But why pole-vaulting of all things? “Because it means practicing clearing three meters forty-five,” he replies, to bemused coaches who don’t seem aware of the significance of that number: the height of the Wall.\n\nNo one, Brussic tells us, “was permitted to sail or to surf on the Baltic. Kites and paragliding were likewise forbidden, lest anyone have ideas of flying to the West from a high-rise near the border.” Yet, Brussig’s teenage boys don’t spend their days fantasising about escape to the free, decadent West; their days are filled, as the days of their real-life counterparts must have been, with thoughts of girls and rock ’n’ roll albums.\n\nVisiting relatives from the other side bring them Western goods, at considerable personal risk, and the teenagers obsessively record songs onto audio cassettes from Western radio stations. As Franzen nicely puts it, “they may be continually deprived, but the texture of their daily lives is paradoxically one of fullness. In their scavenging and resourceful way, they experience the West more vividly, and appreciate it more deeply, than Westerners themselves do.”\n\nOne character, a girl only ever called “the Existentialist”, tells her boyfriend, “You always have the freedom to make decisions”. So far, so solemn. But then she continues: “The only way to make yourself free is by making everyone else free, too.” Brussig tells us, deadpan, that they started freeing themselves “half an hour after midnight and didn’t stop until it was nearly five”. The fullness of Eastern lives, and their human ordinariness – despite the emptiness and abnormality of the background against which they were lived – is the subject of Brussig’s funny, rueful book."
