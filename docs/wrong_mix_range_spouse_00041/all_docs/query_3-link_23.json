Later, he realized that he was addicted, so, he quit smoking.\n\nMilind used to drink 20 cups of tea every day with an excessive amount of sugar, and now, he doesn’t consume refined sugar at all.\n\nHe has quit wearing shoes while running.\n\nProducer, Arunima Roy, is his best friend.\n\nHe is a wildlife lover and his pets include – snakes, lizards, cats, dogs, rats, rabbits, and pigeon.\n\nMilind is the co-founder of ‘Pinkathon’, India’s Biggest Women’s Run.\n\nHe has a dream to organize the world’s biggest triathlon.\n\nHe, along with Rahul Dev, co-owns a fitness club in Delhi called ‘Breathe.’\n\nMilind also owns an event company and a TV production house.\n\nIn 2017, he, along with Malaika Arora, judged the third season of ‘India’s Next Top Model.’\n\nHe has always rejected the offer to model for the companies of liquor and tobacco.\n\nMilind has done campaigning for the first made in India ‘Jeep Compass.’\n\nMilind’s love affair with Ankita Konwar, who is around 26 years younger than him made headlines on social media.

He said,\n\nI only exercise for 10-15 minutes everyday. Most people do not know this about me, I have never gone to the gym to have a workout routine. I don’t use equipment. I don’t even do 10-15 minutes in one time.”"
