Alongside his post, Milind also shared a note about \"laziness.\" He wrote: \"Laziness is a natural instinct. In pre-historic times when danger would be lurking constantly, we would need to conserve energy to be used only when necessary, say to hunt, gather food or flee. And even though we are supremely safe today, even outdoors, in the lap of nature, it is nice to give in sometimes!\"\n\nTake a look at his post here:\n\nMilind Soman often shares pictures of himself exercising and running with Ankita.

To all of you wonderful people out there, and to my sweetheart and best friend Ankita Konwar, run with me forever, thank you for your love. Happy Friendship Day!\"\n\nMeanwhile, also check out a few workout pictures and videos of Milind Soman that he has shared recently:\n\nMilind Soman actor was previously married to actress Mylene Jampanoi, whom he had met on the sets of the 2006 film Valley Of Flowers.\n\nIn terms of work, Milind Soman is best-known for featuring in the music video Made In India.
