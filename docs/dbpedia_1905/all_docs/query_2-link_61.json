        "text": "Michael Mayer's innovative new staging brings audiences inside the towering pyramids and gilded tombs of ancient Egypt with intricate projections and dazzling animations.\n\nAida is an Ethiopian princess held captive in Egypt, in love with a General, Radamès, and he with her. When he is chosen to lead a war with Ethiopia, we follow the conflict of Aida's love for both Radamès and for her country. Romanian-Hungarian mezzo-soprano Judit Kutasi (La Forza del Destino), is Aida's Egyptian rival Amneris, alongside Polish tenor Piotr Beczała as the soldier Radamès—completing the opera's greatest love triangle. The all-star cast also features baritones Quinn Kelsey and Amartuvshin Enkhbat and bass-baritone Eric Owens as Amonasro and basses Dmitry Belosselskiy, Alexander Vinogradov and Morris Robinson as Ramfis. Met Music Director Yannick Nézet-Séguin takes the podium.\n\nRuntime 3h38m"
