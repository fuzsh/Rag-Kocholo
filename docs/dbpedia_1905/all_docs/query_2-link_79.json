        "text": "Angel Blue has star quality, and Khori Dastoor should know.\n\nThe title star of Houston Grand Opera’s upcoming production of Verdi’s “La Traviata,” which opens Friday at the Wortham Center’s Brown Theater, and HGO general director once co-starred in a college production of Puccini’s one-act opera “Suor Angelica.” In Dastoor’s opinion, Blue’s appeal goes well beyond what she — citing HGO colleague Patrick Summers — calls a “Rolls-Royce voice.”\n\n“When her throat opens, you’re just hearing a sound that brings you absolute chills,” Dastoor says. “And then, because she is who she is — unassuming; very, very genuine; and almost shy — everything feels so authentic to kind of her humanity, her spirit. That makes you crave more and more and more.”\n\n“Traviata” has long been one of the world’s most-performed operas, and Violetta one of the most demanding soprano roles in the repertoire. A young Parisian courtesan secretly dying of tuberculosis, she finds herself unexpectedly falling for the provincial Alfredo but battling the wishes of his archconservative father, Germond, eventually resulting in one of opera’s all-time great death scenes. In HGO first-timer Blue, who starred as Bess in the Metropolitan Opera’s 2019-20 production of “Porgy and Bess” (and later won a Grammy for it), Dastoor believes HGO has found someone who brings uncommon depth to the role.\n\n“Her Violetta is a really different kind of Violetta than anyone I’ve seen,” she affirms. “She’s not a show pony. She is clearly a woman trapped in a miserable circumstance, and a survivor, and somebody who’s been told that they’re less than what they believe they are. She is there to prove both that she’s up to the role and prove the world wrong, but also Violetta is there to prove society wrong about who she is.”\n\nHowever, the opera’s March 1853 premiere in Venice enjoyed a somewhat bumpy reception. Many in the audience found the producers’ choice of Violetta, one Fanny Salvini-Donatelli, insufficiently young and frail for someone supposedly dying of consumption, and were not shy about saying so. But by the next century, the powerful emotions coursing through the unassailable soprano-tenor-baritone triangle of Violetta, Alfredo, and Germont — HGO has cast Virginia native Matthew White and Ukrainian-born Andrei Kymach as the latter two — lifted “Traviata” into the top tier of most-performed operas, where it has remained ever since.\n\nAs its popularity spread, the top sopranos of their day inevitably found their way to the plethora of “Traviata” recordings: Margherita Bevignani in 1915; Licia Albanese in ’46 and ’55; Maria Callas in ’53, ’55, and ’58; Joan Sutherland in ’62 and ’79; Beverly Sills in ’71; Angela Gheorghiu in ’94; Renee Fleming in 2004; Anna Netrebko in ’05; Marina Rebeka in ’19. At least a dozen are currently available on Apple Music.\n\nHollywood wanted in the game as soon as sound came to the movies. Long before “Pretty Woman,” which borrowed the plot of “Traviata” (with a happier ending) and set a key scene at a performance, the Violetta-Alfredo duet “Sempre libera” appeared in “One Night of Love,” from 1934, and the 1942 Gloria Jean/Donald O’Connor comedy “Get Hep to Love.”\n\nAct 1’s “Libiamo ne’ lieti calici,” — better known as the Brindisi — is now up there with “La Donna e mobile” from “Rigoletto” for the most recognizable bit of pop-culture Verdi. In the past decade alone, the lusty drinking song has appeared in the coming-of-age comedies “Booksmart” and “Adventureland,” the James Bond film “Spectre,” and Dustin Hoffman’s charming comedy about retired opera singers, “Quartet,” where the Brindisi even figures into the plot a little.\n\nVery much also worth mentioning are Rian Johnson’s 2019 mystery \"Knives Out,\" where Act 1’s “Ah, fors’ e lui” plays during the scene it all snaps into place for Daniel Craig’s genteel detective, and Guy Pearce belting out (well, lip-syncing) “Sempre libera” in 1994’s “Priscilla Queen of the Desert.” Dastoor even recently found herself explaining the plot of 2001’s “Moulin Rouge” to her young daughter by referencing “Traviata.” But even after all that, she believes Blue’s performance merits a second look at this most familiar of operas.\n\n“It has a tendency to be disappointing because the whole thing rises and falls on that person’s ability to be superhuman in a way,” Dastoor says. “And Angel has it, so I just think for people who have seen ‘Traviata,’ or maybe haven’t seen ‘Traviata,’ this is the one you want to see. We have in our star someone who’s really up to the task of delivering the whole performance.”"
