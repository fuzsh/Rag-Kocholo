        "text": "Santa Fe, NM — The Santa Fe Opera announces casting updates for its 2023 Season running June 30 through August 26. Scheduled in the 66th Festival Season are 38 performances, including two special Sunday evenings featuring the opera’s singing and technical apprentices in staged Apprentice Scenes. The company holds to its mission and time-tested programming model: a balanced and varied repertory of new, lesser-performed and standard works.\n\nTosca Cast and Creative Team Updates\n\nSoprano Leah Hawkins sings three additional performances in the title role on June 30, July 5 and 8. She steps in for the originally scheduled Angel Blue, who will be on tour with The Metropolitan Opera. Angel Blue appears in four performances from July 14 through August 7. Bass-baritone Dale Travis sings the Sacristan, young singer Kai Edgar makes his company debut as the Shepherd Boy and three Santa Fe Opera Apprentice singers make company debuts: Spencer Hamlin (Spoletta); second-year Apprentice singer Ben Brady (Sciarrone); and Dylan Gregg (Jailer). Katharina Eva Kastening makes her company debut as the Associate Director and Rick Sordelet, Christian Kelly-Sordelet and Shireen Yehya serve as Fight and Intimacy Directors for Tosca and all productions in the 2023 Season.\n\nThe Flying Dutchman Cast and Creative Team Updates\n\nReplacing Richard Trey Smagur, tenor Chad Shelton makes his company debut in the role of Erik as does Apprentice singer Gretchen Krupp who sings the role of Mary, rounding out the talented cast. The creative team is completed with Brendan Gonzales Boston in his company debut as Associate Scenic Designer.\n\nPelléas et Mélisande Cast and Creative Team Updates\n\nStepping in for originally scheduled Ain Anger, bass Raymond Aceto takes on the role of Arkel. Former Apprentice singer Zachary Nelson joins the cast as Golaud replacing Gihoon Kim and Kai Edgar continues his work with the company, singing the role of Yniold. Ben Brady sings the Physician (through August 9) and Arkel (August 18) while three other Apprentice singers make company debuts: Emma Rose Sorenson (Geneviève August 18); Brandon Bell (the Shepherd); and Sam Dhobhany (Physician August 18). Joining the skilled creative team is Projection Associate Amelia Scott in her company debut.\n\nRusalka Cast and Creative Team Updates\n\nIn her company debut, mezzo-soprano Raehann Bryce-Davis sings the role of Ježibaba replacing Michaela Martens, while several Apprentice artists make company debuts: Ilanah Lobel-Torres (First Wood Sprite); Lydia Grindatto (Second Wood Sprite); Meridian Prall (Third Wood Sprite); Jordan Loyd (Gamekeeper); Spencer Reichman (Hunter); and the role of the Kitchen Girl is shared by Apprentice singers Kaylee Nichols (through August 8) and Tessa Fackelmann (August 17, 22). Zeb Lalljee joins the creative team as the Costume Realizer and Nicola Bowie is the Choreographer.\n\nOrfeo Cast and Creative Team Updates\n\nJoining the production are talented artists in key roles: bass James Creswell portrays Caronte, baritone Blake Denson sings Plutone and second-year Apprentice singer Amber Norelai takes on the role of the Euridice. Recent Metropolitan Opera Laffont Competition winner and first-year Apprentice singer Christian Simmons makes his company debut in the role of Apollo. Other Apprentice debuts or assignments include Caitlin Aloia (Proserpina), Lucy Evans (La Ninfa through August 16, La Messaggera August 24), Meridian Prall (La Ninfa August 24), Philippe L’Esperance (First Pastore), Brandon Bell (Second Pastore), and Luke Elmer (Third Pastore). Younggwang Park takes on the dual roles of the Fourth Pastore and the First Spirit and Le Bu sings the Fifth Pastore and the Second Spirit. Julie Kim makes her company debut as Associate Producer while Costume Designer Carlos J Soto and Sound Designer Mark Grey return to the Santa Fe Opera.\n\nAbout the 2023 Season\n\nOpening on June 30 and July 1 are two standard works, Tosca and The Flying Dutchman, followed by two lesser-performed works, Pelléas et Mélisande and Rusalka, on July 15 and 22. Rounding out the season and presented for the first time on July 29 will be Monteverdi’s seminal Orfeo with a world premiere orchestration by American composer Nico Muhly. Leading performances of both Orfeo and Pelléas et Mélisande, Music Director Harry Bicket notes, “It’s a serendipitous moment that SFO plans Monteverdi’s Orfeo and Debussy’s Pelléas in the same season because Debussy was trying to find a musical language that matched the natural speech rhythms of French in the same way that Monteverdi was trying to do for the Italian language a few hundred years earlier. Both operas also share dream-like atmospheres where there is no real time or place, but which are inhabited by real human beings suffering vividly real heartbreak.”\n\nThe 2023 Season additionally marks the 50th Anniversary of the Pueblo Opera Program (POP) — a program that thrives on the shared value and belief in the power of storytelling. Led by an advisory council that includes past participants from local Tribal Communities around the state, POP members have participated in Youth Nights, student-produced operas, fashion shows, and the historic offering of a corn dance before and during performances of Doctor Atomic in 2018. Since 1973, more than 100,000 children and families from New Mexico’s 19 Pueblos and three reservations have attended the Santa Fe Opera. To commemorate POP’s 50th Anniversary, the company recently announced the July 30th documentary film premiere of The Pueblo Opera Program: And What Could be Next created by filmmaker Beverly R. Singer of Santa Clara Pueblo in association with the Pueblo Opera Cultural Council. More information can be found at santafeopera.org/whats-on/pop-50-documentary.\n\nTosca\n\nTorture, murder and suicide… the clock ticks.\n\nThe Santa Fe Opera’s 66th Festival Season opens on June 30 with one of opera’s greatest works, Puccini’s Tosca in a new production directed by Keith Warner with scenery and costumes by Ashley Martin-Davis and lighting design from Allen Hahn. Katharina Eva Kastening makes her company debut as Associate Director and Rick Sordelet, Christian Kelly-Sordelet and Shireen Yehya serve as Fight and Intimacy Directors. Seasoned operagoers and newcomers alike are drawn to Tosca for its theatricality fueled by love, jealousy, and political intrigue, as relevant today as when it premiered in 1900 at Rome’s Teatro Costanzi.\n\nJohn Fiore leads an exciting cast beginning with sopranos Leah Hawkins (June 30 – July 8, August 12 – 26) and Angel Blue (July 14 – August 7) in the title role. Sharing the role of Cavaradossi are tenors Joshua Guerrero (through August 1) and Freddie De Tommaso (August 7 – 26) in his much-anticipated American debut. Grammy and Emmy-winning baritone Reginald Smith, Jr. makes his company debut as the villainous Scarpia. Baritone Blake Denson sings Angelotti in his company debut. Bass-baritone Dale Travis sings the Sacristan, young singer Kai Edgar makes his company debut as the Shepherd Boy and three Santa Fe Opera Apprentice singers make company debuts: Spencer Hamlin (Spoletta), Ben Brady (Sciarrone) and Dylan Gregg (Jailer). Susanne Sheston is the Chorus Master and Rick Sordelet, Christian Kelly-Sordelet and Shireen Yehya serve as Fight and Intimacy Directors.\n\nThe Flying Dutchman\n\nCondemned and sailing the stormy seas.\n\nOpening July 1 is an opera not heard on the Santa Fe Opera stage in over 30 years: Richard Wagner’s The Flying Dutchman. Stage Director David Alden, who has directed every other Wagner opera, is excited to give us this powerful new production set during the Industrial Revolution. Paul Steinberg and Brendan Gonzales Boston provide the scenic design with costumes from Constance Hoffman and lighting by Duane Schuler in his 50th production with the company. Choreography is by Maxine Braham. This legend of a ghost ship forever condemned to sail the seas becomes a psychological exploration of the possibility of escape from the torment of industrial capitalism and redemption through love.\n\nThomas Guggeis, the incoming Music Director of the Frankfurt Opera, conducts an all-star cast including former Apprentice singer Nicholas Brownlee in the role of the Dutchman, acclaimed soprano Elza van den Heever as Senta, tenor Chad Shelton in the role of Erik and bass Morris Robinson as Daland. Former Apprentice singer Bille Bruley sings the Steersman and second-year Apprentice singer Gretchen Krupp is Mary in her company debut. Susanne Sheston is the Chorus Master and Rick Sordelet, Christian Kelly-Sordelet and Shireen Yehya serve as Fight and Intimacy Directors.\n\nPelléas et Mélisande\n\nDespair and forbidden love.\n\nNot seen on the Santa Fe Opera stage since 1977, Debussy’s masterpiece Pelléas et Mélisande is presented from July 15 in a riveting new site-specific production directed and designed by Netia Jones, who presented A Midsummer Night’s Dream in the 2021 Festival Season. With Pelléas, the orchestra is a character of its own in the pit, playing one of the 20th-century’s most influential scores and propelling a visceral drama that never fails to move.\n\nSanta Fe Opera Music Director Harry Bicket conducts a cast headlined by two thrilling singers in their Santa Fe Opera debuts: baritone Huw Montague Rendall and mezzo-soprano Samantha Hankey. Baritone and former Apprentice Zachary Nelson sings Golaud. Bass Raymond Aceto sings Arkel, Grammy Award-winning mezzo-soprano Susan Graham returns to the Santa Fe Opera stage as Geneviève and young singer Kai Edgar is Yniold. Susanne Sheston is the Chorus Master and Rick Sordelet, Christian Kelly-Sordelet and Shireen Yehya serve as Fight and Intimacy Directors.\n\nRusalka\n\nWill she become part of his world?\n\nOn July 22, Sir David Pountney’s electrifying new production of Rusalka meets Dvořák’s turn-of-the-century masterpiece at the potent intersection of timeless fairy tale and timely psychological drama. Scenic Designer Leslie Travers and Lighting Designer Malcolm Rippeth return to Santa Fe while Costume Designer Marie-Jeanne Lecca makes her company debut alongside Costume Realizer Zeb Lalljee.\n\nDvořák began writing Rusalka late in his career when he had turned his attention almost exclusively to mythical themes. With echoes of Hans Christian Andersen’sThe Little Mermaid, the opera weaves the tale of a water nymph who pays the ultimate price for the chance to love a human being. Responding with sharply contrasting vocal styles and sound worlds for the opera’s mortal and supernatural characters, Dvořák vividly portrays the impossibility of merging the two worlds and the despair of the individual caught between them.\n\nThe title character’s well-known “Song to the Moon” provides a mere taste of Rusalka’s vast musical riches. This opulent score has often been called Dvořák’s most Wagnerian work, not only for its equal treatment of orchestra and voices and for its subtle use of leitmotifs, but also for its shimmering, nearly impressionistic instrumentation, evoking the lapping of waves on water, nocturnal forest sounds and even the reflection of moonlight on the lake.\n\nLed by conductor Lidiya Yankovskaya in her company debut, the company welcomes the return of soprano Ailyn Pérez, who makes a notable role debut as Rusalka. Three other cast members make their company debuts: tenor Robert Watson sings the role of the Prince, mezzo-soprano Raehann Bryce-Davis is Ježibaba and soprano Mary Elizabeth Williams is the Foreign Princess. Bass James Creswell sings Vodník, Susanne Sheston is the Chorus Master, and Rick Sordelet, Christian Kelly-Sordelet and Shireen Yehya serve as Fight and Intimacy Directors.\n\nOrfeo\n\nDon’t look back…\n\nRounding out the 2023 Festival Season on July 29 is Nico Muhly’s world premiere orchestration of one of opera’s earliest written and regularly performed works, Monteverdi’s seminal Orfeo. Says Muhly, “For me, the main challenge in re-orchestrating Orfeo is realizing the continuo parts; everything needs to be, note-for-note, the same as the original, but with a modern musician’s sensibility about embellishment and ornament. Here, I’m trying to use color and timbre to achieve this, where the continuo has a more explicit relation to the plot: a sense of textural allure from the pit.”\n\nAdds Music Director Harry Bicket “The first 20th-century revivals of this piece, which at the time had not been performed in 300 years, were all contemporary orchestrations of the score by composers such as d’Indy, Hindemith, Casella and Berio. The Santa Fe Opera is following that tradition by commissioning an unashamedly 21st-century look at a 17th-century opera seen through the prism of a young composer who includes among his influences the music of Byrd, Handel and Gibbons.”\n\nMirroring this contemporary approach to the work, the direction is in the hands of Yuval Sharon in his company debut. He is joined by a notable team, including returning Costume Designer Carlos J Soto and Sound Designer Mark Grey. The rest make Santa Fe Opera debuts: Alex Schweder and Matthew Johnson give us the visual environment and Yuki Nakase Link and Hana S. Kim provide the lighting and projection designs, respectively."
