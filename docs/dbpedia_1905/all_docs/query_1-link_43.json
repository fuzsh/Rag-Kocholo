        "text": "Santa Fe, NM — The Santa Fe Opera announces soprano Leah Hawkins will sing all remaining performances of Tosca, which opened the 2023 Season on June 30 and runs for 11 performances through August 26. This comes as a result of the withdrawal of Angel Blue, who was most recently scheduled for four performances: July 14, 21, August 1 and 7. Blue has stepped down owing to an unexpected family emergency and has also withdrawn from all other upcoming engagements in the month of July.\n\nWrites Ms. Blue, “I am deeply saddened to confirm that, due to an unexpected family emergency, I will be canceling all of my professional engagements in the month of July and therefore will be unable to sing the role of Tosca at Santa Fe Opera. I am heartbroken not to be performing this season, as Santa Fe Opera is truly a highlight for any opera singer, but I am confident that the audiences on those nights will be astonished by Leah Hawkins’ phenomenal talent and brilliant interpretation of the title character. I would like to extend my heartfelt apologies for the sudden change, as I know that I would not be the Tosca that Santa Fe Opera deserves while managing this personal matter. Thank you for your understanding.” The Santa Fe Opera wishes Angel Blue and her family well during this difficult time.\n\nOn June 30 rising soprano Leah Hawkins made her Santa Fe Opera debut in the titular role; early critical acclaim for her performance includes:\n\n“Her opening night performance was riveting throughout, but her Act 2 aria “Vissi d’arte,” in which the character entreats God wondering what she has done to deserve such a fate when she only lived for love and for art, was a showstopper… those of us who saw Hawkins in the role will someday boast of catching her early in her career.”\n\n— Julia Goldberg, Santa Fe Reporter\n\n“In the title role, Leah Hawkins provided tonal and dynamic variety vocally, along with beautiful tone…”\n\n—Mark Tiarks, Santa Fe New Mexican\n\n“Hawkins truly has a splendid voice: powerful, with a golden medium range and clear‑cut high notes.”\n\n—Christian Dalzon, Concertonet.com\n\nAbout Leah Hawkins — Leah Hawkins is a graduate of the Lindemann Young Artist Development Program at The Metropolitan Opera, 2021 winner of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra’s Women in Classical Music Career Advancement Award and 2022 Richard Tucker Career Grant recipient. Her Santa Fe Opera debut as Tosca is her second journey into the opera world’s beloved diva. When asked for three fun facts about herself, Hawkins shared:\n\nI started piano lessons at 9, voice lessons at 12 and I have performed 25+ operatic roles, including 5 that I premiered/created.\n\nI love costume jewelry. One-of-a-kind, funky, geometric pieces make me happy!\n\nI also collect magnets. They are usually from places I have visited or worked.\n\nMedia Resources for Leah Hawkins in SFO’s Tosca\n\nSanta Fe Opera Tosca production photography (for editorial use only)\n\nhttps://www.santafeopera.org/company/image-galleries-login/image-galleries/image-galleries-2023/\n\nPlease inquire with media@santafeopera.org for the password.\n\n95.5 KHFM Classical Public Radio, Leah Hawkins on SFO’s Tosca: https://soundcloud.com/santa-fe-opera/leah-hawkins-on-sfos-tosca-part-one?\n\nAlbuquerque Journal, Soprano Leah Hawkins set to soar as the titular Tosca: https://www.abqjournal.com/lifestyle/soprano-leah-hawkins-set-to-soar-as-the-titular-tosca/article_763b88aa-0ecc-11ee-b437-6fd4e0d3b3ed.html"
