        "text": "Premieres Friday, June 14 at 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings)\n\nAcclaimed English director Carrie Cracknell makes her Met debut, resetting the classic story to the modern day that moves the focus to issues that could not be more relevant today: gendered violence, abusive labor structures, and the desire to break through societal boundaries. Young mezzo-soprano Aigul Akhmetshina leads a quartet of stars in the complex and volatile title role, alongside tenor Piotr Beczała as Carmen’s troubled lover Don José, soprano Angel Blue as the loyal Micaëla, and bass-baritone Kyle Ketelsen as the swaggering Escamillo. Daniele Rustioni conducts Bizet’s score.\n\nLater this summer, Great Performances at the Met: La Forza del Destino starring soprano Lise Davidsen as Leonora premieres Sunday, July 7 at 2 p.m. on PBS (check local listings).
