        "text": "Puccini’s bittersweet love story arrives in cinemas, with soprano Angel Blue starring as the French courtesan Magda, opposite tenor Jonathan Tetelman as Ruggero, an idealistic young man who offers her an alternative to her life of excess. Maestro Speranza Scappucci conducts Nicolas Joël’s Art Deco–inspired staging, which transports audiences from the heart of Parisian nightlife to a dreamy vision of the French Riviera. Soprano Emily Pogorelc and tenor Bekhzod Davronov complete the sterling cast as Lisette and Prunier.\n\nAdult $25 | Senior $20 | Student $10 | All fees included\n\nUMaine students free according to policy.\n\nla_rondine_program_notes\n\nLearn before you go!\n\nPlease join us for free informational sessions, held prior to each opera.
