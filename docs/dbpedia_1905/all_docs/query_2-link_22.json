        "text": "Celebrated soprano Angel Blue joined Simeon Rusnak to discuss her upcoming role of Violetta in Manitoba Opera's production of \"La Traviata\"\n\nRecognized for her beautiful timbre and stunning stage presence, soprano Angel Blue's voice has been hailed for its shining, agile upper register and \"smoky\" middle register. A regular BBC Proms presenter who is equally at home on the concert or operatic stage, Angel is quickly establishing herself as one of the best singers in her generation, having performed in over 35 countries in the last 6 years.\n\nAngel Blue, along with tenor Adam Luther (Alfredo), and baritone James Westman (Germont) star in this new brand new production of one of operas most loved works directed by renowned Canadian director Alain Gauthier. Set in a 1920s Parisian cabaret, a wealthy young gentleman and a celebrated music hall artist, inspired by the legendary performer of that era, Josephine Baker, find true love, only to be separated by family, society, and finally, death. Manitoba Opera, along with four other Canadian opera companies (Vancouver Opera, Opéra de Montréal, Pacific Opera Victoria, and Edmonton Opera) co-producted the new production, making for a Canadian Opera first.\n\nThe opera premieres Saturday, April 14th Saturday, April 14, 7:30 pm with two more shows, Tuesday, April 17, 7 pm and Friday, April 20, 7:30 pm. All performances take place at the Centennial Concert Hall. For more information and tickets, visit: http://www.manitobaopera.mb.ca/operas/la-traviata.html\n\nMissed the interview?
