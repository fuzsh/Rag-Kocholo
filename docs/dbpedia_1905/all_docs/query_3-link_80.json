        "text": "Welcome to Healing Breath, created in partnership with Google Arts & Culture and the Kennedy Center, featuring Christine Baranski, Jamie Barton, Angel Blue, Lawrence Brownlee, Kristin Chenoweth, Kurt Elling, Denyce Graves, Angelique Kidjo, Audra McDonald, Kelli O'Hara, Vanessa Williams, Stacie Aamon, Tom Sweitzer, and Indre Viskontas.\n\nFor most people, breathing is simple—an instinctual behavior we all take for granted. But for many who have experienced COVID-19, breathing is a challenge, one that can remain difficult after they recover from the most acute phase of the illness. And for people experiencing what is now called “long covid,” reduced breath capacity can continue, threatening both their health and their peace of mind.\n\nFor singers, healthy breathing is fundamental to what we do. We study and practice it as a skill, far beyond an automatic behavior. In fact, breathing depends on a complex set of muscles, both voluntary and involuntary, and the good news is that they can be developed and strengthened with simple exercises.\n\nClassical singers use these exercises to increase efficiency, stamina, and control, allowing us to sing long phrases, in performances lasting hours, and be heard over orchestras in huge spaces. Like athletes, we work with coaches, and different singers have favorite routines that work for them.\n\nSo I thought it might be helpful for vocalists to share our breathing exercises with anyone trying to regain better breath after illness. In the video collection below, you’ll find tips and breathing exercises from artists Audra McDonald, Christine Baranski, Denyce Graves, Kelli O’Hara, Kristin Chenoweth, Kurt Elling, Lawrence Brownlee, and more!\n\nAs with everything involving your health, you should consult your physician before using these exercises, especially if you are, or have been, ill. If you try something and it makes you feel faint, dizzy, or in pain, stop right away. These exercises should feel good and be relaxing for you. My hope is that, among these techniques that professional singers depend on, you will find tools to help you breathe more easily, calmly, and fully.\n\nExplore more at the Google Arts & Culture Healing Breath site.\n\nGenerous support for educational programs at the Kennedy Center is provided by the U.S. Department of Education.
