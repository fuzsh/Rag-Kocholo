        "text": "Last year, Angel Blue spent only 54 nights at home.\n\n“The first thing that comes into my mind is the Tasmanian devil, being how fast he goes in the cartoon,” said Ms. Blue, a soprano who played Bess in “Porgy and Bess” at the Metropolitan Opera earlier this year, as well as Mimi in “La Bohème” at the Hamburg State Opera, among other venues. “That’s how I felt — just constantly going, constantly moving, constantly having to perform.”\n\nIn March, when the pandemic shuttered opera houses and stalled careers, Ms. Blue was allied with her devastated colleagues. But she also glimpsed a silver lining. “If I’m totally honest, I’m happy to be at home,” she said. “I’ve been almost desperate for time off.”\n\nNot that she has been idle. Like so many quarantined performers, Ms. Blue found an audience behind the lens, and fulfilled her dream of having a talk show. “Faithful Friday” streamed on Facebook from March to June, with the singer Christine Goerke, the actor Laverne Cox and the chef Cat Cora, among others, broaching topics like fear, motivation, encouragement and job loss. Ms. Blue plans to return with a second season in mid-September, with a lineup including the soprano Anna Netrebko, “who’s been really supportive of me as a younger singer,” said Ms. Blue, 36.\n\nAnd on Dec. 19, she’ll close out the Met Stars Live in Concert virtual recital series. Ms. Blue spoke by phone from New Jersey, where she lives with her husband, Adam Mielke, a computer programmer, and their 9-year-old son. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nFriday Morning\n\nUsually, I’m up at 6. It is so quiet. I love it when it is like this — silent, still, no movement, just me, my thoughts, my daily devotional. And then 20 minutes of meditation that helps me to understand what I want from myself during that day. I’ll let myself sit there and just be thankful that I can be still, because it’s really a blessing. I’ve been running around for a long time.\n\nMost mornings I do a two-mile walk on the treadmill in the basement. Today I did an exercise video instead. When I did [beauty] pageants, there was this lady named Leslie Sansone who did this video called “Walk Away the Pounds.” Now she has her own walking series. She’s positive and uplifting.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
