        "meta_description": "From its stunningly beautiful solo moments to the rapturous “Dies Irae” that movie trailers have—rightly—lifted as a soundtrack to the end of the world, Verdi’s Requiem is a darkly dramatic 90-minute roller-coaster ride. When Gustavo Dudamel last conducted it a decade ago, the Los Angeles Times raved about his “radical and wondrous” performance that drew in the Bowl audience for moments of “intimate, personal expression” while also soaring in the many massive moments that “shook the Cahuenga Pass.” Invitational rehearsals are designed for a donor and one guest.
