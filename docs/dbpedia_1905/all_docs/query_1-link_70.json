        "text": "Met HD: Aida (Verdi)\n\nEncore Performance\n\nAmerican soprano Angel Blue headlines as the Ethiopian princess torn between love and country in a new production of Verdi’s Aida by Michael Mayer that brings audiences inside the towering pyramids and gilded tombs of ancient Egypt with intricate projections and dazzling animations. Romanian-Hungarian mezzo-soprano Judit Kutasi also stars as Aida’s rival, Amneris, alongside Polish tenor Piotr Beczała as the soldier Radamès—completing opera’s greatest love triangle. Met Music Director Yannick Nézet-Séguin takes the podium to conduct the January 25 performance, which will be transmitted live from the Metropolitan Opera stage to cinemas worldwide.\n\nTicket holders are invited to a pre-opera talk by Chuck Mishaan 30 minutes prior to curtain time in the theater.\n\nMade possible through the support of Premier Medical Group, the Jane W. Nuhn Charitable Trust, the Dr. Edwin Ulrich Charitable Trust, the Benjamin R. Strong Opera Fund and the Stephen & Julia Dunwell Fund, both of the Community Foundations of the Hudson Valley. Promotional support courtesy of WMHT – FM 88.7 Poughkeepsie.\n\nReminder: This is a live satellite broadcast direct from the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. On occasion there may be visual or sound disturbances that are beyond the Bardavon’s control. In the event a disturbance does occur, please be patient. Thank you."
