        "text": "Act II\n\nScene 1\n\nAmneris prepares to welcome back Radamès from the war. Amneris tricks Aida into telling her Radamès has been killed in battle. Seeing Aida’s reaction, Amneris has confirmed her suspicion that Aida is her romantic rival. After threatening Aida, Amneris departs for the festivities.\n\nScene 2\n\nThe Egyptians have won the war and a triumphal scene celebrates Radamès’ victory. Amneris crowns him victor, and the Pharaoh offers him any reward he may name. Radamès asks for the Ethiopian prisoners to be summoned. Aida recognizes her father, Amonasro among them; he is in disguise and warns her not to reveal his true identity. Amonasro pleads for his fellow captives’ lives, but Ramfis and the priests demand their death. As his reward, Radamès requests freedom for the Ethiopians. The Pharaoh compromises, retaining Aida and her father as hostages. He then declares Radamès shall marry Amneris and promises that he will one day rule as Pharaoh. Amneris exults at this unexpected turn of fortune, while Radamès and Aida despair.\n\nINTERMISSION\n\nAct III\n\nRamfis takes Amneris to pray in the temple of Isis before the wedding. Aida, nearby, dreams of her homeland while she waits to meet Radamès. Her thoughts are interrupted by her father, Amonasro, who demands that she learn from Radamès what the Egyptians’ next attack plan will be.\n\nWhen Radamès arrives, Aida suggests to him that he does not love her enough to leave Egypt and live with her in Ethiopia. She points out that if she and her father remain in Egypt they will be executed. He agrees to flee with her, and she asks him which route they should take to avoid the Egyptian troops. After he tells her, Amonasro appears and reveals his true identity. Radamès is appalled that he has unwittingly betrayed his country. Amneris and Ramfis emerge from the temple. Amonasro moves to attack Amneris, but Radamès prevents him. Amonasro and Aida escape. Now a traitor, Radamès surrenders to Ramfis.\n\nAct IV\n\nScene 1\n\nRadamès awaits trial. Amneris resolves to try to save him. She begs him to renounce Aida: the price of her intercession on his behalf with the Pharaoh. When he refuses, she dismisses him. The priests condemn him to be entombed alive for treason. Amneris curses them as they leave.\n\nScene 2\n\nRadamès has been sealed in a tomb, where he discovers Aida hidden inside, waiting for him. They declare their love for each other. Amneris mourns for Radamès as Aida dies in his arms."
