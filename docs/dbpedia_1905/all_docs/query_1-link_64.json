        "text": "Puccini’s passionate love story La Rondine makes a rare appearance in the Metropolitan Opera’s 2023–24 Live in HD season, broadcast live on Saturday 20th April, at 5:55pm. American soprano Angel Blue stars as the French courtesan Magda, opposite Chilean-born tenor Jonathan Tetelman in his Met debut as Ruggero. Of her opening night performance, the Financial Times noted that Angel Blue’s luscious soprano ennobles Puccini rarity. Blue returns following her critically acclaimed performances as Micaëla in Bizet’s Carmen earlier this season.\n\nTetelman, honored as Opus Klassik Award’s 2023 Break-Out Artist of the Year, has been recognized for his portrayals of Alfredo in Verdi’s La Traviata and Rodolfo in Puccini’s La Bohème at Covent Garden, Cavaradossi in Puccini’s Tosca at the Semperoper Dresden, and Loris Ipanoff in Giordano’s Fedora at Oper Frankfurt. He will also sing Pinkerton in Puccini’s Madama Butterfly when the title is broadcast live to cinemas worldwide on Saturday 11th May, opposite Lithuanian soprano Asmik Grigorian in her Met debut.\n\nAlso making their Met debuts in La Rondine are American soprano Emily Pogorelc and tenor Bekhzod Davronov, hailing from Uzbekistan, as Lisette and Prunier. Both have been praised by critics around the world, with Pogorelc being described as an incisive, lively soprano (The New York Times) and Davronov as a fantastic voice … wonderfully elegant, and easy in its upper registers (The Guardian).\n\nMaestro Speranza Scappucci, who made history as the first-ever Italian woman to conduct at La Scala and made her Met debut last season, returns to lead the Met Orchestra and the cast. Nicolas Joël’s Art Deco–inspired staging transports audiences from the heart of 1920s Parisian nightlife to a dreamy vision of the French Riviera. The creative team includes set designer Ezio Frigerio, costume designer Franca Squarciapino, and lighting designer Duane Schuler. La Rondine was first performed at the Met on 10th March 1928. The opera has only been performed a total of 33 times on the Met stage prior to this season and was last performed in 2013.\n\nThe 2023–24 Live in HD season concludes with Madama Butterfly (11th May).\n\nAll performances will be Saturday matinees broadcast live from the Met stage."
