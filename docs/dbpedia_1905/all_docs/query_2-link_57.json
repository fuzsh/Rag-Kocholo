        "text": "Met HD: The Gershwin’s Porgy and Bess\n\nEncore - New Production\n\nThe Gershwins’ modern American masterpiece has its first Met performances in almost three decades, starring bass-baritone Eric Owens and soprano Angel Blue in the title roles. Director James Robinson’s stylish production transports audiences to Catfish Row, a setting vibrant with the music, dancing, emotion, and heartbreak of its inhabitants.\n\nTicket holders are invited to a pre-opera talk by Chuck Mishaan 30 minutes prior to curtain time in the theater.\n\nMade possible through the support of Premier Medical Group, the Jane W. Nuhn Charitable Trust, the Dr. Edwin Ulrich Charitable Trust, the Benjamin R. Strong Opera Fund and the Stephen & Julia Dunwell Fund, both of the Community Foundations of the Hudson Valley. Promotional support courtesy of WMHT – FM 88.7 Poughkeepsie.\n\nReminder: This is a live satellite broadcast direct from the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. On occasion there may be visual or sound disturbances that are beyond the Bardavon’s control. In the event a disturbance does occur, please be patient. Thank you."
