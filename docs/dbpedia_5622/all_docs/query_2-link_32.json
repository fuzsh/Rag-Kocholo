        "text": "Gloria Gaynor has a legendary career which spans the past 50 years, never losing momentum. She has achieved global stardom and musical recognition with hit songs in the charts in all five decades. Gloria has channeled her fame and recognition into support for several charities, donating not only her money but also her time and talent. She changed the lyrics to her world-renowned song and leant her time to a corresponding music video used by the Miami Children’s Hospital to raise awareness and funds for their lifesaving efforts. Never one to rest, Gloria recently earned a bachelor’s degree in behavioral sciences to aid in her work with charities and organizations helping at-risk youths and their families. She has also just launched her “I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor” merchandise line in partnership with Amazon which features a wide range of inspirational and encouraging designs on t-shirts, sweatshirts, and smartphone accessories. Gloria’s new line also features a series of designs specifically created to empower young women to strive, thrive, and achieve great things in their lives. All the new merchandise designs can be viewed at www.Amazon.com/GloriaGaynor. A consummate entertainer, Gloria continues to tirelessly tour the world performing at concerts in the U.S., Europe, South America, and beyond each year. She was a presenter at the 2015 GRAMMY Awards® and the headliner at the 2015 “Official GRAMMY® Celebration.” The CCU’s Women in Leadership Conference honored Gloria in early 2015 with their “Celebration of Inspiring Women” Award for her philanthropic and leadership achievements and contributions. On May 16th, 2015 Dowling College presented Gloria with an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Music. Gloria was also honored by the Library of Congress on May 6, 2017 after having her recording of her global anthem, “I Will Survive,” inducted in the library’s collection of recordings with American historical and cultural significance in 2016. She was part of an “In Conversation” with fellow survivor, Robin Roberts from “Good Morning America,” in the Coolidge Theater in Washington, DC. Later that same day, Gloria delivered a concert to end all concerts in the Thomas Jefferson Building’s Great Hall. No stranger to television, Gloria has made guest appearances on “Ally McBeal,” “The Wayans Bros.,” and “That ‘70s Show.” She was a featured guest on the premiere episode of “Best Time Ever with Neil Patrick Harris” and most recently, Gloria was a guest on the “Dr. Oz Show” in New York City, and the “Dr. Phil” show in Los Angeles. She also kicked off the 2016 UK National Television Awards telecast on stage at the O2 Arena with a performance that had the entire audience on their feet giving Gloria a standing ovation. Also in 2016, Gloria was presented by Ido Aharoni (Consul General of Israel), with the “Martin Luther King Jr. Award” acknowledging those who have gone above and beyond to inspire others. In the Spring of 2017, Gloria was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame at a special ceremony in Asbury Park, N.J. The summer of 2019 saw Gloria invited by U.S. astronaut and American treasure, Buzz Aldrin, to be part of the Apollo 50th anniversary gala at the Ronald Reagan Memorial Library in California. Gloria’s second book, “We Will Survive: True Stories of Encouragement, Inspiration, and the Power of Song,” was a 2015 GRAMMY® nominee for Best Spoken Word Album. The remarkable stories in this book reveal that the song, “I Will Survive,” has reached people from all walks of life and touched them in thousands of unique ways. From individuals triumphing over illness to those suffering from the painful loss of a loved one, to others piecing their lives together after bearing witness to a national tragedy, “I Will Survive,” has become an emotional anthem for them and for millions of Gloria’s adoring fans around the world. “I Will Survive” is my mantra, the core of my God-given purpose,” Gaynor said in a statement. “It is my privilege and honor to use it to inspire people around the world of every nationality, race, creed, color and age group to join me as I sing and live the words: “I Will Survive.” When not focusing on her several charitable endeavors, Gloria continues to write and record new music. Her recent work in Nashville with the GRAMMY Award® winning team of Christopher Stevens (TobyMac, Mandisa, Jason Aldean), F. Reid Shippen (Dierks Bentley, Lady Antebellum, Keith Urban), Bryan Fowler, Shannon Sanders, and Drew Ramsey as well as Yolanda Adams, Bart Millard (MercyMe), Mike Farris, and Jason Crabb has delivered her new album, “Testimony.” Her new roots gospel album debuted in the Top 5 of the billboard Top Gospel Albums Chart, the Top 3 on the iTunes Gospel Chart and the Top 20 on the Amazon Overall Album Chart. The album has received rave reviews from Rolling Stone, Billboard, The Herald-Standard, “CBS Sunday Morning,” “The Today Show” and more. “Testimony” also received two GRAMMY® nominations for Best Roots Gospel Album and for Best Gospel Performance/Song for Gloria’s duet with Yolanda Adams on the song, “Talkin’ ‘Bout Jesus.” Gloria took home the Best Roots Gospel GRAMMY® at the 2020 Award Ceremony. She also headlined the 2020 GRAMMY® Celebration. Be sure to follow Gloria on your social media favorites like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and TikTok. She is @GloriaGaynor on all these platforms.
