The next locale was bigger, it was here the club became GG Knickerbocker's and it was located in 1466 Broadway & 42nd St. That club was kind of divided into two areas. After entering the front door the first area was mostly just a long bar on the right side of the room with a bit of seating area (at the bar and perhaps a few tables). The 2nd area in the back was the dance floor. It wasn't huge or elaborate, in fact it was pretty small and crowded. The doorman at both Gilded Grape and Knickerbocker was Angel Caraballo. There was a bartender called Gene. It was almost completely a drag club. There might have been 2 or 3 \"real\" women in the club the whole night, if that many.

The meat-packing guys would come in and eat hot dogs and mac & cheese on their lunch hour to watch the naked girls dance. But all day long gay men would be coming in and running out when they saw the girls, and finally the owners realized they were losing all these clients by having girls there, and so phased them out.\n\n the club had a main floor with a dance floor, a rectangular bar plus a performance area, all painted black. There was another small bar downstairs with a large screen showing gay male porn.
