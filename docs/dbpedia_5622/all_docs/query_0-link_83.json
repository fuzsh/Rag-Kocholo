        "text": "In a singles-driven genre and era, its rare to find an album like this that is actually worth listening to. Perhaps because its practically a compilation of previously released singles. It may not be quite as exciting as Where Did Our Love Go – with its incredible production and array of hits. But Maxine Brown’s voice is really great and manages to carry through here across a lot of different material without dropping a beat – brill-building to soul.\n\nYou get the sense she’s one of the more mature singers of the era and is actually more at home singing something more sophisticated than the playing the innocent young girl (e.g. on the final track ‘little girls lost’), which may be one of the reasons she seems a little underappreciated.\n\nTracks\n\nA1 Oh No, Not My Baby 2:29\n\nA2 It’s Gonna Be Alright 2:36\n\nA3 Ask Me 2:59\n\nA4 I Cry Alone 2:35\n\nA5 Coming Back to You 2:47\n\nA6 You Do Something to Me 2:20\n\nB1 I Wonder What My Baby’s Doing Tonight 2:27\n\nB2 Since I Found You 2:48\n\nB3 Gotta Find a Way 2:57\n\nB4 Yesterday’s Kisses 2:15\n\nB5 You Upset My Soul 2:24\n\nB6 Little Girl Lost 2:06\n\nBy Northernsoultrain\n\nMaxine Ella Brown (born 18 August 1939, in Kingstree, South Carolina) is an American soul singer. She began singing as a child, performing with two New York based gospel groups when she was a teenager. In 1960, she signed with the small Nomar record label, who released the smooth soul ballad “All in My Mind” (which was written be Maxine) late in the year. The single became a hit, climbing to number two on the R&B charts (number 19 pop), and it was quickly followed by “Funny“, which peaked at number three. Brown was poised to become a star, and she moved to ABC-Paramount in 1962, but left the label within a year and signed to the New York based, uptown soul label, Wand, in 1963.\n\nListen It’s Gonna Be Alright written by the great Jerry Goffin & Carole King\n\nBrown recorded her best work at Wand, having a string of moderate hits for the label over the next three years. Among these were the Carole King Gerry Goffin song “Oh No Not My Baby“, which reached number 24 on the pop charts; “It’s Gonna Be Alright“; and several duets with Chuck Jackson. However, the label focused much of their attention on Dionne Warwick, leaving Maxine Brown to toil in semi-obscurity.\n\nA little known fact, is that all backgrounds of Maxine’s records, were performed by Cissy Houston and the Sweet Inspirations (the same group that backed Elvis) plus the sweet sounds of Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson. Hoping to increase the line of hits for Maxine and her singing partner, Chuck Jackson, Nick & Val took their song catalog to Spector Records looking for a deal. When they were turned down,the couple took that same catalog to Berry Gordy at Motown Records and the songs that were penned for Maxine and Chuck, became blockbuster hits for Ray Charles (Let’s Go Get Stoned)- co-written by Josie Armstead and Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell (Ain’t No Mountain High Enough)!!!\n\nIn 1969, she left Wand and signed first with Commonwealth United and then Avco Records, but her later recordings met with little commercial success. Despite her lack of hits, Brown is acknowledged as one of the finest R&B vocalists of her time, capable of delivering soul, and pop with equal aplomb.\n\nListen up another Goffin & King gem, beautifully sung by Maxine."
