        "text": "Motown legend Martha Reeves had quite a day.\n\nOn March 27, the 82-year-old singer finally got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Flanked by Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, and Berry Gordy, Reeves donned a pearl and gold strapless gown with a show-stopping hat for the celebration. That evening, Reeves was the star of a conversation at the GRAMMY Museum in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nReeves was definitely riding high that night. \"I’m gonna try to calm down. I’ve been excited all day,\" Reeves told moderator Gail Mitchell, longtime Billboard Executive Director of R&B and Hip-Hop.\n\nBorn in Alabama but raised in the Motor City, Martha Reeves was the lead singer of Martha Reeves and the Vandellas. The Motown girl group is responsible for 1960s and 1970s classics such as \"Dancing in the Street,\" \"My Baby Loves Me,\" \"Jimmy Mack,\" \"Nowhere to Run,\" \"(Love is Like a ) Heatwave,\" and \"Bless You.\" Following her time at Motown, Reeves went on to have a solo career and was even an elected councilwoman in Detroit. The GRAMMY-nominated artist was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nThroughout the evening, the Motown diva — now in a lavish purple and silver top — had the audience at the Museum's Clive Davis Theater singing along to her classics, laughing as she strolled down Motown memory lane, and even tearing up as she got personal. She even teased that she might have a new album in store.\n\nRead on for five things we learned from Martha Reeves' free-flowing, laugh-filled conversation at the GRAMMY Museum.\n\nShe Had To Fight To Get Her Hollywood Star\n\nReeves crossed paths with many legendary names over the course of her career. But one of the first people she shouted out wasn’t a star, but her manager Chris Roe. \"He’s brought me a long way in just a couple of years.\" Reeves said of the industry veteran. During the Q&A segment of her conversation, Reeves even brought Roe on stage.\n\nHer gratitude makes sense for a number of reasons. Reeves was first nominated for a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2021 but the process stagnated, Roe said, because of representation that wasn’t truly in Motown singer’s corner. Reeves' management at the time, Roe noted, was treating the soul icon like a shiny trophy rather than an active musician.\n\nThe two first met when Roe was in Detroit on business; a year later Roe went all in to raise money and make her Walk of Fame star dream a reality. Onstage at the Museum, Reeves recalled walking down Hollywood Boulevard with her son in the 1970s (Reeves moved to L.A. for a time when Motown relocated to Southern California), reading the names of the stars. Her young son said Reeves should have her own marker, and his poignant memory was finally brought to fruition.\n\nMartha Reeves Credits Berry Gordy And Motown For Having \"A Vision\"\n\n\"How did Berry Gordy manage to get all of those people in one place? It was like corralling in a Western,\" Reeves said of Motown's incredible roster of talent in the '60s.\n\nShe added that, never in her wildest dreams, did she think she would soar so high alongside musical geniuses like Smokey Robinson and songwriting/production team Holland-Dozier-Holland (who arranged songs for the likes of the Four Tops and the Supremes during a piping-hot run during the mid-1960s).\n\nOccasionally, instead of answering questions, Reeves would burst into song. \"I can’t describe it,\" Reeves said at one point while describing Motown's musical resonance. \"But I can make you feel it.\"\n\nReeves noted that it was tough to think of one particular moment that wasn’t exciting or that paved the way for future success. She calls everything an \"adventure or a challenge.\"\n\nShe did say that her first tour was grueling, consisting of 94 one-nighters and only one motel chain who would allow Black guests.\n\nShe Learned A Lot While On Tour With Motown\n\nReeves went from playfully talking about how \"fine\" Marvin Gaye was and being around different kinds of artists on cross-country Motortown Revue bus trips, to more serious topics like the integration of Black music during the turbulent 1960s.\n\nShe recalled a particularly harrowing moment when the Revue arrived in Montgomery, Alabama in 1963 when the Vandellas, the Marvelettes, the Miracles, the Temptations, and others were performing for a segregated audience in a horse-training arena with American and Confederate flags. While Smokey Robinson and the Miracles performed \"Mickey’s Monkey,\" men with baseball bats separated the audience — Black on one side, white on the other.\n\nBut Robinson stepped to the microphone and challenged convention. He just wanted to make sure that everyone just had a good time and could dance. \"We’ve come a long way. Music is the reason,\" Reeves told the audience.\n\nShe Remembers Her Solo Work Fondly, Too\n\nAfter Reeves and the Vandellas disbanded and Reeves left Motown, she released her eponymous debut solo album in 1974 on MCA Records. Producer Richard Perry came in to work on the album with her, resulting in many hits.\n\nReeves spoke a lot about one track, \"Many Rivers to Cross,\" which involved 110 takes and a 40-piece choir. \"He was that diligent in getting the sound he wanted. [A] very profound producer,\" Reeves said of Perry. Reeves said she's very proud of \"Dixie Highway,\" an ode to Reeves’s Alabama root.\n\nReeves said that her mother and father — who had 11 children — taught her \"everything\" and that she was a very loved child. In fact, her parents fostered her musical talents from an early age, her mother helping with her singing and her father putting her on his lap as he played guitar.\n\nReeves Gave Her Hometown Love, And They Gave It Back\n\nReeves served as an elected councilwoman in Detroit from 2005 to 2009. \"You have to be careful what you ask for,\" Reeves said with a laugh about her time in politics. She calls the whole experience \"an education.\"\n\nBecause of Reeves’s efforts in local politics, Detroit is home to Berry Gordy Jr. Boulevard, the street on which, fittingly, the Motown Museum is located.\n\nSome of her fans and friends from Detroit made it all the way to the GRAMMY Museum for the event, donning Martha Reeves shirts and carrying Vandellas records. Several times, Reeves shouted out a friend who is a dance teacher. \"I love you so for being here.\"\n\nSome of the most moving moments of Martha Reeves' conversation came during the audience Q&A session. One member of the audience recalled meeting Reeves in New York shortly after his mother — a longtime fan of Reeves' — passed away; he shared the comfort his conversation with the singer brought him while grieving. Another attendee said he was a Detroit radio DJ and once received a ride home with Reeves; and yet another member of the audience spoke passionately about seeing the Motown Revue as a young man, and how the event was one of his first experiences in a desegregated scenario.\n\nLiving Legends: Smokey Robinson On New Album 'Gasms,' Meeting The Beatles & Staying Competitive\n\nIn 2003, OutKast scored their second No. 1 hit with \"Hey Ya!\" The timeless track has an upbeat energy that makes you want to shake it like a polaroid picture — until you happen to catch its rather unhappy lyrics.\n\n\"Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?\" André 3000 sings on the second verse. The line that follows may sum up its contrasting nature: \"Y'all don't wanna hear me, you just wanna dance.\"\n\nThe ability to make listeners feel (and physically react) to a wide range of emotions is part of the genius of songwriting. Tunes like \"Hey Ya!\" — a sad narrative disguised by an infectious melody — is one trick that has been mastered by Outkast, R.E.M., Smokey Robinson, Robyn and many more.\n\nIf you've ever happily boogied to a beat before realizing that the lyrics on top are actually a big bummer, you're certainly not alone. BBC and Apple Music both call such tracks Sad Bangers, a fitting name for what's become an unofficial genre over the past half-century.\n\nIn light of Mental Health Awareness Month this May, GRAMMY.com compiled a list of 15 songs that will both get you in your feelings and get your body moving.\n\nSmokey Robinson & The Miracles — \"The Tears of a Clown\" (1967)\n\nThe upbeat music on this Motown classic was written by Stevie Wonder, a 25-time GRAMMY winner who is deft at crafting tearjerkers that will tease your body into joyful dancing. The bassoon-bottomed song registers at 128 beats per minute, a tempo that's still favored by modern dance music producers. So when Smokey sings, \"The tears of a clown/When there's no one around,\" you'd be forgiven for also welling up just a little bit while you're in the groove.\n\nGloria Gaynor — \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" (1975)\n\nGloria Gaynor reimagined the Jackson 5's 1971 pop hit \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" for the disco era. The sweeping string arrangements and trotting beat helped to fill dance floors, and to make the poignant song about holding onto a love of her own. Other cover versions by Isaac Hayes and the Communards also capture the contradictory vibe.\n\nTears For Fears — \"Mad World\" (1983)\n\nBritish duo Tears For Fears became internationally known after outfitting their first danceable hit with a depressing and dramatic chorus that's hard to shake even 40 years after its release: \"I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad, the dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had.\" Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith would later release more uplifting fare, such as \"Everybody Wants to Rule The World\" and \"Sowing the Seeds of Love.\"\n\nKate Bush — \"Running Up That Hill\" (1985)\n\nKate Bush has had three twirls through charts around the world with \"Running Up That Hill,\" beginning with its 1985 release and then as an unlikely Summer Olympics closing ceremony song in 2012.\n\n\"And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God/And I'd get him to swap our places/Be running up that road/be running up that hill/With no problems,\" she sings in the chorus of the racing track, longing to be more worry-free.\n\nMore recently, a placement in the Netflix drama Stranger Things in 2022 earned the weepy, minor key-led dance number a whole new generation of fans. The English artist was recently named a 2023 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee.\n\nMidnight Oil — \"Beds Are Burning\" (1988)\n\nMidnight Oil lead singer Peter Garrett channeled the rage he felt from early climate change and the lack of Aboriginal land rights in the Australian Outback into \"Beds Are Burning.\" The powerful dance tune flooded airwaves and dance floors around the world in the late '80s, reaching No. 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\n\"How can we dance when the Earth is turning?\" he sings in the rousing chorus. \"How do we sleep while the beds are burning?\"\n\nGarrett clearly had a personal connection to the song's yearning message: He later dedicated his life to environmental activism as the leader of the Australian Conservation Foundation, and became an elected Member of Australia's House of Representatives.\n\nCrystal Waters — \"Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless)\" (1991)\n\nA house music hit about a woman without a home, \"Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless)\" helped New Jersey singer Crystal Waters achieve international success despite a somewhat somber subject. A subsequent parody on the sketch comedy series \"In Living Color\" drew attention to the contrast of having happy and upbeat instrumentation with dispiriting lyrics.\n\n\"She's just like you and me/But she's homeless, she's homeless,\" rings the chorus. \"As she stands there singing for money/La da dee la dee da…\"\n\nR.E.M. — \"Shiny Happy People\" (1991)\n\nThis upbeat collaboration is between rock group R.E.M. and B-52's singer Kate Pierson.The jangly guitar pop makes you want to clap your hands and stomp your feet, but the lyrics make you question if everything is indeed quite so shiny and happy.\n\nThe song is rumored to be about the massacre in China's Tiananmen Square, because the phrase \"Shiny Happy People\" appeared on propaganda posters. Pierson isn't so sure about that, though.\n\n\"I can't imagine that R.E.M. was thinking at the time, Oh, we want this song to be about Chinese government propaganda,\" she said in a 2021 interview with Vulture. \"It was supposed to be shiny and happy. It was a positive thing all-around.\"\n\nTLC — \"Waterfalls\" (1994)\n\n\"Waterfalls\" was a worldwide hit for TLC in 1994, thanks to its sing-along chorus and funky bassline. The song's insistent bounce softens a firm lyrical warning that pulls people back from the edge: \"Don't go chasing waterfalls/Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to/I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all/But I think you're moving too fast.\"\n\n\"We wanted to make a song with a strong message — about unprotected sex, being promiscuous, and hanging out in the wrong crowd,\" Rozonda \"Chilli\" Thomas shared with The Guardian in 2018. \"The messages in 'Waterfalls' hit home. I think that's why it's our biggest hit to date.\"\n\nOutkast — \"Hey Ya!\" (2003)\n\nAndré 3000 sings about loveless relationships to a whimsical, time-shifting dance beat on this Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping smash. The seriousness of the song — which André 3000 once explained is about \"the state of relationships in the 2000s\" — got lost among many listeners.*\n\nIts unhappy lyrics were masked by André's peppy singing, as well as the song's jangly guitar and keyboard-led groove, which infectiously doubles up in speed at the end of every four beats. Even Outkast themselves couldn't help acknowledging the song's juxtaposition in a 2021 tweet.\n\nRobyn — \"Dancing On My Own\" (2010)\n\nA penultimate example of a sad banger is \"Dancing On My Own\" by Swedish pop star Robyn. The rueful song — a top 10 hit in multiple countries — commands you to shake your stuff, while also picturing yourself watching your ex move on at the club. Calum Scott's 2016 cover really brings out the sadness that can be obscured by Robyn's uptempo version.\n\n\"Said, I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh no/And I'm right over here, why can't you see me?\" Robyn sings in the chorus. \"And I'm giving it my all/ But I'm not the girl you're taking home.\"\n\nFun. — \"Some Nights\" (2012)\n\nfun. (the trio of Jack Antonoff, Andrew Dost and Nate Ruess) is best known for the zeitgeist-grabbing pop-rock power ballad \"We Are Young,\" which is about the relentlessly positive enthusiasm of youth out on the town. The title track to their 2012 album Some Nights (which contains \"We Are Young\") is a much dancier, yet sadder song.\n\n\"What do I stand for?\" Ruess asks as your feet shuffle along to the beat. \"Most nights, I don't know anymore.\"\n\nAvicii — \"Wake Me Up\" (2013)\n\nAvicii collaborated with soulful pop singer Aloe Blacc for this worldwide chart-topper that is considered one of EDM's peak anthems. The slapping beat masks the track's sad, self-reflective lyrics about being lost.\n\nThe Swedish DJ/producer's 2018 death by suicide adds an even heavier air to Blacc's impassioned chorus: \"So wake me up when it's all over/When I'm wiser and I'm older/All this time I was finding myself, and I/I didn't know I was lost.\"\n\nFlume featuring Kai — \"Never Be Like You\" (2015)\n\n\"Never Be Like You\" isn't the fastest cut in Australian DJ/producer Flume's bass-heavy discography, but the wispy track still has an irresistible bump to it. Canadian singer Kai begs her lover not to leave her (\"How do I make you wanna stay?\"), but her lovely tone still manages to keep the song hopeful.\n\nFKA twigs featuring The Weekend — \"Tears In The Club\" (2022)\n\nPerhaps the most overt selection of this entire list is \"Tears In The Club,\" which finds FKA twigs and The Weeknd taking to the dancefloor to shake off the vestiges of a bad relationship. The singer/dancer has been candid about being in an abusive relationship, and the song is a lowkey bop that's buoyed by despairing chants such as, \"I might die on the beat, love.\"\n\nEverything But The Girl — \"Nothing Left to Lose\" (2023)\n\nNearly 30 years after DJ/producer Todd Terry helped introduce Everything But the Girl to the international dance music community with a remix of \"Missing,\" the duo leaned into their electronic side on \"Nothing Left to Lose.\" A single from their first album in 24 years, Fuse, \"Nothing Left to Lose\" features a squelching electronic bassline that contrasts the song's helpless yearning.\n\n\"I need a thicker skin/ This pain keeps getting in/ Tell me what to do/ 'Cause I've always listened to you,\" the pair's Tracy Thorne sings on the opening verse. Later, she makes a demand that fittingly sums up the conflicts of a quintessential sad banger: \"Kiss me while the world decays.\"\n\n10 Artists Who Are Outspoken About Mental Health: Billie Eilish, Selena Gomez, Shawn Mendes & More\n\nLiving Legends is a series that spotlights icons in music still going strong today. This week, GRAMMY.com presents an interview with GRAMMY winner and lead Miracle Smokey Robinson, whose contributions to the American musical canon — chiefly via Motown — cannot be overstated. In 2023, he was honored alongside Motown founder Berry Gordy at the MusiCares Persons Of The Year Event. Robinson's new album, Gasms, is available now.\n\nSmokey Robinson listens to everyone. If you're on the radio, he claims, he's heard you. It doesn't matter your age, or your genre — as the 83-year-old is still in the ring, he intends to keep his gloves up. \"I'm not a prejudiced musical listener,\" he tells GRAMMY.com. \"I've got to compete with them. I've got to know what they're doing.\"\n\nIn the middle of a question about who, specifically, he's enjoying from the new guard, his rep's drive through a tunnel abruptly ends the call. But the Miracles and Motown star's assertion checks out — partly on the strength of his new album, Gasms, his first album of new original material since 2009.\n\nOn hot-and-bothered highlights like \"I Wanna Know Your Body,\" \"Roll Around\" and \"Beside You,\" God's gift to green eyes — to borrow a phrase — proves his writing, vocal and performance abilities remain undimmed.\n\n\"My thoughts on it is that you can put it on and be with the person that you want to be with and just kick back and enjoy each other,\" Robinson told the AP. \"It's more of the idea of love.\"\n\nThere's a lot of chatter about Gasms. Of course, that's by design, and Robinson's OK with the album title subsuming the conversation. (When asked about the central thesis of the record during its conception, he responds with one word: \"Controversy.\")\n\nBut by Robinson's assertion, Gasms refers to anything that makes you feel good, and the high-thread-count music signifies far more than horny man is horny. It's a treat to hear that the GRAMMY winner responsible for innumerable culture-shifting classics — who has been around long enough to have met the Beatles when they were playing basements — is still a force.\n\nWith the 2023 MusiCares Person Of The Year gala, which jointly honored Robinson and Motown founder Berry Gordy, in the rearview, GRAMMY.com sat down with the man himself about his past, present and future. The results might give you a… well, you know.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity.\n\nHow did it feel to be honored along with your best friend, Berry Gordy, at the MusiCares Persons Of The Year 2023 gala?\n\nThat was a wonderful experience. They had never honored two people at the same time, and for me to get honored with my best friend like that — it was an extraordinary night.\n\nWhen you met all those years ago, was there any inkling your relationship would stretch so far into the future — and impact the planet on this scale?\n\nYou can't tell about people and relationships, man. We just struck up a relationship. And we were good in the very beginning, and it just lasted. I couldn't be with him then — or he with me — and say, \"Oh, well, this is gonna last forever,\" like it has, because you just never know. Fortunately, for us, it has, and we're still best friends.\n\nHow do you keep a relationship like that going on such a grand scale for decades and decades?\n\nYou know, people have asked me that many times. Sometimes, it's six months and I don't even talk to Berry. But when I do, he's my best friend, and I'm his best friend. It's never \"Let me get to know you again, or feel you out,\" or any of that. There's none of that happening.\n\nAs you've stated, the title of Gasms isn't expressly sexual. Rather, it refers to any number of mindblowing experiences. What was the last big experience in your life or career that gave you a \"gasm,\" as it were?\n\nI've had so many of those. You know, gasms are what makes you happy, and makes you feel good. Recently, I had one when I did \"American Idol,\" because I hadn't been in a long time. I was on the second panel for judges when Simon Cowell was there. I got a chance to see [judges] Lionel [Richie] and Katy [Perry] and Luke [Bryan], and it was a wonderful night.\n\nI've been a mentor; I've been a judge. \"American Idol\" is one of the main state talent programs in the world, so it's a great thing for the kids. Because before they even made a record or anything like that, from the very first auditions, being seen by millions of people is a great thing for them.\n\nLet's get to the ground floor of Gasms, when you first picked up a pen and made some calls and put together these songs. What was the central idea you wanted to put forth, musically and creatively?\n\nControversy.\n\nThat was it, huh?\n\nTo raise curiosity, and have people wondering what it was before they even heard it.\n\nIt seems you succeeded.\n\nIt worked. So I'm very happy about that, man.\n\nHow did you curate the accompanists and producers on Gasms?\n\nMost of the guys are guys I've worked with all the time in the studio. I've been working with them for years, so I didn't have to get to know them. The main guy — my arranger, David Garfield — is a well-known jazz pianist who makes his own albums and stuff like that. We just got together and did the arrangements at the studio.\n\nI'm sure you were raring to get back to original material, as wonderful as the old Miracles songs and your Christmas stuff is, and flex your songwriting muscles.\n\nI write all the time, Morgan. It's something that I just do. It's not a conscious effort where I set aside some time to write or anything like that. It doesn't happen like that. For me, it just happens.\n\nWhat are you working on lately?\n\nWell, at the same time we were working on the Gasms album, we were working on one in Spanish. I've got two more songs I've gotta re-record for that. That's what I'm up to musically.\n\nIs it a learning curve to record in another language, or are your Spanish chops sharp?\n\nI've been learning Spanish for probably about a year. My housekeeper is a Spanish lady. She's from Guatemala, and she speaks four different languages, so she's been really helping me with it.\n\nI'm not fluent in it where I understand everything. I watch the soap operas and news shows on Telemundo and stuff like that, trying to get better, but they're talking so fast. I try to get a word in every now and then and then try to pick out what they meant by the rest of the stuff.\n\nBut it's a great language, and I enjoy it very much, so I've been trying to write some songs in Spanish also.\n\n**Your voice is so pristine on Gasms. At times, it's like you haven't aged a day. How do you keep your instrument — your voice — sharp as the years and decades go by?**\n\nWell, first of all, I appreciate you saying that, man. Thank you very much.\n\nYour voice is like your instrument, and if you take care of yourself, you have a better chance of it lasting and doing well for a long time. I don't think there's any secret formula — Lipton's tea with lemon and all that stuff like that. I've never done anything like that.\n\nI just try to take care of myself. Occasionally, of course, your body will wear down and get hoarse, because you don't know how to play your instrument. I don't do any special stuff.\n\nWhat are your habits, or what's your regimen, to keep your physical vessel in shape?\n\nI think that the main one is yoga. I've been doing yoga for about 40 years, and I do it almost every day of my life. Then, I have workout programs I do. I have a half-hour workout program and then an hour one. At home, I do the full monte, because I can do everything; I have weights in the basement and so on and so forth.\n\nWhen I'm on the road, I have a 45-minute regiment that I do most mornings, and it starts with stretching.\n\n**I really enjoy how you didn't feel the need to reinvent the wheel with Gasms. The songs could have been written 60 years ago or yesterday. What is it about the timelessness of songs about love, romance and sensuality?**\n\nWell, yeah, they all have a connotation; you can use your own ideas of what they mean. For instance, \"gasms.\" That can mean whatever you want it to mean. I try to put that connotation in all of them, so whatever the person means, or who is the listener, it can be that for them.\n\n*Smokey Robinson performing in 1964.

They worshiped you, and beamed you into millions of kids' heads via \"You Really Got a Hold On Me\" on With the Beatles. And you've covered them, too. Does it feel surreal to look back to your youth, and to these recordings, and say I wrote that?\n\nYou know, I don't think about that nowadays, man, unless somebody brings it up. It's not something I concentrate on, or anything like that, but it's a wonderful thing.\n\nIt was especially wonderful — back then, they were the number one group in the world — to pick one of my songs. They were great songwriters themselves. So, to pick one of my songs to record was especially flattering.\n\nWhat are your memories of those guys?\n\nOh, they were cool dudes, man. I had met them before they became [Adds air of thunderous significance] the Beatles. We met them in Liverpool; they were singing in a little club down in the basement. They were good guys, and I especially got close to George while he was alive, you know? He was my closest friend in that group.\n\nHe sure loved you. He wouldn't have written \"Pure Smokey\" if he didn't. Can you offer more memories of George?\n\nGeorge was just a great guy, man. He was a nice man. He was one of those people that if you meet him, you like him.\n\nWith Gasms out in the world, what do you hope people take away from it?\n\nOh, take away some enjoyment. I hope they enjoy it with themselves, alone, and with others also. That's what I want them to take away from it. If I can accomplish that, then I feel that I've done what I set out to do.\n\nWhat has been giving you \"gasms\" lately? What are you watching, reading or listening to that has been inspiring you?\n\nI listen to everyone, man.\n\nI'm a music lover, so I listen to all kinds of music. Especially when I'm in my car, and there's no telling what musical mood you're going to catch me in. Weeks happen where I don't listen to anything but classical — Chopin and Rachmaninoff and all that. Sometimes, I listen to hip-hop or jazz or alternative. I just love music, man.\n\nWhat newer artists have you been checking out?\n\nAll of them, that are making music that I can hear on the radio. I listen to all of them, because I'm still making records, too. So, I've got to compete with them. I've got to know what they're doing. I'm not a prejudiced musical listener, whereas I think, OK, these are young people, so I'm not gonna listen to their music.\n\nNo, they're in the forefront of music right now. So I listen to everybody.\n\nLiving Legends: Van Morrison On New Album Moving On Skiffle, Communing With His Roots & Reconnecting With Audiences\n\nSince its founding in 1969, the Songwriters Hall of Fame has been celebrating the great songwriters and composers of our time. In 2010, it found a physical home at Downtown Los Angeles' GRAMMY Museum.\n\nNow, the GRAMMY Museum is adding to that legacy with a special expanded exhibit, which dives deep into the history of songwriting and recorded music in the United States — as well as the Songwriters Hall of Fame and its inductees' role in it. Whether you're a songwriter or musician who loves the creative process, a history nerd, or simply a music lover, this exhibit is for you.\n\nWhen you enter The Power Of Song, you'll hear the voices of legendary Songwriter Hall of Fame inductees and GRAMMY winners — including Nile Rodgers, Carole King, Diane Warren, Smokey Robinson and Jimmy Jam — discussing their creative process and some of the biggest songs they've written. Take a seat on the couch to absorb all their wisdom in the deeply informative and inspiring original short film.\n\nTurn to the right, and you'll find a timeline across the entire wall, explaining the origins and key points around songwriting and recorded music in the U.S. On the other wall, pop on the headphones provided to enjoy a video of memorable Hall of Fame ceremony performances. One interactive video interface near the entrance allows you to hear \"song highlights,\" and another allows you to explore the entire Songwriters Hall of Fame database.\n\nThe exhibit is filled with a treasure trove of handwritten song lyrics from Taylor Swift, Cyndi Lauper, Tom Petty and many more, as well as iconic artifacts, including Daft Punk's helmets, a classy Nile Rodgers GRAMMY look, and guitars from Bill Withers, Tom Petty, John Mellencamp and Toby Keith.\n\nBelow, take a look at five things we learned from The Power Of Song: A Songwriters Hall Of Fame Exhibit, which will be at the GRAMMY Museum from April 26 through Sept. 4.\n\nDaft Punk Rerecorded \"Get Lucky\" To Fit Nile Rodgers' Funky Guitar\n\nLegendary funk pioneer and superproducer Nile Rodgers is the current Chairman of the SHOF and has an active presence at the exhibit. One case features the disco-esque lime green Dior tuxedo Rodgers wore to the 2023 GRAMMY Awards, along with the shiny metallic helmets of French dance duo Daft Punk, who collaborated with Rodgers on their GRAMMY-winning 2013 album, Random Access Memories.\n\nThomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo of Daft Punk and Rodgers had forged a friendship and been wanting to collab for years prior to 2013's Record Of The Year-winning smash \"Get Lucky.\" When they finally connected and Bangalter and de Homem-Christo played the CHIC founder the demo for \"Get Lucky,\" he asked to hear it again with everything muted except the drum track, so he could create the perfect guitar lick for it.\n\nBangalter and de Homem-Christo decided to essentially re-record the whole song to fit Rodgers' guitar, which joyously drives the track — and carried it to No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, Daft Punk's first Top 5 hit.\n\n***Photo:** Rebecca Sapp*\n\nJimmy Jam & Terry Lewis Set Up Their Studio The \"Wrong\" Way Because Of Prince\n\nIn the exhibit film, Jimmy Jam tells several stories about working with — and learning from — Prince. He recalls how he and Terry Lewis watched Prince work and record everything \"in the red,\" so they set up their Minneapolis studio to follow his lead. A sound engineer told them it was too loud, but that ended up being the sound that artists like Janet Jackson and Usher came to them for. It was a \"happy mistake,\" as Jam put it, that helped their legendary careers as a powerhouse production duo take off.\n\nPrince's dogmatic, tireless work ethic also rubbed off on the powerhouse pair. One rehearsal, the Purple One kept pressing Jam to do more, which resulted in him playing two instruments, singing and hitting the choreography from behind his keyboard. \"He saw that I could do more than I thought I could; he saw me better than I saw myself,\" he reflected.\n\n\"God Bless America\" Composer Irving Berlin Didn't Read Music\n\nIn his 50 year-career, Irving Berlin wrote over 1000 songs, many of which defined American popular music for the better part of the 20th century. Along with penning \"God Bless America,\" \"White Christmas,\" \"Puttin' on the Ritz,\" and \"There's No Business Like Show Business\" (among many other classics), he wrote 17 full Broadway musical scores and contributed songs to six more plays.\n\nBerlin also wrote scores for early Hollywood musicals starring the likes of Ginger Rodgers, Fred Astaire, Marilyn Monroe, and Bing Crosby. He made a lasting, indelible mark on music, theater, film and American culture writ large.\n\nRather astonishingly, the widely celebrated American Tin Pan Alley-era composer was self-taught and didn't read sheet music. His family immigrated to New York from Imperial Russia when he was 5 years old, and when he was just 13, his father died, so he busked on the streets and worked as a singing waiter to help his family out.\n\nIn 1907, at 19, he had his first song published, and just four years later penned his first international hit, \"Alexander's Ragtime Band.\" Berlin had a natural musicality and played music by ear in the key of F-sharp, with the help of his trusted upright transposing piano, a rare instrument that had a mechanism allowing him to shift into different keys. His \"trick piano,\" as he called it, where many of his unforgettable songs first came to life, is on display at the exhibit.\n\nRead More: GRAMMY Rewind: Smokey Robinson Accepts A GRAMMY On Behalf Of The Temptations In 1973\n\nSmokey Robinson Didn't Expect \"My Girl\" To Become A Timeless Hit\n\nSmokey Robinson was an important part of Motown's hit-making factory as a singer, songwriter and producer. In the exhibit film, he discusses \"My Girl,\" one of his classic tunes, which he wrote and produced for the Temptations in 1965.\n\n\"I had no idea it would become what it would become,\" he said.\n\nHe says that people often ask him why he didn't record the unforgettable song with his group the Miracles instead of \"giving it away\" to the Temptations, but he never regretted his decision. Instead, he's honored to have created music that stands the test of time and means so much to so many people.\n\nRobinson joked that the Temptations' then-lead singer David Ruffin's gruff voice scared girls into going out with him. Really, he loved Ruffin's voice, and thought he'd sound great singing a sweet love song like \"My Girl.\" Safe to say he was right.\n\nAfter World War II, Pop Music Changed Forever\n\nPrior to World War II, American music operated as a singular mainstream market, and New York's Tin Pan Alley songwriters competed to make the next pop or Broadway hit. In a post-World War II America, especially when the early Baby Boomer generation became teenagers and young adults in the '60s and '70s, tastes changed and new styles of pop and pop songwriting emerged. As rock shook up popular culture, Tin Pan Alley gave way to a new era of young songwriters, many who worked out of just two buildings in midtown Manhattan, 1619 Broadway (the Brill Building) and 1650 Broadway.\n\nIn this richly creative and collaborative environment, powerhouse songwriting duos began to emerge and reshape pop music, challenging and balancing each other — and creating a ton of hits in the process. The hit-making duos of this diversified pop era included Burt Bacharach and Hal David (Dionne Warrick's \"That's What Friends Are For\"), Carole King and Gerry Goffin (Little Eva's \"The Loco-Motion\"), Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil (the Righteous Brothers' \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\") and Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich (the Ronettes' \"Be My Baby\" and the Crystals' \"Then He Kissed Me,\" both in collaboration with Phil Spector). In fact, there are far too many classics penned by these four prolific songwriter duos to list here.\n\nWhile there are still songwriters that pen big hit after hit for pop stars (Max Martin is still at it, as is his protege Oscar Görres), the dynamics in the industry have continued to shift with singers taking on more creative power themselves. Today's pop stars — including Ariana Grande, Dua Lipa and Taylor Swift — have found success co-writing with their own trusted teams of songwriters and producers. But as this new exhibit shows, it doesn't matter who is behind the pen — the power of song is mighty.\n\nMeet Tobias Jesso Jr., The First-Ever GRAMMY Winner For Songwriter Of The Year"
