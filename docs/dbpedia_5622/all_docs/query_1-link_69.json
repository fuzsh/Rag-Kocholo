        "text": "In Black History Month, we want to spotlight an often-overlooked giant: Bayard Rustin (1912‚Äì1987). More than just an organizer of the iconic March on Washington, Rustin was a strategist, mentor, and tireless advocate for equality whose story demands remembrance. A Key Architect of Change: Though faced with personal attacks and discrimination due to his sexuality, Rustin remained at the forefront of the Civil Rights Movement. He co-founded the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), helped establish the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and served as a close advisor to Martin Luther King Jr., shaping critical strategies like nonviolent resistance. Facing Discrimination Head-On: Openly gay during a time of immense prejudice, Rustin refused to let his identity silence him. Arrested for \"moral cause\" early in his career, he chose not to hide. His unyielding courage and commitment to justice, despite facing criticism, serve as a powerful reminder of the strength found in authenticity. A Hidden Figure, No More: While Rustin's contributions often took a backseat due to bigotry, his impact is undeniable. This February, let's honor his legacy by actively learning about his work, amplifying his story, and ensuring his crucial role in the fight for equality is never forgotten. https://lnkd.in/gpXxXudy #BlackHistoryMonth #BayardRustin #CivilRights #SocialJustice #LGBTQ+\n\nCelebrating Juneteenth: A Historic Milestone of Freedom and Progress Today, we honor Juneteenth, a pivotal moment in American history.

On one hand, there's the party aspect of things. Everything is colorful, so many companies are allying themselves with the community, so many parts of the community are highlighted... On the other hand, there's the reality of things. So many are still willing to hurt others for a rainbow, it's the only month where companies say they're allies (and really don't even show it during this month beyond a little advertising), so many laws and situations that negatively impact the community are brought up but often no plans are put into place to combat them... As a queer woman with a trans wife, I've borne witness to a lot of the nonsense that Pride brings with it. I've seen companies get bullied into no longer publicly saying they're allies. I've seen people in my state vote for an amendment to the state constitution to keep marriage between a man and a woman (this was actually the first thing to get me involved in politics, though it ended up not affecting me too much because I married my wife before she transitioned). I've seen people decide to detransition because they didn't feel safe as their authentic self. When we talk about Pride anymore, we're usually talking parades and festivals and forgetting the original meaning: being unapologetically yourself and damn the person who would try to take that from you. Yet, we give in to fear and it's largely because our allies are all too willing to step back when July starts because that's easier and better for \"the bottom line\". The LGBTQIA+ community is not just a demographic. They are your friends, your co-workers, your family. They deserve having a hand to hold and a shoulder to cry on and someone else to throw a brick or two. There is no getting rid of us. There is only breaking the symbiosis we're all supposed to have with each other to be a truly great society."
