        "text": "Gloria Gaynor is an American singer who started her career in the 60s with a group called \"The Soul Satisfiers\".\n\nSlow start to a career despite the release of two Singles, \"Will you be my guy\" and \"She’ll be sorry\" (title released for the first time under her real name) in 1965.\n\nShe will have to wait 10 years and the year 1975 to finally be recognized at the height of her talents thanks to the release of a title that will profoundly change her destiny, namely the intergalactic hit \"Never can say goobye\". Flagship title from the self-titled album.\n\nThe same year, the album \"Experience Gloria Gaynor\" was released, with less success but which produced some minor hits like \"Casanova brown\" and \"Let’s make a deal\".\n\nSlight public disaffection for the albums \"Glorious\" of 1977 and \"Park avenue sound\" 1978.\n\nBut the adventure started all over again in 1978 when the album \"Love tracks\" was released, an album from which was going to be extracted which would become one of the biggest hits of the last 35 years, namely the enormous \"I will survive\". It’s a global tidal wave. The notoriety of the singer literally explodes.\n\nThe year 1979 saw the release of the album \"I have a right\" which could not compete with the dizzying success of the previous one. Album that still produces the hit \"Let me know (I have a right)\".\n\nThe beginning of 80 is more complicated with 3 semi-failures in a row.\n\nFirst the album \"Stories\" which came out in 1980, then \"I kinda like me\" which came out in 1981 and finally \"Gloria Gaynor\" which came out in 1982. All three struggled to find their public, the Disco current being in full swing disaffection.\n\nBack in force in 1983 with the album \"I am Gloria Gaynor\" which saw her win a new mega hit with the title \"I am what I am\", certainly less prestigious than the previous two but mega hit anyway. Title which makes a huge success in particular in the Gay community.\n\nThis flagship title will be her last notorious success and the release of other albums will not allow her to return to lasting success.\n\nAnyway, she will leave in contemporary musical history 3 of the biggest hits of all time, hits that still vibrate many dance floors on the planet today.\n\nTo discover or rediscover...\n\nDiscography (among others ...) :\n\n60sDecade :\n\n• She'll be sorry 1965\n\n70sDecade :\n\n• Honey bee 1974\n\n• Never can say goobye 1974\n\n• Reach out, I'll be there 1975\n\n• Walk on by 1975\n\n• All I need is your sweet lovin' 1975\n\n• Do it yourself 1975\n\n• How high the moon 1975\n\n• Touch of lightning 1976\n\n• Let’s make a deal 1976\n\n• I've got you under my skin 1976\n\n• We can start all over again 1977\n\n• Life ain't worth living 1977\n\n• Most of all 1977\n\n• You're all I need to get by 1978\n\n• This love affair 1978\n\n• Substitute 1978\n\n• I will survive 1978\n\n• Anybody wanna party ? 1979\n\n• I said yes 1979\n\n• Love is just a heartbeat away 1979\n\n• Let Me Know (I Have a Right) 1979\n\n80sDecade :\n\n• Midnight rocker 1980\n\n• Tonight 1980\n\n• Let's Mend What's Been Broken 1981\n\n• I kinda like me 1982\n\n• Tease me 1982\n\n• Stop in the name of love 1983\n\n• America 1983\n\n• I am what I am 1983\n\n• Strive 1984\n\n• My love is music 1985\n\n• Don't You Dare Call It Love 1986\n\n• Be soft with me tonight 1987\n\n90sDecade :\n\n• First be a woman 1992\n\n• Together we can 1992\n\n• Mighty high 1997\n\n• Oh what a life 1997\n\n2000sDecade :\n\n• Last night 2000\n\n• Just keep thinking about you 2001\n\n• I never knew 2002\n\nTracks :\n\n1965... who would imagine in this year 1965 that this young singer of 22 years old then totally unknown will become in a few decades one of the greatest singers of the American music scene ? Not many people, that's for sure...\n\n1974 ... we find her 9 years later and this time will be the right one. Here she won the first success of a career that would prove to be one of the most fruitful of all...\n\n1974 ... the mega intergalactic hit that set all Dancefloor on fire and elevated her One Shot to the rank of planetary star. She signs here one of the biggest Dance hits of the 70s and of the end of the XXth century. All on a cover of the Jacksons 5. And yes, originally, it was them who first interpreted this legendary title ...\n\n1975 ... once again in cover mode, this time targeting a Four Tops title. And it works again, new top hit !\n\n1975 ... this time, Dionne Warwick is the model. Well, Gloria, at some point, you will have to do something new ...\n\n1975 ... unfortunately, when it is new, the title goes somewhat unnoticed despite a significant quality. It doesn't necessarily help...\n\n1975...ahhh, finally something new that works. And it pulsates seriously, to say the least. Like what, when she wants...\n\n1975 ... and we go back to luxury covers with this time a title by Benny Goodman. 100 % Disco version !\n\n1976...a change of year that rhymes with finesse and lightness. Despite a more than certain melodic quality, this title will pass somewhat 'through'. Strange...\n\n1976 ... Gloria is now at cruising speed and the heavyweight titles follow one another at an impressive speed ...\n\n1976...covering a title by Cole Porter dating from 1936 and interpreted at the time by Virginia Bruce is a daring bet, especially when it is made into a Dance title. Dared bet but successful bet in any case...\n\n1977 ... a mixed year which saw no major hit produced by her. It's to better prepare for the incredible suite that is looming on the horizon...\n\n1977 ... even if there will be no notorious success recorded that year, what she offers in any case is far from devoid of interest. Anyway, we'll be happy with that...\n\n1977... in an ocean of Dance titles, she still manages to regularly offer titles with finesse which also work particularly well. What talent !\n\n1978...a year 1978 which starts calmly with this 'little' hit. But it could be that the end of the year is very different from its beginning, that's clear...\n\n1978...another year rich in titles but most of which will have had only a limited level of success. Yet she puts an obvious good will...\n\n1978...this one won't do much better than its predecessor. But given the incredible title on the horizon, the best is yet to come, that's for sure !\n\n1978 ... here she signs her biggest hit and probably one of the biggest Dance hits of all time. A musical monument of the 20th century all by itself. MAS-TER-FUL !\n\n1979 ... impossible to match the previous gem in terms of success as the bar is high. We will therefore be content with this new 'little' big hit ...\n\n1979...another title that will pass 'through' despite a certain quality. It must be said that she releases so many titles that it would be a real achievement if they all ended up at No.1 in the Charts...\n\n1979...the number of full Disco titles is really impressive. Surely one of the biggest suppliers of titles in this field at the end of the 1970s...\n\n1979...a 70s decade that ended in the best of ways with this new top hit. A decade of the 70s which will have consecrated her as one of the biggest singers of the moment and this is only fair reward !\n\n1980...a change of decade that rhymes with a brutal fall in the Charts. She's going to have to reinvent herself and quickly, otherwise the exit door risks getting closer...\n\n1980... a daring bet to revisit one of the key titles of 'West Side Story' in Disco mode. It starts from a good feeling but the result will be far from thrilling the public at first sight...\n\n1981 ... the beginning of the decade in a mixed color due to a Disco-Funk transition that the singer has trouble negotiating ...\n\n1982 ... she accumulates underperformances at the start of this decade, despite an obvious desire to do well. But when the fate is contrary, difficult to fight...\n\n1982...we still feel like a semblance of evolution. She finally realized that she must absolutely adapt to the latest musical trends and quickly...\n\n1983...a year 1983 which started quietly with this little hit. Small hit at the beginning of the year but of anthology at the end of the year. Patience, patience...\n\n1983...it won't be this time either. But given the huge title that comes behind, it's well worth the wait a little longer...\n\n1986 ... this time, she plays the soft force version. Another novelty for her. She will have tried everything ...\n\n1987 ... a magnificent Ultimate Slow as the last success of the decade. Like what, nothing is ever finished. MAAAA-GIIIICCCC !\n\n1992 ... she will even attempt the transition to the 90s. And the result is once again up to par but the title will go completely under the radar ...\n\n1997 ... and we find her 10 years later in House mode. Yes Yes, it's possible. That's what I said, she will have done everything for us ! But what a career !\n\n1997... she confirms it herself with this title 'Oh what a life'. What a life, what a career, what an incredible destiny. But she only owes it to one thing : her talent !\n\n2000 ... here she came in 2000, who would have believed it ?! A truly incredible career that never ends and that never ceases to surprise us !\n\n2001 ... and it continues ! But how does she do it ? Already its 4th decade of activity and still as dashing. Like what, music, it keeps !\n\n2002 ... but this time, it is indeed the end. The end of an extraordinary adventure for one of the greatest singers of all time. Finally with an exit through the very large door. What more !\n\n2022...\n\n2023...\n\n2023...\n\nWiki :\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Gaynor\n\nOfficial Website :\n\nhttps://www.gloriagaynor.com/\n\nGreatest Hits :\n\nhttps://www.deezer.com/us/artist/303\n\nDiscography :"
