        "text": "The first large pride parade in the U.S. was in 1970, on the first anniversary of the riots at Stonewall Inn. It is generally accepted by historians that Stonewall (1969) marked the beginning of widespread LGBT visibility in the States.\n\nWhile Stonewall marked a significant shift for public LGBT representation, its frontrunners are still erased to this day. The 2015 movie “Stonewall” puts a white gay man, Danny, at the forefront of the riots, even though they were actually led primarily by trans women of color.\n\nIn response to backlash from the LGBT community, director Roland Emmerich had this to say:\n\nFor straight people, [Danny] is a very easy in. Danny’s very straight-acting. (…) [Straight audiences] can feel for him.\n\n“Straight-acting”? When I think of “straight-acting”, I think of this scene from “In & Out” (1997):\n\nObviously this isn’t what all straight people are like. “In & Out” intentionally hyperbolizes what it means to be a heterosexual man. Anybody who knows who Prince is can tell you that.\n\n“Straight-acting”, rather, refers to a gay character who can be mistaken as straight — they’re not “in-your-face” about their orientation.\n\nMany argue that gay characters shouldn’t have to be “in-your-face”, which is true… but why can’t they? Roland Emmerich suggesting that Danny’s character is an “easy-in” for straight audiences implies that unless audiences can easily identify Danny as a fellow heterosexual, it’s difficult for them to sympathize with his plight.\n\nMatt Baume, a Youtuber who frequently makes videos about LGBT history, says:\n\nObviously Roland didn’t pick up on any of the lessons from the actual riots, which were all about fighting for the right to not have to be “straight-acting”. (…) In 1969, when the Stonewall riots happened, if you could pass as straight, you didn’t need to throw any bricks.\n\nI don’t think Emmerich gives straight audiences enough credit. Is it really that difficult to sympathize with somebody different? Do gay people on screen really have to minimize their gayness to appease straight people?\n\nWhile “over-the-top” gay people are mostly shown in media to stereotype, many LGBT people do embrace flamboyance, because being LGBT is oftentimes a significant part of one’s identity. The only time we see flamboyant LGBT personalities in the media, however, is usually to frame LGBT people as a joke.\n\nA character who would be so blatantly LGBT (like the aforementioned Marsha P. Johnson) at the forefront of “Stonewall” would be comedic, because that’s how the media has conditioned viewers to respond to people so non-discreet. Not only that, but pre-op (pre-operative) trans people are hard for the bulk of society to take seriously after being so bombarded by images of straight men dressing as women for a comedic effect. LGBT people shouldn’t have to fight to be taken seriously, no matter how they present themselves.\n\nDirectly after Stonewall, public acceptance of LGBT identities increased throughout the 70’s, with gay-themed TV movies, films that explicitly and positively portrayed homosexuality, the election of pro-gay Edward Koch to Congress, the establishment of Gay Pride Week, and the removal of homosexuality from the American Psychiatric Association’s list of psychiatric disorders — just to name a few.\n\nWith the beginning of the 80’s, however, came AIDS.\n\n“Denial, secrecy, dread. These are the hallmarks of homosexuality in Hollywood today. Gone are the comparative openness and liberalism of the 70s, and in their place is a climate of fear.” (Mary Murphy, “The AIDS Scare,” TV Guide, 22 October 1988, 6.)\n\nIn their book “Queer Images: A History of Gay and Lesbian Film in America”, authors Sean Griffin and Harry M. Benshoff chronicle the history of American media responses to the rise of HIV/AIDS in particular detail.\n\nPrior to 1985, AIDS was widely ignored by large-scale media outlets, and when it was discussed it was generally unsympathetic towards gay victims.\n\n“The media also tended to configure people with AIDS as either innocent (women and children who had gotten the disease inadvertently from blood transfusions) or deserving (intravenous drug users and sexual active gay men whose allegedly chosen “abhorrent lifestyles” had caused their illness).” (Queer Images, 203)\n\nBut with 1985 came Rock Hudson’s tragic announcement.\n\n“AIDS awareness shifted a great deal around 1985, when classical Hollywood actor Rock Hudson acknowledged in the press that he was dying of AIDS. Suddenly there was a face to the crisis that was recognizable to most of America (as opposed to shadowy homosexuals and drug users), and media coverage of the syndrome increased.” (Queer Images, 203)\n\nIs this yet another instance of the public favoring “straight-acting” gay and bisexual men?\n\nIn an interview with People in 2015, Lee Garlington talks about dating the actor from 1962 to 1965. Private eye Fred Otash also had possession of an audio file from 1958 of Hudson’s then-wife confronting him about his attraction to men.\n\nHowever, as one can imagine, Hudson wasn’t public about any of this. As far as America knew, he was a straight man. Women wanted him and men wanted to be him. He changed the media climate surrounding AIDS because he wasn’t feminine, flamboyant or even openly LGBT. He was, as Roland Emmerich previously put it, an easy-in for straight people learning about AIDS.\n\nUnlike the short-lived LGBT liberation of the 1970’s, the hostility towards AIDS unfortunately lasted more than just a decade.\n\nIn 1991, ACT UP sent out a thousand letters to Academy members asking them to speak about AIDS during their acceptance speeches and to wear a “Silence = Death” button, also included in the mailing. Only Longtime Companion nominee Bruce Davison and Susan Sarandon wore the buttons to the ceremony.” (Queer Images, 251)\n\nMichelangelo Signorile’s book “Queer in America” also points out that “A number of nominated films [in the 1991 Academy Awards] were especially homophobic, and critic Gene Siskel agreed, telling CBS This Morning that “Hollywood is getting what is coming to it.”\n\nSerophobia (prejudice against AIDS victims) in the U.S. didn’t just last into the 90’s — it remains rampant today, indicating a continuation of social stigmas against LGBT people.\n\nNow, HIV and AIDS affect people far beyond those in the LGBT community, but men who have sex with men (MSM) still make up the vast majority. As of the Centers for Disease Control’s latest study in 2014, MSM account for 56% of people living with HIV in the United States, and 70% of all new HIV infections per year. With this information, it suffices to say that to not care about HIV and AIDS patients today is to not care about the persistent suffering of the LGBT community.\n\nThat being said, just in the past week, six members of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS resigned, stating in a Newsweek op-ed:\n\nAs advocates for people living with HIV, we have dedicated our lives to combating this disease and no longer feel we can do so effectively within the confines of an advisory body to a president who simply does not care.\n\nAn administration that doesn’t care about victims of HIV/AIDS? That sounds familiar.\n\nTo me, policy and media are inextricably linked. If HIV and AIDS were all over the news, in movies, in television, etc… would it have been as easy for Reagan to ignore the suffering of LGBT people for so long? If they were everywhere today, would it be as easy for Trump to ignore? I don’t know. But I’d like to think that just representation can achieve a lot more than visibility alone.\n\nSure, there are plenty of inconspicuous LGBT characters, as represented in “Stonewall”. But the U.S. is still afraid of conspicuous LGBT people — people that are vocal about their identity. People that are unavoidably LGBT.\n\nThat’s why I loved Denver Pridefest so much, despite my ultimate demise. I looked up and saw thousands of LGBT flags waving in the air. I looked down and saw proclamations of gayness scribbled on the sidewalk in rainbow chalk. Nobody can look at the drag queens, the “HUG A STUD” t-shirts, and the jockstraps and think to themselves, “This isn’t gay”. There is nothing straight-acting about it.\n\nEven giving fictional monsters LGBT identities forces straight and cisgender (abbrev. cishet) people to see their own, non-inherently-LGBT media in a new light.\n\nEvery day, cishets saturate media, often at the expense of just LGBT representation. Every June, however, cishet people can’t get away from us. They can’t pretend we don’t exist. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple (and now, black and brown) are plastered across every major brand, every website, every billboard. Just this month, Google donated $1 million to preserving the memory of Stonewall.\n\nThe media embracing Pride Month is a long-anticipated shift away from its usual embrace of heteronormativity and rejection of outright gayness. It makes me feel visible.\n\nSo, as I sat in that porta potty, fighting for what briefly felt like my life, I thought to myself, “at least I can still read the ‘I’M GAY AS ****’ written on my shirt”."
