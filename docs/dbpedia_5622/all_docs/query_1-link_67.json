        "text": "by Sheldon Rocha Leal\n\nPost the successful release of Kylie’s 16th studio album, “Tension”, I thought I’d reflect on the career of this Pop music icon, who shows us how a Pop star should conduct their affairs in their profession. For the longest time she was written off as a poor man’s Madonna, the Queen of Pop, and to be honest there was little separating the two at the beginning. As time has moved on, however, Kylie has evolved, matured and cemented her place in the annals of Pop music lore, carving her own path and developing her own unique brand. The wheels turned full circle when The Queen of Pop herself paid tribute to the diminutive diva in 2000 by performing at the MTV Europe Awards wearing a T-shirt with Kylie’s name emblazoned on it. This was an acknowledgement, by one of the biggest selling artists of all time, that the diva is indeed a significant force in the Pop music world and as a Pop culture icon.\n\nReflecting on the progression of Kylie’s career, six distinct eras emerge as important milestones in the development of her brand: SAW, Deconstruction, Comeback, The Recovery albums, Roc Nation and the Darenote era. These epochs are touchstone moments in her career and although they may not have always been intentional they have been essential in the formulation of a star that today holds her own in the business. Some of the eras were more successful than others, but at the end of the day she needed to go through all of them to stand before us as the star she is today. In this article I aim to explore these eras, culminating in the refined brand and product we see today.\n\nAlthough some people know Kylie as a successful Australian soap opera actress who appeared on “Neighbours”, she started her career aged 12 on the show “Skyways”, followed by a role in “The Henderson Kids”. In 1986, aged 18, she got cast in “Neighbours” as Charlene Robinson. That is where she met future Pop star, Jason Donovan, who was her love interest on the show. Their wedding on the show in 1987 was watched by 20million people in Australia and the U.K. She got her music break, by chance, when a music executive from Mushroom Records watched her perform “The Locomotion”, originally performed by Little Eva in 1962, at a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert in 1987. Kylie used some of her money to record “The Locomotion” with “Neighbours” musical director Greg Petherick, who along with the song’s producer, Kaj Dahlstrom, shopped it around.\n\nShe was rejected by various recording labels, including CBS, but after Kaj sent the track to Mushroom Records A&R Amanda Pelham, who shared it with the company’s owner, Michael Gudinski, she got her break. She was signed as a novelty act because of the fame she acquired on “Neighbours”. At the time Mike Duffy, a producer from Stock Aitken and Waterman (SAW), was completing a residency at Mushroom records and was given the Dahlstrom track to give it more of a SAW sound, which was all the rage at the time. Gudinski wanted to tap into the SAW success which included hits with Dead or Alive and Bananarama. The track was released two weeks after the Kylie and Jason Donovan wedding on “Neighbours” and a week after its released it peaked at No1 in Australia.\n\nKylie flew to the U.K. and met with Stock Aitken and Waterman, cutting Duffy out of the equation. When Pete Waterman heard the track he thought it was rubbish and re-recorded it adding his own spice at The Hit Factory. The SAW version of the song, released in 1988, peaked at No2 U.K., No3 USA and No1 in Belgium, RSA, Finland, Ireland, Israel and Japan. Anecdotally when Kylie flew to London, the SAW team had forgotten she was arriving and spent 10 days in her hotel room waiting for them to call her. They eventually called her on her last day in London, having no clue of what to do with her. Whilst she waited at reception the guys wrote “I Should Be So Lucky” and recorded it in 40 minutes, and told her to go home. The song went to No1 in Australia and U.K. She returned to London later to record “Got Be Certain”, which was another hit.\n\nHer debut album, “Kylie, was eventually released in June 1988 and was a major smash, peaking at No2 Australia/No1 U.K., shipping over 5million units internationally, of which 2million were shipped in the U.K. She became the youngest female artist in U.K. history to have a No1 album (she was 21), a record held until Avril Lavigne took “Let Go” to No1 in 2002 (18 at the time). The album also held the distinction of being the most successful debut album by a foreign act in British history. The SAW collaboration, in association with Mushroom Records, yielded four studio albums, including “Kylie”, and one greatest hits compilation released through PWL. Although SAW helped make Kylie and international star, allowing her to tap into a hitmaking factory that were responsible for the prevailing Pop sound, the scope of their journey would always be limited.\n\nThe SAW hit making model was very similar to that of Motown, in which the main protagonists (Stock, Aitken and Waterman) were responsible for the sound, songwriting and exploitation of the various artists in their roster. Whilst this is a brilliant model to create stars, from a long term perspective, relating to artist development and career sustainability, it’s not that great as it restricts an artist’s agency within the auspices of the recording arrangement. Initially the formula was very successful generating various stars including Banarama, Dead or Alive, Rick Astley, Sonia, Mel & Kim, Samantha Fox, Jason Donovan and Mandy Smith. They even helped revive the careers of Donna Summer and Gloria Gaynor. But by the early 1990s cracks started to emerge between the three guys, hits were few and far between and Matt Aitken eventually left.\n\nBy the time her 4th studio album, “Let’s Get To It” (1991), was released, album sales were down, she wasn’t churning out hits and the reviews for the album were poor. Although in my estimation it was not a bad album, it is one of her worst performing, only peaking at No15 U.K. At that point audiences were growing weary of the cheesy sound, which didn’t seem to be evolving, with many finding Kylie to be a cringeworthy artist. After the terms of her contract with SAW were fulfilled, post the release of “Greatest Hits” (1992), they decided not to renew her contract. I posit that Kylie needed this rejection, at this point, as she needed to find her own unique sound and outlet for creative self-expression, which would have not been permitted in a hit making factory such as SAW.\n\nHer departure from PWL ushered in an affiliation with the underground dance recording label Deconstruction Records. In this era, which lasted two albums and a greatest hits compilation, Kylie experimented with various genres of music, including experimental Pop, Alternative Rock, Indie and even Asian sounds. This phase brought her to the end of her first decade as recording artist. Both the “Kylie Minogue” (1994) and “Impossible Princess” (1997) albums received mixed reviews and are two of her worst performing albums, No4 and 5 respectively in the U.K. In my opinion audiences were tired of Kylie, they didn’t understand what she was trying to achieve and probably felt she was overreaching, trying too hard. In this era there was even a duet with the Australian Rock Star Nick Cave and his band the Bad Seeds, the murder ballad “Where The Wild Roses Grow”.\n\nThe Deconstruction Era, in my estimation, is probably her most creatively diverse era, and although the sound and image were erratic and confused, the music wasn’t bad. Both albums are quite good and some of my favorite tracks on the “Kylie Minogue” album include “Confide In Me”, “Put Yourself In My Place”, “Automatic Love” and the M-People produced “Time Will Pass You By”. From “Impossible Princess” the stand out tracks include “Some Kind Of Bliss”, “Did It Again” and “Breathe”. Kylie was clearly an artist trying to find her “groove”, but audiences weren’t having it and after six years and poor sales the recording label and Kylie decided to part ways in 1998.\n\nIn my opinion, she needed to go through this and experience the disapproval from the market in order to enter the next phase of her career, which saw her come back bigger than ever. The Deconstruction Era ended with the release of the “Hits+” compilation in 2000, which only peaked at No41 U.K./No63 Australia, a far cry from the success of “Greatest Hits” (1992) (No1 U.K./No3 Australia). It took Kylie about three years to get herself together and in 1999 she signed a recording deal with Parlophone Records, at a time when many thought her career was over. What people didn’t know was that she had been working on her comeback with Brothers in Rhythm, who had previously worked with Alanis Morissette, Pet Shop Boys, Garbage, Seal, Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson. The Comeback Era consisted of three albums: “Light Years” (2000); “Fever” (2001) and “Body Language” (2003).\n\nThis era is possibly her most commercially successful. It was apt that she started this new phase with the “Light Years” (2000) album, as although her new sound was true to the original Kylie, it was light years from where she started. The first album, in the hat trick, was phenomenally successful peaking at No2 U.K./No1 Australia, shipping over 1.2million units worldwide, a far cry from the 250,000 units shipped of “Impossible Princess” in 1997. The first single from the album was “Spinning Around” co-written by Paula Abdul and Kara DioGuardi and peaked at No1 U.K./Australia. The song was a revolution and brought Kylie back into the international spotlight. The entire record was brilliant and features two additional No2 U.K. hit singles, “Kids” a duet with Robbie Williams and “On A Night Like This”. The album contains a distinct Disco influence, barring the Rock inspired “Kids”.\n\n“Light Years” lay the foundation for the phenomenally successful “Fever” released a year later (2001). The album peaked at No1 U.K., Australia, Germany, Ireland and Russia and No3 in the USA and shipped over 6million units worldwide, making it her most commercially successful album. The lead single “Can’t Get You Out Of My Head”, co-written by Cathy Dennis and Rob Davis is her most commercially successful single to date, having shipped over 5million units internationally and peaked at No1 U.K., Australia and 19 other countries, as well as No7 USA. She was even nominated for 2 Grammy awards and won one in 2004 in the category Best Dance Recording for “Come Into My World”. In total 4 singles from the album hit the Top 10 in the U.K.: “Love @ First Sight” (No2), “In Your Eyes” (No3) and “Come Into My World” (No8).\n\nAlthough not one of my favorite albums, I prefer “Light Years”, the fact that “Fever” resonated with so many people is undeniable. This new found success is a testament to Kylie’s commitment to music, creation and her career, as not merely a piece of Pop confectionary, but rather an artist who consistently hones her craft and challenges herself. The fact that 14 years into her career she was able to pull off such a major coup is an indication of her star power and phenomenal work ethic. The last album in the Comeback era was “Body Language” (2003) which didn’t fare as well as the previous two albums, only peaking at No6 U.K./No2 Australia. Although it charted lower than “Light Years” it was more commercially successful shipping 1,5million units globally. I really love this album, it is a more sophisticated and moodier album than its predecessors. It also features three of my favorite Kylie tracks, “Slow” (No1 U.K./Australia), “Red Blooded Woman” (No5 U.K./No4 Australia) and “Chocolate” (No6 U.K./No14 Australia).\n\nHer streak was interrupted two months into her “Showgirl: The Greatest Hits Tour” in 2005 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Fans were shocked by the revelation and celebrities rallied around her, including Madonna who sent her wishes for a speedy recovery. Reflecting on her battle with cancer, Kylie said in an interview in 2020 that she gained a new perspective on life and a renewed focus on doing things she is passionate about, including making music. Although she says that things were placed on hold at the time, and that she struggled with depression, she says she came out of the ordeal a more positive person, ready to tackle any challenge. A year and a half later she was back on the road concluding the concert tour she was forced to interrupt in 2005, this time rebranded “Showgirl: The Homecoming Tour”. The two iterations of the show generated over $60million USD.\n\nJust a year after her diagnosis she was back in the recording studio, recording the first of two albums that marked her comeback post the disease and marking the beginning of her Recovery Era. “X”, also her 10th studio album, was released in 2007 and “Aphrodite” was released in 2010. The two albums also marked the beginning of Kylie’s second decade as a recording artist. I’m a bigger fan of “Aphrodite” than “X”, finding the former more sophisticated in sound than the latter. Also she seemed to be experimenting with more Rock sounds on “X” than the other album, which was more dance focused. Whilst “X” shipped over 1million units internationally and peaked at No4 U.K./No1 Australia, “Aphrodite” peaked at No1 U.K./ No2 Australia and shipped just over 700,000 units. “2 Hearts” was a stand out track from “X”, with its bombastic glam rock feel, something completely unusual for the singer, and peaked at No1 Australia/No4 U.K.\n\nThe stand out tracks on “Aphrodite” were “All The Lovers” (No3 U.K./No13 Australia), “Get Outta My Way” (No12 U.K.), “Aphrodite”, “Put Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love)” and “Better Than Today”. In total 4 No1 US Dance hits were emerged from the “Aphrodite” album. Both albums are quite reflective and darker than her previous output, but considering her situation it’s completely understandable. This era personifies Kylie’s grit, determination, resilience, discipline and commitment to her art. It is astounding that someone, having undergone such a life changing situation, was still able to keep her finger on the pulse of popular culture and deliver such excellence, such a short time after her disease scare. The Recovery Era came to an end with “The Abbey Road Sessions” compilation album, which consisted of reworked orchestral versions of some of Kylie’s biggest hits. The album peaked at No2 U.K./No7 Australia and shipped over 230,000 units in the U.K. alone.\n\nIn 2012 Kylie split from her manager of 25 years, Terry Blamey. After the ordeal of her breast cancer, recovery and the pressures of her career it seems she needed something else, a new perspective, some time to reflect and mostly she wanted to “shake things up”. But this was not to be, because shortly after the split (about 2 months later in February) in 2013 it was announced that she would now be managed by Jay-Z’s Roc Nation. The association was short and only included one album titled “Kiss Me Once”, which was released in 2014. She worked with some amazing talent on this album including Pharrell Williams, Greg Kurstin, Cutfather, Wayne Hector, Sia, Karen Poole and The Monsters & The Strangerz. The album featured more of an R&B/Pop/Dance sound, which was different for Kylie. Although the album peaked at No1 Australia/No2 U.K. it only shipped 200,000 units worldwide.\n\nIn this era she also served as a judge on The Voice U.K. and Australia, but by 2015 it was all over. But she didn’t allow moss to grow under her feet and quickly negotiated a one album deal, with Parlophone to be distributed by Warner Bros., to release her first Christmas album, “Kylie Christmas”. What I loved about the album is that she wrote new material and the featured covers are not the standard ones other artists usually rely in these types of projects. I love the Disco flavoured “100 Degrees”, which is a duet with her sister Dannii Minogue. It wasn’t her best performing album, only peaking at No12 U.K./No7 Australia, but it did help usher her “independent era”.\n\nIn 1990 it seems Kylie established a company called Darenote through which payments were received and processed for work she did, e.g. endorsements, promotions, acting or merchandising. There are three active directors in the company: Kylie, Nigel Graham Jones (a lawyer) and her brother Brendan Minogue. Previously her mother, Carol Minogue, was a secretary at the company. In 2005, the year of her diagnosis, the company registered a loss, but these fortunes were soon reversed and by 2009 it posted a £4.1million profit. The process of negotiating the once off deal with Parlophone for the Christmas album probably inspired her to do things on her own terms and in 2017 she signed a deal with BMG Rights Management through her company Darenote. This essentially turned her company into a Recording Label making the Princess of Pop an Independent Artist.\n\nThis deal liberated Kylie from the constraints of a major recording label, afforded her total creative control over her output and with the changing music industry landscape it gave her more autonomy with regards to releases. This was the beginning of the Darenote era, which has to date spawned three albums: “Golden” (2018), “Disco” (2020) and “Tension” (2023). The first album saw Kylie explore Country music, recording the majority of the tracks in Nashville and the USA. Although the album peaked at No1 U.K./Australia and received critical acclaim, commercially it was not very successful, shipping just over 180,000 units worldwide. Kylie co-wrote all the songs on the album, and creatively it saw the Princess stretching her creative muscle. It is not one of my favorite albums, but I know many fans love it.\n\nHer next album, “Disco”, was recorded during the hard Covid lockdown. This album is an absolute triumph critically and commercially. It peaked at No1 U.K./Australia and No26 USA, her highest peaking album in the country since “Aphrodite” peaked at No19 in 2010. Furthermore it shipped over 700,000 units worldwide, her most commercially successful album in 10 years. Kylie became the first female artist in British history to have No1 albums in five consecutive decades (1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s). “Disco” is a vibrant album exhibiting the urgency of an artist that has just started on their career journey, whilst displaying the sophistication of an artist of Kylie’s caliber and experience.\n\nMost recently Kylie released “Tension”, which became her 9th No1 album in the U.K. (and third in a row) and 8th in Australia. It was also the No3 album in the world in its opening week, shipping more than 120,000 units. The album had a retro 1980s audio aesthetic and could have easily been an album Kylie released at the beginning of her career. “Tension” her 16th studio album cements Kylie’s legacy as a dominant force in the Pop music world and specifically amongst Dance artists. The amazing thing is that she has done this all on her terms, as an independent artist, dictating the terms of her engagement with the music business world. All of this in a new music industry dispensation that has completely changed from when she originally started.\n\nKylie’s manager, Polly Bhowmik, has conveyed that the singer has no intention of slowing down. She has a Vegas residency, “More Than Just A Residency”, at the Voltaire launching in November, projects planned until 2025 and has even started conceptualising a 17th and 18th studio album. The Princess of Pop is an example of the fact that sometimes one needs to fail to succeed. She has embraced every phase of her career as a challenge to hone her craft and come back stronger than before. The singer is a testament to the fact that in order to succeed at anything one needs to invest the time and energy in the development of one’s craft, trying out new things, whilst remaining true and honest to one’s brand. She exudes discipline, restraint, perseverance, grace, class, resilience and grit, something with which many young hopefuls struggle.\n\nAt the end of the day, the only path to longevity and success in any career is the willingness to be conscious of one’s career trajectory, reevaluate, realign, re-strategise and keep audiences coming back for something fresh and new. This is exactly what Kylie has so successfully achieved, coming out of a litany of critiques stronger and more successful. It is clear that she is honest and loves doing what she does, and for that the fans keep on coming back. With 80million records shipped and 16 studio albums, she has gone from the little girl who seemed to be imitating her more successful counterparts, to a Pop Culture icon that has crafted her own space in the music business. I can’t wait to hear what she has in store for us going into the future, but until then we’ll keep on “Spinning” the amazing records we have."
