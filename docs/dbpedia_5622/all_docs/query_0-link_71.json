        "text": "One of the most successful strategies I've had in collecting 45s is to look for certain producers and arrangers whose work I'm familiar with. The list on this page is very short comparatively, and concentrates on producers from the 1960s-80s. These are individuals who had a large enough impact on the Rock 'n' Soul marketplace to influence trends and whose consistent work makes picking up unknown 45s with their names on them a good bet. If you like the work of one producer on this list, chances are you'll like other 45s they worked on as well. This is a companion list to other ones I'm preparing for collecting arrangers and songwriters; some producers listed here also appear on the songwriters page. Not included are producers whose work is not so distinctive that their presence on a 45 record's label may not be a good guide to whether you'll like other records they worked on (for example, Jerry Wexler and Tom Johnston).\n\nLong-time 45 collectors understand that the universe of music released on 45 records is so vast it seems to just keep expanding as your collection grows. Counter-intuitive maybe, but true. In such a world, keying on who produced, arranged, or wrote a given song or artist you've never heard of before can lead to some excellent finds.\n\nThe list below is just a suggestion, and I plan to expand it as time permits. The artists are listed in alphabetical order. If you know of a producer who should be here and isn't, please send a note through the Classic 45s Comments form. Last Updated 08/05/16 with about 40 producers.\n\nSteve Barri | Jeff Barry | Thom Bell | Bert Berns | Mike Chapman | Bob Crewe | Steve Cropper | Carl Davis | Don Davis | Dave Edmunds | Feldman-Goldstein-Gottehrer | Gamble-Huff | Henry Glover | Rick Hall | Holland-Dozier-Holland | Quincy Jones | Kasenetz-Katz | Lambert-Potter | Leiber-Stoller | Steve Lillywhite | Nick Lowe | Madara-White | George Martin | Curtis Mayfield | Van McCoy | Huey P.
