        "text": "Todd L. Burns\n\nThis is the most excited I've been for a lecture from MontrÃ©al, because these two men, and a couple of other people who are actually in the audience, are the architects, the pioneers of the sound of MontrÃ©al disco. Please help me welcome Robert Ouimet, Pierre Gagnon. (applause)\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nBonjour.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nHello.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nPierre, I wanted to start with you. There's this club, it's called the Lime Light, and you were going to it.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nYes.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nRobert was DJing there.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nExactly.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nHe was in the DJ booth.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nTell me what it was like on the dance floor at the Lime Light.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nI'm going to tell you a little story. First time I went to the Lime Light, Sunday night, June 7th, 1976. I remember it because it was the birthday of my friend Jean Barbeau, who is right there. We're going to the Lime Light, at the Lime Light there was three floor. First floor was Le Jardin, on the street. Second floor and third floor, people call or le super Lime Light, or the sky. There was Germain. Germain was the doorman. You had to please Germain to go upstairs. We come, it's Sunday night, so we said to ourselves, we're going to have a chance to go upstairs because it's Sunday night. We talk with Germain, he said, âOK now, you cannot go up there right now, so go for an hour at the second floor and come back.â We go for this hour and we come back and he said, âOK, you can go up.â\n\nWe go up, and I remember, the song that was playing, it was, \"You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine\" by Lou Rawls, and Robert mix it with âLowdownâ from Boz Scaggs. Going to the Lime Light was like going to the sky. It was in the point of view of the person going, the renown was so great, and when you had the chance to go upstairs it was really good. We had the good strategy, because once you went up once, you always go up after that. You go, you say hi to Germain, make a nice smile, and Germain lets you go up, because the guy knew every face. He knew that he let you go up, so you can go up. It was big, 1,200 person can go dance upstairs at that time.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nWhat was the reputation of the Lime Light in the city at that time in 1976? It had been open for a number of years already.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nYeah, the reputation, it's open, I think in '72?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nAround '72.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nYes, so that's it. In '76 I was 19 years old, I start going out to clubs, I start DJing on the youth dance, not dancefloor, but an evening for young people. We used to do some DJing. The Lime Light was really known, you heard of the Lime Light, you can read it in the newspaper, you hear of it on radio, you see it on television because the reputation was that there was two places in the world to go to have a disco night, and it was, or New York, Studio 54, started in '78 I think, but before that there was another club, or MontrÃ©al with the Lime Light. It was the place to be. When you had the chance to go there, you were very, very happy.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nI think the thing that's kind of underrated was that Montreal was one of the biggest cities for disco, right after New York.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nI guess Robert's kind of the reason.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nYes, for sure, because Robert was the first to make some tempo. We used to do some DJing, but the song was finishing and we pick up the other. Robert was the first one to mix on tempo. We go there, we want to listen to it and try to do the same after.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nThat wasn't easy.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nNo, that was not easy, because the disco beat were going like that [makes hand movement], there was no machine.\n\nIt was feeling. When the song, when Thelma Houston start to sing in, she's singing, at the end, she's singing, the band, follow, follow, follow, and the speed goes up, up, up, and you try to mix on it, wooo! Robert, he was the best always, there was never a âfa-flackâ like we said.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nNow that we've set the scene, we've complimented you quite a bit. How do we get here? How do we get to the Lime Light? Can you tell us a little bit about what you were doing in MontrÃ©al before you started working at this club?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nI was going to school from Saint-Jerome.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nWhich is about 45 minutes away from MontrÃ©al?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nIt's around 45 minutes away from MontrÃ©al. I was into music, I was reading Cashbox, there was a woman who had a record store in Saint-Jerome and she kept me all the Cashboxes that I wanted, about two, three weeks after she had finished with it. I was always knowing what was happening with music, I was into rhythm & blues. What I wanted to do is come to MontrÃ©al. I used to hitch-hike to MontrÃ©al to buy 45s at a record store and go back to Saint-Jerome again, by hitch-hiking. That's how I started.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nI guess this is another era, hitch-hiking was a little bit safer back then. We're talking about the late â60s?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nYeah, maybe around â71, â70. Just before I came to live in MontrÃ©al.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nYou started DJing in MontrÃ©al at this club called Love, is it?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nYes, Love on Guy Street.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nWhat was Love like?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nLove was a small club. It was kind of a mini-Lime Light before Lime Light. The same kind of people, the mixture of gay people, straight people. Music was very R&B-oriented, a bit of pop but not too much, but mostly R&B-oriented.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nWere the clubs back then in MontrÃ©al very mixed, or was this something that was quite interesting and new?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nIt was kind of a new thing. It was the beginning of some different.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nI guess, also in MontrÃ©al, you have to think about the English and the French. Was the audience...\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nThat place was more English than French, but the people used to come there, used to go at the beginning of the Lime Light, and that's how they talked to the owner about me.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nCan we talk about, the owner came and saw you play?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nYeah. I think they came, there were some people, he brought some people with him, he had heard about me, and he was in a process, wanted another person to work at his club. He like what he heard, and I started slowly working during weekdays. That's how I started.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nDid you like the club, when you immediately saw, were you like, âThis is home. I can do something here.â\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nI loved the first Lime Light, the first floor was [an] amazing place. It was a big, big floor, with kind of estrade [platform] where people could sit, and a lot of sofas, surrounded by a big sound system. That was amazing.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nYou mentioned it was three floors, right? You were DJing on the first floor?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nI started on the first floor.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nWhen did you make your way up to the top? (laughs)\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nThey opened up, I was there during that time, I was beginning to be the main DJ, the other DJ left or was going to leave. They open up the third floor and I went up after that. The music was from the top to the bottom at the same time.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nHow long were these DJ sets that we're talking about?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nI was working two days a week, from 9 until 6 in the morning. Two days from 9 'til 3.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nIt's 6 AM, actually, for MontrÃ©al, that's an interesting timing, because as far as I know, clubs tend to close at 3, most of them. The Lime Light was ...\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nWe had a special permit so we could stay open 'til 6 in the morning. The booze started to close, the booze was stopping at 3 in the morning, they were opening up the lights everywhere, so they were taking the booze away, and starting selling soft drinks and stuff like that afterwards, until 6 in the morning.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nHow does that work at a club? Do you just stop the music?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nNo, the music was continuing, but there was light everywhere. We would see people everywhere for 15, 20 minutes. After that the light would come down and we would continue the music. It never stopped.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nIt feels like that's a really important 15 minutes to get right, because if everyone can see everyone in the light, after hours...\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nI know, it's a bit freaky for some people to see themselves at that time (laughs) But you know, I think I chose my songs for around that time, to make sure that everybody stay there. The same time, the people who are coming from the other clubs, because that was around that time that the other clubs were emptying. A lot of people were coming in also at the same time, around 3 o'clock.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nTheir second shift.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nThat's it. Another shift of people.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nWhy don't we play a song to kind of get a sense of the club in general. I wanted to play the âChicago Bus Stop.â\n\n(music: Salsoul Orchestra â âChicago Bus Stop (Ooh, I Love It)â / applause)\n\nThat was \"Chicago Bus Stop\" by the Salsoul Orchestra. Lots of strings in that.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nA big reflection of the place. The place was a classy place. The music fit exactly the place and the people. At the same time, when that sound plays a lot of people are kind of line-dancing at the time.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nWhat do you mean line-dancing?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nThey were dancing in line, all together. It was crazy because at the time the floor, the Lime Light was going like this [makes hand movement up and down]. I was in my booth because I was a bit upper, and I would see the heads of people going like this on the floor line dancing. It was crazy.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nCould you only see out at a certain level?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nI could see the entire people inside the place. I was in the back like the way I am right now but just a little bit upper. But I could see everyone coming in.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nTell me about a guy a named Richard Joly. Jolay?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nJoly.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nJoly.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nHe was my light man. Boy. Without... Sorry, emotions, towards him. I wouldn't be where I am right now because he knew exactly what to do and when to do it and we did that without talking. He was there doing his job. He liked everything I was doing. He loved the music. He was completely... He was completing me completely. Without him, I wouldn't be here.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nYou rarely hear someone say that about the light guy in dance music. It's kind of amazing that you had this relationship with him.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nHe was punching in when it was time. I never said anything to him. He was always on beat, on time. I couldn't do nothing. Nothing bad to say about him. He was perfect.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nYou couldn't surprise him, either.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nNo. I mean, sometimes I was hiding what I was playing just to see how he would do, and he was always blowing me away with light. He was one of the first.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nHe was like a VJ with light.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nYeah, for sure. He was one of the first light DJ I ever saw.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nDo you remember the light guy?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nHe's a tough guy too. You couldn't enter my booth without him saying so. I'm telling you.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nHe was the bouncer of the DJ booth.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nHe was.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nYou have to be friends with him to go. I and Jean went very, very often to the DJ booth.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nIt's a hard place to get in.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nIt was hard.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nNot many people entered.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nAt the beginning, it was like a flying saucer. You have to come inâ¦\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nYou have to come in underneath.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nUnderneath. Your face and just \"Hello!\" (laughs) âWhat do you want?â âWell to talk with theâ¦ speak with Robert.â âWellâ¦ OK.â It was nice.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nWhen did you first get in? When did you first get past the lighting guy slash DJ booth bouncer?\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nThings go very fast starting in June â76. At that time, with Jean and Allen, we already had a little group called PAJ Disco Mix. We used to do remixes and we used to go to the Lover's disco club in Laval. Because the Lover's disco club was playing on the radio, one hour on the radio, FM radio, every week. We went there and we speak with the owner and tell to him, \"So we do a remix.\" I said, \"Yes.\" We said, \"Can we do one for you?\" He said, \"OK.\" Letâs doâ¦ there was AndrÃ© Gagnon who just came out with his famous âWowâ song and âSurprise,â there was two songs. He said, \"Can you do me a remix with those two songs?\" So we did it. It started playing every time the show was playing on CKOI FM in MontrÃ©al. They always play the song because we were the only ones who have this version. At the fall Ritchie Family came to the Lover's disco club so they ask us to do a remix. We did a 30 minutes remix of music of themâ¦\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nCan we just go back for a second? You're doing remixes in the â70s. Where does this inspiration come from to do this in the first place?\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nOK. In â74 I bought... Always I've been in music or surrounded by music. I bring Sony 1962 here [points to Sony tape machine]. My father buy it, I was seven years old, and said... five years old, I'm sorry. He said to myself, \"You can play with it.\" We used to have 500 LPs in the beginning of the '60s at my house. I was the younger boy of five children. Let's go rapidly. â74 I buy a new cassette tape, tape cassette deck. Sony. I use to buy 45s. Little 45s. There was instrumental, vocal, or there was part one, part two. I said to myself, \"I'm going to mix them to have the full length of the song.\" That's how it start. In January â75. In one year, we were... Jean joined me and Allen joined me and we were able to... In one year, we were able to do triolets [triplets] with pause of a cassette deck.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nYou were just pausing this cassette deck?\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nYou play the song, you stop where you want it to stop. You redo the LP and when the song you want, the beat you want, comes, boom, boom, boom, boom and boom. And you start. We can do three times in one time. Ta da, da. We were able to do with the pause of a cassette deck mix like, âTa da da.â So it went on and all that... AndrÃ© Gagnon and the Ritchie Family, we were invited at that night because Ritchie Family was there. We sit with Ritchie Family. I was not speaking very well in English but at that time I was not speaking at all. We passed one night, complete night, with Ritchie Family without being able to speak with them. Itâs in the fallâ¦ Right after that, we said, âOK, we have to go to the Lime Light.â Then we have made a couple of other mixes and one Saturday night of maybe October or November, go to the Lime Light at nine oâclock. So Germain says, âWhat are you doing at that time?â âWe want to talk to the DJ.â We went in the booth and speak with Robert and say, \"Hey! Look, those cassettes, we have a remix.\" Robert was playing, I have to say that, âNightcrawlerâ of Salsoul Orchestra when we arrive. I remember all those things. Robert takes the cassette, makes it play right away. Said, \"Oh, the song is a bit weird.\" And he said, \"Why don't you bring it to me on tapes?\" That's when we come back, buy the tape recorder that is right there, the AKAI 4000DS, and started make copy of the cassette, and bring back to him. Just after that, a month after, we're starting splicing. That's how it start. Was very, very fast.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nWhat did you think of Pierre and his two friends, when they come into the DJ booth with this stuff?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nCrazy! But you know, what they brought, to me at the time, was kind of an extendedâ¦ Songs were short sometimes, what they brought me was making them kind of longer. It was fun. People could groove more on those things, that's why I used to like them and play them. I had one, from Denise LaSalle, as soon as I got their mix, I stopped playing the original. I only played their mix instead. It was a lot better for my crowd. The people loved it because that's mostly one of the only places they could hear it, also.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nWhy don't we take a listen to one of these edits, to get a sense of what this was, and I guess the beginnings of the PAJ Disco thing. This is âExpress Yourself.â\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nâFreedom to Express Yourself.â\n\n(music: PAJ 2000 - \"Artistes variÃ©s 1977\" / applause)\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nSo, obviously you were thankful that they would extend songs, make them ready for the dance floor. When you heard that, what did you think?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nThat was a bit harder to play for me. That's for sure.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nI wanted to go back to the Lime Light a little bit. One of the things I was really intrigued by in doing some research about what you were doing is, you were going to New York almost every single week that you were working as a DJ in MontrÃ©al.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nYes, for a few years I used to go there, I'd take a plane on Monday and come back on Wednesday. It was all the promo man; try to get all the advance promo from all the major labels, small labels. I went often to see David Todd from RCA. He always gave me the latest stuff and I used to go Sunshine Sounds, the place for the acetate. There I would get records like a month ahead of release, or maybe two months, or special edits for a song, only available there. I would hit the records stores, and also I was going out. It was fun to go during the week in New York in those days, because the clubs were kind of also packed during the week. I used to go to listen to Tony Smith at the Barefoot Boy and I heard Walter Gibbons a few times too, stuff like that.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nWhat were you getting from them as DJs? Like, Tony and Walter, were you hearing things, and you were thinking, âAh, I can take that back to MontrÃ©al?â\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nWalter Gibbons was a crazy DJ. He was using crossovers and at the Lime Light I had one also, crossover for the highs. I would cut down the bass, the only thing you could hear was, âTshhhâ, all the highs everywhere with the Piezo, the ceiling was filled with Piezo. I was playing, there was a lot of highs in those days compared to subs and bass. I was cutting down and doing mixes only with the highs and since the floor was filled with that, you would hear it all over the place on top of your head, because they were on the ceiling. Walter Gibbons was doing that kind of stuff too. He was playing with crossovers all the time.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nSo you were going to New York, you were grabbing these records, and obviously this is a time before the Internet, so you were one of the only people in MontrÃ©al who had these records?\n\nPierre Ouimet\n\nYeah, what I used to do was as soon as I was getting something rare I did what every good DJ was doing at the time, I was hiding my stuff. (laughs) I was either scratching the top of it or putting something on top of it so nobody would know what I was playing, to keep the music for that place. That's what made the reputation of the Lime Light, it's because when you went there, that's the only thing you're going to hear there, you will not hear anywhere else. It was very important for me.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nThen of course, you had this secret weapon, over here.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nOn top of that I had him also, and PAJ, it was amazing. I had some friends too, who were thinking of me, that were traveling to Europe or bringing me a 45 from France and Germany and stuff like that, and sometimes, like the âSpring Rain,â at the time I played it like a year and a half before Salsoul picked it up. All kinds of stuff like that.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nTell me a little bit more about the club and the context of MontrÃ©al, I mean who was playing there and who would come through the Lime Light back then? Who did you see?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nYou mean, talking about important people?\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nYes. (laughs)\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nSorry, I'm thick. I saw, what's his name, Vincent Price. I saw Rick James. I saw Mr. [inaudible], from Quebec, you know, on a Sunday night with his bouncers. Freddie Mercury and his clique came also.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nYou once brought some people to see Gloria Gaynor?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nYes, I went to a show, I went to see Iggy Pop and on the piano at that time Bowie was kind of performing with him live, was playing piano, and the promo man brought us at the Lime Light after. David Bowie and Iggy Pop to see Gloria Gaynor. Gloria Gaynor didn't know who Iggy Pop was, she was freaking out, she was wondering who he was, but she knew about Bowie, but naturally.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nThere were also some amazing performers. I don't know if we can show a couple of those pictures, there's James Brown.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nJames Brown played there.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nWhat was it like when James Brown was playing at the Lime Light?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nIt was quite good, it was fun to see him in a small space.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nYeah, it's quite small. You can see how low the ceiling is there.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nYeah, the Trammps also played there. Gloria Gaynor, like I said, played there also. Grace Jones.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nYou were good friends with Grace Jones? I mean we have a picture of you.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nYeah, I mean, she used to come once in a while, without performing, only as a regular person. She used to come to MontrÃ©al and...\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nI don't think Grace Jones was ever a regular person.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nNo, I think she was.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nThere was also Kraftwerk came through at some point?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nKraftwerk didn't play, but I met them at a special thing. The promo man for Capitol at the time did something special and I got to meet them also.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nI want to put up a couple pictures of just the club in general, like, I guess, a \"normal night\", can you kind of walk us through some of these pictures and kind of tell us what... Maybe, Pierre, if you see something...\n\n[images on screen]\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nThis is a special...\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nA special event.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nOnce a year we had a white party.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nThis is a picture of one.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nThat was kind of the thing to be, where to be at that time.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nOh my God.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nIt was crazy. We had a guy once having a transparent plastic birdcage on his head and naked underneath, parading in a club.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nIs this a normal night, or is this like the craziest stuff we have on the screen here? Obviously this is the white party.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nPeople used to dressed up, especially at the beginning.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nWhen you go to the Lime Light, you're sure that you see people dressed like you never see on the street at day. It was really... Peopled dressed.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nPeople were very fashionable at the beginning.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nYeah.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nA lot of people dressed up, and they had kind of their special outfit for the weekend.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nThey're not going to wear it on the street, so that you have your clothes just to go to the Lime Light.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nI remember, I spoke to Richard earlier, the light guy, and he said that he would almost focus the light on people as they came in, because that was like the moment they had to show off the thing that they had dressed up as. Is that the case? Was that what he was doing?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nI couldn't say everything he was doing, but I know that his thing was to make sure that everybody was seen and it was very important to those people, because at the same time, they were also the star of the place, not only the music, not only me, the sound system, but the people were also the star of that place.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nThat's very rare for a DJ to say something like that, to put it on the crowd. How important was the crowd to making that place what it was?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nThey were... It was really important for me to have a kind of relationship with them, because they trusted me and I trusted them. It was kind of a nice exchange.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nHow do you feel about that, Pierre?\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nI just can agree. Everything was superlative in that place. We talk about the sound system. The sound system and they change practically every year. My favorite was when the first time I went, in '76, before it was... There was no place, nowhere that you had a kind of sound like that.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nCan we show the sound system picture, actually?\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nOK.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nWhat is the... It's a white speaker system, which I don't think I've seen quite often. I guess it was, how important was the dÃ©cor and the way that the club looked as well?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nI think itâs white because of the light, the reflection and everything, it's easier to make patterns on stuff like that, but that sound system was the best thing we ever had. It was cornered on each four corner. There was no sub in those days. It was bass, a bass, not sub bass but mid-bass, highs, Piezo on top, mid-high, but it was perfect. You could hear everything, without being too loud.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nWhy don't we listen to another track, by an artist from MontrÃ©al. I want to talk about I guess the scene and how producers emerged from this scene. This is Gino Soccio with âDancer.â\n\n(music: MontrÃ©al Sound â âMusicâ / applause)\n\nThat track is called \"Music.\" It's by MontrÃ©al Sound. Tell me a little bit about the context of that song. Was it that song that you were saying is the type of thing that Robert would never play at the Lime Light?\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nYeah.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nWhy is that?\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nBut we stay friends. It was really a catchy song for the radio, and at the Lime Light, what was playing was another thing. I remember Robert, at that time, when âYMCAâ came out, he didn't play it. I don't remember having heard it.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nI played it.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nA couple of times? The songs that were too popular, you were not playing.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nI used to play a popular song that the radio was playing, I usually cut it.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nYou were playing these songs a year before they came out.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nI was ahead of my time with a lot of that stuff, so it was easier to go ahead and play something else, something I didn't have to play.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nWe set up a reel-to-reel here. Why don't you walk us through what we're going to see and what you're going to show us.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nJust maybe to say that âMusicâ was kind of a big hit around the world. We sold half a million copy of \"Music.\"\n\nNow I'm going to try toâ¦ [Robert holds mic] Oui, merci. Merci Robert. Now I'm going to show you how it was working to splice on a tape deck. There is the tape deck, there is a song on it. I'm going to play it just to hear what's on. (music plays) OK. We have heard the song. If you want to make a splice, you have to hear the beat. The way it works... OK, it's there. I'm sorry. It's a long time. 1, 2, 3, 4, 1. There's one. (scratches tape) That's the beat. I'm going to mark it with a crayola. You make a mark, it works. You make a mark. It's supposed to work.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nThis is the reading ahead. The first one is the reading, the second one is the erase.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nReading, erase. Erase is there. There's reading. There's recording and reading.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nSo, you need to be careful of that second one.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nWhen you have the line, let's say I want to do a splice for the next beat. So there's one beat. That's the other beat. Now I'm going to splice it. I put it on the splicing block. This is the splicing block, this little thing. There's two ways to splice. You can splice straight or splice with an angle. When we start splicing everybody was telling us, \"OK, you splice with an angle,\" so we did that, but after that, we started splicing straight, because we find that the mix was more like...\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nSnappy.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nSnappy. There's a blade. I cut it. I take the tape and look for the other mark. Okay, I see it. That's good. Yesterday night, I was looking for the pen and it's more like wax. The other one, we used to call it crayon gras [pastel crayon], so that the mark appeared easier. Then, you have the tape. You cut the tape like this, and then you take the tape and you can go like this, and you place the tape, and scratch it.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nI'm just imagining you doing this 2000 times, right now.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nThere's one thing at that, we were much faster than I am now. We were machines. We used to be machines. Is it going to... OK, doesn't hold very well. OK, so that's... Because I stopped doing splicing in 1997 when I bought Cool Edit Pro. We start doing but, so... Let's play it.\n\n(music plays)\n\nMusically, it doesn't work, because we put a two on a one, but there's a splice. That's how it works. (applause) That wonderful song that you heard was called \"Follow Me\" by Jump In the Pool, I produce this song in 1988.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nWhat happens after the Lime Light for you, Robert? Where did you go? You ended up moving on from disco, basically, and started playing new wave.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nYep.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nI guess this is an evolution, right?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nI needed a change. Everything was started to sound all the same, there was a lot of covers in those days, with violin and stuff like that. I needed to branch out, do something else. What happened is, I heard the B-52's, and I went crazy. I changed, I introduce all that stuff at the same time at the Lime Light. The first time I played the B-52's \"Rock Lobster\" there were 1000 people in the place, maybe more, there were nobody on the dancefloor.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nI remember this one.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nPeople did not understand what I was doing. Two weeks after I did the same thing. 10 people on the dance floor. Within a month, it was packed. That kind of changed everything I was doing at the time. I went into another direction. I started playing new wave.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nWhat about you, Pierre? What happens after the Lime Light for PAJ Disco?\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nFor PAJ Disco Mix? We did that music thing, after that, everybody had a lot of things that we did on hand, and it was okay. When Robert went to New York, he bring our tapes there, there was a couple of Sunshine acetate that has been made from our remix, but we had no manager. At that time, we are not DJing clubs, we just love to do splicing, and I repeat it, without managers, it just like fade away on that particular thing. We continued doing special events, we go to spin on other discotheques, from time to time. Not on a weekly base.\n\nFor Jean and Allen continue his life, Allen in radio, Jean research in sound system speakers. I had the opportunity, in 1981, I met Dick Walsh who was an artist director of a big fashion show. I made all his fashion shows from 1981 'til the last one I did with him was in 2003. I made 30 years, more than 30 years doing soundtracks for fashion shows all around the world. In 1984, for one year, I did a special remix for CKOI, that was the biggest radio station in MontrÃ©al.\n\nI finished the year with an invention that was, I said to the musical director, \"Give me the name of all the number one hits of the year, and I will do a montage with that, a remix with that.\" That was the first that it was made, everybody does it right now, but at that time... 15 minutes and 40 songs in 15 minutes. I bring to them on December 21 and it plays every two hours for two weeks. Since that, every popular station do those kind of remix. That's about it. I'm doing artistic direction, shows and everything. I have made, at least, a couple of hundred thousands of splices in my life, yeah.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nDick Walsh, you mentioned, I guess heâs someone we should bring up. He was doing artistic direction at the Lime Light as well. You can imagine some of the parties we saw in those pictures, he was a little bit of the creative mastermind in some of the ways that they were presented.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nYes. Robert knew him before me, tu le connais?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nYeah, he used to work with [inaudible] at the same time. They were doing a lot of things like the white parties, make-up, all kinds of different things with the people, dressing them up, something like that.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nThen he went on to work with Area in New York and a bunch of other amazing clubs. He's kind of a nightclub legend, Dick Walsh. I wanted to open up to questions. Does anyone have anything that they'd like to ask? Yes?\n\nAudience Member\n\nHello. I have one question for each of you. First, Robert. You were talking earlier about how you were mixing things when it wasn't such a common thing, so I wanted to ask you, how did you learn the technique, how to DJ with the vinyl and the disco tracks?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nIt's practice, practice, practice. That's the only way to get that stuff. The more you work with it, the better you are because you know exactly when to put the pitch up, put the pitch down, exactly, because it's a question of seconds. Those records in those days were starting, maybe 118[BPM], and by the end they were 125. The intro, sometimes, I had only four beats. You had to be quick. You had to know also, when you are mixing longer, at that place the record goes down, so you up it a bit, or you make it down a bit. It's a lot of work. It's something you can only achieve by practice. You cannot come today and bring those records and play them and be able to mix them. You need to work it.\n\nAudience Member\n\nWhat are the tools that you had as a DJ, with the turntables and the mix?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nThat's all I had.\n\nAudience Member\n\nRight, but you could change the pitch, you could do EQing...\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nYou could do the thing with your fingers, with those turntable at that time. Just a bit faster, bit slower.\n\nAudience Member\n\nOK, thanks. Pierre, did you have any reference for the kind of work that you were doing, because I was listening to the 2000 splice thing, I'm listening, I think, Beastie Boys and also like Stockhausen. The only reference that I have for that kind of thing is a bit later, the Patrick Cowley remix of âI Feel Love,â but it's very tame compared to what you were doing. Did you have any reference for that kind of thing, were you looking at European and experimental music, or other people who were doing same kind of thing with disco, or what?\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nOK, that's a big question. First, you have two thirds of the PAJ group just beside you. Those two guys areâ¦ It was together that we made it. I didn't make it alone, we were three guys doing it. At that time, we didn't think of elsewhere. We were not conscious of what's happened everywhere around the world. We didn't know Walter Gibbons. Maybe, but I saw 10%. I read his name, but I didn't know what he was doing. Our search wasâ¦ The thing was that we're not DJs, so we want to do remixes and we were not having the multitrack tape access.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nI think that is very underrated about what you did. You didn't have access to multiple tracks.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nWe didn't have access to nothing! We just had the record! Those guys like Walter Gibbons and Tom Moulton, it was something else, it was more like big eyes on top of what's happening in the studio, but Walter Gibbons make splicing, but it was not his main thing the splicing. It was, he had access to the multitracks, so he did things with multitrack. That force us to be able to do something special, that forced us to be getting musical in our splice. To rewrite music, that's what we want to do is to rewrite music, to add music, like I said before. That was the thing, but we knew that some other people were doing things but we think that one of those would make the most of splicing, because before I came here there was another interview and I made my homework. I went on the web and listened to [inaudible] from Sunshine Sound and things like that of splicing, and that was good thing, but I don't think that those guy were doing that much in that less time. Practicing, practicing, practicing. That's what makes us doing the things we did, I think.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nGot to put those 10,000 hours in.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nYeah.\n\nAudience Member\n\nHello. How are you? It's really a pleasure to hear you guys talk. I grew up in MontrÃ©al and disco's very important to me, so everybodyâ¦ I see some people I recognize, too. Thank you for sharing it. I just had one thing to ask Robert. When I bought Karen Silver's first record, I noticed you're credited as a \"disco consultant\" andâ¦\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nWhat is that?\n\nAudience Member\n\nThat's what I wanted to ask you! What is a disco consultant?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nI did that for many records on Quality Records at the time, and this is like telling them what to do with the record. Most of the time, I was in the studio. A lot of the times I was in the studio with them. The engineer, the producer, John Driscoll. I was telling him what to do, what to put at the beginning, the middle, the end, stuff like that. I was doing at the timeâ¦ I did two remixes in the â70s.\n\nAudience Member\n\nAre there other disco consultants you know of?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nNo. Not a lot. I think that was my title for them.\n\nAudience Member\n\nDo you get royalties at all or anything?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nNo, not really. I got credit, but not royalties.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nOne thing I was curious about. Obviously, you were taking a lot of stuff from New York and those record pools and from your experiences there. Is there anything that you were bringing to New York and giving to them from MontrÃ©al as a disco consultant or otherwise?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nNot really, but the people were eager to get the record played in MontrÃ©al, mostly. That was very important for them, for me to bring their stuff here so I could play it, and a lot of those people in the States were also coming to the Lime Light. Ray Caviano, we signed. Gino, used to come often. D.C. LaRue used to come often also. Roy B. used to come also. There was a lot of people down there who knew what I was doing. The only thing I did at the time is that I did a few remixes. I did work on Gino Soccio âLes Visiteurs,â I did the remix. That's the first 12\" from the album, the first album. I worked also with France and Maggie, Delerium, and [inaudible] from Toronto that Joey Negro released a few years ago.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nYou also, I guess, Steveâ¦ I'm blanking on his last name right now. Steve, you gave him âThe Mexicanâ by Babe Ruth.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nYeah, Steve DâAquisto. That was early. That's before the Lime Light. Steve DâAquisto is the guy who started the record pool with David Mancuso in New York with Vince Aletti. He was replacing me during the week, I was working at Love at that time, and he was doing the weekdays, and he freaked out because I was playing a song called âThe Mexican.â He brought the record to New York and he gave it to David Mancuso and they all freaked out and it became a big hit with that. They talk about it in the book Last Night A DJ Saved My Life. They talk about that.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nI think that record obviously isâ¦\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\n\"The Mexican.\" Babe Ruth.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nSo influential, like in many, many different aspects. Are there any other questions? Someone up in the front row?\n\nAudience Member\n\nHello.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nHello.\n\nAudience Member\n\nDisco is so synonymous with LGBTQ culture and people, and it's such a celebration of being open to everyone. I was wondering if you had any thoughts about the different areas of music that have come about as a result of disco, and perhaps homophobic attitudes that permeate those cultures, or at least if not homophobic attitudes, then a closed-minded lack of celebration. I was wondering if you had any thoughts.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nI know that my crowd was half gay, half straight. I always worked with gay people, all my life, in all the clubs that I worked, and that thing continued with house. House was mostly gay people at the time. I don't see that right now. I don't see any prejudice against that music. I don't see it, really.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nMe neither.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nOne of the things you've always said about the Lime Light is there were no fights. Ever.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nNo, it wasâ¦ The bouncers were doing a great job at that place. Nobody would be harassed by anything, anybody. A gay guy getting harassed by a straight guy, out. The girls, the same thing. Any problem with straight guys with girls, out. It was not tolerated at the time. It was taken care of all the time. That's why the atmosphere was always good in that place. Everybody felt kind of secure. That's important.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nAs a dancer, you never thought that there could happen something bad. It was a place like you're in happiness, it was happiness, happiness. You feel like that, it was likeâ¦\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nIt was a greatâ¦ People getting together all the time, and having fun at the same time at the same high, going higher and higher all the time. They were following me, and I was following them. I was seeing them from the first time they come in, because from where I was sitting, I was playing for them as soon as they coming in, so everybody was pleased, including me.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nIt was like ecstasy before ecstasy. No, but the feeling in the club was like what we saw in the end of the â90s and the beginning of the 2000s, the feeling was there.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nIt's very hard to imagine that you have kind of an energy that's going toward some people, and dancing in front of you, and that energy's coming back the same way. It's like it flows all the time. That's what I remember for those days.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThat's a really amazing tale. I think I was really thinking more about club culture these days, which isâ¦\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nIt's another thing. It's very separated nowadays. What's great about disco, it's because it was kind of from downtempo to uptempo. Latin stuff, African stuff, all things together. Not only one type of dance, like today you go in a club, you're going to hear soulful house, that's all you're going to hear. You go and hear techno, that's all you're going to hear. Disco was all over the spectrum. All kind of beats, all kind of sounds.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nAll kinds of tempos.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nAll kind of tempos. It would please everybody, too, at the same time. We'll please the girls, we'll please the guys, the gay guys. That's why that place worked.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nFront row?\n\nAudience Member\n\nHi, I have two questions. I'm wondering if you have the 2000 splice song recorded on vinyl or CD or whatever, and the second question is, what do you feel about DJs and DJing over the years, up until now?\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nThis week, we just uploaded a lot of PAJ Disco Mix on YouTube, so you go to YouTube and just type \"PAJ Disco Weekâ P-A-G Disco Mix.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nJ, for the Americans in the audience.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nJ! Sorry! P-A-J. \"P-A-J Disco Mix,\" and that's 20. I upload 20 of those remix, and bonus, you see Allen, Jean and me, because we used to do films at that period and itâs on it also. We just a little younger on it.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nOnly a little bit.\n\nPierre Gagnon\n\nI will continue to upload more in the weeks to come, so that there will be a collection of 50 in couple of weeks...\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nTalking about today's music and DJing today?\n\nAudience Member\n\nDJing over the years since you started DJing. From then until now.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nI've been playing for almost 40 years, and I'm still playingâ¦ I've got radio shows, and I still love playing, but today, the experience that I have, I find I'm getting better all the time, even for today. That's my opening for me. I'm not sure about what others think. I think it's still fun to play nowadays. I'm not really a nostalgic person. I don't want to relive the past, but I'm living the present with my experience of the past, and that's what's important. I have a disco show right now, I will rarely play the records the same way they were. There's so many people doing good stuff nowadays with edits, remixes, [inaudible], Tom Moulton does new mixes all the time, I'm in contact with those people.\n\nSo I'm playing new stuff that plays the old stuff, but adapted to today itâs very important for me. I'm always up to date with everything. I also love a bit of techno, I love all kind of stuff, and I have different shows, also. I have a disco show called Atomix, I got a soul show that reflects what's happening in England right now with the soul scene. It's only new stuff. I'm having a show called Different Angle that's all over the spectrum. Rock dance, reggae, funk, soul, and I have one in the States on Crib Radio with Jay Negron and all of that every Saturday, once a month, that I play soulful stuff, disco, the new remixes and stuff like that.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nYou've been DJing for 40 years.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nAlmost.\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nHow do you stay motivated? What keeps you going?\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\nMy main thing is music. That's what gets me going. It's music, all the time. All kind of music. Not only one kind. Let me justâ¦\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nHe has some notes just in case he forgets some dates and things. Please.\n\nRobert Ouimet\n\n[reads] Because of my love of music, being a DJ is simply an extension of that love. That's what being a DJ in music is for me. (applause)\n\nTodd L. Burns\n\nI think that's a great note to end on, actually. Thank you so much, Robert, thank you so much, Pierre."
