        "text": "Gloria Gaynor is best known for being the disco diva who brought us the 1970s mega-hit “I Will Survive.” There’s so much more to her story, though, and the singer is finally ready to tell it all with the upcoming release of Gloria Gaynor: I Will Survive, a new documentary focused on her life and career.\n\nGloria Gaynor: I Will Survive might begin with her signature chart-topping, GRAMMY-winning hit, but it doesn’t end there. Instead, the film takes us through her highs and lows and how she managed to pull herself through to make the title of her hit song a prophecy.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThough the Betsy Schecter-directed film will dredge up some of Gloria’s painful past — including her failed marriage to her controlling manager, dalliances with drugs and grim health scares — that’s not all that we’ll see. The film will also showcase the singer’s career resurgence as a gospel artist, a path that would land her the second GRAMMY of her career for her roots gospel album Testimony.\n\n“I am finally at a place of joy and self-fulfillment, and I am ready to share my secret to not only ‘surviving but thriving’ with the world,” Gaynor said via press release.\n\n- Advertisement -"
