        "text": "Feliciano oftentimes will venture into other artistic genres and has, in fact, become famous for doing so. In 1989, for instance, legendary author, Ray Bradbury, invited him to write the music for his play, “The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit.” José and his wife, Susan, took on the challenge of writing over a dozen songs for the project. It was a delightful experience and the thrill of a lifetime to work alongside one of the literary world’s greatest writers, Mr. Ray Bradbury. The production enjoyed a successful run at the Pasadena Playhouse and was well received by the media and patrons of California’s State Theater.\n\n​\n\nJosé and Susan have been together since 1971. In 1988, they were blessed with a daughter, Melissa Anne; in 1991, with their ﬁrst son, Jonathan José and in 1995, with their third child, Michael Julian. Together they live in a 300 year-old former tavern-turned-homestead on the Saugatuck River in Fairﬁeld County, Connecticut. It’s lively, even noisy at times; the perfect place for an active household which is, in fact, typical of the Feliciano’s.\n\n​\n\nWhen José is at home, his time is spent writing and recording in his studio, enjoying all-things baseball — playing it with the boys, listening to it on the radio and watching it on TV. He enjoys going to the gym and just being a dad.\n\n​\n\nIn the early 90’s, José indulged himself a little by staying closer to home, enjoying his young family and trying his hand at a life-long dream: “...to be on the air!!” The local Westport, Connecticut radio station, WMMM, became the perfect instrument for his desire. Its general manager, Mark Graham, and José had a Saturday morning talk show entitled, “Speaking of Music,” where they would chat, take phone calls, share musical tidbits and trivia, interview musical artists and play an array of music from jazz and blues to the rock ‘n’ roll of the 50’s and early 60’s to pop and more. The community embraced their collaboration and the show continued for well over a year until José’s touring schedule simply couldn’t afford the time it took to broadcast a weekly radio show.\n\n​\n\nOver the years, José has been part of many historic events, sharing the stage with other internationally renowned artists. For instance, José participated in the American Bicentennial celebration at Ft. McHenry and the Lady Liberty Concert in New York along with Frank Sinatra, Elizabeth Taylor, Helen Hayes, Barry Manilow and Mikhail Baryshnikov before Presidents Reagan and Francois Mitterand.\n\n​\n\nJosé co-headlined with Paul Simon and James Taylor at the internationally acclaimed ‘Back To The Ranch Beneﬁt’ on Long Island and performed on the Motown 25 Special where he preceded Michael Jackson’s premier ‘moonwalk.’ He took part in the PBS Television Concert Special entitled, “The Kennedy Center Presents – The Americanos Concert,” the Christmas Tree lighting ceremony in Washington, D.C. and party at the White House.\n\n​\n\nJosé truly recognizes his great fortune in having met some of the world’s most notable artists, writers, scientists, sports ﬁgures, heads-of-state, royal ﬁgures and, among his greatest honors, to have performed for three Popes: Pope John Paul II for the televised presentation, “Christmas at the Vatican,” Pope Benedict XVI before his Papal Mass at Yankee Stadium and for Pope Francis, again for the prestigious “Christmas at the Vatican” event.\n\n​\n\nIn the fall of 1997, José released his most important recording in a number of years, “Señor Bolero,” for it marked a return to his musical roots. Having revolutionized the sound of the bolero earlier in his career, José elevated it to another new standard while again indulging himself in this classic, romantic music for which he’d been long associated.\n\n​\n\nPolyGram, his Label at the time, had designed an elaborate promotional campaign to support this exciting collection of boleros and the public’s response was phenomenal. In the ﬁrst two weeks of its release, it had out-sold the previous Spanish album, which at that time had been out for two years.\n\n​\n\nThe ﬁrst single from “Señor Bolero,” “Me Has Echado Al Olvido,” shot straight to number one in New York and in countries throughout Central and South America. In less than six weeks after the release of “Señor Bolero,” it had earned platinum status in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Shortly thereafter, it was nominated by NARAS for Best Latin Pop Album of the year, marking José’s sixteenth nomination. “Señor Bolero” attained DOUBLE PLATINUM status in The United States, Puerto Rico and Venezuela and GOLD in Mexico, Costa Rica and Argentina.\n\n​\n\nOn the heels of a successful Spanish-language recording career, José Feliciano entered the new Millennium with great impact: Los Premios Globos honored him with the tremendous accolade, the “Artist of the Millennium Award” and he received the “Alma Award for Lifetime Achievement.”\n\n​\n\nThese new honors joined an ever-increasing collection of mementos that line the walls of his recording studio and bring to his visitors a sense of awe. They see ﬁrst-hand, not only the history but the great love shown to him by his admirers from around the world and an industry that has embraced him for over ﬁfty years!\n\n​\n\nIn 2005, another genre was explored, this time, a collection of Mexican Mariachis. In “A Mexico...con Amor” José was able to express his affection for the people and music of Mexico in much the same way he’d illuminated the beauty of the Bolero.\n\n​\n\nWith the orchestral arrangements of veteran, José Hernandez, it proved to be a stunning collection of cherished Mexican standards, presented in a contemporary manner and delighting listeners from Mexico to Melbourne to Miami.\n\n​\n\nAccolades continued to follow and In September 2006, The Hispanic Heritage Foundation, an organization that identiﬁes, inspires, promotes and prepares Latino role models through national leadership, cultural, educational and workforce programs, honored José with their prestigious “Lifetime Achievement Award” at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.\n\n​\n\nHaving joined past recipients including Oscar de la Renta, Celia Cruz and Raul Julia, José was both honored and humbled by the display of affection shown him at the Gala which was aired on both the NBC and Telemundo television networks. Truly, José had become a bi-lingual icon and, as the original Crossover Artist of our time, the world was beginning to recognize it.\n\n​\n\nIn 2008 José was given yet another opportunity to stretch the limits, musically, this time when he explored the typical countryside music of los Dominicanos – The Bachata! The album, part of his now-popular “Señor Series,” was aptly titled, “Señor Bachata!” Leila Cobo from Billboard.com put it so well when she wrote:\n\n​\n\n“It’s always a challenge to take an artist out of his or her established format and plunge him or her into another. So it’s a tribute to José Feliciano’s artistry that he’s able to navigate pop and tropical idioms with ease, and that his foray into Bachata—perhaps the genre most alien to his long recording history—is convincing to the musician and the style…”\n\n​\n\nMaking this an even more exciting and important release for José and the music industry, “Señor Bachata!” was awarded TWO Grammy Awards in 2008: for “Best Contemporary Tropical Album” by LARAS, the Latin Association of Recording Arts and Sciences and “Best Tropical Album” by NARAS, the National Association of Recording Arts and Sciences.\n\n​\n\nWith these two Grammy Awards, José Feliciano became one of but a handful of artists who, for over a forty-year period, is still viable in the recording industry and earning Grammy Awards.\n\n​\n\nIn José’s case, he has remained relevant in both the English and Spanish cultures so consequently, in November 2011, LARAS honored him with their prestigious “Lifetime Achievement Award” in recognition of his life’s work. José is now among an elite group of individuals who have, during their lifetimes, greatly contributed to the entertainment industry.\n\n​\n\nEven with the attention given to his roots in the Spanish culture and his life spent on American soil, José’s music has touched people in all corners of the world. He has a particularly warmhearted affection for Europe: Austria, in particular.\n\n​\n\nJosé recorded what was to become an iconic song, “The Sound of Vienna,” and for many years, passengers on every Austrian Airlines ﬂight arriving in Vienna would be greeted with José’s singing of it. Now it has become the sentimental Anthem of the City of Vienna!\n\n​\n\nAdditionally, José was humbled to have been chosen to represent Austria when he was named Honorary President of the Ronald McDonald Children’s Aid of Austria, ‘Kinderhilfe.’ About it, José said, “The privilege of sharing in the magic of what the Ronald McDonald Children’s Aid of Austria accomplishes for children and their parents is unparalleled and I am thrilled to be associated with it.”\n\n​\n\nAll of these projects and so many more throughout his life have driven José to continue pursuing his life-long ambition to share his music well into what others may refer to as their ‘golden years.’ For Feliciano, this time in his life has become an opportunity to relish his fruits while continuing to pick those which he still aspires towards, as well.\n\n​\n\nIn 2018, “José Feliciano’s Golden Anniversary Year” was designed to celebrate the Fifty Years since Feliciano ﬁrst came on the International Music Scene with his historic acoustic/soul take on “Light My Fire” as well as his controversial rendition of the U.S. National Anthem, both in 1968.\n\n​\n\nThe year was punctuated with visits around the world to places that were most inﬂuential to his long-spanning career, including concerts in both North and South America, Europe, Australia, the Middle East and particularly, in his birthplace, Puerto Rico. Not having visited there in several years José was overwhelmed by the outpouring of affection, admiration and gratitude by his countrymen, culminating with his sold-out concert performance in Bellas Artes.\n\n​\n\nLess than a month later, his world would do another backﬂip when his little girl, his Niña, would be married and become Melissa Anne Feliciano Erickson. Just four days later, the newly-extended Feliciano Family traveled together to Washington D.C. where the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American History had chosen to celebrate Feliciano’s life and artistic contributions by preserving some of the most signiﬁcant and deﬁnable objects associated with his career.\n\n​\n\nAmong the objects donated to the museum, most notably, was the very guitar with which he not only recorded many of his successful boleros in South America, kickstarting his Latin music career in 1966, but also “Light My Fire” which ignited his Anglo music career around the world in 1968.\n\n​\n\nEven more importantly though perhaps, for many it was the instrument with which an artist would ﬁrst publicly reinterpret the “Star-Spangled Banner” that brought the most intrigue. With José having done exactly that before the 5th game the World Series in Detroit, it resulted in the controversy of his lifetime. On June 14th, 2018, Flag Day, in the Smithsonian’s celebrated Flag Hall, in the permanent home of the actual banner, it was spotted still ﬂying over Fort McHenry “at the dawn’s early light” on September 14th, 1814, inspiring Francis Scott Key to pen the words that would later become America’s National Anthem.\n\n​\n\nIn this remarkable Hall, the Naturalization Ceremony commenced with Feliciano offering the key note remarks and then rendering the National Anthem in the same manner he had done ﬁfty years before with the same instrument — for the very last time.\n\n​"
