Read famous works by women\n\nSometimes the smallest gestures have the biggest influence.

Do something kind for a woman in your life\n\nIt's true what they say: When women support women, there's nothing we can't do. 1-800-Flowers.com has an entire line dedicated to , which includes and that can be sent to the special women you know.
