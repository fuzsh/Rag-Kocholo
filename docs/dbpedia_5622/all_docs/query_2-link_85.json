        "text": "Gloria Gaynor was born in Newark, New Jersey in 1949 to a family who were very poor. She came up singing gospel in church and lived in a New Jersey housing project that had one bedroom, was about five hundred square feet, and where her brother slept across two chairs set up in the kitchen! Her life is a story of survival despite enormous adversity, including the death of both of her parents while she was still young, as well as the brutal beating and resulting death of her sister, Irma. She grew up in a musical family and her brothers had a gospel quartet that she was not allowed to be in because she was a girl. She grew up desiring very much to sing, but no one in her family knew it. She was teased for being too skinny as a young child, which led her to overeat for comfort and to get to a size that would make people stop talking about her. However, this resulted in her being considered “overweight” by the time she was twelve, and the ridicule she faced for that was worse. ( Side bar: Just leave women’s bodies the fuck alone, okay? Thank you. I also remember being way too conscious of my weight as a young person, lying about it for the first time I can recall in fourth grade, when being over a hundred pounds became considered “fat” regardless of the difference in the rate at which bodies develop, and having my step-grandfather who was a total creep ask me in sixth grade what my weight was, and being told it was “a lot” for a sixth grader. My weight was completely fucking normal for a sixth grader, okay? He was just a pedophile, and pedophile’s find maturing young people’s bodies to be tragic. Interestingly, I began to overeat as a tween to hide my body from unwanted male attention.)\n\nMusic was always an escape for her–singing along with the radio. (Same! Hard same!) Although, she was singing along with Nat King Cole and Sarah Vaughan (who I unfortunately had to neglect in this series because there wasn’t anything particularly revolutionary about her, though she is still very worth of discussion), while I was singing along with Ace of Base, Mariah Carey, TLC, and Salt N Pepa! A neighbor must have overheard and told a local bandleader about her, and she was invited to sing on stage by him, and soon hit the road with his band. She performed with the Soul Satisfiers throughout the sixties. Her first solo record, which came out in 1965, included “She’ll Be Sorry” on one side and “Let Me Go, Baby” on the other.\n\nBut her first real success didn’t come until she recorded this amazing song, which was originally released on Columbia Records in 1973, and was one of the first big hits of the disco era. I had actually never heard of it until I started researching her for this project, and now I am thoroughly obsessed with it! Can’t stop, won’t stop. That’s how good dance music always is. The first music to make people go: “damn, I just wanna hear this so many times; can we just make it like two to four times as long?” And the answer was–of course we fucking can! It’s just that until that moment, nobody made something so dope and groovy, so we didn’t feel this enormous need to get lost in those grooves for a good while!\n\nAnd indeed, Gloria Gaynor would create the first extended track in 1974 with her cover of “Never Can Say Goodbye,” originally performed by The Jackson 5. It was her first record to crossover into the pop charts, and it charted in four different Billboard categories: dance/disco, r&b, adult contemporary, and The Hot 100. She was also #8 on Cash Box, which charted artists without regard to genre. During this time, she also employed two sisters whose last name was Simon to be her backup singers, and they were called “Simon Said.” One day, while going through family photos together, they pulled out a picture of their brother, a young cop named Linwood Simon, and Gloria Gaynor knew right there and then without ever meeting him that he would become her husband. And he did. He left the police force, much to the betterment of his spiritual record, and became her manager.\n\nBy 1976, Gloria had been crowned the “Queen of Disco” by the International Association of Disc Jockeys. Pressure came down on her to lose weight due to her rising stardom. She was told if she was going to be a star, she needed to look like one, and put on a very dangerous liquid diet that had a lot of consequences for someone who was working very hard and maintaining an intense touring hustle. It did, however, succeed in helping her get people’s attention.\n\nHer previous records were made with an all-white band called City Life. They loved her and were invested in her as an artist, so they became pissed that she began to work on new music with session musicians who had no connection to her. This resulted in a split, after five years of working together. By 1977, however, she was the undisputed “Queen of Disco,” had Linwood Simon managing her and making sure she stopped signing shit without reading it at all, toured relentlessly, and through all of this became happy and confident for the first time–at least, when she was on stage. She released a few albums during this time, but none of them scored hits on the level of her previous ones. Her greatest hit of all was about to arrive, however!\n\nShe experienced a stage disaster in 1978, when a stage stunt gone wrong resulted in her falling backwards over a monitor. She ruptured a disc, woke up paralyzed from the waist down two days later, and needed emergency surgery. She was in the hospital for two months! This challenge renewed her Christian faith, and would lead to an internal struggle with the disco music culture that was beginning to pull her into a life that did not resonate with her.\n\nHer next record had a cover of a song called “Substitute” by this South African “girl band” called Clout on the A side, and a song you may have heard of called “I Will Survive” on the B side. The record was produced by the same team responsible for Peaches and Herb. No one has any idea to this day why “Substitute” was made the A side, and if no one had ever thought to flip it to the B side, she may never have been remembered as strongly as she is now, as Donna Summers was about to eclipse her as “The Queen of Disco;” she is the person most commonly associated with the title now. “I Will Survive” made her a full-fledged star; became an anthem for women, the LGBTQ community, and survivors everywhere; and went platinum, making her very wealthy for the first time. She has stated she believes she was able to sing the song so well even though she didn’t write it due to losing so many of her family members and having just narrowly escaped being paralyzed for the rest of her life.\n\nDespite her fame, she still was plagued by self-esteem issues. She started to use cocaine to fit in with the disco crowd and to keep up with her rigorous schedule, but the drug made her feel distant from herself and worsened her self-esteem. As a result, she distanced herself from the dance music scene, became born again as a Christian, and stopped smoking and drinking champagne. Her husband and manager continued on with the party lifestyle, and it became a serious divide between them. It was very challenging for Gloria, because her faith was finally giving her some inner peace and self-esteem, but it was resulting in her condemning her husband and forced a separation between the two of them by 1988.\n\nGloria wanted to make strictly gospel records now. But, as ever, the money really wasn’t in gospel music, and her husband had sacrificed his pig pension and sacrificed his own career to support hers. They decided to receive counseling from the pastor of her church. They remained married for a good long while after that, and their relationship was the strongest it ever was.\n\nThere was a disco resurgence in the early nineties, but Gloria’s ability to really participate in it was ended abruptly by her sister being brutally beaten trying to stop a man from assaulting one of her friends in her neighborhood. She was beaten badly enough to be in a coma, and died shortly thereafter. The family spent a lot of time grieving and trying to make sure the young man who killed her was located.\n\nSince then, she has mostly dedicated herself to performing with her church, but she still performs her disco material on occasion, and made some new dance records while living in France in the late nineties into the early part of this century. She also wrote an autobiography titled I Will Survive and became a model for Ashley Stewart, a fashion chain for larger women. In 2016, “I Will Survive” was preserved in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being “culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant” and/or “reflecting or informing life in the United States.” Gloria is still with us and we should be very grateful! Thank you, Gloria!"
