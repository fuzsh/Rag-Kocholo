        "text": "( ENSPIRE Entertainment ) Gloria Gaynor’s Journey of Faith, Hope, and a Magnificent Second Act\n\nIn celebration of what has come to be known as “Galentine’s Day,” Fathom Events proudly presents “Gloria Gaynor: I Will Survive,” a story about the extraordinary life of two-time Grammy-winning artist and global legend Gloria Gaynor. In theaters nationwide for a one-night special event this Galentine’s Day, February 13, the film explores the challenges and triumphs that shaped Gaynor’s illustrious career. The film is also perfectly timed to celebrate Gaynor’s contributions to music in honor of Black History Month.\n\nGloria Gaynor, a music icon and disco legend, inspired millions for decades with her words “I will survive.” But she only truly understood the profound meaning of her lyrics when she hit rock bottom at the age of 65. Facing a devastating divorce from her husband and manager of 25 years, financial ruin, and spiraling health concerns, Gaynor sought to not only survive but thrive.\n\nWith unwavering faith and the spark of new dreams, the film follows Gaynor as she embarks on an unexpectedly difficult 8-year journey to write and record a gospel album, rising up after her downfall. Going behind the mic, we discover a tale of the remarkable challenges that fueled Gaynor’s music and path to stardom, and her present-day message empowering audiences to believe it’s never too late to transform dreams into reality. “Gloria Gaynor: I Will Survive” celebrates reinvention, the power of faith, and a magnificent second act.\n\n“I am finally at a place of joy and self-fulfillment, and I am ready to share my secret to not only ‘surviving but thriving’ with the world,” said Gloria Gaynor.\n\nBeyond her iconic anthem, “I Will Survive,” Gaynor had always envisioned recording and releasing a gospel album. After 19 studio albums, her first gospel album, “Testimony,” was released in 2019. It won the Grammy Award for Best Roots Gospel Album in early 2020 at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards. Not one to rest on her laurels, Gloria is currently working on co-writes with several Grammy-winning songwriters in Nashville who have penned hit songs for Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus, Meghan Trainor, Dolly Parton, Maroon 5, and more. The new music will be released later in 2024.\n\nFathom Events, known for bringing exclusive and unique cinematic experiences to audiences nationwide, will host the theatrical release of “Gloria Gaynor: I Will Survive” on February 13, 2024. This one-night special event allows one to witness the untold story of a musical icon on the big screen.\n\n“Gloria Gaynor is a music legend, but very few know her true story, which deserves to be told,” said Ray Nutt, CEO of Fathom Events. “In partnering with Gloria, we’ll be able to bring that story to theaters this February, letting fans see the story behind the woman whose personal journey fueled her powerful voice and legacy.”\n\nJoin us on February 13th as we celebrate the life, resilience, and enduring legacy of Gloria Gaynor in this extraordinary documentary. Audiences will enjoy never-before-seen Super 8 footage, capturing the beginning of Disco, and join Gloria in the studio with artists like MercyMe’s Bart Millard, Jason Crabb, Mike Farris, and Yolanda Adams. “Gloria Gaynor: I Will Survive” is an emotional journey that inspires and uplifts audiences.\n\n“Having filmed Ms. Gaynor for eight years, I saw first-hand how she proves faith and resilience can turn your life around,” said director Betsy Schechter. “Through divorce, a career resurgence, completing a college degree, and battling the odds to make a Grammy Award-winning Gospel album in her 70’s, Gloria’s story today inspires people to know that despite all of life’s challenges, it is never too late to transform your dreams into reality.”\n\nFor more information about the nationwide release and to purchase tickets, visit this LINK."
