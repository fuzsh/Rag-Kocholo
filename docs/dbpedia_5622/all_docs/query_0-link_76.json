        "text": "The Rainbow Is a Prism: The Many Facets of LGBTQ+ Pop Music History\n\nBy Jes Skolnik\n\nLGBTQ+ people have always been at pop‚Äôs vanguard, as performers and audiences; the history of pop music is queer history. Blues originators like Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith, both openly bisexual, helped form the foundation of what would become R&B and rock‚Äòn‚Äôroll. In the 1920s and early ‚Äô30s, Prohibition‚Äôs end gave way to the ‚ÄúPansy Craze‚Äù: cabaret drag performances that brought gay nightlife to the masses and carried their aesthetics into mainstream musical theater. In the mid-‚Äô30s, at the edge of the Great Depression, moral backlash‚Äîsometimes disguised as economic conservatism but usually explicit in its bigotry‚Äîshut down many of these clubs and formally criminalized gay sex at a scale that had never before been seen. The closet door, which hadn‚Äôt even existed as we know it now, slammed shut.\n\nThis didn‚Äôt stop LGBTQ+ musicians from shaping American pop culture. Jazz can‚Äôt be imagined without the contributions of giants like Billy Strayhorn (of Duke Ellington‚Äôs band), who was openly gay, and, later, Cecil Taylor, who found that three-letter word was too limiting. Even in the prescriptive world of ‚Äô60s pop, where teen rebellion was anticipated and pre-packaged, there were artists like Lesley Gore and Dusty Springfield. In fact, Springfield was one of the first pop icons to come out to the public (as bisexual, in 1970)‚Äîand, notably, she covered Gore‚Äôs ‚ÄúYou Don‚Äôt Own Me,‚Äù as subversive a song as there ever was, on her debut album. The ‚Äô70s brought glam and disco, gender play, and explicitly queer nightlife back to the mainstream; we can‚Äôt forget that decade‚Äôs great gay pop icon, Elton John, and its great bisexual ones, David Bowie and Freddie Mercury. Despite its great appeal to many a very hetero man, many of punk‚Äôs early groundbreakers were LGBTQ+, from Pete Shelley of the Buzzcocks, who was never shy about his sexuality, to Darby Crash of the Germs, who was sadly closeted during his short life. Undergirded by punk‚Äôs jagged energy and the electric, over-the-top styles of glam and disco, new wave made space for unconventional queer personalities and for pop to address the AIDS crisis. And so it has evolved, with the late ‚Äô80s and early ‚Äô90s giving a particular showcase to lesbian and bisexual women in pop (Meshell Ndegeocello, Melissa Etheridge, k.d. lang, the Indigo Girls), all the way to today, a moment that young pop star Hayley Kiyoko teasingly refers to as ‚Äú#20gayteen.‚Äù\n\nThis Pride month, Pitchfork editors and contributors have assembled a list of 50 songs from the past 50 years, post-Stonewall riots, that speak to the impact of LGBTQ+ culture and perspectives on the mainstream. Most of the songs here are by LGBTQ+ artists, with a few exceptions we included because they were too notable not to; most of our critics who wrote these entries are LGBTQ+, as well. But this is not in any way meant to be a definitive list; the field is just too wide to narrow to 50 songs.\n\nInstead, we‚Äôre trying to tell as many stories within this community as we can. Some of the ones I would have loved to tell, personally, didn‚Äôt make it‚Äîlike Gary Floyd of the Dicks, whom I‚Äôve written about before for Pitchfork, or the endlessly talented Dee Palmer of Jethro Tull, who, like me, is trans and intersex. We‚Äôve tried to get as big a range as possible, though, from classic chart-toppers to genre notables from hip-hop, punk, house, and so on‚Äîand we‚Äôve also gotten some wonderful musicians to reflect on their personal soundtracks, too.\n\nPride month itself has a number of meanings and uses: a party, a chance to reflect on our history and think about the challenges we have in the present and going forward, a reason to connect with others and think about how all of us view community, a fierce legacy of radicalism and liberatory praxis. There are millions of different ways to be LGBTQ+, after all. I hope you find something meaningful in this list‚Äîa history you might not have known, a song you loved that you‚Äôd forgotten about, a new favorite‚Äîand that you‚Äôre able to tap into the powerful well of emotions that pop can engender in us and let that push you on. Let‚Äôs get free.\n\nJes Skolnik is a writer, editor, and musician who splits their time between Chicago and New York. Their first gay kiss was in junior high, with someone wearing a matching flannel, while listening to Peter Murphy‚Äôs ‚ÄúDeep‚Äù on shared Sport Walkman headphones.\n\nListen to selections from this list on our Spotify playlist and Apple Music playlist.\n\nRoberta Flack: ‚ÄúBallad of the Sad Young Men‚Äù (1969)\n\nFor decades, gay bars offered their male patrons one of few safe havens. But ‚ÄúBallad of the Sad Young Men‚Äù looks below that comforting surface to offer a view of the scene that‚Äôs both poignant and pained. The song wasn‚Äôt written with an exclusively gay audience in mind‚Äîthough the straight woman who wrote its lyrics, the beat poet Fran Landesman, surely knew of that world, and her words have resonated deeply with many gay people. With music by Tommy Wolf, the song was popularized by Anita O‚ÄôDay in 1962, and found its most knowing interpretation in the 1981 version by the openly gay jazz singer Mark Murphy.\n\nStill, Roberta Flack offers the meatiest reading on her 1969 debut album, First Take. Proceeding through the arcs of its melody with granular attention, Flack finds weight in every word. And brilliant and brutal words they are: In Flack‚Äôs elegant reading, we linger over seven minutes with all the sad young men who pass their time ‚Äúdrinking up the night‚Äù and ‚Äúmissing all the stars,‚Äù as a ‚Äúgrimy moon‚Äù watches them grow old. Flack‚Äôs version culminates in a crescendo of Streisandian power, idealizing a gay bar ode that pierces the heart. ‚ÄìJim Farber\n\nListen: Roberta Flack, ‚ÄúBallad of the Sad Young Men‚Äù\n\nThe Kinks: ‚ÄúLola‚Äù (1970)\n\nInitially among the most popular and influential British Invasion bands, the Kinks were refused work permits for four years by the American Federation of Musicians in 1965‚Äîwhich meant no U.S. tours and, after 1966‚Äôs ‚ÄúSunny Afternoon,‚Äù no U.S. hits. Most groups would‚Äôve pursued a comeback by writing about something universally accessible. True to contrarian form, leader Ray Davies gambled on what was then utterly forbidden love, and saved the Kinks‚Äô careers.\n\nDeftly leading listeners along a gradual path of discovery, Davies sings from the perspective of a rube who finds himself falling for a trans woman who affirms his masculinity and helps him accept himself. Smarter still is the arrangement, an earthy roots-rock sing-along that accentuates the naturalness of what had only recently been decriminalized in the UK, and would still be illegal for decades in much of the U.S. While pioneering films of the era like The Killing of Sister George reflected the difficulty of British LGBTQ+ life, ‚ÄúLola‚Äù emphasizes its joys. That positivity marks it as the crucial awakening song of a new era: the first post-Stonewall smash. ‚ÄìBarry Walters\n\nListen: The Kinks, ‚ÄúLola‚Äù\n\nWendy Carlos: ‚ÄúMarch From a Clockwork Orange‚Äù (1971)\n\nWith the release of her hugely successful album Switched-On Bach, Wendy Carlos demonstrated that Moog synthesizers could be as expressive as a piano. Then, while reading Anthony Burgess‚Äô novel A Clockwork Orange, teenage protagonist Alex DeLarge‚Äôs passion for ‚Äúa bit of the old Ludwig Van‚Äù inspired her to begin composing music based on Beethoven‚Äôs Ninth Symphony, Fourth Movement. ‚ÄúMarch From a Clockwork Orange,‚Äù which appears in Stanley Kubrick‚Äôs infamous film adaptation, is a synthesized choral symphony in which a single voice is transformed by vocoder into an eerily rapturous electronic chorus of ‚ÄúOde to Joy.‚Äù A groundbreaking moment in the history of synthesized sound, the song is a classical symphony cracked open to reveal technological machinery, a marvel as queer as the titular clockwork orange.\n\nIn the late ‚Äô70s, Carlos changed her professional name and image in reflection of who she was; the media handled this badly, causing her to shy away from identifiers, but she became an inspiring figure to many queer people. Now her legacy continues on her own terms; her pioneering work remains an inspiration to the many women working in electronic music to this day. ‚ÄìLorena Cupcake\n\nListen: Wendy Carlos, ‚ÄúMarch From a Clockwork Orange‚Äù\n\nLabi Siffre: ‚ÄúIt Must Be Love‚Äù (1971)\n\n‚ÄúIt Must Be Love‚Äù is pure sweetness, a lovely pop gem about that rush of emotion in a young relationship. It manages, with its plangent chords, to feel real instead of syrupy‚Äîafter all, a new love feels amazing, but its power can also be so intense as to be frightening. The original was a hit in the UK, and its writer and performer, Labi Siffre‚Äîa jazz guitarist, singer-songwriter, and poet‚Äîwas a rarity in the 1970s pop pantheon, an out gay man born to a Nigerian father and a Barbadian-Belgian mother who refused to tamp down his advocacy against apartheid at a time when that was a severely unpopular view to have.\n\nThough Siffre is not actively recording these days, many of his ‚Äô70s and ‚Äô80s hits have been covered or sampled by a wide variety of artists, from Olivia Newton-John to Kenny Rogers to Kanye West. (The two-tone ska band Madness even covered ‚ÄúIt Must Be Love,‚Äù scoring a hit both in the UK and the U.S.) Siffre continues to meditate on art, power, and politics in poetry and essays, still vitalized decades on. ‚ÄìJes Skolnik\n\nListen: Labi Siffre, ‚ÄúIt Must Be Love‚Äù\n\nFanny: ‚ÄúCharity Ball‚Äù (1971)\n\nInitially billed as a ‚Äúnovelty act‚Äù‚Äîhow else, cynically, would one market an ‚Äúall-girl‚Äù band in the early ‚Äô70s?‚ÄîFanny proved to the doubters that they were (surprise!) a damn fine hard rock band with enough harmonies and hooks for pop chart appeal. (David Bowie was an enormous fan, as are Amy Ray from Indigo Girls, Bonnie Raitt, and Jill Sobule.) Led by the Filipina-American sisters June and Jean Millington, the group scored an early hit single with ‚ÄúCharity Ball,‚Äù from their second album of same name, a party-ready boogie-rocker with a swinging backbeat and a blistering guitar solo. It would still make for a perfect, swaggering drag king lip sync performance. Though three out of four members were lesbian or bi, Fanny wanted to be categorized as a lesbian or feminist band about as much as they wanted to be seen as novelties; what they wanted was to just play, to be given the same space and gravity as any of their ‚Äúall-boy‚Äù counterparts. ‚ÄìJes Skolnik\n\nListen: Fanny, ‚ÄúCharity Ball‚Äù\n\nListen: Madeline Davis, ‚ÄúStonewall Nation‚Äù\n\nDavid Bowie: ‚ÄúStarman‚Äù (1972)\n\nIt really is impossible to exaggerate the importance of ‚ÄúStarman‚Äù to a generation of young, sexually-questioning British kids. When Bowie draped an arm around Mick Ronson in the summer of 1972, on the hugely popular music show ‚ÄúTop of the Pops,‚Äù a nation was outraged. But the indignation of parents would only help endear the otherworldly Bowie to their children. For the generation that would spawn the out-gay pop stars of the 1980s, Bowie‚Äôs outrageous campery and sexual androgyny was a revelation, and for many watching that Thursday evening, life would never be the same again.\n\nNow, almost half a century after it happened, David Bowie‚Äôs admission in the British music press that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gay, and always have been‚Äù seems like no big deal. And after Bowie himself retracted his statement, first becoming bisexual and then resolutely straight, it has been seen by supporters and critics alike as nothing more than an aberration. But for some‚Äîthe style-makers, the trendsetters, the icons of the ‚Äô80s and ‚Äô90s‚ÄîBowie‚Äôs fauxmosexuality opened up a whole new world, and his performance of ‚ÄúStarman‚Äù was a pivotal moment in the lives of a whole generation of British musicians. ‚ÄìDarryl Bullock\n\nListen: David Bowie, ‚ÄúStarman‚Äù\n\nLou Reed: ‚ÄúWalk on the Wild Side‚Äù (1972)\n\nOn his most indelible song, Lou Reed narrates New York‚Äôs 1970s queer scene with the cool eye of a documentarian. The former Velvet Underground frontman had worked with Andy Warhol in the late ‚Äô60s, and ‚ÄúWalk on the Wild Side‚Äù names several of the gay men and trans women who ran in the art icon‚Äôs inner circle. Actresses Holly Woodlawn, Candy Darling, and Jackie Curtis all appear in Reed‚Äôs archly delivered lyrics, having flocked to New York as the one place where they could embrace their femininity openly and be lauded for it.\n\nProduced by David Bowie and Mick Ronson, ‚ÄúWalk on the Wild Side‚Äù plays like glam rock with its engine cut out, dropping the bombast for an easier, more casual feel. It‚Äôs as if Reed didn‚Äôt feel that his ‚Äúwild side‚Äù was so wild after all‚Äîto straight people, maybe, but not to him. He‚Äôd already incubated in the city‚Äôs queer underbelly, and he had enough affection for it to memorialize the era. Reed‚Äôs runaway hit was among the first pop tracks to celebrate trans women by name in the Billboard Hot 100, but he never sang it like he was making history. He just called it the way he saw it.\n\n‚ÄìSasha Geffen\n\nListen: Lou Reed, ‚ÄúWalk on the Wild Side‚Äù\n\nJobriath: ‚ÄúI‚Äômaman‚Äù (1973)\n\nWhile Bowie was touting his fauxmosexuality in the press, actor and musician Bruce Wayne Campbell was reinventing himself as Jobriath Boone, the space cowboy who was going to out-Ziggy our David and show the world what the ‚Äútrue fairy of rock‚Äù could do. Sadly, no one took him seriously, and although today Jobriath is recognized as an influence by Morrissey, XTC‚Äôs Andy Partridge, and many others, his importance‚Äîas the first out-gay rock singer to sign to a major label‚Äîis largely overlooked.\n\nThe swaggering pomposity of ‚ÄúI‚Äômaman,‚Äù a single from Jobriath‚Äôs eponymous debut album, is a fantastic example of his talents. It‚Äôs a slice of theatrically high-camp glam rock, in which he makes a pitch for acceptance while looking and sounding like an alien being, something that all LGBTQ+ people can relate to. Yet the press hated him, seeing him as little more than a Bowie clone, and before long, he was headed down the road to self-destruction. But watch his appearance on the late-night TV show ‚ÄúMidnight Special‚Äù (where he is introduced by a clearly confused Gladys Knight), and then compare it to Bowie‚Äôs later performances with Klaus Nomi. Who was leading whom?\n\n‚ÄìDarryl Bullock\n\nListen: Jobriath, ‚ÄúI‚Äômaman‚Äù\n\nDonna Summer: ‚ÄúI Feel Love‚Äù (1977)\n\nThe first time Nicky Siano played ‚ÄúI Feel Love‚Äù at the Gallery, New York‚Äôs most important disco club and queer-friendly space, the crowd ‚Äúexploded.‚Äù Ever since, the song‚Äôs legacy has had less to do with its creators and everything to do with the people who were dancing that night‚Äîand every other joyous dancefloor filled with brown, black, and queer bodies after.\n\nIn 1977, Donna Summer and producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte were not the likeliest of LGBTQ+ allies, or even aware they‚Äôd kicked off a revolution. While the sleek disco Summer made with Moroder and Bellotte resonated with queer audiences‚Äîtheir self-possessed, proudly erotic songs just jived with the sexual revolution and the flowering of the gay public imagination‚Äînone of them were clubgoers. They weren‚Äôt there to see the bodies that writhed to ‚ÄúI Feel Love,‚Äù to its Moog-powered melody and cyborgian drumming. But queer crowds immediately knew it was special: It‚Äôs a song about loving your body and your desires, a powerful sentiment for people whose urges were once seen as deviant. Four decades later, that power over crowds is undiluted, as is the freedom and recognition in its every beat. ‚ÄìKevin Lozano\n\nListen: Donna Summer, ‚ÄúI Feel Love‚Äù\n\nGloria Gaynor: ‚ÄúI Will Survive‚Äù (1978)\n\n‚ÄúI Will Survive‚Äù probably would‚Äôve become a gay anthem even without the specter of AIDS. It has an undeniable flair for the dramatic: After moving through that filigreed piano intro, you can imagine a lone spotlight shining on Gloria Gaynor as she drags the man dumb enough to break her heart and crawl back for more. It was released as disco‚Äôs wave was beginning to break, topping the Billboard charts a few months before the infamous Disco Demolition Night at Comiskey Park. Had the story ended there, it‚Äôd represent the last, best gasp of a culture beaten into temporary irrelevance by thinly-veiled racism and homophobia. (The out lesbian diva Alicia Bridges‚Äô ‚ÄúI Love the Nightlife‚Äù stands out as another hit from this time.)\n\nA few years later, when a generation of queer people was ravaged by a disease dismissed as ‚Äúthe gay plague,‚Äù ‚ÄúI Will Survive‚Äù made for the perfect rallying cry. It burns with righteous indignation and celebrates resilience, qualities well-suited to a community that scrapped for recognition and banded together even as it was condemned and ignored as a matter of policy. (You can imagine the marginalized asking the same rhetorical questions Gaynor poses in the pre-chorus: ‚ÄúDid you think I‚Äôd crumble? Did you think I‚Äôd lay down and die?‚Äù) Even after decades of progress, many LGBTQ+ people are still made to grapple with daily assaults on their personhood. ‚ÄúI Will Survive‚Äù remains there for them, ready to galvanize in moments when asserting your basic humanity feels like an act of defiance. ‚ÄìJamieson Cox\n\nListen: Gloria Gaynor, ‚ÄúI Will Survive‚Äù\n\nSylvester: ‚ÄúYou Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)‚Äù (1978)\n\nIt‚Äôs still stunning, the sheer radicalness of Sylvester: an out-and-loud, gospel-singing, gender-nonconforming queen among queens who not only revolutionized disco in the late ‚Äô70s, but affirmed her identity so intensely that few people dared question it. This track from her second album, Step II, was originally written as a gospel song for the piano; it was then remixed and produced into perfection by Patrick Cowley, another disco pioneer lost to AIDS. His version married Sylvester‚Äôs take-you-to-church vocals with the synthesizer, then still considered a revolutionary instrument. Packed skyward with handclaps, tambourine shakes, and lazer synths, not only is ‚ÄúYou Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)‚Äù a stone-cold classic of the disco era, it‚Äôs a revelation of queer desire. When Sylvester sings, ‚ÄúI feel real when you want me‚Äù to her dancefloor paramour, it‚Äôs not just a simple admission of want. The song is about singing the praises of someone‚Äîwhoever, whatever they happen to be‚Äîwho make us feel good, seen, validated, and alive. ‚ÄìT. Cole Rachel\n\nListen: Sylvester, ‚ÄúYou Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)‚Äù\n\nQueen: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Stop Me Now‚Äù (1978)\n\nThis shamelessly jaunty, piano-pumping karaoke killer wasn‚Äôt a big hit at first, by Queen standards. It hails from Queen‚Äôs also moderately popular Jazz, which inspired Rolling Stone‚Äôs most suspiciously scathing review ever. (Sample dis: ‚ÄúIndeed, Queen may be the first truly fascist rock band.‚Äù) The song‚Äôs wan initial reception may have had something to do with the genders of its love interests, which flip from male to female and back again to assert that frontman Freddie Mercury was bisexual‚Äîand it was released just days before the gay visionary Harvey Milk was assassinated.\n\nBut like Elton John‚Äôs originally neglected ‚ÄúTiny Dancer,‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Stop Me Now‚Äù is today considered quintessential. It‚Äôs the giddy, fun-loving flipside to the forcefulness of ‚ÄúWe Are the Champions,‚Äù and though it similarly acknowledges outside resistance, it does so with a flick of the wrist from a shy guy still hiding behind the sybarite self he strutted onstage so legendarily. In the early ‚Äô80s, Mercury indulged that pleasure-seeker, and he prematurely and cruelly met his mortality. But this song, with its poignant and high-Fahrenheit fantasy of enjoyment without end, will live forever. ‚ÄìBarry Walters\n\nListen: Queen, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Stop Me Now‚Äù\n\nVillage People: ‚ÄúGo West‚Äù (1979)\n\nMost music fans would be forgiven for dismissing the Village People as a disco novelty act‚Äîand they wouldn‚Äôt be completely wrong. After all, their relentlessly gaudy ‚ÄúYMCA‚Äù remains inescapable to this day, providing manufactured glee at everything from bar mitzvahs to baseball games. In hindsight, however, it‚Äôs amazing that such an openly, flamboyantly gay act was able to reach popularity at all in the late ‚Äô70s, let alone earn household-name status within months of their formation.\n\n‚ÄúGo West,‚Äù the title track of the Village People‚Äôs fourth studio album, stands alone among the band‚Äôs most famous songs: It‚Äôs a passionate, lustful ode to queer community and spirit. Released a few years after the staunch conservative Anita Bryant launched her despicable ‚ÄúSave Our Children‚Äù campaign, which became the blueprint for the next 30 years of anti-LGBTQ+ politics, ‚ÄúGo West‚Äù imagined a utopia free of homophobia and discrimination. The rousing choral chants of ‚ÄúTogether!‚Äù‚Äîblasting over joyous horns and hi-hats‚Äîdon‚Äôt just describe a man and his lover, but all queer folk yearning to find their tribe and flourish in the sun. ‚ÄìCameron Cook\n\nListen: Village People, ‚ÄúGo West‚Äù\n\nLoose Joints: ‚ÄúIs It All Over My Face (Female Vocal)‚Äù (1980)\n\nThe gay, avant-garde musical prodigy Arthur Russell, working with DJ Steve D‚ÄôAcquisto, hustled up money in 1979 from the disco label West End Records for an experimental studio project. Hoping to capture the propulsive energy of their favorite New York hotspot, the Loft, Russell and D‚ÄôAcquisto invited musicians and singers into the studio and subjected them to Buddhist-influenced improv and DIY recording practices. Thus, Loose Joints were born.\n\nDJ genius Larry Levan kidnapped the master tapes, taking it upon himself to remix the record with his connoisseur nightclub crowd at the Paradise Garage in mind. Levan‚Äôs reworking of the track is a masterpiece of throbbing, risqu√©, suspenseful funk‚Äîan off-kilter confluence of electric keys, propulsive bass, sinewy drumming by Philadelphia‚Äôs John Ingram, and a blas√©, haughty Melvina Woods vocal (‚ÄúIs it all over my face?/You got me love dancing‚Äù). No song better captures the vibey, druggy, slightly dissociated erotics of downtown New York in its post-disco thrall. To this day, Russell, D‚ÄôAcquisto and Levan‚Äôs mutant baby remains a staple of black and Latino gay ballroom scenes. In fact, a limber dancer with loose joints is probably fiercely voguing to ‚ÄúIs It All Over My Face‚Äù as you read this. ‚ÄìJason King\n\nDiana Ross: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Coming Out‚Äù (1980)\n\nDisco appealed to pretty much everybody except the straight white dudes who ran the music industry; they got tired of gay/black/Latino club DJs calling the shots, just as disco‚Äôs reigning band Chic morphed into an equally fierce songwriting, production, and instrumental team. One night, their leader Nile Rodgers spotted three Diana Ross‚Äìimpersonating drag queens at GG‚Äôs Barnum Room, a Manhattan disco where transgender acrobats on trapezes flew over the dance floor. He had the ingenious idea to have Miss Ross herself sing a roof-raising LGBTQ+ anthem as a thank-you to all those queens for supporting her (and Chic, too).\n\nThis meant Rodgers‚Äîa revolutionary in designer duds‚Äîwas never upfront about the fact that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Coming Out‚Äù was obviously about sexuality. Indeed, it‚Äôs also about being your truest self and throwing aside shame‚Äôs shackles. Ross rose to the occasion, turning in a triumphant performance as exacting as Chic‚Äôs sashaying accompaniment. But Motown hated the album, demanded the tapes, remixed them to downplay Chic‚Äôs instrumentation, and released diana in 1980 without so much as a single for the first month. Rodgers and collaborator Bernard Edwards nearly disowned what they‚Äôd originally considered their crowning achievement. Then ‚ÄúUpside Down‚Äù went No. 1, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Coming Out‚Äù hit No. 5, and *diana‚Äî*ultimately her biggest solo album ever‚Äîsold nine million internationally. Disco wasn‚Äôt dead yet; queers still had clout. ‚ÄìBarry Walters\n\nListen: Diana Ross, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Coming Out‚Äù\n\nSoft Cell: ‚ÄúTainted Love‚Äù (1981)\n\nWhen Ed Cobb wrote ‚ÄúTainted Love‚Äù in 1964, he never could have imagined its grim repurposing two decades later. In the ‚Äô80s, the song came to represent the fear and dread that gripped the gay community at the very start of the AIDS crisis. The soul singer Gloria Jones first recorded a manic version of the song in 1965, and in the early ‚Äô70s, it became a favorite of the U.K.‚Äôs Northern Soul scene. Then Soft Cell‚Äôs Marc Almond changed the piece radically in 1981 by taking a much slowed-down and sleazed-up approach, and it became an unlikely smash in the U.S.\n\nAt that time, AIDS had not yet been given that name, though gay men knew all too well of a mysterious new ‚Äúcancer‚Äù ravaging the community. The key lines in the song, ‚ÄúOnce I ran to you/Now I‚Äôll run from you,‚Äù were the first to capture the new terror surrounding sex and connection. At the same time, Soft Cell‚Äôs shadowy version embraced the darkness, capturing the complex amalgam of pitched attraction and deep angst that marked earlier eras of gay life. In 1985, when AIDS was overwhelming the community, ‚ÄúTainted Love‚Äù appeared once again, this time via the British group Coil. Their video for the song cast one of their own members as a man dying of the disease, finally putting the plague into full, savage focus. ‚ÄìJim Farber\n\nListen: Soft Cell, ‚ÄúTainted Love‚Äù\n\nGrace Jones: ‚ÄúPull Up to the Bumper‚Äù (1981)\n\nThe subject matter of ‚ÄúPull Up to the Bumper‚Äù has been interpreted widely as anal sex, oral sex, and, well, simply parking a car. But therein lies the sly, transgressive power of Grace Jones: Between her cutting sense of humor and relish of outr√© spectacle, the Jamaican pop iconoclast has never been hemmed in by flimsy, pearl-clutching moral codes, even if those same codes most likely played a role in the song‚Äôs mainstream radio swift ban for its ‚Äúlewd content.‚Äù (It was released the year of Reagan‚Äôs inauguration, after all.)\n\nJones‚Äô genre-hopping artistry earned her a diehard LGBTQ+ fan base from day one, largely because of her very uncommon divadom. By gleefully toying with masculine and feminine conventions, she offered her queer audience a constantly evolving performance in which they could recognize their own sexual fluidity. ‚ÄúBumper‚Äù succinctly captures Jones‚Äô protean mix of playfulness and aggression, simultaneously tongue-in-cheek and dead serious. It‚Äôs a masterstroke of double entendre that, with its sinuous reggae-disco backdrop and Jones‚Äô snarled vehicular puns, really only demands one thing from you: that you move. ‚ÄìEric Torres\n\nListen: Grace Jones, ‚ÄúPull Up to the Bumper‚Äù\n\nPete Shelley: ‚ÄúHomosapien‚Äù (1981)\n\nPete Shelley shared private lusts to which the shame clung like incense on priestly robes. Embracing synthesizers just when everyone else in England did, the former Buzzcocks singer-guitarist coaxed out of them what everyone in England wasn‚Äôt: writing without a hint of code-switching about homo superiors in his interiors. The clinking-clanking ‚ÄúHomosapien‚Äù made an excellent solo debut for a songwriter whose previous works relied on the all-purpose second person pronoun yet whose prissy, epicene vocals, on desperation moves like ‚ÄúEver Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn‚Äôtve‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou Say You Don‚Äôt Love Me,‚Äù gave the game away. This is a vignette by an orgasm addict, out and loving it, of understanding that life is as much performed as it is lived, of cruising for losers because it‚Äôs fun. Not as fun: the BBC banning it for its ‚Äúexplicit reference to gay sex.‚Äù Their loss. ‚ÄìAlfred Soto\n\nListen: Pete Shelley, ‚ÄúHomosapien‚Äù\n\nThe Smiths: ‚ÄúThis Charming Man‚Äù (1983)\n\nBefore Morrissey became the poster boy for sad, doe-eyed wallflowers, he introduced himself to America as a ‚Äúprophet for the fourth gender.‚Äù And abruptly here, in a decade of conservative straitjacketing, was this proto-hipster Victorian ghost of a pop star who gushed over Oscar Wilde bon mots and cruised a male automobile driver right on back.\n\n‚ÄúThis Charming Man‚Äù was the Smiths‚Äô first major hit in the UK; it‚Äôs spoiled for riches with one of Johnny Marr‚Äôs greatest pop guitar lines, a jaunty wink of an Andy Rourke bassline, and some of Morrissey‚Äôs most lavishly antique overtures. (Try typing ‚Äúit's gruesome that someone so handsome should care‚Äù at your next reticent Tinder match!) And fittingly to Wilde, the most eccentric asides spoke volumes; Morrissey‚Äôs most inexplicable line, ‚Äúa jumped-up pantry boy who never knew his place,‚Äù references the homoerotic 1972 thriller Sleuth, which starred Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier. Ensuing years would prove Morrissey a disturbing icon for anyone, including LGBTQ+ people, but his debut was faultless; oh, for the halcyon days when Morrissey didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúa stitch to wear,‚Äù before he wore so many woeful opinions densely on his sleeve. ‚ÄìStacey Anderson\n\nListen: The Smiths, ‚ÄúThis Charming Man‚Äù\n\nCulture Club: ‚ÄúChurch of the Poison Mind‚Äù (1983)\n\nWriting for Rolling Stone in 1983, the critic Stephen Holden contrasted the queer stylings of Boy George and David Bowie circa Ziggy Stardust. ‚ÄúGeorge was no icy alien parading at a safe emotional distance,‚Äù wrote Holden. ‚ÄúInstead of concealing his ‚Äògirlish‚Äô feelings, he flaunted them, putting his heart on the line along with his fantasies.‚Äù His assessment rings true when you hear ‚ÄúChurch of the Poison Mind,‚Äù a song that proposes countering the hateful ideology suggested in its title with radiant spirit and undeniable melody.\n\n‚ÄúChurch of the Poison Mind‚Äù rings with the buoyant joy of the finest Motown hits; it‚Äôs not a secret that its beat and wheedling harmonica are pilfered from Stevie Wonder‚Äôs ‚ÄúUptight (Everything‚Äôs Alright).‚Äù (George once sang Wonder‚Äôs hit over his own, putting on a show for a writer on Culture Club‚Äôs tour bus.) It‚Äôs one of a few songs on Colour by Numbers in which George faces off against ferocious backup singer Helen Terry, whose wailing electrifies the chorus. Together, they pose an important question: If you‚Äôre living in a society distorted by prejudice, why not take a chance on joy whenever you can? Lock eyes with someone across the street and let infatuation take over; embrace love, whatever form it takes. It‚Äôs an irresistible suggestion, and for a moment, it made an unrepentantly queer frontman a pop icon. As George said in 1984, while accepting the Grammy for Best New Artist, ‚ÄúThank you, America. You‚Äôve got good taste, style, and you know a good drag queen when you see one.‚Äù ‚ÄìJamieson Cox\n\nListen: Culture Club, ‚ÄúChurch of the Poison Mind‚Äù\n\nFrankie Goes to Hollywood: ‚ÄúRelax‚Äù (1983)\n\nMost humans of a certain age have heard ‚ÄúRelax‚Äù so many times, it‚Äôs easy to forget that it‚Äôs totally, explicitly a song about having gay sex. It‚Äôs also remarkable that a song about gay sex would, in 1984, go on to become one of the highest-selling singles in the history of the UK pop charts. ‚ÄúRelax‚Äù may be relentlessly ‚Äô80s in its production and design‚Äîsynthy, bombastic, slick beyond measure‚Äîbut it remains one of the catchiest pop songs of its era. Bolstered by an infamously kinky video featuring live tigers and an S&M sex dungeon‚Äîplus a subsequent fashion craze inspired by Katharine Hamnett‚Äôs ‚ÄúFrankie Say Relax‚Äù t-shirts‚Äîthe song and all its attendant imagery would push the envelope even by today‚Äôs standards. At a time when gay sexuality was still mostly communicated via clever allusions and nonthreatening feyness, ‚ÄúRelax‚Äù was not only a raunchy, sex-positive middle finger to the establishment, it was also‚Äîdespite being banned by the BBC and MTV‚Äîthe biggest pop song in the world. ‚ÄìT. Cole Rachel\n\nListen: Frankie Goes to Hollywood, ‚ÄúRelax‚Äù\n\nBronski Beat: ‚ÄúSmalltown Boy‚Äù (1984)\n\nThe British synth-pop trio Bronski Beat specialized in turning the subtexts of disco into text. Pinning singer Jimmy Somerville‚Äôs gender is hard at first‚Äîin his long cry that is ‚ÄúSmalltown Boy,‚Äù it feels like it could come from queer youth anywhere who were eager to escape their small towns. Released in 1984, the year the AIDS epidemic hit its crisis moment, Bronski Beat‚Äôs debut album The Age of Consent presented itself as a political document‚Äîthe sleeve lists the ages of consent around the world for gay men, as if to say, this is the real politics of dancing. ‚ÄúCry, boy, cry,‚Äù Somerville sings, the besieged kid as subject and object.\n\nAny doubts about what ‚ÄúSmalltown Boy‚Äù concerned itself with should turn to the video, in which Somerville plays the escaping kid, finding sanctuary in the city and in scoping out a cute diver. Maybe he hooked up with the diver in a club that was playing the same Hi-NRG disco that Bronski Beat specialized in. Still, as those synthesizers continue their chimes of doom, it‚Äôs difficult to hear solace; there was still too far to go. ‚ÄìAlfred Soto\n\nListen: Bronski Beat, ‚ÄúSmalltown Boy‚Äù\n\nErasure: ‚ÄúOh L‚ÄôAmour‚Äù (1986)\n\nArguably the most outr√© gay synth-pop band of all time, Erasure‚Äôs now three-decade discography is like a mirror of contemporary gay culture. ‚ÄúOh, L‚Äôamour‚Äù‚Äîthe third single from the band‚Äôs 1986 debut‚Äîis Erasure doing the absolute most. Queeny, campy, catchy, and swooningly romantic, it wrapped up all the typical lost-love trappings already so ubiquitous in pop music (‚ÄúOh l‚Äôamour, mon amour/What‚Äôs a boy in love supposed to do?‚Äù) and refracted them through an unapologetically gay lens, complete with throwing yourself down on the floor when the boy of your dreams doesn‚Äôt remember your name. Though it was considered something of a flop upon release, the song was rescued by the now-legendary ‚ÄúFunky Sisters Remix,‚Äù which made it a hit in the clubs and a forever staple in Erasure‚Äôs setlist. A gay classic for the ages, ‚ÄúOh L‚Äôamour‚Äù is a song that proves that the best place to get over the heartbreak of being ignored and misunderstood is the middle of a dancefloor. ‚ÄìT. Cole Rachel\n\nTracy Chapman: ‚ÄúFast Car‚Äù (1988)\n\nIn 1988, the Cleveland-born contralto Tracy Chapman delivered her haunting debut single, ‚ÄúFast Car,‚Äù a four-and-a-half-minute glimpse into the horror show that was Reagan‚Äôs America. Ever since, queer folks have seen themselves mirrored in Chapman‚Äôs tale of a high school dropout-turned-supermarket-checkout girl living in a homeless shelter, desperately hoping to hop in her lover‚Äôs fast car and escape her small-town confines, lest she ‚Äúlive and die this way.‚Äù The socially outcast couple‚ÄîChapman sidesteps gender pronouns‚Äîclings to romantic intimacy (‚ÄúYour arm felt nice wrapped ‚Äôround my shoulder‚Äù) as they strive for quality of life in the face of cosmically cruel odds. The irony is that the dreadlocked, butch-outfitted, androgyne Chapman has never officially come out of the closet (ex-lovers, including author Alice Walker, outed her in subsequent years).\n\nThe song‚Äôs immortality has much to do with the persistence of class tension: One out of every five LGBTQ+ people in the U.S. who live alone still live at or below the poverty line, at a disproportionate rate to straights. With her ability to conjure the blues in songs like ‚ÄúFast Car,‚Äù when we most need to hear them, Tracy Chapman remains a cherished icon in LGBTQ+ circles, regardless of which side of the closet she happens to be on. ‚ÄìJason King\n\nListen: Tracy Chapman, ‚ÄúFast Car‚Äù\n\nTen City: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the Way Love Is‚Äù (1989)\n\nSpearheaded in the 1980s by Midwestern innovators like Frankie Knuckles, Ron Hardy, Jamie Principle, and Marshall Jefferson, Chicago house was dance music created in, and intended for, black gay clubs. It featured programmed drums, sequencers, bass modules, and eerie synthesizers, these sometimes married to traditional gospel keys and churchy, uplifting vocals. Of its small handful of standalone classics, Ten City‚Äôs R&B chart hit ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the Way Love Is‚Äù stands above. Foregrounding a bittersweet lyric about marriage vows gone sour, plus a whole lot of wah-wah guitar and thumping Sunday morning piano, the track remains a singalong party-starter. (Club Shelter DJ Timmy Regisford‚Äôs mix places the strangely out-of-sync synth strings front and center; it‚Äôs become the gold standard.)\n\nThough the production will always have a quaint late-‚Äô80s tinge, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the Way Love Is‚Äù still feels like a sophisticated ‚Äô70s throwback in the style of the Spinners‚Äô ‚ÄúMighty Love‚Äù or Double Exposure‚Äôs ‚ÄúMy Love Is Free.‚Äù Ten City‚Äôs each-man-take-a-turn vocals are really the star here‚Äîespecially those of plaintive Byron Stingily, whose post-bridge Pentecostal falsetto howl is still the fastest ticket you can purchase to gospel-house paradise. ‚ÄìJason King\n\nListen: Ten City, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the Way Love Is‚Äù\n\nMadonna: ‚ÄúExpress Yourself‚Äù (1989)\n\nIn the glittering, self-actualized utopia of ‚ÄúExpress Yourself,‚Äù Madonna reached an early, pivotal career high. Through clearly feminist self-affirmations, a charging and muscular club-pop groove, and a homoerotic art-deco masterpiece of a video inspired by Fritz Lang‚Äôs Metropolis and helmed by David Fincher‚Äîthe most expensive clip of its time‚Äîshe crafted a symbolic salve for LGBTQ+ people everywhere. Madonna‚Äôs longtime, well-documented support of their community may be most palpable in 1990‚Äôs ‚ÄúVogue,‚Äù with its ballroom-lifted choreography, or 1992‚Äôs ‚ÄúIn This Life,‚Äù a somber remembrance of friends lost to AIDS, but ‚ÄúExpress Yourself‚Äù is unique in how it speaks to a distinctly LGBTQ+ experience: living your truth in the clearest terms possible. By gleefully encouraging her fans to lay bare their wants and needs, she makes it plain that it‚Äôs within each of us to have transparent, even-footed relationships‚Äîwhether with ourselves or other people. That the hit song simultaneously laid out a musical blueprint for Lady Gaga‚Äôs unabashed LGBTQ+ anthem ‚ÄúBorn This Way,‚Äù 22 years later, is the deliciously reductive cherry on top. ‚ÄìEric Torres\n\nListen: Madonna, ‚ÄúExpress Yourself‚Äù\n\nGeorge Michael: ‚ÄúFreedom! ‚Äô90‚Äù (1990)\n\n‚ÄúTeenybop idol‚Äù and similar epithets had dogged George Michael since his time in Wham!, as had rumors about him being gay. Like the solo album it arrived with, Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1, ‚ÄúFreedom! ‚Äô90‚Äù was Michael‚Äôs attempt to prove his pop virtuosity and reclaim his image, stifling all that gossip. (He only succeeded at the former.) ‚ÄúFreedom! ‚Äô90‚Äù is a stripping-down but no slash-and-burn; an electric bass still snakes its way under the track‚Äôs otherwise acoustic first four minutes. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something deep inside of me/There‚Äôs someone else I‚Äôve got to be,‚Äù sings Michael, closet subtext no doubt intended, over gospel-dense vocal layers‚Äînot only asking fans to have faith in his new sound, but demanding that they have it.\n\nMichael appeared on neither the cover of his own album nor in the David Fincher‚Äìdirected music video for ‚ÄúFreedom! ‚Äô90,‚Äù leaving a sextet of supermodels to lip-sync in his stead while a jukebox and other Faith-era iconography burst into flames. Michael lived privately out as bisexual and, later, gay for over a decade before a much-publicized cruising arrest in 1998 forced him to come out more publicly. Released at a time when out gay men couldn‚Äôt be pop stars, ‚ÄúFreedom! ‚Äô90‚Äù was a fascinating peek at Michael‚Äôs mind and the complexities of living life authentically. ‚ÄìHarron Walker\n\nListen: George Michael, ‚ÄúFreedom! ‚Äô90‚Äù\n\nPet Shop Boys: ‚ÄúBeing Boring‚Äù (1990)\n\nIn 1990, when the number of gay men dying of AIDS in the West approached its hideous zenith, the Pet Shop Boys released a song that, more than any other, captured the cost. ‚ÄúBeing Boring‚Äù‚Äîwhich opens the duo‚Äôs fourth album, Behaviour‚Äîtakes place in three eras: First, the 1920s, with a quote from Zelda Fitzgerald that lends the song its title. Then, the narration switches to the 1970s and turns autobiographical, tracing the moment when singer Neil Tennant ‚Äúbolted through a closing door‚Äù to a new gay life (something he had yet to declare publicly when the song was released). The song ends at the start of the 1990s, when Tennant finds himself in a strange and shrinking world, haunted by ‚Äúall the people I was kissing,‚Äù many of whom are now missing.\n\nMadonna‚Äôs song ‚ÄúThis Used to Be My Playground,‚Äù released two years later, has often been cited as the great elegy to vanishing gay friends during the AIDS crisis. But if Madonna‚Äôs song expressed empathy from an ally, the Pet Shop Boys‚Äô proved even more consequential by coming from men whose own lives were on the line. ‚ÄìJim Farber\n\nListen: Pet Shop Boys, ‚ÄúBeing Boring‚Äù\n\nk.d. lang: ‚ÄúConstant Craving‚Äù (1992)\n\nAfter over a decade in country music, k.d. lang broke out of conservative Nashville with her yearning, flowing torch song ‚ÄúConstant Craving.‚Äù When she won the Best Female Pop Vocal Performance Grammy for it, religious groups protested outside the ceremony. The World Health Organization had only just declassified homosexuality as a mental illness; coming out of the closet, as lang had just done in The Advocate, was considered a career-killer. But lang was unafraid to invite controversy with her embrace of her own desire, an electric current that hums through every note of the song.\n\nWith her unlikely, erotic pop hit, lang helped usher in the ‚Äô90s era of so-called ‚Äúlesbian chic.‚Äù She immediately became an icon‚Äîsplashed across provocative magazine covers in androgynous clothing, creating visibility for homosexual women in a time when the focus was often on gay men. Small-town queer women used her as a guiding star to navigate their own identities; lang‚Äôs soaring vocals soundtracked countless slow dances and sexual awakenings in hole-in-the-wall gay bars. To this day, ‚ÄúConstant Craving‚Äù continues to provide connection for those who need it.\n\n‚ÄìLorena Cupcake\n\nListen: k.d. lang, ‚ÄúConstant Craving‚Äù\n\nMelissa Etheridge: ‚ÄúCome to My Window‚Äù (1993)\n\nFour years before Ellen DeGeneres‚Äô famous ‚ÄúYep, I‚Äôm Gay‚Äù Time magazine cover, Melissa Etheridge defiantly declared Yes I Am, as both the name of her fourth studio album and a thinly veiled response to the rumors that had been dogging her since the beginning of her career. Where the record‚Äôs title may have been coy, its hit single, ‚ÄúCome to My Window,‚Äù was anything but: a scorching mid-tempo ballad of longing, heartache, and dependency.\n\nThe iconic video for ‚ÄúCome to My Window‚Äù stars a young Juliette Lewis, in a tank top and shag haircut, screaming the song‚Äôs lyrics while suffering a mental breakdown in a dingy psych ward. She writhes and splutters in her bed, dramatizing Etheridge‚Äôs comparatively subdued delivery‚Äîuntil near the end of the bridge, when Etheridge lets out a guttural wail to match her white-hot desire. Of course, all human beings deal with wanting each other, but here, Etheridge gave a new face to that particular brand of young queer yearning, with all its excitement and doubt and fear, without succumbing to the clich√© of ‚Äúthe love that dare not speak its name.‚Äù ‚ÄìCameron Cook\n\nListen: Melissa Etheridge, ‚ÄúCome to My Window‚Äù\n\nRuPaul: ‚ÄúSupermodel (You Better Work)‚Äù (1993)\n\nOne of pop‚Äôs most subtle subversives, RuPaul used the charm, hooks, and wit of his breakthrough hit to become the first mainstream-approved drag queen. His debut single, which sold over 500,000 copies, brought elements from three key subcultures‚Äîdrawn from black, gay, and drag experience‚Äîonto suburban dancefloors. It also popularized declarative tag lines like ‚Äúsashay/shantay,‚Äù taken from the demimonde of drag balls. Three years earlier, that culture had been tipped to the outside world by Jennie Livingston‚Äôs documentary Paris Is Burning; that same year, Madonna amplified the scene with ‚ÄúVogue.‚Äù But Ru had, by far, the deepest understanding of the milieu, as well as the most at stake in representing its realities, beauty, and power. ‚ÄìJim Farber\n\nListen: RuPaul, ‚ÄúSupermodel (You Better Work)‚Äù\n\nJunior Vasquez: ‚ÄúIf Madonna Calls‚Äù [ft. Franklin Fuentes] (1996)\n\nIf it weren‚Äôt for Junior Vasquez, Madonna may not have learned to vogue. The house producer and DJ introduced her to New York‚Äôs ball scene, and before long, the hyper-queer dance made its way into her 1990 hit ‚ÄúVogue‚Äù‚Äîstripped of its context, of course, upsetting its original community.\n\nVasquez maintained a working relationship with Madonna for several years after ‚ÄúVogue,‚Äù continuing to remix her work. But 1996‚Äôs ‚ÄúIf Madonna Calls‚Äù signals a break in their friendship; it‚Äôs an uptempo ‚Äúbitch track‚Äù featuring what is ostensibly a message left by the pop star on Vasquez‚Äôs answering machine. However the beef may have originated, guest vocalist Franklin Fuentes makes feelings plain with his bitter instruction to let Madonna know he‚Äôs not around if she calls. The voicemail is the centerpiece of the track, with Vasquez expertly splicing Madonna‚Äôs words into the club banger. By the time the track draws to a close, we‚Äôre left with a caustic punch line: ‚ÄúActually, if Madonna calls, disconnect her.‚Äù While Vasquez has since claimed he has no hard feelings, ‚ÄúIf Madonna Calls‚Äù is plenty vindication for the queens left in ‚ÄúVogue‚Äù‚Äôs wake. ‚ÄìMichael Siebert\n\nListen: Junior Vasquez, ‚ÄúIf Madonna Calls‚Äù [ft. Franklin Fuentes]\n\nSleater-Kinney: ‚ÄúOne More Hour‚Äù (1997)\n\nSleater-Kinney‚Äôs third album, Dig Me Out, is full of desperation and heartbreak, and on ‚ÄúOne More Hour,‚Äù they‚Äôre at their most vulnerable. Corin Tucker‚Äôs lyrics frankly address the end of her relationship with bandmate Carrie Brownstein, details of which were published in a disastrous Spin article that outed Brownstein without her permission.\n\nIt‚Äôs a song full of dichotomies, offering a hint at how the delicate interplay between Tucker and Brownstein‚Äôs guitars and vocals might have mirrored their personal lives. Brownstein‚Äôs jittery lead riff quickly locks into Tucker‚Äôs bright chords, and before long, Tucker‚Äôs trademark vibrato bursts into the fore with details that are as painful as they are relatable: clothes left behind, the prospect of other future girls, the urge to hold each other close before it‚Äôs over for good. Brownstein plays the comforter, anchoring Tucker‚Äôs howls with gently sung affirmations. In other hands, ‚ÄúOne More Hour‚Äù could have just been another breakup song. Instead, Sleater-Kinney created a master class in heartache, a queer anthem that is at once deeply personal and universal. ‚ÄìMichael Siebert\n\nListen: Sleater-Kinney, ‚ÄúOne More Hour‚Äù\n\nFirst appearing on the band's demo tape Don‚Äôt Knock It Til You Try It, ‚ÄúI Love Hardcore Boys, I Love Boys Hardcore‚Äù is a wiry, brash punk spectacle. It breaks down the band‚Äôs attraction to dudes across all the punk and hardcore sub-scenes, from the whiny emo guys to the skinheads in tight pants and boy in between. Martin‚Äôs raspy, sassy shouts over a pummeling drumbeat and loud, fuzzy guitars set Limp Wrist in line with hardcore, but it's their message of LGBTQ+ acceptance‚Äîsorely needed in their community‚Äîthat makes them truly punk. ‚ÄìAlex Smith\n\nListen: Limp Wrist, ‚ÄúI Love Hardcore Boys, I Love Boys Hardcore‚Äù\n\nCommon: ‚ÄúBetween Me, You & Liberation‚Äù (2002)\n\nIn its spacious, sax-laded groove, ‚ÄúBetween Me, You & Liberation‚Äù allows Common plenty of space to parse a then-taboo topic in hip-hop: queer acceptance. In the final verse, the Chicago rapper relates a story about a friend coming out to him as gay, a revelation he doesn‚Äôt handle well at first: ‚ÄúThis is how real life‚Äôs supposed to be?/For it to happen to someone close to me?‚Äù Common raps, setting the emotional scene. ‚ÄúSo far we‚Äôd come, for him to tell me/As he did, insecurity held me/I felt like he failed me.‚Äù\n\nDespite hip-hop‚Äôs history of queer intolerance, and Common‚Äôs own participating lyrics in the past, ‚ÄúBetween‚Äù is a story that ends with acceptance. Common renounces his past hostility, ultimately delivering a powerful statement a little clumsily; after questioning his biases, he finally declares, ‚ÄúThrough sexuality, he liberated himself.‚Äù While earnest, it didn‚Äôt eradicate homophobia overnight; in fact, the singer on the hook, Cee-Lo, has since made antagonistic remarks to the LGBTQ+ community. But ‚ÄúBetween Me, You & Liberation‚Äù opened a door in a scene that needed it badly, and challenged the orthodoxy of mainstream rap in its own delicate way. ‚ÄìAlex Smith\n\nListen: Common, ‚ÄúBetween Me, You & Liberation‚Äù\n\nScissor Sisters: ‚ÄúTake Your Mama‚Äù (2004)\n\nThe mainstream gay rights movement took a hard right in the new millennium, with issues like marriage and adoption coming to the forefront. San Francisco briefly issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples in 2004, and Massachusetts became the first state to recognize same-sex marriages shortly after. Around that same time, Scissor Sisters released ‚ÄúTake Your Mama,‚Äù a raucous, backwoods dance track about coming out to your mom and showing her a gay ol‚Äô time. ‚ÄúTake your mama out all night/So she‚Äôll have no doubt that we‚Äôre doing the best we can,‚Äù sing Jake Shears and Ana Matronic in their best Bee Gees falsetto.\n\n‚ÄúTake Your Mama‚Äù came from an unmistakably queer perspective, one with broad appeal; queers straddling New York‚Äôs rock and electroclash scenes, as well as those in other cities worldwide, saw a familiar slice of nightlife elevated to a greater stage, while the baby gays watching the music video in their parents‚Äô houses got a taste of what life might be like in the great, grown-up world beyond. It also reflected a growing anxiety among queer people: In this new era of blending traditional family structures with ones created out of want and necessity, could the two ever coexist without the former swallowing the latter whole? ‚ÄìHarron Walker\n\nListen: Scissor Sisters, ‚ÄúTake Your Mama‚Äù\n\nLady Gaga: ‚ÄúBorn This Way‚Äù (2011)\n\nFour years before gay marriage became legal across the United States, Lady Gaga put out her most unabashed LGBTQ+ anthem. She had cultivated a queer fan base since 2008‚Äôs ‚ÄúJust Dance,‚Äù and even hinted that 2008‚Äôs ‚ÄúPoker Face‚Äù was about her own bisexuality, but ‚ÄúBorn This Way‚Äù cut out the subtlety: This was a dance-pop banger about how every queer kid on Earth was born perfect. The stomping four-on-the-floor beat and triumphant hook make ‚ÄúBorn This Way‚Äù an irresistible, adrenalizing ride, and Gaga‚Äôs snarling vocals add some high camp flair. By 2011, Pride had already become a high profile affair, but no other star had instructed their massive fan base to ‚Äújust be a queen‚Äù in a No. 1 hit, nor had anyone this big in pop explicitly proclaimed that queer people were not a curse upon the Earth but a blessing. Gaga was at the peak of her powers, and she used the moment to preach the gospel of Mother Monster: The gayer you are, the closer to God.\n\n‚ÄìSasha Geffen\n\nListen: Lady Gaga, ‚ÄúBorn This Way‚Äù\n\nFrank Ocean: ‚ÄúForrest Gump‚Äù (2012)\n\nIt was a Tumblr post that hit popular culture like an earthquake, and Frank Ocean wrote it in such filmic fashion: on a plane from New Orleans to L.A. after a ‚Äúmarred‚Äù Christmas. If the mythical, American story of Frank Ocean should ever be set to film, this will be the opening scene: Frank with a laptop and a window seat and his internal monologue, typing out the note to say that his first love was a man, and that he now felt free. These two miraculous paragraphs closely preceded the release of 2012‚Äôs Channel Orange, and monumentally disrupted what we thought we knew about Ocean.\n\n‚ÄúForrest Gump‚Äù is the penultimate track of Channel Orange, as if Frank knew that placing it earlier would reveal too much too soon. He flips the gender script of the titular film, and in its uneven romance of Forrest and Jenny, he is Jenny. But the truth of ‚ÄúForrest Gump‚Äù is spelled out perfectly clear, so corporeally. ‚ÄúYou run my mind, boy,‚Äù Ocean sings on this spare soul ballad, his voice disarmingly close, letting through the occasional cracked and vulnerable note. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so buff and so strong/I‚Äôm nervous, Forrest.‚Äù If there is any confusion that ‚ÄúForrest Gump‚Äù is an ode to Frank‚Äôs first love, he echoes his Tumblr post verbatim: ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt forget you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìJenn Pelly\n\nListen: Frank Ocean, ‚ÄúForrest Gump‚Äù\n\nTegan and Sara: ‚ÄúCloser‚Äù (2012)\n\nTegan and Sara are already an iconic singer-songwriter duo‚Äînot just charismatic and Canadian but out, and lesbian, and twins! with impeccable haircuts!‚Äîand they had been indie stars since 2007‚Äôs The Con, a collection of alternatively dark and melancholy pop-folk. But it was 2013‚Äôs Heartthrob‚Äîand specifically its lead single, ‚ÄúCloser‚Äù‚Äîthat provided audiences with a timeless queer anthem, as well as the duo‚Äôs first U.S. chart hit. Written by Tegan, ‚ÄúCloser‚Äù combines nostalgic emo and pop-punk notes with an unrepentant four-to-the-floor beat, making it work both as a dancefloor-filler and as music to make out to (or just fantasize about making out to).\n\n‚ÄúCloser‚Äù is a song about the anticipation before the kiss, before anything gets physical. It‚Äôs a love song that conjures adolescent longing, no matter how old you are, with impossibly catchy, cleverly rhyming lyrics. And it‚Äôs that cherishing of that gap between anticipation and release‚Äîasking to be closer, not touching; cherishing the moment before you realize you‚Äôre in too deep‚Äîthat seems to speak to that particularly queer feeling of wanting something you know you may never get. ‚ÄìLarissa Pham\n\nListen: Tegan and Sara, ‚ÄúCloser‚Äù\n\nAgainst Me!: ‚ÄúTrue Trans Soul Rebel‚Äù (2014)\n\nWhen Against Me! lead singer Laura Jane Grace came out as trans in 2012, she wrote an album of diamond-sharp punk songs to carve her emotional process into stone. The album is often her in the throes of depression, alone, on some godforsaken frontier; she screams about the rapture of self-acceptance into the black void of a world who views her as a stranger. The tone of the album ranges anywhere from black to pitch black.\n\nOn Grace‚Äôs ode to outcasts, ‚ÄúTrue Trans Soul Rebel,‚Äù self-love mutates into fear, doubt, loneliness, and anger. She squares off against God and asks who blesses the unchanging hearts of trans men and women. Out of this despair comes one of the best hooks of the decade: ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs gonna take you home tonight?‚Äù It is a rebuke and a catharsis, a whisper and a scream, all surrounded by huge guitars and drums trying to bring down an arena. Love wages a constant battle with our worse angels, and it‚Äôs inspiring to hear Grace‚Äôs tale from the frontlines. ‚ÄìJeremy D. Larson\n\nListen: Against Me!, ‚ÄúTrue Trans Soul Rebel‚Äù\n\nPerfume Genius: ‚ÄúQueen‚Äù (2014)\n\nMike Hadreas had already emerged as a powerful queer voice in music by the time of 2014‚Äôs Too Bright‚Äînot least for his tearful 2010 ballad ‚ÄúMr. Peterson,‚Äù in which told the devastating tale of a troubled teacher who ‚Äúlet me smoke weed in his truck/if I could convince him I loved him enough.‚Äù On ‚ÄúQueen,‚Äù Hadreas channeled a lifetime of cold stares from strangers and draped them in sheets of glitter. In seven words, within a slowly-churning glam-pop daydream, he wrote a generation-defining anthem and sang it resiliently: ‚ÄúNo family is safe/When I sashay.‚Äù\n\nThis refrain cleverly, thrillingly skewered the very notions of gay panic and ‚Äúfamily values,‚Äù making ‚ÄúQueen‚Äù a classic upon arrival. It is the sound of defiantly being femme in public, and it immediately topped the pantheon of Hadreas‚Äô best songs. ‚ÄúI sometimes see faces of blank fear when I walk by,‚Äù Hadreas has said of the song. ‚ÄúIf these fucking people want to give me some power‚Äîif they see me as some sea witch with penis tentacles that are always prodding and poking and seeking to convert the muggles‚Äîwell, here she comes.‚Äù ‚ÄìJenn Pelly\n\nListen: Perfume Genius, ‚ÄúQueen‚Äù\n\nJohn Grant: ‚ÄúSnug Slacks‚Äù (2015)\n\nHis religious parents thought he needed to be ‚Äúfixed,‚Äù he developed an anxiety disorder after facing homophobic bullying during his youth, and he battled with drug and alcohol abuse. In 2011, he discovered he was HIV positive. It‚Äôs a wonder John Grant is producing music at all, let alone receiving such critical acclaim for it.\n\n‚ÄúSnug Slacks‚Äù is sleazy dance music that makes no bones about the sexual predilections of its singer. It‚Äôs a leering come-on from a mature male who‚Äôs happy in his own skin (entirely at odds to the way Grant felt about himself for most of his life) to a younger, prettier, self-obsessed man. The message is simple: You may think you‚Äôre God‚Äôs gift, but I‚Äôve been around a lot longer, and there‚Äôs nothing that I haven‚Äôt seen before. Irresistibly filthy, bordering on the obscene, ‚ÄúSnug Slacks‚Äù could not have been written 50 years ago. It takes decades of bump‚Äòn‚Äôgrind macho posturing and flips it on its head (and on its back), beautifully demonstrating how far LGBTQ+ musicians‚Äîand audiences of all sexualities‚Äîhave come. ‚ÄìDarryl Bullock\n\nListen: John Grant, ‚ÄúSnug Slacks‚Äù\n\nThe Internet: ‚ÄúGirl‚Äù (2015)\n\n‚ÄúGirl‚Äù sure sounds familiar at first listen. Soulfully sung by the former Odd Future member Syd, and produced by Kaytranada with a bouncy, low-key beat and a sunny Neil Merryweather sample, ‚ÄúGirl‚Äù is a tender ballad for long, hot summer days. And what makes it so laid-back is also what makes it so revolutionary. It‚Äôs a song about a woman, sung by a woman; it‚Äôs unapologetically, openly queer. But it‚Äôs also an ordinary love song, concerned with the intimate universe that can exist between just two people‚Äîa song where Syd, who may be a fickle lover, sings about making and breaking promises.\n\n‚ÄúGirl‚Äù is equal parts bravado and pleading for love to be returned, pared down into a relaxed R&B jam that goes on for so long, it‚Äôs almost like a daydream. Near the end, Syd has a change of heart, wondering if she‚Äôs really in love. ‚ÄúCan we just live in the moment?‚Äù she asks. In other words, instead of marching toward something, let‚Äôs just hold hands‚Äîsomething that, for LGBTQ+ people, finally feels possible. ‚ÄìLarissa Pham\n\nListen: The Internet, ‚ÄúGirl‚Äù\n\nWhile it‚Äôs likely that there have been other hit rap songs by queer artists, what makes the triple-platinum ‚ÄúOOOUUU‚Äù even more special is that it was penned by a rapper who was out, proud, and unambiguous about her identity (the ‚ÄúM.A‚Äù stands for ‚ÄúMe, Always‚Äù). What‚Äôs also notable is hip-hop‚Äôs reception: For the most part, M.A wasn‚Äôt othered or marginalized as a ‚Äùgay rapper.‚Äù She was accepted and celebrated as a talent. This is what being yourself sounds like. ‚ÄìTimmhotep Aku\n\nListen: Young M.A, ‚ÄúOOOUUU‚Äù\n\nStarrah & Diplo: ‚ÄúImperfections‚Äù (2017)\n\nIn the 2010s, more than ever, we‚Äôve seen pop‚Äôs hybridization with rap. The influence is clear in pop singers‚Äô rap-inflected phrasing, song lyrics that borrow words from the hip-hop lexicon, bass-heavy beats and, of course, guest verses from the MC du jour. For the past four years, Starrah (aka Brittany Hazzard) has been at the creative forefront of this intersection and one of the premier songwriters behind the scenes, crafting constant hits for pop icons; she‚Äôs lent the sauce to Camila Cabello (‚ÄúHavana‚Äù), Rihanna (‚ÄúNeeded Me‚Äù), Travis Scott and Young Thug (‚ÄúPick Up the Phone‚Äù), and Drake (‚ÄúFake Love‚Äù).\n\nAs Starrah steps into the spotlight herself‚Äîalbeit with a K-pop-inspired mouth mask‚Äîher fingerprints on today‚Äôs hits are becoming more visible. ‚ÄúImperfections,‚Äù from her collaborative EP with Diplo, is exemplary of all the touches that make her songwriting so appealing. Here, she is a woman singing to a woman about putting her past relationships (with fuckboys and lames) behind her. The counterpoint to the sweet melody and sentiment are brash, rapper-esque boasts that qualify Starrah as a superior partner. Pop‚Äôs elite seek out Starrah with good reason. If you know, you know. ‚ÄìTimmhotep Aku\n\nListen: Starrah & Diplo, ‚ÄúImperfections‚Äù\n\nArca: ‚ÄúDesaf√≠o‚Äù (2017)\n\nA lot of queer people have waited a lifetime for a love song as honest and complicated as ‚ÄúDesaf√≠o.‚Äù Its hook‚Äî‚ÄúLove me, bind me, and slit my throat/Search for me, penetrate me, and devour me‚Äù (translated from its Spanish)‚Äîis a gripping, direct description of queer desire. Its tempest of hot, undulating synthesizers and drums set a scene of sex and love that feels unfettered and free. It also reveals hidden inhibitions in its creator: Before ‚ÄúDesaf√≠o,‚Äù Arca‚Äôs experimental electronic songs were intense, but he hid a percolating sensuality beneath fractured noise. Up until the release of his 2017 self-titled album, Arca had never sung on his music before‚Äîand on ‚ÄúDesaf√≠o,‚Äù the yearning sensuality of his voice strikes its most passionate note.\n\nBut ‚ÄúDesaf√≠o‚Äù is more than just a new classic of queer music; it is that rare love song that continues to feel revelatory and new. Arca‚Äôs music sounds like it comes from a future we still haven‚Äôt reached‚Äîone where the way we love will be fluid and liberated and uncompromising, rejecting every single convention of the here and now. ‚ÄìKevin Lozano\n\nListen: Arca, ‚ÄúDesaf√≠o‚Äù\n\nJanelle Mon√°e: ‚ÄúMake Me Feel‚Äù (2018)\n\nWhen Janelle Mon√°e arrived in 2007 with Metropolis: Suite I (The Chase), it was as if a second P-Funk mothership had landed and Klaus Nomi stepped out of it. Following releases soldered her high concepts (Octavia Butler‚Äôs Afrofuturism, Donna Haraway‚Äôs visionary techno-feminism, and Fritz Lang‚Äôs glamorous world-building) to the boogie of Grace Jones, OutKast, and James Brown. And while Mon√°e publicly refused to pin down her sexuality, queerness was all over her interface. But a decade later, coyness no longer computes. And so, with racism and homophobia run amok in our leadership and a generation refusing to live by the binary, Mon√°e rebooted with two crucial updates: first, in pansexuality, she‚Äôs found an identity that suits her. Second, she‚Äôs celebrating realness, in both the humanistic and Sylvester sense of the word.\n\n‚ÄúMake Me Feel‚Äù is Mon√°e‚Äôs biggest hit in years, but isn‚Äôt a return to form; she‚Äôs yet to slip. Instead, it‚Äôs a tribute to form‚Äîthe shivering, shuddering pop made by Prince, her sometime-mentor and collaborator on the track, who before his death had a pretty controversial relationship to queerness (ask Wendy and Lisa). It‚Äôs an ode to queer joy and an ode to the human form, delighted with delight and fully turned on. Now, for Mon√°e, pleasure is her operating system. ‚ÄìJesse Dorris\n\nListen: Janelle Mon√°e, ‚ÄúMake Me Feel‚Äù\n\nTroye Sivan: ‚ÄúBloom‚Äù (2018)\n\nIn some ways, the Troye Sivan type has always been with us: a boyish beauty with a voice to match, a lineage that includes Fabian, Michael Jackson, and the Justins Timberlake and Bieber. In other ways, Sivan could only exist in 2018: a kid who made tracks on a laptop, became a YouTube sensation, starred in an X-Men movie, and became a pop star. And all along, his work has been explicitly, celebratorially gay.\n\nIndeed, Sivan is not only pop‚Äôs ne plus ultra of the Elio gay archetype‚Äîa naughty boy who‚Äôs not really that naughty, and about to be no longer a boy‚Äîhe‚Äôs also proof that cis, white gayness can be a selling point. If ‚ÄúBloom‚Äù were really about flowers, it could have been a hit for any artist from Doris Day to Taylor Swift. But it‚Äôs 2018, and so this beautifully made song about the power of love reveals itself as a power ballad for power bottoms, irresistibly sung by a twink with a wink. Just watch him perform it on ‚ÄúThe Today Show,‚Äù of all places, for a crowd of mostly ecstatic women, and glory at this fey fellow in a fetching yellow blouse. ‚ÄúBloom‚Äù is a ruthlessly catchy song that took a piece of gay slang for the relaxing of the anus during sexual activity and made it a mainstream romantic anthem. What a time to be alive. ‚ÄìJesse Dorris\n\nListen: Troye Sivan, ‚ÄúBloom‚Äù\n\nContributors: Timmhotep Aku, Stacey Anderson, Darryl Bullock, Cameron Cook, Jamieson Cox, Lorena Cupcake, Jesse Dorris, Jim Farber, Sasha Geffen, Jason King, Jeremy D.
