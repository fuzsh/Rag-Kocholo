        "text": "With the start of the new decade, leaders, innovators, experts, and artists across music products, pro audio, and entertainment technology gathered at the \"Crossroads\" of the global industry, The 2020 NAMM Show. Held January 16-19, in Anaheim, California, the four days of the annual gathering saw professionals convene to launch and discover the next decade of business opportunities and celebrate music-making.\n\n“It was incredible to see NAMM Members and industry professionals from around the world come together in such a positive way to experience the launch of countless new products, attend the best industry education available anywhere and to enjoy the comradery and networking that makes our musical lives so meaningful,” commented Joe Lamond, NAMM President and CEO. “The NAMM Show campus served as a living, breathing snapshot of the current global marketplace and I truly believe that our attendees who made the commitment and investment to be there have increased their competitive advantage for success in the year ahead.”\n\nThe Convergence of The Crossroads\n\nWith business at the top of mind, the Show welcomed over 2,000 exhibiting member companies, representing 7,000 brands, across all areas of The NAMM Show campus. Of the 115,888 NAMM Member and invited registrants, international members accounted for nearly 20% percent growth over two years, with realigned member badge allocations to ensure an enhanced professional attendance resulted in a more focused business experience with a slight increase in attendees. Registrants were an invited mix of industry professionals from across the crossroads and included domestic and international retail and distribution buyers and employees, exhibitors, entertainment tech and pro audio buyers and professionals, media, artists, invited guests, and The NAMM Foundation GenNext (college music students and faculty), Music Education Days (school music administrators and buyers) and Nonprofit Institute (NAMM grantees and nonprofit affiliates) participants.\n\n\"The NAMM Show is the ultimate opportunity for industry professionals to come together to share their passion for music, build relationships, and learn from each other through the vast array of educational and networking opportunities that The NAMM Show has to offer,\" said Chair of the NAMM Board of Directors, Chris Martin of C.F. Martin. \"It's a place where we hold each other up, cheer each other on, and strengthen the industry as a whole.\"\n\nTom Sumner, President of Yamaha Corporation of America, shared, \"The NAMM Show is the best opportunity of the year for Yamaha to reach our end-user customers, dealers, and the music industry as a whole. Each year, including 2020, Yamaha has increased the amount of dealers and customers we interact with at the show, and NAMM is the one place where Yamaha dealers can experience the breadth of Yamaha products. This year dealers were especially taken with several new innovative products including the SLB300 Silent Bass and the YBS480 Baritone Saxophone.\"\n\n\"[The NAMM Show] is the single most important place to promote, learn, investigate, mingle, collaborate, network, plan and claim your stake in this wonderful business of music,\" shared Bill Wenzloff of Morley who counts three decades of NAMM Show exhibition.\n\nChris Halon, Vice President of Marketing for Roland, said that \"The NAMM Show is an important annual event for Roland and the industry. We enjoy connecting with our wonderful network of industry colleagues and invigorating these relationships, some decades-long, and some brand new. It's great being able to showcase so many of our new products alongside our growing roster of artists and influencers as well… It can be busy and frantic, of course, but the one-to-one connection is invaluable, both person-to-person and person-to-instrument.\"\n\nJustin Norvell, Executive Vice President of Fender said that \"The NAMM Show is the place to showcase your brand and new products to dealers, distributors and customers. The show’s reach extends far and wide on a global scale to the music market as a whole. It’s one of the key tent-pole events that our brand works toward and we use it as a platform to launch some of our most-innovative products, including the new American Acoustasonic Stratocaster.”\n\n\"NAMM is a major show for Shure. Not only does it allow us to connect with the community and its musicians… it gives us the opportunity to introduce new products to distributors from around-the-world. Year-after-year, we leave reenergized and inspired,\" affirmed Abby Kaplan, Vice President of Global Sales for Musician and Consumer Audio.\n\n“The NAMM Show 2020 in Anaheim once more turned out to be the center hub for the global music industry,” shared Markus Theinert, Vice President of Marketing and International Sales for Conn-Selmer. “For us, as America’s largest manufacturer of band & orchestra instruments, it is important to connect with customers, suppliers, educators and artists from around the world to discuss future business opportunities as well as to stay in close touch with new product and sales trends in an ever changing world. Meeting the people is still important in our relationship industry and the NAMM show provides an ideal platform for that purpose.”\n\n\"Our presence has greatly expanded in the last few years,\" commented Mark Ravenhill, President of German Light Products. \"We see more and more people we want to talk to.\" Eric Loader, Director of Sales for ADJ, echoed that sentiment: \"We're able to meet with our existing customers but also with new customers, including international buyers.\"\n\nRusty Waite, President of K-Array, said that for the company, the crossroads are why his business continues to return: \"This is our third year, and as NAMM is more focused on pro audio and live sound companies, the [show attendees] are a good mix for business. [NAMM] is one of those shows where you have to be there.\"\n\n\"At this show, you see the company culture and the product directly and have a tactile relationship. And that definitely leads to decisions. It's one of the key things that really lead tips the scale between one manufacturer and another,\" said Emery Martin, Video Designer/Lighting Designer (Beck, Foo Fighters, Alt J, LACMA). \"I'm looking at the strengths of different manufacturers here at NAMM, so I can say one product may or may not be right for this tour, but it might be perfect for another context.\"\n\nChris Curran, Customer Development for TMB Development, said that \"January is right at the beginning of the touring season and people are still looking for ideas, and for product, concepts and what they want to do for the year, and spring and summer tours… It's been great because we've seen a lot of lighting designers from around-the-world, which is very important to us.\"\n\n\"NAMM attendees are embracing the Event Technology community and vice versa. ESTA member exhibitors enthusiastically responded that they are making new contacts and nurturing existing clients,\" affirmed Frances Thompson, ESTA Membership Manager. \"With all the energy and excitement surrounding The NAMM Show, the four days seem to go quickly. You won't find a better opportunity to grow your business and have fun doing it!\"\n\nNew-to-NAMM company Voyage Audio's owner, Colin Ritchie, says that he chose to debut his company as \"It's a large trade show that puts our product and brand in front of the right audience. We've had many inquiries from overseas and hoped to meet with some of the folks we've been in contact with.\" David Rollins, Senior Sales Manager at Foggy's Fog, another new-to-NAMM company, shared, \"The NAMM Show has been great for our business. Last year was our first time at the Show and it blew our expectations out of the water, so we came back. We're still catching up on orders from last year!\"\n\nAs the first show of the calendar year, purchasing decisions and future planning were top-of-mind for the crowd of traditional retail sellers, ecommerce, and distributors across-the-board. \"As the world's largest musical instrument retailer, Guitar Center's participation at The NAMM Show is a top priority,\" said Karl Bracken, Guitar Center Executive Vice President of Merchandising and Private Brands. \"The show provides us with an opportunity to connect with our vendor community all in one place and allows us to discuss key issues and trends in the MI space while interfacing with an exhibitors' complete teams to better showcase and demonstrate their latest offerings.\"\n\n\"Coming to NAMM gives us the unique opportunity to meet face-to-face with the buyers, sellers, and makers who invite Reverb to be part of their lives every day,\" said Kevin Drost, Chief Strategy Officer of Reverb. \"We meet with store owners to discuss how they can increase their sales online, talk with manufacturers, nonprofits, and other partners we've worked with over the years, and hear stories from musicians about the perfect piece of gear they found on our site. We're in regular contact with our users throughout the year, but there's something special about hearing success stories and getting feedback in-person. At the end of the day, Reverb wouldn't be what it is today without the passionate people who love and rely on it—the NAMM Show gives us an opportunity to celebrate together.\"\n\nMark Terry, President of KMC, said that \"NAMM has become the biggest show in the world right now for musical instruments and pro audio. Our business is very involved in both aspects of that, and there's no show like it anywhere else, so it's quite a good value for money to come and see that whole customer base in one place at one time. We're mostly in the distribution business, but it's key to us creating new relationships, and when you're a distribution company, it's about adding new product lines you can sell, and this show is where find them and meet them. We can't live without it.\"\n\nInsights, Ideas, and Strategies for the Next Decade\n\nWith the world's experts at The NAMM Show, members had the opportunity to connect with top thought leaders in best-in-class education through over 350 education sessions designed to engage, inform and inspire new ideas, as well as to further careers and prepare for the future against the backdrop of the industry gathering.\n\nEach day of the Show began with a NAMM U Breakfast Session in the Pacific Ballroom, inside the Anaheim Hilton. On Thursday, January 16, NAMM President and CEO Joe Lamond hosted \"Breakfast of Champions\" with a panel of industry leaders and innovators, including Bryan Bradley, Group One; Whitney Brown Gristaffi, Ted Brown Music; Noel Lee, Monster Cables; and David Schwartz, TEC Tracks offering their insight on the Crossroads and opportunities. Jason Mraz was presented with the Music for Life Award, an honor annually given to a musician or creative luminary whose body of work and artistry has inspired more people to make music. In his interview with Lamond, Mraz spoke of his early access to making music, with his mother having sat him at the piano and shaped his fingers to play chords, and later in school, how music teachers helped him develop his music-making abilities. \"I was fortunate to have music education in my public school, and that's why I advocate so hard for it,\" Mraz said. \"Knowing how much music shaped my life and gave me so many opportunities, I knew my career would include giving back.\"\n\nFriday's Breakfast Session welcomed digital marketing pioneer, Ann Handley as she addressed the fast-paced and always-on nature of modern marketing and answered the question, \"Is 'fast' really the best path to drive marketing transformation at your business?\" in her presentation, \"Transformative Marketing,\" and on Saturday, global customer experience expert and musician Scott McKain shared the five key characteristics of iconic organizations in \"How to Build an Iconic Business.\" On Sunday, \"Best in Show,\" led by UpBeat Daily and Music Inc. Publisher Frank Alkyer welcomed a panel of retailers and professionals who shared their product picks from the Show floor.\n\nNAMM U: Lead, Market, and Build an Experience Worthy of the New Consumer\n\nBefore the Show officially opened, over 500 NAMM retail members attended the Retail Innovation Summit or the Retail Financial Summit. At the Retail Innovation Summit, best-selling author, sales, and marketing expert Marcus Sheridan – previous host of two standing-room-only NAMM U Breakfast Sessions – walked attendees through the changing behavior of consumers, and strategies to deliver in business. At the Retail Financial Summit, financial gurus Alan Friedman and Daniel Jobe of Friedman, Kannenberg & Co. provided members with critical financial training to thrive in today's competitive marketplace, and regulatory updates and changes in sales tax and labor laws.\n\nAfter each Breakfast Session, the tools, tips, and tricks to advance business continued in the NAMM Idea Center. There, retail professionals enjoyed nearly 50 sessions designed to inspire individuals and grow their businesses with proven strategies.

Colleen Harper, Executive Director of AES, reflected on this year's event: \"The AES is uniquely positioned to provide authoritative audio training and education for NAMM attendees and our west coast membership, which is reflected in this year's strongest-ever registration for Audio Engineering Society events during The NAMM Shows. The Society appreciates the resources and opportunities that NAMM made available for the AES Academy as we assembled leading audio experts to bring in-depth session content to our attendees, be they long-time AES members or our new members who now have access to AES resources for on-going professional growth.\"\n\nFor audio pros seeking big-picture sessions with big names, TEC Tracks uncovered topics ranging from \"Mastering in L.A.\" to \"Recording Vocals Outside of the Studio\" with world-famous producer/engineers Ken Caillat, Joe Chicarelli and special guests as they discussed their favorite vocal mic chains in getting optimal sound in less than optimal settings.

Located inside Hall A, each day presented professionals with the opportunity to participate in meet-ups on topics like \"Lighting Design for the Concert Arms Race,\" and \"Tour Collaboration & Communication,\" with in-demand designers who are working on the biggest tours on the planet.\n\nIt Might Get Loud(speaker) Showcase\n\nHeld Thursday – Saturday at the Show, top sound manufacturers returned to present a showcase of line array and loudspeaker technologies at the second annual Loudspeaker System Showcase and under the guidance of the team from Live Sound International magazine.

Media, which publishes Live Sound International and ProSoundWeb. \"It's also a major step forward for loudspeaker manufacturers whose products must be heard to be truly appreciated.\"\n\nOther special education included hands-on education and experience with lighting consoles from Avolites, Chauvet, and M.A.M.A. Lighting, including the Grandma, as presented by ACT Lighting.\n\nAdditional professional development sessions included The NAMM Foundation's GenNext, a collaboration between The NAMM Foundation and The College Music Society that brings college music students and faculty to The NAMM Show for exclusive programming with access to career and professional development opportunities, Music Education Days, which offered music teachers and school administrators informative sessions, inspiring performances and the opportunity to preview the latest instruments, products, and tools; and The Nonprofit Management Institute for music nonprofits, the Foundation's partner and grantee organizations, presenting the best practices in nonprofit administration.\n\nNotable NAMM Moments\n\nOn Tuesday, January 14, a legion of music industry leaders gathered at Horace Mann Elementary School to help students learn to play melodica, ukulele, guitar, and drums, as well as engage in choral and movement sessions as part of the organization's Day of Service. Now in its sixth year, the day puts \"advocacy into action\" with support for the Anaheim Elementary School District and its efforts to provide music education to every child.\n\nThe day began with a welcome from Principal Louie Magdaleno, followed by Superintendent Downing, Mayor Harry Sidhu, a representative from the office of California State Senator Ling Ling Chang and Chair of The NAMM Foundation, Joel Menchey, followed by a special performance from the Kindergarten class and then, YouTube sensations, Melodica Men who performed a melody of well-loved hits on melodicas.\n\nSuperintendent Dr. Christopher Downing shared that, \"Since 2015, NAMM has generously brought together a group of dedicated musicians who volunteer in Anaheim Elementary School District as part of the Day of Service. It's incredible to witness the magic that music education brings. It provides a creative language that will not only expand your world but will help you more deeply understand it. To say that music has been transformative for the district is an understatement. I'm proud to say we're the only district in the United States where [students] learn how to play up to six different instruments. Isn't that incredible?!\"\n\nMarcia Neel of Yamaha shared that, \"Day of Service is an opportunity to see kids making music, which is what we're all about at The NAMM Foundation. The more kids who become music makers, the better it is for the whole world. To see it in practice warms my heart.\"\n\n\"Day of Service really sets the tone for the NAMM Show,\" offered Tiffany Stalker of Korg. \"Spending the day with these kids, seeing the joy that we can bring to them through music, really solidifies why we do what we do. This is the future… and the more that we can introduce music to students everywhere, the better we'll be served in the future. It's just a great day.\"\n\nEach evening of the Show came alive on the Yamaha Grand Plaza stage with plenty of star power. At Thursday's NAMM Foundation Celebration for Music Education, internationally beloved prog-rockers Animals as Leaders packed the Grand Plaza; Friday's Yamaha All-Star Concert on the Grand featured the likes of Mr. Talkbox, Kenny Loggins and Earth, Wind & Fire, among others; and Saturday's Tower of Power 50th Anniversary Concert, which celebrated a half-century of inspiring musical achievement from dynamic soul/funk/R&B ensemble Tower of Power as they treated NAMM attendees to a retrospective of decades of groundbreaking music.\n\nAlso on Saturday, The Grand Rally for Music Education convened music education advocates for a celebration of the benefits and pleasures of music education. The morning celebration welcomed ten-time Grammy winner Bobby McFerrin and Gimme5 for a special performance. McFerrin, who became a household name with his earworm hit, \"Don't Worry, Be Happy,\" has a rich history as an instrumentalist and bandleader. \"I try not to 'perform onstage,\" said McFerrin. \"I try to sing the way I sing in my kitchen because I just can't help myself. I want audiences to leave the theatre and sing in their own kitchens the next morning. I want to bring audiences into the incredible feeling of joy and freedom I get when I sing.\" Along with McFerrin, the Grand Rally for Music Education also featured a preshow performance by The Langley Ukulele Ensemble and The Legacy Ukulele Ensemble and winners of the A Cappella at NAMM contest.\n\nOther special performances included the Roomful of Pianos; a concept which saw pianists from around the country performing symphonic arrangements, jazz explorations, and clangorous delights for 30 players with the music of Frans Liszt, Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2, and Freddie Mercury/Queen, Bohemian Rhapsody; the IMSTA Songwriting Competition at NAMM (ISCAN) which gave college-level aspiring studio pros a chance to have their music heard and A Cappella at NAMM: the performance contest of three college- or university-level a cappella groups, as selected by professional vocalists Amy Engelhardt, India Carney, Jeff Smith, VJ Rosales, and Rob Dietz.\n\nHonoring the Industry's Leaders and Luminaries\n\nFriday evening welcomed the eighth annual She Rocks Awards at the House of Blues honoring women in the music industry. The event featured a star-studded performance lineup, including live music from honorees Gloria Gaynor, Lzzy Hale, Linda Perry, Suzi Quatro, Beatie Wolfe, and Tal Wilkenfeld, the evening's co-hosts, Mindi Abair and Lyndsey Parker, and opening act D_Drive, among others. Other honorees included Suzanne D'Addario Brouder, Executive Director of the D'Addario Foundation; Tara Low, Music-based entrepreneur and editor and founder of Guitar Girl Magazine; Myrna Sislen, Owner of Middle C Music in D.C.D.C., classical guitarist, philanthropist, music educator; Judy Schaefer, Marketing Director at PRS Guitars; and Ebonie Smith, Founder and President of Gender Amplified, Inc, and Atlantic Records audio engineer and producer.\n\nFriday also saw the return of the Parnelli Awards to The NAMM Show. The Parnelli's recognize the pioneering, influential professionals and companies for their contributions to the live production industry. The event brought together the live entertainment community in a vibrant annual gathering to recognize the best-in-class across 22 different categories, with Karrie Keyes (Pearl Jam monitor engineer, Founder of Sound Girls) receiving the Parnelli Audio Innovator Award, Mark \"Springo\" Spring (Production Manager, Paul McCartney, and others) receiving the Parnelli Lifetime Achievement Honor; and Michael Strickland (Bandit Lites) the Visionary Award, which was presented by one of his first early clients, Garth Brooks. The top-selling country artist came to honor Strickland, who believed in Brooks when, as Strickland says, \"he was a kid with a marketing degree and a couple of minor hits\" — and huge ambitions. Brooks came to Bandit and said he wanted a lighting rig as big as KISS. The team at Bandit made it happen, raising the production bar for all country music.\n\n\"If there was any doubt that being part of NAMM was a good move, it is unequivocally removed now,\" says Terry Lowe, PLSN/FOH Magazine publisher and executive producer of the Parnelli Awards. \"We've sold out shows before, but the demand was such now we had to add tables for 200 more and turned around and sold out again.\" He added that being able to attract top talent has also been a boost. \"With John Waite as host and Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard, drummer Carmine Appice (Rod Stewart, Ozzy Osborne), and Brent Smith (Shinedown) presenting, the show shattered all expectations. Being at this 'crossroad' of artists, people, technology, and the creative infusion of the young people entering is not only extremely good for the Parnelli Awards but rewarding.\"\n\nLater in the week on Saturday, the 35th Annual TEC Awards recognized 31 categories of products and projects in the areas of Technical or Creative Achievement, and the individuals, companies and technical innovations used in sound recordings, films, broadcast television, and video games. View the complete list of winners and nominees here.\n\nAt the TEC Awards, Joni Mitchell was recognized with the Les Paul Innovation Award, an honor which is given to individuals that have set the highest standards of excellence in the creative application of recording technology in the spirit of the famed audio pioneer, inventor, and musician, Les Paul. Of the award, Michael Braunstein, Executive Director of the Les Paul Foundation, offered \"Like Les, she has been a trailblazer and a true renaissance woman – a songwriter, musician, producer, and influencer who made her mark with very influential songs in the 60s. She has pushed the boundaries of what it means to be a female singer-songwriter over the course of her four-decade career, and like Les Paul, she's never been scared to take creative risks. We are thrilled that Joni Mitchell will join the list of extraordinary recipients that represent the spirit of the legendary Les Paul.\"\n\nMitchell was introduced by the legendary Herbie Hancock, who spoke fondly of their decades of friendship, creative collaboration, and impact: \"it's hard to imagine a world without this courageous woman's brave songs and records.\"\n\nMitchell remarked that she was \"truly honored,\" as several artists took the stage to give the folk songwriting heroine a musical celebration worthy of her long and revered career. The repertoire included Suzanne Santo for \"The River;\" Kevin Ross for \"A Case of You;\" Weyes Blood for \"Woodstock;\" and Venice performing \"Free Man in Paris.\" The Les Paul Innovation Award has been presented annually to remarkably-distinguished individuals from the music industry, such as Jackson Browne, Joe Perry (Aerosmith), Paul McCartney, Neil Young, and 2019's recipient, Peter Frampton.\n\nEarlier in the evening, recording engineer Dave Pensado and record industry veteran Herb Trawick, the creative duo behind the weekly web series Pensado's Place, were named recipients of the 2020 TEC Hall of Fame award. Both were honored for successful and impactful careers in the music industry, as well as long-standing efforts to share their knowledge through their global online show. The duo has also engaged in tireless mentoring opportunities and teaching tomorrow's audiologists, producers and musicians. The announcement was made from the stage by Maureen Droney, Sr. Managing Director for the Recording Academy® Producers & Engineers Wing®. \"I've always felt like the next best thing to music is to talk about it,\" said Pensado. Trawick noted, \"I thank the sponsors, guests, legends, artists, streamers, tech companies. We've had a very lucky career and worked very hard at it.\" Trawick also thanked their peers in the audience \"because of all of your gifts, tools, talents, abilities.\" Pensado's Place reaches an audience of over six million per year, and with the induction, the duo join luminaries Leslie Ann Jones, Rose Mann Cherney, Skunk Baxter, Hal Blaine, Jack Douglas, Nathan East, Geoff Emerick, and others with her induction, the industry's highest honor for pioneers of audio technology and the music industry's most accomplished producers and audio technicians.\n\nThe TEC Awards ceremony kicked off with a Don Wilson Tribute performance and a medley of Ventures tunes that warmed up the crowd before guitarist \"Skunk\" Baxter presented Wilson with a Music for Life Award, saying \"You gave us a great gift that keeps on giving!\" Billy Bob Thornton added a special video greeting calling his in-studio time with Wilson one of the \"greatest honors of my life.\"\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe industry reconvenes at Summer NAMM 2020, July 9-11, in Nashville, TN, and at The 2021 NAMM Show January 21-24 in Anaheim, California."
