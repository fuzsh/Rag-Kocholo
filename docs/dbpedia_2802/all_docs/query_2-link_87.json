        "text": "Foreigners must follow the Czech rules if they are staying for longer than 90 days, which means:\n\nEvery child of preschool age must attend kindergarten for at least 1 year.\n\nEvery child older than 6 years old must attend school – it might be a Czech school or a private one (you will have to pay school fees). You also need to make sure that a private school is accredited by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic. If not, it is the parent’s duty to register the pupil for an individual education plan in the accredited school. Usually, non-accredited schools have agreements with accredited schools, on the basis of which children are tested, for example, once every six months.\n\nChildren start with preschool education usually at the age of 3 at the Kindergarten (školka) and continue to the Primary School (= základní škola, ZŠ), it starts at the age of 6. Then the pupils can proceed to the Secondary Education, afterwards there is a choice of the Tertiary or University education, and also there are Post-graduate Education Programmes.\n\nThere are various choices of schooling approaches and some schools specialise: there are bilingual schools, Montessori and Waldorf schools, and schools specialising in sports, science or languages. The choice is wide. Private schools are usually paid.\n\nApart from the mainstream system there are also educational facilities for children with special educational needs due to their physical and/or mental disabilities. Lately, integrating children with special needs has become the main approach and pedagogic assistants are available to integrate children with special needs. Not knowing the language of schooling can also be considered a special need and if this is the case for your child please contact us to discuss the procedures.\n\nThe assessment and grading system used in the Czech Schools consists of a scale from 1 (best) to 5 (worst) that is used to evaluate the students’ work. School Reports/Certificates (summary assessment) give grades for each school subject halfway through and at the end of the school year.\n\nA detailed description of the education system in the Czech Republic can be found here.\n\nWhen the whole family is moving to a different country, one of the main struggles to be faced is a language barrier. No or inadequate knowledge of local language is a significant barrier also for children when entering the education system. Multiple means of support provided by public organizations (like the National Pedagogical Institute or regional authorities) can be used to integrate an expat child to the group of local peers.\n\nOne hour of Czech language per week is provided free of charge to children attending kindergarten.\n\nA very similar situation concerns children in primary and secondary schools. Every pupil can get an adaptation coordinator for the first 4 weeks in a Czech school. The coordinator helps to overcome the language barrier (translation, interpretation) and helps with the cultural barrier and inclusion into the class group. To obtain an adaptation coordinator, a child’s legal representative must request this service during the first 5 days of school at the regional office of the National Pedagogical Institute (contacts here).\n\nEvery expat pupil/student who meets the statutory requirement for compulsory school attendance can attend free Czech language courses (in the range of 100 or 200 hours) in one of designated regional schools. You can find a list of schools designated for special courses for pupils with a mother tongue other than Czech here. In order for the pupil to be included in the special Czech language courses, a parent (or legal representative) must fill in an official application (download the application here).\n\nThe Moravian-Silesian Region also currently supports students in the 8th and 9th grade of primary schools and all secondary schools by organizing language courses during the school year (September – June) and in the summer. Regular (also online) courses during the school year are organized twice a week in 15 schools in the region. The summer course is more intensive – students attend the course 5 days a week. These two language courses are running from September 2021 to August 2023 under the auspices of the project Celé česko čte dětem (Every Czech Reads to Kids). For more information you can contact coordinators of this project directly:\n\ne-mail: [email protected]\n\nphone: + 420 774 317 256\n\nIf you plan to stay with your family for more than just a year or two, it is worth considering sending your child or children to Czech state schools and let them learn the language (Czech). Children can manage that in an easier way than adults just by natural language acquisition. After a silent period they emerge as naturally bilingual. The big advantage is that then they can attend Czech schools including universities free of charge. Children can have various reliefs and special support during the transformation period when they are still learning Czech. Bilingual schools come in especially handy because they offer a combination of two languages (e.g. an English or Spanish focus). If you are planning your stay for a shorter time, for months or for only a few years, then the choice usually falls to one of the private international schools where the tuition language is English. They have a very high level, cover a wide age range, and some also offer IB as a school leaving exam. They charge tuition fees.\n\nChildren must visit preschool education for one year before they begin compulsory Primary School. Preschool enrollment is guaranteed for children in their last year before entering elementary school, but they often attend as early as 2 years of age. Preschool institutions are intended to encourage early learning habits and facilitate social contact among peers, both of which are instrumental for a child’s smooth transition to elementary school. In cooperation with parents and teachers, children learn to think logically, train their memory and exercise their imagination.\n\nKindergarten admission (see video about admission here)\n\nThe number of kindergartens is currently insufficient, which means that not all applying children may be admitted into a kindergarten. In compliance with the Act on the Protection of Public Health, kindergartens and other preschool facilities can only enroll children who have been vaccinated.\n\nThe admission procedure usually takes place between January and May; the school year starts in September. Parents or guardians need to present their personal documents and most Kindergartens also require a medical check and a Birth certificate. Kindergarten enrolment is also possible at any time during the school year unless the Kindergarten’s capacity is filled (children approaching 5 years of age have to already enroll in spring preceding the September when they start compulsory attendance). In Ostrava there are a number of Preschool Education facilities offering bilingual education or education in English (education in Czech is free, in other languages it is a paid service).\n\nPORG International Kindergarten\n\n[email protected]\n\nwww.porg.cz\n\nRostislavova 1, 703 00 Ostrava-Vítkovice\n\nPRIGO Penguin's Kindergarten\n\n[email protected]\n\nwww.ms-prigo.cz\n\nStřelniční 6/2, 702 00 Moravská Ostrava\n\nEarly Years Centre\n\nThe Ostrava International School\n\n[email protected]\n\nwww.tois.world\n\nPRZEDSZKOLE\n\nz polskim językiem nauczania\n\n+420 703 481 750\n\n[email protected]\n\nwww.psplutynia.cz\n\nKoperníkova 652, 735 53 Dolní Lutyně\n\nMonty School Ostrava\n\n[email protected]\n\nwww.montyskola.cz\n\nŠpanielova 6227/3, 708 00 Ostrava-Poruba\n\nHELLO Kindergarten\n\n[email protected]\n\nwww.helloteddy.cz\n\nČs. exilu 491/23, 708 00 Ostrava-Poruba\n\n1ˢᵗ Baby Club\n\nBilingual children's group\n\n+420 773 790 990\n\n[email protected]\n\n1stbaby.cz\n\nSadová 41, Moravská Ostrava\n\nChildren aged 6–15 usually attend Primary Schools (Základní škola, ZŠ). Primary schools have two levels; the first comprises of five grades, the second of four grades. A small percentage of children leave after the first level to continue their education at an eight-year secondary school (most probably a “Gymnásium”, a Grammar school aimed at preparing the children for University). By attending Primary Schools children also fulfil the statutory requirement for compulsory school attendance, which takes nine years.\n\nPrimary School admission\n\nPrimary schools admit children who have reached the age of six before 1 September of the respective year. Admission procedures take place in April; the specific date is determined by each school individually. Parents, along with their children who have reached six years of age by 31 August, come to the admission procedure. They need to present their children’s personal documentation and also the documentation related to them as parents.\n\nThe Ostrava International School\n\n[email protected]\n\nwww.tois.world\n\nGregorova 3, 702 00 Ostrava\n\nHELLO Primary School\n\n[email protected]\n\nwww.helloskola.cz\n\nČs. exilu 491/23, 708 00 Ostrava-Poruba\n\nZŠ Ostrčilova Bilingual School\n\n[email protected]\n\nwww.zsostrcilova.cz\n\nOstrčilova 10/2557, 702 00 Ostrava\n\nPRIGO Elementary School\n\n[email protected]\n\nwww.prigo.cz\n\nMojmírovců 42, 709 00 Ostrava-Mariánské Hory\n\nPORG International School\n\n[email protected]\n\nwww.porginternationalschool.com\n\nRostislavova 1, 703 00 Ostrava-Vítkovice\n\nSZKOŁA\n\nz polskim językiem nauczania\n\n+420 703 481 750\n\n[email protected]\n\nwww.psplutynia.cz\n\nKoperníkova 652, 735 53 Dolní Lutyně"
