The complex network theory, being one of new research tools, opens new perspectives on syntax properties of the language. Despite numerous partial achievements, some fundamental problems remain unsolved. Specifically, although statistical properties typical for complex networks can be observed in all syntactic networks, the impact of syntax itself on these properties is still unclear. The aim of the present study is to shed more light on the role of syntax in the syntactic network structure. In particular, we concentrate on the impact of the syntactic function of a verb in the sentence on the complex network structure. Verbs play the decisive role in the sentence structure (\"local\" importance). From this fact we hypothesize the importance of verbs in the complex network (\"global\" importance). The importance of verb in the complex network is assessed by the number of links which are directed from the node representing verb to other nodes in the network. Six languages (Catalan, Czech, Dutch, Hungarian, Italian, Portuguese) were used for testing the hypothesis.\n\nHistorical semantics is a discipline which, due to its methodological diversity and its straddling of the divide between history and linguistics, remains somewhat in the shadow of more established, traditional fields of linguistic and... more\n\nHistorical semantics is a discipline which, due to its methodological diversity and its straddling of the divide between history and linguistics, remains somewhat in the shadow of more established, traditional fields of linguistic and historical research such as diachronic lexicology and word-formation or historical textology and the historiographic interpretation of sources.\n\nIn its traditional form, represented by Josef Macek’s seminal work Historická sémantika [Historical Semantics, published 1991] and the work of his colleagues and disciples, historical semantics focuses primarily on changes in the meaning of words or word-groups. However, our goal – and the goal of this monograph – lies elsewhere. It is not our aim to provide a systematic description of what historical semantics is, how it developed, or what methods it uses. Nor do we draw directly on the work of Czech linguists working within the field of historical semantics – though we are fully aware of this tradition and of their current work in the field. Instead, our goal is to present new methodological approaches – differing from more traditional methods – which, in our opinion, are suitable for the historical-semantic analysis of language. Our presentation of various topics and surveys of a markedly heuristic nature is solely intended to indicate potential avenues of research and approaches to language, text and semantics in their historical context. We are concerned with seeking new paths not only in historical semantics, but also in textology; we have attempted to demonstrate ways of integrating these fields and bridging the gaps between disciplines. We also focus on the suitability (or unsuitability) of the methods used; we fully acknowledge their limitations.\n\nOur ‘non-traditional’ approach to the historical-semantic analysis of language applies a wide variety of methods, from the systematic tracing of the context and collocation of the analyzed lexical items, through the use of corpora consisting of texts delineated on the basis of both genre and date, to the application of quantitative linguistic methods. In this monograph, quantitative methodologies are represented by the analysis of thematic concentration, the measurement of similarity/difference in the choice of thematic words, the tracing of their associations, the determination of key words, and frequency analysis. Many of the research methods applied here are relatively new, representing somewhat pioneering approaches to linguistic text analysis (and even to literary and literary-historical text analysis). In view of this approach, it is understandable that the smaller-scale studies published as part of this grant-funded research project provoked lively debate and polemical discussions (including some uncompromisingly negative responses); the reviewers of this monograph gave a similar response.\n\nThe broad methodological variety of this monograph Slovo a text v historickém kontextu – perspektivy historickosémantické analýzy jazyka [entitled Word and Text in the Historical Context – Perspectives on the Historical-Semantic Analysis of Language] is mirrored by its broad variety of themes. This variety is also a result of the varying research specializations of the individual members of the authorial team, which encompasses specialists in quantitative linguistics, onomastics, literary history, social history, and lexicology (with a focus on sociolects). The linguistic material analyzed is likewise widely varied. The monograph presents some analyses of selected Old Czech texts, though its main focus is on the 19th and 20th centuries. Using not only literary texts, but also modern ‘engaged’ journalistic writings, political slogans, toponyms and prison slang, the authors demonstrate a range of potential methods of analysis and their application.\n\nThe aim of the article is to introduce a new approach to verb valency analysis. This approach – full valency – observes properties of verbs which occur solely in actual language usage.

This\n\napproach – full valency – observes properties of verbs which occur solely in actual\n\nlanguage usage. The term ‘‘full valency’’ means that all arguments, without distinguishing\n\ncomplements (obligatory arguments governed by the verb) and adjuncts (optional\n\narguments directly dependent on the predicate verb), are taken into account. Because of\n\nan expectation that full valency reflects some mechanism which governs verb behaviour in\n\na language, hypotheses concerning (1) the distribution of full valency frames, (2) the\n\nrelationship between the number of valency frames and the frequency of the verb, and (3)\n\nthe relationship between the number of valency frames and verb length were tested\n\nempirically. To test the hypotheses, a Czech syntactically annotated corpus – the Prague\n\nDependency Treebank – was used.\n\nThe thesis deals with socio-onomastic aspects of toponymy.

The main focus is knowledge\n\nand usage of non-standardized toponymy in six different Moravian and Silesian areas. The\n\naim of our research was to find out how various characteristics of inhabitants and their\n\nrelationship to the area affect their knowledge and usage of toponymy (toponymic\n\ncompetence). The influence of the area was also taken into consideration. The research was\n\nconducted in the years 2014–2017. Non-standardized place names were collected and\n\nrandomly selected twenty of them were put in socio-onomastic questionnaire tested\n\ntoponymic competence in each area. Respondents were also asked about their social\n\ncharacteristics opinions, attitudes, emotional aspects and their relationship to the area. All\n\ntogether it was a collection of over 400 non-standardized place names and 232\n\nquestionnaires. The data was statistically tested by Wilcoxon test and Kruskal-Wallis test.\n\nIt was found that knowledge and usage of toponymy depend on age and gender of\n\nrespondents while level of education has no influence. The length of stay in the area partly\n\naffects toponymic competence but more important is the type of stay (childhood, tourist,\n\nresident). Other aspects influencing toponymic competence are: knowledge of the area,\n\ninterest in community life, knowledge of dialect, attitude to renaming, attitude to\n\nonomastic research, considering the area as a home. Knowledge and usage of toponymy is\n\nalso affected by social-economical character of the area. Relationship between toponymic\n\ncompetence and historical-demographic development was not fully confirmed.\n\nExonyms – i.e. toponyms of the type Rakousko, Benátky (‘Austria’, ‘Venice’) – were introduced to the Czech landscape (along with foreign endonyms) in medieval times.

During the 19th century, a new, specific application of foreign place names began to appear, and this development forms the focus of the present article. Such words began to feature in attributive structures of the type český, pražský (‘Czech’ or ‘Bohemian’, ‘Prague’s’) + exonym / foreign endonym; many of these structures came into widespread use referring to areas whose boundaries were not clearly delineated or defined, or they served the purposes of marketing and advertising. In the 1990s, the growing influence of a “new” European regionalism and the formation of new territorial entities was accompanied by a revival of some old regional identities – and, in turn, by the revival of their names. Attributive structures with foreign place names thus began to re-appear in toponymy, and also in advertising or journalism. The analysis presented in this article is based on the SYN PUB component of the Czech National Corpus, and it focuses on the collocations of the lemmas český/moravský/slezský (‘Czech’ or ‘Bohemian’/‘Moravian’/‘Silesian’) + exonym / foreign endonym, aiming to offer insight into the reasons underlying the use of such structures in contemporary journalism."
