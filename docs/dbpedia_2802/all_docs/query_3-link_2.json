        "text": "The philological departments of the Faculty of Arts of the University of Ostrava organize an annual national studentsâ€™ translation contest followed by a conference and translation workshops on the so-called Day with Translation. The contest is always advertised at the beginning of the winter term, the translations are to be submitted till the end of January, and the winners are honourably mentioned on the Day with Translation in March. The contestants can translate fiction or academic texts from English, French, Spanish, Russian, Polish, and , since 2011 , Latin or from other languages. From 2005 till 2011, 800 students from 10 universities had taken part in the contest and the conference had welcomed 20 guests out of translatologists, philologists, translators, and interpreters from Czech and Slovak universities. The first six years had been documented in Translatologica Ostravensia with the conference speeches, the list of contestants, and excerpts from the best translations. The next reports are to bring the acknowledged translations in full. The project received the NAEP European Language Prize LABEL in 2009."
