One of the European Union’s key educational objectives is the provision of equal opportunities for all with regard to access to learning and knowledge, regardless of gender, financial and physical ability, and place of residence. That is why, distance learning has now been granted a status of high priority. If introduced on a wide scale, distance learning and teaching may make significant contribution towards the achievement of educational goals in member states.\n\nThe Faculty of Ethnology and Sciences of Education (since 2019 The Faculty of Arts and Educational Sciences) at the University of Silesia, Poland has extensive experience in the implementation of distance learning in other departments across the university. The Faculty’s Distance Learning Platform operates smoothly and continues to expand as well as the international scientific conference Theoretical and Practical Aspects of Distance Learning (www.dlcc.us.edu.pl) is designed to bring together all those involved in e-learning – university students, faculty staff, and educators – to explore and share experiences with e-learning and distance learning, both at home and abroad.

One of the European Union’s key educational objectives is the provision of equal opportunities for all with regard to access to learning and knowledge, regardless of gender, financial and physical ability, and place of residence. That is why, distance learning has now been granted a status of high priority. If introduced on a wide scale, distance learning and teaching may make significant contribution towards the achievement of educational goals in member states.\n\nThe Faculty of Ethnology and Sciences of Education (since 2019 The Faculty of Arts and Educational Sciences) at the University of Silesia, Poland has extensive experience in the implementation of distance learning in other departments across the university.

And because among authors of the papers of International Journal of Elearning will be authors in particular from West, Central as well as East Europe and Australia. We also kindly invite authors from different countries and continents for cooperation. Given the dynamic development of e-learning, special care will be placed that research results should be published efficiently. The acceleration of the process will be provided by streamlining publication through Open Journal System (www.journals.us.edu.pl). Journal content is disseminated through indexing in databases such as ICI Journals Master List – Index Copernicus, Erich Plus, DOAJ, EBSCO, MIAR, and others.\n\nThe topics of the IJREL includes:\n\n1) E-learning and Intercultural Competences Development in Different Countries\n\nLegal, social aspects of distance learning in different countries;\n\nPsychological and ethical aspects of distance learning in different countries;\n\nTeacher-student and student-student relationships in distance learning;\n\n2) Theoretical, methodological and practical aspects of distance learning:\n\nTheoretical and methodological aspects of distance learning;\n\nSuccessful examples of e-learning;\n\nDistance learning of humanities: native and foreign language, philosophy, history, ect.;\n\nDistance learning of science and mathematics;\n\nQuality of teaching, training programs and аssessment\n\nE-learning for the disabled;\n\n3) Distance learning and lifelong learning:\n\nComputer training, for prospective and actual teachers, in distance learning;\n\nLifelong learning supported by distance learning;\n\nPersonnel, scientific, information and library services.\n\n4) E-learning in the Development of the Key Competences\n\nKey competences in the knowledge society;\n\nUse of e-learning in improving the level of the students’ key competences;\n\nTeachers’ and learners’ competences in distance learning and computer science;\n\n5) Multimedia in distance learning:\n\nMultimedia means in distance learning;\n\nMultimedia tools in distance learning;\n\nMultimedia resources and didactic materials;\n\nVideo-tutorial design.\n\n6) Other alternative methods, forms and techniques in distance learning:\n\nsimulations, models in distance learning;\n\ncollaboration work in distance learning;\n\ndistance learning systems;\n\nm-learning.\n\n7) E-learning in Covid-19 pandemic time"
