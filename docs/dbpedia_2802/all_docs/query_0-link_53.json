It is effective in at least three dimensions: inner/cognitive, outward/appropriative, and collective/identitarian. The inner dimension refers to the fact that our perception of landscape and our spatial cognition are determined to a large extent by linguistic terms and grammatical structures specific to our language. The outward dimension refers to the capacity of language to project linguistically- and culturally-determined understandings into the physical world and create and appropriate places and landscapes by the act of naming. Finally, the collective dimension points to the importance of the linguistic delimitation of landscapes and their association with group identities. The article summarizes crucial recent findings in all three aforementioned dimensions and suggests possibilities for further research.\n\nKeywords\n\nlanguage, landscape, place, linguistic relativity, identity, linguistic landscape\n\nArticle Text\n\nReferences"
