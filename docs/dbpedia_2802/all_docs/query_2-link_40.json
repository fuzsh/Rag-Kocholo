        "text": "Discovering at TOIS\n\n“At TOIS I am discovering new skills I didn’t know about or I didn’t use.”\n\n“Discovering at TOIS for me means learning new things, coming up with new ideas and projects, discovering new cultures, and people from all over the world! I really enjoy it!”\n\n“I discover everything new. New relationships, education, thoughts of people, and seeing the world from another person’s eye.”\n\nConnecting at TOIS\n\n“Connecting is the next stage of discovery. We speak with our friends and classmates to gather information. We can learn new things and build a big understanding of the topic. We also make connections between different subjects to build a main idea of the topic.”\n\n“Connecting is when two or more people come and help, share or want to change something together.”\n\n“I think that TOIS wants us to connect with other people or nationalities so we never discriminate against people or make people feel sad because they are different.”\n\n“Connecting at TOIS for me means listening to others and making our new ideas getting inspired by them. Connecting the future, past and present.”\n\nAchieving at TOIS\n\n“For me, achieving at TOIS means completing projects, growing, getting ideas, and accomplishing them. Reaching our dream goals, learning new things, and understanding it bit by bit until we completely understand it.”\n\n“Achieving is accomplishing big and small goals we promise to ourselves. We say to us we want something, and TOIS helps us find the key to the door.”\n\n“Achieving at TOIS means connecting our work with real life.”\n\nThe Ostrava International School strives to ensure the welfare and safety of all its students and attempts to create an environment in which the students feel safe and secure. At times, this may involve addressing issues that take place outside of the school building itself.\n\nThe health, safety and well-being of all our students are of paramount importance to the entire school staff. Students have the right to protection, regardless of age, gender, race, culture or disability. They have the right to be safe in school.\n\nAbuse and neglect can result in underachievement. The school strives to ensure that all students make good educational progress.\n\nChild Protection Coordination at TOIS\n\nEach member of staff is responsible for being aware of any changes in a student’s appearance, behavior, or psychological state, which may be related to a suspicion of child abuse, and to report this to the Head of School who proceed further in accordance with the TOIS Child Protection Policy.\n\nIt is highly important for TOIS to keep its community educated on the subject of Child Protection. TOIS organizes regular annual workshops for staff, students and parents to ensure that all members of the TOIS community feel safe, accepted and listened to.\n\nA deep understanding of how learners learn is what leads to high quality teaching.\n\nOur fundamental belief is that regardless of age or background, each member of our community has the ability to develop through engaging and meaningful learning journeys.\n\nOur pedagogical practice is drawn from traditional and modern evidence-based principles of learning. Curricular frameworks from the Early Years Centre to the Diploma Programme are designed to be age-appropriate and to lead learners through evermore challenging cycles of personal discovery, connection, and achievement.\n\nTOIS Principles of Learning and Teaching:\n\nLearning is a personal, lifelong journey.\n\nLearners learn best in an environment of safety, respect, and belonging that nurtures free and open expression.\n\nA learner’s own sense of curiosity is the strongest driving force for developing independent thinking and a passion for learning.\n\nLearning may take place in collaborative settings of large or small groups, one-on-one, or alone.\n\nPurposeful learning can take place at strongly differentiated levels of complexity.\n\nDeep learning is achieved when learners can solve meaningful problems, transfer knowledge across subject areas, and extend beyond a given curriculum.\n\nMaking mistakes, and having the ability to recognise those mistakes, is a key part of learning.\n\nLearning progresses more effectively with meaningful feedback and opportunity for reflection.\n\nLearning can be seriously disrupted by cognitive or sensory overload.\n\nThe Ostrava International School believes that Intercultural Learning begins with a respect for our community’s varied international backgrounds.\n\nEmbedded into our curriculum and guiding statements is the commitment to guide our learners to discover the great diversity of the world, and to connect with those whose personal, linguistic and cultural backgrounds differ from their own.\n\nWe nurture student autonomy to ethically address issues of local and global importance, and the well-being of our common humanity.\n\nWe believe that even our youngest learners can begin the process of taking their place as Global Citizens, interested in sustainable development, and taking action to make the world a better place.\n\nOne World. Our School.\n\nAt The Ostrava International School, Digital Citizenship is defined as the responsible, secure and harmless use of technology in order to conduct online interaction with other individuals or communities using a variety of platforms. It is the ability to apply critical thinking in the digital world, evaluate information, respect intellectual property, be aware of the digital traits we leave behind and their consequences as well as the ability to find balance between online and offline aspects of life."
