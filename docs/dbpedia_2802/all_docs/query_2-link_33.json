        "text": "Doctoral study program Chemical metallurgy is a modern scientifically oriented, multidisciplinary, and interdisciplinary research program. The study is mainly oriented on the chemical aspects of preparation, extraction, and recycling of metallic materials and the characterization of these materials. Furthermore, the study program is focused on the study of other inorganic materials in the solid and liquid phases.\n\nThe processes of metals extracting from primary and secondary raw materials, the study of ferrous and non-ferrous alloys, and also ecological aspects of metallurgical production impact on the environment are studied. The doctoral study program is focused on aspects of industrial technologies arising mainly from a chemical-physical basis and on the properties study of inorganic materials for broad application areas. This study program brings up top-quality specialists with creative inventiveness and with use in the labor market in scientific, research, development, managing, and production spheres in the given and related branches.\n\nKey Facts\n\nFaculty: Faculty of Materials Science and Technology\n\nType of Study: Doctoral\n\nLanguage of instruction: English\n\nCode of the program: P0715D130002\n\nTitle of the program: Chemical Metallurgy\n\nThe regular period of the study: 4 years\n\nCost: 500 CZK per semester\n\nCoordinating department: Department of Chemistry and Physico-Chemical Processes\n\nCoordinator: prof.
