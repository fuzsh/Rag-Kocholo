        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nIn Europe, many national languages are used, however, very often engineers use their own slang, which is quite well understandable to them, regardless of their nationality. It has been noticed, that technical tutorials, brochures or other documents which are written in technical English can by understood by people, who have only basic knowledge of English. The goal of that CEEPUS Network titled \"Engineering as Communication Language in Europe\" is to create communication and cooperation between engineers, dealing with various engineering branches. The aim of the Network is to be able to create Interdisciplinary Engineering Teams. A strong background in engineering techniques applicable to a wide variety of complex problems is in demand in the widespread knowledge. Our engineers should understand more than one discipline and be prepared to work at the intersection of two or more engineering and science disciplines. Nowadays research and industry sectors have high requirements towards engineers. Often a single engineer is not able to solve complicated interdisciplinary problems, but there is a great possibility that Interdisciplinary Engineering Teams would make it better and faster.\n\nThe main task of that Network is involving teachers from partner Institutions in order to create team projects that would be main parts of the program. It is also expected that students will take an active part in all didactic activities proposed by Network and will benefit from our Program, as much as possible. Thanks to engineering knowledge as well as soft skills (ability to work in an international team), all the students in their further career will be able to communicate freely and work in international companies as well as continue their education, e.g. doctoral studies in any university in the world.\n\nThe CEEPUS Network \"Engineering as Communication Language in Europe” gives the opportunity to create successful cooperation, not only between students, but also between teachers from all the universities, which are participants in the network PL-701. Additionally, the Network is open for any open-minded people, who can participate in events organized by that network with using the Freemover Mobilities. Teacher and student mobilities within this network enables learning and research experiences exchange within related fields, help to build interpersonal connections, broaden professional horizons and may give the opportunity to develop the curriculas. Therefore, the knowledge exchanged between the partner Institutions will give a good possibility for the further development of the Universities as well as for increasing education standards. This network would also stimulate further topic-oriented engagement and provide the basis for such kind of work. It must be emphasised, that the Network gives all participants tangible benefits in the field of didactics (mainly bachelor and master students) as well as sciences (mainly PhD students and academic staff). All the Universities, which are participants in PL-701 Network have specialists from different fields of engineering. However, it has to be noted that most of interests should overlap, what is the main goal to effective cooperation. The partners from Faculties of Mechanical Engineering, Production Machines, Machine Building Technology, Mechatronics, Production Engineering and Automation are mostly oriented on mechanical (milling, grinding, polishing, burnishing) and electro-mechanical machining (electropolishing, electro discharge, precision wire and spark erosion, plasma electrolytic oxidation) as well as on widely understood shape and surface characterization (roughness, chemical composition, corrosion, nanoindentation, texture). On the other hand, there are Faculties of Agriculture, Forest, Environmental Sciences, which are focused mainly on biological aspects. The third group of Faculties includes Applied Physics, Education and Technical English. Nowadays, when most of problem in industry as well as in sciences is interdisciplinary, such as problems associated with biomaterials, solid fuels, renewable energy resources, etc., the cooperation of all three groups may be a guarantee of success. Therefore, the main mission of that Network is to support and to develop interdisciplinary cooperation in all fields of engineering in general.\n\nHISTORICAL OVERVIEW\n\nThe CEEPUS Network PL-701 entitled Engineering as Communication Language in Europe was established in 2012. Most of the participants in the Network met them-selves together under Freemover mobilities as well as on Skype meetings. On the basis of those activities, in 2012 the first summer school with the same name as PL-701 Network, i.e. titled Engineering as Communication Language in Europe took place. Some snapshots from that event are shown in Figure 1. The participants of Summer School were from Czech Republic, Slovakia, Moldova, Poland and Ukraine. During two weeks the students had a chance to listen to lectures and participate in lab work. The thematics of the lectures were in the field of mechanics and surfaces engineering and applied physics with some elements of experiment planning, mathematical statistics as well as ANSYS and MATLAB simulation. Additionally, there were prepared lectures and consultations on writing professional texts in English as well as classes in farming and forestry engineering. As part of the free time, for participants there were also organized gala dinner, city tour, trips to the seaside, fireplace, billiards, bowling, etc. After a formal activation of CEEPUS Network PL-701 it was possible to bring to life the assumed plans on interdisciplinary character of that Network. At the beginning, in that Network there were 27 participants from Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Moldova, Romania and Slovenia. The first visits were very important for understanding the didactic and scientific profiles of all the partners. Because of lack of time, it was not possible visiting all partners in one year. That is way, a lot of people had the possibility to meet them together midway, e.g. in Czech Republic and/or in Slovakia, to speak over the details regarding development of newly called into being, at that time, network. Additionally, the CEEPUS Excursions were prepared, what had a very significant impact on the development of the network. A short term visits with a group of over 25 persons, were always giving a very high impact on thinking of young people, in general, and their further life and their career.\n\nThe main goal of that event was to perform interdisciplinary seminar lectures, consultation and laboratory measurements. However, during the Workshop besides didactical activities, the VSB-TU Ostrava authorities organized and fully financed a visit into Planetarium and Geological Pavilion.\n\nAdditionally, the trips to companies, with which the University cooperate, such as Vitkovice Power Engineering and Advanced Metal Technologies, were prepared. The event allowed students a joint work in laboratories and listen to lectures on the following topics: Unconventional and Hydrojetting Technologies; Economical aspects of materials cutting by Hydrojetting Technologies; Introduction to FEM analysis (static problems, nonlinearity, contact problem); Topological optimization; modeling of elastic/visco– plastic strains in product’s surface layer after burnishing rolling process of real surface; problems of rebounding phenomena during burnishing rolling process; Original modifications of the small-size grinding wheels structure; Monitoring the internal cylindrical grinding processes; Advanced microscopy techniques in the diagnostics of abrasive tools; Using of the non-contact laser methods for automated in-process inspection of machined surfaces; Basics of polishing process; Abrasive polishing at low temperature; Surface Quality; Shape-friction safety clutch; Basics of solar collectors; Experiment planning and experimental data processing; Basics of corrosion measurements.\n\nTHE USE OF EXPERT KNOWLEDGE OF PARTNERS\n\nThe high number of partners in present CEEPUS Network allows to get support by expert knowledge of other partners. Therefore, there are reported such cases, where reviewers of students' thesis were professors from partner Universities. Such examples are: Assoc. Prof. Jan Valícek from VSB-TU Ostrava (CZ), who was formally a consultant of engineer thesis of Stanisław Trzeszczkowski and master theses of Grzegorz Solecki at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Koszalin University of Technology (PL); Assoc. Prof. Juraj Maga from SPU Nitra (SK), who was formally consultant of master thesis of Marta Kara at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Koszalin University of Technology (PL); Assoc. Prof. Jan Valícek (VSB-TU Ostrava, CZ) who was a reviewer of PhD thesis at SPU Nitra (SK); Assoc. Prof. Krzysztof Ro-kosz who was PhD thesis at Technical university in Zvolen (SK), SPU Nitra (SK), VSB-TU Ostrava (CZ) as well as consultant in Master thesis at Selye János University. Presented examples show the potential of that Network, what will be continued and developed. It is also planned to conduct joint doctoral dissertations with two pro-moters from two different countries.\n\nPROFESSIONAL VALUE\n\nUnder the PL-701 Network, joint reviewing of students’ thesis is done; then the works are very often published in the scientific journals. Now many doctoral students, mainly from VSB-TU Ostrava (Czech Republic) and TU Moldova (Moldo-va), get the opportunity to perform their 3D surface roughness measurements at the laboratories of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Koszalin University of Tech-nology (Poland). Also, BSc, MSc and PhD students from Koszalin, PL, performed a lot of measurements inter alia at VSB-TU Ostrava, CZ (surface characterization by confocal microscopy, nanoindentation, SEM, EDX, XRD), at SPU Nitra, SK, (solid fuels, biogas plants, combustion), at CZU Prague, CZ (forest harvesters, forest tech-nique), at BOKU, AT (forest protection, combustion, construction analysis).\n\nSumming up it should be emphasized that due to the mobility within the CEEPUS programme the quality of the engineering, master and doctoral thesis can be raised to a higher level. Also the opportunity appears to the teachers to review of the students' thesis, allowing for a better understanding of the lecturers and re-searchers who work with the youth at different universities. That greatly increases the possibility of taking further joint actions at all levels of the education. Important is also the fact that, based on the cooperation in the framework of PL-701 CEEPUS Network, many professional papers have been published in the reputable scientific journals. Most of them were developed by the doctoral students involved in the in-ternational CEEPUS cooperation in the laboratories at the Universities of Danube Region.\n\nScientific papers published in the years 2014-2016 on the basis of cooperation between partners of CEEPUS Network PL-701:\n\nKapłonek W., Nadolny K., Ungureanu N.: Shaping the surface texture of the ring-type test samples used for evaluation of the surface roughness by ARS method based on imaging and analysis of the scattered light.

Among other things, to the scientific results, the scientific publications of MSc and PhD students on the basis of performed measurements at host University's laboratory may be included. Additionally, the host professors are the consultants and reviewers of master and doctoral thesis. Many students and professors during their stays at host Universities under CEEPUS grants had the possibility to find scientific contacts, with a high im-pact on their carrier. Based on those contacts from the stay at SPU Nitra Monika Ster-czyńska M.Sc. Eng. (PhD student) received NCN national scientific grant titled ETIUDA. Another example is Małgorzata Smuga-Kogut, whose part of measure-ments to her PhD thesis was performed during her CEEPUS stays. On the basis of CEEPUS contacts, the Polish-Czech project No. 8071/2010: \"Measurement and anal-ysis of surface topography produced in the progressive processes, including thin cold-rolled sheets of classic materials and nanomaterials, and analysis of the strengthening mechanism\", was completed. In 2015 the Polish-Slovak project titled \"Development of low-emission solid fuels from biomass residues\", as well as in 2016 the Grant OPUS 11 of National Science Centre, Poland, with registration number 2016/21/B/ST8/01952, titled \"Development of models of new porous coatings obtained on titanium by Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation in electrolytes containing phosphoric acid with addition of calcium, magnesium, copper and zinc nitrates\" with CEEPUS partners were qualified for the funding. For many of staff the stays at host Universities under CEE-PUS helped to obtain the habilitation of the professor title. At the moment, a better understanding of all participants mutually allows for very efficient use of expert knowledge of individual teams from all universities being a part of CEEPUS Net-work PL-701.\n\nEDUCATIONAL VALUE\n\nAll the international experiences are very important concerning both the experienced lecturers/teachers as well as young people. Students and the university staff can get the access to a new knowledge and have a look at another innovative education methods going abroad. Of course, not everything can be directly copied to the reality of each country, however, many of the innovative methods can be adopted to the needs of each subject at the partner universities. The experience of many people, who are participants of that Network shows, that teaching in a foreign language pro-vides an impulse to create better lecturing, concerning both the native language as well as teaching in English at their home universities. The latest idea is to write joint students’ handbooks in English, which could be used in several partner universities. In addition, we are going to prepare laboratory set ups, which would complement themselves at partner universities, then students would have a possibility to go abroad for the whole year to a partner university. With that step, a stimulation of CEEPUS long-term mobilities could be achieved. It should be also mentioned that the International CEEPUS Workshops as well as group educational CEEPUS Excursions and Summer Schools have a significant impact on the education value of the PL-701 Network.\n\nPROGRAM VALUE\n\nThe PL-701 Network has a big impact on the promotion of Danube Region. In the network there are the Universities from Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Serbia, Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Poland. Within the network the CEEPUS Excursions, Workshops, Summer Schools as well as standard short mobilities are organized. The young people (BSc, MSc, PhD students) as well as the teachers have the possibility to open their minds and explore the richness of opportunities flowing from the possibilities of cooperation in the framework of being in the Danube Region. Also the events such as the CEEPUS excursions, Workshops and Summer Schools have an impact on the local society, by the fact that they have also contact with the guests staying in the host country. From a sociological point of view, it is very important that especially the young people have the possibility to learn living and working with each other on the basis of a conscious co-existence. And for that co-existence, the best starting point is the preparation of common projects with teaching and research elements, varied by an excursion to the industrial companies or summer schools. Such actions can be the best starting point for building long-term friendships, and hence long-term didactic and scientific cooperation. It should be also noted that the young people learn most willingly when they can formulate own thoughts, and no one forces them to learn monotonously. For this reason, the net-work PL-701 is promoting CEEPUS Excursion to provide them with a possibility to attend a number of students at the same time. And most importantly, the students participating in the seminars, lab works or trips to the companies, can hardly believe how much they learn at that time, not to mention, of course, of exercises in com-municating in a foreign language.\n\nLANGUAGE POLICY\n\nIn the PL-701 Network, the teaching activities in English are treated as a prior-ity. For example, at the Koszalin University of Technology a teacher must show to University coordinator the materials prepared in English regarding the teaching hours before getting an official permission for the CEEPUS trip. In other Universities the situation is very similar, which is constantly increases the professionalism of teaching and the motivations for the ever-growing challenges, such as common stu-dent handbooks, and also regular lectures by foreign lecturers. Of course, there are some places in the Central Europe, where a teacher or a student has to know other language, mostly it is the language of the host country. However, the opportunity to learn a new language is always definitely a challenge, but also a great adventure. In the summary it should be highlighted, that most of the professors teaching during CEEPUS scholarships are very well prepared thanks to the technical English lan-guage knowledge, and the content of lectures shared by them is very valuable for the students. In addition, all host Universities are trying to teach host country language. In most cases, this is accomplished by taking care of foreign students by host youth.\n\nTHE TOP SUCCESSES IN 2016\n\nINTERNATIONAL CEEPUS WORKSHOP ON APPLIED AND SUSTAINABLE ENGINEERING AT KOSZALIN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (PL)\n\nINTERNATIONAL CEEPUS WORKSHOP ON SURFACE ENGINEERING AT VSB-TU OSTRAVA (CZ)\n\nNEW PARTNERS\n\nCEEPUS EXCURSIONS\n\nSOCIAL EVENTS FOR CEEPUS STUDENTS\n\nLONG TERM MOBILITIES\n\nINTERNATIONAL CEEPUS WORKSHOP ON APPLIED AND SUSTAINABLE ENGINEERING AT KOSZALIN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (PL)\n\nThat CEEPUS event was organized in term 5-11.06.2016.
