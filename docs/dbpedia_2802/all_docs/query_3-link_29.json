As we all know, it is not just the words of a piece of good literature which create the magic, and the art, but the spaces between them. This space is filled with images and emotions and is the reason why we read.<br/>Reading is itself a form of translation; simple written symbols are translated into spoken words, which can themselves become an image of a film running before our inner eye, enabling an immersive involvement in the narrative. The more the story moves us emotionally, the longer we remember it. Language matters In everyday life, we encounter the discrepancy between spoken word and meaning all too often. A casual, throwaway “I love you” can be just as hurtful as a swear word. “You swine” whispered gently, can become an intimate term of endearment. And while the biblical “let your yes be yes, and your no be no” might be worth striving for, in our everyday lives we are usually moving through a kind of grey area where the boundaries blur. <br/> It is these grey areas, these gaps and shadowy places that require true magic so that they can be transferred into another language and thus into another cultural realm. Not only do translators need to be ready to be moved by a story but they must also take responsibility for it.  They may delve at will into a treasure chest of words, constructions, and possibilities until they eventually build a new version.  For this creation, they need to juggle so that they render the original author’s intentions properly while keeping an eye on the cultural background of the new readership.<br/>Let me give you an example to illustrate this: “Without Waking Up” appeared in Croatian and sometime later in Serbian. I undertook reading tours in both countries and saw at close range how the once shared language was becoming increasingly separate. Although the book will be understood in both Serbian and Croatian, there is scarcely a common word, even the sentence structure was changed whenever possible – not to mention the writing system. New social and political realities are being cemented more and more into the language.<br/>It was different in countries such as Georgia and Ukraine, where national identity is closely linked with the language and translation plays an important and often quite highly regarded role. For example, if I allow an Austrian novel to be translated into Ukrainian, I elevate the status of Ukrainian, reinforcing the significance of this language and, to a certain extent, safeguarding its cultural and national identity. A Georgian interview partner once told me that language and identity are an existential theme for Georgian culture and therefore for Georgian literature.<br/>I have realised on many reading tours that the value of literature is higher in societies whose culture is under threat than in the “large” central European countries who have long been secure in their world status.<br/> <br/>Languages such as English are unbelievably important to enable humanity to move closer together; I am not an opponent of globalisation if it means that we can engage with each other, eye to eye and eventually come to understand that we are all not just inhabitants of the same planet but also stem from the same ancestors.<br/>But that doesn’t just mean that we are all equal. So, as there are different solutions for technical problems – zip versus buttons versus belts – there are different ways of expressing ourselves.

Language influences our thinking and with it, our behaviour, and this abundance must be protected. Translation is key to this; when a translator embraces a work they bow down before another language and culture. Translation isn’t just about magic but also with respect and appreciation.\n\nCarolina Schutti is an Austrian-born author, academic and musician. She has published five novels including this one and is the Austrian winner of the European Literature Prize in 2015. Her book, Without Waking Up is translated by Deirdre McMahon, is published by Bullaun Press – Ireland’s first publisher exclusively dedicated to work in translation.\n\nConcordia recently hosted a roundtable discussion on the pragmatic translation of Indigenous languages. The event marked the first of its kind, where individuals from various nations gathered to discuss translation issues.\n\n“Such events are common for language teaching, but not for translation practice, which remains somewhat taboo. Most translators are not professionals and have never received formal training in the field,” notes René Lemieux, assistant professor in the Département d’études françaises. Lemieux and others from the Indigenous Translation Observatory organized the discussion.\n\n“It’s also in the nature of translators to remain in the background.”\n\nThe roundtable was part of the TTR (Traduction, Terminologie, Rédaction) journal's 35th anniversary conference, \"Redefining Translation? Historical fluctuations, new practices, and epistemologies in the making,\" in collaboration with the Canadian Association for Translation Studies.\n\nThe focus of the event was put on pragmatic (as opposed to literary) translation for its ability to address the translation of concepts unfamiliar to the specific communities where the texts are translated, requiring translators to innovate lexically, sometimes creating new terms. A unique challenge in pragmatic translation is the anonymity of translators, making it difficult to trace the origins of translations and connect with the translators themselves. This poses a methodological challenge for research.\n\nCommunity and linguistic diversity\n\nAmong the panelists were Hélène St-Onge, a technolinguist, and Louise Canapé. The two work on the Lexique spécialisé des études collégiales en français-innu created for the Cégep de Baie-Comeau. St-Onge and Canapé also work at the Pessamit Innu Council and are translators of Innu-aimun.\n\nSt-Onge emphasizes the importance of considering the audience in translation, including dialect preferences and the purpose of the translation: “A publication intended for all Innu people uses standardized spelling. A translation for a specific community, like Pessamit, uses terms unique to that community, with spelling closer to their pronunciation, known as lelueun,” she explains.\n\nCanapé brings our attention to the process of creating new words: “We start by asking community radio listeners to suggest possible Innu-aimun translations for a French word,” she shares.\n\n“We then present five options on Facebook, gather feedback and hold a vote. The final choice is confirmed with community Elders. It's crucial to involve Elders in the translation process; they may propose alternatives if the suggested translations are not well understood.”\n\nReviving ancient words\n\nPhilippe Charland, an Abenaki language professor at Kiuna College and other institutions, uses old manuscripts of Abenaki dictionaries and lexicons, including the oldest known one by Jesuit missionary Sébastien Rasles from 1691, for his translations. The Awikhiganisaskak project at Université de Sherbrooke, of which he is a part, aims to transcribe these manuscripts, facilitating research.\n\n“Each missionary introduced different spellings,” he says. “Recognizing them is essential. Transcribing these old manuscripts is crucial for reviving old words.”\n\nAdvocating for Indigenous language education\n\nFrances Mowatt, of the Abitibi8inni Nation, is an Anicinapemo8in translator who was recently awarded an honorary doctorate from the Université du Québec en Abitibi-Témiscamingue. She advocates for teaching Indigenous languages to young people. Mowatt recalls her mother’s insistence on her children learning the language from a young age, while also learning how to speak French. Her mother also contributed to passing the language to her grandson. “Knowing Anicinapemo8in helped me learn French,” she says. “It never hindered me.”\n\nA collaborative exercise\n\nAs a concluding exercise, the roundtable participants were asked to translate the term “Canadian Association for Translation Studies.”\n\nCharland proposed “Kanadi8ïm8wkaw8gan wji agakimzimek azwawakal8dwaw8ganal” (literally: “the Canadian gathering for those who study the work of language exchange”). Mowatt suggested “Kanada inotamake8innik ka ok8api8atc” (literally: “the translators of Canada sit in a group”).\n\nCanapé and St-Onge offered “Mamu ka atusseshtakau e ashushtakannit ute Kanata assit” (literally: “together, those who work to translate, here on the land of Canada”).\n\nLemieux highlights the broader significance of such initiatives: “It's crucial to give voice to the practitioners of translation. Many translators have learned the profession on the job without institutional support. In this sense, the role of the university is evolving: it's not just about offering opinions on realities outside the university but creating spaces for these kinds of events to happen.”\n\nThe recording of this first roundtable can serve as a pedagogical resource, laying the foundation for specialized training in Indigenous language translation.\n\nFind out more about the Indigenous Translation Observatory and the impactful work of the Office of Indigenous Directions at Concordia.\"\n\n#metaglossia_mundus: https://www.concordia.ca/cunews/main/stories/2024/08/09/concordia-hosts-the-1st-roundtable-on-pragmatic-translation-of-indigenous-languages-in-quebec.html"
