        "text": "When working for an international company your mother tongue or some international language may be able to cover the whole day. However, for going shopping, taking part in public life and making friends it is useful to learn some. This will win great respect of the local people who can be very supportive when they realise you have tried to learn at least a few phrases. The tried-and-tested approach is to find good friends to speak with. Although Czech is known not to be the easiest language to learn, with such an approach many people have become very good in Czech even within a year!\n\nSome workplaces offer language courses for their employees. Ask your manager or HR if it is also the case for your company. No matter what the result, you can also take advantage of free Czech lessons organized at the Centre for Integration of Foreigners.\n\nThere are also plenty of language schools offering Czech courses: summer school, short and intensive courses, half- to one-year-long and slow-paced, individual or group, and beginner to advanced, as well as many free online practice materials! In addition to language courses in a classroom you may make use of a number of free online course materials and resources. Watching Czech TV as a “background“ sound or watching the same film several times with, and later without, the subtitles works almost like a miracle. As far as kids, until the age of 11 it is enough if they can freely play with Czech kids. After a few months of a “silent period” the kids will acquire the language naturally without any special efforts or formal teaching. The bonus is that bilingual and trilingual people are able to learn more languages later. So what are the options?\n\nFirst, you have to register in person at the selected school that organizes the exam, or you can do so via the Online application. You must register no later than 14 days before the exam. Later registrations are not possible. If you cannot come to the exam, you must apologize at least 7 days before the exam, either personally or by written apology. Also, you have to come to the school and pay for the exam no later than 7 days before the exam. However, if you don’t pass the exam and you have to repeat it, the price is CZK 3,200 (2024). It is a good idea to take the Practice Test so you know what to expect.\n\nYou will have to fill in your full name – first name and surname, date of birth, citizenship, passport number, contact address in the Czech Republic (so that they know where to send your certificate), telephone and e-mail address. For registration, you need a valid passport. The exams take place once a month, either on Wednesday from 9 am or on Saturday from 9 am.\n\nOn the day of the exam, you must arrive 30 minutes before the scheduled start, because in case of late arrival, you can no longer take the exam that day. You will have to reschedule, but you will have to pay for another attempt. Don’t forget to bring your travel document for the registration. You will receive a card with a registration number. This card will have to be on the table during the whole exam along with your travel document. After completing the written part, you will be informed in which order you are going for the oral exam.\n\nThere are strict rules which have to be followed during the exam:\n\nKeep in mind that during the exam, your belongings have to be in a place that is not close to you;\n\nYour phone has to be switched off all the time;\n\nYou must not leave during the exam.\n\nPlease, read the full instructions very carefully here.\n\nIf you want to take the exam, you can register on this website or you can do it in person at an exam center. Registration must be done no later than 14 days before the exam.\n\nYou can take both parts of the exam on the same day, or you can take them separately.\n\nBoth parts of the exam are paid separately. Current prices can be found here. The exam fee must be paid no later than 7 days before the exam. You have to bring proof of payment with you on the day of the exam.\n\nAfter filling in the online application, you will be informed by email about the location of the exam. You have to arrive at least 30 minutes before the beginning of the exam. The last registration is made 5 minutes before the start.\n\nDuring the registration process, your identity will be checked according to your valid, internationally recognized travel document (i.e. passport) and a document stating your place of permanent residence. Your proof of payment will be checked as well. Then you will receive a code and an identification bracelet.\n\nRemember that only those who take the exam are allowed to enter the building. You must not leave the exam center until the end of the written part of the exam."
