        "text": "The consecutive (follow-on) Master's degree program \"English Philology\" is the English-language version of the degree program \"Anglick√° filologie\"; it follows on from the Bachelor degree program of the same name. The aim of the program is to produce graduates who are specialists in English philology - proficient users of English (C2 in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) with a solid knowledge of English linguistics and a deep knowledge of the literature and culture of English-speaking countries, who are aware of the professional literature in these fields and other information resources.\n\nFurther information\n\nStudy programs of the University of Ostrava are available also for persons with a disability unless stated otherwise in the information on a concrete study program. In case of any questions regarding the availability of individual study programs for persons with a disability, do not hesitate to contact the Pyramid Centre of the University of Ostrava (\"Centrum Pyramida OU\"):\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nPhone: +420 553 46 1234\n\nCell phone: +420 733 784 095\n\nIn case of questions, applicants without specific needs shall contact the Center for International Cooperation at [email protected]\n\nDiscipline-specific knowledge\n\nGraduates of the two-year consecutive (follow-on) Master's degree have a wide range of competencies in philological disciplines. Their knowledge demonstrates a qualitative and quantitative development of the theoretical knowledge, thinking and awareness gained as part of their previous Bachelor's studies of English philology. Courses in disciplines such as linguistic pragmatics, text linguistics, contrastive linguistic analysis, and sociolinguistics enable students to gain a comprehensive overview of the disciplinary landscape. The course in historical grammar gives them insights into the diachronic dimension of language and linguistics, Graduates also gain a deeper knowledge of the literature and culture of Great Britain (Medieval English literature) and the USA (Selected chapters from literature).\n\nDiscipline-specific skills\n\nGraduates are able to apply skills and methods in the field of linguistics. They are able to compare languages of different types and from different language groups (Language typology), and they are capable of conducting basic linguistic research (Linguistic seminar). They also possess a knowledge of the broader cultural and social contexts arising from the role of English as a global lingua franca (Chapters from British studies and literature, Chapters from American studies and literature). Graduates possess the necessary theoretical and practical skills enabling them to adequately analyze, interpret and assess issues connected with diverse aspects of (counter-)cultural life in contemporary English-speaking societies, including current intercultural influences and changes (Californian dream, Intercultural communication, Gender studies, American counterculture, Native languages and cultures of North America). Graduates are able to independently and effectively carry out assigned tasks and develop their knowledge and skills at a higher level (in doctoral studies) or in lifelong learning programs.\n\nGeneral competencies\n\nThanks to their language competence, discipline-specific, and special knowledge and skills, graduates of this program are able to pursue professional careers in the Czech Republic and abroad. They are able to apply their knowledge and skills in research and other forms of work at academic institutions. They are able to pursue careers as experts in public- and private-sector institutions, organizations, and companies (particularly in the international departments of these organizations), as well as in companies providing conference services and organizing cultural, intercultural and humanitarian events and activities. Graduates are also equipped to undertake post-graduate studies."
