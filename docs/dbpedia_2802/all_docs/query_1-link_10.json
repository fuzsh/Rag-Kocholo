        "text": "University Library\n\nThis institution has a physical Library.\n\nV�B - Technick� univerzita Ostrava Library's Offerings:\n\nBooks:\n\nThe library's extensive collection of books is accessible through the online Library catalogue, which provides details for a significant portion of our collection. For earlier documents, patrons should refer to the card catalogues, located in the Circulation Department, holding information on pre-1995 books. Books are stored either in the library's stacks or are available on open shelves. To facilitate access, books are organized by subject using the Universal Decimal Classification system, which is the Czech version of the UDC Consortium's classification system. Patrons are advised to use the catalogue for efficient book retrieval.\n\nE-books:\n\nThe Central Library offers a collection of electronic books with perpetual access. For more information, please visit the E-books page.\n\nRare Book Collection:\n\nOur library houses an archival collection of rare and older books and periodicals, primarily focused on subjects such as geology, mining, physics, chemistry, mathematics, and metallurgy. These items were acquired through purchase and gifts during the 19th and early 20th centuries by the Mining Academy in Pribram. The collection includes notable works, including the oldest book in our historical collection, Georgii Agricolae De re Metallica Libri XII from 1561. Patrons can request access to these books and periodicals, with approval required from a university librarian for books printed before 1801.\n\nJournals:\n\nOur collection of journals, also known as periodicals or serials, is for reference use within the library and is non-borrowable. To check if we subscribe to a specific journal, patrons can use the search option in the online catalogue. Current journals, from the past two years, are located in library study rooms, arranged alphabetically by title. Older volumes are available for reading in the Circulation Department. Patrons can make photocopies or electronic copies of needed articles using library services.\n\nElectronic Journals:\n\nFor access to full-text journals available to V�B-TUO staff and students, please consult the List of e-resources, sorted by type, under the \"E-journals\" section.\n\nTheses & Dissertations:\n\nTheses and dissertations produced by VSB � Technical University of Ostrava staff and students are maintained in the library's Circulation Department. They are accessible either on open shelves in the study room or in the library store and may not be borrowed. Records for all theses and dissertations available in the reading room are found in the library's online catalogue: DSpace of VSB-Technical University of Ostrava.\n\nAccess policy of theses and dissertations:\n\nOpen access without any restrictions.\n\nIn exceptional cases, some theses may have restricted access, often due to intellectual property protection. These are marked as \"closedAccess\" or \"embargoedAccess.\"\n\nThe library's records of theses are comprehensive, starting from the year 1986, while dissertations have been included since the 1950s.\n\nFor more details and a comprehensive list of services offered by the Library, please visit https://knihovna.vsb.cz/en/services/.\n\nUniversity Housing\n\nThis institution provides housing services such as on-campus residences or dormitories.\n\nVSB - Technick� univerzita Ostrava provides on-campus dormitory accommodation options for all international students.
