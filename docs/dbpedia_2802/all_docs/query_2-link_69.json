In this study, multilingual digital signage in which the displayed language is changed to the user's native language automatically when the user comes near to the digital signage was developed. This system specifies the native language of the user by acquiring the information of language that is set in the user's smart phone by using the iBeacon communication. In this study, the prototype system of the multilingual digital signage was constructed and it is used for the evaluation experiment in the university campus. From the result, we confirmed that this system can be used effectively for both Japanese and the foreigners.\n\nTY - GEN\n\nT1 - Multilingual Digital Signage Using iBeacon Communication\n\nAU - Ogi, Tetsuro\n\nAU - Ito, Kenichiro\n\nAU - Konita, Shigeyuki\n\nN1 - Publisher Copyright: Â© 2016 IEEE.
