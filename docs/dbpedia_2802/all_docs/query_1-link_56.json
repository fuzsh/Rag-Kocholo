        "text": "Have you studied or obtained your qualification abroad? Do you wish to continue with your studies in Czechia? If yes, it is necessary to obtain an official document verifying that your education, which you have completed, is equal to the education in Czechia. The process of recognition of completed education differs according to the level of education which you need to have recognized.\n\nNOSTRIFICATION OR RECOGNITION? WHAT DO I NEED?\n\nThe process of recognition of elementary, secondary, and higher (not university) education is called \"nostrifikace\". The documentation of completed elementary, secondary, or higher education is called \"vysvědčení\" (certificate). Nostrification is provided by the regional authorities. The regional authority (in Prague it is Prague City Hall) also represents the contact place where you will get answers to your questions about the legalization process of your documents.\n\nAnother possibility of recognition is, in addition to nostrification, also recognition within the admission procedure at a university that has an institutional accreditation. Such a recognized education applies only to that particular university and faculty. It is not generally valid and cannot be used for admission procedures to other institutions.\n\nOn the other hand, the process of recognition of university education is called the \"recognition of foreign higher education and qualification in Czechia\". The documentation of completed university education is called \"diplom\" (diploma). The recognition of university diplomas is commonly provided by universities that provide a similar study program.\n\nNOSTRIFICATION\n\nWhich documents do I need to enclose with the application for nostrification?\n\nBelow you can find the list of required documents as mentioned on official websites of regional authorities and on the application form. The period given by law for processing the request is 30 days. In difficult and complex cases, the period can be extended to 60 days.\n\nThe attachments submitted along with the Application:\n\nCertified copy of legalized foreign school report/diploma prepared by a Czech notary (notář) and translated by the Czech court interpreter (soudní tlumočník)\n\nCertified copy of the legalized list of school subjects (mathematics, physics, English language, etc.) with the number of hours prepared by the Czech notary and translated by the Czech court interpreter.\n\nProof that the school which issued your diploma/school report is integrated into the education system of your country.\n\nProof of payment of administrative fee: 1000 CZK\n\nIdentity document of the applicant\n\nProof of a place of stay in Czechia\n\nHere you can find the whole process of getting this documentation.\n\nrecognition within the admission procedure\n\nThe universities that have received institutional accreditation, may also recognize foreign secondary education as part of their admission process. However, this recognition is valid only for the particular university and faculty.\n\nThe universities with the institutional accreditation are:\n\nAcademy of Performing Arts in Prague\n\nBrno University of Technology\n\nCzech University of Life Sciences Prague\n\nCharles University\n\nJan Evangelista Purkyně University\n\nMasaryk University\n\nMendel University in Brno\n\nPalacký University Olomouc\n\nPrague University of Economics and Business\n\nTomas Bata University in Zlín\n\nUniversity of Chemistry and Technology Prague\n\nUniversity of Ostrava\n\nUniversity of Pardubice\n\nUniversity of South Bohemia in České Budějovice\n\nUniversity of Veterinary Sciences Brno\n\nUniversity of West Bohemia\n\nVSB - Technical University of Ostrava\n\nRECOGNITION of higher education studies\n\nWhich documents do I need to enclose with the application for recognition?\n\nGraduates of Bachelor’s, Master’s degree programmes and/or doctoral degree programme graduates from foreign universities wishing to obtain recognition of their foreign diplomas are required to submit a written Application along with other documents to the Rector’s Office of a public university. The period given by law for processing the request is 30 days. In difficult and complex cases, the period can be extended to 60 days.\n\nThe attachments submitted along with the Application:\n\nLegally attested copy of a Diploma or similar proof of completion of studies issued by a foreign university\n\nLegally attested copy of a Diploma Supplement or copy of a list of completed courses\n\nCertified translations of both documents into Czech or English (documents issued in English are exempt from this clause)\n\nProof of payment of administrative fee: 3000 CZK\n\nRuling on grant refugee status, if submitted by the person who has been granted this status\n\nHere you can find the whole process of getting this documentation.\n\nException for Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Slovenia\n\nHigher education qualifications from the above countries of origin may be used in Czechia directly, without a certificate on the recognition of foreign higher education.\n\nComprehensive information about the process of recognition is also available on the website of the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports. Besides, you can find more in the brochure \"Recognition of Foreign Education and Qualifications in the Czech Republic\" which provides a complex guide about the process of the recognition of foreign education and/or qualification. In this brochure, you can find relevant contacts in case of any further questions. You can also receive support and advice from the Czech ENIC - NARIC Centre (National Academic Recognition Information Centre) functioning under the umbrella of the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports."
