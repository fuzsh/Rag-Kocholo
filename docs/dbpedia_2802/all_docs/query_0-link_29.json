        "text": "Journal of European Psychology Students\n\nEFPSA Research Programme\n\nSocial Impact Initiative\n\nStudy and Travel Abroad\n\nTraining Office\n\nJournal of European Psychology Students\n\nThe Journal of European Psychology Students (JEPS) is an international, double-blind peer-reviewed, open-access journal published by EFPSA and is open for submissions from psychology students worldwide.\n\nJEPS’ main task is the publishing of journal articles written by students. We are not restricted to a specific field, but welcome articles of every topic related to psychology.\n\nFurthermore, JEPS runs a blog–the JEPS Bulletin–where students can read up on the world of psychological science. Here the JEPS team publishes various articles, e.g., interviews with scientists or posts related to scientific writing or improving your data analysis.Guest contributions are always welcome as well (just write to us at journal@efpsa.org)!\n\nTarget audience\n\nAs a student journal, JEPS addresses students who want to publish their own scientific work. This can be a Bachelor’s or Master’s Thesis but also studies that were done outside of a university - like a scientific project in the EFPSA Junior Researcher Program, during an internship, or even a self-made literature review. We take submissions from students as long as it is an article from the field of psychology or related fields (e.g. cognitive or neuroscience, scientific methodology/applied statistics, or behavioral science). Articles from Ph.D. students or professional researchers are excluded.\n\nPublication criteria\n\nJEPS strives for sound research within the articles to be published. Sound research means that the implementation of a study follows an ethical and logical basis, the methodology is implemented thoroughly, and that the conclusions of the study are based on comprehensive evidence from the data. It is very important to remark that JEPS does not see statistical significance as a reason to publish or reject a paper - the important criteria are that the study was conducted soundly and that the conclusions are coherent with the presented evidence.An article that is submitted to JEPS must not be considered by or submitted to another publication outlet (publicly available bachelor’s or master’s theses are exempt from this criterion, as well as preprints).\n\nPublication Process\n\nHow does the publication process look like when you decide to publish an article in JEPS? JEPS has a multilevel process to ensure scientific standards - just like other psychological journals. During the whole process, the focus of JEPS editors is to work closely together with you to improve the quality of your article and to guide you through the publication process.\n\nSubmission: First you create a free account on our website and upload your paper as a submission.\n\nTechnical Review: After your paper is submitted, an Editor from the JEPS-Team will be assigned to perform the Technical Review. Here, we will check whether the article follows the criteria of the JEPS Submission Guideline (i.e., mostly adhering to the APA Manual) and if the text is well-structured. You will receive feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of your article and appropriate suggestions towards its improvement. After all formal shortcomings have been corrected, your article will go on to the next stage: the Content Review.\n\nContent Review: In Content Review, your article will be reviewed by one of our Associate Editors (PhD-Students or Postdocs) and assigned to at least two external reviewers. This is analogous to the review process in other scientific journals to ensure publication quality. The key difference is that in JEPS, you will receive in-depth feedback on the scientific rigor of your study and clarity of presentation in the article. This will help you identify possible shortcomings or mistakes in your demonstration of the research process, so that you may draw the appropriate conclusions from your research. Furthermore, this will help you with subsequent endeavours in scientific writing.\n\nFinal Editing\n\nCopyediting: Once your article successfully demonstrates its adherence to JEPS’ standard of quality, it will be forwarded to a cCopyeditor, who will do the final grammar check-up. The copyeditor and the author will be in direct communication to resolve these stylistic issues. Layout Editing: After Copyediting, the paper goes to the JEPS Editors once more. The Editor in charge of the manuscript will format the article’s layout into its final version, so that it may be ready for publication.Proofreading: The article will be proofread one last time by the Editor-in-Chief or the Senior Editor and then the publication process will be completed – and you have your first scientific publication in JEPS!\n\nOpen Access\n\nAnother important aspect of JEPS is our commitment to Open Access. This means that all published articles are freely available to readers. Open Access publications have many advantages, e.g., being available to the general public, therefore increasing readership and citation rates (see our position paper on Open Access). JEPS has publication costs as many other journals do, too - but only when these are covered by your university which they often do for students. Many universities also offer funding opportunities for Open Access where JEPS usually meets all relevant criteria.\n\nHow you benefit from submitting an article to the Journal of European Psychology Students:\n\nFirst publication in a peer-reviewed, open-access journal already during your studies;\n\nConstructive feedback during the whole publication process;\n\nThe article processing charge (APC) will be waived should your school/university not cover those;\n\nGuaranteed publication of good quality papers (regardless of the results’ significance)\n\nFor more information, follow us here:\n\nJEPS: https://jeps.efpsa.org\n\nJEPS Bulletin: http://blog.efpsa.org\n\nJEPS on Facebook: fb.me/efpsa.jeps\n\nJEPS on Twitter: @efpsa_jeps\n\nAbout RP\n\nThe EFPSA Research Programme (EFPSA RP) is an EFPSA Service, consisting of a twelve month research programme that involves students, PhD and postdoctoral researchers and established academics. This programme offers a unique opportunity to develop research abilities, academic, teamwork, leadership and interpersonal skills. All Research Summer School participants completing the training programme and committing to the research project are invited to join the EPFSA RP. The EFPSA Research Programme was formerly known as EFPSA Junior Research Programme. The EFPSA Service received a new name in 2019.\n\nThe EFPSA RP was developed to meet the needs of RSS research projects by supplying framework, guidance and academic support to students and supervisors throughout the duration of each project. The primary purpose of the EFPSA RP is to provide a structure by which all research groups are able to complete and submit all EFPSA RP research for dissemination within a twelve month period after the RSS.\n\nHighlights of the programme include publication of methodology papers in the EFPSA Journal of European Psychology Students (JEPS), presentation of work to-date during the annual EFPSA Congress. In the past, presentation were held at the Junior Researcher Programme Conference (JRPC). In order to give the research teams a bigger audience, more opportunities and a better place to present their research project, the Research Teams are now invited to the upcoming annual EFPSA Congress after the RSS. This change was introduced in 2019.\n\nThe programme is run by the EFPSA RP Team which consists of the RP Coordinator, the RP Research Responsible, and RP Team Member. The EFPSA RP is supported by the EFPA Advisory Board.\n\nHow it works\n\nThe EFPSA (European Federation of Psychology Students’ Associations) Research Programme (RP) is a twelve month research programme that involves students, PhD and postdoctoral researchers and established academics. This programme offers a unique opportunity to develop research abilities, academic, teamwork, leadership and interpersonal skills. Each year there are at least six teams that each consist of six undergraduate or master students led by a PhD or a postdoctoral researcher.\n\nThe Researcher Programme (RP) aims to meet needs of the Research Summer School (RSS) research projects by supplying framework, guidance and academic support to students and supervisors throughout the duration the project.\n\nIn all, there are four stages of RP involvement:\n\nAttendance at the Research Summer School (RSS)\n\nCompletion of methodology papers (short literature reviews + methods/ethics/issues section) in the six months post-RSS\n\nPresentation of work completed at annual EFPSA Congress\n\nSubmission of methodology papers to JEPS’ Work-in-Progress Reports\n\nCurrent Projects\n\nSocial Network Sites, Social Comparison and Adolescent Identity Development\n\nIdentity development is the primary psychosocial task of adolescence (Erikson, 1950), and over the past decade, young people have increasingly been using social networking sites (SNSs) as platforms for self-expression, self-construction, and identity exploration. Interestingly, scholarship concerning SNSs and adolescent identity development has been dominated by the notion that such platforms represent convenient and powerful venues for self-disclosure and selfpresentation. However, as SNSs provide opportunities for, and at times prompt, their users to express themselves online, they also afford individuals abundant opportunities for social comparison. Whilst scholars have started to investigate the consequences of SNS social comparisons, much of the extant literature has concerned the negative psycho-emotional outcomes of such comparisons, rather than their identity implications.\n\nTo help shed some light on this gap in the literature, this project seeks to determine how comparisons of ability and opinion on popular SNS (such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) associate with adolescent identity. Furthermore, it also aims to examine who adolescents are comparing themselves to on SNSs, and consider whether different comparison targets (such as friends/strangers or similar/dissimilar others) may have different implications for adolescent identity.\n\nEdward Noon (Sheffield Hallam University, United Kingdom)\n\nThe Effect of Internet use on students’ monitoring accuracy of the time spent on solving logic tasks\n\nThe rapid technological development changes the current educational environment. The easy access to the internet, in which learners predominantly interact with the information, impacts the instructions for adaptive study behavior. On one hand, evidence demonstrates that internet-based technology can provide increased learning gains. On the other hand, some studies display that the internet environment leads to maladaptive learning strategies and decreased cognitive functions. Students should be taught to increase their study control and monitor their time spent on task within internet-based learning environment. However, there is a little evidence that would show how does time monitoring manifest in the internet environment. The current study examines the students’ monitoring accuracy of time spent on a set of logic tasks. The findings of the study will open a new getaway to a research based educational practice that encourages students’ strategic behavior within internet-based learning environment.\n\nOndrej Pesout (Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic)\n\nThe Uncanny Valley phenomenon across cultures: Graphic realism and empathy in viewers of video games characters\n\nGraphic realism and enjoyment or likability is a heuristic used in CGI design, with characters and graphic rendering becoming more and more realistic. However, if the graphic design of a human face becomes too real, it can decrease likability, creating the ‘uncanny valley phenomenon’. This was primarily focused on robotics from the 1970s but has been adapted to more modern human representations in graphics. However, since emotion perception and expression can differ culturally and with the increasing prevalence of digital graphics in media, it would be vital to understand this effect cross culturally. It is important to note that realism exists on a spectrum from a circle, dots and lines to denote a face to a fully rendered dinosaur attacking. Yet, emotion can be elicited or perceived in both contexts. However, much research on graphic realism relies on still images rather than realistic videos of moving characters. Therefore, understanding which kind of realism appeals to different cultures may increase design capability in the future using videos of rendered CGI characters. Lastly, previous similar research by the supervisor focused on video games characters and since they appear in media involving violence and aggression as well as highly lucrative and well-known forms of entertainment, it is suggested to use video games characters in this research.\n\nCatherine Friend (Waterford Institute of Technology, Ireland)\n\nFiction and Empathy in the digital age: The effects of digital and non-digital modes of fiction-engagement on empathic abilities\n\nEmpathy, the ability to interpret and appreciate the mental states of others, is essential for effective communication and to navigating the social world. Research has suggested that reading fiction may enhance people’s empathic abilities, through the communication of social knowledge. However, fiction-engagement occurs via an increasing range of formats, including reading on paper and onscreen, listening to audiobooks, streaming TV, and playing interactive computer games. This project aims to take an experimental approach in order to establish the effects of digital versus non-digital modes of engagement with fiction, on empathic abilities. This research project addresses the topic of communication in the digital age through an examination of the effects of fiction-engagement on empathic abilities. Fictional stories transmit social knowledge, and the evolution of the human capacity to share in stories is thought to be key to successful communication and cooperation. Because fiction centres on humans or humanlike agents and their interactions, research has shown that it can enhance empathic abilities, the skillset associated with effective interpersonal communication and understanding. However, fiction-engagement occurs via an increasing range of formats, and research has indicated that the medium impacts the message. Using an experimental approach, this project will address the research question: What are the effects of engaging with fiction via digital and non-digital formats on people’s empathic abilities?\n\nRose Turner (Kingston University, United Kingdom)\n\nUsability and Feasibility of a Schema Therapy-based Self-Help Mobile Application for Depressive Symptoms\n\nSchema Therapy provides a needs-focused framework for addressing mental health problems and has been successfully used for treating personality problems, and, more recently, emotional disorders. Less is known, however, about how its principles can be used in a self-help format. The proposed research aims to preliminarily test a standalone mobile application combining behavioral activation with schema-focused techniques, targeted at users with depressive symptoms.\n\nA needs-based approach is at the heart of Schema Therapy as a psychotherapeutic practice. This involves teaching the client to become aware of their core needs (such as connection or competence) and to pursue them in adaptive ways. So far, research on Schema Therapy has mostly focused on personality pathology or other chronic mental health problems. Less is known about how this approach can be used with clients suffering from less severe mental health problems, particularly in a self-help context. The proposed research project aims to assess the usability and feasibility of a Schema Therapy-based self-help mobile application for depressive symptoms that adds a needs-based component to behavioral activation. Namely, in addition to the more classical aspect of scheduling valued activities (underpinning behavioral activation), the concept of the proposed application revolves around educating users to become aware of their core unmet needs and around providing guidance and encouragement in terms of identifying and carrying out meaningful activities on these lines.\n\nPaula Stroian (Babeș-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania)\n\nEthics\n\nThe EFPSA RP approach to safety, integrity and transparency in research\n\nAs the EFPSA RP has continuously improved standards for scientific work across many disciplines in psychology, we have also redoubled our efforts to ensure that any work supported through the programme expresses a clear commitment to ethical guidelines even while carried out through a variety of institutions, countries and languages. While we are neither a university nor a programme with a fixed location, we still approach ethics as the first and most important element of each project. During the RSS training, there are several explicit discussions surrounding ethics where the below elements are presented. For each of these, it is made abundantly clear that, even with ambiguity and variance between many locations/institutions on how to approach ethics for international projects, we demand transparency and clear records on how ethical approval was obtained for each study and testing location. Beginning in 2013, we have decided to make those steps public as a means to reference and better understand our approach and ultimately our research. This section is thus a description of how we advise our groups to gain ethical approval but we underline that such endorsement does not come from the RP itself.\n\n1. Research Supervisor Institution\n\nBefore being offered a position to lead one of the six RP research groups each year, prospective Supervisors are required to guarantee that they have access to a standing ethics committee in their institution. As part of this process, Supervisors must also ensure that they have guidance on how to remain ethical if/when testing in a location beyond the scope of their own institution.\n\n2. Junior Researcher Institution\n\nFor our researchers still studying or otherwise engaged in universities who wish to claim affiliation with an institution, we require that they notify their respective faculties/departments of the work as soon as the RSS is complete and the Supervisor has received ethical approval. As each university varies in terms of student project ethical guidelines, we do not have a standing approach to the next steps but explicitly request all participants ensure they have received written approval of this project from an authorised source locally or their own full ethical review, if required. We then advise our groups to have these documents translated into the appropriate languages for immediate production if requested.\n\n3. Testing Location\n\nMany of our projects move on to test in non-university environments, such as schools, community centres and other established organisations. Much like with universities, not all institutions have the same (or even standing) guidelines on how permission is granted to test among their membership. For this reason, we advise our groups to contact the organisation as soon as they are certain of their data collection plans to get details on how permission to collect data should be gained. Sometimes this is as simple as a short email where others require higher authorities (e.g. education ministries, local councils) to provide authorisation.\n\n4. Affiliation\n\nThe above steps must be followed before the RP will assign affiliation for any team member to project outputs. This is done to protect universities and institutions of our members to ensure they are not linked to work without their direct knowledge. This may not always equate to ethical review in each location, but at least an acknowledgement from an authorised source from a recognised institution which may be listed as a participant in the project must confirm awareness without reservation about the research. All outputs from the work should then be reported back to both the affiliated institutions and, as established in other commitment documents, to the RP.\n\nIn some circumstances where team members are unable to list an affiliation (e.g. recent graduation, not possible receive affiliation in current institution, etc; NOTE: not in the case of ethical approval being denied), we offer RP as an official option. The same protocols must be followed for this as all other affiliation requested described above, though we explicitly note that in these instances, RP may not be the sole affiliation for any individual or group collecting data, nor does this affiliation represent ethical approval.\n\nAbout the Social Impact Initiative\n\nIn the context of EFPSA, ‘Social Impact’ refers to an initiative aiming to make use of psychological knowledge in order to have a positive and significant impact on society. The initiative was introduced into the portfolio of EFPSA’s activities in April 2013, and the Social Impact Initiative Team (SII-Team) has been working on six distinct projects in order to reach their aims. The main three projects are: “Mind the Mind – to Combat the Stigma of Mental Disorders”, which is the biggest of them all; “Organised Acts of Kindness”, and “Better Together”.\n\nOne of the projects is the “Open Access” campaign, which is currently in the “freezer”, meaning that the SII Team is not working on it.\n\nThere are two new projects, which the SII Team of the 2020/2021 mandate started. One is the “Corona Care” campaign, an online project focusing on the psychological aspects of the pandemic, and the second one is “(A)live!” campaign, focusing on suicide prevention.\n\nThrough an enthusiastic network of psychology students, activists and friends of EFPSA, we hope to reach as many people as possible, raise awareness, educate, find support and advocate topics we consider important to the European community. The Social Impact Initiative Team works over a mandate of one year and consists of a Coordinator, three Project Responsibles and four Team Members.\n\nProjects\n\nMind the Mind - to Combat the Stigma of Mental Disorders\n\nThe “Mind the Mind – to Combat the Stigma of Mental Disorders” campaign, aims to educate primary and secondary-level students (aged from 13 to 14, and 15 to 18) as well as the general public, about mental health and mental disorders while working to decrease negative beliefs and stigma toward individuals affected by mental disorders. The stigma of mental disorders is a widespread phenomenon in Europe, causing substantial harm to the wellbeing of the individuals with mental disorders and society collectively.\n\nTaking advantage of their psychological background and implementing the pre-existing research in the area, the Social Impact Initiative team created a kit on the topic of stigma of mental disorders; with detailed instructions on how to organise and deliver a workshop. The workshop materials have been reviewed by experts in the field of stigma and are specifically tailored for three target groups: primary and secondary-level students, and adults. The purpose of this workshop is to help students understand complex topics such as mental health and mental health problems through the use of videos, role-play, games and discussions. There are two types of workshops with a duration of 45 or 90 minutes.\n\nAdditional Material on Mind the Mind:\n\nPosition Paper\n\nEvent Organisation Guide on Mental Health Awareness\n\nCampaign Structure\n\nThe campaign coordination involves several channels:\n\nThe Social Impact Initiative Team\n\nNational Coordinators within different European countries help Local Coordinators to organise the campaign locally\n\nLocal volunteers who conduct the workshops\n\nThe Social Impact Initiative Team provides assistance and mentorship to all national coordinators. The National Coordinators’ tasks include: translating materials from English to their national language, helping Local Coordinators with their tasks and recruiting new National and Local Coordinators for the next wave of the campaign. The Local Coordinators’ tasks include: promoting the campaign in their respective country and region, recruiting volunteers, contacting schools to schedule workshops, as well as organising training for volunteers. A ‘trainer’ is responsible for preparing the volunteers to deliver the workshop properly. During the training, volunteers review the workshop material, practice it, enhance presentation and communication skills, discuss potential problems and assess how the workshop will unfold with a specific group. The volunteers are then equipped to be the ones delivering the workshop to the students.\n\nWorkshops\n\nThe workshop starts with an introduction on mental disorders and encourages students to discuss their perceptions of it. Afterwards, volunteers facilitate a discussion about mental disorders while providing examples and basic facts. The workshop also presents causes of mental disorders using the multifactorial model of mental disorders’ development, and challenges the common misconception that the individual is to be blamed for their mental health problems. To illustrate some daily experiences of people affected by mental disorders and the irrational fears of society towards these people, videos of individuals who experience mental disorders are shown. These videos are used as prompts to encourage discussion regarding what kind of role the social environment has in regards to how a person manages mental disorders. Finally, students are provided with guidelines on how to approach individuals struggling with a mental disorder and information about where to seek help.\n\nHistory of Campaign\n\nThe “Mind the Mind – to Combat the Stigma of Mental Disorders” campaign was launched for the first time in October 2014. In total, 19 European countries participated in the first wave of the campaign, out of which 13 finished the campaign. The first wave ended in June 2015, with about 250 workshops being delivered across Europe. The start of this campaign was considered a big success.\n\nThe Social Impact Initiative team analysed the feedback given by the Local Coordinators and the volunteers involved, in order to improve the workshop material. The changes introduced in the second wave consisted of new videos and interactive games, such as role-play activities. Taking into consideration the interests of students according to their age, the activities were divided into two groups: for older students (17 to 18 years old) and for younger ones (15 to 16 years old). The team also included more materials and handouts displaying myths and facts about mental disorders to share with students. Lastly, a shorter version of the workshop lasting 45 minutes was introduced to make it easier for the schools to fit it into their schedules. The entire material of the new workshop was reviewed and approved by experts once again.\n\nThe second wave of the campaign started in August 2015 with 23 European countries participating. The coordinating team decided to adapt the materials also for primary school students (11 to 14 years old) and adults (18+ years old). The latter one can also be divided into two groups, based on their previous knowledge of psychology and mental disorders: non-psychology students and students of psychology and related professions.\n\nAfter the second wave, the evaluations were collected from local coordinators, volunteers and trainers, as well as from high-school students who were involved in the campaign. The evaluation showed a general reduction in stigmatising beliefs of students, and this decrease was especially prominent in those students who had very stigmatizing beliefs at the beginning of the workshop (Cohen’s d= 0.84). A large majority of them also saw the workshop as interesting, useful, pleasant and educational. Around two thirds of the students agreed with the statement that they would like to have a workshop like that again.\n\nThe third wave of the campaign started in 2016/2017. The materials were further improved according to the participants’ evaluations and the suggestions from experts. The third wave included 23 countries, in which 54 LCs were responsible for running the campaign. Around 1150 volunteers were involved, out of which around 400 eventually got the certificates for participation after they had participated in the training for volunteers, held at least 180 minutes of workshops (i.e. two longer workshops, four shorter ones or corresponding combinations), and filled in the evaluation questionnaire.\n\nThe fourth wave of the campaign started in 2017/2018 when the materials were again revised based on the evaluations from the previous wave, and the experts’ suggestions. An important addition to the workshops were leaflets distributed afterwards, informing the participants about the places providing free professional mental lth advice and help. The purpose is to facilitate help seeking behavior in addition to lowering the stigma as the main goal of the workshop. The leaflets offer specific behavioral measures for children and youth with mental health issues. It has been known that half of all mental health problems develop before the age of 14 and the sooner young people act upon them, the more successful the treatment outcomes typically are. The campaign has grown bigger than ever starting with 26 countries and involving 75 Local Coordinators, but only 48 Local Coordinators carried on their work together with a total of 1250 volunteers.\n\nThe fifth wave started in 2018/19. As in the previous years, the materials were adapted according to the received feedback. There were 27 countries with 70 LCs in the beginning of the wave, but only 47 Local Coordinators continued with their work in 47 countries. There were 1182 volunteers involved.\n\nThe sixth wave started in 2019/20. The materials were again adapted and 77 Local Coordinators from 28 countries started to make an impact. This wave was also special as the EYF grant was awarded to the project, which enabled the SII team to cover more expenses but also to create its own merchandise. The merch, consisting of water bottles, markers, pins and stickers, was sent to Local Coordinators for them to distribute it among their volunteers and promote the campaign. The wave ended with only 46 LCs and 1273 volunteers from 24 countries, as the covid-19 pandemic completely stopped our activity from approximately February until the end of the wave.\n\nThe seventh wave (2020/21) ended in July with the contribution of 16 out of the 19 countries which participated in the campaign. This wave had for the first time in Mind the Mind’s history a position of National Coordinators. Our National and Local Coordinators, and volunteers did not stay put this year and created new ways to interact with the public via flyers, lectures and events about mental health and a lot of social media activity!! Even with the pandemic our volunteers were still able to deliver in-person workshops!\n\nBetter Together\n\nBetter Together’s main focus is a cycle of workshops cycle which aims to empower psychology students for educating others about most pervasive types of discrimination and means of combating it, as well as to educate high-school students about discrimination, encouraging them to tackle it throughout Europe. The cycle consists of five workshops, each lasting around three hours, delivered to approximately 20 high-school students once per week for five consecutive weeks. The structure of the cycle is being changed by the Social Impact Initiative team of 2020/21 mandate and is based on the feedback received from the previous waves.\n\nThis activity brings together active members of EFPSA, high-school students and local volunteers. All of them play some part in achieving the main objective of the project, i.e. empowering young people to promote social inclusion and take actions towards building inclusive and peaceful societies.\n\nAfter successfully initiating the Better Together workshops in 2017, the second wave was launched between November and December 2018 with the total of 8 countries, 125 volunteers and 133 participants. The campaign was financially and educationally supported by the European Youth Foundation of the Council of Europe in the second wave. The third wave ran in the academic year 2019/20. There were 17 Local Coordinators with 206 volunteers from 10 countries involved. Due to the covid-19 pandemic, the work of LCs and their volunteers was severely affected as they had to stop working from approximately February until the end of the wave.\n\nOrganised Acts of Kindness\n\nOrganised Acts of Kindness (OAK) is one of newest campaigns from the Social Impact Initiative. It takes a step further towards the positive influence on European society by using scientific psychological methods. The campaign aims to bring people together while enhancing their well-being by encouraging individuals to take part in random acts of kindness. In contrast to the Mind the Mind and the Better Together campaigns, OAK runs solely online. It is regularly active on Facebook where it has 407 likes and on Instagram where it has 1069 followers.\n\nA Brief History of the SII\n\nOfficially, the Social Impact Initiative was launched at the 27th annual EFPSA Congress in April 2013 in Izmir, Turkey, when the General Assembly of the Congress approved the introduction of the Social Impact Task Force.\n\nDuring the Joint Executive Board and Member Representatives meeting in 2013, a workshop was organised where possible topics of Social Impact were brainstormed and discussed. It was eventually decided that the work would revolve around tackling the problem of stigma of mental disorders. The Task Force members conducted detailed research on the topic and reviewed the literature, which led to the composition and publishing of a Position Paper. One year later, the Task Force developed into a team within EFPSA, led by the Senior Coordinator. After having decided that an anti-stigma campaign would be the best way to make a positive influence on society, “Mind the Mind – To Combat the Stigma Of Mental Disorders” was launched.\n\nAt the same time as the team conducted research for the campaign, the Task Force was working on the support for the “Open Access Movement” and “Right to Research Coalition (R2RC)”, in order to raise awareness of Open Access. The project provided information on access to scientific research literature for students and young researchers and promoted advocacy of Open Access publishing. The team worked closely together with Journal of European Psychology Students (JEPS) and brought a number of texts explaining the issues published in JEPS Bulletin. Another project of the team collected the data on how accessible research is in different European countries. The activity of the team was concluded since the topic is much better covered and students are usually well aware of it and universities often promote some kind of open access strategy themselves.\n\nDuring the Joint Executive Board and Member Representatives Meeting in 2015, the team started brainstorming ideas for another project. The idea was to cover another field of psychology besides clinical and research one. The “Organised Acts of Kindness” is a project focused on encouraging people to do good deeds on a daily basis which will ultimately have a positive impact on them and society.\n\nDuring the summer of 2016 the team collaborated with EFPSA’s Training Office to apply for a European Youth Foundation grant on the topic of empowering youth towards building a more inclusive society. As a result a new campaign has started, named “Better Together” with a main focus on educating secondary-school students on topics such as intergroup relations, stereotyping and discrimination, and encouraging them to help build a more inclusive society.\n\nIn the year 2020, a global pandemic, which deeply affected all aspects of everyday life, started. As a response, in April 2020, when a new SII team was selected, the Corona Care campaign was launched online. In the same year, after a few years of consideration, the team launched on the World Suicide Prevention Day (10th of September) the (A)live! campaign. This newest campaign will firstly run online, also due to the still present pandemic, but will eventually become something bigger and more similar to the Mind the Mind and Better Together campaigns.\n\nContact\n\nShould you be interested in learning more about the EFPSA Social Impact Initiative and its activities or getting involved in any of our projects, do not hesitate to contact us using the email address socialimpact@efpsa.org.\n\nYou can follow our work and progress on the following social media pages/accounts:\n\nSocial Impact Initiative Facebook page\n\nMind the Mind Facebook page\n\nMind the Mind Instagram page\n\nBetter Together Facebook page\n\nBetter Together Instagram page\n\nOrganised Acts of Kindness Facebook page\n\nOrganised Acts of Kindness Instagram page\n\nWe welcome you, students and partners, to join us in this journey to a positive social impact!\n\nAbout the Study & Travel Abroad\n\nStudy Abroad considers its existence since the early ‘90s where it began as a project under the name “How to Study Abroad” and later on as \"Study and Work Abroad\" (SWA). Since 2005 the service has focused on “Study Abroad” (SA) and can now be found through the main website where information, advice and experience stories can be found. As of 2015, the Travel Network and the Study Abroad services have been merged into the Study & Travel Abroad (STA) service, which continues much with the same visions, missions and values as the predecessors. In 2016, the Student Exchange Responsible became part of the team, opening up the opportunity for Member Organisations and Local Organisations to receive support from EFPSA in organising their international exchanges with other psychology student associations. In 2017, the Internship Responsible also joined the service after the success of the Internship Task Force, opening the service to those who would like to go on an internship nationally or internationally. The service now has 7 roles including that of the Coordinator, Study Abroad Responsible, Travel Network Responsible, Exchanges Responsible, Internship Responsible and 2 Team Members.\n\nPlease click on the buttons below to get more information:\n\nStudy Abroad\n\nThe Study Abroad section of the service offers information about studying psychology abroad by providing guidelines, experience stories, and detailed maps.\n\nCountries\n\nAustria\n\nGeneral information\n\nStudent organization\n\nPLAST\n\nwww.plast.at\n\nMinistry of Education\n\nBundesministerium für Bildung, Wissenschaft und Kultur (Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Culture)\n\nOrganization of education system: 3 y.

So the costs for the clients will than be partly payed of the welfare system instead of the clients themselves.\n\nIn order to get authorized you have to have a work that involves a certain amount of hours containing individual assessment and intervention as well a certain amount of work with groups and organisations. You also have to be supervised and have been going to individual or group therapy. This is a costly process and not all employers are willing to pay for this. So it can take a couple of years to get the authorization. But to work as an psychologist you don’t have to be authorized, but it is a title that is secured to them who have studied the program in Denmark.\n\nList of universities/departments\n\nAalborg\n\nUniversity of Aalborg (Aalborg Universitet)\n\nDepart.: Psychology (Psykologi)\n\nWebsite: link\n\nAddress: Kroghstrade 3, Aalborg Ost, DK-9220\n\nAarhus\n\nAarhus University (Aarhus Universitet)\n\nDepart.: Psychology and Behavioural Sciences (Psykologisk Institut)\n\nWebsite: link\n\nContact: psykologi@au.dk\n\nAddress: Jens Chr.Skous Vej 4\n\n8000 Aarhus C\n\nCopenhagen\n\nCopenhagen Business School (Handelshojskolen)\n\nDepart.: Business Administration and Psychology (Erhvervsøkonomi – psykologi)\n\nWebsite: link\n\nContact: cbs@cbs.dk\n\nAddress: Dalgas Have 15\n\nCopenhagen Frederiksberg\n\nDK-2000\n\nOdense\n\nUniversity of Southern Denmark (Syddansk Universitet)\n\nDepart.: Psychology (Psykologi)\n\nWebsite: link\n\nContact: studentservice@sdu.dk\n\nAddress: Campusvej 55, Odense M, DK-5230\n\nRoskilde\n\nRoskilde University (Roskilde Universitet)\n\nDepart.: Psychology and Educational studies (Psykologi og Uddannelsesforskning)\n\nWebsite: link\n\nContact: ruc@ruc.dk\n\nAddress: Universitetsvej 1\n\nPO Box 260\n\nRoskilde\n\nDK-4000\n\nEstonia\n\nGeneral information\n\nStudent organization\n\nEPSA, the Estonian Association of Psychology Students (EPSÜ)\n\nwww.epsy.org.ee\n\nMinistry of Education\n\nEesti Vabariigi Haridus-ja Teadusminsteerium(Ministry of Education and Research)\n\nOrganization of education system: 3 y.

Malta does not as yet require a PhD to become a licensed psychologist but it is encouraged to practice.\n\nDetails: Course opens every 2 years and the number of students is dependent on the number of supervisors available to take on the students (rough estimate is 4). It s very common that persons do not get in after 2 years of working. To get in there is the minimum req of 2400 hours plus a 2:1 degree in psychology. The eligible applicants go through an interview which consists of a role play between applicant and actor with the actor playing out a scenario which is in lie with the past exp if applicant but also clinically oriented.
