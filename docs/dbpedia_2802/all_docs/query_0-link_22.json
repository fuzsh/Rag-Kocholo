        "text": "Discussion of results\n\nAs mentioned in the literature review, our research applies a multicriterial approach. It focuses on five areas of online distance instruction, each consisting of several features. The variety of features forms a didactically rich environment for designing and conducting online distance instruction. Learners had available appropriate teacher support, various types of study materials (sources), means for practising new knowledge, for assessing their performance, and they provided feedback on the process. These areas and features gave us a rather complex view of online distance instruction, which was the main contribution of the research compared to other studies that focused on single or pairs of features as mentioned below.\n\nWithin the area of teacher support, teacher–learner communication, learner training how to study online, and motivation to online distance learning are discussed. Teacher–learner communication, which is generally considered the cornerstone of the process of instruction (Prucha, 2010), was investigated by Zarzycka et al. (2021) in the process of online distance instruction. They discovered that the farther the ‘distance’ between the teacher and learner is, the higher the quality of communication is needed (2021). In practice it means, that learners expect the communication to be regular, usually following the schedule of the course. If the course is scheduled twice a week, students should be contacted with the same frequency as minimum. The same result was discovered in our research. In addition, if some barriers to communication appear, learners should be informed about the problem, including the time it can take and tasks and activities that they are to do meanwhile (Doyumğaç et al., 2021). There is also a possibility the learner starts communication with teacher; however, sometimes, the it may be beyond teacher’s capacity to carry individual communication with single learners. But, what must not be omitted is that learners should be trained how to study online distance before the instruction starts, and continuous methodological and technical support should be provided to them. He and Yang (2021) proved that technology can enhance the process of learning, motivation, attitudes, engagement, self-confidence, and many other factors. They examined a problem they call technological barriers and learning outcomes. They distinguish first-order barriers extrinsic to learners, that is, access to online distance courses, support from their provider, time for studying, training to study online, and second-order technological barriers intrinsic to learners, that is, lack of vision and belief in appropriate technology integration into teaching. Between the two barriers, there are instruction outcomes, that is, perceived progress, satisfaction, engagement, and high-order thinking (p. 94). Their results imply that learners with higher belief are those more likely to gain higher outcomes in learning online. Learners with higher vision are those more likely to gain higher engagement and high-order thinking. The more one thinks training as a barrier, the less one achieves higher outcomes. The more one thinks access a barrier, the more one achieves better satisfaction (p. 99). This concept of technological barriers is closer to motivation than to real obstacles that the non-functioning technology may cause to online distance learning, as described in our research. However, technological barriers also work to the detriment of the process. The call for motivation was detected not only by our respondents but also in researches by e.g., Bekesova et al. (2021), Cheung et al. (2021). Examining motivation should be complex, multifaced, and situation-dependent because low motivation contributes to bad study results (Deci & Ryan, 1985). As discovered a decade ago (e.g. by Hartnett et al., 2011), motivation as the mover of any activity is necessary for online distance instruction as well. A current question asked by Che Soh et al. (2022) and based on their own experience is why learners are less motivated in online distance instruction. Their findings are relevant to subjects that rely on group projects and state that learners have a high self-efficacy perception; they are confident that they can do an excellent job and receive excellent grades if they really understand the problems of the subject they study. Therefore, to acquire the learning content and understand it is very important for them. In other words, if the online distance instruction is well designed and conducted by the teacher, learners can succeed, and are motivated to further learning.\n\nRegarding the types of study materials and sources for online distance learning, Amez et al. (2021) discovered learners’ constant support to taking notes from teachers’ explanations, even if the lectures were given online. This possibility was not mentioned by our respondents at all. Moreover, recordings of full lessons were popular in the research by Amez et al. (2021), mainly for their availability any time, either for the first or repeated use. But what both groups had in common was the preference to slide shows (mostly in MS Power Point) that present or support teachers’ explanations. Contrary to this, Cheung (2021) compared the perceived usefulness of various types of open educational resources (OER) at the end of the first semester of 2019/2, when typical face-to-face instruction was held, to 2020/2021, when online learning was fully adopted. Cheung has been investigating this problem for several years. The comparison of both years showed that in 2020/2021 learners’ perception of the usefulness of OER was generally higher. In particular, it increased in open online courses, open online tutorials, open access e-book. On the other hand, learners were also interested in weaknesses of OER, for example, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the materials, and their use in online distance instruction. Another feature that was detected in our research was the use of an online platform for distance instruction. Whereas most of our respondents spoke well of MS Teams that was determined by the Ministry of Education to be a national platform for online distance instruction, in the research Cancino and Avila (2021) it was Blackboard Collaborate that was used as a fully online language environment by many universities. Compared to our multicriterial approach, their findings confirmed what had been known, that is, that poor interactions with peers had negative impact on social presence of learners and consequent interactions within teaching and learning.\n\nAccording to our research results, in practising and assessing new knowledge, online tests were rather popular. From the didactic point of view, it is more valuable if the feedback provides not only a correct answer but also an explanation and, if the answer is not correct, also a source where the learner can study the topic again. If online tests are used for assessment, the value of the test result is higher, if teachers are sure that learners worked independently, without any dishonest behaviour (Holden et al., 2021; Noorbehbahani et al., 2022). As it has been detected worldwide, there exist numerous didactic recommendations how to minimize the opportunities of such behaviour (Nguyen et al., 2020; Dendir & Maxwell, 2020). Unfortunately, cheating and plagiarism are not considered unfair in some cultures (Perkins et al., 2022). As our results prove, if learners have technical support available, they appreciate online oral exams. In the opposite case, they feel stressed of failing the system, or they make excuses on technical problems. Şenel and Şenel (2021) devoted to remote assessment in online distance instruction, in particular, they sought common assessment approaches used through the covid-19 pandemic. Results indicated that assignments were the most frequently used tools and students were generally satisfied with the quality of the assessment practices, including the formative assessment and feedback in remote assessment. The research focuses on technical subjects and does not clearly define how the assignments look like. In our research, assignments (single tasks) were not set. In English language either vocabulary and grammar online tests were used for practising and assessment, medical knowledge was monitored by didactic tests, learners did individual or group projects or presentations in all courses. The testing was conducted during the semester, projects and presentations had individualized deadlines for each learner or group of learners. In our opinion, it is not crucial to apply a wide range of methods to assess learner’s work in the course. If the learner has experience in the method of assessment and its shortcomings, they can meet the requirements more successfully, that is, they can focus on the content, not on the format. This approach is emphasized by Jayawardena et al. (2021) who analyzed the effectiveness of various online assessment types in relation to the methods of content delivery.\n\nThe final part of our research, respondents’ feedback, is what makes the view of the online distance instruction complex. In addition to our research, where respondents provided feedback on four statements dealing with teacher’s effort, student’s effort, their appreciation of online distance instruction, and how much they learned online distance using the Likert scale, Fidalgo et al. (2020) conducted another, rather complex survey in three states, Portugal, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the Ukraine. They investigated learners’ perceptions, attitudes, and willingness to learn online distance, and based on the results they provided guidance and recommendations for higher education institutions. Although the study monitors the state before the covid-19 pandemic, the results can be applied to the situation during and after the pandemic. Open-schedule courses, followed by blended synchronous learning, were preferred by the respondents; however, Portuguese learners had little experience in distance learning compared to other states, which might explain their positive attitude. In the UAE, most online distance courses have not been accredited by the Ministry of Education (United Arab Emirates Ministry of Education, 2016), which may result in lack of experience in UAE learners and their inability to judge this type of instruction. Ukrainian students reported a high level of confidence in operating technological devices. The reason for this may be, in part, a high level of requirements in the state curriculum. The main reasons why student enrolled in online distance courses were time management, self-regulation, and higher retention rates, as also supported by other studies, e.g., Bradley et al. (2017), Peck et al. (2018). Having more control of their study time is also one of the benefits of online distance instruction (Alshmari, 2017). Regarding the reasons for not enrolling in online distance courses, respondents from the three countries mentioned difficulty in contacting teachers and peers. They all preferred face-to-face lessons. They were afraid they would lose a familiar type of interaction and have to engage with classroom participants in a new and different way. Fidalgo et al. also noted that Portuguese and UAE students were prospective teachers trained for face-to-face teaching so they may not have understood the potential of fully online distance format and did not expect to use it in their professional careers. This conclusion clearly shows that before 2020, hardly anybody could imagine a two-year long period of online distance instruction. A lack of motivation was another reason why learners did not prefer to enrol in online distance courses. It was likely connected with a lack of experience in online distance learning and confidence with their ability to learn online distance. However, this is in contrast to controlling their study time. Strong personal discipline is needed if one wants to manage their own time. Identical contrast appeared in our research, when some students were satisfied with learning from home; they spent less time on learning but the time was spent usefully, it was not wasted, and they had more time for their hobbies and friends, although in most cases the socializing took place in the virtual world only. Contrary to this, other respondents complained, they were not able to concentrate on learning, they spent hours in front on the computer doing nothing because they were not able to, they did not understand the task, they needed didactic or technical help etc. From the view of didactics, the most important topic was the training of learners for how to study online. As mentioned in our research, learners were briefly trained by teachers before the new academic year started. While our teachers trained learners how to use tools of MS Teams for conducting online distance learning, where to find the syllabus of the course, where and how to conduct communication, where to find study materials, exercises, and online tests, how to assess learners’ knowledge etc., Fidalgo et al. (2020) called this area ‘computer skills’. It means that their respondents were not sure whether they could manage the tools to conduct online distance lessons that were taught in English language—none of them was an English native speaker. Some learners from all countries were not sure whether they are able to succeed in acquiring the learning content under these conditions. In agreement with our results, the need for help (both didactic and technical), and training are some of the concerns that respondents reported. Similar criteria were used by Gopal et al. (2021) or Maatuk et al. (2022): quality of teacher, quality of course design, teacher’s prompt feedback, and student’s expectations. These criteria form perceived satisfaction with the course and perceived performance of the learner. The findings indicate that the quality of the teacher is the most important factor that affects students’ satisfaction during online classes. Teachers must understand students’ psychology, be enthusiastic, continuously motivate the learners, and provide them with feedback, which satisfies learners and enables teachers to improve the courses in the future. These results show that if TP(A)CK framework is followed, online distance instruction can be acceptable and useful to the learner.\n\nFrom the point of view of works mentioned in the introduction, the process of acquiring of new knowledge was examined by Lim et al. (2022). They focused on the effect of active learning in dental students. In particular, they examined four group of students, each learning in a pre-defined way. In group 1, lectures and discussions were held; in group 2, lectures and discussions were conducted with instructor’s worksheet; in group 3, self-study and discussion were applied; in group 4, self-study was supported by discussions with the instructor’s worksheet. Final test scores underwent the analysis of variance and showed the best results in the group that learned through self-study and discussion, followed by the group using self-study and discussion with instructor’s worksheet. This result can be connected in students’ call for communication (see Table , communication in groups, and hypothesis H01 Teachers’ support for learners within ODI). Another investigation of nursing students’ performance was made by Chen et al. (2022). They compared network (online distance) and traditional (in-class) teaching. The analysis of the performance did not show significant differences. Therefore, they propose to combine these two approaches even in the times when the covid-19 restrictions are cancelled. This conclusion which is also in compliance with our recommendations. Contrary to this, mind maps were not mentioned in our research. However, Alsuraihi (2022), who focused on their used during the covid-19 pandemic, examined a group of medical students and proved that mind maps contributed to the effectiveness of online teaching and students’ satisfaction with it. Students believed that they developed skills of organizing, planning, decision making, and critical thinking, when working with mind maps. Besides knowledge, the feelings and motivation are of the same importance in learning. Using the Big Five Inventory, Challenge and Hindrance Stress Scale, and the Online Student Engagement Scale, Quigley et al. (2022) discovered that conscientiousness positively affected all types of online engagement; extraversion influenced participation and performance, neuroticism predicted engagement skills, emotional engagement and performance, agreeableness and openness to experience impacted participation and emotional engagement. Contrary to these, stress perceived as a hindrance negatively predicted performance. These results are in agreement with other works mentioned below. Exceptionally, mild stress can work as a motivator (Morgado & Cerqueira, 2018). However, covid-19 distress required the competency of self-regulated learning (Hadwin et al., 2022). If developed in learners, it impacted academic performance and success in learning. It had been proved in the past that self-regulated learning was a better predictor of online learning effectiveness. Whether it worked under the covid-19 restrictions was investigated by He et al. (2022). They considered three stages of self-regulated learning—the preparátory stage, the performance stage, and the appraisal. The results suggest that better performance in the three stages decreases learners’ perceived ineffectiveness in online learning. The lack of self-regulation/autonomy was also mentioned by respondents in our research in final four items in each part of the questionnaire). As a consequence, they mentioned problems with time management and planning the work, with finding additional sources to study from, critical assessment of collected information etc."
