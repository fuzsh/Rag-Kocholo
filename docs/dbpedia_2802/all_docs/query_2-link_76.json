Foundation of the institute in April 2002 is a logical consequence of the award of project of research center „Mechanism, ecophysiology and biotechnology of photosynthesis\" to a consortium of University of South Bohemia with several institutes of the Academy of Science of the Czech Republic, namely Institute of Plant Molecular Biology, Institute of Microbiology, Institute of Landscape Ecology and Ostrava University. Research and applied infrastructure will be complemented by building of the Nove Hrady Bio-technology center sponsored by PHARE CBC project in 2004. As a result of that, IPB-USB and the whole town of Nove Hrady will become a meeting point of University, Academy of Science and contemporary biotechnology with little comparison in the whole country.\n\nInstitute of History of the University of South Bohemia\n\nAdress: Jeronymova 10, CZ-371 15 Ceske Budejovice\n\nPhone: +420 387 773 068\n\nFax: +420 387 312 194\n\nThe Institute of History of the University of South Bohemia is a scientific-pedagogical workplace which was established as a result of an inner transformation of the then Department of History of the Faculty of Pedagogy of the University of South Bohemia. From 1997 to 2002 the Institute was a part of the organizational structure of the Faculty. From January 1, 2003 the Institute of History will be a part of the structure of the University of South Bohemia.\n\nThe Institute benefits from its location in the region of Czech-Moravian-Austrian-Bavarian borderland, which is also reflected in the orientation of its scientific work. Academic workers of the of the Institute understand the cultural wealth of archives, libraries and objects of heritage in region as a possible base for solving theoretical questions of historical science of European importance.\n\nFor many years the scholarly work of the Institute has been systematically focused on extensive fundamental research in the historical topics such as early modern society /with the emphasis on the social and cultural history of aristocratic elites/, everyday culture from the Middle Ages to the beginning of the 20th century, the history of upper social classes in the 19th and early 20th century, Czech-French relations, positivistic historiography, cultural personalities of the South Bohemia region and changes in the cultural atmosphere of this region.\n\nAbout the University\n\nHistory\n\nThe University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice was established by the proclamation of the Bill of the Czech National Council No. 314/1991 Col. which came into effect on 28 September 1991. This new educational institution came into existence through the joining of two previously existing faculties: The Pedagogical Faculty in Ceské Budejovice and the Faculty of Agronomy of the Agricultural University in Prague. Following the Academic Senate approval of 11 November 1991, other faculties of biology, theology, health and social care were added, and on 1 September 1994 the Faculty of Management located in Jindnichuv Hradec was also added to these two founding faculties. The latter of the above-mentioned faculties was transferred to the University of Economy in Prague on 1 January 1998. The university seal shows the Czech lion holding in its fore paws a shield in the middle of which there is a rose of the old South Bohemian House of Rosenberg. This points out the intentions of the university to follow the old educational South Bohemian tradition.\n\nBrief Description\n\nUniversity of South Bohemia is distinct from other Czech universities in its unusual combination of faculties and its curriculum structure which blends with that of various institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences. A general contract between the Czech Academy of Sciences and the University was signed in 1996. It established conditions for interdisciplinary studies backed by a quality scientific research base. The university’s activities influence the development in the whole South Bohemian region.\n\nThe university offers accreditation in bachelor, engineering, and master’s degree programs, as well as in some selected doctorate studies. University South Bohemia student population is around 5.500. Nearly 1.000 employees work here. The university provides accommodation for about 40% of its students. Nutritional quality meals are offered to both the students and the staff in modern cafeteria. The university also keeps spacious sporting grounds."
