        "text": "Why did you choose to go to Ostrava, Czech Republic?\n\nIts geographical location is great, it has three main airports and other smaller ones nearby, which means you can do lots of travelling.\n\nIt's also known for its party scene!\n\nHow long did your scholarship last? How much were you paid?\n\nFrom September to June. In terms of money, it all depends on what autonomous community you come from. The southern communities tend to get given a larger grant!\n\nWhat's the student life like in Ostrava?\n\nGreat! The University of Ostrava offers quite a flexible Erasmus programme. You only have some classes shared with Czech students (the others are only with Erasmus students), and they're quite easy-going. The university life we have in Spain doesn't really exist here, though. The structure of the days is very different.\n\nThere are always people in the bars if you want to go out for a drink, except for on Sundays - then it's dead!\n\nWould you recommend the city and University of Ostrava to other students?\n\nOf course! Coming to Ostrava was the best decision I've ever made!\n\nWhat's the food like in Ostrava?\n\nThere's everything, though it all depends on how picky you are, doesn't it? :) Most Erasmus students live in student halls and cook for themselves there... so, you'll end up eating whatever you fancy, which isn't a bad thing at all.\n\nThe prices are all cheap, and if you decide to go out to a restaurant in the city centre, you can get good food for good prices!\n\nHow did you find your accommodation?\n\nThe University of Ostrava assigned us accommodation according to what subject we were studying.\n\nWhat are the accommodation prices like? How expensive is Ostrava in general?\n\nMy hall of residence (Vitkovice), of middle quality, cost 80 to 90 euros a month in rent.\n\nEating in the university cafeteria cost 1 or 2 euros (so 30 to 40 Czech korona) for lunch or dinner.\n\nBeer costs around 1 to 1. 50 euros per litre (so 25 to 30 Czech korona).\n\nI think I've mentioned all the most important things there... haha.\n\nHow are you finding the language? Have you signed up to a language class at the university?\n\nThe university offers summer language courses in Czech, but I don't think my grant quite stretched to cover that... I myself didn't go to any classes. There are Czech language courses on offer during the academic year though. Although they're not that useful as the language really is very difficult, they do help you with basic Czech survival skills.\n\nWhat's the cheapest way of getting to Ostrava from your home city?\n\nFrom Cordoba, there are two ways of getting there: one is flying from MÃ¡laga to Bratislava with Ryanair, which is cheap but doesn't offer you much in terms of hand luggage allowance, let alone two suitcases. You can then catch the train to Ostrava from Bratislava, which stops (I think) at Brno too (you can ask about this at the ticket offices).\n\nThe other option is to fly from Madrid to Katowice with Wizzair with a 32kg baggage allowance. Katowice is also closer to Ostrava.\n\nWhat are the best places for partying in Ostrava?\n\nThe main party area is Stodolni Street. Every bar has got something good to offer... try them all!\n\nWhat about eating out in Ostrava? What are your favourite places?\n\nGenerally, everywhere is nice. There's a pizzeria near the main square which I liked, and a restaurant called U Rady.\n\nWhat does Ostrava have to offer in terms of culture?\n\nOn the city's official website, there's a list of the most interesting places to visit in Ostrava. I won't write all the name down here as it's impossible to remember them all.;)\n\nDo you have any advice for future students coming to Ostrava?"
