The paper will focus on the workers’ religious and national identification and changes in today’s Ostrava region – an industrial region (the centre of Czechoslovak heavy industry) situated on the ethnic borderline and in the melting pot of many nationalities (Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, Germans and Jews). It will analyse the interactions between class and the religious and national identification of workers. It will try to clarify the process and the motivation to convert between different churches. Special attention will be given to conversions among the working class population in the 1920s and 1930s. This analysis will be based on conversion protocols, census documents from 1921 and 1930 and ecclesiastical files of the Roman Catholic and Czechoslovak church.\n\nThe declaration of the new Czechoslovak national state in October 1918 brought revolutionary changes not only to the political, social, economic and cultural scene, but also to the religious life of the country.

Author explores the various processes which culminated in Roman Catholicism drastically falling in both position and status in the modern Czech culture, society, and state. A powerful state church and respected social institution with extensive symbolic prestige at the beginning of the 19th century, the Czech Catholic Church succumbed to mass secularization throughout the second half of the same century. This historically development was further reinforced by the rise of totalitarian ideologies, thus rendering a privileged and self-confident national church a problematic, humiliated, barely tolerated and, for much of the 20th century, brutally persecuted community.\n\nThe study deals with the analysis of the religious situation in Czech society after 1989. The starting point is the analysis of the broader historical and sociopolitical context. The study itself examines an analysis of the key census data from 1991, 2001, and 2011, together with the results of research explicitly focused on the religion and religious behavior of the Czech population. These are mainly international studies , such as the EVS, ISSP or AUFBRUCH, and Czech research in the field of DIN. The study also includes an identification of topics and problems that have not yet been sufficiently explored in the context of studying the relationship between religion and contemporary Czech society.\n\nA powerful state church and respected social institution with extensive symbolic prestige at the beginning of the 19th century, the Czech Catholic Church succumbed to widespread secularization throughout the second half of the same century. This historical development was further reinforced by the rise of totalitarian ideologies, thus rendering a privileged and self-confident national church a problematic, humiliated, barely tolerated and, for much of the 20th century, brutally persecuted community. The aim of the lecture is to offer several general reflections on the historical roots and the possible causes of secularization in Bohemia, in particular how such a near-total abandonment of religious practice in organized churches in this country compared to all its central European neighbors. A better appreciation of the concrete genesis of secularization in various historical contexts can shed light on how to deal with contemporary society’s attitude toward religion and religions.\n\nHistory of the academic study of religion in Slovakia represents one of the main models of its establishment that one can witness in many Central and Eastern European countries, where the principal role has been exercised by theologians or philosophers, sociologists, and ethnographers influenced by modern theology. Yet at the same time the story of Slovak study of religion serves as a fitted example for a complicated and ambiguous relationship between religion, its theoretical reflection, and specific social and cultural phenomena and processes, the first among which being national emancipation and creation of a national identity in a modern meaning of the term. The individual history of an academy-based study of religion in Slovakia, which as far as we have seen reaches into the latter part of the 20th century, can be divided into three main periods: pre-formative (until 1945), formative (1945 – 1992), and institutionally-systematizing period (since 1992).
