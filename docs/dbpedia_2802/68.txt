University Library

This institution has a physical Library.

V�B - Technick� univerzita Ostrava Library's Offerings:

Books:

The library's extensive collection of books is accessible through the online Library catalogue, which provides details for a significant portion of our collection. For earlier documents, patrons should refer to the card catalogues, located in the Circulation Department, holding information on pre-1995 books. Books are stored either in the library's stacks or are available on open shelves. To facilitate access, books are organized by subject using the Universal Decimal Classification system, which is the Czech version of the UDC Consortium's classification system. Patrons are advised to use the catalogue for efficient book retrieval.

E-books:

The Central Library offers a collection of electronic books with perpetual access. For more information, please visit the E-books page.

Rare Book Collection:

Our library houses an archival collection of rare and older books and periodicals, primarily focused on subjects such as geology, mining, physics, chemistry, mathematics, and metallurgy. These items were acquired through purchase and gifts during the 19th and early 20th centuries by the Mining Academy in Pribram. The collection includes notable works, including the oldest book in our historical collection, Georgii Agricolae De re Metallica Libri XII from 1561. Patrons can request access to these books and periodicals, with approval required from a university librarian for books printed before 1801.

Journals:

Our collection of journals, also known as periodicals or serials, is for reference use within the library and is non-borrowable. To check if we subscribe to a specific journal, patrons can use the search option in the online catalogue. Current journals, from the past two years, are located in library study rooms, arranged alphabetically by title. Older volumes are available for reading in the Circulation Department. Patrons can make photocopies or electronic copies of needed articles using library services.

Electronic Journals:

For access to full-text journals available to V�B-TUO staff and students, please consult the List of e-resources, sorted by type, under the "E-journals" section.

Access policy of theses and dissertations:
