        "text": "Please note: This page is about your weight before getting pregnant. If you’re already pregnant and want to lose weight it’s important to talk to your GP or a dietitian first.\n\nMost people know that being overweight or obese increases the risk of health problems such as heart disease and diabetes. But many are unaware that this can also reduce fertility and the chance of having a healthy baby.\n\nIf you are trying to get pregnant, or plan to start trying, the closer you are to a healthy weight, the greater your chance of conceiving (getting pregnant) and having a healthy baby.\n\nIdeal weight for conception varies\n\nThe ideal weight for conception depends on how tall you are. Your body mass index (BMI) is a number based on your height and weight. The healthy BMI range is between 18.5 and 24.9. Adults with a BMI between 25 and 29 are considered overweight and a BMI over 30 indicates obesity. You can find out what your BMI is using our BMI tool.\n\nOverweight and fertility in women\n\nBeing an unhealthy weight can affect a woman’s fertility by causing:\n\nhormonal imbalances\n\nproblems with ovulation (releasing an egg from the ovaries)\n\nmenstrual disorders.\n\nIt can also lead to difficulties with assisted reproduction, such as in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), ovulation induction and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).\n\nObesity is also associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common cause of low fertility or infertility.\n\nOverweight and fertility in men\n\nBeing very overweight or obese can also reduce a man’s fertility. This is likely due to a combination of factors including:\n\nhormone problems\n\nproblems with erection\n\nother health conditions linked to obesity.\n\nWeight loss in men who are overweight or obese can improve total sperm count and quality. Reaching a healthier weight at least 3 months before conception can improve the chance of conception. This is because sperm take about 3 months to develop and being in the healthy weight range during this time helps develop healthy sperm.\n\nOverweight and pregnancy health\n\nGetting closer to a healthy weight before conception increases the chance of the baby being healthy at birth and into adulthood.\n\nObesity and excess weight gain during pregnancy is also linked with a number of pregnancy complications. These include increased risk of:\n\nmiscarriage\n\nhigh blood pressure\n\npre-eclampsia\n\ngestational diabetes\n\ncaesarean birth\n\nstillbirth.\n\nBabies born to mothers who have obesity have an increased risk of childhood and adult obesity and other long-term health problems.\n\nWhile the facts about obesity and reproductive outcomes can seem daunting, there is some good news. In women who live with obesity, even a small weight loss improves fertility and pregnancy health. Also, some diet and lifestyle changes that limit excessive weight gain during pregnancy can improve health outcomes for both mother and baby.\n\nGetting ready for pregnancy\n\nIf you are planning to get pregnant, starting a healthy eating and exercise plan now improves your chances of getting pregnant and having a healthy baby. By making healthy changes to your diet and increasing your daily physical activity, you’ll be taking steps toward reaching a more healthy weightExternal Link . This is also important when using IVF and other assisted reproductive technologies (ART).\n\nStudies have found that obesity reduces the rate of pregnancy and live births in women using ART, and increases the risk of miscarriage. But weight loss through diet, lifestyle and other changes significantly improves these outcomes.\n\nAsk your doctor about any dietary supplements you may need, such as folic acid and iodine.\n\nTips for a healthier weight before pregnancy\n\nTry these steps to a healthier weight:\n\nFollow a healthy balanced diet drawn from the 5 food groups: vegetables and legumes; fruits; wholegrain bread and cereals; milk, yoghurt, cheese and alternatives; lean meat, poultry, fish, eggs, seeds and nuts.\n\nCut back on discretionary foods (including chips, biscuits, fatty meats, pastries, cakes, fast foods and confectionary) and only eat them in small amounts.\n\nEat regular meals and limit unhealthy snacking.\n\nSwap sugary drinks and alcohol for water.\n\nMake half your plate vegetables at lunch and dinner.\n\nUse a smaller plate to help reduce your portion sizes.\n\nGet moving every day. Fit in regular physical activity like walking to the shops, taking the stairs and walking with a friend.\n\nSpend less time sitting by getting up regularly while using a computer or mobile device, and swapping screen time for other activities.\n\nSet a realistic weight goal. It can help you feel motivated and active. Aiming for weight loss of half to one kilogram per week until you reach your target weight is a good goal.\n\nStart a healthy eating and exercise plan together with your partner to increase the chance of getting pregnant and having a healthy baby.\n\nMaking these changes will make a difference to your overall health, even if they don’t lead to weight loss. Begin making these changes before you start trying to conceive, and keep them up throughout your pregnancy and beyond.\n\nRemember, if you’re already pregnant and want to lose weight it’s important to talk to your GP or a dietitian first, before you start making any lifestyle changes.\n\nUnderweight and fertility\n\nBeing underweight (BMI under 18.5) can reduce a woman’s fertility by causing hormone imbalances that affect ovulation and the chance of getting pregnant. Compared to women in the healthy weight range, women who are underweight are more likely to take more than a year to get pregnant.\n\nIf you are underweight and trying to conceive, a dietitian can work with you to change your diet and help you put on weight.\n\nWhere to get help"
