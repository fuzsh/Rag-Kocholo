        "text": "What is liver failure?\n\nYour liver is one of your essential organs, one you can’t live without. It performs hundreds of important bodily functions. When your liver fails to keep up with its many jobs, your overall health will fail, too. This is liver failure. It means that your liver is no longer able to function adequately for your body’s needs.\n\nLiver failure is a process, which may be fast or slow. Acute liver failure happens rapidly, within days or weeks. Chronic liver failure, the more common type, happens gradually, over months or years. As your liver begins to lose its functionality, you’ll notice more and more the symptoms of liver failure.\n\nWhat is acute liver failure?\n\nAcute liver failure happens suddenly, when something overwhelms your liver’s capacity to cope. It’s usually a large toxic load, like poisoning. Sometimes, it’s a severe viral infection. In acute liver failure, your liver rapidly begins to shut down, causing immediate symptoms. This is a medical emergency.\n\nWhat is chronic liver failure?\n\nChronic liver failure is the end stage of chronic liver disease. It happens when something has been damaging your liver for a long time, and the damage has finally become irreversible. Chronic liver failure follows cirrhosis, severe scarring of your liver tissues. Scar tissue prevents your liver from functioning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n\nWhat are the stages of liver failure?\n\nMost medical authorities define chronic liver failure as the end stage of chronic liver disease. Liver disease can progress through several stages. However, it’s important to remember that these stages aren’t discreet from each other. Someone with fibrosis (scarring) can still have inflammation (hepatitis):\n\nHepatitis. Hepatitis is inflammation in your liver. When chronic liver disease begins to cause chronic hepatitis, the process of long-term damage begins. Inflammation is meant to start the healing process in your liver tissues. But persistent inflammation leads to scarring (fibrosis).\n\nFibrosis. Fibrosis is a type of scarring in your tissues, a result of chronic inflammation. Fibrosis is progressive. Thin bands of fibrous tissue gradually stiffen your liver as they add up. It’s also reversible to an extent. Your liver cells can regenerate and recover if the inflammation stops.\n\nCirrhosis. Cirrhosis is when you have so much scarring in your liver that it’s no longer reversible. Your liver has powerful regenerative properties, but it needs a certain amount of healthy tissue to work with. Cirrhosis is permanent, but you can still slow or stop the process at this stage.\n\nLiver failure. Chronic liver failure begins when cirrhosis has impaired your liver’s ability to carry out its necessary functions. As its functions begin to fail, complications develop throughout your body. Chronic liver failure isn’t rapid, but it’s eventually fatal without a liver transplant.\n\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of liver failure?\n\nYou may notice different signs and symptoms of liver failure based on how advanced it is and which complications have begun to occur. The first symptoms of chronic or acute liver failure may include:\n\nAbdominal pain (especially in the upper right).\n\nFatigue and malaise (feeling unwell).\n\nNausea, vomiting and loss of appetite.\n\nSymptoms more specific to liver disease may appear after these. The first warning signs of a damaged liver that’s starting to fail are signs of bile and other toxins building up in your blood. These may include:\n\nJaundice (yellow tint to the whites of your eyes and skin).\n\nHepatic encephalopathy (altered mental status).\n\nPruritus (itchy skin, but with no visible rash).\n\nDark-colored pee (urine) and/or light-colored poop (stool).\n\nChronic liver failure may also show up in subtler ways, like:\n\nEasy bleeding and bruising (coagulopathy).\n\nVisible blood vessels that look like spiders or like a rash of tiny dots.\n\nSmall, yellow bumps of fat deposits on your skin or eyelids.\n\nDigestive difficulties, especially with fats.\n\nWeight loss and muscle loss.\n\nMusty-smelling breath.\n\nOther serious signs of liver failure include:\n\nAscites (abdominal swelling with fluid).\n\nEdema (swelling with fluid in your ankles, feet, hands or face).\n\nVomiting blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds.\n\nMotor dysfunction (twitching, tremors or lapses in muscle control).\n\nLow urine output.\n\nShortness of breath.\n\nDoes liver failure cause different symptoms for a woman (AFAB) or a man (AMAB)?\n\nLiver failure can affect your sex hormones, leading to an imbalance of estrogen and testosterone. This may cause different symptoms in a woman (assigned female at birth) or a man (assigned male at birth). Menstrual cycles may become irregular or stop. Testicles may shrink and breast tissue may enlarge in people assigned male at birth.\n\nWhat does liver failure feel like?\n\nLiver failure will cause toxins to flood your bloodstream, which feels pretty terrible. When your liver can’t filter toxins from your blood anymore, you’ll feel nauseous, tired and weak. Toxins may also infiltrate your brain, causing confusion, irritability, anxiety, drowsiness or motor dysfunction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat causes liver failure?\n\nAcute and chronic liver failure happen in different ways, but they’re both due to overwhelming stress on your liver. Some of the same toxins and diseases can stress your liver all at once or gradually over time, depending on how severe they are. Other causes of liver failure only happen suddenly or gradually.\n\nAcute liver failure causes\n\nAcute liver failure usually occurs in people with no prior history of liver disease. It happens when something overwhelmingly injures your liver. This might be an overwhelming toxic load that your liver encounters as it’s filtering your blood. It can also be an acute infection that attacks your liver directly.\n\nCauses include:\n\nViral infections, including viral hepatitis A, B, D and E. Less commonly, Epstein-Barr Virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella zoster virus or herpes simplex virus may cause it.\n\nDrug overdoses. Acetaminophen overdose is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the U.S. Other medications that may cause it in overdose include NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and certain antibiotics.\n\nPregnancy complications. Rare but serious pregnancy complications can overwhelm your liver, including acute fatty liver of pregnancy, preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome.\n\nGenetic disorders. Certain inherited liver diseases may cause acute liver failure if they go untreated, including autoimmune hepatitis and Wilson disease.\n\nMiscellaneous causes. Mushroom poisoning, metastatic cancer, septic shock or heatstroke may trigger acute liver failure.\n\nChronic liver failure causes\n\nChronic liver failure is the result of cirrhosis. The scarring process prevents blood and oxygen from nourishing your liver tissues, causing cell death. As liver cells die, your liver functions less and less. Cirrhosis is the result of long-term hepatitis, which many chronic liver diseases can cause.\n\nThese include:\n\nChronic infections. Viral hepatitis infections that become chronic can cause chronic hepatitis, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C.\n\nChronic alcohol use. Heavy alcohol use can cause alcohol-induced hepatitis. If this becomes a chronic condition, it can cause cirrhosis and liver failure.\n\nToxic hepatitis. Chronic overexposure to toxins such as industrial chemicals or drugs can cause chronic hepatitis.\n\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. In some people, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease leads to chronic hepatitis.\n\nBile duct obstruction. Congenital (present at birth) conditions that obstruct your bile ducts can cause bile to build up and injure your liver, including biliary atresia and cystic fibrosis. Non-congenital causes include biliary stricture and gallstones.\n\nAutoimmune disease. Autoimmune hepatitis and autoimmune cholangitis (primary biliary cholangitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis) can lead to cirrhosis.\n\nInherited metabolic disorders. Disorders such as glycogen storage disease, Wilson disease, hemochromatosis and Gaucher disease that cause toxic products to build up in your blood can cause chronic liver damage.\n\nCardiovascular diseases. Conditions that affect blood flow to and from your liver, including Budd-Chiari syndrome, arterial diseases and right-sided heart failure can cause chronic liver damage.\n\nWhat are the complications or effects of liver failure?\n\nYour liver performs many important functions, supporting many different body systems. When these begin to fail, you’ll notice the effects throughout your body. For example, you might notice:\n\nGeneral toxicity, feeling ill, tired, foggy or confused.\n\nToxins interfering with your brain, nerves and motor functions.\n\nDigestive difficulties, malabsorption and malnutrition.\n\nReduced blood clotting, easy bleeding and bruising.\n\nReduced immunity and frequent infections.\n\nIn addition to these effects, many people with chronic liver failure already have complications from cirrhosis. Cirrhosis causes the side effect of portal hypertension, which in turn can cause:\n\nFluid leakage, edema and ascites, a risk for peritonitis.\n\nGastrointestinal varices and acute gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\nEnlarged and overactive spleen that removes too many blood cells.\n\nLow blood oxygen levels via hepatopulmonary syndrome.\n\nChronic kidney failure via hepatorenal syndrome.\n\nComplications of portal hypertension are the most frequent causes of hospitalization and death in people with chronic liver failure, and many of these can begin before chronic liver failure starts."
