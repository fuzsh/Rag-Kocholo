        "text": "What Are Stomach Ulcers?\n\nStomach ulcers, also known as peptic ulcers, are open sores in the lining of your stomach or the upper part of your small intestine. The ulcer forms when stomach acid eats away at the mucus that protects the lining of your digestive tract.\n\nÂ\n\nTypes of peptic ulcers\n\nGastric ulcer: It occurs when a sore forms in the lining of your stomach.\n\nDuodenal ulcer: This happens when a sore develops in the upper part of your intestine.\n\nEsophageal ulcer: This is when a sore forms in the lining of your esophagus, which is the tube that carries food and liquid from your throat to your stomach.\n\nAbout 1 in 10 Americans experience the burning, gnawing abdominal pain of a peptic ulcer at some point in life. Duodenal ulcers are more common than stomach ulcers. Esophageal ulcers are more rare and are often a result of certain medications, such as some antibiotics and anti-inflammatories, or alcohol abuse.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nCauses of Stomach Ulcers\n\nUntil the mid-1980s, the conventional wisdom was that ulcers form as a result of stress, being prone to excessive stomach acid secretion because of genetics, and poor lifestyle habits (including overindulging in rich and fatty foods, alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco). It was believed that such factors could lead to a buildup of stomach acids that could erode the protective lining of the stomach, duodenum, or esophagus.\n\nWhile too much stomach acid secretion certainly plays a role in the development of ulcers, a relatively recent theory holds that bacterial infection is the primary cause of peptic ulcers. Research since the mid-1980s has shown that the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is present in more than 90% of duodenal ulcers and about 80% of stomach ulcers. However, more recent figures indicate those percentages are declining.\n\nMost people infected with H. pylori do not get ulcers. But in others, it can raise the amount of acid, break down the protective mucus layer, and irritate the digestive tract. Experts arenât sure howÂ an H. pylori infection spreads. They think it may pass from person to person through close contact, suchÂ as kissing. You may also get it from unclean food and water.\n\nOther factors also seem to contribute to ulcer formation, especially in someone with an H. pylori infection, including:\n\nOveruse of over-the-counter painkillers (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen). If youâve been takingÂ aspirin often and for a long time, youâre more likely to get aÂ peptic ulcer. The same is true for other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). They includeÂ ibuprofen andÂ naproxen. NSAIDs block your body from making a chemical that helps protect the inner walls of your stomach and small intestine from stomach acid. Other types of pain meds, such asÂ acetaminophen, wonât lead to peptic ulcers.\n\nHeavy alcohol use\n\nPsychological stress\n\nSmoking\n\nYour risk for peptic ulcers also increases if you:\n\nUse steroids and have high calcium levels. If you use steroids often and have high levels of calcium in your blood, known as hypercalcemia, you can be more prone to ulcers.\n\nAre older. Studies show that stomach ulcers are more likely to develop in older people. This may be because arthritis is prevalent in older people, and easing arthritis pain can mean taking daily doses of aspirin or ibuprofen. Also, with advancing age, the pylorus (the valve between the stomach and duodenum) relaxes and allows extra bile (a compound produced in the liver to aid in digestion) to seep up into the stomach and erode the stomach lining.\n\nHave type A blood. For an unknown reason, people with type A blood are more likely to develop cancerous stomach ulcers.\n\nHave type O blood. Duodenal ulcers tend to appear in people with type O blood, possibly because they do not produce the substance on the surface of blood cells that may protect the lining of the duodenum.\n\nHave Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. If you have Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which is a rare condition where tumors in your pancreas or duodenum (called gastrinomas) cause your stomach to make too much acid, you are at a greater risk of developing peptic ulcers.\n\nStomach Ulcer Symptoms\n\nYouâll most likely feel a burning pain or discomfort between your belly button and breastbone. You might especially notice it on an empty stomach, such as between meals or at night. TheÂ pain may stop for a little while if you take an antacid, but it may return. The pain can last a few minutes or a few hours and may come and go for many days or weeks.\n\nOther symptoms may include:\n\nFeeling easily full\n\nNot wanting to eat because of pain\n\nHeartburn\n\nAcid reflux\n\nChest pain\n\nFatigue\n\nBloated feeling\n\nBurping\n\nLack of appetite or weight loss\n\nNausea\n\nBloody or darkÂ poop\n\nVomiting that might contain blood or look like coffee grounds\n\nAnemia\n\nPain that may improve when you eat, drink, or take antacids\n\nSmall ulcers may not cause any symptoms. But if you notice any of these signs, talk to your doctor.\n\nHow Are Stomach Ulcers Diagnosed?\n\nIf your doctor thinks you might have a peptic ulcer, theyâll probably start with a physical exam and some tests:\n\nTheyâll feel your belly and ask if youâve had things such as tenderness, pain, or bloating. They might use a stethoscope to listen to any sounds your stomach is making.\n\nThe next step will be tests to look for signs of the H. pylori bacteria. Your doctor may take samples of your blood, stool, or breath for these.\n\nIn some cases, especially if youâre older and your symptoms include things such as weight loss or loss of appetite, they might use a long, flexible tube called an endoscope to look down your throat and into your stomach for signs of an ulcer (youâll be given medicine to make you sleepy). An endoscope can also take a small sample of tissue from an ulcer that can be tested in a laboratory.\n\nThey might ask you to drink a milky liquid called barium before they take X-rays of your stomach. This drink coats your digestive system and makes problems such as ulcers show up more clearly.\n\nStomach Ulcer Treatment\n\nIf you have a peptic ulcer, your doctor will recommend a treatment plan based on whatâs causing it.\n\nThe most common remedy is a combination of antibiotic drugs to kill the H. pylori bacteria and medications to get rid of acid in your stomach. These typically include proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as Aciphex or Nexium, and antibiotics. Youâll take PPIs for several weeks. There are other treatment options.\n\nIf your ulcer is caused by over-the-counter painkillers, youâll need to quit taking them.\n\nYour doctor may give you a drug called a cytoprotective agent, which coats ulcers to protect them from stomach acid.\n\nYour health care provider may also give you antacids to fight stomach acid or prescribe medicine to lessen the acid your body makes.\n\nHistamine receptor blockers, also known as H2 blockers, reduce the amount of acid produced in the stomach.\n\nProbiotics might help slow the growth of H. pylori.Â\n\nBismuth supplements can also slow the growth of H. pylori.Â\n\nAlso, lifestyle changes can serve as a treatment for stomach ulcers. You might need to:\n\nQuit smoking.\n\nDrink less alcohol or caffeine.\n\nStay away from foods that make your symptoms worse.\n\nIf your ulcers donât improve with medication or lifestyle changes, sometimes surgery is necessary. Depending on your specific case, your doctor might recommend:\n\nGastrectomy: It removes part of your stomach.\n\nVagotomy: It cuts the vagus nerve, which causes you to make less acid.Â\n\nAntrectomy: It removes the lower part of the stomach, which produces a hormone that tells the body to make digestive juices.\n\nPyloroplasty: It makes the opening to the duodenum and small intestine bigger. This helps food pass out of your stomach faster.\n\nLaparoscopic surgery: In this, the doctor uses a small tube with a camera to look for problems with your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. Or, the doctor may operate using a very small opening.\n\nAfter treatment, your doctor may want to keep a close eye on you, depending on the size and location of your ulcer, how well the treatment worked, and if you had any other problems.\n\nHome Remedies for Stomach Ulcers\n\nThere are no home remedies for stomach ulcers, but certain foods and supplements may help fight the H. pylori bacteria. These include cruciferous vegetables (such as broccoli and cauliflower), leafy greens, fermented foods (such as sauerkraut and yogurt), apples, berries, olive oil, honey, probiotics supplements, vitamin C, and glutamine. If you have ulcers, avoiding spicy and acidic foods as well as cigarettes, caffeine, and alcohol may help your symptoms.\n\nStomach Ulcer Complications\n\nSome ulcers heal on their own; however, if your ulcer goes untreated or you have recurrent ulcers, you may develop complications such as:\n\nBleeding from the ulcer site that can become life-threatening\n\nPenetration, which happens when the ulcer goes through the wall of your digestive tract into another organ, such as the pancreas\n\nPerforation, which occurs when the ulcer creates a hole in the wall of your digestive tract\n\nObstruction (blockage) in your digestive tract, which happens because of swelling of inflamed tissues\n\nA hole in your stomach, which may need to be fixed with surgery\n\nStomach cancer, specifically non-cardia gastric cancer\n\nUlcers can also erode the blood vessel wall in your stomach or small intestine, and eat a hole through the lining, leading to infection. Or they can cause swelling, which may block food from moving from your stomach into your small intestine.\n\nStomach Ulcer Prevention\n\nWhileÂ stress and spicy foods can make symptoms of a peptic ulcer worse, they donât seem to make you more likely to have one. But a few other things can raise your chances.\n\nÂ\n\nYou're more likely to get an ulcer while taking NSAIDs if you:\n\nAre over age 65\n\nAre infected withÂ H. pylori bacteria\n\nTake more than one NSAID at a time\n\nHave had aÂ peptic ulcer in the past\n\nAlso take aÂ steroid drug or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)\n\nBe careful when you take pain relievers such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen sodium. Some people who haveÂ arthritis or other conditions that causeÂ chronic pain take NSAIDs for weeks or months at a time to ease pain and swelling. These medicines can affect theÂ mucus that protects your stomach against acid and make you more likely to have peptic ulcers.\n\nTo lower your chances for peptic ulcers while you take NSAIDs:\n\nUse the lowest possible dose to control your symptoms, and stop taking them as soon as you no longer need them. Also, talk to your doctor about using a different pain reliever such as acetaminophen.Â\n\nTake your medicine with food.\n\nDon't drinkÂ alcohol while youâre taking these medicines.\n\nÂ\n\nWhile you're on NSAIDs, you can take medicine to lower the amount of acid your stomach makes.Â Drugs that can do that include:\n\nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs) suchÂ as esomeprazole (Nexium),Â omeprazole (Prilosec OTC), and pantoprazole (Protonix)\n\nH2 blockers such asÂ cimetidine (Tagamet),Â famotidine (Pepcid), andÂ nizatidine\n\nYou can also take the drugÂ misoprostol (Cytotec) to boost the amount of protectiveÂ mucus your stomach makes. But that can cause side effects includingÂ diarrhea and stomach cramps.\n\nA few changes to your lifestyle can help reduce the risk of complications. Some include:\n\nDonât smoke, and limit alcohol. These two habits make you more likely to get peptic ulcers. Both thin the mucus lining that protects your stomach from acid, leading to more acid. Ask your doctor to recommend a program to help youÂ quit smoking. And talk with them about how muchÂ alcohol is safe for you to drink.\n\nManage stress.Â Stress can make the symptoms of a peptic ulcer worse. Figure out whatâs causing issues for you and see how you can deal with it better. For example, getting enoughÂ sleep can help with that. It also can boost yourÂ immune system.\n\nConsider probiotics. Millions of bacteria normally live in your gut. Some, likeÂ H. pylori, cause disease. Others are good for you because they help crowd out harmful bacteria. These helpful bacteria are calledÂ probiotics.\n\nTheyâre still being studied, but researchers think they may help with pepticÂ ulcers. You can find them in foods such as:\n\nDairy products that have live cultures, such as yogurt, kefir, and aged cheeses\n\nSauerkraut\n\nKimchi\n\nMiso\n\nTempeh\n\nPreventÂ H. pylori infection. About two-thirds of people around the world have this type of infection, but most donât get ulcers because of it. Doctors donât know how you can avoidÂ H. pylori, but they think it spreads from person to person or through food orÂ water.\n\nYou can also do some things to make an H. pylori infection less likely:\n\nWash your hands often during the day with warm water and soap so you don't catch or spreadÂ H. pylori. Clean your hands before you eat and after you go to the bathroom. If you don't have soap and water close by, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.\n\nCook meat and other foods all the way through.\n\nOnly drinkÂ water that you know is clean.\n\nÂ\n\nTakeaways\n\nUlcers are very common, and early treatment with medications and lifestyle changes can heal them. Talk with your doctor if you have symptoms of an ulcer. These include heartburn, acid reflux, feeling full even when you donât eat much, and having pain that goes away when you take antacids. Lifestyle changes can help when you have an ulcer. Quit smoking, drink less caffeine and alcohol, and avoid foods that make your symptoms worse.\n\nStomach Ulcer FAQs\n\nWhat are the symptoms of peptic ulcer?
