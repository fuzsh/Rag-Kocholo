        "text": "I'm Eric Sze of 886 and Wenwen, and today we are outside\n\nof an American institution, Delmonico's.\n\nDelmonico's is known as a steakhouse,\n\nbut really it's a restaurant restaurant.\n\nI'm gonna hit every single item on the menu.\n\nI brought my great friend, chef Ed Szymanski\n\nof Dame and Lord's.\n\nAll right, let's get to it!\n\nI'm very, very excited.\n\nThis also means we have to behave\n\na little bit 'cause it's so classy, right?\n\nIf we're capable of doing that.\n\nDelmonico's, the first fine dining restaurant in America,\n\nhas one of the biggest wine cellars in America,\n\nwhich you're a massive wine guy.\n\nYeah, if the budget stretches to it,\n\nI'll try and get down there and sneak a few bottles.\n\nAnd they also invented a bunch of dishes\n\nlike the Baked Alaska, Chicken a la King.\n\nI've never had it. Lobster Newberg\n\nand Delmonico Steak.\n\nYeah. There are some iffy claims.\n\nThey maybe claim they invented a few more things\n\nthan they really did, but either way, historic restaurant,\n\nawesome to have a chance to eat everything all at once.\n\nBefore we dive in, we gotta establish some ground rules.\n\nWe need to order one of everything off the menu.\n\nWe can only take one bite of everything.\n\nThe order of which we frolic with these dishes,\n\nit's completely up to us.\n\n[Ed] It's up to us.\n\nAnd at the very end, we're gonna give out awards\n\nto the best dishes.\n\nLet's do it.\n\nRound one, Raw & Cold, let's go.\n\n[bright music]\n\nFirst round.\n\nOkay. Raw & Cold.\n\nEverything's here.\n\nI have a dirty martini here with gin\n\nand two blue cheese olives.\n\n[Ed] Dry gin for me.\n\nMagnificent spread.\n\n[Ed] I think it's enough.\n\nI think we start with the caviar.\n\nSo these are potato chips that they make in-house,\n\ncooked slowly, flattened, really fancy.\n\nThere's probably at least $25.\n\nThis is an obscenely decadent thing.\n\nI'm just trying to get you full so you tap out before me.\n\nYeah, it's one bite- It really is personal.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how big the bite. Chin chin!\n\nChin chin. Cheers, sir.\n\n[patrons chattering]\n\nThat's a really good caviar.\n\nI don't eat caviar a lot. That's some good caviar.\n\nIf you did eat caviar a lot,\n\nyou wouldn't say it on camera, though.\n\nThat would be obnoxious.\n\nWe can only have one bite? I want another bite. [laughs]\n\nWhat do you wanna do next?\n\nLet's do the Seafood Plateau.\n\nInteresting name, Seafood Plateau.\n\nYeah, it's a fancy word for tower.\n\nOn the bottom, these Kumamoto oysters.\n\n[Eric] What sauce are you going with?\n\nJust a little lemon, I wanna taste the oyster.\n\nI'm not even gonna go with lemon.\n\n[Ed] Okay.\n\nAll right, cheers, sir.\n\nSalud.\n\nHmm. Super meaty.\n\nThis is a hamachi tartare.\n\nVery fresh, delicious.\n\nTop tower, prawns. Prawns, here's the thing.\n\nI love shrimp cocktail.\n\nI'm just not in that tax bracket to order it at restaurants.\n\nNo, I'm not normally a cocktail sauce guy.\n\nI don't love this American affinity\n\nto put ketchup in everything, but this is very good.\n\nSo the shrimp is cooked in dashi\n\nwith a lot of shallots, dill, and peppercorns.\n\nIt's a very unique shrimp cocktail.\n\nAnd it's also straight. Why is that?\n\nI think you probably stick a metal skewer in it\n\nwhen you cook it so it doesn't curl.\n\n[Eric] Ah, okay. So lobster tail and lobster claw.\n\nThey've very kindly separated\n\nthe segments of the lobster tail.\n\n[Ed] Should we have the claw?\n\n[Eric] We should. Let's see.\n\nWe should come here not on camera sometime\n\nand eat more than one bite of everything.\n\nThis is like the best way to start a meal.\n\n[Eric] We already had these,\n\nbut we're gonna have to take another bite\n\nbecause we play by the rules.\n\n[patrons chattering]\n\nThose are great shrimp. Just as good.\n\n[Ed] Yeah!\n\nI actually really wanted a second one.\n\n[Ed] And another oyster for you? Very good.\n\nJust as good as the first time.\n\nSo the yellowtail is cured in kombu for a day,\n\nand it's served with an avocado puree,\n\nand it's rolled in this crispy rice pearl, all right.\n\nDelicious, and very complex.\n\nLike you were pointing out, this is not just a steakhouse,\n\nand this food is quite ambitious.\n\nVery strong across the board.\n\nIt's kind of cheating to say the caviar,\n\n'cause of course that's amazing.\n\nI think the crudo surprised me.\n\nI'm gonna say the caviar, very strong start.\n\nI'm still very, very hungry.\n\nYeah. I'm famished, actually.\n\nNext up, we have the appetizers.\n\n[upbeat jazz music]\n\nWe got some champagne.\n\nWe are drinking some Pol Roger,\n\ncuvee Winston Churchill, 1986.\n\nI'm kidding. I wish we were. [laughs]\n\nWe're drinking some Bruno Paillard champagne,\n\nwhich will be very refreshing and delicious.\n\nSalud. Cheers.\n\nCheers, to us.\n\nLike true gentlemen at a fine steakhouse.\n\nWe have our appetizers here. We're still pretty hungry.\n\n[Eric] I say we go with the Caesar first.\n\nApparently they paint every leaf\n\nin the kitchen with the dressing,\n\nso I feel bad for the guy on garde manger\n\nwho has to do that.\n\nSafe to say, there's so much seafood in this Caesar salad,\n\nit's a sea-sar salad.\n\nDid you think of these last night?\n\nLittle gem for a Caesar salad\n\nis just so much better than romaine.\n\nYeah, it needs to be something really crunchy,\n\nand like romaine can be a little too leafy.\n\nThis is a wedge salad,\n\nwhich they claim to have invented here.\n\nYou want a huge bite of this?\n\nLittle tomato. Thank you, sir. Tomato.\n\nTomato.\n\nI want everything in one bite.\n\n[mellow music]\n\nIt's so hard to get a salad\n\nto have the textural sort of melody that this has.\n\nThis might be one of the best wedge salads ever.\n\nTextural melody, what a phrase.\n\nWe're picking up all day, okay?\n\nBurrata. Burrata.\n\nBeautiful composed bite.\n\nThat's a posh Caprese salad. Bacon next?\n\n[Eric] The bacon is sous vide and then braised,\n\nand it's glazed with a maple syrup dressing\n\nthat's been emulsified with foie gras.\n\nThe foie is great.\n\nThe bacon itself is very fatty to begin with.\n\nThis is just luxury.\n\n[Eric] Crab cakes.\n\n[Ed] Crab cake, yeah.\n\nThis is the fanciest crab cake I've ever seen\n\nin my entire life. Yeah!\n\nIt's wrapped in, what is this,\n\nlike, the fanciest julienned potatoes.\n\n[Ed] It's starting to feel\n\nlike we're having a real lunch now.\n\nIt's like a hash brown wrapped outside\n\nof the thing. It's kind of the ideal\n\ncrab cake, really.\n\nGood crab cake. Is this one bite?\n\nMm-hmm. Mm, that's very good.\n\nThat one's like, I would like to go back in\n\nfor another bite of that now.\n\nThat's very tasty.\n\nThe crispy potato on the outside\n\nand then mustard coming through in that tartar sauce,\n\nherbiness as well from the parsley oil\n\nand the parsley powder, that's really good.\n\nYou really shouldn't be fooled\n\nby the presentation of this dish.\n\nTastes like some grandma in Maryland made it for you.\n\nFor me, this one's kind of easy.\n\nLike, I think the crab cake takes the cake if you will.\n\n[Eric] I gotta go with the wedge salad, man.\n\n[Ed] Okay.\n\nThat bite with the tomato, with the lettuce\n\nand the blue cheese and the onions.\n\nThis round is done. Next round, steaks.\n\n[upbeat jazz music]\n\nWe have the first three steaks here, and-\n\n[Both] There's a total total of eight.\n\nAll the steaks, they're baste in dry-aged beef fat,\n\na little bit of brown butter,\n\nand a little bit of rendered duck fat.\n\nHere we have the piece de resistance.\n\n[Ed] Yeah, piece.\n\nPiece. De resistance.\n\nOkay, I'm not even gonna try-\n\nVive la France.\n\nThis is the centerpiece, the Delmonico.\n\n[Ed] That's right.\n\nSo it's essentially a ribeye that's wet aged\n\nand seared to perfection, served with crispy shallots.\n\nAnd in terms of sauces, we have the blue cheese sauce.\n\nThe black garlic butter is seasoned with white shoyu.\n\nWe have their take on the au poivre,\n\nwhich is citron peppercorn sauce.\n\nAnd here we have the jus.\n\nIt takes a whole day to just boil down\n\nand the second day to season it with shallots\n\nand a little bit of soy sauce.\n\nThis is the spicy kosho butter.\n\nIt's got pickled peppers inside\n\nand balanced with a teriyaki glaze.\n\nWe are drinking a bottle of Christophe Roumier Musigny\n\nfrom 1993, my birth year.\n\nMy birth year, too!\n\n[Ed] There you go.\n\nAh, congrats. Well, it's just fermented grapes to me.\n\nThese are all of my favorite wines\n\nthat I could never afford to drink,\n\nso I'm pretending that they're in our glass.\n\n[Eric] I think it would be a crime\n\nif we didn't start with the Delmonico.\n\n[Ed] Yeah, oh, I agree, nicely cooked.\n\nThis looks like a nice medium rare.\n\nI want this spinalis cap here.\n\nSome people return ribeyes for being too fatty,\n\nbut they're just wrong.\n\nFor me, this is the best part of the animal,\n\nthis like little bit off the top here.\n\nI'm going to fold a little bit of these fried shallots,\n\nbecause somebody worked very, very hard\n\nfor these fried shallots.\n\nCome on!\n\nSo good you would name a restaurant after it, perhaps.\n\nThat's delicious.\n\nThat's peak ribeye, and it's not dry aged.\n\nIt's very simple.\n\nThe lore is that the Delmonico steak\n\nsort of means butcher's cut\n\nand was at a certain point in time,\n\nwhatever cut they had on hand, they needed to sell that day,\n\nand they would market it as the house steak,\n\nsame way that modern steakhouses will call it\n\na butcher's cut or a chef's cut, something like that,\n\nand they called it the Delmonico's cut.\n\nThe restaurant was so popular throughout the 19th century\n\nthat other restaurants started imitating this\n\nand would put a Delmonico steak on their menu\n\neven though they had no tie to the Delmonico family.\n\nAnd eventually like throughout the course of history,\n\nit settled on being this cut,\n\nthe wet-aged boneless ribeye from the chuck end.\n\nNext on, we're gonna try the Delmonico\n\nsans spinalis dorsi, just the eye of the Delmonico.\n\nThe Delmonico is a ribeye, right?\n\nAnd a ribeye is comprised of the eye\n\nand also the spinalis dorsi.\n\nThat's right. If you want a leaner cut\n\nbut you don't want the filet mignon, this is your cut.\n\nFilet mignon for people with a little more character.\n\n[Eric] I'm gonna do the spicy kosho butter.\n\n[Ed] Okay, I'll do the black garlic one then.\n\nAll right, not gonna waste.\n\n[patrons chattering]\n\nWow, I'm not gonna say I prefer it\n\nover the regular Delmonico,\n\nbut I will say that it took me by surprise.\n\nI mean, the cook was just perfect!\n\n[Ed] It's absolutely perfect.\n\n[Eric] Dry-aged ribeye, dry aged for 30-plus days.\n\nEven though this, it's the same cut\n\nas the Delmonico, different farm,\n\ndifferent preparation, too, different product.\n\nYou know, the one bite only thing means I gotta go\n\nfor this one. Oh, you picked\n\nthe right one. Yeah.\n\nLook how juicy it is!\n\nLook, you could see the fat dripping off this.\n\nThis is just like a competitive eating challenge. [laughs]\n\nI'm gonna dip it in the au poivre.\n\n[Eric] I'm gonna do the shallot jus.\n\nYou can tell whoever's making these sauces\n\nknows what they're doing.\n\nVery good flavor and much more intensity.\n\nAnyone who wants a study in dry versus wet aging,\n\nit's very obvious to me from this like,\n\nthis tastes like funk and blue cheese and aged beef.\n\nThis tastes fresh.\n\nIt's delicious, but it tastes like fresher beef.\n\nIt's very tender, and that's part\n\nof what the wet aging process does.\n\nWithout developing the funk,\n\nit tenderizes the meat.\n\nDry aging does both.\n\nThat is the first three steaks. We have five more to go.\n\nWe're not done. We're just gonna clear these.\n\nWe are still in the steaks.\n\nI think the stakes are a little bit higher this round.\n\nWe are drinking some Chateau Margaux, 1982.\n\n[lively jazz music]\n\nFor this mini-round, we should focus\n\non going leanest to most fatty.\n\nAgree. So we're gonna start\n\nwith the filet mignon.\n\nHow big of a bite do you want?\n\n[Eric] I could take a big bite of filet.\n\nYou would order the filet\n\nif you wanted a lean cut of beef.\n\nSo traditionally, old-school restaurants,\n\nyou would serve the fatty beef without a lot of sauce\n\nor with a lean sauce like an au jus or something like that,\n\nand you'd serve the lean cut of beef with a rich sauce,\n\nserve this in a cream sauce\n\nor something with fat emulsified into the sauce.\n\nNowadays, they finish cattle with so much corn\n\nat the end of their life that even the filet mignon\n\ncan be pretty rich.\n\nOkay, if it's very dry,\n\nI'm not gonna be able to eat this whole thing\n\nin one bite. Yeah, that's true.\n\nThey say you should be able\n\nto cut filet mignon with a spoon.\n\n[Eric] Let's see. Shall we?\n\nYeah, yeah. Yeah, there you go.\n\nYeah, there you see? That's good.\n\n[bell dings]\n\nThat is a really good filet steak.\n\nI'm not just saying that- How did you\n\ndown that so fast? because the staff\n\nare all looking at me.\n\nAlso very well seasoned. The flaky salt on top is great.\n\nIncredibly tender, but perfectly charred\n\nand well-cooked, too.\n\nYou overcook or undercook a filet, no good.\n\n[Eric] Next up, New York strip.\n\nAnd mind you, all of these steaks are dry-aged\n\nexcept for the wagyu.\n\nThe muscle that we call the New York strip\n\nis the same as the eye of the ribeye.\n\nIt's just from further back on the calf.\n\nSo it should be tender and fatty and delicious.\n\n[bright music]\n\nOh, yeah.\n\n[Ed] That's very good.\n\nI actually might prefer New York strips over ribeye.\n\nI know it's the same muscle.\n\nWell, same muscle but different part of the muscle,\n\nright? Exactly.\n\nSo different flavor. So like further down.\n\nA5 Miyazaki wagyu.\n\nWagyu means [speaks Japanese], which means Japanese cow.\n\nMiyazaki is where they produced it.\n\nA5 is the ranking of the cow.\n\nThis steak actually takes a little bit longer to cook\n\nbecause they have to cook it slowly to A, not overcook it,\n\nand B, render out most of the fat,\n\nor else you'll just be eating like a cube of tallow.\n\nVery prized cut, very expensive,\n\nhence the miniature portion,\n\nbut we won't fault them for that.\n\nI'm eyeing this piece. Just remind you\n\nthat so you said you could have 34 ounces of steak,\n\nso that's 10 of these.\n\n[Eric] First of all, I said 34 ounces of steak,\n\nnot A5 Miyazaki, okay?\n\nThis is like the fourth shot of whiskey\n\nat two in the morning at the bar.\n\nYou know it's a bad idea, but it feels so right at the time.\n\nThis is just like clogging my arteries as it goes down.\n\nEach bite is like somebody shooting\n\na water gun of beef fat in your palate.\n\nI think I have to go for a jog right now.\n\nThis is like exercise in refinement.\n\nIt's very delicate, and the like flavor profile\n\nis just fat and beef,\n\nwhereas this tastes like smoke and char and peppers,\n\nand there's like all this sauce\n\nthat's sitting on the bottom of the plate, too.\n\nIt's a real privilege to be able to do this side by side,\n\n'cause you wouldn't frequently have a chance to do that.\n\nAll right, we've had six steaks. We've got two to go.\n\nWe have cote de boeuf and a porterhouse.\n\nAnd in our glass, they very generously poured us\n\nDomaine de la Romanee-Conti La Tache from 1990.\n\nI think we might have to break the rule for the porterhouse,\n\n'cause the magic of the porterhouse\n\nis the two different muscles on both sides of the bone.\n\nYou have the filet on one side,\n\nand you have the strip on the other side.\n\n[Eric] This is the New York strip, right?\n\n[Ed] Mm-hmm.\n\n[Eric] And then we will take the filet.\n\nAnd this is very difficult technically\n\nto cook the two muscles to the same temperature.\n\nNew York strip, filet mignon.\n\n[upbeat jazz music]\n\nI'm not sure how you can top that,\n\n'cause the New York strip is leaner.\n\nThe filet mignon is obviously a little bit more tender.\n\nSo when you're biting down,\n\nthere's that contrast of squishy and tender.\n\nIt just constantly is flowing through.\n\nAnd every bite of the New York strip\n\nactually gushes a little bit of juice.\n\nSo your mouth is, your palate is always lubricated.\n\nI feel like my body temperature has risen\n\nlike five degrees in the last few minutes\n\nthroughout the steak course.\n\nI would imagine-\n\n[Ed] That's a cote de boeuf, all right.\n\nI would imagine you flip open a dictionary,\n\nyou look up cote de boeuf, and this photo pops up.\n\nYeah, cote de boeuf is a ribeye, too.\n\nThis is Australian wagyu. The beef is delicious.\n\nIt's not as fatty as that Japanese wagyu we just had,\n\n'cause imagine a 36-ounce portion of that.\n\nEric, you said 34 ounces.\n\nPlease, take it away. Eat the whole thing.\n\nThat's the next- At 11:00 AM today,\n\nI could've put this away.\n\nOkay, all right. For sure.\n\nAnd have space for sides and dessert.\n\nWell, on that note,\n\nwhich slice would you like me to serve you?\n\nActually, I think we should start with the bone.\n\nOkay. And we should\n\nshare this bone.\n\nOkay.\n\nIt's the most romantic thing I've ever done.\n\nThat's really good, so fatty it's glistening.\n\nAnd they've done it- You can tell\n\nit's pretty raw towards the top,\n\nbut it's the best kind of beef.\n\nAll right, let's get a slice two.\n\nThe cook is definitely different.\n\nLike, it's notably less cooked\n\nthan some of the other steaks.\n\nMy assumption here is that's to showcase the fattiness\n\nof the Australian wagyu versus the domestic beef.\n\nYou can see the shine on the product,\n\nand again, like beautifully rested,\n\nnothing on the plate beneath it.\n\nSo out of the eight steaks,\n\nwhich I know seems like a century ago-\n\n[Ed laughs]\n\nWhich one was your favorite?\n\nThe most surprising to me was the filet.\n\nThat was really a lot better than I thought it would be.\n\nIt's hard to beat that first Delmonico.\n\nThere's a reason the restaurant's named after that.\n\nI gotta say, my number one steak, dry-aged ribeye.\n\nIt's something about dry aging a piece of ribeye\n\nwhere the funk completely comes through.\n\nWhen it's perfectly cooked,\n\nthe fat in the center between the longissimus\n\nand the spinalis is rendered just enough where it's edible\n\nand it's not a chewy flab of bullshit fat.\n\nThey achieved it. They achieved it.\n\nThat's it for the steaks.\n\nComing up next are the sides.\n\n[upbeat jazz music]\n\nEric, how you feeling?\n\nI feel like I could use another two steaks.\n\nI'm not steaked out. Hand-cut fries.\n\n[Ed] Chips.\n\nOf course the Brit says chips.\n\nAnd this is a spicy mustard aioli.\n\nYou know we're in a fancy place\n\nif they serve them in like a posh little basket.\n\nBritish chip shops serve them in newspapers.\n\nThat's right, contrast. Not in Kansas no more.\n\nVery good, good chips, well seasoned, nice and crunchy.\n\nHe's not gonna stop calling it chips.\n\nLet's move on, grilled asparagus.\n\nThis asparagus is to me incredible, it-\n\n[Ed] That's great, yeah.\n\nIt checks all the boxes of what I'm looking for\n\nin a summer barbecue, right?\n\nIt has a char flavor. It's tender, it's fresh.\n\nA little bit of olive oil to garnish.\n\nBroccoli rabe. It's really tasty, well cooked.\n\nThe Aleppo pepper on top's a nice hit of spice.\n\nIt's a very bitter of vegetable,\n\nso it worked well to cut the foil\n\nof some of the richer meat dishes we just ate, very tasty.\n\n[Eric] Pommes puree, it's potato and a lot of butter.\n\nYou're gonna do a quenelle? No.\n\nNot exactly the best.\n\nWe're getting there, right? You got it, sir.\n\nJust as Joel Robuchon intended.\n\nNow it feels rude to eat it.\n\nPlease. Giving me a piece of art.\n\nVery good, like good technique happening in that kitchen.\n\n[Eric] Wild mushrooms.\n\nThey had a crazy night last night.\n\nThat was a underrated joke. All right.\n\nThat tastes like three cup mushrooms from Taiwan.\n\nYeah, the sesame flavor here is quite strong, too.\n\nLike, it's fun to have a side that's nonconventional.\n\nYep, I would order that.\n\nYeah? Let's do the hash brown.\n\nIt's cooked with a lot of butter,\n\na lot of duck fat, and a lot of potatoes.\n\nIt looks very daunting, and it's served\n\nwith a dollop of creme fraiche.\n\nIt has a shallot jam on the bottom.\n\nI want them to show my kitchen team how to do quenelles.\n\nThat's a very nice shape and creamy on the inside.\n\nOh, yeah, the shallot jam.\n\nThat's light sweetness, and it's just a hint of it.\n\nIt really brings everything together.\n\nYeah, that's great. It's delicious.\n\nRight? I would order this hash brown every single time.\n\nI think- Yeah, that's really good.\n\nI have a winner for this round.\n\n[Ed] But we haven't tried the spinach yet!\n\nIt's [beep] spinach, bro.\n\nIt's green.\n\n[Eric] All right, let's eat it.\n\n[Ed] That's good, really good.\n\nThat's fantastic.\n\nInitially, we turned our noses up at this.\n\nBut now after tasting it, you would order this, right?\n\nI would definitely order this.\n\nIf I have to pick one, I'd say the hash brown.\n\nThere we go. We can finally agree on something.\n\nWe've had our sides. Let's go to our entrees.\n\nLet's do it.\n\n[upbeat jazz music]\n\nWe have our entrees.\n\nThese are the entrees that are not steak.\n\nWell, let's get the stuff\n\nthat they didn't invent out of the way first.\n\nLamb chops, and on the side here,\n\nit's homemade yogurt that's been hung for about a day or so,\n\nand it's combined with a caramel\n\nso that it's like a caramelized yogurt.\n\nThere's pistachio powder in these lamb chops.\n\nUnfortunately, my dining companion\n\nhas a severe allergy to nuts.\n\nThis'll kill me.\n\nSo I will do the honors and dip it in the yogurt.\n\nYogurt, as you might say.\n\nThat's fantastic, impeccable cook.\n\nAnd the caramel actually really does come through.\n\nYogurt tends to like overpower\n\nand be a little bit too rich sometimes,\n\nespecially paired with lamb, but this just cuts it.\n\nIt retains that tang perfectly.\n\nShall we do the wild mushroom risotto?\n\n[Ed] Risotto, let's do it.\n\nLooks like a pretty classic risotto to me.\n\nHmm. Mushroomy, truffley.\n\nSweet, too.\n\nThat's good. Let's do the pasta next.\n\nThat's good. If your toddler came,\n\nhe/she doesn't really want steak,\n\nyou get a bowl of this,\n\nhave plenty Of leftovers. This is good, comforting-\n\nNothing wrong with it.\n\nThe salmon? Let's do it.\n\nFantastic cook on it. Dover sole.\n\nIt's like a Sunday breakfast.\n\nIt is buttery.\n\nYeah, the brown butter just, it shines.\n\nIt's swimming in a pool of it.\n\nBut then it never gets too much, right,\n\nbecause it's still so meaty.\n\n[Ed] Okay, Chicken a la Keene.\n\nSo they invented this dish, little shell pasta.\n\nLooks like bacon, a little asparagus.\n\nBacon. Or peas.\n\n[Ed] Yeah, this is like a school lunch, right?\n\nVery fancy TV dinner.\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\nIn my opinion.\n\n[patrons chattering]\n\nIt's delicious!\n\nYeah!\n\nBrilliantly executed chicken dish, if I may I say so.\n\nThis very much goes by everything you can buy in a can.\n\nYes, yes. Except for the chicken.\n\nThat's, you might be onto something there.\n\nLike, that might be where all this,\n\ncanned mushrooms, canned tomatoes,\n\ncanned asparagus, canned peas.\n\nWe are on to the final entree, the Lobster Newberg.\n\nThe lore is that it was a fisherman called Wenberg\n\nwho invented it, brought it to Delmonico's,\n\nbut they got into a massive fight.\n\nThe owners renamed it Lobster Newberg.\n\nVery chefy presentation, again,\n\nserved with a side of caramelized gnocchis.\n\nThat's a dish worthy of the name.\n\nIt's like a steamed lobster plus lobster sashimi in one\n\nwith a nice creamy sauce. That's like a creamy,\n\ntomato-driven spicy sauce.\n\nYou wanna try some of these gnocchis?\n\nLet's do it.\n\nI don't normally order lobster when I go out,\n\nsame thing as shrimp cocktail, just not in that tax bracket.\n\nSure.\n\nBut I would save up just to order this.\n\nYeah, this is really good.\n\n[Eric] It's delicious.\n\nWhat are your favorites of this round?\n\n[Eric] No question, the lobster.\n\nThe lobster? I think you're right, yeah.\n\nThis has the delicate layers and the variety of texture\n\npaired with the gnocchi.\n\nIt's a perfect lobster dish in my opinion.\n\nWe are finally ready for the grand finale, desserts.\n\n[upbeat jazz music]\n\nHow you feeling?\n\nMy meat sweats are hitting now.\n\nIt's a delayed hit, but I am feeling it.\n\nYou look a little glazed over,\n\nbut these should reinvigorate us.\n\nI'm ready for nap. Some frozen things.\n\nA little sugar high wouldn't hurt right now.\n\nHow are you feeling?\n\nI'm ready to go for a jog.\n\n[Eric] Mango sorbet, raspberry sorbet.\n\nAll of this is made in-house under love.\n\nDelicious. Tastes like raspberries.\n\nCome on.\n\nIt's good. That's refreshing, and then some mango.\n\n[patrons chattering]\n\nOne of the best mango sorbets I've had.\n\nDelicious.\n\nTypically mango in the States\n\nis a little bit too artificial.\n\nThis one you can taste it's the real deal.\n\nIce cream's next.\n\n[Eric] Vanilla and chocolate?\n\n[Ed] Yeah.\n\nSweeter than most vanillas you'll find\n\nin your store-bought ice creams, not in a bad way.\n\nYeah?\n\nIn a that's very refreshing after 45 ounces of steak.\n\nExactly, chocolate?\n\nIt's like they took milk chocolate\n\nand turned it into ice cream.\n\n[Ed] You have the hazelnut one. Lemme know how it is.\n\nAll right. I won't have\n\nthat one, either.\n\nThat's why it's near you, 'cause of the nuts.\n\nAgain, super smooth. Just crazy decadent.\n\n[patrons chattering]\n\nThat's good?\n\nThat's my favorite.\n\n[Ed] Am I missing out on something?\n\n[laughing] That's my favorite.\n\nYou wanna try this cheesecake?\n\nYuzu and blueberry and sesame.\n\nNice and light. Not a huge portion, which I appreciate.\n\nI don't know if it's light, buddy.\n\nIt's just overtaking my mouth,\n\nbut as all cheesecakes should, very yuzu forward.\n\n[Ed] Coconut cream pie.\n\nShall we try the ice cream first?\n\nYeah. Passion fruit.\n\nCuts like a passion fruit ice cream.\n\n[Ed] Mm-hmm, tart and tangy. Let's go for it.\n\nAll right, and you need that passion fruit ice cream.\n\nThat acidity really brings it over the top.\n\nThat's a fantastic dessert.\n\nChocolate cake. Chocolate cake.\n\n[Eric] This is the vanilla ice cream. Shall we dig in?\n\n[Ed] Yeah.\n\n[patrons chattering]\n\nCome on.\n\nThat's a great chocolate cake.\n\nCome on! What is in this chocolate cake?\n\nThis is not just a chocolate cake.\n\nA black current liqueur in this cake.\n\nSo it gives it that nuttiness\n\nwithout bringing too much alcohol into your palate.\n\nIt is creamy. It's very, very creamy.\n\nBut pair with that vanilla ice cream,\n\neven though it's more cream, it blends together.\n\nBut you have the best for last.\n\nYou have this Baked Alaska in front of you,\n\nand it's the only dish we've had\n\nthat is served on a Delmonico's plate.\n\nIt's also invented here, walnut cake, apricot jam,\n\nmeringue around the outside set on fire.\n\nThey pour black rum all over it,\n\nand then everything lights on fire, and it's super showy.\n\nEverybody in the dining room is very jealous\n\nthat you got one.\n\nThis one will kill me 'cause of the walnuts.\n\nSo you will dig in. You can eat both.\n\nBoth for me. You're eating my bite.\n\nYou have the cake and you have gelato,\n\nand then you have the meringue.\n\n[patrons chattering]\n\n[Ed] How is it?\n\nIt's good.\n\nYou look happy.\n\nThe banana and the apricot melds together,\n\nand then you have the sort of sponginess,\n\nbut also a little bit of ice crystally texture\n\nfrom the gelato, and everything just vroop,\n\nhomogenizes in your mouth.\n\nI'm impressed by the restaurant.\n\nI'm also impressed by us,\n\n'cause it seems like we're doing okay.\n\nI think the chocolate cake is the winner for me.\n\nI might have to go with the Baked Alaska, but it's unfair.\n\nYeah, that's why it's- I can't make\n\nthe executive decision.\n\nIt's famous for a reason.\n\nSo we're gonna clear the table,\n\nand we're gonna be back.\n\nWe're gonna figure out our awards.\n\n[upbeat jazz music]\n\nWe've had a bite of everything on the menu.\n\nWe feel okay. We're still alive.\n\nYeah, we feel good.\n\nWe can actually have\n\nanother beer after. Should we do it again?\n\nWe have to decide our awards.\n\nOkay. So we have The Star,\n\nwhich is the best dish overall.\n\nEvery time you're coming here, you're ordering this.\n\nThe second is The Return.\n\nYou've been here before. You know what the Star dish is.\n\nBut what is something that you'll keep getting?\n\nThe third one is The Repeat. You come here once a week.\n\nWhat are you getting that other people are not?\n\nI think your doctor's advice\n\nis to not come here once a week.\n\nDoctors be damned!\n\nIf you ignore that, then-\n\nYes. Okay.\n\nWhat is something that you tried,\n\nyou're so blown away, defeated all your expectations,\n\nthat one dish that took you by surprise?\n\nDelmonico's Steakhouse, known as the first\n\nAmerican fine dining restaurant,\n\nlow key, it's a potato restaurant.\n\nSome of the best dishes we've had have been potato focused.\n\nThat hash brown and that crab cake,\n\nthat crab cake, I see you,\n\nit's better than most other crab cakes.\n\nThat's the kind of thing I would come and eat once a week.\n\nIf I was sitting at the bar by myself\n\nand crushing that crab cake, it'd be a good sight.\n\nI would not be ashamed of it.\n\nI think he has a point. The Repeat is the crab cake.\n\nI could not agree more.\n\nThe shoestring fries wrapped around the crab cake itself\n\nand the presentation, right?\n\nI'm curious to hear about your Return,\n\n'cause the Lobster Newberg is fantastic.\n\nIt probably is one of the best bites today.\n\nThat was the thing that I said,\n\nWell, that's the best version of that.\n\nThis is the place to get it.\n\n[Eric] So the Return is the Lobster Newberg.\n\nI couldn't come here and not have that.\n\nWhat is your Star?\n\nMaybe it's the lore, maybe it's where we're sitting,\n\nmaybe it's the walls around us,\n\nbut like if I'm coming here one time in my life,\n\nI'm ordering a Delmonico steak.\n\nI don't think you can come to Delmonico's and not do that.\n\nOkay. It may not be\n\nthe greatest steak you've ever had.\n\nIt may not be the most complex cut.\n\nWe may prefer dry aging to wet aging,\n\nbut there's steakhouses around the country\n\nthat have a Delmonico steak on their menu,\n\nand we're sitting in the place that it was invented.\n\nIf you're coming here once, that's what I'm getting.\n\n[Eric] I'm voting for the hash brown.\n\nYeah, this is where the exercise is a little tricky,\n\n'cause you really need both of those things.\n\nI get your allure.\n\nI get the entire atmosphere, and you're at Delmonico.\n\nIt's the name steak, name-steak, but man. We're chefs, man!\n\nYou want the hash brown?\n\nThat hash brown was fantastic!\n\nIt was! No arguing. It was the best hash brown\n\nI've ever had!\n\nWe're skipping a lot of things here.\n\nRemember those appetizers?\n\nWasn't just the crab cake that was great.\n\nLike those shrimp, really well cooked.\n\nThe lobster, the rabe, the caviar was great.\n\nWe had a lot of good food today.\n\nHey, I don't think\n\nthere's a wrong answer here. Not counting the butter.\n\nYou pick yours.\n\nRock, paper, scissors.\n\nOkay.\n\nRock, paper, scissors, shoot.\n\nRock, paper, scissors, shoot.\n\nAs luck will have it, the Star is the Delmonico steak,\n\nbut order the hash browns.\n\nThere you have it.\n\nThat is one of everything at Delmonico's Steakhouse,\n\ncarnivore's dream.\n\nThat was a huge meal. I wonder what the bill was.\n\nI'll put my card down first.\n\nYou pay me back with Zelle later.\n\n[bright music]"
