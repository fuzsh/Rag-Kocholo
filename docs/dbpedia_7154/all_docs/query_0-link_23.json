After an apprenticeship in vaudeville and in short films for the Selig Polyscope Company as early as 1908, Arbuckle went on to such renown that eventually he was supervising his own films for Keystone. In 1913 he starred (often with Mabel Normand) in 47 films. As an actor, he enjoyed a fame second only to that of Chaplin, who began directing and playing leading roles in 1914, the same year that Sennett gave Arbuckle charge of a unit at Keystone.\n\nArbuckle had the right combination of obesity and agility to become a member of Sennett's company. He was fleet-footed enough to dash about in the many chase scenes, and he could execute the frequent pratfalls that occurred in the frantic comedy of the Sennett studio. Early in his career he developed a charisma (the fat man as leading comic figure) that was almost as appealing as that projected by the much-loved John Bunny, a skillful actor who played middle-aged roles in genteel comedies. Arbuckle could play a variety of types: a likable country oaf, a lovesick suitor, a philandering husband. Eventually he moved away from the more primitive Keystone caricatures to a more solid comic creation: the young man next door trying to succeed.\n\nArbuckle developed a more independent style when he left Sennett to work for the Comique Film Corporation. There he created many effective two-reelers and introduced Buster Keaton to the screen as his supporting comedian. He left directing when he graduated to features in the early 1920s starring in Brewster's Millions and Traveling Salesman.\n\nForced from the screen as a result of his involvement in one of Hollywood's great sex scandals, Arbuckle became a filmmaker for Educational under the assumed name of William Goodrich. Such two-reelers as Cleaning Up in 1926 were minor efforts, but in 1927 he directed his first feature, The Red Mill (adapted from the musical by Victor Herbert). As an actor, the scandal that plagued him allowed him a chance at only bit parts. In the second period he created shorts for Educational and made a modest comeback by starring in some of them. Warner Brothers, under the subsidiary corporation Vitaphone, starred him in Hey, Pop!, Buzzin' Around, How've You Been?, and Tomalio in the early 1930s. The latter film was a broad farce set in South America. Director Ray McCarey, creator of Hal Roach shorts and a Laurel and Hardy feature, Pack Up Your Troubles, did little to help Arbuckle in what might have been a comeback. There were other problems too. A poverty of gag invention plagued this cheaply made two-reeler. Also, the comedian lacked the vocal skills necessary for the sound medium. In the climatic sequence, an obese man engaging in a foot race, the humor is crude. With such weak films Arbuckle did not have much of a chance, but had he been able to move on from such ventures to better parts in better films, he might have been a star again. Unfortunately, he died in 1933.\n\nArbuckle made a real contribution to the comedy film in his Keystone and Comique days. Also, he taught Buster Keaton all phases of filmmaking, and his student became one of the most important comedians the screen has known.\n\n—Donald McCaffrey"
