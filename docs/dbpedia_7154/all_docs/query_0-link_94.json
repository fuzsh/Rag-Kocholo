        "text": "Welcome to the 4th section of my Movie list! We have previously covered films from 1987-2004 in parts I , II, and III. This segment will cover 2005-2009, a particularly good 5 years for movies. As always, I will provide “skinnys” of all the films I saw in cinemas in each individual year.\n\n215: Doom – A really, really, bad movie. I am surprised that Karl Urban returned to Sci Fi after this film, let alone a few GREAT sci fi films (Dredd, Star Trek). It is basically what you think it is- zombie monsters on a Mars Colony. The video Game “Doom” translated to screen with no talent or ingenuity in its writing.\n\n216: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe – I did not enjoy this film. I was not a reader of the books, and I have vague memories of my mother trying to force the 1980’s tv version down my throat. When Santa Claus showed up and gave the kids magical weapons, I pretty much called BS right then and there.\n\n217: Fantastic Four – Sheesh! What the heck was this? I enjoy “Dr Doom” actor Julian McMahon quite a bit, but he was completely miscast.\n\n219: Brothers Grimm – I really knew nothing going into this film. I was not aware it existed until my girlfriend said she wanted to see it. I sat down, started watching. I said to her and a friend with us: “This is just like a Terry Gilliam movie! It’s even got Jonathan Pryce!” They looked at me with confused gazes.\n\n“This IS a Gilliam movie! idiot!”\n\n220: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory – This movie was handicapped from the start. It was never going to reach the level of affection that the old Gene Wilder film possessed. It does a good job though. Depp was well cast.\n\n221: Constantine – Hellblazer comes to the screen! A decent adaptation, but not as stellar as the recent NBC TV show. Keanu did his best though.\n\n222: Dukes of Hazzard – A guilty pleasure. I love the Broken Lizard guys, and they made this one. Jessica Simpson’s pants (circa 2005) nearly ended my engagement to Tatum.\n\n223: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire – Wow. Epic filmmaking. As in the books, this is the film where everything turns a corner. Voldemort comes back, draws blood, and shit gets real. Such a great film.\n\n224: Robots – A cute animated film that I enjoyed, but simply forgot existed.\n\n225: Serenity – The big screen finale to Firefly by Joss Whedon. I was lucky to meet the entire cast at Comic-Con that summer, and I am glad to have gotten a chance to congratulate Joss on getting this film made.\n\n226: Sky High – We almost skipped this one, but Bruce Campbell as the Gym teacher won us over. Cool movie.\n\n227: War of the Worlds – A fantastic Spielberg action film, of the type he stopped making in the 1990’s. Tom Cruise is great in this.\n\n228: Wedding Crashers – A standard Vince Vaughn comedy, but still good.\n\n229: Revenge of the Sith – The FINALE! (or so we thought until Disney threw 4 Billion at Uncle George.) This is what I’d been waiting for since childhood- Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader. I was not disappointed. This was the best of the trilogy. (Review)\n\n42(230): The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy – I thought for sure this would suck…and it DID NOT! They captured the insanity of the novel quite perfectly. The opening musical number was outstanding. The casting of Alan Rickman was inspired.\n\n218: King Kong – Sorry PJ! This was just a misstep of epic proportions. Far too long, and just not entertaining."
