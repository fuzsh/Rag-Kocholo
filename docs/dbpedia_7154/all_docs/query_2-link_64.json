        "text": "What Is Chemotherapy?\n\nChemotherapy is a type of treatment with drugs that kill cancer cells. It is a strong and effective treatment but can also cause serious side effects.\n\nWhat is chemotherapy made of?\n\nThere are many different kinds of chemotherapy drugs. Each one works a little differently. The main kinds are:\n\nAlkylating agents.Â These drugs damage cell DNA, which is genetic material in charge of growth and development. This prevents cancer cells from multiplying.Â Alkylating agents are the oldest and most common type of chemotherapy. They include:\n\nAltretamine\n\nBendamustine\n\nBusulfan\n\nCarboplatin\n\nChlorambucil\n\nCisplatin\n\nCyclophosphamide\n\nDacarbazine\n\nIfosfamide\n\nMechlorethamine\n\nMelphalan\n\nOxaliplatin\n\nProcarbazine\n\nTemozolomide\n\nThiotepa\n\nTrabectedin\n\nNitrosoureas are a special kind of alkylating agent. They can enter your brain and attack tumors there. This makes them effective for treating some brain cancers. Examples include:\n\nCarmustine\n\nLomustine\n\nStreptozocin\n\nAntimetabolites.Â These stop cells from making DNA for new cancer cells. Common antimetabolites include:\n\n5-fluorouracil\n\n6-mercaptopurine\n\nAzacitidine\n\nCapecitabine\n\nCladribine\n\nClofarabine\n\nCytarabine\n\nDecitabine\n\nFloxuridine\n\nFludarabine\n\nGemcitabine\n\nHydroxyurea\n\nMethotrexate\n\nNelarabine\n\nPemetrexed\n\nPentostatin\n\nPralatrexate\n\nThioguanine\n\nTrifluridine/tipiracil combination\n\nTopoisomerase inhibitors.Â This kind of chemotherapy drug stops a protein called topoisomerase from working. Topoisomerase helps cells copy their DNA, allowing them to multiply into new cells. If topoisomerase doesnât work, cancer cells canât multiply. Common ones include:\n\nEtoposide\n\nIrinotecan\n\nIrinotecan liposomal\n\nMitoxantrone\n\nTeniposide\n\nTopotecan\n\nMitotic inhibitors.Â These drugs stop cells from multiplying (a process called mitosis). Theyâre also called plant alkaloids because plants use natural versions of these compounds to defend themselves. Some common ones are:\n\nCabazitaxel\n\nDocetaxel\n\nNab-paclitaxel\n\nPaclitaxel\n\nVinblastine\n\nVincristine\n\nVincristine liposomal\n\nVinorelbine\n\nAntitumor antibiotics.Â This kind of chemotherapy drug stops cells from copying their DNA, so they can't multiply. Some drugs also damage DNA. They include:\n\nBleomycin\n\nDactinomycin\n\nDaunorubicin\n\nDoxorubicin\n\nDoxorubicin liposomal\n\nEpirubicin\n\nIdarubicin\n\nMitomycin-C\n\nMitoxantrone\n\nValrubicin\n\nOther chemotherapy drugs.Â These drugs donât belong to the above categories, but theyâre still helpful for treating cancer. They include:\n\nAll-trans-retinoic acid\n\nArsenic trioxide\n\nAsparaginase\n\nEribulin\n\nIxabepilone\n\nMitotane\n\nOmacetaxine\n\nPegaspargase\n\nProcarbazine\n\nRomidepsin\n\nVorinostat\n\nYou might get just one chemotherapy drug or a combination of them. Using a combination can make your treatment more effective because each drug attacks cancer in a different way. It also lowers the chances that your body will learn to resist a drug. Resistance means that the drug doesnât work for you anymore.\n\nThere isnât one âbestâ type of chemotherapy drug. Which drug will work best for you depends on many different things. You and your doctor will choose which drug(s) to use based on your:\n\nCancer type and stage\n\nPrevious cancer treatments\n\nHealth status\n\nTreatment goals\n\nSometimes, doctors prescribe steroids to take with chemotherapy. Steroids can fight cancer (although they canât treat cancer by themselves) and lessen side effects from chemo.\n\nHow Does Chemotherapy Work?\n\nIn your body, cells naturally grow and multiply. Each cell makes a copy of its DNA and then splits into two new cells. This is called the cell cycle. Cells only multiply at certain times, and they die when they get old. This is normal and healthy.\n\nBut sometimes, the process gets disrupted, causing cells to multiply too quickly. This results in cancer.\n\nChemotherapy targets these fast-growing cancer cells. The drugs kill these cells or at least stop them from multiplying. They do this by interrupting certain parts of the cell cycle. Each chemotherapy drug works differently. For example, some drugs stop DNA from copying itself so that cancer cells canât multiply.\n\nUnlike radiation or surgery, which target specific areas, chemo can work throughout your body. It kills cancer cells, but it can also affect some fast-growing healthy cells, like those of the skin, hair, intestines, mouth, and bone marrow. Thatâs what causes some of the side effects from the treatment.\n\nIs chemotherapy painful?\n\nChemotherapy usually isnât painful, especially if you get it as a pill or cream (for skin cancer).\n\nIf you get it as a shot, you might notice the needle prick. Some people feel a mild burning when the drugs start to flow, but this goes away quickly.\n\nWhat Does Chemotherapy Do?\n\nThe effect of chemotherapy depends on the kind of cancer you have and how far along it is.\n\nCure:Â In some cases, the treatment can destroy cancer cells to the point that your doctor can no longer detect them in your body. After that, the best outcome is that they never grow back again, but that doesnât always happen.\n\nStop the spread: In some cases, chemo may only be able to keep cancer from spreading to other parts of your body or slow the growth of cancer tumors. This can help you live longer with cancer.\n\nEase symptoms: In some cases, chemotherapy canât cure or control the spread of cancer and is simply used to shrink tumors that cause pain or pressure. These tumors often continue to grow back. This type of therapy is called palliative treatment.\n\nHow Is Chemotherapy Used?\n\nSometimes, it treats cancer by itself, but more often itâs used in combination with:\n\nSurgery. A doctor removes cancerous tumors or tissue, or organs affected by cancerous cells.\n\nRadiation therapy. A doctor uses invisible radioactive particles to kill cancer cells. It may be delivered by a special machine that targets parts of your body from the outside, or by putting radioactive material on, near, and even inside your body.\n\nHormone therapy.Â Some cancers feed on certain hormones. This type of treatment uses drugs that stop the cancer from getting those hormones, effectively starving it.\n\nImmunotherapy.Â This treatment uses drugs that strengthen your immune system so it can better fight the cancer.\n\nBiological therapy. Living material in the form of bacteria, vaccines, or antibodies are carefully introduced to kill cancer cells.\n\nChemotherapy may be used to:\n\nShrink a tumor before radiation or surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy)\n\nDestroy any remaining cancer cells after surgery or radiation (adjuvant chemotherapy)\n\nMake other therapies (biological or radiation) more effective\n\nDestroy cancer cells that return or spread to other parts of your body\n\nChemotherapy isnât just used for cancer. It also can help treat autoimmune disorders and prepare people for bone marrow transplants.\n\nHow Long Does Chemotherapy Last?Â\n\nEveryone has a different chemotherapy schedule. How long treatment lasts, and how often you get it, depends on:\n\nThe type of cancer you have\n\nHow far along it is\n\nThe goal of treatment â to cure, control growth, or ease pain\n\nThe type of chemotherapy\n\nThe way your body responds to the treatment\n\nA single chemotherapy session usually lasts a few minutes to a few hours. But some people may need continuous infusions, powered by an electronic pump, which can last multiple days. You might start a continuous infusion at a hospital or clinic, then head home for the rest of the treatment.\n\nThese sessions can happen once a day, a week, or even a month.\n\nYou may have chemotherapy in âcyclesâ or ârounds.â This means a period of treatment and then a period of rest. For example, a 4-week cycle may mean 1 week of treatment and then 3 weeks of rest. The rest allows your body to make new healthy cells. Once a cycle has been planned out, itâs better not to skip a treatment, but your doctor may suggest it if the side effects are serious. Then your medical team will likely plan a new cycle to help you get back on track.\n\nChemotherapy drugs donât stay in your body forever. Over time, your kidneys and liver break them down. Then, you pee or poop them out. How long this takes depends on the type of chemo drug and your health.\n\nHow to Prepare for Chemotherapy\n\nChemotherapy is a powerful but intense treatment. There are a few things you might need to do before it starts.Â\n\nHere are some ways to get ready for chemotherapy:\n\nTalk to your doctor.Â Ask them what to expect. This can help you mentally prepare and make plans. For example, you could bring a book with you during long treatments or ask about medications to manage certain side effects. Your doctor also can suggest resources and support groups.\n\nGet medical tests and imaging done.Â Your doctor might suggest some tests to make sure your body can handle chemotherapy. They can use the test results to pick a drug and dosage thatâs safe for you.\n\nGet a medical device implanted if needed.Â If youâll be getting intravenous (IV) treatment, you might need a device that can help deliver the chemo drugs. This could be a catheter, port, or pump. A doctor will surgically place this device into a large vein, often in your chest.\n\nVisit your dentist.Â Chemotherapy lowers your immunity, making you more vulnerable to infection. Itâs important to check for any existing tooth infections and treat them before chemotherapy begins.\n\nMake plans for work and home life. Talk to your boss, coworkers, family, and friends about arrangements for when youâre getting treatment. For example, you might take short-term disability, ask to work remotely, or ask a friend to pick up your kids from school.\n\nCall your insurance company.Â Chemotherapy is usually covered by insurance, but every plan has different rules. Donât be afraid to double-check information and ask for help. Some companies offer patient assistance programs.Â\n\nConsider side effects and how to deal with them.Â Talk to your doctor about possible side effects and if there are ways to prevent or treat them. You might not be able to avoid certain side effects, but you can make a plan for them. For example, if chemotherapy will cause hair loss, you can start looking into wigs, scarves, or head wraps. If it will cause infertility, consider freezing your sperm or eggs. If it will make your skin more sensitive, start buying lotions, makeup, and sunscreen designed for sensitive skin.\n\nFor your first day of treatment, you should try to get a good nightâs sleep and eat a light meal. Chemotherapy might make you nauseous or sleepy. So, itâs probably a good idea to ask someone to drive you. They also can be a source of moral support.\n\nAfter the first session, youâll have a better idea about what to eat and whether you can drive yourself to future appointments.\n\nHow Is Chemotherapy Given?\n\nYou can get chemotherapy in many different ways. Some are:\n\nIntravenous (IV). The chemotherapy goes directly into a vein. You might get it through a tube in your arm or a device in your chest.\n\nInjection.Â The drugs are delivered with a shot directly into the muscle in your hip, thigh, or arm, or in the fatty part of your arm, leg, or stomach, just beneath the skin.\n\nCreams. For some types of skin cancer, you use a cream or gel containing chemotherapy drugs.\n\nPills. You can swallow a pill, capsule, or liquid.\n\nIntra-arterial. The drugs go directly into the artery that is feeding the cancer, through a needle, or soft, thin tube (catheter). The drugs can also go into veins.\n\nIntraperitoneal. The drugs are delivered to the peritoneal cavity, which contains organs such as your liver, intestines, stomach, and ovaries. It is done during surgery or through a tube with a special port that is put in by your doctor.\n\nIntraplueral.Â This is when chemotherapy is delivered directly to your chest.\n\nIntrathecal. For this type of chemotherapy, your doctor uses a needle or long-term catheter and port to inject medicine into the cerebrospinal fluid. This fluid surrounds your spinal cord and brain. Intrathecal chemotherapy is a good option for some brain cancers.\n\nIntravesical.Â This type of chemotherapy is delivered to the bladder through the urethra. The urethra is the tube through which pee comes out. A doctor will thread a soft, thin catheter through your urethra, leave it in for a few hours during each treatment session, and then take it out.\n\nIntramuscular. This is when the doctor uses a needle to inject chemo drugs into your muscles.\n\nIntralesional.Â Depending on where the tumor is, your doctor might be able to inject drugs directly into it.\n\nSurgical.Â In some cases, chemotherapy can be delivered directly to the tumor. During surgery, the doctor will put a thin wafer near the tumor. The wafer contains chemotherapy drugs and releases them as it breaks down. It also can be put in the empty spot where a cancer was surgically removed.\n\nDepending on the type of chemotherapy you get, treatment could take place in:\n\nYour home (pills and creams)\n\nYour doctorâs office\n\nA specialized clinic\n\nAn outpatient hospital infusion center\n\nA hospital\n\nHow Does Intravenous (IV) Delivery Work in Chemotherapy?\n\nIV chemo is the most common form of chemotherapy. Itâs when chemotherapy drugs are delivered directly into a vein. The simplest way to do this is through a thin needle in a vein on your hand or lower arm. Your nurse inserts the needle and removes it when treatment is done.\n\nBut often, youâll need other devices to make the process run more smoothly. The most common device is a soft, thin tube called catheter. If you get chemo through a catheter, the doctor doesnât put the needle directly into your skin. Instead, theyâll thread one end of this tube into a large vein, often in your chest area. The other end stays outside your body. The doctor will use a needle to deliver chemotherapy and other drugs into the outer end of the tube. They can also use this tube to draw blood. Getting chemotherapy through a catheter takes a few minutes to a few hours.\n\nIf you get chemo through a catheter, you also might need a device called a port. This is a small disc that a surgeon connects to the catheter and places under your skin. A nurse may insert a needle into your port to give you chemotherapy drugs or draw blood. The needle can be left in place for treatments that last more than a day.\n\nSometimes, youâll have a pump attached to your catheter or port. This device controls the flow of chemotherapy drugs (how fast they get into your body). You may carry this pump with you, or a surgeon may place it under your skin.\n\nLong-term catheters and ports are good options when you need several chemotherapy treatments and donât want to get repeated needle pokes. They also can deliver other medications, such as antibiotics and anti-nausea medicines. The doctor will place them into your vein and under your skin during a minor surgery.\n\nHow Will I Feel During Chemotherapy?\n\nChemotherapy is a powerful treatment, but it can cause many side effects. This is because it also kills fast-growing healthy cells, not just cancer cells.\n\nEveryone responds to chemo differently. Some people have only mild side effects, or none at all. Others might have one or two more severe side effects. It depends on a lot of things, including any other health conditions you have or medications you take. But thereâs no way to know for sure what side effects youâll have until you start chemotherapy.Â\n\nSome common side effects are:\n\nHair loss\n\nNausea and vomiting\n\nDiarrhea\n\nConstipation\n\nNot feeling hungry\n\nWeight loss\n\nMouth sores\n\nFatigue\n\nMood changes\n\nFever\n\nNumbness, tingling, or pain\n\nDry skin\n\nChanges in skin and nail color\n\nKidney and bladder problems\n\nLibido changes\n\nEasy bruising and bleeding\n\nAnemia (low levels of red blood cells)\n\nNeutropenia\n\nInfection\n\nDoctors can help prevent or treat many of these side effects. If necessary, they can even adjust your treatment to avoid certain side effects. Side effects usually go away soon after chemotherapy ends.\n\nChemotherapy and hair loss\n\nYour hair grows out of tiny skin structures called hair follicles. Chemotherapy damages these follicles, causing hair to fall out. Depending on the drug, you might have hair loss or thinning just on your head, or also on your eyebrows, eyelashes, armpits, arm and leg hair, and pubic hair. But it affects everyone differently. Even for two people taking the same drug, one might have hair loss and the other wonât.Â\n\nHair loss usually starts 1-3 weeks into treatment and becomes more noticeable at 1-2 months. It may be quick or slow. Clumps might come out when you wash or brush your hair.\n\nHair loss can be very upsetting. It might help to remember that it will grow back. In fact, it will probably start growing back before treatment is even finished. In the meantime, you can wear fashionable wigs, scarves, or head wraps, or if you prefer, you can shave your head.\n\nChemotherapy and constipation\n\nConstipation is when you have trouble pooping. It happens when poop stays in your large intestine (colon) for a long time. This allows the colon to absorb more water from your poop than usual, making your poop hard.\n\nSome cancers (especially colorectal cancer) and chemotherapy drugs (especially vincristine and other vinca alkaloids) can raise your risk for constipation.\n\nYou can manage constipation by:\n\nGetting regular physical activity\n\nEating plenty of insoluble fiber from foods such as wheat bran, brown rice, almonds and walnuts, and leafy green vegetables\n\nTaking laxatives, enemas, and suppositories as needed and with your doctor's permission\n\nTell your doctor if you donât poop for 3 days, see blood in your poop, or have stomach pain or vomiting. Call 911 if you have bleeding from your rectum or severe stomach pain that wonât go away.\n\nChemotherapy and diarrhea\n\nDiarrhea is when you have frequent, watery poops. You might also have stomach pain or cramps. Some cancers (especially pancreas, gastric, and colorectal), chemotherapy drugs (especially 5-fluorouracil, capecitabine, and irinotecan), and other cancer treatments can cause diarrhea. You might get diarrhea a few days after starting chemo.\n\nIf you have diarrhea, drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. When ready, eat foods such as bananas, applesauce, toast, jello, broth, and popsicles. Ask your doctor if you should take any medications.\n\nTalk to your doctor if the diarrhea lasts over 24 hours, you canât keep liquids down for over 24 hours, you see blood in your poop, or have a fever. Call 911 if you have intense stomach pain or rectal bleeding that wonât go away, or if you canât pee or eat for 24 hours.\n\nChemotherapy and mouth sores\n\nSome kinds of chemotherapy can damage cells in the mouth, throat, and gastrointestinal system. This can lead to cuts or sores in the mouth, sometimes extending into the throat and beyond. They might be red or have small white patches. Some may bleed, leak pus, or be covered in a white or yellow film. You also may notice acid reflux, extra mucus in your mouth, or a dry or burning feeling while you eat. These sores can be painful and make it difficult to eat or swallow.\n\nMouth sores often appear 1-2 weeks after starting treatment and go away 2-4 weeks after treatment ends.\n\nItâs important to talk with your doctor and dentist about preventing and treating mouth sores. Depending on your situation, they might suggest certain mouthwashes or medicines. You also can try:\n\nSucking on ice chips during treatments\n\nEating cold, soft, or moist foods\n\nAvoiding sugary, spicy, acidic, or crunchy foods\n\nDrinking through a straw\n\nUsing a lip balm\n\nCall your doctor if you have:\n\nCuts or sores in the mouth\n\nBleeding gums\n\nWhite patches on the tongue or in the mouth\n\nFever\n\nDifficulty eating or taking medicine\n\nChemotherapy and skin rash\n\nChemotherapy and other cancer treatments can cause changes in the skin. Some people may have dry skin or changes in skin color.\n\nRashes are also common. They can form on the scalp, face, neck, upper back, chest, and other body parts. They might be itchy or painful, or they might cause burning and stinging.\n\nKeep in mind that a skin rash from chemo is not the same as a rash caused by an allergic reaction to chemo. Talk to your doctor about all skin rashes. They can help you find the cause and treat it.\n\nIf you have a rash, keep it clean with warm water and soap, then pat it dry. Stay out of the sun when possible, and wear sunscreen and a hat. Ask your doctor about soap, lotions, or medications that might help.\n\nCall your doctor if:\n\nYouâve tried creams or lotions, but the rash has gotten worse.\n\nThe rash itches for over 48 hours.\n\nThe rash is bleeding or leaking smelly fluids.\n\nThe rash has blisters, crusts, or bright red skin.\n\nThe itchiness or discomfort keeps you awake at night.\n\nYour skin turns yellow.\n\nYou have brown pee.\n\nChemotherapy and nails\n\nCancer treatment can affect nails in many different ways. These changes might affect one or many nails, start soon or a long time after treatment, and be temporary or permanent.\n\nCommon changes include:\n\nPainful or delicate nailbeds.Â Red, swollen, or inflamed nailbeds can be caused by doxorubicin, docetaxel, paclitaxel, and nab-paclitaxel. In some cases, this could lead to painful infections.\n\nDarkening of nails or nailbeds.Â Chemotherapy drugs such as bleomycin, capecitabine, cyclophosphamide, dacarbazine, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, idarubicin, melphalan, and methotrexate can cause your nails to become darker. This is usually temporary.\n\nRidges, pits, or other irregular marks on the nails. Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, docetaxel, hydroxyurea, idarubicin, ifosfamide, and 5-fluorouracil can cause ridges, creases, and unusual discolorations. In addition, doxorubicin, docetaxel, paclitaxel, and nab-paclitaxel can cause splinter hemorrhages, which are tiny red lines that show bleeding beneath the nail. These changes are usually temporary.\n\nNail plate lifting away from skin or falling off.Â Dacarbazine, daunorubicin, and mitoxantrone can cause your nail plate to separate from the skin and possibly fall off. This change is usually temporary. Be careful to avoid infections in the exposed area.\n\nYou can protect your nails by:\n\nWearing a prescription nail polish\n\nTaking a biotin supplement (with your doctorâs approval)\n\nTrimming your nails regularly\n\nKeeping them clean\n\nWearing gloves when washing dishes, gardening, or cleaning\n\nWearing loose-fitting shoes\n\nTell your doctor about any changes in your nails. In some cases, you might need medication or surgery.\n\nChemo brain\n\nChemotherapy and other cancer treatments can cause problems with memory, thinking, and focus. You might have trouble remembering dates, finding words, or multitasking. This is sometimes called âchemo brainâ or âbrain fog.â\n\nBrain fog might start before, during, or after chemotherapy. Scientists arenât sure why it happens. Other health issues may also play a role. But it usually gets better over time.\n\nMeanwhile, some things can relieve brain fog or manage it:\n\nExercise\n\nMeditation\n\nYoga, tai chi, or qi gong\n\nSome types of therapy\n\nRoutines\n\nPuzzles and word games\n\nRest\n\nTell others how you are feeling. Family, friends, and coworkers are often understanding and can help support you. Your doctor can suggest therapies and other coping strategies.\n\nWhen to worry\n\nSome side effects can be signs of bigger problems. Call your doctor right away if you have:\n\nA fever of 100.5 F or higherÂ\n\nUnexplained bleeding or bruising\n\nRash\n\nSwollen mouth or throat\n\nSevere itchiness\n\nTrouble swallowing\n\nTrouble breathing\n\nStrong chills\n\nPain or soreness where the needle or catheter enters your body\n\nUnusual pain\n\nSevere headachesÂ\n\nDiarrhea or vomiting that doesnât go away\n\nBlood in your pee or poop\n\nLong-term side effects\n\nSome side effects might not show up for months or years after chemotherapy. These include:\n\nChemo brain (memory and thinking problems)\n\nHeart, lung, or kidney problems\n\nNerve damage\n\nEarly menopause\n\nInfertility\n\nNew cancer\n\nTalk to your doctor about which side effects, both short- and long-term, are most common for the type of chemotherapy youâre taking. Also, ask about early signs of these side effects. You might be able to help prevent or treat them.\n\nManaging Life During Chemotherapy\n\nChemotherapy can bring up a range of emotions. It might be challenging to adjust to new routines, manage side effects, or deal with your diagnosis. Each person responds differently to these changes. All of this is natural.\n\nBut some things can make your life easier during chemo. Here are some suggestions:\n\nBe gentle with yourself.Â Remember that itâs normal to feel overwhelmed, angry, hopeful, and every other emotion. You can manage these feelings by talking with friends, staying active, eating well, and doing things that you enjoy. Donât put pressure on yourself to feel or act a certain way. Think about seeing a therapist, especially if you feel sad or hopeless for more than 2 weeks. Even if you donât think youâre depressed, a therapist can help you work through the challenges of cancer treatment. Reach out to your doctor right away if you are thinking about hurting or killing yourself.\n\nBe open with others.Â Tell friends and family what youâre going through. This can help ease stress, even if itâs just venting.\n\nAccept help.Â People can help you in different ways, whether thatâs cooking dinner, being flexible with last-minute schedule changes, or simply listening to your concerns. Everyone has different skills and strengths. Think about making a list of things you need a hand with, and letting people choose a task. Getting help doesnât just make your life easier â it helps your friends and family to cope, too.\n\nStay organized.Â When you have cancer, there is a lot of new information to absorb and paperwork to keep track of. Make a folder (either on paper or on your computer) with all your medical information, notes from your doctor visits, medical bills, and insurance statements. That way, everything you need is in one place. You can organize it into tabs or subfolders by date or form type.\n\nFind your new normal.Â Cancer changes a lot of things. You might feel differently, physically and emotionally. You might need to start a treatment routine, accept help you wouldnât normally expect, and find or strengthen your support systems. Take these changes one day at a time. It will take a while to get used to your new normal.\n\nTake care of your hair and scalp.Â Ask your doctor if a cooling cap might safely lower your chances of hair loss. Be gentle with your hair and scalp. Avoid brushing, pulling, or curling it during treatment. You might want to wear a hair net at night or use a satin pillowcase to minimize hair loss. Protect your scalp with sunscreen in nice weather and a hat in cold weather.\n\nTry new styles of headwear. If you have hair loss, itâs important to find a style that makes you feel comfortable and confident. You might want to buy a wig that matches your current hairdo, create a collection of fashionable head wraps and scarves, or shave your head for a bold statement. Research different styles and materials (some may vary in feel, cost, adjustability, and maintenance requirements) to find the option thatâs right for you. The most important thing is that you feel good about yourself.\n\nCan I work during chemo?\n\nChemo affects everyone differently. Itâs hard to know how youâll feel ahead of time, but your doctor can give you an idea of what you can expect. Some people might be able to continue their daily activities, but others might need to take time off work. You can also talk with your boss about working remotely or having flexible hours.\n\nRemember that there are laws to protect you. The Americans With Disabilities Act gives you the right to ask for reasonable accommodations such as getting regular breaks, modifying your job duties, and providing certain equipment. In addition, the Family and Medical Leave Act can protect your job if you need to take time off while you get treatment.\n\nChemotherapy costs include things such as physician and nurse labor, lab testing and imaging, overhead, and more. Because of all these different factors, the cost can vary a lot. Estimates are as high as $48,000.\n\nBut insurance will usually help pay for chemotherapy. The exact amount depends on what plan you have. You might have to spend a certain amount of money (called a deductible) before insurance starts paying for treatment. Plus, you might have to pay a set copay at each visit, or you might pay a certain percentage of the total cost. Make sure to read yourÂ health insurance policy to find out exactly what it will and wonât pay for.Â\n\nFor example, Medicare Part A only covers chemotherapy thatâs given during an inpatient hospital stay. If you get it as an outpatient, youâll need to use Medicare Part B. As soon as you meet your deductible, Medicare Part B will start paying for most of the costs. You will still need to pay a set copayment at each visit (if youâre getting chemo at an outpatient hospital clinic) or 20% of the bill (if youâre getting chemo at a doctorâs office or freestanding clinic). In addition, you may still need to pay for the drug itself. Medicare Part D covers some chemotherapy drugs, but not all.\n\nWhen in doubt, call your insurance company to ask questions. Do this before starting treatment to avoid any unpleasant surprises. Your doctor might need to write a letter explaining why you need a certain treatment.\n\nIf you have trouble paying your bills, you can talk to your doctorâs billing team or hospital financial counselor. You might be able to get:\n\nLower rates\n\nPayment plans (you pay the bill a little bit at a time)\n\nPatient assistance\n\nSome charities and organizations can help pay for treatment and other needs.Â CancerCare (and its aid search tool,Â A Helping Hand), theÂ Cancer Financial Assistance Coalition, and the National Cancer Institute support services directory are good places to start.\n\nSigns Chemotherapy Is Working\n\nThe only surefire ways to know that chemo is working are medical tests and imaging. So, your doctor might suggest regular tests. These might include blood tests, X-rays, and other imaging.\n\nMedical tests can help your doctor see if treatment is working. If itâs not, they can adjust the treatment plan or try something new.\n\nTakeaways\n\nChemotherapy is a powerful type of cancer treatment. It works by killing cancer cells or stopping them from multiplying. But it also can have significant side effects. If you have cancer, talk to your doctor about whether chemotherapy is right for you, and if so, which kind.\n\nChemotherapy FAQs\n\nHow will I feel after my first chemo treatment?\n\nEveryone responds to chemo differently. Your doctor can guess which side effects you might have, but ultimately you wonât know until you start treatment. Have a loved one drive you to your first treatment, just in case you donât feel well afterward.\n\nWhat happens when chemo works?Â\n\nChemotherapy can be used to kill cancer cells, prevent cancer from spreading, or ease cancer symptoms. Your doctor will prescribe medical tests and scans to see whether it is working.\n\nWhat should you expect when someone starts chemo?\n\nWhen someone starts chemo, they might feel many different emotions. They may also have physical side effects. Itâs important to support them during this time, whether thatâs through making them dinner, driving their kids to school, or simply listening to them."
