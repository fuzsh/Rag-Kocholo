        "text": "It was New Year’s Eve 1915, and Roscoe Arbuckle and Mabel Normand were heading out of California for New York. A new company, Triangle, had been created, incorporating New York Motion Pictures, Keystone, The Griffith Fine Art Studio and Ince studios. As recorded in previous blogs, 1915 had been a sour time for Fatty and Mabel, with Keystone boss, Mack Sennett, keeping their noses to the grindstone, turning out slapstick nonsense and gooey love scenes. Both Roscoe and Mabel were heartily sick of it, and Mabel (a devious little minx), via her NY connections, persuaded the Triangle bosses to bring the pair, and a small company, to New York to make a few films that would showcase the newly-born Triangle Company. The Fatty and Mabel series of films, the sensation of 1915, had been big money-spinners at the box office, but now the Keystone pair wanted to try something else — dramatic comedy, and that was impossible under Mack Sennett.\n\nThe facts about this move east have been gleaned from the hundreds of news stories, telling of Roscoe and Mabel’s trip east, which was to bring excited rednecks, teenage girls, old maids and top-hatted gents alike, to the various rail stations through which they travelled. This was going to be some show, in an era where few movie fans were able to actually see their favourite screen stars in person. Accompanying Roscoe and Mabel, Minta Arbuckle, Al St. Johns and a handful of other Keystone regulars, were a number of newspaper men, glad of the chance to tell the story of this adventure – for such it was. Also aboard were some movie big-shots, such as Wm. Selig of the Selig Polyscope Company. Among the many pressmen was James R. Quirk, tireless editor of Photoplay magazine (and Popular Mechanics!) as well as close confident of Miss Mabel Normand. He’d write glowingly of Mabel down the years, but fifteen years later, he’d be writing her obituary. This blog tells the story of a journalist assigned by his L.A. editor to travel east with the Keystone company. Let’s imagine that, say, forty years later, he writes honestly about Roscoe and Mabel, leaving out the usual glowing tributes. So, here it is:\n\nIt was four in the afternoon on December 30th that I handed my latest story to my editor. After glancing through the text, he peered over his glasses at me and said:\n\n“It’s not your wife’s birthday today is it – not having a party or anything, are you?”\n\n“No sir, just a quiet dinner at Levy’s Café, with a few friends.”\n\n“Well scrub the dinner, you’re on the night train to Sacramento. Tomorrow you’ll be on your way to New York with Fatty and Mabel”\n\nWell, my chin hit the floor – me, recently a junior reporter, travelling 3,000 miles east with Fatty and Mabel! I couldn’t believe it! Fatty was big in pictures, and Mabel was huge — so huge that she’d recently polled as best comedienne, gaining 100,000 more votes than Mary Pickford (Best Dramatic Leading Lady).\n\n“It’s true enough, young man. Be at Sacramento rail station for the off, at mid-day tomorrow.”\n\n“Why not Los Angeles, boss?”\n\n“Ours is not to question why, young man, but it seems Miss Mabel wants the shortest possible route.”\n\nWell, it seems I’d be over-nighting in Sacramento, although I didn’t expect any sleep. The words “Fatty and Mabel, Fatty and Mabel” just kept going around in my mind. I made the Sacramento station in good time next day, but a huge crowd had already gathered. Pushing my way forward in typical press style, I found the cops had made a little clearing by the tracks, where the Keystoners were gathered. Mack Sennett was organising the Keystone cameras, as little Mabel was trying to handle about a dozen huge bouquets of flowers. She looked tiny, in a fur coat with a white stole around her shoulders…. she resembled a child in her mother’s clothes. Fortunately, I was well-acquainted with Miss Mabel, and knew that when you spoke to her, she was in no way child-like. I can tell you, it was like a gathering of the stars, with Alice Joyce, Blanche Sweet, Norma Talmadge, Louise Fazenda, Dotty Gish, and Dixie Chene, waving Mabel off with handfuls of confetti.\n\n“Hello, Mabel!” I shouted, as I made my way to a carriage door.”\n\n“Hello, lover boy, here catch these.” She shouted back as she threw a truckload of bouquets at me.”\n\nMabel turned to the assembled pressmen.\n\n“John here, and my good self are to be married.” She said pointing at me and then, a diamond on her ring finger. Some journo at the back shouted:\n\n“He’s already got a wife!”\n\n“Damn, I forgot about the wife!” She replied with feigned regret.\n\nThe conductor blew his whistle, and I held my hand out to help Mabel aboard. She made a pretend slip on the steps, just to please the cameras. Roscoe followed, slipped, and fell backwards onto the ground, where he rolled about a bit in the dust, before standing and making a bow to the crowd. As the train pulled out, the ‘Triangulars’ ran to the open back of the observation car, and waved California goodbye. Then it was “Show me to the bar, man” and, at that point, I realised Roscoe and Mabel were committed city people – they would not be watching the scenery gliding by. The bar offered me an unparalleled opportunity to have Fatty and Mabel to myself. Most of the movie and press people were on the first lunch sitting, but the Keystone pair stayed put. Everyone left in the bar was either in awe of the stars, or grumbled into their scotch, about prima donnas and bad people.\n\n“Well, this is a welcome quiet moment for you two” I said.\n\n“Quiet now, but not three years ago, when Mabel came out here with Sennett!” Answered Roscoe.\n\n“What do you mean?” I asked.\n\nRoscoe’s mouth opened, but was immediately plugged by the scowling Mabel’s hand.\n\n“Don’t you dare, Roscoe” she said.\n\nRoscoe was beside himself with laughter, as he pushed Mabel’s hand away.\n\n“Back then…. back then, everyone on the train thought she was a white slave girl, travelling with five middle-aged men — all pimps you know.”\n\nHe tried to take a swig of beer, but was unable to stifle his giggles. Mabel sat there fuming with folded arms, as Roscoe continued.\n\n“Well, she was the talk of the train, but as she passed an old maid’s compartment, the aged witch mouthed the word ‘whore’ through the window”\n\nRoscoe broke down in hysterics:\n\n“Mabel promptly lifted her skirts to reveal – no bloomers! The old girl collapsed and had to be stretchered off the train with palpitations!”\n\nMabel sat there scowling and said:\n\n“Yes, alright, I was a bad girl then, but not now”\n\n“Oh, I don’t know” Said Roscoe, as he worked an arm around Mabel’s waist “I’ve heard you’re still quite a naughty girl”\n\nMabel’s face went into the famous pout, as she glanced around saying:\n\n“Quit that, Roscoe, Minta could walk in at any moment”\n\nI realised this was going to be a hell of a trip with the great Keystone slap-stickers. I also realised that Mabel would never form a relationship with a married man, due no doubt to her religious upbringing. Single guys, particularly hunks and heart throbs, were, however, on the menu for the Hollywood man-eater. Then, the movie crowd returned from the dining car and my exclusive scoop with Fatty and Mabel was over. However, I soon learned how to arrange it, so that I had Roscoe, Mabel or both, to myself. Often Minta Arbuckle was present, which provided another channel into the Keystone mindset. Minta, I can tell you, had one eye focused on Roscoe at all times – he was not to be trusted, and I can also tell you there was a lot of messing around between Fatty and Mabel that could be misconstrued. Sometimes, Minta marched Fatty to the observation car, and two or three times, I had Mabel completely to myself. I told her to keep an eye open for Pearl White, who was travelling in the opposite direction, east to west.\n\n“Why would I – all I would see is a reflection of myself, except that she wears a blond wig!” Mabel answered.\n\nI asked her if she resented Pearl White stepping into her territory in the ‘Perils of Pauline’ series.\n\n“Not at all, we occupy different areas of the film market – she’s a debutante, I’m a straight forward, ordinary girl. One thing Pauline will never do, is steal the young female audience from me” Was Miss Mabel’s answer.\n\nMabel an ordinary girl? Now that’s something. Being a journalist by nature, I had tried to come up with a short phrase or word that could encompass all the vagaries of Madcap Mabel’s personality. I tried the immortal ‘It’ that Elinor Glyn used in her famous book of that name, but that was too stark and did not allow for the inconsistencies and contradictions of Mabel’s inner self. Then one day, several years later, some bright spark coined the term ‘Mabelescence’. On that day, the world knew that Mabel possessed that unique quality, Mabelescence – Mabel was ‘Mabelescent’, and our long, painful period of brain-wracking was over.\n\nMabel Meets The Mormons (or not).\n\nIt was around three in the afternoon that we rolled into Reno, Nevada. We knew we’d arrived, when we saw the banner saying ‘Reno welcomes Fatty and Mabel’. Roscoe and Mabel knew what this meant. It meant meeting the town’s mayor and local dignitaries, who, Mabel expressed, would certainly speak some unintelligible lingo, laced with a ‘covered wagon’ accent. The mayor and his entourage boarded the train and asked if the Keystone duo would like to come to his house for drinks, but fortunately the conductor intervened, saying there wasn’t time. So it was that the cowpokes departed, leaving The Keystone Girl buried under bouquets and a cowboy hat perched on her head. Mabel threw said hat off, when Roscoe told her that cowboys never washed. Inevitably, the flowers were distributed around the train.\n\nThen we were off for our appointment with God’s Own at the city on the Salt Lake. Again, Roscoe began his began his spiel:\n\n“You wanna watch those Mormons, Mabes, they love eating little girls like you! If you’re lucky, you’ll simply disappear into the Mayor’s harem”\n\n“Well, Mister Arbuckle, I might just fancy being in a harem, but one, preferably, deep in the desert and serviced by a Sheik of Old Araby.”\n\nAlert readers will realise that the New Year chimed in during the night, but I’ll skip the festivities, as you can guess who created the ruckus. Our arrival in Salt Lake City, early in the morning, was preceded by no little activity among the Keystoners, as a photo shoot had been planned. Mabel, Roscoe and Minta were planning their own special postcard to Mack Sennett. They’d obtain one of the official Keystone photos, stick it on a card and send it with a message. Mabel thought it should be short and sweet, saying simply “Fuck you Sennett.” Minta was horrified – she and Roscoe were not ready to leave Keystone. It was O.K. for Mabel, at any one time she had loads of offers of work. In the end, a compromise. The card would simply say:\n\n“Having a great time. Glad you’re not here.”\n\nMembers of the local populace came out to welcome the company, although the City Fathers did not make an appearance, due to most of the Keystoners being Catholics, or more specifically, Irish Catholics. Then it was onward to Denver and Chicago. While Minta and her friends were enjoying the scenery and games of backgammon, Fatty and Mabel were getting more and more edgy and were building up like volcanoes. Being cooped up on a train for five days did not suit them. Around the studio, Roscoe always amused himself by outsmarting the guards on the female dressing room, and getting crap games going. Meanwhile, Mabel would have been attaching live wires to door handles or balancing buckets of water on the tops of doors. Now a train had become their prison. When the Biograph company came west with D.W. Griffith, they’d put on improvised plays to keep everyone amused, so the Keystoners decided to do the same. However, the efforts of a comedy unit are slightly different, and with 280-pound Roscoe bouncing about there was going to be a risk of derailment. Everyone would get an equal chance in the little play, with no favouritism for stars, and the players managed to pull in some passengers to fill roles. Fatty and Mabel kept as low-key (professionally) as possible, and Mabel noticed a young girl that was clearly a natural actress. She gave the girl the address of New York Motion Pictures with her letter of recommendation, and told the girl look them up in New York. However, it was crafty William Selig that signed her up – on the train. She later became a big star.\n\nWhen the train rolled into Denver, we all departed the train for hotel rooms, which made a change from the rather sparse roomettes on the train. The movie people had their own little get together in the lounge that lasted till around 2 p.m. when everyone retired except Minta, Roscoe, Mabel and myself. After a bit, Minta dragged a well-sozzled Fatty off to their room, leaving me alone, under subdued lights, with – The Keystone Girl. This worried me, given Mabel’s reputation around Hollywood, but I considered myself ‘safe’ as a married man. There was little chance of being ‘jumped’ by the real-life vamp of Tinsel Town, now ever so slightly intoxicated. I nodded over to where Minta and Roscoe were leaving through the lounge door:\n\n“He’s quite a character, old Roscoe, isn’t he?”\n\n“Yes, he is a lovely man, and very much misunderstood?”\n\nI chanced my arm:\n\n“Do you have feelings for him?”\n\n“Yes, I do, all the girls do.”\n\n“Enough to marry him, perhaps, if he was single?”\n\n“Marry him, hell no! Marriage means sharing a bed with a guy, and I’d be insane to share a bed with Roscoe – I’d be crushed to death in seconds! I know it, he once sat on my head during a scene, and put me in hospital for three weeks.”\n\nI chanced my other arm.\n\n“You know we all expected you to marry Chaplin, Mabel.”\n\n“Well, that’s the way the cookie crumbles. Please don’t mention that bastard. He walked out on me, but one day…….one day, I’ll have my revenge on the fucking asshole.”\n\n“Do you mean that Mabel?”\n\n“No, I guess I don’t”\n\nMabel did eventually did wreak her revenge, not on Chaplin, but on his leading lady, Edna Purviance. Sweet as Mabel was, she bore a grudge forever, and it was best not to mess with the Queen of Hollywood.\n\nThe next day we were on our way to Chicago, with the obligatory stops for ‘mayoral shows’. Fatty and Mabel became ever more edgy in their rail-borne cage, and we had instances of Fatty flicking food around the dining car, along with Mabel openly using vulgar language and falling off her bar stool, ‘pissed’, as Charlie Chaplin would say. Mostly it was impossible to get to Mabel. Wherever she went, she was surrounded by adoring men and cooing women. The pair knew what was waiting for them in Chicago – a huge publicity shindig. However, Fatty and Mabel continued with their antics, which kept them and everyone else amused. As we walked in a group into the dining car on one occasion, Mabel was wearing what was, essentially, a billowing party dress. Fatty, walking behind, looked at me with a mischievous eye, then grabbed Mabel’s dress low down and yanked the whole ensemble, including a flurry of petticoats, up above her waist. Immediately he yanked it down again, saying, in a shocked and half-whispered voice, “No drawers!” It happened so fast, few people noticed, and Roscoe only received a light tap from Mabel for his indiscretion. I know what you’re thinking – was she really ‘drawerless’. In fact, what she was wearing took me aback. In an era of passion-killing bloomers, she was wearing that rare thing for those days – red-satin, lacy French knickers, no doubt imported straight from Paris. Today, think cami-knickers.\n\nIn The Windy City.\n\nWe rolled into Chicago, with Roscoe and Mabel biting their finger-nails. The crowds had gathered for miles out of town, and the banners saying ‘CHICAGO WELCOMES FATTY AND MABEL’ increased as we got further in. Roscoe was not amused at the Fatty reference, and Mabel was visibly trembling. As the train doors began opening, she grabbed a firm hold of my jacket with her shaking hand, and we exited the train like co-joined twins. As the cameras began to click and whirr, the Keystone manager prised Mabel’s hand from my jacket. Fatty and Mabel were brought together, but Mabel had sense enough not to hold hands. The Mayor’s presentation was huge and overwhelming, and everyone wanted a piece of Fatty and Mabel. The Keystone entourage was immediately transferred to The College Inn in a fleet of fancy cars. No-one had ever seen anything like it. Never before, had film stars been feted as royalty. The luncheon at The College was a grand affair with Miss Mabel again being showered with bouquets. Mabel looked at one label, on a large bunch of orchids, she looked around to find a large, swarthy man in a white suit, studded with diamonds, waving at her from across the room. I peeked at the label – it said “Love you Mabel, from Diamond Jim Colosimo.” Mabel was mightily impressed by Big Jim’s diamonds, and I can tell you, when Mabel saw diamonds, something happened in her eyes. Jim was then, of course, busy collecting film actresses. At the time, we didn’t know who Diamond Jim was, but before long, we’d hear of him and his henchmen, John Torrio and a certain Alphonse Capone.\n\nAll too soon, we were piling into cars and heading for the rail station. The change that came over Mabel was palpable – she was on the last leg home. This was only her second time back east in nearly four years. When questioned, Mabel said she wouldn’t be going home to Staten Island, as she was sure to be waylaid by the Mayor of New Brighton. Ditto Long Island and Rhode Island, as both of the latter had made her their own (that’s right, she was born, apparently, in three places, simultaneously).\n\nNew York Looks Good from Here.\n\nThe last leg to NY breezed by, and we arrived at the Grand Central Station in a day and a half. The crowds and banners started fifteen miles out, and as we got further in, we were seeing “WELCOME HOME FATTY AND MABEL.” Naturally, Manhattan wasn’t Mabel’s home, and furthermore, New York was three thousand miles from Roscoe’s home. As we pulled into the station, we saw the platform was just about solid with people, and there were Ford Sterling and Syd Chaplin, jumping up and down. NYMP bosses Kessell and Baumann were there grinning broadly, alongside Ada Baumann, and there was Teddy Sampson with big Triangle boss, Harry Aitken. Had New York gone crazy? As Roscoe and Mabel stepped off the train, they were mobbed. First to Mabel was old friend, Ada Baumann, who hugged Mabel and thrust a huge bouquet into her hands. Very excited, she led Mabel to her beaming father, Charlie Baumann, at which time the lecherous Syd Chaplin muscled into the melee.\n\nSyd, of course was a comic guy, who soon had a party atmosphere going. Baumann orchestrated a long camera shoot with the press and NYMP guys clicking away like crazy. The seething mass of movie folk, press and citizens’ army made their way to Rector’s Restaurant on Longacre, AKA Times Square, where a large corporate party was arranged. Many famous New Yorkers attended, including another Diamond Jim – Brady. Notable was impresario David Belasco, of theatrical fame, who confessed to me that he was there to try to snatch Miss Mabel for the boards. Kessell and Baumann kept a close eye on Mr. Belasco. Both Fatty (an opera singer) and Mabel were keen to see the shows on Broadway, and were invited by the New York Globe to attend The Lexington Opera House for a viewing of Peter Rabbit in Wonderland, which presumably Mr Belasco would present, given the chance, as Mabel in Wonderland. In the interval Fatty and Mabel were picked out in floodlights and received a standing ovation.\n\nFatty And Mabel At The Grindstone.\n\nThe pairing soon disappeared into Fort Lee, where they worked tirelessly on a new, special and unique picture, ‘He Did and He Didn’t’. Its genre was melodramatic-comedy, something nobody had tried before, and, it was, a ‘finger’ to Mack Sennett from Fatty and Mabel. The film took the movie world by storm. I returned to L.A. in mid-January, hoping I’d be asked to accompany Fatty and Mabel back to L.A. in March. When March came, I asked the editor if I could return to NY. He replied “No point John, Mabel has disappeared and every newspaper, including ours, has private dicks out looking for her. Then, articles appeared in the movie mags to the effect that Mabel had left Keystone and signed with The Mutual to do ‘Chaplin pictures’. A week later, the world went loco, as it was announced that Mabel had re-signed for NYMP, and would have her own studio out in Hollywood. We all greeted her at San Bernardino, as she returned in triumph – the first actress (or actor) to have her own studio, with her name on the roof in 5-feet high letters. Emblazoned beside her name was the logo ‘The Mabel Normand Feature Film Company’. The girl from Staten Island had made it.\n\nImpressions of Fatty and Mabel.\n\nRoscoe Arbuckle was ‘as you find him’. He was a big man with a big heart and, like Mabel, he was also crude and vulgar in his mannerisms and actions. Mabel was, shall we say, a little more inscrutable. Beyond her crudity and vulgarity, she was unbelievably charming, and I found her both bewitching and fascinating, her personality having originated in that explosive mix of the French and the Irish. People ask me “Was she pretty?” Of course, she was, but she wasn’t beautiful. Beauty implies perfection, but Mabel was not perfect, nor flawless. A beautiful woman, in facial terms, lacks character, and Mabel had character in abundance. Her eyes came straight from the cod fish, and her teeth would put ‘Goofy’ to shame. Her hair had a bit of a frizz about it, and could make her look wild when needed, and all of this made her just about the most versatile actress in Hollywood, at a time when facial gestures were king in the movies. Down Hollywood way, Mabel was Queen, and the actors and actresses her subjects, regardless of her vulgarity – Mabel never said she needed to go to the bathroom, she always needed to…….do something else. Blanche Sweet explained her this way “She was the sweetest, cutest little thing you’d ever seen, but, when she opened her pretty mouth, toads came out – but nobody minded.” The ‘nobody minded’ is the essence of the Mabel Normand story.\n\nRoscoe Arbuckle, unlike his Keystone predecessor, Fred Mace, was a guy that lived for the moment. He held no political views or, in fact, views of any kind, and was devoid of any life rules. Mabel, on the other hand, held some religious views, hammered into her by her mother. Beyond that, she held strong political views, revolving around women’s emancipation and fairness, and was robustly socialist and democratic. She told me how she supported the Industrial Workers of the World movement, and respected the work of socialists like Irishmen Jim Larkin and James Connolly.\n\nFatty and Mabel — The Friends.\n\nRoscoe, or the Arbuckles, were Mabel’s greatest friends, for life, although they were particularly close between 1913 and 1916. During her Keystone period, Mabel often weekended with the Arbuckles, at their beach house in Santa Monica. Minta found Mabel delightful, and never worried when she and Roscoe went off swimming from Santa Monica to Venice and back, every Sunday. Roscoe called Mabel ‘Mabes’ but to Mabel, Roscoe was always Roscoe, and she never used the term ‘Fatty’. Minta, she always called, for some inexplicable reason, ‘Mintatraffie’. When Mabel feigned a head injury in October 1915, and Mack Sennett was searching all over L.A. for her, she was holed up at the Arbuckle’s beach house for three weeks. Three glorious weeks off work. I’m glad to say that I knew Fatty and Mabel when they were young, bright and outrageous, but, within a few years, the dark clouds would descend upon them, and their happiness would be a mere memory.\n\nBibliography.\n\nMabel Normand: A Sourcebook of her Life and Films by Wm.
