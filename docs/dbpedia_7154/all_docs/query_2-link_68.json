        "text": "Causes and Symptoms\n\nWhat causes MASLD?\n\nMASLD, also known as NAFLD, is estimated to affect up to 1 in 5 people in the UK. Rates are increasing with rising levels of obesity. Although most cases of MASLD are linked to excess weight, you can develop the disease if you have a healthy weight.\n\nThese things increase the risk of MASLD:\n\nA weight in the overweight or obese range\n\nA high waist measurement\n\nType 2 diabetes\n\nA diet with too many unhealthy foods and drinks\n\nLow levels of physical activity or spending a lot of time sitting down\n\nHigh blood lipids such as cholesterol\n\nHigh blood pressure\n\nOther conditions linked to insulin resistance for example polycystic ovary syndrome\n\nCheck if you are at risk of liver disease\n\nFatty liver is a stage in many types of liver disease. In these diseases it is caused by other things, for example alcohol or side effects from a medicine. Your doctor will check if these things could play a role. Read more about the fatty liver stage of liver disease.\n\nRelated conditions\n\nFatty liver disease is one of a cluster of conditions that are linked to how the body produces, uses and stores energy from food (metabolism). This includes heart and circulatory diseases, type 2 diabetes, and other conditions linked to insulin resistance.\n\nThese conditions often develop together and the same person can have several of them. If you are diagnosed with fatty liver disease or any other metabolic condition talk to your GP. They can monitor your risk of developing a related condition and help you to reduce it.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of MASLD?\n\nThere are often no specific symptoms, even if the disease is at a later stage. You may not show any symptoms for many years. If you have MASLD or NAFLD you may have:\n\nTiredness, fatigue or a general feeling of lethargy or having no energy\n\nDiscomfort on the upper right side of your tummy (where your liver is)\n\nIf you develop any of the following symptoms tell a doctor straight away:\n\nyellowness of the eyes and skin (jaundice) – this may be harder to notice if you have black or brown skin\n\nbruising easily\n\ndark urine\n\nswelling of the tummy area (ascites)\n\nvomiting blood\n\ndark black tarry poo\n\nperiods of confusion, forgetting things, mood changes or poor judgement (encephalopathy)\n\nitching skin\n\nEven if you have no symptoms if you are at risk and are worried ask your doctor for a test.\n\nBack to top\n\nThe different names for fatty liver disease\n\nIn 2023 an international group of doctors, scientists and patients announced that NAFLD would change its name to MASLD. These are both medical names for fatty liver disease.\n\nIt will take time for everyone to start using the new names, so for now you will probably hear and read a mix of names. Knowing the different names can help make conversations clearer – but you can use whatever name you’re most comfortable with. In our information, we use all the names to help everyone find what they need. Use the form at the bottom of the page to let us know how we’re doing.\n\nThe new name MASLD stands for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. Some of these words are only really used by doctors and scientists, so lots of people don’t know what they all mean.\n\nMetabolic means connected with how your body uses and stores energy from food. Other metabolic diseases include type 2 diabetes and heart disease. They are all linked to things like weight, diet, physical activity, and blood pressure.\n\nDysfunction means that something isn’t working properly or has gone wrong.\n\nAssociated means linked to or caused by.\n\nSteatotic means fatty.\n\nSo all together the name MASLD means fatty liver disease caused by something going wrong with how your body uses and stores energy. For example, gaining weight leading to your body storing too much fat in your liver.\n\nThe more serious form of MASLD is called MASH – metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. The hepatitis part means inflammation in your liver.\n\nThe old name NAFLD stands for non-alcohol related fatty liver disease. The more serious form is NASH or non-alcohol related steatohepatitis.\n\nFatty liver is an early stage in many different types of liver disease. Inflammation, or hepatitis, is the next stage after fatty liver. Read more about the stages of liver disease.\n\nFibrosis (scarring) tests and scores\n\nIt is very important that the amount of scarring in your liver is tested as part of your MASLD or NAFLD diagnosis. This is the main sign of how advanced your liver disease is.\n\nFibrosis is the medical term for scarring. It is measured on a scale of 0 to 4. The higher the number, the more fibrosis there is and the more severe it is.\n\nThere are 2 main ways to check if you’re likely to have advanced fibrosis (stage 3 or 4) without doing a biopsy – blood tests or a liver scan (transient elastography eg FibroScan).\n\nMany doctors use a scoring system that pools results from several routine blood tests. Common fibrosis scoring systems include:\n\nThe Fibrosis (FIB)-4 score which uses 3 blood tests and your age\n\nThe NAFLD Fibrosis Score which uses 4 blood tests and information about your age, weight (BMI) and whether you have diabetes\n\nThe Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) test which uses a combination of 3 blood tests.\n\nThe score doesn’t say exactly how much scarring there is in your liver. Your doctor or nurse will interpret the result to decide what to do.\n\nThere are 3 possible results:\n\nA low risk means advanced fibrosis can be safely ruled out.\n\nThis means you don’t have later stage MASLD including cirrhosis. Your GP will continue to manage your care. They should do a fibrosis test every 3 years to check your condition hasn’t got worse.\n\nIndeterminate risk means it doesn’t say for sure whether you have advanced fibrosis or not.\n\nYou should be offered further tests to find out. These could include scans or a liver biopsy.\n\nA high risk means that you probably have advanced fibrosis.\n\nIt’s likely you have later stage MASLD and you may have cirrhosis. You will be referred to a specialist liver doctor (hepatologist or gastroenterologist) who will do further tests and manage your care from then on.\n\nBack to top\n\nWho will manage my care?\n\nGPs manage care for earlier stage fatty liver disease (primary care)\n\nThis can include fatty liver and MASH or NASH with mild or moderate fibrosis.\n\nYour liver has little or no long-term damage or scarring and is probably still working well. By eating healthily, doing plenty of physical activity and keeping your weight in a healthy range you have a good chance of repairing any damage and reversing your fatty liver disease.\n\nYour doctor or nurse will have a conversation with you about your weight, the foods you eat, and how physically active you are. They’ll give you information and help you decide and plan the changes you want to make.\n\nThe aim is to build healthy habits that will fit in with your life and help you stay well in the future.\n\nYou should have a check-up for fatty liver disease at least once a year. This should include checks on your risk of developing a condition related to fatty liver disease.\n\nYour GP can check your:\n\nweight and body mass index (BMI)\n\nblood glucose\n\nblood pressure\n\nblood lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides).\n\nEvery 3 years you should have testing for advanced fibrosis. This is to check that your condition is stable and not getting worse. This is important because there are often no symptoms to tell you or your clinical team that your liver is getting more damaged.\n\nHospital specialists manage care for later stage MASLD or NAFLD (secondary care)\n\nThis can include MASH or NASH with moderate or advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis.\n\nThe level of scarring in your liver means you are at higher risk of liver failure or liver cancer. To reduce this risk it is very important to keep your weight in the healthy range, eat healthily and be physically active. As well as stopping your condition getting worse, it can still be possible to reverse some liver damage.\n\nThe main person in charge of your care will be a doctor who specialises in either the liver (hepatologist) or the digestive system (gastroenterologist). They may write you a care plan, which sets out what appointments you have and who else is in your Multidisciplinary Team (MDT).\n\nYour MDT are there to give you any help you need to improve your MASLD. They can also help you to manage some other medical conditions alongside your MASLD. Your MDT could include:\n\na specialist liver nurse\n\na dietitian\n\na psychologist\n\na physical activity specialist.\n\nPeople with cirrhosis should be offered scans to check for liver cancer every 6 months. This is called surveillance.\n\nIf you have or develop cirrhosis your clinical team will advise on what other treatment you need. Read more about cirrhosis.\n\nHow is fatty liver disease treated?\n\nTreatment for fatty liver disease (MASLD or NAFLD) has 2 main aims:\n\nTo stop the condition getting worse, so that it does not lead to liver cancer or liver failure.\n\nTo help your liver repair as much of the damage as possible.\n\nThe main treatment is eating a healthy diet, being more physically active and (if needed) losing weight. This might seem like very general advice, but these steps all reduce liver fat and inflammation. For example, for people who are overweight, evidence shows losing 5 to 10% of their bodyweight can stop and sometimes even reverse liver damage.\n\nThere are currently no medicines available in the UK to specifically treat MASLD. But there is a lot of research being done to develop some. You can help by taking part in research. Ask your clinical team about clinical trials in your area or visit the Be Part of Research website.\n\nHow your care is managed depends on how serious your MASLD is and how much scarring (fibrosis) there is in your liver. Read about tests for scarring.\n\nLower your risk of related conditions\n\nSteps to be healthier lower your risk of heart and circulatory disease, type 2 diabetes, liver cancer and other conditions linked to fatty liver disease.\n\nThe most common cause of death in people with fatty liver disease is heart and circulatory disease. So it’s important to keep your heart healthy as well as your liver. Make sure that conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes are well managed. If you are managing multiple conditions tell your clinical team and ask them how they can help. Statins are safe for most people with fatty liver disease. If you have been prescribed statins it is important that you continue to take them. If you have any questions speak to your clinical team who can give advice tailored to you.\n\nBack to top\n\nHow healthy living can treat and reverse fatty liver disease\n\nWhatever your weight, eating healthily and being more physically active can each help reduce liver fat and improve fatty liver disease. For most people these are the best ways to lose weight, if you need to.\n\nReducing liver fat takes away the root cause of fatty liver disease. By doing this, you reduce the strain on your liver and give it a chance to repair itself. Research shows all 3 of these things can slow, stop and even reverse MASLD and NAFLD.\n\nMake small changes that you can stick with in the long term. Your clinical team are there to help you. And we have information and advice to support you every step of the way.\n\nKeep a healthy weight\n\nIf you are overweight, the most important thing you can do to improve your condition is to lose weight. Research shows that losing 5 to 10% of your body weight can control and in some cases reverse MASLD.\n\nIf you are a healthy weight, it’s important to avoid gaining weight. This can make your fatty liver disease worse. Read more about keeping a healthy weight.\n\nEat a well-balanced diet\n\nThere is no magic diet or specific list of foods and drinks that will cure you or to avoid completely. Instead for most people a well-balanced diet is the best way to stay healthy and manage your weight.\n\nThe aim is to generally eat and drink healthily most of the time and not have too much or too little of anything. The overall picture is more important than any one small detail. If you are struggling to change your diet, ask to be referred to a dietitian. Find out more about how to eat a well-balanced diet.\n\nBe more physically active\n\nAim to do at least 2½ hours of physical activity every week that gets you a bit out of breath. Brisk walking, team sports, swimming and dancing all count. You can break it down into smaller bouts of 10 minutes at a time.\n\nAlso do activities to strengthen your muscles twice a week. This could be things like yoga, chair exercises, working with weights or even carrying heavy shopping.\n\nDon’t worry if you can’t do the target amount at first. Start small and build up the amount you do over time – remember that any activity is better than none.\n\nYour doctor can advise you on types of activity that would suit you. Find out more about physical activity and exercise.\n\nBack to top\n\nMake a donation\n\nAll of our services are funded by donations.
