        "text": "What is stomach cancer (gastric cancer)?\n\nWith stomach cancer — also called gastric cancer — cancer cells grow out of control in your stomach. Cancer can form anywhere in your stomach. In the U.S., most cases of stomach cancer involve abnormal cell growth in the place where your stomach meets your esophagus (gastroesophageal junction). In other countries, where gastric cancer is more common, cancer usually forms in the main part of your stomach.\n\nAbout 95% of the time, stomach cancer starts in your stomach lining and progresses slowly. Untreated, it can form a mass (tumor) and grow deeper into your stomach walls. The tumor may spread to nearby organs like your liver and pancreas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n\nWho does stomach cancer affect?\n\nAnyone can develop stomach cancer, but certain demographic factors may increase your risk. You’re more likely to get stomach cancer if:\n\nYou’re 65 or over.\n\nYou were assigned male at birth.\n\nYour ethnic background is East Asian, South or Central American or Eastern European.\n\nHow common is stomach cancer?\n\nStomach cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide but is seen less often in the U.S. Only about 1.5% of stomach cancers get diagnosed each year in the U.S., where cases have been declining steadily for the past 10 years.\n\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of stomach cancer?\n\nStomach cancer doesn’t typically cause symptoms during the early stages. Even the most common early signs of stomach cancer — often unexplained weight loss and stomach pain — don’t usually show up until the cancer is more advanced.\n\nSymptoms of stomach cancer include:\n\nLoss of appetite.\n\nTrouble swallowing.\n\nFatigue or weakness.\n\nNausea and vomiting.\n\nUnexplained weight loss.\n\nHeartburn and indigestion.\n\nBlack stool (poop) or vomiting blood.\n\nFeeling bloated or gassy after eating.\n\nStomach pain, often above your belly button.\n\nFeeling full even after eating a small meal or snack.\n\nMany of these symptoms are common in other conditions, too. See your provider to check if your symptoms are a sign of stomach cancer or another disease.\n\nCan you feel a tumor in your stomach?\n\nYour provider may be able to feel a mass in your stomach during a physical exam depending on how advanced the cancer is. More often, however, symptoms involve recognizing sensations in your stomach. Your stomach may frequently feel swollen, full or painful. The pain may start as mild and then get more intense as the disease progresses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat causes stomach cancer?\n\nStomach cancer forms when there’s a genetic mutation (change) in the DNA of your stomach cells. DNA is the code that tells cells when to grow and when to die. Because of the mutation, the cells grow rapidly and eventually form a tumor instead of dying. The cancer cells overtake healthy cells and may spread to other parts of your body (metastasize).\n\nResearchers don’t know what causes the mutation. Still, certain factors seem to increase the likelihood of developing stomach cancer. They include:\n\nFamily history of stomach cancer.\n\nHelicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection.\n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\n\nGastritis.\n\nEpstein-Barr virus infection.\n\nHistory of stomach ulcers or stomach polyps.\n\nA diet high in fatty, salty, smoked or pickled foods.\n\nA diet that doesn’t include many fruits and vegetables.\n\nFrequent exposure to substances like coal, metal and rubber.\n\nSmoking, vaping or chewing tobacco.\n\nDrinking too much alcohol.\n\nObesity.\n\nAutoimmune atrophic gastritis.\n\nSeveral genetic conditions are associated with increased gastric cancer risk, including:\n\nLynch syndrome.\n\nPeutz-Jeghers syndrome.\n\nLi-Fraumeni syndrome.\n\nFamilial adenomatous polyposis.\n\nHereditary diffuse gastric cancer.\n\nCommon variable immunodeficiency (CVID).\n\nStomach cancer is more common in people with Type A blood, although researchers aren’t sure why.\n\nHow is stomach cancer diagnosed?\n\nYour provider will review your medical history, ask about your symptoms and perform a physical exam that may involve feeling for a mass in your stomach. They may order several tests to diagnose and stage stomach cancer.\n\nStaging allows your provider to assess how much the cancer has spread. With stomach cancer, staging ranges from 0 (zero) to IV (four). Stage 0 means the cancer hasn’t spread beyond your stomach lining. Stage IV means that it’s spread to other organs.\n\nUpper endoscopy is commonly used to diagnose stomach cancer. During the procedure, your provider inserts a thin tube with a tiny camera at its tip (endoscope) into your mouth until it reaches your stomach. Small surgical instruments can pass through the endoscope, allowing your provider to remove a tissue sample (biopsy). The sample can be tested in a lab for cancer cells.\n\nEndoscopic ultrasound is a special kind of endoscopy that can help stage the cancer. The endoscope used has an ultrasound probe attached at its tip, that can take pictures of your stomach. It can show if the cancer’s spread from your stomach lining to your stomach wall.\n\nRadiologic tests, including a CT scan, barium swallow and MRI, can help identify tumors and other abnormalities that may be cancer-related. During a barium swallow, you drink a substance that makes your stomach lining more visible on an X-ray. A PET scan can show if cancer has spread throughout your body.\n\nBlood tests can offer information about how your organs are functioning. Poor organ function may indicate that cancer has spread to that organ.\n\nLaparoscopy is a type of surgery that allows your provider to assess cancer spread when less invasive methods, like imaging, haven’t provided enough information. During laparoscopy, your provider inserts a tiny camera into small cuts in your abdomen so they can see your organs directly.\n\nProviders don’t screen for stomach cancer in the U.S. because it’s so rare. Still, if you have a condition that increases your risk, your provider may recommend regular procedures like an upper endoscopy to detect cancerous changes. Ask your provider about their recommendations based on your risk.\n\nIs stomach cancer curable?\n\nStomach cancer can be cured if it’s in the early stages. Often, though, diagnosis happens in later stages once symptoms begin. Ask your provider about the factors that play a role in your treatment outcomes.\n\nWhat is the prognosis (outlook) for people who have stomach cancer?\n\nThe outlook for stomach cancer depends on the stage of cancer. People in the early stages of stomach cancer have a much better prognosis than those at a later stage. The 5-year survival rate for stomach cancer may be as high as 70% (for little spread) or as low as 6% (for advanced spread).\n\nSpeak with your provider for a more accurate assessment of your prognosis. The type of cancer you have, its spread, your health and how your cancer responds to treatment all shape your prognosis.\n\nWhen should I see my healthcare provider?\n\nIf you’re at increased risk of stomach cancer, speak with your provider about the pros and cons of regular screenings. Otherwise, keep tabs on your symptoms. Many of the symptoms associated with stomach cancer may be signs of another condition. Only your provider can make a definitive diagnosis.\n\nSee your provider if you have symptoms like stomach pain and unexplained weight loss with or without symptoms, like:\n\nTrouble eating.\n\nDiarrhea.\n\nNausea.\n\nBloody or black stool.\n\nWhat questions should I ask my doctor?\n\nWhere is the cancer located?\n\nWhat stage of cancer do I have? What does this mean for my prognosis?\n\nWhat treatments are available to me?\n\nWhat are the benefits of this treatment? Potential risks?\n\nWhat other treatment options are available?\n\nHow will my cancer diagnosis and treatment impact my everyday life?\n\nShould I get a second opinion?\n\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nStomach cancer isn’t always preventable, but it may be treatable if caught early. Depending on your cancer diagnosis, your provider may recommend surgery to remove cancer cells or tumors. They may suggest a combination of treatments that can kill or shrink the cancer cells. Ultimately, your prognosis depends on multiple factors you can discuss with your provider. Don’t hesitate to ask about treatment options, including their benefits and risks. Seek your providers’ guidance on what your cancer diagnosis means for you."
