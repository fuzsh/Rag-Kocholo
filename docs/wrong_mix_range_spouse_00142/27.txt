Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee's marriage was one of the most high-profile

celebrity unions of the 1990s. The couple, who married in 1995 after a

whirlwind four-day courtship, were together for three years before their

divorce in 1998. But why did Pamela and Tommy get divorced?

The couple's split was primarily attributed to a domestic violence incident in

February 1998. Lee was arrested for spousal abuse after leaving Anderson with

bruises, a torn fingernail, and fear for the safety of her two sons. Lee

pleaded no contest to the spousal abuse charges against him and was sentenced

to six months in the Los Angeles County jail. Anderson filed for divorce

shortly after the incident and requested custody of their sons.

Despite the domestic violence incident, the couple attempted reconciliation

after Lee was released from jail. Anderson spoke about their reunion on a May

1999 appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, saying: "Tommy and I are

back together, working our family out. We're doing really well, and our

children are happy." However, the accord did not last forever, and the couple

split for the second time in 2001.

In 2008, Anderson and Lee tried for the third time at romantic bliss, but it

wasn't their last attempt at getting back together. The former spouses split

for good in 2010.

Though the sex-tape scandal undoubtedly stressed the stars' marriage, it

was not actually the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back. It was a

case of domestic violence that rang the death knell for Pam and Tommy.

Unfortunately, it was a case of domestic violence that ultimately led to the

end of their marriage.

Today, both Anderson and Lee have moved on with their lives. Anderson is now

single after splitting from husband Dan Hayhurst in 2021, while Lee is married

to former Vine star Brittany Furlan. Though their marriage ended in divorce,

the couple still share two sons, Brandon Thomas Lee and Dylan Jagger Lee.
