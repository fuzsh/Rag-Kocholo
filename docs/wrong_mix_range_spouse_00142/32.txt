Pamela Anderson and Rick Salomon have married for a second time, the former Baywatch star has confirmed.

The pair previously tied the knot in Las Vegas in 2007, but separated just ten weeks later. The marriage was later annulled.

When questioned about her reignited relationship with her ex-husband, Anderson told E! Online that the couple had remarried.

"Yes," she confirmed. "We're very happy. Our families are very happy and that's all that matters."

Anderson first revealed she had reconciled with her former spouse during an appearance on The Ellen Show in October.

She described Salomon as her "best friend...with benefits" and told host Ellen DeGeneres that she didn't "want to meet anyone else".

"You keep going back to the same guys," DeGeneres said. "You're married, then you go back."

Anderson joked in response: "It's recycling! No, I'm very happy. We're happy. He's a great guy."
