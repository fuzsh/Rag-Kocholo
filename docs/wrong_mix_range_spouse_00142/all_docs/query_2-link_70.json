Starting in 2014, all theses, projects, and dissertations were produced in digital versions only. View theses 2014-present here.\n\nInitial funding for the project to digitize older theses was provided by a grant from CSUSB's Vital and Expanded Technologies Initiative, which allocates designated funds from the Student Success Initiative fee. The library thanks the VETI committee for supporting this project to showcase the intellectual endeavors of CSUSB graduates.\n\nOpting Out\n\nIf you are the author of a CSUSB thesis and do not want the full text of your work posted in ScholarWorks, please notify us via the Digitization Project Request Form. All such requests will be honored, but must come from the author of the work.\n\nBecause post-2014 theses/projects in Creative Writing were not posted in ScholarWorks, the digitization project will not post older Creative Writing theses without the authorâ€™s express permission. Metadata-only records are provided for these items."
