        "text": "Brittany Furlan and Heather Locklear are proof that you can be friends with your current partner's ex.\n\n\"Heather and I are very close,\" Furlan told People in an interview published Sunday. \"She's awesome, I love her.\"\n\nFurlan, who's currently married to Tommy Lee, called the Mötley Crüe rocker's ex-wife \"the most kind, down-to-earth person.\" She added, \"We met through Tommy, obviously, and became close. She's just very cool, very nice, just supportive and just a cool chick all around.\"\n\nThe social media personality, 36, and Lee, 60, married in 2019 after two years of dating. Their relationship came nearly three decades after Lee and Locklear, 61, called it quits in 1993 after being married for seven years.\n\nFurlan went on to tell People that she's \"so grateful\" to have an amicable relationship with Locklear.\n\n\"She tells me funny stories,\" Furlan added. \"Everyone glorifies his relationship with Pam, but he was married to Heather for (nearly) eight years!\" She added that Lee calls Locklear \"the one that got away.\"\n\n\"She was the love of his life. I see it, because she's just a fun, sweet, caring, awesome person,\" Furlan told the outlet. \"Tommy even says he messed up in that relationship. He cheated on her. To this day, that's why they're still really good friends.\"\n\nThe tape, Tommy Lee, kids: All the bombshells from Pamela Anderson’s Netflix doc, memoir\n\nFurlan and Lee tied the knot on Valentine's Day in 2019. The newlyweds both took to Instagram at the time to share a picture of their pet dogs, Neena Da Weena and Wicket, dressed as bride and groom to announce their nuptials.\n\n\"Holy (expletive)!!!! We did it!!!! Mr & Mrs Lee,\" Lee captioned the image, while Furlan wrote: \"It’s official!!!! We’re married!!! MR & MRS LEE YAHOOOOOOOO.\"\n\nThe pair started dating in 2017, but Lee said he's known of the social media star for much longer: \"I've been following her for years on Vine and I was like, 'She is so (expletive) funny and stupid and cute and beautiful.'\"\n\nFurlan is Lee's fourth wife. He previously wed model Elaine Starchuk, actress Heather Locklear and actress Pamela Anderson, with whom he shares two sons – Brandon, 27, and Dylan, 25.\n\nMore: Tommy Lee celebrates Valentine's Day by marrying social media star Brittany Furlan\n\nMore: Tommy Lee says he was 'on a bender' when he posted nude photo to Instagram\n\nContributing: Cydney Henderson"
