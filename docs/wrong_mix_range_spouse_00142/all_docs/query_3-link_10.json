        "text": "Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee's marriage was one of the most high-profile\n\ncelebrity unions of the 1990s. The couple, who married in 1995 after a\n\nwhirlwind four-day courtship, were together for three years before their\n\ndivorce in 1998. But why did Pamela and Tommy get divorced?\n\nThe couple's split was primarily attributed to a domestic violence incident in\n\nFebruary 1998. Lee was arrested for spousal abuse after leaving Anderson with\n\nbruises, a torn fingernail, and fear for the safety of her two sons. Lee\n\npleaded no contest to the spousal abuse charges against him and was sentenced\n\nto six months in the Los Angeles County jail. Anderson filed for divorce\n\nshortly after the incident and requested custody of their sons.\n\nDespite the domestic violence incident, the couple attempted reconciliation\n\nafter Lee was released from jail. Anderson spoke about their reunion on a May\n\n1999 appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, saying: \"Tommy and I are\n\nback together, working our family out. We're doing really well, and our\n\nchildren are happy.\" However, the accord did not last forever, and the couple\n\nsplit for the second time in 2001.\n\nIn 2008, Anderson and Lee tried for the third time at romantic bliss, but it\n\nwasn't their last attempt at getting back together. The former spouses split\n\nfor good in 2010.\n\nThough the sex-tape scandal undoubtedly stressed the stars' marriage, it\n\nwas not actually the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back. It was a\n\ncase of domestic violence that rang the death knell for Pam and Tommy.\n\nUnfortunately, it was a case of domestic violence that ultimately led to the\n\nend of their marriage.\n\nToday, both Anderson and Lee have moved on with their lives. Anderson is now\n\nsingle after splitting from husband Dan Hayhurst in 2021, while Lee is married\n\nto former Vine star Brittany Furlan. Though their marriage ended in divorce,\n\nthe couple still share two sons, Brandon Thomas Lee and Dylan Jagger Lee."
