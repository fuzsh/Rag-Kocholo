        "text": "[This is PART ONE of the bibliography “Women and Science: Issues and Resources” that is number 34 in the series “WISCONSIN BIBLIOGRAPHIES IN WOMEN’S STUDIES,” published by the University of Wisconsin System Women’s Studies Librarian, 430 Memorial Library, 728 State Street, Madison, WI 53706; email: the Women’s Studies Librarian. It includes “A Selective Reading List” for authors whose last names begin with A-J. The bibliography was originally compiled and updated by Susan E. Searing. Since 1992 it has been updated periodically by Phyllis Holman Weisbard. This version is dated June 1997.]\n\nWOMEN AND SCIENCE: ISSUES AND RESOURCES Part I: A Selective Reading List\n\nThis bibliography emphasizes books and special journal issues that present a feminist critique of scientific theory and practice in the past and present. Wherever possible, the contents of special issues and anthologies are listed. The bibliography also cites many journal articles, several representative biographies, reports of model courses or curricula, and works about the lives and status of women scientists. Occupational guidance materials and curricula for the K-12 classroom are generally not cited.
