        "text": "TOMMY Lee shot to stardom as the drummer of 80s rock band Motley Crue, but over the years has become more known for his antics.\n\nFamed for his relationship with Pamela Anderson, the controversial star has certainly led a rock and roll lifestyle.\n\nWho is Tommy Lee?\n\nThomas Lee Bass was born on October 3, 1962, and is best known as Tommy Lee - a Greek-American musician.\n\nHe is a founding member of the heavy metal band Motley Crue, which was formed in 1981.\n\nAs well as being the band's long-term drummer, Tommy also founded rap-metal band Methods Of Mayhem and has pursued solo musical projects.\n\nTommy has also dabbled in TV, and in 2004 starred in a reality show Tommy Lee Goes To College.\n\nIn spring 2008, he filmed another reality TV show with rapper Ludacris for Planet Green called Battleground Earth.\n\nTommy has amassed an estimated worth of $70million (Â£58million), mainly through being in Motley Crue and touring.\n\nWhere is Tommy Lee now?\n\nWhen Tommy and Pamela Anderson separated for the final time in 2010, they decided to co-parent their children.\n\nIn 2020, Tommy pursued an alcohol-free lifestyle after drinking what he says is \"gallons of vodka\" every day.\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Tommy said it feels \"killer\" to have separated himself from drinking.\n\nHe said: \"I consider myself lucky because some people don't have that sense, or luxury, of sort of looking in the mirror and going, 'OK dude, time to pump the breaks. Like, this is too much'.\"\n\nTommy continues to be a musician, and his third solo studio album, Andro, was released in 2020.\n\nIn February 2022 the drummer and his ex wife Pamela's relationship was the subject of a Disney series called Pam & Tommy.\n\nIn August 2022, Tommy came under fire for posting a picture of himself completely nude on Instagram.\n\nIn January 2023 his life was back in focus in Netflix documentary Pamela.\n\nWhen were Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee together?\n\nTommy married former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson after knowing her for just 96 hours in 1995.\n\nThe pair, who married on a beach with Pamela in a bikini, divorced three years later in 1998.\n\nDespite the split, the couple has been very on and off over the years, and reunited after he was released from prison, and then again in 2008.\n\nThe couple have two sons together - Brandon Thomas Lee (born 1996) and Dylan Jagger Lee (born 1997).\n\nIn 2018, Tommy slammed Pamela for bringing up their relationship during her interview with Piers Morgan, when Pam talked about him assaulting her.\n\nThe couple was also famously the victim of a stolen sex tape in 1995.\n\nWho else has Tommy Lee been married to?\n\nTommy has been married four times.\n\nBefore Pamela, he was married to Elaine Starchuk in the early 80s, but they later divorced.\n\nOn May 10, 1986, he married actress Heather Locklear, but the couple divorced in 1993.\n\nOn February 14, 2018, Tommy announced he was engaged to actress Brittany Furlan and the pair tied the knot a year later on February 14, 2019."
