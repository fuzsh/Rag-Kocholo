        "text": "Pamela and 77-year-old film producer Jon first dated in the 1980s.\n\nBut 30 years later, the pair said they married in 2020, with John confessing he’s only ever wanted Pamela.\n\nSadly it wasn’t to be and the pair called off their union 12 days later before any paperwork was filed, so they were never officially married.\n\nThe mogul and Pamela remain friends, and he recently revealed he’s leaving her $10million (£8.1m) in his will ‘whether she wants it or not’.\n\nPamela’s most famous relationship was with first husband and Motley Crue rocker Tommy Lee, who she married in 1995.\n\nThe model was 27 in December 1994 when she met Tommy, and just four days into their relationship the pair married while on vacation in Cancún.\n\nIn 1995, electrician Rand Gauthier stole and leaked a sex tape the pair made on their honeymoon and it was viewed by thousands.\n\nThe pair had two kids, Brandon and Dylan, before divorcing in 1998 after Tommy was arrested for ‘spousal abuse’.\n\n‘The divorce from Tommy was the hardest, lowest, most difficult point of my life,’ wrote Pamela in her memoir.\n\nPamela’s Baywatch co-star Kelly Slater was a big part of her dating history, even though the pair never married.\n\nIn her documentary, Pamela described him as her ‘big love’.\n\n‘I dated Kelly all the time. I mean, Kelly and I were together between lots of boyfriends and lots of girlfriends for him too, but it wasn’t just me,’ she said.\n\nThe star also revealed she was ‘dating’ Kelly when she got married to Tommy Lee in their four-day whirlwind romance.\n\n‘I was dating Kelly Slater at the time and I was supposed to go see him in Florida and meet his family,’ she recollected.\n\n‘My first phone call was him to tell him I was married. He’s like, “What?!” That was horrible.’\n\nAmerican singer Kid Rock, now 52, was Pamela’s second husband.\n\nThe All Summer Long hitmaker was famously in an on-off relationship with the former Playboy cover star from 2001 until 2006, when whey married for four months before breaking up for good.\n\nBut 2006 was not the pair’s first go at marriage, as they first got engaged in 2002 before breaking up by 2003.\n\nIt wasn’t meant to be.\n\nPamela and real estate tycoon Laurence Hallier dated on and off for a number of years in the early 2000s.\n\nBut it did not end amicably, as the pair fought a nasty legal battle, in which she sued him for not coughing up a condo he’d promised her.\n\nHe responded by suing Pamela for a reported $22.5million (£14m) for failing to deliver her side of the deal by promoting his property.\n\nThey eventually settled out of court for an unknown amount.\n\nParis Hilton’s ex Rick Salomon became her third husband when the pair wed in 2007.\n\nBut the marriage wasn’t to be and it was annulled only two months later after Pamela filed for divorce.\n\nThat wasn’t the end of the story for Pamela and her long-term pal and poker player though, as the pair wed again in 2016 before it ended again, this time six months later.\n\nSurfer and electrician Jamie Padgett dated Pamela in 2009 for around a year, in which they travelled the world together and he taught her kids how to surf.\n\nA source told RadarOnline at the time: ‘Pam made it pretty clear she is no longer dating Jamie and that she was looking for a new love interest.\n\n‘She didn’t have anything bad to say about him and described him as a ‘sweet guy’ and that she hoped they would remain friends.’\n\nIt also appears Pamela’s ex Tommy could have played a part in a split, as he was reportedly jealous of Jamie’s relationship with his sons.\n\nPamela and footballer Adil Rami’s two-year relationship didn’t end well when the Baywatch star accused him of cheating and ‘living a double life’ in a scathing Instagram post.\n\nPamela even referenced the National Domestic Violence Hotline, when she wrote: ‘How could I have helped so many people @ndvhofficial and not be wise enough or able to help myself.’\n\nShe continued: ‘Narcissists don’t change. Sociopaths don’t change. I will run for my life – I have always fought for truth and justice. – this is my worst nightmare – I was not a very jealous person before I met him. I’m happy to know the truth. But it hurts like hell.’\n\nOn Christmas Eve 2020, Pamela shocked the world when she married hey bodyguard Dan Hayhurst in a secret ceremony.\n\n‘I am in love. We were married Christmas Eve with both our families’ blessing, everyone we know is happy for us,’ said Pamela at the time.\n\nAn insider also told Rolling Stone that, ‘Pamela loves as authentically as she lives,’ describing their brief time together as a ‘pandemic whirlwind’ romance."
