        "text": "How many times has Pamela Anderson been married and who were her husbands? Her dating history and marriage timeline revealed...\n\nPamela Anderson has reclaimed her story with the Netflix documentary Pamela, a love story, which dropped on January 31.\n\nThe Baywatch star first recaptured the mainstream media’s attention following the Hulu show, Pam & Tommy, which made waves last year by retelling the story of her marriage to Tommy Lee.\n\nWhere Is Pamela Anderson Now? Inside The Icon's Life After Dropping 'Pamela, A Love Story'\n\nThe Kids Of Pamela Anderson & Tommy Lee: Where Are They Now?\n\nFollowing the whirlwind series, Pamela has won over hearts with her candid and honest documentary which details her career and relationships over the years.\n\nOne thing about the doc that did surprise viewers was how many times the 90s icon had tied the knot! So here's a timeline of the six times Pamela Anderson has been married: from bodyguard-turned-husband Dan Hayhurst to the Mötley Crüe drummer...\n\nPamela's first marriage is likely her most famous, and it just so happens to be the subject matter of the infamous Pam & Tommy series.\n\nThe actress and Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee wed after just a few days of knowing each other back in 1995 and were married for three years. They went on to have two kids together, Brandon Thomas Lee and Dylan Jagger Lee, who are now adults.\n\nIn 2002 she began dating musician Kid Rock, and after an on-and-off engagement, they finally tied the knot in 2006 on a yacht in Saint-Tropez, Pamela filed for divorce at the end of the same year.\n\nThe divorce was finalised in 2007 and later that year she walked down the aisle with famous poker player Rick Salomon, they were married at the famous Las Vegas Mirage Hotel with a small ceremony.\n\nPam and Rick annulled their nuptials the following year, during which time she revealed that she and Tommy Lee were still in contact and planning to reconcile their relationship. However, that was not the case as she re-wed Rick in 2014, before parting ways for a final time in 2015.\n\nIt wasn't another five years until the Baywatch actress married again, this time to film producer Jon Peters, who was 22 years her senior. The pair briefly dated back in 1989 after meeting at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles but their 2020 union was quickly annulled after 12 days and the marriage license was never filed.\n\nIn the same year, Pamela and her bodyguard Dan Hayhurst became husband and wife in a ceremony that took place at the star's Canadian home on Christmas Eve. She announced their split in January 2022, stating that he \"was not the man she'd hoped\".\n\nPamela Anderson speaks about her many marriages\n\nThe actress and model recently explained why she “keeps getting married\", she told The Times: \"I just wanted to recreate a family for my kids.\n\n“But I also would not allow anyone to abuse me and didn’t want my kids to think it was OK. And so that was always my red line, when I felt like they were witnessing me being treated badly – because they cannot learn to treat women badly,\" she continued.\n\nPamela candidly said: \"And [as] much as I look like a clown, getting divorced all the time, I can’t let that happen.”"
