        "text": "When was Tommy Lee married to Heather Locklear and when was his wedding to Pamela Anderson?\n\nThe wild life and career of Mötley Crüe drummer, Tommy Lee, is depicted in new Netflix movie, The Dirt.\n\nNetflix's new biopic, The Dirt, explores the colourful lives and career of rock band, Mötley Crüe.\n\nHere, we take a look at drummer Tommy Lee in more detail.\n\nWATCH: Machine Gun Kelly transforms into Tommy Lee for The Dirt\n\nWho is Tommy Lee?\n\nMötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee was born on 3rd October, 1962 - making him 56 years old at the time of writing this article.\n\nWhile Lee was born in Athens, Greece, he was raised in California.\n\nReceiving his first drum kit as a teenager, it was clear that Tommy was a gifted musician and would go on to forge a career in the industry.\n\nHis younger sister, Athena, also plays the drums and was married to Scorpions' James Kottak.\n\nWhen did Tommy Lee join Mötley Crüe?\n\nBefore joining Mötley Crüe, Tommy Lee was the drummer for Suite 19.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, Lee played his first gig on LA's Sunset Strip.\n\nIt was at this time that he met future band mate, Nikki Sixx.\n\nGuitarist Mick Mars then formed Mötley Crüe in 1981, with Tommy Lee recommending his old school friend, Vince Neil, for vocals.\n\nWhen was Tommy married to Heather Locklear?\n\nTommy Lee married actress Heather Locklear on 10th May, 1986.\n\nHeather, then 24 years old, was Tommy's second wife; he was first married to Elaine Starchuk.\n\nThe pair celebrated with around 500 guests and the ceremony was held at the Santa Barbara Biltmore.\n\nTommy wore a white leather tuxedo, while Heather donned a fishtail gown.\n\nAs documented in The Dirt, Tommy's best man and bandmate Nikki Sixx was going through a period of heavy drug use and barely made the ceremony.\n\nOn what would have been Tommy and Heather's 30th anniversary, Locklear took to Instagram to share a picture of the two of them, showing fans there's no hard feelings.\n\nHow many wives has the Mötley Crüe drummer had?\n\nIn total, the drummer has had four wives.\n\nHis first marriage was to Elaine Starchuk, before he married Heather Locklear in 1986. Tommy and Heather then divorced in 1993.\n\nLee then got engaged to model, Bobbie Brown. The Mötley Crüe star never ended up marrying Brown, though.\n\nInstead, just four days after meeting her, Lee got married to Playboy Playmate and Baywatch actress, Pamela Anderson in 1995.\n\nThe pair have two sons; Brandon (born on 5th June, 1996) and Dylan (born on 29th December, 1997).\n\nDuring a trip the couple took, Lee and Anderson filmed a sex tape. In 1995, the film was stolen and leaked on the internet. Anderson then sued distribution company, Internet Entertainment.\n\nAfter three years of marriage, Pammy and Tommy split, making their divorce official in 1998.\n\nIn 1998, Tommy Lee served six months in country jail for kicking Pamela Anderson while she was holding their son Dylan.\n\nThe pair reunited for a brief period of time when Lee was released from prison, but split again in 2001.\n\nSeven years later, the pair got back together again, before splitting for the final time that same year.\n\nIn 2014, Tommy proposed to girlfriend and singer, Sofia Toufa. Despite their three-year engagement, the pair never tied the knot.\n\nIt wasn't until February 2018 that Tommy Lee announced he had proposed to Brittany Furlan. The pair got hitched on Valentine's Day, 2019.\n\nWhen is The Dirt on Netflix?\n\nThe Dirt is now available to stream on Netflix.\n\nThe biopic is based on the memoirs of the band during the 1980s and cover the tumultuous years of heavy drug use, sex and rock 'n' roll.\n\nWatch the trailer for The Dirt here:\n\nHow old was Vince Neil's daughter Skylar when she died and what type of cancer did she have?\n\nHow old is Nikki Sixx, how many children does the Mötley Crüe bassist have and is he married?"
