        "text": "Lee's second marriage and whirlwind romance with Locklear was a dream for magazine publishers worldwide. The couple married in 1986 after a few months of dating; both were still in their early 20s. Locklear was a squeaky-clean TV ingenue at the time, while Lee's career with Mötley Crüe was taking off.\n\nAfter nearly eight years of marriage, the couple split in 1993; by 1994, their divorce was finalized. Both moved on to other relationships, but they don't seem to have any hard feelings. Back in 2016, on what would have been their 30th wedding anniversary, Locklear jokingly told Lee \"Happy 30 years baby\" in an Instagram post.\n\nActor Anderson, best known for her role on \"Baywatch,\" has had a complicated relationship with Lee. They married in 1995 after only knowing each other for four days, and they had two sons together, Brandon (born in 1996) and Dylan (born in 1997). In 1998, however, the couple divorced.\n\nOver the course of the next decade, Anderson and Lee had an on-and-off relationship. In 2008, \"People\" reported that they had reunited and were living together with their sons, but they ended their relationship for good in 2010.\n\nIn her memoir, Anderson reveals that as tumultuous as her relationship with Lee was, it may have been the only time she was ever truly in love. \"My relationship with Tommy may have been the only time I was ever truly in love,\" she writes, per People. \"We had fun, and our rule was no rules.\"\n\nBefore meeting Lee, Furlan was a popular internet star — the most-followed female video star on Vine until November 2015 and one of \"Time\"'s 2015 most influential internet stars. When Vine ended, she turned to YouTube and even appeared in Netflix's 2018 documentary \"The American Meme.\"\n\nShe and Lee began their relationship in 2017 and became engaged in 2018. Their wedding took place in February 2019, and they've been married ever since."
