The research involves the analysis of 1000 antemortem pig samples to characterize the distribution of DASS in sows and their litters. To achieve this, bacterial culture and isolation techniques were utilized, followed by DNA extraction. PCR testing is conducted using two distinct assays—one targeting the broader S. suis species and the other specifically focusing on disease-associated S. suis. This dual approach aims to help us examine the intricate movement patterns of DASS within pig populations. Through meticulous data compilation and analysis, we intend to gain valuable insights into the transmission and prevalence of DASS. Understanding infection patterns is crucial for informing the development of innovative control programs to mitigate the impact of this significant pathogen in swine populations.\n\n2\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nAshaAlla (Biomedical Engineering, Spring 2024)\n\nMentor: Tina Tootle (Biology)\n\nIdentifying Regulators of Nuclear Actin Via Deficiency Screening\n\nNuclear actin, a once under-looked structural component of the cell, has now been established as a having a key role in regulation of gene expression. The purpose of my project is to try and identify novel proteins that interact with nuclear actin. Using Drosophila melanogaster, I conducted a genetic screen to observe the interactions between Importin 9, a known nuclear actin importer, and deletions in varying genes throughout the genome and how these interactions affected fertility. The screen was split into three phases: observing egg counts, counting progeny, and observation of stained ovaries using microscopy. Since entering the third phase, I have discovered that a co-deficiency in Importin 9 and a sizable portion of chromosome 2L is associated with cell death in oogenesis. Future direction would entail narrowing down which gene may be associated with this phenomenon and its mechanism of action.\n\n3\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nVedaAmalkar (Biomedical Sciences, Spring 2025)\n\nMentor: Ajit Vikram (Internal Medicine), Ravinder Reddy Gaddam (Internal Medicine)\n\nRole of miR-204 in segmental cardiac effects of phenylephrine and pressure overload\n\nThe accidental overdose of drugs or endogenous release of chemicals that cause cardiac stress leads to transient regional dysfunction in the heart. The stressed hearts have a compensatory increase in the expression of a protective small non-coding RNA known as miR-204. Our goal in this study was to determine the impact of miR-204 on the regional differences in cardiac muscle movement during cardiac stress induced by either phenylephrine (PE) treatment or transaortic constriction (TAC) to cause pressure overload. We used wild-type and miR-204 deficient mice. Using speckle-tracking echocardiography, we assessed cardiac muscle motion in the different segments of the left ventricle (posterior and anterior-apical, mid, and basal segments). PE treatment increased longitudinal and radial motion in the apex of the left ventricle and shortened the peak motion time of all left ventricle segments. TAC led to decreased longitudinal and radial motion in all the left ventricle segments, with no difference in the peak motion time. PE-induced peak cardiac muscle motion time in the anterior base of the left ventricle was significantly earlier in miR-204 deficient mice than in wild-type. Our findings highlight the role of miR-204 in regulating cardiac muscle motion and demonstrate that PE and TAC induce regional wall motion abnormalities.\n\n4\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nColinBehr (Business Analytics and Information Systems and Marketing Analytics, Spring 2024)\n\nMentor: Kristina Bigsby (Business Analytics & Information Systems)\n\nCreating a Play Recommendation System for the Chicago Bears\n\nUtilizing various on and off field conditions such as location on the field, the surface and roof type of the stadium, remaining game time, current offensive ranking, opponent defensive ranking, current weather conditions, current quarterback/key players, and player fatigue we estimate plays that should be ran given the combination of features of the current situation. By utilizing various conditions, we can create a unique SituationID to run through an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm that returns the play(s) that is/are estimated to be the best to run given all conditions surrounding the current situation.\n\n5\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nReyBernhard (Neuroscience, Spring 2025)\n\nMentor: Leyre Castro (Psychological and Brain Sciences)\n\nTask Switching in Pigeons\n\nWhen humans switch between tasks, they tend to be slower and less accurate, because they have to reconfigure their mind setting. Pigeons rely on associative learning mechanisms so they may not show this cost of switching tasks. Here, we examined task switching in pigeons. Pigeons were presented with two different tasks. One task required the pigeons to discriminate between “light” and “dark” values of grey; the other task required them to discriminate between magnitudes, “few” or “many” circles in a display. This design allowed us to examine the effects of repetition and alternation of task, stimulus, and response. We found that task repetition per se did not have an effect on pigeon performance, but stimulus and response repetition did. Thus, we did not find interference because of higher-order ability to conceptualize the task—as is the case in humans—but we did find associative interference from previously presented stimuli and responses. Future research will allow for a deeper understanding of the task-switching advantages provided by associative learning and help fuel further human productivity and efficiency.\n\n8\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nGraceClemens (Public Health and a certificate in Entrepreneurial Management, Spring 2025)\n\nMentor: Ebonee Johnson (College of Public Health in Community Behavioral Health)\n\nMultigenerational Family Health Aging\n\nThis semester I have focused on research. I have had the opportunity to work with an amazing team that has helped me step by step throughout the process thus far. The project we have been working on is looking at multigenerational families in the United States and their health and wellbeing. I began transcribing an interview and slowly working my way further into the process. I have been working on covidence, a plantform used to sort through articles about multigenerational families and deciding if they fit in with our study. I have also looked into places to find other potential people to interview. Although this is ongoing I have done a lot so far and hope to do more. I hope to sit in an interview and potentially see how everything happens with my own eyes. All in all this has helped me realize that research is potentially a career path for me.\n\n9\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nElainaDawley (Speech and Hearing Science, Spring 2024)\n\nMentor: Stewart McCauley (Communication Sciences and Disorders)\n\nTitle: Nonword Repetition Performance Under Conditions of Task Interference: The Role of Sequence Length and Phonotactic Probability\n\nNonword repetition tasks (NWR) have been used for several decades to investigate aspects of both disordered and typical language development. More recently these tasks have been used with adults, including work on the maintenance of speech production abilities in typical aging. However, NWR has often been carried out under laboratory conditions that do not reflect real-world scenarios, in which multiple distracting stimuli or task demands are present. Here, we examine NWR in young adults, with and without simultaneous visuomotor task demands. We predicted that NWR would be more robust to task interference as a function of overall sequence length. Moreover, we predicted that higher phonotactic probabilities would interact with sequence length, such that subjects would be more robust to task interference effects for longer sequences that had higher probabilities. Stimuli included nonwords varying in length and phonotactic probability. The experiment was counterbalanced such that half of the participants carried out a simultaneous visuomotor task during the first half of the experiment only, while the other half of participants experienced an interference-free, standard nonword repetition task during the first half. We discuss the results and their theoretical as well as potential clinical implications.\n\n10\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nDominicaEckstrom (Human Physiology, Spring 2025)\n\nMentor: Matthew Potthoff (Neuroscience and Pharmacology )\n\nExploring FGF21'S Acute Insulin Potentiation\n\nInsulin resistance affects over 100 million Americans. Individuals diagnosed with diabetes are at a greater risk for developing coronary artery disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. FGF21 is an endogenously produced hormone secreted by the liver under conditions of high carbohydrate intake, low protein diets, and fasting. Pharmacological FGF21 administration increases insulin sensitivity and can also decrease body weight. FGF21 increases insulin stimulated glucose uptake in brown adipocytes when co-administered with insulin. Phosphoproteomics data from FGF21 treated adipocytes identified phosphorylation of proteins involved in GLUT4 trafficking. We are investigating the interplay between FGF21 and insulin signaling to elucidate its therapeutic mechanism of action in BAT.\n\n11\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nMeganFear (Speech And Hearing Sciences, Spring 2024)\n\nMentor: Elizabeth Walker (Communication Sciences and Disorders)\n\nFeasibility of Ecological Momentary Assessments for Adolescents with Hearing Loss\n\nWe examined the feasibility of ecological momentary assessments in adolescents with hearing loss and adolescents with typical hearing through utilization of scheduled smartphone surveys tailored with short-answer questions about the participant’s hearing environment, listening activity, and fatigue. The current feasibility study addresses the following questions: (1) What is the compliance rate for EMA with adolescents? (2) Do feasibility responses in the exit interviews differ based on session? (3) Do feasibility responses in the exit interviews differ based on hearing status? Ten adolescents with typical hearing and 10 adolescents who were hard of hearing completed this study. Participants’ ages, on average, were 16.8 years for typically hearing individuals and 15.6 years for hard of hearing individuals. Participants were instructed to complete a total of 8 surveys per day over a one-week sampling period in both the summer and during the school year. Nine out of 10 of the typically hearing adolescents and 7 out of 10 of the hard of hearing adolescents completed the surveys during both school year and summer sessions.\n\n12\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nDarbyForsyth (Biology, Spring 2025)\n\nMentor: Hans-Joachim Lehmler (Occupational Environmental Health), Josep Comeron (Biology )\n\nExtreme Heat Alters Lung Gene Expression Related to Inflammatory Response\n\nAs global temperatures rise due to climate change, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the health impacts of extreme heat becomes crucial. Employing RNA sequencing, we examined changes in gene expression and associated pathway responses to an acute extreme heat exposure, hypothesizing that heat causes inflammatory genetic alterations. To test this hypothesis, mice were randomly assigned to heat-exposed, control, and pair-fed groups. Heat-exposed mice were housed singly and placed in an incubator, and the temperature was increased over 8 hours (20℃-38℃) and held at 38℃ for 5 minutes. Control and pair-fed mice were left at ~23.2°C. Controls and heat-exposed were given food and water ad libitum while pair-fed were given food and water based on the previous day’s heat-exposed consumption. Mice were euthanized, lung tissue was collected for RNA isolation. Males and female mice showed no variation in overall gene expression throughout treatment groups, with potential female outliers. However, further analysis depicted significant differentially expressed genes in heat-exposed vs. control and heat-exposed vs. pair-fed. Many KEGG enrichment pathways were altered based on changes in gene expression after heat exposure including inflammatory pathways in both male and female mice. These findings suggest that inflammatory genetic alterations are increased after acute heat exposure.\n\n13\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nZachGrissom (Microbiology, Spring 2024)\n\nMentor: Jessica Tucker (Microbiology and Immunology)\n\nThe Role of Non-Coding RNA Polymerase III Transcripts in Restricting Viral Replication\n\nMurine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) is a model virus that allows us to study processes shared with human gammaherpesviruses, like Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, that cause cancer in the immunocompromised. One characteristic of gammaherpesvirus infection is the ability of these viruses to elicit the production of non-coding RNA transcripts made by the cellular RNA polymerase III (Pol3) in host cells. Brf1 is part of a transcription factor complex necessary, along with Pol3, for transcription of transfer RNAs, 5S rRNA, vault RNAs, among others. We have previously shown that reducing the amount of Brf1 in host cells results in a proviral state where MHV68 replicates more efficiently, suggesting that Pol3 transcripts may block viral replication. To explore how these abundant non-coding RNAs made by Pol3 contribute to the antiviral response, we aim to use a plasmid to overexpress a Pol3 transcript panel in MHV68-infected cells. After validating overexpression of Pol3 transcripts in murine fibroblasts by real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), we aim to determine if specific Pol3 transcripts from our panel block infectious MHV68 virus production. This work will delineate the role that select non-coding Pol3 transcripts have in the innate cellular antiviral response and will contribute to novel antiviral therapeutic strategies.\n\n14\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nMollyGuerra (Psychology, Spring 2024)\n\nMentor: Isaac Petersen (Psychological and Brain Sciences)\n\nThe Association Between Parenting Stress and Children's Internalizing Problems: Investigating Negative Emotionality as a Moderator\n\nInternalizing problems in childhood are relatively stable and can develop into pervasive disorders in adolescence, such as anxiety and depression. Research has shown that parenting stress is associated with internalizing problems in children. Prior studies have also established that a child’s ability to regulate their emotions can serve as a protective factor against internalizing psychopathology. However, previous studies have not examined the interaction between parenting stress (e.g., daily hassles) and negative emotionality on internalizing problems in childhood. Thus, the present study investigated the association between parenting daily hassles and children’s internalizing problems with negative emotionality as a moderator. The sample consisted of parents and children aged 3–7 (N=195) recruited from the community. Caregivers completed questionnaires regarding their child’s negative affect and internalizing problems as well as parenting daily hassles. Children’s negative emotionality was assessed using a behavioral task. Results indicated a significant interaction between parenting daily hassles and negative emotionality on children’s internalizing problems. Specifically, for children with caregivers with high levels of parenting stress, higher levels of negative emotionality exacerbated risk for internalizing problems. Findings suggest that targeted interventions for caregivers and children with high stress and negative emotionality may help decrease the risk of internalizing problems.\n\n15\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nJillianHall (Microbiology, Fall 2024)\n\nMentor: Donna Santillan (Institute for Clinical and Translational Science), Jamie Thrams (Institute for Clinical and Translational Science)\n\nClinical and Histological Correlations in C3 Glomerulopathy\n\nC3 Glomerulopathy, or C3G, is an ultrarare kidney disease that results from dysregulation of our immune system’s alternative complement pathway. Patients typically progress to End-Stage Renal Disease within 10 years of diagnosis, requiring dialysis and ultimately kidney transplant. The clinical tests often used to measure kidney function in C3G patients are Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), serum C3, and the Urine Protein/Creatinine ratio (UPC). The current standard of care for C3G includes ACEi and ARB medications to reduce hypertension and immunosuppressive medications like CellCept and Prednisone. Eculizumab is also used to inhibit complement activity, however this medication is seldom available due to its expense. The onset of C3G is very similar to other renal conditions, so a kidney biopsy is required for accurate diagnosis. Biopsies are evaluated by pathologists and scored to measure disease chronicity and acuity. My project, Clinical and Histological Correlations in C3 Glomerulopathy, analyzes the relationship between these histological scores and patient lab results at onset and over time. The goal of this project is to determine whether the characteristics of renal biopsy at the disease onset are suggestive of patient prognosis and to evaluate whether the standard of care for C3G is effective in preventing disease progression.\n\n17\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nNjengaKamau (Genetics & Biotechnology, Fall 2024)\n\nMentor: Hanna Stevens (Psychiatry )\n\nEffects of Overexpression of Placental Igf-1 in Mice on Striatal Development at Three Timepoints\n\nPlacental gene expression of essential growth hormones plays a crucial role in fetal brain development, and changes in expression of placentally produced hormones may contribute to the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Previous research indicates a link between elevated placental levels of Insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf-1), a primarily placentally produced hormone, in mice after prenatal stress, a known risk factor for NDDs. The striatum also has the highest expression of the Igf-1 Receptor in the brain. This brain region is involved in restrictive and repetitive behavior, something people with NDDs struggle with. Additionally, the striatum is enlarged in some with NDDs. These previous findings indicate a role of placental Igf-1 in striatal development. We hypothesized that overexpression of placental Igf-1 would lead to accelerated striatal growth, causing an enlarged striatal as associated with some NDDs. To test this, we induced placental Igf-1 overexpression in mice and examined striatal volume and cell density at embryonic day 14 (E14) and E18, as well as in adult mice. Results showed a specific increase in striatal volume compared to controls at E18 but not E14. Analysis of the adult striatum is ongoing. This finding suggests that placental Igf-1 overexpression can impact striatal development.\n\n18\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nYimingLiu (Biology, Spring 2024)\n\nMentor: Georgina Aldridge (Neurology)\n\nJoshua Weiner (Biology)\n\nSynaptic change and co-pathologic states in neurodegenerative disease\n\nNeurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Lewy body dementia, and Parkinson’s disease, are characterized by cognitive decline and the loss of neurons, neuron structure and their function. Several brain pathological markers are associated with these diseases, including mis-folding and aggregation of the proteins amyloid, tau, alpha-synuclein and TDP-43. Another hallmark of neurodegeneration is synaptic loss, synapses being the sites of cell-cell contacts in the brain transmitting electrical and chemical signals that make up neural function. Consisting of a small head connected to a thin neck, dendritic spines form the most prevalent type of chemical synapse in the brain and make up 5% of brain volume. These neuronal protrusions are structurally plastic and functionally dynamic, growing and retracting in response to signals in the local brain environment. Because of their importance in brain signaling, dendritic spine density and functional status are considered direct measures of synaptic connectivity. This study uses Golgi-Cox stained human brain tissue of deceased neurodegenerative disease patients to visualize dendritic spine pathology and changes in synaptic complexity. We compare these findings to the presence of neurodegenerative disease-associated proteins in the brain to explore the intersections between two pathologic disease markers.\n\n19\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nTinaLiu (Chemistry, Spring 2025)\n\nMentor: Donna Santillan (Obstetrics and Gynecology), Jamie Thrams (Institute for Clinical and Translational Science)\n\nChange in GFR and UPC Before and After Eculizumab in C3 Glomerulopathy\n\nC3 Glomerulopathy (C3G) is an ultra-rare kidney disease characterized by dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway. Most patients reach end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 10 year. To compare the differences in Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) and Urine Protein-Creatinine ratio (UPC) trends in a cohort of C3G patients before and after eculizumab initiation.\n\n20\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nJordanLuna (Neuroscience, Post-Bacc)\n\nMentor: Dorit Kliemann (Psychological and Brain Sciences)\n\nLevels of autistic and social anxiety symptoms do not predict atypical approach/avoidance behavior in response to emotional facial expressions in a typical population\n\nFaces convey important social information through emotional expressions. Whether someone is smiling or frowning may render others more or less likely to either approach or avoid them, respectively. Several psychiatric disorders, including autism and social anxiety, show difficulty interpreting facial emotions. We tested whether levels of psychiatric symptoms in a typical population predicted approach-avoidance bias to emotional facial expressions. Using an online version of the Approach Avoidance Task [1] we measured reaction times when adult participants (n = 48) were instructed to approach or avoid happy and angry facial expressions [2]. Participants were faster to approach positive and avoid negative expressions, and were slower to avoid positive and approach negative expressions, replicating a compatibility bias. We then investigated whether the bias varied with levels of autistic and social anxiety symptoms [3, 4], however, we did not find an effect on participants’ approach-avoidance behavior, even when comparing low and high symptom levels, or when using different bias measures. In sum, levels of autistic and social anxiety symptoms in a typical population did not affect approach-avoidance behavior toward positive and negative emotional facial expressions. Future work may benefit from more naturalistic stimuli and from including individuals with Autism and Social Anxiety diagnoses.

AT is primarily treated conservatively using exercise programs which progressively increase Achilles tendon loading. Footwear that biases loading to the forefoot has been used to increase vertical jump height and may facilitate desirable increases in ankle motion and tendon loading during exercises used to treat AT. The purpose of this research is to determine the effects of forefoot biasing footwear on Achilles tendon load and ankle biomechanics during exercises used to treat AT. Twenty participants completed level ground walking and six AT rehabilitation exercises with athletic shoes alone, and with forefoot biasing footwear, in randomized order. Computerized motion analysis was used to quantify ankle joint biomechanics. Forefoot biasing footwear had limited effect on peak Achilles force and sagittal plane ankle power. Despite most activities maintaining similar ankle range of motion, forefoot biasing footwear shifted the range into a more dorsiflexed position, increasing peak dorsiflexion and decreasing peak plantarflexion for most activities. These data suggest that footwear alterations are unlikely to meaningfully alter peak forces but may positively alter ankle kinematics to promote tendon healing.\n\n22\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nCalvinMcElvain (Analytical Economics, Spring 2024)\n\nMentor: Anne Villamil (Economics), Seongjoo Min (Economics)\n\nWhat do you Expect? Revisiting Expectation Formation Models\n\nProfessional forecasters play a crucial role in shaping economic expectations, yet their forecasts often exhibit systematic biases, as evidenced by prior surveys. This thesis embarks on a reassessment of these biases using contemporary data, replicating prominent explanatory models of inflation and other economic variables. Initial estimates and statistical analyses align with existing literature, underscoring the persistence of these biases. However, determining which models offer a superior fit remains subject to interpretation and further estimation. Beyond replicating established models, this thesis dives into more intricate frameworks that incorporate behavioral factors to enhance understanding of expectation formation. While the findings are still evolving, this study aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse surrounding expectation formation models and their implications for economic forecasting.\n\n23\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nWillMeiners (Physics and Astronomy, Spring 2025)\n\nMentor: John Prineas (Physics and Astronomy)\n\nUltrafast Spectroscopic Characterization of Long-Wave Infrared Photodetector Devices\n\nThe project focuses on the advancement of long-wavelength infrared detectors for myriad applications in such areas as machine vision, security, and environmental monitoring. Long-wave detectors based on mercury cadmium telluride are high performing but require cooling and are challenging/costly to fabricate. We are developing detectors based on more manufacturable III-V semiconductor superlattices that will operate with high performance at higher temperatures. For high performance, it is important that dark current be minimized. To characterize potential noise in our materials, we are measuring carrier lifetime using ultrafast spectroscopy. The technique involves a laser pump pulse to excite carriers and a weak, delayed low photon energy laser probe pulse detects the presence of carriers. We present efforts on the experimental setup, and initial measurement of materials.\n\n24\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nJackMiller (Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Spring 2024)\n\nMentor: Pamela Geyer (Biochemistry and Molecular Biology)\n\nThe role of the nuclear lamina in survival of germline stem cells in the drosophila ovary\n\nDrosophila ovaries contain approximately fifty germline stem cells (GSCs), making them a useful model for understanding stem cell homeostasis. Germline stem cell homeostasis in the drosophila ovary requires the nuclear lamina (NL) protein emerin. Loss of emerin disrupts germline stem cell homeostasis by causing GSC death and blocking germ cell differentiation. The emerin mutants have a distorted NL, GSCs carrying centrosomes with excess pericentriolar material (PCM), and active interphase centrosomes. To test whether centrosome dysfunction causes the emerin mutant phenotype, flies were generated with active interphase centrosomes. To test whether NL distortion causes the emerin mutant phenotype, flies with distorted NL were generated. In both cases, confocal microscopy and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate GSC survival and differentiation, and it was determined that GSC homeostasis was maintained. When flies were generated to have both distorted NL and active interphase centrosomes, loss of GSC homeostasis was seen. Mutants of emerin and genes encoding PCM components were generated to rescue the emerin mutant phenotype, and GSC survival and germ cell differentiation were restored. Based on our findings, we predict that a combination of failures in the centrosome maturation cycle and a distortion of the NL underlie loss of stem cell homeostasis.\n\n25\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nCampbellMitvalsky (Cell and Developmental Biology, Spring 2024)\n\nMentor: Martine Dunnwald (Anatomy and Cell Biology)\n\nThe role of Arhgap29 in cell proliferation during the formation of the palate\n\nArhgap29 is a small RhoA GTPase inhibitor that has been shown to regulate cell proliferation in vitro. Proliferation is crucial for the proper formation and growth of the palatal shelves during embryonic development. Previous work has demonstrated that mutations in the Arhgap29 gene are associated with cleft palate. Therefore, I hypothesize that reduced cell proliferation, because of reduced Arhgap29 levels, may contribute to cleft palate. Embryos lacking Arhgap29 in cells from the palatal shelves were used in these experiments. On embryonic day (E) 14.5, which marked the time when the palatal shelves come together to form the palate, they were sacrificed. Embryonic head sections were stained with specific antibodies to label proliferating cells. Quantification of the total cells and proliferating cells in different regions of the oral cavity was performed and the percentages of proliferating cells were calculated. Preliminary data suggest a reduction of cell proliferation in embryos with reduced Arhgap29. Should my data prove significant, it will unveil the role of Arhgap29 in the growth of palatal shelves required for proper palatogenesis.\n\n26\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nAndersonMorgan (Biology, Spring 2024)\n\nMentor: Maurine Neiman (Biology)\n\nAnalyzing Endopolyploidy in freshwater snails\n\nVariation in the number of nuclear genome copies, or polyploidy, is a topic at the frontier of research in biology. Endopolyploidy, the existence of higher ploidy cells within organisms that are otherwise of a lower ploidy level (reviewed in Neiman et. al. 2017), has been implicated in the expression of genes, tissue regeneration, cancer, and complex anti-predator defense phenotypes. While endopolyploidy is common across all eukaryotes, its prevalence and function remains unclear, especially in animals. We use the invasive New Zealand freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum (“ Potamos”) to provide new insights into animal endopolyploidy. Potamos are especially well suited for this purpose because they have varying organismal ploidy levels, from diploid (2 genome copies) to triploid and tetraploid (3 and 4 genome copies, respectively). Triploid and tetraploid Potamos are asexual, allowing an important control against genetic variation generated by meiosis in sexual reproduction. In the project, we used flow cytometry to create ploidy maps of Potamos of varying ploidy levels to help illuminate the phenomenon of endopolyploidy in an important group of animals.\n\n26\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nPreciousPate (Public Health, Spring 2024)\n\nMentor: Maurine Neiman (Biology)\n\nAnalyzing Endopolyploidy in freshwater snails\n\nVariation in the number of nuclear genome copies, or polyploidy, is a topic at the frontier of research in biology.

In the project, we used flow cytometry to create ploidy maps of Potamos of varying ploidy levels to help illuminate the phenomenon of endopolyploidy in an important group of animals.\n\n27\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nNehaNagarkar (BS Neuroscience, Spring 2024)\n\nMentor: Kai Hwang (Psychological and Brain Sciences)\n\nSubcortical contributions to task-evoked neural oscillations for cognitive flexibility\n\nCognitive flexibility is the ability to flexibly guide behaviours, in accordance with internal goals or contexts. There are specific neurons that fire together to create \"oscillatory patterns\". When performing a task, we see a shift in those distinct oscillatory patterns of neural activity associated with the different cognitive control task periods, called task-evoked neural activity. To understand the underlying neural mechanisms of cognitive control and cognitive flexibility, we need to identify those neural signatures that reflects these processes. One candidate signal is \"delta/theta neural oscillation\", which can be reliably recorded using EEG, paired with cognitive tasks. A part of the brain called the thalamus is thought to coordinate and maintain task-relevant cortical representations that facilitate neural computations during the task. One of our candidate hypothesis is that cortical control representation is maintained by thalamocortical interactions (interactions between the thalamus and cortex of the brain).Therefore, our experiment wants to analyse low-frequency neural oscillation data in order to show its effects on cognitive flexibility using participants that have thalamic lesions and control subjects.\n\n28\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nEllaNail (Biomedical Engineering, Spring 2026)\n\nMentor: Sarah Gerard (Roy J. Carver Biomedical Engineering)\n\nA.I. Model For Predicting Patient Mortality Using CT Scans\n\nPatients with pulmonary fibrosis have a prognosis of two to five years. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential to give patients the best chance of survival through anti-fibrotic therapies. We propose an AI model to predict mortality after 63 weeks using a single CT scan, with a goal of improving clinical outcomes for patients with complex and severe cases of pulmonary fibrosis. We trained a binary classification model using 95 3D scans. The model input is a 3D volume, and the output is a binary label indicating mortality. Overall, our model shows promise for clinical use regarding diagnosis and treatment.\n\n29\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nJuliaRoemen (Speech & Hearing Science, Spring 2024)\n\nMentor: Dr. Shawn Goodman (Communication Sciences and Disorders)\n\nFast, Comprehensive Characterization of Middle Ear Muscle Reflex Dynamics\n\nIn normal-hearing listeners, moderately loud sounds cause a reflex contraction of a small ear muscle, which changes the amount of sound entering the inner ear. This auditory reflex is called the middle ear muscle reflex, or MEMR. Current MEMR tests evaluate only one frequency at a time and primarily focus on the presence/absence of the reflex, without additional information about how the reflex behaves. We have developed a new, faster MEMR test that tests many frequencies in a short time frame and provides insights into the reflex dynamics. We administered our new test to 30 young normal hearing participants and collected data about the reflex onset and offset thresholds, maximum total change, onset delay, and hysteresis. Our novel MEMR test produced reliable measurements in 2 minutes, suggesting potential clinical relevance in the future.\n\n30\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nChloeRohlf (Speech & Hearing, Spring 2024)\n\nMentor: Ishan Bhatt (Communication Sciences and Disorders )\n\nTwo-Directional Mendelian Randomization Between Tinnitus and Neuroticism\n\nTinnitus, a condition defined as ringing or noise in the ears or head, often accompanies feelings of anxiety and emotional difficulties, known as neuroticism. While past studies hint at a link between tinnitus and neuroticism, they did not confirm a cause-and-effect relationship due to limitations of the observational research design. To investigate whether tinnitus and neuroticism are causally associated, this research utilizes Mendelian randomization (MR). MR is often described as a nature's randomized control trial. Genetic variants are randomly distributed and cannot be changed by lifestyle and environmental factors; therefore, the MR framework could be used to obtain strong causal inferences. We conducted a two-directional MR experiment between tinnitus and neuroticism. Our results provided supporting evidence to suggest that neuroticism can cause tinnitus. However, there was not enough evidence to support the hypothesis that tinnitus can cause neuroticism. Future genetic studies with larger sample sizes are required to investigate the causal relationship between tinnitus and neuroticism.\n\n31\n\nEH 3:30-4:15\n\nOliviaSchuelka (Religious Studies and Psychology, Spring 2027)\n\nMentor:\n\nThe Branch Davidian Massacre\n\nI will be researching the death of the Branch Davidians via fire set to their compound located in Waco, Texas in 1993.

Importantly, such ‘information distortion’ can have a substantial influence on people’s final judgments and decisions. In this study, we aim to test the role of information distortion when making predictions about future outcomes. In this study, participants are presented with basic information about two job applicants and asked to make predictions about who got the job at an architecture firm. Even though the resume designs are equivalent in quality, we predict that participants would have a leading alternative that would influence their later evaluations and predictions about other components of the applications such as cover letters and ultimately who got the job.

One of the main DSB repair pathways is homologous recombination (HR). Homologous recombination is used during meiosis to repair SPO-11 induced DSBs that allow the homologous chromosomes to form crossovers that are essential for the successful exchange of genetic information. RAD-51 is a highly conserved, essential HR protein and due to its localization to break sites, RAD-51 foci are used as a marker for DSBs in immunofluorescence analysis. Our research has involved the creation of multiple epitope tagged versions of RAD-51 in C. elegans that result in different phenotypes regarding functionality in the HR pathway in meiosis. We have found that the iFLAG2::rad-51 strain appears to follow HR pathway close to wild-type. A functional tagged version of RAD-51 will have a wide range of applications in DNA damage response experiments, specifically in the visualization of the steps in the homologous recombination pathway.\n\n36\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nAditiTripathy (Biomedical Sciences, Spring 2025)\n\nMentor: Bengi Baran (Psychological and Brain Sciences)\n\nSleep Disturbances and Their Relation to Anxiety Symptoms in Children and Adolescents\n\nAnxiety disorders are one of the most common mental health conditions to affect teenagers in the United States. The primary goal of the present study is to determine whether children with anxiety disorders have disrupted sleep compared to a demographically-matched non-clinical comparison group. 43 participants between the ages of 9 and 13 wore an actigraphy watch (a wristwatch that is designed to record data on sleep and activity) for one week. Additionally, we collected parent-reported and clinical data across several domains, including depression, anxiety, internalizing behaviors and externalizing symptoms, and self-reported sleep quality. Self-reported clinical data involving depression (t(39)=2.35, p=.02), anxiety (t(39)=5.21, p=.006,), and internalizing behaviors (t(34)=3.61, p<.001) were all higher in the anxiety group than the control group. Along with that, parent reported clinical data involving depression (t(39)=5.21, p<.001), anxiety ((t(39)=5.18, p<.001), and internalizing behaviors (t(38)=6.60, p<.001) were higher in the anxiety group than the control group. Day-to-day variability in sleep duration was found to be significantly and positively correlated with PDSS scores (r=.35, p=.04). Self-reported anxiety scores were also found to be positively correlated (r=.36, p=.03) with wake after sleep onset (the amount of time spent awake after falling asleep). The results are in line with previous literature which finds that children and adolescents with anxiety disorders show reliable subjective reports of greater wake after sleep onset duration. These findings also emphasize the prevalence of sleep disturbances among adolescents with anxiety disorders, highlighting the importance of addressing them within treatment protocols.\n\n37\n\n3:30-4:15\n\nKellyVu (Pharmacy, Spring 2025)\n\nMentor: Jeanine Abrons (University of Iowa, College of Pharmacy)\n\nThe Perspectives of a Convenience Sample of Japanese Individuals on Herbal Medicine and Kampo Use for Pain Management\n\nMy project explores how Japanese patients perceive Kampo, a traditional or herbal medicine, for managing pain including premenstrual syndrome (PMS).

We explore the particular case of ferromagnet bi-layer honeycomb lattice which, when considering nearest- and next nearest-neighbor exchange interactions, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and easy-axis anisotropy, allows for topological magnons to arise [1]. We extend the Hamiltonian of Ref. [1] via the inclusion of extra interlayer interactions, in addition to various layers stack, i.e. A-B stacking or A-A stacking. We show this Hamiltonian hosts topological magnons that are controllable via the interlayer interactions. Most importantly, these new interactions provide a novel way to tailor and engineer different topological magnon frequency dispersion. Finally, we also calculate the magnon thermal Hall conductivity as a function of temperature and magnetic field. [1] H. Kim and S. K. Kim, Phys. Rev.

Glucocorticoid-based chemotherapy regimens are key to curing B-ALL, and response to glucocorticoids alone predicts patient outcomes. High-dose glucocorticoids remain ineffective for some patients with B-ALL and lead to significant toxicities for many patients. Since glucocorticoid doses cannot be increased further, the best approach to enhancing glucocorticoid activity is to identify targets which modulate glucocorticoid sensitivity. To do this, we utilized genome-wide CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screening to understand how gene inhibition impacts glucocorticoid-induced cell death. NALM6 B-ALL cells with the Zim3-dCas9 repression domain were engineered to express the Dolcetto sgRNA interference library. After recovery from puromycin selection, cells were divided into vehicle or dexamethasone treated groups. Cells were treated continuously for 2 weeks. At the end of treatment, extracted DNA libraries were prepared for sequencing. A volcano plot outlining the top genes protective or stimulatory to Glucocorticoid-induced cell death is produced here. Hits with the strongest phenotypes show potential for investigation in future studies. We would like to expand to other cell lines with unique genetic profiles to understand which patients would benefit from novel targeted therapies. The protocol produced in this study will be useful in innovative gene therapy investigations.\n\n40\n\nEH 3:45-4:45\n\nRagadOsman (Fine Arts, May 2025)\n\nMentor: Monica Correia (3D Design)\n\nSoft Seating for Lounge Areas\n\nWe are developing tools and techniques for making large scaled knitted furniture.

Transition metals like Iron and Manganese take precedence in coordination chemistry research, provided their d-orbital composition allows them to adapt different spin configurations depending on their ligand environment. My project uses the fundamentals of Ligand Field Theory to predict the structural properties of dinuclear metal complexes with O-phenylenediamine-derived redox non-innocent tetradentate ligands. Kyle Spielvogel, a former grad student from our group, noted that dinuclear iron complexes synthesized with these ligands have a compelling ability to adapt different spin configurations depending on their surrounding ligand environment. We aim to develop a significant understanding of how these ligands influence spin. My contribution has been synthesizing and helping characterize various types of tetradentate ligands. The process heavily relies on Buchwald Hartwig Coupling, where tetradentate ligands are synthesized by reacting an aryl halide with an appropriate diamine supported by a palladium catalyst, diphosphine ligand (BINAP), and a strong base. Post-synthesis requires filtration through celite, separation using liquid-liquid extraction, and purification via column chromatography; then, characterized using 1H NMR spectroscopy and Single Crystal XRD.\n\n44\n\nEH 3:45-4:45\n\nBriannaBohling-Hall (Double-Major in Journalism and Religious Studies, Spring 2026)\n\nMentor: Brandon Dean (UI Religious Studies)\n\nKingdom Come: The Christian Zionist Vision for Israel's Future\n\nMy project centers around the Christian Zionist movement, its complicated history with both Israel and the Jewish diaspora as a whole, and the dangers of conflating Judaism with Zionism.

Biology, Spring 2024)\n\nMentor: Briante Najev (Evolutionary Biology), Maurine Neiman (Evolutionary Biology)\n\nHow are invasive species able to persist in nutrient limited environments?\n\nNutrient limitation in nature forces organisms to make unconscious choices about how to distribute the limited resources they are given. These choices made wisely allow organisms to adapt to these nutrient limiting environments and persist. Of the most important nutrient limiting elements necessary to sustain life, a deficiency in phosphorus is one of the most common mineral deficiencies seen in nature. Phosphorus is necessary for DNA replication and rRNA production which directly affects growth and reproductive fitness in all animals. To better understand how limited phosphorus in an animals diet influences an animal to decide where to use the limited amount of phosphorus available, we used model organism Potamopyrgus antipodarum, a freshwater New Zealand mud snail that faces this same problem in nature, resulting in a wide variation in ploidy level and reproductive strategies within the species. In our lab we created varying phosphorus-limited environments for an invasive lineage of asexual P. antipodarum and studied their trade-offs between growth rate and reproductive abilities. We predicted that highly phosphorus-limited snails would designate most of their phosphorus to growth and little to reproduction, while snails with less of a phosphorus limitation would produce a higher number of embryos by the end of the experiment. Learning more about this invasive species’ ability to adapt to a limitation in phosphorus will give us a better understanding of how asexual P. antipodarum has been a successful invasive species and give us more clues to what characteristics are necessary for a species to have the ability to become invasive.\n\n46\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nZeidAboushaar (Biomedical science, Spring 2026)\n\nMentor: Catherine Marcinkiewcz (Neuroscience & Pharmacology)\n\nerotonin transmission in the nucleus accumbens encodes both rewarding and aversive stimuli\n\nSerotonin (5-HT) is a neurotransmitter associated with several mental illnesses. However, the function of serotonin transmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), an information processing center of the brain, is unclear. In our study, we set out to understand how 5-HT activity in the NAcc responds to various stimuli by tracking 5-HT levels in awake, behaving mice with a state-of-the-art technique, fiber photometry.. We observed that interaction with a same-sex, same-age conspecific led to an increase in 5-HT transients in the NAcc. Similarly, exposure to palatable food, like Froot Loops, resulted in elevated 5-HT transmission, especially during foraging behaviors. Furthermore, presentation of aversive stimuli, such as a predator odor, bright light, and lithium chloride injection, which induces visceral discomfort, also triggered increases in 5-HT transmission in the NAcc. Interestingly, there was no difference in 5-HT response to sweet (sucrose) and bitter (quinine) tastes. However, repeated exposure to aversive stimuli, like footshocks, eventually caused a reduction in 5-HT transients. This aligns with the concept of learned helplessness and suggests a potential link between decreased serotonin activity and depression. Our findings provide valuable new insights into serotonin signaling, shedding light on neural mechanisms underlying motivation and mood regulation.\n\n47\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nBrookeAnthos (Exercise Science, Spring 2025)\n\nMentor: Kara Whitaker (Health & Human Physiology), Jacob Gallagher (Health & Human Physiology)\n\nAssociations of Psychosocial Factors and Pregnancy Specific Health Related Quality of Life\n\nBackground & Purpose: Up to 70% of women experience nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, which negatively impacts perceived quality of life and may be related to worse psychosocial health. The aim of this study is to determine the associations of psychosocial factors and quality of life using a pregnancy-specific questionnaire. Methods: As part of the multi-site Pregnancy 24/7 cohort study, 424 women completed the Center of Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10), Perceived Stress Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Social Support, and Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy Specific Health Related Quality of Life Survey (NVPQOL) in each trimester of pregnancy. For each survey, higher scores indicate greater symptoms. A mixed effects model was used to analyze the association between psychosocial factors (exposures) and NVPQOL (outcome) controlling for trimester, education, income, study site, marital status, pre-pregnancy BMI, race, and ethnicity. Results: Depression (β = 3.9, p &lt; 0.01) and stress (β = 2.3, p &lt; 0.01) scores were associated with higher NVPQOL scores, indicating worse QoL. Social support (β = -0.4, p &lt; 0.01) was associated with lower NVPQOL scores, indicating better QoL. Conclusion: Depression, stress, and social support were associated with NVPQOL, yet it is unclear the directionality of this relationship.\n\n48\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nAddisonArens (pre-pharmacy, Spring 2029)\n\nMentor: Scott Shaw (Chemistry), Ned Bowden (Chemistry)\n\nEffects of Differing Concentrations of Biotin (Vitamin B7) and Vitamin C on E.

Previous work in the lab has shown that mutants rnh 1.0 and rnh 1.2 cause irreparable DSBs that manifest as chromosomal fragments. We studied several mutants of the rnh genes and measured the number of chromosomes and length of chromosomes in the diakinesis phase of meiosis. It was found that the rnh 1.0 rnh 1.2 rnh 2 mutants had a lower number of chromosomal fragments and a longer average chromosome length than the mutants rnh 1.0 rnh 2. This suggests that a possible role of the gene rnh 1.2 is to contribute to fragment formation or prevent chromosomal fusions in the absence of functional rnh 1.0 and rnh 2 genes.\n\n50\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nNicoleBoodhoo (Biomedical Sciences, Spring 2024)\n\nMentor: Gordon Buchanan (Neurology)\n\nCorticosterone’s potential role in seizure-induced death for amygdala kindled mice\n\nEpilepsy is a common neurological disease, affecting 65 million people worldwide. One-third of these patients are refractory to seizure medication, and the leading cause of death in this group is sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Breathing dysregulation and serotonin (5-HT) impairment following a seizure are likely causes of SUDEP. Enhancing 5-HT before a seizure improved consequent breathing, but 5-HT2C agonist MK-212 dose-dependently caused fatal seizures in wildtype mice and unexpectedly caused 100% of 5-HT2C knockout mice to die following seizures. We showed 5-HT2C receptor mediates breathing following a seizure, but mortality may be due to MK-212 off-target effects, such as increasing rodent stress hormone corticosterone. Stress commonly triggers seizures, and the corticosterone pathway represents a novel mechanism in SUDEP pathophysiology. Corticosterone antagonist + MK-212 injections showed lower endogenous corticosterone, compared to only MK-212, following serum assay. Mice experience lower mortality risk when corticosterone is decreased prior to induced seizures.\n\n51\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nMelodieBui (Human Physiology, BS, Spring 2026)\n\nMentor: Ray Fagenbaum (Health & Human Physiology)\n\nAge Differences in Atopic Dermatitis: Why Do Many Children “Outgrow” their Eczema?\n\nAtopic dermatitis (AD), often referred to as eczema, is one of the most common skin diseases mainly found in the pediatric population.

A typical human hair is around 50-70 microns in size. These rainfall events can also cause pollen grains to burst into fragments smaller than 2.5 microns, causing them to penetrate deeper into the respiratory system and cause more severe allergic reactions in susceptible individuals. This project investigates relationships between precipitation, wind speed, and intact pollen grains from a summer 2023 field study in Colorado, under the Bioaerosols and Convective Storms study. Samples were collected using a Burkard spore trap sampler and imaged under a microscope at 100x magnification. Airborne particulates which vary widely in size also vary in concentration over time, which necessitates a digital tool capable of automatically counting large volumes of pollen grains while separating them into different species and genera. This tool, which uses a neural network trained on over 200 pollen images with five classes, can further inform relationships between meteorological data and concentrations of specific pollen types.

Significant differences were identified between the cohorts related to rurality, healthcare, financial ability, and social support (p≤0.001). The themes of access to childcare, vaccine decisions, hospital restrictions, and online healthcare were found in written responses about patient’s experiences. Understanding drivers of patient burden will aid in the development of support programs.\n\n58\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nMaryHaag (astronomy, physics, spring 2024)\n\nMentor: Lori Adams (ISA)\n\nBurning Bright: How I wrote a children’s book about the Sun\n\nWriting a children’s book on a complicated science topic involves balancing accessibility and accuracy.

Less explored is whether individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with memory decline can demonstrate the ability to flexibly adjust their language depending on shared knowledge with a partner or partners. The current study examines whether individuals with AD can produce partner-specific language in conversation. Participants completed a picture sorting task where they created a description of each abstract image. They then completed image description testing with a conversation partner who does or does not know the image descriptions, or with both partners. Our findings demonstrated that individuals with AD modified language with respect to the shared knowledge, but the effect was attenuated especially for definite article use. This finding suggests individuals with AD produce rudimentary partner-specific language, but they are less flexible to reflect shared knowledge in article use, and this may be relevant to their frequent communication breakdowns in daily lives.\n\n60\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nElizabethHernandez (Anthropology, December 2023 Graduate)\n\nMentor: Corinne Watts (Anthropology), Katina Lillios (Anthropology)\n\nFibrolite Tools of Prehistoric Iberia: An Experimental Production\n\nFibrolite, the fibrous variant of sillimanite, is a mineral with notable concentrations in the Iberian Peninsula, as well as other regions of the world (Southwest US, e.g.). Fibrolite tools, such as axes and chisels, have been found in prehistoric archaeological sites dating between 5000 and 3000 BCE in Iberia. These tools are groundstone tools, meaning that they were fashioned through repetitive grinding and/or polishing. Although archaeologists have carried out extensive research on groundstone tools of various materials and types, the hardness of fibrolite (6.7-7.5 Mohs scale) has resulted in limited exploration of its manufacturing and use processes. This project aimed to address this gap through experimental archaeology, seeking to replicate the production of five fibrolite tools to better understand the manufacture of those excavated at prehistoric Iberian sites. Subsequent experimentation facilitated the identification of the most effective grinding materials, techniques, and sequences. Furthermore, methods for sharpening and polishing using leather and sand were established. Given the scarcity of experimental studies on fibrolite production, we hope that this research serves as a foundational resource for future investigations.\n\n61\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nKlaertjeHesselink (Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, Spring 2026)\n\nMentor: Giannis Mpourmpakis (Chemical and Petroleum Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh), Joe Gomes (Chemical and Biochemical Engineering)\n\nUnravelling the Stability of Trimetallic Nanoparticles using Machine Learning\n\nMetal nanoparticles have gained immense interest due to their wide application in various fields spanning from catalysis to nanoelectronics and drug delivery. However, nanoparticles have a vast configurational space which makes it difficult to implement traditional calculations such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) to find the most stable chemical ordering (arrangement of different metals) for a specific nanoparticle. Here, we apply the Bond Centric Model (BCM) coupled with an in-house developed Genetic Algorithm (GA), which can accurately and efficiently capture the stability of nanoparticles of any size, shape, and metal composition. We use a proof of concept to extend its usage to four trimetallic nanoparticles of Silver-Palladium-Platinum, Silver-Gold-Palladium, Silver-Gold-Palladium, and Silver-Copper-Palladium, made up of 2869 atoms, of cuboctahedral symmetry, with varying metal compositions. Our study reveals the total chemical ordering and, importantly, the surface composition of the nanoparticles resulting in the lowest cohesive energy (most thermodynamically preferred or most likely to be synthesized form of the nanoparticle). Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using the BCM and the developed GA to reveal the exact chemical ordering of highly thermodynamically stable trimetallic nanoparticles and reveals the importance of metal cohesion and bimetallic bond strength in the overall chemical ordering trends.\n\n62\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nKasiaJanik (Neuroscience, May 2026)\n\nMentor: Isaac Peterson (Psychological and Brain Sciences)\n\nThe Relationship of Socioeconomic Status with Inhibitory Control and N2 Amplitudes in Young Children\n\nThe development of inhibitory control in children is important for their school readiness. Socioeconomic status (SES) has been shown to be positively correlated with inhibitory control. Inhibitory control can be measured through N2 amplitudes, with smaller N2 amplitudes associated with poorer inhibition. SES and N2 amplitudes have been found to be positively correlated in older children, but there is limited research on the age at which SES begins to predict N2 amplitudes. In the present work, we examined whether SES is related to inhibitory control and N2 amplitudes, and the age at which links between SES and N2 amplitudes begin to arise. Using data from children aged 4-7 (N=206), we found that both higher family SES and increased N2 amplitudes are correlated with improved inhibitory control, however N2 amplitudes are not associated with SES. There was no association between N2 amplitudes and SES among older children, nor did age moderate any such links in the broader sample. This implies that SES does not predict N2 amplitudes in children younger than 10 years. Identifying other neurocognitive mechanisms that link SES to children’s development of inhibitory control would help with targeting preventative intervention for improving their school readiness.\n\n64\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nGabrielleKilpatrick (Business Analytics and Information Systems, Spring 2024)\n\nMentor: Michael Colbert (Business Analytics)\n\nProtecting Personal Data: Comparing US State and Federal Privacy Laws\n\nIn an era of rapid technological advancement, protecting personal data has become increasingly important. 'Protecting Personal Data: Comparing US State and Federal Privacy Laws' is a comprehensive literature review aiming to analyze the disparities between state-level regulations and federal laws governing data privacy and collection in the United States. This research features the complex challenges of evolving technology and the differing legislative landscape across US states. The project carefully examines the variations in data privacy protections across different states, shedding light on key legal differences and their implications in the data world. By contrasting US regulations with global perspectives, the research aims to contextualize the US’ approach to data privacy and collection with the broader international landscape, emphasizing the necessity for clear and cohesive data protection measures. Through this analysis, the project seeks to inform ongoing discussions surrounding data privacy legislation, advocating for a more unified and comprehensive framework at the federal level in the United States. By addressing these complexities, this research contributes to advancing data privacy discourse and highlights the importance of safeguarding personal data in the digital age on a federal level.\n\n65\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nMichaelLauer (Chemistry B.S., Spring 2026)\n\nMentor:\n\nRare earth metal mechanochemical separation technique utilizing heat and vaccum\n\nThe purpose of this research project is to investigate solvent free mechanochemical methods to separate rare earth metals from mixtures using heat, vacuum, and gravity. Rare earth metals are used in digital screens, strong magnets, batteries, lasers, nuclear reactor control rods, and X-ray machines to name a few of their applications. Thus, these elements are utilized in multiple different sectors within our society and are integral to these sectors' functionality. However, rare earth separation processes are solution based and generate large quantities of chemical waste. To test the idea of solvent free separations, experiments were conducted by grinding rare earth salts with another salt to form a new rare earth chemical that could be removed from the mixture by heating under vacuum. The salts were placed inside a glass t-tube connected to a cold finger. The assembly was then oscillated by a prototype Kugelrohr reactor to provide mechanochemical mixing of the salts while heating under vacuum. As the new chemical formed, it converted to a gas and the resulting gas deposited on the cold finger in a process known as sublimation. The results demonstrate a promising method of rare earth metal extraction without generating large amounts of solvent and chemical waste. Despite the simplicity of the prototype reactor, rare earth metal recovery yields were as high as 59%, with a mean yield rate of around 30% over about 30 experiments. Based on the experimental observations, modifications to the prototype and variables are proposed that may be used to further increase the yield of rare earth metal separations using mechanochemical processes.\n\n66\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nAsyaLengel (Chemistry, Spring 2025)\n\nMentor: Max Lei Geng (Chemistry and the Center for Biocatalysis and Bioprocessing)\n\nModeling Drug Dissolution Kinetics: Nonlinear Regression of Naproxen Sodium Dissolution Curves with the Weibull Model.\n\nIn pharmaceutical sciences, assessment of drug dissolution kinetics is crucial for developing new drug formulations, ensuring adherence to FDA regulations, maintaining consistency in drug manufacturing, and testing the shelf life of drug formulations. An essential step in analyzing a large number of experimental kinetic curves of drug dissolution is to identify outlier data points before modeling with dissolution models. Common mathematical models for drug dissolution, such as the Higuchi Model and Korsmeyer-Peppas Model, only describe the first 60% of dissolution determined by the boundary conditions in solving Fick’s diffusion laws. A model that characterizes the entire dissolution curve up to 100% is necessary for complete statistical outlier detection. The Weibull model has the capacity to describe the whole dissolution curve, which is promising for outlier detection and resolution for nonlinear least squares (NLLS) analysis of the kinetic profiles.\n\nIn this project, we establish the protocol for theoretical simulation and NLLS fitting of experimental dissolution curves with the Weibull law. Using programs written in MATLAB, we analyzed 59 sets of student experimental data to demonstrate the capacity of our protocol.\n\n67\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nXianghengLi (Economics, Math, and Psychology, Spring 2024)\n\nMentor: David Cooper (Economics)\n\nSocial Preferences with Multidimensional Group Identity\n\nThis research seeks to understand how social preferences change when different group identities are elicited.

In this experiment, participants' social identities (gender and political affiliation) will be primed by pictures. Later on, they will be asked to dictate the payoff that they would allocate between themselves and in-group/out-group members. Through statistical analysis, the study seeks to determine if there exists a relationship between social identities and payoff allocation.\n\n68\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nCadeMachin (Chemical Engineering, Spring 2027)\n\nMentor: Scott Shaw (Chemistry), Ned Bowden (Chemistry)\n\nEffects of Perfluorododecanoic Acid Concentrations on E. coli. Growth\n\nThe presence of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) commonly referred to as ‘forever chemicals’ poses a significant concern due to their slow breakdown and potential negative impact on human health. This study aims to determine the influence of Perfluorododecanoic Acid (PFDoA) concentrations on the growth of Escherichia coli (E. coli), a common strain of bacteria present in the human gastrointestinal tract and vital to digestive function. E. coli were exposed to various concentrations of PFDoA ranging from 0 ug/L to 50 ug/mL over a 48-hour incubation period in Petri dishes. Growth inhibition was assessed by measuring the radius of cell death surrounding a circular piece of blotting paper(diameter 5 mm) exposed to the PFDoA concentrations. Results will be compared with cell cultures exposed to bleach and water solutions to determine if PFDoA is an effective inhibitor of cell growth. These findings will highlight the potential effects that PFDoA concentrations have on human systems and if more investigation is needed into the study. Given PFDoA’s presence in grease-resistant coatings in food packaging and stain removers for furniture and carpets, understanding its potential health implications is imperative.\n\n68\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nDanielSchwarz (Chemical Engineering, Spring 2027)\n\nMentor: Scott Shaw (Chemistry), Ned Bowden (Chemistry)\n\nEffects of Perfluorododecanoic Acid Concentrations on E. coli.

The goal of this project is to investigate the differences in sleep macro and microstructure in individuals with bipolar disorder. 19 participants (10 individuals with BD and 9 non-psychiatric comparison subjects) completed an overnight sleep study with polysomnography (PSG) and a week-long actigraphy monitoring. Actigraphy analyses revealed that the mean waking up time was significantly later (t(14)=-2.37, p=.03), and day-to-day variability in activity levels (t(14)=-2.36, p=.03) were significantly higher in the BD group. Based on self-reported sleep quality surveys, sleep latency (t(14)=-2.62, p=.02) was also significantly higher in the BD group. Further, self-reports of sleep disruption correlated positively with psychiatric symptom severity. Analyses for PSG data are underway to compare sleep microstructure between groups. This preliminary analysis points to disruptions in objectively measured sleep and activity patterns in bipolar disorder. Further analyses in this project will delve deeper into the nature of sleep physiology.\n\n70\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nSarahMcGee (Biochemistry, Spring 2025)\n\nMentor: Tori Forbes (Chemistry )\n\nTuning hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces of uranium metal organic nanotube to control selectivity.\n\nMetal organic nanotubes (MONTs) are hybrid materials with 1-D nanopores that exhibit unusual chemical and physical behavior associated with confined solvent effects. We have previously developed a uranium metal organic nanotube (UMONT) that displays exclusive selectivity towards water and exhibits ice-like ordering of the confined molecules. We hypothesize that this selectivity is related to an interplay between the mixed hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups that exist along the internal channel walls of the nanotube. We have evaluated this hypothesis first by coating the surface of UMONT material with hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups using precursors such as Ammonium trifluoroacetate, Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and Polyacrylonitrile (PAN). We have characterized the surface of the modified UMONT materials using Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Batch uptake experiments were conducted with common solvents such as methanol, ethanol and D2O to assess solvent absorption into the modified UMONT materials. The percentage of of adsorption of solvents were evaluated using Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the specific solvents thus adsorbed were confirmed by TGA paired with FTIR.\n\n71\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nBenMullen (Chemistry B.S., Spring 2026)\n\nMentor: Tori Forbes (Chemistry), Vidumini Samarasiri (Chemistry)\n\nIn situ generation of organic peroxides to create uranyl peroxides under acidic conditions\n\nUranyl peroxides form because of water radiolysis in high radiation fields created by nuclear fuel. These phases are very soluble under basic conditions, which create a pathway for nuclear materials to leak into the environment. Studite and metastudtite are two such uranyl peroxides that are found in nature. Studite is formed in the surface of spent nuclear fuel and this has a high impact on releasing radionuclides into the atmosphere. Most studies on Studite have been performed by adding 30% H2O2 to the system, but this large influx of peroxide is very different than the constant ingrowth of low levels of H2O2 that is formed due to alpha hydrolysis of water. We have utilized oxygen based radical initiator benzaldehyde/benzyl alcohol system under varying pH conditions to generate peroxides within the reaction mixture and investigate it’s interactions with uranyl cation. Interestingly, we have seen that with no addition of peroxide, in situ generation of an organic peroxide yield the formation of studtite under acidic medium. We have characterized the formed crystalline materials under different pH conditions with Raman spectroscopy and powder x-ray diffraction.\n\n72\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nGuillermoNg Yi (Biomedical Engineering, Spring 2025)\n\nMentor: Ronald Weigel (Surgery), Donna Santillan (Obstetrics and Gynecology)\n\nMachine Learning model to predict Recurrence Risk for Papillary Thyroid Cancer patients\n\nOur project aims to develop a machine learning model that predict the risk of recurrence in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). PTC is the most common type of thyroid cancer, and about 20% of survivors experience recurrence. To accomplish this, we performed RNA sequencing on 16 PTC specimens, dividing them into two groups: 8 with recurrence and 8 without. Using the gene expression data, we trained, validated, and tested classifier models using scikit-learn in Python. Our current focus is on identifying the genes that play a significant role in predicting recurrence. By narrowing down this list, we aim to enhance the accuracy of our models, which currently achieve an average accuracy of 75%-86.21%. In the future, we plan to validate our models using publicly available RNA sequencing data from other PTC patients and potentially integrate them into prospective clinical trials. These models have the potential to revolutionize clinical practice by enabling clinicians to develop personalized treatment plans for PTC patients, thereby improving their quality of life and outcomes.\n\n73\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nMaanyaPandey (Public Health, Spring 2026)\n\nMentor: Donna Santillan (Obstetrics & Gynecology)\n\nUnderstanding reasons for aspirin non-compliance in pregnancy\n\nThis study investigates aspirin noncompliance among pregnant women as a preventive measure against preeclampsia, a significant risk during pregnancy. Utilizing user experiences from the 'Preeclampsia, Eclampsia & HELLP Syndrome Survivors Global Support Network' Facebook Group, qualitative analysis was conducted on posts related to aspirin use during pregnancy. Findings reveal that while 63.21% of posts indicated compliance, 36.12% reported noncompliance or undetermined compliance. Common themes influencing compliance included lack of knowledge (65.89%), fear of preeclampsia incidence (42.47%), adverse effects (21.07%), questioning provider advice (27.76%), and questioning benefit (16.72%). The study underscores the complexity of factors contributing to aspirin noncompliance among pregnant women and highlights the gap in research with pregnant women’s experience. These insights emphasize the need for tailored interventions addressing knowledge gaps, patient experiences, and concerns about adverse effects. These insights are crucial for removing barriers to improve user knowledge and adherence to aspirin therapy and mitigate preeclampsia-related complications during pregnancy, ultimately enhancing maternal and fetal health outcomes.\n\n74\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nAnnaPeach (Global Health Studies, Spring 2024)\n\nMentor: Blake Rupe (Hubbell Environmental Law Initiative)\n\nCollege Food Security: Practices and Perspectives of Students at the University of Iowa and Kirkwood Community College\n\nFood security is a nationwide issue that has been shown to disproportionately affect college students. Campus resources, including food pantries and financial support systems, are often used to address this, yet there is little research on the access to off-campus resources (e.g. city, county, or state funded) or shopping locations utilized by students. The purpose of this study is to understand the practices and perspectives of undergraduate students related to food security, knowledge of food assistance resources, and barriers to obtaining food within the Iowa City-Cedar Rapids area. A sequential mixed methods approach was used at the University of Iowa and Kirkwood Community College with an initial survey to understand undergraduate knowledge of resources and food security. A subsequent round of interviews investigated the practices of students in acquiring food and related stressors. Results indicate that while food security is a unique experience for all, similarities exist in the barriers to food access and gaps in aid for college students in this region.\n\n75\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nNicoleQuist (Environmental Science, B.S.

Treating bur oak blight is time consuming and expensive, so identifying the disease from satellite images would be helpful in determining specific areas to target for treatment. The goal of this project was to test whether seasonal progression of bur oak blight across a range of severities could be detected using high resolution PlanetScope satellite imagery. The work was based on surveys conducted in 2022, which quantified the severity of infection of hundreds of trees near West Okoboji Lake, and PlanetScope imagery spanning beginning to end of summer 2022. Using ArcGIS and R Statistical Computing, we tested for statistically significant seasonal changes in the satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) among blight severity status categories that occurred between early summer and late summer. We found that seasonal NDVI change did not vary significantly by bur oak blight status, suggesting that other satellite products with different spectral bands or finer temporal resolutions may be necessary to detect bur oak blight from space.\n\n76\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nAshleyRhodes (Biomedical Engineering, Spring 2024)\n\nMentor: James Byrne (Radiation Oncology and Biomedical Engineering), Emily Witt (Radiation Oncology)\n\nNovel drug delivery system to streamline the treatment of Non- Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer\n\nNon-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is a highly prevalent cancer in the US with nearly 80,000 individuals diagnosed annually. Standard-of-care treatment for NMIBC involves surgical resection of the tumor, followed by immunotherapy or chemotherapy. However, the process requires patients to undergo an extended period of outpatient care, contributing to burden on healthcare professionals and a decrease in patient compliance. To simplify the treatment of NMIBC, enhance patient compliance, and alleviate the demand for a trained urologist, we developed a novel, controlled drug delivery implant. The device consists of a drug-loaded, spiraled tube sealed with a carbohydrate cap and coated with a fluorinated polymer. The flexible design allows the patient to remain mobile without impacting the flow of urine. The implant can be administered via Foley catheter by any medical personnel and provides a tunable delivery of chemotherapy. The implant will not only streamline the treatment of NMIBC, but also can be used to treat urinary tract infections and other bladder diseases as well.\n\n77\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nCarolineSchmidt (speech and hearing sciences, spring 2024)\n\nMentor: Si On Yoon (Communication Sciences and Disorders), Kristi Kendrickson (Communication Sciences and Disorders)\n\nMore modifications in older adults despite slower competitor activation\n\nPrevious studies have shown how cognitively taxing context affects language production in cognitively healthy adults. For example, the presence of semantic competitors (e.g., pine tree – maple tree) makes language production more difficult. It results in increased error rates and delays in producing the target word. We employed eye-tracking in the Visual Word Paradigm to examine how older adults produce target words when faced with competition from a semantic competitor. Thirty-two younger and thirty-two older adults were shown four pictures on a screen and were instructed to describe a target image, which was indicated by a black box. We manipulated the presence of a competitor on the screen. In the competitor-present condition, a semantically related competitor image was displayed (e.g., target: pine tree, competitor: maple tree), while in the competitor-absent condition, the target was semantically unrelated to all other images on the screen (e.g., laptop).\n\n78\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nMaxwellShumaker (Environmental Science (Chemical Track), Spring 2026)\n\nMentor: Xueshu Li (Occupational and Environmental Health), Hans-Joachim Lehmler (Occupational and Environmental Health)\n\nPCB 11 (3,3'-dichlorobiphenyl) and its Hydroxylated Metabolites in the Brain of Humanized Mice\n\nPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent organic pollutants known to have adverse health effects. One PCB congener, 3,3'-Dichlorobiphenyl (PCB 11), has gained attention due to its presence in the environment and potential health risks. PCB 11 is metabolized by mammalian cytochrome P450 enzymes to hydroxylated metabolites. To understand the mechanism and toxicity of PCB 11, different genetically modified mouse models, including wild-type, Cyp2abfgs-null, CYP2A6-humanized, and CYP2B6-humanized mice, were exposed to PCB 11 by a single oral dose (500 μmol/kg body weight) or vehicle only (peanut oil, 10 mL/kg body weight). After 24 hours of exposure, the animals were euthanized, and brain tissues were collected and stored in a freezer for further analysis. The PCB 11 and its hydroxylated metabolites in brain tissues were extracted using a liquid-liquid extraction method and analyzed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The preliminary results showed the presence of PCB 11, and three major hydroxylated PCB 11 metabolites, including 4-OH-PCB11, 5-OH-PCB11, and 4,5-diOH-PCB11 in the brain tissues. Further investigations into the toxicity of PCB11 in mice are underway.\n\n79\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nAvaSnider (Speech & Hearing Science, Spring 2024)\n\nMentor: Philip Combiths (Communication Sciences and Disorders)\n\nPatterns of Stop Spirant-Approximant Alternation in Spanish-English Speaking Bilingual Children with Speech Sound Disorders\n\nThe stop/spirant-approximant alternation in Spanish is a typical allophonic sound change pattern that occurs with consonants sounds /b, d, ɡ/. This pattern has typically been described according to context-based rules, such that the stop forms [b, d, ɡ] are expected to be produced at the beginning of an utterance, after a pause, or after certain preceding consonants. In all other positions, a spirant-approximant consonant sound [β̞, ð̞, ɣ̞] is expected. However, little research has evaluated the acquisition of this allophonic pattern or in the context of children with speech sound disorders. Research on these topics is necessary to prevent health disparities in speech-language pathology. This study identifies how the stop/spirant-approximant alternation is produced by Spanish-English bilingual children with speech sound disorders. A picture-based elicitation probe was used to elicit single-word productions in Spanish. The alternation was present in 110 of the productions. Children’s speech productions were recorded and transcribed using narrow phonetic notation. Acoustic analyses of the children’s productions of stop/spirant-approximants, including relative measures of duration and intensity, were extracted from spectrograms to identify stop and spirant-approximant-like productions. Results provide insight into the development of this speech pattern in Spanish-English bilinguals with implications for accurate speech assessment in this population.\n\n80\n\n4:20-5:05\n\nAndresValdez Perez (Biomedical Engineering, Spring 2025)\n\nMentor: Don Anderson (Orthopedics and Rehab)\n\nReplicability of Segmentations in Reconstructed Tibio-Talar Joints for Joint Space Width Calculations\n\nReconstruction of the ankle joint following a distal tibial fracture is associated with the onset of osteoarthritis (OA), with around 76% of individuals experiencing symptoms in 10 years. A commonly used metric to detect early signs of OA is joint space from 2-D scans. However, a more modern approach is joint space width (JSW) in 3D using weight bearing CT scans. The first step to determine JSW is to isolate the bones of interest using manual segmentation techniques. However, the image quality and lack of image contrast sensitivity in joints with metal screws and plates can potentially hinder the precision and replicability of bone segmentations; therefore, deviating JSW from the true values.
