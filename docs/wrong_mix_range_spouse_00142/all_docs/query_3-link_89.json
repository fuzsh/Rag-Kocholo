        "text": "Jon Peters and Pamela Anderson have been dear friends for decades.\n\nThey married very briefly in 2020.\n\nJon recently said he’d be leaving the ‘Baywatch’ beauty $10 million in his will.\n\nThough the pre-pandemic 2020 marriage between Jon Peters, 77, and Pamela Anderson, 55, allegedly lasted only 12 days, the duo apparently remain tight. In fact, he recently told Variety that he’d be leaving her a rather large sum of money in his will. “I will always love Pamela, always in my heart,” he told the outlet in revealing new comments published in January of 2023. “As a matter of fact, I left her $10 million in my will. And she doesn’t even know that. Nobody knows that. I’m just saying it for the first time with you. I probably shouldn’t be saying it. So that’s for her, whether she needs it or not.”\n\nThe Hollywood movie mogul tied the knot with the Playboy icon in a secret ceremony on Jan. 20, 2020. The nuptials marked a full-circle moment for the pair who first dated more than three decades ago. Word is, the couple had reconnected in late 2019, but kept their relationship under wraps for months. Speaking about the Baywatch bombshell, Jon told THR at the time, “There are beautiful girls everywhere. I could have my pick, but — for 35 years — I’ve only wanted Pamela.” He added, “She makes me wild — in a good way.”\n\nAlthough little is known about the top-secret Malibu wedding, both Jon and Pamela’s children were in attendance. Caleigh and Skye Peters, attended with their mother Christina Forsyth-Peters, Jon’s second wife. His daughter Kendyl Peters, from his fourth marriage, also attended along with Pamela’s sons Brandon and Dylan Lee from her marriage to musician Tommy Lee.\n\nHowever, under two weeks later, their marriage was already kaput. “I have been moved by the warm reception to Jon and my union,” Pamela related in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. “We would be very grateful for your support as we take some time apart to re-evaluate what we want from life and from one another. Life is a journey and love is a process.”\n\nWant to know more about Jon? Here are five things you need to know about Pamela’s ex, who’s clearly still smitten with her.\n\n1. Jon first proposed to Pamela nearly 30 years ago.\n\nShortly after meeting in the mid-80s, Jon popped the question, but Anderson turned him down citing their age difference. Jon remembers telling her, “‘In 30 years, our age difference won’t mean so much.’”\n\n2. Jon’s marriage to Pamela marked his fifth turn at the altar.\n\nBoth Jon and Pamela celebrated their fifth weddings when they tied the knot at the Jan. 20 ceremony. Jon divorced his first wife Henrietta Zampitella in 1966 and had one son with his second wife, the Oscar-nominated actress Lesley Ann Warren before their marriage ended in 1977. He had two daughters, Caleigh and Skye, with his third wife Christina Forsyth-Peters in a marriage that lasted six years before his fourth go at the alter in 2001 when he married Mindy Peters. He had one daughter with Mindy, named Kendyl.\n\n3. Before he was a Hollywood heavy hitter, Jon worked as a hairdresser on Rodeo Drive.\n\nHis father was a cook who owned a Hollywood diner, until his untimely death when Jon was 10. His mother’s side of the family owned a renowned salon on Rodeo Drive – so he joined the family business. It was here that Jon made his first film industry connections, eventually designing a wig that Barbra Streisand wore in the 1974 film For Pete’s Sake.\n\n4. He had a torrid love affair with Barbra Streisand for 12 years.\n\nAfter meeting on the set of For Pete’s Sake, the pair began a passionate affair that lasted more than a decade. Jon produced Barbra Streisand‘s studio album Butterfly, and gained a producing credit on the 1976 remake of A Star Is Born. Although their relationship ended, and Jon had two daughters with his third wife Christine Forsyth-Peters soon afterward, he named Barbara the godmother of his two girls.\n\n5. Jon went on to produce some of the industry’s biggest hits."
