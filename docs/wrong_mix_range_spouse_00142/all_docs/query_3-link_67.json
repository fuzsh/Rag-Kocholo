        "text": "Money and love are closely connected. At least, this is the opinion of psychoanalyst Peter Schneider, who claims that money plays a really important role when couples separate. Divorce attorneys tell stories of people who, long before any divorce, hide away all their assets in case of a separation. Actress and model Pamela Anderson is a lucky exception to this rule. We’d love for you to find out how Pam became the witness of a true love and generosity in her life, all because of one man.\n\nJon Peters might have been Pamela’s ideal husband.\n\nPamela Anderson and producer Jon Peters secretly tied the knot in a private ceremony in Malibu in 2020. They may have seen their fair share of relationships during the years, but they previously dated more than 30 years ago.\n\nBack then, Jon was very enthusiastic about his relationship with Pamela. In his interview, he said, “There are beautiful girls everywhere. I could have my pick, but—for 35 years—I’ve only wanted Pamela. She makes me wild—in a good way.”\n\nThe man strongly supported and believed in everything that Pamela did. He said, “Pamela has never seen her full potential as an artist. She has yet to shine in a real way. There is much more to her than meets the eye, or I wouldn’t love her so much.”\n\nTheir marriage lasted for such a short time that it might have been a record.\n\nIt’s not a secret that Pamela Anderson had been in many relationships before. One of the most tumultuous marriages that she had was the one with the musician Tommy Lee. Their marriage lasted for 3 years and was full of scandals. However, in her 2023 memoir, Pamela wrote: “My relationship with Tommy may have been the only time I was ever truly in love.”\n\nHer marriage with Jon Peters lasted far less than one with Tommy Lee. The couple spent 12 days in a happy union and then called it quits.\n\nHowever, despite such a short family journey, the ex-spouses kept only warm memories of each other. “He’s great and has been a huge influence on my life. I love him to death”, said Pamela in her interviews. Additionally, Peters, 77, never hesitated to pay her back with even a bigger kindness and included Pam in his will.\n\nThe $10,000,000 gift from Jon was a huge surprise for everyone, even for Pamela.\n\nPeters, 77, recently revealed he’s giving Pamela $10 million in his will.\n\nHe said, “I will always love Pamela, always in my heart. As a matter of fact, I left her $10 million in my will. And she doesn’t even know that. Nobody knows that. I’m just saying it for the first time with you. I probably shouldn’t be saying it. So that’s for her, whether she needs it or not.”\n\nWhat makes it even more surprising is that Anderson earlier revealed that she was “never legally married” to Peters, explaining that Peters is a “lifelong family friend.” She added, “No hard feelings — no marriage, no divorce...just a bizarre theatrical lunch.”"
