        "text": "Background\n\nPamela Anderson was one of the most popular “Playboy” playmates, and her dazzling beauty and cheerful personality have won her millions of fans throughout the world. She had a turbulent childhood, yet she has made significant contributions to the world. Pamela Anderson was born on July 1, 1967, in Ladysmith, British Columbia, Canada. Her parents are Carol Anderson and Barry Anderson, and her zodiac sign is Cancer. The day of her birth was also the centennial anniversary of the Canadian Confederation, making her a Centennial baby. As a result, her baby pictures were everywhere.\n\nHer dazzling beauty helped kick start her modeling career in her native Canada. She gained the attention of a Canadian beer brand for wearing the brand’s T-shirt to watch a football game, and the beer brand went on to make her a company spokesperson. Eventually, she became more popular when she was chosen as the cover girl in the October 1989 “Playboy” magazine issue. A few months later, she relocated to Los Angeles, U.S.A., and became the Playmate of the Month for the February 1990 issue of the magazine. Anderson transitioned into acting and was soon taking lead roles in movies.\n\nAnderson’s first movie was “The Taking of Beverly Hills” (1991), where she was a movie extra as a cheerleader. She also featured in “Home Improvement,” her first real acting job in the same year. Two years later (1993), she got her first starring role in the movie “Snapdragon,” after which she featured in many other films. However, Anderson became a household name when she acted in “Baywatch” in 1995. Anderson was inducted into the Canadian Walk of fame in 2006. She is also an author and has written many books, some of which include her own autobiographies. Anderson has been married multiple times."
