        "text": "Pamela Anderson is everywhere these days, thanks to a Netflix documentary and her bestselling autobiography, and now, according to a friend, she’s secretly shopping around a reality show. After taking a long break (living in France etc) from the spotlight, Pam is officially BACK. She’s never been known for her acting and she loved working on her documentary, so she feels a reality show would be the perfect fit. She sold her Malibu home awhile back, so it would likely be filmed on her sprawling estate in Canada and revolve around her handsome sons and her Hollywood comeback.\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA Pam and son Brandon in NYC\n\nHappy to see that Pamela Anderson was a smashing success on her opening night as Roxie Hart in the musical Chicago on Broadway. What Pam has in common with the character Roxie is that they were both tabloid favorites and quite accustomed to flashbulbs. (Set in the 1920’s, glamour doll Roxie murdered her lover and pled self defense in court) Everybody wondered if Pam could pull off the singing and dancing required, and she DID! Reviewers agreed that she was not only funny, but can carry a tune, and had some hot dance moves. Her fans in the audience clapped and cheered through the whole show, giving gave her a standing ovation. Her love life might be disappointing, but Pamela’s career is looking goooood. Above, she was mobbed by fans when she exited the stage door after the show.\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nPamela Anderson is in New York looking adorable and she’s there for a good reason. She’s promoting her upcoming role as Roxie Hart in Chicago (the second longest running Broadway show.) Between divorces, Pam like to take a break and actually work. In January, she filed for divorce from her fifth husband, bodyguard Dan Hayhurst. Remember – she divorced Jon Peters after 12 days and moved to France for YEARS while dating a soccer player. And she was married to Kid Rock for four months – she didn’t want to move to Michigan! Pam is also working on a Netflix docu-series about her colorful life – her preparation in New York for Chicago is being filmed for the documentary. She’s hoping this will make people forget about the Hulu series Pam and Tommy than she did NOT like…\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nAt first glance this photo looks like Pamela Anderson arriving at Good Morning America with her serious-faced manager. She’s currently promoting her new role as Roxie Hart in the Broadway musical Chicago. But that’s NOT just her manager – it’s actually her 25 year old son Brandon Thomas Lee, (Tommy Lee is his dad) who looks like he might be ACTING as her manager. Brandon calls himself an actor/producer and he’s had a few movie roles, plus he played himself on The Hills. He loves golf so much that last year he designed a line of “retro preppy golf wear” under the brand name Swinger’s Club. Not sure how the line is doing, but he did use a golf club as his weapon of choice to chase an intruder out of his house not long ago. Anyway, he doesn’t seem to be following in his father’s rock star footsteps…\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nFirst time we saw UK actress Lily James (top photo) she was playing Lady Rose on Downton Abbey. Imagine our surprise when we realized she is now starring as Playboy icon/Baywatch star Pamela Anderson in the Hulu miniseries Pam & Tommy. We never would have guessed she could look SO much like Pam. Hopefully Pam & Tommy is comedic because we remember their relationship so well and they always seemed to be having a good time. Pam and the Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee were only married for four years, but they were a power couple in the 90’s. Whenever they showed up together at an event there was a huge fuss and a paparazzi frenzy. They were famous for their crazy quotes and extreme fashions. Fun while it lasted.\n\nPhotos: Instagram\n\nA few years ago, Pamela Anderson, 53, left her cheating soccer-player boyfriend in France and moved back home to Canada, where she has 6 acres of property on Vancouver Island. Her grandmother had originally owned the land and Pam bought it 25 years ago. (Her parents still live there) There are several homes and a dock that she has been remodeling – with the help of her bodyguard, Dan Hayhurst, who is also a builder. They were isolated together during the pandemic, fell in love, and got married in December. Pam seems deliriously happy – she describes her new man as “a good guy- the kind I would have met if I’d stayed home.” Then she calmly disparaged her previous 4 husbands (Tommy Lee, Kid Rock, Rick Salomon, and Jon Peters) by adding “It’s nice to be with a real man who can change a light bulb!”\n\nPhoto: Instagram\n\nCannot IMAGINE what got into Pam Anderson that she even entertained the NOTION of marrying the disreputable Jon Peters, who is commonly known in Hollywood as another Harvey Weinstein. (She didn’t google him?) Peters started as a hairdresser and used women like Barbra Streisand to climb the ladder of success and become a Hollywood “producer.” He’s notorious as a sexual harasser and predator who’s been sued numerous times by employees – he once exposed himself to his personal assistant AND her two year old daughter! She won her case and collected 3 million. Peters is also renowned for the nasty rages, threats, and vulgarity that he got away with for years. Pam needs to have her head examined…\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nPamela Anderson has certainly turned out to be a modern woman. She not only split with her French soccer playing boyfriend Adil Rami when she caught him cheating, but she announced it online with a lot of the lurid details! Certainly it will be an interesting read for his future girlfriends! Apparently he’s been stringing along – at least two and maybe more – women with the same ardent expressions of undying love. When Pam investigated and discovered his deception she was devastated, and felt “scammed.” She describes Adil as a narcissist and monster, and she’s leaving France.\n\nAbove, Love this photo of Pam’s son Brandon Lee giving Adil a doubtful look…\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nPamela Anderson’s son Brandon Lee has expressed his doubts about his mother’s relationship with young French soccer player Adil Rami. Pam’s family and friends think Adil is keeping her too busy and away from them- they live together in the South of France. Pam is encouraging her sons to visit her more often – Brandon turned up for a fundraiser in Monaco.\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA"
