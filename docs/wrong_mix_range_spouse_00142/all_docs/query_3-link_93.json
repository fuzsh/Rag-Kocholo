        "text": "Pamela Anderson fell in love with bodyguard Dan Hayhurst during quarantine, tying the knot on Christmas Eve 2020. The pair married on a property on Vancouver Island in Canada that Anderson bought from her grandparents, and where her own parents had tied the knot.\n\nRolling Stone reported on January 20, 2022, that Anderson had filed for divorce from Hayhurst.\n\nRegarding Dan Hayhurst, his claim to fame lies primarily in his relationship with Pamela Anderson. As a professional bodyguard hailing from Canada, he didn't have prior exposure to the limelight. However, his relationship with Anderson has thrust him into the public eye. Despite being relatively unknown before his romance with the famed actress, the happy couple now enjoys their lives together in privacy.\n\nPamela Anderson's whirlwind romance with French soccer player Adil Rami began in late 2017. The couple met at the Formula 1 Grand Prix in Monaco, sparking an immediate connection. Dating for two years, the duo made headlines for their glamorous and jet-set lifestyle, often spending time between France and Los Angeles. Unfortunately, they called it quits in June 2019, amid allegations of infidelity on Rami's part.\n\nAdil Rami established himself as a renowned footballer, playing center-back for various high-profile clubs, including Paris Saint-Germain and Marseille. Apart from his relationship with Anderson, Rami has also been linked to other prominent figures, such as French model Sidonie Biémont, with whom he shares twins. The talented athlete has accomplished much in his career, including helping the French national team win the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nIn 2007, Pamela Anderson and Rick Salomon, a professional poker player, began their tumultuous romantic journey together. They first laid eyes on each other in Las Vegas and got married that same year but decided to annul their marriage in early 2008. However, the couple couldn't stay away from each other and remarried in 2014, only to divorce once again in 2015. Their rollercoaster relationship was characterized by intense romance, passionate reunions, and tumultuous breakups.\n\nRick Salomon is a famous professional poker player, who has participated in some of the world's most prestigious tournaments. He gained notoriety in Hollywood for his high-profile relationships, including marriages to actresses Shannen Doherty and Elizabeth Daily. Additionally, he was linked with Paris Hilton following the release of their infamous sex tape in 2003. Despite his tumultuous personal life, Salomon remains an accomplished poker player.\n\nPamela Anderson briefly dated American figure skater and TV personality Matt Evers in 2012, after meeting on the set of the British reality show Dancing on Ice. Their on-screen chemistry quickly translated into a real-life romance, as they were spotted together on numerous occasions. However, their relationship proved short-lived and ended amicably after a few months.\n\nMatt Evers is well known for his successful career as a figure skater, having won multiple national championships. He gained popularity in the UK as a professional skater on Dancing on Ice, where he partnered with various celebrities in different seasons of the show. In addition to his fruitful sports career, Evers has made headlines for his advocacy of LGBTQ+ rights, coming out publicly as gay in 2018.\n\nPamela Anderson and illusionist Criss Angel had a brief romance in 2007 after meeting at Anderson's VIP Halloween party in Las Vegas. They were frequently seen together throughout their short-lived fling, even performing together in a magic show that took place at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino. The duo parted ways within a few months, with both parties remaining relatively tight-lipped about the details of their relationship.\n\nCriss Angel is a world-renowned magician and illusionist, best known for his Las Vegas stage shows and television program Criss Angel Mindfreak. He has received numerous accolades for his mind-bending performances, including being named the Magician of the Decade by the International Magicians Society. Besides his tryst with Anderson, Angel has dated other high-profile names, such as Holly Madison and Sandra González.\n\nIn 2007, Pamela Anderson had a brief but well-publicized romance with comedian and actor David Spade. They were first introduced by mutual friends at a party and hit it off immediately. Soon after, they turned heads when spotted canoodling on the beach. Although their relationship was short-lived, it left a lasting impression on the public.\n\nDavid Spade is a comedic genius, celebrated for his work on Saturday Night Live and popular movies like Tommy Boy and Joe Dirt. His quick wit and sarcastic humor have earned him a successful career in both film and television. In addition to his dalliance with Anderson, Spade has been romantically linked to a slew of other famous beauties, including Heather Locklear, Lara Flynn Boyle, and Naya Rivera."
