        "text": "Dalton began his training at London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in 1964 and spent his summers studying at the National Youth Theatre. He made his debut on stage in Shakespeare's Coriolanus at the Queen's Theatre. He left RADA after almost two years and joined the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. Actor John Rhys-Davies, a classmate of Dalton's at RADA and later his co-star in The Living Daylights, has commented on Dalton's incredible sexual presence on stage during the late 9060s and how women would wait outside the stage door for him.\n\nIt wasn't long before movie producers came calling. He made his film debut in 1968's The Lion In Winter, starring Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn, and went on to star in such films as Wuthering Heights (1970), Cromwell (1970), and Mary, Queen Of Scots (1971). Dalton commented in 1987 that after these films, he had felt \"the need to go back to the stage.\" Devoting himself to the theatre, Dalton made only one film between 1972 and 1978.\n\nIn 1987, after being cast as Bond, Timothy Dalton spoke about his long path to slipping on the shoulder-holster. \"When I was about 25, Mr Broccoli kindly asked me if I would be interested in taking over from Sean Connery who was about to relinquish Bond,\" he recalled. \"It was not a firm offer, but an expression of interest. Frankly, I thought it would have been a stupid move for me. I was too young - Bond should be between 35 and 40 years old.\" Dalton continued acting, playing a wide variety of roles. \"Then, several years ago, when Roger Moore was uncertain about continuing as 007, I was approached again. The situation was very vague, there wasn't a script yet, and I had already been asked to do Flash Gordon. But I was pleased to have been considered. When I was asked in early 1986, I was unavailable. I was doing my own stage production of Antony And Cleopatra and The Taming Of The Shrew so the schedules conflicted and the idea went out the window again.\" Dalton's inability to sign in early 1986 led the filmmakers to pursue Pierce Brosnan, but when Brosnan proved unavailable owing to the renewal of his Remington Steele television contract, producers Cubby Broccoli and Michael G Wilson returned to Dalton, who again had conflicts, as he was working on the film Brenda Starr, released in 1989. The producers agreed to delay the start of production of The Living Daylights if Dalton accepted, becoming the fourth 007 in Eon Productions' Bond series."
