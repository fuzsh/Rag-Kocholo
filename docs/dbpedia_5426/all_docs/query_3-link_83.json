        "text": "The Society of Edgar Families\n\nNews Letters\n\nHome\n\nThe Society of Edgar families was founded in Melbourne Australia on 24th February 1937. The society had two main objectives:\n\nTo promote and encourage the study of the history Edgar family\n\nTo make permanent records of all data collected by members\n\nSadly the society of Edgar families is no longer with us, but one thing that they have left behind for us all is their newsletters, these newsletters are nothing short of a goldmine for those interested in Edgar family history.\n\nThe following News Letters were kindly transcribed by Maggie Tucker, Australia (An Edgar descendant). We owe Maggie a massive \"thank you\" for taking the time and effort to make these newsletters available to us all.\n\nNews Letter Number One\n\nSociety of Edgar Families\n\nMelbourne, Australia\n\nEDITORIAL\n\n\"The Society of Edgar families was formed not only with a view to the investigation and 'vetting' of the pedigree of the various Edgar families but also in order that the results of the researches carried out by the Society, or upon its behalf, should become available to the members and associates in permanent form.\n\nIn the period since the Inaugural Meeting in February, 1937, a great deal of data has accumulated. The task of sorting and editing this material has been a considerable one, yet worthwhile because of the interest which so many of us take in the history of the Edgars. The Executive Council of the Society has always kept in mind the fact that it is important that all members should have access to this collection of records. The records of particular branches of the Edgar family will often be of interest to members of other branches because, in some cases, a common origin may be established by an exchange of information.\n\nIf it becomes possible to publish more of the material now available, it is certain that many valuable clues indicating the connections between the various Edgar families will be brought to the notice of those who can best make use of them. It will then be open to all our members to take part in the fascinating task of establishing with certainty from whence their families came and with whom they can claim kinship.\n\nThe records of the family of Edgar formerly settled at Moffat, in Dumfries-shire Scotland, are made available in this, the first issue of the Newsletter.\n\nMembers will see, from a perusal of this genealogy, what can be done to reconstruct the history of any family. Several of these Edgars have contributed the information which has enable the Society to prepare this history of the family and they have thus secured the preservation of many interesting facts for all time. Their industry and co-operation should inspire us to follow a fine example. We may all set out, as some others are already doing, to collect the necessary facts which will enable us to construct our own family histories on similar sound lines.\"\n\nNEW MEMBERS\n\nSince the last General Meeting we have been pleased to welcome the following supporters:\n\nMembers: Mr AD Edgar, Dunedin, NZ; Mrs SL Officer, Toorak, Vic\n\nAssociates: Mrs James Daly, Harrow Vic; Miss Agnes C Edgar, Casterton Vic; Mrs H Hobbs, Horsham Vic; Mrs WA Harris, North Canterbury NZ; Mrs AG Stewart, Hamilton Vic; Mrs JH Soper, Lawrence NZ; Dr RW Edgar, Port Chalmers NZ; Mrs WN Taylor, Cromwell NZ; Mrs Robert Mackie, Gore NZ; Mrs AJ Neil, North Invercargill NZ; Mrs EC Edwards, Casterton Vic; Mrs Margaret Preston, Temora NSW; Mrs C Orr, Lake Cargelligo NSW; Mrs Hugh Howat, Dunedin NZ; Mrs Agnes Edgar, Tatanur NZ; Mrs DE Calvert, Harrow Vic\n\nAll our Members and Associates can assist the growth of the Society by persuading as many members of their families as possible to join. In this way the Society will become more truly representative of the Edgar families and will rapidly reach a position where it can undertake the compilation and publication of other Edgar family histories and will be enabled also to carry out much necessary research work among public records, especially among those located in Scotland.\n\nNews Letter: Members and Associates will receive free copies of all publications which may be issued by the Society from time to time. They will be kept in touch with the operations of the Society by means of the News Letter to be published quarterly from January next. Financial considerations must, of course, govern the size of the News Letter but it is felt that with a lengthening list of subscribers such as we enjoy at present this periodical can become all that could be desired.\n\nAll those interested are cordially invited to make use of the opportunity provided by the News Letter to contribute item of \"Edgarana\" (to coin a description) for use in the sections for Notes and Queries. The Editor will always be pleased to receive any appropriate short article for treatment as a feature of a particular issue.\n\nNotices of Birth, Marriages and Death, is sent for inclusion, will serve to enable relatives to keep the family history up to date and at the same time provide a worth-while permanent record.\n\nSubscriptions: For the convenience of those who may wish to interest others in the work being carried on by the Society of Edgar Families the very reasonable rates of subscription are set out below.\n\nAll those who bear the surname of Edgar, or who are married to an Edgar, or who have any Edgar blood, are eligible for either class of membership.\n\nMembers (per annum)\n\nGentlemen\n\n10/6\n\nLadies\n\n7/6\n\nAssociates (per annum)\n\nGentlemen\n\n7/6\n\nLadies\n\n5/-\n\nPersons resident at a distance of more than 30 miles from Melbourne may be Members of Associates according to choice. Only Members may vote at Meetings. Associates enjoy all other privileges.\n\nNotes\n\nThe Edgar family, of Moffat, records appended hereto are very extensive, embracing as they do a period of about 200 years. Few Australian families have so many members scattered so widely and few are blessed with the longevity which seems to be their special inheritance.\n\nAs has been noted elsewhere, the Moffat Edgars are from Troloss, in Nithsdale and cannot be traced earlier than about 1710. Further research may quite well lead to the construction of a more lengthy pedigree. This is a task which the Society hopes to be accorded sufficient support to undertake in the immediate future.\n\nPerhaps some members of the family will be disappointed to know that the Moffat Edgars, so far as can be established at present, have no right to a coat of arms (which, of course, includes a crest). There is nothing which connects the family to other families of the name in Nithsdale or, more distantly, to the Edgar Lairds of Wedderlie, in Berwickshire.\n\nVoyaging: Mr William H Edgar, our Vice President, who, with Mrs Edgar left Melbourne in May last on a tour of Great Britain, has written some enthusiastic letters describing his stay in the Edgar country in the Scottish Lowlands. One of the main purposed of the visit he paid to Scotland was that he might undertake research on behalf of the Society. Mr Edgar has collected many monumental inscriptions and has abstracted entries from local records which will extend our knowledge of various families of the name.\n\nAt the invitation of Lady Hersey Baird, Mr and Mrs Edgar, with Lt Col J M Edgar and his wife (the Colonel was one of the three founders of this Society) visited Wedderlie, the ancestral home of the Edgars, which still stands near Westruther, Berwickshire. A ramble through the old house, occupied since 1736 by the Lords Blantyre and their connections, was full of interest for the party. The old stone seat high up in a 14th century tower upon which the Edgars sat, suitably armed, to guard their cattle from marauders is still to be seen. The tree from which those guilty of cattle thefts were hanged was pointed out. The house, which boasts a ghost known as the Green Lady, has been much altered in the last two hundred years but most of its more ancient features are still discernable. The coat of arms of the former Lairds can be faintly traced upon one wall.\n\nMr Edgar located two Edgar monuments in Westruther Churchyard and was able to gain access to the Church at Bassendean now owned privately, which is partly ruined but interesting because of old associations with the Edgars.\n\nBefore he leaves Great Britain in October our Vice President will have visited the former homes of the Edgars of Keithock, Peffermyln, Newtoun, and Auchingrammont and will have spent much time in Nithsdale in search of information likely to be helpful to the Society. He will bring back photographs illustrating his interesting tour.\n\nCanadian Experiences: Lt Col J M Edgar who is, as has just been mentioned, also abroad was, while in Canada, the guest of Professor Pelham Edgar of Toronto University. Professor Edgar is a son of the late Sir James Edgar KCMG, the Canadian Statesman, and is an uncle of the present head of the Edgar family formerly Lairds of Keithock. It was to this family that Henry Stewart, Cardinal York early last century, remembering the long service of James Edgar of Keithock as Secretary to his father, the Old Pretender, left a valuable collection of miniatures and other Steward relics. Lt Col Edgar was shown many of these heirlooms while in Toronto and also took the opportunity of inspecting the book concerning the extraordinary adventures of Secretary James Edgar, upon which Lady Edgar, the Professor's mother, was engaged at the time of her death in 1910. For the purposes of this work Lady Edgar secured special permission to examine and copy the letters of James Edgar in the king's Library at Windsor. She was an experienced writer on historical subjects and it is deplorable that the work upon which she laboured so patiently and long is still unpublished although it lacks only the concluding chapters originally planned by the author.\n\nThe Society of Edgar Families hopes to be able to raise sufficient funds later on to secure a typescript copy of this notable MSS.\n\nQueries\n\nRobert Edgar: Has any reader knowledge, additional to that given in the appended records, of Robert Edgar, son of John and Isabella Edgar of Moffat?\n\nQuestionnaire Forms: Will all Members who have retained the questionnaire forms sent to them kindly take a not of such particulars as are still required to complete them and return the forms to the Hon Secretary so that the necessary sketch-pedigrees of their families can be prepared for the Society? The Hon Secretary may be able to suggest how missing details can be obtained.\n\nLimited Offer: A few copies of the News letter, with the records of the Edgars of Moffat appended, are available upon application to the Hon Secretary & Treasurer at 7/6 a copy.\n\nNews Letter Number Two\n\nSociety of Edgar Families\n\nMelbourne, Australia\n\nOld Wedderlie Today\n\nby William H Edgar, JP\n\nSome ten days spent in the delightful surroundings of Westruther must awaken deep feelings of sentiment, romance and racial pride in the heart of an Edgar who is privileged, as I was, to tread the same paths and touch the same walls as were so familiar to the ancient Lairds of Wedderlie for some four centuries.\n\nHere indeed is the \"Cradle of the House of Edgar\". The volume dealings with the Edgar history published by the Grampian Club in 1873 tells us that \"the territory once in the possession of the Edgars of Wedderlie appears to have extended in a broken chain from the West in Berwickshire to the Solway Firth\", and again, \"at the opening of the eighteenth century, Edgars were still numerous in the neighbourhood of Wedderlie, and several families of the name still lived, - some of Lairds, others as \"kindly tenants\" - around the chief of their house.\" Today no Edgars are to be found at Westruther, but a few of that name, mostly in humble positions, are scattered across the Border counties.\n\nThe kindness of Lady Hersey Baird, mother of the young owner of Wedderlie, of Mr Mickle, the lessee of the property at the time of my visit, and of Mr Callen, Minister of Westruther, made possible the viewing of Wedderlie House and permitted access to the parish records and enabled me to tap every possible local source of information.\n\nIt is interesting to note, in view of the long period during which the Edgars remained at Wedderlie and their importance as landowners, that not even a gravestone is left to mark the last resting place of any one of them. One stone in Westruther Old Kirkyard, still legible, records the passing of \"George Edgar in Evlie (Evelaw) who dyed May 9th, 1716, his age 74\". The same grave contains the remains of his wife Margaret Stot and one Jean Hunter. Another stone is erected to the memory of \"Margaret Edgar, the beloved wife of John Boyd, who died at Havering Park, Essex, 28th January 1863, aged 35 years\".\n\nEven the stone referred to in the volume already mentioned \"on which the last resident Edgar Laird has left a memorial of himself\" - is no longer to be seen. An iron-railed enclosure at the back of the kirk is, however, almost certainly the resting place of at least some of the family. This enclosure is supposed to occupy the site of the former Edgar Aisle, which was a small building joined to the kirk and, traditionally, the Edgar burial place. Of the chapel at Wedderlie no trace now exists. It was there, as Sir T D Saunders recorded in his Rivers of Scotland, that the earliest Edgars were buried in a structure of great antiquity; a number of charters yet preserved testifying to its existence.\n\nThe late Mr Silver, of Lauder, a noted antiquary, writing to Major Baird about 1917 says \"the burying place of the Edgars is one of the many mysteries connected with them\".\n\nI wondered what these other mysteries might be as I emerged from the Fourteenth century tower, complete with its Ghost - the \"Green Lady\" she is called - and its five-foot-thick rugged stone walls, now modestly clad in ivy, and gazed across the Lammermuir Hills - surmounted at a few miles distance by the Twinlaw Cairns, the traditional scene of the mighty combat in which those Edgar twins fought for Scot and Saxon, so long ago. The villagers still eagerly tell that ancient tale and the Cairns yet mark the spot; old Wedderlie still stands amid its glorious trees and even Evelaw Tower, another Edgar stronghold, suggests its rugged strength, but, alas, the old Edgar Lairds are no more.\n\nOne likes to think that the efforts of our Society will eventually reveal the heir-male of this ancient and honourable house.\n\nEditorial\n\nThe Society of Edgar Families is most fortunate in having as Vice-President one who is so keenly interested in the history of the Edgars as Mr William H Edgar whose article an old Wedderlie is featured in this issue of the News Letter.\n\nOn his recent visit overseas Mr Edgar spent several weeks in the Scottish Lowlands and has brought back a great quantity of most valuable material relating to the various branches of the Edgar family. He has presented to the Society a number of large-scale ordnance survey maps which will be most useful in solving the difficult topographical problems which some Edgar pedigrees present.\n\nMr Edgar has made many contacts in Scotland which are likely to result in assistance in our researches there and which have already made our work known to a wider circle.\n\nWe look forward to being able to publish further articles from Mr Edgar's pen.\n\nNOTES\n\nMoffat Parish Registers: The Registrar at Moffat, Dumfriesshire, has supplied the following list of the registers now kept in the Register House, Edinburgh. Births, 1723-1819; Marriages and Deaths, 1709-1732; Marriages, 1732-1781; Deaths, 1733-1825; Marriages, 1783-1819; Births and Marriages, 1819-1854; Deaths, 1825-1853.\n\nOrigin on the Moffat Edgars: Mr W H Edgar, Vice President, was told, on his recent visit to Moffat that an old identity, now long since dead, used to say that the Edgars around Moffat came from the original Begotten at Howeslack, which is a farm about 1.5 miles north of Moffat.\n\nMoffat Churchyard: Mr Edgar has presented to the Society a photograph of the oldest Edgar tombstone in Moffat Kirkyard. This records the ancestry of David Edgar, the Australian pioneer pastoralist, quite legibly, from about 1717AD. Prints may be obtained from the Hon Secretary, price 1/6 each.\n\nMr Edgar copied monumental inscriptions on seven tombstones. A pedigree will be compiled incorporating this new material together with further details which are being sought from various sources in Moffat and this will be published in a later edition of the News Letter.\n\nCorrigenda et Addenda:\n\nNo. 1 page 1 for Mrs Agnes Edgar, Tatanur should read Mrs Agnes Edgar, Tapanui\n\nNo. 2 page 9 for James Huston (Rev) born 19th July 1872 should read born 19th August 1872\n\nNo. 2 page 8 further information as follows:\n\nHelen Isobel (Mrs L A Kirk, of Tapanui) died 9th June 1937\n\nNo. 2 page 23 (Sub. Lineage) Miss Jane Scott, of Moffat, died on 8th August 1838.\n\nWedderlie Photographs: Because Wedderlie is rightly regarded as the \"Cradle of the House Edgar\" a number of our members may desire to possess prints of some of the fine photographs of the old home brought back to this country by Mr William Edgar and Lieut Col J M Edgar. Sets of half a dozen different prints may be had for 5/-, post free.\n\nIllustrated Lecture: Arrangements are in hand which will, it is hoped, make it possible for Members and Associates to enjoy the privilege of a lecture by Lieut Col J M Edgar on the subject of his recent visit to Scotland and the Edgar Country. Slides prepared by the lecturer will illustrate his tour. A General Meeting of the Society will precede the lecture.\n\nEDGAR OF WEDDERLIE\n\nAuthorities: Nisbet's Heraldic Plates (1892); Account of the Surname (sic) of Edgar (1873); Genealogical Collections concerning the Scottish House of Edgar (published by a Committee of the Grampian Club, 1873)\n\nThe origin of the Edgar family is obscure but the traditional descent indicates that the Edgars were descendants in the male line from Maldred, brother of King Duncan the First. If such a descent can be accepted then the Edgars form a cadet branch of the Royal House of Scotland.\n\nCrinan, (slain 1045), Lay Abbot of Dunked, a descendant of the Mormaers of Atholl, married Bethoc daughter of King Malcolm the Second (1005-1016). Their younger son:\n\nMaldred, married Algetha, daughter of Ughtred, the Saxon Earl of Northumberland, by his wife Elgiva, daughter of King Ethelred the Second, of England (978-1016). Their son:\n\nCospatrick (1068) Earl of Northumberland. His son:\n\nCospatrick, was created Earl of Dunbar (c 1115). His son:\n\nCospatrick, second Earl of Dunbar, died 11 October 1147. he had issue four sons:\n\n1. Cospatrick, third Earl of Dunbar, ancestor of the later Earls of Dunbar and March.\n\n2. Edward.\n\n3. Edgar, who appears to have adopted the Surname of Edgar; of whom later.\n\n4. Ughtred, the supposed ancestor of the Dundas and Knox families.\n\nEdgar, the son of Cospatrick, second Earl of Dunbar, married a lady with the baptismal name of Alice. They had issue two sons:\n\n1. Patrick.\n\n2. Alexander, of whom below.\n\nAlexander married and had issue at least two sons:\n\n1. Edgar.\n\n2. Walter. This Sir Walter Edgar is mentioned in the Kelso Chartulary. He married and had issue a son:\n\n(a) Patrick. This Sir Patrick Edgar lived at Coldstream. He married, about 1282, Margeta, widow of William, Earl of Home. They are believed to have been the parents of a son:\n\nRichard Edgar, a witness at the second marriage of King Robert, the Bruce; appears to have been the first Edgar Laird of Wedderlie (Reg. Great Seal of Scotland, 1327), an estate formerly in the possession of the Polwarth family. he married Isabella, elder daughter and co heiress of Robert de Rous, Lord of Sanquhar in Galloway. Isabella de Rous was a descendant of William the Lion, King of Scotland and her children were thus nearly related to the competitors for the Scottish Crown. Richard and Isabella Edgar had issue five sons:\n\n1. Richard; renounced succession to Wedderlie in favour of his younger brother Robert (Reg. Seal of Scotland, 1376). He is believed to have settled in Galloway.\n\n2. Robert, second of Wedderlie, of whom later.\n\n3. Douenald (Donald). Settled in Galloway.\n\n4. Dungal, Settled in Galloway.\n\n5. Edgar, only once mentioned in old documents, and often overlooked.\n\n(to be continued)\n\nNOTE: This is a reprint of News Letter number Two which was first published for the Society of Edgar Families in January 1939.\n\nI Trentham-Edgar FSAG, Hon Secretary and Treasurer of the Society of Edgar Families, at 75A Fitzroy Street, Melbourne; 2nd March 1940\n\nSOCIETY OF EDGAR FAMILIES\n\nLecture and Annual Meeting\n\nA cordial invitation is extended to all bearers of the EDGAR surname and their immediate relatives, to attend the Third Annual Meeting of the Society of Edgar Families which will take place at 8.00pm (sharp), Wednesday 8 March, 1939 in Room 110, Railways Institute, Railway Buildings, Flinders Street, Melbourne.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Meeting, Lieut Col J M Edgar, who recently returned from a tour abroad will deliver an Illustrated Lecture.\n\nThe Lecturer explored the Edgar country in Scotland and while in Canada made contact with the ancient family of Keithock Edgars who were so closely associated with Bonnie Price Charlie. He brought back many curious tales and legends concerning the Edgars and their former extensive estates, together with photographs of historic places in Edgar family history. It is interesting to know that the \"Screen\" which will be used for the projection of photographs at the Lecture is actually a sheet which was spun and woven over a century ago by a lady of the Edgar family.\n\nDO YOU KNOW THAT:\n\nThe Society of Edgar Families has entered upon its third year?\n\nEvery year so far has seen our membership up 100%\n\nThere are members of the Society all over Australian and in Great Britain, Canada and New Zealand?\n\nCopies of the Society's quarterly publication, the News Letter, which is free to Members and Associates is accepted for filing by all the leading National and State Libraries throughout the English speaking world?\n\nThe Society has permanently recorded many Edgar pedigrees and has acquired a collection of many thousands of Edgar references which is being continually built up.\n\nNews Letter Number Three\n\nSociety of Edgar Families\n\nMelbourne, Australia\n\nThe Twinlaw Cairns, near Wedderlie\n\nby William H Edgar\n\nNot the least of the romantic legends associated with the Scottish House of Edgar is that of the Twinlaw Cairns, a story told in 20 verses by some unknown bard about 200 years ago.\n\nToday the twin cairns stand boldly silhouetted on top of the bleak but wild and picturesque moor land of the Lammermuir Hills - that part of Scotland immortalised by Sir Walter Scott and breathing history from every wind-swept flank.\n\nThe tale is said to be common to the folk lore of most countries in some similar form but to an Edgar standing between the two monuments, as the sun sinks below the hills, it is not difficult to watch them fade away and to see two misty figures of fine powerful young men take their place, one the beloved adopted son of the old Saxon who had stolen the boy when little more than a babe on a raid some 20 years before, and now had learnt to love him as his own.\n\nWhat were the old man's thoughts, as on this occasion the two small armies - raiding Saxon and defending Scot - decided to settle the issue by single combat, the honour going on the Saxon's side to the old man's adopted son and that of the Scots to young Edgar, son of the old Scottish chief?\n\nThis mist of centuries rolls away and we see the two armies of sturdy, fearless men facing each other, the chiefs conferring, the two chosen men stepping forward, each anxious and proud to defend his national honour with his life.\n\nWord is given, the fight begins, blow for blow, parry for parry; save the crash of steel on shield and quick drawn breath no sound is heard. Two armies stand and watch in silence as the two young giants engage to the death.\n\nBlood in flowing now from Saxon and Scot but still they fight on; a murmur runs through the ranks of watching men, men who live by feats of arms.\n\nAt last a shout \"The Saxon falls!\" Still fighting the young Saxon, weak with loss of blood, sinks to his knees, then down; it is the end. The old Saxon, heartbroken hastens forward, \"He's dead\" he cried, \"the bravest youth ever spring from Edgar's line\".\n\nAghast, the old Scottish chief now knows the fallen Saxon for his lost son and crying \"My son, my son\" he falls to rise no more.\n\nYoung Edgar, mortally wounded, embraces his father and his brother, tears the bandages from his wounds and expires beside their bodies.\n\nThe villagers still tell the story and describe how the two armies formed a long line from the scene of battle to a burn and passed from hand to hand the stones for the two cairns.\n\nIn recent years the late Lady John Montague Douglas Scott had a cairn removed and an excavation made to learn if any relic lay below, but the search was fruitless and it is doubtless due to her interested that the two re-erected cairns today stand some 75 yards apart, about 10 feet high, un-cemented, but well built in ** a small tower some 6 feet in diameter, recessed to provide a seat for those who would sit and watch while the evening mist creeps up the Lammermuirs and, who knows? Two ghostly armies may perhaps be seen passing down the hillside laid a lasting memorial to two brave men.\n\nEditorial\n\nSo that the material published in the News Letter may become known as widely as possible and be permanently preserved in a number of centres, complimentary copies have been presented to the following libraries:\n\nNational Library, Canberra FCT; Mitchell Library, Sydney; Library of the Society of Australian Genealogists, Sydney; Victorian Public Library, Melbourne; British Museum Library, London; Library of the Society of Genealogists, London; Scottish National Library, Edinburgh; Library of Congress, Washington, USA.\n\nAll these institutions will continue to receive all the genealogical publications of the Society.\n\nNOTES\n\nMoffat Edgars: Correspondence entered into by the Hon Secretary and members of the Edgar of Moffat family who live in Scotland is still being carried on. The material being collected is being reserved for publication at a later date.\n\nCanadian (Keithock) Edgars: James Keithock Edgar, of Toronto, the representatives of the Edgar Lairds of Keithock and a nephew of Professor Pelham Edgar, FCRS has forwarded a typescript of nearly 200 pages, suitably bound, which represents the labours of his late grandmother, Lady Edgar, in the Royal Library of Windsor Castle. Lady Edgar's considerable experience in historical research enabled her to trace the letters of James Edgar (of the Keithock family), Secretary of State to \"James III\" the Old Pretender, and transcribe them. It was her intention to publish this interesting collection but death claimed her before the task was done. The letters were written to the Secretary's nephew, the Laird of Keithock, and they are the more interesting because of the fact the Keithock's replies are included in the collection.\n\nOnly special consideration has obtained for us the temporary custody of Lady Edgar's unpublished typescript which must soon be returned to Canada and the Executive Council of the Society has, for some time, been earnestly considering what method of copying these letters would be the least expensive and yet satisfactory. It is most desirable, if possible, that all our members should have a copy of this collection of letters.\n\nIf it can be arranged a full history of the Keithock Edgars will be issued with the Jacobite letters. At present however the question of raising the necessary funds to finance the publication of this material is receiving earnest consideration.\n\nOffers of assistance and donations towards the cost should be sent to the Hon Secretary.\n\nSECOND ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\n\nThere was a good attendance of Members and Associates at the Annual General Meeting on 8th March, 1939 at the Railways Institute Rooms. In the absence of the President, the Hon W H Edgar, MLC, who was prevented from attending by the illness of Mrs Edgar, the Vice President, Mr William H Edgar, took the Chair. The retiring Office-bearers were all re-elected.\n\nLt Col JM Edgar, with the aid of a projector, delivered a delightful lecture in which he told us of his visit to Toronto and his meeting there with the Keithock Edgars who own many most valuable family relics and paintings. Professor Pelham Edgar and his nephew, the titular Laird of Keithock \"were very interested in the work of the Society\" said Colonel Edgar, \"and were keen to have anything which we might publish from time to time\". Lt Col Edgar was shown the Chair which Sir James David Edgar, KCMG occupied from 1896-1899 as Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons.\n\nAt Westruther, in Berwickshire, Colonel Edgar was joined by our Vice President, Mr William H Edgar, and with their respective ladies, a happy re-union was enjoyed on the very threshold of Wedderlie itself. With the Colonel's son Mr Allan Edgar (who has since joined the RAF) making a third, the male members of the party explored the Westruther Churchyard and engaged in excavation work which might have been expected to yield at least the long lost family vault, but didn't. After the Colonel's departure our Vice President remained in the Wedderlie district for more than a week for the purpose of \"pumping the old identities\" as he put it. He was able to collect quite a number of worth while notes for our files.\n\nLt Col Edgar made his references to the Keithock Lairds very clear to his audience by means of a carefully prepared pedigree which he projected on the screen.\n\nA vote of thanks to the lecturer was moved and was seconded by acclamation.\n\nCorrigenda et Addenda\n\nNo 2 page 27, Edgar of Wedderlie for \"Brinan\" read Crinan\"\n\nNo 2 page 27, Edgar of Wedderlie (Sub Authorities) after \"Account of the Surname of Edgar, (1873)\" read \"by J H Lawrence-Archer\"\n\nObituary\n\nMr Walter Birmingham Edgar (born 23 March 1856, at Pine Hills Station, Harrow, Vic), third son of David Edgar, the pioneer pastoralist, died at Portland, Vic on 22 February, 1939. (see News Letter No 1, page 16). Mr Edgar disposed of the Pine Hills estate to the late Mr R Ellis, in 1936 and had, since that time, visited England with Mrs White, his daughter.\n\nAlthough it is now just four months more than a century since David Edgar landed from Scotland, his eldest son Mr John Thomas Edgar, formerly of Kadnook Station, still survives as does his daughter Miss Isabella Edgar, of Babba Mia Estate, Harrow. The former, with Mrs Edgar attended the inaugural meeting of this Society and still retains a keen interest in its work.\n\nEdgar of Wedderlie (Part Two)\n\nRobert Edgar, 2nd Laird of Wedderlie, married ; their son,\n\nJohn Edgar had a Charter of confirmation of the resignation of the Wedderlie estates in favour of his father, (circa 1384).

It is presumed that he stood in the relationship of a son to John Edgar (above) but it should be recognised that the succession to Wedderlie in the 15th and 16th centuries is still obscure.\n\nRobert Edgar, 5th Laird. He had a grant of the ward and marriage of William Redpath, 16th November 1497. Supposed by most authorities to have been a son of Adam Edgar, (above). Lawrence-Archer suggests that he may have been a brother of George Edgar, of Swinton, or a nephew of Adam Edgar.\n\nRobert Edgar. He was a witness to a Charter by Gilbert Grierson, of Dalton to John Lindsay, the younger, of Barclay, 2nd December, 1552. Lawrence-Archer states that this Laird's name was Richard, who married Ailsone , (her Will proved at Lauder, 1564). Robert, (as given by Nisbet, 1892) or Richard, had issue as follows:\n\n1. Robert, circa 1585-1586\n\n2. James, ancestor of the Edgars of Grueldykes (Dunse)\n\n3. Oliver, ancestor of the Edgars of Newtoun de Birgham, (Eccles-Newton), Berwickshire\n\n4. John.

Space permits no lengthy quotation, but after painting out the circumstances in which Sir Richard Edgar stood at that time and his relationship with Bruce, he graphically describes what may have taken place at the slaughter of Sir John Comyn at the high altar of the church in Dumfries in February 1305-1306.\n\n\"Hastening with his retainers on that cold morning in February 1306 to the castle of Loshmaben to ascertain the cause of the Bruce's sudden return from the English Court, we may readily picture the sombre Knight of Wedderlie, Lord of Nithsdale, in earnest consultation with the hero and his brother on the urgency of the occasion There stands the knight in his linked coat of mail, plated gauntlets and triangular shield suspended round his neck. It is sable and bears the white lion rampant of Dunbar with the legend \"Salutem disponit Deus.\" His helmet of steel, conical and covered with a hood and collar of mail, does not yet bear a crest. From his hauberk downwards, his stalwart limbs are shoated in flexible armour. On one side, secured by the knightly belt, is a long, broad falchion and on the other is a short dagger.\n\nHis black surcoat is embroidered with his armorial insignia and contrasts strongly with those of his companions.\n\nDeeply attentive to the Bruce's recital of his wrongs and account of the deceit of \"Longshape\" (the injustice of whose pretensions must have been so familiar) and while the illustrious brothers earnestly debated the question and yet hesitated to incur the peril of renouncing their enforced allegiance, the taciturn knight, deeply impressed with the importance of a speedy decision, may have turned the scale by involuntarily clutching his dagger and muttering with deep emotion \"Maun do it.\"\n\nOr Edgar, at first horror stricken and standing alone, may have been suddenly struck (since the deed could not he undone) with the duty of throwing all his energies into the cause of the future King, and already penitent friend, and, with the fierce exclamation \"Maun dir it\" (although abhorrent of murder), may have rushed into the church and joined the fray.\n\nAt all events, we know sufficient to be assured that, after the slaughter of the Red Comyn, Sir Richard Edgar was regarded with especial consideration by the Bruce.\"\n\nThe truth will never be known, but Lawrence-Archer says there is every reason to believe that the motto and crest of the family \"originated during the heroic struggle of Robert the Bruce,\" and we are indebted to him for throwing much light on the age and probable origin of the armoury of the Edgars of Wedderlie.\n\nNOTES\n\nLife Members: It was resolved at the Meeting of the Executive Council which took place on 17th May 1939, that the following persons should be admitted to the Society as Life Members:\n\nPelham Edgar, FRSC, PhD, BA, Professor of English Literature at the University of Toronto, Canada\n\nJames Keithock Edgar, of Toronto, Canada, Chief of the House of Keithock\n\nWe delight to honour both these gentlemen for the real interest they have taken in the work of the Society of Edgar Families, and for the great assistance which they continue to give in the preparation of a full history of the Keithock Edgars.\n\nJacobite Letters: Lieut-Col JM Edgar was able to arrange for the photographing by a miniature camera of the notable collection of Edgar letters of the Jacobite period which was loaned to us by Mr JK Edgar of Toronto. The file will be cared for by the Hon Secretary until such time as it becomes possible to publish the letters in the News Letter. Lieut-Col Edgar has presented the films to the Society free of cost and his most generous action is another and striking proof of his interest in our work.\n\nBadges: Mrs Keith Nicholson has made the interesting suggestion that a special badge be made for sale to Members and Associates. Enquiries made so far seem to suggest that there would be considerable support for the idea. It would be necessary to ensure that the badge would be acquired by all those who would be eligible to wear it.\n\nThe cost of a suitable badge of neat design would approximate 2/6. All those who would like to have a visible token indicating their membership of the family Society should advise the Hon Secretary (I Trentham-Edgar, 75 Fitzroy Street, St Kilda, Melbourne S2) by letter. No money should be forwarded pending a further announcement in the News Letter.\n\nPicnic Outing: Members, Associates and their families will be invited to attend a picnic outing at a place within easy reach of Melbourne when the weather is warmer. Private transport will be provided without charge where necessary. This outing should prove a happy one and all who can do so should attend, so that the various families of Edgar may become better acquainted. Details will be announced at a later date.\n\nPhotographs: Although stocks of views of Wedderlie House have been exhausted, two difference views of the Twinlaw Cairns (see Mr William H Edgar's interesting article in the May issue of the News Letter) are available at 9d each; postage 2d.\n\nAt a later time it is hoped to offer prints of other historic Edgar homes - Keithock, Peffermiln, Elshieshields and Evelaw.\n\nEdgars in the Australian Imperial Forces  Victoria\n\nThe Secretary to the Trustees of the Shrine of Remembrance, Melbourne, has kindly supplied the following list of Edgars who served in the Great War.

The Edgars may look with interest on the Dovenald who, still a youth, was killed when fighting as one of the leaders of the \"Wild Scots of Galloway\" at the Battle of the Standard in 1138, when they lost heavily. According to the Historian of Sanquhar, he was one of the three grandsons of a Scoto-Irish chief called Dunegal of Stranith, who received Sanquhar. A son named Edgar appears in the reign of William the Lion, and it may not be improbably that David interested himself in the family of one of the leaders, victims of that battle, for which he was responsible\".\n\nSource: \"anglo-Norman Peaceful Invasion of Scotland, 1057-1200, Origin of Great Scottish Families: 91922) by James Coutts\n\nEdgars in Parliament\n\nAlexander Edgar, provost; Haddington 1696-1702, 1703-1707\n\nEdward Edgar, merchant; Edinburgh, 1640-1641; 1646-1647\n\nJohn Edgar of Wedderlie; Berwickshire, 1681-1682; son of John Edgar of Wedderlie\n\nSource: from Members of Parliament - Scotland, 1357-1882, by Joseph Foster, 1882\n\nIn the Parliament on Monday, 4th November 1706, Alexander Edgar voted with the No's on a division taken on the religious consequences of the Union of the two countries - England and Scotland.\n\nSource: from History of the Union, Daniel Defoe (1709) reprinted in part in the Dundee Magazine, February 1799\n\nSubscription Rates\n\nFor the convenience of those desiring to renew their membership of the Society, we set out the rates again.

On 25 July 1736, John Edgar presented a handsome Bible to the church and congregation of Westruther to mark the departure of the Edgars from the parish. This Bible was still (1938) in use, but the Laird's inscription in it has been removed by some vandal. John Edgar married Mary, dau of George Home of Chirnside. They had issue:\n\n1.

He was appointed Rear Admiral of the Red on 20 February 1799, and after living for some years at Great Yarmouth he died without male issue at Bedford Street, Bedford Square, London, on 20 February 1817. (Will, 123 Effingham, Perog Ct of Canterbury). Admiral Edgar married, in January 1773, Sophia Margaret, (d. 21 January 1807, aet 47), dau of James Johnstone, MD RN. They had an only child:\n\n1. Sophia Bethia Edgar (d. 1856). She married firstly, in 1806, Robert Campbell, Captain RN; and secondly in 1819, Alexander Tait LL.D of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. There was issue only of the first marriage, (1) William Huntly *1808-1844). Captain, 20th Regiment; (2) Robert Edgar; and two daughters, (1) Sophia, married major Starkey, EICS, (2) Marguerite, married JJ Russell\n\nUpon the death of Rear Admiral Alexander Edgar in 1817, Thomas Edgar, at that time head of the Edgars of Keithock, made application to the Lord Lyon for recognition as the head of the Wedderlie family. It is not now known what proofs Mr Edgar offered in support of his claim, but as he was deeply interested in the history of the Edgars, it is likely that he possessed some evidence illustrating the connection between the Wedderlie and the Keithock Edgars. Unfortunately, upon Mr Edgar's death on 7 September 1831, his extensive genealogical collections were neglected and when his brother, James Edgar, came to examine them about a year later, he found that most of the papers had been destroyed by the depredation of mice.\n\nNews Letter Number Five\n\nSociety of Edgar Families\n\nMelbourne, Australia\n\nSir Edward Mackay Edgar, Baronet, the \"Man with a Load of Millions\" died in London on October 7, 1934. Broken in health and utterly disillusioned, Sir Edward Edgar passed away in a tiny cottage in the Buckinghamshire Village of Chalfont St Giles, famous for its association with John Milton. There was a time when he was the biggest and bravest gambler in the City of London. He earned the nick-name of the \"Man with the Load of Millions\". Any venture which he promoted was safe for a million pounds, if the amount was needed. Yet he faces two bankruptcies and died in relative poverty.\n\nA Canadian by birth, he made his first fortune by organising big hydro-electric combines. Coming to London, he carried through even larger deals in cotton, iron and steel, and shipbuilding, in association with the financial house of Sperling and Company. But a day came when his luck turned, and in 1925 he was unexpectantly declared bankrupt, his liabilities being 80,000 pounds. Sperling and Company helped him to pay his debts, but the shock to his credit proved too great. henceforward he was a spent force. He was obliged to give up his home in Park Lane, and his country house, Merton Hall, Thetford. In 1931 he filed a petition in bankruptcy for the second time. After that time he lived very quietly at Chalfont St Giles, more or less forgotten by the City associates who followed his financial lead so eagerly, and even by those who used to enjoy his generous hospitality. Sir Edward said of the City of London in a moment of insight \"If you win you're marvellous, and you will have friends standing in a queue a mile long. If you lose, it means facing the punishment - or death.\"\n\nThis prophetic pronouncement was made by Edgar in 1927, when he learned that his one time friend and associate \"Jimmy\" White, had poisoned himself. James White and \"Mike\" Edgar were both struggling to resuscitate waning fortunes, and they came into conflict over British controlled oilfields. White had large holdings, but was desperately in need of money for other projects. On a sudden, Edgar, who had seemed to be helping White to keep up the price of the shares, changed his tactics. He unloaded all his shared and White could not raise another pound on his own holdings owing to the depreciated price. White went down to his country house and put a pad soaked in chloroform over his face. \"Mike\" Edgar was fool enough to boast of his victory to a party of journalists in his flat in Mount Street, \"It was a two years battle between \"Jimmy\" White and myself,\" he said. \"And the one to lose was \"Jimmy! It was rotten fighting an old friend, but it wasn't my fault. I didn't make the rules of the game.\"\n\nThe City of London didn't forget this ill-advised boasting, and it did not forget Edgar. For him finance was always a game, as he said on another occasion, \"the greatest game in the world, this fighting with millions at stake.\" As a big gambler, he will long be remembered, but he did no real service in return for the immense sums of money which he took from the public and his influence was vicious, even if he did play the game of finance within the riles as he understood them. He showered costly gifts upon his friends, and his hospitality was unbounded, but he lacked the qualities which make for abiding success, even in financial juggling. His first big error was made early in the world war, when he sold out his holdings in the hydro-electric companies, which he really understood. They finally appreciated to about 4,000,000 pounds but he did not benefit. In the post-war boom he made more than one fortune, but he suffered huge losses. He was a leading figure in a syndicate which amalgamated cotton spinning companies, and his firm issued 3,000,000 pounds worth of debentures for Workman, Clark, and Company, of Belfast. But Edgar was mixed up in a deal which involved the purchase of Baldwins Ltd, for 3 pounds a share in cash. It plunged him and Sperling and Company into long and expensive litigation, in the course of which 845,000 pounds damages were paid to Baldwins. Mackay Edgar was a good shot, a fair tennis player, and a moderately successful owner of race horses. His only son was killed in a motor accident, so there was no heir to the baronetcy which he received in the height of his power.\n\nSource: The Argus, Melbourne, 10 November 1934\n\nSir Edward Mackay Edgar was a son of Frank Edgar, of Montreal, Canada, and was born 27 February 1876.

It was decided to carry on the full work of the Society for the time being. The Executive Council believes that it is in the national interest that as little dislocation as possible should occur in the affairs of the individuals and associations. The slogan \"Business as Usual\" seems the best one for the present. If necessary, further decisions will be taken at a later date.\n\nGeneral Meeting: The next General Meeting will take place on Tuesday evening 24 October. Details will be advised by circular.\n\nKeithock Edgars: Further large collections of material relating to the Edgar Lairds of Keithock have come forward from Canada. The genealogy of the family is nearing completion, but it is possible that the declaration of war may make it necessary to hold up publication for some time.\n\nMr JK Edgar, of Toronto (Life Member) has loaned a number of excellent photographs of Keithock House, the seat of the Edgars in Forfarshire, Scotland.

Negotiations are now in hand which should result in an arrangement whereby all New Zealand subscriptions shall be invested in the Dominion until such time as the present difficulties are resolved.\n\nA statement of the new position will be made in the January issue of the News Letter. Remittances may still be made by International Money Order but a declaration may be required from the sender.\n\nEdgar of Longtown: The history of the Edgar family, formerly of Longtown, Cumberland and Riddings, will be appended to the next issue of the News Letter.

This decision was made because it was desirable to include the complete history of the Edgars of Riddings in this issue. Our readers will appreciate the importance of this record and will not regret the use made of the space usually devoted to less important items.\n\nLawrence-Archer's Book\n\nEver since the foundation of the Society of Edgar Families, three years ago, strenuous efforts have been made by members of the Executive Council to obtain a copy of Lawrence-Archer's book on the Surname of Edgar which was published privately in 1873. The work is a most important one and is now extremely rare.\n\nNone of the large retail booksellers in Great Britain who were approached were able to locate a copy for us, and it seemed that the Society would have to remain in ignorance of Lawrence-Archer's contribution to the published history of the family. However, our member, Mr James Keithock Edgar, of Toronto, Canada, was aware of our disappointment and he, with the wonderful assistance of his wife, copied out the whole of Lawrence-Archer's work, carefully checked the copy, and forwarded it to Melbourne by registered mail. The copy is a fine production and is enhanced by the copies of the pedigrees in the original book and Mrs Edgar's pencil sketches of the original illustrations. The task which Mr and Mrs Edgar have completed would have daunted most of us, and we must all admire such patience. We greatly appreciate the thoughtful kindness behind their fine action, and extend our grateful thanks.\n\nNew Zealand Members: Enquiries made for us in New Zealand since our last issue indicate that subscriptions may still be remitted to Australia by money order, although a declaration may be required by the Post Office. Should any of our members experience special difficulty in forwarding subscriptions, the Hon Secretary should be advised so that another arrangement can be made.\n\nAnnual General Meeting: The third Annual General Meeting will take place on 5 march 1940, in Room 110, Railways Institute Building, Flinders Street, Melbourne. One of the subjects listed for discussion is a proposal by Mrs Keith Nicholson at the Meeting of the Executive Council on 18 January 1940, that the Society make plans to provide comforts for Edgars who are giving their services for their King and Country.\n\nEdgar of Moffat\n\n(see NL No.1, pp4a-24; No.5, p43)\n\nDAVID EDGAR, a younger brother of John Edgar (1778-1868) of Moffat, Dumfries-shire (see NL No.1, p23), died at Millgreen, Moffat, 17 August 1859, aet 73.

Monumental Inscriptions in Moffat Kirkyard have confirmed several relationships, and supplied a number of dates. The ages given, from the same source, are in some cases likely to be wrong. It cannot be said that the order of aenisrity is correct or that the names of all children of the various marriages are recorded. The genealogy as given above is presented as a basis for further research.\n\nTwo [sic] Monumental Inscriptions at Moffat which relate to Edgars as yet unidentified are given:\n\n1.

Family tradition asserts that he served a draper in Longtown in his early youth. When still a lad, he set out on foot for London, with a letter of introduction to Mr Swan (d. 26 November 1821), a London draper with a small shop in Ludgate Hill. There he found congenial employment, and when it was decided to open a branch shop in Piccadilly, young Edgar was admitted to partnership and given charge of the new undertaking. Swan died within a few years, but William Edgar, possessed of an unusual aptitude for business, rapidly made the name of Swan and Edgar known throughout London, and indeed, throughout Great Britain. He was greatly assisted in the expansion of his undertaking by the financial assistance which his cousin, David Edgar, of Longtown, gave him. At his death, he left one of the most substantial fortunes which had, up until that time, been amassed by any person engaged in the soft goods trade. He died at his mansion home, Eagle House, Clapham Common, Surrey, on 25 September 1869, and was, until he disposed of it to the Duke of Buccleuch in 1872, the owner of a shooting box called Kirklands, which he built in 1850, at Closeburn, Dumfries-shire, Scotland. He was buried in the family vault in Norwood Cemetery. Will dated 21 February 1867. Estate sworn at under 300,000 pounds.\n\nWilliam Edgar married Frances Heyburn, daughter of George Heyburn (d. 17 December 1834, aet 64), by his wife, nee Skinner (1769-1851). He was actively associated with the construction of Old Waterloo Bridge and Highgate Archway. Mrs Edgar died at Eagle House, on 19 February 1889, aged 78 years. They had issue two sons and three daughters:\n\nI. William Schindler, born 17 March 1824, of whom presently\n\nII. George Henryk born in 1826, probably at East Hill, Wandsworth, London.

He was born 26 February 1825 and died at his seat, Rousdon, Devon, 26 August 1989. Lady Peek died 2 May 1884. They had issue an only child - Sir Cuthbert Edgar Peek, 2nd Baronet, born 30 January 1855.

He was educated at Totteridge. Upon his father's death he became proprietor of the family business. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace and resided at Coombe Warren, a fine Gothic mansion (sold in June 1884) at Kingston Hill, Kingston-on-Thames, Surrey. He died on 18 August 1885.\n\nWilliam Schindler Edgar married on 20 March 1850, at St Peter's Church, Belper, Derbyshire, Eleanor, daughter of Thomas Ingle, solicitor, of Belper and Derby.\n\nMrs Edgar died on 18 July 1897, aged 89 years, at 51 Cavendish Road, Clapham Common.

Ursula Edith, b. 13 March 1909\n\nHerbert Edgar, born 8 October 1864, at Hollywood, Clapham Common. He received his education at Windlesham House, Brighton, and at Uppingham. For a time he joined the family business. He served in the HAC as a Driver. About 1885 he came to Melbourne, Australia, in the ship \"Cusco\" to go on the pastoral property, Greenhills Station, Keilor Plains, which was owned by cousins of his mother, William Brown, Ingle Brown and Walter Brown. Herbert Edgar subsequently went to Bargrove, South Gippsland, to a property owned by Ernest Harriss, who had married his wife's sister, Isabella Mair.\n\nHerbert Edgar married at Brighton Beach, Victoria, on 30 October 1889, Helen, daughter (and in her issue, co-heiress) of Lieut Colonel William Mair, of Mair Street, Brighton Beach.\n\n(William Mair was born in Glasgow, on 31 August 1806, and died at Myora, South Gippsland, on 15 January 1904. He was a son of Hugh Mair, Captain 42nd Highlanders, who served under Abercrombie at Alexandra and also at Waterloo. William Mair held the following appointments: Marshall of St Lucia, 25 June 1830; Ensign 99th Regt. 26 November 1830 to October 1836; Lieut 1st West India Regt 23 April 1836; Lieut 99th Regt 29 July 1836; Paymaster, 99th Regt and Adjutant and Paymaster of NSW Mounted Police, 1842; Commander Port Phillip Mounted Police, 1846 to 1849; Commissioner of Disputed Boundaries, Gippsland District, 1849; Police Magistrate, Western District, 1849; Gold Commissioner and Police Magistrate for Buninyong and Ballarat, 1 September 1851, for four months (Mair Street, Ballarat); Commander Gold Fields Mounted Police, 1851 to 1853; Captain 99th Regt 7 July 1854; Paymaster and Commissioner of Police of Victoria, 1853 to 1872, when he retired on a pension.

Lieut Colonel Mair arrived at Port Jackson on 22 March 1842 in the ship \"Richard Webb\" having earlier, 126 days out from Dublin, handed over to the Hobart Town penal authorities, his charge of 200 convicts. Lieut Colonel Mair was primarily responsible for the creation of the Moorabbin Roads Board and was chairman of the Board for nearly five years. He married Catherine Lyons, of Sydney, NSW.)\n\nHerbert Edgar returned to England about 1896. His death occurred at Maidstone, Kent, on 2 September 1905.\n\nMrs Edgar married secondly, Charles Maffey (deceased) of Melbourne.\n\nHerbert and Helen Edgar had issue an only child:\n\nI. William Herbert, born at Melbourne, 23 May 1891. Educated at Maidstone Grammar School, Kent, England. Returned to Australia with his mother in 1908. Until 1924 he farmed property at Myora and Woodleigh, Gippsland. He was, for some time, a member of the Phillip Island and Woolami Shire Council, and was President in the Shire's Jubilee Year, 1924. From 1924 until 1935, Mr Edgar was the proprietor of a motor garage at San Remo, Victoria. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace, 29 May 1934. A convenor of the inaugural Meeting of the Society of Edgar Families on 24 February 1937. Elected first President of the Society. Now Vice-President of the Society, and Assistant Hon Secretary. Mr Edgar has several times visited Great Britain, and, in 1932, and 1938, undertook pilgrimages to the Edgar districts of Scotland. Mr Edgar was appointed Air Raid Precautions Instructor, 1939, and Post Administrative Officer, 1940.\n\nWilliam Herbert Edgar married on 18 February 1914, at the Australian Church, Melbourne, Elsa Margaret, daughter of Henry Keeble Aird, of Caulfield, Melbourne, and formerly of Nalong Station, near the border of Victoria and South Australia.

Educated at Box Hill Grammar School, Victoria.\n\nNOTE: The Lineage of William Edgar (1791-1869) will be published at a later date.\n\nEdited for the Society of Edgar Families by I Trentham-Edgar\n\nSOME SIDELIGHTS ON THE HISTORY OF THE EDGAR FAMILY\n\nWalter Scott, second Laird of Harden, who died in 1629, was a famous character in the Lowlands in his day and was known far and wide as \"Auld Wat\". He was twice married, first to Mary Scott (\"the Flower of the Yarrow\"), daughter of Philip Scott, of Dryhope, and afterwards to Margaret Edgar, daughter of the Laird of Wedderlie. By his first wife he had a son who was ancestor to Sir Walter Scott Bt, the famous novelist.\n\n\"Auld Wat's\" only child by Margaret Edgar was named after her mother and became the wife of David Pringle, younger of Gallasheils. Upon his death she married Sir William Macdougall, of Mackerston.\n\nJohn Edgar, Laird of Wedderlie, married (Marr. Contract C.1619) Elizabeth, daughter of William, first Lord Cranstoun and had issue. The Cranstoun peerage is considered to be dormant, an heir not having been found. By the terms of the remainder to the patent the descendants of the marriage of John and Elizabeth Edgar would stand in the line of succession.\n\nConsult \"Complete Peerage\", second edition\n\nTHIRD ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF THE SOCIETY OF EDGAR FAMILIES\n\nA cordial invitation is extended to Members and Associates of the Society of Edgar Families to attend the Third Annual General Meeting which will take place at 8.00pm on Tuesday 5 March 1940 in Room 110, Railways Institute, Flinders Street, Melbourne (take the lift to the Third Floor).\n\nBusiness:\n\nElection of Officers\n\nAnnual Report\n\nThe President, the Honourable WH Edgar MP, has signified that he will take the Chair if he finds it possible to be in Melbourne on the night of the Meeting.\n\nHon Secretary: I Trentham-Edgar FSAG\n\nTelephone: Windsor 3369\n\n75a Fitzroy Street, St Kilda S2\n\nNews Letter Number Seven\n\nSociety of Edgar Families\n\nMelbourne, Australia\n\nThird Annual Report\n\nWe have come together once more, this time to celebrate the third birthday of the Society. The three years gone by have been a time of achievement. We have made progress which it will be a pleasant duty to accelerate in this difficult time of national emergency.\n\nThe Society's work and influence did not stop on the 3 September 1939; indeed, our task of welding the Edgars together into one body had found a further justification. All the British peoples need unity, and any organisation which serves to keep the citizens of the sister democracies together is one worth supporting.\n\nWe have entered upon our new year with a substantial monetary surplus - for the first time. That we are serving the interests of our Members and Associates satisfactorily is shown by the splendid loyalty of our old members and the eagerness with which others continue to join our ranks. If our financial position remains healthy, I feel that we should seek to make contact with every bearer of the surname whose address we can obtain from directories and other reference books. Our work deserves to be more widely known and to that end we must advertise the Society as widely as possible. This can be done most effectively by the publication of attractive booklets and leaflets which would clearly indicate to a recipient the advantages of membership of the Society.\n\nThrough the work of the Vice-President, we have been able to acquire, at a reasonable price, a full range of stationery supplies sufficient to last the Society for about three years at the present rate of consumption. As it is likely that the continuance of the war will force a rise in current prices, this action may be the means of saving the Society an appreciable sum.\n\nOne of the real highlights of the year has been the wonderful co-operation which we have had from our honorary member in Toronto, Canada - Mr James Keithock Edgar. Mr Edgar, capably aided by his wife, has copied for our library the whole of Lawrence-Archer's authoritative book, published in 1873, on the Edgar family. This work is extremely rare and the many efforts made by this Society to obtain a copy had proved unavailing; but now, thanks to our Canadian friends, both of them young people, we are no longer obliged to work without this indispensable reference book.\n\nThe News Letter continues to justify its publication and already more than fifty pages of Edgar material has been made available to our members. Now that we have our own duplicating machine, it should be possible to average at least twenty-five pages a year. This figure may be raised by some issues having appended to them the history of particular families. The full family history of the Keithock Edgars has now been completed, but publication will be delayed until the manuscript can be safely mailed to Canada for approval. Efforts are now being made to interest the branch of the Keithock family which settled in New Jersey, about 1719, in this work. It is hoped that the co-operation of some of the members of this United States family will lead to the publication of the history of their interesting branch. The late General CG Edgar, of Detroit, USA, left a valuable collection of Edgar records and relics at his death a few years ago.\n\nGeneral Edgar was a keen student of genealogy and, being a wealthy man, he was able to acquire many family treasures. One wing of his summer residence on the shores of one of the northern lakes was constructed to the exact plan of Old Keithock, in Scotland - once the home of the General's ancestor, Thomas Edgar, brother of James Edgar, the Secretary to James Stewart (the Old Pretender).\n\nIn closing this Report, I should like to say that I believe that the Society of Edgar Families is doing all that can be done successfully with the funds at present at its disposal. We must continue to aim at increasing our influence and therefore our membership. If possible, too, we should endeavour to secure a permanent headquarters to serve as a repository for the necessary accumulation of family papers, pedigrees, books, maps and pictures which continue to come to us by presentation or upon loan.\n\n(Extracts from the Third Annual Report of the Society of Edgar Families read by the Hon Secretary at the Annual Meeting at Melbourne 5 March, 1940).\n\nANNUAL MEETING\n\nAppointment of Patron: On a Motion of Mr Robert Halbert Edgar, seconded by Mr Otho Swan Edgar, and carried by acclamation, Mr James Keithock Edgar, of 44 Glen Road, Toronto, Canada, was appointed PATRON of THE SOCIETY OF EDGAR FAMILIES. The Meeting thus recognised the sterling work which Mr JH Edgar, who is head of the House of Keithock, has done for the Society. Our Patron is very interested in the history of the Edgar family and has made many valuable contributions to the files of the Society.\n\nSelection of Office-Bearers: Although Mr William H Edgar JP, believing that the honour should be enjoyed on this occasion by another, at first declined re-nomination as Vice-President, he was persuaded, after a resolution had expressed the Meeting's unanimous wish that he should withdraw his objection, to continue to give his helpful guidance to the Executive Council in that capacity for another year. Mr Edgar will also continue to act at Assistant Hon Secretary. The other retiring office-bearers were re-elected.\n\nHoliday Outing: It is regretted that it has not proved possible to arrange a suitable date for the visit which our Members and Associates hoped to pay to the gardens of the Hon WH Edgar MLC and Mrs Edgar at Upper Macedon. Mr and Mrs Edgar had undertaken to entertain at Macedon the members of various charitable organisations on the dates submitted by this Society. In expressing disappointment that the outing could not take place on those dates, Mr Edgar cordially renewed his invitation to our members to visit \"Duncraggan\" at some future time.\n\nCOMFORTS FOR EDGARS SERVING KING AND COUNTRY\n\nThe Hon Secretary will be pleased to receive from Members and Associate Members the names and addresses of those members of their families who are serving with the Navy, Army or Air Force at home or abroad. Full Service address should be sent to the Hon Secretary, I Trentham-Edgar, 75a Fitzroy Street, St Kilda, Melbourne S2, as soon as possible. When sufficient names are available, a Committee of the Society will arrange for the regular despatch of comforts to these men. Those who would be willing to send newspapers and magazines or other useful articles under the Society's scheme are invited to help.\n\nThis is a worthwhile cause and one which deserves the support of all our Members.

He first offered his services to the Royal Australian Air Force, but was not accepted, and so, in 1938 he went to London and became a pilot of the Royal Air Force. While awaiting advice of his acceptance he spent some time travelling in Great Britain, first with his parents and afterwards with Mr and Mrs WH Edgar, of Mont Albert, Victoria.\n\nLieut Colonel JM Edgar VD, is a former Commanding Officer of the 58th Battalion, which has its headquarters at Moonee Ponds. He is Secretary of the Essendon Rotary Club and a foundation member of the Society of Edgar Families. Lieut Col Edgar is a native of Ballarat and is the only child of the late Mr John Edgar (d. 1929), a native of Onchan, Isle of Man, who came to Victoria in \"The Lightening\" in 1867. (The earliest known ancestor of the family was the grandfather of Mr John Edgar. He was born at Whitehaven, Cumberland, Eng, on 31 May 1791. He was married at Whithorne Scotland, on 21 January 1812, to Agnes Maxwell (born at Whithorne, 12 October 1791), and by her had a numerous issue).\n\nEDGAR OF RIDDINGS, CUMBERLAND LINEAGE\n\n(Vide News Letter No. 6)\n\nThis family of Edgars were for long settled at Riddings, Cumberland, England. Two tombstones in Arthuret, Cumberland, Churchyard, bearing the lion rampant within heraldic shields, are known to mark the graves of ancestors of William Edgar (1791-1869). The inscriptions on those stones record the deaths of David Edgar, on 13 February 1654, aet 53, and his wife Ann Edgar, on 9 September 1676. With Ann is also buries David Edgar, in Riddings (d. 26 March 1691, aet 53), presumed to be her son.\n\nAgnes Armstrong, the eldest of the three sisters of John Armstrong of Greive (he was a descendant of the famous \"Kinmont Willie\" of ballad fame and died before 1752, when a Decreet of the Lords of Session declared his three sisters to be his heirs), married a David Edgar of Riddings. They had a son, David Edgar, whose eldest son, David Edgar, is described in 1865 (in a sasine on Charter of Adjudication granted to William Elliot, Writer in Edinburgh, who had purchased, the estate of Greive, co. Dumfries, of John Rae, who had bought it before 1731, of John Armstrong), as a mariner. (Vide, the Dumfries-shire and Galloway natural History and Antiquarian Society. Vol XVIII).\n\nWILLIAM EDGAR, in Rowanburnfoot, co, Dumfries, was buried at Canonbie in the same county. He died 12 October 1788, aet 85. His widow, Margaret Graham, died 27 February 1800, aet 84, it is considered probably from the evidence that this William Edgar is to be identified as the William Edgar, lawful son of William Edgar and Joan Murray, who was baptised at Canonbie, 27 November 1703. The same parents had two older sons: John, bapt 14 September 1694, and James, bapt November 1699; and two daughters: Janet, bapt March 1696, and Agnes, bapt 9 March 1702 (Parish Register).\n\nIt should be remarked that on the tombstones erected to the memory of Edgars, the place-names  Riddings, Canonbie, Rowanburnfoot and Longtown frequently appear in association and are indicative of the common descent of the Edgars buried there from the Edgars of Riddings.\n\nWilliam and Margaret (Graham) Edgar, had issue, three sons:\n\nI.

The letters are not dated - \"a family failing\" - as Sir Walter remarks in one of his letters to his son, but it is easy to determine the time at which they were written by the reference to the marriage of young Walter Scott, which took place on 3 February 1825. \"Feb 25th\" is on one letter, without the year. \"Monday\" is on another. Castle Street is the address. As is well known, he loved for part of the year in Edinburgh while attending the sessions of the Court in that \"grey city of the North,\" in which his name is enshrined. No place that his footsteps trod is left unvisited and his letters have been a precious heritage to posterity. Let us gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost.\n\nThe occasion of this correspondence is, that a Miss Edgar had written a book of poems called \"Tranquility,\" which she wished to have reviewed by Sir Walter. Her first letter evidently remained unanswered, and she wrote again - probably in a hurt manner. Instead of seeming to be annoyed at the importunity, the great master writes:\n\n\"Sir Walter Scott's most respectful compliments to Miss Edgar and begs to assure her that he had not the least intention of incurring her displeasure. It happened that he was called to the country after Miss Edgar's firs"
