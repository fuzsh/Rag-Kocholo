        "text": "Plenty of well-known personalities from public life began their days in Derbyshire and quite a few remain here to this day.\n\nSome are easily identifiable as having their roots in the county while others might come as a surprise to Derbyshire Live readers.\n\nFrom TV to cycling and fashion design to politics and film, Derbyshire has produced plenty of talent.\n\nWe even have our own 007…\n\nHere is our latest list of public figures, sports stars and celebrities with Derbyshire roots who are still doing Derbyshire proud.\n\nTess Daly\n\nThe Strictly Come Dancing co-host grew up in the village of Birch Vale near New Mills in North Derbyshire.\n\nDaly’s initial fame came as a model whose work included an appearance in the video to Duran Duran hit Notorious.\n\nFollowing a move into TV Daly’s big break came in 2004 when she joined Strictly as Bruce Forsyth’s co-presenter.\n\nDaly, who has also written two novels, is married to TV presenter and DJ Vernon Kay.\n\nSat Bains\n\nThe Derby-born and educated chef is best known for being chef proprietor of the two-Michelin star Restaurant Sat Bains with Rooms in Nottingham.\n\nHe won the Roux Scholarship in 1999 and worked in France before returning to the UK and opening his own restaurant.\n\nBains was one of the winners on the BBC show Great British Menu in 2007. He has also made appearances on the BBC's Saturday Kitchen, UKTV's Market Kitchen and the 2012 series Mind of a Chef with David Chang.\n\nDave Brailsford\n\nSir Dave Brailsford CBE who was born in Shardlow is a prominent figure in British cycling.\n\nHe was performance director of British Cycling from 2003 to 2014 during which time Great Britain led the cycling medal table at the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games, winning eight golds at both.\n\nBritish cyclists also won 59 World Championships across different disciplines from 2003 to 2013.\n\nBrailsford has since been general manager of British professional outfit Team Sky which is now known as Team Ineos.\n\nPaul Burrell\n\nThe Grassmoor-born TV personality and writer was originally a servant in the British Royal Household who rose to prominence due to his role as butler to Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nSince her death in 1997, Burrell has featured strongly in the media due to this connection. Following the publication of his 2003 memoirs ‘A Royal Duty’ Princes William and Harry accused Burrell of betraying their mother's confidence, calling the book \"a cold and overt betrayal.\"\n\nBurrell has appeared in a range of shows including I’m a Celebrity, Through the Keyhole and In Therapy.\n\nJo Caulfield\n\nActress, writer and comedian Jo Caulfield was brought up in Derbyshire before moving to London in her late teens.\n\nIn addition to being a regular on the stand-up circuit and at the Edinburgh Festival Caulfield has written for many well-known names including Ruby Wax and Graham Norton.\n\nHer TV career has included appearances on Never Mind The Buzzcocks, Mock the Week, The Stand-up Show, The Comedy Store, Have I Got News For You and Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow.\n\nTom Chambers\n\nDarley Dale born actor Tom Chambers was educated at Repton School.\n\nHe is perhaps best known for his role as Sam Strachan in the BBC medical dramas Holby City and Casualty.\n\nHe also played Max Tyler in BBC drama series Waterloo Road before portraying Inspector Sullivan in BBC's Father Brown.\n\nMore recently he has appeared in Emmerdale and Midsomer Murders and returned to musical theatre in a production of Crazy for You.\n\nChambers won the sixth series of Strictly Come Dancing with partner Camilla Dallerup.\n\nTimothy Dalton\n\nThe fourth James Bond moved to Belper aged four where he attended the Herbert Strutt Grammar School.\n\nDalton portrayed 007 in The Living Daylights (1987) and Licence to Kill (1989) - the fifteenth and sixteenth Bond movies. Dalton's portrayal of Bond was darker and more serious than his predecessor Roger Moore.\n\nDalton has also appeared in the films Flash Gordon (1980), The Rocketeer (1991), Looney Tunes: Back in Action (2003), Hot Fuzz (2007), and The Tourist (2010).\n\nOn TV he has played Mr Rochester in Jane Eyre (1983), Rhett Butler in Scarlett (1994), Rassilon in Doctor Who (2009–2010), Sir Malcolm Murray on Penny Dreadful (2014–2016), and since 2019 the Chief on Doom Patrol.\n\nDalton’s partners include reporter Kate Adie, actress Vanessa Redgrave and Russian singer-songwriter Oksana Grigorieva.\n\nPatricia Greene\n\nPatricia ‘Paddy’ Greene MBE is a 90-year-old actor.
