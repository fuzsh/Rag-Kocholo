        "text": "First Aid began in 1895 and was an independent monthly magazine for the ambulance and nursing services (comprised of members of St John Ambulance, the British Red Cross Society, and St Andrewâ€™s Association). Please note that 1907 is missing, and that the issues July 1924 - June 1926, and 1929-1938 are only available to view in-person at the Museum. These publications are now classed as a historical record, and any first aid advice presented within them is not in accord with current recommended practice. A large number of volumes were digitised through a generous financial donation from the St John Historical society."
