        "text": "The Eagle Awards showcases and celebrates the wealth of amateur theatre in Derby and Derbyshire and is one of the highlights of the region's cultural calendar.\n\nOn Sunday 21 July at 7pm, we are once again thrilled to be playing host to the The Eagle Awards. Now in its 28th year, we will be bursting onto the Derby Theatre stage with pzazz, panache and in the presence of some of the most exciting talent in the region. The Eagle Awards showcases and celebrates the wealth of amateur theatre in Derby and Derbyshire and is one of the highlights of the region’s cultural calendar.\n\nDerby and the surrounding areas are fortunate to have one of the country’s largest and most vibrant Amateur Theatre communities and awards, of a beautiful Eagle designed exclusively by Royal Crown Derby, will once again be presented to individuals and companies who have excelled in key areas. Amateur translates as ‘for the love of it’ and The Eagle Awards celebrate, promote and recognise this love and the wonderful array of theatre it produces each year.\n\nCaroline Barth (Head of Learning, Derby Theatre and Eagles coordinator) said:\n\n“The Eagle Awards is one of the city’s highlights of the arts and cultural calendar for non-professional artists and companies from across the region. The event is a wonderful opportunity for artists, companies and audiences alike to celebrate and recognise the fantastic talent and achievements of these companies. Once again, the judges have seen an amazing array of shows, and the judging has been incredibly tough. We look forward to seeing and welcoming all nominees, other members from the amateur theatre community and audiences on the evening.”\n\nShare\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nVenue\n\nMain House\n\nOverview\n\nTime: 7:00pm\n\nThe nominations for 2024 are:\n\nThe Derby Telegraph Award for BEST PRODUCTION OF A PLAY\n\nThe Watson Players for Ladies’ Day\n\nDerby Shakespeare Theatre Company for A Midsummer Night’s Dream\n\nEncore Performing Arts for The History Boys\n\nEncore Performing Arts for ‘Allo ’Allo\n\nThe Malcolm Sircom Award for BEST PRODUCTION OF A PANTOMIME\n\nThe Watson Players for Hook’s Revenge\n\nLittle Eaton Players for Cinderella\n\nThe Enfield Players for Cinderella\n\nSt Nicholas Players for Sleeping Beauty\n\nThe Gordon Bewley Award for BEST PRODUCTION OF A MUSICAL\n\nGatepost Theatre Company for School of Rock\n\nCentral Musical Theatre Company for Oliver!\n\nGatepost Theatre Company for Rock of Ages\n\nLEOS Musical Theatre Company for Mack & Mabel\n\nThe Timothy Dalton Award for BEST PERFORMANCE IN A PLAY\n\nChris Grantham (Rene) in ‘Allo ‘Allo for Encore Performing Arts\n\nArden-Caspar Jennison (Posner) in The History Boys for Encore Performing Arts\n\nAngela Swift (Jan) in Ladies’ Day for The Watson Players\n\nSonia Hardy (Betty) in Breezeblock Park for Quarndon Amateur Dramatic Society\n\nThe Phil Treece Award for BEST PERFORMANCE IN A PANTOMIME\n\nJohn Elliot (Fogarty) in The Princess and the Pea for Chellaston Players\n\nMik Horvath (Nursie) in Hook’s Revenge for The Watson Players\n\nSally Harton (Cinderella) in Cinderella for The Enfield Players\n\nRachel Holmes (Fairy Godmother) in Cinderella for Little Eaton Players\n\nThe Gwen Taylor Award for BEST PERFORMANCE IN A MUSICAL\n\nChris Collington (Dewey) in School of Rock for Gatepost Theatre Company\n\nJonathan Penton (Fagin) in Oliver!
