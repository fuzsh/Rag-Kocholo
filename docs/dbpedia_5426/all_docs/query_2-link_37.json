        "text": "Belper School and Sixth Form Centre, located at John O'Gaunt's Way DE56 0DA, is a foundation secondary school nestled in the north-east of Belper, Derbyshire, England. Established in 1973, this coeducational institution offers a comprehensive education to students between the ages of 11 and 18, currently catering to approximately 1,300 pupils. Notably, the school's approach to education has gained recognition through the Healthy Schools status and the Artsmark Gold award.\n\nThe school's last Ofsted inspection from 2019 reported that it needs improvement overall; however, it continues to teach a diverse student population, with the majority being white British and a below-average number of students identified as cared-for or with special educational needs. The school's campus has been marked by a few major incidents, such as a 2004 chemical spill that made national news and an instance in which iodine crystals led to minor burns and smoke inhalation amongst students.\n\nThe dedicated headteacher, Nick Goforth, leads the administration team, which includes governors and staff responsible for guiding the learning community at Belper School and Sixth Form Centre. Notable former pupils include gold medalist swimmer Ross Davenport, mountaineers Alison Hargreaves and Nigel Vardy, as well as actors such as Timothy Dalton and Simon Groom."
