        "text": "with Leonid Sobolev. The tragedy deals with the final years of Abai's life.\n\nAuezov's other dramatic contributions include Nightime Peals (about the 1916 uprising in Kazakhstan), The Hour of Trial and The Guard of Honor. This latter, coauthored with Aljappar Abishev deals with the Soviets' heroic efforts during World War II, especailly Panfilov's 8th Guard Division.\n\nOther sets of notes left by Auezov include those dealing with his travels in India as well as his vigin-land ketches which deal with collectivization.\n\nAuezov translated Gogol's Inspector General, Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew, and Pogodin's Aristocrats into Kazakh.\n\nMukhtar Auezov died in 1961.\n\nBehrangi, Samad\n\nChubak, Sadeq\n\nDonish, Ahmad\n\nDanishvar, Simin\n\nSimin Daneshvar was born to the family of a physician in Shiraz, Iran, in 1921. She grew up in Shiraz and received her early education there. In 1942 the family moved to Tehran where Simin worked for Radio Tehran and studied Persian literature at Tehran University. In 1948, she became the first Iranian woman to publish a collection of short stories. Called \"Atash-i Khamush\" (Extinguished Fire), the collection was prepared in tandem with her dissertation, \"Beauty as Treated in Persian Literature,\" which was approved in 1949.\n\nIn 1950, Daneshvar married the well-known Iranian short story writer and novelist Jalal Al-i Ahmad and, in 1952, she traveled to the United States as a Fullbright Fellow working on creative writing at Stanford University. When she returned to Iran, she joined the faculty of Tehran University teaching Iranian art history.\n\nAs author and translator, Daneshvar writes sensitively about the Iranian woman and her life. Daneshvar's most successful work Savushun (The Mourners), a novel about settled and tribal life in and around her hometown of Shiraz, was published in 1969. A best-seller of all Persian novels, it has undergone at least thirteen reprints. She has also contributed to Sukhan and Alifba as well as translated some of the works of Shaw, Chekhov, Moravia, Hawthorn, Saroyan, and Albe Schnitzler. \"A Land Like Paradise\" (shahri chun bihisht) is the lead story of a collection she published in 1962.\n\nBibliography:\n\nAtash-i Khamush (Extinguished Fire), 1948\n\nShahri Chun Bihisht (A Land Like Paradise), 1961\n\nBe Ki Salam Kunam (Whom Can I Greet?), 1980\n\nSavushun (The Mourners), 1969\n\nJazirai Sargardani (Island of Bewilderment), (in preparation)\n\nEnver Pasha\n\nFaqiri, Amin\n\nFirdowsi, Abu al-Qasim\n\nGulistan, Ibrahim\n\nIbrahim Gulistan was born in Shiraz in 1922 into a relatively prominent clerical family. His early education in Shiraz included the French language. He later learned English on his own by listening to the BBC and the American Armed Forces broadcasts. Throughout his career, he used his knowledge of these languages in translating some important peices from western literatures into Persian and in accessing information on western life and culture otherwise outside his reach.\n\nLike Jalal Al-i Ahmad, until 1948, when the Party was forced under ground by the Pahlavi regime, Gulistan was a member of the Tudeh Party. He resigned from the Party at that time and, thereafter, did not participated in its clandestine activities. His contribution to the work of the Party was the translation of two works by Lenin and Stalin.\n\nAt about the same time, Gulistan graduated from Tehran University's Faculty of Law and moved to the city of Abadan. There he wrote his first collection of short stories entitled, \"Azar, the Last Month of Autumn.\" In writing, he made an effort to divorce his work from the climate of Hedayat's stories. Instead, he emulated the works of Hemingway, Faulkner, and Henry James.\n\nIn addition to literature, from his early days in Shiraz, Gulistan was attracted to motion pictures. Later on in life he used this talent as a freelance photographer first and as a documentary producer later. As a result, in the 1950s, he produced several important documentaries and even an epoch-making feature. These include his \"Fire,\" \"The Wave, the Coral, the Rock,\" and \"Marlik Hills.\"\n\nIn 1958, following Sadiq Chubak's advice, Gulistan employed Forough Farrukhzad as an assistant in his studio. Although a married man, Gulistan and Farrukhzad fell in love. Subsequently, he set Farrukhzad up in an appartment in North Tehran and took her, along with his wife, to social events and parties.\n\nA firm, disciplined and confident man, Gulistan helped Farrukhzad realize her potential as a poet and as a film maker. \"Courtship\" (1960), produced for the National Canadian Film Corporation, is a product of their joint endeavor. They also collaborated in the making of The Mudbrick and the Mirror in 1962. Farrukhzad died in 1967, in a car accident. But Gulistan went on to write Tide and the Moon (1969) and The Secrets of the Treasures of the Haunted Valley (1974).\n\nIn addition to a publisher, cimematographer, and short-story writer, Gulistan is a skillful translator. He has translated The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn as well as several of Hemingway's stories. \"Carrousel\" (charkh-u falak) was published in his collection of short stories entitled, The Stream, the Wall, and the Thirsty (juyo divaro teshnah), Tehran, 1967.\n\nHedayat, Sadeq\n\nJamalzadeh, Muhammad Ali\n\nKerbabaev, Berdy\n\nBerdy Kerbabaev was born in 1894 into a peasant family of Kouki-Zereng of the Tejen Region. He received a traditional schooling at the village and later at the Bukhara schools. In 1917, he attended the Leningrad Institute of Oriental Studies. His literary career begins in 1923 with the publication of a series of satirical verses on the issues of the day. Kerbabaev contributed to the development of Turkmen literature with his collection of verses entitled, The World of a Maiden (1927), Moving Towards the New Life (1928), and Amu Darya (1931). His other contributions include Reality (1931), the first book of Turkmen essays and short stories the novellas Bairam (1934) and Batyr (1935).\n\nKerbabaev's works criticize the traditiona Islamic ways of Turkmen society, promote the emancipation of women so that they can take an active part alongside men in the creation of the new socialist system.\n\nKerbabaev's novella entitled Kurban Durdy (1942), his poems entitled Ailar (1943), and a libretto called Abadan (1943) were all published during World War II. His novel called Nrbitdag (1957), about the lives of Turkmen oil workers, however, is his most important contribution to the developement of fiction in Turkmenistan.\n\nKerbabaev is well known for the stories he has written for children. These include At the Border (1955), Batyr (1957), and the novella entitled The Merry Japbacks (1967). This latter, based on a local folktale, deals with the escapades of four mischievous brothers.\n\nLike Abai Kunanbaev of Kazakhstan, Kerbabaev made an attempt to familiarize Turkmen readers of the classical works of Russian and Soviet authors. To this end, he translated such works as Tolstoy's Haji Murat and Anna Karenina, Gorky's Mother and Sholokhov's Virgin Soil Upturned. He has also translated Pushkin's poems, Krylov's fables, and the verses of the Tatar poet Musa Jalil.\n\nKerbabaev's last major contribution was his A Drop of Water, a Nugget of Gold. Kerbabaev died in 1974.\n\nMakhtumquli\n\nMukhammadiev, Fazliddin"
