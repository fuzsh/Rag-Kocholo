After Freud, Trotsky, Benjamin,and Adorno, after futurism, constructivism, dada, surrealism, andthe explosion of pop, it seems hard to remember that artâand the artfilmâwas once considered the spiritual playground or retreat of abourgeois elite. True, there had been âFilm dâArtâ around 1910, bestremembered for the black-tie audience assembled for the premiere ofLâAssassinat du duc de Guise at the Paris OpÃ©ra with music composedby Saint-Saens. And in the 1920s certain patrons of âThe SeventhArtâ treated cinema as though it were a debutante being introducedinto high society. In Film as Art (Film als Kunst, 1932) Rudolf Arnheimconsolidated the aesthetic principles achieved toward the end of thesilent era, principles based on classical painting (balance, emphasis,discretion, and so forth). But Duchamp, Leger, and BuÃ±uel hadalready blustered in to spoil the ball. When cinema next attached itself to art, after the Second WorldWar, it was not to emulate the forms and functions of painting ordrama, but to adopt the intensity of their creation and experience.For even when it is seemingly âready-made,â âtrouvÃ©,â âinforme,â orâabsurd,â art is exigent in the demands it makes on makers andviewers. Art cinema is âambitious,â the word with which FranÃ§oisTruffaut characterized the filmmakers he championed, the film-maker he wanted to become. If cineastes are artists, it is because they v\n\nP:07\n\nvi Foreword partake of the ambition of genuine novelists, painters, and sculptors to supersede the norm, each in his own domain. In 1972 Victor Perkins answered Film as Art with his own Film as Film. We loved this title. It demonstrated that cinema had arrived, had come into its own and no longer needed the corroboration of established aesthetics to be taken seriously. A terrific book, it pointed to the most telling and complex moments within a spectrum of films from Hollywood genre pieces to silent classics. As his title announced, Perkins oriented us to experience and to explore films on their own terms. He adjusted his rhetoric so as to enter not so much the discourse as the world projected before him. You can argue that art cinema, like art in general, serves contradictory functions (as cultural capitalâindeed as actual capitalâas propaganda or cri- tique of ideology, as mass entertainment, etc); but those who live their lives in tandem with cinema care precisely about the function of film as film, even while understanding it to be congenitally impureâas Bazin insistedâand enmeshed in the terrestrial and the social. Global Art Cinema: the first adjective of this title binds what it mod- ifies to a mesh of relations that keep the whole thing from floating up and away like a balloon. At the same time âArt Cinemaâ is by defini- tion pan-national, following the urge of every ambitious film to take off from its point of release, so as to encounter other viewers, and other movies, elsewhere and later. The title in fact begs a question debated in comparative literature over the vexed term, dating from Goethe, of Weltliteratur. For David Damrosch, a text joins the com- munity of world literature when it finds sustained reception beyond the borders of the specific community out of which it arose. World literature comprises not just a huge bibliography of works, but more pertinently the complex interactions among these works, as they form the mixed traditions absorbed by later writers, as they are consumed by various communities of readers, and as they are tracked and inter- preted by scholars and academics. Perched on the promontories of their carefully erected theories, scholars have been tempted to sense intelligent design in the evolution of world literature. On behalf of literature they take note of contributions that come from unlikely quarters where new topics, new techniques, and new generic hybrids stretch language across more and more realms and types of experi- ence. As for the rest of writing (all those newspaper essays and serial stories that are thrown away, those folktales never leaving the local language, that doggerel whose echoes remain in homes and cafÃ©s), is this not material for the anthropologist more than the literary scholar? Such materials give insights into what is valued by individuals and groups, but, if never translated, these texts interact not at all with\n\nP:08\n\nForeword viireaders outside the community. Goethe and Damrosch would leavethem alone, and so does global art cinema. No one would dispute the value of the visual culture of any giventime or place, or even the beauty of some of its expressions; no onewould doubt the artistry, intelligence, and wit that has gone into in-numerable state-commissioned documentaries, popular televisionshows, advertisements, home movies, and episodes of local filmseries. But insofar as these remain within the culture, discovered per-haps by scholars interested in those cultures, they do not participatein the cultural economy of world film and certainly do not belong toanything one would label global art cinema. The latter might best be thought of as festival fare, since todayevery film programmed by an international festival becomes de factovisible to spectators anywhere on the globe who seek out distinctivemovies. In the early days of festivals, titles were selected by nationalcommissions to go abroad, whereas today festivals select what theyshow, sometimes even commissioning work by artists they deem tal-ented. This does not upset the rapport of national culture to the cul-ture of the cinephile, but it accelerates its movement. For example, ofthe hundred films made each year in the Philippines this past decade,only fifteen or so can be identified as part of the Philippine art ci-nema, specifically those that have been selected to be screened abroad.Whereas it took the Taiwanese new wave several years to penetratethe international market, the Philippine titles in todayâs global net-work have instantly left their imprint, altering the profile of Asiancinema in toto. So there would seem to be two distinct Philippinecinemas, one belonging to a specific culture bound principally by theTagalog language, and the other taken up by a polyglot internationalaudience who can access these films at festivals or download them ontheir computers. To take an even clearer example, every other year FESPACO (Fes-tival du CinÃ©ma Panafricain) screens about 100 films from Franco-phone African countries, both sub-Saharan and Maghrebian, as wellas an increasing number of titles from South Africa and Zimbabwe.My students learn the names of cineastes from Senegal, Mali, andBurkina Faso whose work is funded in Europe and who expect to bescreened on several continents, then distributed on DVD throughthe Parisian outlet Cine3mondes. Only one Nigerian film, however,has ever been showcased at FESPACO or been treated to the chanceat wide reception, despite the fact that Nigeria produces an estimated1,500 videofilms annually. Ezra, which took top prize at that festivalin 2007, was, you might suspect, an exception to Nollywood, financedas it was mainly outside Nigeria (by ARTE), with screenings in Parisand a brief run in New York. Otherwise Nollywood has been an\n\nP:09\n\nviii Foreword antiglobal phenomenon of stupendous proportions, worth a place in a course on world cinema, but a place apart. Whereas FESPACO ti- tles attract local and âtouristâ audiences, exhibiting a dialectic cen- tral to my courseâs conception of world cinema, Nollywood doesnât look out for us, and hasnât been concerned about our reaction. Hence it gets treated, if at all, as rich anthropological material, a vibrant folk expression, grassroots graffiti, not meant for viewers outside the community. Of course these videofilms now crop up in London, New York, Toronto, and New Haven, wherever the diasporic com- munity thrives. And some titles may well drift beyond these commu- nities to be discovered by a broader audience, in the manner of certain Bollywood films recently. This could include some âclassic titleâ that was made in the early years of this folk phenomenon, now rediscovered and singled out for a festival showing or DVD release because a cultural entrepreneur thought it had something to show (or say) to seasoned film viewers. The distinction between local and international is thus not about value, but about address. What âglobalâ adds to all this is simultaneity. We used to discover local films belatedly and gradually. Look at the example of Mizoguchi or of the Yugoslavian âblack waveâ of the 1960s and 1970s. Today, however, an art film made in Tajikistan may well be seen in Japan before it screens at home. As for the designation âartâ within global art cinema, the local plays a key role. I have always credited art, and particularly film art, with exposing or figuring phenomena previously unrepresented. I rely for this on Bazinâs incomparably crucial distinction between realism as a set of conventions and neorealism as a moral attitude toward the alterity of what is nearby. In his day, La terra trema allowed all of Italy, and then the world at large, to hear for the first time the sounds (the poetry) of Sicilian dialect, and to sense the complex economy linking extended families to larger social groups, and those groups to both an exploitative economy that went beyond the visible and the fishing fields themselves, including the boats and nets and human beings that make it into an industry. As Giorgio De Vincenti understood, perhaps before anyone else, modernist cinema arose when new real- ities such as this one in postwar Italy forced filmmakers into concoct- ing ingenious narrative and stylistic strategies to bring them onto the plane of expression. From neorealism flowed the various new waves of the 1960s and of the 1980s, the core of what has become global art cinema. Take Tai- wan in 1983. Hou Hsiao-hsien had little schooling in world cinema; effectively a cog in the Taiwanese genre system of the 1970s, Hong Kong films comprised most of what he took to be foreign fare. Yet, when given a chance, he came up with his distinctive style in response\n\nP:10\n\nForeword ixto a need to represent the invisible peoples of Taiwan and theirunheard voices. A literary neorealism preceded him there, it must besaid, just as Elio Vittorini preceded Visconti in giving voice to Sicilianlanguage and concerns. The style Hou Hsiao-hsien perfected duringthe 1980s, leading to his triumph at Venice with City of Sadness, didnot involve studying global cinema or international modernism; itcame about as he worked out solutions to problems in representationposed by the local (historical) situation he was determined to dojustice to. Might we expect another such talent, nearly autodidact, to arisesomewhere else? Should we be looking near and far? Probably not.Since the 1980s, VHS tapes and then DVDs have made every ambi-tious filmmaker perforce a global artist. True, festivals reward nov-elty. They seek it out and they provoke it. They tempt filmmakers intostylistic postures that are calculated to sit attractively and prominentlywithin a spectrum of other styles that the filmmaker has undoubtedlyalready examined. More often, the novelty needed to keep the economyof film art moving ahead is produced through generic hybrids. Festi-vals are hothouses where such hybrids are concocted, take root, andeventually flower; this is where a European cameraperson can meet aChinese designer at dinner with a Japanese producer interested inexploiting a variant of the ghost-melodrama or horror-comedy. I donâtmean to sound cynical. Such hothouses âforceâ the flowering of filmsthat are often wonderful to see. But we should be alert to disingen-uous hyping, whether of supposedly innocent auteurs or of brand-new new waves. The very idea of âindependent cinemaâ has beenaltered by what is now a fully global network that makes every filmquite âdependent.â Yet these new conditions have not fundamentally altered condi-tions that have been with cinema for most of its existence. Distribu-tors, exhibitors, and, above all, critics, have always identified notabletitles, trying to amplify them so they could be recognized above thehum of standard industrial fare. Even before festivals began collect-ing each yearâs most talented cinematic voices, distinctions weremade. Whether or not âart cinemaâ named such distinctions, exportersaimed to sell what films they could abroad. In the period I know best,France in the 1930s, out of about 130 films made each year, a scorefound themselves shipped out of the country, where they interactedwith other export films in an unofficial competition. Poetic realist ti-tles by CarnÃ©, Duvivier, Feyder, Renoir, and GrÃ©millon were viewedthroughout Europe, and then were acclaimed in Japan, and playedwell in Latin America. They were treated as sophisticated and âartis-tic,â first in comparison with other internationally distributed films,and then in relation to standard fare wherever they played. Standard\n\nP:11\n\nx Foreword fare, including the more than one hundred French films that never left the country, kept the national system afloat and arguably better defined the national community and its values than did those early avatars of global art cinema. To distinguish not just particular styles in the 1930s, but larger contexts affecting production, reception, and film culture (criticism, government support or regulation, advertising and exhibition strat- egies), I came up with the neologism optique. In the context of this anthology, I would distinguish three optiques that have been opera- tive for a long time, even while technological and social develop- ments have caused them to vary: (1) national folk films, (2) global entertainment movies, and (3) international art cinema. The first category covers Nollywood, as we have seen, nearly invisible outside the Nigerian community, but also those massively popular genres scarcely comprehensible outside the community that they address and express (Tagalog comedies, German heimat melodramas, etc.). The second category, apparently ascendant in our era, includes blockbusters, to be sure, but most Hollywood films as well, whose income derives more from offshore than domestic performance. Pan-national genre productions, like Asian horror, spaghetti west- erns, and Swedish soft-core, show that the global optique need not address all spectators everywhere, but can target a subset that glob- alization allows them to locate. Television series made in Mexico or Korea but viewed in the Middle East, Africa, Russia, and by individ- uals in the United States have added a new dimension to this global entertainment category. Festivals and critics work tirelessly to distinguish the third optique, lest âart cinemaâ be taken as merely a niche genre of this second cat- egory. Thus no festival that I know of calls itself âglobal,â while many are called âinternationalâ or âworldâ events. Hence the provocation and the challenge of this anthologyâs title and mission. What used to be treated as a tension between national values and the international market, today takes place across a global network that has absorbed both. The Web is quickly providing new distribution channels, for- mats, and cultures of reception. Those frightened by such a seem- ingly unregulated proliferation need only remember recent clashes of national and âart cinema.â Such was his pique at the treatment he had been given in Taiwan that Edward Yang could produce an inter- national art-house (and global DVD) hit like Yi Yi, yet refuse to let the film play in his native country where it was shot. The struggles film- makers face at home often generate the heat that forges the strength of their creations. Jia Zhangke charisma derives in large part from the difficulties, even the hostility, with which he has been treated in China. The existence of something like âglobal art cinemaâ is, in his\n\nP:12\n\nForeword xicase, literally a saving grace. And what he has produced under thatmantle graces us all. By whatever name we call it, may the optique that informs ambitiousfilmmakers continue to galvanize ambitious viewers (letâs not callourselves consumers), so that a vibrant film culture may grow inresponse to strong films and to the realities they figure.\n\nP:13\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nP:14\n\nAcknowledgmentsThis book benefited greatly from the critical eyes of our colleaguesJennifer Fay and John David Rhodes, as well as from the feedbackof the volumeâs anonymous readers.

At various points, it hasintersected with popular genres, national cinemas, revolutionary film, and the avant-garde, and has mixed corporate, state, and independent capital. An elastically hybridcategory, art cinema has nonetheless sustained an astonishing discursive currency incontemporary film culture. This book uses art cinemaâs mongrel identity to explorecentral questions for current film scholarship. Since the term âart cinemaâ has alwayssimultaneously invoked industrial, generic, and aesthetic categories, a current reck-oning of the field exposes otherwise unseen geopolitical fault lines of world cinema.Despite its more conservative connotations, art cinema retains at its core both a com-parativist impulse and an internationalist scope that might be productively brought tobear on globalized culture. From our perspective, art cinema has from its beginningsforged a relationship between the aesthetic and the geopolitical or, in other words,between cinema and world. Thus, it is the critical category best placed to engagepressing contemporary questions of globalization, world culture, and how the eco-nomics of cinemaâs transnational flows might intersect with trajectories of film form.Because of its flexibility as a category, the term âart cinemaâ can be an unreliable label.In fact, it names a dynamic and contested terrain where film histories intersect withthe larger theoretical questions of the image and its travels. Global Art Cinema outlinesnew shapes and boundaries for art cinema, rejecting the commercial logic of ever-burgeoning markets, as well as conventional progressive histories of style and themyths of transmission from core to periphery. The collection thinks comparatively ontopics often addressed only locally, focusing on intersections in the emergence, recep-tion, and status of international cinema. 3\n\nP:29\n\n4 Introduction How does one approach such a complex category? One possible entry point to the field of global art cinema is The International Film Guide, an annual survey of film production, published since 1964, and aimed primarily at distributors, critics, and other film professionals. As an archive of writing on international film, the Guide provides detailed evidence of which films, countries, and directors took part in critical debate and industrial exchange, while as a historical document, it powerfully indexes the changing discursive terrain of art cinema. Addressed to those audiences interested in âserious cinema,â its inaugural editorial argued for quality films, specialist cinemas, and the need to secure âa wider and more thorough distribution of overseas films dâart.â1 With- out using the term âart cinema,â it clearly outlined the categoryâs institutional terrain: overtly artistic textuality, art-house theater exhibition, and the international circulation of foreign films. In perusing the guide from the 1960s to the present, we can trace the emergence of art cinema as a central term. Moreover, we see vividly mapped art cine- maâs development as a geographically organized force field, centered around a Euro- American critical and industrial infrastructure. The guideâs very first âdirectors of the yearâ were Luchino Visconti, Orson Welles, FranÃ§ois Truffaut, Andrej Wajda, and Alfred Hitchcock, and subsequent years added a canonical array of mostly West Euro- pean auteurs (Federico Fellini, Louis Malle, Ingmar Bergman), with a number of East Europeans (Roman Polanski, MiklÃ³s JancsÃ³, DuÅ¡an Makavejev), several Americans (John Frankenheimer, Stanley Kubrick), and very few Asians (Satyajit Ray, Akira Kuro- sawa). This yoking of authorship and nation to globality precisely figures the develop- ment of art cinema from Italian neorealismâs âdiscoveryâ in the United States to a model of international flows that centered on the West EuropeâNorth America axis, including only a few exemplary filmmakers from cinematic cultures beyond that axis.2 Demonstrating art cinemaâs foundational Eurocentrism, the Guide goes on to chart the expansion of its global reach from the early tokenistic inclusion of Ray and the Japanese directors to a vision of world cinema in the 1980s and beyond. While occasion- ally a director from a hitherto unrepresented country appears on the best film listâ Dariush Mehrjuiâs Postchi / The Postman in 1973 and Arturo Ripsteinâs El castillo de la pureza / Castle of Purity in 1975, for instanceâthe conception of what constitutes the international is at first fairly limited. In 1964, the âWorld Surveyâ section includes only thirteen countries, but by 1989 almost sixty are included and in 2006 more than one hundred. Indeed, the breadth of the Guideâs global reach is a major point of editorial pride in the 2006 issue, with Roya Sadat, the first female director from Afghanistan, and Sharunas Bartas, the first Lithuanian to show at Cannes being highlighted along with new reports from Guatemala and Uganda. In 2008, the Guide presented itself not as the champion of serious cinema but as âthe definitive annual survey of contemporary global cinema.â Here, the global rhetorically implies the serious, while the diversity of locations and types of production supersedes the rejection of commercialism as the key indicator of distinction. This changing construction of art cinema as a global field of industry and aesthetics evokes the ambivalence and complexity that we find in the category: clearly enmeshed in an imperialist and Eurocentric history, art cinema also provides both material for critique and nourishment for a diverse range of cinematic spaces.\n\nP:30\n\nIntroduction 5 The Guideâs shift from European films dâart to global cinema registers not only achanging discourse in film journalism and distribution patterns, but points also towhy we think a collection on global art cinema is needed. Art cinema is resurgent inthe new century, with cinemas from South Korea, Denmark, and Israel garneringinternational acclaim and finding enthusiastic audiences at festivals, in theaters, andon DVD. The term âart cinemaâ itself has both a historical importance and a contem-porary currency. Used in critical histories of postwar European and U.S. cinema tocarve out a space of aesthetic and commercial distinction that is neither mainstreamnor avant-garde, the term remains an everyday concept for film industries, critics,and audiences. Nonetheless, the sense of art cinema as elitist and conservativeremains in such force that many scholars to whom we spoke about this volumeresponded with perplexity that we would endorse such a retrograde category. Thisattitude is common in art cinema discourse: both postclassical film theory and theturn to cultural studies deliberately focused intellectual attention away from the pre-vious decadesâ canon of âseriousâ films. Little sustained scholarly attention has beenpaid to refining and updating the parameters of art cinema as a category since thepioneering essays of the 1960s and 1970s. And even the institutions that helpedcreate the category of art cinema often held the term in uncertain esteem. The Mu-seum of Modern Artâs comprehensive 1941 index to cinema had no category to dis-tinguish a genre of feature-length films of special artistic interest.3 Moreover, JosephBurstyn, perhaps the most influential of distributors of European art films in theUnited States, early on rejected the term âart cinema.â4 As both a historical problemand a contemporary aporia, art cinema names a field that has not been sufficientlyinterrogated by film studies. And yet, while film studies has too often foreclosed on the potential of art ci-nema as a category, and even as the art-house theater teeters on the brink of extinc-tion in all but the most cosmopolitan of centers, scholars have nonetheless consis-tently engaged with films that fall under this rubric. Historians have writtencompellingly on film festivals and national film histories, and theorists continue tofind rich material in the work of directors such as Lina WertmÃ¼ller and ZhangYimou. This anthology recognizes not only the growing significance of this scholar-ship, but also the centrality of art cinema to the larger field of global film studies.Scholars have demonstrated a gathering impulse to teach and rethink cinema as aglobal phenomenon, and we also find important research on art cinema in recenttheorizations of the film image; in revised industrial, legal, and exhibition histories;and as part of renewed debates about national, postcolonial, and regional cinemacultures. The commonly held notion of art cinema as a retrograde category, then,does not actually reflect a lack of interest in the object, but demonstrates a criticalreluctance to acknowledge art cinema as a field within which these objects of studycirculate. Given the ability of the category to define an area of cultural, economic, andaesthetic meaning, it is perverse, we think, to ignore or deride art cinema. This vol-ume seeks to focus on art cinema as both an active aspect of global film culture andas an indispensable category of its critique.\n\nP:31\n\n6 Introduction Problems of Definition Art cinema poses a problem for film scholarship, because while the term is widely used by critics and audiences alike, it has proved very hard to pin down within any of the common rubrics for categorizing types of cinema. Geoffrey Nowell-Smith says that âart cinema has become a portmanteau term, embracing different ideas of what cinema can be like, both inside and outside the mainstream.â5 To combat this loose- ness, he proposes that we separate art film into two types, with relatively mainstream âqualityâ films like the British heritage film or Chinese Fifth Generation films on one side, and more radical low-budget independent production like that of Aki KaurismÃ¤ki or the original French New Wave on the other. This binary is appealing but hard to sustain in practice. Even these few examples illustrate the vast disparities in form, style, and historical and economic context that make taxonomy so difficult. Moreover, the systems of distinction and evaluation that would label a film more mainstream or more independent are also historically and geographically contingent. The diverse con- texts within which art films are made and viewed does make definition challenging, but perhaps instead of trying to enforce a taxonomic principle, we should focus on the nature of art cinemaâs instability. Speaking of the interwar modernist films that formed the foundation for the Euro- pean canon of film art, Martin Stollery points out that their diverse backgrounds include major studio productions, private funding, and advertisements for tea.6 If the postwar films that are canonically understood as art cinema are not quite so diverse, they certainly inherit the mongrel nature of the art cinemaâs prehistory. The first problem for a collection on art cinema, therefore, is to define the term. Is art cinema a genre, in the way that mainstream criticism often uses the term? A mode of film practice, as David Bordwell claims?7 An institution, as for Steve Neale?8 A historically unprecedented mode of exhibiting films, in Barbara Wilinskyâs terms?9 Is it, even, as Jeffrey Sconce writes of trash cinema, a language able to disarticulate excess, style, and politics from taste and to map the promiscuous hybridity of cinematic forms?10 In common usage, âart cinemaâ describes feature-length narrative films at the margins of mainstream cinema, located somewhere between fully experimental films and overtly commercial products. Typical (but not necessary) features include foreign production, overt engagement of the aesthetic, unrestrained formalism, and a mode of narration that is pleasurable but loosened from classical structures and distanced from its representa- tions. By classical standards, the art film might be seen as too slow or excessive in its vi- sual style, use of color, or characterization. The elasticity of this conventional definition may explain the categoryâs resilience in the public eye but fails to resolve discrepancies among the scholarly interrogations of the term. We contend that the lack of strict param- eters for art cinema is not just an ambiguity of its critical history, but a central part of its specificity, a positive way of delineating its discursive space. We propose as a principle that art cinema can be defined by its impurity; a difficulty of categorization that is as productive to film culture as it is frustrating to taxonomy. To be impure is not the same as to be vague or nebulous. Rather, we contend that art cinema always perverts the standard categories used to divide up institutions,\n\nP:32\n\nIntroduction 7locations, histories, or spectators. Art cinemaâs impurity can be understood in avariety of ways. First, it is defined by an impure institutional space: neither experi-mental nor mainstream, art cinema moves uneasily between the commercial worldand its artisanal others. As Nowell-Smith points out, at the more mainstream endof the spectrum some contemporary European art films look more like the cinema ofquality that the French New Wave rejected than they do the films of AgnÃ¨s Varda orJean-Luc Godard. But at the other end, artists like Matthew Barney and filmmakerslike Apichatpong Weerasethakul mix theatrical space with gallery space in practicesthat are as close to the avant-garde as to commercial cinema. Exhibition practicesaugment this uneasiness of location: for the art house holds a unique place in consti-tuting art cinema as a field. Art cinema is often characterized as an outsider: It hasnot been assimilated to mainstream tastes, and it lives in a ghetto, albeit often a poshor bourgeois one. This institutional definition is strangely contingent. In many cases,art films are simply those films shown in art-house theaters, or at film festivals, sothat their very existence is dependent on certain critics, programmers, or distributionmodels. Second, art cinema articulates an ambivalent relationship to location. It is a reso-lutely international category, often a code for foreign film. While certain kinds of pop-ular films can circulate globally (Hollywood, Hong Kong action films, Hindi filmsviewed by Indian diasporic audiences), for most countries, art cinema provides theonly institutional context in which films can find audiences abroad. Indeed, it has beenwidely noted that many films that are understood as popular in their domestic marketbecome art films when exhibited abroad. In these cases, it is the fact of traveling inter-nationally that constitutes a film as an example of art cinema. This international iden-tity constructs art cinema as cosmopolitan or, in Mette Hjortâs words, âan attempt toresist the dynamics of an intensified localism fuelled by globalism by focusing atten-tion, not on heritage and ethnicity, but on the very definition of cinematic art and onthe conditions of that artâs production.â11 The sense of internationalism that opensKrzysztof Zanussiâs or Lucrecia Martelâs films to audiences far from Poland or Argen-tina opposes the localism of national cinema discourse. Conversely, art films play amajor role in creating canonical national cinemas, and representations of locality oftenground claims on art film seriousness. In traditional film historiography, art cinemahas been a way to organize national cinemas via canons of âgreat directors,â so that thevery international reception of art cinema becomes proof of its national importance.While we recognize the past half-centuryâs critical tendency to conflate art cinema withnational cinema, we resist repeating this mistake and suggest that art cinema alwayscarries a comparativist impulse and transnational tenor. Third, art cinema sustains a complexly ambivalent relationship to the critical andindustrial categories that sustain film history, such as stardom and authorship. Onthe one hand, it is constituted for many by a rejection of Hollywood systems andvalues. On the other, we find director and star systems in art cinema that closely parallelHollywoodâs own structures, even where they reject its aesthetic hierarchies. Thus, artcinema has nurtured stars such as Hannah Schygulla, Jeanne Moreau, and Gong Li,but it might define the nature of stardom or the bodily qualities desired in a star\n\nP:33\n\n8 Introduction differently from Hollywood. Likewise, art cinema contains an auteurist impulse but demands a different version of authorship than the Hollywood auteur. An especially productive question raised here is the political history of the auteur. Janet Staiger has argued that whereas auteur studies have been largely rejected as an inadequate model of meaning production in cinema, authorship matters to those filmmakers in nondom- inant positions for whom âasserting even a partial agency may seem to be important for day-to-day survival or where locating moments of alternative practice takes away the naturalized privileges of normativity.â12 Jean Maâs essay on Tsai Ming-liang in this vol- ume, for example, speaks eloquently on the politics of auteurism and globalization. Since art cinema authors often speak from outside of Europe or America or locate them- selves outside the mainstream of representational practices, it could be argued that au- thorship takes on a pressing significance for thinking the potential of art cinema as a platform for political agency. Fourth, and in another major category of film historiography, art cinema troubles notions of genre. As mentioned previously, scholars have drawn upon various ele- ments of genre theory in defining art cinema in terms of narrative, aesthetic modality, and historical development. Despite this influential rubric, it is not at all clear that art cinema can fit into the generic models that have sustained analysis of the musical, the western, or melodrama. Not only are the practices of art cinema radically different across national lines, but its meaning has altered substantially across time. To take just one recent example, the emergence of an âartsierâ version of Hollywood film in the 1990s in response to American independent cinema produced a more popular itera- tion of art cinema that included the narrative products of boutique production divi- sions in Hollywood studios. Folding âindieâ filmmakers like Todd Haynes and Miranda July into a public discourse of art cinema brings together experimental film and major Hollywood stars and infrastructures in ways that thwart conventional descriptions of genre. Lastly, art cinema constitutes a peculiarly impure spectator, both at the level of textual address and in the history of its audiences. The spectator of Italian neorealism or of a recent film like Fatih Akinâs Auf der anderen Seite / Edge of Heaven (2007) is asked to be both intellectually engaged and emotionally affected. Aesthetic distance is called for, but the rigor of distanciation is constantly crossed with an emotive bodily response and a virtual engagement with the other. What often reads as a failure of difficulty for critics writing from a modernist Marxist perspective can equally be seen as a way to address a viewer who responds to what Eric Schaefer has called âa conflu- ence of contradictions.â13 The literature on the emergence of art-house audiences meshes with this sense of a hybrid spectator. For example, early art film spectators in the United States were constructed simultaneously as thoughtful and responsible people who wanted to view films about serious subjects and as hungry voyeurs drawn uncontrollably to the salacious imagery allowed for by the new foreign realisms.14 And while early sociological studies of the art cinema audience suggested that it appealed primarily to men, art cinema has often been represented in the public eye as feminine, effete, or queer.15 Its openness to aesthetic experience is not unconnected to its open- ness to minority communities, who have formed a significant part of art cinemaâs\n\nP:34\n\nIntroduction 9audience as well as its representational politics. Thus, in a minoritizing move, evenquite conventional gay and lesbian films are often categorized as art cinema, in thesame way that popular foreign films are. But at the same time, this discourse canoperate to exclude challenging minority films from the art cinema canon, as happenedwith the films of Charles Burnett until recently.16 We find in these impurities the kernel of art cinemaâs significance: as a category ofcinema, it brings categories into question and holds the potential to open up spacesbetween and outside of mainstream/avant-garde, local/cosmopolitan, history/theory,and industrial/formal debates in film scholarship. In the sections that follow, we mapthe discursive fields that shape art cinema. Geography and GeopoliticsIf the label âart filmâ frequently signifies simply a foreign film at the box office, then itis clear that we are already speaking not only of geography but of the politics of geo-graphical difference. Foreign to whom? Traveling to and from which cultures andaudiences? The geopolitical realm is central to the discursive field of art cinema, but ithas been stifled or depoliticized in much existing scholarship. Criticism that focuseson the auteur either personalizes style and mode of production out of all locationalcontext or reifies style in terms of national cultural specificity. Alternatively, more syn-thetic accounts of European art cinema tend toward a taken-for-granted sense of âEuro-pean-nessâ that connects and nourishes the canonical art cinema directors, usually inopposition to Hollywood as the commercial and stylistic other. Thomas Elsaesser haspointed out the binary logic involved in thus constructing European cinema againstHollywood, and he argues that spectators of the European films that circulate globallyas art cinema âhave traditionally enjoyed the privilege of feeling âdifferentâ . . . in ahistorically determined set of relations based on highly unstable acts of self-definitionand self-differentiation implied by the use of terms such as âauteur,â âart,â ânationalcinema,â âculture,â or âEurope.ââ17 Thus, in what many audiences think of as its most typ-ical manifestation, the North American exhibition of European art films, art cinemaâsgeography is no more than a mutually beneficial circulation of Western cultural capital. Because of the Eurocentric structure of this dominant history, art cinema hasbeen commonly linked with a narrow and reactionary version of the international,rather than with more expansive, radical, or controversial frames such as world cinema,postcoloniality, or globalization. But several influential models exist for refuting thisbinarism. We might turn to the theorists and filmmakers of the New Latin AmericanCinema, who often opposed art cinema as a bourgeois form, but who also forwardedconcepts such as âimperfect cinemaâ as an alternative to the aesthetic and geopoliticaldead end of Europe versus Hollywood. Julio GarcÃ­a Espinosaâs rejection of Europeâsartistic â-ismsâ linked the European reception of Third Cinema in the art house withthe need to imagine other poetics and geographies of cinema.18 Or, in a quite differentregister, Miriam Hansenâs concept of vernacular modernism can be read as a way offormulating a nonbinary relationship among Hollywood classicism, modernist\n\nP:35\n\n10 Introduction cinema, and the world. Hansen finds in American cinema âa metaphor of a global sensory vernacular,â in which the opposition of (American) classicism to (European) political modernism is revealed as inadequate to the global flows of modernization.19 (Kathleen Newman and LÃºcia Nagib both critique and revise the scope and trajec- tory of Hansenâs globality, and in doing so propose views of history more in keeping with traditions of Third Cinema and postcolonial theory.20) We contend that art cinema cannot (and never could) be defined solely by the Europe-Hollywood relationship, that the category demands a more complex vision of the global that is responsive to geographical complexity and, more important, susceptible to geopolit- ical analysis. One way of approaching art cinemaâs geopolitics is its sustaining concept of universal legibility. If art films are to travel to international audiences, they must make the claim that their forms and stories are comprehensible across languages and cul- tures. Thus, part of art cinemaâs stake in art is an investment in visual legibility and cross-cultural translation. Unlike popular cinema, it does not claim to express a locally defined culture but an idea of (cinematic) art as such. For this reason, the institutions of art cinema often deploy quite overt ideas of cinema as a universal language. The Landmark Theatres chain in the United States, for example, introduces each program with the phrase âThe language of cinema is universalâ spoken in several languages. In Europe, theaters associated with the Europa exhibition network show a graphic list of the cities in which it is located. In both cases, these corporate logos hail cinema audi- ences as an imagined community of international viewers, participating across cultures in a shared form of experience. At the same time, of course, they are universal consumers, able to enjoy films from wherever. Here, cross-cultural cinema is both a corporate marketing technique for the art house and a promise held out of a certain kind of spectatorship. And in mainstream film criticism, films are often lauded as universal stories in order to reduce the threat of unpleasurable difference, to manage the irreconcilable fissures produced by translation, and to construct texts as easily assimilable to Western cultural norms. For these reasons, no doubt, universal legibility is widely critiqued as a Western/patriarchal/neocolonial perspective imposed across the geopolitical field. While we donât dispute the potential for art cinema to take up these conservative versions of universality, we suggest that the problem of universality in art cinema is too complicated to be addressed by a simple dismissal. We feel strongly that a move toward the universal does not always have to be simple or naive. We refuse to underestimate the potential of the international. Indeed, the relationships among ideas of cinema as a universal language, the uneven international flows of films and audiences, and the changing geopolitics of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries strike us as a uniquely rich intersection for the analysis of cinema, politics, and geography. Where film studies has mostly rejected universality as ideologically tainted, art cinema secretes away a valuation of its powers. (Dudley Andrew articulates this impetus very clearly, and his engagement of art cine- maâs desire for the universal surely contributes to his centrality in the scholarship of art cinema.21) The fantasy of transparent transcultural exchange nourished the impulse in the 1920s to see cinema as a vehicle for international comprehension, and it continues\n\nP:36\n\nIntroduction 11to construct the transnational articulation of art cinema.22 The criticism is almost tooeasy to makeâof course we cannot have transparent exchange across cultures and trans-parency is too often a cover for dominant hegemony of late capitalismâbut what do wedo with filmmakers who reject cynicism and continue to ask foreign audiences to seetheir films? Art cinema traces a history of attempts at cross-cultural communicationeven in the face of its impossibility. The films of Ray or Im Kwon-taek persistentlyengage the concept of universality even in the experience of its inadequacy or lack.In this respect, art cinema mobilizes artâs traditional function of giving expression tothat which is otherwise inexpressible. The impossibility of transparent cross-culturallegibility is just another way of describing what art (cinema) does. Another way of thinking this problem is to propose that the international address,circulation, and content of art cinema enables us to think about the global, focusing ourattention on issues of world. Art cinema demands that we watch across cultures and seeourselves through foreign eyes, binding spectatorship and pleasure into an experienceof geographical difference, or potentially of geopolitical critique. But these productivefeatures of art cinema also work to draw our attention to the perils of thinking theglobal. As much as art cinema holds out a promise of international community, itstands to be recuperated into dominant circuits of capital, stereotype, and imperialistvision. Therefore, it is imperative to analyze its terms of geographical engagement,thinking closely about the formations and deformations of art cinematic space. Theseweighted histories and practices of framing demand that we think carefully about ter-minology. How should we describe art cinemaâs geopolitics: as âglobal,â âworld,â orâinternationalâ? Clearly, between the Eurocentrism of art cinemaâs emergence to theglobal flows of the film festival circuit, the choice of words carries significant baggage. This book is titled Global Art Cinema, and the word âglobalâ perhaps excites moreconceptual anxiety than any of the other terms. It speaks to the all-encompassing natureof an art cinema that exists around the globe, but it might also imply an imperialist orglobalized contamination of political space. The rhetoric of a global cinema could indi-cate an economic model and hence a capitalist or Hollywood-centric one. Many criticsof globalization reject the term: Gayatri Spivak, for example, counters the digitalizationand instrumentalism of globalized thinking with the more collectivist term âplanetar-ity,â which she finds more sensitive to the local, the material, and the powerless.23To pay proper attention to the terrain of cinema and its pathways of privilege, we mightfeel similarly reluctant to take on the geopolitical connotations of the global. However, the alternative words available are hardly less ambivalent. âWorldâ artcinema, like âworld cinema,â could enable the kind of postcolonial revision of canonssometimes implied by âworld literature.â24 Or it could suggest a cosmopolitanism thatlooks usefully beyond the scope of the nation, or less usefully, erases material andpolitical boundaries.25 Worse, it might bespeak a fetishistic multiculturalism similar tothat often implied by âworld music.â âWorldâ as a modifier suggests at worst a Puta-mayo world of commodified and sanitized exoticism, and at best an emerging scholarlydiscourse of world cinema in which âworldâ does not mean the whole world but thoseareas outside of Europe and North America.26 (Ironically, cinemaâs supposed univer-salism has, to some degree, saved film studies from the easy Anglocentrism of literary\n\nP:37\n\n12 Introduction fields, but films from the global South are still often confined to âworld cinemaâ classes.) As a code for nonwhite or non-Western, âworldâ can hint at a troublingly unexamined liberalism. The term âinternationalâ opens out onto a different history of canonical exclusion and inclusion. Through much of film history, international film was a limited cate- gory, including West European films for the most part, and only recently expanding to encompass African, Latin American, and a wide range of Asian films. âInternation- alist,â of course, must be seen as a subheading or side note to the international, bringing a useful political demand that these categories not be simply descriptive terms but rather active agents of meaning. Internationalism understands the circula- tion of films across national borders as a political act, as with the European leftist groups who helped circulate Soviet modernism or the commitment to international cinema in the years following the Cuban revolution. While the Marxist history of inter- nationalism might not always fit snugly with our analysis of global art cinema, its demand for a geopolitics of cinema remains an important spur. Ultimately, none of these words is perfectly and unproblematically adequate to fulfill our needs, although the debates engendered by the terms do delineate sharply the contested terrain of art cinema as a geopolitical term. Our current historical moment asks more pressingly than ever: How does one think the categories of global culture? If art cinema instantiates an optimism about the possibility of speaking across cultures, the early twenty-first century seems inclined to dash that optimism. Postwar histories of art cinema focus on successive waves of new wavesâas if cinema could perform the infinite expansion foundational to capitalist growth. This model is articulated in the cosmopolitan audience who always had more auteurs and national cinemas to discover. Likewise the era of decolonization promised a postcolonial openness to the world, as audiences forged new relationships with film- producing nations. (Of course, it goes without saying that we describe here a set of myths and fantasies as much as any empirical history of movie-going. Nonetheless, it seems clear that art cinema benefited from dominant postwar modes of capitalist expansion and ideologies of cross-cultural openness and cosmopolitanism.) But where does this ethos of art cinematic openness go in the post-9/11 world of anxious global- ization, economic recession, and environmental crisis, where cultural transits are something to fear and the doctrine of infinite expansion is finally reaching a breaking point in the economic and environmental spheres? Notions of increased global net- working that not long ago sounded utopian now evoke terror, and international travel becomes increasingly policed by race, class, and corporeal and national demarcation. On this emerging world stage, ideas about cultural globality must surely respond, as will the material conditions of cinematic spectatorship. Historical and Ahistorical Impulses Art cinema has been an enabling concept for film historiography and has been a par- ticularly forceful concept in the writing of national and auteur-based film histories. In\n\nP:38\n\nIntroduction 13tension or even contradiction with this historicizing tendency, though, the term evokesa certain timelessness that has been equally persistent in both the scholarly discourseand popular usage of art cinema. Ideas of art cinema as a textual practice remain fairlystatic, from pop cultural clichÃ©s of ponderous dialogue to critical regimes of valuearound what constitutes cinematic âart.â This sense of art cinema as unchanging mightnot be accurate, but it nonetheless operates as a mode of institutional exchange, a waythat films can promote themselves as part of an already constituted cultural space. Wecan illustrate this ambivalence by considering one of the ways in which new art cinemaobjects enter into the field: the discovery of an emergent national new wave via two orthree films in the international festival circuit. Thus, in the 1990s, Iranian cinemabecame big news with Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Abbas Kiarostami, and Jafar Panahishowing films across the international festival circuit: The new Iranian cinema rapidlyentered into the art cinema canon. More recently, the 2000s saw the emergence of anew Romanian realism, with Cristi Puiuâs Moartea domnului Lazarescu / The Death ofMr. Lazarescu (2005) showing at Cannes and Toronto, and Cristian Mungiuâs 4 luni, 3saptamÃ¢ni si 2 zile / Four Months, Three Weeks and Two Days winning the Palme dâOr in2007. The category of art cinema enables audiences and festival programmers toprocess these new films, assimilating them to already proven means of engaging unfa-miliar texts. Perhaps it is this assimilation process that troubles those scholars whoreject the category. After all, it appears to mirror the structures of cosmopolitan conse-cration associated with the flattening impulses of neocolonialism and westernizationin the late twentieth century. Despite, or perhaps because of these politics, films con-tinue to follow this trajectory of âgoing international.â Audiences who might have littlespecific prior interest in Romanian culture or film history are drawn to the films as thelatest must-see festival prizewinners. The experience offered is not located in director,star, or nationality but is constructed as a similar pleasure to that of previous ânewâ artcinemas. And the thrill of discovery for those audiences eagerly consuming the nextbig thing repeats a fantasy at the heart of art cinema: that of making the transformativediscovery of neorealism. The structure is ahistorical, in the sense that each new cinemais a repetition of the ever-same fantasy, and any new national cinema can becomethe vehicle for this fantasy. At the same time, the structure is decidedly historical,since Iranian or Romanian cinemas emerge from specific material historicalcircumstances and cannot be reduced to a critical or distributive cycle. The newRomanian cinema, for example, emerges at the same moment that Romania joinsthe European Union: The cinematic and geopolitical institutions interconnect in atemporally and materially legible manner. Furthermore, the question of whichnational cinemas are brought into the art cinema fold and at what historical juncturecorrelates to structures of uneven development and postcolonial power. Here, his-tory and ahistory are mutually implicated: if the pleasure of art cinema is one ofrepetition it is also one of difference, and, like genre, the interplay of these elementsforms a defining dynamic. Historicist accounts have formed a central mode of accessing art cinema as ascholarly category. Film histories have traditionally emphasized the development ofnational cinemas, with art cinema directors and movements forming the backbone of\n\nP:39\n\n14 Introduction many such narratives. In part, the notional canon of art cinema is created simply by cherry-picking the major names out of national film histories that narrate Youssef Chahine, Andrei Tarkovsky, or Edward Yang as significant directors.27 And while some of this work might be viewed as mere canon formation, these approaches also enable scholarship that examines the complex transits between film movements and political or economic histories. Historical studies have also made visible transnational trajec- tories of influence, tracking, for example, Luis BuÃ±uelâs movement from European surrealism to the commercial idiom of his Mexican films. Patrick Keatingâs essay in this collection addresses this question with regard to Mexican cinematography. Or, traveling in the other direction, we might trace the engagement of Glauber Rocha with Catalan filmmakers in the 1960s.28 Such comparative or relational studies suggest how industrial issues and modes of production intersect with supra- or transnational his- tories. Thus, postcolonial studies consider how colonial history inflects the influence of Euro-American art film on Indian and sub-Saharan African cinemas and vice versa.29 And we should not omit the tremendous importance of history as a textual subject of art cinema: Filmmakers such as Ousmane Sembene and Rainer Werner Fassbinder have taken the formal interrogation of their national and colonial histories as a cine- matic and historiographic project. However, while art cinema has been a prominent element in many film histories, the category itself has been inadequately historicized. While the turn to industrial his- tory in film studies led to a rigorous body of scholarship on the inseparability of Hol- lywoodâs modes of production and its narrational forms, and to some such work on various national cinemas, art cinema as such has rarely been investigated in this way. Too often, the usage of the term âart cinemaâ assumes an unchanging and obvious object. As Mark Betz has noted, âWhile economic and industrial approaches to the history of Hollywood cinema are a matter of course in Anglo-American film studies, such approaches remain rare in the historiography of European art cinema.â30 This lack of historical analysis is an issue that this volume aims to address, but there is something more at stake here than simply a gap in the scholarship. There is a particu- larity to the way that art cinema has been constituted as a category that prompts audi- ences and critics to imagine it as ahistorical. Its lure to audiences has changed much less over the postwar era than we might expect with such a large field of production and consumption. Its persistence as a category in general circulation holds open a unique communicative space across historical contexts. While not as formally coherent as clas- sicism, art cinema shares with it a sense of constituting a broad modality of cinema, seemingly always available to filmmakers and audiences alike. Thus, while the value of historical scholarship on art cinema is evident, its ahistorical qualities might be equally productive in defining the flexible appeal of the category. In fact, a refusal of traditional historicism might be a way to avoid replicating the ethnocentric bias embedded in art cinemaâs unidirectional trajectories or waves. The valuable revisions to the history of cultural transmission mentioned previously offer a hiatus from the larger sweep of the art house-as-assimilator model. This complication of historicism allows us to account for art cinema without reifying west-to-east patterns of âdevelopment,â endorsing naive fantasies of cultural universalism, or reproducing the cultural hegemony of Western\n\nP:40\n\nIntroduction 15spectator. We find both of these impulses (the historical and the ahistorical) to beintegral to art cinema, and, indeed, we think that its specificity lies in its ability to main-tain these apparently opposite qualities in a productive tension. Realist and Modernist ImpulsesThe quarrel between realism and modernism has been one of the sustaining aestheticdebates of the twentieth century. In cinema, the divide produced many of the key con-ceptual models of the cinematic image, including AndrÃ© Bazinâs realism and Screenjournalâs modernist Marxism. Likewise, in film practice, avowedly realist movementssuch as poetic realism and neorealism jostled for canonical status with modernistcounter-cinemas and new waves. However, in recent years, critical theorists and filmhistorians have increasingly argued for the interconnection of these cinematic modes,sometimes even finding that the two sides of the divide look surprisingly alike. Writingon Italian neorealism, Frederic Jameson exposes the imbrications of realism, modernism,and postmodernism. Miriam Hansenâs work, both on Siegfried Kracauer and in herconception of âvernacular modernism,â finds the modernist project engrained in re-alism and classicism.31 Art cinema plays an important role in this critical history,because, as a category, it has often yoked these otherwise incommensurate traditionstogether, and in doing so it often negotiated, merged, and complicated these com-peting impulses for audiences. On the one hand, art cinema has often been coterminous with specific realistmovements. Art cinemaâs cohesion as a category first emerges with the popularity ofItalian neorealism, and it retains a close association with the thematic and aestheticimpulses of that postwar tradition. Even several decades after neorealism, art filmscontinue to grant priority to the downtrodden, the underdog, and the abjected mem-bers of human communities. They take as a moral prerogative the representation ofthe underrepresented; these films embrace the socially excluded, including working-class subjects (Kidlat Tahimik, Ken Loach), national subjects (Hany Abu-Assad, HaileGerima), and sexual minorities (Gregg Araki, Deepa Mehta). Realismâs claim to makevisible what otherwise goes unseen meshes with art cinemaâs attempt to represent theforbidden or unspeakable. Hence the appropriation of realist style by recent Iranianand French cinema (Samira Makhmalbaf, Laurence Cantet) to critique national genderand class economies. Art cinema promotes itself as uncensored, revealing what com-mercial cinema deems unfit for general consumption. From Roberto RosselliniâsRoma, cittÃ aperta / Rome Open City (1945) to Park Chan-wookâs Oldeuboi / Oldboy(2003), the industrial history of exploitation and titillation intersects with textual stra-tegies of realism, grounding art cinemaâs theoretical claims to truth in the revelation ofthe imperiled or impassioned body. On the other hand, art cinema has been closely associated with modernism. In delin-eating art cinema as an institutional practice, Neale argues that if, as conventional perspec-tives posit, cinema is a novelistic mediumâan extension of a particular literary genreâthen art films are modernist novels and Hollywood films are popular genres. As with\n\nP:41\n\n16 Introduction artistic modernism, then art cinema defines itself largely in opposition to dominant re- alisms. What the nineteenth-century novel is to modernist literature, classical Holly- wood is to art cinema. As in theoretical accounts of modernism, art cinema explores subjectivity and temporality in ways that frustrate or attenuate classical Hollywood nar- rative. Art films delight in precisely the things tossed away or willfully ignored by Holly- wood, repurposing the detritus of the industrial model of storytellingâs efficiency and tightness. The art film extends its modernist tendencies in its privileging of internal conflicts, self-reflexivity, extradiegetic gestures, and duration over empiricist models of knowledge and pleasure (Michelangelo Antonioni, Tsai Ming-liang, Bergman). These modernist impulses have led some critics to deem the art film overly for- malist, pretentious, and self-aggrandizing. LâannÃ©e derniÃ¨re Ã Marienbad / Last Year at Marienbad (Resnais, 1961) is an easy target here. Despite its popularity with art-house audiences in the early 1960s, the filmâs tone strikes many viewers today as impossibly slow, wastefully loose, and artistically decadent. To many casual viewers, its mixture of pompous affect, labyrinthine uncertainty, and lack of humor feels anachronistic and self-important to the point of silliness. Probably because of the obdurate seriousness of its elaborate and aristocratic formal language, Marienbad may be the most difficult major art film of the period to redeem today, a summation of art cinemaâs modernist misdemeanors. However, when watched in the context of Alain Resnaisâs more explic- itly political work or of recent films that lay bare the racializing logic of contemporary European history (the Dardenne brothers or Michael Haneke), the filmâs overwrought tenor trembles with the psychic aftershocks of French political repression at the end of the colonial era. The ambiguities and ambivalences formally indulged by this film reg- ister the violent bifurcation of French national subjectivity during the colonial and neocolonial periods. Films such as La Noire de . . . / Black Girl (Sembene, 1966) or ClÃ©o de 5 Ã 7 / Cleo from 5 to 7 (Varda, 1962) could be seen to offer alternate accounts of the same subjective instabilities. The highly aestheticized horror of Georges Franjuâs Les Yeux sans visage / Eyes without a Face (1960) similarly plays with a postwar French desire to disappear bodies, identities, and the past. As these examples demonstrate, even in its most enigmatic permutations art cinema has formed a space in which to negotiate the historical challenges of realism and modernism, and we contend that it presents an opportunity to interrogate the continued influence and significance of these concepts in film studies. If it is now no longer necessary to choose sides in the battle between realism and modernism, then art cinema is perhaps one key site where the tension of that binary opposition has slackened. Bordwellâs influential essay on art cinema tries to define the category not as an institution or a genre but as an aesthetic practice. He begins his essay with a description of two features that characterize this practice: realism and authorial presence. The first he links with neorealism, while the latter presents itself through a series of modernist tropes. Bordwell then tells us that these two qualities are actually in conflict within the film text. How can a film that turns itself over to the real also be the work of a single self-aware consciousness? To remedy this contradiction, he observes, the art film must introduce a third key quality: ambiguity. What is interesting here is how art cinema is posed as a unique formal practice that can reconcile the\n\nP:42\n\nIntroduction 17long-standing tension between otherwise discrete artistic movements. Art cinemaemerges as a hybrid form that allows realism and modernism to co-exist within onetext. It is not a practice of the same order as the other two, but more like a compositemode, a rubric that is able to yoke together disparate modes of expression and, hence,may be uniquely equipped to address equally incommensurate modes of experienceand engagement. If we are to return to our definitional impurity, we might say that therealism of an art film is never exclusively realist, because filmâs narration remains alwaysinflected by the admission of a modernist sensibility. At the same time, its modernismcan never achieve absolute purity because it remains tinged by realist tendencies. Artcinema draws our attention to the persistent inadequacy of these terms, especially intheir constantly melodramatic binary opposition. Not only do we not have to pick sides,but art cinema operates in a dialectical (or at least triangulating) fashion that demandsthat we overcome the binary debate. Impurity emerges not only as a constitutive elementin the history of art cinemaâs style, but also as a profound statement about the place ofart cinema within a larger history of cinemaâs shifting function and place in the world. The Art in Art CinemaArt cinema most often names a postwar object of study, but the term echoes move-ments, discourses, and constituencies circulating in 1920s and 1930s Europe, Asia, andthe Americas. The early twentieth century, for example, saw a proliferation of argumentsfor the inclusion of cinema as legitimate art, including those of D. W. Griffith,Ricciotto Canudo, Vachel Lindsay, Rudolf Arnheim, Erwin Panofsky, Iris Barry, and thewriters associated with Close-Up. Early theories of cinematic specificity asked whatdefined cinema as a unique form of expression. Drawing from works of aesthetic theorysuch as Gotthold Ephraim Lessingâs LaocoÃ¶n, this scholarship defined film as an art, andhence located its study within major pathways of thought in the humanities. These crit-ical assertions of cinema as âThe Seventh Artâ coincided with the emergence of innova-tive practices of narrative film. In the years preceding the establishment of synch-soundas an industrial standard, a series of debates erupted about the best language for cinema.While rarely reaching agreement, these formal innovators often aimed for the samegoal: a new means of cinematic expression that would allow for both maximum expres-sivity and universal comprehension. The film as art became a concept important foridentifying what Andrew Tudor calls artistically distinctive cinema practices, lending acertain cohesion to a diverse set of films and in turn enabling the international recogni-tion of specific directors (C. Th. Dreyer, Jean Epstein) as well as stylistic movements(German Expressionism, French Impressionism).32 Unpacking the postwar conceptionof art cinema, then, presents a historiographic challenge not only because it refers toprecursors drawn from various facets of interwar film culture, but also because the termconflates the discourse on cinema as an art with the specific textual practices of artisticfilm movements. Writers advocating for âThe Seventh Artâ and interwar filmmakersshared a tendency to collapse theoretical questions of cinema with favored forms andstyles. The way in which later concepts of art cinema confuse medium (cinema as art)\n\nP:43\n\n18 Introduction with film practice (art films) is understandable, because the interwar debates understood these areas as mutually imbricated. We can find the legacy of this imbrication in the more recent usage of the word. Art cinema emerges as a series of movements and practices, but it can also be seen as a way of thinking about the aesthetics of the image. The first approach enables us to interrogate and integrate important film movements. Here, art cinema stands as an umbrella cate- gory able to contain and connect various subsets: a series of new waves, a cohort of national cinemas, a collection of schools or approaches. Perhaps more important, but underemphasized, is the second usage in which art cinema asks us to think about the status of the image in cinema. As Basil Wrightâs epigraph to Raymond Spottiswoodeâs technical handbook puts it, âDespite the sound track, [cinema] is an art because it is visual.â33 Barbara Klinger, one of the few recent film scholars to recognize the urgent need for an aesthetic theory of art cinema, argues that the category has always asserted one predominant feature despite its hard-to-pin-down nature: âthe spectacular, enig- matic, and captivating image.â In other words, Klinger suggests that a characteristically overabundant visuality constitutes the art of art cinema.34 Like Klingerâs own work, the essays in this collection engage that image head-on, refusing to dismiss art cinemaâs for- mal surpluses as semantically bankrupt, aesthetically decadent, or simply apolitical. Art cinema has never been simply an empirical label, an arbitrary moniker, or an empty placeholder. Instead, both the term and its referent have grown in the cracks of film history, sprouting up from the fault lines of theoretical writings on film and histories of specific film practices. To understand the term, we must explore the histo- ricity of applying the word âartâ to the cinema. Terminologically, the artâcinema couplet continues to express its constitutive confusionâa conflation of intermedial claims (cin- emaâs aesthetic affinities to other media or art forms) and intramedial claims (how to best develop an aesthetics of cinema). This confusion not only obfuscates the term, but also contributes to its association with elitism, which raises a final concern. Part of art cinemaâs stigma is its perceived irrelevance: While critics have argued for realism, postcoloniality, or genre as engines of social and cultural change, art cinema has not been mobilized as such a conceptually productive category. Modernism has been understood in these terms, but while a director such as Jean-Luc Godard is credited with political and aesthetic radicality, his status as counter-cinematic (part of Peter Wollenâs European avant-garde) separates him from the main body of art cinema in terms of his modernist political form. For some Marxist critics art cinema per se is merely reflective of bourgeois values, while for scholars of popular culture it lacks the mass audience appeal that would make it culturally significant. In part, this problem derives from a willingness by previous studies of art cinema to concede that the term âartâ speaks mostly of high cultureâand thus signals class bias and an exclusionary attitude. Art is too readily banished from discussions of film as popular or mass cul- ture. Indeed, we find the ready acceptance of bourgeois conceptions of autonomous art to be a troubling facet of much discourse on art cinema. In this book, we have tried to remain sensitive to how elitist and ethnocentric impulses may haunt the category of art cinema. Nonetheless, we refuse to accept a narrow definition of art and insist on main- taining art as an experience available to all.35\n\nP:44\n\nIntroduction 19 Claims and ConclusionsWhile most previous accounts of art cinema have tended to privilege either extratex-tual, industrial features or histories of style and form, the approaches in this bookrepresent a move away from purely institutional or formalist definitions. While styleand mode of production remain crucial to our contributors, they refuse to regardimage, industry, and politics as separate spheres. The crucial influence of Nealeâs def-initional essay can be felt in the various methodologies of this book. Looking back atthe shape of this seminal essay, we find that its claims for art cinema as an institutionbegin by isolating the key aesthetic features of films in this category. One such featureis how the art film goes to great lengths to mark images reflexively as images. In thelarger sweep of the argument, holding out the image for attention in this way is criticalbecause Neale argues that art films depend on marking themselves as works of art. Inother words, only as a vessel of self-expression will the art film be able to achieve dif-ferentiation and commercial viability in a market dominated by Hollywood products.The art film requires its images to belie a self-conscious quality, and in this overtself-awareness, the art film links itself to the attitude present in much twentieth-century art. Here we are reminded of Nowell-Smithâs caveat that the art referenced bythe term âart cinemaâ carries a distinctly twentieth-century understanding of the artis-tic. In fact, we can further specify this historical reminder. If we are to introduce awider historical perspective to Nealeâs model, it becomes clear that the art filmâs long-term differentiation depends on its ability continually to transform the means ofdemarcation, shifting them to compensate for stylistic cooptation, technological inno-vation, shifts in access, and ever-morphing tastes and fashions. For example, during the 1960s and 1970s, the zoom might constitute one legibleand circulable sign of the art film. While it is true that the zoom was used widely byother genres, including mainstream popular cinema, kung-fu movies, and the avant-garde, it served as a widely recognizable marker of the art cinemaâs identity. Sembeneand Visconti use the zoom frequently to draw spectatorial awareness to image, andthus to figure the imageâs rich conceptual productivity. In the work of these directors,the zoom might indulge the excesses of the mise-en-scÃ¨ne, allow the most agile appre-hension of movement, reorganize the spatialization of history in the image, and/ordenaturalize the knowledge provided in looking. In Bordwell and Kristin Thompsonâsgeneral primer on cinematic form, Film Art, the authors discuss how certain specialtechniques are associated with particular types of cinema. For them, the zoom or tele-photo effects were originally thought to be part of the syntax of sports and news filmsbut quickly became associated with art films. The zoom âflatten[ed the image] in blockslike a painting.â36 If we carry the analysis further, the zoom reveals a fascinating historyof aesthetics and politics. Although the technology of the zoom has been availablesince the 1920s, Paul Willemen writes that it was not until after the Second World Warand the zoomâs extensive use in aerial surveillance that it began to infiltrate the spaceof fiction film in the mid-1950s, and thus to coincide with the postwar rise of artcinema. In fact, Willemen goes so far as to claim that the zoom âre-activates the questionof the public sphere and its re-configuration consequent to the triumph of capitalism in\n\nP:45\n\n20 Introduction the second half of the twentieth century . . . as well as raising the question of what hap- pens to modes of discourse in the process of modernisation itself.â37 Imbedded in this one technique, then, we find a complex interaction of art, cinema, technology, and global politics. How could we understand Pier Paolo Pasoliniâs use of the zoom in Il fiore delle mille e una notte / Arabian Nights (1974) without engaging the histories of postcolonial- ity, the flatness of baroque painting, the gaze of anthropology, lightweight/low-budget camera technology, and the realist poetics of art cinema? The category of art cinema demands more than merely inflecting industrial history with a light dusting of theoretical concerns. We propose that the category of art cinema can only be mapped with an approach that intersects industry, history, and textuality. Furthermore, we believe that art cinemaâs specificity emerges in a relationship between art and global. Hence, the title of this volume is not merely descriptive but definitional, even polemical. âGlobalâ is not a subset of art cinema but an inherent element, along- side and interpenetrating âartâ and âcinema.â To understand the category, we must interrogate each of these terms as mutually dependent. The term âglobalâ speaks to the international address, distribution, audience, and aesthetic language of the art cinema. This globality is, however, enabled by the term âart,â which connects ideas about the status of the image to international aesthetic, critical, and industrial institutions. This connection is not univocally positive: art cinema might refer to an imperialist flattening out of differences as easily as it identifies sites of resistance. Indeed, the push and pull between these tendencies is another way to name the dynamism of the field. However, we make two further claims on the political significance of our defini- tion. First, while art cinema traverses the political spectrum, our definition of how aesthetics and geopolitics work together in its construction allows for new and more nuanced analyses to be made. The commonplace dismissal of art film as wholly con- servative is thus inadequate, and we seek to overthrow it. If we settle for the reductive version of art cinema as an always already compromised or disappointing practice, then we risk missing significant arrangements of aesthetics and geopolitics that underlieâand perhaps can be diagnosed exclusively throughâeven the most reac- tionary of art films. Second, we believe that art cinema has been underestimated as a site for political and theoretical work. Given that contemporary film studies remains deeply concerned by both the nature of the film image and the global geopolitics of cinema, it is odd that the discipline has largely ignored art cinema as a nexus for crit- ical engagement with cinematic globality. While it may be tempting to regard art cinemaâs emphasis on the aesthetic as apolitical, we argue that by connecting the cinematic image to international spaces, it inherently makes a political claim. Art ci- nema is both an aesthetic categoryâinvolved in broadly constituted debates on re- alism, modernism, the image, and its implicationsâand a geopolitical category, bound up in modernity and the traumas of twentieth-century history. We feel strongly that the categoryâs enduring relevance derives from this combination of elements and their persistent remixing. Moreover, we propose that the study of art cinema provides an important lens through which to interrogate the consequences of globalization, whether this means programmatic ideologies or the experience of living in a world community.\n\nP:46\n\nIntroduction 21 Sections of the BookFrom its earliest conceptions, the goal of this anthology was to approach art cinemaâsgeography from a variety of critical methodologies. Since the category has been soundertheorized, it seems crucial to revitalize the field by placing contestatory modes ofanalysis into productive relation. By bringing these approaches together in one vol-ume, we aim to provoke a conversation of ideas on art cinema, as well as find unex-pected connections and nourish lively debate. Each of the authors takes on a specifictopic in the field of art cinema, from individual films and directors to broad questionsof genre or nation. At the same time, however, we believe that the essays all make sig-nificant contributions to larger contemporary debates in film theory and historiogra-phy about the global character of cinema. The essays in the first section of the book tackle the demarcation of art cinemaâscategorical terrain. For over fifty years, art cinema has defined how many audiencesencounter commercial films produced"
