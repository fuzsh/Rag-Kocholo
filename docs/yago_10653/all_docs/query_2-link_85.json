        "text": "Post by dsbeadle on\n\nWelcome to the weekly watch thread hosted by me, post your weeks viewing, rate other peoples viewing, have conversations but be respectful.\n\nFIRST TIME VIEWING\n\nHorizon: An American Saga - Part One (2024, Kevin Costner)\n\nThis epic independent Western film is the first of four 3 hour films. Overall there is a little more story than most would have you believe. It just doesn’t have the structure of a movie, it just ends after one of the story strands has a scene.\n\nIt’s interesting that it’s beautifully shot with great set pieces but there is no focus on character or story yet that the tense scenes don’t mean as much as they could’ve otherwise. Despite this I still found many parts powerful and have this as my favorite film\n\nof the year so far.\n\n7.5/10\n\nVanished into the Night (2024, Renato De Maria)\n\nNetflix\n\nThis Low budget thriller follows a father who is immersed in a difficult divorce process, embarking on a dangerous mission when his children disappear from their isolated country house. It is a passable enough time waster but it’s not good.\n\n4.5/10\n\nREPEAT VIEWING\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back (1980, Irvin Kershner)\n\n4K UHD\n\nThe standard bearer for Star Wars.\n\n9.5/10\n\nTrue Lies (1994, James Cameron)\n\nblu ray\n\nFun overblown action comedy with a great cast.\n\n7.5-8/10\n\nFIRST TIME DOCUMENTARY VIEWING\n\nCapturing the Friedmans (2003, Andrew Jarecki)\n\nYoutube\n\nDocumentary on the Friedmans, a seemingly typical, upper-middle-class Jewish family whose world is instantly transformed when the father and his youngest son are arrested and charged with shocking and horrible crimes.\n\nGood Documentary\n\nFIRST TIME TV VIEWING\n\nHappy Days: 30th Anniversary Reunion (2005)\n\nYouTube\n\nA much better and more heartfelt version of the 1992 Reunion Special\n\nGood TV\n\nThe Acolyte (2024, Season One)\n\nDisney+\n\nWell this is a show robust with bad writing, a misunderstanding of the universe they were writing in and mostly bad acting bar a few characters.\n\nGarbage TV\n\nREPEAT TV VIEWING\n\nHappy Days Reunion Special (1992)\n\nYouTube\n\nThe cast of the hit ABC-TV series Happy Days (1974) reunites to talk about their memories of the show and how it affected their personal and professional lives. The show's producer, Garry Marshall, is also interviewed, and clips from past episodes are shown, along with outtakes that never made it into the show.\n\nAverage TV\n\nWEEKLY FILM AWARDS\n\nBEST FILM: The Empire Strikes Back\n\nBEST ACTOR: Harrison Ford - The Empire Strikes Back\n\nBEST ACTRESS: Jamie Lee Curtis - True Lies\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR: Bill Paxton - True lies\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS: Abbey Lee - Horizon\n\nBEST CINEMATOGRAPHY: J. Michael Muro - Horizon\n\nBEST SCORE: John Williams - The Empire Strikes Back\n\nBEST EDITING: Paul Hirsch, George Lucas- The Empire Strikes Back\n\nBEST WRITING: George Lucas, Lawrence Kasdan - The Empire Strikes Back\n\nBEST DIRECTOR: Irvin Kershner - The Empire Strikes Back\n\nPost by Teleadm on\n\nThanks for hosting dsbeadle\n\nFrom your list...\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back (1980) remember this from cinema, and public went out in anger feeling cheated. It didn't have the Wow feeling of the first movie. Seeing the first trilogy it made more sense in row. still don't like it, 6,5/10.\n\nTrue Lies 1994, one of those relax and enjoy the ride movies, 7/10. Never seen the French original.\n\nHere are my latest...\n\nGone Girl 2014 directed by David Fincher and based on a novel by Gillian Flynn who also wrote the screenplay.\n\nMarried man's wife disappears, it all turns into a media circus. The married man first gains loads of sympathy that will later turn into hate, and what happened to the wife... was he married to a heartless calculating femme fatale...\n\nWhile the movie certainly is well-made with many smart set-up's and clues, I wasn't satisfied with the ending that let too many questions hanging in the air. 7/10.\n\nBernie 2011 directed by Richard Linklater and based on real events and an article by Skip Hollandsworth.\n\nBernie pops up from nowhere in a small Texas town, and as a feeling and caring mortician he melts the hearts of nearly everyone in town except angry rich widow. Trying to melt the heart of the rich widow he also starts to loose himself, he soon finds himself trapped in the black widows net, and kills her...\n\nFrom the director and star of \"School of Rock\" I had expected something better and more even if the story here is a bit darker.\n\nThe movie uses a semi-documentary frame with interviews with those who knew the real Bernie, but that sadly makes the flow of the movie too much hacksawed and it loses focus for the viewer. 6/10.\n\nThe Executioner 1970 directed by Sam Wanamaker.\n\nA late-comer of the 60's secret agent craze, that also produced some serious spy movies, not all of them where camp, though this is not one of the better serious ones, but not a disaster either.\n\nGeorge Peppard plays a British agent, schooled in America explains his accent, who suspects a double agent within British Intelligence.\n\nHis superiors tells him to stay away from it, so offcourse he does the opposite...\n\nMade more interesting by a bunch of great supporting actors plus Joan Collins and Judy Geeson. 6/10.\n\nJudex 1963 directed by Georges Franju and based on old French cliffhanger serials of the 1910's and 1920's by Louis Feuillade.\n\nSince this is an homage to old French cliffhanger serials, one shouldn't look too much for any logic and just enjoy the ride even if it slows down from time to time.\n\nJudex is the good person who nearly looks like Zorro and hides in a batcave-like cave under a Chateau ruin with advanced technology for 1920's.
