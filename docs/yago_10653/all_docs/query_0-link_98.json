H . D ow ning, John T. Jones, Jr., Centennial Professor in Communication, University of Texas at Austin The struggle to forge a collective national identity at the expense of competing plural identities has preoccupied Israeli society since the founding of the state of Israel. In this book, Yosefa Loshitzky explores how major Israeli films of the 1980s and 1990s have contributed significantly to the process of identity formation by reflecting, projecting, and constructing debates around Israeli national identity.

Read this volume as you would watch a masterfully cut trailer of coming attractions, and note the names of films and filmmakers, all grandmasters of their art.

At first I had a hard time winning recognition and acceptance, and I owe a lot to foreign critics like Jean-Louis Bory, who organized screenings of my films at UNESCO Headquarters in Paris. It was a way of paying tribute to the work being done in a country like Egypt, whose cinema was usually regarded with condescension rather than admiration. Many people in Europe thought that all we could do was make light comedies—with belly dancing scenes, obviously—though some of us were working hard and making more worthwhile films, often on shoestring budgets. That is why I feel I am sharing my prize with all the film-makers from poor countries who are still having great difficulty in making films in their own countries.

Persevering against all odds, they have established a rich heritage of extraordinary films. Time and again they have offered fresh perspectives on crucial issues confronting the region by giving image and voice to dissident views. We dedicate the book to them. I thank the eighteen contributors from three continents who agreed to join our venture, endured my unending demands, responded to my critical comments, and taught me a great deal. I am grateful to the directors and producers who provided me with films, illustrations, and information. This collection grew out of a course I developed at the University of Connecticut in response to the aftermath of 9/11, the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and the ongoing debate over the Israel/Palestine conflict. I am greatly indebted to Lynne Gladstein, who encouraged me to teach this course in the Honors Program, to a large number of colleagues who readily agreed to participate when the course morphed into a film and lecture series, and to my students whose comments and questions wonderfully concentrated my mind. Many people helped along the way. Jim Burr at University of Texas Press has been most supportive from the time when we first discussed this project. But for the wizardry of Alex Bothell, many illustrations would be in worse shape; others would have been abandoned altogether as unsuitable for printing. My special thanks to Livia Alexander, Salma Abu Ayyash, Talat Azimi, Lana Babij, Stephen Bustamente, Daniel Buttrey, Maha Darawsha, Mohamed Faizal, Niloo Fotouhi, Nadia Hlibka, Janet Jordan, Géraldine Le Chêne, Gérard Le Chêne, Joseph Natale, Dominique Olier, Rasha Salti, Lynn Sweet, and Alex Williams, who assisted me in various ways. I cherish the support my wife and our daughters gave me in spite of my sins of absence and distraction as I allowed myself to be absorbed by this endeavor. Children are prominently featured in many films from the region; for them all royalties will be donated to UNICEF.

I realized that what was needed for us to achieve social justice and freedom is cultural change—to change people’s perceptions of one another, and their perception of power. M o h s e n M a k h m a l b a f (1997, in Béar 2008, 124)\n\nImages and voices from the Middle East and the Maghreb are little seen and heard abroad. As far as films are concerned, some are feted at film festivals, but only a few are shown in art houses and on select television channels, and home video distribution remains extremely limited.1 Western productions dominate the screens of the world, and the political consequences are serious—most especially for a region as deeply embroiled in conflict with Western interests as the Middle East.2 The lack of public interest parallels a dearth of scholarly attention, with the notable exceptions of Iran and Israel. Not a single scholarly article has been devoted to many of the films featured in this volume.3 Films from the Middle East offer representations at variance with those that predominate in much of the Western media. Locally produced stories and images call into question common assumptions about the region’s history, cultures, and people. Such films demonstrate commonalities and differences across a region that is all too often subject to unwarranted generalizations. Analysis of the economic, political, and cultural contexts in which directors produce them reveals the complexity of societies that tend to be characterized rather superficially from afar.\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 1\n\n11/2/10 11:11:36 AM\n\nJosef Gugler\n\nNine essays present the region’s major national cinemas.4 They devote special attention to the work of directors who have given image and voice to dissent from the discourses of authoritarian regimes, of patriarchy, of fundamentalist movements, and of the West. They explore the interactions of the aspirations of directors, the pressures exerted by producers and sponsors, and the restrictions imposed by governments, religious authorities, and custom. The country essays are complemented by in-depth discussions of eighteen films that have been selected for both their excellence and their critical engagement with pressing current issues. Fiction films are the focus of this volume.5 Fiction films are unrivaled in their impact on viewers. They provide an immediacy of experience rarely found in documentaries and that the written word cannot match. They bring foreign settings alive in images, sound, characters, and story. Their dramatic stories elicit emotional responses, and their characters engage empathy.6 The empathy elicited becomes particularly important when they reach audiences who start out with negative views of other societies and cultures. Such is the case for many outside observers of the Middle East. The long history of Iranian cinema, its international renown, and the remarkable films of directors confronting the state earned it a special place in this volume. Three of the featured Iranian films focus on successive phases in the history of the clerical regime and demonstrate the complexity of Iranian politics; the fourth offers penetrating commentary on contemporary Afghanistan. The other major emphasis is on the Israel/Palestine conflict, the overarching political issue in the Middle East. Generations old, the conflict continues to shape the present. Palestinian directors, Israelis, and an Egyptian working in Syria present their perspectives on successive stages in the conflict from 1948 to the present in six featured films. Nineteen scholars rallied to the project.7 About half the contributors are film scholars, while others range across literary studies and the social sciences to two film directors and a novelist. Beyond differences in disciplinary orientation, there is considerable variation among contributors in the perspectives that inform their writing. They offer an illuminating range of approaches to the cinemas of the region. Egypt, Iran, and Israel boast established commercial cinemas. Elsewhere in the Middle East and the Maghreb, most film directors find themselves in extremely difficult circumstances. Commonly they develop their own scripts; they embark on what are usually protracted searches for funding; they proceed on minuscule budgets; they try to avoid censorship, and when that fails, they engage in difficult negotiations with censors; they take on multiple production\n\n2\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 2\n\n11/2/10 11:11:36 AM\n\nCr e ative Re sponse s to Conflict\n\nroles, recruiting actors, sometimes training amateur actors, assembling crews; and they struggle to get their films distributed. They are truly filmmakers. If they face multiple constraints, they exert much more control over their productions than directors of high-budget films. Theirs is a cinéma d’auteur, and it comes at a price—few manage to produce more than one film a decade. But extraordinary directors have left their mark, pursuing their visions despite the severe constraints. Iranian cinema has secured worldwide attention, but there are treasures to be discovered elsewhere in the Middle East and the Maghreb. The auteur directors, more often than not, dissent from political regimes, patriarchal customs, religious movements, and Western interference in the region. They may be characterized as intellectuals cum artists critically engaged in politics. Iranian director Rakhshan Bani-Etemad puts it thus in Nader Takmil Homayoun’s documentary Iran: A Cinematographic Revolution (Iran: Une révolution cinématographique, 2006): “The responsibility on my shoulders is totally different to that of a Western filmmaker. Whether I like it or not, it’s a responsibility I must take.” These directors have managed time and again to overcome daunting obstacles to give image and voice to dissent in powerful films, even if some had to remain less than explicit. Where they pioneered, commercial cinema has sometimes followed. Their films offer perspectives on issues central to the Middle East and the Maghreb today that reflect the political orientation of much of the intellectual class. We explore their perspectives alongside the political, cultural, and commercial constraints within which they create their films. The region spanning the Middle East and the Maghreb may invite generalizations, but when it comes to cinema, the contrasts are striking. The circumstances of film production vary widely across the region. At the same time, assumptions about the relationship of economic resources and film production are readily confounded. And so are assumptions about the relationship between political regimes and censorship. The contributions to this volume reflect the diversity of the region’s cinemas. Here I will sketch differences and recurrent patterns while touching on some important films produced in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Turkey.\n\nThe Economics Local markets for films are extremely limited in most countries. Only Egypt and Iran have populations that exceed forty million, and incomes are low in all the principal film-producing countries except Israel (see the accompanying table). At the same time, film production is confronted with formidable foreign\n\n3\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 3\n\n11/2/10 11:11:36 AM\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 4\n\nPopulation, Income, and Film Production Country\n\n1\n\nPopulation GNI at PPP (millions) per head1 2008\n\n2008\n\nAlgeria\n\n34\n\n$ 7,9402\n\nEgypt\n\n82\n\n$ 5,460\n\nIran\n\n72\n\n$10,8403\n\nIsrael\n\n7\n\n$27,450\n\nLebanon\n\n4\n\n$10,880\n\nMorocco\n\n31\n\n$ 4,330\n\nPalestine\n\n4\n\n...\n\nSyria\n\n21\n\n$ 4,350\n\nTunisia\n\n10\n\n$ 7,070\n\nProduction of feature-length fiction films 1920s 1930s\n\n14\n\n1970s\n\n1980s\n\n1990s\n\n2000–2008\n\nTotal\n\n9\n\n40\n\n38\n\n54\n\n47\n\n188\n\n94\n\n326\n\n530\n\n449\n\n460\n\n573\n\n393\n\n294\n\n3,133\n\n9\n\n3\n\n138\n\n437\n\n559\n\n389\n\n546\n\n554\n\n2,635\n\n1694\n\n1074\n\n1074\n\n...\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1940s 1950s 1960s\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n11/2/10 11:11:36 AM\n\nPurchasing power parity (PPP) converts currencies to U.S. dollars according to their purchasing power, i.e., one dollar has the same purchasing power over domestic Gross National Income (GNI) as the U.S. dollar has over U.S. GNI.

Powerful producers in the West, Japan, Hong Kong, and India are firmly established in the region, even if a number of countries put restrictions on them.8 The Arab-language film market in turn is dominated by the Egyptian film industry. Films from the Maghreb are further hampered by the language barrier that their Arabic vernacular presents for viewers elsewhere in the Arab world. They do, however, enjoy a measure of support from the Maghrebi diaspora in France. Most directors depend heavily on subsidies throughout the Middle East and the Maghreb. Governments have played an important part in funding national cinemas and encouraging the production of quality films. The fortunes of national cinemas have waxed and waned with such support. Foreign government agencies, television networks, and foundations also have provided major support for film production in many countries. Egypt has established one of the world’s principal film industries in spite of its poverty. Hollywood on the Nile has produced more than three thousand feature films since 1924. Private investment created a commercial and exportoriented genre based on a star system. It developed a strong local flavor, even if Hollywood was a source of open or hidden inspiration. Egyptian films dominate national screens, assisted by government measures that restrict imports— from India and Hong Kong in particular. Producers in the 1940s and 1950s accommodated their Arab export markets with Levantine rhythms, characters, and locations; since the 1980s they have bowed to the moral conservatism of the Gulf region (Shafik forthcoming). The Egyptian film industry was nationalized in 1960. However, private productions continued to predominate. The overall level of production decreased as Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian producers and distributors withdrew from Egypt and invested in Lebanon instead. Most of the significant films of the 1960s were public-sector productions, as Armbrust notes in this volume, but the General Film Organization, plagued by corruption and nepotism, accumulated huge debts and did not manage to produce more than thirteen films a year. Politically committed leading directors left in frustration. Among them were Youssef Chahine, who went to Lebanon, and Tawfik Saleh, who moved to Syria. Public feature-film production was terminated in 1971 (Shafik forthcoming). The exodus of foreign producers and distributors from Egypt in the early 1960s gave a boost to Lebanese production, which in turn made extensive use of Egyptian stars and technical talent (ibid.). But the boost was limited and short-lived. The small country never established a commercial cinema. In Syria, soon after Hafez Assad came to power in 1970, the National Film Organization brought together directors from across the Arab world who set\n\n5\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 5\n\n11/2/10 11:11:36 AM\n\nJosef Gugler\n\nout to establish the “Alternative Cinema” in opposition to commercial Arab, and notably Egyptian, cinema (Shafik 2007, 154). Funded by the National Film Organization, they produced several films that earned international recognition. Film production took off in the early 1970s but dropped back after a few years, perhaps because of the conflicted relationship between directors and the regime that controlled all film production until recently. Iran, with a large population that is not as poor as most in the region, has a long-established commercial cinema. But it was public funding by the clerical regime that allowed a flourishing of quality productions that have established Iranian cinema as the one cinema in the region to gain worldwide recognition. The poetics that characterize many Iranian films have charmed foreign viewers, while directors who offered critical perspectives on political developments in Iran found a ready response overseas. A large, well-educated exile community constitutes a major part of the international market for Iranian films. In Iraq, novice Mohamed Al Daradji’s Ahlaam (2005) marks a promising new beginning after the fall of the regime of Saddam Hussein. Al Daradji wrote, co-produced, directed, and shot the film on a shoestring budget of $300,000. Affluent Israel has established a cinema that joins private and public finance, and quite a few Israeli films have received international recognition. Amos Gitai, however, established himself as the Israeli director best known on the international scene with European financing secured after he exiled himself in France in 1983 to return to Israel only ten years later. Libya usually is not perceived as a film-producing country, but Muammar al-Gaddafi provided crucial funding for the region’s two most important epics. The Message (Mohammed, Messenger of God/al-Risala, 1976) and Lion of the Desert (1981) address themes central to the Middle East and the Maghreb: the birth of Islam and the resistance to colonialism. They are probably the biggest productions anywhere in the region, except perhaps for some of Chahine’s, featuring famous actors, using elaborate sets, staging large battle scenes, and employing dramatic scores by Maurice Jarre. The Message appears to be the only film in the region to have been shot in two languages, an Arab version and an English version, with different actors using the same sets. The director of these two remarkable films defies ready categorization. Born in Syria, Moustapha Akkad started out with these two films, then went on to produce a series of horror movies in Hollywood. Film production in the Maghreb has not been commercially viable except for some comedies.9 Public funding has flowed and ebbed in a somewhat chronological sequence across the three countries, and this is reflected in\n\n6\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 6\n\n11/2/10 11:11:36 AM\n\nCr e ative Re sponse s to Conflict\n\nproduction figures (see table). Virtually all Algerian features were produced by government agencies until 1984, and for a while they outnumbered the combined production of Algeria’s neighbors. They included notable films, prominent among them Chronicle of the Years of Embers (Waqaʾi sanawat al-djamr / Chronique des années de braise, 1975). Mohamed Lakhdar-Hamina’s œuvre won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival and to this day remains the only film from Africa or the Arab world to be so honored. Some films were co-produced with foreign directors, among them Youssef Chahine, who directed three in the 1970s, all set in Egypt. In Morocco, production increased substantially once nearly all features received government funding from 1980 onward. Production has been further boosted with an increased level of funding since the 1990s. Similar funding was initiated in Tunisia in 1981, but its impact was not apparent until state support became more generous in 2001. European support—from government agencies, television networks, and foundations—has provided the other main source of funding in the region, often in conjunction with government support (Armes forthcoming). France is preeminent among foreign supporters as it pursues its twin goals of promoting the use of the French language, la francophonie, around the world and of enlisting broad support for its defense of the “cultural exception” to free-trade agreements, that is, that cultural products should receive special encouragement and protection so as to promote diversity on the global level. The prime beneficiaries of French support have been films from the Maghreb, which commonly use the language of the former colonial power. It probably helps that many directors reside in France and others have good connections there. Descendants of Maghrebi immigrants in France have established, along with first-generation immigrants, a flourishing cinema that partakes of the government’s support for the French film industry. These directors tend to focus on the situation of the immigrant community. Some of their films follow immigrants back home. Others are set entirely in the Maghreb. The cinéma beur found its apotheosis in Rachid Bouchareb’s Days of Glory (Indigènes, 2006). The film was a box-office success, earned its leading actors jointly the Best Actor award at Cannes, and was nominated for an Oscar.10 Technological changes in distribution have profoundly affected film consumption throughout the region. First television, then video cassettes, and most recently DVDs have become strong competitors of film theaters. If local television channels offered limited fare, satellite transmissions greatly expanded television programming, and piracy of transmissions made them available to much of the population. Piracy similarly expanded access to home video.\n\n7\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 7\n\n11/2/10 11:11:36 AM\n\nJosef Gugler\n\nBox-office receipts plummeted; many film theaters closed, and others let their technical equipment and facilities deteriorate, further discouraging potential viewers. These developments dealt a serious blow to film production, but they also offered some benefits. With local television production came technical facilities, opportunities for training, and jobs. Television companies purchased and/or co-produced films; some governments mandated such support for locally produced films. Cinema audiences have expanded afresh in recent years with the establishment of movie complexes in many countries. It remains to be seen whether efforts to combat DVD piracy will be effective and enable producers to benefit from this potentially major source of revenue. Technological change is coming to film production in the form of digitalization. Compared to production on 35 mm film, digital production assures substantial savings: cameras and film stock are cheaper, smaller crews are required, and laboratories are eliminated altogether; also, digital video allows immediate review, reducing shooting time and hence the cost of actors, crew, and facilities. However, until cinema theaters make the expensive transition to digital projection, much of the savings in production is lost in transferring digital film to 35 mm film. For the most part, directors have been reluctant to forgo the quality of 35 mm film. While a few established directors have made the occasional digital film, they tend to be minor works. It was left to newcomer Nadia El Fani to venture forth with an impressive digital production, Bedwin Hacker, in 2002.\n\nThe Politics The political significance of film has been recognized at least since The Birth of a Nation hit the screens in 1915. And political authorities have sought to take advantage of the medium’s political potential since the Soviet Revolution, if not before. Censorship is ubiquitous in the Middle East and the Maghreb. At its most comprehensive, film production is suppressed altogether. The Arab Gulf countries have ample resources to finance film production, and they present a promising market: for decades they were the principal foreign market for the Egyptian film industry. But only recently have some Gulf countries produced a few films. Producers and sponsors choose which directors to support and what scripts to consider, and producers can use their power to shape the final product. Directors are induced to propose scripts that are likely to get funding. The extent to which producers and sponsors exert their power varies greatly. But that power is there, whoever funds cinema. The heated debate about the distorting\n\n8\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 8\n\n11/2/10 11:11:36 AM\n\nCr e ative Re sponse s to Conflict\n\neffect of foreign funding is ongoing; meanwhile, there can be no doubt that film production in the Middle East and the Maghreb would be much diminished without such funding. And while repressive regimes and government bureaucrats might be expected to be the most obvious enemies of cinema that challenges the status quo, such assumptions are not always borne out. In Syria, the National Film Organization commissioned, approved, and funded all film production from 1969 until recently. Yet Syrian cinema is renowned for the critical stance its directors have taken time and again vis-à-vis the regime. Usually the attacks on the regime are coded, and many allusions remain opaque to foreign viewers, but they are readily apparent to the Syrian public. However, Sacrifices (Sunduq al-dunya, 2002) by Oussama Mohammad, famous for the scathing critique of the Syrian regime in his earlier Stars in Broad Daylight (Nujum al-nahar, 1988),11 is said to remain hermetic even for Syrian intellectuals (Wright 2006). Unusually explicit is Nabil Maleh’s The Extras (alKompars, 1993), a breathtaking denunciation of the repressive regime. The film tells of illicit love in a patriarchal culture and of illicit discourse under a tyranny. In an interplay of reality and fantasies, daydreams, and hallucinations, The Extras effectively conveys the fears that haunt those who break cultural taboos and just about anybody living in a police state. Commentators have tended to dismiss the political significance of such criticism, suggesting that it is tolerated and even encouraged by the regime simply as a way of letting off steam. For example, miriam cooke has cast this interpretation in terms of “commissioned criticism” and has written of films that “run the risk of enabling the injustice to persist” (2007, 72–77, 120). Wedeen rejects such “safety valve” interpretations as functionalist, proposing a conflict analysis instead. She gives intellectuals opposing the regime a measure of agency: “Artistic transgressions are the site of politics, of the dynamic interplay between the regime’s exercise of power and people’s experiences of and reactions to it” (Weeden 1999, 89). Government funding obviates the need to pander to popular tastes. At the Syrian film festival in New York, Oussama Mohammad commented that he preferred the yoke of the National Film Organization to the tyranny of commercial cinema (Mohammad 2006). And scripts benefit from rewrites while directors wait for years until they finally get the opportunity to shoot the films. The few films produced in Syria thus gain international recognition time and again. It took fourteen years for Mohammad’s second film to be released, but Sacrifices won wide acclaim, including the Special Prize of the Jury at the Paris Biennale of Arab Cinema. Such successes bring credit to a regime that can present itself\n\n9\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 9\n\n11/2/10 11:11:36 AM\n\nJosef Gugler\n\nas the sponsor of quality cinema. Still, the government has sharply curtailed film production. Since the golden age of Syrian cinema in the 1970s, production has dropped to a trickle of two or three films a year, suggesting a stand-off between the regime and strong-willed directors. Recently the government allowed independent productions outside the National Film Organization. One of the first such films, Hatem Ali’s The Long Night (2009), is extraordinarily explicit, featuring, in their prison setting, four men who have been jailed for decades for acts of conscience. In Iran, as in Syria, government funding allowed directors to escape the dictates of commercial production. Unlike Syria, such funding consistently supported a large output of films. Quite a number of directors produced works that gained international recognition for Iranian cinema such as no other of the region’s cinemas enjoys. At the same time, Iranian cinema also is constrained by censorship. Government regulations impose strict cultural norms. Women have to appear veiled even in domestic settings; men and women cannot touch, not even husband and wife. More constricting is political censorship. Nevertheless, Iranian directors have taken critical aim at the clerical regime time and again. That took courage, manipulation, and compromise. Mohsen Makhmalbaf ’s Marriage of the Blessed (Arusi-ye khouban, 1989) presents a reckoning with the revolution ten years after its victory. Set at the end of the devastating Iran-Iraq War, the film contrasts the suffering of war veterans and the destitute with the wealth of profiteers. The religious leaders’ egalitarian slogans on city walls are contradicted by graffiti such as “Volunteer combatant, a lion in battlefields, a victim in town.” The protagonist, a shell-shocked photojournalist, wants to “work for Islam,” but his photographs of urban poverty are censored by his newspaper. Eventually, at the lavish wedding his rich fatherin-law has put on, he screams: “Robbed food tastes delicious.” In Takmil Homayoun’s documentary Iran: A Cinematographic Revolution, Makhmalbaf tells of getting permission to make the film by submitting to the censors a screenplay filled with revolutionary slogans but shooting a different script and of getting the film released by showing the censors a longer version of the film in which he had replaced all the “disturbing scenes” with revolutionary statements. Only much later, when the film ran in cinemas with the “real scenes” put back in, did the authorities catch on. Tahmineh Milani, in an interview with NBC’s Ann Curry, tells of being threatened by the country’s top censor when she challenged him early in her career. The stress took its toll, and she gave birth to twins prematurely; one of them died after a couple of days.12 Milani nevertheless confronted the clerical\n\n10\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 10\n\n11/2/10 11:11:36 AM\n\nCr e ative Re sponse s to Conflict\n\nregime with The Hidden Half (Nimeh-ye penhan) in 2001. The film has been promoted and tends to be interpreted as a critique of the position of women, the half of the Iranian population that clerical dictate seeks to hide literally as well as figuratively. But there is also the hidden half of the love story, the man’s side of the story we are never told. Most prominent is the film’s historical dimension, its focus on the secular half of the anti-Shah movement that was suppressed by the Islamic Revolution and remains hidden in the clerical regime’s version of Iranian history. The Hidden Half was the first Iranian film to speak of those events, and Milani did have to curtail scenes. Thus she could not convey that the clerical regime had many students killed (Auer 2006).13 Still, she was arrested in August 2001 to face trial and possible execution on several charges, including “sympathizing with counter-revolutionary grouplets” in her film; intervention by then President Mohammad Khatami got her released. If directors managed to produce critical films during the Khatami era, their room for maneuver became much more restricted when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad acceded to the presidency in 2005, as Egan spells out in this volume. Directors manage to produce critical films in Iran and Syria, then face further struggles getting them released. Both regimes are usually prepared to have these films shown at international festivals but often restrict their domestic distribution. Some of the very films that won awards abroad could not be shown in Iran. In Syria, a common pattern is for critical films to appear only at the Damascus International Film Festival. Still, in both countries, films do circulate all year round—underground. In Israel, a number of directors, among them several Israeli Arabs, regularly produce films that critically address Jewish-Arab conflicts within Israel as well as the Israel/Palestine conflict.14 They usually draw on government support, like other Israeli productions, and several have been submitted for Academy Awards. Still, such critical films have faced obstacles, as Shohat spells out for the 1980s (2010, 241–242). Some foreground Palestinians as well as Israelis. Much of Amos Gitai’s vast œuvre, fiction as well as documentary, has been devoted to the conflict. His Kedma (2002) is set in Palestine as the State of Israel is about to be established in 1948. Gitai gives voice to survivors of the Holocaust who have come to the Promised Land to find themselves in the middle of war and to Arabs who have to flee their ancestral homes. Rafi Bukaee’s Avanti Popolo (1986) ranks with the classics of antiwar cinema. Set at the end of the Six Day War in 1967, it has Israeli and Egyptian soldiers recognize their common humanity. Inasmuch as the Egyptian soldiers are played by Arabs living in Israel and are identified as such by local viewers because of their accent, they\n\n11\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 11\n\n11/2/10 11:11:36 AM\n\nJosef Gugler\n\ncan readily be seen to represent a suffering minority—like Jews have been for centuries. Ari Folman’s Waltz with Bashir (Vals im Bashir, 2008) shares the antiwar message and goes on to denounce the complicity of the Israeli army in the massacre of Palestinian refugees at Sabra and Shatila in 1982. In Egypt, explicitly political films have become quite common since the early 1990s even in commercial cinema. Three issues dominate: fundamentalism, denunciations of Israel and/or the United States, and critiques of Egyptian politics that are remarkably explicit. Films about fundamentalism are constrained by strict censorship. As Walter Armbrust spells out in his essay in this volume, no endorsement of Islam as a political alternative is allowed in cinema. Films can criticize Islamic fundamentalism as a political movement, but even then they are subject to restrictions. Various signifiers of Islamic identity have become a common sight in public places but are suppressed in nearly all Egyptian films. An acknowledgment of these new realities would entail a more differentiated depiction of Islam than has prevailed in Egyptian cinema so far. Films about Israel and/or the United States are subject to few restrictions; they can even implicate the regime’s policy of normalization with Israel. Armbrust argues that these films have to be understood in the context of regional conflicts. He further suggests that these films be thought of as a “politicsploitation” genre. Anti-Israeli and anti-American films, like the “blaxploitation” cinema, employ crude stereotypes—national stereotypes in this case. They are predicated on making audiences feel good about themselves by reversing the stereotypes propagated by the more powerful. American affirmation of moral commitments becomes American hypocrisy in Egyptian politicsploitation cinema. More or less veiled regime critiques could be found in Egyptian cinema for a long time, while the country was ruled by a monarchy subject to British interference, during the regime of Gamal Abdel Nasser, and in the post-Nasser era. In recent years the critiques have become quite explicit as films denounce political corruption and police brutality. The depiction of torture in films such as The Yacoubian Building (ʿImarat Yaʿqubyan, Marwan Hamid), the highestgrossing film in Egypt in 2006, and Chaos (Heya fawda, 2007), Youssef Chahine’s last film, directed jointly with Khaled Youssef, is particularly striking.15 One might consider the political import of these films to be undercut by implausible developments and caricatured portrayals that put them at a remove from reality and give salience to their fictional character. But the crowds they draw raise the question of how such fantasy shapes the popular imagination. When viewers applaud as Chaos concludes with an uprising against the corrupt\n\n12\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 12\n\n11/2/10 11:11:36 AM\n\nCr e ative Re sponse s to Conflict\n\npolice officer who has terrorized the neighborhood, a vision of Egypt’s corrupt and oppressive regime being toppled cannot be far from their minds. In Lebanon, numerous films have been produced in response to the trauma of the Civil War. Jean Khalil Chamoun’s In the Shadows of the City (Taif al-madina, 2000) is perhaps the finest example. The poignant story of a twelveyear-old boy growing up a witness to fifteen years of war centers on early love and family, all the while effectively rendering the grim reality of those years. As the child becomes a man, the film bears witness to the deepening sectarian divisions along with the spreading physical destruction. He lives in what soon becomes a separate Muslim community, but the significant relationships he establishes beyond the sectarian divide give a human face to The Other. Chamoun, like many of his fellow Lebanese filmmakers, wanted to break the amnesia about the Civil War that had engulfed Lebanon and to assuage the continuing social tensions. Recent developments in Lebanon have confirmed the importance of the task they assigned themselves. In Tunisia, the autocratic regime of Ben Ali that has perpetuated itself for more than two decades has stifled any critique. However, denunciation of his predecessor Habib Bourguiba does pass. Thus Nouri Bouzid, in his autobiographic The Golden Horseshoes (Safaʾih min dahab/Les sabots en or, 1989), has flashbacks of the torture he suffered in prison. Tunisian cinema is perhaps the most restricted of any in the region with regard to current national politics, but it enjoys a degree of freedom in the cultural realm that sets it apart from other Arab cinemas. Directors have been able to address sexuality and display a modicum of nudity. In 1986 Nouri Bouzid, in Man of Ashes (Rih essed/L’homme de cendres), told of two young men coping with the experience of having been abused by their master. In 2002 Nadia El Fani introduced bisexual women protagonists in Bedwin Hacker and overcame censors’ objections to a brief display of a semi-nude woman. The Algerian government controlled the production and distribution of films outright from independence until 1984. Initially most films were devoted to the War of Liberation; then the agricultural revolution was brought to the screen. A few films did set out to demystify the regime’s ideology of the past and the present, employing a rich dose of humor. Merzak Allouache pioneered this alternative view with Omar Gatlato (Umar Qatlatu al-Rudjla, 1977), which dwells on the disenchantment of the post-revolutionary generation growing up in Algiers. Then in the early 1980s, just as the government was about to give up its control over film production, it released two similarly critical films. Mahmoud Zemmouri’s The Crazy Years of the Twist (Sanawat al-twist al-majnuna/\n\n13\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 13\n\n11/2/10 11:11:37 AM\n\nJosef Gugler\n\nLes folles années du twist, 1983) tells the story of people caught between the conflicting demands of the liberation movement and the French army, making short shrift of the unending tales of heroism and selfless commitment during the struggle for independence. And Ahmed Rachedi satirized the bureaucracy in Monsieur Fabre’s Mill (Tahunat al-sayyid Fabre/Le moulin de M. Fabre, 1984). The events of October 1988, when the authoritarian regime violently repressed young demonstrators who had taken to the streets, prompted vigorous responses from filmmakers. Mohamed Chouikh highlights the betrayal of the liberation struggle in Youssef: The Legend of the Seventh Sleeper (Youcef kesat dekra sabera/Youcef, la légende du septième dormant, 1993). When his protagonist, an amnesiac veteran living in the colonial past, sets out to find the families of his fallen comrades, he refuses to accept that the corrupt party leaders, the bosses who mistreat their workers, and the fundamentalists who oppress the very women who participated in the struggle represent a post-colonial present. Malik Lakhdar-Hamina’s Autumn—October in Algiers (Uktubur fi-l-Jazaʾir /Automne—Octobre à Alger, 1993) features an artist censored by the repressive regime and his brother who has turned fundamentalist and seeks to impose the strictures of his beliefs on his family; they both get caught up in the bloody events of October 1988. Morocco has seen dramatic change in recent years. In 2000, Ali Zaoua, Prince of the Streets (Ali Zawa/Ali Zaoua, prince de la rue) brought the misery of street children to public attention, but Nabil Ayouch refrained from social, let alone political, critique. A few years later, with King Mohammed VI opening up for inquiry and public discussion the repression that characterized the regime of his father, Hassan II, a series of films was released about what have become known as les années de plomb, the Years of Lead, and their aftermath.16 The cinéma beur of first- and second-generation Maghrebi immigrants in France has been little inhibited in protesting discrimination against immigrants. Rachid Bouchareb’s Days of Glory is one of the rare films whose political impact was immediate and patently obvious in various ways.\n\nThe Directors Most filmmakers in the Middle East and the Maghreb have devoted some of their films to criticize the discourses and actions of political regimes, of patriarchal authorities, of religious movements, of the West. Oftentimes, however, they have been compelled to retreat from outspoken critiques to fare less objectionable to the powers that be.\n\n14\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 14\n\n11/2/10 11:11:37 AM\n\nCr e ative Re sponse s to Conflict\n\nMohsen Makhmalbaf ’s political biography paradigmatically represents the history of the Iranian Revolution. In 1972 the fifteen-year-old established an underground group that distributed anti-Shah leaflets. Two years later Makhmalbaf attacked a police officer.17 Makhmalbaf was injured in the attack, arrested, and jailed until he was freed with the advent of the revolution in 1978. The first films made by the autodidact in the early 1980s reflect his religious morality; they were even screened in mosques.18 Shortly, however, Makhmalbaf became critical of the religious regime that had entrenched itself in power, and he produced a series of films denouncing social injustice under the new dispensation, Marriage of the Blessed foremost among them. Shortly after, Makhmalbaf began filming outside Iran. Time of Love (Nobat-e asheghi, 1990) was shot in Turkey and The Silence (Sokut, 1998) in Tajikistan; since 2002 all his films have been shot abroad, as have those of his wife and his daughters. When protests erupted in Iran in 2009 in response to the regime’s handling of the presidential election and demonstrations were violently repressed, Makhmalbaf took on the role of spokesperson for the opposition. Inter alia he addressed the European Assembly in Strasbourg. Refused permission to establish a film school, Makhmalbaf had trained his family and a few friends in his Makhmalbaf Film School.19 His wife Marziyeh Meshkini and his daughters, Samira and Hana, continued his critical thrust. Among them the three women have directed seven fiction films, the four most recent ones devoted to Afghanistan. Meshkini’s Stray Dogs (Sag-haye velgard, 2003) powerfully conveys the state of a country devastated by three decades of war. When the film invokes the neorealist tradition with a reference to Vittorio De Sica’s Bicyle Thieves (Ladri di biciclette, 1948), it calls attention not just to stylistic parallels but to similarities in context. If neorealism had thematic roots in a critical examination of Italian society after World War II and if it was grounded in the material constraints of production companies struggling to survive, Afghan society is in utter disarray and the circumstances of filming in Afghanistan are extreme. Samira Makhmalbaf ’s Two-Legged Horse (Asbe du-pa, 2008) apparently incurred the wrath of fundamentalists: its filming was interrupted by a bombing. The emergence of women directors in Iran under the clerical regime has been spectacular. The prominent role they have taken in film production may be seen as a response to the assault by the clerical regime on the position of women. Rakhshan Bani-Etemad and Tahmineh Milani are among the most prominent Iranian filmmakers, and they have produced pointed critiques of the regime. The situation of Syrian directors is extraordinary. Most trained in “socialist” Eastern Europe. On their return they became civil servants at the National\n\n15\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 15\n\n11/2/10 11:11:37 AM\n\nJosef Gugler\n\nFilm Organization—and proceeded to critique Syria’s “socialist” regime more or less openly in their films. Oussama Mohammad, for one, has commented that among the many influences during his tenure at Moscow’s VGIK in the 1970s was that of Soviet filmmakers who produced films that voiced critiques of authority, the regime, and the official discourse (Salti 2006, 44). Nabil Maleh studied in Czechoslovakia and returned to Syria in 1964. Unlike most of his Syrian peers, he did not become a civil servant at the newly established National Film Organization. He was among the few Syrians involved in the establishment of the pan-Arab Alternative Cinema, and his The Leopard (al-Fahd, 1972) was one of the two first full-length fiction films produced by the group, to international acclaim. His productive career was interrupted when he left Syria in 1981 to return only in 1992 to shoot The Extras, an exceptionally explicit critique of the authoritarian regime. At the turn of the millennium, Maleh was closely involved in the movement of prominent Syrians that sought to bring liberalization to Syria. Jean Khalil Chamoun found his calling when the Civil War broke out in Lebanon. As established filmmakers fled the fighting, the recently returned novice director stayed on to become, in joint productions with Mai Masri, the foremost chronicler of the protracted tragedy in a series of documentaries. Eventually Chamoun proceeded to produce In the Shadows of the City. Amos Gitai started out with documentaries critically examining the legacy of the Israel/Palestine conflict. Hostile reactions prompted Gitai to leave for France, where he remained for ten years. With European financing he moved on to a series of fiction films that established him as an international celebrity. Kedma won the Palme d’Or at Cannes. The film distinguishes itself for giving voice to both Jews and Arabs in the crucial confrontation of 1948. Rafi Bukaee developed Avanti Popolo from his graduation project. The film earned the Golden Leopard’s Eye at Locarno and, against strong political opposition, became the Israeli submission to the Academy Awards. Bukaee went on to produce films and directed only one more before his untimely death in 2003. Palestinian directors have devoted themselves to influencing international opinion in support of the struggle of the Palestinian people. Many exiled themselves to Europe, where they have found most of the funding for their films. A considerable part of their efforts has gone into documentary films, but they also have produced notable fiction films. Michel Khleifi was the first to bring international recognition to Palestinian cinema. Born and raised in Nazareth, he studied theater and television in Belgium. His first film, Fertile Memory (al-\n\n16\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 16\n\n11/2/10 11:11:37 AM\n\nCr e ative Re sponse s to Conflict\n\nDhakira al-khasba, 1980), financed by German and Dutch television networks, was considered innovative not just in the context of Palestinian filmmaking, but in comparison to Arab documentary films in general. Khleifi’s Wedding in Galilee (Urs al-Jalil, 1987), a Belgian-French-German co-production, brought international acclaim, winning the Critics’ Prize at Cannes, the Tanit d’Or at Carthage, and the Golden Seashell at San Sebastián. It was the BBC’s turn to provide most of the funding for Tale of the Three Jewels (Hikayat al-jawahir thalath, 1994). The film was shot in Gaza still under Israeli occupation, and the Israeli army stipulated that no scenes showing weapons or demonstrations could be filmed. One day after Khleifi started filming, the Hebron massacre occurred; the country was in uproar; there were curfews, demonstrations, and violent deaths. The shooting schedule was canceled, and the entire project was in doubt. When the filming finally resumed, the crew members were considered mad; they became known by the locals as “The Fools” (Gertz and Khleifi, in this volume). Unlike most established Palestinian directors, Rashid Masharawi was born in the Occupied Territories and raised there, in the Shati refugee camp in Gaza. When he was twelve, he moved to Tel Aviv and lived there illegally to help support his parents and his seven siblings after his father developed diabetes. He worked as a construction worker, as a waiter, as a dishwasher. At the age of nineteen Masharawi completed his first short. Over the next decade he directed a half-dozen more shorts while making a living building film sets (Gertz and Khleifi 2008, 43–45, 214). His first feature, Curfew (Hatta ishʿar akhar, 1994), was informed by his experience of life under Israeli occupation. The film was screened at the Critics’ Week at Cannes and brought Masharawi international recognition. In 1996 Masharawi established the Cinematic Production and Distribution Center in Ramallah. Its Mobile Cinema brought films to children in refugee camps (Cinema Production Center, n.d.). The experience is reflected in Ticket to Jerusalem (2002), co-produced by the center, the story of a man who persists against all odds in his mission to screen films for Palestinian children. The oppression of the occupation is all-pervading, the dread that disaster might suddenly strike constant. Waiting (Intizar/Attente, 2005) in turn reflects Masharawi’s experience of waiting to return to the ancestral home in Jaffa that his parents fled in 1948. Laila’s Birthday (ʿEid milad Laila, 2008) lightens the mood by bringing humor to a story of the frustrations of everyday life in Ramallah. Hany Abu-Assad did not formally study cinema, either. He started out as an airplane engineer in the Netherlands and proceeded to produce films for\n\n17\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 17\n\n11/2/10 11:11:37 AM\n\nJosef Gugler\n\ncinema and television. His first feature film was an inconsequential comedy set in a Dutch middle-class milieu. Rana’s Wedding (al-Quds fi yawm akhar, 2002), produced by the Palestinian Ministry of Culture with the help of funds secured from the Gulf states, brought him international recognition. Abu-Assad and Bero Beyer wrote Paradise Now (al-Janna al-an, 2005) in 1999, but it took them five years to get to shoot after they had secured funding from Dutch, Israeli, German, and French producers. Filming in Nablus, the crew was caught between the Israeli army and various Palestinian factions. Six European crew members departed after an Israeli missile hit a nearby car, the local location manager was kidnapped, and gunmen ordered the crew to leave. Filming resumed after three weeks, but five days later a landmine exploded three hundred meters from the set, and Abu-Assad moved the set to Nazareth, his birthplace in Israel (AbuAssad 2005). Beyond Egypt’s popular cinema, several directors articulated social concerns and political critique in films that found international recognition. Tawfik Saleh, Youssef Chahine, and Salah Abu Seif became the principal directors of “Egyptian Realism.”20 Saleh was the only one to focus on political issues and adhere to a realist approach throughout his life’s work, a total of seven feature films. Saleh ran into problems with censorship and bureaucracy in Egypt and eventually moved to Syria. There he joined directors from several other Arab countries to establish the “Alternative Cinema.” Saleh’s The Dupes (al-Makhduʿun, 1972) and Maleh’s The Leopard were the group’s first full-length fiction films. The Dupes won the Tanit d’Or at Carthage and was screened as a Critics’ Selection at Cannes. From Syria, Saleh moved on to Iraq, where he produced his last film, Long Days (al-Ayyam al-tawila, 1980), on the life of Saddam Hussein—at a time when the dictator was still widely respected as a progressive leader. Egypt’s colonial experience brought education imported from Britain, but many intellectuals turned to the United States, which was seen as an anti-colonial power. Youssef Chahine is one of those educated at a prestigious British-style school who later trained in the United States. The internationally acclaimed director has sought to critically engage the West, notably in his autobiographic Alexandria . . . New York (Iskanderija . . . New York, 2004). And while his Destiny (al-Masir, 1997) is a denunciation of Islamic fundamentalism, it starts out with a man burned at the stake by the Inquisition. In his contribution to September 11 (11'09\"01—September 11, 2002), a compilation of shorts by eleven directors from around the world, Chahine engages in a dialogue with an American Marine killed in Beirut in 1982 that addresses the question of Westerners who ask, either from profound ignorance or in cynical hypocrisy, “Why do they hate us?”\n\n18\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 18\n\n11/2/10 11:11:37 AM\n\nCr e ative Re sponse s to Conflict\n\nChahine was prompted to produce Destiny by his clash with Egyptian fundamentalists who had attacked him over his preceding film, The Emigrant (alMohager, 1994). Already he had been distressed to see young actors he had nurtured renounce acting as incompatible with their newfound fundamentalist beliefs. The example of one such actor informs a central story line in Destiny. Another major story line recalls the persecution and stabbing of Egyptian Nobel laureate Naguib Mahfouz. Atef Hetata also has experienced the threats of fundamentalists from close by. Both his parents, Nawal el-Saadawi and Sherif Hetata, have been placed on death lists by fundamentalists. Hetata’s first feature film, Closed Doors (al-Abwab al-moghlaka, 1999), gives voice to the secular, progressive, feminist viewpoints that his parents had championed for decades. Maghrebi directors have moved back and forth between the two shores of the Mediterranean. Such is the case of Nabil Ayouch, who was born in Paris, the child of a French mother and a Moroccan father. For many years he spent half his time in Morocco, and in later years he moved there (Barlet 2003). Ali Zaoua (2000) focuses on an aspect of Moroccan society not readily acknowledged: its story of street children was a new departure for Moroccan film and indeed Arab film. The film earned the Stallion of Yennenga, the top prize at FESPACO, the Pan-African Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou, and numerous other awards. Ayouch has come to prominence as a producer in Morocco. His production company, Ali n’ Productions, joined with the National Radio and Television Company to form The Film Industry—Made in Morocco, which announced in 2007 that it planned to produce thirty feature films over a two-year period. Nadia El Fani has moved between Tunis and Paris, where she was born to a French mother and a Tunisian father. She was not able to attend film school and learned her craft as an assistant to a string of directors for close to ten years. Eventually she produced her first short and established her own production company, Z’Yeux Noirs. Bedwin Hacker, her first feature, broke new ground in more ways than one. The film shatters stereotypes about Islamic societies by projecting an Arab world that not only contrasts with Western depictions but also is quite different from the world commonly presented in Arab films. In particular El Fani subverted stereotypes about Arab women by moving beyond the denunciation of gender inequality to show women who are very much in control in the world at large. She brings to the fore a key issue in globalization: Western domination of global media. And she pioneers a high-tech theme in Arab film and keeps her viewers in suspense with complex spy action. El Fani had to struggle with more or less explicit censorship all along: the difficulties of\n\n19\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 19\n\n11/2/10 11:11:37 AM\n\nJosef Gugler\n\nsecuring funding for the prize-winning script, the cuts demanded by the Tunisian Ministry of Culture, and the four-year delay until the film was released in Tunisia. Nearly all Algerian directors, like their fellow intellectuals, sought refuge in France from fundamentalist threats in the 1990s.21 Mohamed Chouikh and his wife, Yamina Bachir-Chouikh, were notable exceptions. They stayed in Algeria during les années de violence, the Years of Violence, even after her brother was killed. Chouikh added to his œuvre with films that established him as perhaps the finest Algerian director. Bachir-Chouikh, who had edited his films, and Chouikh responded to their experiences in quite different ways in her Rachida (2002) and his Hamlet of Women (Douar nssa/Douar de femmes, 2005). Large numbers of Algerians, Moroccans, and Tunisians have settled in France. Among the many directors of their cinéma beur, Paris-born Rachid Bouchareb stands out. The director of a half-dozen feature films, he also has become an important producer of independent films. Some of his films range far beyond the confines of France and the Maghreb, and several have earned prestigious awards. His Days of Glory addresses the Maghreb, honoring the generation of his grandfather, who fought for the liberation of France in 1944–1945, and challenges the French to rewrite their history. In the sequel, Outside the Law (Hors-la-loi, 2010), he seeks to have French colonial history rewritten from the Sétif massacre in 1945 to the struggle of Algerian nationalists in France and the Paris massacre of peaceful demonstrators in 1961.\n\nThemes of Dissent Most of the directors who produce outside commercial cinema give voice and image to dissent in some if not all of their films, and so do some directors of commercial films. If certain themes stand out, their salience varies across borders, inviting an examination of their specific political and cultural contexts. We have seen already that films critical of political regimes can be found in every country and that their critiques have been remarkably forceful even where they faced repression. Some of these critiques have been quite explicit; others have had to remain rather subtle. Films problematizing gender relations have been produced in most countries for a long time. Some entail regime critique as they decry legislation and policies discriminating against women. Most critique patriarchal traditions that are upheld, or indeed resuscitated, by narrow interpretations of fundamentalist teachings. Denunciation of such patriarchal traditions is a major element in some of the films attacking Islamic fundamentalism\n\n20\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 20\n\n11/2/10 11:11:37 AM\n\nCr e ative Re sponse s to Conflict\n\nthat have appeared in recent years, usually in countries where the movement turned violent. Apart from such anti-fundamentalist films, directors have largely avoided portraying religion in their works, but then censorship commonly prohibits any material that might be deemed disrespectful of Islam. Colonialism has been the focus of major films in Algeria and Libya, countries marked by protracted armed struggles against the European colonizers. Surprisingly few films from the region have addressed Western imperialism since the days when nationalist films denouncing British interference were common in formally independent countries such as Egypt and Iraq. Palestine is the panArab theme par excellence. A substantial number of films have been devoted to the Palestinian cause throughout the Arab world and beyond. Kurds, not unlike Palestinians, are in search of their country. Their plight and their aspirations have inspired films by several directors, most of them of Kurdish descent. Gender\n\nGender issues recur in the cinemas of the Middle East and the Maghreb; they are conspicuous in the cinemas of Iran and Tunisia. The films denouncing the subordinate position of women in Iran may be seen as a reaction to the sustained effort of the clerical regime to roll back gains women had made. Among those responding to this attack have been prominent male directors like Dariush Mehrjui and Jafar Panahi, but two women directors stand out. Much of the large œuvre of Tahmineh Milani is devoted to gender issues, and Rakhshan Bani-Etemad has produced several films with the same focus. Most of the gender-oriented films are set among the middle class, but Bani-Etemad’s Under the Skin of the City (Zir-e pust-e shahr, 2001) takes viewers into a working-class milieu where political discontent is rife and youth are alienated. A working mother holds her family together against the odds. She is involved in an unending struggle to support her family and protect her children as they reach adulthood in a patriarchal world where corruption, crime, and political repression are rampant. A half-century after Tunisia promulgated legislation that profoundly reshaped women’s rights, the position of Tunisian women within the family, their educational opportunities, and their professional achievements continue to be well ahead of those of women elsewhere in the Arab world. As in Iran, women are relatively well represented among filmmakers; and strong women feature in many Tunisian films, whether produced by women or men. Such strong female characters remain, however, usually largely confined within the family context\n\n21\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 21\n\n11/2/10 11:11:37 AM\n\nJosef Gugler\n\nas the clichéd powerful matron. Nadia El Fani’s Bedwin Hacker, in contrast, no longer defines the protagonist in terms of her position within the family but as an independent woman. A technology wizard, she challenges Western domination of global media, interfering with satellite transmissions in cyberspace. With a French secret-service agent in hot pursuit of her, Bedwin Hacker has the qualities of a thriller at times, all the while subverting stereotypes about Islamic societies, most especially as concerns gender relations. Religion\n\nThe Middle East is the heartland of Islam, but only in a few instances do films exalt religion. Overtly religious films are produced in Iran. Mohsen Makhmalbaf, for one, started out directing such films. In Egypt, Muslim religious films were produced in the 1960s and 1970s.22 Moustapha Akkad’s The Message tells the story of The Prophet. Production in Morocco came to a halt when the producers withdrew their support, but Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi stepped into the breach, and the film was completed in Libya. The Message offers a faithful reenactment of the events surrounding the life of The Prophet. For Muslim viewers the film illustrates the foundation story of their faith. Distribution was, however, restricted in some Arab countries because of protests by Muslim groups, even though the film had passed muster with religious authorities in Cairo and Beirut. In Morocco, on the other hand, the film was even dubbed in the Berber language. Muslims take for granted that representations of The Prophet, and for that matter his closest family, cannot be shown or heard. For others the absence of the principal protagonist lessens the dramatic impact of the story, and it becomes a somewhat dry history lesson. Elsewhere filmmakers have denounced Islamic fundamentalists, most notably in Afghanistan, Algeria, and Egypt, countries where conflict with the authorities led to violence.23 Most of their films forcefully condemn fundamentalists. Leaders are depicted as power-hungry and/or corrupt and their followers as blind adherents at best. Fundamentalists are shown to impose abhorrent rules, on women in particular, and to be responsible for deplorable violence. If such films challenge the tenets of some Muslims, they make it all too easy for Westerners simply to be outraged and to applaud the directors. And indeed, many of these films have been readily distributed in the West, quite unlike most of the films originating in the Middle East and the Maghreb.\n\n22\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 22\n\n11/2/10 11:11:37 AM\n\nCr e ative Re sponse s to Conflict\n\nOsama (2003) by Siddiq Barmak, Afghanistan’s best-known director, was released to wide acclaim. The film is a searing indictment of the Taliban, denouncing their ideology and exposing brutality and corruption under their regime. Osama won the Golden Globe Foreign Film award and numerous others. And it is one of the rare films to draw comment from Western politicians; it was endorsed by George W. Bush as well as Hillary Clinton. But the subjugation of women continues to be part of post-Taliban Afghanistan, as Stray Dogs dramatically conveys. Algerian directors have produced notable films in response to the rise of fundamentalism. Already in the 1990s Youssef: The Legend of the Seventh Sleeper and Autumn—October in Algiers, while condemning the regime, criticized fundamentalists who seek to impose their beliefs on others. In Bab el-Oued City (Bab al-wad al-humah, 1994), Merzak Allouache denounced the fundamentalists as they turned violent yet acknowledged their grievances, in particular the bloody repression of the 1988 demonstrations. These directors produced their films under precarious circumstances as violence spread in the early 1990s. Only when the violence subsided could filmmakers address the civil war that pitted Islamists against the military regime that had denied them electoral victory in 1991. Allouache returned from self-imposed exile to shoot The Other World (L’autre monde, 2001), in which he effectively conveys the horrors of war-torn Algeria through the reactions of victims and witnesses rather than gruesome pictures. Yamina Bachir-Chouikh in turn produced Rachida, a dramatic condemnation of the atrocities committed by fundamentalists in which women appear as resilient victims. Mohamed Chouikh undertook to revisit the civil war at a time when many fundamentalists had laid down their arms in response to a government amnesty. Unlike most films addressing fundamentalism, Mohamed Chouikh’s Hamlet of Women is conciliatory, offering a nuanced treatment. His villagers fight off the insurgents—and they fear government. He gives voice to the grievances that made a man join the insurgents. The story involves a reversal of gender roles that problematizes gender stereotypes while at the same time providing a source of humor that lightens this return to a painful past. Hamlet of Women won the top prize at Vues d’Afrique, the Montreal African film festival. In Egypt the rise of Islamic fundamentalism as both a political ideology and a social practice has been a significant theme in commercial cinema since the early 1990s, as Armbrust sets out in his essay in the present volume. Armbrust focuses on two films of particular interest. The Yacoubian Building denounces\n\n23\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 23\n\n11/2/10 11:11:37 AM\n\nJosef Gugler\n\nfundamentalism as well as political corruption and repression, and it links them: favoritism embitters the protagonist of one of the several stories told in the film. He ends up being recruited by the fundamentalists, and his arrest and torture lead him to join the armed wing of the fundamentalist organization. Ahmad al-Badri’s I Am not with Them (Ana mish maʿahum, 2007), a romantic love story, acknowledges that the place of religion in society is widely debated in Egypt, as it is elsewhere in the Muslim world. These are commercial productions aimed primarily at the Arab market. Youssef Chahine in Destiny (1997) and Atef Hetata in Closed Doors (1999) sought to reach beyond local audiences, and both relied on foreign funding. Destiny is arguably the finest film by Egypt’s most distinguished director, who won a Lifetime Achievement Award at Cannes when the film was shown there in competition in 1997. The epic is set in the late twelfth century in the splendors of Córdoba, Andalusia’s foremost city, bringing to life the flourishing Muslim civilization. Chahine offers a twofold critique of fundamentalist ideology. The film revolves around the life and teachings of the renowned Muslim philosopher Averroës, also known as Ibn Rushd. Destiny shows a humanist Averroës confronting the fundamentalists of the day with the affirmation “No one can claim to know the whole truth.” Chahine complements the philosopher’s teachings with his own philosophy of life, that life is to be lived—and enjoyed—to the fullest. Song and dance sequences, seamlessly integrated into the action, express Chahine’s response to fundamentalism. Destiny is a thoroughly entertaining film of a sage and lovers of life confronting life-denying fundamentalists hungry for power. In his debut feature, Atef Hetata attacks fundamentalism as did Chahine, but Closed Doors does what Destiny failed to do: the film effectively conveys the attractions of the fundamentalist creed and the community established around it. Set in Cairo during the 1991 Gulf War, the complex story of the coming of age of a boy raised by his divorced mother moves beyond the personal to detail the social, economic, and political ills of Egyptian society that make fundamentalism an appealing creed. Still, Hetata, like Chahine, chooses to present an undifferentiated picture of fundamentalist leaders. The clerics appear manipulative and their motives suspect. Neither director seems prepared to consider the fundamentalist faith at face value.\n\n24\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 24\n\n11/2/10 11:11:37 AM\n\nCr e ative Re sponse s to Conflict\n\nColonialism and Imperialism\n\nColonialism has been the focus of major films where there was a protracted armed struggle. Moustapha Akkad created what is perhaps the foremost Middle Eastern film on the anti-colonial struggle in the Arab world. Lion of the Desert (1981) tells of the long resistance to the Italian conquest of Libya. The $35 million budget, rivaling those of its most expensive Hollywood contemporaries, was largely bankrolled by Muammar al-Gaddafi. The film was banned in Italy on the grounds that it was “damaging to the Italian army” (Popham 2007); only in 2009 did Italian television screen it during a state visit of Muammar alGaddafi. The film features dramatic battle scenes but may appear drawn-out to Western viewers. Gaddafi is preparing another epic on the Libyan resistance to Italian imperialism, Years of Torment. The film, budgeted at more than $40 million, is to be based on his own writing and directed by another Syrian, Najdat Anzour (ibid.). During the Algerian War of Liberation, Chahine devoted a film to the cause. Jamila, the Algerian (Jamila, 1958) is based on the story of a heroine of the struggle, Djamilah Bouhired, one of the three women bombers depicted in The Battle of Algiers.24 When the government of newly independent Algeria began producing films in the 1960s, most of them told of the war. The most famous film of the nascent Algerian cinema, though, the epic Chronicle of the Years of Embers, is set in the two decades leading up to the beginning of the war in 1954. Even the finest Algerian productions on the War of Liberation were overshadowed by The Battle of Algiers (La Battaglia di Algeri, Gillo Pontecorvo, 1966). Although directed by an Italian, The Battle of Algiers may be considered an Algerian film inasmuch as Saadi Yacef, the leader of the insurgency, was involved with the script, co-produced the film, and played himself in a key role. Gillo Pontecorvo’s masterwork stands out among accounts of the anti-colonial struggle in the region; it is a classic among depictions of anti-colonial struggles anywhere in the world. The Battle of Algiers is as relevant to asymmetrical warfare today as it was a half-century ago. As the captured Front de Libération Nationale (FLN) leader Larbi Ben M’Hidi puts it in the film, in response to a journalist questioning the insurgents’ bomb attacks on civilians: Isn’t it even more cowardly to attack defenseless villages with napalm bombs that kill many thousands of times more? Obviously, planes would make things easier for us. Give us your bombers, sir, and you can have our baskets [in which the bombs were hidden].\n\n25\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 25\n\n11/2/10 11:11:37 AM\n\nJosef Gugler\n\nPontecorvo persuasively presents the rationale for “terrorism” in response to overwhelming military might and dramatically demonstrates the effectiveness of torture in extracting secrets from its victims, while suggesting the loss of legitimacy entailed in both strategies. Pontecorvo’s object lesson of how the French won the battle and lost the war gained fresh relevance when the United States invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, faced guerrilla warfare, and resorted to torture. The Pentagon’s Office of Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict, for one, thought so, screening the film in August 2003, three months after the commander in chief had declared “Mission Accomplished.” In response to the U.S. invasion of Iraq, documentary filmmakers have produced an impressive array of films. Hollywood was slower to respond, and its films focus, as usual, on Americans. In distinct contrast, Al Daradji’s Ahlaam is the story of two patients and a doctor at a psychiatric hospital in Baghdad where Al Daradji worked as a volunteer in 2003. Part of the gripping film is set in 1998, telling of repression under Saddam Hussein and bombing by the United States and Britain. Then the story resumes in 2003 with the fall of Baghdad. The horrors of the mayhem unleashed by the U.S. invasion become palpable as the three protagonists struggle to reach their very different goals. Al Daradji dramatically conveys the experiences of Iraqi civilians as bombs rained on Baghdad, Baathist snipers killed civilians in the streets, looters took advantage of the lawlessness, and American soldiers were unable to communicate with the population.25 Pale st ine\n\nThe establishment of Israel and the exodus of Arabs in 1948 was experienced by Arabs as a profound tragedy, the Nakba. The ensuing conflict has rent the Middle East for more than six decades. A substantial body of film has been devoted to the Palestinian cause across the Arab world as well as in Iran and Israel.26 Egyptian director Yousry Nasrallah tells of the Nakba in “The Departure,” the first half of his epic The Gate of Sun (Bab el shams, 2004). Based on the eponymous novel by the distinguished Lebanese author Elias Khouri, it was shot in Syria and Lebanon with actors and crew from around the Arab world.27 With Kedma, acclaimed Israeli director Amos Gitai gave voice to the two sides opposing each other in 1948. An Arab refugee confronts Israeli soldiers and prophesies strife without end, while a recently arrived Holocaust survivor, walking among the dead and wounded after a battle, protests that he does not want to be part of the history being written.\n\n26\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 26\n\n11/2/10 11:11:37 AM\n\nCr e ative Re sponse s to Conflict\n\nThe Dupes stands out among the films devoted to the Palestinian cause across the Arab world. Featured in this volume with Syrian cinema, it is very much a pan-Arab production. Egyptian director Tawfik Saleh drew on the most important novella by Ghassan Kanafani, the distinguished Palestinian writer; the film was produced under the auspices of Syria’s National Film Organization, and it was shot in Syria and Iraq. The Dupes follows three Palestinians who are propelled by economic or political reasons to migrate to Kuwait in search of work. A fellow Palestinian in Baghdad offers to take them across the border to Kuwait. These men represent three generations of Palestinian refugees, and their stories tell of their losses in 1948 and their precarious positions ten years later. The film denounces the hypocrisy and weakness of Arab regimes that proclaim their solidarity with the Palestinian people but have abandoned them. Palestinian directors have sought to sensitize the outside world to the oppression suffered by Palestinians and to make foreigners understand that Israeli military might narrowly circumscribes the avenues Palestinian resistance can take. Rashid Masharawi’s Waiting takes viewers to Palestinians living in Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon who continue to wait for the return to their homeland. A visit to the memorial site for the victims of the Sabra and Shatila massacre in Beirut brings home the precarious position of Palestinian refugees in their “host countries”: Palestinian women and children were slaughtered by Lebanese militia, and more than twenty years later only a simple plaque commemorates them. In 1967 the combined armies of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria suffered a dramatic defeat in the Six Day War. It was all the more traumatic for taking the Arab world by surprise, and it tarnished the stature of Gamal Abdel Nasser as the foremost nationalist leader of the Arab world. A number of Arab films reacted to that shock, prominent among them Chahine’s The Choice (al-Ikhtiyar, 1970), The Sparrow (al-ʿUsfur, 1973), and Return of the Prodigal Son (Awdat al-ibn al-dal, 1976).28 A few years later, novice Israeli director Bukaee addressed the war with Avanti Popolo. He features a desperate Egyptian soldier, an actor in civilian life, who recites Shylock’s monologue in The Merchant of Venice as he pleads with Israeli soldiers to recognize their common humanity. Eventually the former enemies proceed together chanting “Avanti Popolo,” the classic song of communist and socialist parties. Avanti Popolo reflects the reversal of roles: after their victory in 1967, Jews, once victims, become occupiers; Palestinians experience oppression in their own land, as if a minority. Tale of the Three Jewels by Palestinian Michel Khleifi tells of life in Gaza under Israeli occupation in the early 1990s, lightening the mood by focusing\n\n27\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 27\n\n11/2/10 11:11:37 AM\n\nJosef Gugler\n\non children, introducing the dreams of one of them, and offering an ambiguous ending. With Paradise Now Hany Abu-Assad presents Western audiences with a Palestinian perspective on what is commonly put beyond the bounds of argument by being branded “terrorism” while humanizing those who make the ultimate sacrifice by giving their lives for the cause. Where The Battle of Algiers articulates the strategic rationale for attacks on civilians in a struggle against overwhelming military might, Paradise Now conveys the rationale of suicide bombers living under oppression. The film’s very title focuses attention on individual motivation. Its reference to rewards in the afterlife, however, plays to Western preconceptions. It obscures the political context foregrounded in the film, and it is misleading inasmuch as some suicide bombers are secular, as is one of the film’s protagonists. Paradise Now won the Golden Globe Best Foreign Film award and numerous others, and it was nominated for an Oscar. Just about all Palestinian directors adopt a mode that is by and large realist, quite close to the documentary, but Elia Suleiman takes an altogether different approach. His Chronicle of a Disappearance (Sijill ikhtifaʾ, 1996) and Divine Intervention: A Chronicle of Love and Pain (Yad ilahiya, 2002) stand apart by two distinctive features: minute portrayals of what passes for a normal life and flights of escapist fantasy. The “normal” life Suleiman affectionately portrays is the daily life of his parents in their Nazareth home in Chronicle of a Disappearance and that of his widowed father in a neighborhood rent by petty conflicts in Divine Intervention. The films then turn to the political context of Palestinians’ daily life in altogether different ways. Chronicle of a Disappearance employs humor, ridiculing Israeli police who are manipulated by Suleiman’s lover at will. Divine Intervention speaks of struggle, and the flight into fantasy becomes even more explicit. E.S.—Elia Suleiman played by himself—throws an apricot pit out of the car window at a tank, and the tank explodes; his lover strides through a roadblock, the Israeli soldiers are paralyzed as they watch her, and the watchtower collapses in an explosion. In the film’s magnificent climactic scene, the lover becomes a ninja freedom fighter, spiraling into the air, warding off gunfire from her Israeli enemies, eliminating them all, and downing a helicopter. These films respond to the frustrations of Palestinians living as second-class citizens in Israel and under Israeli occupation elsewhere. Suleiman has told of the euphoria of a Ramallah audience upon seeing the watchtower collapse (Wood 2006, 220). His films also can be seen as an expression of despair—the despair that normal life is an illusion for Palestinians and that there is no prospect of overcoming Israeli military might.\n\n28\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 28\n\n11/2/10 11:11:38 AM\n\nCr e ative Re sponse s to Conflict\n\nSuleiman went on to tell of his own life and that of his family since 1948 in The Time that Remains (2009). Drawing on the recollections of his father and his mother’s letters, he presents a series of vignettes of the Suleimans and with it a history of Nazareth. Restrained acting, bordering on caricature, illustrates that history rather than bringing it alive. Suleiman again offers his viewers ironic gags, but he provides only faint echoes of the flights of fantasy that took viewers beyond the tableaux of his parents’ life in his two preceding films, and the sense of laconic despair has become all-pervading—from Suleiman’s grandfather, the mayor of Nazareth, who signed the surrender to the Israeli army; to Suleiman’s father who was savagely beaten by Israeli soldiers and left for dead; to Suleiman himself who, as in his previous films, remains a silent witness.29 In the summer of 2006, Israel launched a devastating assault on Lebanon. Philippe Aractingi started shooting Under the Bombs (Taht al-qasf/Sous les bombs, 2007) even as Israeli planes were wreaking havoc. Much of the film has a documentary character, most strikingly the powerful opening sequence of a bombing. Under the Bombs poignantly conveys the disaster that befell the Lebanese, showing fear and panic, the despair of the bereaved, and the physical destruction wrought, rather than gruesome pictures. Ku r dista n\n\nKurds, like Palestinians, are in search of their country. Their plight and their aspirations have inspired a number of films. Path-breaking was the powerful Yol (1981), which shared the Golden Palm at Cannes, where it also won the Critics’ Prize. Kurdish-Turkish director Yilmaz Güney wrote the script while imprisoned, then entrusted the direction to his friend Şerif Gören. After Güney escaped from prison, he processed the film in France. The story follows five prisoners on furlough; one of them returns to “Kurdistan,” as an intertitle puts it. The fields are blooming, but shots are ringing out from his village, where military police have cornered two guerrillas. The nights are filled with the sound of gunfire. When the army brings the dead for identification during the day, the villagers dare not recognize them for fear of retribution. Several more films focusing on the Kurdish conflict were produced in Turkey after its return to civilian rule. Prominent among them is Yeşim Ustaoğlu’s Journey to the Sun (Güneşe yolculuk, 1999), which takes viewers from the discrimination Kurds experience in Istanbul to the devastation of the Kurdish countryside. Ustaoğlu had to find funding for the film in the Netherlands and Germany, but she was\n\n29\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 29\n\n11/2/10 11:11:38 AM\n\nJosef Gugler\n\nallowed to shoot it in Turkey. She and her film were showered with prizes at the two principal Turkish film festivals. However, distribution in Turkey proved difficult.30 Iranian productions devoted to Kurds commonly condemn the regime of Saddam Hussein, yet they remain silent on the position of Kurds in Iran. Samira Makhmalbaf ’s Blackboards (Takhte siah, 2000) drew worldwide attention to the plight of Iraqi Kurds when it garnered the Jury Prize at Cannes. Bahman Ghobadi established himself as a major director with four films in the span of just seven years. They were produced and largely funded in Iran. Ghobadi’s films bring the Kurds into the cultural discourse both as subjects of his films and himself as a Kurdish filmmaker who has gained international recognition. A Time for Drunken Horses (Zamani bara-ye masti-ye asbha, 2000), set on the Iran-Iraq border, is shaped by a stark contrast between caring child workers and the men who exploit them—Ghobadi is anything but romanticizing his compatriots. Marooned in Iraq (Songs of My Motherland/Avaz-hayé sarzamin-e madariyam, 2002), shot in Iran, speaks of the suffering of the Kurdish people at the hands of Saddam Hussein. Turtles Can Fly (Lakposht-ha ham parvaz mikonand, 2004) shows refugee children in Iraq in desperate poverty; the child protagonist is a rape victim who raises her little brother but succumbs to utter distress. Half Moon (Niwemang, 2006) celebrates Kurdish music while denouncing the severe restrictions on women singing in public in Iran. Hiner Saleem enjoyed funding by the Regional Government of Iraqi Kurdistan for Kilometre Zero (Kilomètre zéro, 2005). The film is set in Iraq at the time of the U.S. invasion. It has returning Kurdish exiles commenting that they know the United States is an imperialist power and they would have preferred the Swiss or the Swedish, but nobody else came. If Kurds appear as victims in most films devoted to them, that is not the case in Saleem’s Dol (2007). This film stakes out the claim to a state bringing the Kurdish people together by having viewers partake of the life of Kurds in three countries: life under military boots in Turkey, exhilaration at liberation and grief over the suffering of the past in Iraq, and armed resistance in Iran.31\n\nCreative Dissidence against the Odds To sum up, apart from the established film industry of Egypt, film production in the Middle East and the Maghreb depends heavily on subsidies. Even in Iran, with its large market, and in Israel, with its relatively affluent population, government funding plays a significant role. Elsewhere the fortunes of film production have waxed and waned as government policies have changed over\n\n30\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 30\n\n11/2/10 11:11:38 AM\n\nCr e ative Re sponse s to Conflict\n\ntime. Foreign funding has enabled the work of Palestinian directors and much of the recent work of directors such as Youssef Chahine, Amos Gitai, and the Makhmalbafs. It likewise has aided filmmaking throughout the Maghreb. Outside the commercial cinemas of Egypt, Iran, and Israel, most film directors have to surmount formidable obstacles to secure funding, to produce their films, and to get them distributed. Against all odds, they have produced outstanding works. Many of their films have successfully competed in international film festivals. However, very few have enjoyed general release overseas, even while distribution for home viewing and institutional use has improved. Most of these auteurs give voice to dissent, as do some of those working in commercial cinema. These intellectuals cum artists have managed to produce trenchant critiques, some more explicit than others, a testimony to their engagement and their courage. They offer fresh perspectives on crucial issues confronting the region today, perspectives that are shared by much of the intellectual class.\n\nNote s I wish to thank, without implicating, Roy Armes, Kevin Dwyer, Eric Egan, Lisa Wedeen, and the anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on earlier versions. 1. Very few of the films featured here have enjoyed general release in the anglophone world; most have had only limited exposure at film festivals and art houses. Some are available in the United States on home video; others are distributed for institutional use. However, as of this writing, Avanti Popolo is available only in Hebrew, Hamlet of Women is not in distribution, and Waiting is only in theatrical distribution. 2. The sketches of and comments on Hollywood productions in Shaheen’s encyclopedic Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People (2009) constitute a devastating indictment of the role played by the world’s predominant media industry in projecting negative images of the Arab world. An eponymous documentary based on his study (Sut Jhally, 2006) offers the most extraordinary examples of the rampant vilification of Arabs. Shaheen’s subsequent study Guilty: Hollywood’s Verdict on Arabs after 9/11 (2008) demonstrates how this industry continues to project images that further poison international relations at a time of crisis. Khatib (2006) compares the politics of Hollywood and Arab films. Particularly striking are her observations on the contrasting use of space: while Hollywood films convey mastery of space by the Western protagonists, Egyptian and Palestinian films present an insider view.\n\n31\n\nGugler_4236_BK.indd 31\n\n11/2/10 11:11:38 AM\n\nJosef Gugler 3. Armes (2008, 2010b) and Qasim (2009) list most Arab films. Armes gives information on the directors; Qasim provides information on the production team and a short summary of the story of each film. 4. Turkish cinema is not included in this collection, and in this introduction I just touch briefly on a couple of Turkish films focusing on the Kurdish issue. Turkish cinema is one of the major cinemas of the region, with both a large body of work and a number of directors who have gained international recognition. The omission is a matter for regret, even if it may be justified on several grounds. One argument turns on the question of the extent to which Turkey, while geographically largely within Asia, is culturally part of Europe. Kemal Atatürk sought to transform the country into a European nation three generations ago, and conflicts over his reforms fuel current debates over Turkey’s application to join the European Union. Another consideration is that Turkey has remained marginal to the conflicts that ravage the Middle East. This may change if the simmering conflict between Turkey and the increasingly autonomous Kurdish region of Iraq comes to a head. In the end, there were practical matters of keeping this volume manageable in terms of the efforts required and the publisher’s concern over the length of the book. On Turkish cinema see Dönmez-Colin 2008 and Suner 2010. 5. Full-length fiction films used to be called feature films, but feature-length documentaries have become quite common. At the same time, the boundaries between the two genres have become blurred. Major directors like Jean Khalil Chamoun and Amos Gitai work in both genres. If Western fiction is quite distinct from local productions, such is not the case for Western documentaries: they often draw on public and/or private funding that frees them from commercial considerations, and many directors share local perspectives"
