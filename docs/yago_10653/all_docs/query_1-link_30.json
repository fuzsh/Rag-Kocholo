        "text": "Fajr festival screened on Saturdaya restored version of Nasser Taghvai’s classic movie Captain Khorshid.\n\nThe annual event is screening seven foreign and three Iranian restored movies in the Classics Restored strand. Taghvai’s movie was screened in Felestin Cinema. The other Iranian movies are A Simple Event by Sohrab Shahid-Sales, and Jalal Moghadam’s God’s House, along with international classics such as Robert Bresson’s Pickpocket and Steamboat Bill, Jr. co-directed by Buster Keaton and Charles Reisner.\n\nThe movie is about Captain Khorshid, a sailor who although only having one hand, manages to sail his little boat. Nasser Taghvai (born 1941) is an Iranian film director and screenwriter. He made his debut, Tranquility in the Presence of Others, in 1970 and gained the attention of Iranian critics.\n\nCaptain Khorshid is an adaptation of Ernest Hemingway’s To Have and Have Not, which won the third prize at the 48th Locarno International Film Festival in Switzerland in 1988. Other top prizes include best actor and best supporting actor from the fifth Fajr International Film Festival. In 1999, he directed a segment of the film Tales of Kish, which was nominated for the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nSome 30 cast and crew members of the film attended the screening session, including Taghvai’s wife Marzieh Vafamehr who represented him, and producer Haroun Yashayai.\n\nEstablished in 1982, Fajr is an annual film event that celebrates cultural exchange, displays creative achievements of highly acclaimed cineastes, and pays tribute to local and international films and directors. Since its establishment, it has played a vital role in the development of Iranian Cinema.\n\nFor all festivalgoers who are already planning their visit, check screening time and other information at Fajriff.com or email the Secretariat at Film@Fajriff.com.\n\nPresided over by Reza Mirkarimi, the 35th edition of Fajr International Film Festival will take place from 21 to 28 April in Tehran."
