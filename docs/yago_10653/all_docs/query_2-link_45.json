        "text": "In recent years, post-revolutionary Iranian cinema has been praised in many international forums. With its distinct style, themes, authors, idea of nationhood, and manifestation of culture, a global market was suddenly surprised to find Iran producing poetic humanist films. Many questions can be raised on the success of the Iranian cinema and the characteristics which have made it so distinctive. Are there aesthetic or thematic similarities in these films, and what are the influences and motivation behind them? Is there such a thing as a signature style, specific to the New Iranian Cinema and in what ways might it be responsible for its positive reception from festivals, scholars and critics? For this study to engage with these questions, it will need to focus on contextualizing the emergence of this new cinema by providing a brief history of Iranian national cinema, with an emphasis on the foundations of filmic art in that region. While their films have differences and contrasting elements, this essay will identify recurring themes and features of the New Iranian cinemas and assess the factors which have taken shape.\n\nThis book analyzes the changes in the representation of women in Iranian cinema since the 1960s, and investigates the reasons and motives for this. Iranian cinema, both before and after the Islamic Revolution, has been closely monitored by the ruling power, and has been utilized to relay messages and information that comply with the ruling ideology. However, it was only after the 1979 Revolution and the subsequent legitimization of cinema by the Islamic rule that cinema became widely accessible to the general public. Within this context, this book explores the changing roles of women in film production and their representation in films made between the 1960s and 2000s. Although some aspects of women’s lives became stricter after the revolution, it was in the late 1980s that women took a prominent role both behind and in front of the camera for the first time. It is demonstrated here that such shifts were due to several factors, including factionalism within the Islamic Republic, shifts in the Iranian film industry, and the emergence of a group of highly educated film production teams, in addition to the fuller integration of women into the film industry, which is analyzed in particular detail. This study explores a number of representative female-centric films, with a focus on their cultural, social and cinematic contexts. Discussing these films with respect to the representation of women, it uses textual analysis as its base methodology. Interviews conducted with filmmakers and people active in the industry also serve to place the films into their historical, social, and political context.\n\nThe main target of this study is the analysis of the filmic representation of Iranian women in a time span of almost 40 years based on a feminist viewpoint with the main focus being laid upon the Post-Revolutionary cinema. The core of the discussion is the examination of an essential historical paradox, where a supposedly liberating revolution creates many kinds of strict limitations, which could not in turn eliminate women but to some extend transforms filmic representation of Iranian women. The clashes of tradition and transformation create an atmosphere in which the discursive and filmic representation of women changes during time. Additionally, this study analyses the way by which the patriarchal power structure genders women to frame the concept of an ideal woman, while women‘s resistance against this power poses serious question to the patriarchal hierarchy of society. The final findings indicate that while female characters of Post-Revolutionary films are empowered, they are still silent and unable to reverse the patriarchal structures. In order to demonstrate a historical shift in representation of women in the mentioned time span, four films of Post 1979 revolution are analyzed from a socio-political and historical point of view: The Mare (1984), Sara (1993), Gilaneh (2005), and Final Whistle (2011). Keywords: Iranian Cinema, Feminist Film Studies, Women Representation, Tradition, Power and Patriarchy."
