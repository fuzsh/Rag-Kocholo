In 1969 he was invited to teach at the Theater Department of the College of Fine Arts at University of Tehran. He chaired this department from 1972 to 1979.\n\nHis daughter, Niloofar Beyzaie, is a theater director and playwright.\n\nBeyzaie published a number of studies such as A Study on Iranian Theatre (Namayesh dar Iran), theatre of Japan and theatre of China. Some of his plays, such as Death of Yazdgerd, have been translated in other languages and was made into a film by Beyzaie himself.\n\n1970s and the outset of a cinematic career\n\nIn 1969 Beyzaie began his film career by directing the short film Amu Sibilou (Uncle Mustachio) followed by “Safar” in 1970 in the framework of Iranian New Wave that includes directors such as Nasser Taghvai, Ali Hatami, Sohrab Shahid Sales, Dariush Mehrjui, Abbas Kiarostami, Khosrow Sinai and others.\n\nHe made his first feature film “Ragbar” (“Downpour“), in 1971.
