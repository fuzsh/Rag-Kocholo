This study is based on the views of Richard Krivolin and Robert Portman about adaptation in cinema. This investigation is hoped to help the Iranian directors in improving the quality of their movies. The results of this study show how Taghvaie has benefited from his deep understanding of both literature and cinema in localizing an American novel and creating a different location. Taghvaie has recreated the novel through changing its narrative expression into a visual expression."
