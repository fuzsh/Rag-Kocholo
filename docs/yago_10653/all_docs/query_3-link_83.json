        "text": "The people behind an Australian-produced film critical of Iran are shocked and appalled an actress will be lashed 90 times and jailed for her role in the feature.\n\nMarzieh Vafamehr has been sentenced to a year's jail and 90 lashes for appearing in My Tehran For Sale, a South Australian-produced film critical of the Islamic republic's hardline policies on the arts.\n\nThe film was shot in the Iranian capital and tells the story of a young actress whose stage work is banned by authorities.\n\nIt premiered at the Adelaide Film Festival in 2009 but is banned in Iran.\n\nThe Australian filmmakers and investors behind the feature say they are \"deeply shocked and appalled\" at the news of Vafamehr's sentence.\n\n\"Adelaide-based company Cyan Films worked with an established Iranian production company to produce the film and all proper government permits were obtained for filming,\" they said in a statement.\n\nProducers Julie Ryan and Kate Croser are not aware of the specifics of the charges but believe they relate to scenes in the film in which Vafamehr appears without wearing the hijab.\n\n\"The producers would like to emphasise that Marzieh's involvement in the film was limited to her role as an actress and she was not in any other way involved in the behind-the-scenes filmmaking,\" they said.\n\nThey say the film was never intended to be distributed within Iran and its dissemination on the black market in Tehran has been totally outside their control.\n\n\"We continue to offer our support to Marzieh and her family by respecting their wishes to let the case and the appeal follow the proper legal channels,\" they added.\n\nIranian opposition website Kalameh.com says Vafamehr's lawyer has already lodged an appeal.\n\nIt adds she has been in jail since July and suggests the charges relate to film permits.\n\nVafamehr's husband, celebrated Iranian filmmaker Nasser Taghvai, told Kalameh.com the film was not made without permits.\n\nThe film's director, Iranian-Australian Granaz Moussavi, says the accusations have no grounds.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"All the documentation has been provided to the Iranian court to show that permits were in place for the production of the film,\" she said.\n\nFinancial assistance for the development and production of the film was provided by the South Australian Film Corporation and the Adelaide Film Festival.\n\nFilm Corp chief executive Richard Harris says the filmmakers are deeply disturbed about Vafamehr's sentence for appearing in the film, \"which is itself about the risks that artists are prepared to take for creative expression\".\n\n\"The SAFC will do everything within its power to assist in securing Marzieh's freedom,\" Mr Harris added.\n\nThe director of the Adelaide Film Festival, Katrina Sedgwick, says she hopes the appeal process will overturn the harsh sentence.\n\n\"This terrible situation highlights the important artistic freedom we have in this country, and reinforces how important it is that we continue to value strong artistic voices in all societies,\" she said.\n\nLoading...\n\nSouth Australian MP Dennis Hood has written to Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd, hoping he may be able to intervene.\n\n\"It is something that state politicians don't normally get involved in,\" Mr Hood said.\n\n\"But it was state taxes that paid for this film, which involved this unfortunate young lady, so we are going to bring it to our Foreign Minister's attention to see what can be done.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Mr Rudd says the Australian Government is deeply concerned by the reports.\n\n\"The Australian Government condemns the use of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and is deeply concerned by reports that Ms Marzieh Vafamehr has been sentenced to one year in jail and 90 lashes for her role in an Australian-produced film,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"The Australian Government urges Iran to protect the rights of all Iranians and foreign citizens.\"\n\nThe chairman of the Australian Iranian Community, Siyamak Ghahreman, says Vafamehr's sentencing is part of a wider crackdown against artistic freedom.\n\nAmnesty International's campaigns director Andrew Beswick agrees.\n\n\"It's indicative of the crackdown on freedom of expression that we have seen in Iran in recent years, and that extends across human rights defenders, lawyers, students and others who speak out in opposition to the government,\" he said.\n\n\"We think that anybody who is charged for peacefully expressing their views should be released.\n\n\"Marzieh should not be flogged and we'd like to see an end to those cruel and inhuman forms of punishment in Iran,\" he added."
