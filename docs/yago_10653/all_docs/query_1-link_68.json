        "text": "(Dir. Terrence Malick, United States, 2005)\n\nThrough the Eyes of the Other\n\nTerrence Malick’s visionary aesthetic exists in a world entirely its own. No other filmmaker today captures the grandeur of the world in which we live quite like him. The director’s small oeuvre is marked by breathtaking imagery and celebrations of this beautiful earth. With only two (yet near perfect) films in the past thirty years, it would seem safe to say Malick also approaches his craft with careful precision and solemnity. Thus, it would only be fair to engage each of his latest efforts with a sense of reverence in hopes that the great filmmaker would enlighten us once again with his supremely unique vision.\n\nThe New World finds Malick exploring actual historical events like its predecessor The Thin Red Line. But, just like that film, we should readily expect that the director is far more concerned with the philosophical nuances of legend than adhering to strict historical accounts. His latest tells the story of the momentous collision of cultures that was the founding of Jamestown in pre-colonial North America. The film begins with the arrival of the English explorers as the natives gaze at the magnificent vessels in amazement. The scene, brilliantly set to Wagner’s “Vorspiel” to his opera Das Rheingold, beautifully captures the sheer wonder that both sides express in anticipation of the imminent meeting.\n\nThe settlers land, and John Smith (Colin Farrell) and Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) are quickly established as our prominent English players. Brought over in the stocks, Smith is already a man with few allies. Presumably anxious to regain one of his finest crewmembers, Newport immediately absolves Smith of his supposed seditious remarks and places him in a crucial leadership role. Malick wastes no time in chronicling the inception of what would become Jamestown and gives us glimpses of encounters with the natives, construction of the settlement, and early failures through an expertly edited brief sequence. We piece together the strain the new environment has had on these settlers with little to no dialogue – one of the filmmaker’s most admirable trademarks. All the while, the young Pocahontas (impressive newcomer Q’orianka Kilcher) watches from afar as this strange new settlement grows. She quickly becomes the film’s main protagonist and the eyes through which we witness this pre-American world.\n\nWhen the situation for the English settlers becomes dire, Newport returns to England for more aid and names John Smith captain in his stead. Before he leaves, he charges the fearless explorer with increasing trade and improving relations with the natives. Things turn sour during an outlying expedition, and Smith finds himself held captive by Pocahontas’ tribe. In an act of grace, the young maiden steps in front of the explorer’s executioner after his intrusion has sealed his fate. Bound to her by this courageous deed, Smith, allowed to stay with the tribe through winter, becomes the girl’s pupil as she teaches him to see the world through the eyes of her people. This sequence provides the beating heart of Malick’s film. Like Smith, we too are charged with discovering and engaging this beautiful new world. Pocahontas and Smith expectedly form a bond of love as they learn the other’s language and perception of the world around them. Malick captures this blossoming romance and the character’s shared awe of nature through exquisite, copious editing. He creates his story by piecing together seconds of footage woven tightly like an elaborate tapestry.\n\nSpring arrives, and the natives return Smith to his foreign colony. They tear a blindfold from his eyes and the dilapidated state of Jamestown stands before him. Burdened by the despair that lingers in the settlement like a pandemic, the captain reassumes his responsibilities and takes charge once more of preserving the fort until Newport’s return. Smith’s newfound allegiance pits the settlers against the natives on multiple occasions, and this seeming betrayal ultimately leads to his dismissal from Malick’s narrative seamlessly transitioning into another exploration of a different new world for the film’s true protagonist, Pocahontas. Banished by her tribe for her loyalty to the wayward captain, the girl makes a new home alongside the foreigners in Jamestown. She adopts a new name, wardrobe, and religion. Her domesticated countenance leads her into the arms of another Englishman after Smith’s departure. John Rolfe (Christian Bale), a soft-spoken and serious tobacco cultivator, falls for this fascinating newcomer and convinces her to wed him. Pocahontas (now Rebecca) eventually journeys with her husband (and son) to his native England, and Malick’s camera follows the young wife, now a foreigner herself, as she discovers this industrial new world.\n\nMalick ends his exploration of wonder here in England as his protagonist succumbs to a fatal illness prior to returning to her motherland. Before her untimely death, Rebecca faces her former lover again but poignantly chooses dutifully loving her husband. It’s a beautifully subtle close to that chapter of innocent discovery. The filmmaker closes his film as it begins with Wagner’s “Vorspiel”, this time accompanying an unforgettable montage of Rebecca joyfully frolicking around as she used to, only now in this disparate new world.\n\nThe New World stands as an undeniable triumph of unimaginable beauty. Though the film’s creator, like his brave heroine, finds beauty in all worlds whether manufactured or natural, he bares an inclination to favor God’s original gift of nature. And, in crafting a story through the eyes of a Native American protagonist, he seems to have found the perfect medium through which to paint this magnificent vision. Seeking to tell its story largely through images and scarce dialogue, The New World proves a perfect successor to the meditations of The Thin Red Line. More than many films of this past decade (and century for that matter), it makes a strong case for the distinct visuals of film as pure art.\n\nThe decade from the years 2000 to 2009 will always hold a special place in this writer’s heart. It was during this time that I came of age and discovered my own love of film. Though my tastes have changed considerably since the early years of my growing cinephilia, some of the very films that ignited this passion in me have remained significant in my mind – In the Mood for Love, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Spirited Away, and Lost in Translation. And, some I’ve only recently discovered for the first time, but they have moved me in ways I could have never expected – Werckmeister Harmonies, The Headless Woman, Platform, and The Intruder.\n\nNow, with five years of this new decade behind us, I hoped to compile a list of my personal favorites from that decade. I found it too difficult to rank them, but Wong Kar-wai’s staggering In the Mood for Love is easily the film of the decade. I narrowed my list down to twenty, but couldn’t help including a long list of honorable mentions. There are films here from all over the world, from directors as disparate as seasoned veterans Hou Hsiao-hsien and Abbas Kiarostami to newcomers Apichatpong Weerasethakul and Lucrecia Martel. I anticipate the impact of these twenty films to last well into the decades to come, and each will always hold a special place in my own personal canon as works that influenced how I understand and approach cinema as art.\n\nBefore Sunset (Dir. Richard Linklater, United States, 2004)\n\nCleverly shot to give the appearance of its story unfolding in real time, Richard Linklater’s Before Sunset brings actors Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy back nine years after his ode to youthfulness and bright futures that was his beloved Before Sunrise. In this sequel, fans of the first film are given an answer to its hopeful, yet ambiguous finale. Did Celine and Jesse meet up six months later as planned? Before Sunset answers no, but Linklater proves there’s much more for these one-time lovers to sift through. The pair has grown up – their concerns have changed, their paradigms have shifted, they’re a bit more jaded. But, isn’t that a lot like life? We change and we grow, sometimes for better and other times for worse. This follow-up, then, is a wholly unique experience that allows us to see how two characters we thought we knew so well change with the real passing of time.\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Dir. Michel Gondry, United States, 2004)\n\nPostmodern screenwriting genius Charlie Kaufman teams up with talented music video director Michel Gondry to create this generation’s Annie Hall – a whip-smart spin on a tired Hollywood genre. Continuing the inventiveness of his wacky sci-fi set-ups, Kaufman injects his typically cold work with a welcome, warm emotional core with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Committed to practical special effects and an unbelievable premise – a company can erase painful memories of those customers would most like to forget – Gondry works wonders with Kaufman’s script directing a pair of outstanding leads in Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet who deliver career-high performances as the troubled lovers. Gondry takes us on a whirlwind trip through the mind and through memory, and in the end makes a convincing case that relationships are essential to life despite their inevitable difficulties.\n\nFlight of the Red Balloon (Dir. Hou Hsiao-hsien, France/Taiwan, 2007)\n\nHou Hsiao-hsien’s recent fascination with modern urban living reaches its apex with his Paris-set Flight of the Red Balloon. Based on Albert Lamorisse’s popular short The Red Balloon and financed by the Musée d’Orsay, Hou’s film is also a delightful celebration of contemporary Parisian life filtered through the perspective of those whose stories are not often told: a single, working mother, her precocious son, and his nanny, a Taiwanese woman studying film in France. Together, the three rely on one another for friendship, security, and a place to call home. Hou’s always-evolving style finds him still favoring the long take but his camera moves constantly, gently bouncing along like the film’s titular candy-colored orb. The action of Hou’s elliptical narrative barely rises above a murmur, but Flight captivates nonetheless as he paints a very real portrait of modern day life.\n\nThe Headless Woman (Dir. Lucrecia Martel, Argentina, 2008)\n\nIn Lucrecia Martel’s The Headless Woman, psychological decline directly corresponds to moral and societal decay. Superficially, Martel’s finest work yet recounts the story of one woman’s negligent car accident that may or may not have taken the life of a young boy, but with The Headless Woman subtext greatly overrules narrative. Martel affixes her camera to the film’s subject, intensely studies her behavior and gestures, and draws metaphorical parallels to the fallout of her accident and her bourgeois privilege. All the while, Martel demands our utmost attention to piece together this wondrously oblique narrative and arrive at our own conclusions as to what exactly happens when. Beneath this surface of exquisite framing and meticulous mise-en-scène, the film offers a glimpse of a woman subtly teetering on the verge of a mental breakdown, but in choosing not to absolve this subject of her possible, unintentional crime, Martel uncovers an unflattering human trait to distance ourselves from our own poor choices and their subsequent consequences.\n\nIn the Mood for Love (Dir. Wong Kar-wai, Hong Kong, 2000)\n\nIf film is defined as art in motion, a holy union of story, image, and sound, then Wong Kar-wai’s In the Mood for Love is not only the finest example of film as art from this decade, but it also stands as one of cinema’s greatest achievements ever. More than any other film on this list, Wong’s intimate portrait of unconsummated, forbidden love blends breathtaking aesthetic with a deeply felt narrative that commands our undivided attention. There’s rich beauty in the vibrant colors as Christopher Doyle’s camera delicately follows the two lonely souls at the center of the film and heart-wrenching strings that accompany every slow-motion stroll through the dimly lit alleyways of mid-century Hong Kong. Wong’s opus also represents the apex of his career-defining exploration of urban loneliness and personal longing as the film’s would-be lovers accept their fate as casualties of time itself.\n\nThe Intruder (Dir. Claire Denis, France, 2004)\n\nWith The Intruder, Claire Denis bursts the tidy bubble of traditional narrative cinema with ferocious aplomb. Ever concerned with ambiguous storytelling in favor of minimal dialogue and contemplative visuals, Denis’ The Intruder is easily her most challengingly oblique work yet. No more than a few words are uttered throughout the entire film, and its loose narrative thread is nearly indecipherable upon first viewing. Instead, Denis continues her intimate exploration of the human mind via a visual fixation on the human body accompanied by a rush of non-linear images that blur narrative reality and imagination. To discern which pieces of the puzzle fit where, Denis’ film demands repeat viewings, but one gets the impression it’s likely never intended to be fully solved. There’s a transfixing mystery surrounding Denis’ work, one that clearly invites innumerable interpretations.\n\nMemories of Murder (Dir. Bong Joon-ho, South Korea, 2003)\n\nBong Joon-ho has built his career on appropriating classic Hollywood genres into a modern South Korean context. His second film Memories of Murder is his police procedural. This first-rate crime saga’s grounding in the real world – with the disturbing real-life events that inspired it – lends an extra dose of horror to Bong’s film. And yet, what is perhaps most impressive about his sophomore feature – and his entire body of work for that matter – is Bong’s uncanny ability to oscillate between screwball comedy and heart-wrenching pathos within a matter of seconds. Bong’s film is refreshingly palatable, both an entertaining and visceral watch. Furthermore, Bong brilliantly courts familiar tropes of the genre – the collision of an urban and rural cop who must work together to solve the case, suspense-building thrills, jump scares, promising leads that turn to dead ends – yet none of them ever appears stale.\n\nMulholland Drive (Dir. David Lynch, United States, 2001)\n\nThrillingly operating in a mode of absurdist dream logic, David Lynch’s nightmarish depiction of the dream factory that is Hollywood as a horror show brilliantly subverts our expectations of what fame and fortune promise. In Mulholland Drive, the entertainment industry’s capital city is unfit to nurture the talents of aspiring newcomers and either destroys or bends them to its own crooked will. Lynch plunges us into the story of one such wide-eyed wannabe star Betty as her well-made plans quickly turn sour in a noirish set-up that spirals into a surrealist nightmare with altered identities, shifting narratives, and confounding plot detours. Lynch’s mesmerizing work is a masterstroke of twenty-first century cinema, reverential to the medium’s halcyon days of old as well as blazing new territory for an era of postmodern art and thought.\n\nThe New World (Dir. Terrence Malick, United States, 2005)\n\nTerrence Malick’s fourth film The New World builds upon the breathtaking visual style he mastered with Days of Heaven and The Thin Red Line, but it also marks a new chapter in his slowly expanding body of work. He nearly forgoes the linear storytelling of traditional narrative cinema altogether – something he experimented with some in Red Line – to craft a collage of beautiful images, exhilaratingly edited to uniquely tell his story – a feat matched in this decade only by Denis’ The Intruder. The effect is utterly intoxicating. This blurring of images as they flash across the screen, sometimes for no more than a second or two, functions as a fitting visualization of his usual exploration of the intersection where humankind and its environment meet. In focusing on the English settlement of a pre-colonial America and the ensuing collision of cultures, Malick seems to have unearthed the perfect subject for his particular brand of wonder.\n\nThe Royal Tenenbaums (Dir. Wes Anderson, United States, 2001)\n\nWes Anderson’s greatest film The Royal Tenenbaums is an aesthetic wonder, the work of an artist refining the traits that would go on to mark his entire idiosyncratic oeuvre. His pastiche of late ‘70s/early ‘80s style, ironic, deadpan humor, comically overblown characterizations, carefully detailed mise-en-scène, and geometric camerawork are on full display here. But, what helps Anderson’s film rise above a mere exercise in gimmicky self-aware stylization is his denial of the cynicism inherent in his dark comedy by granting his characters redemption. In this way, Anderson wisely dodges the nihilist accusations his comic contemporaries the Coen brothers frequently face. He never asks us to take this portrayal of the Tenenbaum family very seriously, but in so doing, the fitting ending that provides healing for this hilariously dysfunctional family adds an unexpected layer of humanity to his particular brand of comedy.\n\nThe Son (Dir. Jean-Pierre & Luc Dardenne, Belgium/France, 2002)\n\nChampions of contemporary cinematic verisimilitude, the Dardenne brothers have crafted their masterpiece with The Son. Lacking the stylistic inventiveness or densely layered narratives of some of this decade’s greatest works, the brothers’ film may seem like a lightweight on a list that includes Lynch’s and Wong’s cinephilic monoliths. But, this would be a misreading of the film’s surface-level simplicity. The Dardennes’ work boasts a rigorous aesthetic that serves its skeletal narrative to underscore the bubbling conflict at its core. In this way, The Son is a hushed thriller, at once allowing us silence and space to meditate on its protagonist’s dilemma – perhaps even asking us to put ourselves in his place – and chillingly building suspense until the brothers brilliantly release it in the film’s final moments. In its third-act appeal for forgiveness in answer to its central conflict, the Dardennes’ film becomes a biblical parable of sorts, which only serves to highlight the filmmakers’ wise choice of carpentry as a visual metaphor for the film’s backdrop.\n\nSpirited Away (Dir. Hayao Miyazaki, Japan, 2001)\n\nAs a compelling metaphor for growing up, Hayao Miyazaki’s beloved Spirited Away already transcends its studio-assigned demographic to achieve universal appeal, but it’s the director’s decision to allow his narrative to breathe – visually, thematically, morally – that solidifies his film as one of the decade’s best. For though the plot that drives the story centers on a young girl’s path toward self-discovery, it also functions as a mirror held up to Miyazaki’s home country. Through the film’s various subplots and narrative detours, Spirited Away reflects a Japan in need of change. In turn, Miyazaki skewers crippling consumerism, loss of spirituality, and irresponsible treatment of the environment all in spectacularly imaginative fashion. That viewers could read optimism in its depiction of personal growth, urgency in its call to action for societal change, or both speaks to the film’s tremendous depth.\n\nSummer Hours (Dir. Olivier Assayas, France, 2008)\n\nTo counter the onslaught of hyper-relevant films falling over each other to define our current moment, Olivier Assayas delivers a quiet and moving alternative in Summer Hours that forgoes contrived narrative connectedness and plot threads ripped from the headlines to comment profoundly on the time in which we live. Assayas sidesteps the pitfalls of his contemporaries by honing in on something more universal and timeless than national current events: the family. Summer Hours, then, is a classic family drama, but it’s anchored in its early twenty-first century setting. A modern family strewn about the globe must face nostalgia and memory, learning how to carry their past into their future without clinging too tightly to what they’ve left behind after the matriarch unexpectedly passes away. Summer Hours shows the faces and personalities of those affected by this increasingly globalized world without reducing them to archetypes.\n\nSyndromes and a Century (Dir. Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Thailand, 2006)\n\nBuilding upon its predecessor’s themes, structure, and even a few of its anecdotes, Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s Syndromes and a Century takes his now career-defining fractured narrative form to its logical conclusion: a story twice told. Weerasethakul pays homage to his parents – one from the country, the other from the city – by telling the sort-of tale of the beginning of their romance. Eschewing traditional storytelling, Weerasethakul utilizes the same actors and the same scene-setting premise to launch both halves – one set in a rural hospital, the other in a bustling urban medical center – to deliver a quiet, yet affecting meditation on the rural/urban divide. But, rather than structure the second half as a mere replica of the first, Weerasethakul cleverly subverts viewer expectations with diverging subplots that tell different stories, yet mirror the themes of those in the first. As two sides of the same coin, Weerasethakul’s film is contemplative cinema at its finest: rife with symbolic depth, yet subtly humorous in its casual execution.\n\nTen (Dir. Abbas Kiarostami, Iran, 2002)\n\nOne of cinema’s greatest living masters challenges his chosen medium once again, this time by intentionally limiting the role of the director and constructing narrative cinema within highly restrictive constraints. With Ten, Abbas Kiarostami captures his subjects entirely within the confines of a car roaming the streets of Tehran – the logical conclusion of his vehicular-obsessed cinema. An Iranian woman carries on ten conversations, split into numbered segments in the film, with relatives, friends, and strangers – mostly women – as she goes about her day. The film, almost exclusively composed of dual static shots of the driver and passenger seats, bears a naturalism indicative of all Kiarostami’s work, but these ten conversations strung together form a thesis statement of sorts on what it looks like to be a woman in modern-day Iran. Thus, perhaps taking a cue from his former protégé Jafar Panahi, Kiarostami’s always-challenging work welcomes a social commentary that lends this filmic experiment a remarkably powerful pull.\n\nThere Will Be Blood (Dir. Paul Thomas Anderson, United States, 2007)\n\nTwo pillars of American individualism – capitalist entrepreneurialism and personal faith – collide in Paul Thomas Anderson’s towering There Will Be Blood. Many a critic read relevant political subtext in Anderson’s film, citing a skewering of a nation’s unpopular conservative administration, but this kneejerk interpretation ultimately proves unhelpful in hindsight. How does one account for the opposing forces in Anderson’s work that were strategically tied together in the then-current conservative platform? Instead, it seems, Anderson’s allegory here is far more nuanced, perhaps even suggesting a failure of the traditional American spirit that transcends the nation’s entire history. Given its loose narrative and wandering trajectory, There Will Be Blood is first and foremost a film of powerful images. Anderson’s every frame is filled with metaphorical depth, and the ferocity with which he builds his jaw-dropping set pieces serves to overturn the long-standing notion of American exceptionalism for an increasingly disillusioned age.\n\nTropical Malady (Dir. Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Thailand, 2004)\n\nIf directors Hou and Kiarostami collectively dominated the Nineties, then this decade belongs to Apichatpong Weerasethakul. His answer to the formalist deconstruction of Kiarostami and the elliptical storytelling of Hou is a living, breathing cinema – one boasting a modernist self-reflexivity that draws attention to itself as cinema accompanied by a humble spirituality and a playfulness to counter the skepticism of a former age – that feels refreshingly of the moment and far enough removed from any given moment that it also appears timeless. Thus, it’s only fitting that the director of the decade should have two films on this list. His later Syndromes and a Century may be the finest example of his bifurcated narrative structure, but Tropical Malady remains his most readily engaging, delightfully enchanting, and emotionally resonant. The first half’s unhurried romance unfolding linearly abruptly ends halfway through and is given new, allegorical life in the second as a mystical fable involving animals and spirits that echoes the story in the first. Both segments beautifully complement one another, and taken together Tropical Malady is one captivating watch.\n\nWALL*E (Dir. Andrew Stanton, United States, 2008)\n\nIn what is probably the most artfully composed piece of pop culture to bear the Disney brand name, the Pixar team works wonders with this tender tale of robots in love against a startlingly grim picture of our future world. Andrew Stanton’s WALL*E begins on a desolate, uninhabited earth where humans have escaped the consequences of their own recklessness, and only a curious, trash-collecting android remains to purge the land. The film’s first half is near revelatory as an inspired ode to an era of silent film comedies that then gives way to a rather frank critique of American consumerism, laziness, and careless treatment of our planet in its second half. These scenes of humankind at its worst are unfortunately remarkably prescient, as only a few years on from WALL*E‘s release, our race is already showing signs of alarming dependence on technology. Like Miyazaki’s Spirited Away, Stanton’s cautionary, yet ultimately hopeful work appropriately appeases its intended audience, then blows past this demographic to achieve something more.\n\nWerckmeister Harmonies (Dir. Béla Tarr, Hungary, 2000)\n\nKnown for his unparalleled use of lengthy takes and stark black and white photography, Béla Tarr is the master of slow cinema. This decade he has crafted yet another masterpiece with his staggering Werckmeister Harmonies, a film comprised of not more than forty shots in an industry that favors several hundreds per film on average. What appears on screen, then, is understandably deliberately and meticulously choreographed and photographed. Harmonies is a film of powerful images – the opening barroom dance of metaphorical celestial bodies, a rotting whale carcass in the middle of a town’s square, rioters who ransack a hospital and only come to a halt when faced with the vulnerability and fragility of human life – and deep philosophical import. And yet, Tarr offers no easy interpretations as to what it all means, though an undercurrent of tumultuous Hungarian history in a post-Soviet world is present throughout.\n\nYi Yi (Dir. Edward Yang, Taiwan, 2000)\n\nPerhaps Edward Yang’s optimistic corrective to his bleak masterstroke A Brighter Summer Day, the director’s final film Yi Yi functions as a fitting swansong for an artist who had an uncanny pulse on humanity. His last film is a family saga in the vein of his and his contemporary Hou Hsiao-hsien’s early work that takes its time in weeding out the details of multiple characters’ lives that, taken together, paints a holistic portrait of a modern-day Taiwanese family. Though, of course, these daily, relational, professional, and moral concerns are fundamentally universal. Yang’s characters experience successes, failures of their own doing, tragic loss, and ultimately growth over the course of the film’s lengthy runtime – essentially, we see them live. It’s a poignant and rewarding film that sheds light on the pitfalls of average people, but also ultimately celebrates what it means to be human.\n\nHonorable Mention:\n\n35 Shots of Rum (Dir. Claire Denis, France, 2008) – for its beautifully choreographed scene that hinges tension and character development on body language and a perfectly cued pop song\n\n2046 (Dir. Wong Kar-wai, Hong Kong, 2004) – for its expansion of its predecessor’s themes by breaking apart that film’s tender linear narrative\n\nChildren of Men (Dir. Alfonso Cuarón, United States, 2006) – for its eschewal of dystopian genre tropes in favor of welcome religious allegory\n\nThe Circle (Dir. Jafar Panahi, Iran, 2000) – for its cleverly connected narrative threads that underscore the injustices that befall women living in modern-day Iran\n\nCity of God (Dir. Fernando Meirelles, Brazil, 2002) – for its brutal, yet stylish depiction of coming of age amidst gang violence in Rio de Janeiro’s favelas\n\nThe Death of Mr. Lazarescu (Dir. Cristi Puiu, Romania, 2005) – for its realist meditation on the inevitability of death and failing bureaucracies\n\nI’m Not There (Dir. Todd Haynes, United States, 2007) – for its schizophrenic depiction of its equally eccentric and enigmatic central mythic figure\n\nLost in Translation (Dir. Sophia Coppola, United States, 2003) – for its humorous depiction of a nation through the eyes of a tourist\n\nNo Country for Old Men (Dir. Joel & Ethan Coen, United States, 2007) – for its successful adaptation of a difficult work that establishes a firm authorial voice distinct from that of its source\n\nPlatform (Dir. Jia Zhang-ke, China, 2000) – for its subtly evolving aesthetic that mirrors the decades-spanning national changes at the center of its narrative\n\nPride & Prejudice (Dir. Joe Wright, United Kingdom, 2005) – for its dedication to its beloved text while exploring the cinematic possibilities of literary adaptation\n\nWendy and Lucy (Dir. Kelly Reichardt, United States, 2008) – for its intimate, realist depiction of the effects of a widespread economic downturn\n\n(Dir. Abbas Kiarostami, Iran, 1999)\n\nA Matter of Life and Death\n\nAbbas Kiarostami’s cinema is almost immediately recognizable as his and his alone. From the inner-city of Tehran to the vast countryside of northern Iran to far-flung locations such as Italy and Tokyo, there are certain traits that mark each of his films typically within minutes – wide shots, automobiles in motion, non-actors, people talking in automobiles, blurry distinctions between fiction and reality, and, oh yeah, more automobiles. Moreover, much of Kiarostami’s work throughout the ‘90s – inarguably his golden period – dealt with the overall theme of the preciousness of life. Whether from the stories of survivors of Iran’s major 1990 earthquake or one man on the verge of suicide, Kiarostami found reasons to celebrate life. His final feature of the decade The Wind Will Carry Us, then, represents the culmination of his ‘90s output in likely his most serene and contemplative film yet.\n\nThe film opens with a wide shot mirroring the memorable final shot of Life, And Nothing More thus bringing us back to the spacious rural areas of northern Iran after the Tehran-set Taste of Cherry. A car snakes through a winding road along a dusty hillside as the passengers within mockingly attempt to make sense of the directions to their unnamed destination sans street signs or practical landmarks. It is immediately obvious that these three men are city dwellers. They soon come across a young boy who tells them that he’s been instructed to wait for them and escort them to his village nearby. The vehicle stumbles upon the village as it turns a corner, and Kiarostami captures this beautiful little town in glorious wide shot. The village, made up of white plaster homes appearing as if stacked on top of each other, is nestled into the side of a hill, and the passengers, like us, are struck by the overwhelming sight.\n\nAs the car stalls at the bottom of the hill, two of the passengers emerge to try to get it to start again, and the other follows the young boy up the side of the hill to retrieve water. As the pair climbs, Kiarostami establishes these two as the film’s major protagonists – Behzad Dorani the crass and short-tempered engineer and Farzad Sohrabi his ten-year old companion and guide through the labyrinth and customs of this quaint rural town. And, as usual, the characters’ names match those of the actors playing them. The majority of the film follows Behzad as he explores the hillside village with Farzad waiting to fulfill his not-so-secret mission of capturing a grieving ceremony following the death of an elderly matriarch. Behzad and his colleagues are photojournalists, and though most of the villagers know this, he insists on the secrecy of their assignment.\n\nMuch to his chagrin, the woman begins regaining her health. The three to four-day expedition turns into a two-week stay, and Behzad’s colleagues, though never shown on camera, become restless. Unlike him, they rarely emerge from their room unless going off to pick strawberries. The engineer’s willingness to engage in the culture – though he’s often an inconvenience to the villager’s way of life – is crucial for his character development that takes place over the course of the film. Time and again, this urbanite’s fast-paced living clashes with the slower pace, ease, and traditionalism of this small town. This is most evident in one of the film’s repeated sequences where Behzad’s mobile phone rings, and he’s forced to race down the hill, get in the car, and drive to a nearby hilltop to obtain a better signal. In one of these scenes, he runs through the plaster homes and the car speedily drives down the road kicking up a cloud of dust in the background, while a boy casually leads a herd of cattle across the frame in the foreground. It’s a brilliant juxtaposition of two cultures at ends with one another. The man commits a whole slew of cultural taboos during his stay – unknowingly stomping all over graves at the village’s nearby cemetery while on the phone, non-discretely snapping photographs of various townspeople, making a similar mistake as the director from Through the Olive Trees by asking a young woman her name – and yet the villagers tolerate and even accept his overbearing presence nonetheless.\n\nPerhaps of all these offenses, his most egregious is his poor treatment of Farzad. The boy accommodates and even befriends the man, yet Behzad repeatedly abuses the boy’s kindness keeping him late for school, pulling him out of sitting exams to ask him questions, and treating him with sarcasm. It’s clear Behzad enjoys the company of his young companion, but it’s a friendship he fails to appreciate until it’s too late – he snaps at poor Farzad for divulging information about the old woman’s condition to his impatient colleagues and asks him to return only when he has good news. It’s important to note that “good news” to Behzad would be that the woman quickly approaches her death so he can shoot the ceremony. Here, Kiarostami ultimately reveals Behzad’s greatest sin of all: though he continually exhibits a disregard for the customs and ways of these villagers, his lack of respect for the sanctity of life in general keeps him from experiencing it to the fullest.\n\nThe film’s appropriately slow-moving pace mirrors the lifestyle of this rural village, and it believably offers adequate time for the transformation Behzad experiences come film’s end. Over the course of these two weeks, he slowly softens toward many of these traditions and more patiently engages with the townspeople seemingly more willing to achieve understanding. The film’s narrative – if it can even be called that – comes to a head when a hole caves in on a man digging a spot for a future telecommunications pole. Behzad converses with this unseen man throughout the film during his many trips to high ground for reception, and one such occasion he witnesses the man get buried alive. Now racing in the opposite direction, his car speeds through the valley to alert the other workers of the man’s situation. When he lends out his vehicle for a group of men to rush the unconscious man to a nearby hospital, he’s paired with the region’s traveling physician.\n\nOn the back of the doctor’s motorcycle – a sequence captured in beautiful wide shot of the expanse of rolling fields of tall grass – Kiarostami’s primary concern bubbles to the surface. As an educated man, Behzad initially thinks he’ll find common ground with the doctor, but he soon realizes that this man too prefers to the quiet, laidback life of the countryside to the bustle of the city. Behzad asserts that idleness leads to evil (perhaps a guilty admission of how he treated Farzad), but the doctor claims that death is the worst ailment of all. With death, there’s no more basking in the beauty of this life. And when Behzad protests with obligatory religious notions of an afterlife, the doctor claims to prefer the present to the promises of an uncertain future. It’s a remarkably humane, poignant, and again life-affirming dialogue between the two, and one that inevitably leaves Behzad changed.\n\nHe returns to the village and takes a few pictures of a procession of mourners, but ultimately Kiarostami offers yet another ambiguous ending. Does the old woman eventually die? Does Behzad shoot the ceremony? Do he and Farzad make amends? It should be expected at this point in Kiarostami’s oeuvre that he encourages his audience to choose their own ending. But, the film’s final moments do provide some resolve for Behzad. He decidedly tosses a femur bone that he found earlier in the cemetery into the nearby stream, and the camera follows it float by until it cuts to the credits. He finally rejects the fascination with and the carelessness with which he so casually treated death – wishing for the old woman’s fate sooner rather than later for the sole purpose of completing his professional assignment – by disposing of the constant reminder lingering on the dashboard of his car. The doctor’s admonition to respect life has settled in. And, Kiarostami never hides the fact that it took escaping his fast-paced existence in the urban sprawl of Tehran to discover the meaning of appreciating life itself.\n\nThus, while The Wind Will Carry Us lacks the complexity of his unofficial Koker trilogy or narrative inventiveness of Close-Up or the audacious climax of Taste of Cherry, it’s perhaps Kiarostami’s most complete film. It’s at once a furtherance of his solid life-affirming principles, a thoughtful mediation on the divide between urban and rural existence, a quite humorous story unlike his former work (amusing non-sequiturs abound – “it’s a bone not a shoe”), and another engaging puzzle piece for his audience to actively complete. It stands as a fitting, final masterpiece for the decade that solidified Kiarostami’s reputation as one of cinema’s greatest masters.\n\nAnd now the top ten!\n\n10. The Thin Red Line (Dir. Terrence Malick, United States, 1998)\n\n“I’ve seen another world.”\n\nTerrence Malick’s return to film after a twenty-year hiatus found him furthering the vision he established with Days of Heaven. In many ways, The Thin Red Line is an apt successor to that gorgeous film and a furtherance of his growing majestic aesthetic. There is voiceover narration, but the increased number of voices amplifies the technique. Violence features heavily, but this story centers on an all-out war rather than just the actions of a few. The beauty of the natural world plays a prominent role, but here Malick offers it up as the salvation from human brutality. The Thin Red Line, then, represents the first convergence of the master’s major strengths and concerns. It stands as the greatness that both Badlands and Days of Heaven promised.\n\nSo, what then do we make of this violent, broken world? Malick never shies away from depicting destruction and despair – the film’s actual WWII-set backdrop ensures this grounding in the real world. He’s intent on showing that it is in fact humankind that has sown the seeds of its own demise, and this cruelty threatens to bring down the whole earth with it. But, significantly, Malick also reveals that where there is beauty, there is also hope. In the character of Private Witt, Malick offers redemption. The wonder-struck soldier embodies grace, kindness, and sacrificial love – the marks of true humanity, the fulfillment of goodness.\n\nFor a Hollywood war film featuring a slew of A-listers, The Thin Red Line is deeply philosophical, inherently spiritual, and breathtakingly beautiful as Malick’s camera captures the wonders of this world to counter those bent on destroying it. Beauty can’t be snuffed out, however, and in the film’s final hopeful shot Malick assures us that life always prevails.\n\n09. La jetée (Dir. Chris Marker, France, 1962)\n\n“There is no escape out of time.”\n\nMade up of not more than a collection of photographs (and one brief, breathtaking clip of footage), Chris Marker’s La jetée somehow manages to be an utterly captivating sci-fi film that offers a fresh perspective on the oft-explored notion of time travel. Moreover, its very construct challenges the traditional ways in which we understand cinema and subsequently offers one of the medium’s most unique works of art. Marker’s film does indeed tell a story relying upon thought provoking voiceover narration and sound effects to accompany the stark black and white stills.\n\nTime travel and post-apocalyptic settings are tired genre clichés today, but in Marker’s eschewal of filmed action or expository dialogue – both major flaws of similarly themed films – he arrives at something much more nuanced and philosophical. Instead of the cataclysmic, widespread implications of traveling through time, La jetée narrows its focus on the effects it might have on one time traveler. In a post-WWIII era, a man is chosen by a clandestine group of progressive scientists to visit both past and future in an attempt to rescue the present. He is haunted by one particular memory from his past that the scientists seek to exploit. When he begins to fall in love with a mysterious woman, his anchor to the past, he wonders what it might take to abandon the present and live with her in the past for good.\n\nA love story and an exploration of the power that memories hold over us, La jetée is a remarkable and unforgettable film that has influenced works as disparate as action flicks, cartoons, and romantic comedies alike. It’s a beautiful meditation on the past and how we remember it, and in its shocking finale, it adds fuel to the flame that is the discussion of how time travel might actually affect us some day.\n\n08. The Passion of Joan of Arc (Dir. Carl Theodor Dreyer, France, 1928)\n\n“Will I be with you tonight in paradise?”\n\nSo few films are expertly technically accomplished and achieve depths of powerful emotion, but Carl Theodor Dreyer’s landmark The Passion of Joan of Arc is certainly one of those rare gems. Dreyer broke new ground with this masterpiece by challenging the mainstays of the silent era – he shot performers in extreme close-ups atypically wearing no make-up and incorporated a host of unusual and innovative camera angles to serve the themes and narrative of the film. Furthermore, Dreyer demonstrated an early disavowal of censorship and traditional political correctness in portraying the early Catholic Church as the enemy of his martyred protagonist.\n\nBy nature, Joan of Arc is a religious film – as all of Dreyer’s works are in some way – but it is also beautifully human in its portrayal of this divisive religious figure, once despised and now revered. The film reveals very little about the woman’s life or past and is instead entirely concerned with her infamous trial before the French clergymen loyal to the English. The injustice of the trial’s outcome alone is enough to claim Joan of Arc as an unparalleled cinematic tragedy, and yet it’s Maria Falconetti’s iconic performance as the titular heroine that solidifies Dreyer’s film as one of the most emotionally devastating films of all time. Falconetti captures the raw emotion of a figure admirably devoted to her God, yet still terrified as she approaches an imminent, violent end.\n\nIf a large number of silent era films haven’t aged as well with the advancement of technology or widespread societal changes in taste, we respect them as the classics all the same. Not so with Dreyer’s Joan of Arc – it’s aged remarkably well and remains one of cinema’s most shattering experiences regardless of its pre-sound, pre-color release date. And, it’s likely it’ll continue to influence new filmmakers as long as the medium remains.\n\n07. City of Sadness (Dir. Hou Hsiao-hsien, Taiwan, 1989)\n\n“I think I’ll be happy.”\n\nHou Hsiao-hsien’s City of Sadness is a historical epic of the highest order. Its scope is reserved, narrowing in on one particular family affected by the events of the film, but in doing so, Hou manages to touch on the cultural and political crisis of the Taiwanese at a crucial juncture in the nation’s volatile history. The film concerns the 228 Incident and the subsequent White Terror that found native Taiwanese persecuted, imprisoned, and murdered at the hands of the new Chinese mainland government after the handover from Japan in 1945. It’s a complex work that chronicles many actual historical incidents – many of which may be foreign to Western viewers – but Hou’s treatment of the matter as well as his blossoming, engrossing aesthetic elevate City of Sadness to its position as a cinematic masterpiece.\n\nEach of the director’s stylistic flourishes is on full display here – long takes largely comprised of static and medium or wide shots, meditative pacing, and elliptical storytelling. This last point is worth highlighting for though this narrative structure is no invention of Hou’s, Sadness probably features the finest example of it in all of cinema. Much of the action takes place off screen, and crucial events in the life of the Lin family occur within the seconds between scene transitions. Too, his curious use of flashbacks or sometimes-concurrent events sans much context ensures that viewer participation is imperative when engaging Hou’s film.\n\nIn this way, Hou has crafted a narrative film like no other. It’s a beautiful portrait of a family that experiences national tragedy on a small scale, but in focusing thus, Hou captures the national climate and identity crisis that has inflicted the small island of Taiwan for generations. The pervasive sentiment looming over City of Sadness is, of course, sorrow, but it’s surely a supreme work of art not to be missed nonetheless.\n\n06. 2001: A Space Odyssey (Dir. Stanley Kubrick, United States, 1968)\n\n“It can only be attributable to human error.”\n\nChallenging the notion of human progress, Stanley Kubrick traverses humankind’s history from our prehistoric ancestors to the imagined future of exploiting the universe’s final frontier in the sci-fi classic 2001: A Space Odyssey. Kubrick, ever the notorious perfectionist, achieves nothing short of perfection for the first time with this work, one where his pessimistic ideologies meet his characteristically cold, yet striking visual palette. The film is a visually sumptuous feast with images engraved in our collective cultural conscious that could hardly be separated from the classical music pieces that accompany them – a cosmic dance of spacecrafts to Johann Strauss’ “The Blue Danube,” an ominous monolith appearing to György Ligeti’s terrifying “Requiem,” and, of course, that iconic opening eclipse set to Richard Strauss’ “Also Sprach Zarathustra.”\n\nAnd, though 2001 is primarily a film of indelible imagery, it’s also one of considerable philosophical depth. Kubrick and screenwriter Arthur C. Clarke intentionally leave much of the film’s most head-scratching sequences wondrously ambiguous – the true meaning of the imposing monolith, an astronaut’s late-film plunge into all-out surrealism, the film’s closing cosmic birth. And yet, each of these images is significant and heavy with implication; nothing ever feels forced or haplessly tossed in for shock value.\n\nWhat remains even more impressive is that for all its unanswered existential quandaries, 2001 is also probably the most thrilling sci-fi film of all time. There’s no shortage of tension-building, nail-biting moments here: most notably in the film’s longest narrative stretch concerning two deep space explorers and one murderous supercomputer named HAL, but also in the conflicts of the warring apelike beasts in 2001’s first segment, the unexplained threat of the monolith’s secret presence on the moon, or when an astronaut must confront his own identity and time itself as he ventures through a wormhole. It’s intense stuff, but Kubrick captures it all with aplomb.\n\n05. Pather Panchali (Dir. Satyajit Ray, India, 1955)\n\n“Whatever God does is for the best.”\n\nTo get the complete picture of filmmaker Satyajit Ray’s life-affirming tale of a man who stands up to the forces of personal tragedy, poverty, and injustice, it’s imperative to see the entire Apu Trilogy – comprised of Pather Panchali, Aparajito, and Apur Sansar – that documents the life of Apu from childhood to adult. But, if there’s one of the three films that stands out and even stands on its own, it’s the story’s first chapter and Ray’s debut feature Pather Panchali.\n\nAt its core, the film is a coming-of-age story centered on young Apu as he’s born into an impoverished Bengali family living in early-twentieth century rural India. Ray beautifully and nostalgically captures a world seen through the eyes of a child – the thrill of traveling salesmen and their merchandise from the city, donning a paper-made crown and becoming a ruling prince, turning the natural world around him into his playground, gaping in awe at a train rushing by – and yet Pather Panchali is fleshed out enough to maturely turn its gaze outward as well. Though Apu is the film’s primary concern, Ray also lends ample time to his struggling parents who face both familial and societal pressure to provide a better life for their two children and maintain their crumbling ancestral home.\n\nIt’s a powerful and devastating portrait of extreme poverty, more than likely the best depiction of it in all of cinema. Though many films have taken poverty as their central theme, so few do so without sensationalizing turmoil or marginalizing those experiencing it. Ray’s film does neither; it showcases poverty without showboating, and in doing so he deeply humanizes Apu’s family and those the world over who fight to get by from day to day. It wouldn’t be an honest coming-of-age drama without the loss of innocence, and though the reality of death comes to claim those Apu loves, there’s a whiff of hope in the film’s final scene. Ray wondrously suggests there’s always hope when there’s resilience to live.\n\n04. Close-Up (Dir. Abbas Kiarostami, Iran, 1990)\n\n“Some things are more complex than they seem…”\n\nAbbas Kiarostami has made a career of toying with reality and fiction, blurring the lines to somewhat astounding effects. Many a film later, Close-Up remains his masterpiece. He seamlessly weaves between documentary and narrative as the individuals involved in the true story of a man who dupes a family into believing he’s a famous filmmaker play themselves in a reenactment of the events. That Kiarostami convinced all parties involved – victims, imposter, and peripheral characters – to relive this incident that led to litigation and presumably cajoled the presiding judge to film during the actual proceedings is a feat in and of itself, but it’s what Kiarostami does with this material that elevates the work to a near stroke of genius.\n\nFor though the filmmaker impressively plays with cinematic form to tell this story, the finished product is also much, much more than just the sum of its unique parts. It represents a radical shift in documentary filmmaking, and yet it also wily underscores the impossibility of crafting a true documentary – something will always be staged. It’s remarkably sympathetic to all parties involved including the “perpetrator” Sabzian, and yet it never acquits him or others for our human instinct to bend the truth. And, perhaps most cunningly, it’s an (mostly) honest document of actual events, and yet it also plays as a thought-provoking mediation on the farce of cinema itself.\n\nThrough these proceedings, Kiarostami seems to suggest that those behind and in front of the camera aren’t that much different than the ambitious Sabzian himself. He may be pretending to be someone he’s not, but aren’t Kiarostami and his crew doing just that any time they set out to craft cinema? In the imposter, it seems, Kiarostami has found the perfect subject for his work and someone through whom he even explores his own identity as a filmmaker.\n\n03. Tokyo Story (Dir. Yasujiro Ozu, Japan, 1953)\n\n“Isn’t life disappointing?”\n\nFamily plays a central role in the entire history of narrative cinema; and it should, because familial relationships – good and bad – are key in making most of us who we are. Fittingly, many of the films on this list deal explicitly with family dynamics, and five in the top ten alone feature a family unit of some sort prominently in their narratives. Of those, Yasujiro Ozu’s classic Tokyo Story ranks as perhaps the greatest family drama in the history of film.\n\nMore than any other filmmaker represented on this list, Ozu’s distinct authorial and stylistic traits are on full display in nearly every single one of his films (especially from 1949’s Late Spring onward). They are so easily recognizable that one needn’t be a fan nor film student to guess if he or she is watching an Ozu film. He made a career of mastering domestic dramas concerning postwar middle-class Japanese families with a handful of oft-repeated dilemmas. He shot most of them similarly with meticulously staged static shots filmed at his innovative tatami-level angle. Yet, with this relative homogeneity in his works, each one is distinct enough and crafted expertly enough that it never feels as though he’s simply repeating himself.\n\nAnd, though a number of his late-period films are worth dissecting and revisiting again and again, none is as deeply profound, heartbreaking, or poignant as Tokyo Story. The many themes he explored throughout his career – Japan’s recovery and developing modernity, shifting societal mores, pressure to marry off daughters, generational miscommunication – all converge here in one succinct story. But, at its heart, it’s the heart-wrenching story of aging parents irresponsibly cast aside by their grown children and the natural consequences that befall them for shirking familial duty. No major conflicts or life events occur onscreen over the course of Tokyo Story; no, Ozu’s work is too subtle for that. Instead, he beautifully crafts the greatest treatise on family and the generations that come before and after with all the familiar touchstones of his mighty career – one that has solidified him as one of cinema’s most revered masters.\n\n02. In the Mood for Love (Dir. Wong Kar-wai, Hong Kong, 2000)\n\n“He remembers those vanished years.”\n\nAt once beautiful and tragic, Wong Kar-wai’s greatest film delicately balances its engaging narrative with the filmmaker’s stunning visual aesthetic better than most films on this list. Wong is a daring artist; one with a bold vision that shaped late-twentieth century cinema, and In the Mood for Love remains one of the most important films of this new century. If the age of film will be remembered for how it evoked memories, courted nostalgia, and altered our perception of time even if just for the two hours when the theatre lights went dim, then Wong’s film is a miniature time capsule of cinema itself.\n\nConcerned with the memories that haunt our pasts and inherently nostalgic for the days of eras gone by, In the Mood for Love tells a timeless tale of love – an accidental romance that creeps up on its two unsuspecting characters. Bolstered by touching performances by his impeccable leads, Wong’s film transports us to the Hong Kong of the early Sixties as he uses this backdrop to explore his usual themes of urban alienation and emotional longing.\n\nIn addition to superb performances from Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung and the intricately woven narrative that Wong weaves, In the Mood for Love is also a film of unforgettable images – lonely neighbors separately walking in slow motion to a noodle stand, a polite dinner that turns to confession, Cheung’s parade of gorgeous dresses, two near-lovers standing in the shadows of a dimly lit alley, the pair silently trapped in a room waiting for the end of a marathon mahjong game, billowy crimson drapes concealing a secret rendezvous, a dashing Leung smoking against a brick wall, the haunted corridors of Angkor Wat. The love between Mrs. Chan and Mr. Chow may never materialize into a future together, but they – and we – will never forget the fleeting moments they shared.\n\n01. The Tree of Life (Dir. Terrence Malick, United States, 2011)\n\n“Help each other. Love everyone. Every leaf. Every ray of light. Forgive.”\n\nFilm has long been excused as little more than just entertainment. Over the years, the other art forms have fared better. Sure, there are bargain bin novels and radio fodder pop, but no one argues the merits of Tolstoy or Mozart. Why then is it so difficult for the masses to accept Welles or Kubrick or Kiarostami or Malick as artists? Perhaps, we resist because film is the newest. Music, literature, dance, painting, sculpting, and theatre have been around for centuries, but the cinema for not more than a hundred and a few years. Movies are often viewed as the diminution of novels or less sophisticated than plays, and admittedly blockbuster studio productions don’t do the medium any favors. But, I along with likeminded cinephiles wager that film – just like the art forms that came before – can be art and should be considered as such.\n\nEnter director Terrence Malick. His films don’t strike a chord with many. They’ve often been labeled inaccessible and pretentious, but I would argue that we’ve approached them incorrectly. Malick, it seems, speaks a cinematic language of his own, and he attempts to craft works of art that are distinctly filmic. Take for example his magnum opus and my favorite film The Tree of Life. The story at the film’s center is intentionally simple, but as a film – and not a play or novel – Malick transforms it into an experience like no other. Exploring themes as heavy as the genesis of life, the existence of God, and the struggle between the way of nature and the way of grace, The Tree of Life boasts some of the most breathtaking visuals and gorgeous music ever committed to film. Thus, more than any other film on this list, The Tree of Life makes the case for cinema as art for it could only exist as a film. It’s as beautiful to look at as a painting and as delightful to listen to as a symphony, but also something more – a wondrous fusion of the visual arts that can effectively and poignantly tell a story through a rush of images, symbolism, pieces of music, philosophy, voiceover narration, and inspired performances. It’s a film that seeks to engage the whole person as he or she sits back to take it all in. And, in doing so, Malick has more than likely created the greatest film ever made.\n\nAnd now on to the top twenty!\n\n20. Make Way for Tomorrow (Dir. Leo McCarey, United States, 1937)\n\n“Honor thy father and mother.”\n\nAny film significant enough to influence cinematic master Yasujiro Ozu is undoubtedly worthy of our attention today in spite of its accepted “forgotten classic” status. And, though Ozu’s arguable opus Tokyo Story and Leo McCarey’s early Hollywood masterpiece Make Way for Tomorrow share a central concern regarding the treatment of the elderly, the filmmakers take their similarly themed narratives in separate directions. Ozu’s film charts the widespread national changes in a post-war Japan within the context of one family whose grown children find their pace and modern way of life suddenly inconsistent with the slower, more traditional manner in which their aging parents still live.\n\nMcCarey’s film likewise anticipates this gap in generational understanding, but he’s far more concerned with the trajectory of the relationship between the father and mother than he is the one between parents and their ungrateful children, though he poignantly captures that too. McCarey’s story is a beautifully tender tale of new romance as its septuagenarian couple rediscovers their love when faced with an unexpected, perhaps definite separation.\n\nThe stark contrast between Make Way for Tomorrow and more well-established canonical classics is staggering. Where other Hollywood staples from American cinema’s supposed golden age have all but faded in relevance, McCarey’s remains surprisingly fresh. Its depiction of romantic love between two elderly characters is still unparalleled in film today, and its challenge of the traditional family unit still shocks. And, McCarey’s ability to oscillate between humor and tragedy, sometimes within the course of a few lines of memorable dialogue, elevates his film from trite cliché or pandering sentimentalism, but it achieves considerable depths of pathos to remain of cinema’s most emotionally devastating works of art.\n\n19. M (Dir. Fritz Lang, Germany, 1931)\n\n“I can’t help what I do!”\n\nIn Fritz Lang’s M, little Elsie Beckmann is in grave danger when there’s a twisted child killer on the loose. And, Lang stages one of the most unsettling, yet effective sequences in all of cinema as he introduces the murderer by way of his shadow on his own wanted poster all while the girl’s mother, waiting at home, grows increasingly anxious regarding her daughter’s tardiness. Finally, a static shot of the girl’s empty dinner chair gives way to a pair of shots of her ball rolling away and her balloon getting caught in telephone wires. It’s a terrifying and audacious introduction to this chilling cat-and-mouse tale that still stuns audiences today.\n\nThe film follows the police as they desperately try to catch this criminal, the murderer – played to eerie perfection by Peter Lorre in a career-high performance – as he evades his captors, and the city’s organized underworld of crime as it too bands together to oust this chief of sinners. The tension builds, and Lang’s shifting camera catches these three sides from every possible angle in the proto-noir style he helped pioneer. It also remains one of the most thrilling early talkies with its densely layered soundtrack as well as intentionally disturbing bouts of silence.\n\nBut, what really sets M apart from its contemporaries and the films it influenced is its unexpected finale that finds criminals in the judge’s seat as they get to the killer before the authorities. In front of a host of wrongdoers and even other murderers, this child killer’s sins are laid bare, and when a plea of insanity finds the man on hands and knees, Lang draws our attention to the great hypocrisy unfolding that may even garner our sympathy for this mentally unstable individual in desperate need of help. We’re left to wonder: are our lives free enough of blemishes that we might cast the first stone?\n\n18. The 400 Blows (Dir. François Truffaut, France, 1959)\n\n“Sometimes I’d tell them the truth and they still wouldn’t believe me, so I prefer to lie.”\n\nHas another film better captured the oftentimes-ignored challenges of adolescence quite like François Truffaut’s The 400 Blows? The relatively minor problems facing today’s youth are mercilessly mocked in our culture, but Truffaut’s best film offers an unbelievably rare, sympathetic snapshot of a troubled teenager as he’s neglected and misunderstood at home and at school. Antoine Doinel – immortalized by Jean-Pierre Léaud in one of cinema’s greatest child performances – acts out, concocts elaborate falsities, skips class, cheats on assignments, and regularly steals from his parents and others, and he hardly ever shows remorse.\n\nIf it sounds like young Antoine is a good-for-nothing troublemaker who deserves his comeuppance that finds him locked up in a local jail cell and then shipped off to a juvenile delinquent center, then Truffaut brilliantly subverts our expectations in a heartbreaking late-film scene as more is revealed about the boy’s messy home life. In this way, The 400 Blows is a quintessential example of the legendary French New Wave it helped pioneer – it’s honest, realistic, never sentimental, and yet still incredibly moving.\n\nAs far as the film’s style, it might not bear as many hallmarks of the movement as Godard’s epochal Breathless, yet it boasts a host of memorable set pieces – an aerial view of schoolboys mischievously breaking from formation as they march down Parisian streets, several shots of expressive children captivated by a puppet show, tears streaming down Antoine’s face as he clings to the bars of the police truck ending his life as he knows it, and, of course, that iconic freeze frame that ends Truffaut’s equally unforgettable masterpiece.\n\n17. Taste of Cherry (Dir. Abbas Kiarostami, Iran, 1997)\n\n“You want to give it all up? You want to give up the taste of cherries?”\n\nSo few filmmakers extol the preciousness of life without sinking to the tropes of melodrama or pandering sentimentalism, but the work of Abbas Kiarostami is a welcome exception. His entire Nineties output found ways to celebrate life – whether amidst the aftermath of a devastating earthquake as in Life, And Nothing More and Through the Olive Trees, or in the juxtaposition of differing traditions in The Wind Will Carry Us, or when a person decides to end his own life as in his masterpiece Taste of Cherry.\n\nNotably more linear than his other Nineties triumph Close-Up, Taste of Cherry is still by no means an easy or readily accessible film. Its story wanders as its subject drives around Tehran looking for someone to bury his body after he commits suicide. Understandably turned down by most people he encounters, Mr. Badii’s story becomes a meditation on life and death as three different men give very different reasons for their disapproval of his actions. It’s not the first two men’s objections – a fear of the law and an appeal to religious morality – that give him reason to pause and reflect, but the third man’s focus on all that Badii would give up if he gave up on life. The sun rising over the horizon, the sound of children playing, the taste of cherries – the small wonders are what make life worth living.\n\nThe fate of our protagonist is intentionally vague. Kiarostami’s penchant for viewer participation is never more apparent than here. He invites us to finish the story, and what we as an audience bring to the table will provide Badii’s story with a proper conclusion. And, lest we forget that we’re just watching a movie, Kiarostami brilliantly reminds us in the film’s subversive final moments that still have fans scratching their heads to this day.\n\nRead the full evaluation here.\n\n16. Ordet (Dir. Carl Theodor Dreyer, Denmark, 1955)\n\n“Is it crazy to wish to rescue life?”\n\nHeavily influenced by his strict Christian upbringing, Carl Th. Dreyer’s entire oeuvre grapples with matters of faith and tradition in one way or another. But, none can contend with the religious complexity of his masterpiece Ordet. Skewering Christianity is easy and frankly uninspired in film today, but Dreyer opts for something different here. He gives nearly every side – clergy, science, fundamentalism, agnosticism – a voice as each must reckon with a tragedy that hits close to home.\n\nThese disparate viewpoints realistically inhabit the very lifelike world Dreyer creates both in the rich complexity of his characterizations and the unparalleled masterful staging he utilizes to populate his frame. If Dreyer revolutionized the use of the close-up in his earlier work The Passion of Joan of Arc, then Ordet finds him conquering the medium wide shot. The film, then, inevitably bears a theatrical quality as Dreyer maximizes his actors’ performances for heavy emotional impact. And yet, Dreyer’s work is unmistakably cinematic. His use of stark lighting and shadows is staggering, effectively haunting. Even when his characters escape the home where the majority of the film’s narrative transpires into the open air, the weight of his material still manages to suffocate.\n\nFor though there are enough dramatic cues and genuine pathos to engage his audience, Ordet is also deeply contemplative and metaphorical. Dreyer foregrounds dichotomies that divide humankind: science and faith, rich and poor, progressivism and tradition. And yet, strip away these classist, religious, and academic divisions and everyone must face the reality of life and death. It is in this final polarity that Dreyer discovers what it truly means to be human – we all must meet death one day, but as long as there is life, we should try to live it.\n\nRead the full evaluation here.\n\n15. Seven Samurai (Dir. Akira Kurosawa, Japan, 1954)\n\n“Again we are defeated.”\n\nThough others tried their hand at it before and since, there is only one director so closely associated with the samurai film: Akira Kurosawa. And, though his contributions to the Japanese sub-genre were many – Rashômon, Throne of Blood, Yojimbo, Sanjuro, and Ran to name a few of the most celebrated – he’s best known (and rightly so) for one of his earliest: Seven Samurai. An epic in every sense of the word, Kurosawa’s film remains the legendary director’s greatest achievement precisely because it features everything he did best: elaborate sets and costumes, expertly choreographed battle sequences, caricature-like yet rich characterizations, a fine balance of romanticism surrounding samurai and accurately portraying the despair of feudalism, and a tinge of late-film cynicism regarding humanity.\n\nFurthermore, it’s difficult to even imagine the last fifty years or so of cinema without it. Seven Samurai, with its narrative comprised of hero recruitment and a central goal to unify them, has remained wildly influential shaping pockets of cinema as disparate as the American western and Pixar. It’s brilliant mix of thrills and philosophy make it one entertaining ride full of raw human emotion, humor, excitement, and even tragedy. It also stands as one of the few films nearing the four-hour mark that never bores or falters even for a minute.\n\nKurosawa famously collaborated with two Japanese greats during his career – Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune – and with Seven Samurai he brings them together to deliver career-high performances as the polar opposite leaders of the ragtag band of samurai enlisted to protect a small and ultimately ungrateful village. The film may end on a note of sadness, but everything that comes before ensures that Kurosawa’s greatest film won’t disappoint.\n\n14. Playtime (Dir. Jacques Tati, France, 1967)\n\n“Keep up!”\n\nCertainly one of the most ambitious films of all time, Jacques Tati’s Playtime is unquestionably a feat of filmmaking to be admired. Tati famously refused to compromise his vision for his fourth feature film, thus he shot on 70mm and constructed the enormous sets seen in the film – structures so large, the lot garnered the nickname Tativille. So, what could possibly be on the director’s mind for another amusing outing for his character Monsieur Hulot that nearly bankrupted his financiers?\n\nFor all intents and purposes, Playtime is a comedy – not perhaps in the way we typically think, but rather in the spirit of silent films that relied upon visual comedy. Furthermore, Tati never resorts to slapstick or vulgar jokes for a laugh, but instead opts for subtle sight gags to satirize our rapidly modernizing world. M. Hulot is on a mission, though during the course of the film we never learn as to why. But, no matter, for his presence is merely an excuse to plop him in the midst of this chaotic and complicated age. Hulot visits an office building, an expo, an apartment complex, and a brand new restaurant, and slowly Tati reveals the utter insanity of his day’s hurried and cluttered way of life.\n\nModernity, however, is skewered only gently; there’s no resistance to technological advancement here. Instead, it seems Tati hopes we might laugh right along with him at the ensuing confusion as a shoddily constructed upscale restaurant falls to pieces as patrons arrive, or as urban residents gawk at their TV screens where their gaze has been permanently fixed, or, in the film’s final sequence, as a tour bus full of American tourists enters a traffic circle resembling a carousel and spins into a whirl of societal conformity. The film’s called Playtime after all, and Tati seems to make the best of our increasingly bizarre and overly complicated world. In the early years of a social media saturated twenty-first century, Tati’s work seems more pertinent than ever.\n\n13. Vertigo (Dir. Alfred Hitchcock, United States, 1958)\n\n“If I let you change me…will you love me?”\n\nAlfred Hitchcock’s seminal Vertigo is a stunner if there ever was one. It’s a film that demands to be seen to be believed, for on paper several aspects might raise a few eyebrows. Jimmy Stewart as a demented, obsessive lover? A Hitchcock film without any of the dry humor that propelled Rear Window to success? A murder mystery that gives away its startling reveal half way through the film? Any one of these features may leave viewers wondering how Vertigo has become the master’s most highly regarded work.\n\nAnd yet, without a doubt, Vertigo remains an unparalleled triumph in Hitchcock’s untouchable career. Utilizing a fairly simple narrative revolving around a rather convoluted murder plot, the director lathers on layers of psychological depth as Stewart’s retired police officer Scottie becomes unhinged after the death of the object of his desire Madeleine. Matters grow complicated when Judy, resembling his former love, walks into his life, and Hitchcock explores the notions of dualities and dangerous obsession.\n\nIt’s difficult to articulate what one thing makes Vertigo tick, for it’s ultimately a sum of its extraordinary pieces – a tightly wound thriller with a killer twist, a deeply unsettling and effective performance from Stewart, Bernard Herrmann’s perfectly eerie score, a lush Technicolor palette, and the sustained dread that we as the audience have no idea where Hitchcock is taking us as the film spirals deeper and deeper into its protagonist’s troubled psyche. Ultimately, Vertigo is a rather grim affair, but Hitchcock masterfully turns this material into utterly gripping stuff – easily one of the most thoroughly accomplished films of all time.\n\n12. Citizen Kane (Dir. Orson Welles, United States, 1941)\n\n“If I hadn’t been rich, I might have been a really great man.”\n\nGreatest film of all time? Who can really say with something so subjective? But, there’s a good reason Orson Welles’ Citizen Kane repeatedly appears at the top. Innovative in its technical aspects and its non-linear narrative, Kane set the stage for decades of experiments in cinema to come. Moreover, during his career Welles was a force to be reckoned with. Though his later films such as The Magnificent Ambersons and The Lady from Shanghai were plagued by studio interference and unfortunate edits, he was the sole driver behind the wheel of his debut. In addition to directing, writing, and acting in Kane, the studio granted him an unprecedented amount of control over the final cut. Thus, the film may have unintentionally triggered the notion of director as true auteur for Welles’ unmistakable touch is all over this masterpiece.\n\nRevisionist history has tried to downplay the influence of Kane, just as some cranky audiophiles attempt to disrepute The Beatles today, but I don’t believe cinematic history will allow it. Its technical achievements are still hard to miss – low-angle cinematography, impressive use of lighting and shadow, the extensive use of deep focus camerawork. These hallmarks of the classic, along with the bold narrative structure, are in full use in Hollywood to this day. To say Kane is influential is simply an understatement.\n\nAnd yet, perhaps what remains more often unsaid is what makes Welles’ film such an enduring work of art – the enigma that is Charles Foster Kane himself. Welles wrote one of film’s very best characters in this complex newspaper tycoon who’s barely understood by his closest friends and family, and who’s none the more explained by film’s end. This characterization is Welles’ greatest trick and one that makes Citizen Kane a film worth watching again and again and again.\n\n11. A Brighter Summer Day (Dir. Edward Yang, Taiwan, 1991)\n\n“Is life really that hard?”\n\nSet only a few years after the events of Hou Hsiao-hsien’s City of Sadness, Edward Yang’s A Brighter Summer Day plays like a spiritual sequel to that film, documenting another significant time period for the nation of Taiwan. Newcomers from mainland China and native Taiwanese continued to struggle toward a peaceful coexistence after the Japanese handover in 1945 well into the Sixties. Yang’s film, then, lends a voice not primarily to the men and women on either side of the divide, but rather to these people’s children. The youth at the center of the film – born during the time of this monumental political and cultural shift – are growing up without any sense of a unified identity. Thus, many of them turn to gangs to find their worth and appropriate Western pop culture to fill the void where there is none.\n\nYang’s film is an epic in scale – nearly four hours with hundreds of speaking roles – and yet it never overwhelms or appears overly ambitious. For like City of Sadness, Yang chooses to focus on how these national changes affect a few. At the center is the young Xiao Si’r (played impeccably by newcomer and future star Chang Chen) along with his family and friends as he wrestles with establishing his own identity and leaving a mark as gang leaders die off and become martyrs for their causes.\n\nAt once a poignant depiction of youth and a heartbreaking account of Taiwan’s tumultuous history, Yang’s hefty Summer Day shines brightly despite its dreary tone and aesthetic. Some may find Yang’s signature long takes and literary narrative a bit laborious, but the film more than earns every minute of its lengthy runtime featuring some of the finest child performances put to film and one of the most sincere portraits of the loss of innocence with an ending that packs a heavy emotional punch.\n\nContinue to Part IV (#10-1)\n\nLife, and Nothing More (Dir. Abbas Kiarostami, Iran, 1992)\n\nPiggybacking on the success of Close-Up’s fusion of documentary and narrative filmmaking, Kiarostami’s Life, and Nothing More marks his second attempt to redefine the rules of cinematic storytelling. In its construct alone, Life is a challenging, yet rewarding watch as it tells the fictitious story of the filmmaker who shot Kiarostami’s actual film Where Is the Friend’s Home? But, Kiarostami’s typical affirmation of life elevates this film from clever set-up to profoundly humanist as he documents a people’s resilience to keep on living in the aftermath of a devastating and life-altering earthquake.\n\nRead the full evaluation here.\n\nMother (Dir. Bong Joon-ho, South Korea, 2009)\n\nNo film has ever charted the surprisingly thin line between parental love and destructive overprotection quite like Bong Joon-ho’s thriller Mother. In the vein of Hitchcockian suspense, Bong’s film tells a gripping story with constant twists and turns with an explosive ending guaranteed to leave viewers’ jaws on the floor. No one is making genre films like Bong today; he effortlessly fuses horror, thrills, character study, and humor better than any of his contemporaries. With Mother he has crafted his greatest feature yet.\n\nMulholland Drive (Dir. David Lynch, United States, 2001)\n\nOften lauded as the last decade’s best film, David Lynch’s surrealistic tale of love and loss in Hollywood is complex, sexy, stylish, noirish, and thrilling all at once. Naomi Watts shines as both Betty and Diane, possibly split personalities or one a dream version of the other. The intrigue lies in this intentional ambiguity. Lynch offers no extra-film details to speak of, thus since its release, the Internet has been abuzz with possible solutions to the puzzle – one that will likely never be fully solved and one that is worth revisiting again and again.\n\nMy Neighbor Totoro (Dir. Hayao Miyazaki, Japan, 1988)\n\nThe halcyon days of mid-century simplicity out in the Japanese countryside are alive in Miyazaki’s delightfully nostalgic My Neighbor Totoro. Devoid of easily defined villains or major plot devices, Miyazaki’s film is truly that rare film for all ages – neither beholden to children’s movie clichés nor overly serious. It’s a simple fable of rich spirituality, tender familial relationships, and the splendor of childhood imagination. It boasts some of the master’s most memorable characters in the cuddly Totoro, the mysterious soot sprites, and the grinning Catbus.\n\nMy Night at Maud’s (Dir. Eric Rohmer, France, 1969)\n\nPhilosophy and religious debate have never been more seamlessly woven into the dialogue of a film than in Rohmer’s masterpiece My Night at Maud’s. Ever known for his talky films featuring the intellectual elite, one might assume his work comes across as lofty and cold. Not so – the conversations in Maud’s are heady, but refreshingly so. The characters are complex, but they’re also all the more real. And, though our four major characters delve into Pascal and modern liberalism, the moral quandary at the film’s center is remarkably simple. It’s as if Rohmer asks us: what would you do?\n\nRead the full evaluation here.\n\nThe New World (Dir. Terrence Malick, United States, 2005)\n\nDirector Terrence Malick seems to have found the perfect subject for his particular brand of wonder in the historical figure of Pocahontas. The New World tells the sort-of story of the beginning of Jamestown in early American history and the clash of cultures between the English and the natives. Malick most often sides with his daring heroine (portrayed beautifully by newcomer Q’orianka Kilcher), but he’s careful to showcase beauty whether in the unspoiled lands of what would be America or in the elaborate courtyards of a developing England.\n\nPsycho (Dir. Alfred Hitchcock, United States, 1960)\n\nStill terrifying to this day, Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho is a perfect exercise in genuine horror – something so few films actually get. Save one legendary murder sequence and a few others smattered throughout, Hitchcock’s classic is short on gore, but heavy on bone-chilling terror. Dread lurks around every corner, and Hitchcock’s unprecedented decision to kill off his leading lady mid-film effectively subverts his audience’s expectations and leads to an uncomfortable fear that anything could happen.\n\nRaise the Red Lantern (Dir. Zhang Yimou, China, 1991)\n\nDestined for not more than the fourth wife of a wealthy landowner, Songlian is a tragic figure in Zhang Yimou’s breathtaking Raise the Red Lantern – a film that is at once a biting social critique on China’s devaluation of women, a study in the power of tradition, and a canvas for some of the most gorgeous visuals committed to film. Songlian and the other wives deceive and betray one another seeking preferential treatment and the affection of their distant husband. It’s a powerful film, but also one of great subtlety.\n\nRead the full evaluation here.\n\nRashômon (Dir. Akira Kurosawa, Japan, 1950)\n\nAkira Kurosawa’s Rashômon was groundbreaking in its unreliable narrative. The concept was by no means new to cinema by 1950, but Kurosawa dedicated an entire film to exploring distorted narration and perception versus reality. Four characters recount the same story with diverging and contradictory anecdotes, and the audience is left to decide for him or herself who (if any) are telling the truth. Never a fan of neatly packaged endings, Rashômon may anger viewers who like their stories spelled out for them, but its strength and intrigue lies in its complex puzzle with a potentially satisfying ray of hope at film’s end.\n\nRear Window (Dir. Alfred Hitchcock, United States, 1954)\n\nBefore Hitchcock took a dive into truly dark territory with Vertigo and Psycho, his light-hearted romance set against a neighborhood whodunit that is Rear Window revealed his unequivocal skills as a filmmaker like none of his other works before. Effectively claustrophobic and meticulously controlled, Hitchcock’s film takes place entirely within an apartment with a view of the courtyard below. That he manages to construct a rather suspenseful murder mystery within these confines (with humor and charm to boot) speaks to this legend’s vast array of talents.\n\nThe Royal Tenenbaums (Dir. Wes Anderson, United States, 2001)\n\nForget that it spawned countless insufferable imitators; trendsetter Wes Anderson’s magnum opus The Royal Tenenbaums remains the essential “indie” film in every sense of what that word has become. Fortunately, Anderson’s film avoids archetypes and clichés to become a genuinely heartfelt story of familial dysfunction that brilliantly tows the line between deadpan humor and considerable depth. Nothing is too serious to be laughed at in Anderson films (divorce, infidelity, death, suicide, addiction), but the way his characters deal with it all sure feels real.\n\nThe Rules of the Game (Dir. Jean Renoir, France, 1939)\n\nCapturing the absurdity of French classicism (and effectively pissing off the French government), director Jean Renoir sheds light on the stark divisions of the lower and upper classes in his comical The Rules of the Game. The film is at once biting satire and also a showcase of brilliant and intriguing characterizations (notably the loveable Octave played by Renoir himself). Renoir’s characters, both seated at the dinner table and scurrying about the servants’ quarters, strive to do whatever they please, but at the end of the day will always bow to the strict societal rules that govern their lives.\n\nSafe (Dir. Todd Haynes, United States, 1995)\n\nTodd Haynes’ Safe is a refreshingly confounding work. It’s a film that can be understood on a whole host of different levels. There is a superficial tale of suburban malaise, but as the story unfolds – around Julianne Moore’s career-best performance – it adopts metaphors for a patriarchal society, environmentalism, the AIDS crisis, classicism, racism, and fringe religious movements. Essentially, it’s a startling microcosm of late-twentieth century angst in one impeccable film.\n\nThe Seventh Seal (Dir. Ingmar Bergman, Sweden, 1957)\n\nContaining some of the most memorable images of the imminence of death (ah, that classic game of chess), Ingmar Bergman’s The Seventh Seal is dripping with the filmmaker’s dreary fatalism, but its cynicism surrounding both the thought of death and the perceived empty promises of religion give it a humorous edge that sustains his audience. Set against the devastation of the plague that ravished Europe in the Middle Ages, The Seventh Seal features a fair amount of thought-provoking existentialism and several memorable characters – most notably, Death himself.\n\nSherlock, Jr. (Dir. Buster Keaton, United States, 1924)\n\nIn his most entertaining and most endearing film, Buster Keaton humorously maximizes the limitations of the silent era and capitalizes on the outlandishness of his comedy by framing a good portion of the story as a dream sequence – to this day unparalleled in its influential approach. Vaudevillian tricks and puzzling editing techniques create the illusions we see on screen, and it still stuns when we see Keaton climb up on stage and walk into the screen at his local movie theatre. The comedic master may be remembered best for The General, but it’s Sherlock, Jr. that boasts the finest distillation of his best qualities.\n\nSingin’ in the Rain (Dir. Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, United States, 1952)\n\nHas there been a more perfect musical in all of cinema’s rich history? Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly’s Singin’ in the Rain may be the most fun you’ll have at the movies this side of Pixar. Remarkably choreographed with an eye-popping Technicolor palette and a number of truly unforgettable songs, Singin’ in the Rain has stood the test of time in ways many Hollywood musicals have not. This is in part due to the Hollywood-centric story it follows. Movies about movies are a dime a dozen, but Singin’ in the Rain’s chronicle of the historic transition from silence to sound has lost none of its pizzazz or its outright humor.\n\nSpirited Away (Dir. Hayao Miyazaki, Japan, 2001)\n\nSomewhat of an alternate take on The Wizard of Oz, Hayao Miyazaki’s delightfully imaginative film Spirited Away is a feast of beautiful visuals as young Chihiro discovers courage on her own unique path to self-discovery. Miyazaki brilliantly allows his narrative to wander introducing us to spectacular and unforgettable characters who are all surprisingly multi-dimensional. The characters in Miyazaki’s world are wholly real in their internal struggle to choose between good and evil. It’s a wondrous journey for all who revel in the magic within.\n\nRead the full evaluation here.\n\nSpring in a Small Town (Dir. Fei Mu, China, 1948)\n\nMainland China’s first cinematic masterpiece still resonates today. Its central conflict between bowing to tradition and pursuing personal happiness clashed with the growing Communist ideal that sought to snuff out any semblance of social individualism. But, today Fei Mu’s Spring in a Small Town is as relevant as ever as its delicate story challenges the conventions of arranged marriages versus marrying for love. But, in refusing to assign simplistic designations of protagonist or antagonist, Fei’s film is remarkably balanced as it seeks to show how one woman’s choice might affect everyone around her.\n\nStalker (Dir. Andrei Tarkovsky, Soviet Union, 1979)\n\nThe films of Andrei Tarkovsky are particularly challenging for this cinephile. They’re slow, sparse, and heavily contemplative. They require a good deal of patience – for which I’ve found I don’t have much with some of his works – but I’ve always been struck by Stalker. Its philosophical implications are frustratingly ambiguous, but there’s something remarkably satisfying about that too. It’s a film that’s never left me since I first saw it years ago.\n\nSunrise: A Song of Two Humans (Dir. F.W. Murnau, United States, 1927)\n\nThe pinnacle of the effect German expressionism had on cinema occurred after Murnau’s move to the U.S. He set out to create a fable-like tale of right and wrong and the power of marital bliss. Sunrise is that film – an enchanting masterwork that is both storybook-like in its beautiful cinematography and impressive set design and incredibly humane in its portrayal of the triumph of love. Both leads give impeccable performances, but it’s Janet Gaynor who truly shines as the endearing and loyal wife to George O’Brien’s conflicted countryman.\n\nTaxi Driver (Dir. Martin Scorsese, United States, 1976)\n\nMartin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver may be the closest thing to a perfect character study there is in cinema. With the help of Robert De Niro’s iconic performance, we crawl inside the skin of this troubled war veteran as he encounters the sleazy underbelly of New York nightlife. Travis Bickle, undoubtedly one of cinema’s greatest characters, is anti-social, emotionally unstable, and incapable of maintaining a normal romantic relationship. But, as the film’s finale suggests, he still may be capable of heroism if not for purely altruistic motives.\n\nThere Will Be Blood (Dir. Paul Thomas Anderson, United States, 2007)\n\nA flaming oil derrick, an eerily pristine bowling alley, a claustrophobic one-room church, the vast and arid Texan plains – P.T. Anderson’s There Will Be Blood is a film of jaw-dropping images. The director has been refining his aesthetic over the years, ingesting the styles of other American greats, but Blood finds him coming into his own with a startling command of mise-en-scène and cinematography. The film is significant for its political, cultural, and religious implications, but it’s also a fascinating character study. Daniel Day-Lewis turns a gargantuan performance as oilman Plainview giving cinema a character for the history books.\n\nThe Third Man (Dir. Carol Reed, United Kingdom, 1949)\n\nThough a little late to the game, Carol Reed’s The Third Man nonetheless remains the finest film noir in cinematic history. Whether it be the zithers or Orson Welles’ turn as the fiendish Harry Lime or its fitting post-war setting or that famous closing shot of complete rejection, Reed’s film stands out amongst its contemporaries. The film’s crowning achievement, however, can be witnessed in the late-film chase sequence underground. A stark glowing light illuminates the jet-black tunnels as Lime scurries about evading the police. It’s quintessential film noir.\n\nThis Is Not a Film (Dir. Jafar Panahi, Iran, 2011)\n\nHow to describe a film like Panahi’s unexpected masterstroke This Is Not a Film? For in one sense, it’s not a film. Is it an essay? A video diary entry? An elaborate hoax? No matter what it is, it’s a heart-wrenching portrait of an artist stripped of his tools to create as its maker remains under house arrest and banned from filmmaking for twenty years. The injustice suffered by Panahi looms over the entire project, but the film’s daringly unique construct enthralls from beginning to end. Dare I say it’s one of contemporary cinema’s most unexpected thrillers?\n\nRead the full evaluation here.\n\nThrough the Olive Trees (Dir. Abbas Kiarostami, Iran, 1994)\n\nPerhaps the greatest instance of meta-narrative in all of cinema, Kiarostami’s Through the Olive Trees adds a few more layers of complexity to the thread that ties Where Is the Friend’s Home? and Life, and Nothing More together. If Life is a faux documentary on the events of Friend’s Home, then Olive Trees is another fictitious behind-the-scenes story, this time of Life, and Nothing More. It’s a wonder that Kiarostami’s densely layered works never fall prey to formalist gimmicks, but it speaks to his unparalleled skills as a contemplative filmmaker that his films always engage the intellect as well as the heart.\n\nRead the full evaluation here.\n\nTouki Bouki (Dir. Djibril Diop Mambéty, Senegal, 1973)\n\nColonialism left the entire continent of Africa marred by the effects of Western infiltration, and though it’s unfair to lump nations as disparate as Senegal, South Africa, and Sudan into one category, Djibril Diop Mambéty’s Touki Bouki is probably the best film on post-colonial Africa in the history of cinema. Mambéty captures a nation grappling with its Western influence and an encroaching modernity in its French New Wave-riffing style, yet provides ample screen time to the rural and traditional ways of Senegalese life. In this juxtaposition, Mambéty has created one of the finest films on the rural/urban divide.\n\nRead the full evaluation here.\n\nTropical Malady (Dir. Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Thailand, 2004)\n\nWith Tropical Malady, director Apichatpong Weerasethakul masters the bifurcated narrative structure that has become a fixture of the filmmaker’s work. He’s gone on to direct great works since, but Tropical Malady remains his best. A tender, unhurried romance in the film’s first half gives way to an allegorical reverie of sorts in the second as the romantic pursuit between the two characters takes on the form of a hunt. The line between hunter and hunted becomes blurred as Weerasethakul forces us to meditate on the nature of love and longing.\n\nRead the full evaluation here.\n\nTrouble in Paradise (Dir. Ernst Lubitsch, United States, 1932)\n\nErnst Lubitsch’s sometimes forgotten classic is remarkably as fresh today as it was back in 1932 when it first shocked audiences with its devilish humor and witty double entendres. It still holds up for its comedy that incites laughter to this day (bolstered by three winsome lead performances), but it’s most notable now for its progressive portrayal of women – individuals in control of their own sexuality, enjoying it and never apologizing for it. For that, the influence of Trouble in Paradise is no laughing matter.\n\nUncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (Dir. Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Thailand, 2010)\n\nAs a career summary up to this point, Weerasethakul’s Uncle Boonmee represents the culmination of the themes, contemplative inquiries, and visuals that have populated his previous work. He meditates on reincarnation as a traditional religious belief and how it fits in with an increasingly secular society. He reveals a fading rural landscape as modernity bleeds into the jungle and the subsequent changes in tradition and spirituality. And yet, as always, there’s playfulness in Weerasethakul’s craft as he highlights the absurd and knowingly teases his own spectacular imagination.\n\nRead the full evaluation here.\n\nThe Wind Will Carry Us (Dir. Abbas Kiarostami, Iran, 1999)\n\nTo cap off a decade of fantastic cinema, Abbas Kiarostami gave us one of his very finest with The Wind Will Carry Us – a riveting meditation on the urban/rural divide. The film’s protagonist leaves his stressful professional life as a journalist in Tehran to capture a traditional funeral ritual in a far-off village. There his patience is tested as he quickly discovers he must bend his own will to the ways of the villagers, and not the other way around. As usual Kiaromstami plays with cinematic form to trace this narrative; and as always, the story turns to one of celebrating and affirming the art of living.\n\nRead the full evaluation here.\n\nContinue to Part III (#20-11)\n\nFor this site’s inaugural feature, I’ve decided to compile a list of my favorite films. I suppose every cinephile has their own personal canon of sorts, and while most settle on that magic number of list-making one hundred, I hoped to limit that number to highlight the very special films included. Thus, I’ve settled on seventy-five (to be more accurate, seventy-seven as I am counting a certain trilogy as one entry for the purposes of this list). And, though I found it fairly easy to round up a solid twenty as the best of the best, I couldn’t bring myself to rank the entire seventy-five. Tastes come and go, but I am convinced that each of these will always hold a special place in my heart as films that moved me, shaped my perception of cinematic art, and have had a lasting impact.\n\nAt first, I tried to limit most directors to one film. But, as I began compiling favorites, I found that like other art forms, I am most attracted to works by the same artists. As you will see, directors Abbas Kiarostami and Terrence Malick have the most films here with six and five, respectively. Though they are two extremely different artists, in their own way both tell stories and craft cinema that celebrates the art of living. Aside from those two titans of cinema, I also included more than one film from my other beloved and revered filmmakers Carl Theodor Dreyer, Alfred Hitchcock, Hou Hsiao-hsien, Akira Kurosawa, Hayao Miyazaki, Yasujiro Ozu, Satyajit Ray, Eric Rohmer, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, and Wong Kar-wai. And, though Martin Scorsese doesn’t fall into that category, he has two films to his credit because I simply couldn’t decide between his twin masterpieces.\n\nYou might also notice that there are a disproportionate number of titles from the 1990s onward. The reason is twofold, but both relate to my age and the era in which my cinephilia began. For one, the sheer number of films I’ve seen from the last two and a half decades grossly exceeds those from earlier in the twentieth century. As a lover of film, I’m actively working on rectifying that. But, secondly, I believe now perhaps more than ever, it’"
