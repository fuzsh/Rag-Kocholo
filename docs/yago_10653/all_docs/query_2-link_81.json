        "text": "This essay is based on a talk presented at Stanford University on February 21, 2012 by Majid Naficy.\n\nLos Angeles is sometimes called Irangeles, because more than half a million Iranians live there. Most of them have come to this city during or after the 1979 Revolution. They were either beneficiaries of the fallen monarchy or supporters of the revolution who became disillusioned and suppressed by the rising theocracy. Soon after arrival, Iranians established Persian radio, television and newspapers as well as bookstores and music shops in Los Angeles.\n\nIranians are very proud of their classical poetry and consider the national epic of The Shahnameh, composed by Ferdowsi a thousand years ago as the symbol of their nationality. Therefore, it is not surprising that covering Persian poetry in Iranian media, selling classical collections of poetry in bookstores and teaching Rumi and Hafez in private classes spread rapidly among Iranians in Los Angeles.\n\nToday, the Iranian community in LA has many poets. Some of us, such as Nader Naderpour, Partow Nuriala, and myself had published collections of poetry at the time of the Shah in Iran. Others, like Abbas Saffari and Liela Farjami publish books of poetry both in Los Angeles and Tehran. Katayoon Zandvakili and Sholeh Wolpe write poetry only in English. Azadeh Farahmand writes poetry in both languages. I myself compose poems first in Persian and then translate them into English.\n\nFourteen years ago, on March 20, 1998, I hosted a poetry reading in celebration of Persian New Year in Beyond Baroque Literary/Arts Center in Venice Beach in which five poets, Nader Naderpour, Partow Nuriala, Mansour Khaksar, Abbas Saffari and myself read poetry in Persian and English. My late friend Harriet Tannenbaum read the English versions of Naderpour for him. Today, two of these poets are no longer living. Naderpour passed away in 2000 and Mansour Khaksar committed suicide in 2010.\n\nIn order to show you a sample of Persian poetry in Los Angeles, I would like to revisit these five poets and share a poem by each with you. By selecting these poems, I do not want to ignore other poets whom I have already mentioned or other poets such as Hamid-Reza Rahimi, Yashar Ahad-Sarmi, Khalil Kalbasi, Fazlloh Rowhani, Mortaza Miraftabi, Fariba Sedighim, Farzad Hemati, Sheida Mohamadi, Ali-Reza Tabibzadeh Behzad Razaqi, Manuchehr Kohan Freeda Saba, and Mandana Zandian who have published collections of poetry in Los Angeles. Hopefully one day I will be able to publish an anthology of Persian poetry in Los Angeles and include the works of all my fellow poets.\n\nIn this brief study, I focus on one question: are these poets still dreaming of going back to their homeland or have they come to some degree of acceptance of their adopted country?\n\nNeither of these two tendencies has artistic merit over the other one. Nostalgia and adaptation are two common moods among human beings and both can become the subject matter of poetry. Perhaps, nostalgia is not a good recipe for an exile who cannot go back to his or her homeland. But it is definitely as interesting as cultural adaptation for a poet to write about. In Western poetry, we have, on the one hand, Homer’s The Odyssey in which a victorious but cursed-upon hero of the Trojan war longs for his homeland and, on the other hand, Virgil’s The Aeneid, in which the losers of the same war sail to a new land, Italy, and make it their new home. We need both of these epics, because nostalgia and adaptation are both parts of human migration and exile. Among our five poets, Naderpour is the one who never comes at peace with Los Angeles. Next to him is Mansour Khaksar who in spite of calling one of his collections of poetry Los Angelesinos remains apart from this city. (1)\n\nNader Naderpour was born in 1929 in Tehran and published his first poems in the newspapers run by the Soviet-oriented Tudeh Party in the 1940s. In the introduction to his first collection of poems Eyes and Hands (chashmha va dastha) published in 1954, he rejected the modernist poetry of Nima Yushij (1896-1960) in which classical meter and rhyme are “broken”. Instead, he adhered to the neoclassicist poetry of Mohammad-Taqi Bahar (1885-1951) in which only diction and imagery are updated and the traditional prosody is kept intact. (2) In the 1960s and 70s Naderpour worked as editor of two prestigious art magazines published by the Ministry of Art and Culture, as well as the chief of Contemporary Literature Division in Iranian National Radio and Television. At the same time, he was one of the signatories of Iranian Writers Association in 1968 who opposed state censorship. In 1980 in opposition to Khomeini’s regime he traveled to Paris where his daughter lived. Finally, in 1987 he moved to Los Angeles.\n\nWhile in exile, Naderpour published three collections of poetry of which False Dawn (sobh-e dorughin) has been translated into English by Michael Hillman in 1986. In Los Angeles, Naderpour worked with Persian radio and television broadcasting from Los Angeles as well as Persian exile magazines published in other cities. He taught classical Persian poetry to Iranians mostly outside of academia. In his introduction to his last collection of poems Earth and Time (zamin va zaman) published in 1996 in Los Angeles, Naderpour accepts that Nima Yushij’s innovation in Persian poetry was a “social necessity” and Naderpour himself began to compose poetry in the style of modernists. Most of the poems in this collection are dark and reflect the poet’s fear of old age and death as well as longing for his homeland. In fact, the title of the collection Earth and Time expresses the anxiety of the poet for losing his youth and land. Naderpour’s nostalgia is sometimes accompanied with hatred toward his adopted city, as seen in “The American Night” written in December 1994. Here, he compares the “city of angels” (Los Angeles) to a “hell” and its inhabitants to “satans” and “quasi-human”:\n\nThe American Night\n\nThe place of my exile\n\nIs a city on the shore of a Western sea\n\nWith old palm trees and new palaces\n\nTaller than imaginary giants.\n\nThis city for greedy earthlings\n\nIs home to the angels\n\nBut it is a hell with the beauty of the paradise\n\nThat from the beginning of illusionary cosmos creation\n\nHas allowed satan to its solitude.\n\nThese human-like creatures who occupy this city,\n\nOblivious to destiny of their ancestors\n\nAre longing for another forbidden fruit.\n\nToday, at nightfall\n\nThe old sun in the burning fever of madness\n\nFrom the peak of the greatest skyscraper\n\nThrew itself on a sea cliff and died.\n\nAnd yet, the tall city windows\n\nDo not believe its black death\n\nAs if, they are\n\nWaiting for a miracle from the East.\n\nAfter its death\n\nThere is no star in this exile night\n\nBecause all stars are lost\n\nin the warm smoke of clouds\n\nAnd the spark of their delicate gazes\n\nAre only hidden in the small raindrops,\n\nAs pure as the pigeons’ eyes.\n\nIn a night more naked than a black marble\n\nI walk on a carpet of autumn leaves\n\nWith my gaze at the passing birds.\n\nThe tears pouring from the sky\n\nAnd dripping into my gazing eyes\n\nResemble pieces of glass that through them\n\nstones, plants, animals and men all look drenched.\n\nI inhale the scent of the earth through fall breeze\n\nAnd drink it as bitter wine,\n\nIn memory of my ruined mother land\n\nAnd I begin to cry.\n\nThis time, through my eyes\n\nFrom behind their tears, not from clouds’ tears\n\nI see vividly that on both sides of the road\n\nThe colorful images of a hundred city lights\n\nAre floating on the rain water puddles.\n\nI open a path toward my home\n\nIn the empty streets of this city full of trees.\n\nAmidst the humming wet branches\n\nAnd become weary\n\nFrom the footsteps of a stranger\n\nWho in the middle of night is accompanying me\n\nWithout being my companion\n\nAlthough our steps are the same.\n\nSuddenly, over the faraway trees\n\nThe thick smoke of clouds\n\nBegin to scatter by the attack of winds.\n\nNight also, ironically\n\nexposes in front of me\n\nThe unmasked moon’s coquettish face\n\nAnd a masked attacking thief.\n\nStaring at the handgun of this robber\n\nI realize that in the city of angels\n\nSatan and God are brothers. (3)\n\nMansour Khaksar was born in 1939 in Abadan. In the early 1960s he co-edited a southern literary magazine with the well-known writer Nasser Taghvai. Khaksar was arrested in 1967 and imprisoned for two years because of his Marxist Tendency. Two years later, he wrote a long poem The Story of Blood (karnameh-ye khun) and published it anonymously. It represented the feelings of young Marxist revolutionaries called People’s Fadaee Guerrillas who took arms against the Shah’s regime in the early 1970s. In 1975 he traveled to London and worked as a bank accountant while pursuing his clandestine activities for Fadaee’s organization. When revolutionary poet Sa’id Soltanpour (1940-81) was released from prison and went abroad, he and Khaksar with three other activists who had suffered the Shah’s political prison, established a committee called From Prison to Exile (az zendan ta tab’eed). This committee organized many gatherings in support of the rising revolution in Iran. Before the collapse of the monarchy, Khaksar returned to Iran and became one of the founders of Fadaee’s organization in southern Iran. When Khomeini’s regime began to suppress the opposition, he fled to Soviet Azerbaijan in 1984 and two years later went to Germany. Upon separation from his wife, Khaksar moved to Los Angeles in 1990 where he worked as an accountant until his suicide in March 2010. He is survived by two daughters. Khaksar co-edited daftar-ha-ye shanbeh and daftar-ha-ye kanun the journals of a literary circle in Los Angeles and the Iranian Writers’ Association in Exile respectively, as well as the poetry section of Arash magazine published in Paris. He published a dozen collections of poetry in Los Angeles, including qasideh-ye safari dar meh (The Ode of A Journey in Fog) in 1992 and losanjelesi-ha (Los Angelesinos) in 1997. (4) In the first book, a long narrative about his coming to exile, Khaksar breaks with his group mentality in the past and searches for his own individuality. In the second book, which consists of 23 connected short poems, he often expresses loneliness and isolation in exile and longing for his homeland. In one of these poems (p. 32), which he has written in Santa Monica beach, he reminisces of his youth in Abadan at the Persian Gulf while looking at the Pacific Ocean:\n\nI am staring at the ebbing sea\n\nAnd the winter sun\n\nHas made me naked.\n\nI am fully revealed\n\nLike a worn-out book.\n\nI am a ruined past\n\nFrom a distant tribe\n\nWhose palm trees make me naked\n\nIn the arms of water and fish\n\nAnd seamen’s hums\n\nAnd an aging memory\n\nWith no rain on high hills.\n\nThe night is approaching\n\nAnd I am standing against it\n\nWith bitter resources\n\nThat kindle no lamp.\n\nWhere is my youth At twenty?\n\nWhen I stepped upon the horizon\n\nAnd set fire to the house\n\nWith no fear of tomorrow.\n\nA crescent moon has opened arms in solitude,\n\nBut does not camp within me.\n\nFor hours\n\nI’ve been floating on the shallow water\n\nAnd the nightly world has been chasing me.\n\nTo count the delays of returning home\n\nI plant the paddle of wind in the water\n\nAnd grow in its sail.\n\nMy vision is blurred\n\nI have made the sky cloudy\n\nAnd sail aimlessly. (5)\n\nPartow Nuriala was born in 1946 in Tehran. Her first collection of poetry sahm-e salha (A Share of the Years) was banned in 1972. She played in the movie aramesh dar hozur-e digaran (Calmness In the Presence of Others) directed by Nasser Taghvai which was also banned. Nuriala earned her BA in Philosophy from Tehran University and later taught a course in the same field. Her husband was the well-known poet Mohammad-Ali Sepanlou. She moved to Los Angeles in 1986 with her two children and worked as a Deputy Jury Commissioner at the Los Angeles County Superior Court until retirement. In addition to a book of literary criticism, Partow Nuriala has published five collections of poetry of which the first two volumes are mostly related to social issues before and during the revolution. Her latest collection az dar ta bahar (From Gallows to the Spring) contains poems written after the 2009 June uprising in reaction to presidential election rig. She considers herself a feminist and two of her longer poems “I Am Human” and “Four Seasons” relate the story of a woman in a patriarchal society. In her poems written in exile, one can hardly find either nostalgia for her life in Tehran or references to her adopted city Los Angeles. An exception is her poem “Many Happy Returns” written in 2004 in which past and present are combined:\n\nMany Happy Returns\n\nFive mornings a week\n\nFifty weeks of mornings\n\nMy sun rises\n\nIn the rear-view mirrors of buses\n\nAnd each day in the old courthouse\n\nAwaits me a small desk\n\nAn English-Farsi dictionary\n\nA heap of summonses– a spiraling justice\n\nAnd the relentless ringing of telephones.\n\nOn my cubicle wall\n\na tacked postcard\n\n— White -flower stem on black background —\n\n(Uproar of love between the lines on back )\n\nA memory we lived\n\nAs Schubert\n\nPasses through\n\nMy transistor radio.\n\nOn the opposite wall is an image\n\nOf Maya Angelou, Ahmad Shamlou\n\nFreeway maps\n\nAnd a rendition of a love poem by Paz.\n\nAll day, wandering files\n\nAre run through the copier\n\nAs are the throbbing of my tongue\n\nIn the veins of a most foreign language .\n\nEach dusk, returning home\n\nI halt passersby in search of\n\nMy lost days–\n\n— In Los Angeles —\n\nAnd ask the police\n\nAfter that young woman\n\nWhose hands were chained\n\nIn this house of fortune.\n\n“Many Happy Returns!”\n\nThe voice of he Who is in love\n\nRipples through my house\n\nVia the answering machine.\n\nA feverish teardrop waters\n\nA burnt jasmine leaf.\n\nAnd then,\n\ntraipsing in books\n\nAnd stitching clothes;\n\nReading, writing, cooking\n\nWashing, scrubbing\n\nSurfing the web\n\nTyping, sewing\n\nWeaving memories;\n\nThread to thread, one by one\n\nMoss stitching:\n\nOne stitch over, one under\n\none row crimson\n\nOne the color of sorrow.\n\nAnd when night falls\n\nSo the heaviness of habit\n\nScours not my spirit,\n\nHidden from the moon\n\nI unstitch the old threads\n\nAnd send my keen eye\n\nClad in a gilded gown\n\nOff to tomorrow. (6)\n\nAbbas Saffari was born in 1951 in Yazd. In his youth he wrote lyrics for the late avant-garde pop singer Farhad. He moved to the US in 1979 and lives with his American wife and their two children in Los Angeles. He ran a small waterproofing business until retirement. Saffari has been the poetry editor of two Persian literary magazines Sang and Kaktus while in exile. He has published several collections of poetry both in Iran and abroad including tarik-roshan-ye hozur (Twilight of Presence), Kebrit-e sukhteh (Burnt Matches) and durbin-e qadimi va she’r-ha-ye digar (Old Camera and Other Poems). Contrary to the other poets in this survey, he rarely writes political poems. In his poetry one finds many references to life in Los Angeles. In his last two collections of poetry, he has developed an appreciation for playing on words as well as a sense of humor, as seen in the following poem, published in 2005 in Burnt Matches:\n\nSaturday Night Dinner\n\nThe onion, I will grate\n\nTo keep my stream of tears from drying.\n\nThe potato, you peel\n\nFor your sleight of hand with skin.\n\nLet Nusrat Fatah Ali Khan, the Sufi minstrel play\n\nFor he opens us a window to Konya,\n\nA window adorned with narcissus, sleepy-eyed and languorous,\n\nAnd a handful of homing pigeons.\n\nIf they call\n\nFrom MasterCard\n\nOr the Internal I-don’t-have-any-Revenue Service\n\nTell them he’s gone to Kashmir\n\nLooking for the long-lost polo ball of King Aurangzeeb of India,\n\nAnd it’s unclear when he’ll be back.\n\nDon’t laugh , my darling!\n\nCultural misunderstandings\n\nDismiss the disturber\n\nQuicker than hollow conversation.\n\nNow, while this aged Indian rice ripens,\n\nPut two glasses, lip to lip, near our hands\n\nOf our oldest vintage, four years old\n\nAnd a reminder of a century past.\n\nA sip of good wine\n\nIs enough to erase an entire century from one’s memory.\n\nSip after sip\n\nWe can backtrack so far\n\nThat after dinner\n\nWe can find ourselves in the moonlight\n\nPalm groves of Mesopotamia,\n\nAnd around midnight\n\nIn a primordial place naked\n\nAnd boundless. (7)\n\nI, Majid Naficy, was born in 1952 in Isfahan. My first poems were published in Jong-e Isfahan when I was 13, and my first collection of poems dar pust-e babr (In the Tiger’s Skin) at 17. In 1983 I fled Iran, a year and a half after the execution of my wife Ezzat Tabaian in Evin Prison. I moved to Los Angeles in 1984 where I live with my son Azad. I have published two collections of poetry Muddy Shoes (Beyond Baroque Books 1999) and Father and Son (Red Hen Press 2003) as well as my doctoral dissertation Modernism and Ideology in Persian Literature: A Return to Nature in the Poetry of Nima Yushij (University Press of America 1997).\n\nIn June 1995, in a conference entitled “Writing in Exile” sponsored by The Institute for European-American Relations at University of Southern California in Los Angeles I had a talk called “A Reader Within Me” which I summarize here. (8) “When I fled Iran I brought my reader along with me. For half a decade, when I picked up my pen as a poet I was driven to write for that reader. Although he traveled abroad with me he still lived in Tehran, spoke only in Persian, preferred Iranian food and thought within the framework of Iranian culture. A good example of this can be found in my second collection of poems in Persian pas az khamushi). After the Silence published in 1986. Except for fewer than ten poems, all of the poems in this collection were written about the Iranian situation in the past and present. The poet is still haunted by the phantom of the lost revolution which was crushed by a new regime of theocracy. My body lived in L. A. but my soul was still rummaging through the ruins of a lost revolution in Iran. In my next collection of poems in Persian Anduh-e marz (Sorrow of the Border) published in 1989, the proportion of poems reflecting the new situation has increased drastically. In a very long poem, dedicated to my newborn son Azad, not only do I depict my bilingual world by including quotations in English within the body of the Persian text, but I also see my son as my own new root growing in my adopted country. In the next collection she’r-ha-ye venisi (Poems of Venice) published in 1991, the reader finds different aspects of life at Venice Beach where I lived for seven years. A turning point in this long journey from the realm of self-denial to acceptance and adaptation, is when I wrote a long poem on January 12, 1994 called “Ah, Los Angeles”. In 2000, the city of Venice engraved one fragment of this poem in a public space at a wall at Boardwalk and Brooks street. (9) In this poem, there is a reference to Parsees in Sanjan, India, by which I want to compare Iranians who emigrated to Los Angeles with Parsees, the descendants of Zoroastrians who during the Arab conquest of Iran emigrated to Gujarat, India. In 1599, Bahman Key Qobad, a Gujarati Parsee wrote an epic in Persian in which he narrated the voyage of Parsees’ ancestors from the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf to the port of Sanjan in Gujarat. Here is the revised version of the poem first published in Muddy Shoes in English:\n\nAh, Los Angeles\n\nAh, Los Angeles!\n\nI accept you as my city,\n\nAnd after ten years\n\nI am at peace with you.\n\nWaiting without fear\n\nI lean back against the bus post.\n\nAnd I become lost\n\nIn the sounds of your midnight.\n\nA man gets off Blue Bus 1\n\nAnd crosses to this side\n\nTo take Brown Bus 4.\n\nPerhaps he too is coming back\n\nFrom his nights on campus.\n\nOn the way he has sobbed\n\nInto a blank letter.\n\nAnd from the seat behind\n\nHe has heard the voice of a woman\n\nWith a familiar accent.\n\nOn Brown Bus 4 it rains.\n\nA woman is talking to her umbrella\n\nAnd a man ceaselessly flushes a toilet.\n\nI told Carlos yesterday,\n\n“Your clanging cart\n\nWakes me up in the morning.”\n\nHe collects cans\n\nAnd wants to go back to Cuba.\n\nFrom the Promenade\n\nComes the sound of my homeless man.\n\nHe sings the blues\n\nAnd plays guitar.\n\nWhere in the world can I hear\n\nThe black moaning of the saxophone\n\nAlongside the Chinese chimes?\n\nAnd see this warm olive skin\n\nThrough blue eyes?\n\nThe easy-moving doves\n\nRest on the empty benches.\n\nThey stare at the dinosaur\n\nWho sprays stale water on our kids.\n\nMarziyeh sings from a Persian market\n\nI return,homesick\n\nAnd I put my feet\n\nOn your back.\n\nAh, Los Angeles!\n\nI feel your blood.\n\nYou taught me to get up\n\nLook at my beautiful legs\n\nAnd along with the marathon\n\nRun on your broad shoulders.\n\nOnce I got tired of life\n\nI coiled up under my blanket\n\nAnd remained shut-off for two nights.\n\nThen, my neighbor turned on NPR\n\nAnd I heard of a Russian poet\n\nWho in a death camp,\n\nCould not write his poems\n\nBut his wife learned them by heart.\n\nWill Âzad read my poetry?\n\nOn the days that I take him to school,\n\nHe sees the bus number from far off.\n\nAnd calls me to get in line.\n\nAt night he stays under the shower\n\nAnd lets the drops of water\n\nSpray on his small body.\n\nSometimes we go to the beach.\n\nHe bikes and I skate.\n\nHe buys a Pepsi from a machine\n\nAnd gives me one sip.\n\nYesterday we went to Romteen’s house.\n\nHis father is a Parsee from India.\n\nHe wore sadra and kusti\n\nWhile he was painting the house.\n\nOn that little stool\n\nHe looked like a Zoroastrian\n\nRowing from Hormuz to Sanjan.\n\nAh, Los Angeles!\n\nLet me bend down and put my ear\n\nTo your warm skin.\n\nPerhaps in you\n\nI will find my own Sanjan.\n\nNo, it’s not a ship touching\n\nAgainst the rocky shore;\n\nIt’s the rumbling Blue Bus 8.\n\nI know.\n\nI will get off at Idaho\n\nAnd will pass the shopping carts\n\nLeft by the homeless\n\nI will climb the stairs\n\nAnd will open the door.\n\nI will start the answering machine\n\nAnd in the dark\n\nI will wait like a fisherman.
