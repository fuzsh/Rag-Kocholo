Colleges and universities, as well as high schools, are developing programs and courses in homeland security, intelligence analysis, and law enforcement, in support of national security. The Security and Professional Intelligence Education Series (SPIES) was first designed for individuals studying for careers in intelligence and to help improve the skills of those already in the profession; however, it was also developed to educate the public on how intelligence work is conducted and should be conducted in this important and vital profession. 1.

The African continent has encountered a variety of internal and external security challenges before, during, and after colonialism. Intelligence services have served as a formal and informal arm of colonial states and have been utilized as a tool by autocratic or authoritarian leaders to suppress democratic, ethnic, or separatist demands. This has been a common feature of intelligence across the continent. Regardless of the political system, intelligence continues to play an often unseen but significant role in the lives of Africa’s 1.3 billion people.1 Yet African intelligence services have not been examined as a serious field of inquiry, and the number of academic studies published on the topic is small. There are notable scholarly articles and books on African intelligence, but when compared to research about North American or European intelligence services, scholars have not given it the attention the subject deserves. This book provides a comprehensive exploration of intelligence cultures in Africa, covering all African nations. The trade-off for not including longer chapters is that more countries—including those never examined in English before—can be analyzed. The book’s purpose is to provide a single volume that can serve as an introduction to African intelligence services for students and a reference text for scholars. In some cases, the authors are researchers who have specialized in intelligence for a given country. In other cases, they are experts on the country, and their chapters are the first English-language studies on a country’s intelligence apparatus. While other books have approached the subject by seeking authors who reside in a particular country, this is not possible for a comprehensive book on Africa, in which the countries could have a few hundred thousand people or have a population in the xvii\n\nxviii\n\nIntroduction\n\nmillions, but the government censors authors writing on security issues. Indeed, issues of personal safety and security can also limit scholarship. Therefore, contributors were selected for their expertise on the intelligence services of a given country or their ability to apply an intelligence studies approach to the security dynamics of the African nations and regions they study. There are many different approaches to understanding intelligence services. The book recognizes this, encouraging contributors to research and structure the chapters by drawing from their academic strengths and knowledge of the countries. While the general theme of examining influences on and by intelligence services was provided, the authors focused on subjects, time periods, and services deemed most illustrative of the particular country. The book sees the diversity of approaches as a strength, rather than imposing a model that might limit inquiry into a subject that is already challenging to research in many African countries. As a result, it not only offers readers overviews of each country’s intelligence services but highlights different perspectives and methodological approaches in studying African intelligence. It is hoped that this book prompts scholars to build from and expand on these methodologies and research. SCHOLARSHIP The current literature on African intelligence cultures, whether journal articles, scholarly volumes, or first-person accounts, is a comparatively limited one. Further, access to research data on intelligence agencies and practices also tends to be constrained. So when I was approached by Rowman & Littlefield to compile a book about African intelligence cultures, it was not clear if it was even possible to assemble authors who could find enough material on the subject in some countries. This challenge proved attractive, however, because such a collection of chapters might prompt new research about African intelligence services. The objective of this book is not to publish “secrets” or promote fantastical James Bond–type stories. Rather, the objective is to advance the scholarly study and understanding of African intelligence services and cultures, helping bring greater academic attention to the topic. Before exploring the objectives of this book in greater detail, it is important to first look at the current state of African intelligence studies and literature, identifying key contributions as well as gaps. The number of academic articles in the major intelligence studies journals about Africa is small. A 2016 study by Damien Van Puyvelde and Sean Curtis reviewed the two leading intelligence studies journals, Intelligence and National Security and the International Journal of Intelligence and\n\nIntroduction\n\nxix\n\nCounterintelligence, and found only thirty-one of almost two thousand total articles examined Africa intelligence services.2 Perhaps most revealing was that only one article was written by an author from Africa (the person was from South Africa).3 The study demonstrates the extremely skewed attention to intelligence about North America and Europe, in terms of both focus and authorship. Recent and key texts that have taken national, global, or comparative perspectives have also largely overlooked intelligence practice and culture in Africa. Gregory F. Treverton and Wilhelm Agrell’s anthology National Intelligence Systems: Current Research and Future Prospects offers theories on the future of intelligence, providing North American and European perspectives without specific analysis of African countries.4 Likewise, Zachary K. Goldman and Samuel J. Rascoff’s anthology Global Intelligence Oversight approaches intelligence through a legal analysis of “global” but is chiefly about Anglophone relations as well as Israel and Germany, with no discussion of Africa.5 Philip H. J. Davies and Kristian C. Gustafson’s anthology Intelligence Elsewhere: Spies and Espionage Outside the Anglosphere provides contributions about less studied intelligence services—such as Indonesia, Japan, and Iran—but only covers one African country.6 To be sure, there are a handful of books that provide readers with a collection of essays about African intelligence services. African Intelligence Services: Early Postcolonial and Contemporary Challenges, an anthology I edited, examines postcolonial challenges in eleven African intelligence services.7 The eleven chapters delve into specific issues that African intelligence services have faced, such as ethnic and racial conflict, independence, and internal insurgencies. An earlier anthology was edited by Sandy Africa and Johnny Kwadjo, covering Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, Uganda, and the African Great Lakes region.8 Five of the six authors are former government officials, making the book mostly a first-person discussion about intelligence services mixed with secondary sources. Additionally, Olawale Ismail and Elisabeth Skons’s The Security Activities of External Actors in Africa explores Africa’s security through the prism of external actors—such as China, France, Russia, and the United States—but does not delve into African countries’ agency in shaping their own security and intelligence institutions.9 And while there is ample literature about and by foreign intelligence officers who have served in Africa, there are few memoirs and studies about Africans’ involvement in intelligence. Most scholarship has been about South Africa’s apartheid intelligence services, as well as some nonfiction works on postapartheid transformations. In total, there are a few hundred monographs about intelligence in Africa. Again, this is a very small number compared to other regions and upon closer\n\nxx\n\nIntroduction\n\ninspection is skewed toward South Africa. A subject search on WorldCat.org reveals more than 15,300 holdings on the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), while African intelligence has only over 300 results.10 When those results are narrowed by country, it reveals that more than 200 are specifically about South Africa.11 OBJECTIVE This book explores African intelligence cultures by examining how a state’s internal—and to a varying degree external—dynamics influence intelligence services and in turn how intelligence services themselves shape the state, society, and culture. This book uses similar themes to those in The Handbook of European Intelligence Cultures. There, authors wrote about the domestic and foreign contexts of intelligence services, the intelligence organizations themselves, and the effects of intelligence on the security environment.12 Yet this book seeks to expand how the reader understands intelligence culture by introducing intelligence studies to cultural studies.13 In particular, it draws from the Birmingham School of Cultural Studies initiated by Richard Hoggart and later Stuart Hall.14 Notably, this book employs the notion that culture is “experience lived, experience interpreted, experience defined” and above all a process.15 Indeed, culture is a “way of life,” and analysis of culture can “discover shared ideas and forms of communication.”16 This book also borrows from subsequent studies on culture and politics in new imperial history. Likewise, Catherine Hall has noted the contested definitions of culture, describing the cultural turn wherein scholars decoded meanings through cultural practices and processes.17 Applying these concepts to intelligence studies, this book highlights the variants and diversity of intelligence cultures in Africa through a range of politics, societies, histories, and international relations. It does not seek to impose a specific theoretical framework on the chapters, but rather welcomes different conceptions of culture, methodologies, and sources to probe the experiences and people involved in intelligence work in Africa. The book aims to provide an overview of intelligence cultures through diverse and interdisciplinary approaches. Some contributors are historians, political scientists, or sociologists, or have government backgrounds. The authors were encouraged to draw from their expertise and use diverse approaches to shed light on underexamined aspects of intelligence culture. Indeed, there is no need to revisit well-trodden aspects of intelligence history. Rather, this book hopes to spark interest and debate about the different types of methodologies, sources, and events that create the tapestry of intelligence throughout Africa. With some chapters leaning more historical and others\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxi\n\ndelving into current events, they do not necessarily follow the same approach or even define intelligence in the exact same ways. Indeed, some chapters emphasize security and law enforcement agencies, reflecting the status of countries’ focus, institutions, and sources available. These differences demonstrate a diverse population of more than one billion people in dozens of countries that have experienced bursts of foreign intervention from different parts of the world for hundreds of years. Each chapter provides readers with a country-specific overview of intelligence history and systems, national security challenges, international alliances, and intelligence oversight or reform efforts. Human rights are another important aspect in the chapters, with the degree of abuses or reforms depending on the country. Indeed, news media, governments, and nongovernmental organizations—such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International— have documented human rights violations by particular African countries and linked them directly or indirectly to intelligence and security services. In sum, this approach is to introduce scholars and students to historical and contemporary issues, highlighting African agency in intelligence, rather than dwell on or overemphasize external actors’ roles and perspective. But there is no doubt that international relations have been vital to African intelligence since the late nineteenth-century scramble for Africa attracted competition between the great powers for influence on the continent. As the Cold War played a significant role in postwar European intelligence, the Cold War has also shaped African intelligence until this day. But Africa faced different or compounded issues in the Cold War, as many countries simultaneously experienced decolonization and state building during the postwar era. This book covers over fifty-five countries, and while each chapter is centered on similar themes, it does not take a comparative analytic approach in the sense of categorizing the countries or presenting an overarching theory about African intelligence services. Given the variety and differences of services, histories, cultures, and governments, it is doubtful a meaningful theory can be constructed.18 In compiling a book about Africa’s intelligence services, it hopes to encourage further research on intelligence in Africa beyond colonial histories or apartheid, which currently dominate the field. More broadly, this book helps address the still remarkable geographical imbalances that exist in intelligence studies. SOURCES This book contributes to intelligence studies by shedding new light not just on African intelligence, but also on the sources available for researching the\n\nxxii\n\nIntroduction\n\nsubject. While each chapter varies in research methodologies due to the differences in nations’ sizes, histories, security environments, and governments, the authors likewise vary in their use of sources depending on the country. From memoirs by former foreign intelligence and former African intelligence officers to laws that lay out African intelligence structures and even interviews, the chapters highlight ways scholars can approach understudied intelligence cultures with limited sources. Research is shaped by the types of sources available, and this is never truer than in the field of intelligence studies. Declassified records in North American and European archives have been important staples of intelligence studies research since the 1980s.19 However, aside from colonial or early colonial records, many African countries—South Africa with its apartheid-era records being a notable exception—do not make intelligence records available to the public. Further, autobiographies and memoirs can be useful, but they have to be analyzed with caution.20 When one relies on memoirs by former intelligence officers from North America and Europe, the result not only injects possibly outsized foreign perspectives about Africa but could produce narratives that exaggerate foreign countries’ alleged roles and involvement in Africa.21 This is especially true in intelligence, where narratives go unchallenged or facts are unclear because information may still be classified or compartmented, with no single person or record providing a full understanding of events. If one draws heavily from a single source or foreign sources, it skews the research against African agency of acting independently from the world powers. For example, Larry Devlin (1922–2008), the CIA’s first station chief in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, described his intelligence activities and the country’s repeated security crises.22 If one focuses on his account as a main intelligence player in the country, the result for the reader is emphasis on one narrative from a foreign intelligence officer without understanding how or if Devlin and his activities fit into the Congolese intelligence community. In contrast, Niël Barnard, former head of apartheid South Africa’s National Intelligence Service, explained his country was the “target of the espionage services” of many countries and that South Africa “successfully terminated” many of the efforts.23 Whether the boast of these counterintelligence successes is true or not, Barnard’s account demonstrates African agency and that African intelligence institutions have their own targets, operations, and concerns even against allies.\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxiii\n\nCONCLUSION African governments, cultures, and societies shape the intelligence services of Africa, but intelligence services also influence African governments, cultures, and societies. This book describes the specific experiences, environments, and influences in well-known and lesser-known African intelligence services. Readers can identify similarities and differences between the intelligence apparatuses in Africa. Furthermore, it is hoped that scholars build from the research in this book to develop a more diverse understanding of African intelligence, and intelligence in general. As Bob de Graaff and James M. Nyce explain in The Handbook of European Intelligence Cultures, similar to how the English Industrial Revolution came to be seen as a “normative model” for modernity and development, there is a tendency to see “the American, British, and Russian intelligence agencies” as a “standard” and other countries’ services as “outliers.”24 This book provides an alternative perspective by approaching fifty-five African countries’ intelligence services on their own terms rather than focusing on external forces: colonial, Cold War, or great power actors. There are some broad commonalities among African intelligence services. First, it is clear from the research in this book that government and politics are significant influences on many African intelligence services.25 Whether a country is a monarchy, authoritarian, or a multiparty democracy, government and politics have a significant impact on African intelligence cultures in terms of collection, analysis, operations, and targets. Second, the history of a country also has a significant role, as the colonial character and legal system shaped the intelligence community’s structure and function, including oversight and transparency. Additionally, Cold War alliances also influenced aid—not just intelligence and security material and training, but also economic, health, and agricultural aid, which shaped the countries’ directions.26 Ethnic relations—whether in Rwanda, South Africa, or Zimbabwe—also significantly influence the direction of resources and time focused on the issue. Third, civil-military intelligence relations and bureaucratic demarcation appear to be connected to the size of a country. Less-populated countries consist of smaller intelligence services, which means the intelligence community is smaller and likely has less-defined walls between civilian intelligence, military intelligence, and law enforcement. Fourth, many African countries’ intelligence services have long been in some state of reform and reorganization, which has been a fairly consistent feature of African intelligence since the end of the Cold War. Yet Peter Gill and Michael Andregg have explained that formal oversight over intelligence\n\nxxiv\n\nIntroduction\n\n“can give a false sense of security and permit continuing inefficiencies and corruption to exist for a long time.”27 As national structures and international issues have shifted, African governments have reformed and transformed, which also has impelled reforms to African intelligence to meet the new legal frameworks and needs of the state. Fifth, African countries face some common threats from state and nonstate actors. The global power competition from foreign countries, in terms of investment and aid, have created security concerns for Africa nations.28 Nonstate actors, in the form of insurgencies and terrorists, have proliferated across the continent since the September 11, 2001, attacks. While separatist movements in Africa are nothing new, the transnational nature of some of these groups—such as the Islamic State—embodies contemporary challenges influenced by globalization and technology. This has resulted in new Africancentric organizations. Notably, the African Union Commission’s Committee of Intelligence and Security Services of Africa was established in 2004 for intelligence and security coordination and communication and now includes over fifty countries.29 This book explores fifty-five countries’ intelligence cultures. In highlighting national and international factors that shape the intelligence cultures, it also demonstrates the influences on and the effects of African intelligence cultures on governments and civil societies. The book surveys Africa and provides insight into African intelligence services to examine their roles in the countries, regions, and world. By delving into the intelligence cultures, it demonstrates African agency in security and highlights the diversity of intelligence on the continent. Yet there is no single model of African intelligence. The larger countries, usually understandably so, receive more attention and have a more prominent role in regional issues. Nonetheless, it is vital to study all African intelligence cultures if one wants to understand the past, present, and future of national security in Africa. NOTES 1.

Mali and the Western Sahara region touch Algerian margins in the west. The military’s role is especially important in the national history of Algeria from its birth as a sovereign state to contemporary political times. In 1830 the invasion of Algiers resulted in colonization by the Kingdom of France and recognition as three départements (local administrative divisions) eighteen years later. This arrangement endured until Algerian nationalism and intellectual arguments by oulémas (ulama or Islamic scholars) pushed for autonomy. As a consequence of these mounting sentiments, the Algerian War of Independence broke out in 1954, culminating in 1962. This era is pertinent in the study of Algeria’s intelligence culture as the wartime period saw the creation of Algeria’s first intelligence agencies under the direction of the National Liberation Army (ALN) on behalf of the National Liberation Front (FLN). In the early postwar period, political actors affiliated with the military were best able to organize, concentrate political power, and lead Algeria in its early development as an independent state. As a result, the military has been intrinsically involved in Algerian politics, state institutions, and the ethos of the intelligence services. Intelligence services continued to develop while the Algerian state experienced years of political power plays based on allegiances and personal brokering by politicians under the watchful eye of and ultimate approval by the top brass in the military. Over time, key intelligence agencies and units have been dismantled and re-created, often in line with the personalities of Algerian presidents and their inner circles. Yet the role of the military remains, and intelligence culture 1\n\n2\n\nChapter 1\n\nweaves its way throughout the current system. As Algeria remains engaged in political challenges, it is plausible that intelligence agencies may be amended once more, but it is currently unknown to what extent. The situation is highly reliant on political maneuvering and the dynamics between the powerful military and the presidency. This chapter contends that intelligence culture in Algeria has been shaped by historical precedents set by the entrenched role of the military in domestic politics, consequently influencing religio-ethnic relations as well as the creation of a highly politicized system. This has caused friction between ruling elites over matters of oversight and reform and supported Algeria’s reputation as a state willing to pursue its own agenda despite being sought after as a valuable partner in regional security affairs by international actors. INTELLIGENCE HISTORY The foundations of Algerian intelligence and the security apparatus are firmly rooted in developments during the Algerian War. Although there was no official agency, the first transmission agents were trained in a school in western Algeria during 1956.1 Two years later and four years into the war, the FLN created the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic (GPRA) on September 19, 1958; it was the government-in-exile in Cairo, Egypt, until 1960 and Tunis, Tunisia, until 1962. Roles of the GPRA included politicking and developing diplomatic relations with sympathetic states that would ideally recognize Algerian independence. Such responsibilities required an intelligence service to gather and share information. Thus, the Ministry of General Liaisons and Communications (MLGC) was created in 1958. It became known by its more recognizable name, Ministry of Armaments and General Liaisons (MALG), two years later. Colonel Abdelhafid Boussouf headed the agency, and his leadership left a profound mark not only on the MALG but also on the foundation of Algerian intelligence for following generations.2 Under the guidance of Boussouf, the MALG further entrenched its role as the espionage service of the military and the political broker of the FLN as it conducted surveillance and reports on individuals who remained primarily outside the FLN-ALN networks. The unit extended its reach across the Algerian wilyas (provinces) to create an allencompassing network that permitted it to conduct intelligence gathering and also engage in counterespionage activities, such as radio intercepts. The MALG operatives were well trained. Boussouf specially sought out students of high academic caliber who could be trained as intelligence officers specializing in communications.3 He created an officer corps of loyal-\n\nAlgeria\n\n3\n\nists who would later use their connections in the MALG to rise to positions of political prominence; thus the Boussouf factor in contemporary Algerian intelligence and politics extended beyond his period of direct involvement with the state intelligence agencies. Due to an affinity for militaristic systems, Boussouf found inspiration in the structure and techniques of the Committee for State Security (KGB) of the Soviet Union. In 1962, prior to the departure of Boussouf as intelligence head, the MALG sent numerous officers to the Soviet Union for training in KGB schools, an action code named Red Carpet.4 On July 5, 1962, Algeria officially gained its independence; this ushered in another period of political instability. Structures established by the French created a system of strong central governance, and any successors, especially in the context of a war of independence, would inherit a proven state apparatus.5 Infighting between influential members of the FLN led to the creation of the National Council for the Algerian Revolution (CNRA)—a politburo or executive committee headed by five powerful members of the FLN—as a means to counter GPRA governance. This move was backed by the military power of the ALN and its head, Houari Boumédiène. As a consequence, fighting broke out between them and wilyas loyal to the GPRA. The ALN side was successful and accepted the authority of the politburo; Ahmed Ben Bella was elected president in 1963. Two years later, Ben Bella was removed from power in a bloodless coup led by Boumédiène. It was during this era that the militaristic influence over Algerian intelligence and politics became overt. Boumédiène had an ingrained belief in order and discipline6 and retained a “sure grip” over the military.7 The MALG was disbanded and replaced by Military Security (MS), an institution that consolidated power in its favor in the 1970s. While MS was the main agency, the General Delegation for Documentation and Security (DGDS) acted as the unit responsible for civilian intelligence that conducted counterintelligence surveillance activities and foreign information collection. Both have been implicated in torture and clandestine political activities.8 By the late 1980s, the political system of Algeria was troubled. President Chadli Bendjedid distrusted the military influences of the MS and reorganized it yet again in 1987. A series of riots in Black October in 1988 led to the fall of the FLN as the sole governing party. Islamist nationalism was on the rise, and the security services brutally confronted discontent in the streets. Due to this intense cruelty, Bendjedid dismantled the DGDS and shifted its responsibilities to other intelligence subunits, primarily the Coordinating Directorate of Territorial Security and an Anti-Terrorist Detachment. In 1990, the now infamous Department of Intelligence and Security (DRS) became the main intelligence agency; this timing was appropriate, as Algeria would soon\n\n4\n\nChapter 1\n\nbe entrapped in a civil war. Influential general Mohamed Mediène, known as “Toufik,” became its chief. Political crisis ignited the Algerian Civil War (1991–2002) as the military (now the ANP), FLN, DRS, and other stalwarts of Algerian politics staged a coup d’état against Bendjedid to cancel a second round of elections that the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was expected to win. Years of Islamist insurgencies (led by the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria, GIA), guerrilla warfare, and a general destabilization of Algerian security followed. This period is often referred to as la sale guerre (the dirty war) due to the heinousness of tactics applied by both combatant forces. The DRS was tasked to crush Islamist nationalism and did so with a variety of means besides regular intelligence gathering. Agents infiltrated extremist cells and tortured many accused people for confessions. The organization’s false flag operations were particularly useful in turning public and international opinion against the Islamist rebels and toward support of the Algerian regime. The carte blanche of its activities meant that the DRS gained substantial autonomy, and thus it was more difficult for government officials to control.9 Further, the DRS commanded a highly compartmentalized structure, including special forces troops (the Special Intervention Group, GIS), General Directorate of Security and Presidential Protection (DGSPP), and Central Military Investigation Center, to name a few. It was an institution with clout. From its original role as the key intelligence agency in Algeria, the DRS extended its influence over political parties, the media, and the economy under the guise of the preservation of state security.10 Abdelaziz Bouteflika began his first presidential term in 1999, ushering in a period in which he made moves to shift powers away from the military establishment and toward the presidency. Generals and high-ranking officers were retired, decisions were made to steadily push the DRS out of civilian affairs, and certain responsibilities were transferred to army officers loyal to Bouteflika.11 Corruption flourished under the Bouteflika regime, and during his third presidential term in 2010 the DRS initiated an investigation into the Algerian state energy company SONATRACH over its awarding of questionable contracts. This was problematic because it gave the impression that the Algerian government was “under attack” by its own security services.12 Prior to Bouteflika’s fourth presidential term, he made significant reforms to the main intelligence agency. In 2014 he removed important responsibilities from the DRS and transferred them to the presidency. This ultimately led to the entire disbandment of the DRS, and Toufik, the DRS chief for twenty-five years, was removed as the presumed “real power behind the presidency.”13 Although this was a momentous shake-up, much of the intel-\n\nAlgeria\n\n5\n\nligence apparatus in Algeria continues to operate in the same structure and ethos established under the reign of the DRS. The Department of Surveillance and Security (DSS) became Algeria’s main intelligence agency. Its first chief was retired army general and Bouteflika loyalist Athmane Tartag. Some of its powers were transferred to the authority of the presidency, while other areas remained the responsibility of the military. It was split into the subunits of the Internal Security Directorate (ISD), Documentation and Security Directorate (DDSE), and Technical Intelligence Directorate (TRD). Algeria was rocked by protests from 2019 to 2020, spurred by a lack of good governance and a desire for political change. Bouteflika was forced to resign on April 2, 2019, and many political actors in his circle were discharged, including Tartag. The DSS was later placed under the authority of the Ministry of National Defense, and thus the top intelligence agency in Algeria was intrinsically linked with the military yet again. Throughout this condensed history, it is apparent that the war of independence, civil war, and recent political power plays have all had an influence on Algerian intelligence culture. ISSUES SHAPING ALGERIAN INTELLIGENCE CULTURE Algeria’s intelligence culture is shaped by numerous factors that are palpably linked to the role of the military and location. As history demonstrates, the military has played a pivotal role in the maturation of Algerian intelligence; however, unlike a military-civilian arrangement typical in states with advanced intelligence agencies, the Algerian institution is reflective of a military enclave.14 State security is emphasized as a priority, and this notion is extended to ideas of power and societal arrangement. Commanders have specific ideas about the capabilities of their forces and promote a nationalist rhetoric that prioritizes officers over civilians.15 This mindset is reflected in the security services–led coup against the Bendjedid administration to halt the electoral process, as well as reported acts of brutality against Algerian citizens by the DRS. This ethos led to the understanding within Algeria that politicking and important national decisions are made in a clandestine manner rather than explicitly by politicians in relevant positions. It is argued, and generally believed by the public, that Algeria is truly led by an elite class known as le pouvoir (the power) or les décideurs (the decision-makers). Simply put, real control of the country rests within the “deep state” or a combination of the army and security services alongside other unidentified figures that make\n\n6\n\nChapter 1\n\ndecisions about state policy, rather than in the president and cabinet.16 For instance, Toufik had the nickname “God of Algeria” and was viewed as the true master of the country.17 A political theory about elitism contends that national affairs are best managed by a select group of individuals with access to political, economic, social, and cultural capital, which promotes shared views due to their similar backgrounds.18 Algerian elites, especially those in the security services, military, and accordingly political affairs, received a significant level of legitimacy from the outcome of the Algerian War and its nationalist rhetoric, which prioritized officers as those who achieved the “national will” of independence.19 Therefore, these individuals as well as those brought into their network of connections continue to lead the intelligence services and hold other key government portfolios by extension. The involvement of the military and security services has ensured institutional stability despite times of political insecurity. This nexus of military and security services deeply entrenched in state institutions creates a scenario in which a culture unique to Algeria has developed. As is typical in such an arrangement, characteristics of institutional behavior are rooted in past practices and patterns of behavior that create a system of unspoken beliefs and codified norms.20 This is especially pertinent, as the history of Algerian intelligence is turbulent on paper—dismantlement, re-creation, and shifts of oversight—but its ethos and general structure have remained intact. As an example, it has been stated by experts that the creation of the DSS did not alter the core of the Algerian security services or its networks.21 The embedded influence of the military and powerful personalities within domestic affairs means that the intelligence services are highly politicized. For instance, the MALG’s first objective was to surveil anyone unaffiliated with the revolutionary movement. It is important to note that every president since independence has reached the highest office in Algiers because of the backing of the military, and some have been removed by them.22 This is evident in the coup initiated by the ANP, FLN, and DRS against Bendjedid in 1992. Furthermore, the installation of officers in a variety of civilian-related government positions demonstrates that there are really no perceptible boundaries between political affairs and those affiliated with the security services. Politicization is further substantiated by the struggle between the presidency and the military over control of the intelligence services and to whom they are accountable. Technically, and constitutionally speaking, intelligence had always been under the control of the president, but allegiances and the historical legitimacy of military authority meant that was not actually the case.23 Politicization is best exhibited by the efforts of the Bouteflika regime\n\nAlgeria\n\n7\n\nto slowly transfer key powers away from the DRS to the presidency. This was clearly a strategic move to condense power around him and away from le pouvoir, especially when the former president was under fire for corruption. While some analysts praised the move as a means to transform Algeria’s intelligence agency from secret police to a proper intelligence agency, the problematic issue of politicization was central to these events.24 One beneficial aspect for Algeria is that the military and security services have been the guarantors of regime security since independence. The dismantlement and re-creation of contemporary intelligence in the country has left its core directives largely untouched. In the current context, the DGSI will continue to implement domestic surveillance and suppress problematic opposition movements like its forbearers. More often than not, the history and culture of Algerian intelligence services reads like a drama-filled soap opera as key actors have sought to use it for political benefit and later attempted to reel it in to ensure their own political security. Algeria’s location in the Maghreb and ethnic matters are important factors that contribute to the character of Algerian intelligence. Indeed, 132 years of French colonization left an institutional framework of centralized power that afforded any subsequent regime the benefit of monopolized authority. Algerian society is further influenced by its Islamic history and related cultural exchanges; therefore, embedded principles of relationships between clans exist. Reliance on tribal interactions was an essential element in rural preindependent Algeria, but these networks morphed within the political elite in a contemporary sense.25 A modern form of this association is the established networks and clans affiliated with victors of the revolution.26 Certain aspects of an indigenous population remain a holistic aspect of societies, but in specific cases they are amended to suit the political environment, and in this case, kinship in the intelligence services of Algeria. The role of political Islam and Algerian state security ultimately came to a head during the civil war. Since that time, radical Islamist ideologies, as espoused by factions of the GIA, such as the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), have mostly eroded in mainstream Algerian political opposition. It has been noted that the “Algerian government has largely succeeded in containing jihadism by deploying security forces on a massive scale, conducting continuous military operations, and backing a policy of national reconciliation.”27 However, the transition of the GSPC into Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) has kept Algerian intelligence and security services busy, as this matter influences not only domestic security but regional relations as well. Counterinsurgency and counterintelligence operations continue on a regular basis though the Algerian units responsible for this mandate continue to act in an opaque manner typical of the history of Algerian security\n\n8\n\nChapter 1\n\nservices. Due to the delicate nature of such operations, even in comparison with international actors, this characteristic of the Algerian intelligence community will endure. The connection between national security and regional security influences the role of Algeria in the Maghreb. While Algerian intelligence and its ruling elite remain focused on quashing any internal threats to political security, complex regional relationships compel Algerian intelligence services to look outward. The Directorate of Documentation and External Security (DDSE) and the Technical Intelligence Directorate (TRD) are known for following closely the activities of Islamist fighters on the country’s border with Mali.28 A noninterference clause that once impeded the army’s ability to engage in foreign policy or deployment abroad was amended in the new Algerian constitution approved in November 2020 to allow such actions. An obvious catalyst of this is the changing security situation in the Maghreb, which must now contend with the ease with which transnational terrorist organizations and guerrilla movements cross borders. For instance, AQIM leader Abdelmalek Droukdel was killed by French forces in June 2020 in the territory between Algeria and Mali, just as wilayas along the Malian and Libyan borders act as bases or transit points for terrorist fighters.29 It is apparent that Algerian intelligence services began with a directive to focus on regime security, but the complex security environment in the Maghreb obliged its external security units to consider peripheral threats. Quality security services and decades-long knowledge of Islamist extremists active within its territory compel Algiers to be a key ally in the global war on terrorism, especially to the United States. However, political instability and economic crises in recent decades have stifled any Algerian aspirations to be the regional guarantor of security.30 OVERSIGHT, REFORM, AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION The history of Algerian intelligence services demonstrates that oversight has typically been a sticking point between civilian governance (the presidency) and the military. The security services are a powerful instrument of surveillance that can be used to stifle those opposed to the regime. Thus, it is understood why either faction covets command over the agencies. Additionally, the DRS’s past autonomy created numerous problems, and the agency had to be reined in at the risk of further destabilization of the Algerian political system. And yet despite several political shake-ups since independence, a civilian face to the regime, and changes to the intelligence services, the People’s National Army of Algeria continues to be the actual power behind the\n\nAlgeria\n\n9\n\ngovernment.31 It should be of little surprise that in the recent post-Bouteflika period the military elite have resumed oversight of the intelligence services. Reforms over the last few decades have not altered the activities or the transparency of the Algerian intelligence apparatus. As a result, the DSS and its subunits are viewed in the same vein of suspicion as the DRS and its predecessors the MS and the MALG by Algerian civilians. There remains a general perception that both the security services and the civilian government are untrustworthy.32 Nonetheless, the influence of Algerian intelligence is not as strong as it once was, especially during the years of the MS and the DRS. The Bouteflika era saw the office of the presidency erode the powers of the main intelligence agency methodically during his nearly twenty-year administration. As a result, the DRS and subsequently the DSS benefit more from their shadowy “myth of omnipotence” than their current actual abilities.33 In the grand scheme of the region and postcolonial states, the military regime of Algeria and the role of its intelligence agencies have been relatively stable notwithstanding severe political turmoil (such as coups d’état, a civil war, economic crises, and prolonged street protests). How long this will continue remains debatable. International cooperation in regard to intelligence and counterterrorism activities is evident in Algerian membership in relevant continental organizations. Algeria is a member of the African Union (AU), where it has played a central role in various regional counterterrorism initiatives.34 Membership in the Arab League is especially pertinent in the global security environment, as modern threats are often interconnected and transnational. The European Union (EU) has entered into intelligence-sharing agreements with Arab League states, including Algeria in its broad security strategy.35 Algeria has established bilateral relations in regard to intelligence sharing with important world powers, such as the United Kingdom, Russia, and the United States. In regard to the United Kingdom, London and Algiers signed a mutual security partnership in 2013. Both countries share intelligence on border and aviation security, countering improvised explosive devices and tackling extremist ideology and propaganda.36 Connections between Russia (and previously the Soviet Union) and Algeria have a long history—as evidenced by Operation Red Carpet—and this arrangement continues in the contemporary security environment. The two states engage in military-technical cooperation and intelligence sharing that has significantly increased due to regional conflicts, principally in Libya.37 Conversely, relations with France are sometimes strained due to divergent outlooks on regional development and military intervention, especially around Algerian borders in locales like Mali.\n\n10\n\nChapter 1\n\nAmerican interest in Algerian intelligence and security services palpably increased in the post-9/11 period and the wider global war on terror. The Maghreb and Sahel regions have become bases, or regional franchises, for international terrorist organizations, such as al-Qaeda and later the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). As a consequence, foreign fighters have been recruited from the region as well. As mentioned throughout this examination of intelligence culture, Algerian intelligence services are acknowledged as capable and therefore a beneficial partner to counter this serious threat. Partnerships between the two countries include the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)’s training initiatives for Algerian law enforcement and the State Department’s Bureau of Counterterrorism and Countering Violent Extremism provision of assistance with counterterrorism operations. The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), a US-based think tank, notes, “The United States recognizes the importance of Algeria for its influence on counterterrorism efforts, migration flows, energy disruption, and instability contagion across North Africa, the Sahel and Sahara, sub-Saharan Africa, and Europe.”38 Yet Algeria can be considered a wild card. The Algerian viewpoint that it is a regional leader with well-established security services means that it is prepared to handle intelligence matters on its own. Objectives from Algiers do not necessarily align with those of Washington, D.C. Such arguments were highlighted during the 2013 hostage crisis, in which al-Qaeda-linked militants attacked the In Amenas gas plant. Algiers shunned all outside help, imposed an information blackout, and disregarded international pleas for caution.39 Consequently, Algeria is a sought-after partner, but one that must be handled with caution. CONCLUSION Algeria’s intelligence culture has been considerably shaped by the influence of ruling elites with well-established ties to institutional political parties and the Algerian People’s National Army. Intelligence services have been used as a tool by le pouvoir to surveil opposition members and movements to ensure regime stability remains intact. Intelligence activities and the agencies that conduct them are viewed as shadowy and secretive—a secret police rather than an overt arm of the state security apparatus. As a result of these tactics, Algerian intelligence culture is extremely politicized. It has experienced numerous dismantlements and re-creations of agencies in line with the personalities of those in the top office in presidential administrations. The MALG became the MS, which later became the DRS, and the contemporary manifestation of the DSS has spanned the course of sixty years.\n\nAlgeria\n\n11\n\nAlgerian intelligence services are notably proficient and well trained. Since their creation, they have been professionalized and institutionalized, preparing their members to take up positions in civilian positions in various aspects of governance. This development along with the military ethos that prizes officers as defenders of the “national will of independence” over civilians further embeds military influences throughout the sector. Nonetheless, concerns about abuse of power and severe techniques have dogged Algerian intelligence services throughout their history, whether it be carrying out false flag operations against terrorist groups or the unmanageable autonomy exhibited by the DRS. These two factors, along with acknowledged experience in surveillance and telecommunications intercepts, have created a sense of mistrust of the intelligence apparatus by Algerian citizens. Certain presidential administrations—also viewed as untrustworthy by the citizenry—have moved to systemically restrict powers of agencies like the DRS so that regime security would not be impacted, as evidenced by actions of the Bouteflika administration. Therefore, over the years there has been competition between the presidency and the military brass over the oversight of the Algerian intelligence services. Surveillance of domestic opposition movements and a focus on regime security typically results in an intelligence culture that is inward looking. However, regional variables in the Maghreb oblige Algerian leadership to focus on security matters outside their borders. Questions of Islamist extremism, insurgencies, and neighboring states with civil wars require the attention of Algerian intelligence services too. The services have engaged with regional and international partners on these matters. A unique location in close proximity with regions infiltrated by violent armed groups as well as decades of intelligence collection and analysis has made Algeria a desired partner in northern African security activities, which is evidenced by agreements or cooperation with the European states, Russia, and the United States. Algeria is undoubtedly a beneficial ally, but its ethos based on self-sufficiency sometimes complicates relationships with foreign actors. Thus, Algerian intelligence culture is focused on regime preservation no matter the sorts of security threats it faces. NOTES 1.

The chapter explores this history by examining the intelligence culture’s strategic continuities and responses by the intelligence services to domestic and international challenges that did not alter their foundations or strategic objectives. The chapter is organized chronologically in four sections. The first describes the intelligence services before the 1977 attempted coup and the period after it. It highlights the government insulating the services from foreign influences other than Cuba and its state security police character. The second section focuses on the period from the 1990s transition through the end of the civil war in 2002, wherein the services were influenced by a new international thinking about security services in a post–Cold War era. This section describes how the intelligence services were focused on winning the civil war in Angola and maintaining the regime. The third part deals with the postwar reconstruction of the ruling party’s hegemony within the multiparty setting and reshuffling of the services into an intelligence community, through the 2010 constitution that reinstated the intelligence services’ earlier state security character. The fourth section details new threats and challenges to the ruling party that emerged during the 2010s and the international illiberal authoritarian populist movement to secure hegemony in the 2020s.\n\n15\n\n16\n\nChapter 2\n\nBACKGROUND Angola gained independence while immersed in a civil war during the global Cold War. The bipartition and then tripartition of the nationalist movement’s struggle in Angola involved open military confrontation between movements and international alliances, which was a serious challenge for the newly independent state. The struggle between the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (Movimento Popular de Libertação de Angola—Partido do Trabalho, MPLA), the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (Frente Nacional de Libertação de Angola, FNLA), and the National Union for the Total Liberation of Angola (União Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola, UNITA) became a military conflict with direct and indirect foreign involvement even prior to independence on November 11, 1975. While supported by Cuban troops and Soviet military material, the MPLA repelled South African/UNITA attacks coming from the south and the offensives from the FNLA, Zairean military, and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)-funded mercenaries in the north. Although the FNLA was neutralized and disbanded by 1979, the war continued during the 1980s with a stronger UNITA, which was openly supported by South Africa and Zaire. Additionally, it was indirectly funded and supported by the United States between 1976 and 1985 during the existence of the US Clark Amendment, which banned supplying arms to Angolan groups. This funding became direct after the Clark Amendment’s repeal in 1985 under the Reagan administration. Last but not least, the country was an oil producer and had significant diamond production, which raised the conflict’s international stakes. Within this context, the intelligence services’ importance to the new state is obvious. One of the first measures of the newly independent government was the establishment of the Direction of Information and Security of Angola (Direcção de Informação e Segurança de Angola, DISA) eighteen days after independence, on December 29, 1975. With the country at war and a government backed by Cuban forces and Eastern Bloc advisers, the new intelligence service followed those communist models, which already had experience against the CIA, and was supporting the FNLA/Zairean/mercenary forces. DISA acquired an ideological orientation, and a militarized structure/hierarchy and had the character of a secret police along with little institutional scrutiny, an autonomous budget, and functioning under the direct authority of the president of the party/president of the republic (constitutionally, the president of the MPLA was also the president of the country). With broad objectives (e.g., to defend the revolutionary conquests, the state, and party organs and members, and to reeducate deviant individuals), in the face of increasing domestic and foreign security threats and the ad-\n\nAngola\n\n17\n\nministrative institutional weaknesses of the new state, DISA progressively acquired more competencies. The number of mercenaries involved in the Angolan war and their capture in combat led to the approval of a specific law on mercenaryism, which expanded DISA’s authority in judicial processes during February 1977.2 After an attempted coup on May 27, 1977, led by former members of the MPLA Central Committee, Nito Alves and José VanDunem, that power was increased. Several top party members were killed in the coup, and President Agostinho Neto’s administration was only saved by the Cuban military, which effectively crushed the coup attempt. Shocking, however, was the result of DISA’s investigation, which revealed that those behind the coup had counted on Soviet support until the late stages of planning.3 From then on, Neto insulated DISA and the presidential security force from foreign influences other than the Cubans. At this time, the Angolan intelligence and security service culture gained a pragmatic political-presidential-state security police character. The services’ purpose was to defend the president as the Cubans had done. Meanwhile, the regime became more personalized, with power centralized and concentrated in the president’s hands.4 The attempted coup was followed by a bloody purge of all those who might have been effectively or possibly related to the coup. Today the number of deaths (within thousands) is still unknown because executions occurred without formal charges or trials. DISA led the purge, which spiraled out of control throughout the country. It was legitimated by the president himself, who publicly stated that no time should be wasted with trials.5 There was no legal framework to support these actions until the May 1978 Law on Crimes against State Security was passed, which permitted DISA to conduct secret investigative operations and criminal and operational investigations, instruct juridical processes (collect evidence and judicially accuse), issue judgments (court competencies), and punish the accused with reeducation (in so-called reeducation camps).6 At the end of the purge, DISA’s functions were juxtaposed with those of a police force, a public attorney’s office, the judiciary, the penal system, and the special military forces (with its own militarized units). Due to the expansion of DISA’s repression and arbitrariness after May 27, popular discontent and complaints from families in search of their missing relatives mounted. By 1979, after the purge and a subsequent move to carefully select new party members, the president and party felt secure enough, understood the purge had gone too far, and decided to dissolve DISA. A restructuring of the central state administration reestablished the Ministry of the Interior (suspended since the coup leader, Nito Alves, was withdrawn as minister) and determined that the ministry would have two vice\n\n18\n\nChapter 2\n\nministers—one for internal order and one for state security.7 The previous DISA cadres, personnel, patrimony, and activities were integrated under the new Ministry of the Interior. It soon became obvious that the move was merely a rebranding of DISA to quiet the public’s discontent and resentment. Specifically, DISA was a scapegoat to shift responsibility away from the president. The president publicly announced DISA’s dissolution as a punishment for the alleged abuses perpetrated by the agency that he purportedly only came to know about through the myriad letters from complaining families. Nevertheless, no trials were conducted against DISA’s officers. The rebranding of the intelligence service lasted a year. In July 1980 a new institution was announced, the Ministry of State Security (Ministério da Segurança do Estado, MINSE).8 Kundy Paihama, a hard-line general in the MPLA, was appointed minister by new president Eduardo dos Santos. (Agostinho Neto died during a cancer procedure in Moscow in September 1979.) Under the ministry, the intelligence services gained more power within the state. It maintained the partisan political police, and military character of DISA, but on more organized, efficient, and discreet terms. MINSE was not involved in regular arrests and searches that might harm its image; those responsibilities were mostly left to the police. As the war raged during the 1980s and as the internal civil order became better structured through the Ministry of the Interior and the police, the new ministry focused on supporting the armed forces.9 Its predecessor’s militarized units were replaced by militarized special commandos who had direct involvement in surgical war operations demanding smaller units of special forces, according to intelligence gathered by the ministry. Additionally, there were several paramilitary organizations in neighborhoods and villages, such as the Organization of Popular Defence (Organização de Defesa Popular, ODP) and the Popular Brigades of Surveillance (Brigadas Populares de Vigilância, BPV). The ministry was also responsible for the surveillance of frontiers and sensitive areas and for securing strategic infrastructure and economic sites (e.g., diamond mining areas, onshore oil fields and compounds, roads, railways, and ports). The ministry became vital to the regime and its war against UNITA until the end of the single-party system. Like DISA, it was directly subordinate to the president. Aside from the president, the institutional supervision was just a formality. The MPLA’s National Security Commission (later MPLA’s Cabinet of Security, operating under the president of the republic) was supposed to prepare an annual report for the Commission on Defence and Security of the parliament (People’s Assembly) and present it to the plenary for approval. However, such reports were rarely produced and lacked significant\n\nAngola\n\n19\n\ninformation because the People’s Assembly was merely an echo chamber for the president and party. THE NEW MULTIPARTY SETTING AND REBRANDING OF SECURITY SERVICES As the Cold War was coming to an end in the late 1980s, the civil war in Angola was headed for a negotiated solution. Diplomatic talks since 1986–1987 led to the New York tripartite accords signed in 1988 between Angola, Cuba, and South Africa, which included the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola and Namibian independence. Subsequent peace accords were signed in May 1991 between the national contenders (MPLA and UNITA), which made way for multiparty elections. The transition process had already started before the peace accords were proposed by the MPLA initiative. In December 1990, the MPLA Congress replaced the single-party regime with a multiparty, liberal democratic system. The anticipation allowed the MPLA to autonomously manage the transition, adapting state legislation and institutions to the new multiparty democratic setting while making sure that all state administration, including the legislature, executive, and judiciary, remained under its control to aid its election campaign.10 Insofar as the state security services were concerned, the pressure for reform was immediate because the Ministry of State Security was identified with the previous regime. The solution, in part, was the 1979 DISA formula, whereby MINSE was officially disbanded on February 23, 1991.11 This, however, was effectively camouflage. On the one hand, part of MINSE’s structures, cadres, and personnel were transferred to the Ministry of the Interior, concealed as regular ministry cadres. To directly command the services, the president appointed a former minister of state security, Fernando da Piedade Dias dos Santos, better known as “Nandó,” who then became deputy minister of the interior. Nandó had been minister of state security in 1986, having led a restructuring commission to modernize the services, and became deputy minister of MINSE until it was dissolved in February 1991 (meanwhile Kundi Paihama became minister until MINSE was disbanded). On the other hand, some services were detached from several units of the armed forces operating as military intelligence and remain dissimulated in those units as regular military, allowing them to work undercover. Controlling the whole state apparatus, and with help from a professional political marketing firm in Brazil as well as aided by bellicose discourse from UNITA, the MPLA won the election (53.74 percent against 34.10 percent for UNITA). The presidential election required a second round of voting (José\n\n20\n\nChapter 2\n\nEduardo dos Santos got 49.56 percent, against Jonas Savimbi’s 40.07 percent), but UNITA alleged electoral fraud and returned to war. When the war resumed in October 1992 and subsequently intensified, there was an urgent need to operationally and officially reinstitutionalize the intelligence and security services’ functions. This occurred in August 1993 with the approval of the new Organic Statute of the Ministry of the Interior and in coordination with Deputy-Minister Nandó, who led until 1996.12 The new Law on National Security officially consecrated the new liberal democratic concept of national security and the nonpartisan character of security services.13 However, learning from the 1991–1993 experience, its activities were decentralized into three autonomous branches: • The Service of Information of the Ministry of the Interior (Serviço de Informação do Ministério do Interior, SINFO), dedicated to internal/ domestic threats, under the minister of the interior, but with financial and patrimonial autonomy;14 • The Service of Foreign Security (Serviço de Segurança Estrangeira), focused on external security threats, directly under the president of the republic;15 and • The Service of Military Security of the Ministry of Defence (Serviço de Segurança Militar do Ministério da Defesa), focused on military affairs, under the minister of defence.16 The new formula rendered the services more effective, provided betterdefined responsibilities, established an efficient relationship with the military and the police, and made it less politically focused than DISA and MINSE. The new formulation was the result of several interconnected factors. First, it was an operational adaptation to the new constitutional setting through the “camouflaged” experience of 1991–1993. Second, it was part of a longer trend that started during the restructuring of the services initiated in 1986 at MINSE by Nandó, a man who originally ascended within the national police and who led better-defined competencies and articulation for the police and military. Third, it defensively reacted to the 1990s third wave of democratization (and the enforcement of political rights, freedoms, and transparency) and addressed increasingly demanding civil societies.17 Fourth, it was influenced by the emerging new international thinking on security services in the early post–Cold War era. To be clear, it was not the case that a new, “Western” school of security services was incorporated. Rather, there was a need to understand how to adapt to a quickly changing international and domestic context while preserving intelligence and security services’ major (though unofficial) role in\n\nAngola\n\n21\n\ndefending the president, party, and state machinery when the country was once again at war (since October 1992) against a stronger UNITA. UNITA could control several cities and threaten, as never before, important economic sites such as onshore oil fields and even the capital city with new long-range artillery bought with diamonds from their controlled mining areas. By then without the Cuban expeditionary armed force, the government turned to Executive Outcomes (a private military contractor) to help train the Angolan military and fight alongside the Angolan Armed Forces, valuable for their deep knowledge of UNITA because several of their operatives were former SADF and had fought in support of UNITA in the 1980s.18 Meanwhile, the international community had changed. Former UNITA allies now saw the rebels as inconvenient for new business opportunities opened by the MPLA government. Understanding the favorable context, MPLA devised an encompassing domestic, regional, and international strategy to stop UNITA. There was massive reinvestment in weaponry and restructuring of the armed forces as the international arms sales ban was circumvented through a complex secret network involving top members of the French government.19 It also included international arms’ businessmen (the Israeli French Russian Arkadi Gaydamak and Franco Brazilian Pierre Falcone) in what became known as the Angolagate scandal.20 The effort later evaded the international blockade on blood diamonds, certifying the production in government areas while making it difficult to sell “UNITA’s diamonds,” in a business arrangement involving the daughter of President Eduardo dos Santos, Isabel dos Santos, and the Welox of Israel of Israeli diamond tycoon Lev Leviev.21 In parallel, a military operation was put in place to support Kabila/Rwandan military forces in 1997 to depose Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire, which cut off UNITA from logistical support. It is impossible to know how much influential Israeli businessmen Leviev and Gaidamak helped to improve the relationship between the Angolan and Israeli governments or to what extent such an approach between governments counted in the support of US administrations and led to the end of UNITA. As SINFO recovered some of MINSE’s previous surgical military actions in effective support of the Armed Forces throughout the 1990s, support from Israel’s Mossad and Israeli technology seems to have been crucial.22 Israel was commonly associated with monitoring of UNITA’s military maneuvers since 1999. The decisive intelligence to precisely locate the column where UNITA’s leader was and eliminate him was provided in February 2002.23 In addition to Nandó, credit for a more effective articulation of the intelligence services’ objectives with the military also belongs to his successor, deputy minister of the interior and chief of SINFO General Fernando Garcia Miala, who served from May 1996 to April 1999. Miala had a parcourse\n\n22\n\nChapter 2\n\nwithin the military counterintelligence, having reached the position of assistant director. This experience in the 1990s made him an expert on foreign intelligence, and from then on he rose as a major strategist within Angolan security. Significantly, during the 1990s, despite the influence and productive articulation with Western and Israeli intelligence services, Angola’s intelligence services remained stable, maintaining a school of cadres that became intelligence leaders from April 1999 onward.24 RECONQUEST OF POLITICAL HEGEMONY IN THE 2000s Coming out of the war as the uncontested victor over a humiliated and destroyed UNITA, the MPLA sought to renew the hegemony that was partially lost in 1991 with the multiparty shift. In terms of the security services, a new Law on National Security passed in August 2002 confirmed the previous format of three branches, considering them as part of an “intelligence community.”25 For the first time in the services’ history, the word “security” was replaced by “intelligence” to characterize its activities in a new peaceful era. SINFO was taken away from the minister of the interior and put under the chief of government, which according to the Constitution is the president of the republic.26 The branch related to foreign security was now designated Services of Foreign Intelligence (Serviços de Inteligência Externa, SIE), still under direct authority of the president.27 The branch focused on military security and was named the Services of Military Intelligence (Serviços de Inteligência Militar, SIM) under the minister of defence.28 Although the war effectively ended in 2002, it took the MPLA another six years to schedule the first postwar elections in 2008. The long interval allowed the MPLA to carefully prepare the whole process, controlling as many variables as possible to shape the electoral outcome. This included electoral legislation, the electoral management body, voter registration, private and state media, electoral judicial structures, party campaign machinery, private and state economic sectors, official and unofficial electoral funding, and professional political marketing.29 The formula was not much different from 1991, but this time it lacked domestic or international constraints and aimed to achieve two-thirds of the seats, which would enable the party to approve a new constitution at will. Achieving its objective, the MPLA received 81.76 percent of votes during the 2008 election. This allowed the MPLA to approve the Constitution in 2010, which blended liberal-democratic trappings with the MPLA’s renewed\n\nAngola\n\n23\n\nhegemony—extreme concentration of power at the presidency, controlling the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary—superlative-presidentialism, as some constitutionalists define it.30 In 2010 the MPLA was at the peak of its hegemony due to petrodollars from the 2008 oil boom along with renewed political legitimacy from the 2008 electoral victory and a new constitution. A new strategic partnership with China that began in 2002 regularly flooded the country with financial and technical support for infrastructure, which allowed the government to discard the Western donor/lending community and its conditions regarding transparency and human rights. This strength prompted a reformulation of the intelligence services focused on domestic issues, officially and unashamedly reacquiring their state police security character. In March 2010, SINFO became the Service of Intelligence and State Security (Serviço de Inteligência e Segurança do Estado, SINSE), which along with the Services of Military Intelligence (SIM) and Services of Foreign Intelligence (SIE) would be “essential auxiliary organs” of the president’s executive functions.31 It was up to SINSE and SIE to support the exercise of the legislative, executive, and judicial powers and (for SINSE) to support the Ministry of the Interior and the National Police in the fulfillment of their missions.32 As the president’s auxiliary organs with such broadly encompassing functions, this reformulation meant that the intelligence and security services recovered their “big brother is watching you” role over the whole state and political system. Thus, the services’ long path since 1991 had come full circle. The new power upgrade also brought new challenges and strains within the political system. Transforming the whole intelligence community into auxiliary organs implied a closer relationship with the already existing organs in security, namely the Military House/House of Security of the Presidency of the Republic. Beyond administrative functions and articulation between the presidency and other national security organs, the House of Security has effective operational activities, directly leading the militarized Unit of the Presidential Guard (UGP), composed of thousands of men. Within an extremely concentrated political system, the auxiliary organs are a first layer of all state powers (legislative, executive, judicial, and military). Considering the distributive neo-patrimonial character of the system, the first layer also provides primary access to management and distribution of state resources, most prized by political competition. This led to clashes between the security services and the president’s House of Security. Disagreements mounted between two “strongmen”: the head of the House of Security, General Vieira Dias Kopelipa, and the director general of SIE, General Garcia\n\n24\n\nChapter 2\n\nMiala. SIE had gained ascendancy within the intelligence community due to Angolan politics in the international capitalist world of state-private business networks (legal and illegal), as well as the political weight of its Director General Miala. The clash between the two resulted in the arrest of General Miala in 2006; he was deposed as director general of SIE under the serious accusation of preparing a coup. Such accusations did not result in prosecution, but he ended up being convicted and sentenced to four years in prison by the Supreme Military Court in 2007 for failing to attend the ceremony of his military demotion. This was obviously a pretext, proving how politically manip"
