        "text": "Assamese Transcription - involves the conversion of spoken language into written text\n\nAssamese Website Translation - deals with the translation of websites and their content, including text, images, and videos, to reach a wider audience.\n\nAssamese Interpretation - is the oral translation of spoken language, typically in real-time, either consecutive (taking notes and then interpreting) or simultaneously (interpreting while the speaker is speaking).\n\nAssamese Voice-over Translation - involves recording a voice-over in a different language for a video or audio production.\n\nAssamese Subtitling Translation - involves the translation and display of written text in a visual format, typically in films or videos, to accompany the spoken dialogue.\n\nTranscreation - a creative form of translation that adapts the message of an original text to make it more suitable for a target audience, while preserving its essence.\n\nAssamese is the official language of Assam and the eastern region of India. It is an eastern Indo-Aryan language that partially evolved from Old Assamese and has evolved through a process of Assameseization, resulting in a unique Assamese dialect spoken mostly in Assam's Brahmaputra Valley. Assamese shares its roots with the Assambora Kachari language from which it is derived and features its distinct characteristics, such as its use of linguistic prefixes, lack of gender distinctions, and its special affinity for nouns over verbs.\n\nMoreover, it pulls up significant elements from other neighboring languages too. Its origins can be traced back to the Proto-Indo-Aryan group of languages that was in development around 2000 BCE when the earliest Aryan tribes were migrating into North India.\n\nThe written script known as Brahmi Madhabani emerged around the late 9th or early 10th century CE. This script still dominates the traditional Assamese literature while the modern form of Assamese utilizes Latin orthographies and contains numerous borrowings from English, Sanskrit, and other regional languages.\n\nPoliLingua is proud to offer certified Assamese translations for clients all around the globe.

According to the most recent census data from India, the number of people who speak Assamese as their first language is approximately 13 million.\n\nThe Assamese-speaking market is primarily concentrated in the northeastern region of India, particularly in the state of Assam. It's important to note that the size of the Assamese-speaking market is only one factor to consider when deciding whether to translate business or other documents into Assamese.\n\nOther factors, such as the level of education and literacy among Assamese speakers, the presence of other languages in the region, and the cultural and economic significance of the Assamese community, can also play a role in determining the potential reach and impact of translations into Assamese."
