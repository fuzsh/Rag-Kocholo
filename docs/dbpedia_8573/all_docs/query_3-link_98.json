        "text": "Prayer Profile\n\nThe Assamese of Bhutan The Assamese primarily inhabit the state of Assam, which is located in northeastern India. However, more than 160,000 Assamese can also be found in neighboring Bhutan. Their native language is called Asami, an Indo-Aryan language that is closely associated with Tibeto-Burman dialects.\n\nThe Assamese first came to the southeastern regions of Bhutan from nearby India. However, their attempts to settle were challenged by confrontations with the native Bhutanese. In the seventeenth century, the British fixed the Assam-Bhutan border, thus resolving the conflict.\n\nToday, the Assamese form only a small minority in Bhutan, the \"land of the dragons\". They dwell in southern Bhutan's humid, subtropical climate, where an average of 80 inches (2,000 mm) of rain falls each year. The land and climate are much like that of Assam, where they originated. It is a country filled with beautiful rivers, valleys, and mountains reaching 5,000 ft (1,500 m).\n\nWhat Are Their Lives Like?\n\nSince most of the land inhabited by the Assamese is used for cultivation, a majority of them are farmers. An abundance of rice, corn, potatoes, wheat, and citrus fruits is grown. Medicinal herbs also flourish throughout the hillsides. Pigs, cattle, and chickens are usually raised on the farms.\n\nHighways have been constructed through the area, linking India with Bhutan. This facilitates free trade between the two countries. In addition to farming, some Assamese work at local manufacturing industries that specialize in the production of such things as food, cement, and lumber.\n\nSmall villages are scattered throughout the region. Houses are usually made of bamboo, mud, and thatch, much like the huts of the Assamese who live in India. They grow rice in small fields around their homes, which allows them to easily keep an eye on the crop. Most villages are self-sufficient and have enough food, so there is little need for response to outside influence and change. In contrast to Assam, there are no cities or towns in this region of Bhutan, allowing the Assamese to continue enjoying a rural lifestyle.\n\nRhinoceroses, elephants, tigers, monkeys, and other wild animals roam the area. The grasslands often grow so dense and high that even elephants have difficulty wandering through the region.\n\nWhat Are Their Beliefs?\n\nAlthough Bhutan is predominantly Buddhist, 80% of the Assamese living there are Hindus. Hindus worship millions of gods, including the \"creator god\" and the \"god of destruction.\" Animals as well as humans are believed to have souls. Cows are sacred, but animals such as snakes and monkeys are also revered.\n\nHindus believe that horoscopes and astrology can determine a person's fate. They use these methods to choose the right mate, to select an occupation, and to calculate a person's time of death. Another important teaching is that the soul never dies. They believe that when the body dies the soul is reborn, or reincarnated, as either an animal or a human. Religious rituals are constantly practiced to ensure the next life will be better than the present one. Prayers are recited upon waking; baths are usually taken before meals; certain foods are only eaten on particular dishes; and different garments are worn while eating and sleeping.\n\nHindus are divided into social classes known as \"castes.\" Generally, those belonging to the lower castes are poor, while those in the upper castes are educated and wealthy.\n\nWhat Are Their Needs?\n\nCurrently, there are two missions agencies working among the Assamese of Bhutan. Both the Jesus film and the Bible are available in the Asami language. Despite all of this, there are still less than 500 Assamese believers in this region.\n\nAbout 90% of the adults in Bhutan cannot read or write. Perhaps the need for teachers will open a door of opportunity for Christians to live among the Assamese and share the love of Christ with them.\n\nPrayer Points\n\nTake authority over the spiritual principalities and powers that are keeping the Assamese bound.\n\nAsk God to raise up prayer teams who will break up the soil through worship and intercession.\n\nAsk God to grant wisdom and favor to the missions agencies targeting the Assamese.\n\nPray for effectiveness of the Jesus film as it is shown among the Assamese.\n\nAsk God to anoint the Gospel as it goes forth via radio in the Asami language.\n\nPray that the Holy Spirit will create a hunger in the hearts of the Assamese to know the one true God.\n\nAsk God to encourage, and protect the Assamese believers in Bhutan.\n\nPray that God will raise up Christian teachers who are willing to live and work among the Assamese.\n\nAsk the Lord to raise up strong local churches among the Assamese by the year 2000.\n\nSee also the following Assamese groups:\n\nThe Assamese of India; The Assamese of Bangladesh.
