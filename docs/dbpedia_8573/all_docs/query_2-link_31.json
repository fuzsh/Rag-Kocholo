        "text": "The centrally the day was observed in Guwahati at Sri Sri Madhabdev Intertiol Auditorium, Srimanta Sankaradeva Kalakshetra. It was preceded by a rally from ASACS premises that was flagged off by popular actor Ravi Sarma and Mount Everest climber Henry David Teron. The theme of the year is -Increasing Impact through Transparency, Accountability, and Partnerships.\n\nASACS project director Varli Deka said, “World AIDS Day gives an opportunity for people to unite in the fight against HIV and show support for people living with HIV.” She said that though Assam falls under low prevalence category (0.06 per cent) when compared to the tiol Average (0.26 per cent), the state is highly vulnerable and is a hotbed for new infections as the state is the gateway of all north-eastern states and is surrounded by three high prevalence states – galand, Manipur and Mizoram apart from the fact that there is constant in flow of truckers and migrants in the state. She further said that Assam is the first state in India to launch HIV intervention in prisons and also in correctiol homes for women.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Principal Secretary to the Government of Assam, Health and Family Welfare Samir Kumar Sinha said, “Apart from the clinical and support, people living with HIV require absolute mental support.” He stressed increasing the level of awareness by involving various institutions and organizations who are willing to work in the field of HIV/AIDS. He further said that Government would help in providing all kinds of resources to create HIV awareness. Celebrities from Assamese film industry Kopil Bora and Moloya Goswami also addressed in the meeting. Speaking on the occasion, Bora said, “Since awareness is the only vaccine for HIV/AIDS, youth must be made aware on HIV/AIDS.”\n\nGoswami, in her speech, said, “The Northeast is very vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Thus, awareness is the need of the hour. Youth must be thoroughly sensitized in HIV/AIDS. More and more films must be made on socially sensitive issues like HIV/AIDS.”\n\nAwards were distributed to the best performing institutions/organizations. A blood dotion camp was conducted at the venue along with a folk performance. Apart from the state-level function, World AIDS Day was also organized in other districts of Assam with various awareness activities. Some of the awareness activities, which were taken up prior to the day of the event include video spots on satellite channels, audio spots in FM channels , CM’s message in TV and Radio/FM radio, phone-in-live pogramme in Doordarshan and All India Radio (AIR), newspaper advertisements, hand shake campaign, etc."
