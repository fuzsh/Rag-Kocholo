        "text": "Assamese language is one of such languages that have been gifted to us by our ancestors and helps us establish a deep connection with the state of Assam in India. Though not widely spoken outside its geographical boundaries, it provides unique insight into the rich culture of this region. This ancient language is an essential part of India’s history. This unique language is the official state language in India and it has its own distinct culture and heritage associated with it.\n\nAssamese is a language spoken primarily in the Indian state of Assam. It is an Eastern Indo-Aryan language and the official language of Assam, as well as one of the 23 recognized languages in India. History records its usage back to at least 12th century, when it was known as Kamrupa or Kamrupi Apabhramsha. The Assamese language is an official language of India and one of many regional languages spoken in the area. It is spoken by over 20 million people primarily located in the northeast part of Indian states such as Nagaland, Tripura and Meghalaya. The language has its own unique alphabets called ‘Assamese script’ that consists of 12 vowels and 36 consonants. Its writing system is based on Bengali-Assamese script, which is derived from the ancient Brahmi script. The language has also been influenced by Sanskrit, Arabic, and English languages over time.\n\nAssamese is used for a variety of purposes including literature, news media, radio broadcasting and education. Additionally, it has been established as the language of choice for various cultural activities such as plays and movies. Assamese speakers are considered to be able to understand Hindi, Bangla and Oriya with relative ease. Assamese has been around for centuries and is the official language of Assam state in India. It belongs to the Eastern Indo-Aryan languages group and is closely related to Bengali and Oriya languages. In terms of history, it can be traced back to the 8th century when Brahmi script was used by Sankardev, to spread his religion Vaishnavism. Since then, it has evolved as a distinct language with its own unique alphabets, grammar, pronunciation and vocabulary. Its current form saw development during British rule in India during 19th century when Assamese literature developed significantly with contributions from many writers including Lakshminath Bezbaruah. It also had an influence of Persian and Arabic languages.\n\nOver the years, it has become a widely spoken language in several states including Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and West Bengal. It is used for educational purposes as well as for official work in many parts of India. The alphabets are derived from the Eastern Nagari Script with 12 base vowels and 32 consonants used to write out the words. It also includes special characters like Nasalization marks, Anusvara marks, Visarga marks etc which further enrich the language. Due to its association with culture, history and literature, Assamese has a strong presence among different communities that speak it. Further development can be seen today with its use as an official language in the state of Assam, as well as its use in literature, and songs. As such, it is an important language to learn and understand for those who wish to explore and appreciate the culture of North East India.\n\nAssamese language dates back to 12th century when it was used as the court language for the Ahom kingdom in Assam. Its usage became widespread during this period and it continued to be widely spoken throughout the region, with its alphabets having been standardized in 1873. It is written in a script derived from the eastern branch of Brahmi script which includes 15 vowels. Assamese is predominantly spoken by over 15 million people in India and Bangladesh making it one of the prominent regional languages in North East India. Apart from its usage as an everyday language, it has also been used extensively for literary purposes such as poetry, drama and stories. It has even made its way into music, with classical Assamese music being popular in the region.\n\nThe history of Assamese language dates back to the Kamarupa kingdom which existed in the 1st millennium AD. It is believed that the language evolved from Sanskrit, Pali and other local dialects spoken at the time. Over time, it continued to evolve due to invasions from various powers across India and eventually reached its current form by the 16th century. Today, it is one of the official languages recognized\n\nAssamese was used in literature and music as far back as the 12th century when it was written in its own script. Through centuries of growth, the language has developed its own grammar structure that makes it distinct from other surrounding languages. It is now widely used for communication in the regions where it is spoken and is taught in many schools across India.\n\nToday, Assamese continues to be an integral part of Indian culture with a strong presence online and on television channels broadcasted within the region. It serves as an important tool for helping us understand more about the history and culture of the region, with many ancient and modern works being written in the language.\n\nThe Assamese alphabet is an abugida script composed of 11 vowels and 33 consonants. Assamese also uses several modified alphabets like Meiteilon and Siya-Kuchi that are used to represent sounds that are not found within the main alphabet set. These variations are generally used when writing songs or poetry, where they help add to the lyricism of the piece. In recent times, Assamese has been adapted to be used on mobile devices by introducing a new keyboard layout called ‘Axomiya’ that makes typing easier using transliteration methods.\n\nAssamese is an important part of Indian culture as it has a long history and wide usage within the region. With its relatively simple alphabet system, learning this language can be easy for those who already speak some related dialect or language. As technology advances and more people have access to the resources needed for language learning, the Assamese language continues to spread and grow in popularity. It is an important part of Indian culture and a vital tool for understanding more about the region’s history. In order to ensure that Assamese can be preserved for future generations, numerous organizations have taken initiatives towards its promotion. These include setting up educational institutions which teach Assamese literature and culture and encouraging authorship by providing funds for writing books on Assamese topics."
