        "text": "Nava Thakuria\n\nGuwahati: Amidst the threat of spreading novel coronavirus (precisely the Omicron variant) across India, Asom Granthamela (Assam Book Fair) came to a successful end in Guwahati, the virtual capital of Northeast. Organised jointly by Asom Prakashan Parishad (Publication Board Assam, the government sponsored literary institution) and All Assam Publishers & Book Sellers Association maintaining necessary Covid-19 precautions, the 12-day event genuinely paved ways for observation, debate and resolutions over the future of books.\n\nBraving the cold wave, thousands of book-lovers from different parts of the region thronged at Assam Engineering Institute playground in Chandmari locality every day to celebrate the festival of reading, information and wisdom. Nearly 150 book-publishing groups and retailers comprising a few from neighbouring Bangladesh, as well as Delhi and Kolkata besides the local publication houses showcased their printing works. They were put in six rows in memory of renowned Assamese intellectuals namely Hemchandra Goswami, Padmanath Gohain Barua, Panindranath Gogoi, Giripada Devchoudhury, Rabin Devchoudhury and Sananta Tanti.\n\nInaugurating the book fair on 29 December 2021, State education minister Ranoj Pegu emphasized on developing a culture of book reading and he insisted on translating various literary works in Assamese to different larger languages and also translating ethnic language works of the region into Assamese. Pegu, also the Chairman of Prakashan Parishad, expressed happiness that more people are now reading books as they acquired the decent habit with an aim to escape the loneliness created by nationwide corona-lockdown days.\n\nThe minister also honoured Nandita Devi with Prakashan Parishad literary award for her novel ‘Bongol Bohu Door’ along with its publisher Nagen Sarma of Jyoti Prakashan. Kuladhar Saikia, president of Asom Sahitya Sabha, the State’s highest literary forum, graced the inaugural function to stress on popularising the books among young people with varied and rich contents. He argued that new technology should be used for making books available to them. Noni Gopal Mahanta, adviser to the State education department, revealed that even after the invasion of internet, the books remain popular around the world.\n\nThe inaugural function was attended by Prakashan Parishad secretary Pramod Kalita, its vice-president Sumanta Chaliha, top education department officer Preetom Saikia, State publishers & book-sellers association’s office-bearers Imran Ahmed, Baharul Islam Choudhury, etc. The first evening’s cultural program was inaugurated by Pabitra Margherita, member-secretary of the State level advisory committee for student and youth welfare.\n\nMentionable is that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the publishers & book-sellers could not organise Northeast Book Fair in 2020 and it even failed to accommodate the annual event because of violent anti-CAA (citizenship amendment act) agitation in 2019 that almost defaced the city with panicky situation among the residents. However, Prakashan Parishad successfully held Guwahati Granthamela in 2020 with visible public support.\n\nOrganisers of both the events joined hands this time to go for a combined trade show, where State chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma took a positive initiative. Sarma, who could not grace the inaugural function, visited the fair later and interacted with the book-lovers. A large number of youths at the venue applauded Sarma, where he appreciated efforts of the organisers for making the festival of wisdom possible. Next year, both the events may take place separately if the corona-situation improves, he commented.\n\nThere were however initial resentments among a section of book lovers as the name of Granthamela was temporarily changed from Guwahati Book Fair (or Northeast Book Fair) to Asom Granthamela. But it was done under a difficult situation and Prakashan Parishad has publicly announced that it has no intention to dishonour the legacy of Guwahati Granthamela that started its voyage in 1984.\n\nPeople of Assam will always remember contributions of the great souls including author-journalist Chandra Prasad Saikia who were instrumental in organizing the first book fair in the region. Prakashan Parishad joined hands with National Book Trust (of India) to launch the book fair movement and it was a huge success. Later Prakashan Parishad took enough challenges to organise the book fair independently in 1987 and it continued.\n\nIn the initial years, the regular venue of Guwahati Granthamela was the Judges field on the south bank of mighty river Brahmaputra, which was later overcrowded by the book enthusiasts. Soon a large number of publishers and booksellers from various parts of the country started participating in the book fair and lately the venue was shifted to the present location to accommodate more participants and appreciators.\n\n“With the availability of cheaper mobile internet services across the country there were apprehensions that the young people might turn away from the practice of reading. But till now it has been proved wrong. Various exciting (extreme) audio-visuals, made easily available through the internet, can attract a huge number of people, but they finally get solace in serious reading only,” said Dhiraj Goswami of publishers & book-sellers association, adding that books worth rupees five crore were sold in the fair.\n\nVisiting the Granthamela, Union minister Sarbananda Sonowal also appreciated the organisers for taking the initiative. Buying several books and interacting with booklovers at the venue, Sonowal also commented that books remain the symbols of identity of a community and society. The young generation should inculcate the habit of reading books, he opined, adding that a book revolution should be everyone’s resolution. Assam children’s literature trust secretary Hrishikesh Goswami accompanied Sonowal at the venue.\n\nThe book fair witnessed the formal release of more than 50 new books in two halls named after distinguished Assamese authors Dr Lakshminandan Bora and Homen Borgohain. Prakashan Parishad itself released 16 books at the fair. It also showcased the digital channel, where Assamese folk-tales are recorded with the voice of celebrity performers. A number of literary discussions as well as children programs were organised. Every evening, cultural programs were inaugurated by celebrated personalities like Moloya Goswami, Surya Goswami, Aimi Barua, Gayatri Mahanta, Partha Sarathi Mahanta, etc at the venue.\n\nBangladesh assistant high commissioner, posted in Guwahati, Shah Mohammad Tanvir Mansur also graced the book fair to welcome representatives of three visiting publication houses namely Murdhanya, Sarulipee and Joyotee from his country. In a brief meeting, attended by Mihir Deuri, editor of Prakash (published by Prakashan Parishad), author-journalist Rupam Barua, columnist Ranen Kr Goswami, author Prasanta Chakrabarty, poet-journalist Nabajyoti Pathak, Jintu Geetartha with a few others, the diplomat thanked India again for supporting their freedom movement.\n\nPresence of many eminent Assamese authors and academicians including Govinda Prasad Sarma, Hiren Gohain, Shyama Prasad Sarma, Dhrubajyoti Bora, Gajendra Adhikari, Pranabjyoti Deka, Rita Choudhury, Anuradha Sarma Pujari, Rani Gohain, Bipul Deuri, Jogesh Kakati, Mira Thakur, Ankita Dutta, Raktim Patar, Ajanta Burhagohain, Ranju Hazarika, Jayanta Madhab Bora, Abhijit Bora, Phanindra Kumar Devchoudhury, Pranjit Bora, Nilim Kumar, Bandita Phukan, Apurba Saikia, Atanu Bhattacharya, Satyendra Narayan Goswami, etc were enjoyed by the young book-enthusiasts.\n\nSimilarly, notable personalities like Dinesh Goswami, Dayananda Pathak, DN Chakrabarty, Gangapada Devchoudhury, Narayan Talukder, Jagadish Patgiri, Paramananda Majumder, Mrinal Chandra Kalita, Khagen Saikia, Niranjan Kalita, Arindam Borkataky, Mayur Bora, Utpal Dutta, Debashish Sarma, Noni Borpujari, Aminul Haque, Nilima Thakuria, Baharul Islam, Bhagirathi, Devajit Bora, Pabitra Gogoi, Subodhmalla Barua, Pranjal Sarma Vasistha, Hyder Hussain, Bhaskar Sarma, Naba Talukder, etc visited the stalls adding colour to the festivity.\n\nA session dedicated to Nilamoni Phukan, the third Assamese litterateur (after Birendra Kumar Bhattacharya and Mamoni Raisom Goswami) to receive Jnyanpeeth award recently was intriguing for the literary enthusiasts. The closing ceremony on 9 January 2022 was graced by Jnyanpeeth awardee Damodar Mauzo, an illustrious story writer, novelist and critic in Konkani language from Goa. Bodo Sahitya Sabha president Toren Boro was also present on the occasion.\n\nAn interactive session involving young writers, where they narrated their literary dreams, received appreciation from the audience. Moderated by this writer with supports from promising author Geetali Bora, the session was participated by budding talents like Anindita Parag Saikia, Aparajita Pujari, Utpal Deka, Monika Das, Pranjal Talukder, Gitali Saikia, Srinjana Sarma, Diganta Nibir, Pranjal Barman, Manaswini Mahanta, Jayanta Dutta, Farhan Javed, Pranjal A Sarma, Ranjit Patgiri, Manoj M Neog, Mukutraj Sarma, Ankurita Phukan, Dwip H Borhi, Ratan Sadiyal, Shyamanta Payeng, Munidra Baishya, Nayanjyoti Sarma, etc. They were unanimous in their views that the medium (physical paper) may change in future, but the habit of reading will continue forever.\n\nAbout The Author"
