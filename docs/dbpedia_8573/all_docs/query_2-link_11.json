        "text": "News\n\nCity News\n\nguwahati News\n\nJollywood reels under lack of theatres\n\nThis story is from April 21, 2012\n\nJollywood reels under lack of theatres\n\nAs Indian feature films enter their 100th year of existence this week and Assamese films complete 85 years, we look back at the century of cinema that was, where it all began and where it stands today.\n\nGUWAHATI: At a time when the Great Indian Celluloid Dream was being lived out in the subcontinent, it was beyond imagination for anyone in Assam to even dream of making a film due to lack of infrastructure - there were neither studios to shoot films, nor theatres to screen them. At that time, it was visionary, playwright, composer and poet Jyotiprasad Agarwala who breathed life into the Assamese celluloid dream.\n\nAs Indian feature films enter their 100th year of existence this week and Assamese films complete 85 years, we look back at the century of cinema that was, where it all began and where it stands today.\n\nIn 1935, Agarwala, despite being aware that he would have to incur financial losses, went ahead to make the first Assamese Film 'Joymati' at a cost of a whopping Rs 60,000, under the banner of Chitralekha Movietone. Thus, he set the reel rolling for Jollywood, as the Assamese cine industry is known.\n\nDue to lack of trained technicians, Agarwala was a one-man army and switched between the roles of director, editor, set and costume designer of his maiden venture, released on March 10, 1935.\n\nThe film, sadly, failed to do well, but this did not deter Agarwala from trying his luck once again after with 'Indramalati' in 1939.\n\nAgarwala not only gave Assam it's first and second films; he also nurtured the talent of the state's most well-known singer Bhupen Hazarika by giving him a chance to act and sing in 'Indramalati' at the young age of 13. Hazarika immortalized his voice in the song 'Biswa Bijoyee Navajowan' in the film.\n\nIn the 40s, the Assamese film industry started picking up pace. In1941, the late Rohini Kumar Baruah made a film on a relevant historical topic called 'Manomati'. This was followed by Parvati Baruah's 'Rupahi' (1946), Kamal Narayan Choudhury's 'Badan Barphukan' (1947) and Phani Sharma's 'Sjiraj'.\n\nIt was in the next decade that Assamese films came to the limelight with 'Piyali Phukan', a film on India's freedom struggle bagging a National Award.\n\nIt was also in the fifties that Assam produced noted film director Nip Barua. His films 'Mak Aaru Moram' and 'Ranga Police' won various state awards and a silver medal at the national level.\n\nBhupen Hazarika made his directorial debut in 1956 with 'Era Bator Sur' (Tunes of the Abandoned Road), in which legendary singer Lata Mangeskar sang a song in Assamese.\n\n\"Bhupenda would take time out from his busy schedule to be direct films. He was eager to learn new tips on filmmaking. His 'Era Bator Sur' is loved by many,\" says veteran actor-director Abdul Mazid, whose blockbuster film 'Chameli Memsaab' won the Best Regional Film and Best Music Direction awards at the National Awards. Hazarika had also scored the music for 'Chameli Memsaab'.\n\nIn the meantime, filmmakers like Abdul Mazid, Pravin Sharma, Saila Barua, Indukal Pattazarika, Gauri Barman, Atul Bardoloi, Sujit Singh and Nalin Duara emerged, amongst others.\n\nSamarendra Narayan Deb's 'Aranya' (1970), Kamal Choudhury's 'Bhaity' (1972) - the first colour film of Assam, Manoranjan Sur's 'Uttaran' (1973), Deuti Barua's 'Bristi' (1974) Pulok Gogoi's 'Khoj' (1974), Padam Barua's 'Ganga Chilanir Pakhi' (1976), Dr Bhabendranath Saikia's 'Sandhya Rag' (1977) and Atul Bordoloi's 'Kollol' (1978) are some of popular films of the 70s.\n\nIn the decade of the 80s internationally-acclaimed film director Jahnu Barua came into the limelight. He directed popular films like 'Aparoopa', 'Halodhia Choraye Baodhan Khai', 'Bonani', 'Firingoti', 'Papori' and 'Xagoroloi Bohu Door'.\n\nBhabendra Nath Saikia, meanwhile, won the National Award for the best screenplay in the film 'Agnisnan' (1985). Saikia's 'Sandhyarag' (1977) was the first movie to be screened in Indian panorama.\n\nActor Indra Bania brought laurels to the country in 1988 by being chosen as best actor ('Halodhia Choraye Baodhan Khai') in Locarno International Film Festival that year. Gautam Bora, meanwhile, received the Indira Gandhi Award for the best directorial debut ('Woshbipo') in 1990.\n\nIn 1991, Assamese actress Moloya Goswami bagged a National Award for her role in the film 'Firingoti'. Jahnu Barua and playback singer Tarali Sharma won National Awards for best director ('Xagaraloi Bahu Door') and best playback singer - female ('Akashitarar Kathare') in 1995 and 2003 respectively.\n\nDespite its glorious past, the 85-year-old Assamese film industry is ailing from lack of cinema halls as many theatres were shut down following a threat from a militant organisation of the state in the late 90s.\n\nEminent Assamese actor Nipon Goswami recently urged the state government to take initiatives to open mini cinema halls in suburban areas to protect the future of the Assamese films.\n\n\"More than in towns, it is the suburban and rural areas where audiences eagerly wait for the release of local movies. Rural audiences in the state also wait for months for the mobile theatre season to begin each year. The Assamese film industry is in desperate need of a viable market. Financers are ready to contribute their share to construct mini cinema halls but the government needs take up the lead,\" Goswami says.\n\nThe North-East Film & Video Technicians Association (NEFVTA) is constantly urging film industry workers to become members of the body to avail the facilities offered by the labour ministry. Only 778 cine workers in Assam are registered with the NEFVTA.\n\nCinematographer Sibanan Baruah, general secretary of NEFVTA, said, \"A large numbers of cine workers in the state are yet to be registered with the labour ministry. Our organisation is asking such people to register with us so they can avail the benefits and unite under a common banner.\"\n\nChandra Mudoi's latest film 'Bakor Putek' and Pradyot Kumar Deka's 'Samiran Baruah Aahi Aase' are two films released this year. Young director Deka has brought Ulfa hardliner Paresh Baruah to the silver screen in his latest film.\n\n'Jaangfai Joonaak' ('From the Shadow of Silence'), the first Assamese film shot with high-definition (HD) cameras, hit screens all over the state on Bhogali Bihu last, which shows the willingness of filmmakers to experiment. But a sound infrastructure needs to be built to enable these filmmakers to reach out to audiences.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nVisual Stories\n\n10 most photogenic UNESCO World Heritage Sites\n\ntravel\n\n10 fruit salads to enjoy throughout the year\n\nFood\n\nâDiscovering the architecture of India's famous monumentsâ\n\nLifestyle\n\nIn pics: The beautiful house of Bollywood power couple Vicky & Katrina\n\nLifestyle\n\nHow to make Beetroot Kofta Curry\n\nFood\n\n10 ways to deeply connect with your children\n\nLifestyle\n\n7 days, 7 hill stations in South India to explore\n\ntravel\n\nHow to make Railway-style Tomato Shorba\n\nFood\n\n10 cutest puppies that will make your day\n\nLifestyle\n\n8 iconic lines by English romantic poets\n\nLifestyle"
