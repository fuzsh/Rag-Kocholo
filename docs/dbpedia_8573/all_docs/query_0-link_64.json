        "text": "Ambubachi Mela – The name conjures up images of sadhus with tridents and matted hair, wild singing and gesticulating devotees high on bhang, traffic jams and from now marketing.\n\nAlthough I am now a ‘resident’ of Assam and have been proud owner of a PRC since the last 25 years , I haven’t visited the Mela in the past partly due to disinterest and mostly due to ‘ search of greener pastures’ which signifies the lives of many ‘lucky’ Northeasterners. The MBA tidal wave which has engulfed and submerged the nation since 2000 is evident at the festival too which is a new sight for me. Five years ago, steel bar and cement company hoardings were definitely not welcoming me to Guwahati.\n\nThe first sight that greets me as I get off the bus at the Kamakhya bus stop is a huge advertising board of an ‘India renowned astrologer and palmist Guru’. Devotees were of course expected to a pay a visit to the gentleman and get rid of their afflictions.\n\nDevotees stand in queue, in front of the Ganesh Mandir to receive water of a particular mineral water company and a miniscule packet of food comprising of a banana and two slices of bread. I walk past them.\n\nMore advertising boards, smaller in size, perched on electricity posts greet me. My friend, ‘Mr India renowned’ and a attractive lady smile down on me. There is a newcomer too, a ‘vastu expert’, who is a gold medal winner.\n\nThere are two roads to reach the Goddess Kamakhya and both have Ganesh mandirs at the start. I clamber up the serpentine road which resembles the multi-coloured strings of a giant kite with colourful flags and the multitude of vehicles passing by. For a moment the tiny dots of houses and fields of humanity spread out far below me makes me feel like a God among mortals but then I return to reality with the honk of a passing trekker.\n\nFinally after 45 minutes of arduous trekking I am at the top and some 400 metres away from the temple entrance.\n\n.\n\nThe top of the hill is dotted with red hoardings of a certain mobile company which gave it the air of a huge mobile phone fair of some kind. These flags stick out sorely like a fly in the custard.\n\nTraders jostling to get the attention of the devotees scream and brandish their wares. “Come here Dada, Lingams here, pure sandalwood, devotional CDs too.” The crowd is varied. Trinket sellers with cheap earrings and from Bengal, gem stone sellers from Rajasthan, local vendors selling sandalwood pieces and stone potas, photos of gods and goddesses add colour to the festive atmosphere. The aroma of freshly fried sweets waft in the air and the mounds of various sweets in the open air stalls tempt even the diehard hygiene conscious.\n\nA mini and colourful market has sprung up here. The sights and smells of the market are pleasurable to say the least\n\nA little ahead a beggar without legs, lies on a wheel drawn small wooden cart. He is arguing with a spunky looking young woman, of about 30 with wild disheveled hair blowing out in all directions. Bits of their conversation drift in as I pass. “Why don’t you just move away from here? It’s my space. I have been sitting here for a long time.” The girl retorts, “You don’t own this place do you?” Its business time and turf wars are on.\n\nFinally I wade past the crowd and metal detectors at the temple gates and come inside the temple compound. Pandas or the resident priests of the temple rush about, an ocean of floating orange, escorting devotees to offer their prayers in the inner sanctum of the temple.\n\nWithin the temple premises, the Saubhagya kund beckons. A pond as old as the temple itself, today a big flex banner of a ‘leading’ bank beckons me to come and take a dip at the pond. It is difficult to ascertain whether that is the name of a scheme floated by the bank or the name of a pond. Somehow I suspect, more than the water of the pond it is investment in the bank which is meant to arouse your ‘saubhagya’.\n\nAs I do a parikrama of the temple, a group of sanyasins scamper behind an old man who it seems is apparently trying to distribute some food and coins. Some coins fall out of the old man’s hands and there is brief chaos and hands and legs fling out in all directions to arrest the fall.\n\nThe pigeons and the sight of the ancient temple restore some calm to the surroundings and my mind and seem to be the only constant in the ever changing surroundings.\n\nThe grand dame of Assamese cinema\n\nThere was not much in terms of conversation between actress Jnanada Kakati and her mother when she was offered her first film role in 1947. Her mother simply told her to pack and leave and to never come back.\n\nThe film was Parghat. Today the eighty year old actress reminiscences, “I was dumbstruck when I was offered the role of heroine in the movie. Cinema was the domain of people in Mumbai. Although I had watched a bit of Joymati it was beyond my comprehension that Assamese people would be in a film.”\n\nWhen she reached Kolkata for shooting she was met with more probing questions, “No one from a good family comes into acting. How have you come into this profession? Why have you come?”\n\nTo this, she had a simple response. “What is wrong with this? If we educated people do not come into this profession, who will?”\n\nAssamese society in the early period of the twentieth century was like a closed seashell, clammed so as to protect its perceived pearl of culture and professions like singing and dancing, especially by the fairer sex were frowned upon.\n\nBack home, while she was away, her parents were exposed to the jibes and snide remarks of neighbours and ‘well-wishers’ who passed comments like, “You will get many son-in-laws now.”\n\nFor as long as she could remember there was always this tussle; a tussle between dreams and societal conformity which started at an early age when she used to hide backstage at the Asom Club in Shillong to watch her father Deben Das, a reputed theatre artist, perform on stage.,\n\n“I was called Akoni and I used to come and watch my father's rehearsal but my father used to forbid me coming to watch. The chowkidar was instructed to drive me away and it drove my mother to despair as to why I went there again and again. I don't know why but to see all these actors put on colours, dress as women and dress up in different characters attracted me and I decided that one day I would be an actress.”,\n\n“I loved songs and singing and would often go and watch people singing or listen to them after school was over much to my mother's concern and worry. In school, teachers used to tell me to sing whenever there used to be a play. I would gather few of my friends and perform a small play on someone's verandah. I would imagine that I was a queen of the land and I would sprout wings and fly away.”\n\nThese were traits not held in great esteem by her parents. Threatened and cajoled by her parents to be ‘good’ she would be often beaten up in an effort to make her ‘normal’.\n\nWhen she was studying in the sixth standard, the legendary Bishnu Rabha saw her dancing and offered to teach her. His prediction was, “Jnanada, you will become a great actress one day.” However after just one week of teaching the dancing classes had to be stopped as ‘well-wishers’ again told her mother that the ‘dancing business’ was not good; another example of the prevalent mind-set.\n\nShe persisted and by the time she was in college she was always the first choice to sing and dance and even teach others.\n\nWhen all threats and cajoling failed her parents planned to get her married which they thought would put an end to their daughter's gallivanting. However much to their dismay, their son-in-law turned out to be a staunch supporter of his wife. Himself very interested in the performing arts, her husband Lohit Kakati, encouraged Jnanada Kakati to act in films and also follow her heart. Remembering him, she says, “I was and I still say I am so lucky to have got married to my husband. He was an artist, singer, dancer and a handsome person. It was due to his support that I could go ahead with my wishes despite opposition from my parents.”\n\nHer lifelong persistence paid rewards when she became the first Assamese actress to go to the famed Berlin film festival in 1959 for her film Puberun, the first Assamese film to be screened at the Berlin film festival.\n\n“I feel lucky and privileged that even in that period I could go to a place like Berlin film festival after doing an Assamese film. We were taken around in a car through the streets of Berlin and people lined up on both sides of the roads to shower flower petals on us and chanting “India… India,” as our car passed by. It was at that moment that I realized what a great moment it was and I felt proud to be an Indian. A girl from a middle class family got the opportunity to dance with a Hollywood star like Cary Grant.”\n\nUnknown to most she was also an accomplished radio announcer for All India Radio and when All India Radio started in Assam for the first time in Shillong, she became its first announcer. She became a staff artist, singer, news reader and drama artist.\n\nAlthough many offers poured in after Parghat she missed out on some important ones.\n\n“Bimal Roy sent me a letter with 80 rupees. He was making a movie called Tothapi and he wanted me to play the lead role of a dumb lady. After Tothapi the next to follow would be the Hindi film Bandini, a role that would later go to Nutan. I told my husband that I don't want to go. I returned the money and told him that I will not be able to take that offer. Had I acted in that movie my stature might have been very different probably. Then another offer came. It was a film called Shesher Kobita. However, I had an accident at the time just before shooting and I was expecting at that time. So that offer was also gone. After that I did Assamese films, Sorapat and Piyoli Phukan.” PC Baruah offered her a role too for a movie which was to be like Joymati but unfortunately he passed away before he could start the movie.\n\nMostly seen in maternal roles on screen despite not being very aged at the time, she laughs as she explains this, “I love pathos and I am a very kind hearted person. Maybe that is why directors loved to offer me the role of a mother.”\n\nMore offers kept coming in. She did some Bengali movies with actors like Nitish Roy and Ahindra Choudhury.\n\nDirectors she worked with\n\n“I will be forever grateful to Bolin da (Phani Sharma). He was a great director for me. Although, he was a very strict man he loved equally. Nip Baruah was also a good director, very calm and quiet. Despite all troubles, they dedicated themselves to the craft. On some days, shooting would be wrapped up in half a day. But nobody gave up.”\n\nThen and now\n\nThe world of acting seems a very different place today. “Everything is so technically advanced today. When we were shooting Piyoli Phukan, even a lizard had to be taken to Kolkata because the colour of a lizard in Kolkata was different from the lizard in Assam. We would stay for months at one place to complete the shooting but today a young college girl who is also an actress can come and give a shot during the lunch break and leave. We don't know what makeup was or dress designer was. We would dress on our own. Today there are books providing instructions on each and every aspect of acting. We went from an environment of thorns and in that context I sometimes think that maybe we have given a lot to films in Assam.”,\n\nA proud mother and a housewife, today she hopes that the new generation should know about artists like her. “Many of the new ones do not know about us. They have not even heard about us. Today cinema is like Bombay type. Directors give so much freedom today. I wouldn't blame the young actors of today. It is the responsibility of the director to extract the best out of an actor. Our boys and girls act well. If our producers had the money they would also do well. But still we need to improve”.\n\nAge may have robbed her of many things but her passion for acting is still alive. “Although, I have aged and I am old, I am still desirous of acting. If I get a good role I think I would do it well,” she says.\n\nMemorable roles\n\nRole of Meghali in Puberun.\n\nRole of Seuti in Piyoli Phukan.\n\nAudio interview with Jnanada Kakati\n\nhttp://tindeck.com/player/v1/player.swf?trackid=svss\n\nThe tag of a ‘villain’ doesn't bother Abdul Majid but he thinks people are afraid of him.\n\nIt happened one afternoon on some nameless day in the early nineties. Abdul Majid was shopping in Fancy Bazaar with his family. In those days there were no restrictions on smoking and while his wife and others busied themselves with shopping, Majid lit a cigarette. Suddenly, he was aware of a lot of eyes on him and hushed panicky voices of some women. “He is here. Let us go out. Go…go” In a matter of a minute the shop was empty. It was not the first time and certainly, not the last time. Curious neighbours or fearful classmates would often ask his family members, “Is he like this at home too? Does he beat you?”\n\nAll testimonies to the acting prowess of a multi-faceted actor but perhaps best remembered as the granddad of all villains in Assamese cinema.\n\nThe beginnings\n\nBorn on November 16, 1931 in Jorhat but officially recorded as May 1, 1932, the young Abdul Majid was attracted to films and theatres from a very young age. Recalling his first brush with cinema, Majid says, “There was a godown of the agricultural department near my house and there used to be a man there called Didaruddin Ahmed, a neatly dressed man in a dhoti, pump shoe and kameez with his finely combed back brushed hair. He used to take me with him to the Jorhat theatre. Occasionally, I would be taken backstage where he would dress up according to his role and sometimes as a woman. I used to find this very funny. Sometimes we used to watch Jatra parties from Kolkata. I always loved watching but never thought that I would act in films or theatre. Sometimes some of us would get together in someone's house and some of the boys would perform a play using bed sheets and other household implements as our equipment. This was my initiation to the world of theatre”.\n\nHe little suspected that these childhood skirmishes with theatre and cinema would one day result in fame and become a way of life for him.\n\nBeing a culturally vibrant place and home to doyens of Assamese culture such as Hem Baruah and Indreswar Sarma there was a tradition in Jorhat that matriculation candidates would enact a play. The young Majid used to assist but one day someone failed to turn up and Majid was asked to enact the absentee's role. Although hesitant, the initial reticence disappeared when onlookers applauded him for his acting. Thus, once started, there was no looking back.\n\nMajid was part of the club called Kristi Sangha under which they started enacting the plays. With the latent talent bursting forth, the youth were soon advised by lot of people to start writing their own plays instead of enacting Bengali plays written by others, which was a norm at the time. Majid eagerly took to the task. Bonchitaa , his first play was written in 1957. Then came Dhuli Makoti followed by Sur and Sampoorno Mahabharata. Much later his play Sihot Ahise found place in a Sahitya Akademi collection of plays.\n\nEarly days\n\nWhen he and his friends were around 24 -25, a wild idea about making a movie crept into their minds; wild because they had no idea about where the money would come from. “We went to Syed Abdul Malik to make his novel Matir saki into a film. He gave the go ahead. At the same time, the premiere of Smritir Porokh was being held in Jorhat for which Brojen Baruah and Nip Baruah had come. We went to meet them. We called them to watch Ronga Police. They watched the play and suggested that we should instead make Ronga Police as this would make a great movie. So we went ahead with that. 10 June 1957 – It was the mohurat of Ronga Police and the first day I came to be associated with movies.”\n\n“I played the role of an anti-hero in the movie. I wouldn't call it negative. I tried to portray the character differently because I had done it numerous times on stage,” says Majid. It worked and his role was appreciated by many and his particular style of walking was even copied.\n\nMore movies followed and all the while he continued to engage with the medium where he first started -theatre- and gave memorable performances in plays like Spartacus, Srimanta Sankardev, Bhagawan Sri Krishna, Jibon Driver and Bazarot Omola among others.\n\nChameli Memsaheb\n\nIn 1975 came, Chameli Memsaheb, the second directorial venture of Abdul Majid (after Morom Trishna), a movie that would go on to win national awards for best Assamese feature film(Rajat Kamal award) and also be the first Assamese film to be screened at the Rashtrapati Bhawan. After reading the short story by Nirod Choudhury, Abdul Majid wrote the screenplay for the same and showed it to Choudhury who gave the go ahead for the same. Despite stiff opposition to the casting of Binita Borgohain as Chameli, a girl from the tea gardens, owing to her mongoloid looks, Majid decided to go ahead. He explains his choice. “I knew the acting skills of Binita so there was never any doubt in my mind about her acceptance in the eyes of the audience. The end result was there for all to see”. The film took the box office by storm and more than 30 years after the movie released it is still regarded as an Assamese classic.\n\nIt also gave him the role of Monglu, the misguided and lovelorn boy in love with Chameli, a role which he regards as one of his best performances. More directorial ventures followed in the form of Banahangsa and Banjui but he was still a few years away from becoming the synonym for villain in Assamese cinema.\n\nVillain 101\n\nIn 1985, Pulok Gogoi directed Sendur, a social drama laced with healthy doses of action. A protesting Abdul Majid was convinced by the director that no one else could play the role of Jagat Barua, an evil zamindar and the rest is folklore today. Sendur became a super hit and Abdul Majid the villain was born. “Pulok Gogoi made me a villain. I didn't want to take up the role initially but Gogoi coaxed me saying that no one else would be able to do justice to the role.”\n\nHits like Puja and Suruj followed and the image of Abdul Majid the evil man became entrenched in the minds of the masses.\n\nIt would not be an exaggeration to say that apart from Dinesh Das, another epitome of onscreen devilry in Assamese cinema, nobody else has defined ‘villain’ more aptly on screen than Abdul Majid.\n\nSo who is a villain and what are the traits needed to play a villain? Majid says, “There has to be a character to a villain. Nobody can become a villain just for the sake of being bad. How does the script make or present the villain? That is important. If we see Maniram Dewan, Upaja Matir Sun, Brojen Baruah's role in Dr Bezbaruah those can be called villains.”\n\nSurprisingly, the bad man on screen has never enacted any villainous roles in theatre.\n\nOn the present status of Assamese cinema\n\nAssamese films might never have attained the rank of an ‘industry’ but most of the veterans cannot help but feel a pang of sadness at its present plight. Majid is no different. He sums up the present scenario succinctly when he says, “They are making films in the Assamese language but the films are not Assamese.”\n\n“It's not that good films are not being made but the majority disappoint. You have to look at where you are. You have to look at who your audience is. There is too much emphasis on glamour without substance. Where is the glamour in Assam? Where is the glamour in the Assamese films? There is no need for it.”\n\nNot too happy with the mobile theatre scenario in the state which he believes apes too much of the Hindi film industry he has some words of advice for them too. “If mobile theatre keeps on moving on at this rate one fine day suddenly it will collapse. When people become fed up of looking at all this they will stop paying them to watch it.”\n\nNever one to sit idle, when he was not facing the camera, he was behind it producing immensely popular serials like Naamghoriya and Jor Puri Haat or directing culturally relevant documentaries like Puppet Dance of Assam, Azan Fakir, Bahadur Gaonburha, Music and dances of Goalpara, Rituals, Customs and culture of the Rabhas of Assam.\n\nToday, more than 50 years after his first film, this doyen of Assamese cinema is still busy with acting in and directing projects. Still active he has just finished shooting for a film and is on the lookout for interesting scripts. For his contribution to Assamese cinema, this untiring servant of culture was given a lifetime achievement award in 2010 under the banner of Prag cine awards besides being awarded numerous times by the state government and other private organizations chief among them being the Bishnu Prasad Rabha award in 1986.\n\nClick on the ‘play’ button below to listen to how he started his career.\n\nhttp://tindeck.com/player/v1/player.swf?trackid=tzpa\n\n“Give me a gun and I shall once again kill the corrupt. I am old but not old enough to be unable to shed my blood for the sake of my country”, says the 95 year old man.\n\nNo, the person in front of me is not suffering from delusions but is Umesh Chandra Dev Choudhury, the oldest surviving member(in Assam) of the Indian National Army(INA), Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's grand machination to expel the British from India.\n\nServing as a havildar clerk (combatant) in the British army in 1941, Choudhury was trained at Peshawar and sent to fight on behalf of the British Army to Hongkong and then to Singapore. When the British lost, he became a Prisoner of War (POW) there. Freedom fighter, Ras Behari Bose, an ardent believer in extremism for freedom started gathering the POWs.\n\nRecalling his association with the INA, Choudhury says, “In 1943, Netaji came to Singapore from Germany after meeting Hitler. He made us realize the ultimate cause of liberating India. I remember him calling us to sing anthems at the camp during evenings. I knew Bengali very well as I had passed engineering from Rajsahi (now in Bangladesh). Netaji was impressed with me and asked me to translate leaflets from Bengali into Assamese. The leaflets would be dropped by airplanes. It was one of the greatest days when Netaji recruited me to the Azad Hind Fauj.”\n\n“Bengal used to be the hub of revolutionary activities and I was simmering with rage to liberate the country from the colonists. Netaji always told us that if we reached Chittagong than the British will be driven out in a humiliating manner.”\n\nHowever that dream remained unfulfilled as the British recaptured Singapore and the INA members were deported back. At that time, the legal proceedings and the convictions were made under a three-fold system, White, Grey and Black. The whites were the ones who testified that their reason to join INA was due to poverty or need of money and they were given least punishments. The grey category was for those convicted for harbouring mild nationalistic feelings. The last category of ‘black' was for ones who were guided by feelings of liberation and extremism to the core and had joined the INA solely to win India's independence. This category was meted out the harshest punishment. Umesh Chandra Dev Choudhury was one amongst the 20,000 blacks.\n\nIn 1946, after serving a sentence at Multan Jail, (now in Pakistan) he came back to Assam in December with a certificate stating ‘Unfit to serve in British India' and was treated like an outcast. It took four more years after independence for the certificate to be revoked and in 1951 he was recognised as a freedom fighter.\n\nHabits die hard. At the age of 95, his defiance and anger hasn't deserted him. “This is not the independence we fought for. It is painful for me to see our present bunch of so called leaders. Their day of reckoning will come soon,” he warns.\n\nThe beauty of simplicity\n\nMridula Barooah – the name evokes a vivid image of an alluringly beautiful village girl, the kind that you read about in story books and the girl every man fancies to take home to their mother. Setting many a heart aflutter with her looks and acting prowess, this beautiful lady was one of the few leading ladies of the small but purposeful Assamese film industry, from the late 70s and 80s, till the early nineties.\n\nEarly days\n\nHailing from the small town of Sootea, in Sonitpur district of Assam, the Barooah family comprising of six children and the parents moved to Biswanath Chariali. Her father, Jogendranath Barooah, was the ‘outdoor incharge’ at the Pratapgarh tea estate and it was from here that the young Mridula Barooah started her theatrical journey by acting in dramas in school.\n\nRecalling her introduction to acting she says, “As a child, I and my siblings went to watch movies and films with child artists in them used to be a great source of observation for us. After coming back we would compete with each other to re-enact the scenes that we had seen.”\n\nHowever, her initiation into acting came much later. “Due to varied reasons I didn’t act in school plays earlier than the 10th standard. I was a painfully shy girl and the school was in Sootea, which was quite far from my home at the Pratapgarh tea estate. However, when I was in the tenth standard I decided enough was enough and that year I took part in everything right from games to drama and won prizes too!”\n\nIt was here that she received the third prize in the drama competition, the first of many awards to follow.\n\nAnother stepping stone for her imminent film career was when she received the first prize at a state level drama competition (All Assam Surjya Bora Memorial one act play competition) when she was in college.\n\nIt was here amidst this culturally vibrant atmosphere that she was discovered by director/ actor Abdul Majid who had gone to enact a role in a movie. She was promptly signed up for her first film Upopath (opposite Pranjal Saikia) with Hemanta Dutta as director and Pramod Baruah as producer. In the meantime, actor Hiren Choudhury too, saw this young girl at work and told director Dwijendra Narayan Deb who was looking for new faces for his film, Moromi. Mridula Barooah was offered the title role and thus at the young age, she had two roles opposite leading stars of the day and was juggling college and films at the same time.\n\n“I still don’t know how everything happened but it is all thanks to these people. Everybody was very nice and cooperative. They perhaps saw something in me and thus I was offered two roles in two films so quickly.” Although Upopath was her first signed film, Moromi was her first released film.\n\nUnlike in many cases, there was no resistance towards her acting career on the part of her parents. “There was only one condition and that was to be good at whatever I did.” And she did more than ‘good’.\n\nIn 1979, came the film Megha Mukti, where she played the role of twin sisters (the first double role in Assamese films) which established her among the public but it was the twin super hits of Buwari and Kokadeuta, Nati aru Hati which did away with any remaining doubts as to her acting abilities and firmly cemented her place in the hearts of the people.\n\nSuccess followed with films like Maa and Protima which incidentally were films with women centric roles, roles where many a time she had to essay characters older than her real age.\n\nReflecting on this she says, “The eighties was a very good era for Assamese films in all senses and maybe it was due to the society of the period that directors were focusing more on women centric roles. Today, of course, it’s a quite different scenario.”\n\nIn the nineties, when she was at her peak, however roles and films dried up due to unrest of secessionist groups and a general demise of production houses.\n\nAlthough, it would be difficult for viewers to let go of the image of the sweet innocent rustic girl attached to her, she still essayed few different roles whenever she was offered one. In Hiya Diya Niya she essayed a negative role, in Dr Bhabendra Nath Saikia’s Kaal Sandhya , where she had a guest appearance; she played the character of an innocent woman who submits to the vagaries of fate and has shades of grey. Similarly her roles in Aborton, Itihaas and Gun Gun Gaane Gaane fetched her critical acclaim.\n\nToday, she is quite content with the way things have panned out and her long journey from lead actress to a matriarchal guide on screen. “You do feel it when suddenly you realize one day that you are no longer going to be the leading lady but it is only momentary. Playing my own age is what gives me immense satisfaction now,” says Barooah.\n\nAdding to her repertoire, she also turned producer in the early 2000s and produced serials for Doordarshan. She also produced documentaries for the state government.\n\nDue to a persistent leg ailment she had to spend five years from 2007 to 2011 on the sidelines but now she is ready to face the lights again and has recently completed shooting for the film Bir Chilarai.\n\nShe is however hopeful that the good times of Assamese films would come back. “The new generation of artists is very talented and if they gain access to more resources they could definitely do a lot better.”\n\nThings you did not know about her and a few memorable moments\n\nShe had an immense desire to be a teacher, a desire she nourishes till date.\n\nFavourite actor – Amitabh Bachchan.\n\nFavourite actress – Jaya Bachchan.\n\nFavourite performance of her own – Protima, Itihas, Gungun Gaane, Ahir Bhairav.\n\nMemorable moments in her own words\n\nIn the film, Shakuntala aru Shankar Joseph Ali, my character dies towards the end. My ‘body’ was carried through the streets of Guwahati on a mini truck. Now most people obviously didn’t know that it was not a real funeral procession and so many started paying their respects from a distance. The truck was just passing a city bus and it so happened that there was a young boy standing on the doorstep. The cameras were not rolling at the moment so I decided to open my eyes for a second. It was at that precise moment that the boy’s eyes and my eyes met as he was about to gesture as a mark of respect towards my ‘body’. To this day, I cannot forget the look on his face. I cannot describe that look. I guess it was a mix of terror and horror for him.\n\nBrief bio-data\n\nBirthday:\n\nApril 14\n\nAwards:\n\n(The list given is not the complete list but a brief representation)\n\nBest actress for Kokadeuta, Nati aru Hati in 1984 awarded by Assam Silpi Samity\n\nBest supporting actress for Maa in 1987, awarded by Eastern India Motion Pictures\n\nLife time contribution to the Assamese film industry award in 2006 by Yotirupa, Assam\n\nAssam state govt. award for best supporting actor in 2005\n\nAs a Producer:\n\nProduced documentaries for Doordarshan.\n\nExcerpt from Buwari:\n\nThe origin of Assamese Cinema can be traced back to the dreams and imagination of a revolutionary visionary, Rupkonwar Jyotiprasad Agarwala, who was also a distinguished poet, playwright, composer and freedom fighter. He was instrumental in the production of the first Assamese Film Joymati, under the banner of Critrakala Movietone. Due to the lack of trained technicians, Jyotiprasad, , had to shoulder the added responsibilities of the script writer, producer, director, choreographer, editor, set and costume designer, lyricist and music director while making his maiden film. The film, completed with a budget of Rupees sixty thousand was released on March 10th, 1935. It was the third Indian talkie to be released, a fact unknown to many. It is unfortunate that like so many early Indian films, the negatives and complete prints of Joymati are missing.\n\nThe film did not do well and Jyotiprasad Agarwala had to endure heavy losses. However, despite the failure of his venture, Jyotiprasad made another film after a lapse of two years titled Indramalati (1939). It was his second and last film. The eminent composer and singer of Assam Dr. Bhupen Hazarika, played a stellar role in the film.. With the passing away of Jyotiprasad, the Assamese film scenario witnessed a temporary lull for about a couple of years. But things changed with the onset of war, Taking advantage of this, the Late Rohini Kumar Baruah made a film on a relevant historical topic called Manomati (1941). It was followed by films like Parvati Baruah’s Rupahi (1946), Kamal Narayan choudhury’s Badan Barphukan (1947), Phani Sharma’s Siraj, Asit Sen’s Biplabi, Prabin Phukan’s Parghat and Suresh Goswami’s Runumi.\n\nBut the most remarkable film of the fifties was Piyali Phukan which went on to win a National award. In 1955, a new talent Nip Barua made his directorial debut with Smriti Paras. His subsequent films Mak Aaru Moram and Ranga Police bagged many state awards and a silver medal at the national level. Dr. Bhupen Hazarika also produced and directed his first film Era Batur Sur. Prabhat Mukherjee made a film on the universality of mother-hood, Puberan (1959),which was shown at the Berlin Film Festival. The next memorable production was Lachit Borphukan by Sarbeswar Chakraborty. Dr. Bhupen Hazarika made his unforgettable musical Shakuntala (1961) which proved equally successful with critics and the press. It also won a president’s award. Following this, a number of films began to be produced regularlyproduction and were released. These included Nip Barua’s Narakasur, Anil Choudhury’s Matri Swarga, Brojen Barua’s Itu Situ Bahuto and Mukta & Anwar Hussain’s Tejimala.\n\nBy the mid-sixties , film were produced regularly in Assam and 62 films were produced between 1935 to 1970. Besides the film makers already referred to, many others engaged in film making during the period included Pravin Sharma, Saila Barua, Abdul Mazid, Amar Pathak, Indukal Pattazarika, Diben Barua, Debkumar Basu, Amulya Manna, Gauri Barman, Atul Bardoloi, Sujit Singh, Nalin Duara and Prafulla Barua.\n\nDuring the period of 1970-82 a total of 57 Assamese films were made. The emergence of new directors also bolstered the health of the fast maturing industry. Samarendra Narayan Deb’s Aranya (1970), Kamal Choudhury’s Bhaity (1972) the first colour film of Assam, Manoranjan Sur’s Uttaran (1973), Deuti Barua’s Bristi (1974) Pulok Gogoi’s Khoj (1974) Padam Barua’s Ganga Chilanir Pakhi (1976) and Dr. Bhabendranath Saikia’s Sandhya Rag (1977) and Atul Bordoloi’s Kollol (1978) are films worth – mentioning.\n\nThe outstanding directors of contemporary Assamese Cinema are Jahnu Baruah (Aparoopa, Papori, Haladhia Choraye Baodhan Khai, Banani, Firingoti, Hkhagoroloi Bohu Door) ; Sanjeev Hazarika (Haladhar, Meemanxa); Late Dr. Bhabendaranath Saikia (Anirbaan, Agnisnaan, Sarothi, Kolahol, Abartan, Itihaas, Kaal Sandhya) Dr. Santwana Bordoloi (Adajya) and Bidyut Chakraborty (Rag Birag). Their Films have won National and International Awards.\n\nAssamese Classic Movies\n\nJoymoti- The first Assamese movie- Joymoti, directed by Jyoti Prasad Agarwalla was released in the year 1935.\n\nRupahi- The fourth Assamese movie Rupahi, produced & directed by Parbati Prasad Baruva was released in 1946. Screenplay, dialogue, lyrics and even the music of the movie was composed by Baruva himself.\n\nSiraj– Siraj is another remarkable Assamese movie- directed by Phani Sarmah. Siraj was the sixth Assamese movie released in 1948. The film speaks about the unity among the people of the Hindu and Muslim community. Bishnu Rabha and Phani Sarmah, inspired by the story named ‘Siraj’ written by Lakshidhar Sarmah prepared the screenplay and dialogue of the movie.

Dr. Bhupen Hazarika was then an active member of Indian people’s Theater Association and in the fifties almost all the workers of I. P. T. A. were influenced by the sorrow and happiness, struggle and hope of the common masses and associated themselves with the creative work related to folk music and culture of the common Assamese people. Era Bator Sur was also a result of one such effort. The story and the music of Era Bator Sur reflects the emotional upsurge of the people of that era. The theme of this movie was based on characters belonging to the tea labourers community of Assam. The exploitations carried out by one class of the society also finds importance in the movie. Dr. Bhupen Hazarika is also the music director of the movie. The cast of the movie includes Phani Sarmah, Bishnu Rabha, Balraj Sahni along with Bijoy Shankar, Iva Asau, Tassaduk Yusuf etc.\n\nPuberun– The first Assamese film screened in an international Film Festival is Puberun.

The heroine of the movie Gyanada Kakoti was also present during the screening of the film in Berlin.\n\nThe story is based on mother-child relationship and the truth that every child of this world is equal. Another remarkable feature of this film is that Margaret Anderson from the London Dramatic school acted in this film. In the history of Assamese Cinema this was for the first time that an actress from England, acted in an Assamese film.\n\nThe role of the mother was played boldly by Gyanada Kakoti and against her was Tassaduck Yusuf.

Following the footsteps of Doctor Bezbaruah directors / producers got encouragement to make commercially successful movies in later days of Assamese Cinema.\n\nThough this film laid the base of the commercial value of a movie, yet it put a question mark on making movies based on the simple life of Assamese village folk.\n\nDoctor Bezbaruah was the first Assamese thriller and for the first time the outdoor and indoor shooting took place in various locations of Assam.\n\nGonga Silonir Pakhi – Gonga Silonir Pakhi was directed and produced by Padum Baruah and released in 1976.

The bulk of his innovations are for people who cannot afford to buy the machinery. To these people, he gives away his machinery for free.\n\nAt a time when more and more people are leaving their homes in the Northeast to build their careers and lives abroad, hidden from the glitz and glamour of the big cities, far from sophisticated laboratories, one man toils away to make life easier for those amongst us who are less fortunate. Meet scientist, innovator and social entrepreneur Uddhab Bharali, a person whose seemingly innocuous innovations mask their tremendous utility.\n\nWith various award-winning designs such as the areca nut peeler, cement brick making machine, mini-CTC plant for small tea growers, cassava peeler and pomegranate de-seeder to his name, Uddhab Bharali is proof that inventions can be a tool for social service.\n\nIt is a pleasant afternoon and the sun is just beginning to go down for the day. A light breeze tickles the senses and the leaves of the neighbouring coconut tree.\n\nThe little man sitting in front of me is attentive as I put forward my questions. I ask him how he would define innovation. Suddenly, he stares at the coconut leaves and remarks, “Except for a safety pin and a zipper, we could innovate everything.The key to innovation lies in those coconut leaves too. Let me illustrate. Almost every rural household in Assam has a coconut tree and many people make a living by selling coconuts, but if there were a machine to process the leaves to make brooms out of them, this would add to the farmers’ existing income. This is innovation.”\n\nIt is this zeal that has led him to come up with 98 engineering devices which help make life easier and generate income for previously unemployed and low income households. “I am perhaps the only man in the world who can proudly claim that innovation is my profession,” smiles Bharali.\n\nBharali, originally from North Lakhimpur, has come a long way since the days of his first innovation in 1988 and, as is the scenario in most cases, he didn’t have it easy. “I had to repay a family loan of Rs 18 lakh and the bank was at my doorstep to take all our property. I was desperate,” he remembers. In those days, there was a great demand for polythene film-making plants which used to cost around Rs 5.7 lakh. Bharali had in his mind a design for a similar plant for much less. The bank agreed to lend him Rs 1 lakh. This was, he says, his only way to try and pay off the loan and save his family. He came up with a unit that cost only Rs 67,000. The product became a hit and there was no looking back for him after that. He realised that he could make a living as an innovator.\n\nNone of his innovations are for large-scale commercialisation. Instead, they are targeted at rural low-income households. He explains, “My designs are meant for people in need. Once upon a time I had nothing. I used to skip meals and sleep on an empty stomach. My innovations should mean something to those who are deprived. I am not here to strike business deals with huge corporate houses.”\n\nBharali charges nominal fixed sums of money from government and private parties as a consultant. But the bulk of his innovations are for people who cannot afford to buy the machinery. To these people, he gives away his machinery for free.\n\nTo keep the cost of the product down, he makes the design itself simple. Machines are usually built at the UKB Agrotech machine designing research centre, Bharali’s own institution, which he says is the only machine designing research centre in the country. “Earlier, all the machines were made at the centre only but nowadays, if it is a slightly larger device, the parts are made by different people in my home district and sent to UKB to be assembled.”\n\nHe carries forward that same zeal for innovation in teaching too by having a unique training scheme where, irrespective of one’s education, a three-month course is created for youngsters who are trained on the job by allowing them to assist his staff at the design centre. Departing from the usual practice of charging money for training, the students are instead given a stipend of Rs 1,000 and free medicines are provided to their families in times of need. This, according to Bharali is done to encourage the poor youth in the villages to come forth. However, this training comes at one cost, a self-enriching one at that. After the end of the three months, each trainee has to have acquired requisite knowledge to be able to earn Rs 2,000 from Bharali.\n\nIt is this attitude of thinking differently that has resulted in him getting recognition in the form of prestigious awards including the President’s Award for Innovation in 2009, Shristi Samman – Master Innovator Award by National Innovation Foundation, India, in 2007 and also the Meritorious Invention Award 2010 from the department of science and technology, government of India. He is also a nominee for ‘The Tech Award’ a program of Tech Museum, San Jose, California this year. He also found mention in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) journal in 2006 for his innovation of the pomegranate de-seeding machine. He was featured by Discovery channel in 2007, which he believes was responsible for some of his subsequent fame.\n\nWith so much fame and recognition, one would think that his dream would be to settle in a big city, but Bharali has shunned all glamour and is content working in his small hometown. He reasons, “See, it is very good to dream and the grass always looks greener on the other side but my philosophy is that, If I cannot local problems here, how can I even dream of solving the problems of the globe ? I think the environment where I work now is conducive to my creations. Had I been in a big city like Guwahati the glamour wouldn’t have let me work as much as I do now.”\n\nNinety-eight machines later, there are no signs of tiring. He is working on his dream project of building a mechanised toilet for the handicapped. He says, “The physically disabled in most cases have to remain dependent on a lot of things throughout life and in many cases for very private things like dressing, using the toilet and for feeding themselves. I would consider it to be my proudest moment as a human being if I could come up with an innovation in terms of a wheelchair which offers them all these benefits. The wheel chair will have a facility for automatic dressing and undressing of the person, attached toilet and flushing system. The chair is ready but I am still working on the certain aspects of this innovation.” He is trying to extract carbon from fly ash which is a problem for a client and also working on developing a rolling table for small tea growers. Two other future projects would be to remove iron and arsenic from drinking water in rural areas.\n\nAll of his innovations are registered with the National Innovation Foundation (NIF), an autonomous body of the department of science and technology, government of India. Right now, all the innovations are in the process of getting patented.\n\nBharali’s work and talent has been recognised in different prestigious academic institutions across the country and thus he is associated with the Rural Technological Action Group (RUTAG) of IIT, Guwahati. He is also a guest faculty at the Indian Institute of Entrepreneurship (IIE), Guwahati and a resource scholar to numerous schools and colleges in the state.\n\nHowever, despite so much recognition, Bharali remains mindful of his humble origins and sees recognition as a means to connect to needy people. He says, “I have been fortunate enough to be recognised for my work. But today, I see recognition in a slightly different way. Recognition connects me to the needy and helps me to reach out to them.”\n\nInventiveness:\n\nAmong his innovations are the remi-recortication machine; areca nut peeler which has found customers in Indonesia and Ethiopia; cassava peeler which has been bought in Kenya, pomegranate de-seeder which has been exported to US and Turkey; garlic-peeling machine; tobacco-leaf cutter; paddy thresher; cane-stripping machine; brass utensil polishing machine; safed musli-peeling machine; jatropha de-seeder; mechanised weeding machine; passion fruit juice extractor; trench digger and a chopper for cattle and fisheries feed. He also designed a stevia pulveriser; multipurpose herbal dyer and passion fruit gel extractor.\n\nWith our very limited resources, we always strive to bring new things to you and, thus, for the first time on the internet, we bring you a short introduction to various spring festivals of Northeast India in one article. We are not above mistakes and, thus, if anyone notices any errors in terms of the information provided, kindly do write to us and we will rectify the same.\n\nSpring festivals of Northeast India\n\nVarious groups of people belonging to different castes and tribes constitute what is known as the Northeast India and make it extremely rich in terms of arts and culture. There are more than 75 tribes and clans who speak more than 400 languages and dialects in this region. Although all the seven states of Manipur, Mizoram, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura and Arunachal are politically defined as separate states (Sikkim forming the eighth state now), despite the vast diversity, there some common cultural threads of unity that knit together the diversity. Maybe, that is why the seven states are known as seven sisters and Sikkim is called the brother.\n\nNortheast India, blessed with nature’s bounty, becomes moist and beautiful with the advent of spring. Along with the advent of the New Year, this also marks the onset of the agricultural season. That is why this is the period when festivals and celebrations engulf the entire region. Although some start their celebrations a bit early and others start a bit late, the atmosphere and weather remains the same and also the purpose of celebrating are quite similar. It is observed that in some festivals the way of conducting them are also similar.\n\nThe agricultural festival celebrated in Assam to welcome the spring is known as Bihu. Irrespective of caste, creed, language and religion this is a festival that is revered among all and it can be called the state festival of Assam. Along with the Aryan people in Assam, the Tai, Bodo, Chutia (Tibeto-Burman), Austric, tea tribes and migrant Muslims also celebrate the festival with such fervour and gaiety that it even transcends the barrier of religion. By doing this, it is able to unite people irrespective of religious differences. Merriment, songs and dance, dresses and ornaments, musical instruments and different cuisines make it the most colourful festival of Assam. Bihu begins in the middle of the months of Sot and Bohag (mid-April). Bihu continues for seven days starting from the day of Dumahi and under the names of Goru Bihu, Manuh Bihu, Saat Bihu, Senehi Bihu, Maiki Bihu, Rongali Bihu and Chera Bihu. The day before Dumahi is called Uruka. The start and end of the festival differs according to the community and place. The tribes of Bodos, Deuris, Lalungs (tiwa), Rabha, Mising, Dimasa, Tai, Garo and others also celebrate spring time festivals like Bihu. The Bodos call it Baisagu, the Deuris call it Bisu, Tais call it Boihu or Bihu, Dimasas call it Bushu, Rabhas call it Baikhu and the Garos call it Rongasugala. Most tribes’ spring festivals, like Bihu, start from the first Wednesday of the month of Bohag, since Wednesday is considered to be a very holy day.\n\nThe Bodos of the Mongoloid origins celebrate the seven day long colourful Baisagu festival. Along with welcoming the New Year, they also start cultivation.\n\nThe Misings celebrate the Ali Aye Ligang festival. The word ‘Ali’ means ‘seeds’, ‘Aye’ means ‘fruits’ and ‘Ligang’ means ‘sowing’. As with many other festivals in Northeast India prayer, dance and feasting are integral parts of the festival. The festival starts on the day of sowing of Aahu (upland rice) and Bau (deep water rice) paddy. Starting on the first day of the month of Fagun (February), the festival continues for five days. Playing the instruments like Dhol, Pepa, Gogana, Borkah, taal, the youth celebrate and perform the Gumrag dance. In order to pray for a prosperous new year, they remember their ancestors and the nature god Donyi Polo (sun and moon).\n\nSimilarly, the Dimasas, celebrate the Bushu festival in the mid of Fagun and Sot month.\n\nRabhas celebrate the Baikhu festival before starting their cultivation in spring. In this festival, they worship the god Baikhu, to make the earth fertile. The Rabha youth sing sathar songs to stimulate nature.\n\nThe Tai Buddhists living in the plains of Assam also celebrate Poiu Chang Ken (the water splashing festival). Tai khamti, Tai Phake, Tai Aiton, Tai Turung and Tai Khamyangs celebrate this festival. In observance of this festival, they perform ablutions on the statue of Buddha after bringing it outside the temples. The youth express joy and celebrate by throwing water and mud on each other.\n\nTribes of Arunachal, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Meghalaya also celebrate spring festivals. The Nocte, Tangsa and Tutsa tribes from the Tirap district of Arunachal Pradesh celebrate a festival called Loku which is celebrated three times in a year. The Loku which they celebrate during spring is called Kap Khut Loku. During this festival they celebrate by consuming the meat of pigs and chicken and sing and dance to the beats of drums, flutes and other musical instruments. During this time, the Tangsa and Tutsas celebrate Loku by singing songs with erotic undertones. These songs are also a means of expressing their emotions. The Wangchos and Konyak tribes of Nagaland also celebrate this kind of festival just before sowing of Aahu dhan in the month of Fagun and Sot (March- April).\n\nChristianity and modernity has greatly influenced the tribes like the Ao, Angami, Lotha, Sema and other major tribes of Nagaland and because of that there is a gradual decrease in the observance of their rites, rituals, festivals and celebrations. But despite these external influences, they have tried to preserve their culture. Tsungrem Mong and Moatsu are two agricultural spring festivals of the Aos. The Angami Nagas celebrate a ten day festival in the month of February called Sekrenyi. The festival is celebrated after harvesting and falls on the 25th day of the Angami month of Kezei. Angamis cut steppes on the sides of the hill to cultivate their crops. In the month of April, they thresh the crops and celebrate the Ngyui festival. The Sema nagas celebrate their spring festival once they hear the voice of the koel bird. Aoling is a 6-day festival observed by the Konyaks after the completion of sowing. It marks the end of the winter, the beginning of spring and the New Year. The Shishu festival of the Rengmas is also a spring time agricultural festival. The Sangtam nagas spring festival, Nyitsumu is also celebrated for three days which has a similarity with the sowing festival of Misings known as Ali Aye Ligang. Nazu is another 10 day long festival celebrated by the Pochury tribe of Nagaland in February prior to the sowing of seeds to bid farewell to the old year and welcome the New Year. The Tanghkhul Nagas also have a sowing festival to celebrate the feel of the spring. Mao, Kobbui and other naga communities also have their spring festivals.\n\nThe Mizos and the Lushais also have the festival of Chapchar where dance and songs take precedence. The Meitis of Manipur also have a festival to welcome the New Year and spring called Soirua.\n\nThe Syiem community of Khasis of Meghalaya also celebrate the Nongkrem festival for five days within the months of May, June and July.\n\nArunachal Pradesh is a melting pot of varied and colourful cultures. Each of the tribes living in Arunachal has their own distinct culture. Monpa, Sherdukpen and other Buddhist communities celebrate Buddha purnima (birthday of Buddha) during spring. The Khamtis and Singhpos also celebrate similar festivals. These festivals are however basically religious festivals. The Mopin festival of the Galo Adis also bears resemblance to the Bohag Bihu of Assam in terms of organization and objective. Adis also celebrate Aam Dorung and Aam Dangdorun festivals with gaiety and merriment. The Mloku festival of Apatanis is also a similar festival.\n\nIn this way, we see that the entire Northeast India celebrates varied and colourful spring festivals. In many of them, similarity of character is seen in terms of welcoming the New Year and their agricultural character. This has helped to foster a spirit of unity in diversity in the culture of this region. Commonness can be seen even in the distinct instruments, clothes, food, ornaments, rituals and rites of the different communities.\n\nA very brief overview of the various festivals of Northeast India is sought to be given here and there is a need for more research and studies regarding this aspect of the culture. In this area fertile with cultural richness, the field of research is still a virgin territory.\n\nTranslated from Assamese by Rupkamal Sarma\n\nPost photo by Arindam Talukdar\n\nLong before scripted drama came into existence; man had started using puppets to convey varied messages. Puppets seem to have existed since time immemorial in civilizations across the globe. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, in Europe, the written records for use of puppets go back to the 5th century B.C. whereas in Asia there are ancient traditions of puppet theatre, the origin of which cannot be determined.\n\nIndia has an ancient tradition of puppet theatre which can be traced back to the time of the civilizations at Harappa and Mohenjodaro.\n\nAlthough there are other types of puppetry in India, string puppetry is common to India and is practiced in the states of Rajasthan, Kerala, Karnataka, West Bengal, Assam, Orissa, Tripura, Manipur, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.\n\nIn Manipur, art and culture are not merely entertainment or decoration but also a form of religious expression given the deep roots of the people in vaishnavism.\n\nTwo types of puppets have been prevalent in Manipur since ages – string and rod. The themes for puppet theatre are mostly based on myths and legends and stories from the epics.\n\nPuppet dance has a separate name of its own in Manipur: Laithibi Jagoi (Laithibi meaning doll and Jagoi meaning dance). The traditional string puppet of Manipur is known as ‘Hang- Lai Jagoi’ and is colourfully dressed and highly stylized.\n\nThe themes of puppets are based on the stories of Radha and Lord Krishna. In Manipur, the puppeteer plays with Mridanga and Khon-Pung. The delivery of dialogues, the movements of the puppet and the musicians are very well synchronized. String puppetry, resembling human or divine figures, is performed at Rasleela, whereas puppet-shows with animal and demonic forms are performed during Gostha Leela.\n\nPuppetry in Manipur and its implementation\n\nIt is said that the art of puppetry was introduced in Manipur during the reign of Maharaj Chandrakriti Singh (1850-1886) in Goura-Leela under the supervision of Oja Ngangbam Mala Singh of Uripok, Imphal. Although, it may be mentioned here that puppet theatre in Manipur is said to be even older than human theatre. According to Late Guru Kongrailatpam Madangopal Sharma of Uripok Tera, Imphal, one of the pioneer puppeteers of Manipur, puppets were used after the Nipa Pala and just before the start of Goura-Leela as pungyeiba (Mridanga player), Tanyeiba (percussion music player) and dancer (puppet dancer) in the Goura-Leela performance. In this way, puppetry in Manipur was first introduced through the Goura-Leela.\n\nThis form of puppet theatre is based on the life and works of Gauranga Mahaprabhu, a passionate devotee of Lord Krishna, who lived in Nadia region of West Bengal. Mahaprabhu, who sang praises of God and propagated Bhakti Yoga, is revered by many Hindus in Bengal and Manipur as a reincarnation of Lord Vishnu.\n\nThere are also records of Shri Ngangbam Udhop Singh, the exponent of modern Manipuri puppetry performing before foreign dignitaries in Calcutta (Kolkata) during the reign of Maharaja Sir Shurachandra Singh (CBE).\n\nThe puppeteers sit on an elevated platform and a black screen is hung from the floor of the platform to the stage where the puppets are put. The puppets are lowered to the stage and moved around with the aid of black strings which are not visible due to the black screen in the background.\n\nToday, with much more flashier modern distractions at hand, it is a struggle to keep puppetry alive in Manipur as Gurumayum Jadu Sharma would say. The founder of the Moppet Decoration and Cultural Centre, Manipur the only puppetry centre in the state, he hopes that future generations would take up puppetry.\n\nIt is with this hope that he has also passed down his skills with the strings to his son, Basanta Sharma.\n\n“It is an expensive art. From making the puppets to organizing the shows, we have to spend money on everything. Financial aid is almost negligible”, says Basanta Sharma.\n\nPuppets tell stories and convey tales. They connect us with a simpler time of the past and carry messages for the present. They are catalysts for social change. If they die, some stories also die along with them and it is stories that keep us alive. Hopefully some concerned people will wake up to the need of preservation of this art form soon before it is too late.\n\nAll photos by the author."
