        "text": "It was a wet summer evening. After completing the day’s desk work I was a little bit tired. But I had an appointment with her, an actress on her own dignity — Moloya Goswami. When I started stepping towards her residence which was close by our office I had all kinds of thoughts in my mind — like I have to face a servant at the door and then he or she would take me in and then call her for the meeting etc. But when I pressed the calling bell at the door I discovered an all together different picture there, Moloya Goswami herself opening the door to welcome me.\n\nOne would no doubt forget about one’s tiredness after interacting with a lady, so hospitable and pleasant by nature. Sitting in her drawing room one can easily feel the grace and modesty of the family and the warmth of the familial bond among the four members of the family. From the famous Rajkhowa family to a famous actress capturing the national award crown for best actress in 1991 for her \"subtle and natural portrayal of a teacher who overcomes the trauma of her personal life and dedicates herself to the pursuit of a noble mission\" in Firingoti Moloya has come a long way. Firingoti is a story of a teacher who faces many odds to spread the light of education in a village. The teacher was none but Moloya herself — the real life teacher of Jagiroad College. This film was directed by Jahnu Barua — whose film career is studded with various Assamese films rooted in Assamese culture and for whom cinema is a powerful medium through which he conveys his message to a large audience. Moloya was fortunate that she got an opportunity to work with such a great film maker and she invested her best and captured the crown.\n\nThe shelves of her drawing room are choc-a-block with framed photographs of her receiving the national award from the President of India and people all over Assam felicitating her for bringing glory to the State. The walls of her drawing room also proudly displays her laurels and achievements. The Axomiya Xarudoiya Japis of all sizes hanging on the walls give enormous pleasure to the eyes of any guest visiting her house.\n\nWearing a simple salwar kameez and without a single trace of make-up on her face, she lost herself in the nostalgic days of her childhood describing them in her own words. The days when they had to go to Sonari, in Sivasagar district and stay at her maternal uncle’s place. She alongwith her sister enjoyed swimming, running and savouring fruits from their grandma’s garden — \"I even today have those days fresh in my mind. Given a chance even today I would like to go to those places to relive those bygone days to their fullest.\"\n\nShe belongs to the famous Rajkhowa family of Sivasagar. Her father was Kailash Rajkhowa, son of Haresh Rajkhowa. He was an engineer of Assam State Electricity Board. He died in December 2001. He was always by her side and guided her to shape her career. But his contribution to Moloya’s acting career was not much because he was not keen on his daughter entering the world of cinema nor did he have enough time to take care of the extra curricular aspirations of his daughters. Her mother Putali Sarma, daughter of Haranath Sarma of Sonari, is still there at her house at Six Mile to enjoy the glory of her daughter and now of her grand daughters...\n\nMoloya was born in Dibrugarh, brought up in Nagaon and ultimately came to settle down in Guwahati. Her father had to move from one place to another because of his transferable job. But Moloya and her sister were kept in Nagaon so that no disturbance could effect their studies. They were only two sisters. Her sister Dipti Buzarbaruah, a teacher, has now started a school of her own.\n\nWith a sweet smile she avoided to mention her date of birth. May be to reiterate the adage that \"never ask a gentleman his salary and a woman her age!\"\n\nHer basic schooling was at Nagaon Basic School, where she completed her primary classes. Then she was admitted into Nagaon Girls’ High School. After matriculation, she came to Guwahati and joined the TC School. She completed her graduation from Handique Girls’ College and obtained a master’s degree in Education from Gauhati University.\n\n\"Though I was a mediocre student, I was loved by my teachers. Recently, I went to Nagaon to attend a meeting there, when my teachers noticed me there, they hugged me with great affection. Such incidents prove that the teachers are not partial to brilliant students only, they also love those who are sincere and toil to uphold their principles.\"\n\nToday, Moloya is a college teacher, an actress and a mother. She is allotting equal importance to all these roles — not more to one, not less to another. After the completion of her master’s degree she got an opportunity to render her service even before the results were announced, in the Sonari College against a leave vacancy. After working for two months there she returned to Guwahati. In 1983 she was called to join the Jagiroad College as a lecturer and she continues there till today.\n\nMoloya started her conjugal life in 1981 with Pradip Goswami, an executive engineer of Assam State Electricity Board and a source of great inspiration to her. It was only her husband who let her hug the opportunity that was forwarded by Dr Bhabendranath Saikia. This couple has two daughters — Nishita and Nimisha. Elder Nishita has already become a familiar face in the Axomiya filmdom and Nimisha the younger daughter is a cute Higher Secondary first year student. Moloya’s husband Pradip is in fact a very good friend of her and always helps her giving her company as much as he can.\n\nIt is only because of Pradip’s cooperation that she is able to shuttle between her various activities. When most of the Bollywood actresses have had to cut off their bond with celluloid after marriage, Moloya is undoubtedly lucky as she started her film career only after her marriage.\n\nInterestingly, most people may not know that Moloya was selected for the first women’s hockey team from Assam. She participated in various games in her school and college days. She reveals her attachment to games with a smile recollecting how she was trained by Joginder Singh (Olympian) for playing for the first women’s hockey team of the State. But her love for games was not confined to any one game in particular. Her involvement shifted from one game to another — \"that may be the reason for which I could not make myself a good player,\" she laments.\n\nHer fondness for acting grew early from her school days. \"In school level I could show my performance in the first play of my life. That was a play by Aarati Das Boiragi which was performed for the silver jubilee celebration of the school. In Handique College, during the college week, the girls from the department of Philosophy decided to perform a play and I also expressed my willingness to act in it but they were philosophy students and I was from education stream and you know what kind of sentiments play during college weeks. They asked me not to mind if I was not taken in,\" remembers Moloya. But luck was on Moloya’s side and the Philosophy students fell short of artistes to perform in the play and they were forced to request Moloya to play the role.\n\nBudhin Sarma, a noted actor of his times, then lived in Uzan Bazar. The students reached him to learn the nitty-gritties of stage play. Budhin Sarma, at the very first sight asked Moloya if she had done any performance before. She answered in the negative, Sarma then asked the girls if they would mind if he made any changes in the play. They said they wouldn’t.\n\nAfter making some changes he gave the main role of the play to Moloya. Moloya bagged the best actress crown for this play Ekei Uttar. The same team performed the same play the next year also and Moloya once again won the best actress award. After that she continued her journey and performed her full-fledged drama Upekkhita Mallika by courtesy of New Arts’ Players. The rendering was a translation of Mohan Rakesh’s Aachar Ka Ek Din.\n\nShe got various opportunities from noted film-makers of Assam — Satyaprasad Baruah, Sambhu Gupta and many others, but she could not accept those because her father could not spend much of his time for this avocation of hers.\n\nThe real talent of this modest and determined actress, were ultimately invented by Dr Bhabendranath Saikia. When Dr Saikia decided to make a film based on his novel Antareep he released an advertisement. In the meantime, Moloya had read the novel which was serialized in the Assamese weekly Prantik and she was very much impressed by the character of Menaka — determination that she nurtured after so many odds she had to face in the long run of her strife torn life.\n\nAnyway, when she saw the advertisement she said she would also send an application. But the thought remained a thought only. She had done nothing in practice. She was then at Nagaon. Bhabendranath Saikia approached her husband with the proposal that Moloya should play the role of Menaka in his film Agnisnan. Her husband immediately consented to the proposal and Dr Saikia then met Moloya at Nagaon. After discussing with her husband she also gave her consent to the proposal. Thus Saikia’s journey to invent a new melange of talents began. It was quite an interesting story how Dr Saikia trained her to act the role. He first let her read the novel Antareep once again so that she could be accustomed to the character and with its manifestation. And then she was given the script.\n\nMoloya was a bit distressed when she learnt that she missed her first laurel by a hair’s breath. Agnisnan slipped from winning a prize for one little flaw. But her investment saw a large rip off when she won the national award for best actress.\n\nBut Moloya would be happiest if she could capture this crown before five years and she says, \"If I could win this laurel for my debut making film Agnisnan the impact would have been really a different one.\"\n\nAfter these two films she never had to look back. Though her academic life is not allowing her to earmark much time to films, her film career is studded with jewels like Agnisnan, Firingoti, I killed him Sir, Sesh Upahar, Asene Kunuba Hiyat, Priya o Priya, Konikar Ramdhenu, Tumiye Mor Kalpanar and Ipar Hipar etc. Apart from films she has also acted in TV serials, notable among them being Ritu Ahe Ritu Jay and Jibanar Batat.\n\n\"I have also got an opportunity to play a role in the famous TV serial Tejal Ghora but I could not because of some unavoidable circumstances for which I feel sorry and unlucky because after this I did not got any more chance to work with Kulada Kumar Bhattacharjee.\"\n\nMost of the times the reel life cuts people from their real life friends and relatives. Moloya is no exception. She is not in touch with her close friends except a very few. One of her such friends is Minati Choudhury who is a lecturer in Dudhnoi College with whom Moloya shares her feelings whenever she gets the time to do so. Another friend is there whom Moloya met last a few years back. \"I used to call her ‘Juu’. Though her name is Anjana Choudhury. She is a close friend of mine and I will be very happy if this message goes to her through your m�lange, because I don’t know where exactly she lives now.\"\n\nAfter such a busy schedule can she take out time for her husband and daughters? \"I try my best to spent as much time as possible with my family but don’t know how far I am successful in my venture.\"\n\nBesides acting, teaching and cooking for her family (in fact Moloya never liked cooking but compulsion made her a good cook) she spends time for the betterment of the common masses. Yes, Moloya Goswami is a social activist too.\n\nHer feelings for the people of Jagiroad is deep and she feels that she has much obligations towards the people there. She is engaged with a ladies organization which was started by Raju Baruah. The organization, under the banner of ARPITA, aims at taking the womenfolk out of bondage — specially those women who are toiling with household works only. She is also involved in the activities of the AIDS Control Society and with an NGO — ESCAPE. I must also mention that she is a member of Censor Board. In her academic pursuits she intends to complete her PhD in the near future.\n\nFrom famous Rajkhowa family to the world of Axomiya filmdom, Moloya has come across a long way but her down to earth approach, modesty and genuine nature are still there in her way of life. She has a deep faith in the new generation and she does not believe that Assamese film is losing its identity on account of commercialization and says that it is necessary to give a commercial tinge to Assamese films to make them popular.\n\nMoloya also wants to produce films in the coming days. She has already staged an experimental play Iti Tumar at Rabindra Bhavan during the Phani Sarma Memorial Drama Festival recently which was much applauded by the audience and critics. It should be mentioned here that Moloya Goswami is a good reciter too who likes to recite poems by Jyoti Prasad Agarwalla and Navakanta Barua.\n\nSipping the cup of tea served by her daughter Nimisha, I wanted to know from Moloya her likes and dislikes. When I asked her abut her negative traits she let the answer come from her family members. And the answer came in chorus — \"Whenever she gets angry she repeats her dialogues again and again...\" \"Please don’t assume that I do all these outside also,\" Moloya explained with a smile to make the position clear. When I asked her about her positive traits, she said, \"I leave it to you to decide.\" And I in turn, leave it to my readers, after having gone through this tale, to decide what’s so positive about Moloya."
