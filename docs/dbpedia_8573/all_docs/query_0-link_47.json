        "text": "The Natasurya Memorial Celebration Committee, a socio-cultural organisation of Assam, was established in 1996 to promote Assamese Theatre in alignment with the national theatre movement; and to work for communal harmony in the North Eastern Region, particularly in the area of ethnic unity and goodwill. Keeping these objectives before it, the Committee has so far published 11 books of significance for the lovers of art and culture, felicitated 55 authors, playwrights and artistes of eminence; and produced and staged 32 theatre productions.\n\nBesides these, the Committee has been successfully holding an annual weeklong Theatre Festival since its establishment. The Department of Cultural Affairs, Government of Assam patronises this Festival which takes place every year from 31st July to 6th August. While this festival brings to the forefront the dramatic productions of the state, it also invites outstanding theatre personalities from mainland India to stage their plays in the state for the benefit of the theatre lovers here. Due to this initiative some famous theatre personalities like Nadira Babbar, Makrand Deshpande, Naseeruddin Shah and Ratna Pathak staged their dramas in Guwahati in 2005, 2006 and 2007 respectively. Keeping the trend of the previous years’ performances afresh in people’s mind, this year the Committee has invited SAHAJ Group of Mumbai headed by Mr. Rajendra Gupta. The group will perform two acclaimed plays in Guwahati. This year, another outstanding attraction is going to be actor Neena Gupta’s performance in these plays. Among local directors whose plays will be staged during the festival are many famed names such as Moloya Goswami, Swapnanil Baruah, Sakunti Bordoloi, Abdul Mazid, Simanta Phukan, Pranjal Saikia, Anup Hazarika, Uzzala Barman and Giyas Uddin Ahmed.\n\nConsidering the positive impact of this festival on the creative arts scenario of the state, Airtel is extending its support to this seven day drama festival.\n\nMr Sudipto Chowdhury, COO, Bharti Airtel Limited NESA, stated, “Side by side with providing the best telecom services to our customers, we in Airtel are committed to contribute our resources for all round development of the society. With this objective in view, we have been promoting arts, culture, literature, environment awareness and sports in the region. We have been associated with the theatre movement in Assam for quite some time and this time, our association with the Natasurya Drama Festival will surely help the theatre movement of the state and delight the theatre lovers who will be able to witness some of the best performances of our times.”\n\nMr Giyas Uddin Ahmed, General Secretary, Natasurya Memorial Celebration Committee said,”Theatre is a very popular art form and pastime of the people of Assam but shortage of funds is standing in the way for furthering the cause of theatre. Airtel has come forward to support our efforts which have injected a new lease of life to the movement. I hope that Airtel’s example is emulated by other corporate houses operating in the region.”"
