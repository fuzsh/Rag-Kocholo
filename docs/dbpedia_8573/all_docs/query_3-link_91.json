        "text": "The census followed a certain methodology to arrive at these findings. It defined “Mother tongue” in the following words: “Mother tongue is the language spoken in childhood by the person’s mother to the person. If the mother died in infancy, the language mainly spoken in the person’s home in childhood will be the mother tongue. In the case of infants and deaf mutes, the language usually spoken by the mother should be recorded. In case of doubt, the language mainly spoken in the household may be recorded.”\n\nIn the questionnaire given to assess the mother tongues of Indians and consequently the number of speakers of each of them, respondents were made to feel free to return the name of their mother tongue and the same was recorded faithfully by the enumerator. This led to the recording of a very large number of mother-tongue names from all over India—a total of 19569. These were then subjected to thorough linguistic scrutiny, edit and rationalization. This resulted in the researchers arriving at the total number of 121 languages.\n\nTwo major tribal languages that are included in the Eighth Schedule such as Bodo and Santali have also shown declines though not negative growth. The number of Bodo speakers in Assam declined to 4.53 per cent of the total population in 2011 from 4.86 per cent in 2001. It shows a total decadal percentage increase of 9.81. Santali shows a total decadal percentage increase of 13.89.\n\nReflecting on the findings, Ayesha Kidwai of the Centre for Linguistics, School of Language, Literature and Culture Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi told Down To Earth: “Language censuses in India cannot return accurate findings because of the methodology. That is because reporting one’s mother tongue is not about actual use but a political act. At the same time, if there has been negative growth of these tribal languages as the findings show, I would not be very surprised either. It could be the phenomenon known in linguistics as “Language Shift”. Although India is not a monolingual society, there is a growing prevalence of a few regional languages. Languages in India are not just about communication, identity and culture but also about chances. Speakers of a small and not very well-known language may see economic reward and upward mobility in shifting towards a dominant tongue. Moreover, our national linguistic policy does not encourage the use of many such languages and for users to report the use.”\n\nShe added: “Tribal languages are a treasure trove of knowledge about a region’s flora, fauna and medicinal plants. Usually, this information is passed from generation to generation. However, when a language declines, that knowledge system is completely gone. With the loss of language comes the loss of everything in a culture and loss of solidarity, the loss of Man himself.”"
