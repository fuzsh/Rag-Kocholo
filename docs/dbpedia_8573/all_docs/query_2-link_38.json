        "text": "Success does not come without any pain and without any effort. The route to success is paved by certain essential elements which includes hard work, proper planning, time management and the ability to adjust to things and situations. Hence, success is not a simple and straight goal and it cannot be imagined to be achieved just so easily. There is nothing wrong in dreaming to be successful, but together with that one will also have to know what he must do to turn this dream into a reality. In that case, it is the success story of the noted and proficient education consultants that can work like a beam of light in the dark and students can most often refer to the guidance an success quotes by the consultants to get inspired and find a path to success in their life.\n\nThere are no two opinions that it is too tough to find the noted consultants and it is the educational events, mostly, that can help one on spotting the education consultants and approach them for guidance and assistance. Education event management Guwahati holds annual education fairs in the city which turns out to be a major meeting joint for the students, educational institutes and the educational consultants from across the country and the world. Attending such Assam and North East education events will definitely help the students in coming closer to the noted consultants and get their issues solved.\n\nThe success quotes always work like a magical force in lighting up the mind and in boosting the spirit. Here are some of those that works great when it comes to chasing success-\n\nSwami Vivekananda had once said- “Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life–think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.”\n\nAnother quote states- “Always bear in mind that your own resolution to success is more important than any other one thing.”\n\n“Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.”\n\nThe Assam education system is rich in its curriculum design and in its course material which is well capable of guiding and leading its students towards success. In that case, there can be no point for a student educated in Assam to not dream and not become a successful person in his life. There are many instances of noted personalities who have been educated in Assam and started their educational career in Assam and today they are noted personalities in both national and international platforms. There are instances of Assamese people educated in Assam and going to places which include late Bhupen Hazarika, Jahnu Baruah, Moloya Goswami, late Bhebendra Nath Saikia, late Jyoti Prasad Agarwala, Manju Bora, late Pramathesh Barua, Arnab Goswami, Angaraag Mahanta, Jubin Garg, Khagen Mahanta, Tarali Sarma and so on.\n\nBy approaching the Education exhibitions Guwahati organized by the Assam event planner, one can make it sure that he receives the best educational guidance and the very basic knowledge that is needed for marching on the path to success.\n\nVisit http://www.lynchpinindia.com for education fair and career consultancy.\n\nEducation after and before the 10th standard can be named as the two sides of the coin. Both play a crucial role in building the future of a student and at the same time, both cannot be separated from each other. Just like the student is not ready for his future studies until and unless he do not complete his education till 10th, similarly, the education after class X too is significant because only on the basis of this educational qualification, a student develops himself as an eligible candidate for his future career. Hence, one needs to be particularly careful while choosing the career and the course after passing the 10th standard.\n\nIt is just a very basic and normal process for a student to take admission in the school and continue his education till class 10. But what after that? One will have to make his mind as to what he wants to pursue for his future career and as there are three streams, namely, ART, Science and Commerce, a student will have to be sure as to which stream he wants to take up. Such confusing moments are a must to come in a student’s life and such situations of dilemma can be better handled if Assam and North East education events are being visited. Such events use to have proper guidance programmes and discussion sessions with the students which makes it just very easy for a student to realize what his interest is and which course he should go for.\n\nAssam education has a variety of options for its students and one can chose from a wide array of courses to opt for his future prospects.

Earlier on, one had to think about moving to an out of Assam institute just to pursue the degree of his dreams but things are not so today. The Education event management Guwaha has made it sure that students can find which college specializes in which study and when and how to approach these.\n\nThere use to be a number of educational stalls with consultants to guide the student in picking the right course in the right college. Moreover, relaxations in terms of the course fee too are tried to be provided to the students so that the economically weak students too can get hold of their dream.

There is no doubt that one can think of easily pursuing higher studies and take up a subject that he wants, but the question is whether the institute he has chosen is apt for him and whether the subject he has taken up will be helpful for him in the future. So, many such factors are there that needs to be answered and guided to the students so that they do not take a wrong step in proceeding for taking admission in colleges. This is why; there are consultancies and professional guides in Lynchpin to guide the student basing on his traits and then show him the right path to take up.\n\nWhen it is about taking admission in a particular college, which has a reputation in campus placements and in building the career of the students then it is necessary for the student and his parents to seek assistance of the professional consultants.

To be precise, this is a medium of promoting higher education and encouraging more students to pursue education on a higher level in well-known institutes. An educational fair may be aiming at facilitating students of a particular stream and course or may be organized universally for all students and all courses.\n\nThe best thing about the education exhibitions Guwahati is that it brings together all best and popular institutes under one roof so that the students can check out the prospects and features offered by the institutes right in one place and find it easy to zero in one option.

Especially in a culture as rich as ours, education, whether formal or informal, has run in the country for millennials through numerous generations altogether. And having been at the center of learning since the age of gods, through vedas and upanishads, there is conclusive proof about the same. Choosing the right education, to follow your passion and guide your dreams becomes an integral part of shaping your career, as a profession and your life, as a human being. With the right kind of choices and the right kind of choices, guidance and counseling from absolute professionals who have been in this industry for a long, long time could be advantageous to the student. And this is where and exactly why many students fail to reach the mark and get left behind in the never-ending rat race.\n\nHowever, the other most important part of our appeal is that, the students who are home-grown here in the north-east region of India, who are sprouting with talent to aspire and achieve, most often lose focus because of bad career/education guidance and hence are lost to the jaws of society in other parts of the world where they go to seek what they do not get. As a fact, a surprisingly large number of students from the north and north-east go out and spread across the lengths and breadths of the country for education. They mostly miss out on opportunities that are right next to them, but are blurred to see the truth right in front of their eyes. Statistically speaking, we Indians spend about $7 billion, which is a whopping number by itself, annually to study and fund their education abroad.\n\nLynchpin, which has been a pioneer and a premiere career and education fair organizer has been working incessantly to make sure that the students get the right kind of exposure and information to decide what, where, why and how to study.

Also, practice communication skills every day in different settings that range from your social to professional life.
