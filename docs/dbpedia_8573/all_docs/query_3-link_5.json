        "text": "The most common languages spoken in North East India are Bengali, Assamese, Mizo, and Manipuri. The majority of these languages have a distinct, yet similar, gender system. However, there are some significant differences in the way these languages express gender. For example, some languages are completely gender-neutral, whereas others are more strongly gender-inclusive.\n\nBengali\n\nBengali is one of the most commonly spoken languages in the North East region of India. Its vocabulary is composed mostly of native words and a small proportion of words borrowed from other languages. Many of the words in the language have a Middle Eastern origin and were influenced by languages such as Arabic and Persian. In addition, some grammatical forms are borrowed from Turkic and Persian languages.\n\nBengali is the second most commonly spoken language in the country after Hindi and is spoken by 8% of the population. It is primarily spoken in the eastern states of West Bengal, Assam, and Tripura. It is also spoken in many countries outside of India. In terms of number of native speakers, it is one of the most widespread languages in the world.\n\nThe script for Bengali is similar to the Assamese script, but it differs in a few ways. For example, the letter s is pronounced differently than that in Hindi or English. The letter s in Bengali retains a voiceless alveolar sibilant sound when it appears in certain consonant conjuncts.\n\nA simple Bengali sentence is structured in a subject-object-verb pattern. The verb comes first, and then a negative particle follows it. The language also recognizes six cases and two numbers. There are six forms for first, second, and third persons. It also has both ordinary and honorific referents.\n\nAlthough Bengali is not the official language of India, it is recognized as a regional language in several states. In fact, the national anthem of India was originally written in Bengali by Nobel Prize winner Rabindranath Tagore. Later, Abid Ali translated the lyrics into Hindi and Urdu. The national anthems of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were also composed in Bengali.\n\nAnother Sino-Tibetan language spoken by the Borok people of Tripura is Kokborok. This language belongs to the same language family as Bhramaputran. It is a minority language and is spoken by more than 830,846 people in both India and Bangladesh.\n\nAsamese\n\nThe Assamese language is spoken in the state of Assam and in the neighbouring states of Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland. It is a modern language but has many historical roots. The Assamese script is a descendant of the Kamarupi script that was used by the early peoples of Assam. Its modern form is closely related to the Mithilakshar script of the Maithili language and the Bengali script. In addition to the modern script, the Assamese language also has its own manuscript writing system on palm leaf and bark. The spelling of the language is not phonetic, but is a combination of the Assamese and Bengali scripts.\n\nAssamese is one of the most commonly spoken languages in North East India, with around sixteen million speakers. The North East region is among the most linguistically diverse regions of the country, with around 200 languages spoken by the population. Although this is less than 8% of India’s total population, it is still one of the largest areas for the diversity of spoken languages in the country. Most of the language spoken in the region is related to Indo-European languages, while the Tai-Kadai and Tibeto-Burman languages are also represented.\n\nIn addition to Asamese, Tamil is spoken in a small percentage of the region. Tamil is spoken in the district of Moreh in Manipur and is a minority language in Assam. Assamese is the official language of the State of Assam.\n\nThe region is made up of seven sister states, or border-line states. Each has its own mythology and lore. As a result, the region is best described as misty. In addition to its diversity in language, it is also rich in culture and tradition.\n\nAssam has a vibrant linguistic diaspora. It is also home to many indigenous tribes.\n\nMizo\n\nThe Mizo are a trans-border people who inhabit the North East Indian states of Mizoram, Manipur, and Assam. They also live in the northern and southern Chin states of Burma, as well as the south-eastern hills of Bangladesh. Other tribal groups in the region hold high regard for the Mizo, who are well-known for their achievements in education and armed struggle for the creation of the state of Mizoram. They are also well-qualified for the Indian Administrative services and are highly skilled in hymn singing.\n\nMizo is part of the Kuki branch of the Tibeto-Burman family and is spoken by around 700,000 people in Mizoram State, Chin State, and the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh. There are currently 843,750 Mizo speakers worldwide. Its dialects include the Lukhai, Lusai, and Lushai.\n\nMizo is one of the most common languages in the region. It is the official language of Manipur, North East India. It has an estimated 1.6 million speakers. Like Manipuri and Assamese, it is a member of the Tibeto-Burman family and is closely related to the Sanskrit language.\n\nMizo has many polysyllables and a high percentage of monosyllables. Most of them are compound words, and the first syllable is often de-stressed over time. An example is the compound word nuntheihna, which consists of the letters nung and theih, and means possibility. It also has a nominalising suffix.\n\nThe Mizo language is spoken by the Biate, Khelma, and Onaeme communities in north-east India. This language has a long and diverse history, but it is currently under-represented in the national dialogue. However, it is a vital part of the Indian cultural landscape and is worth exploring.\n\nThe North East of India has an enormous diversity of languages and cultures. The region is home to more than 200 languages. The region is home to a large indigenous population. The languages of the region are mainly of Indo-European, Tibeto-Burman, Austro-Asiatic, and Tai-Kadai origin.\n\nIn terms of numbers, the Mizo language is spoken by 1.6 million people in Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland. It is part of the Sino-Tibetan language family. It is also closely related to Bengali, the official language of Sikkim and Manipur.\n\nManipuri\n\nThe Manipuri language is a highly regional language that is spoken in the state of Manipur, Assam and Nagaland. It belongs to the Kuki-Chin family of Sino-Tibetan languages. It is one of the 23 official languages of India.\n\nThe language shares many features with its neighboring languages. For example, it has many morphological features of Tibeto-Burman languages, including three positional occurrences of velar nasals, widespread stem homophony, and morphological suppletion. In addition, Manipuri has a limited prefixation and extensive suffixation.\n\nA rich literary tradition has been produced in the Manipuri language. The literature includes poetry, novels, and books. There are a number of famous Manipuri writers, including H. Guno Singh and Pacha Meiti. Moreover, there are many cultural festivals in the state.\n\nManipur is a beautiful state that resembles Switzerland in natural beauty. It is home to diverse flora and fauna, and its people are peaceful and hospitable. If you plan to visit this state, make sure to learn the language. The official map of the state can help you get around and find things in Manipur.\n\nThe language is one of the most widely spoken in the region, with approximately 16 million speakers in the region. There are more than 200 dialects in North East India, with the majority belonging to the Indo-European and Tibeto-Burman families. A small number of languages belong to the Tai-Kadai language family.\n\nThe Northeast region of India is home to many national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. The Namdapha flying squirrel and the one-horned rhino are also popular in the region. The region also boasts the world’s largest floating national park, Keibul Lamjao National Park. Floating islands and water plants are common in the state of Manipur. In addition to flora and fauna, the region is home to the Shirui lily. Another language in North East India is Nepali. There are approximately 2.9 million speakers in the state of Sikkim, the Darjeeling Sadar subdivision, and the Kalimpong district of West Bengal. The language is the second most widely spoken language in Nepal."
