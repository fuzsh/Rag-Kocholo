        "text": "GUWAHATI, Dec 1 - Along with the rest of the world, the Assam State AIDS Control Society (ASACS) observed the World AIDS Day today with a gamut of activities.\n\nThe central function was organised at the Sri Sri Madhabdev International Auditorium of the Srimanta Sankaradeva Kalakshetra here. A rally from the ASACS premises was also taken out on the occasion. The rally was flagged off by actor Ravi Sarma and climber Henry David Teron who scaled Mt Everest.\n\nThe theme of this year�s World AIDS Day is �Increasing Impact through Transparency, Accountability, and Partnerships�.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, ASACS Project Director Varnali Deka said, �World AIDS Day gives an opportunity to people to unite in the fight against HIV and show support for people living with HIV.�\n\nShe said though Assam falls under low prevalence category (0.06 pc) when compared to the national average (0.26), the State is highly vulnerable to new infections as it is the gateway to all the Northeastern States. Assam is surrounded by three high prevalence States of Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram, apart from the fact that there is a constant flow of truckers and migrants into the State from other parts of the country.\n\nDeka further said Assam is the first State in India to launch HIV intervention in prisons and correctional homes for women.\n\nSamir Kumar Sinha, Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department, Government of Assam, said, �Apart from the clinical support, people living with HIV require absolute mental support.�\n\nSinha put stress on raising the level of awareness among people by involving various organisations which are willing to work in the field of HIV/AIDS.\n\nMovie celebrities Kopil Bora and Moloya Goswami also spoke on the occasion.\n\nDr A Adhikari, Principal of Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, spoke on the significance of blood donation and expressed hope that more and more people will come forward for blood donation.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kamrup District Legal Services Authority in association with Divine Hand Welfare Organisation celebrated the Day with a free health check-up camp held on the campus of BRM Govt Law College, Panjabari, today."
