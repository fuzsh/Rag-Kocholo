        "text": "Have been tagged by www.flickr.com/photos/sarahnarayan\n\nUntil now, I use to cherish the very thought of not being tagged. Not going through the process.\n\nBut, wind has changed its course -\n\n1) A Capricorn. Pretty cool and chilled out and a very reserved person. I am not a social person and I guard my privacy. Am very practical and straight forward person. I call a Spade a Spade; what else will you call it then ;). Let me share a scret - I am a very great Bathroom Singer and waiting for a break. Unfortunately, no one is willing to give me a chance. The world is missing a great talent here. Am an insomniac as well.\n\n2) My first love and crush(ed) - When I was 5 or 6 years old, cupid struck me. Damn! its been years and I have never been able to recall her name. We were in the same class and usd to sit together. Was love sharpening pencils for her or was love doing her Maths homework. Was love sharing our lunch boxes or was love correcting her spellings. Buoy! I am feeling nostalgic. Though she was fat but very cute. Yes, she was my first love and first crush. And at an early age I relocated to another city, and sweet dream got over.\n\n3) I am not a Sitcom person. Apart from the business news, I love cartoons. He-Man (they don't play it anymore) and Tom & Jerry are al time favorites. I used to get so inspired by the He-Man cartoons, that in school we (guys) used to fight (in full desi style) and those losers used to complain to our school principal. My Mom infact had to come to school everyday, not to see me off but to listen to the principal complaining. And you wouldn't believe the Ordeal I had to undergo; I was banned from watching He-Man, Spider Man, Super Man, and Phantom cartoons. Damn that principal. But I used to sneak in and watch those. I am a very toned down guy now though. The only sitcom I ever liked and still like is \"The Wonder Years\"\n\n4) I am a die hard Foodie but do not experiment much with my food. Love anything and everything from my Mom's, Sister's, and Sister-in-law's kitchen. Samosa (an Indian snack) is my all time favorite. I can eat it 365 days a year. Its Bill Gates favorite Snack as well. Apart from Samosas, its Pasta time. I don't know to cook. My belief is; if everyone starts to cook, who will eat. And yes, I can't dine alone. Well! now you know whom to reach out. ;)\n\n5) Shattered dreams - When in School, I wanted to get either in Defence or Intelligence. My dream got shattered when sometime in High School, my eye sight became weak and I started using glasses. Then I decided to become Criminal Lawyer, but the novice criminal lawyer in me didn't knew the last date of the forms. I then took shelter in a business management programme.\n\n6) I am with an Enterprising bent of mind. With no enterprising activity, my life has no motto. To quench this thirst I ended my career and I carry the tag of a failed venture and began my career again. But have helped many of my friends in setting up their enterprises and they have been doing well. After my first stint, I had and keep coming with varied business plans bit none on te execution side. One day, I shall see the sun rise. We fall and we rise again.\n\n7) Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and Prashant Adukia (this name sounds familiar) are the people in the world of business I follow. And yes Sachin Tendulkar and Roger Federer, they are GOD. And Steffi Graf.\n\n8) Godfather is my all time favorite movie. Am a big fan of Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore (just love her), Michael Douglas, and Marlon Brando. Back home its Hrithik Roshan and Preity Zinta. Though I do not watch too many movies.\n\n9) My brush with photography was pretty accidental. One night I just made up my mind to take photography, it then became a hobby and now a passion.\n\n9) I am a game addict. First it was the video games, then the ones' playing on your desktop (Age of Empires still ranks the best), PS2, and now PSP. I have infact kept my PSP away from vicinity so as to avoid myself getting hooked to it. And yes, I also got hooked to DS until due to the faulty socket, the screen lost its colors.\n\n10) I follow Wall Street, Dalal Street (Indian Wall Street), and the Photography Street.\n\nFinally, I made it and thanks for reading it through.\n\nI would like to thank you all for your constant feedback for me to improve my work. Have made some great friends through Flickr. Its really amazing. Thanks again!\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nAbhishek Bachchan (born 5 February 1976) is an Indian film actor, producer and occasional playback singer.\n\nBachchan made his acting debut in the drama film Refugee (2000). After earning little praise for his roles in a series of commercially unsuccessful films, he starred in the action thriller Dhoom (2004), a box office hit and the first film in the popular Dhoom series.[1] Bachchan received critical acclaim for supporting role in Yuva (2004), and starred in commercially successful films like Bunty Aur Babli (2005), Sarkar (2005), Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006) and Guru (2007).[2] He also starred in Dhoom 2 (2006), Dostana (2008), Paa (2009), Bol Bachchan (2012), Dhoom 3 (2013) and Happy New Year (2014).[2] He produced Paa along with Sunil Manchanda which won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi.\n\nMarried to actress and former Miss World Aishwarya Rai, Bachchan comes from an illustrious Bollywood family.[3][4] His father Amitabh Bachchan is a leading actor in Hindi cinema and his mother Jaya Bhaduri Bachchan is a former leading actress.[5]\n\nAbhishek Bachchan was born on 5th February, 1976. His grandfather, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, was a poet of Hindi literature and professor at the Allahabad University in Uttar Pradesh. The original surname of his family is Srivastava, Bachchan being the pen name used by his grandfather. However, when Amitabh entered films, he did so under his father's pen name. Bachchan is of Kayastha heritage on his father's side,[6] Bengali from his mother's side[7] and Punjabi from his grandmother's side.[8] Time magazine listed Amitabh Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai on its list of most influential Indians.[9][10]\n\nBachchan was dyslexic as a child; this was referred to by Aamir Khan in the film Taare Zameen Par.[11] He attended Jamnabai Narsee School and Bombay Scottish School in Mumbai, Modern School, Vasant Vihar, New Delhi, and Aiglon College in Switzerland.[12] He then attended Boston University, but dropped out.[13][14]\n\nCareer[edit]\n\nFilm debut and initial struggle (2000-2003)[edit]\n\nIn 2000, Bachchan made his film debut playing the male lead in J. P. Dutta's war drama Refugee opposite Kareena Kapoor, who was also making her debut in the film. Although the film did not fare very well at the box office, both Bachchan and Kapoor received positive reviews for their performances. Film critic Taran Adarsh wrote that he \"has all it takes to emerge a competent actor in years to come. Even in his debut-making film, Abhishek comes across as a fine actor and lives up to his family name.\"[15]\n\nAfter Refugee, Bachchan starred in a series of poorly received films that failed to make a mark at the box office. However, his performance in Sooraj R. Barjatya's romantic dramedy Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon (2003) earned him his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor, and he went on to win the award the following year for his performance in Mani Ratnam's political drama Yuva (2004).\n\nWidespread success (2004-2008)[edit]\n\nBachchan better established himself in Hindi cinema playing a no-nonsense Mumbai police officer in the blockbuster action thriller Dhoom (2004), which also starred Uday Chopra, John Abraham, Esha Deol, and Rimi Sen in pivotal roles. His next two films were Phir Milenge (2004) and Naach (2004), neither of which performed very well at the box office.\n\nBachchan's first release of 2005 was the crime comedy Bunty Aur Babli, which featured him and Rani Mukerji as the titular con artist duo who perform several successful heists and fall in love along the way. The film emerged as the second highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2005, and earned him a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. This film also marked his first professional collaboration with his father Amitabh Bachchan, who played a police officer closely following the lead pair.\n\nBachchan was next seen in Ram Gopal Varma's political drama Sarkar, which was a moderate success at the box office. His performance as the morally upright son of a troubled politician (played by his father) earned him rave reviews from critics as well as his second consecutive Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. His next two releases Dus (2005) and Bluffmaster! (2005) were both moderately successful, but did not earn much critical appreciation.\n\nBachchan won his third consecutive Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Karan Johar's critically acclaimed romantic drama Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), which emerged as a moderate commercial success despite the fact that it dealt with the controversial subject of marital infidelity. Bachchan played the role of a man whose wife (Rani Mukerji) is unhappy with their marriage, and so begins an affair with a friend (Shahrukh Khan) who is also unhappy with his marriage to his wife (Preity Zinta).\n\nBachchan then starred opposite Aishwarya Rai in the period romance Umrao Jaan, a remake of the 1981 film of the same name starring Rekha and Farooq Sheikh in the lead roles. The film failed to earn the same level of appreciation as the original, and was also a commercial failure. He was next seen in Dhoom 2 (2006), which featured him and Uday Chopra reprising their roles from the original Dhoom (2004) joined by new cast members Hrithik Roshan, Aishwarya Rai, and Bipasha Basu. The film emerged as the highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2006, but some critics commented that Bachchan was \"reduced to a mere supporting player\"[16] to his co-star Roshan.\n\nBachchan earned much critical acclaim for his performance in Mani Ratnam's Guru (2007), loosely based on the life of business magnate Dhirubhai Ambani. Film critic Raja Sen wrote that “Abhishek Bachchan owns the movie... [He] forces himself under the skin of the character, and from gait to accent, proves constantly credible.”[17] The film starred him alongside Aishwarya Rai Bachchan (making the film their first collaboration after their marriage), R. Madhavan, Mithun Chakraborty, Vidya Balan, and Arya Babbar.\n\nHis next release was the dance comedy Jhoom Barabar Jhoom (2007) alongside Preity Zinta, Bobby Deol, and Lara Dutta. Although the film failed at the Indian box office, it was a moderate success overseas. He was then seen playing a minor role in the female-centric drama Laaga Chunari Mein Daag (2007) as the love interest of the film's lead actress Rani Mukerji.\n\nBachchan's first release of 2008 was Ram Gopal Varma's Sarkar Raj, which featured him and his father reprising their roles from Sarkar (2005) while his wife Aishwarya Rai Bachchan entered the cast as a new addition. This film proved to be a major success at the box office, and earned him a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. His next release was the fantasy adventure film Drona (2008), which was a major failure both critically and commercially.\n\nBachchan was next seen in Dostana (2008), a romantic comedy about two men (Bachchan and John Abraham) who pretend to be gay in order to be allowed to live with a girl (Priyanka Chopra), but then find that they have both fallen in love with her. John Abraham overshadowed Bachchan in this film with his power packed performance.The film was a major success at the box office, and earned him a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor.\n\nBachchan's first release of 2009 was Delhi-6, which received a lukewarm response from critics. Later that year he was seen in the family dramedy Paa, which he also produced. The film's plot centered on a boy (Amitabh Bachchan) suffering from progeria as well as his relationships with his father (Bachchan) and his mother (Vidya Balan). For his work as a producer on the film, Bachchan earned the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi.\n\nBrief setback and recent success (2010-present)[edit]\n\nBachchan experienced a brief setback in his career[18] with five films that failed critically and commercially. These films were the thriller Raavan (2010), the social drama Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey (2010), the action thriller Game (2011), the crime drama Dum Maaro Dum (2011), and the heist thriller Players (2012).\n\nBachchan then played supporting role alongside Ajay Devgan, Asin, and Prachi Desai in Rohit Shetty's comedy Bol Bachchan (2012), which was a major blockbuster at the box office despite receiving mixed reviews from critics. Film critic Anupama Chopra called Bachchan a \"good part of the film\" and also commented that he \"manages to sparkle even in a script that is lazy and determinedly lowbrow\".[19]\n\nBachchan then appeared in Dhoom 3 (2013). Like Dhoom 2 (2006), he and Uday Chopra were the only cast members reprising their roles. In this installment of the series, they were joined by Aamir Khan and Katrina Kaif. While the film became a major blockbuster and currently ranks as the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all-time, most critics commented that Bachchan was a good supporting actor in Dhoom 3. Bachchan also starred in Farah Khan's Happy New Year, a musical heist film which featured an ensemble cast of Shahrukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, Sonu Sood, Boman Irani, Vivaan Shah and Jackie Shroff. Shahrukh Khan's stellar performance was hailed by the audience. Bachchan had a double role in the film as Nandu Bhide, a street loafer and Vikki Grover, the son of a business tycoon. Critics praised his comic timings and acting and felt that he was a good supporting actor.\n\nUpcoming projects[edit]\n\nHe is filming for the romantic drama All Is Well opposite Asin, which was initially set to release in December 2014 but has now been delayed as cabinet minister Smriti Irani, who plays a vital role in the film has not been able to allocate any dates since the Indian general elections 2014. He has also signed on to star with Akshay Kumar and Riteish Deshmukh as the three male leads of Housefull 3, the sequel to Housefull (2010) and Housefull 2 (2012). This installment is to be directed by Sajid-Farhad and produced by Sajid Nadiadwala.[20]\n\nSports ventures[edit]\n\nAbhishek Bachchan bought the Pro Kabaddi League franchise team Jaipur Pink Panthers[21][22] and co-bought the Indian Super League football team Chennaiyin FC.[23] in 2014. Jaipur Pink Panthers won the first ever championships held in 2014.[24]\n\nOther work[edit]\n\nIn 2005, he was a part of Tamil director Mani Ratnam's stage show, Netru, Indru, Naalai, an event which sought to raise funds for The Banyan, a voluntary organisation which rehabilitates homeless women with mental illness in Chennai.[25]\n\nIn the summer of 2008, Bachchan, his wife, his father, and actors Preity Zinta, Riteish Deshmukh, and Madhuri Dixit starred in the \"Unforgettable World Tour\" stage production. The first leg covered the USA, Canada, Trinidad, and London. Bachchan is also involved in the functional and administrative operations of his father's company, originally known as ABCL, and renamed as AB Corp. Ltd. That company, along with Wizcraft International Entertainment Pvt. Ltd., developed the Unforgettable production.[26]\n\nIn 2011, Bachchan has promoted awareness of drug abuse in India as part of a citizen education campaign. The actor launched the Awareness Day race, which celebrated the silver jubilee of the country's Narcotics Control Bureau.[27][28]\n\nBrand ambassador[edit]\n\nBachchan has been brand ambassador for products like LG Home appliances,[29] American Express credit cards,[30] Videocon DTH,[31] Motorola mobiles,[32] Ford Fiesta[33] and Idea mobiles.[34]\n\nIn 2009, Abhishek Bachchan was announced the winner of the 'Best Brand Ambassador of the Year' award at the NDTV Techlife Awards 2009.[35]\n\nAdEx India,a division of TAM Media Research conducted a study on celebrity brand endorsements for the period of Jan–Dec 2010 in which Abhishek Bachchan eats the pie with a 4.7% share ad volume out of the 41.5% film actors on the endorsement circuit.[36][37]\n\nAbhishek Bachchan became the brand ambassador for TTK Prestige, part of the TTK Group in October 2013 [38] along with his wife Aishwarya Rai Bachchan.\n\nIn 2014, he became the brand ambassador for the END7 campaign of the Global Network for Neglected Tropical Diseases. The goal of the campaign is to eradicate seven different tropical diseases by 2020.[39]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n\nBachchan with his wife Aishwarya Rai, 2013.\n\nIn October 2002, at his father Amitabh Bachchan's 60th birthday celebration, Abhishek and actress Karisma Kapoor announced their engagement.[40] The engagement was called off in January 2003. Bachchan fell in love with Aishwarya Rai, who is two years older than him, whilst filming for Dhoom 2,[41] though both of them had already appeared together in Dhai Akshar Prem Ke (in which her then longtime boyfriend, Salman Khan, made a brief cameo) and Kuch Naa Kaho. Bachchan and Rai announced their engagement on 14 January 2007 later confirmed by his father, Amitabh Bachchan.[42][43] The couple was married on 20 April 2007, according to traditional Hindu rituals of the Bunt community, to which Rai belongs. The wedding took place in a private ceremony at the Bachchan residence, Prateeksha, in Juhu, Mumbai,[44] but was heavily covered by the entertainment media. The couple appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in September 2009,[45] and were described as more famous than Brangelina.[46] They have been described as a supercouple in the Indian media.[47][48] Rai gave birth to a baby girl on 16 November 2011.[49][50] Her daughter became quite popular by the name of \"Beti B\" which was named by the fans and the media, since the couple took over four months to name their daughter. The baby girl was finally named as Aaradhya Bachchan in March 2012.[51]\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Bachchan\n\nWhen I first came to Bandra in the 80 s I was provided full fledged company accommodation so I spent time at Waterfield Road for sometime and than I was moved to another sprawling place at Linking Road called Aradhna close to Mr Rajesh Khannas office .\n\nThan bought my own place at Danpada ..The riots 93 changed everything became a nomad in my own city living at various safe houses in Juhu rented houses at Pali Naka and Ranwar ...of all the places our stay at Ranwar was the best we moved out when Preity Zinta moved in ..\n\nWe finally came to stay at 21 De Monte House our first own house at Bandra and the germs of loving Bandra began to grow a d its been ten years staying in our next home at Bandra Reclamation.\n\nAnd Bandra keeps growing on me the Bazar and all the bylanes of Chapel Road Waroda Road that I pass by on my walks ...I am 're discovering the beauty of Bandra and Bandra has to be felt deep inside your soul ...Bandra is an emotion fulfilling the peace within Bandra is my prayer it keeps my family blessed ...Bandra has not made me overtly Muslim simply in the way I think ..I am happy with my faith perhaps not as indomitable as yours I keep away from Mosques ..I find my God where I want to find him .\n\nI am not come here to preach I have come here to do my time and go away ..I do not want to be you at all keep your religion your faith I can't walk your path perhaps my destination is not the Heaven where you will continue with your sexual gratifications nubile virgins are not for I will be happy to leave my heart my eyes my liver ticking away in another man's body ..yes i am a beliver of God and man I am happy in my heresy it leads me to the doors of my inner peace I could not be an atheist but I am happy of what is on my plate I think dear friend my 3 hour walk for me is a catharsis unlike your prayer .\n\nYou don't feed or clothe me you don't take care of my family we are happy and we wish your happiness too ...take care .\n\nHappy Morning ...your words have given me the strength to walk from Bandra to Juhu to prove my point though my legs are hurting like mad\n\n..I shall pray as I walk for over 4 hours or more ."
