Communication Today, 23(3), 132-143. MLA- Shahin, Shabnam, and Ankuran Dutta. \"Portrayal of Muliebrity in Assamese Cinema: A Semiotic Analysis of the Films of Dr. Bhabendra Nath Saikia.\" Communication Today, vol. 23, no. 3, Sept. 2019, pp. 132-143.] Dr. Bhabendra Nath Saikia is a noted film maker of modern India, who has a special style of portraying femininity in his films. In most of the films by Dr. Bhabendra Nath Saikia, there are a few prominent characters, but still the female characters in the selected films stand out as strong role model of muliebrity as well as woman empowerment. This study is an attempt to understand the role portrayed by each of the female characters in the selected film of Dr. Bhabendra Nath Saikia with the help of semiotic analysis. How each character though different from each other, under different circumstances abiding by the norms of the society portrays strong stand out roles and depicts true meaning of empowerment. Dr. Saikia’s three films “Sandhya Raag”, “Agnisnan” and “Kolahol” are taken as the subject for this study. The study is based on the idea that these films which were made in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s had such strong and bold women characters and how well has Dr. Bhabendra Nath Saikia being able to uphold these characters through his cinematic creations. Content analysis of the selected films and the semiotic analysis of the characters are being done for the data analysis purpose of the study."
