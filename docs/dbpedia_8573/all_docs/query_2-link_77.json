        "text": "Humans established relations with food with their existence on earth. In various parts of the world, different types of vegetation are used as food material. Chhattisgarh, where numbers of tribes exist and used a leafy portion of various plants as a food material. The present study evaluated the total protein, total carbohydrate, and total free amino acid content in leafy vegetables used in Chhattisgarh. Total protein was estimated by Lowry method, while total carbohydrate and free amino acid content by Anthrone method and spectrophotometric method. The result showed highest protein contained in Tamarindus indica (103.98 ± 2.34 µg/mg) followed by Moringa olerifera (99.86 ± 2.32 µg/mg), Cicer arietinum (95.53 ± 2.78 µg/mg). The highest carbohydrate content was observed in the leaf of Amaranthus viridis (116.26 ± 2.33 µg/mg of plant tissue) followed by Marsilea vestita with carbohydrate content (82.35 ± 1.55 µg/mg), Chorchorus olitorius with carbohydrate content (50.46 ± 2.23 µg/mg), and highest free amino acid content was recorded in the leaves of (232.33 ± 2.05 µg/mg of plant tissue) followed by Brassica oleracea (204.94 ± 1.25 µg/mg), Cucurbita maxima (85.67 ± 2.35 µg/mg). The study's finding confirmed that wild leafy vegetables utilized by the special community of this area play a significant role in their livelihood as those vegetables contain higher nutrient level compared to conventional crops. As per the data reported, more than one million people of this region suffer from malnutrition so present study is an approach to overcome the health issue of people of this region in a sustainable manner.\n\nCereal grains, legumes and pulses have a vast contribution towards S ri Lankan diet fulfilling the dietary requirements of the community. This research is mainly focusing on determining the macronutrient composition of major cereals, legumes and pulses commonly consumed in local cuisine. White S amba, White Basmati, Red Kekulu and Nadu rice were selected as the main rice varieties and in addition maize, and finger millet flour-based food were analyzed under cereals and related products. Under legume category Red cowpea, green gram, chickpea and vegetable soya bean were taken as the most consumed beans in S ri Lanka while lentils were analyzed as the most preferred pulse in local cuisine. Particularly in S ri Lanka, for every main meal, people consume rice with few curries in which rice accounts roughly two third of the dish. Lentils and soya curry ought to be two of the most popular curries among locals. Moreover, bread has become the second most preferred food next to rice and usua...\n\nhttps://www.ijert.org/analysis-of-macronutrients-calcium-magnesium-and-trace-elements-iron-zinc-in-common-edible-indian-foods https://www.ijert.org/research/analysis-of-macronutrients-calcium-magnesium-and-trace-elements-iron-zinc-in-common-edible-indian-foods-IJERTV5IS020421.pdf Commonly available Indian foods containing rich sources of macronutrients (Ca and Mg) and trace elements (Fe and Zn). Dietary intake of these foods will reduce the diseases like prematurity, Rickets, Renal disease, Anemia, Hyperkalemia, Anuria, Tissue damage etc,. The aim of the present work is to determine the amount and percentage of macronutrients Calcium, Magnesium and trace elements Iron, Zinc in various food samples. The results showed that cashew nut, ground nut and spinach contains maximum amount of Calcium, Magnesium, Iron and Zinc in the range of 0.031 gL-1 , 0.091 gL-1 , 0.2458 gL-1 and 0.0408 gL-1 respectively, it measured from more than fifteen different types of juices extracted from common edible locally available foods in and around Tholayavattam area Kanyakumari district, Tamilnadu, India."
