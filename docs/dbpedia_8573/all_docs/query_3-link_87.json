        "text": "Hindi - the National Language of India?\n\nYeah I know, I have taken to writing again after a very long time. But here is an important issue on hand and I just could not stop myself from blogging on this! Hindi - is this the national language of India? Well, in short the answer is No. Let me tell you the story behind this. Till 1965, Articles 343 and 345 of the Constitution of India specified that the official language of India to be Hindi in Devanagari script, though states of India were free to adopt one or more local languages for all or any of the official purposes of that state.
