He was instrumental in the production of the first Assamese Film “Joymati”, under the banner of Critrakala Movietone. Due to the lack of trained technicians, Jyotiprasad, while making his maiden film, had to shoulder the added responsibilities as the script writer, producer, director, choreographer, editor, set and costume designer, lyricist and music director. The film, completed with a budget of Rupees Sixty thousand and was released on March 10th, 1935. The picture failed miserably. It is unfortunate that like so many early Indian films , the negatives and complete prints of Joymati are missing.\n\nNot withstanding the failure of his venture, Jyotiprasad made another film after a lapse of two years titled “Indramalati(1939)”. It was his second and last film. The eminent composer and singer of Assam Dr. Bhupen Hazarika, played a stellar role in the play. With the passing away of Jyotiprasad, the Assamese film scene witnessed a temporary lull for about a couple of years. But things changed with the onset of war, Taking advantage of this, the Late Rohini Kr. Baruah made a film on a relevant historical topic called “Manomati (1941)”. It was followed by films like Parvati Baruah's Rupahi (1946), Kamal Narayan choudhury's Badan Barphukan (1947), Phani Sharma's Sjiraj, Asit Sen's Biplabi, Prabin Phukan's Parghat Suresh Goswami's Runumi etc. Runumi (1952)\n\nBut the most remarkable film of the fifties was Piyali Phukan which went on to win a National award. In 1955, a new talent Nip Barua made his directorial debut with Smrit Paras. His subsequent films Mak Aaru Moram and Ranga Police bagged many state awards and the silver medal at the national level. Dr. Bhupen Hazarika also produced and directed his first film Era Batur Sur. Prabhat Mukherjee made a film on the universality of mother-hood, Puberan (1959).,which was shown in The Berlin Film Festival. The next memorable production was Lachit Borphukan by Sarbeswar Chakraborty. Dr. Bhupen Hazarika made his unforgettable musical lore Shakuntala (1961) which proved equally successful with critics and the press. It also won president's silver medal. Following this, a chain of films went into regular production and got released which included Nip Barua's Narakasur, Anil Choudhury's Matri Swarga, Brojen Barua's Itu Setu Bahuto and Mukta & Anwar Hussain's Tejmala.\n\nBy the middle of the sixties, film were produced in Assam on a regular basis. It should also be mentioned here that between 1935 ad to 1970 a total of 62 films were produced. Besides the film makers already referred to, many others engaged in film making during the period included Pravin Sharma, Saila Barua, Abdul Mazid, Amar Pathak, Indu Kalpa Hazarika, Diben Barua, Debkumar Basu, Amulya Manna, Gauri Barman, Atul Bardoloi, Sujit Singh, Nalin Duara and Prafulla Barua.\n\nDuring the period of 1970-82 a total of 57 Assamese films were made. New directors started emerging on the horizon. Samarendra Narayan Deb's Aranya (1970), Kamal Choudhury's Bhaity (1972) the first colour film of Assam, Manoranjan Sur's Uttaran (1973), Deuti Barua's Bristi (1974) Pulok Gogoi Khoj (1974) Padam Barua's Ganga Chilanir Pakhi (1976) and Dr. Bhabendranath Saikia's Sandhya Rag (1977) and Atul Bordoloi's Kollol (1978) are films worth - mentioning.\n\nThe outstanding directors of contemporary Assamese Cinema are Jahnu Baruah (Aparoopa, Papori, Haladhia Choraye Baodhan Khai, Banani, Firingoti, Hkhagoroloi Bohu Door) ; Sanjeev Hazarika (Haladhar, Meemanxa); Bhabendaranatha Saikia (Anirbaan, Agnisnaan, Sarothi, Kolahol, Abartan, Itihaas, Kaal Sandhya) Dr. Santwana Bordoloi (Adajya) and Bidyut Chakraborty (Rag Birag). Their Films have won National & International Awards\n\nIndian Film History :\n\nAs India was poised for a socio-political upheaval at the turn of the 20th century, a new form of entertainment arrived in India- the cinema. This art form which made a humble beginning went on to make a mighty bang and sophisticated multi-million-rupee movies of the present day are a far cry from the soundless short films that made a silent entry into the Indian hearts in its early phase. Be it as an art form, a social weapon or a political satire, the cinema has made a tremendous impact on the Indian society as few other forms of art have.\n\nThe first exposure to motion pictures which India received was in 1896, when Lumiere Brother's Cinematographe unveiled six soundless short films at Bomay's Watson Hotel. And the first exposing of celluloid in camera by an Indian (Harishchandra Bhatvadekar), and its subsequent screening took place in 1899.\n\nDuring the first decade of 20th century, only silent short films were made in India. It was during the first half of the next decade that the first indegenous feature film Raja Harishchandra was made by D.G. Phalke (1913). By 1920, film production had grown into a regular industry bringing out silent films in various Indian languages.\n\nIndian Cinema made a big leap forward with the arrival of Alam Ara, the first talkie feature film by Ardeshir Irani in march 1931. It was during the Thirties that attempts were made to produce talkie films in different languages. Regional culture and the craving to see and hear a film in ones own mother tongue caused a mushrooming of film industries in all major centres. The fore runners were Bengali, Tamil, Telegu followed by Marathi, Kannada, Malayalam, Gujrati, Oriya, Assamese and several languages in later years: every regional cinema came up with its own directors and artists; regional film also took to earth and realism, winning many awards and honours in India and abroad in the process.\n\nThe 1930s\n\nNumber of films released: 2\n\nThe origin of Assamese Cinema can be traced back to the dreams and imagination of a revolutionary visionary Rupkonwar Jyotiprasad Agarwala, who was also a distinguished poet, playwright, composer and freedom fighter. He was instrumental in the production of the first Assamese Film Joymati in 1935, under the banner of Critrakala Movietone.\n\nDue to the lack of trained technicians, Jyotiprasad, while making his maiden film, had to shoulder the added responsibilities as the script writer, producer, director, choreographer, editor, set and costume designer, lyricist and music director. The film, completed with a budget of 60,000 rupees was released on March 10, 1935.\n\nThe picture failed miserably.\n\nIt is unfortunate that like so many early Indian films , the negatives and complete prints of Joymati are missing. Some effort has been made privately by Altaf Mazid to restore and sub-title whatever is left of the prints.\n\nDespite the significant financial loss from Joymati the second picture Indramalati was filmed between 1937 and 1938 finally released in 1939.\n\nRemaining strong in the face of adversity, Agarwala made another film after a lapse of two years titled Indramalati. It was his second and last film.\n\nThe 1940s\n\nNumber of films produced: 5\n\nThe eminent composer and singer of Assam Bhupen Hazarika, played a stellar role in the play. With the passing away of Jyotiprasad, the Assamese film scene witnessed a temporary lull for about a couple of years.\n\nBut things changed with the onset of World War II, Taking advantage of this, Rohini Kr. Baruah made a film on a relevant historical topic called Manomati in 1941.\n\nAll Assamese films made in the 1940s\n\n1941 Monumati dir: Rohini Kumar Baruah\n\n1944 Rupahi dir: Parbati Prasad Baruah\n\n1947 Badan Borphukon dir: Kamal Narayan Choudhury\n\n1948 Siraj dir: Kamal Narayan Choudhury\n\n1949 Parghat dir: Prabin Phukan\n\nThe 1950s\n\nNumber of films produced: 19\n\nThe most remarkable film of the fifties was Piyali Phukan which went on to win a National award. In 1955, a new talent Nip Barua made his directorial debut with Smrit Paras. His subsequent films Mak Aaru Moram and Ranga Police bagged many state awards and the silver medal at the national level. Bhupen Hazarika also produced and directed his first film Era Bator Sur. Prabhat Mukherjee made a film on the universality of mother-hood, Puberan (1959),which was shown in The Berlin Film Festival.\n\nThe mid-1950s saw the emergence of composer-singer Bhupen Hazarika as a filmmaker too, with his directorial debut Era Bator Sur (Tunes from the Deserted Path) showcasing the musical genius in him. He went on to make films like Pratidhwani, Lotighoti and Chikmik Bijuli, each different in genre and thus reflecting Hazarika’s versatility. The talent of the 1950s was Gyanada Kakati whose role in Puberun brought her critical recognition. She was first seen in Parghat (1949) and also acted in Ronga Police\n\nProminent films and their awards\n\n1955: Piyoli Phukan (writer and director Phani Sarma/ Rupjyoti Production): Awarded a Certificate of Merit at the 3rd National Film Awards. It was the first Assamese or north-eastern film to get a national award. This was the landmark film that not only put Assamese cinema on the national map, it brought technical sophistication to Assamese cinema. The acting in the film was as good as in the rest of the country. It was the twelfth film ever made in Assamese.\n\n1957: Mak aru Maram (Mother’s love) dir: Nip Barua/ Certificate of Merit at the National Film Awards,\n\n1958: Ronga Police (Red Police) dir Nip Barua, the President’s Silver Medal: the first Assamese film to get such a high national prize;\n\n1959: Puberun (The Eastern Sun) (language: Assamese) dir Prabhat Mukherjee (who had a respected position in the Bengali film-industry), the second Assamese film to get the President’s Silver Medal + selected for the Berlin International Film Festival.

The film’s starcast included Balraj Sahni, who was an A-lister in Hindi-Urdu art cinema and a well-paid character artiste in commercial cinema. Era Bator Sur was a commercial success.\n\nDirector Prabhat Mukherjee came over from Bengal's by-then internationally reputed film industry.\n\nThis influx of all-India talent continued into the 1960s.\n\nMohammad Rafi, Kishore Kumar, Manna Dey, Asha Bhosle, Talat Mahmood, Suman Kalyanpur and Usha Mangeshkar, all sang in Asamese films, and not only under Hazarika’s baton. Four Hazarika films in the 1960s used singers of all-India fame, but so did, say, Bhaity.\n\nThe 1960s\n\nThe next notable film production was Lachit Borphukan by Sarbeswar Chakraborty. Bhupen Hazarika made his unforgettable musical Shakuntala in 1961 which proved equally successful with critics and the press winning the president's silver medal. Following this, a chain of films went into regular production and got released which included Nip Barua's Narakasur, Anil Choudhury's Matri Swarga, Brojen Barua's Itu Situ Bahuto and Mukta & Anwar Hussain's Tejimala.\n\nBy the middle of the sixties, film began to be produced in Assam on a regular basis. However, between 1935 and 1970 a total of 62 films were produced.

The film was Ganga Chilanir Pakhi, directed by Padum Barua. Based on a novel by Lakshmi Nandan Bora, the film showcased Barua’s remarkable grasp of the medium, presenting a realistic picture of rural Assam. Unfortunately, it failed at the box office. In 1977, Assamese cinema really caught the attention of the outside world through Sandhyarag of Dr Bhabendra Nath Saikia, a physics professor, novelist and playwright who went on to make seven more films, including Agnisnaan, a powerful women’s rights story fixed in a feudal setting.\n\nThe 1980s\n\nNotable directors of contemporary Assamese Cinema are Jahnu Baruah (who directed Aparoopa, Papori, Haladhia Choraye Baodhan Khai, Banani, Firingoti and Hkhagoroloi Bohu Door); Sanjeev Hazarika (Haladhar, Meemanxa) and Bhabendaranath Saikia who directed Anirbaan, Agnisnaan, Sarothi, Kolahol, Abartan, Itihaas and Kaal Sandhya).

Gogoi has straddled both the world – commercial and art, leaving his own distinctive signature. Much of his early works were experimental and produced on miniscule budgets. He has switched genrestoo, with films as diverse as the offbeat ’Khoj’ (1975) and comic–satiric ’Shrimati Mahimamayee’ (1979), which have achieved a cult status among both film fans and critics. Pulok Gogoi’s painterly eye comes in good measure in the aesthetics of his movie compositions. Most recently, he completed directing a new film titled 'Momtaaj' based on a short story by distinguished literary doyen Sayed Abdul Malik . The film was made under the banner of Sai Films.\n\nThe film is a tale of desperate love and heartbreak between star–crossed lovers Momtaaj and Bedana: Gogoi completed all the works in Guwahati itself for the first time in his movie career. Literary doyen, Sayed Abdul Malik’s works have been a great source of inspiration for Gogoi. In 1993, Pulok Gogoi made the film ’Railor Alir Dubori Bon’ from a short story by Sayed Abdul Malik. It went on to win the Best Film in the regional category at the National Film Awards. ’Momtaaj’ is Pulok Gogoi’s second film based on a short story by Malik after ’Railor Alir Dubori Bon’. He has also made several other serials and telefilms based on Malik’s short stories. ’Momtaaj’ with a length of two hours, features five songs in all. Three of the songs are written by eminent lyricist Narul Haque. Two other songs are written by Gautam Sarma and Palash Gogoi. The songs are rendered by Albela Khanom, Rupam Bhuyan, Rohit Sonar and Aman Ahmed. Music has always been an important ingredient of Pulok Gogoi’s movies. Infact, some of the most everlasting hits in #Assamesefilm are from his movies.\n\nIts heartening to see a veteran director putting in so much hard work to his labor of love despite being grappled with health worries for years now. There’s an attempt being made here to try something different. The cast of artistes in ’Momtaaj’ are Bhargav Das, Ananya Parashar, Abdul Mazid, Jayanta Das, Hiranya Deka, Upakul Bordoloi, Ishaan Hazarika, Mani Bordoloi, Munna Ahmed, Monali Bordoloi, Rehana Ahmed, etc. Cinematography by Pradip Daimary.

Joymoti was The first radical film of India\n\nIn the history of Indian cinema are a few filmmakers who, by virtue of their creative ability, intense labour and extraordinary perseverance, have come to be considered genius. D G Phalke, V Shantaram, Pramathes Barua, Himansu Roy, Ritwik Ghatak, Satyajit Ray are some such figures. Traveling through the little roads of Assam, we find another member of that pantheon: Jyotiprasad Agarwalla (1903-51), one of the greatest cultural figures to have been produced by the state. He made only two films, far less than other filmmakers, yet with his first film alone he could be distinguished as a radical auteur of all India. Nevertheless, he is little known.\n\nJoymoti, released in 1935, added a new chapter in the chronicles of Indian cinema, primarily in the discourse of realism. Further, Jyotiprasad was the only political filmmaker of pre-independent India, though there were many in post-independent India, starting with Ritwik Ghatak. Above all else, Joymoti is a nationalist film in its attempts to create a cultural world using the elements of Assamese society. It is the only work of its kind of that period.\n\nAssam’s freedom fighter-poet-playwright-lyricist-litterateur-and-composer Jyotiprasad Agarwalla, learnt the basics of filmmaking in Berlin’s UFA Studios under Franz Ozten and Himanshu Rai. From a family that had its roots in faraway Rajasthan but had adapted the Assamese culture several generations before him, Jyotiprasad chose the nationalistic tale of Joymoti, a 16th century princess of Assam’s Ahom dynasty who was tortured to death for not revealing the whereabouts of her husband Gadapani, the rightful heir to the throne. It was probably India’s first go at realistic filmmaking, and thanks mainly to lack of venues to screen his film in Assam, the film was an unmitigated financial disaster. Jyotiprasad, in the absence of local talent, had hired Lahore’s Bhopal Chandra Mehta as his cinematographer, and had to carry the responsibilities of being the scriptwriter, producer, director, choreographer, editor, set designer, lyricist and music director of Joymoti.\n\nJyotiprasad’s film was based on the play Joymoti Kunwari by Sahityarathi Lakshminath Bezbaruah, one of Assam’s all-time literary giants, thereby starting a tradition of close links between cinema and literature, something that continues till date. Joymoti was also the maker’s tribute to Gandhiji’s passive resistance movement—a freedom fighter, he was an ardent follower of the Father of the nation. It also had a strong feminist viewpoint, unlike the male-dominated films being made in other parts of the country at that time.\n\nRupahi\n\nThe fourth assamese movie Rupahi, produced & directed by Parbati Prashad Baruah was released in 1946. Screenplay, dialogue lyrics and even the music of the movie was composed by Parbati Prasad Baruah himself.\n\nSiraj\n\nSiraj is another remarkable Assamese Movie- directed by Phani Sarmah. Siraj is the sixth assamese movie released in 1948. The film speaks about the unity among the people of Hindu and Muslim community. Bishnu Rabha and Phani Sarmah, inspired by the story named ‘Siraj’ written by Lakshidhar Sarmah prepared the screenplay and dialogue of the movie. The outdoor shots were taken around Tezpur, the indoors being shot in Kali Film studio, Kolkata. The lead role Siraj was played by Phani Sarmah himself. Music was composed by Bishnu Rabha. Bhupen Hazarika and Shiva Bhattacharyya assisted him.\n\nEra Bator Sur\n\nEra Bator Sur is the first film of Dr. Bhupen Hazarika. The film was released in 1956. Dr. Bhupen Hazarika was then an active member of Indian people’s. Theater Association and in the fifties almost all the workers of I. P. T. A. were influenced by the sorrow and happiness, struggle and hope of the common mass and made themselves associated with creative works related to folk music and culture of the common assamese people. Era Bator Sur was also a result of one such effort. The story and the music of Era Bator Sur reflects the emotional rising of the people of that era. The theme of this movie is based on characters belonging to tea labourers society of Assam. The exploitations carried out by one class of the society also finds importance in the movie. Dr. Bhupen Hazarika is also the music director of the movie. The cast of the movie includes Phani Sarmah, Bishnu Rabha, Balraj Sahni along with Bijoy Shankar, Iva Asau, Tassaduk Yusuf etc.\n\nPuberun\n\nThe first assamese film screened in an international Film Festival is Puberun. Directed by Prabhat Mukherjee of Kolkatta and released in 1959 the film was screened in ‘Berlin Film Festival’, 1960 and bought laurels to the state of Assam. Heroine of the movie Gyanada Kakoti was also present during the screening of the film in Berlil.\n\nThe story is based on mother-child relationship and the truth that every child of this world is equal. Another remarkable feature of this film is that \"Margaret Anderson\" of London Dramatic school acted in this film. In the history of Assamese Cinema this was for the first time that an actress from England, acted in an assamese film.\n\nThe role of the mother was played boldly by Gyanada Kakoti and against her was Tassaduck Yusuf . Music was by Tarikuddin Ahmed . Puberun even won the Presidents Award.\n\nSaknoiya\n\nSaknoiya is the only film directed by Soilo Baruah. The film got released in the month of November, 1959. Story, screenplay and dialogue was written by Durgeswar Barthakur. The indoor shots of this movie took place in Indrapuri Studio, Kolkatta. The editing of this film was also done in Kolkatta.\n\nThe story revolves round the emotions of two brothers, one a taxi driver and another a high official in a government office who marries a lady who would not agree to reside together with a taxi driver. The actors include Gyanada Kakoti, Bina Baruah, Tulsi Das, Sorbeswar Chakravarty, Bina Das, Soilo Baruah, Anil Das, Durgeswar Barthakur, Saityen Choudhury etc. Mukul Baruah was the music director.\n\nDoctor Bezbaruah\n\nBrojen Baruah’s Doctor Bejbaruah released in the year 1960, marked the beginning of success of so called commercial movies in Assamese Film industy. Following the footsteps of Doctor Bejbaruah directors / produces got encouragement to make commercially hit movies in later days of Assamese Cinema.\n\nThough this film laid the base of the commercial value of a movie, yet it put a question mark on making movies based on the simple life of Assamese village folk.\n\nDr. Bezbaruah was the first Assamese thriller movie and also for the first time the outdoor and indoor shooting entirely took place in various locations of Assam.\n\nGonga Silonir Pakhi\n\nগঙা চিলনীৰ পাখি (1976)\n\nRelease Date: 12 March, 1976\n\nProducer: Rupjyoti Films\n\nDirector: Podum Barua\n\nCinematography: Indukalpa Hazarika\n\nMusic: Podum Barua\n\nEditing: Samaresh Bose\n\nStarring: Bina Baruwati, Basanta Saikia, Basanta Duwerah, Asima Saikia, Bina Das Manna, Bhola Kakati\n\nGuest Apprearance: Aideu Handique, Mohini Rajkumari\n\nGonga Silonir Pakhi, directed and produced by Padum Baruah and released in 1976, is one of remarkable assamese movies released till date.

Poor farmers and fishermen of the village are always victim of unabated exploitation by contractor Jamuna Hazarika, a wealthy villager. Radha, an orphan grew up in the family of her...\n\nAssamese Cinema: Glorious past, crisis-ridden present\n\nRupraj Sarmah, June 23, 2012\n\nCelebrating 100 years of Indian Cinema\n\nAssamese Cinema: Glorious past, crisis-ridden present\n\nThe foundation of the film industry in Assam was laid by the pioneering spirit of Jyotiprasad Agarwala. A poet, playwright, composer and freedom fighter, he learnt the art of filmmaking in Germany in the early 1930s.\n\nAgarwala made Assam’s first film, Joymoti, a talkie, in 1935. It was a herculean task because the region had no technicians and equipment. He was a veritable one-man unit, serving as producer, scriptwriter, editor, set and costume designer, lyricist and music director.\n\nThe film’s audiographer made mistakes and the sound recorded on location wasn’t up to scratch. So Agarwala had to step in and dubbed the voices of all the characters. Joymoti cost Rs 60,000. But the film did not get the expected response from the public.\n\nThere were no cinema halls in Assam back then. Agarwala travelled to different localities with a projector to screen Joymoti. Large parts of the negative of the film are missing, but filmmaker Altaf Mazid has made efforts to salvage whatever is left of the original print.\n\nAgarwala’s second and last film, Indramaloti (shot in 1937-1938 and released in 1939) fared much better and fetched him some profits. Bhupen Hazarika, who went on to become Assam’s best-known composer, lyricist and singer, played a stellar role in the film.\n\nAgarwala passed away aged 43. It took Assamese two years to recover from the irreparable loss. In 1941, Rohini Kumar Boruah made a film called Manomati. It was followed by films like Parvati Prasad Boruwa’s Rupohi, Kamal Narayan Choudhury’s Badan Barphukan, Phani Sharma’s Siraj, Asit Sen’s Biplobi, Prabin Phukan’s Paarghat and Suresh Goswami’s ‘Runumi’, all made in the 1940s.\n\nThe 1950s saw several important Assamese films being made – Phani Sharma’s Piyali Phukon, Nip Baruah’s ‘Smritir Parash, Maak aru Morom and Ronga Police, Bhupen Hazarika’s Era Bator Sur, and Prabhat Mukherjee’s Puberun. Hazarika composed the music for Piyali Phukon. Another important development of that decade was emergence of young film director Nip Boruah, who directed many popular films later.\n\nPuberun was shown in the Berlin Film Festival. On the other hand, Piyali Phukon and Maak aru Morom earned a national-level certificate of merit in 1955 and 1957 respectively.\n\nThe period between 1959 and 1969 is generally regarded as the golden age of Assamese cinema. In all 25 films were made during the era and nine of them won National Awards.\n\nIn the 1960s, Sarbeswar Chakraborty’s Lachit Barphukan, Bhupen Hazarika’s musical Sakuntala and Chik Mik Bijulee, Nip Barua’s Narakasur, Anil Choudhury’s Matri Swarga, Brajen Baruah’s Itu Situ Bahuto and Mukuta and Anwar Hossain’s Tejimola were released.\n\nHazarika won the National Award for best music for his work in Abdul Mazid’s Chameli Memsaab, released in 1975. Mazid earned acclaim for subsequent films like Bono Hongso (1977) and Uttarkaal (1990).\n\nFrom 197o to 1982, 57 Assamese films were made. Several promising directors emerged during this period. Samarendra Narayan Deb’s Aranya (1970), Kamal Choudhury’s ‘Bhaitee’ (the first Assamese film in colour made in 1972), Manoranjan Sur’s Parinam (1974), Deuti Baruah’s Bristi (1974), Pulok Gogoi’s Khoj (1974), Padum Barua’s Gonga Silonir Pakhi (1976), Bhabendra Nath Saikia’s Sandhya Raag (1977) and Atul Bordoloi’s ‘Kallol’ (1978) were the notable films that gave Assamese cinema a new prestige.\n\nBhabendranath Saikia triggered a new wave of Assamese films with a socially conscious brand of cinema. An acclaimed writer, he directed a string of outstanding films in the 1970s and 1980s – Sandhya Raag, Anirban, Agnisnan, Sarothi, Kolahal, Abartan, Itihaas and Kaal Sandhya.\n\nAnother Assamese cinema luminary, Jahnu Barua, emerged in the 1980s. With films like Aparoopa, Papori, Halodhia Choraye Baodhan Khay, Bonani, Firingoti and Khagoroloi Bohu Door, he established himself as a globally feted director. Halodhiya Choraye Baodhan Khay won the Best Film National Award in 1987.\n\nOther prominent Assamese filmmakers who subsequently made a mark are Goutam Bora, Sanjeev Hazarika, Bidyut Chakraborty. Santwana Bordoloi, Manju Borah, Jadumoni Dutta and Sanjib Sabhapandit.\n\nGoutam Bora’s Wosobipo, a film in the Karbi language, and Sons of Abotani (a documentary) earned much acclaim. Sanjeev Hazarika’s Holodhor, Santwana Bordoloi’s Adajya, Bidyut Chakraborty’s Rag-Birag, Manju Borah’s Baibhab and Laaj, and Jadumoni Dutta’s Jetuka Pator Dore (2011) are particularly worth mention.\n\nOn the other hand, a crop of commercial films enjoyed a brief run in the 1990s. Joubane Amoni Kore and Hiya Diya Niya were huge hits. The last of such box office success stories was that of Ramdhenu. In the past decades or so, Assamese cinema has struggled to woo the audience back to the theatres.\n\nAll through its history, Assamese cinema has experienced sterile phases. According to film critic and cultural activist Nayan Prasad, innovation is the only way forward. He points out that with the availability of new digital technology, shooting a film is today cheaper than ever before. “We have to adopt new technologies, manage financial resources better and make films with controlled budgets in order to be viable,” says Prasad.\n\nOn the other hand, National award-winning filmmaker Sanjeev Hazarika believes the current crisis in Assamese cinema is actually a part of the greater turmoil that “our society faces as a whole”. He says: “A positive social change is very important for progress in any cultural sphere.”\n\n________________________________________ ________________________________________\n\nThe Firsts of Assamese cinema\n\nSources: Rupali Parda and others\n\nSl.

It originated from the 1930s. This film industry more or less grew simultaneously with the Bengali films.\n\nThe first Assamese film to release was Joymoti by Jyoti Prasad Agarwala in 1935. Jyoti Prasad drew on historical and literary sources to depict the tragic patriotism of a princess produced his first film. Along with this he also portrayed the parallels with the situation of disorder and disharmony unleashed by the British rule on the people of Assam for aligning themselves with the National Movement. The film starred Phanu Barua, Asaideo Handige, Mohini Rajkumari, Phani Sarma, Sneha Chandra Barua, and Shamshul Haque.\n\nHowever, the Assamese audience did not appreciate Agarwala`s film. Although not a commercial success, it is notable that at a time when the Bombay cinema was producing mythological films, Joymoti was about an historical event.\n\nWith the movies of Bhabendra Nath Saikia and Jahnu Barua Assamese films got recognition from the entire nation. Biplabi was a film Directed by Asit Sen in 1948. This film starred Anupama Bhattachrya, Chandra Phukan, Rani Nath and Jagat Bezbaruah. The film dealt with the theme of nationalism and sacrifice. The technical quality of the film set it apart from other films of the genre.\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s the Assamese films that were made did have a lot of flaws. But in the 1950s the scenario altered as far as serious cinema was concerned. Piyali Phukan won the National award. The film was directed by Phani Sharma and the plot revolved around the life of a freedom fighter, Piyali Phukan. It was during these days that the Assamese director Nip Barua made his debut. His first film was Smrit Paras. He later made Assamese movies like Mak Aaru Moram and Ranga Police. These films were felicitated by the State Award of Assam.\n\nIn the year 1955 Era Bator Sur was directed by Bhupen Hazarika. This film starred Phani Sarma, Bishnu Rabha, Bijoy Shankar, Anil Das, and Chhaya Devi. The Assam tea gardens are the setting for this love story: a researcher and a flautist fall in love with the same woman. The researcher steps aside because he believes the flautist`s art to be indispensable. The film focuses on the tea gardens and the folk music of the workers.\n\nBy the middle of the 1960s Assamese films were made on a regular basis. The film industry grew with time. The Assamese movies went onto win numerous national and international awards.\n\nDr Bezbarua was released in the year 1969. It was a crime thriller that starred Nipon Goswami, Brojen Barua, Meghali Devi, Tarun Duara, Ranjana Bordoloi, and Sadhan Hazarika.

It starred Biju Phukan, Gopi Desai, Sushil Goswami, Dulal Roy, Runjun, and Amulya Kakoti. The story depicts a man falsely accused of murder, his dying daughter tended to by his wife, the rape of the wife, the honest policeman stymied by political corruption - a grim story relieved only by the epilogue that speaks of the eventual justice for the accused and the policemen`s promotion. The film was set in the year 1983 during the All-Assam Students` Union turbulence.\n\nSurya Tejor Anya Naam(1991), directed by Dinesh Gogoi, starred Mihir Jyoti Baruah , Alok Nath, Violet Nazir, and Mridul Sutiya. The political turmoil of the state is the subject of this film, the first to clearly deal with the topic.\n\nKonikar Ramdhenu(2003) revolves round the story of an imaginative and intelligent 11 years boy Kukoi. This film executes the horrors that happen in a juvenile home. It is said that the director Jahnu Barua visited 12 juvenile homes before making the film.\n\nAnother important Assamese film Jeevan Baator Logori(2009) was directed by Timothy Das Hanche. This film depicts the journey of a young boy from his student life to the professional life. This film starred Nipon Goswami, Bishnu Kharghoria, Arun Nath, Moloya Goswami, Beauty Baruah and many others.\n\nRecently the film Janmoni(2011) has gained huge popularity.

His exploits in the Indian cinema world are too well-known to be recounted here, but unfortunately, he never made a film in Assamese.\n\nMobile cinema\n\nAaideo Talkies\n\nPrabin Kalita, Assam's travelling talkies give villagers a big-screen experience, June 12, 2017: The Times of India\n\nA mobile cinema company set up by two aspiring filmmakers aims to give the local film industry a boost\n\nLong before movies found a permanent home in theatres and multiplexes, tour ing cinemas were taking them places.\n\nNow, two young graduates from Assam's film institute have revived the concept so that rural audiences who don't have a theatre near them can get a big-screen experience. Not just that. By screening only Assamese movies, they're hoping that the local film industry, which is losing out to competition from Hollywood and Bollywood, gets a shot in the arm.\n\nEquipped with a high-definition 4K projector, a Blu-ray player, a 3KV generator and a 35x25 ft screen, Pappu Kabeer (27) and Ratna Das (33) have been touring the length and breadth of the state for the last few years.Aaideo Talkies, their mobile cinema theatre company, is named after Assam's first woman actor, Aaideo Nilambar Handique, star of the Northeast's first talkie, Joymoti (1935).\n\nMore than 250km from Guwahati, at Bokakhat that lies next to Kaziranga National Park, home of the onehorned rhino, 23-year-old Pranjyoti and his friends are waiting eagerly for Aaideo Talkies to visit their small town this month-end. “Chandrama, the only cinema we had at Bokakhat closed long back. We get to enjoy movies on the big screen only when we travel to Guwahati or Dibrugarh for work or medical treatment,“ says the college student.\n\nWhat triggered the enterprise? Kabeer and Das passed out from Dr Bhupen Hazarika Regional Government Film and Television Institute in 2013, only to find themselves in an industry that was itself struggling to stay afloat.“We were clear-first create the market for local films and then plunge into producing them rather than crying over how Hollywood and Bollywood blockbusters have hijacked our movie buffs,“ says Kabeer.\n\nThey set up their company the same year.It was a struggle initially but soon, a large army of volunteers helped popularise the concept.\n\nIn 2017 since January , they've had about 100 shows, many running to packed houses.\n\nAt Mangaldoi, on the northern banks of the Brahmaputra, near Bhutan border, Manab is an active member of Aaideo Talk ies. When the movie buff is not teaching As samese and social science at a local madras sa, he goes around the villages that dot the rich fertile plains on the foothills of Bhutan hills, advertising the next film.\n\n“It is mostly through word of mouth. The organisers sign an agreement with the villag ers. Sometimes it is for a day and at times for two. Usually three shows are held daily ,“ Manab says. Tickets are priced between Rs 5 and Rs 50.\n\nScreening is indoors wherever an auditorium or a community hall is available, but sometimes a tent has to be erected.\n\nKabeer says they have paid about Rs 3.8 lakh to the producers of the films they exhibit. “We are now planning to produce films in tribal languages because with only Assamese films, our reach is limited to parts of the Brahmapu tra valley ,“ says Kabeer. Their “Mission 5 For Revival“ aims at producing five films, including a children's film, a comedy , and a tribal lan guage film.\n\nThe duo also holds an annual mobile cinema festival. Kabeer and Das are aware that the competition isn't just from Hollywood and Bol lywood but also travelling drama companies which feature top Assamese actors. But young Pranjyoti is sold on cinema. Aaideo Talkies' last trip to Bokakhat was in April -and it was celebration time. “We have a Natya Mandir where the movie Shakira Ahibo Bokul Tolor Bihu Loi (Shakira is coming to Bokultol Bihu) was screened. The show was sold out. Many of us had seen the movie on mobile phones, but watching it on the big screen was simply out of the world. I missed the first few minutes because I was still selling the last of the tickets when the movie started.“\n\nSee also individual articles about\n\nImportant artistes\n\nJyotiprasad Agarwalla\n\nJahnu Baruah\n\nSeema Biswas\n\nParineeta Borthakur\n\nTapan Das\n\nZubeen Garg\n\nMoloya Goswami\n\nDr Bhupen Hazarika\n\nAbdul Mazid\n\nBhabendra Nath Saikia\n\nPranjal Saikia\n\nRunumi (1952)\n\nOther cinemas\n\nAssamese cinema: This page has, at the bottom, links to several other articles in Indpaedia.com related to Assamese cinema.\n\nManipuri Cinema\n\nNorth-Eastern cinema\n\nFor a list all the Assamese films ever made see enajori\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful for the inputs of\n\nNilanjon Gohain\n\nSee also\n\nAssamese cinema\n\nAssamese cinema: 2012\n\nAssamese cinema: 2013"
