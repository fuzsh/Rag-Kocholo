        "text": "Zafri Mudasser Nofil\n\n(New Delhi, Oct 31, 2012) More than 100 villagers are sweating it out everyday to fulfill their most cherished dream — building a road to connect remote areas of Manipur, Assam and Nagaland and have taken to crowd funding to achieve their target before Christmas.\n\nNamdeilung from Manipur’s remote Phoklong village has witnessed 90 summers and now wants to see the 100-km road being completed at the earliest. He has contributed Rs 1,000 from his old-age pension.\n\nNamdeilung wants to see motorcars zoom past this road before seeing his last day.\n\nHe is not the only exception. People living abroad in the US, the UK, Canada and Scotland have also contributed, says Jeremiah Pame, an assistant professor of English at Delhi University, who is taking the initiative of raising funds for the Tamenglong-Haflong Road construction work.\n\nJeremiah’s brother Armstrong, an IAS officer who is the SDO of Tousem sub-division, is supervising the work.\n\n“The 100-km-long road starts from Tamenglong in Manipur and mainly passes through the state’s most backward subdivision Tousem of Manipur. The distance to be constructed is around 100 km. Till now about 75 km has been completed,” Armstrong told PTI over phone from Tousem.\n\nInterestingly no engineer or contractor has been hired for the project.\n\n“We have not hired any labour force. Villagers, including women and teenagers, are willingly volunteering themselves. More than 100 people are working everyday,” he says.\n\nAccording to Jeremiah, work began in full swing from the first week of September.\n\n“Now around 25 km is left. This is most challenging part as all this stretch will be new cutting,” he says, adding till now mostly villagers from Manipur are engaged in the work.\n\n“Once the road cutting work reaches Assam and Nagaland people from there will also chip in,” he says.\n\nThree machines are being used – one bulldozer and two JCB excavators – at the construction site.\n\n“Contractors have given us these machines for use. The only expenditure on these machines is oil. Besides our other expenditure is on food,” says Armstrong.\n\nThe Pame family has given more than Rs 4 lakh for the project. Now, social network site Facebook is also being used to raise funds.\n\n“We have set up collection points in all several cities like Delhi, Shillong, Bangalore, Pune, Chennai, Guwahati and Dimapur,” says Jeremiah.\n\nHe says when this road is done, “we will erect a monolith, on which names of all donors will be engraved so that people will remember their good deeds”.\n\nVillagers are dying to see their dreams turning into reality.\n\n“It is not that the elderly want to travel, but they just wants their children and grandchildren live better life and get proper education. Now they don’t have to stay back in the village, they can all get good education,” says Jeremiah.\n\n(New Delhi, Oct 30, 2012) Actor-director Ananth Mahadevan will pay tribute to Satyajit Ray by adapting a short story of the master filmmaker and megastar Amitabh Bachchan is top on his wish list to play the lead role.\n\n“Golpo Boliye Tarini Khuro” follows the sojourn of a man who after retirement is looking to keep himself engaged and is invited to be a storyteller for a rich businessman.\n\nIt is a piquant situation he finds himself in and Ray springs two magnificent surprises in the narrative, says Mahadevan who was approached with the story by writer friend Tapobrati Das Sammaddar.\n\n“It set my adrenaline pumping. A tribute to Ray was a rare opportunity and after hearing the charming story he had penned, I wrote to (son) Sandip Ray for permissions,” he says.\n\nHe was hoping that Sandip wouldn’t have any reservations.\n\n“After all, it’s better to keep the master’s story confined within the pages of a book rather than let it turn into a wrongly made film. But I guess my track record of 4 National awards for (biopic) ‘Mee Sindhutai Sapkal’ and my penchant for challenging subjects turned the tide in my favour,” Mahadevan told PTI.\n\nSandip was “prompt and gracious in giving me the requisite permission” to film his father’s story.\n\nRight now, Bachchan is top on Mahadevan’s wish list and he has written to him, detailing the project and is waiting to hear from the Big B.\n\n“I am waiting for Mr Bachchan to revert. He had voiced the commentary in Ray’s ‘Shatranj Ke Khiladi’ and I am hoping that he would find this project inspiring enough to be involved with,” the filmmaker says.\n\nThe film will be christened “The Storyteller”. Mahadevan is working on the rest of the cast and crew.\n\n“Paresh Rawal was delighted with the story and evinced keen interest to be part of the film. I am in the process of locking in other names like Sreekar Prasad for edit, Resul Pookutty for sound design and the maestro L Subramaniam for the score.\n\nTarini Khuro or Tarini uncle is a fictional character created by Ray and is central to about 15 stories written by master filmmaker.\n\nZafri Mudasser Nofil\n\n(New Delhi, Oct 28, 2012) India may have seen a revolution in the world of literature, publishing and contemporary art, but government museums continue to be “bleak and boringly displayed spaces” with very poor standards of conservation and display, says writer-historian William Dalrymple.\n\n“The Indian museum world has allowed itself to become frozen into a 1950’s Nehruvian permafrost. It is one of the least changed parts of India’s cultural life. There has been a revolution in the world of literature and publishing, and in the world of contemporary art, but government museums are bleak and boringly displayed spaces with very poor standards of conservation and display,” he laments.\n\n“Indian museums rarely lend to international exhibitions and rarely show the kind of touring exhibitions which form such a major part of the cultural life of other great capitals. It’s a tragic situation,” Dalrymple, who has edited a book titled “Princes and Painters in Mughal Delhi: 1707-1857” along with art historian Yuthika Sharma, told PTI in an interview.\n\nThe book, published by Penguin, was the result of an exhibition in New York which was the billed as the first ever to focus on the art of the later Mughals. The collection examines Mughal artistic culture in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the interwoven nature of Mughal, European and regional patronage.\n\nAccording to Dalrymple, scholars are only now coming to recognise that the work of this period is every bit as interesting and innovative as the art produced under the better-known Great Mughals of the 17th century.\n\n“The exhibition in New York out of which this book emerged aimed to showcase the neglected masterpieces of this period and to give a taste of the extraordinary strength, colour and vivacity of the work produced in the Mughal capital at this time.”\n\nHe took the “Princes and Painters in Mughal Delhi” project thinking it would take a few weeks of work, but in the end it took nearly five years.\n\n“Because scholars are only now coming to recognise that the work of this period is every bit as interesting and innovative as the art produced under Great Mughals on the 17th Century much of it remains in the hands of private collectors, not institutions, and you have to turn into the art historical equivalent of Sherlock Holmes to find out where it is.”\n\nHe says Yuthika Sharma was an inspiration to work with and he “learned a huge amount from her”.\n\nDalrymple feels the best works produced under East India Company patronage – notably the Fraser Album – are unparalleled in Indian art and shows sympathy with the Mughal world quite at odds with stereotypes of colonial philistinism and insensitivity.\n\n“In the course of the 18th century, the British East India Company was transforming itself from a coastal trading organisation into an aggressive colonial government, filling the power vacuum left by the implosion of the Mughal Empire.\n\n“Yet initial contact between these two empires was surprisingly positive in Delhi: the first Company ‘residents’, or ambassadors to the Mughal court, absorbed themselves in its court culture, wore Mughal dress, took Mughal wives, and became important patrons of Mughal painting, transforming the art of the capital in the process.”\n\nBetween 1707 and 1857, Delhi was a hotbed of political intrigue and power struggles – the Mughal Empire was on the decline and the East India Company was emerging as a formidable power. In 1857, these tensions would culminate in the Sepoy Mutiny that led to the end of Mughal dominion and the beginning of the British Raj.\n\nBut this turbulent epoch also witnessed a burst of artistic innovation and experimentation.\n\nDelhi’s artists were increasingly employed by Company officials as well as the Mughal and regional courts, and thus became adept at improvising with a variety of techniques, creating traditional miniatures while continually experimenting with new European styles.\n\nArt historians are only now coming to recognise the richness and ingenuity of the work created in this period.\n\nWith insightful essays by distinguished scholars, “Princes and Painters” is a stunning visual document of 18th- and 19th-century Delhi.\n\n(New Delhi, Oct 28, 2012) Jaya Bachchan’s “strongly individualistic personality” and Dimple Kapadia’s “nomadic and unpredictable nature” made celebrated couturiers Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla represent the two Bollywood actresses as muses in several of their iconic works.\n\nFor many years, Jaya and Dimple wore the clothes six to eight months before any of the designer duo’s collection was released. If Jaya, with her strongly individualistic personality, represented one kind of iconic muse, the other was Dimple. What khadi was to Jaya’s intellectualism and simplicity, zardozi (gold thread embroidery) was to Dimple’s sensuous beauty.\n\nTogether, the designer duo has built a 25-year partnership that has included designing for leading actors and actresses, working with directors on costumes for epic Bollywood films, and building a brand that exudes luxury, artistry and Indian tradition.\n\nThe two met by chance in 1986. Jani was born in Mumbai and started out as a costume designer in the film industry. Khosla was born in Kapurthala and started out in the family leather business. The decision to work together was taken instantly and their first collection, ‘Mata Hari’, arrived just four months later.\n\nTo celebrate their 25th anniversary year, Jani and Khosla have come out with “India Fantastique”, published by Thames & Hudson Ltd., in two volumes – Fashion (Volume I) and Interiors (Volume II).\n\nKnown both for their fashion creations for men and women and for interior design, their reputation extends far beyond India: many international celebrities wear Jani-Khosla creations, among them Dames Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, Sophie Marceau and Sarah Brown.\n\nThe first volume of “India Fantastique” displays dozens of the duo’s impossibly elegant designs created over the past 25 years, including close-ups of exquisitely crafted details. The second volume focuses on their extensive work in interior design. Their hallmark maximalism runs riot in privately commissioned interiors, which incorporate art, artifacts, antiques and vintage textiles.\n\nThe book says that at the apex of Jani-Khosla’s evolution with khadi is their association with Jaya.\n\n“When they first met Jaya in 1987, she was on a hiatus from filmmaking and had created an exhibition of khadi garments with Devika Bhojwani at the Taj Hotel in Mumbai,” the book says.\n\nAs early meetings cemented into longstanding friendship, Jaya became for many the public face of Jani-Khosla.\n\n“She was ready to embrace a new style of dressing,” they recall. It was for her that they made the first 48-panel kurta with 3D zardozi embroidery that dropped near ankle-length, dressing her in it for an appearance at the Berlin Film festival. A seeming contradiction for a short person, this kurta became iconic and widely imitated.\n\nJaya became their lady in white, commonly appearing in Jani-Khosla chikan (whitework) or khadi garments. By extension, the Bachchan family absorbed and reflected this style – part nationalist, part haute couture.\n\nWhen Jani first met Dimple, it was as an anonymous and unsung assistant to Xerxes. He was the bearer of garments for her film “Saagar” (1985) and was struck by her beauty.\n\nRecognising her independence, Jani-Khosla saw her personality as “nomadic and unpredictable, highly visible in her freedom”.\n\nLike Jaya, Dimple had patronised Jani-Khosla in Mata Hari without knowing who they were now she became central to their design fantasy.\n\n“Creating clothes for cinema stars within their roles, and for the social wear, are two different trajectories: the first involves cinematic character, the second individual personality and style. With Dimple, both these categories merge, for she wears their clothes both on screen and off,” the duo writes.\n\n“I started wearing Jani-Khosla around 1986. The entire styling and play of colours is what drew me. Their clothes can make even a regular woman look special. These were the kind of clothes that I would like to wear. This is what I wanted to possess,” says Dimple.\n\nBoth Jaya and Dimple speak of the manner in which the clothes drape and cover the body; their actually feminine feel.\n\n“There is a great sense of grandeur in their garments. There is also a lot of modesty,” says Dimple.\n\nJaya in turn sees this as Jani-Khosla’s humanity and inherent respect for a person.\n\nWithin two decades of their practice, the Jani-Khosla label acquired a legion of admirers, including close friends like actress Amrita Singh, with her highly individual sense of dress, as well as industrialists Lakshmi and Usha Mittal, and the Ambani family.\n\nThe duo’s signature proximity to tradition and culture always attracted Amitabh.\n\n“Their belief in the exotic and unique, unexplored, timeless artwork in their land of birth has been astonishing. Discovering and exploring the myriad range of fine workmanship, and then ensembling it with their own, has been akin to adding ornamentation to melody,” the Big B writes in the foreword.\n\nAn exhibition of the designers’ work was held at Sotheby’s London in September to coincide with the launch of “India Fantastique”.\n\n(New Delhi, Oct 26, 2012) Satyajit Ray had often thought of casting Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan in his films but stepped back apparently due to the actor’s price tag, according to the late director’s wife Bijoya.\n\nJaya Bachchan had “told me in passing that Amitabh would be willing to work with Manik if he ever decided to cast him in any of his Bengali films…,” Bijoya says in the recently-released book “Manik and I”, published by Penguin India.\n\n“He (Satyajit) smiled a little and said ‘Let me get better first–only then can I think of making another film. I’ve thought of Amitabh often but they are such expensive actors. Our Bengal film industry doesn’t have that kind of money'”, Bijoya writes.\n\nJaya immediately said, “Don’t say that–it would be a great honour to work with you. I’m sure he won’t demand that kind of money,” according to Bijoya, whose book is based on her meticulous diary notings till the death of her husband in April, 1992.\n\nThe closest Amitabh came to working with Ray was to lend his baritone voice in the narration of “Shatranj Ke Khiladi”.\n\nRay’s films were characterised by a low budget.\n\nBijoya never felt the urge to write her memoirs, but was finally persuaded to pick up the pen when she was well into her eighties. “Manik and I” brims over with hitherto unknown stories of her life with Ray, told in candid, vivid detail.\n\n(New Delhi, Oct 25, 2012) Janice Pariat often wanted to interweave the mundane and the surreal, the apparent reality of daily life with the folkloric and her debut book of stories attempts to portray the way in which many different “realities” co-exist in the northeast, from where she hails.\n\n“Boats on Land” is a collection of 15 stories set in and around Shillong, Cherrapunjee and pockets of Assam. The tales span over the course of a century, beginning in the 1850s and ending in the contemporary, modern world.\n\nThey are historical, almost sociological re-imaginings of a region and its people, interweaving folklore, superstition with political and social events both local and international.\n\nThe writer from Shillong who is currently studying History of Art at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London started writing down these stories about two years ago.\n\n“I wrote these stories with a view to somehow fill the space between the realistic and the folkloric, to re-imagine the places I’ve grown up in, and to paint a vivid picture of a stunningly poignant and troubled region,” Pariat told PTI.\n\n“Boats on Land”, published by Random House, is about that have grown out of anecdotes that Pariat heard from family, friends and even strangers. It is a unique way of looking at the northeast and its people against a larger historical canvas – the early days of the British Raj, the World Wars, conversions to Christianity, and the missionaries.\n\n“I wanted to interweave the mundane and the surreal, the apparent reality of our daily lives with the folkloric. The stories in ‘Boats on Land’ attempt to portray the way in which many different ‘realities’ co-exist in the region where I come from… My stories, more than anything else, offer an alternate way of looking at the world, wherever the reader might be from,” she says.\n\nPariat chose US photographer Neil Craver’s shot of a nude girl under water for the cover.\n\n“Craver’s photograph was apt for a number of reasons – it’s a striking, catchy image, with gorgeous colours. Water, especially rivers, features a great deal in my stories and works as a transformative, often magical space. The photo also picks up on the imagery from the title story, which features two young girls who take solace in a bath tub filled with warm water,” she says.\n\nAccording to Pariat, the stories her grandparents told her were as important as the stories that everyone else told me in her childhood while conceiving the book.\n\n“We must remember that the Khasis were a largely oral culture until the mid-1800s, until the coming of the missionaries, and hence, we hold a great reverence for the power of the word. Songs, mantras and folklore form an important part of our social interactions – and all that has filtered into shaping the book,” she says.\n\nZafri Mudasser Nofil\n\n(New Delhi, Oct 25, 2012) National Award-winning filmmaker Jahnu Barua, whose last film was the critically-acclaimed “Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara”, is back with his new offering – a take on the 26/11 mayhem which tries to make a universal statement on peace.\n\n“Baandhon”, produced by Assam State Film (Finance & Dev) Corporation, releases in theatres across Assam tomorrow. Its cast includes some leading names from the Assamese film industry — Bishnu Khargoria, Bina Patangia, Jatin Bora, Zarifa Wahid and Angshuman Bhuyan.\n\nBarua has written the story and script himself while the music is scored by Dhrubajyoti Phukan. The film will open the Indian panorama section of International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in Goa next month.\n\n“My film is made on behalf of the common man. It is a question from the common man, comprising 80-90 per cent of the population, who has nothing to do with the functioning of the world. They like life and want to live life. They have given the responsibility of functioning of the world to the leaders, who are supposed to take care of them. But episodes like 26/11 in which the common man has no role but is always a victim, keep on happening,” Barua told PTI.\n\nHe is surprised that the 26/11 mayhem inspired very few filmmakers to show to the world the horror of the common man and also denounce terrorism.\n\n“It’s really a shame. Being one of the top film-making countries, we should have attempted more films. But not many people from the film-making fraternity were inspired,” he says.\n\n“My film is exceptional. It is perhaps the only film so far that makes a universal statement on peace,” Barua, whose last Assamese film was “Tora” (2003) says.\n\nIn the film, septuagenarian couple Khargoria and Patangia arrive in Mumbai to look for their beloved grandson – the only other living member of the family who has been missing since the 26/11 terror attack.\n\nBarua has always tried through his films to deal with the people and their hopes and aspirations.\n\n“Though I have forayed into mainstream cinema, my approach will remain the same,” he says.\n\nHis “Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara”, released in 2005, brought him critical acclaim. It also won a number of international awards. Starring Anupam Kher and Urmila Matondkar, the film deals with the disturbances in the relationship between the father and daughter that are somehow linked to Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy.\n\nBarua, who hails from Assam, has won 10 National Film Awards and over 25 awards at international festivals. His “Halodhiya Choraye Baodhan Khai” (Catastrophe) won the President’s Swarna Kamal for the best feature film in 1987, while “Hkhagoroloi Bohu Door” (It’s a Long Way to the Sea) received the Swarna Kamal for best director in 1996.\n\nHis “Firingoti” (Spark) won the second best national film award and the best actress award for Moloya Goswami. In 2003, Barua was given the Padma Shri for his contribution to cinema.\n\n(New Delhi, Oct 23, 2012) A script that takes a look at witch hunting in Assam through the eyes of a kid is the only non-European project chosen for the co-production market of Cinekid, the world’s largest film, TV and cross-media festival for children being held in Amsterdam.\n\nAdapted from acclaimed Assamese writer Manikuntala Bhattacharjya’s children’s novel “Ishu” by National Award-winning film critic Utpal Borpujari, the script, also titled “Ishu”, is among the 15 film projects chosen to be presented before a high-profile panel of co-producers, distributors and sales agents who have descend from all over the world at Cinekid Junior Co-Production Market for four days from today.\n\nThe selection of “Ishu”, which is the only representative of all the continents outside Europe at the event, was done by Cinekid for Professionals (CfP), which also chose 15 TV and 10 cross-media projects – again all from only Europe – for children for the co-production market.\n\n“The junior co-production market will enable financiers, broadcasters and professionals to assess new and innovative projects across the cross-media, film and television sectors,” a CfP statement said.\n\nThe film’s script is under consideration of the Children’s Film Society, India (CFSI). As securing funds to make an Assamese film is quite an uphill task, Borpujari is awaiting CFSI’s decision.\n\nThe story of Ishu is set in the Rabha community, and the film is likely to be shot in Rabha villages near Goalpara. With the theme having its backdrop in witch hunting, Borpujari plans to dedicate the film to Birobala Rabha, the crusader against the social scourge.\n\nThe film’s production work will be handled by Eleeanora Images, a company led by director Nila Madhab Panda of “I Am Kalam” and “Jalpari” fame.\n\nMore than 350 international professionals are expected to visit the CfP event and over 100 financiers, potential co-producers, commissioning editors the junior co-production market.\n\nZafri Mudasser Nofil\n\n(New Delhi, Oct 21, 2012) Global warming is disrupting the biological clocks of many animal species and changes in them are unnatural and unlike than their usual activities of reproduction and habitation, environmentalists say.\n\nNaturalist Raza H Tehsin and his daughter Udaipur’s Wildlife Warden Arefa Tehsin studied the behavioural changes in birds, snakes and fish and concluded that global warming was upsetting their biological clock.\n\nAccording to B C Choudhury, honorary advisor of the Marine Conservation Division of Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), the changes in many species are more apparent on the global warming sea level rise, changes in temperature and tidal cycles.\n\n“Predicting the change will be significant in the coastal areas. Also with climate change, the phenological cycle will change of the plants particularly in the higher altitude areas many of insects and nectar-feeding birds that breed in these areas, their feeding regime will also change. Therefore their biological and breeding cycles will also change,” Choudhury told PTI.\n\nThe Tehsins say that four species of murrel fish (Chenna species) are found in Udaipur district. It is a kind of fish which can breathe in water as well as take air directly from the atmosphere. Also it makes its nest in underwater weeds, plants or some sheltered corner and lays eggs there.\n\n“In the rivers, it lays eggs between May and June. During this time the force of water is less and the eggs don’t get carried away in the current. As the danger of eggs flowing away is lesser in lakes, murrel breeds during July to August as well,” says Arefa.\n\n“They generally prefer shallow waters with moss and weeds. At short intervals brood comes to the surface to take air. Till the time they grow up, both the parents look after them. Another intriguing fact is that the parents keep devouring the fingerlings now and then. Rest of the times they sustain themselves on frogs, small fish and other water creatures.”\n\nRaza says murrel’s behaviour has also been affected by global warming to a great extent.\n\n“Their breeding season is over, and yet not only do they continue to lay eggs in Chambal river and its tributaries this year but have also have been observed at many places with their broods.\n\n“In the same context, in the region of Chambal, the migratory duck pintail comes from north – the cold region of Antarctic – in the beginning of October. This year it was seen in large numbers in the month of September itself,” Raza says.\n\n“Peacock and grey partridge whose chicks are seen from February to July, have started to breed again in September and their chicks can be seen at this time of the year. There are mothers with semi-adults and baby chicks, both together.\n\n“The temperature and humidity is so high for the reptiles that the snakes have begun breeding again. Especially some cobras, kraits and rat snakes were seen in pairs and seem ready to attack. Not only this, there has been a rise in snakebites also,” Raza further says.\n\nThe UN Convention on Migratory Species had recently pointed out that global warming threatens the migratory habits of many animals such as birds, turtles, dolphins or whales.\n\n“Global warming disrupts the biological clocks of these animals. Many of these species then begin their migration at the wrong time or not at the start because they do not perceive the passage from one season to another.\n\n“In this way threatens the reproduction of many species that require certain conditions to their reproductive process, such is the case for example of the Monarch Butterfly coming to Mexico to play,” it says.\n\nClimate change, according to the Convention, definitely affects all species and more to migratory species.\n\n“The increase in sea level will also be a factor in the disappearance of many species will be sentenced to life their natural habitats or breeding.”\n\n(New Delhi, Oct 21, 2012) A hit video by a band from Nagaland will represent India at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Germany next month after scoring over strong contenders like Indus Creed and Menwhopause.\n\nPainted Dreams by Alobo Naga & The Band was declared winner of the ‘Best Indian Act’ category which also had Bandish Projekt and Oliver Sean.\n\nFrom now until October 30, local winners around the globe will compete for the honour of representing their region in the race for the second ever Worldwide Act.\n\nThe MTV Europe Music Awards will be aired live on November 11 from Frankfurt.\n\n‘Painted Dreams’ was the official theme song of the first Guwahati International Short Film Festival, 2011 and was conceptualised and directed by Prithish and Puja Chakraborty of Creovaent Productions, Guwahati.\n\nFormed in 2010, Alobo Naga and the Band is made up of five typical young Naga men — Alobo Naga (Vocals), Akum Jams, Fung Walling, DJ Sumika Yepthomi and Pamei. While its roots are firmly entrenched in the contemporary progressive rock genre, the band, however, adapts to any form.\n\n‘Painted Dreams’ was ranked among the Top 50 international music videos of 2011 by US channel VH1. It also featured at number four in VH1’s International Top 10 Chart Busters, a list which had the likes of Lady Gaga, Christina Aguilera and Pitbull."
