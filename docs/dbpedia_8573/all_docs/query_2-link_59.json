        "text": "The Global Hunger Index Report, 2014 indicates that the hunger is highest in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia and the irony is that it is more rampant among people who are the producers of food. The report also noted that the `hidden hunger’ or the deficiency of micro-nutrients, is much prevalent in Africa, South of the Sahara and the South Asian Continent. In the 21st century when the civilization boasts of its technology, development, and fast paced advancements why so many people are starving? Does hunger persists due to famine, flood or other natural disasters or is it a manmade disaster? Is hunger a part of larger agricultural crisis that is aggravating farmer suicides and causing starvation deaths across the continent? Why after decades of independence, people in South Asia are hungry? What is the role of state in providing food to its starving citizens? This essay looks at the issue of hunger in South Asia and examines the manner in which ordinary people are fighting against it. It argues that hunger is manmade phenomenon and is inextricably linked to ecological imbalance created due to faulty policies adopted by the governments across the continent. To combat hunger the need is to create an alternate paradigm which focus on food sovereignty, decentralized decisions making and control of people rather than markets over production, distribution and consumption of food. The right to food must be comprehensively construed to address the structural roots of hunger.\n\nThis widespread pseudo language phrase has been floating around in electronic, print and digital media besides being projected on billboards across South Asia. The advertiser, while using this phrase along with the image of a slice of a pizza, invites the attention of a section of population to the culture of consumption. However, this symbol of modernity strongly contradicts with the images from the other parts of the subcontinent where people are starving and dying of hunger. Recently, I came across the Report on the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2014 which scrutinized the state of hunger in 120 countries. On the basis of multidimensional statistical analysis, it claims that 55 of these countries are in abysmal conditions with respect to hunger. The report estimates that 805 millions are suffering from chronic hunger while 2 billion people are afflicted with hidden hunger, that is, a deficiency of micronutrients, all over the world. According to this report, Africa and South Asia have the highest level of hunger. The GHI ranks India at 55th position, Bangladesh and Pakistan at 57th position, Nepal at 44th and Sri Lanka at 39th. In this context when I see this tagline Hungry Kya?, I feel the urge of reframing it to Hunger Kya Hai? (What is hunger from the perspective of a hungry person?) Hungry kaun? (Who are Hungry?) Hungry Kyun aur Kaise? (Why and how hunger persists in South Asia in spite of accelerating economic growth?) In this article, I attempt to look at the microcosmic reality and macrocosmic facts relating to hunger in South Asia\n\nHungry Kya? (Are you Hungry?)

While selecting the topic for this conference I had two main considerations in mind: (i) the topic should be somewhat related to the subjects chosen for the discussion at the conference, and that (ii) it should be related to the most important problems challenging India’s present as well as future generations. I then decided to speak on Poverty, Hunger, and Food Security in India. I am conscious that many scholars have done considerable research in the area and some of them might be attending this conference also, I may not touch upon the serious research but I will try myself best to give some serious thought on these concepts and their relevance today. India was called the Golden Bird in the beginning of the 20th Century and attracted hordes of invaders from outside through ages. These invaders looted this territory and destroyed its economic structure completely. As a result the country of riches became a country of poor. When India became independent the biggest challenge for the Planners was to rebuild the country to match its past glorious history by careful planning and implementation of the appropriate developmental policies. Planners in India chose the Nehruvian Model in place of the Gandhian Model. The argument put forward was based on Kuznets thesis that growth will take care of the poverty and underdevelopment through the “Trickle Down” effect. In fact, our policy makers and planners chose a different path leaving the Gandhian village and agrarian economy based model of development and choose Russian Model based on development of basic and heavy industries for the country. As a result the agriculture was neglected causing wide spread poverty, inequality and unemployment in the country. In fact our policy makers were quite unaware of these problems in the country. One of the earliest ventures to highlight the issue of poverty was made by Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia. He wrote a pamphlet stating that a majority of the Indian population is extremely poor and lived on 3 annas a day. This gave rise to a debate and the Planning Commission set up a working group of economists and social workers to suggest the government about the nature and extent of poverty in India. The working group gave its recommendations in July, 1962 and suggested that at the national level the minimum expenditure per capita per month should be Rs. 20/- (at 1960-61 prices). Population below this expenditure level may be called poor. Planning Commission noted,“on the basis of the available data on distribution of population according to per capita expenditure nearly half the Indian population in 1960-61 was below this minimum level and they are poor.” There was a mention that this minimum was calculated on the basis of physical commodities but nothing more is said about it. All this awaked the interest of scholars in the study of the problem of poverty and a large number of scholars started studying poverty on their own.\n\nThe Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2017 is just out. India ranks 100th among 119 developing countries. The country has been given a score of 31.4 score in the index and that puts it at a high end ‘Serious’ zone. Even North Korea with 93 rank and Iraq at 78th place fare better than India. A comparison of India’s rank with that of all its neighbouring countries also projects a sad picture for it. While China at 29 is far ahead of us but Nepal, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh with respective scores of 72, 77, 84 and 88 have also done better than India. Pakistan’s 106th rank is the only face saver it seems. Please read my latest column in Six Degrees on this, that discusses how the current economic growth model has actually not helped India to tackle hunger. A short comparison with Kenya has also been given in context. The article goes on to suggest a very few measures that the government needs to take to fight hunger and malnutrition.\n\nAfter 72 years of independence India is still suffering from the malicious problem of and poverty. The farmers, who are providing food to our 1.31 billion population are in empty stomach and bare hands. 21.7 per cent of it's people are below the poverty line. According to National Crime Record Bureau, in the year 2015 the total numbers of farmers who have committed suicide is 5670. A survey of FAO reveals that nearly 75 per cent of food insecure and vulnerable people are directly or indirectly related to agriculture. Another report of FAO has revealed that about 78 per cent of the farmers are ready to quit agriculture. This is really alarming as well as distressing while we have made a call for complete digitization to create ICT driven modern India. Poverty can be measured in terms of income. In other way the other forms of poverty are educational starvation, cultural deprivation and social depletion. Silence can be perceived in terms of inability of a person to raise voices against discrimination, both social and economic atrocities as well as a decision to go silent whenever it needs to utter voices .On this preamble the present study was conducted in Beraberi GP under Nadia district of WB. 150 respondents were selected purposively and they were interviewed thoroughly with a structured interview schedule. In this study 21 independent variables were selected against a dependent variable poverty (Y). Here in this study it has been revealed that the most important aspects of impoverishment of the farming community are cropping intensity, communication variables, livestock possession and stress perception."
