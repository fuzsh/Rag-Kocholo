        "text": "Safety and security\n\nBorder with Cameroon\n\nThe border with Cameroon is prone to violent clashes due to contested border areas. A cross-border pact was signed with Cameroon in 2020 to help resolve the issue but the border can still close unexpectedly.\n\nCheck the border status before travelling to the area.\n\nCrime\n\nPetty crime, such as pickpocketing, purse snatching and theft from unattended vehicles, occurs.\n\nViolent crimes, such as armed robbery and residential break-ins, occur, particularly in Bata and Malabo. The threat increases at night.\n\nEnsure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times\n\nAvoid walking alone, especially after dark\n\nDo not carry large amounts of cash\n\nRemain vigilant near ATMs and banks, as there have been robberies targeting these facilities\n\nDemonstrations\n\nDemonstrations must be approved by the government; therefore they rarely occur. Security forces have used tear gas to disperse crowds during illegal protests in the past.\n\nEven peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.\n\nAvoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place\n\nFollow the instructions of local authorities\n\nMonitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations\n\nMass gatherings (large-scale events)\n\nRoad safety\n\nRoad conditions\n\nRoad conditions are good throughout the country. Most roads are paved, but some may be poorly lit. Traffic signs are adequate.\n\nRoad safety\n\nDrivers can be aggressive and reckless. They often drive at excessive speeds. Drinking and driving is prevalent.\n\nAvoid travel after dark\n\nDon’t pick up hitchhikers\n\nKeep doors locked and windows rolled up while driving\n\nRemain alert for pedestrians and livestock\n\nIn the event of an accident, don’t move your vehicle until the police arrives\n\nRoadblocks and checkpoints\n\nRoadblocks and checkpoints are common, especially in and around the cities of Malabo and Bata.\n\nIt’s common for security forces to extort small bribes from motorists. If you are stopped:\n\ncooperate with local authorities\n\ncarry proper identification at all times\n\nbe prepared to explain the purpose of your travel\n\nwhen travelling outside of Bata and Malabo, carry a letter from your employer or other organization stating the purpose of your travel\n\ndo not pay bribes, instead, request a citation that you can pay at a local court\n\nPublic Transportation\n\nPublic transportation facilities are limited.\n\nPublic buses are not safe.\n\nTaxis\n\nShared taxis (bush taxis) are a common way of getting around. However, they are poorly maintained and drivers are often reckless. There have been incidents of taxi drivers robbing their passengers.\n\nAvoid using taxis unless the driver is personally known or recommended to you\n\nAvoid sharing a taxi with strangers\n\nEnsure that the driver does not pick up other passengers along the way to your destination\n\nFraud\n\nCredit card and ATM fraud occurs in Equatorial Guinea. When using debit or credit cards:\n\npay careful attention if other people are handling your cards\n\nuse ATMs located in public areas or inside a bank or business\n\navoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature\n\ncover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN\n\ncheck for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements\n\nWomen’s Safety\n\nWomen travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.\n\nAdvice for women travellers\n\nSwimming\n\nCoastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common. Many beaches don’t offer warnings of dangerous conditions and they don’t always have lifeguards on duty.\n\nRescue services may not be consistent with international standards. Several drownings occur each year.\n\nFollow the instructions and warnings of local authorities.\n\nWater safety abroad\n\nPiracy\n\nPirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters, and in some cases, farther out at sea.\n\nMariners should take appropriate precautions.\n\nLive piracy report - International Maritime Bureau\n\nAir travel\n\nWe do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.\n\nInformation about foreign domestic airlines\n\nHealth\n\nRelevant Travel Health Notices\n\nGlobal Measles Notice - 13 March, 2024\n\nCOVID-19 and International Travel - 13 March, 2024\n\nThis section contains information on possible health risks and restrictions regularly found or ongoing in the destination. Follow this advice to lower your risk of becoming ill while travelling. Not all risks are listed below.\n\nConsult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic preferably 6 weeks before you travel to get personalized health advice and recommendations.\n\nRoutine vaccines\n\nBe sure that your routine vaccinations, as per your province or territory, are up-to-date before travelling, regardless of your destination.\n\nSome of these vaccinations include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, varicella (chickenpox), influenza and others.\n\nPre-travel vaccines and medications\n\nYou may be at risk for preventable diseases while travelling in this destination. Talk to a travel health professional about which medications or vaccines may be right for you, based on your destination and itinerary.\n\nYellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements\n\nYellow fever is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito.\n\nTravellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection.\n\nRisk\n\nThere is a risk of yellow fever in this country.\n\nCountry Entry Requirement*\n\nProof of vaccination is required if you are coming from a countrywhere yellow fever occurs.\n\nRecommendation\n\nVaccination is recommended.\n\nContact a designated Yellow Fever Vaccination Centre well in advance of your trip to arrange for vaccination.\n\nDiscuss travel plans, activities, and destinations with a health care professional.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites.\n\nAbout Yellow Fever\n\nYellow Fever Vaccination Centres in Canada\n\n* It is important to note that country entry requirements may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest diplomatic or consular office of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements.\n\nHepatitis A\n\nThere is a risk of hepatitis A in this destination. It is a disease of the liver. People can get hepatitis A if they ingest contaminated food or water, eat foods prepared by an infectious person, or if they have close physical contact (such as oral-anal sex) with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus.\n\nPractise safe food and water precautions and wash your hands often. Vaccination is recommended for all travellers to areas where hepatitis A is present.\n\nMeasles\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease. It can spread quickly from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nAnyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of being infected with it when travelling internationally.\n\nRegardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are fully protected against measles.\n\nHepatitis B\n\nHepatitis B is a risk in every destination. It is a viral liver disease that is easily transmitted from one person to another through exposure to blood and body fluids containing the hepatitis B virus. Travellers who may be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) are at higher risk of getting hepatitis B.\n\nHepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all travellers. Prevent hepatitis B infection by practicing safe sex, only using new and sterile drug equipment, and only getting tattoos and piercings in settings that follow public health regulations and standards.\n\nMalaria\n\nMalaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease that is caused by parasites spread through the bites of mosquitoes.\n\nMalaria is a risk to travellers to this destination.\n\nAntimalarial medication is recommended for most travellers to this destination and should be taken as recommended. Consult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic before travelling to discuss your options. It is recommended to do this 6 weeks before travel, however, it is still a good idea any time before leaving.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites at all times:\n\nCover your skin and use an approved insect repellent on uncovered skin.\n\nExclude mosquitoes from your living area with screening and/or closed, well-sealed doors and windows.\n\nUse insecticide-treated bed nets if mosquitoes cannot be excluded from your living area.\n\nWear permethrin-treated clothing.\n\nIf you develop symptoms similar to malaria when you are travelling or up to a year after you return home, see a health care professional immediately. Tell them where you have been travelling or living.\n\nRabies\n\nIn this destination, rabies is commonly carried by dogs and some wildlife, including bats. Rabies is a deadly disease that spreads to humans primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal. While travelling, take precautions, including keeping your distance from animals (including free-roaming dogs), and closely supervising children.\n\nIf you are bitten or scratched by a dog or other animal while travelling, immediately wash the wound with soap and clean water and see a health care professional. In this destination, rabies treatment may be limited or may not be available, therefore you may need to return to Canada for treatment.\n\nBefore travel, discuss rabies vaccination with a health care professional. It may be recommended for travellers who are at high risk of exposure (e.g., occupational risk such as veterinarians and wildlife workers, children, adventure travellers and spelunkers, and others in close contact with animals).\n\nCOVID-19\n\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious viral disease. It can spread from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nIt is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series along with any additional recommended doses in Canada before travelling. Evidence shows that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. While vaccination provides better protection against serious illness, you may still be at risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and is at greater risk for severe disease when travelling internationally.\n\nBefore travelling, verify your destination’s COVID-19 vaccination entry/exit requirements. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are adequately protected against COVID-19.\n\nSafe food and water precautions\n\nMany illnesses can be caused by eating food or drinking beverages contaminated by bacteria, parasites, toxins, or viruses, or by swimming or bathing in contaminated water.\n\nLearn more about food and water precautions to take to avoid getting sick by visiting our eat and drink safely abroad page. Remember: Boil it, cook it, peel it, or leave it!\n\nAvoid getting water into your eyes, mouth or nose when swimming or participating in activities in freshwater (streams, canals, lakes), particularly after flooding or heavy rain. Water may look clean but could still be polluted or contaminated.\n\nAvoid inhaling or swallowing water while bathing, showering, or swimming in pools or hot tubs.\n\nTyphoid\n\nTyphoid is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Risk is higher among children, travellers going to rural areas, travellers visiting friends and relatives or those travelling for a long period of time.\n\nTravellers visiting regions with a risk of typhoid, especially those exposed to places with poor sanitation, should speak to a health care professional about vaccination.\n\nSchistosomiasis\n\nThere is a risk of schistosomiasis in this destination. Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by tiny worms (blood flukes) which can be found in freshwater (lakes, rivers, ponds, and wetlands). The worms can break the skin, and their eggs can cause stomach pain, diarrhea, flu-like symptoms, or urinary problems. Schistosomiasis mostly affects underdeveloped and rural communities, particularly agricultural and fishing communities.\n\nMost travellers are at low risk. Travellers should avoid contact with untreated freshwater such as lakes, rivers, and ponds (e.g., swimming, bathing, wading, ingesting). There is no vaccine or medication available to prevent infection.\n\nInsect bite prevention\n\nMany diseases are spread by the bites of infected insects such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas or flies. When travelling to areas where infected insects may be present:\n\nUse insect repellent (bug spray) on exposed skin\n\nCover up with light-coloured, loose clothes made of tightly woven materials such as nylon or polyester\n\nMinimize exposure to insects\n\nUse mosquito netting when sleeping outdoors or in buildings that are not fully enclosed\n\nTo learn more about how you can reduce your risk of infection and disease caused by bites, both at home and abroad, visit our insect bite prevention page.\n\nFind out what types of insects are present where you’re travelling, when they’re most active, and the symptoms of the diseases they spread.\n\nChikungunya\n\nThere is a risk of chikungunya in this country. The level of risk may vary by:\n\nseason\n\nyear\n\nregion\n\nelevation\n\nThe virus that causes chikungunya is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can cause fever and pain in the joints. In some cases, the joint pain can be severe and last for months or years.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites at all times.\n\nLearn more:\n\nInsect bite and pest prevention\n\nChikungunya\n\nDengue\n\nIn this country, risk of dengue is sporadic. It is a viral disease spread to humans by mosquito bites.\n\nDengue can cause flu-like symptoms. In some cases, it can lead to severe dengue, which can be fatal.\n\nThe level of risk of dengue changes seasonally, and varies from year to year. The level of risk also varies between regions in a country and can depend on the elevation in the region.\n\nMosquitoes carrying dengue typically bite during the daytime, particularly around sunrise and sunset.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites. There is no vaccine or medication that protects against dengue fever.\n\nOnchoceriasis\n\nOnchocerciasis (river blindness) is an eye and skin disease caused by a parasite spread through the bite of an infected female blackfly. Onchocerciasis often leads to blindness if left untreated. Risk is generally low for most travellers. Protect yourself from blackfly bites, which are most common close to fast-flowing rivers and streams. There is no vaccine available for onchocerciasis although drug treatments exist.\n\nAfrican trypanosomiasis\n\nAfrican trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) is caused by a parasite spread through the bite of a tsetse fly. Tsetse flies usually bite during the day and the bites are usually painful. If untreated, the disease is eventually fatal. Risk is generally low for most travellers. Protect yourself from bites especially in game parks and rural areas. Avoid wearing bright or dark-coloured clothing as these colours attract tsetse flies. There is no vaccine available for this disease.\n\nAnimal precautions\n\nSome infections, such as rabies and influenza, can be shared between humans and animals. Certain types of activities may increase your chance of contact with animals, such as travelling in rural or forested areas, camping, hiking, and visiting wet markets (places where live animals are slaughtered and sold) or caves.\n\nTravellers are cautioned to avoid contact with animals, including dogs, livestock (pigs, cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats, and to avoid eating undercooked wild game.\n\nClosely supervise children, as they are more likely to come in contact with animals.\n\nPerson-to-person infections\n\nStay home if you’re sick and practise proper cough and sneeze etiquette, which includes coughing or sneezing into a tissue or the bend of your arm, not your hand. Reduce your risk of colds, the flu and other illnesses by:\n\nwashing your hands often\n\navoiding or limiting the amount of time spent in closed spaces, crowded places, or at large-scale events (concerts, sporting events, rallies)\n\navoiding close physical contact with people who may be showing symptoms of illness\n\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV, and mpox are spread through blood and bodily fluids; use condoms, practise safe sex, and limit your number of sexual partners. Check with your local public health authority pre-travel to determine your eligibility for mpox vaccine.\n\nTuberculosis\n\nTuberculosis is an infection caused by bacteria and usually affects the lungs.\n\nFor most travellers the risk of tuberculosis is low.\n\nTravellers who may be at high risk while travelling in regions with risk of tuberculosis should discuss pre- and post-travel options with a health care professional.\n\nHigh-risk travellers include those visiting or working in prisons, refugee camps, homeless shelters, or hospitals, or travellers visiting friends and relatives.\n\nHIV\n\nHIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks and impairs the immune system, resulting in a chronic, progressive illness known as AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome).\n\nHigh risk activities include anything which puts you in contact with blood or body fluids, such as unprotected sex and exposure to unsterilized needles for medications or other substances (for example, steroids and drugs), tattooing, body-piercing or acupuncture.\n\nMedical services and facilities\n\nHealth care is inadequate and supplies are limited. You will likely need medical evacuation in case of serious illness or injury.\n\nMedication\n\nMedicine is not always available outside Bata and Malabo.
