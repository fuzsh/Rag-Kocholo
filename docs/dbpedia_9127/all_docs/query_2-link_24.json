        "text": "Situated on Central Africa's west coast bordered by Cameroon and Gabon, Equatorial Guinea spans 28,000 square kilometers, comprising the insular Bioko Island and the mainland Río Muni. The nation is dominated by the Fang and Bubi ethnic groups. Despite political challenges, Equatorial Guinea's rich history and diverse landscapes, from the Gulf of Guinea's Bioko to the volcanic Annobon, paint a captivating picture.\n\nEquatorial Guinea utilizes the Central African CFA franc (XAF), a currency shared with five other Central African nations and issued by the Bank of Central African States in Yaounde, Cameroon. Despite being nominally subdivided into 100 centimes, no centime denominations exist. The production of CFA franc notes has been centralized in Chamalieres by the Bank of France since its inception in 1945.\n\nBefore adopting the CFA franc as its official currency, Equatorial Guinea employed the ekwele as its monetary unit from 1975 to 1985. The ekwele took the place of the peseta guineana, which had served as the country's currency since 1969.\n\nStarting in 1975, the Banco Popular, tasked with issuing ekwele banknotes, introduced notes designed with the image of President Macias Nguema Biyogo. Following his overthrow in 1979, the banknotes underwent a transformation, replacing President Biyogo's portrait with those of the nation’s leaders, including Tomas Engono Nkogo, Rey Uganda, Enrique Nvo Okenve, and Rey Bioko. These banknotes were withdrawn and were replaced by the Central African CFA franc when Equatorial Guinea entered the Franc zone in 1985."
