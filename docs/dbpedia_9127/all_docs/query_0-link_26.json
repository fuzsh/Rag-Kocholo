        "text": "John Odling-Smee\n\nOne thing Paul Masson did not emphasize was the debate that took place in Western Europe on the question of whether economic and monetary union would be better for the general level of inflation than a continuation of the existing European monetary system. One side in this debate held that as long as there was scope to adjust exchange rates, as there is in the existing system, some countries would be able to have higher inflation rates. Fixing exchange rates and, ultimately, creating a single currency would remove that scope, and the high-inflation countries would be forced to accept inflation closer to the center, lowering the average inflation rate. The counter view was that the average inflation rate depended on the behavior of the dominant monetary authority. With a single currency, the dominant authority would be the new European central bank, perhaps with some involvement from governments; with the existing European monetary system, this bank was, in essence, the Bundesbank.\n\nIt is not possible to resolve this debate a priori, but it is quite possible that involving more authorities in the governance of the new European central bank would result in a somewhat more inflationary outcome, on average, than what would occur if the Bundesbank alone were in charge. This outcome would hold true if the high-inflation countries no longer had high inflation, because with a single currency they would have to lower their inflation rates. A cynic might argue that the only reason why many countries want to have a European central bank rather than the European monetary system is because they want to have a somewhat easier overall inflationary position.\n\nThis topic serves as an introductory point and a transition to what I want to say about the ruble area, because one of the more interesting features of developments in the ruble area over the last year has been the way the incentives within the system have created a clear inflationary bias. The absence of monetary coordination has provided an incentive for all countries to try to inflate as quickly as possible, stimulating inflation throughout the whole region. For this reason, the question of finding the monetary arrangement that best-controls inflation or brings about monetary stability in a currency region is something that West Europeans look at from a slightly different point of view in terms of the ruble area.\n\nAnother introductory point is again in contrast with what Mr. Masson has been saying. I shall be less concerned with what in some sense ought to be done in the ruble area, in terms of economic objectives, than with what can be done. In terms of the countries, the question is one of political feasibility, since the issue has become rather politicized. In considering economic policy for the region, therefore, it is necessary to be very conscious of the political constraints.\n\nI shall start with a few words about the current situation in the former Soviet Union and then draw attention to the main problems in the ruble area arising from the currency question, discussing possible solutions. The countries of the former Soviet Union have tried to establish working monetary relations between themselves. Although they once used the same currency—the ruble—some of them have already introduced their own currencies. Exactly how to make their system work has become a topic of much debate.\n\nThe current situation in the 15 countries of the former Soviet Union has evolved quite quickly since the beginning of 1992, when they were all using the ruble, the currency of the former USSR. During the second half of 1992, first Estonia, then Latvia, and finally Lithuania introduced their own currencies. Estonia pegged the kroon at eight to the Deutsche mark. Latvia and Lithuania floated their currencies—the Latvian ruble and the talonas—which the authorities say are temporary. In November, Ukraine also left the ruble area and introduced its own temporary currency, the karbovanets, which is also floating. The three countries that have temporary currencies—Latvia, Lithuania, and Ukraine—intend to introduce what they regard as their own permanent currencies at some stage in the future, although none has announced a date.1 They do not want to introduce a permanent currency until the financial situation is under control, because they do not want a new currency associated with the very difficult monetary situations they now face, perhaps compromising its prestige. They are therefore waiting for a moment when they can introduce the new currencies successfully, with a reasonable amount of monetary stability. To an economist, this change from a temporary to a permanent currency is a purely technical one, although it has real political significance for the countries involved. Thus, it is possible to talk about these four countries as though they already have their own currencies.\n\nOf the other 11 countries, 2 or 3 have already announced their intention to introduce their own currencies in the relatively near future. Azerbaijan, in particular, has mentioned February 1, 1993,2 and one or two others have said they will take action fairly soon. Other countries have introduced what are called coupons, or surrogate rubles. These trade, one for one, with the ruble and really exist only in cash—not in noncash (i.e., deposit)—form. They were introduced owing to a shortage of cash rubles early in 1992 that has now ended.\n\nRussia continues to issue the ruble and remains the dominant country in the ruble area. Its GDP is over 60 percent of the GDP of the total territory of the former USSR. Now that Ukraine, which had between 15 and 20 percent of total GDP, has left the ruble area, Russia’s share of ruble area GDP is about 75 percent. It controls the only supply of ruble bank notes, since all the printing presses for ruble bank notes are on Russian territory. It also has large balance of payments surpluses with nearly all the other member countries of the ruble area because of the traditional structure of trade. Russia is an exporter of raw materials, especially energy, while the other former republics export manufactured and agricultural goods.\n\nThe ruble area as it functions now is defined by the fact that monetary policy among the countries involved is not coordinated. Each central bank extends credit to its government and to commercial banks independently, sets reserve requirements independently, and determines interest rates independently. Although there may be some local control from a government or parliament, there is no effective coordination. The maneuverability of ruble area central banks outside Russia was limited in early 1992 by the Central Bank of Russia’s position as sole issuer of ruble currency, but these central banks were able to finance different rates of credit expansion by borrowing from the Central Bank of Russia, by creating bank reserves, and, in some cases, by issuing coupons or parallel national currencies.\n\nIn attempting to isolate themselves from the relatively tight credit policy of the Central Bank of Russia in the early months of 1992, some of these central banks adopted divergent credit and interest rate policies. Some, however, continued to pursue a restrained monetary policy, but once one or two—especially the larger ones—began expanding domestic credit at a rapid rate, others realized that this policy constituted a “free ride.” They could expand domestic credit and create strong inflationary pressures throughout the ruble area as a whole, but these pressures would be shared by all the area’s countries, reducing the risk to individual economies. In fact, it was in the interests of individual countries to expand credit in the absence of any centralized controls or agreements. This was the source of the inflationary bias that I mentioned before. Of course, all the strong inflationary pressures in the former Soviet Union cannot be attributed to the lack of coordination. The policies of Russia itself were very inflationary, and almost certainly they account for the larger part of the overall inflationary pressures in the ruble area.\n\nUntil the end of June 1992, Russia automatically financed payments imbalances with the other countries of the former Soviet Union through correspondent accounts the other central banks held with the Central Bank of Russia. At the beginning of the year, Russia was uncertain how the ruble area would operate and did not want to impose too many restrictions on the system. The correspondent account balances were allowed to grow. After the first two or three months, the other countries began to accumulate debts to the Central Bank of Russia—a result of growing payments imbalances.\n\nWith effect from the first of July 1992, Russia changed its policy, and, in order to control the growth of interstate credit through these correspondent accounts, the Central Bank of Russia instructed its main branches to centralize all interstate payments through one Moscow office. The Central Bank created a new system of bilateral correspondent accounts, under which payments from another state could not be processed until that state was either running a payment surplus with Russia—not a very common event—or had negotiated a technical credit with Russia to finance a payments deficit (“technical credit” was the name given to explicit credit of a certain amount). In essence, these countries were told that from the first of July they could not borrow from the Central Bank of Russia unless they negotiated an explicit amount. Open-ended credit was stopped. This new system rather quickly led to the blocking of payments from those states that had exhausted their credit limits—as a number of them quite quickly did. This development in turn affected not only payments for trade, but trade itself. One problem was that traders learned their payments had been blocked only after goods had actually been shipped; a Ukrainian exporter, for example, would sell goods to Russia, but the Central Bank of Russia would block the payment, leaving the Russian importer unable to pay the Ukrainian exporter. Huge arrears therefore developed in both directions, but mostly it was Russian enterprises that accumulated arrears with enterprises in other states of the former Soviet Union.\n\nThese arrears were not the only consequence of the new system. The aim of the new system was to control credit expansion to the other states, but it did not succeed. Whenever states ran up against their credit ceilings, they applied strong political pressure on Russia to ease the ceilings. In most cases the ceilings were raised, especially after July, when the Central Bank of Russia’s new management showed a greater willingness to extend credit not only to other states but within Russia itself. As a result, the new policy did not restrict the inflationary pressures created by the systemic problem of lack of coordinated monetary policy within the ruble area.\n\nOne further consequence of the new arrangements has been that the rubles used in different ruble area states are no longer worth the same amount. Of course, the notes are worth the same amount, because they can be smuggled across borders and exchanged, but the noncash rubles—the deposit money—cannot always be used equivalently. A number of states have introduced restrictions on deposit rubles domestic enterprises earn by exporting to Russia, barring the conversion of Russian deposit rubles into domestic rubles. Other forms of restriction have also grown up. The result is that these deposit rubles are now being exchanged at exchange rates that differ from par, giving rise to a de facto segmentation of the market for deposit rubles within the ruble area.\n\nFor example, the primary market for deposit rubles is in Latvia, which, interestingly enough, is outside the ruble area. On November 30, 1992, selling rates quoted by the Bank of Latvia were 0.22 Latvian ruble for each Kazakhstan ruble; 0.24 Latvian ruble for each Ukrainian ruble; 0.35 Latvian ruble for each Belarussian ruble; and 0.4 Latvian ruble for each Russian ruble. These rates are less than one because the Latvian ruble has appreciated: Latvia has been pursuing a tighter monetary policy than other countries in the ruble area since breaking free from the ruble. The differences among those rates are the consequence of the restrictions in the ruble area.\n\nIn sum, the lack of a coordinated monetary policy has created a serious inflationary bias in the system and generated issues concerning “free rider” countries. For example, one or two very senior policymakers in some of the smaller ruble area countries have indicated to the IMF their understanding of what the IMF has been saying to them since the beginning of 1992 about the importance of coordinating monetary policy. They have tried very hard to adhere to the rough guidelines that have several times been agreed to about growth in credit. But when some of their bigger neighbors allow credit to grow very rapidly, these policymakers are unable to restrain their politicians from insisting that the smaller countries should follow suit. These countries are clearly under great pressure.\n\nAnother point to be made here is that a single currency area can be broken up not by the formal introduction of separate currencies—although obviously that will cause disintegration—but by the imposition of restrictions on payments and capital flows, which generate de facto separate currencies.\n\nIn terms of solutions, the situation in late 1992 is clearly very unsatisfactory. The restrictions that countries feel they must introduce in order to try to make the ruble work in some way are seriously damaging trade and payments. All the countries suffer under this arrangement. Clearly a cooperative solution is the right sort of response to this situation. The IMF’s advice is that these countries make a clear choice between two alternatives and act on it: either remain in a single currency area with a common monetary policy or introduce a separate currency.\n\nUnder the first option, the countries would have to agree on clearly defined mechanisms for the pursuit of a common monetary policy with only one currency circulating throughout the area. Cash and deposits would need to be interchangeable throughout the area. Credit emission would be determined by a single authority. An alternative system in which separate monetary authorities are responsible for credit emission might be possible, but the authorities would agree on the total amount of credit and its allocation. (This solution was discussed earlier in 1992 but was not then politically feasible.)\n\nIn the absence of coordinated but separate monetary policies, it is necessary to have a single monetary policy. There are two ways of organizing such a policy. One is to have an interstate monetary institution of the sort the West Europeans have been discussing and incorporating in the Maastricht Treaty. The second is to have a single central bank, presumably the Central Bank of Russia, coordinate monetary policy for all countries in the ruble area. The choice between the two is a political matter that must be decided by the states themselves. What we can say as economic advisors is that it is essential for the survival of a single currency area that responsibility for the common monetary policy be placed squarely in the hands of a single authority. This authority should be responsible for providing adequate information to all the central banks in the area on important decisions regarding monetary, credit, and exchange rate policy and for harmonizing foreign exchange systems, central bank finance rates, and commercial bank reserve requirements.\n\nUnder the second option, in which countries introduce their own currencies, plans would have to be made to ensure that the new currencies were introduced, rubles withdrawn in an orderly way, and disruptions minimized. Governments would need to devote much time and energy to creating the institutions and acquiring the expertise needed to conduct independent monetary and exchange rate policies and manage international reserves. Decisions would have to be made on monetary policy under the new currency, including which exchange rate regime to use. Whatever exchange rate arrangements were adopted, the authorities would need to implement rules and procedures necessary for the conduct of an anti-inflationary monetary policy.\n\nIt is absolutely clear that a choice must be made between these two options. Moreover, it is doubtful whether in practice the political situation is such that the first option is feasible. The surrender of sovereignty required to accept a single monetary authority is not likely to be forthcoming in a period when newly independent nations are being built. Most of these countries will find that the only viable solution is to introduce their own currencies. This is politically feasible, though not necessarily economically desirable. I am not drawing on the four considerations that Mr. Masson mentioned at the beginning of his talk—factor mobility, the amount of interdependence between these economies, the degree of congruence, and wage and price flexibility—to decide on optimal currency areas. These issues, of course, could well point in another direction that would lead to a different sort of debate. But in the current situation, political considerations are paramount, and economic policymakers have to take them into account.\n\nFinally, the solution to the current difficulties requires a direct approach to the balance of payments financing problem. What has happened, essentially, is that balance of payments financing from Russia, which has been made available to the other countries through credits on the correspondent accounts, has not led to appropriate policy adjustments in the recipient countries. These countries have opted for financing without adjusting; in fact, the incentive structure is such that they have not been aware of the need for adjustment. Their willingness to adjust would be enhanced if interstate credit arrangements were formalized and separated from payment arrangements, making the balance of payments financing constraint more transparent.\n\nOne of the problems with the existing system is that the terms of the credit lines currently provided by the Central Bank of Russia through the correspondent accounts are poorly defined and constantly changing. Interest rates were initially set at the same rate as the Central Bank of Russia’s refinancing rate. They were subsequently reduced to zero. Repayment dates have been set and reset on an ad hoc basis. Credit limits have been increased frequently, in some cases on political grounds. Thus, there is great uncertainty about how much credit is available and how to get it. This situation does not inspire the countries running deficits to try to manage their affairs well, cut down on borrowing to avoid running into credit limits, or adjust appropriately in advance. It is important that procedures be developed for extending credit to meet chronic balance of payments deficits through channels other than the payment systems, so that systems are not overburdened with financing and payments and trade is not arbitrarily disrupted."
