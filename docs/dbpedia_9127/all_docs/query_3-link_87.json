With an area of 11,000 sq mi, Equatorial Guinea is one of the smallest countries in continental Africa. It has two parts, an insular and a mainland region. The insular region consists of the islands of Bioko in the Gulf of Guinea and Annobón, a small volcanic island south of the equator. Bioko island is the northernmost part of Equatorial Guinea and is the site of the country’s capital, Malabo. The island nation of São Tomé and Príncipe is located between Bioko and Annobón. The mainland region, Río Muni, is bordered by Cameroon on the north and Gabon on the south and east. It also includes several small offshore islands (such as Corisco, Elobey Grande, and Elobey Chico).\n\nHealth: CDC Equatorial Guinea\n\nWhat to Pack\n\nWeather: Equatorial Guinea Weather\n\nCommunications: Dial 011 followed by country code 224\n\nTravel Requirements\n\nPassport\n\nVisa is not required for all US Passport Holders, If you are not a US Passport holder, please consult the embassy in your region.\n\nProof of Immunization (Yellow Fever)\n\nDiplomatic Missions\n\nConsulate General of Equatorial Guinea\n\nAddress: 6401 Southwest Freeway, Houston, Texas 77074\n\nPhone: 713-776-9900\n\nFax:713-776-9955\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nWebsite: www.egconsulatehou.com\n\nEmbassy of the Equatorial Guinea in Washington, D.C.\n\nAddress: 2020 16th Street, NW.
