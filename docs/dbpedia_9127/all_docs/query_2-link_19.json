        "text": "Central African States (BEAC) The Central African CFA franc (French: franc CFA or simply franc, ISO 4217 code: XAF) is the currency of six independent states in Central Africa: Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. The Bank of Central African States (French: Banque des États de l'Afrique Centrale, BEAC) is a central bank that serves these six central African countries which form the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa. These six countries have also issued normal circulation coins on their name in various years as well. CFA stands for Coopération financière en Afrique centrale (\"Financial Cooperation in Central Africa\"). It is issued by the BEAC (Banque des États de l'Afrique Centrale, \"Bank of the Central African States\"), located in Yaoundé, Cameroon, for the members of the CEMAC (Communauté Économique et Monétaire de l'Afrique Centrale, \"Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa\"). The franc is nominally subdivided into 100 centimes but no centime denominations have been issued. In several west African states, the West African CFA franc, which is of equal value to the Central African CFA franc, is in circulation.\n\nThe CFA franc was introduced to the French colonies in Equatorial Africa in 1945, replacing the French Equatorial African franc. The Equatorial African colonies and territories using the CFA franc were Chad, French Cameroun, French Congo, Gabon and Ubangi-Shari.\n\nThe currency continued in use when these colonies gained their independence. Equatorial Guinea, the only former Spanish colony in the zone, adopted the CFA franc in 1985, replacing the Equatorial Guinean ekwele at a rate of 1 franc = 4 bipkwele.\n\nThe Central African CFA franc is of equal value to the West African CFA franc. They are both called the CFA franc.

The CFA franc was introduced to the French colonies in Central Africa on 26 December 1945, replacing the French Equatorial African franc. The Central African CFA franc (French: franc CFA; Portuguese/Spanish: franco CFA or simply franc, ISO 4217 code: XAF) was introduced. From 1946 to 1958, the acronym CFA Franc was known as \"Franc des Colonies Françaises d'Afrique\". In 1958 it became \"Communauté Française d'Afrique\" and from 1962 as \"Communauté Financière d'Afrique\" (Financial Community of Africa) or \"Communauté Financière Africaine\" (African Financial Community). In 1960, an attempt was made to form a union of the newly independent republics of Chad, Congo, Central Africa\n\nand Gabon. The proposal was discarded when Chad refused to become a constituent member. The four countries then linked into an Equatorial Customs Unit, to which Cameroon became an associate member in 1961. A more extensive cooperation of the five republics, identified as the Central African Customs and Economic Union (CEMAC), was entered into force at the beginning of 1966. In 1985, Equatorial Guinea also was allowed to join CEMAC.\n\n12 June 1973: Madagascar leaves CFA franc and begins issuing its own francs (1 ariary = 5 Malagasy francs).\n\n1974: Saint-Pierre and Miquelon leaves CFA franc for French franc.\n\n01 January 1975: Réunion leaves CFA franc for French franc.\n\n1976: Mayotte leaves CFA franc for French franc.\n\n23 November 1979: The government of Comoros signed the Accord de coopération monétaire entre la République Française et la République fédérale islamique des Comores, a monetary cooperation agreement with France, making Comoros part of the franc zone (but not part of the CFA franc zone).\n\n01 January 1985: Equatorial Guinea adopts Central CFA franc.\n\nCFA Franc pegging:\n\n26 December 1945: CFA Franc = 1.70 French Francs.\n\n17 December 1948: CFA Franc = 2 French Francs.\n\n01 January 1959: 50 CFA Francs = (New) French Franc.\n\n12 January 1994: 100 CFA Francs = French Franc.\n\n01 January 1999: 655.957 CFA Franc = Euro.\n\nFrench Chief engravers (Graveurs généraux): The functions of the Graveur général of the Mint of France was instituted by Henry III involves the production and the delivery of all the dies used in the mints of the French state.\n\nLucien Bazor, 1931-1958, wing (aile).\n\nRaymond Joly, 1958-1974, owl (chouette).\n\nEmile Rousseau, 1974-1994, dolphin (dauphin).\n\nPierre Rodier, 1994 - 2000, bee (abeille).\n\nGérard Burqoy, 2001 - 2002, horseshoe (fer à cheval).\n\nSerge Levet, 2003, Heart with L.S.

Most of them got melted while a few samples survived. All these three coins had hole in the center and were dated 1943.\n\n\"Honneur - Patrie\" (Honour, Fatherland) is the motto of the Légion d'honneur. It has been inscribed on military flags under the First French Empire, and also became the motto of the French Navy from 1830. \"Valeur - Discipline\" (Valour, Discipline) was inscribed on military flags under the late First Empire; fallen in disuse under the Bourbon Restauration, is reappeared on the flags of the French Second Republic and on the reverse of the Médaille militaire. Probably under the Second French Empire, these two mottos fused and became features of French naval ships.\n\nFree France and its Free French Forces (French: France Libre and Forces françaises libres) were the government-in-exile led by Charles de Gaulle during the Second World War and its military forces, that continued to fight against the Axis powers as one of the Allies after the fall of France. Set up in London in June 1940, it organized and supported the Resistance in occupied France. The Free French fought Axis and Vichy regime troops and served on battlefronts everywhere from the Middle East to Indochina and North Africa. The Free French Navy operated as an auxiliary force to the Royal Navy and, in the North Atlantic, to the Royal Canadian Navy. Free French units also served in the Royal Air Force, Soviet Air Force, and British SAS, before larger commands were established directly under the control of the government-in-exile. Capital: Brazzaville (19401943) and then Algiers (19431944). London was Seat of the French National Committee.\n\nKM#2 / Schön#5 Franc. Year: 1942. Weight: 5.55g [5.55g]. Metal: Brass.

UDEAC signed a treaty for the establishment of CEMAC to promote the entire process of sub-regional integration through the forming of monetary union with the Central Africa CFA franc as a common currency; it was officially superseded by CEMAC in June 1999 (through agreement from 1994).\n\nCEMAC's objectives are the promotion of trade, the institution of a genuine common market, and greater solidarity among peoples and towards under-privileged countries and regions. In 1994, it succeeded in introducing quota restrictions and reductions in the range and amount of tariffs. Currently, CEMAC countries share a common financial, regulatory, and legal structure, and maintain a common external tariff on imports from non-CEMAC countries. In theory, tariffs have been eliminated on trade within CEMAC, but full implementation of this has been delayed. Movement of capital within CEMAC is free.\n\nKM#16 / Schön#27 Franc. Year: 2006.
