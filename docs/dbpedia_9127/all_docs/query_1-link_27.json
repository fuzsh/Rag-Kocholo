But Central African CFA francs are not available at most banks or the Post Office.\n\nIn the UK, you’ll have the best chances of finding Central African CFA francs (XAF) from the following places:\n\nCurrency Exchange Offices\n\nCurrency exchange offices and kiosks at airports, train stations, and city centres offer foreign currency exchange services. You can visit these locations to buy Central African CFA francs. Beware, the rates in airports are notoriously bad.\n\nOnline Currency Exchange Platforms\n\nThere are online currency exchange platforms and websites (like ours!) that allow you to order foreign currency online. You can choose to have it delivered to your home or office. Be sure to choose a reputable platform with competitive exchange rates.\n\nWe recommend you look no further; our rates are the best in the UK.\n\nTravel Agencies\n\nSome travel agencies also offer foreign currency exchange services to their customers.

It’s advisable to compare rates and inquire about additional charges before exchanging your currency. This makes sure that you get the best value for your money.\n\nShould I exchange money before I travel to Central Africa?\n\nYes, exchanging some money before you travel to Central Africa is generally advisable. Here are a few reasons why exchanging cash before your trip can be a good idea:\n\nImmediate Expenses\n\nHaving some local currency on hand when you arrive in Central Africa can be helpful. It covers immediate expenses like transport, meals, and small purchases. Not all places accept credit or debit cards, so having cash is essential.\n\nConvenience\n\nExchanging money in advance saves you the hassle of searching for a currency exchange office or ATM as soon as you arrive. Especially if you land late at night or in a remote area.\n\nBetter Exchange Rates\n\nYou may find more favourable exchange rates when you exchange currency in your home country rather than at a foreign destination.\n\nEmergency Funds\n\nA small amount of local currency can be a backup in case your cards don’t work. It provides peace of mind in unexpected situations.\n\nAvoid Airport Fees\n\nCurrency exchange services at airports often charge higher fees and offer less favourable rates than those in the city. Exchanging some money before you depart can help you avoid these extra costs.\n\nYou don’t need to exchange all your money before your trip, though. It’s a good idea to use cash and cards for flexibility.\n\nDo I need cash in Central Africa?\n\nYes, having cash in Central Africa is advisable, as it can be essential for various purposes.\n\nElectronic payment methods like credit and debit cards are becoming more widely accepted in urban areas. But cash still remains crucial for many situations in Central Africa:\n\nRural Areas. In rural or less developed areas, cash is often the primary and sometimes the only accepted form of payment. Small towns and villages may not have access to electronic payment systems.\n\nLocal Markets. Cash is typically the preferred method of payment when shopping at local markets, street vendors, or small shops. Many sellers may not have the infrastructure to accept card payments.\n\nTransport. Taxis, buses, and other forms of public transportation often require cash payments. If you plan to travel within Central Africa, having cash for fares is essential.\n\nEmergency Situations. Cash serves as a valuable backup. It can help cover unexpected expenses or emergencies.\n\nATM Availability. While major cities may have ATMs where you can withdraw local currency, they may not always be readily accessible. ATM networks can be less reliable in some regions.\n\nNegotiation. In some situations, particularly in markets or when dealing with informal services, the ability to negotiate prices requires cash. Having cash can give you more bargaining power.\n\nTo ensure you have the right amount of cash, exchange travel money for Central African CFA francs (XAF) before you travel.\n\nThis way, you’ll be ready for cash-based transactions when needed. Be mindful of security and keep your cash safe while travelling to avoid potential issues.\n\nWhat is the best currency to bring to Central Africa?\n\nThe best currency to bring to Central Africa depends on your preferences and travel plans. However, we recommend you bring a mix of the following.\n\nCentral African CFA franc (XAF)\n\nThis is the official currency used in most Central African countries, including Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. Some XAF in cash is essential, especially for local transactions, transport, and small purchases.\n\nUS dollars (USD)\n\nUSD is widely accepted in Central Africa, especially in larger cities and tourist places. It can serve as a helpful backup currency. Ensure that your USD bills are in good condition; old bills may not be accepted.\n\nEuros (EUR)\n\nEuros are also accepted in some places, particularly in countries with historical ties to European nations. Check the local acceptance of Euros before bringing them.\n\nCredit and Debit Cards\n\nWhile not as universally accepted as cash, credit and debit cards can be used for larger expenses and in more urban areas. Visa and Mastercard are generally more widely accepted than other card networks.\n\nLocal Currency\n\nIt’s best to use the local currency for day-to-day expenses whenever possible. It ensures you get the most accurate and fair prices.\n\nHaving a mix of the above currencies ensures you are prepared for various situations.\n\nCan I use my bank card in Central Africa?\n\nYes, you can generally use your bank card in Central Africa. International debit and credit cards, mainly VISA and Mastercard, are accepted by some international hotels and large shopping malls in larger cities in Central Africa. (Such as Bangui, Bata, Brazzaville, Doala, Libreville, N’Djamena, Pointe-Noire and Yaounde.)\n\nMost of the local vendors don’t accept international card payments, though. They only accept cash payments via mobile payment solutions such as MTM Mobile Money (nicknamed ‘momo’).\n\nIf you want to use your bank card, there are some important considerations to keep in mind:\n\nAcceptance\n\nMajor credit and debit card networks like Visa and Mastercard are more widely accepted in urban areas. However, the acceptance of cards is less likely in smaller towns and more rural areas.\n\nATMs\n\nYou can use your bank card to withdraw local currency (Central African CFA francs, XAF) from ATMs in major cities. You’ll find ATMs at banks and in commercial areas.\n\nBe prepared for occasional challenges, such as limited availability or technical issues with ATMs, especially in more remote regions.\n\nInform your bank\n\nBefore travelling to Central Africa, it’s essential to inform your bank of your travel plans. This will help prevent your card transactions flagging as potentially fraudulent when used abroad. Provide your bank with your travel dates and the countries you plan to visit.\n\nCurrency conversion fees\n\nCheck with your bank about any foreign transaction fees or currency conversion fees associated with using your card abroad. These fees can vary among different banks and card issuers.\n\nCard security\n\nBe vigilant about card security. Use ATMs in well-lit and secure locations. Cover your PIN when entering it, and keep an eye on your card during transactions.\n\nIt’s also a good idea to have a backup payment method, such as cash or another card, in case your primary card is lost or stolen.\n\nCash for smaller expenses\n\nWhile cards are convenient for larger expenses, having cash (local currency) on hand is necessary. Especially for smaller purchases, transportation, and in case, you visit areas where card acceptance is limited.\n\nCheck Card Compatibility\n\nEnsure your card has a chip and a PIN, which are often necessary for card transactions in Central Africa.\n\nHow much cash should I take to Central Africa?\n\nIt depends. Here are rough daily spending ranges for tourists in Central Africa, including budget, midrange, and luxury options. Keep in mind that these figures can vary depending on the specific country within Central Africa and individual preferences:\n\nBudget Traveler:\n\nAccommodation: £15 – £38\n\nFood: £8 – £16 (eating at local eateries, street food)\n\nTransportation: £4 – £12 (using public transportation, shared taxis)\n\nActivities/Entrance Fees: £4 – £12 (visiting local attractions, cultural activities)\n\nTotal: £31 – £78 per day\n\nMidrange Traveler:\n\nAccommodation: £38 – £115 (midrange hotels, boutique lodges)\n\nFood: £16 – £38 (eating at midrange restaurants)\n\nTransportation: £16 – £38 (including occasional taxi rides)\n\nActivities/Entrance Fees: £12 – £38 (guided tours, cultural experiences)\n\nTotal: £82 – £229 per day\n\nLuxury Traveler:\n\nAccommodation: £115 and above (luxury hotels, eco-lodges)\n\nFood: £38 and above (fine dining, gourmet experiences)\n\nTransportation: £38 and above (private transfers, car rentals)\n\nActivities/Entrance Fees: £38 and above (exclusive safaris, private guides)\n\nTotal: £229 and above per day\n\nBe sure to research the cost of living in your chosen destination to create a budget that aligns with your travel plans. Additionally, consider budgeting for other expenses such as visas, travel insurance, and souvenirs.\n\nIs life expensive in Central Africa?\n\nThe Central African CFA monetary union consists of six countries. Consequently, prices are different depending on which country you visit.\n\nA coffee in a cafe in Cameroon will cost around 1,500 CFA francs (£2). For a three-course meal in a Cameroonian mid-range restaurant, you can expect to pay about 10,000 CFA francs per person (£13).\n\nPrices in Central Africa are certainly lower than prices in the UK. The overall cost of living in Cameroon is 50% lower than in the UK.\n\nHow does tipping work in Central Africa?\n\nTipping customs in Central Africa vary from country to country and may also depend on the specific service or situation.\n\nRestaurants and Cafes: In most Central African countries, tipping at restaurants and cafes is not obligatory but appreciated. If a service charge is not included in the bill (often the case), you can leave a tip of around 5-10% of the total bill if you’re satisfied with the service. However, checking if a service charge has already been added is important, as it varies by establishment.\n\nHotels: Tipping hotel staff is a common practice. You can tip the bellhop who helps with your luggage, the housekeeping staff who clean your room, and the concierge for assistance. Small denominations of local currency (Central African CFA francs, XAF) are usually appreciated. You can leave a few XAF for each service provided.\n\nTour Guides and Drivers: When you take guided tours or hire drivers for excursions, it’s customary to tip them. The amount can vary depending on the length and complexity of the tour or service, but a guideline is to offer a tip of 10-20% of the cost.\n\nTaxis: Tipping taxi drivers is not as common in Central Africa as it is in some other regions. However, consider rounding up the fare or offering a small tip for excellent service.\n\nPorters and Baggage Handlers: At airports, bus stations, or train stations, there are often porters or baggage handlers available to assist you. You can tip them a small amount for their services.\n\nCentral African Currency\n\nBanknotes in Central Africa\n\nCentral Africa uses a common currency, the Central African CFA franc (XAF). The currency is shared by six Central African countries that are part of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC).\n\nThis is a subregion of the larger Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS). The countries using the Central African CFA franc are Cameroon, the Central African Republic (CAR), Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea (only the mainland region) and Gabon.\n\nThe Central African CFA franc banknotes are available in various denominations, including 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, and 10,000 XAF. Each denomination features different colours and designs, making it easy to distinguish between them.\n\nThe banknotes feature various elements that highlight the cultural and natural heritage of the Central African region. These elements often include images of local wildlife, traditional art, and notable landmarks.\n\nBanknotes are used extensively and may, in many cases, be well-worn and dirty. Wash your hands often.\n\nCoins in Central Africa\n\nCentral African CFA franc coins come in various denominations, including 1fr, 2fr, 5fr, 10fr, 25 fr, 50 fr, and 100fr.\n\nThe design of Central African CFA franc coins often features national symbols, historical figures, local flora and fauna, or cultural elements representing the countries within the CEMAC region.\n\nCentral African CFA franc coins are typically made of metals like nickel, brass, and copper. The material and weight of the coins correspond to their denominations.\n\nCentral Africa’s currency import and export regulations\n\nBringing money in and out of Central Africa, specifically the countries within the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC), involves specific currency regulations and limits.\n\nCameroon\n\nWhen entering Cameroon, travellers must declare any amount of local or foreign currency that exceeds XAF 1,000,000 or its equivalent in other currencies.\n\nWhen leaving Cameroon, travellers are obliged to declare any foreign or local currency that surpasses XAF 1,000,000 or its equivalent in other currencies.\n\nThe Central African Republic\n\nUpon entering the Central African Republic, travellers must declare any amount of currency, whether local or foreign, exceeding XAF 1,000,000 or equivalent in other currencies. Failing to declare amounts above this threshold may result in confiscation or penalties.\n\nWhen departing from the Central African Republic, travellers must declare any amount of local or foreign currency exceeding XAF 1,000,000 or its equivalent in other currencies.\n\nChad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon\n\nUpon entering any of these four countries, travellers must declare any amount of local or foreign currency exceeding a specified threshold.\n\nWhen departing, travellers must declare any amount of foreign or local currency that surpasses a specified threshold.\n\nThe specific currency import and export limits can vary over time and may be subject to change.\n\nThese limits can vary based on local regulations and policies. Obtaining the most up-to-date information directly from the authorities before your trip is crucial.\n\nTravellers are generally discouraged from taking excessive amounts of local currency outside the Central African monetary union.\n\nOrdering Central Africa CFA Francs online\n\nOrder Central African CFA francs (XAF) online.
