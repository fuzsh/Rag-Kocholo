        "text": "Looking to send money back home to Cameroon? Understanding the country's currencies is essential. The Central African CFA franc (CFA) and the Central African CFA franc (XAF) are the primary currencies used in Cameroon. Let's explore the history and use cases of these currencies.\n\nThe Central African CFA Franc (CFA)\n\nâ\n\nThe Central African CFA Franc (CFA): The Central African CFA franc (CFA) is a common currency used by six countries in Central Africa, including Cameroon.
