        "text": "CFA Franc Could Lose Half its Members\n\nThe President of Senegal, elected in February 2020, has announced plans to withdraw from the CFA franc.\n\nThe CFA franc is the name of not one but two currencies: the West African CFA franc (XOF) used by Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo, and the Central African CFA (XAF) used by Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic, Congo Republic, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. Both currencies are pegged to the euro with an exchange rate of XOF/XAF 655 = â‚¬ 1. France guarantees the peg, counterpart members are required to hold half of their foreign reserves with the Banque de France, and a French official sits on the board of both central banks. In 2019, both conditions were dropped for the West African Monetary Union, and a name change from CFA to Eco was announced. However, no progress has been made about the new name.\n\nIn September 2023, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger founded the Alliance of Sahel States and announced their withdrawal from the Economic Community of Western African States (ECOWAS) after military juntas overthrew the governments of the three states. The three countries have indicated their intention to drop the CFA franc, but no clear plans have been made since then.\n\nThe CFA has been increasingly criticised in Africa by public opinion and economists. It is viewed by many as a relic of colonialism. Initially, the CFA franc stood for Franc of the French Colonies of Africa, though it was recently changed to Franc of the Financial Community of Africa. And the foreign reserves of the participating countries stored in the vaults of the Banque de France were a potent symbol of post-colonialism. Some economists argued that the peg to the euro removed monetary and fiscal independence and had failed to boost regional trade. The inability to devalue the currency has prevented economic development by maintaining an artificially high exchange rate. Proponents of the CFA franc believed that it had ensured economic stability and controlled inflation."
