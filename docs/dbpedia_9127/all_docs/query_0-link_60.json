        "text": "Equatorial Guinea was administered by the Portuguese as part of their African colony of Angola from the 1500s to 1778. Portugal transferred control of Equatorial Guinea to Spain in 1778 under the Treaty of San Ildefonso. Although Portuguese coins had circulated under Portuguese rule, Spanish coins became the predominant currency after 1778.\n\nSettlement on Fernando Pó (now Bioko) began in 1844, and it was administered by the British from 1827 to 1844. Although British coins were legal tender, Spanish and Latin American silver dollars also circulated.\n\nThe mainland portion of Equatorial Guinea became a Spanish colony in 1885. After the Spanish-American War of 1898, Equatorial Guinea became the only Spanish colony distant from Spain. Fernando Pó, Annobon and Rio Muni were united to form Gulf of Guinea, renamed Spanish Guinea in 1926. Spanish Guinea was renamed Equatorial Guinea on December 15, 1963, and it gained its independence as the Republic of Equatorial Guinea on October 12, 1968.\n\nDuring the period of British administration, British coins and French 5-franc coins were probably in use. The Spanish law of June 26, 1864 mandated the use of Spanish coins in Spanish colonies. Spanish Pesetas (ESP) were used in the colony until October 12, 1968 when the Equatorial Guinea Peseta (GQP) replaced the Spanish Peseta at par. No coins were issued for Equatorial Guinea until 1969. The Peseta Guineana was replaced by the Ekuele Guineana (GQE) on July 7, 1975 at par. The spelling was changed to Epkwele (plural bipkwele) in 1979.\n\nEquatorial Guinea became part of the CFA Franc Zone on January 1, 1985 when it introduced the Equatorial Guinea Franco (GQF) at par with the BCEAC Franc and equal to 4 Ekuele Guineana. Since January 1, 1993, Equatorial Guinea has used the CFA Franco BCEAC as its currency (XAF-N). Equatorial Guinea notes have the letter √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚ÄúN√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù on them to 2003 and √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚ÄúF√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù beginning in 2004.\n\nThe Peseta and Ekuele were divisible into 100 Centimos. The Franco is divisible into 100 Centimes. Banknotes of the Banco de Espana were used while Equatorial Guinea was a Spanish colony. Banknotes were issued by the Banco Central from 1969 until 1975, by the Banco Popular from 1975 until 1979, by the Banco de Guinea Ecuatorial from 1979 until 1985, and by the Banque des Etats de l'Afrique Central from 1985 on."
