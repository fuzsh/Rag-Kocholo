        "text": "Economy of Equatorial Guinea\n\ninEquatorial Guinea\n\nEquatorial Guinea’s economy traditionally depended on three commodities—cocoa (from the cacao tree), coffee, and timber—but the discovery and exploitation of petroleum and natural gas changed the country’s economic profile virtually overnight in the 1980s. Petroleum now accounts for the vast majority of Equatorial Guinea’s exports and contributes more than four-fifths of its gross domestic product (GDP). Nevertheless, the standard of living of most people has not significantly improved, and farming continues to be the predominant occupation.\n\nAgriculture, forestry, and fishing\n\nHead Of Government:\n\nPrime Minister: Manuela Roka Botey\n\nPopulation:\n\n(2024 est.) 1,669,000\n\nHead Of State:\n\nPresident: Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo\n\nForm Of Government:\n\nrepublic with two legislative houses (Chamber of Deputies [100]; Senate [761])\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 16, 2024, 6:36 AM ET (Reuters)\n\nNigeria and Equatorial Guinea sign gas pipeline project\n\nJuly 25, 2024, 5:20 AM ET (BBC)\n\nEmilio Nsue and Equatorial Guinea appeal Fifa eligibility ruling\n\nJuly 23, 2024, 1:48 AM ET (Daily Maverick)\n\nEquatorial Guinea wants properties back before freeing two jailed SA engineers\n\nJuly 20, 2024, 12:09 AM ET (Voice of America)\n\nAfrican aviation conference ends with pledges to improve travel\n\nBefore independence, the Spanish subsidized cocoa and coffee exports to Spain. The high-quality cocoa was the mainstay of the economy of Bioko, which possessed the right soil and climate for its intensive cultivation. Most of Equatorial Guinea’s cocoa is still produced on the island. As with other commodities, production suffered under the postindependence regime of Francisco Macías Nguema: Nigerian and local workers left the cocoa plantations; maintenance, output, and quality declined; and cocoa exports dropped to one-tenth of their former level. Exports of coffee almost ceased from island and mainland plantations, an exception being the small production of robusta coffee by Fang farmers in Río Muni.\n\nToday, despite the changes in the economy wrought by the dramatic growth of the petroleum industry, the majority of people are still employed in agriculture. Many are subsistence farmers who clear the land by burning off the vegetation cover. Among the crops grown are cassava (manioc), sweet potatoes, oil palm fruit, plantains, bananas, coconuts, coffee, and cacao. Sheep, goats, pigs, and cattle are raised. Fishing contributes to the economy as well, and the timber industry remains significant.\n\nResources\n\nSubstantial reserves of petroleum and natural gas exist under the seafloor of Equatorial Guinea’s offshore waters. Once they began to be exploited in the late 20th century, hydrocarbons quickly dominated the economy. Petroleum soon became the primary export, and the country’s GDP increased dramatically in less than a decade; it continued to grow in the early 21st century. Deposits of gold, titanium, manganese, iron ore, and uranium exist but remain largely undeveloped.\n\nFinance and trade\n\nA major economic reorientation took place in December 1983, when Equatorial Guinea joined the Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa (which later became part of the Economic Community of Central African States). In January 1985 the country entered the Franc Zone, whereby its currency, the epkwele (formerly linked to the Spanish peseta), was replaced by the CFA (Communauté Financière Africaine) franc and linked to the French franc. With the phasing out of the French franc during 1999–2002, the CFA franc became linked to the euro.\n\nFollowing the economic collapse of the mid-1970s, imports came to exceed exports. The gap was narrowed only by external aid—including large subsidies from Spain and help from many other countries and international agencies—which increased after the coup in 1979. With the rapid expansion of the oil industry in the 1980s and ’90s, however, the value of the country’s exports exceeded that of its imports by the end of the 20th century; the balance of trade remained positive into the 21st century. The United States, China, Japan, Spain, and France, among others, are major trade partners of Equatorial Guinea.\n\nTransportation\n\nAt the turn of the 21st century, less than one-sixth of the country’s roads were paved. The road network on the mainland was adequate for the light traffic it was required to carry before independence, but it deteriorated in the 1970s. Bata is linked with the coastal town of Mbini by a tarred road. There is also a cross-country road from Bata, branching at Niefang and Ncue, to Ebebiyín, Mongomo, and Nsoc near the Cameroon frontier. On Bioko the road system is of a higher standard, with a semicircular tarred road linking Malabo and Luba to the eastern Bubi villages. There are no railways in the country.\n\nThe main ports are Malabo and Bata; the latter’s harbour was enlarged and modernized in the 1980s to accommodate a growing share of the country’s commerce. The mainland coastal settlements of Mbini and Kogo (Cogo) are minor ports of call. There are international airports at Malabo and Bata as well as several regional airports. National airlines have been unsuccessful.\n\nGovernment and society\n\nConstitutional framework\n\nUnder the constitution of 1991, since amended, Equatorial Guinea is a republic. Executive power is vested in the president, who is elected by direct universal suffrage for a seven-year term, with a limit of two terms. The president appoints the vice president, the prime minister, and the Council of Ministers. The legislature is bicameral, consisting of the Chamber of Deputies, members of which are directly elected to five-year terms, and the Senate, the majority of its members being directly elected and the rest appointed by the president and all of them serving five-year terms.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Justice in Malabo is the highest judicial authority. There are also subordinate courts. The Constitutional Court sits in Malabo\n\nFor administrative purposes, the country is divided into two régiones (regions), which are subdivided into provincias (provinces); the provinces are further divided into districts and municipalities.\n\nPolitical process\n\nThe ruling party in Equatorial Guinea is the Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea (Partido Democrático de Guinea Ecuatorial; PDGE), formed in 1987. It was the only political party until 1991, when a new constitution allowing opposition parties was adopted. Since then several other parties have formed, including the Convergence for Social Democracy (Convergencia para la Democracia Social; CPDS) and the Popular Union (Unión Popular; UP). Opposition parties do not wield much influence in the government, however, as Pres. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo—in office since overthrowing Francisco Macías Nguema in 1979—exercises extensive power. Obiang has won every election since taking office; likewise, the PDGE has maintained a decisive majority in the legislature. Many observers have criticized the country’s presidential and parliamentary elections as being irregular or fraudulent.\n\nEducation\n\nEducation is compulsory and free for all children ages 6 to 11. Efforts have been made to improve educational opportunities, and illiteracy has declined over the years; well more than four-fifths of the population is literate. The National University of Equatorial Guinea is located in Malabo."
