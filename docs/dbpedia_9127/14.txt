The Central African CFA franc, represented by the currency code XAF, is the official currency used in six Central African states that form the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC): Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. The Bank of Central African States (BEAC) issues and manages the Central African CFA franc.

The Central African CFA franc was established in 1945, at the end of the Second World War, when France ratified the Bretton Woods Agreements and proceeded to implement the currency in its African colonies. The CFA stands for "Coopération financière en Afrique centrale" (Financial Cooperation in Central Africa).
