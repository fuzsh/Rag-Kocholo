        "text": "Analogue Productions (Atlantic 75 Series)\n\nCelebrating the 75th Anniversary of Atlantic Records!\n\nDéjà Vu — CSNY's first album as a quartet, No. 1 on the Billboard 200!\n\n180-gram 45 RPM double LP\n\nMastered directly from the original master tape by Chris Bellman at Bernie Grundman Mastering\n\nPressed at Quality Record Pressings\n\nTip-on old style gatefold double pocket jacket with textured stock by Stoughton Printing\n\n\"Déjà Vu\" is the title track to Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young's first album as a quartet. With Neil Young now in the mix, the album reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 after its release in March 1970. The album remains a high point for the supergroup, having sold more than 7 million copies. Also on the record are hit singles \"Teach Your Children,\" \"Our House,\" and a cover of Joni Mitchell's \"Woodstock.\"\n\nThe late David Crosby penned \"Déjà Vu\" for the group. Though it wasn't released as a single, it gave that iconic album its name and has subsequently received its fair share of love from CSNY fans.\n\n\"I'm one of those people who thinks we go round again,\" said Crosby back in 2008. \"The Buddhists have got it right. It's a wheel and we get on and get off. I think life energy gets recycled. That's why I wrote ‘Déjà Vu.'\"\n\nCSNY took a while to craft the album-which is largely considered their magnum opus. \"Getting that second album out of us was like pulling teeth, there was song after song that didn't make it,\" Stephen Stills once said. \"The track ‘Déjà Vu' must have meant 100 takes in the studio. But ‘Carry On' happened in a grand total of eight hours from conception to finished master. So you never know.\"\n\nAll the hallmarks of a top-notch Analogue Productions reissue are here for you to savor: Mastered directly from the original master tape by Chris Bellman at Bernie Grundman Mastering and cut at 45 RPM. Pressed at Quality Record Pressings, and housed in a tip-on old style gatefold double pocket jacket with textured stock by Stoughton Printing."
