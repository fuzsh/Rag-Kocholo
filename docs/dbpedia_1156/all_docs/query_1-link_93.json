In 100 years, they'll only be talking about Bob Dylan, the Beatles, maybe the Rolling Stones, and definitely Joni.\n\nGraham Nash praises Joni Mitchell, with whom he duets on Our House on an expanded reissue of CSNY's Deja Vu\n\nBacked by Nash’s Our House and Teach Your Children, Young’s Helpless and Country Girl, David Crosby’s title track and Almost Cut My Hair, and Stills’ Carry On and Woodstock, the album catapulted the newly minted quartet (with Young joining the trio after 1969’s Crosby, Stills & Nash LP) to superstardom and is considered one of the most famous records in rock history.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Deja Vu was a cool thing to be getting into,” Nash recalls. “We were four strong writers and four strong singers. We knew what we wanted to do.”\n\nBut listening back on it, Nash reveals the LP’s sunny harmonies belie its darker origins.\n\n“It was an emotional journey for me, quite frankly,” the British-born singer-songwriter says. “When we were making the first Crosby, Stills and Nash record, before Neil joined us, we were all in love. I was living with Joni Mitchell; Stephen was in love with Judy Collins and David was in love with Christine (Hinton). A year later, when it came time for Deja Vu, I was no longer with Joni, Stephen and Judy had broken up and Christine had been killed in a terrible traffic accident. So, the difference in vibe was overwhelming to me. But I do feel that we put out the best album we could at the time.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nEarlier this spring, Nash spoke more about the 1970 masterpiece, adding Neil Young to their fabled trio, and whether CSNY has sung its final note.\n\nI didn’t know that Neil Young was not part of the group from the beginning. What did Neil bring to Crosby, Stills and Nash?\n\nWe had discovered we had a great sound using three-part harmonies on the first CSN record. But here’s what happened. Stephen Stills played most of the instruments on that first record. So what do you do when one of the members played most of the instruments? You need to build a band around that. David and Stephen were at dinner with Ahmet Ertegun, who was the CEO of Atlantic Records. It was Ahmet who said to Stephen that we should get Neil Young. Ahmet convinced Stephen and David that Neil should be the guy.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nNow Neil brings to CSN a slightly darker edge and a lot of great songs. I personally believe he’s a fine singer and so it was very obvious, even though I had never met him, that he was an option.\n\nSo we were considering bringing Neil into the band and I said to Stephen and David, ‘I don’t know Neil Young … I need to meet this guy if we’re going to invite him to join this band and this harmony structure we’ve created.’\n\nSo we had breakfast here in Manhattan and after that meeting it was obvious that Neil should be in the band. He was very funny, in a dark way, and self-deprecating. But he was confident, and boy, did he have great songs.\n\nThe second album is almost always more important for a band. There’s so much on the line. What was at stake for CSNY?\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe never considered any of that, really. We were just going day-by-day. We were all in bands. I was in the Hollies, Crosby was in the Byrds and Stephen and Neil were in Buffalo Springfield. So we had all been there before and we knew what we were doing in the studio. We tried everything. We didn’t think about how it would affect our (future), we were just a band with songs to sing and record. That’s who we were and that’s what we did.\n\nWhat was it like to make music during a time when you could take chances?\n\nWe were free and what made us free was selling millions of records. When I was in the Hollies in 1963, you couldn’t walk over to the (mixing) board and bring the bass up. That was the engineer’s job. If you wanted more kick drum, you’d have to tell the producer who would tell the engineer. But when you sell millions of records, the power shifts. We were now completely in control of what we did. If I wanted more hi-hat, I didn’t have to go through anyone to do that. We were free. We were selling millions of records and we knew we had a certain amount of power, so we used it.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWhat do you think the legacy of this record is?\n\nEven though it was crazy and there were a lot of drugs and all-night sessions, I think people will recognize that it’s still a decent record. It was chaotic, but we were really proud of the record and I’m glad it came out.\n\nThere’s a version of Our House featuring Joni Mitchell on this reissue. What was it like for you to uncover that?\n\nMy memory of that is we did it at the Philadelphia Music Academy. We were going to play a show and we were doing a soundcheck and Joni was with me, and I started playing the piano to make sure it was coming out of the speakers correctly and the right volume.\n\nI started to play Our House and Joni sat down next to me and started playing with me. We screw up in the middle and have a laugh — I think I swear.\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBut it was a delicious moment.

Did you feel listening back that you should have done more as a band?\n\nNo, I came to a different kind of understanding. Neil Young is a dedicated musician that only answers to the muse of music and when it’s right, he’s there 100%. But when it’s not right, you won’t find Neil around. That’s what we discovered at the end of that album with Neil. An interesting fact that not a lot of people realize is the first Crosby, Stills and Nash show with only the three of us wasn’t until 1977. There are no Crosby, Stills and Nash concerts until 1977. All of them were with Neil before that.\n\nAdvertisement 10\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nGoing through this, did you think CSNY maybe has more to say musically?\n\nWe have to love each other before we can make music and stand to be in the same room together. We have to really like each other and right now we don’t. I still talk to Stephen and Neil, but I don’t think any of us have spoken to David in a year or so.\n\nThe four of you regrouped twice more, for 1989’s American Dream and 1999’s Looking Forward. What did you make of those later CSNY albums?\n\nWe tried our best, but they weren’t as good as the others. I don’t think about them, quite frankly.\n\nNeil is a national treasure up here. Do you have any special memories of playing up in Canada?\n\nThey love rock n’ roll up in Canada and you’re obviously proud of Neil and Joni, of course. There’s a certain national pride of knowing those two Canadian musicians were in the forefront of rock n’ roll at that time. I think Joni is a genius. In 100 years, they’ll only be talking about Bob Dylan, the Beatles, maybe the Rolling Stones, and definitely Joni.\n\nAdvertisement 11\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWhat do you think of today’s music and what do you think the future of music is?\n\nIt’s the same as usual. There’s stuff that you hate that your parents loved. There’s stuff that you’re going to love that your kids won’t like. It’s music. It’s a long chain that stretches way back to a time where someone somewhere banging on a log in a cave right up to Lady Gaga. It’s a continuous stream of music and it’s all linked by chains of history. We all love our idols; I loved Buddy Holly, Elvis Presley, Gene Vincent.\n\nYou try and soak up all that music and bring out your own songs and that’s what we all did. The Hollies were five kids that were supposed to stay in Manchester and do what our dads and grandfathers did, either go work in a mill or in a mine. But in my particular case, my mother and father never allowed me to fall for that and they encouraged my passion for music. I’ll be forever grateful for that.\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young’s Deja Vu box set is available now.\n\nmdaniell@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
