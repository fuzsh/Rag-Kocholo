However, another vital piece of information is that the Pagoda Pacers have a group run tonight that starts at 6:15. It is presently 3:37. Had it been Tuesday, I would have given it a listen while I went out for a run on my own. Then, I would have listened to it as I wrote the review, jumping back through the songs until I had what I needed. However, no music on the group run. Therefore, aside from an edit or two, this review will be song to song on the first take.\n\nGoose is an indie groove band from Connecticut. While they try to avoid the term jam band, they also do not deny it. Phish is an influence, as is Umphrey’s McGee, and the Grateful Dead. Still, their improv and jams have more indie rock and trance influence than funk and progressive rock or jazz and blues.\n\nIntroduction over, let’s start this experience.\n\nDripfield by Goose * 10 songs * 59.37 run time\n\n“Borne”\n\nWatching them live, I look around at other fans, and my head is bobbing. I know that I will eventually start to dance, but I am patient and waiting for that moment.\n\nThis is a good opener. It is not demanding my attention; it is gracious and courteous. Although it wants me to be a fan, it lets me move in my own time.\n\nI am attentive, listening to the lyrics and absorbing the music.\n\nI heard Phish in the transition to the next song.\n\n“Hungersite”\n\nThis is the summer album I have not heard this year. Of course, that’s true. Goose is going to some of the biggest festivals. It is a big year for them. (That statement made me smile. YKIYK.)\n\nWhen I was twenty, I went to my first music festival. It was Hookaville Spring 1997 at Alpine Hills. I cannot explain it, but this song gives me déjà vu of that weekend.\n\nI like the break in music at the five-minute mark. Some of my friends hate those moments, but I think that second allows the world to come back in.\n\nThe transition into the next song is a jam band technique, and I like it a lot.\n\n“Dripfield”\n\nOk. It is dark now, and I am starting to dance. The drums. Here we go. A little Grateful Dead, Blues for Allah era.\n\nThese are the moments at a show when time becomes singular. Everything is one point. Think of what Phillip K. Dick said. We are everything and everyone, every moment at once. No, I am not on drugs. It is the trance dance. It is transcendental.\n\nI open my eyes and look at my friend as he dances. We are in time, our time, swirling bodies of energy. I wonder what the band sees. Sometimes, I believe I stand out, and they know I am here.\n\nThe transition starts at about the six-minute mark. I do not want the song to end, but I also want to know what they are playing next. Time has made itself known.\n\n“Slow Ready”\n\nI am no longer dancing; I am looking up at the stage. This song is sentimental, and I am a very romantic man. I cannot help but think about my children. I want them to know me.\n\nThe rhythm is hypnotic and contagious. It is the clicking of my brain, the beating tick of a clock.\n\nThe guitar solo is as sentimental as the lyrics. And I just listen.\n\nSometimes, the thoughts a song brings to our minds are not bad. Listen to them. Do not be afraid.\n\n“The Whales”\n\nThank you. I needed this song. It is a travel song. On the road.\n\nThis song is reminiscent of the Grateful Dead without being a Dead song. Maybe it is the guitar, the full sound, the chords. I don’t know, but it has Bob Weir written all over it.\n\nAt the 3:15 mark, it feels like this song is over. However, we’ve only reached the halfway point.\n\nOk. Yes. Keep going. Stretch this part out.\n\nThe 4:05 mark takes us in another direction. I really like this song. Like I said, it is a great road song. Make sure you listen to it on the way to see Goose at Peach Music Festival in Scranton, PA. Or driving to Red Rocks. When is that show? I’ve never seen one there. Maybe I can make it.\n\nThat ends the first half.\n\n“Arrow”\n\nI just listened for the first 30 seconds. I cannot help smiling.\n\nAt the fictional show, I am looking around. People are cheering and dancing. Then…\n\nReflective…\n\nBut I love it because I have been to enough shows. I know there is going to be a build.\n\nThere it is. This is the point when the real dancing begins. Everything before now was a warm-up. We still have not hit the climax of this album, but we are moving without thought. We are…Oh, shit, look at that kid…he’s lifting off the ground.\n\nReflective…did I just see what I thought I saw? I close my eyes to watch it again.\n\nThis album has kept my attention the entire time.\n\n“Hot Tea”\n\nThe intro to this song might be my favorite. Who am I kidding? I cannot remember any of the songs. They all blend together at this point. At least, that is what the young, twenty-some Jesse believes. My present self takes notes. But, I may be distracted by this little bit of electronica funk.\n\nYep, this is my favorite song so far.\n\nOk, I am really dancing. My dog, Lizzie, is staring at me. She wants me to pick her up so she can dance, too.\n\nHave you ever seen a dachshund dance? She looks serious, but a smile is hidden in that concentration.\n\nGo, Lizzie. Go, Lizzie. Go, Lizzie.\n\n“Moonrise”\n\nOk. I just stopped writing and listened to the last two minutes of “Hot Tea.” There is a moment that reminds me of Rocky and Pink Floyd’s Wish You Were Here. How strange is that? Then, I looked ahead and noticed “Moonrise” is only two and a half minutes long. I cannot spend the entire song writing about the end of Hot Tea.\n\nThis is a very sweet-sounding song. However, I cannot tell if the lyrics are telling the same story. Remember, this is my very first listen.\n\nI like it.\n\n“Honeybee”\n\nProgressive intro. As it builds, I realize that I am really digging this album. However, I do not know if I can nail it down. It brings too many thoughts, and a lot is not necessarily about music. I wish I could say who they remind me of. Still, as I stated earlier, the sound is comfortable, non-offensive, and non-aggressive.\n\nA lot is happening musically, and I am drawn to music like this. Especially when the musicians are skilled. Plus, I like the piano.\n\nI like this. The piano takes me to Pink Floyd’s Atom Heart Mother.\n\nI am not exaggerating. The more I listen to this album, the better it gets. I feel at home with it and know I must get a vinyl.\n\n“726”\n\nI cannot believe that I have written as much as I have. This should have been one of my shortest reviews, but now, it is the longest by far.\n\nOk. The beginning of this song is slower and lets me reflect a little more. Goose is already playing some big arena shows. It will be exciting to see what they do with the next couple of years. Are they going to push it and really build a following? They have the opportunity to set up their future. This album is good, and like most touring bands, I am sure it does not even compare to seeing them live.\n\nTo the band, keep your wits about you. You are solid musicians. As the shows grow, remember who you are and continue challenging yourself to be more. But remember what you wanted in the beginning. I am not claiming to know what that is, but as a whole, as a group, it feels like you want to bring a good vibe back into this world. Keep it up. Keep moving forward. And hopefully, I will see you at Red Rocks.\n\nFinal Thought:\n\nThat was a journey, which I had expected it to be. A little stream-of-consciousness writing from me, but I hope it gave a feel. I was impressed because I was nervous when I wrote what I would do. I will send this review out with a score and a reason, but I will also go back and listen to this album a couple more times after sending this to my editor.\n\nFavorite Songs: “Hungersite,” “Hot Tea,” and “Honeybee”\n\nRating - 5/5 because I loved it and because it is the first Summer Album of 2022"
