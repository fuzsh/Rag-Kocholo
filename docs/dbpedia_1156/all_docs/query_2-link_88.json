From 'Crazy in Love' to 'Break My Soul', Beyoncé has sung some of the most iconic songs ever and whether you feel in love, heartbroken or Sasha Fierce, she has an album for it.\n\nGiven just how big Beyoncé's discography is, it can be hard to keep track of how many records she has released. But, look no further, as we've listed all of Beyonce's albums in order and listed the full track list for each one.

Queen Bey officially announced her next album Renaissance Act II will be dropping on 29 March 2024, during the Super Bowl on 11 February. As part of the announcement she has also shared the names of two new singles that will feature on the album 'Texas Hold Em'' and '16 Carriages'. And 'Texas Hold Em'' is already available to stream on Spotify now.\n\nIf the names of these two songs are anything to go by, it's likely her next album is going to have a country feel to it.\n\nRight now we don't know what other tracks are on the album but we'll be sure to update you on them all when we know more!\n\nYou're welcome, Bey-hive!"
