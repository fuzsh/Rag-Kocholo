        "text": "When Graham Nash passed through New Jersey on tour 40 years ago, he was a witness to history.\n\nIt was during the intermission at an Aug. 8, 1974, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young performance at the former Roosevelt Stadium in Jersey City that embattled and controversial President Richard M. Nixon took to the airwaves, announcing that he would resign the following day.\n\n“It was incredibly rainy. There was an incredible storm going on,” Nash recalled about that fateful night. “And, during our intermission, Nixon resigned. And I got to go on stage and tell everybody that he was gone.”\n\nAll these years later, Nash still has vivid memories of the crowd’s reaction to the news that the vilified Republican leader was stepping down.\n\n“In a way, it was kind of Woodstockian, if there is such a word,” Nash said. “And, the people that went to Woodstock were reliving that, and the people that didn’t go to Woodstock were trying to approximate what it must have felt like at Woodstock — that feeling that together, the public has a tremendous amount of power if we can only get our scene together.\n\n“The band was very much against the Vietnam War, and probably 99 percent of the audience was very much against the Vietnam War, and we were very happy that Richard Nixon and his administration had been found out.”\n\nRoosevelt Stadium is one of the 31 shows that Nash, David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Neil Young played that summer. And a presidential resignation wasn’t the only unprecedented happening at the time. The tour went over two months, hit 24 cities and found the band performing before a combined audience of more than a million people. This was a traveling rock ’n’ roll show the size of which the industry had never seen before.\n\n“I mean, the Beatles had done Shea Stadium, and the Stones had done a couple of big gigs in Hyde Park, but this was the first tour ever of 31 of those places,” Nash said.\n\nThat tour is now documented with “CSNY 1974,” a 40-track box set that will be released in a number of configurations on Tuesday, July 8.\n\nProduced by Nash and Joel Bernstein, the basic version of the set will include 40 tracks over three CDs, plus a DVD of eight previously unreleased, resorted archival video performances and a 188-page booklet. There also will be a high-resolution Pure Audio Blu-Ray edition, digital downloads, a single-CD set, a Starbucks-exclusive single disc with a download of the full album, and a deluxe limited-edition boxed set housed in a wood box with six vinyl LPs, a Pure Audio Blu-ray disc, a digital download, the DVD and a coffeetable book of previously unseen photos from the tour.\n\n“One of the things that I wanted to do was to let people know that Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young was a very, very good rock ’n’ roll band,” Nash said. “And when you put that together with the fact that we were all writing like crazy and that we were four strong musicians and four strong individuals, I fell back in love with who David and Stephen and Neil were as people and as writers. This was a great experience for me.”\n\nThe set features plenty of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young classics — “Teach Your Children,” “Our House” and “Almost Cut My Hair” among them — as well as a number of songs that were hits for the performers on their own, from Nash’s “Military Madness” to Young’s “Only Love Can Break Your Heart.”\n\nOver the years, Nash has assumed the role of group archivist. Along with releasing his own comprehensive box set in 2009, “Reflections,” he and Bernstein produced the 2006 Crosby set “Voyage” and Stills’ 2013 collection, “Carry On.”\n\n“I’m interested in history,” Nash said. “I’m interested in somebody 100 years from now putting on that Stephen Stills (set) or the David Crosby box set that I did or my box set and knowing who these people were. I did it for history. I mean, I obviously did it for David and Stephen and Neil, but I really did it for the history of music.”\n\nCarrying on\n\nCrosby, Stills and Nash are back on the road and will perform at the MAC at Monmouth University in West Long Branch on Sunday, July 6. They will then play New York City’s Beacon Theatre on July 8, 9 and 11 before hitting the Borgata Events Center in Atlantic City on Saturday, July 12.\n\n“These last couple of years have been quite amazing, frankly,” Nash said. “We’ve been, on purpose, playing beautiful theaters and really intimate places. We’ve done audiences of every single size, but there’s something about being able to look in people’s eyes and knowing that you’ve connected with them emotionally. You can see the response to it when you sing a line particularly well, and you see them smiling, closing their eyes. That’s great for us.”\n\nLast October, the trio reunited with Young for a performance at Young’s annual Bridge School Benefit Concert at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California.\n\n“When Neil asked us to do it, I knew that he wanted to sell as many tickets as possible. I know that,” Nash said. “I know that Neil knows that occasionally, it’s better for four voices to say something than one voice.\n\n“But, I also know that Neil was checking us out, to see if we could still perform, to see if CSN could still sing harmony, are still vital, still want to be there, still are passionate.\n\nSo, my dream, and it’s only my dream, is I want CSNY to go out in 2015 on a world tour.”\n\nIn the meantime, Crosby, Stills and Nash have a covers album in the works, and Nash said he’s interested in revisiting the quartet’s iconic 1970 debut album, “Déjà Vu.”\n\n“What happened is after the lyrics of the song finished, we just kept playing,” Nash said of the original “Déjà Vu” sessions. “Sometimes, we played for another five or six minutes, and there was some incredible playing going on. But, because of the limitations of how many minutes you can put on a side of a vinyl, which is, if you want really good quality, roughly 19 minutes, we had to fade about seven of those songs.\n\n“But, we always loved what happened after it faded.\n\n“And, I thought, ‘Well, with the technology now, those kinds of limitations don’t exist.’\n\nSo, I would like to re-do the ‘Déjà Vu’ album start to finish, meaning from the count-off to when the drummer puts his sticks on the snare, when the music’s over. I think that would be quite interesting for our fans to hear.”\n\nCSNY 1974\n\nWHAT:\n\nA new box set chronicling the 1974 tour\n\nof Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nINFO:\n\nAvailable July 8.
