        "text": "It would be tough to get them down to 35 minutes (or less) without keeping some of the songs but making them shorter.\n\n5150-Obviously lose \"Inside\", it's an utter waste of space. Get Up isn't much of a song but the band is already accused of going soft, hate to lose a rocker.\n\nOU812-Lose When It's Love. Ballads don't bother me, I like Feels So Good, but When It's Love stinks. Source Of Infection and Sucker in a 3 Piece are both possible drops, neither is necessary.\n\nFor Unlawful Carnal Knowledge-Pleasure Dome, In n' Out and Man On A Mission could all be excised. They don't bother me but I won't say they're essential.\n\nBalance. Lose Can't Stop Loving You. Then run it over with your car. It's both terrible and badly placed on the album, dragging a strong start to an immediate halt. Whoever thought this song should have been second on the album should be shot. Also, Not Enough is 10,000 times better so they had the ballad already. Lose Doin' Time and Strung Out; doesn't save much time but they're garbage. Not sure if that Wikipedia time includes Crossing Over, but it could be removed. First time I heard it I was excited because it was a tune I hadn't heard before from an album I'd had for years. Now I realize it isn't that good.\n\nVan Halen 3. Get rid of Neworld and How Many Say I Cannot Listen To This Garbage Song. Get Eddie sober enough to hear how badly Gary is straining to hit ANY note on the album. I swear I'd love this album if Gary was pushing his range so badly. I don't know, drop Josephina too, though I don't mind it. Year To The Day is great, I'm surprised to read that it's 8.34 long.\n\nA Different Kind Of Truth. Get rid of Tattoo (who thought this should be the lead single and first song???), Beats Workin' and The Trouble With Never.\n\nTo me they are not. I do like the Hagar era, but it's just \"different\". Nothing VH did with Hagar could compare with I or 1984 in my book. I believe each Ã¡lbum they did with Hagar was weaker tan the one before, though all of them have great songs.\n\nHey, someone on my page!\n\nThough I suspect the biggest challenge in reducing the Hagar albums to DLR length comes from the length of the songs themselves, as I think they tended toward longer songs with Sammy. The Hagar albums had about the same # of songs as the DLRs, so the tracks must've been longer...\n\nDLR albums were super short. But I think 40-45 minutes is a good length.\n\nI've always maintained the idea of Sammy was going to happen regardless: Eddie wanted to head in a more melodic direction, and he wasn't going to do that with Dave. The best Van Hagar songs (\"Dreams,\" \"Right Now,\" \"Don't Tell Me What Love Can Do,\" \"Humans Being\", etc) are longer than any Dave-era tunes, but I never feel like they're overlong, just more developed and complex, in a good way. The last two Sammy albums just suffered from being weighed down with some filler, but I think half of F.U.C.K. and Balance are really, really great.\n\n\"Without You\" is a cool track, and I really dig \"Once,\" even though it sounds nothing like Van Halen. Eddie's guitar solo in it is one of his best. \"A Year To The Day\" isn't much of a song, but has some of his best guitar work, and I think \"Josephina\" is an interesting direction for the band, with a very Queen-like vibe that is a bit unlike any other VH song.\n\nI don't think VH3 is a washout if you're a fan of Eddie's guitar playing, it just doesn't have many songs that really stick with you, but it's not the embarrassment many think it is. I think if it had come out as a side project or new band instead of \"OMG NEW VAN HALEN\" it would've been received better.\n\nThat's pretty much it. \"Pleasure Dome\" is an interesting guitar track but it goes on for seven minutes. The longest song in Van Halen's DLR catalog (\"Fools\" on Women And Children First) is a minute shorter. You look at the times on the tracks, and you can see the bloat.\n\nI like Van Hagar, but in addition to losing a more dynamic frontman, the band also suffered from guitar-itis and power chords in search of a basic melody. Cutting tracks would only expose the fat on what's left.\n\nThanks for the review. I tuned out (pardon the pun) that record when it came out in 1998. I thought having the guy from Extreme was a little extreme. I think the album is out of print. I'm sure there are some decent tunes to be found on that album. If I ever come across it in a \"previously enjoyed\" bin at a charity shop, I'll pick it up."
