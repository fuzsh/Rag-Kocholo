        "text": "Remember The Legion of Doom?\n\nIn 2006 a mysterious electronic duo released a mashup album of classic emo tracks called Incorporated. If you knew about it back in the day, it'll probably give you flashbacks of Runescape play-through videos on YouTube. If you didn't, now is your chance to live one of the most classic forgotten stories of the scene.\n\nThis week on the podcast, Tyler tells the story of The Legion of Doom, Incorporated and how the ultimate emo mashup album came to be. Additionally, Escape the Fate and Mod Sun have new music to talk about. A radio rundown is included as well.\n\nListen and subscribe on iTunes, Spotify and Stitcher. And check out the show's Spotify playlist here."
