IQPV MUSICUNLIMITED This one 6X28-YF8-CZ5Q QPIMION EDITORIALS I COMMENTARY I LETTERS Blfco«d ANTONY BRUNO Contributor Billboard THE WISDOM OFSKI BUMS I spent the first few years after college as a ski instructor in Colorado. During this time, I learned several lessons about ski- ing and teaching that I believe also apply to the fledgling mobile music market. It's not as big a stretch as one might think. Like skiing, music is meant to be fun. But even the most enjoyable activi- ties can be rendered frustrating if the ini- tial run is too complicated. One of the first things you learn as a ski instructor is the concept of \"new technique, old terrain; old terrain, new technique.\" In other words, don't teach students a new skiing technique on an unfamiliar trail. It overwhelms them, and in many cases can be frightening- I nstead. teach students a new technique on a trail they've skied many times over. Once they've mastered the new technique, introduce a new run. The same rule applies to the mobile en- tertainment industry today. Unfortunately, it's not being applied. According to a re- cent Entertainment Media Research poll, only 11% of consumers find the idea of downloading full songs to a mobile device appealing, while 32% find it unappealing. Another 44% say they're simply not inter- ested in il. This data points to more than just a lack of consumer awareness about mo- bile downloading. It points to a total lack of interest. However, the idea ofa combination mo- bile phone/MP3 player is incredibly popular. The same survey stales that re- spondents favor a mobile phone with an incorporated MPi player over a standalone M P3 player 2 to 1 . or 46% to 21%. Among teens, the preference shoots to 52%. Why the discrepancy? Because con- sumers like the idea of playing their dig- ital files on a mobile phone, but not the idea of buying their digital files on their phone. Give them some time to get com- fortable with the phone as a music player first before asking them to pay twice the online per-track fee to down- load it as well. Additionally, the best online services, like Pandora and Rhapsody, allow users to discover the music they like on their own. Mobile, conversely, has become a channel for major labels to market and promote their priorities. Which brings up the concept of com- mitment. Wireless operators need to truly commit to serving the needs of their sub- scribers rather than just the wishes of their industry content partners (read: record labels). Much has been written about labels' frustrations at Apple's refusal to negotiate on price or packaging. And several artists remain iTunes holdouts because Apple won't relax its stance on selling individual promotion shouldn't come at the expense of the user experience. Otherwise, you kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. I give credit to Sprint for adding a \"rec- ommendations\" tab to its music service, which will suggest new music based on users' purchase history. I only hope it re- mains a pure recommendation engine un- influenced by outside marketing. If operators want to get serious about selling more mobile content, they'd listen to their customers more and to their con- tent partners less. Apple has proved that a commitment to the user experience pays dividends and, by all accounts, we are expecting to see a combo mobile phone/iPod (dubbed the Skiing, like music, is fun. But it's frustrating if the initial run is too complicated. tracks rather than requiring the purchase of a full album. Apple does this because, for better or worse, it has a strong belief in what a good user experience should look and feel like. So far, it has been proved right. Wireless operators, meanwhile, are con- tent to pimp out their subscribers to the highest bidder at the expense of the expe- rience. Select \"Buy Ringtones' on your mobile phone, and you are given a list of stores, not ringtones. So now the customer has to figure out which store to use. an added clement of frustration. We're 10 years into the mobile content business and u.sers still can't customize their screens so they see only the content that actually interests them. Don't get me wrong. I don't blame la- bels for wanting to use mobile music serv- ices as a way to promote new artists and new releases. There's a tremendous amount of opportunity there. It's just that i Phone) as early as next year. Analysts say it could sell 10 million phones, or 1% of the global mobile handset market. In the process, Apple may end up showing oth- ers how mobile music should be delivered and consumed. Many in the mobile industry still adhere to a \"mobile is different\" philosophy, but that's the wrong approach to take. Mobile is just one more trail on the slopes of dig- ital content. Never forget: Consumers are not stu- pid. They will go with the \"trail\" that offers the most entertaining ride — that is, once they have the technique down.

FEEDBACK APOLOGIES ALL AROUND In an article in the Aug. 20, 2006, issue of Billboard (\"Canada Sets Key Hearings on Online Sales\"), I was quoted making certain remarks respecting the trustwor- thiness of record labels with respect to mechanical licensing. Through many years of negotiations with representatives of record companies. I have found them to be strong advocates of their interests and positions in what has often been a contentious process. My remarks in the above-noted article were ill-considered and intemperate. They did not reflect the views of the Canadian Musical Reproduction Rights Agency or the Canadian Music Publishers Assn. 1 regret having made those remarks and wish to express my sincere apologies to those who were offended by them. David A. Basskin President, Canadian Musical Reproduction Rigjhts Agency Toronto FOR THE RECORD Crosstown Songs (Billboard. Aug. 12) did not acquire the Rive Droite Music catalog, tt acquired 119 songs from the catalog, which Rive Droite reports includes more than 5,000 titles. Greg Linn (Billboard.

Istey, 65, was also ordered to pay about $3.1 million to the Internal Revenue Service, having engaged in \"pervasive, long-term, pathological\" evasion of federal taxes, according to U.S. District Court Judge Dean Pregerson. The sentence was handed down after Isley was convicted last October of five counts of tax evasion and one count of willful failure to file a tax return. >> HANDLEMAN POSTS Ql LOSS Plummeting music sales were cited as the key reason Handleman Co. posted a deeper loss In the first quarter of this year compared to last. Overall, the wholesaler posted a S5.9 million loss, versus the $3.6 million In the corresponding period last year. Revenue held steady during the two time frames at $240.4 million. But music sales suffered a deep drop, down $34.5 million or 15.7%, which was mostly offset by $30.8 million in video- game revenue. > FORUM OPERATORS SUE Forum Enterprises, the operator of the Forum in Inglewood, Calif., filed a federal lawsuit Sept. 6 claiming that L.A. Arena Co., a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group, violated an exclusive booking contract between the two companies. The suit alleges that AEG, which owns and operates Los Angeles' Staples Center and other venues in Southern California, diverted potential Forum shows to other AEG-operated venues. Michael Roth, VP of communications at AEG, says the lawsuit is nothing more than an effort to circumvent the exclusive rights that were granted to AEG. continued on »p12 UpFi'ont BgTrffrnn?T?w by susan butler i Shifting The Balance UMG's Acquisition Of BMG Music Publishing Could Change The Biz's Entire Playing Field NICHOLAS FIRTH, left, will stay onboard as BMG Music Publishing CEO through the transition. If the deal is approved, BMG will be absortied into Universal Music Publishing Group, headed by DAVID RENZER, right. Bertelsmann AG's announce- ment that Vivendi's Universal Music Group was the success- ful bidder for BMG Music Pub- lishing is triggering a seismic ripple effect in the major pub- lishing and recorded music in- dustries. Not only is more money passing hands for a publisher than ever before, but the deal will test competition laws, affect business decisions and perhaps have an impaa on legislation in the industry's digital and mobile future. UMC, which owns the world's largest recorded-music division, agreed to acquire BMG Music Publishing for €1.63 billion (S2.09 billion). If approved by European, U.S. and other competition regula- tors, BMG will be absorbed into Universal Music Publish- ing Group, currently headed by David Renzer. Until ap- proval. Bertelsmann claims the two publishers, which both tout themselves as the third- largest publisher, will operate separately as competitors. Some reports indicate com- bined publishing assets will make UMPC the largest pub- lisher, surpassing EMI Music Publishing, which most ex- perts agree sits at the lop. Yet no one has precise financial in- formation on all five major publishers to definitively de- termine their value. UMG may overcome any antitrust objec- tions by shaking off certain short-term administration con- tracts or selling certain assets while holding onto the most lucrative copyrights and co- publishing deals. While the companies are awaiting regulatory approval, BMG Music Publishing chair- man/CEO Nicholas Firth says he will stay onboard during the transition period. \"It will be business as usual,' he says. But publishing experts know thai, at BMG. that won't be the case. Undoubtedly BMG will not be acquiring any more catalogs while UMG awaits regulatory approval. And since songwrit- ers' managers and lawyers typ- ically point to a particular publishing executive with whom they want to work, it is unlikely many songwriters will sign with BMG when they ex- pect a personnel shift in the next several months. On Capitol Hill, sources say that the world's largest label and publisher under one cor- porate umbrella could soften industry infighting that often holds up technological oppor- tunities. One source draws an analogy to Warner Music Group chairman/CEO Edgar Bronfman |r.. credited with in- sisting a couple of years ago that the WMG recorded-music and publishing divisions begin making fair deals rather than slowing down progress over rights and rate disputes. The source explains that UMG's labels are sometimes viewed as publishers' mighti- est enemy, while its publish- ing unit is perceived as lacking clout to balance interests. With both divisions of equal stature, the source suggests that the parent corporation could insist that each division work toward a lucrative future for the music industry as a whole and find a middle ground on such disputes. If approved, the acquisition is also expected to affect the National Music Publishers' Assn. board of directors, the most powerful publishers' group on Capitol Hill. BMG's Firth and UMPG's Renzer serve on the 18-person board. Firth's departure will leave an open seat. With four instead of five major publishers, that seat would go to an independ- ent publisher. Although every board mem- ber has an equal vote and the votes lean toward consensus, the replacement could shift agendas depending on person- alities involved. Meanwhile, several publish- ing experts are still scratching their heads at the purchase price. They say BMG is sim- ply not worth that much money. But value is in the eye of the beholder. from »p9 co-founder of RZO. a company formed in large part to oversee the international touring finances for acts like the Rolling Stones. U2, Sting and David Bowie. \"These things come and go in waves, where rock'n'roll becomes the focus of the IRS and then it doesn't . . . Once ticket prices began to break the $200 barrier, all of a sudden the IRS got inter- ested again.\" Robert Murray. GM for the James L. Knight Center in Miami, a Global Spectrum- managed facility that works with many Latin and Spanish acts, says his business is taking the CWA \"very seriously . . . there is no messing around.\" Murray says he was prompted to learn more about the CWA once he read the April 24 notice from the IRS. Indeed, many promoters learned about the CWA when venues started calling to inquire if touring acts were U.S. resi- dents or had taxpayer ID num- bers. Having a foreign corporation set up here in the United States, which is what many artists do to pay their taxes, was no longer enough. Most agree the CWA is a good deal for the artist when weighed against 30% of gross revenue. \"If a rock'n'roll band went somewhere and earned SIOO.OOO. they were probably spending 550,000 to make that $100,000, and to have another $30,000 withheld left them with very little money,\" Zys- blat says. \"And God knows if you were a small enough band, you didn't net 30% of your gross, so the withhold- ing was absolutely crippling.\" Obviously, venues and pro- moters who work with a lot of foreign acts are the ones most affected by the IRS rules. But, as Henry Cardenas. CEO of con- cert and event promotion firm CMN, says, \"I don't think any artist who has a 20-date concert tour here will stop coming be- cause he has to pay taxes. I don't know a single country where you don't pay taxes.\" In fact, many promoters say. most countries are notoriously strict with taxes, and in places, it is common for tax officials to actually go to shows to collect • •• their dues. Now, the CWA \"puts every- body on track.\" one promoter says. \"Before, we would pay Ithe artistsj. they would take their money and it would take the IRS years to catch up.\" While some see the I RS ef- fort as a crackdown, Glunt calls it a benefit that helps the entertainers. The I RS expects to process nearly 250 CWAs by Sept. 30, up from 1 55 all of last year, indicating the need for the program. \" I think it's a way of abiding by the law and it's fine with me,\" says one promoter who is in the process of explaining the CWA to a major Latin touring act. \"We've left venues where we've had 30% taken away, and then it's a disaster accounting- wise, and we had to deduct from what we pay the artist.\" Glunt says it is in everyone's interest to be informed rather than have the IRS come look- ing after the fact. \"The last place that we want to go to is the ven- ues, because when we go to the venues and ask them to with- hold, we' re putting the onus on the promoter, the business manager and everybody down the line.\" she says. \"It's been a challenge be- cause everyone hates to pay any kind of revenue service.\" Cardenas says. \"It's an edu- cational process.\" And a welcome one for Cir- denas, who says the CWA lib- erates both his company and the artists it works with from IRS headaches at the end of the year. \"The artist sleeps better at night.\" C<irdenas says. \"And so do 1.\" •••• An agreement that lets foreign acts playing the United States pay 30% of their net, not their gross. 10 I SEPTEMBER 16, 2006 • RAim' NIGHT L\\ GEORGIA • .VINT NO SUNSHINE • (Sl ITIN' ON) THE DOCK OF THE BAY • S l AND BY ME • YOU SEND ME • RESPECT YOURSELF • Z Z < < X f- z < < ■■fi < in > o -i z < z AARON NEVILLE bring it on home... the soul classics IN STORES SEPTEMBER 19, 2006 I 13 SOUL CLASSICS reinterjDreted by the most remarkable voice in music today Features collaborations with CHRIS BOITI, CHAKA KHAN, ART NEVILLE, DAVID SANBORN and MAVIS STAPLES -0 rr I^)()k. for \" I HE SOI L CLASSICS\" lour with the Aaron Neville Quintet Fall 2()()() fA> ij^ www.burgundyrecords.com www.aaronneville.coin Z \"0 ( jiniiii'^ soon from BurgutuJy Records in 2007: rh I • Cliak:i Kliiiii • Diiiiiia Siimiiici • (iliiiia Eslelan z Ci o z z > o • RAINY NIGHT IN GEORGIA • .\\1NT NO SUNSHINE • (SITI IN' ON) I HE IXK'K OF THE lUY • .STAND BY ME • YOU SEND ME • RESI'ECT\" YOURSELF • THE LATEST NEWS FROM biz UpFront www.billboard.biz »>FRESTON EXITS VIACOM Tom Freston, presldent/CEO of MTV parent Viacom, has resigned after 26 years of service, ttie company's board of directors said Sept. 4. in ills piace tile board iias appointed Piiiiippe Dauman as president/ CEO. in addition, the board named Thomas E.

BY BRIAN GARRITY THE MP3 QUESTION 3 In? n MySpace Turns Up The Format's Volume, But Are Majors Tuning In? The MP3 format received a big endorsement from MySpace this month, when the social net- working giant announced plans to sell music tracks in the open source standard. Now. as the number of serv- ices selling MP3s grows, fresh questions swirl in a long-raging debate over the need for labels to continue to sell tracks en- coded with digital rights man- agement (DRM) technology. MySpace becomes the sec- ond major retailer of MP3 music, joining Dimensional As- 9 sociates' eMusic, the current No. 2 to Apple Computer's iTunes Music Store in terms of market share, according to research firmNPD. MySpace CEO Chris De- Wolfe says the company is by- passing DRM to ensure compatibility with the iPod. which claims roughly 70% of the digital music player market. \"We wanted our users to be able to play the music on an iPod and virtually any device,\" De- Wolfe says. \"The MP3 format affords that.\" But backing MP3 comes at a price. No DRM means the ma- jority of major label acts using the site likely will forgo making use of the MySpace commerce solution when it debuts later this year. Artists will be able to sell albums and individual tracks directly from their My- Space profile pages. MySpace hopes that the major labels will use the service to tinker with the MP3 format. \" Maybe the major labels will put their foot in the water with some of their emerging artists or even some of their larger bands,\" DeWolfesays. Major label sources say they remain in talks with MySpace over opportunities for selling music through the site. But one executive calls the MP3-only issue \"a major stumbling block.\" A source at a rival major adds: \"We're just not ready to give up on DRM.\" Labels already regularly feed MP3s to tastemaker blogs for promotional purposes. But get- ting them to view unprotected files as a commercial product is proving a tougher task. Some label sources suggest that regardless of the renewed hype around MP3s, the indus- try is too far down the road on DRM to turn back now. Ted Cohen, managing direc- tor at Los Angeles-based advi- sory firm Tag Strategic, says a rising tide of MP3-based retail- ers actually could prompt greater experimentation with the for- mat by the major labels. But he cautions that there's no reason to believe significant rethink- ing on the topic is imminent. \" For the vast majority of the hit catalog you are not going to see some massive move over to MP3s,' he says. \"It's a huge leap of faith. The majors have a bigger investment to worry about damaging than what an independent label or an un- signed artist might have in- vested in a career.\" The good news for MySpace is that it doesn't need the ma- jors to make an MP3 service work. With more than 3 mil- lion artists using MySpace, most of them independent acts, major label material rep- resents a small fraction of the music ofTered on the site. And DeWolfe says the majority of MySpace acts, as well as their fans, want MP3s. For independent artists and labels, the ability to sell music in an iPod-friendly format rep- resents an oppwrtunity to finally participate in commercial digi- tal distribution in a meaningful way. Many MySpace acts are un- signed or record for small labels that are not represented in lead- ing music services like iTunes. \"We built this for that tier of artist that is underserved and has no distribution, but has a place to connect with their fans,\" says Rusty Rueff. CEO of Sno- cap. MyS pace's technology part- ner in the venture. San Francisco-based Snocap, the digital distribution services company from Napster creator Shawn Fanning, is powering the back end of the MySpace serv- ice. Bands selling through My- Space must first register their content with Snocap, so the company can fingerprint songs for tracking purposes and block unauthorized content sales. Even if the major labels don't participate in .selling MP3s. De- Wolfe acknowledges that the store is likely to spur debate over the need for DRM at all levels of the music business. \"To the de- gree we can shape the attitudes of younger consumers and con- dition them to pay for their music, we can help move the de- bate toward M P3,\"\" he says. But DeWolfe says the com- pany isn't necessarily opposed to DRM either. \"This is just the first iteration of the service,\" he cautions. \"I don't think you'll ever see a consensus out there where all the major labels will be comfortable with the MP3 format ... We will be definitely exploring different DRM solu- tions with Snocap.\" Still, even rival services that already use DRM are holding out hope that they might yet get in on the MP3 business, too. Yahoo Music — a vocal propo- nent of selling MP3s — in july teamed with Epic Records to offer personalized versions of (essica Simpson's song \"A Pub- lic Affair\" for $1.99 without any DRM protection. And Yahoo has been surveying its music sub- scribers on whether they would pay more for tracks without DRM limitations, listing the proposed price as $1.09. up from the standard 99 cents. Likewise, new ad-supported peer-to-peer services also hope to offer tracks as M P3s. even as they prepare for launch with DRM-protected files. David Pakman, president/ CEO of New York-based eMu- sic, says the issue is not whether DRM is good or bad. but rather interoperability with digital de- vices, namely the iPod. \"There are only two online stores that can sell to the iPod user, us and Apple, and that con- tributes to our success,\" Pak- man says. Additional reporting by Susan Butler and Ed Christman in New York. eMusic: Already An MP3 Player When MySpace launcties its music commerce so- lution later this year, it won't be the only one selling MP3s. The social networking site will find Itself play- ing catch-up witti the current leading retailer of MP3 music from indie artists and labels— eMusic. Among Apple's rivals. eMusic leads the pack with 13% market share according to NPD; Apple's iTunes claims 60%. But with no major label content. eMu- sic is chasing a different consumer And, with a tar- get demographic aged 25-54, eMusic executives are betting the youth-centric MySpace will also be after different music fans. eMusic president/CEO David Pakman isn't ex- pecting any quick shifts in the major labels' MP3 policy now that MySpace is entering the market. But he says that if experimentation with MP3 sales through MySpace docs happen, ■'there is going tot>e a tot of pressure from everyone else who wants to do MP3s. us included.\" Credit a big part of eMusic's position among the non-Apple digital music retailers to its ability to sidestep the DRM problems that plague other iTunes competitors. The company aggressively mar kets itself via the iPod accessory market, and eMusic executives say selling in an iPod-compatible format is a key factor in driving consumers to subscribe. The strategy is helping fuel sales and subscriber growth. Privately-held eMu- sic's annual revenue totaled $15 million m 2005— a 63% increase from when Dimen- sional Associates bought the company in 2003, ac- cording to a confidential report obtained by Bill- board. The document, on investment bank letterhead and dated during the second quarter of 2006, states eMusic claimed 129,000 subscribers at the end of 2005, an increase of 77% from 2004. The company shifted to its existing subscription model in October 2003. Current-year subscriber figures were not in- cluded, but eMusic now claims around 200,000 sub- scribers. The report also says the company posted an annual loss tn earnings before interest, taxes, depre- ciation and amortization (EBITDA) of slightly less than $6 million in 2005. Executives at eMusic declined to com- ment on company finances, but the loss could be due to reinvestment. The com- pany in recent years has pumped money into everything from marketing to design and editorial content. Pakman says the more MP3-based mod- els work the more likely the major labels may be open to working with MP3s over the long term, \"If MySpace is very successful and you add its numbers onto eMusic's numbers and it starts look- ing really meaningful, does thai help them say, 'Maybe we need to look at this and make a change?' \" he asks. \"I would hope so.\" —Brian Garrity.

The \"sweetly sexy line takes our girls from dorm room to classroom to coffee shop,\" AE chief marketing officer Kathy Saviti says. To help introduce the just- launching aerie line (the first sub-brand from the popular re- tailer), AE created a new-music program: the aerie Artists Music Se- ries. In-store and online, this initia- tive spotlights emerging, inde- pendent artists, offering aerie cus- tomers exclusive content (including special -edition CDs and free music and video downloads). \"This program helps our cus- tomers discover new. emerging art- ists — artists that are reflective of our customers' pas- sions,\" Savitt says. \"Similarly, the series helps the artists dis- cover a new audience.\" Say hello to New West Rec- ords' Ben Lee and Emd/Astral- werks' Sia, the initial artists featured in the aerie program. 1\\vo exclusive tracks (and their accompanying videos, paid for by AE) — Lee's \"Since I Met You\" and Sia's \"Pictures\" — are available as free downloads at aerie.com. Online content also includes artist interviews and live concert footage. The artists' music and videos will be heavily featured in the nearly 900 AE stores in North America. Additionally, the stores will sell special-edition CDs from each artist. Tina Wells. CEO of New York-based youth-geared mar- keting agency Buzz Marketing Group, is intrigued by what AE is doing with its aerie line. \"They're using music as a con- duit between their customers and the new loungewear line,\" she says. \"By using cool sounds from emerging artists, the aerie and AE brands speak volumes — and stay in the spotlight.\" Lee views this partnership as a great opportunity. When AE executives first approached him. he recalls them saying. \" 'We want to help ing for us,\" he notes. \"With all the back-to-school activity in the malls and online, a new audience will learn about Ben.\" With Lee. though, the label has scored a double whammy. In addition to his AE partner- ship. Lee's music is heard in a new Dell TV spot. The 1 5-, 30- and 60-second ads feature the sounds of 'Catch My Disease,\" you and align ourself with you. You represent what our brand is about.' 1 liked their honesty and where they were coming from.\" Lee also liked the potential to reach an additional, new au- dience. The icing on the cake, for him. was the exclusive con- tent. \"It's one more creative way to share my music.\" On Sept. 6, Lee was sched- uled to perform at the AE Union Square store in New York. Sia is scheduled to make a similar appearance at an AE store later this year. Steve Rosenblatt, head of marketing at New West, says there will be much activity on the Internet connecting the dots between Lee and his music and what he's doing on the branding side. \"It's excit- the lead single from Lee's nearly 2-year-old disc, \"Awake Is the New Sleep.\" Since the Dell campaign launched Aug. 1, New West has watched digital sales of \"Catch My Disease\" rise sharply. For the week ending )uly 16, the track amassed digital sales ap- proaching 1,000, according to Nielsen SoundScan. For the week ending Aug. 27. the track sold 3,000 downloads. In total, the track has sold 62,000 downloads, while \"Awake Is the New Sleep\" has sold 55,000 units, making it Lee's biggest-selling album. \"Thanks to the ad, the song exploded online,\" Rosenblatt says. \"Now, with both cam- paigns happening at the same time, we have lots to leverage.\" So it's not surprising to learn that New West is reser- vicing \"Catch My Disease\" to radio. learn music online www.berkleemusic.com 1.866.

The event's central com- plex al Sam Boyd Stadium — which includes the iO-acre Star Nursery Field with its mountainous backdrop — pro- vides a festival setting that could hardly be compared to the rural Tennessee camp-out of Bonnaroo. But like Bonna- roo. Vegoose offers a combi- nation of wcirdness and whimsy that takes the event to another level. Building on the debut event's extracurric- ular activities, like the Imper- sonators Cafe, the Wedding Chapel and the Great Evil Pumpkin, producers have a few more tricks up their sleeves this year. Capps says. \"As with Bonnaroo we've always got these special, some of them non-musical, side amusement areas that feature different things.\" he says. 'We're really excited a bout some of the new visual elements and special attractions we'll have. Veg- oose was such an exciting event last year we can't wait to get this one up and run- ning.\" Capps says a few more an- nouncements will 1h' corning in terms of the night show lineup, and several other acts arc being added to the main bill. \"All of the information isn't quite out tliere yet. but it's going to be a great event.\" he says. \"There's nothing quite like the combination of i.as Vegas, Hal- loween and this music festival. It's going lo be fun.\" When On The Road spoke with Capps he had jusl re- turned from vacation in Ice- land. \"Iceland was amazing,\" he says. \"It was really nice to be off the grid for a little more than a week.

While executives at the new initiative and UMG may refer to SpiralFrog as an ad-supported or no-cost digital music service that will compensate artists and labels for music from revenue derived from selling advertis- ing, the message that came through loud and clear in the mainstream media is that con- sumers will be able to get music for FREE, and legally too. That indeed is big news. It remains to be s€ren if Spi- ralFrog will work, and what im- pact a successful launch will have on the other various tradi- tional, digital and envisioned fu- mre revenue streams of record labels, but music merchants who sell music for a living won- der if SpiralFrog has already opened up a Pandora's box. Traditional merchants al- ready know how hard it is to compete against the online stores' $9.99 digital album, the $5.99 per CD price offered by the YourMusic.com record club and the loss-leader tactics em- ployed by big boxes. But Retail Track wonders how much those big-box and nontraditional mer- chandisers will like competing against FREE. A traditional music merchan- diser is too busy worrying about the implications for his own business to consider the impact that FREE will have on other merchants. He writes Retail Track that \"with our industry in a distressed condition and spi- raling downward,\" merchants who've invested a considerable amount of funds and carry deeper catalog or specialize in certain genres are the ones showing success nowadays. But he asks, \"With UMG's new business venture offering their entire catalog available for free, do you think it will help\" the catalog and/or genre- based merchants? While that merchant didn't answer his own question, the implication is clear: FREE will undermine the business mod- els that make customers pay for music. For his part, Universal Music Group Distribution president |im Urie gave a statement on the SpiralFrog deal. \"We are being compensated for these downloads and in all cases we expect to be compensated for downloads of our content.\" But that statement doesn't address retail worries. On the other hand, the SpiralFrog deal su^ests UMG is worried about monetizing the potential rev- enue it is losing to unautho- rized file-sharing, but less concerned that FREE will fur- ther truncate the revenue that the labels get from traditional sellers of CDs. Besides, retailers should be ready for the ad-supported dig- ital model because the majors have been talking about that possibility for almost five years now, label executives say. Moreover, they say retailers* worries are misplaced because it's unclear if the service will be successful or if it will sign up the other major labels. At press time, EMI Music Publishing signed on to make its catalog available to SpiralFrog. But in a FREE environment, do you re- ally need all the majors to launch and keep the consumer coming back for more? I think not. Still, the success or failure of SpiralFrog may hinge on how willing consumers are to deal with the inconvenience of viewing 90 seconds of com- mercials to get a download. \"I question whether the ad- vertising will be effective with multitask computers,' Newbury Comics CEO Mike Dreesesays. That means if the advertisers don't feel they are getting their money's worth, they will stop supporting SpiralFrog. Drcese says an even bigger question needs to be answered, in order for ad-supported mod- els like SpiralFrog to be consid- ered a success. \"Is the artist well-served by vehicles like Spi- ralFrog?\" he asks. In other words, the revenue streams and profitability from ad-supported business mod- els will have to be compared with the profitability of other models. And if found lacking they'll lose the industry's li- censing of music. But don't forget that the SpiralFrog announced today can look very different tomor- row. For example. SpiralFrog can always convert its model to a hybrid service by mone- tizing advanced features. For example, the model currently planned only allows users to download tracks to a com- puter, then transfer them only once to a Windows Media- compatible portable device. However, SpiralFrog. with the labels' blessing, can always offer the capabihty of burning CDs and charging for it. Or it might consider converting to a sub- scription-based service one day offering advanced pay services beyond the free dovmload. But ultimately, whether or not consumers embrace the planned offering or whatever it becomes, SpiralFrog still leaves the FREE word closely associated with music. Even if it fails, consumers will re- member when they got music for FREE, further undermin- ing the perceived value of paid models. 20 I SEPTEMBER 16, 2006 O^ncf U£e Seyacy Gonh'nues.

But hand in hand with tech- nological evolution is a grow- ing perception that the industry must develop a better way of selling all this product. Despite all the dramatic ad- vancements that the mobile en- lertainment industry has made, there is a still one im- portant ingredient it has not obtained: customers. There has been a flurry of content-related dealmaking and partnership activity in the last year between those who create content and those who distribute it. Granted, this was a necessary step in the devel- opment of the mobile enter- tainment industry, but the focus now is moving to sell- ing this newly acquired con- tent properly. \"The content is there, and there's plenty to choose from,\" says Richard SIber, an industry consultant who for- merly led Accenture's mobile media division. \"It's just not intuitive to discover or actu- ally purchase [the content). It's about making the discov- ery easier and making the transaction seamless.\" Mobile tracking firm M:Metrics has determined from data collected in the three-month period ending this July that ringtones — by far the most popular form of mo- bile content — are bought by only about 10% of the total user base. In addition. 2% have bought games. 3.5% sub- scribed to a ringtone service or downloaded a wallpaper image. 0.4% watched paid video and 0.2% downloaded a full song. Overall, about 28 million, or 15%. of the 190 mil- lion U.S. wireless subscribers, have downloaded some type of multimedia content. By any defmition, that is a niche market. Granted, it is still early in the evolution of the industry. M:Metrics is quick to point out that these figures triple when narrowed I SPEAKERS INCLUDED Samsung Electronics has managed to add something new to the crowded iPod also- ran market with its new K5 MP3 player. The flash-memory-based device is much like its brethren PlaysForSure portable subscription devices, with an FM radio tuner, color display screen and simple navigation controls. But the K5 makes a departure with a set of slide-out speakers ■ built into the body. No add-on speakers or wires • are needed. Earbuds are included, of course. The # product is available for $210 for the 2G8 and $260 A for the 4GB mode!. —Antony Bruno video is available for download. Record labels, for instance, are keen to offer what E M I sen- ior VP of digital and mobile strategy Tom Ryan calls \"mo- bile albums,\" a variety of artist- related applications combined into a single package. \"Fans want to buy content Tans want to buy content based on the artist, not based on a specific product.' -TOM RYAN, EMI ■people are throwing a lot of things at the wall to see what will stick as opposed to taking a step back and ask- ing themselves what's the best way to consume content from an end-user perspec- tive.\" says DP Venkatesh. CEO of mPortal, a mobile services application provider. \"There seems to be an over- emphasis on making more content available rather than relevant content.\" The biggest concern is that each type of mobile service — ringtones, games, video — is sold separately. Consumers who buy a ringtone of a given artist, for example, may have no idea that the same artist may have a mobile game for sale or that the artist's music based on the artist, not based on a specific product,\" he says, \"lust like a CD is a bundle of tracks, a mobile album could be a bundle of mobile products around one artist.\" There are several technical and business-related chal- lenges that must be resolved before this can become a real- ity. First, carriers must develop a service delivery platform that allows users to buy multiple application types in a single download. Second, labels and carriers must determine ex- actly how much content should be bundled together and at what price. One stopgap solution is con- tent-related mobile searches. Companies like jumpTap and Medio offer carriers technology that lets users search for any content available for their phone based on a specific term. So a search on \"Lil Jon.\" for example, would list any ringtone. wall- paper, game or video featuring the artist accessible via the carrier's system, number of third- party providers are rushing into the gap as well with their own direct-to-consumer strategies. With a strong enough brand, these pro- viders can launch a Web site that aggregates a variety of mobile content around cer- tain niche audiences. News Corp's Fox Mobile launched a direct-to-consumer play called Mobizzo this spring. It's a place where fans of \"Family Guy,\" for example, can purchase voicctones, wall- papers and other content I based on the popular adult | animated show. BITS & BRIEFS The challenge, though, is to develop a service that works just as well on all mobile de- vices. Even in Europe, where off-deck content is now con- sidered the norm, off-deck sales struggled early on be- cause people were buying content that was not properly formatted to a given phone. Another danger is that too many direct-to-consumer of- fers will result in further clut- tering of the space. Look at Japan, where carrier NTT Do- CoMo pioneered the wireless content industry by offering anybody the chance to create and sell content on its net- work. It ended up with around 65.000 off-deck sites, creating a massive amount of confusion. \"Now you have to worry about how that is organized and how people access those off-deck sites,\" Siber says. \"The risk is the consumer goes that route, has a bad experience and then never purchases anything again. Everybody loses. If the experience sucks, it's going to turn them off.\" — * This topic is expected to dominate the dixussion at CTIA—The Wireless Assn.'s Wireless !.T. df Entertainment conference, set for Sept. 12-14 in Los Angeles.

NPR PLANS DIGITAL DISCOVERY SERVICE NPR unveiled plans to create an online digital music serv- ice, exp«cted to launch in the first half of next year. The radio broadcaster says the service will focus on new- music discovery, highlighting emerging and out-of-the- mainstream artists in such gen- res as classical, Jazz, folic, elec- tronica and alternative music. Live streaming concerts, podcasts and other existing npr.com music programs will be included. There are also plans to add a community/so- cial networiclng feature for fans of like genres to discuss their recent discoveries.

ALSTON C^JAVIEN midemQ. rial UpFront PUBLISHING BY SUSAN BUTLER | Urban Renaissance Warner/Chappell Beefs Up In Hip-Hop And R&B Just two years ago, Warner/Chappell Music was practically out of the new urban music market. An ownership change and layoffs at one of the world's largest publishers left a skeleton staff with little direction or deal- making money. Which makes its recent suc- cess all the sweeter A couple of weeks ago, BMI named Warner/Chappell— for the first time— urt>an music publisher of the year at its sixth annual Urban Music Awards. \"When I arrived, we had very few resources in the urban division,\" says Warner/Chappell president/CEO Richard Blackstone, who came onboard last year. \"Consequently there was less focus than I would like to see.\" Blackstone formed a bond with Chris Hicks, an Atlanta-based entrepreneur who was already working for the publisher as VP of A&R, urban. \"We needed a moment to create a rhythm of working together,\" Blackstone says. \"I re- alized we came from similar backgrounds. Very quickly we got a shorthand going, built up and developed a trust with one another. It allowed us to move really quickly into a 'go' mode.\" That mode resulted in an especially strong string of hits for Warner/Chappet) urban music writers. Among the chart-toppers were Marlah Carey's \"Don't Forget About Us,\" co-written and co-produced by Bryan- Michael Cox; Nelly Furtado's \"Promiscuous\" featuring Timbaland, co-written and co- produced by Tim \"Timbaland\" Moseley and Floyd Nathaniel \"Danjahandz\" Hills; and some songs from marquee writers signed In the past couple of years: T.l.'s \"What You Know\" and \"Why You Wanna,\" co-written by Clifford \"T.I.\" Harris; and Yung Joe's \"It's Gofn' Down,\" co-written by Jasiel \"Yung Joe\" Robinson. The Warner/Chappell strategy is pretty simple: create a good atmosphere to develop talent, pitch great songs, build on strong relationships and be aggressive. \"We're a big company, but we have a very small company mentality,\" Hicks says. \"We're easily accessible, and we listen to everything. Everything doesn't always fit with what we're trying to do, but our door is always open.\" Hicks says his focus is on dedicated songwriters. \"As much as I believe in get- ting behind talented people, I really like to get into writers who have their feet firmly on the ground and they stead- fastly want to do this more than anything else on the planet.\" Today the Warner/Chappell roster of writers reads like a who's who of rap and hip-hop, including Dr. Dre, Timbaland, Cox, T.I., Lil Wayne, Yung Joe and Young Dro. \"We're establishing a boutique publishing culture, which means hands-on service,\" Blackstone says. \"For developing artists, pro- ducers and writers, we're going to track their career. We'll sit down and have a discussion on where we think it should be. It means in- volving that person going through exercises, putting them together with people who they may not think is a perfect match, trying to find out where they can grow, what their direction should be and what are their strengths and weaknesses— working to their strengths, de- veloping their weaknesses and supporting their weaknesses.\" This seems to attract young writer/produc- ers. Eric Hudson recently signed with the pub- lisher. He co-produced and co-wrote Omar- ion's \"Entourage\" and is now writing and producing with Mary J. Bilge and Mario. \"It feels like a family,\" Hudson says as the reason he chose Warner/Chappell. \"Every- one that I work with makes me feel like a little brother.\" Blackstone plans to continue this boutique approach to developing urban music talent. \"Not only does everyone make more money and become a success, it actually feels better,\" Blackstone says. \"It feels like you're really winning, and everyone is win- ning together. When magic happens, that's what keeps me going.\" TTieP^Dllshers' Place SUSAN BUTLER sbutler@billboarcl.eom Rules Of The Game The Ins And Outs Of Urban Publishing When it comes to publishing, a song is a song whether it's rock, pop or urban, right? Not necessarily. Publishers who have been able to tap into the chart-topping market of urban music — hip-hop, rap and R&B — didn't do so just by offering song- writers 3 standard publishing advance on roy- alties or working the songs like a rock or pop catalog. Urban music publishing has its own set of rules, from calculating the investment risk to attracting writer/producers who are also savvy business entrepreneurs. For those publishers who want to sink some money into a songwriting or co-publishing deal. EMI Music Publishing'sBigJon Piatt sees urban music as a better investment risk than other genres of music. \"With urban deals, you have more of a shot at winning,\" says Piatt, executive VP of urban music. \"In other genres, it's either hit big or lose big. With urban deals, some you win big, some you make out OK, but if you're signing the right things, it's rare you ever really lose. \" This is because urban music is so collabora- tive. With multiple writers, producers, artists and featured guest artists, there are many more opportunities for an urban songwriter — who is often also a producer, artist or both — to have rights in songs on several albums the same year. And publishers are stepping up to lake on a stronger role in this collaborative process. \"Up until recently, an urban publisher's role was more about putting people who were al- ready established in the urban market together,\" says Kenny Meiselas. a partner with Grubman, Indursky & Shire in New York. \"It was more about chasing the hot producer instead of de- veloping a new, unknown songwriter. Now more publishers are signing unknovm song- writer/producers.\" In the early days of hip-hop. the urban music publisher was greatly underutilized, says Meise- las. who represents Sean \"Puffy\" Combs, Mary J. Blige, Mario and others. Publishers essen- tially sat in the back seat while producers drove the music, he says. \"Today, even the great, well- known producers like the Pharrells or the Kanye Wests really need a publisher to help place them on songs.\" When calculating which songwriter/pro- ducers may be the best investment, urban music publishers don't have to rely only on their ears and gut feeling. They have plenty of indicators to figure out how well a new songwriter/producer or artist may do, says Chris Hicks, VP of urban A&R for Warner/ Chappell Music. Hicks points to companies like Sho'Nuff Records, Grand Hustle and Block Entertain- ment in Atlanta that consistently get their records a head start, giving labels and publish- ers an indication of how well the songwriter/ producers will do. Much more than radio sta- tions broadcasting other types of music, urban stations often play mix tapes and other record- ings by local producers and artists. HICK^,l<|t.iind Warnet/CMppell presidMt/ffO RICHARB BLACKSTONE \"As an effective music publisher, you kind of watch and track those movements to find out how much fire is really under those records based on radio play, media and so on,\" Hicks says. \"What makes it tougher on [rock music publishers] is that they don't have the urban in- dependent picture, i.e., radio and statistics, to back up their signings. So a lot of what they're doing is really based on sheer gut feeling.' All of this information is used to make the right deal — but not only by publishers. Song- writers, producers and artists are typically well- informed about the value and profitability. \"The interesting thing about the urban world is that it's very much about business.' says David Mantel, president of Zomba Music Publishing. \"Everybody understands their business, their numbers, their bank account situation. That is not necessarily true in other genres.\" Yet even when publishers are ready to spend money to sign urban writers, breaking into the market is not easy to do. First, a publisher has to work with credible artists, writers and producers to attract top urban music creators, says Danny Stnck. Sony/ATV Music Publishing U.S. president. Next, the pub- lisher has to establish a track record. \"The urban community is really word-of- mouth.\" Strick says. \"As soon as you're hot. everybody knows it. When a company is doing well — is active on the charts — people notice that.\" Then the publisher has to fmd a way into the creative team that emanates around a production company and artists associated with the company, like 50 Cent and the G Unit camp. Publishers who successfully work with any- one associated with a camp have a good chance of working with others on that team. And just looking at the top of the charts in any given week will show just how well that teamwork pays off. •••• I've midem A Reed MIDEM quality event Register now and save up to 50%* in me, come to the source J Music now offers incredible opportunities.

LLEWELLYN | Rock En N Rolls Back To States Miami's Carnival Center To Host Spanish-Language Rock Tour's First U.S. Show In Four Years MADRID — Four years on, Rock EnRis backintheU.S.A. Organizers of the annual multicountry series of Spanish- language rock events last held a show in the United States in October 2002, but declined to include U.S. dates between 2003 and 2(K)S. Blamed were a dearth of local sponsorship and a lack of interest in rock en Espaftol. Now the October opening of new Miami venue the Carnival Center for the Performing Arts (initially named the Miami Per- forming Arts Center) has led to a low-key revival of the U.S. leg of Rock En N's tour of the Amer- icas. \"It was the perfect oppor- tunity to return to the U.S..\" Rock En R coordinator Xavier Novaes says. \"This will be our first-ever concert in Miami.\" If the Oct. 28 show proves successful, Novaes adds, \"[it] could facilitate our presence each year in the States. Let's hope the impact reaches far — to New York, Los Angeles. Chicago and so on.\" Novaes is event organizer at Fundacibn Autor. the nonprofit promotional arm of Spanish authors' and publishers' soci- ety SGAE. Fundacion Autor launched Rock En N in 2000 to promote Spanish-language rock music through U.S. and Latin American concerts. SGAE says it funds Rock En N through Fundacion Autor as an educational exercise rather than a financial one, although shows also rely on local sponsor- ship from individual territories. The MPAC Foundation, for ex- ample, is fijnding acts' hotel and local transport costs plus fees for the Miami concerts; Fundaci6n Autor pays for flights and visas. \"We are delighted at the MPAC collaboration,\" Novaes adds, \"and hope it will lead to a definitive return of Rock En R to the States.\" Rock En generally visits six or seven countries, with Fun- dacion Autor inviting Spanish and Latin American artists to play different dates and local acts added to perform in their own home territories. In 2002, Rock En fJ shows took place in Anaheim, Calif., and Los Angeles (Billboard, Oct. 12. 2002) but the following year, no U.S. shows were scheduled. Novaes complained then that domestic media was \"turning a deaf ear to rock en Espanol\" (Billboard. Nov. 15.2003). The Fundaci6n Autor execu- tive says he saw an opportunity to try again when he learned the Carnival Center's inauguration would coincide with this year's ttl-OBALNEWSLINE »>AUSSIE MUSIC SALES RISE The trade value of the Australian recorded-music market rose to $224 million Australian ($170.2 million) in the six months through June 2006, up 5.8% compared with the corresponding period in 2005. According to the Australian Recording Industry Assn., digital sales leapt 394.98% to 9.4 million tracks, with a trade value of $12.2 million Australian ($9.2 million), up 306%. That performance is widely attributed to the launch of Apple Computer's ITunes Music Store in Australia last October. CD album shipments rose 17.04% during the first half to 20.4 million units, although retail price pressure meant value rose only 4.7% to $185.4 million Australian ($140.9 million). In a statement, ARIA said It remains optimistic \"that a strong release schedule for the remainder of 2006 will ensure that this year continues to be positive for the industry.\" —Christie Efiezer >»ACADEMY SALE BEING STUDIED The U.K. government's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has referred the planned acquisition of a malority stake In U.K. venue operator Academy Music Holdings to antitrust body the Competition Commission <CC). Hamsard, an Investment vehicle Jointly controlled by Live Nation (Music) U.K. and Gaiety Investments, the Irish music promotion company, announced in August that it intended to buy a 51% stake In Academy Music, Jointly held by U.K. investment fund companies RJD Partners and F&C Private Equity Trust (Billboard, Aug. 12). In a statement, OFT CEO John Fingleton said the body had considered the effect such a purchase would have on competition among Indoor live music venues in London. \"Non-competitor third-party concerns about this merger were coherent and consistent,\" Singleton said, \"and supported the OFTs analysis.\" The CC has a 24-week period in which It must undertake its Investigation and report its findings. —Lars Brandie »>EMI FRANCE LAUNCHES WAP SITE EMI Music France has launched a wireless application protocol site, EMI Mobile, through Gallery, the multimedia service available on the three French mobile networks: Orange, SFR and Bouygues Telecom. The new service, powered by French digital service provider Moblvlllage, allows customers to buy ringtones from EMI's catalog for €3 ($3.83) each. The service will additionally provide customers with mini-biographies, tour dates, album covers and \"anything that can add value to the customer experience,\" EMI France deputy director/VP of strategy and development Morvan Boury says. Video content should t>e available shortly, but full-track downloads are not planned in the short term. Boury says EMI Mobile will push current hit repertoire and new acts. —Aymeric Pichevin tour and swiftly contacted venue operator the Miami Performing Arts Center Foundation. The Miami tour opener at the center's 2,500-capacity theatre features Grammy Award- winning Colombian duo Ater- ciopelados (Nacionat Records). Barcelona-based multi-ethnic group Macaco (EMI) and Miami-based Spanish-bom soft- rock artist Javier Garcia ( Surco) — \"a fair representation of what is understood in Miami as rock en Espaflol,\" Novaes says. The tour ends Nov. 11 in Buenos Aires after passing through Mexico. Venezuela and Uruguay. Artists are still being selected for the Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina dates. Novaes acknowledges the Miami concert could be a chal- lenge, noting that rock en Es- paflol is more associated with such music centers as Los An- geles or New York whereas Miami is more familiar with pop/dance genres. In Miami, Latin rock contin- ues to be a small movement, says Hinsul Lazo of H&L Dis- tributors. Sales of the genre have grown for Lazo. who has a dis- tributor and a brick-and-morlar store — Museo del Disco — in the city. But Lazo attributes those sales to new immigrants who yearn for the sounds of their na- tive countries, as opposed to a home-grown movement. \"Nationally, there are pock- ets of sales for Latin rock,\" Lazo says. \"New Jersey, New York. Los Angeles. But we're not talking even close to mainstream [Latin]. Again, it all goes back to radio.\" he says, noting that there are no full-time Latin rock sta- tions in the United States. Fernando Gonzalez, curator of jazz programming at the Car- nival Center, says that \"precisely one of the reasons Rock En N has not been in Miami is that there has not been a place [to playj. For rock here, the options often have been either the (20,000<apacity American Airlines Arena] or a small theater or club.\" Madrid-based EMI Spain president Manolo Diaz admits Miami itself \"is not a good market for Latin rock.\" Diaz returned to Spain two years ago after 16 years as a record label executive in Miami, including two years chairing the Latin Recording Academy. Despite his comments, he calls Rock En N's U.S. return \"excellent news.\" Macaco's latest album, \"In- gravitto,\" was released in March in Spain, where Diaz says it has sold 22.000 units, and rolled out in several continental European markets in July. If the response to Rock En N is favorable, he says, \"we could even consider a U.S. release for 'Ingravitto.' \" >»MUSICBRIGADE, SONY BMG DEAL Stockholm-based digital content aggregator Musicbrigade has struck a Pan-European content deal with Sony BMG whereby the Swedish company will deliver audio and video content from the major via its subscript! on -based and a la carte digital music offerings. The deal extends an agreement between the two firms, dating from 2000, that covered Just Norway and Sweden. The 10 territories covered by the new deal Include the United Kingdom, Germany and France.

But even with Glastonbury's vacation, many new events found business challenging, raising fears they may not survive next summer, when the juggernaut of U.K. outdoor music events is set to return, bigger than ever. \"In terms of income for festivals, it must have been the high- est ever, even vkithout Glastonbury,\" says Martin Elboume. music director of the legendary festival, which raked in more than / 15 million {S28 milUonj from ticket sales alone in 2005. His sentiments are echoed by Live Nation U.K. managing di- rector Stuart Galbraith, who boasts, 'The festivals scene is very, very healthy, without a shadow of a doubt.\" But traffic to the numerous upstart and \"boutique\" events wasn't always as hasty, promoters confirm. \" It was a tough year actually. It certainly wasn't a slam-dunk,\" says Melvin Benn, managing director of London-based Mean Fiddler Music Group, which also handles operational management for Glastonbury. \"A number of festivals got off the blocks this year thinking it would be very easy with Glastonbury not there. That didn't prove to be the case.\" M FMG this year launched its new boutique Latitude festival in July. Although he admits losing money on the 15,000-capacity multifaceted festival, Benn says Latitude will return. Glastonbury skipped this year to allow the site — Michael Eavis* farm in Somerset, southwest England — time to regenerate. But its absence did not seem to translate to an extra 120,000-plus people searching for alternative entertainment — one casualty was the Lost Weekend festival in Devon, a spinoff from Glaston- bury's Lost Vagueness field that was canceled after poor ticket sales. \"Most of the new festivals suffered,\" Elbourne says, \"so dearly there was some market saturation.\" At least 45 outdoor festivals rolled out in the United Kingdom and Ireland in 2006, in a season that now stretches from mid- May to mid-September. Festival promoters, however, were typi- cally guarded on their grosses, with just two Irish events — Dublin's Download Festival ($4,725,059) and Kilkenny Source Festival ($1,613,043) — reporting to Billboard Boxscore so far. The king-hitters again proved to be the well-established events such as V. the Carling Weekend Reading and Leeds festivals, Isle of Wight and T in the Park, which all sold out their respective ca- pacities in record time. Reading alone generated /8.1 million {$1 5.4 million) in ticket revenue within one hour of going on sale. \"It's now a rite of passage for a young person to go to a festi- val in the summer.\" says John Giddings, managing director of Solo, the London-based promoters of the Isle of Wight festival. \"It's a better way of hanging out with your mates and having a good time than going on holiday.\" Demand for tickets to the biggest brands is now so high some organizers have already released tickets for their 2007 edition, months before a single band is announced. Metal event Down- load, V and Reading and Leeds are among those to have issued thousands of presale tickets. Giddings is blunt on the phenome- non: \"They're doing that to get the money in the bank and earn in- terest- It's called greed.\" Festival organizers that are preselling tickets for 2007 events say it ensures core fans do not miss out. Generally, the rise of small regional festivals — such as Beau- Musk fans gathered July 8-9 for Scotland's T In the Park festival. tiful Days (Devon). Wicker Man (Dundrennan) and Bestival (Isle of Wight) — is a positive trend, promoters say. But those promot- ers hungry for a piece of the festivals' pie are warned to come to market with a watertight concept. And be prepared to do battle with the heavyweights. \"If you are not part of the MCD/Live Nation monopoly, then it is very difficult to get a decent lineup, and [the artist] fees are still stupid.\" Elbourne says. Dennis Desmond's Irish promoter MCD is behind the country's Oxegen and Hi:Fi festivals, among others. MCD and Live Nation co-own the Hamsard investment vehicle, which in turn owns MFMG. Glastonbury, for its part, is poised to return in 2007 revital- ized. Organizers are exploring an expansion of next year's fes- tival to a 1 75,000 capacity, subject to license approval. Eavis says Australian pop singer Kylie Minogue will be one of the headlin- ers for the June 22-24 event. Promoters both competing against and working closely with the festival are optimistic the \"Glastonbury effect\" won't be a negative one. \" It doesn't make a blind bit of difference. Glaston- bury will sell out in a heartbeat. It's a different experience and it won't affect [Isle of Wight],\" Giddings says. \"I'm still very positive about the business in 2007,\" Benn says. \"Glastonbury doesn't impact on Reading and Leeds and the V. It certainly impacts on other shows, but there's such a buzz about Glastonbury, it could be argued that when Glastonbury is on. more people are interested in festivals generally.\" U.K. Summer Wrap-Up Five Fests, Five Fine Paydays T IN THE PARK VENUE Balado, near Kinross, Scotland DATE July 8-9 TICKET PRICE weekend £97.50 ($185); weekend with camping £115 ($218): £5e.50 ($107) per day ATTENDANCE 75,000 each day (weekend/day split not disclosed) TICKETS AVAILABLE Sold Out PROMOTERS Glasgow-based Big Day Out MEDIA PARTNERS BBC TV, BBC Radio 1,NME HEAOLINERS Red Hot Chili Peppers, the Vi/ho SPONSORS Tennent's Lager, Bacardi, Virgin Mobile, iTurws, Duraceil, Red Bull, Nintendo, Superdrug, Voivic, Scottish Water, Kodak, EA Games THE CARLING MTEEKEND READING AND LEEDS FESTIVALS VENUE Richfield Avenue, Reading; Bramham Park, Leeds DATE Aug. 25-27 TICKET PRICE weekend £135 ($256); £60 ($113) per day ATTENDANCE Reading: 105.000 (60,000 weekend, 15,000 per day); Leeds: 100,000 (62,500 weekend. 12,500 per day) TICKETS AVAILABLE Sold out PROMOTERS London-based Mean Fiddler Music Group MEDIA PARTNERS BBC Radio 1, BBCTV.NME HEAOLINERS Franz Ferdinand, Muse, Pearl Jam SPONSORS Carling, Nokia, Hscali NOKIA ISLE OF WIGHT FESTIVAL VENUE Seaclose Pa"
