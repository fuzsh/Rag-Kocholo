        "text": "All three of my choices (Carry On, Country Girl and Deja Vu) happen to be my all time favorite songs by their respective songwriters. In honorary mention, Woodstock would easily fall into my all-time favorite top 10 list of Rock covers which I prefer to the original and Our House is a far greater song than radio-overplay has turned it into.\n\nCountry Girl\n\nAlmost Cut My Hair\n\nHelpless\n\nBest thing on the album is Garcia’s pedal steel on “Teach Your Children,” an otherwise deeply wack song.\n\nIn general a sadly less than the sum of its parts album compared with the couch album. Love is not coming to us all and bomber jet planes are not turning into butterflies above our nation and I do not embrace this many colored beast.\n\nNever understood why the solo 4+20 was on Deja Vu. Wish Stills would have revisited 'So You've Got A Lover' which deserved to be more than a Springfield outtake. The two Nash songs are kind of annoying imo. The rest is great, and was really the only time (along with the Ohio single) CSNY lived up to their 'concept' in the studio. So:\n\nCountry Girl is one of Neil's best, and suggested he knew how their strengths could compliment his. Shows real arranging skills, leading to that stunning climax, which I wish he would revisit rather than thowing stuff at the wall (not much sticking in the last 20 years)\n\nWoodstock shows what they could do as a band when on the same wavelength.\n\nEverybody I Love You never gets no love, but I like the energy and lead guitar solos and singing and rhythm guitar and wonder why they (never? seldom?) played this live. I could say something nice about the rest of the songs too (other than Nash's) but abiding by the thread rules.\n\nCompletely agree on “Our House”. It is a pitch-perfect pop song. Cleverly, beautifully constructed.\n\nCarry On - not so much for Carry On, but I adore the break into Questions\n\nWoodstock - One of the best guitar intro riffs in rock and roll history, which sets the quality for the rest of the song.\n\n4+20 - the subtlety of the guitar and song knock me out each time. Stills' fingerpicking is wonderful.\n\nAnd I've always liked the cover design, esp. when printed onto the textured cardstock:"
