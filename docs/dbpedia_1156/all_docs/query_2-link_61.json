        "text": "10 Years will be back onstage at a concert venue near you this spring, as the band has booked a 33-date run of the U.S. that will spool out over the months of March and April.\n\nThe trek gets underway March 14 in Pittsburgh, starting in the Eastern U.S. and making its way through the Midwest and Southeast before heading out West and circling back around to finish on April 29 in Harrison, Ohio.\n\nOne of the dates on the run, April 8, will serve as the Official Fan Summit with 10 Years playing 24 Oxford in Las Vegas. During this special show, the group will perform the Feeding the Wolves album in its entirety.\n\nAs for the rest of the run, the band will play a mix of favorites from their extensive catalog. Black Map and VRSTY will provide support throughout the trek. All dates, cities and venues for the run can be viewed at the bottom of this post, while tickets are currently on sale for the spring leg at this location.\n\nThe Jesse Hasek-led band will be out in support of their 2020 album, Violent Allies, and to whet your appetite as the tour dates near, they've just released a new visualizer clip for the song \"Deja Vu\" off the album.\n\nGuitarist Brian Vodinh shares, “’Déjà Vu’ is a song about trying to tune out the monotonous stuff we face in our everyday lives, and find inspiration in new ways. This relates to our songwriting process, but also to our personal lives as well. We can get stuck in the repetitive cycle of reading the same news, looking at social media, and hearing a rehashed version of the same stories over and over. Sometimes it feels good to check-out, turn off your brain and connect to other aspects of life.\" Get a closer look at the video below.\n\n10 Years, \"Deja Vu\"\n\n10 Years 2022 Tour Dates\n\nMarch 14 - Pittsburgh, Pa. @ Crafthouse\n\nMarch 15 - Hampton Beach N.H. @ Wally’s\n\nMarch 16 - Portland, Maine @ Aura\n\nMarch 18 - Lititz, Pa. @ Mickey’s Black Box\n\nMarch 19 - Asbury Park, N.J. @ Asbury Lanes\n\nMarch 21 - Baltimore, Md. @ Ottabar\n\nMarch 22 - Knoxville, Tenn. @ The Concourse\n\nMarch 23 - Nashville, Tenn. @ Basement East\n\nMarch 25 - Jacksonville, N.C. @ Limelight\n\nMarch 26 - Atlanta, Ga. @ The Loft\n\nMarch 27 - Destin, Fla. @ Club LA\n\nMarch 29 - Fayetteville, Ark. @ George’s Majestic\n\nMarch 30 - Tulsa, Okla. @ Vanguard\n\nApril 1 - Dallas, Texas @ Trees\n\nApril 2 - San Antonio, Texas @ The Rock Box\n\nApril 3 - Corpus Christi, Texas @ Brewster Ice House\n\nApril 6 - Phoenix, Ariz. @ Crescent\n\nApril 8 - Las Vegas, Nev. @ 24 Oxford (Fan Summit)\n\nApril 9 - Anaheim, Calif. @ Chain Reaction\n\nApril 10 - Sacramento, Calif. @ Goldfield\n\nApril 12 - Seattle, Wash. @ El Corazon\n\nApril 13 - Portland, Ore. @ Hawthorne Theater\n\nApril 15 - Missoula, Mont. @ Wilma\n\nApril 16 - Spokane, Wash. @ Knitting Factory\n\nApril 17 - Boise, Idaho @ Knitting Factory\n\nApril 19 - Denver, Colo. @ Oriental\n\nApril 20 - Colorado Springs, Colo. @ Black Sheep\n\nApril 22 - Sauget, Ill. @ Pop’s\n\nApril 23 - Indianapolis, Ind. @ The Vogue\n\nApril 24 - Chicago, Ill. @ Bottom Lounge\n\nApril 26 - Flint, Mich. @ Machine Shop\n\nApril 27 - Ft.
