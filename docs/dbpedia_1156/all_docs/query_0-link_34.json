Currently, S15.98-$17.98 iVont-line CDs cairy MAP prices of S10.88-S12.88. With the increase of the MAP j>rice for fmnt-line CDs, the Sony MAP will now range from $11.88- $13.88 (iiillboarti Bulletin. March 13). Danny Yarbrough, president of Sony Music Distribution, con- fumed reports from retail sources at the annual con- vention of the National Assn. of Recording Mer- chandisei-s (NARM), held here March 8-11, that the company is about to raise its MAP price. \"It is our opinion that music is lieing deval- ued,\" he said. \"We have to be more effective in marketing the value of music. We don't think the con.'iumer has the right idea about the value of music. We will continue to work with our marketing department to correct that.\" While Yarbrough did not get sixjcific about such \"devaluation,\" consumer electronics chains and mass merchandisers have been aggressive in using music product as a loss leader in their stores, sparking a music-retail price war. Fallout from that price war has led to Chapter 11 filings by Camelot Music, Peaches Entertainment, and Strawberries, as well as by Wherehouse Entertainment and Kemp Mill Music, the latter two of which subsequently successfully reorganized. When the price war began, the six majors each implemented their own MAP policies, but those early efforts* were considered inef- fective. As the pain felt by the music special- ty merchants moved back up the distribution channel to the labels, however, the majors got more serious with their indi\\idual MAP policies. Currently, all six majors have policies that call for the withholding of advertising funds for an extended period of time, ranging from 90 davs to one year, from accounts that tion. also noted that MAP was a topic at the show. He acknowledged that at meetings with accounts \"ideas have been floated to raise the MAP floor. There are varying IMjints of view as to the wisdom of pursuing that strateg>'.\" Management at the other three majors — EMI Music Distribution, WEA Distribution, and Univer.'ial Music and Video Distribu- tion — could not be reached for comment by press time. Robert Higgins, president of Albany, N.Y.- based Trans World Entertainment Corp., was among those who lobbied the majors for a higher MAP. \"We encourage them to do so,\" he said. \"It is good for the health of the business.\" Tower RecordsA^ideo in West Sacramen- to, Calif., was also at the forefront of accounts asking the majors during NARM to raise MAP. Stan Goman, senior \\T at the chain, said. \"The industry should police the mass-merehant assholes w'ho advertise and sell music at a loss.\" He argued that such pricing devalues music. He noted that in Phoenix, Wal-Mart sold I12's new album, \"Pop,\" a $17.98 list-price equivalent CD. at $10.88. That is below the cost of the title, w'hich has a boxlot coat of $11. While the account-s and lalwls see MAP as a hot i.ssue, they have to tread lightly on the topic. In Tennessee, an as-yet unhealed class- action lawsuit alleges that the six majors used MAI' policies to engage in price-fbdng. Moreover, the Fedei-al Trade Commission has investigated advertising and other busi- ness policies of the six majors. That investi- gation ended earlier this year with no find- ing of WTongdoing. advertise prices below MAP. Jim Caparro, president of PolyCiram Greup Distribution (PGD), said that during NARM he heard from a number of accounts that are trying to pressure P(JD into raising its own MAP. \"I understand their concern,\" he said. \"We need to evaluate w-hether that is the next step in the evolution of our jwlicy.\" Peter Jones, president of BMG Distribu- Source-Tagging Settlement Expected To Come Soon BY DON JEFFREY NARM '97 ORLANDO, Fla.— The National Assn. of Recording Merchandisers (NARM) is scrambling to beat a May 1 trial deadline and reach an out-of-court settlement of a law'suit over the installation of electronic anti-theft tags on CDs. NARM had hoped to announce a resolution of the litigation at its March 8-11 convention here, but the two sides were still talking. Officials said a settlement is close, how- ever, adding that it could come in al)out a week or tw'o. Last yeai*, discount retailer Target Stores and anti-theft technolog>' company Check- point Systems sued NARM over its recom- mendation of competitor Sensonnatic Elec- tronics' system for tagging CDs at the source (during the manufacturing or pack- aging process). They also sued PolyGram Group Distribution, a major record compa- ny that had begun source- tagging. The suit put an end to PolyGram's efforts and to plans by the other majors to start source- Uigging. Barney Cohen, the outgoing NARM chairman and the head of wholesaler Valley Record Distributors, said to members at the convention, \"We lost an entire year to liti- gation. But wo have every reason to believe the litigation will be resolved before the May 1st trial deadline, and ho[)efully it'll be a set- tlement mutually agreeable to NARM and the plaintiffs.\" Robert Schneider, the new NARM chair- man and executive VP of rackjobber Ander- son Merchandisers, told members that source-ta^ngwa«\"one of NARM's highest priorities\" and that the hmnl w jis unanimous in bringing the issue \"to fmition this year.\" Retailers, meanwhile, remain frustrated by the delays in implementing plans. It was at NARM's last convention in (Orlando, four years ago. that Scnsormatic's technology was recommended for source- tagging. Mer- chants say that shrinkage due to external theft can range from 2^^^% of sales. Robert Higgins, president of 479-store Trans World Entertainment, said, \"We would like to see source-tagging move for- wai*d as swiftly as (wssible. We need it.\" Trans World's stores use a mix of Check- point's and Sensormatic's technologj'. \"If it goes to one or the other and we have to change Isome stores], we think it's impor- tant enough and worthwhile,\" Higgins said.

Adam White Director of Strategic Development Ken Sdhlager Business Manager Joellen Sommer Commentar\\^ Don't Stifle Rock's Creative Expansion I BY DAVID FLITNER There are two trends emerpng in analysis of the contemporary music business. One con- cerns the increasingly stolid, almost early- 70s-like demeanor of what was once referred to, accurately enou^'h. as alternative music. The other concerns a flatness in record sales. These phenomena, in case anyone didn't an- ticipate where this was leading, are related. The situation is manifest in the inescapable fact that the same few chords played again and again on acoustic or distorted guitar without effects can, with sufficient repeti- tion, become limiting, ewn boring. Pop songs are like haiku: The limits of the form require the full embrace of imagination. The idea that authentic rock must only be made in a prescribed w^ay, on a certain couple of instru- ments is, on its face, an indulgence in absur- dity In an analogy from the classical realm one might just as easily have decreed: Well, weX-c discovered strings and woodwinds, why don't we just quit there? It did not take long for the Beatles and George Martin to begin experimenting with expanded and diverse instrumentation. This has to do with creatiw growth. It should go without saying that the tri- umvirate of guitar, bass, and drums is the very foundation of rock'n'roll. Great music always has been and, one hopes, always will be their collectire product But the problem with the new de rigueur minimalism — sole reliance on, as one industry observer put it, \"real instruments*^ — is a false authenticity that \\'erges on Luddism. When guitar-based rock (and \"unplugged\" music, as well) origi- nally emerged, it reflected the only instru- mental configurations anyone had, to that point, imagined. But by now we know more, we\\^ heard more, we can do more. So going back — acting as if new tools had never become available — is basically pretending. Just because a good song should still sound good when stripped down to its essentials does not mean it has to be so presented. Should Bob D>'lan, after all, have declined to strap on an electric guitar? Didn't the Beatles' \"We Can Work It Out\" benefit from the pump organ? And although Don Henley's \"All She Wants To Do Is Dance\" might be \\^ry effec- tive on acoustic guitar, didn't all those elec- tronic aspects add excitement? Every reader will undoubtedly think of other examples. How hard can this be? If something sounds good and enhances the music, use it.

Throughout the system lurk the Robert Borks of musical taste. Judge Bork, it will be recalled, w^as the nominee who came up short for the U.S. Supreme Court — and is now a cultural crit- ic — who seemed to evince the astonishing belief that if something was not covered in the Constitution when it was written, it isn't prop- erly the province of government. Say what? By this reasoning, bands are signed large- ly on the basis of how well they fit the crite- rion of sounding exactly like what's already selling. A& R executives, on the peril of dis- missal, must broach no deviation. Everyone then marches along to what is an catiraut, at least until the Next Big Thing, when all those now-superfluous bands that w^ere signed are jettisoned as tax write-offs, and the cycle starts anew. And all the while, the work of scores of fine artists — known and unknown — goes largely unheard. If rock is the genre that breaks the rules, then why is it structured by ever-narrower rules? There is much to be said for touching one's roots, for acknowledging heritage. There are legitimate issues here. They reflect the need for rock to renew itself, the desire to shout its status as the TOice of youthfulness. But this is the dialectic all rewlutions con- front: How do you remain a rebel when you've won the war? Or, how do you remain on the outside when you're on the inside? Having liecome the soundtrack of Western culture, to then eschew sonic exploration in the name of genre purity borders on creative arrested development and is, fundamentally, conser\\'- ative. Music is not rejuvenated by declaring that it cannot grow. Obviously there is a market for varied instrumentation. Look at the upper regions of Billboard's charts. Or listen to the kind of open-minded welcoming of imagination that WNEW New York host Vin Scelsa, for exam- ple, and some bold triple-A programmers ha^'e been advancing. President Lyndon Johnson once observed of the developing world, \"They want what we're got.\" However much this is the case, it is most certainly true of popular culture. It is a major U.S. export. Surely this giws us some latitude for making the most of the richness of expression in a social milieu of 260 million. We need a celebration of the cathoUcity of TOices abounding in popular music, to let loose the grip that seeks the illusion of successful homogeneity. LETTERS PIONEERS OF THE PIONEERS I read with interest and some amusement the recent articles by J.R. Reynolds regard- ing black executives [Billboard, Feb. 1, Feb. 18] in the 1970s and thought he made some good points, especially Larkin Arnold's remark about never having \"ased being black as an excuse.\" As a recipe for success, one couldn't do much better than that Howe\\'er, like many i)eople who came of age during the '70s, Mr. Reynolds, in his article, falls into the trap of rejwrting that everything began with that era. That kind of thinking does a disservice to the black executives of an earlier time, who were the real pioneers. Far from having \"no voice in A&R,\" Joe Thomas and Howard Biggs ran R&B A&R at RCA Victor, Decca, and Columbia's OKeh divi- sion during the *50s. Quincy Jones and Clyde Otis held similar posts at Mercury in the early '60s. Tom Wilson worked in A&R at Colum- bia, producing Simon & Garfunkel, among others. J. Mayo Williams was a staff A&R man at Decca as early as the 1930s. John Burton was in-house attorney for Chess in the '50s. Paul Gayten produced and promoted records and ran the West Coast office of ('hess. Black A&R men at indepen- dent labels during the same period included Willie Dixon (Che.'is), Jesse Stone (Atlantic). Maxwell Davis (Aladdin, Modern). Earl Palmer (Aladdin), J.W. Alexander and Bumps -1 Producer Willie Dixon (left), with Otis Rush Blackwell (Specialty), Richard Barrett (Gone/End), Dave Bartholomew (Imperial), and Hank Mobley (Blue Note). Perhaps the most significant of all was Henry (Jlover. who as far back as the 1940s not only produced R&B acts for King Records, but trawled to Nashville to record hillbilly act-s such as the Delmore Brothers and Moon Mullican. He also recorde<l pop acts such as Steve Lawrence. An arranger and songwriter who had a co-publi.shing deal with King, Glover had a major say in the day-to- day workings of that comiKuiy. After leaving King, Glover produced Arthur Prysock, Billy Bland (\"Let The Little Girl Dance\"), and the Fiesta.s (\"So Fine\") for Old Town, and many other artists, including Dinah Wa-shington and Joey Dee (\"Pepper- mint Twist,\" which Glover wrote) for Roulette Records. The fine efforts of the men whom Mr. Reynolds wrote about would not have l>een pos.sible without the real pioneering efforts of the above-mentioned indhiduals.

N'.V lOTEW 4 BILLBOARD MARCH 22. 1997 - Performance Right Agency Under Legal Fire In Brazil BY ENOR PAIANO SAO PAULO, BrazU— A decision by a Rio de Janeiro court is threatening to undermine that country's centralized system of collecting performance right royalties. On Feb. 20, a judge on the Supreme Court, the highest court in Brazil for cases not involving the national consti- tution, ruled that Brazilian perfor- mance right society Sadembra can col- lect fees on behalf of its member publishers. Under Brazilian law, performance fees are collected by the Central Office of Rights Collection, a government col- lection agency better known by its acronym, ECAD. Those fees are then distributed by ECAD to 10 perfor- mance right societies, including Sadem- bra. Those societies in turn disburse the funds to their member writers. ECAD states that it collected $79 million in performance fees in 1996, and that it expected to collect $100 million in 1997. The judge's decision does not be- come law until it appears in the legal publication Diario Oficial, which is due later this month. However, under Brazihan law, the decision would not take effect if a lawsuit is filed against (Continued on page 100) U2's 'Pop' Hops To Top Of Charts Canadian Retailers Jump The Gun On Street Date BY CHRIS MORRIS LOS ANGELES— As anticipated, U2'8 Island album \"Pop\" pops into the No. 1 slot on The Billboard 200 in its chart debut this week. With U.S. sales of more than 349,000 units, according to Sound- Scan, the Irish band's album easily topped the first-week totals of other albums that have bowed at No. 1 so far this year — Live's \"Secret Sam- adhi\" (more than 227,000), LeAnn Rimes' \"Unchained Melody/The Early Years\" (more than 166,000), and the soundtracks to \"Howard Stem's Private Parts\" (more than 177,000) and \"Gridlock'd\" (more than 150,000). The set also entered charts at No. 1 in more than 18 countries world- wide. In Canada, sales numbers were bolstered by a widespread jump of the March 4 street date that was sparked by the moves of a major Canadian electronics chain. \"By Sun- day morning [March 2], the entire country had U2 on sale,\" says one retail executive. The U.S. unit sales for \"Pop\" places the album among the 20 top- selUng No. 1 debuts since May 1991, when Billboard's album chart began utilizing SoundScan's point-of-sale data. However, the set's debut numbers, when compared with the first-week tallies of past chart-toppers, may tem- per the hopes of those who believed that U2's heavily touted release could jump-start the music industry with record-setting numbers. In terms of albums bowing at No. 1, \"Pop\" is considerably off the total of more than 950,000 units logged by Pearl Jam's \"Vs.\" in its debut week in November 1993.

The Dutch quartet's album turned heads and won hearts on both sides of the Atlantic, inspiring a new generation of alt-rock bands at home and gracing U.S. college airwaves with such ubiquitous singles as \"Tom Boy\" and \"Kid's Allright.\" \"Palomine\" was followed in '95 by \"Lamprey,\" a serious, sprawling work that — contrary to popular belief — matched the sales of the debut as well as upped the artistic ante considerably (Billboard, Nov. 2, 1!)96). On March 25, Matador/Capitol shepherds the U.S. release of \"Dust Bunnies,\" which should please fans of both \"Palomine\" and \"Lamprey,\" as it refracts the light of the first album through the shadows of the second. \"I'd say that this album takes a half-full rather than a half-empty approach to life — it's not so dark as the last album,\" says Bettie guitarist Peter Visser. \"But we worked hard to maintain a tension, a real emo- tional feel to every song.\" Adds drummer Berend Dubbe, BETTtE SERVEERT \"I've alwa>-s thought that 'Palomine' might have been a bit politically cor- rect in that indie-rock kind of way.

Gebhardt, who is also president of Warner Music Central Europe, noted that even before the commencement of the show, the 1997 Echos had become the most successful yet in gaining recognition by the German media and the international music industry. \"Echo has done much to raise music fans' consciousness,\" said Gebhardt. \"With the inception of the Echo Awards, we have created a forum for music produced in Germany which gives young talent a chance of reach- ing a broad audience.\" Staged at the Hamburg Congress Center, the event was broadcast two nights later, for the first time in a Sat- urday prime-time slot, on ARD-TV to an estimated audience of 4.38 million. Its importance in the German market has been compared to that of the Gram- mys in the U.S., the Brit Awards in the U.K. or the Vic- toires in France. The '97 Echos were dominated by well-established national acts on the German scene. The veteran acts who were honored included Peter Maffay (best national male artist). Die Toten Hosen (best national group), Wolfgang Petry (best schlagcr artist). Otto (best national comedy act), and Enigma (most suc- cessful national artist abroad).

With her \"Falling Into You\" album topping charts globally this past year, Dion, unsurprisingly, was named female dion vocalist of the year, beating out Deboi-ah Cox, Lara Fabi- an, Alannah Myles, and Canadian label-mate Amanda Marshall. Dion also won in the best-selling album category for \"Falling Into You,\" which has sold 1.4 million units bo date in Canada, according to the label, and for best-selling francophone album with \"Live A Paris,\" which has sold 280.000 units in Canada to date. In a stripped-down version of her Grammy acceptance speech last month for best album, Dion thanked her fam- ily, her producers, and Canadian label executives, as well as the people of the pro\\ince of Quebec, when accepting the female vocalist award from \"Falling Into You\" co-producer Da\\id Foster. After the show, Dion offered thanks to \"all the people who work in the shad- ows, because I don't write my songs, I don't produce my records.\" As a sign of Canada's arrival in force on the international music scene in the past year, an \"international achieve- ment award\" was bestowed for the first time this year. It went to Dion, Sha- nia Twain, and Ala- nis Morissette. While Twain turned up in a floor- length red evening gown to accept it and her other award, for best female country vocalist, Morissette did not attend. Morissette's song \"Ironic\" was named t)est single of the year, and the Ottawa, Ontario-born singer shared the song- writer of the year award with collabo- rator Glen Ballard for the songs on her \"Jagged Little Pill\" album.

Baker died March 10 at the age of 67 at SL Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York. She had been in ill health in recent years, following strokes and the onset of a diabetic condition that necessitated the amputation of her legs in 1996. According to Lee Hildebrand's BAKEB \"Stars Of Soul And Rhythm & Blues\" (Billboard Books, 1994), Baker, who was bom Nov. 11, 1929, in Chicago, boasted strong musical bloodlines: Her aunt was '30s blues vocalist Merline John- son, known as \"The Yas Yas Girl,\" and blues singer/guitarist Memphis Minnie was a cousin. She made her professional debut in 1947 with Fletcher Henderson's big band. Under the names \"Little Miss Sharecropper\" and \"Bea Baker,\" she recorded sessions for RCA Victor and OKeh in the late '40s and cut sides with Todd Rhodes' band for King in 1952. But success eluded Baker until she arrived at Atlantic Records. In 1955, DJs flipped her cm'er of Lonnie John- son's ballad 'Tomorrow Night\" and turned the B-side, the vivacious ■Tweedlee Dee,\" into a No. 4 R&B hit and a No. 14 pop cro.s80ver. The song marked one of Atlantic's first big incursions into the rock'n'roll market and became the first of a string of top 10 R&B hits for Baker. Baker racked up such follow-up R&B chart-busters as the two-sided hit \"Bop-Ting-A-Ling\"/\"That's All I Need\" (No. 3 and No. 6, respectively, in 1955); \"Play It Fair\" (No. 2 in '55); and another two-sided winner, \"Still'TI Can't Love You Enough\" (No. 4 and No. 7, respectively, in ig.'ifi). Her biggest K&B hit was \"Jim Dandy,\" which rose to No. 1 in 1956, but \"I Cried A Tear\" became her miyor pop success, cUmbing to No. 6 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart in 19.W. That same year, she saluted her blues roots with the album \"LaVern Baker Sings Be.ssie Smith.\" Baker continued to produce spunky R&B hits for Atlantic into the '60s, including the gospelized \"Shake A Hand\" (No. 13 in 1960), \"Saved\" (No. 17 in 1961), and a funky cover of \"See See Rider\" (No. 9 in 1962; the song was a bigger pop hit on Atlantic for Chuck Willis, as \"C.C. Rider,\" in 1957). In the early '60s, her less sophisti- cated style of R&B was increasingly pushed aside on the charts by the ascent of Motown's pop-conscious sound. Baker parted company with Atlantic in 1964 and signed with Brunswick Records; her last appear- ance in the R&B top 40 was a 1966 duet with Jackie Wilson, \"Think Twice.\" Baker continued to perform through the '60s and toured South- east Asia for the USD during the Vietnam War. After falling ill during a \\9eS appearance in Hong Kong, she was hospitalized in the Philippines, where she resided for the next 19 years, serving at one point as the entertainment director at the U.S. naval ba.se in Subic Bay. Baker remained in self-imposed exile until 1988, when she appeared in New York for Atlantic's star-stud- ded 40th anniversary celebration. Two years later, she succeeded her Atlantic labelmate Ruth Brown in the Broadway musical \"Black And Blue.\" She also appeared at New York's Village Gate in 1991 and toured the U.K. in 1992. As late as 1995, she played two weeks of L-A. dates at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel's CinegrOL Windham Hill Records Alters Its Course New Age Label Moves Imprints In Niche Directions m BY BRADLEY BAMBARGER NEW YORK— Windham HUl Records and its affiliated labels — Private Music, High Street Records, and Dancing Cat — have been reorganized as the Windham Hill Group (Billboard Bul- letin, March 6). The four imprints will each have a niche focus in various strains of adult- oriented instrumental, blues, folk, and world music, with the overall group \"taking advantage of the best label tri^cmark,\" says Steve Vining, Wind- ham Hill Group president. \"We know from retailers and consumers that Windham Hill has the best name recognition.\" Established in 1976, Windham Hill quickly became synonymous with the burgeoning new age genre with such artists as pianists George Winston and David Arkenstone. The label entered into a partnership with BMG Enter- tainment North America in 1992 before becoming a full unit of BMG last year. Windham Hill Records' most suc- cessful album is Winston's \"December\" from 1983, which has sold more than 4 million copies, according to the label. Released in late January, pianist Jim Brickman's \"Picture This\" album reached No. 30 on The Billboard 200, the highest position yet for a Windham Hill album. The sales for \"Picture This\" have been fueled by the mainstream radio success of the single \"Valentine,\" a duet with vocalist Martina McBride (Billboani, March 8). The Windham Hill aesthetic will evolve to include more crossover col- laborations between instrumentalists and vocalists, according to VP of A&R Larry Hamby (who recently joined the label after tenures at A&M, Epic, and Columbia). \"I have a deep respect for the tradition of Windham Hill, but there's no reason that this music can't grow,\" he says. \"I want to make records with great instrumental musi- cians, but not necessarily limiting those records to instrumental material. But, ultimately, these developments will come from the artists, not the execu- tives.\" Based in Beverlv Hills, Calif., the Windham Hill Group has approxi- mately 40 staff members, including a new Southeastern sales manager (in addition to sales managers in New York, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis). Earlier this year. Private Music was brought into the Windham Hill fold, with only a few members of its 35- person staff re- tained (Billboard, Jan. 25). Currently. WINSTON the label is search- ing for an A&R ex- ecutive. Founded in 1986, Private Music has released albums by artists as diverse as guitarist Andy Summers and bassis Vkey board ist Patrick O'Heam and has seen enormous commercial success with new age keyboardist Yanni. His '94 set \"U\\'e At The Acrop- olis\" is the label's best-selling release at more than 3.1 million copies, accord- ing to SoundScan. Aside from issuing a Yanni compila- tion in late April and exploiting his cat- alog (he has since signed with Virgin), Private Music will be moving away from contemporary instrumental to- ward more blues-oriented material, according to Vining. Taj MahaPs \"Phantom Blues\" was nominated for a Grammy this year, and the label has an album by Etta James, \"Love's Been Rough On Me,\" on tap for April. Future releases are also due from Leo Kottke. Kenny Rankin, and Mahal. The most successful High Street releases so far have come from New Orleans rock band the Subdudes, in- (Continued on page 101) Amuro Tops Japan's Gold Discs Continues Winning Streak ForAvex ■ BY STEVE McCLURE TOKYO — Popular dance/pop singer Namie Amuro capped a year of tri- umph by wimiing the domestic artist of the year award at the Recording Industry Assn. of Japan's (RIAJ) 11th annual Gold Disc Awards ceremony March 5 here. The Okinawan female vocalist, now signed to Avex Trax. sold 4.25 million albums and 4.68 million singles (includ- ing sales when .she was under contract toToshiba-EMI) from Jan. 21. 1996, to Jan. 20, 1997 — more than any other Japanese artist, according to the RIAJ. It was the third year in a row that an Avex Trax act won the award. Dance/ pop group trf won the previous two years. Wmning the corresponding award in the international category was Danish female duo Me & My (Toshiba-EMI), who moved 1.29 million albums and 64,663 singles, according to the RIAJ. Me & My also copped the foreign album of the year award for \"Dub-I- Dub,\" which sold 1.27 million units in Japan. Gold Disc Awards are based on RIAJ sales data, with returns factored into the results. The top-selling domestic single was \"Namonald Uta,\" by popYock band Mr. Children (Toy's Factory), which sold 2.45 million copies, while the No. 1 for- eign single, at 302,793 units, was \"Now You're Not Here\" (Japanese title: \"Anata Ni Ite Hoshii\") by U.K. duo Swing Out Sister, who recorded the track in Tokyo and performed it live at the Gold Disc Awards show at Tokyo's NHK Hall. The show was broadcast live on NHK satellite TV. Richard Carpenter was on hand to accept a special Gold Dii%c Award for \"22 HiU Of The Carpenters\" (Polydor K.K.), which has sold more than 2 mil- lion copies here since it was released in November 1995.

Son Volt's bow included the song \"Drown,\" which reached the top 10 of the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, while a videoclip for the sin- gle garnered airplay on VHl. The exposure helped \"Trace\" reach No. 7 on the Heatseekers album chart. The band — which rose out of the Uncle Tupelo split that also spawned Reprise's Wilco — recorded its debut album before it had ever performed live. \"Straightaways,\" however, comes after more than a year of touring and was actually recorded during two brief breaks in road- work. \"The idea is that this recording should sort of reflect the coalescence of the band over the course of play- ing on the road for a year,\" says Son Volt singer/songwriter Jay Farrar, whose songs are published by Warn- er-Tamerlane/Grain Elevator Songs (BMI). There are also some other changes on the album. For example, \"Been Set Free\" is a twist of the tradition- . ml A SON VOLT al ballad \"Lilli SchuU,\" which Uncle Tupelo recorded on the album \"March 16-20, 1992.\" Explains Far- rar, \"It's written from a different perspective, from a woman's.\" Yet Farrar didn't come up with the con- cept alone. \"My wife wrote the first verse,\" he admits. \"It's something I probably would have never thought of on my own.\" Farrar, who worked in Uncle Tupelo with Son Volt drummer Mike Heidorn for four albums, finds the success of \"Trace\" surprising. \"I didn't really go in with any pre- conceived ideas of what the reaction would be, but for the most part, I was surprised that it was played on the radio,\" he says. Warner Bros., which began its association with Farrar with Uncle Tupelo's 1993 Sire/Reprise release, \"Anodyne,\" sees the success of Folk Implosion Forgoes Major For Indie Label Communion LOS ANGELES— After scoring a top five modern rock hit, most acts would have left the indie world behind and moved on to a m^or label. But the Folk Implosion isn't like most act«. \"Dare To Be Surprised,\" the duo's full-length follow-up to the \"Kids\" soundtrack, which featured the hit \"Natural One,\" will be released April 22 on San Frandsco-based Communion Records, ratber than a msgor. \"Natural One\" reached No. 4 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart in Decem- ber 1995, and by March 1996, it had reached No. 20 on the Hot 100. Certainly the Folk Implosion — which consists of Lou Barlow of Sebadoh and John Davis, a solo artist in his own right — could have made the move to a major. London — which released \"Natural One\" and the \"Kids\" soundtrack as a one-off — expressed interest in the band, and the duo's deal FOLK IMPLOSION with Communion is a friendly hand- shake agreement \"As I got to know [Communion owner] Gary [Latham], I thought it would be kind of interesting to stay totally indie,\" says Barlow, who is signed to Sub Pop as a member of Sebadoh. \"We just sort of decided early on that it was a total learning experi- (Continued on vaae IS) CROPHONES ONEGl PERFORMER DESERVES ANOTHER.

Anka expects to complete the record by midsum- mer and release it in the fall on a Sony-distributed label. Hail hail, ROCK'N'ROLL: God bless Metallica. Here's one superstar act whose members haven't for- gotten what it's like to be a fan. Their March 10 show at New York's Madison Square Garden boasted one of the most innovative, audience-friendly stages I've ever seen. Taking up two-thirds of the Garden floor, the setup was a wacky modification of the in-the-round concept, with a large stage shaped like the body of an electric guitar and a smaller stage shaped like — for lack of a better description — a flower with extended petals. The band split its time between the two stages so that everyone in the sold-out house got a good view at some point. Barri- cades between the stage and the crowd created a virtu- al moat, where the band members could play and get close to the fans. In addition to putting on a tremendously powerful, crisp show that featured more pyrotechnics than clos- ing night at a state fair, the band went out of its way dur- ing the 2'/i-hour concert to include the audience without ever seeming obsequious, often applauding back at the crowd after a particularly good reception or cheering on fans without resorting to the same old cliches. Most remarkably, between the end of the set and the first of two encores, the band turned up the house lights and spent a good five minutes walking around the moat, shaking hands, passing out guitar picks, throwing out drumsticks, and basically doing everything but kissing babies. In a world where so many artists act like the only contact they should have with their fans is at the cash register, this was a refreshing and welcome sight.

A mere six years, one honorable- mention certificate, and a highly pub- lic bidding war later, the precocious 15-year-old is hoping his newest material will be recognized by a much larger audience. \"Restraining Bolt,\" the debut album by the Greenville, Texas-based threesome, will be released April 22. Though Kweller, drummer John Kent (17), and bassist Bryan Blur (29) make up a youthful trio, the act has undergone personnel changes worthy of a veteran rock band. In fact, Kweller, who played in neighborhood bands Mirage and Green Eggs & Ham, is the only founding member of Radish. Kent became the act's drummer in 1994, and Blur was added to the lineup only after Radish had recorded a three- The Gramm/is are easy as ©-©-© at Conway Recording Studios Studio Q Beck - \"Odelay\" Alternative Music Performance and Male Rock Vocal Performance Produced and Engineered by The Dust Brothers Studio © Eric Clapton - \"Change the World\" Song of the Year and Record of the Year Produced by Babyface Mixed by Mick Guzauski Studio Lyie Lovett - \"Road to Ensanada\" Country Album of the Year Produced by LyIe Lovett & Billy Williams Recorded and Mixed by Nathaniel Kunkel Congratulations to all the Grammy winners from Buddy and Susan Brundo and the staff at Conway Recording Studios 00 Melrose HoM d 9 0 0 3 8 song demo tape with the album's co- producer Roger Greenawalt. (Noted alternative producers Paul Q. Kolderie and Sean Slade produced the bulk of the set.) According to Kweller, the label pursuit that ensued after Greenawalt began shopping the tape was a bit of a shock. \"A label had put us up in Los Ange- les at the Sunset Marquis, and every- one from Morrissey to Chris Farley to Kato Kaelin was walking around,\" says Kweller. \"I was like, 'Why are we here?* I just had to keep my cool and keep telling myself, 'I'm just a songwriter.* \" Indeed, Kweller*s songwriting has been largely responsible for the label attention. From the simple high school blues motif in \"Failing & Leav- ing\" to the more weighty subject matter of church burning in \"Dear Aunt Arctica,\" Kweller maintains a pronounced aptitude for creating hook-laden, instantly likable rock music. \"The record they made exceeded our fondest hopes,\" says Mercury president Danny Goldberg, who signed the band. \"There's a certain mixed blessing to a high-profile sign- ing, but ultimately IRadish] is going to live and die by the quality of their songs.\" Mercury director of product de\\*el- opment Madelyn Scarpulla says mar- keting the album will be largely focused on the band's home base. In October 199fi, Mercury released a CD single exclusively to Dallas rock radio; on it were album cuts \"Dear Aunt Arctica\" and \"Bedtime.\" The lal>el al.'io made the single available at local retail outlets, where it sold more than 2,000 units, according to Sound- Scan. Scarpulla says Dallas consumers purchasing \"Restraining Bolt\" can request from retail personnel a free three-song CD sampler, which includes a track not on the album. The album will be featured predom- inantly in local positioning and lis- tening station programs, as well as in RADISH co-op advertising campaigns. To keep momentum in the market, the group will perform at a showcase for area music merchants and radio executives. \"We're going to concentrate on the Texas market initially and hope that whatever airplay they get out of the box will begin an outward geograph- ical spiral,\" says Scarpulla. \"I hate to use catch phrases like 'micromarketing' and 'regionalizing,' but that's the way you market a band,\" she adds. \"We're just hoping the story builds naturally.\" On March 24, Mercury will service college radio with \"Little Pink Stars.\" A week later, the track will go to modern and mainstream rock out- lets. Modern rock KDGE Dallas PD Joel Folger says local fervor over the act has built since the station put \"Dear Aunt Arctica\" in power rota- tion. \"These kids are stars.\" he says. \"They played live at our Christmas show, and it was just a huge success. It's no wonder there were so many labels interested in them.\" The band, which has been working with local booking agents, will play venues in Texas and Arkansas through April. Kweller, who is being tutored on the road, says the band will avoid playing larger venues until it can develop a core following. \"It's a much more personal atmos- phere, and since I'm 15. people are very skeptical about our music,\" he says. \"We win most of our fans though live shows, and if people see us really working and doing what all bands do, it should help us build some credibility.\" While Radish has been able to play all-ages clubs and certain venues where Kweller was accompanied by his parents, the age factor has proved intrusive at times. Often, the band has found alterna- tive venues, such as school dances and pool halls, more amicable. In fact, a video for \"Little Pink Stars\" directed by Steve Hanst (Beck, the Cure, Veruca Salt) was shot in the pool hall in which Radish had its first performance. Still, Kweller fears that a proposed Texas law banning anyone under 21 from clubs could wreak havoc on the act's tour plans. UTiile Kweller's age figures to play prominently in the press and con- sumers' minds. Goldberg says the signing of Radish — as well as Han- son, three brothers all 16 or under — is incidental to the quality of their music. Still, he admits that an added degree of responsibility is required. \"There's a certain amount of logical sensitivity from day one that we have to be concerned about, hut ultimate- ly, it's about the music. 1 Kweller] is a great writer, and this is about letting him do his thing, but making sure he's surrounded on a day-to-day basis with good advice.\" Goldberg notes that the label is signing artists of all ages. \"We also signed Allen Ginsberg, who turns 70 in June,\" he says. Kweller. too. maintains that his music speaks for it^ielf \"When Roger was giving people the cassette, he wasn't saying. 'Check out this 15- year-old genius. Here's the next Sil- verchair, blah, blah, blah, blah,\" \" he says. \"So I really think the music is what got us here.\" Radish is managed by Alliance Entertainment Group in Dallas. WARNER BROS.

On the radio front, the label will grease the rails with a promotional EP featuring the album track \"Back Into Your World\" and three nonal- bum or live tracks, which will be ser- viced to college and public radio out- lets in early April to alert the band's core fans about the album's forth- coming release. Simultaneously, the label will ship \"Back Into Your World\" to triple-A stations. Eventually, Warner Bros, will bring the track \"Caryatid Easy\" to mainstream and modern rock. In addition, the band will be fea- tured May 18 performing songs from \"Straightaways\" on the public radio program \"E-Town.\" Of course, Warner Bros, will con- tinue to utilize the band's strength on the road as a key to the cam- paign. \"They will start a headlining tour Ibooked by Monterey Peninsu- la Artists] almost three weeks before the album comes out. which will be a great setup.\" Standish says. \"This is a band that really devotes a lot of time on the road, nurturing a fan base, and it has real- ly paid off.\" The label is also expecting a strong press reaction to \"Straight- aways.\" Says Standish, \"Press is really an important outlet for this band. They got great press on the last album, and we are anticipating great press on this album as well.\" Warner Bros, will also plug Son Volt on its World Wide Web site. \"Since this is a big word-of-mouth band, we plan to actively promote them on the Web site, where it is important to work artists like that,** says Standish. In addition, Standish feels that Son Volt may benefit from the inter- est in Wilco, just as Wilco enjoyed a boost from the initial publicity fol- lowing the release of \"Trace.\" Says Standish, \"There is some spillover between the bands, and a fair amount of exclusive fans, but both bands do benefit.\" Son Volt has also made some fans at retail. Joel Oberstein, director of retail operations for the Simi Val- ley, Calif.-based, 10-store Tempo Music and Video chain, gives \"Straightaways\" the thumbs up. \"It's a great record, and I think they are going to continue to broad- en the audience they built with 'Trace,' \" he says. Oberstein predicts that the band will once again find a home at radio. \"The new Wilco sounds great on the radio, and I think this will, too.** 14 BILLBOARD MARCH 22. 1997 I^IORE GOOI^EWS ABOUT I rj V \"A sexy singing bear...WOW!\" -NEWSWEEK GRAMMY WIWIVER! \"Bes( Classical kal Pcrlorniance\" Opera Arias - Levine/Metropolitan Opera Orchestra ] 4 Bin N TE RFEL i \"SIMPLY SPECTACULAR...I doubt these songs have been sung better by anybody who ever set foot on a Broadway stage.\" -new yom DAiiy news a PoJyGram cofnpany http://www.dgc)assics.cani /%s seen on \"CBS Sunday, file \"Late Sliow\" i^iflli Da'vicl Letferman and in \"People\" l^agazine Photo: Jordan Donei/DGQ GRAMMY WIlVl\\fERI \"Best Choral Pei'lorniaiice\" Watton: Belshazzar's Feast - Utton/Boumemouth Symphony '-ALXD CRUWN lAtPUUAL .

The decision to remain independent also was appropriate because of the musical approach the band opted to take on the album. \"We made this record really cheaply and never stepped up in the studio,\" Barlow explains, adding that most of the album was recorded on an 8-track DAT player. Kven with the low-budget produc- tion, \"Dare To Be Surprised\" is sur- prisingly accessible and catchy. The album's first single, \"Pole Posi- tion,\" was shipped to college and mod- ern rock i-ulio Feb. 19 and to ret^iil Feb. 24. A second track. \"Insinuation,\" which Latham describes as \"more in the 'Kids'-era style,\" will go lo radio in early April. To work the tracks at radio, ('om- munion has hired the Santa Monica, Calif.-baseti Arms Division, which also promoted \"Natural One.\" Autotonic in Memphis will handle promotion at col- lege and NPR stations. In addition, the Folk Implosion will support the release with a promotional tour, which will consist of in-stores and a few intimate dates, beginning with a March 12 date in Denver. Stops will include in-stores at the HMV stores in Toronto and New York, the Virgin Megastore in San Francisco, and the Roxy and McCabe's Guitar Shop in the L.A. area. For Davis, who only quit his job as a librarian in late February, and Barlow, who only recently wrapped weeks of touring with Sebadoh, the road trek will be a challenge. \"John and I hadn't had time to get together yet to figure things out,\" Barlow says. \"It's going to be a total challer^re. It's going to Ik? kind of exciting to flesh out the Folk Implosion as a live entity and a little scary.\" The short promo tour should help drum up business at retail. \"They came from nowhere in the general public's mind with the 'Kids' soundtrack,\" says Bob Say, VP of operations for the six- store, Reseda, Calif-'based Moby Disc chain. \"But the band has a hip follow- ing and the pre.'^s is into it, so hoi>efu!- ly people will find out about it and come in and buy it.

But in the first couple of months of 1997, this richly melodic, soulful power pop quartet has taken off like a rocket. With an excellent 199f) debut album pi-oduced by Rick Clark (an occasional Billboard contributor) and recorded at Memphis* Ardent Studios, as well as a series of piicked local gigs laying the groundwork, the Imnd won the Nashville Grammy showcase in January and then nabbed the liest unsigned band category at the Nash\\TlIe Music Awards, held in Februai'y at the historic Ryman Auditorium. \"Yeah, we were up there with Vince Gill.

In Vd^, Silver released \"You & Me & Hell,\" a collection of bristling guitar rock tunes with brains. In January, she followed with a fi\\^'- song EIJ \"Trailers,\" both on Fingerprint Records. \"You & Me & Hell\" was cho- sen as one of the top 10 records of 1996 in The Boston Herakl. Also in January, Silver won the Boston Grammy showcase. Currently she's fine-tuning her live show at rock clubs the Middle East, T.T. the Bear's, and Mama Kin. as well as crossover clubs like the more intimate Lizard Lounge and Toads. Her music captures the emotional intensity of an artist like Liz Phair, but with more pop smarts and musical .savvy. There's a muscular musicality that is rare for someone just finding her voice. \"Ewrythingyou write is going to be per- sonal on some lewl, but it does haw to speak to a larger audience. If it doesn't, then I'm not sure there's a point,\" Silver says. \"Ev^ry time I write a song, I think I'm learn- ing something new and impnn'ing. The same goes with playing li\\^. Each show teaches me something, and no doubt there's still a lot t« learn, but I'm getting there.\" Contact Silvxjr at 508-34fr4577. ken capobianco MIAMI: Cosmic and melodic, the \"glitter pc^\" music of Al*8 Not Well has late- ly been out of this world, or at least out of the state. Prior to releiising its new 12-song, self-titled album on Panacea Records, this female-fronted quintet with a penchant for neon-colored hair, plastic-flowered stage clothes, and upbeat, hook-filled sonic pop songs took to the road to test the new material, hitting Atlanta, Shreveport La., and New Orleans, just in time for Mardi (Jraa. The hand's music has already registered airplay on more than stations in the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida, Vir^nia, and Louisiana. \"The tour went espe- cially great diunng Mardi (Iras,\" .lays pereiLs- sionist Eddy. \"Ewr\\'one was dre.'ised up funny and partying. We fit right in.\" The album release party, with a theatrical B-52's-type stage show, took place at Tobacco Road, the oldest blues-rock club in Miami, and was attendwl by several hundred people. The l>and formed two years ago when lead singer/song- writer Joce hooked up with Eddy, bassist Rick, drummer Kala, and singer Bleu, the space-cadet blonde who creates the band's futuristic flow^r-pcfwer look. \"We pla>*e<l a few shows and just went. 'Wow, this is really work- ing great! They make my songs sound the way they should,' \" says Joce. And the band's name? \"Al was in my band before.\" Joce says, \"but he did things so oddly, and we would just say, *0h Al's not well, don't mind him.' The phrase just kept coming up.\" Having played a recent Grammy Unsigned showcase, the band is now touring regionally in suRMrt of the album. Contact 3aS-888-9937. S.\\NDRASCHULMAN AL S NOT WELL 18 BILLBOARD MARCH 22. 1997 And the BEST CLASSICAL ENGINEERED RECORDING Copland; Dance Symphony CLASSICAL PRODUCER OF THE YEAR Joanna Nickrenz Artists & Music MATADOR/CAPITOL TEAM UP FOR BETTIE SERVEERT S 3RD SET (Continued from ixige 9) energetic interplay of Dubbe and bassist Herman Bunskoeke on \"Pork & Beans,\" and the ensemble dynamics of the spirited \"(Jeek.\" \"Dust Bunnies\" came out earlier this month on Brinkman in the Benelux countries and on Bejfgars Banquet in the rest of Kurope. In the U.S., the album is the third release in Matador's relationship with Capitol. The deal's previous projects, the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's \"Now I Got Worn,'\" and Pavement's \"Brighten The Cor- ners,\" have fared well so far. The Blues Explosion album is the trio's fastest- selling to date, and the Pavement record scored the band's hiiyrhest chart debut ever; No. 70 on The Billboard 200. (Although \"Brighten The Cor- ners\" has dipped more than 100 slots in the past four weeks.) Capitol VP of marketing Steve Rosenblatt (U.S.) says the campaign on behalf of \"Dust Bunnies\" will be a full- on rein trod ucti on of the band. \"With 'Lamprey.' I think there was an assumption that the popularity of the first album would automatically trans- late into even greater success for the second i-ecord,\" he says. \"With the new one, we'i-e taking nothing for granted.\" The labels plan to continue the sti'at- egy they've employed with Pavement and the Blues K>qilosion, and that is for Matador to lay the gi-ass-rootji ground- work before Capitol comes in with pro- motion at commercial radio and retail w'ebs. Says Matador co-president Chiis Lombardi, \"Our relationship with col- lege radio and indie retail is strong, so we want to build a stor\\' at that level that Capitol can then take to commer- cial radio.\" Early March saw the release of the subtle. mo\\ing \"C'o-('owai*d\" as the ini- tial single and \\ideo. with Matador pro- moting the song at college radio and commercial specialty shows. Capitol Ix'gins working the upl>eat meta-rock- er \"Kudder\" in May as the first focus track for commercial alternative and video for MTV. Already, the song has garnered some airplay via WXRK New York's Sunday-night new-music show. 'TheBu!'^.\" ' The first European single and video, \"What Friends?,\" came out in Febru- ary, with Brinkman and Beggars Ban- quet each issuing an EP for the song featuring the B sides \"Spine\" and \"Genuine Life Form.\" Matador has been using the import EP as a promo- tional item in the U.S. A band that can inspire a collector's ardor. Bettie Serveert has practically an entire album's worth of material in the fonn of B sides from various Mata- dor EPs and European-only singles issued by Brinkman and Beggars Ban- quet. Of tho.se, the .sterling \"Smile\" from the 4-track 'Tom Boy\" EP is of particular note, as is the live-on-the- BBC version of \"Crutches\" from the \"Something So Wild\" EP. In Novem- ber, Brinkman released a limited-edi- tion 7-inch single featuring \"Misery Galore\" backed with the otherwise unavailable \"All The Other Fish.\" Bettie Sen'eert has also contributed apt covei-s to compilations, including a take on Bob D\\ian's \"111 Keep It With Mine.\" which was a high point of last yeai-'s TAG/Atlantic soundtrack to \"I Shot Andy Warhol,\" and an affecting rendition of \"For All We Know,\" which went to the '94 Carpenters' tribute album on A&M, \"If I Were A Carpen- ter.\" According to Matador, a domes- tic commercial single may apiwar later in the year featuring a song from \"Dust Bunnies\" plus multiple B side^;. Unavailable for reorder since last April. \"Palomine\" and \"Lamprey\" were reissued Feb. 25 in the U.S. by Mata- dor via the label's independent distrib- utors (including ADA, Caraline. Cargo, Bayside, and Dutch East India). Thase albums have always done well at the Tower Records on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, according to manager Todd Meehan. With \"Dust Bunnies,\" he put the promo CD from Matador into the store's advance listening sta- tion a month ago to help build interest in the upcoming release. \"I think the new album is so strong, and our advance disc has gotten great res|X)iise,\" Meehan says. 'The new dis- tiibution deal should really help Mata- dor make the most of 'Dust Bunnies.' Capitol seems to know how to work alternative rock a bit better than At- lantic did. Toui\"s always help. too. and I know Bettie is really special live.\" Bettie Serveert played shows in the U.K. and the Netherlands in February, and the band supported the Lemon- heads on March dates in (Jermany. March 27, Bettie kicks off its month- long Euroi>ean tour at Amsterdam's Paradiso theater. The group comes to the U.S. in May for a national tour that will mix club gigs with slots supi»rting other acts. Bettie is booked in the U.S. by Twin Tower/ICM and in Europe by Double You. The band is managed in the U.S. by the Boston-based Tom Johnston Management and in Europe by Dorethy Krielen at Bettie Serveert Management, which is based in Vlietberg. the Netherlands.
