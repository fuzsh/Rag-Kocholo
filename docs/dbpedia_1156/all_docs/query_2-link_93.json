        "text": "Three-time Grammy winner and pop superstar Olivia Rodrigo is coming to Ohio. That's right, Livies, gather your red lipstick, fishnets and pent-up emotion. We're in for a night.\n\nRodrigo will perform at Nationwide Arena in Columbus on Friday, March 22. The show is part of her Guts world tour, which kicked off Feb. 23 in California and shares the name of her sophomore album.\n\nI plan to make the hike from Cincinnati to Columbus to see our girl perform. So ahead of the show, I gathered answers to questions I wondered myself, as well as some I noticed fans were searching on Google (Both nationally and locally. I want our friends going to other shows to have the answers they need).\n\nSo whether you have already secured the coveted tickets to the show or are still looking, here's everything you need to know before you spill your guts with Rodrigo.\n\nIs the Oliva Rodrigo concert sold out?\n\nTickets to the Olivia Rodrigo concert in Columbus on March 22 are sold out on Ticketmaster. Tickets are still available on resale sites, such as SeatGeek, Vivid Seats and StubHub, with the cheapest options falling around $300 to $400 before fees.\n\nAs for other American cities? Those are sold out, too. You can join a waitlist on the official tour website for when tickets become available. But check ticket resale sites for availability, as those may be your best bet.\n\nOlivia Rodrigo Guts tour setlist\n\nRodrigo's setlist contains all 12 songs from her \"Guts\" album, favorites from her debut album, \"Sour,\" and her song \"Obsessed,\" which is a deluxe track on \"Guts\" that hasn't yet been released on streaming.\n\n\"Bad Idea, Right?\"\n\n\"Ballad of a Homeschooled Girl.\"\n\n\"Vampire.\"\n\n\"Traitor.\"\n\n\"Drivers License.\"\n\n\"Teenage Dream.\"\n\n\"Pretty isnâ€™t Pretty.\"\n\n\"Love is Embarrassing.\"\n\n\"Making the Bed.\"\n\n\"Logical.\"\n\n\"Enough for You.\"\n\n\"Lacy.\"\n\n\"Jealousy, Jealousy.\"\n\n\"Happier.\"\n\n\"Favorite Crime.\"\n\n\"Deja Vu.\"\n\n\"The Grudge.\"\n\n\"Brutal.\"\n\n\"Obsessed.\"\n\n\"All-American Bitch.\"\n\n\"Good 4 U\" (encore).\n\n\"Get Him Back!\" (encore).\n\nWhat time does the Olivia Rodrigo concert start?\n\nRodrigo's concert at Nationwide Arena will start at 7:30 p.m. ET. Doors open at 6:30 p.m. ET. If you're attending Rodrigo's concert in a different city, check your tickets for the start time.\n\nWhat time does Olivia Rodrigo go on stage?\n\nAccording to Reddit, Rodrigo goes on stage at or around 8:30 p.m.\n\nA Reddit user commented the following schedule for the concert:\n\n7:30 pm: concert opener goes on stage.\n\n8:00 p.m.: opener finishes.\n\n8:30 p.m.: Rodrigo goes on stage.\n\n10:00 p.m.: Rodrigo finishes.\n\nHowever, a Reddit user who attended the Palm Springs concert said the opener performed for \"just under an hour,\" rather than only 30 minutes. This didn't affect Rodrigo's schedule, though. The user stated Rodrigo came on stage at 8:40 p.m.\n\nThis schedule isn't 100% confirmed but is a good guide for those wondering when they should be in their seats to see Olivia.\n\nHow long is the Olivia Rodrigo concert?\n\nThe entire concert lasts 2.5 hours, according to Reddit, ending at 10:00 p.m. The opener performs for roughly 30 minutes or so, and Rodrigo performs for 90 minutes.\n\nAgain, this time is according to other fans and is not 100% confirmed through official sources.\n\nWho is opening for Olivia Rodrigo's Guts tour?\n\nRodrigo announced four special guests will open for her during her Guts world tour. Chappell Roan will open for Rodrigo during the tour's first leg, which includes Columbus.\n\nPinkPantheress, an English singer-songwriter and record producer, will open for Rodrigo during the tour's European leg. Remi Wolf, an American singer and songwriter, will open for Rodrigo when she's back in the States during the summer. The Breeders, an alternative rock band, will open for Rodrigo in April at her New York City shows and in August at her Los Angeles shows.\n\nWho is Chappell Roan?\n\nChappell Roan is a 26-year-old American singer-songwriter known for pop hits that include \"Pink Pony Club\" and \"Red Wine Supernova.\" Roan is celebrated for her campy persona and was dubbed \"LA's queer pop superstar in the making\" by the Los Angeles Times.\n\nRoan worked with Dan Nigro, who regularly collaborates with Rodrigo, on her 2023 debut album \"The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess.\" The small-town Missouri native performed for a sold-out show at Cincinnati's Andrew J. Brady Music Center on March 10.\n\nChappell Roan setlist\n\nChappell Roan performed the following setlist Tuesday during the St. Louis stop on the Guts tour.\n\n\"Femininomenon.\"\n\n\"Naked in Manhattan.\"\n\n\"After Midnight.\"\n\n\"Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl.\"\n\n\"HOT TO GO!\"\n\n\"Casual.\"\n\n\"Red Wine Supernova.\"\n\n\"My Kink Is Karma.\"\n\n\"Pink Pony Club.\"\n\nOlivia Rodrigo merchandise\n\nThe merchandise sold at the Guts tour stops differs from what's available on Rodrigo's official website.\n\nA TikTok posted in February shows the merchandise available at the show and the items' prices, giving fans a good idea of what they can possibly expect when they're ready to buy merch. According to Elite Daily, this includes the following:\n\nHoodies: $80.\n\nCrewneck: $60.\n\nLong sleeve T-Shirt: $60\n\nButterfly tote bag: $50\n\nT-shirts: $45.\n\nTank: $45.\n\nCharm bracelet: $40.\n\nState charm: $10.\n\nHat: $40.\n\nBeanie: $40.\n\nTour poster: $20.\n\nLight up star: $15.\n\nBandaids: $15.\n\nFace gems: $10.\n\nSticker sheet: $10.\n\nA Reddit user who attended the Palm Springs concert claimed merchandise was available outside and inside the venue. Merchandise for the opener, Chappell Roan, was only available inside. Otherwise, all the merchandise should be the same inside and outside the venue.\n\nWhere to buy a Guts tour poster\n\nWant to get a poster to remember an iconic night for the rest of your life? There are at least five to choose from.\n\nThe TikTok above shows two posters likely available at your concert. One looks to be cream-colored with a sketch of Rodrigo's face inside a star. The other poster is purple and features Rodrigo leaning over a toilet with glitter and stars inside the toilet bowl.\n\nThree different posters are also available on Rodrigo's official site. These include the Guts Would Tour City-Specific Admat poster, Guts Olivia Rodrigo All-American B---- poster and the Bad Idea Right? poster.\n\nWhat to wear to an Olivia Rodrigo concert on her Guts tour\n\nDoc Martens. Fishnets. Butterfly hair clips. Converses. Sequin tops. Leather pants. Anything Purple. These are just some of the many items perfect for an Olivia Rodrigo concert.\n\nBut, if you need inspiration, search some variation of \"Olivia Rodrigo Guts tour outfits\" on Pinterest or TikTok.\n\nYou can always play it safe and rock something from Rodrigo's official merchandise collection or a unique piece of merchandise available on Etsy. (Look how cool these sunglasses are.)\n\nStill struggling to decide? You can take the \"Which Olivia Song R U???\" quiz to find out which song \"should inspire your Guts world tour style.\" The quiz picks out several pieces of merchandise for you based on your answers to the questions. (I got a Vampire, eep!)\n\nGuts tour locations\n\nThe following is a list of the American tour dates and locations on the Guts tour.\n\nFeb. 23: Palm Springs, California.\n\nFeb. 24: Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nFeb. 27: Houston, Texas.\n\nFeb. 28: Austin, Texas.\n\nMarch 1: Dallas, Texas.\n\nMarch 2: New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nMarch 5: Orlando, Florida.\n\nMarch 6: Miami, Florida.\n\nMarch 8: Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nMarch 9: Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nMarch 12: St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nMarch 13: Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nMarch 15: St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nMarch 16: Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nMarch 19-20: Chicago, Illinois.\n\nMarch 22: Columbus, Ohio.\n\nMarch 23: Detroit, Michigan.\n\nApril 1-2: Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nApril 5, 6, 8 and 9: New York, New York.\n\nJuly 19: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nJuly 20: Washington, D.C.\n\nJuly 23: Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nJuly 24: Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nJuly 26: Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nJuly 27: Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.\n\nJuly 30: Denver, Colorado.\n\nJuly 31: Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nAug. 2-3: San Francisco, California.\n\nAug. 6-7: Seattle, Washington.\n\nAug. 10:Portland, Oregon.\n\nAug. 13, 14, 16 and 17: Los Angeles, California."
