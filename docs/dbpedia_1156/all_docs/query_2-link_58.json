        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Giorgio Moroder’s living room proudly displays souvenirs from a career as a disco pioneer and pop hitmaker — a career that Mr. Moroder, who recently turned 75, is about to resume.\n\nIn his high-rise apartment in the Westwood neighborhood here, a white Yamaha baby grand (with digital recording built in) and a life-sized golden statue of Buddha flank glass doors to a terrace with a panoramic view. A few steps away is a subtly high-tech studio with a custom-built high-speed computer and digital keyboard where Mr. Moroder works on new songs. White-haired and mustachioed, wearing a loose white shirt with gray pants, Mr. Moroder greeted a visitor with a fist bump — not as a hip-hop pose, he explained, but to protect a broken finger. Jovial and avuncular as he discussed his songs, old and new, Mr. Moroder often described himself as lucky before mentioning the work he had put in.\n\nOn a glass table were two Oscars, two Golden Globes, a People’s Choice award and three Grammys, including the one he shared for his appearance on the 2013 Album of the Year, Daft Punk’s “Random Access Memories.” On the walls there are gold, platinum and multiplatinum albums — in the form of vinyl, CDs and even cassettes — for his writing and production on Donna Summer’s hits, the “Flashdance” soundtrack and “Take My Breath Away,” the ballad sung by Berlin for “Top Gun.”\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, Mr. Moroder had proved himself with disco standards, pop hits and soundtrack scores like “Midnight Express” and “Scarface.” But for much of the 1990s and 2000s, he all but retired from music, producing only a handful of songs. Lately, as the fondly remembered beats and atmosphere of disco have resurfaced in pop hits by Pharrell and Robin Thicke, Mr. Moroder has found a wave of younger admirers, along with record companies willing to bet that he’ll be profitable.\n\nOn June 16, Mr. Moroder is to release his first album under his own name in 30 years: “Déjà Vu” (RCA), featuring vocals from Sia, Britney Spears, Kylie Minogue, Charli XCX, Kelis, Mikky Ekko and others. “When a company offers you a budget to record an album, in today’s music life, it’s absolutely impossible to say no,” Mr. Moroder said.\n\n“Déjà Vu” is a dance-pop album from start to finish — a gleaming, effervescent, crafty blend of the disco that gave Mr. Moroder his first hits and the electronic dance music that has been extrapolating his ideas for decades. Behind the assorted voices and swelling trance-music chords, the irrepressible pulse that runs through the album is immediately recognizable as Mr. Moroder’s sound. So is the sense of melody and counterpoint, of string sections and rhythm guitars teasing the beat, of tension and release.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
