        "text": "Howard's Week In Vegas. 06/10/13. 6:00am\n\nShow opening bits and songs included: A Jason Kaplan marijuana public service announcement bit, The Fab Faux performing ''I Am The Walrus'' live in the Howard Stern Show studio.\n\nHoward started the show talking about how no one has ever added up the number of shows they've done. Robin said they do that with TV shows all the time. She said they've done this like 50 billion times.\n\nRobin said it's good to see Howard. Howard said he had a relaxing week off. He said he was out videotaping the Vegas auditions for AGT. He said it was Vegas Week. Robin said she realized it was Vegas week while watching AGT. Howard said it's like a 15-16 hour day. He said they tell him it's just 30 days of work but then they pull this. He said he was going to call about the child labor laws. He said sometimes they do nothing.\n\nHoward said he was in a room that was really cold and they forget about you for a couple of hours. He said he had a tantrum over it. Howard said they have 3 different departments that run the show and it's not that easy to put together. He said during the taping they have three departments. He said they have a reality show team that shoots him from way too low. He said they have a publicity team that books him for publicity. He said he showed up on time on Monday and did that and then he sat around for 6 hours doing nothing. He said his air conditioning was so loud he couldn't do anything. He said the different departments don't talk to each other. He said he was out there to work but he had to wait around. He said Howie told him there is a ton of waiting around but he was waiting around to do nothing. Howard said on Tuesday they watched the performances and that got interesting.\n\nRonnie's Batman Moustache Shave. 06/10/13. 6:05am\n\nHoward said Ronnie the Limo Driver is getting his beard shaved into the Batman logo. He said that should be ready now. Howard had Ronnie come in. They had a guy named Mike the Barber there to shave him. Howard said he had to talk to Ronnie about this. Ronnie didn't sound happy about it. Howard asked how long the moustache will last like that. Mike said it should be good for a week. Howard said he looks 50 times better than with that shitty moustache he has. Mike said he think it's better but the other moustache wasn't that bad. Howard said he looks really good with that moustache.\n\nHoward said this looks cool. Ronnie said this is dark brown and not black. Robin said it looks great. Ronnie said he hasn't seen it yet. Howard had the Howard TV guys put it up on the screen. Howard said his other moustache took up too much real estate on his face. Fred said it looks good. He said he should go with the full black.\n\nHoward said Mike gave him the Batman logo on his face. He works in the Bronx. Howard said his prices are reasonable. He charges 20 bucks to do that. Robin said he's a walking piece of art.\n\nHoward said Mike once had a guy ask for a Swastika on his face but he turned it down. Howard said that would be like supporting a guy who wants to annihilate him. Howard thought he was black but Mike said he's Dominican. Ronnie said he didn't think that at all. He said he knew he wasn't black. Robin didn't think so either. Howard said he's like a black Hispanic guy. Robin said his hair is straight. Howard said whatever he is wouldn't go with the Nazi thing. Robin asked what would go with that. Howard said you'd need a white, Swedish guy to shave that into your head.\n\nHoward read that Mike had done a graffiti thing for a guy that he shaved into his head. Mike said he wanted all kids of stuff shaved into his head. He said the guy was only 10 years old.\n\nHoward read that the most requested thing to have carved into your head is the NY Yankees logo. Howard said Mike is 35 years old. He read about the girl he's dating. Howard asked if he could carve the first chapter of his book Private Parts into his head. Mike didn't sound like he was ready for that.\n\nHoward said mike did a great job with the shave. He said he was going to be really mean and have Mike shave a cock and balls into his beard. Howard said he couldn't be that mean though. Howard said that Lisa G is really into this. Ronnie said she wanted to give him a good luck kiss before he had it done. Howard said she went out and bought a Yosemite Sam blow up doll this weekend. Howard said she spent the weekend pulling moustache hairs out of her throat. He said she wasn't able to get the smell of Mambo off of her either.\n\nHoward said he and Ronnie were out in Vegas and Ronnie got all fucked up. He said it's so dry out there. He said it was 106 degrees out there. He said it's so hot. He said they were going to sit outside but he lasted about 30 seconds out there. Howard said they were out in the desert and man isn't supposed to live in the desert. He said he was so covered up out there too. Howard said he went out to the pool the one day he had with free time. Howard said Dina Meyer was out there. Howard said he was out in the sun for about 5 minutes. Ronnie said that Joe was coughing up blood because it's so dry out there. Howard said he felt like he had boogers in his nose but it wouldn't come out. Ronnie said that's the dust.\n\nHoward said you drink so much water that you have to get up and pee like 7 times a night. Howard said Ronnie called it squirting and not peeing. Howard told Mike about the squirting thing so Ronnie asked if his girlfriend does that. Mike said she does. Howard asked if it's pee. Mike said it's not.\n\nHoward said Ronnie looks great with that Batman logo. Will said he looks like less of an asshole than normal. Howard said he's a little jealous. He said he doesn't have a thick beard like that. Howard thanked Mike for the job. Howard had him give a plug for himself. Mike said he works at The Sharp Style at 1139 Teller Ave in the Bronx. He wrapped up and let mike go after that. They were going to put the pictures up on HowardStern.com\n\nHoward said Ronnie is all about the sex talk since he brought up that squirting thing. Howard said he had an interview he did with Jon Leiberman where he answers some questions about sex. Howard said it's more vile than ever. Howard played the clip where Ronnie was talking about his favorite sex positions and things like that. He was talking about how you can get in deep when you do missionary position. Ronnie was also talking about how he wants to have a clear box at Rick's Cabaret so he can look up at the girls from below.\n\nPhone Calls And More AGT Discussions. 06/10/13. 6:25am\n\nHoward took a call from a guy who said Howard seems like the only one who gives a shit about getting people through on AGT. He said the others seem like they're just about the publicity. Howard said he's not sure how he got that out of that. He said he doesn't spend much time thinking about the other judges. Howard said it's like the other three and then him. Robin said that one of the judges keeps saying she can't wait to see what the person does next.\n\nHoward said the other three have bonded and they do everything together. He said they go to dinner, lunch and to each other's homes. He said they go out drinking until 1 in the morning and things like that. He said it's like an on set romance. Howard said he sits there by himself. He said that the other three do their thing and then he does his. Howard said he considers himself way more professional. He said he doesn't do the social media thing like they do. Howard said they have a social media person there at AGT and the guy came up to him and said that he wasn't tweeting. Howard said he thought he was being professional but now it seems like he's not participating. He said he doesn't want to tweet. Robin said all of these live shows want to have that going on.\n\nHoward said one night they were filming and they were in a judges deliberation and they were working on getting 160 acts down to 50. He said there are people who he thinks should get the chance to go further. Howard said they were sent into a bedroom to get their make up redone. Howard said they must have all been looking really bad. Howard said he was exhausted so he said ''I'm so god damn exhausted.'' Then Heidi suggested that they get in bed and act like their sleeping to take a photo for social media. Howard said she wanted to do it for her Twitter. Howard said he told her he's not doing anything for Twitter. Howard said he just wanted to go downstairs and finish. Heidi then came over with a curling iron and took pictures. He said one was worse than the next. Howard said he had this girl shoot from up above so it didn't look so bad. He said he hates doing that stuff though. He said he'd doing America's Got Talent and not Twitter. Robin said they should make it so you can only get this stuff on AGT and not on Twitter.\n\nHoward said he's not comfortable with people. Robin said he hates small talk. Howard said he doesn't want to hear people's opinions. Robin said she knows Howard was sick of hearing Howie's opinion during that one act on AGT last week. Howard said it was so stupid. He said Howie was being Howie. He said he was going on for like an hour during that hot pepper act. Howard said he can't think that was a million dollar act. Robin said everyone had said no and Howie was arguing. Howard said those go on for hours. He said that's when he gets annoyed. Howard said he takes the judging very seriously.\n\nVentura - Stern 2016? 06/10/13. 6:35am\n\nHoward took a call from a guy who said that Jesse Ventura has been talking about running with him in 2016 for President. Howard said that has been heating up lately. Howard had some audio of some of the news reports that have been running about that. Howard played one where they were talking about Ventura's run and how he's asked Howard Stern to run with him. Howard said Jesse is treating him seriously and he loves that. Howard said 2016 is the opportune time to run. He said that they don't have anyone popping up and running yet.\n\nHoward said the IRS did a shitty thing when they went after the Tea Party. Howard said that they're all crying about it now. Howard said this has happened to him before. He said the government went after him with the FCC when he was on terrestrial. Then they held up the merger with Sirius and XM. Howard said they delayed licensing for Infinity Broadcasting until they paid a fee to the FCC. Howard said that's not right. Howard said not one of these conservative or even the liberals came forward and said anything.\n\nHoward said he has a clip of a woman laughing at his candidacy. Howard played that one and the reporter started laughing when another reporter read the story. Howard goofed on those two reporters who were in Orlando. Howard goofed on the fake voices they put on for the news and talked about how fucking retarded the woman is for not knowing who Jesse Ventura was. Howard said they're dummies. He said he loves that she's laughing at his candidacy. Howard did his impression of the guy and his phony news voice delivery.\n\nHoward took a call from a guy who said that Howard should tell Jesse that he's never going to disclose his finances or expose his children to that run. Howard said he has told Jesse that it's a long shot. He said it sounds exciting to run and it would kill him to say no. He said that he'd love to go around campaigning and doing the debates. Howard said he thinks that the two of them could get enough action to get on the ballots. Howard said he thinks they could get enough support to do that. Robin said that Howard is complaining about the work he has to do with AGT. The campaigning would be worse. Howard said he could do it on Skype from his house.\n\nHoward said he's having too much fun with this right now so he's not telling Jesse yet. The caller said it would be great if he had Ronnie with this Batman goatee with him. Howard said the more he sees it the more he likes it. He said he looks 10 times better with that thing. Howard said the other moustache made him look old and tired. Howard said his face is perfect for it. Howard said Ronnie looks more handsome with that logo.\n\nHoward said it's funny with Ronnie. He said they went out on the street and asked people about the Ronnie and Lisa G kiss. Howard said people were disgusted by Ronnie thinking he was with a young, hot chick. Howard played some of those interviews. People were saying it was all about money for the chick and she could find someone better. Howard said little did they know that she's the one who sits home and Ronnie is the one acting like a lunatic. One guy said that he looks old and like he can't get it up. One guy said that the chick didn't look like she had tits to play with either. Howard said the Batman logo makes Ronnie look about 10 years younger.\n\nHoward said that Seth Rogen is coming in today. He said he saw his movie ''This is the End.'' He said Wendy Williams is coming in too. Howard said her show is kicking ass. He said he's not sure how she's doing that and everything else she's doing.\n\nHoward Takes More Calls. 06/10/13. 6:45am\n\nHoward took a call from Bobo who said he was thrilled to be used in the intro for AGT. He said that the guy with the snake was insane. Howard said that they're going to all of the cities and not going to just one city at a time. He said that they're mixing it up and showing the good talent. He said the show is very fast paced this season. Bobo asked how that Special Head guy did that trick. Howard said he has no idea. Robin said that was great. He said that he won't say what happened with him in Vegas but they have a lot of great stuff coming up.\n\nBobo asked about a picture that Ralph took with Beth on the plane. Howard said he took that for Twitter. He said he's trying to Tweet but he doesn't think that much about it.\n\nHoward took a call from a woman who said that she watched AGT and she thinks that he's a multi-generational star. Howard said that these people who are watching him now don't know that he put out Butt Bongo Fiesta years ago.\n\nHoward took a call from Jeff the Drunk who started singing the ''B double o T Y'' song that was on AGT last week. Robin said he had a great stage presence. Robin said the song sucked though. Howard said it gets stuck in your head though.\n\nJeff asked if they're having Willie Nelson in. Howard said he doesn't know. He asked Gary. Howard said he doesn't think he's on the schedule. Jeff said he's going to see him on Thursday. Jeff asked when he's coming in again. Howard said he doesn't know. Howard and Fred were goofing on Jeff because of the way he said ''Hunter Mountain'' when he mentioned where he was going to see Willie. They did that for a minute before moving on.\n\nHoward took a call from a guy who said that the country act on AGT was spectacular. He said that Howard was looking at the guy like he really loved him too. He asked what was going through his head. Howard said he thought he was going to suck but he was like that Susan Boyle chick. He said that he was able to sing and he turned an audience on. Howard said this is why that show is successful. He said that he's the kind of act they look for. Howard said the guy is so in love with his wife that he can become a super star and leave his wife. Howard said the guy had a beautiful story and he actually had talent. Howard said it was an incredible story. Howard let the caller go and said he had to take a break.\n\nPlease visit Amazon.com for all of your shopping needs.\n\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n\nWendy Williams Visits. 06/10/13. 7:00am\n\nAfter the break we heard a Jack and Rod Show bit where Sal and Richard spoke to an author about her book using clips of Seth Rogen and Maria Menounos. We also heard Ben Stern singing ''You'll Never Walk Alone.''\n\nHoward came back and said he feels like he's at the Tony Awards. He said he'll play some clips later on. He said Wendy Williams is there. He said she has a talk show and a new book out. He said her show is doing really well and it's up 43 percent in the ratings. Howard said she walked in there with a special walk. He asked if she puts that on. Wendy said she doesn't.\n\nHoward asked Wendy about losing weight and how she did that. Howard said that her success is coming later in life. Wendy said she's glad it did. She said it works for her that way. She said the success is good and she's not over spending or over friending either. She said that she hunkers down and doesn't go crazy. She said that's because she knows who she is.\n\nWendy said that her show was renewed until 2017. Howard asked if her contract ran out. Wendy didn't want to say. Howard said her show is in syndication and she has a big audience. She's mostly on FOX network. Howard asked why she's not getting Oprah money. Wendy said she's not Oprah. Howard said she should be getting good money. Wendy said she's getting good money. She said that she's in her fourth season of the show and it's taken her that long to get her wig line going. She said she's not starving and she's not homeless.\n\nHoward said that they wanted to sign her up for 3 more years so she must be in the driver's seat. Wendy said she kind of is. Howard said that when you're in syndication you own your own program. He said he's wondering what she's earning. Wendy said she's doing just fine. Howard asked if she has a nice house. She said she lives a luxurious life. She said that the years of ''Negroidian'' expenditures are over. She said she's not doing the cars and bling any more. She said she's frugal and watches her money.\n\nHoward asked why she needs a wig line. Wendy just laughed. Howard asked why she thinks she needs that. Wendy said that she wears wigs because she has thin hair from her thyroid disease. She said that it's time to get in bed with a company and get this thing going. Howard asked what he would see if she took her wig off. Robin thought she wasn't wearing a wig on Dancing with the Stars. Wendy said that was a wig. Robin sounded shocked. Howard said that she must want to feel the water in her hair when she goes swimming. Wendy said she can feel it with the wig on. Howard asked if she wears the wig at home. Wendy said she takes it off as soon as she gets home. Howard asked if her husband acts shocked when she does that. She said that he doesn't. She said that she has a relatively attractive face. She said her hair just isn't that great. Howard asked her to take the wig off for him. Wendy said she's not going to do that. Wendy said she puts her hair into a bun thing under the wig. She said that she has a rule where she takes the wig off for her son's friends after the third time they visit.\n\nHoward said he thinks that her show is good because she's by herself. He said she doesn't need other people on with her. Wendy said she thinks that she has an advantage doing things the way she does. She said that they have moved the studio and changed things around. She said that they do 20 minutes of hot topics now. Howard said that's what he likes about her show.\n\nHoward asked Wendy why she said that Beyonce speaks like she's in 5th grade. Wendy said that she could stand an elocution lesson or ten. Wendy said she's so talented and she should act like it. Wendy said it would be nice if she could speak a little better. Howard said she's saying that she's a complete fucking mess. Wendy said that's not what she's saying. She told Howard to watch it.\n\nHoward said that Wendy mentioned that Jessica Biel's marriage won't last because she's boring. Wendy said that she just gets that from what she's seen. She said she's not sure that she is boring but that's the feeling she gets. She said that she doesn't know how long the marriage will last but maybe after the first child is born.\n\nHoward said that Wendy also says that Kanye West is going to abandon Kim Kardashian 30 seconds after the baby is born. Wendy said when she came back in September she didn't want to take 3 months off again. She said she has to talk about this stuff. Wendy said she loves doing what she's doing right now. Howard said she could have taken the summer off but she's working this year. Wendy said she has a life outside of the show but not everyone gets to have their own talk show. She said that she loves doing it and she didn't want to have 3 months off. She said she has her down time and she loves that. Howard said he thinks that she enjoys working and she's not one of those people who worries about ratings and what other people think. Howard said if they don't love it then so be it.\n\nHoward said he can't deal with things like Wendy can. He said that he's worried about ratings and things like that. Wendy said that ratings are very important but she can't hear about it. She said she can't think about things too much because she's afraid she'll lose it. Wendy said that some of the best shows ever have been canceled. She said it's very frustrating.\n\nHoward said Wendy is almost 49 now. She said she'll be 49 in July. She said she feels 18. She said she has a very happy life. Howard asked if she's still with her husband/Manager. She said he's there with her today. She said they've been married for 15 years and he's been in her life for 19 years. Howard said he cheated on her while she was pregnant. Howard asked if he asks her to drop that and leave it alone already. Wendy said in her book (Ask Wendy) she is asked questions and she talks about that. She said that she draws on her own experiences. She said that she is the wife that stays and everyone's situation is different. Howard asked if she brings up the cheating thing when they fight. Wendy said that's not what you do. She said that she leaves it alone. She said that it's not something you keep bringing up.\n\nHoward said that Wendy's parents used to monitor what she ate when she was growing up. Her brother was allowed to eat anything. Howard asked if she was angry with them. Wendy said that she was. She said that she still gets angry thinking about it but she has forgiven them. She said she's on good terms with her parents. She said she didn't hate them but she didn't give a damn what they had to say about her body. She said she still doesn't care about what they think.\n\nWendy said that her parents are retired and she gave them a new life. She said that this has given them a cue to go out. She said that her mother is all about Wendy Williams being her daughter. Wendy said she's glad that they lived long enough to see her swan song.\n\nHoward asked if Wendy's mom is upset with her husband for cheating on her. Wendy said she's not about that. She said she never was. Howard said that they have to be fair to the husband because she took him off sex completely. Wendy said that she had a problem with her cervix so they had her on bed rest. She said that she had two miscarriages at 5 months and that was tough on both of them. Wendy said that her husband got horny and went out and met a chick. Howard asked if she knows who she was. Wendy said she wouldn't know her to see her but she was all in the business. Wendy said that you have to have that discussion and face it.\n\nHoward said that Wendy had a marriage that lasted just 5 months. Wendy said that she didn't have the balls back then to say anything. She said that it should have lasted less than 5 months. Wendy said he just wasn't her cup of tea. She said that she didn't have kids or buy any homes with him. Howard said that happens in life. He said you do it to make people happy instead of doing it for yourself. Howard asked Wendy when she got laid for the first time. She said she was 17.\n\nHoward said that Wendy and Lisa Lampanelli have something going on between them. Howard said that Lisa tweeted out something about Lena Dunham being her ''nigga'' and Wendy got upset with Lisa for using that word. Howard said that Lisa took it pretty hard when she got slammed. Wendy said that she and Lisa have always gotten along. She said just because she's a friend doesn't mean that she won't call you to the carpet. Wendy said that she's going to stick to what she said. Wendy said that she doesn't particularly care about the word being thrown around but when a white woman does it to another white woman then she gets upset. She said if Lisa is upset about it then ''Oh well.'' Howard said Lisa was telling him that Wendy brought it up the next day on her show too. Howard said that he had audio of what Lisa said on his show recently. Lisa was talking about how hurt she was about the whole thing. Lisa was saying that Wendy brought it up the next day. Lisa was upset that she was saying that she shouldn't be surprised if someone slaps her face using that word again.\n\nWendy said she has no problem with Lisa other than that one thing. She said that white people can't just throw that word around. She said that with her it's one thing but someone may slap her in the face if she uses it one too many times. Howard asked if a Dominican can use that word. Wendy said she would prefer that no one uses it.\n\nHoward said that Wendy had a problem with Adam Carolla too. Howard asked her how Adam disrespected her audience. Wendy said she can't recall the exact circumstance. Wendy was distracted by the bust of Beetlejuice they have in the studio. Howard said he used to sell those things. Wendy got back to Adam and said there was a misunderstanding and she ended up apologizing to him over the whole thing.\n\nHoward gave Wendy a plug for her book ''Ask Wendy'' and for her web site WendyShow.com. Howard said she's doing a play this summer too. Wendy said she's doing Chicago. She said she'll be singing two songs in the play. She said that she didn't even have to audition. She said that she's playing a role that has been played by a lot of different people. She said that Sofia Vergara and Queen Latifa have played the role. Wendy said that the part is going to last 7 weeks.\n\nHoward asked Wendy about something she said in her book about not caring about a man's money as long as his penis is right. Wendy said that it's not about size, it's about the turtle neck. She said that she had an experience many years ago when she was in college and she said she would never visit that again. Howard asked if it was about the smegma. She said it was that and the whole thing. Howard asked how it went down and if she was blowing him at the time. Wendy said it was the works. She said it looked like a Snuffalufagus to her. She said she didn't want to get into detail. She said it was just disgusting. Wendy said if you don't like what you feel or see from the start then don't continue. Howard asked why she went through with it back then. Wendy said she was young and didn't know any better. Wendy said that she had one woman in her book asking about her husband's too-small penis and she asked why she ever went out with the guy on a second date.\n\nHoward said that Wendy got an exclusive interview with Charlie Sheen. Wendy said she was a big fan of his and her management company works with Charlie. She said that's how they got together and he's been back a couple of times. She said that he's handling his business as far as she can tell.\n\nHoward said that Wendy took Joan Rivers side in the feud she had with Chelsea Handler. Wendy said she is a big fan of Joan's. She said she has a photo with Oprah in her house that she took many years ago. She said that she has one of her with Howard too. Wendy said that there are two people she has respect for and one of them is Howard. Wendy said that you don't have to kiss anyone's ass but with Joan she took her side. She said that she had to do that. Wendy said that Joan just turned 80.\n\nWendy told Howard that his teeth look good and he's great on AGT. Robin said she noticed that on TV the other night too. Wendy said he looks really good. She asked if he gets Botox. Howard told her that his hair is all natural too. Wendy said she knows that. Howard said he doesn't have any extensions either.\n\nWendy asked how much longer Howard is going to work. Howard said he's not sure. He said he keeps talking about stopping. He said he's never bored though so he doesn't know why he wouldn't stop.\n\nWendy asked if Howard is still taking pictures. Howard said he is. He said he'd like to photograph her without a wig on. Howard said he doesn't think she'd like his penis size if he was with her. Wendy said she's not about the size. She said she knows that he's not that big being Jewish and all. Howard said that he isn't thick or long. She said as long as he doesn't have that turtle neck she's fine.\n\nHoward took a call from King of All Blacks who said that he likes Wendy. He said he freeze frames her and jerks off to her. Wendy gave that an ''Eww.'' King said that her husband is a real man. He said that he'll tell her to shut the fuck up and things like that. Howard asked if that's true. Wendy said that is true to a point. She said that he makes her feel like a woman.\n\nHoward gave Wendy some more plugs and asked her about doing drugs. Wendy said she used to do coke. She said that she has smoked crack too. She said that she was spending about $35 a gram back when she was doing it.\n\nHoward took a call from a guy who said that this N-word thing is thrown around a lot. He said he wouldn't use it himself but Lisa was ding it to be funny. Wendy said that she didn't like the context it was used in. She said she's sticking with what she said about her. Howard wrapped up with her a short time later. They went to break after that.\n\nSeth Rogen Visits. 06/10/13. 8:05am\n\nAfter the break we heard a prank call Sal and Richard made to a show where they made their call sound so bad it was almost impossible to hear them. Fred also played Train's cover of Led Zeppelin's ''Ramble On'' as they were coming back.\n\nHoward came back and said that Seth Rogen is there to promote his new movie ''This is the End.'' Howard said the movie is a really original idea. Howard said that it's a fun movie. Howard said Seth plays himself in the movie and he gets high all the time in the movie just like the real Seth. Howard said that he saw a clip of him rolling a cross joint. Howard said that you'd think Sony would tell them to cut back on something like that. Seth said they made a clip of how to do that and Sony wouldn't put it out so he had to create a Facebook page himself to get it out there. Seth said that's just a gimmick kind of thing but he's really good at making one.\n\nHoward said Seth smokes a lot and he'd bet that he's high now. Seth said he is a little bit. Howard said he did Letterman and didn't smoke for that interview. Seth said that Dave asked him a lot of weed questions and he got really deep into it with him.\n\nHoward said Seth has had a big career and he still talks about smoking weed. He said that they tell him not to talk about it that much but he keeps doing it. Howard said that he finds it refreshing that he's able to talk openly about it and keep doing it. He said that's one taboo in Hollywood.\n\nSeth said that he thinks that they blame weed smoking on getting into harder drugs but he thinks that people who are going to do heroin are going to do it no matter what.\n\nHoward talked to Seth about what Michel Douglas said about getting throat cancer. Howard said that most women who have this HPV thing will get pussy cancer too. He said that he believes Michael Douglas. He asked Seth if he can write a movie with him. Howard said he thinks that you can get throat cancer that way. Robin said you certainly can but Douglas was the first one to say it. Seth said he took one for the team.\n\nHoward asked if Seth saw the Liberace movie. Seth said he's halfway through it. Howard said he hates it. He said that his mother didn't like it either. Howard said that he felt it was a hatchet job on Liberace. Robin said it was Boober's side of the story. Howard said he painted him to be an awful person and he comes across looking like a vampire. Howard said that the acting performances were great but the movie was shit. Robin said that the one thing you can hang your hat on is to look at Scott Thorson and see that he looks like Liberace today. Howard said the movie didn't make much sense and you don't learn anything. Seth and Howard said there was no back story there. They didn't get into why they wanted him to look like Liberace.\n\nHoward said Seth did that movie with Barbara Streisand. He said that he read that he got super close to her. Seth said they were in a car together for like 12 hours a day for months and moths. He said she has great stories. He said that she told him about smoking weed with Peter Sellers. Seth said that he would ask her if she had met famous people that he would think of.\n\nHoward said he read that Barbara's son got jealous of Seth because he was hanging out with her so much. He read that in the National Enquirer. Howard read that she didn't want to shoot more than 45 minutes from her Malibu home. Seth said that is true. He confirmed that she didn't want to get to work earlier than 8:30 in the morning. Howard said Seth shot this new movie in New Orleans. Seth said they digitally added stuff from Hollywood in the movie because it was so much cheaper to shoot in New Orleans. Seth said they can make a $45 million movie down there for like $31 million. Howard wondered why they don't offer that tax break in California. Seth said they must be assholes.\n\nHoward said that Seth directed the movie and they did it like improv so that must take a long time. Seth said it wasn't that long. He said the stunt stuff takes a long time to shoot. Howard said the movie is sort of like a comedy stoner movie but then it breaks into a big budget action film. Howard asked how he knew how to do all of that stuff. Seth said you don't have to know how to do it but you have to plan it all out. He said you have to story board it and then do the visual effects. He said it takes a long time.\n\nHoward asked Seth if they wrote everything or just left the page blank. Seth said they had to write every scene just in case they weren't able to come up with anything funny that day. He said they had to do that for Sony.\n\nHoward asked if they wrote lines for Rihanna. Seth said that they did write some stuff for her. He said that they got pretty much everyone they wanted to come in too. Gary said he heard they wanted Harry Potter but he wasn't up for it. Seth said they did meet with Daniel Radcliff and they wrote a part for him. He said that they wanted him to play the part of a soccer player who liked to head butt people all the time.\n\nHoward said they had a lot of shit jokes in the movie but they cut them out. Seth said sometimes it can be too much. He said that they will go with pee jokes. Howard said that Seth drinks his own pee at one point in the movie and it's crazy. Howard said one of the guys was drinking his own piss out of a bottle and Seth ended up just pissing into his mouth. Seth said that wasn't improv'd. He said that they used a squeeze ketchup bottle to make it look like he was pissing.\n\nHoward asked Seth if there's a lot of pressure making the movie. Seth said making it is a lot of fun. He said as long as you're on schedule it's fun. He said the stuff before and after making it is the bullshit.\n\nHoward asked Seth what's up with Jonah Hill. He was supposed to be there today but he put out a statement saying that he's a serious actor and he's not going to make fun of himself anymore. Seth said he thinks they caught him on a bad day. He said that he just did promotion the other day together. Seth said that Jonah warned him that he was going to read some strange things he said. Seth said Jonah is out in Los Angeles doing promotion for the film.\n\nHoward asked Seth about James Franco and how he's in love with him in the movie. Seth said that was James' idea and he even painted the paintings that they had in his house in the movie. He said that it played out similar to the way the whole idea came about before the movie.\n\nHoward asked Seth if he smokes when he's writing his movies. Seth said they do. Howard said he's not good at rolling joints but Seth does this Cross Joint thing. Seth said he was stoned off his face when he made the video they put out. Howard asked if he wants to smoke more pot when they tell him not to put this stuff out. Seth said they don't care there at Sony. He said they have never called and told him to stop. He said they did get kicked off the Sony lot for smoking pot though. He said they were editing the movie. He said they were below Will Smith's office and they had to leave. He said they got a call from human resources telling them they had to go. He said that they're not sure that Will called them but someone from his office probably did.\n\nHoward asked if he was high when he was filming. Seth said it's hard to direct when you're high so he would stop.\n\nHoward asked Seth about this next movie he's filming. Seth told Howard about what they're doing with Ryan Seacrest and James Franco. He said they get an interview with Kim Jong Un and they are asked by the CIA to assassinate him during the interview. He said that this was done before the whole Dennis Rodman thing came about.\n\nHoward said that Seth was critical of Zach Braff of going on Kickstarter to raise money. Seth said Howard was too. Seth said Zach could have raised that 2 million without going to Kickstarter. He said if you've exercised every option then it's understandable but he doesn't think that he did. Howard said some people would say that Seth is above that because he's gotten money to do these films. Seth said it was very hard to get the funding for ''This is the End.'' He said Sony was the only company that would do it. Howard said he must hope that it makes a lot of money for them. Seth said that's what Pineapple Express did.\n\nSeth said that if Sony hadn't picked up the movie then maybe they would have done the crowd sourcing thing. Howard said Zach is trying to do this movie thing now. Seth said that he's not sure how he's going to get the movie out there after it's made. He said that just because they make it doesn't mean it will come out. Howard said he saw Zach on Saturday night and he's actually shooting this thing. Seth said that still doesn't mean he'll ever see it.\n\nRobin said Cheech and Chong movies made money. Seth said they didn't make that much though. Robin said they probably didn't cost much to make though. Seth said she's probably right about that.\n\nHoward said he didn't know that he co-wrote the movie ''The Watch.'' Seth said that he didn't either. Howard said he saw this tape on the internet where Seth was doing stand up comedy. He said he was 13 years old. Howard said he's a bit of a phenom. Seth said he was but now he's just a guy. Howard asked Seth how many movies he's been responsible for. Seth said it's probably 8 or so. He said it's pretty awesome. Howard said he's right up there with the guys getting shit done. Howard said he's getting wasted every morning too.\n\nHoward asked how much weed he smoked this morning. Seth said he had like one hit. He said he wanted to be relaxed and loose for Howard. Howard said he wishes he could smoke with him. He said he gets too paranoid though. Seth said it might be the wrong weed he's smoking. Howard asked what he would suggest for him. Seth suggested a heavy cush for him. Howard said he loves that comradery and he'd love to be able to do it. He asked Seth if he does both types. Seth said he does.\n\nHoward asked Seth about the movie Townies and how Seth said that he couldn't believe that he was the same species as Zac Efron. Seth said that he's like a freak of nature. Howard said he likes that Seth doesn't care about wearing make up or anything in this new movie. He said that he doesn't put a lot of effort into his look and that's what's charming about him. Seth said that he tried that when he shot The Green Hornet. Howard said he has put on a good 30 pounds since then. Seth said that he likes to eat. He said Zac wasn't able to eat. He said that he probably shits like once a week or something. Seth said he shits like 6 times a day himself.\n\nHoward asked Seth about what shit scenes they cut from the movie. Seth said that they shot a scene where he was eating shit and the whole crew was disgusted by it. He said that they all figured no one wanted to see that. Howard said he saw that chick eating shit in Pink Flamingos. He said that he saw that when he was in college and he was freaked out by it.\n\nHoward said that Emma Watson is a good looking girl. He said she grew up hot. Seth said that you could tell that she was going to be hot even in the first Harry Potter movie. Howard asked if Franco banged her at all. Seth said he didn't see that on the set.\n\nHoward said that Jonah gets raped by a demon at one point in the movie. Howard said he gets anal. Seth said they had him get fucked missionary style. Howard said he thinks that a lot of people will be high when they see this movie. Howard asked if they hope that kids sneak in to see the movie. Seth said you can see an R-rated movie pretty easy. He said you can buy your tickets online and get in. He said they won't check your ID at the movie theater.\n\nHoward said he used to get carded at the movie theaters as a kid. He said that he would try to sneak in but he'd get carded while his other friends would get in. Howard said he had to hear about the movie later and jerk off to the story they would tell him.\n\nHoward asked Seth about what movie they're up against this weekend. Seth said they're up against the Man of Steel. Seth said that they can still do well against a movie like that. Seth said that not everyone will go see the Superman movie. Seth said there hasn't been a good R-rated movie out in a while. Howard said he's glad this is rated R. He asked if they almost got the X rating. Seth said they didn't. He said you can see the monster's dick when Jonah is getting raped and they were worried that the MPAA wouldn't like that. He said they read about how Team America made their sex scenes really dirty so they could cut back on it a little bit. Seth said they were adding texture and veins to the penis and the MPAA approved it anyway. He said that it was a monster dick so that's what their excuse was.\n\nHoward took a call from a guy who said that he called in earlier about the N-word when Wendy was in. He asked Seth what he thinks about the use of the word. Seth said if it's funny it's okay. He said that anything is okay if it's funny.\n\nHoward asked Seth if he has used the N-word on stage. Seth said he hasn't thought of a joke that he could use that in. Howard asked if he misses doing stand up. Seth said he hasn't done it in like 5 years and he does miss it. Howard said that most stand ups want to get into film. Seth is there.\n\nJeff the Drunk called in and asked how old he was when he started smoking. Howard told Seth this is what he's going to sound like in 10 years. Jeff asked again how old he was when he started. Seth said he was probably 13. Jeff said that's when he started. He's 47 now. Howard said he looks like he's 67. They put up a picture of him for Seth to see. Seth said Jeff looks nice.\n\nHoward asked Seth if he can smoke around his parents. Seth said that's the one thing he can't do. He said he can smoke around them but not in front of them. Howard asked if they lecture him about smoking. Seth said his dad brought it up a while back and asked if he had to talk about it all the time. Seth said that people ask him about it so that's why he talks about it.\n\nHoward and Seth talked about doing late night shows and how much Howard likes Jimmy Kimmel. Howard said he'd like to do his show but he's out in Los Angeles. Howard said he hangs out with Jimmy a lot. Howard said that he has a treadmill desk and he walks while he writes. Howard said he's no fun to eat with anymore. He said he's like Zac Efron the way he eats.\n\nHoward asked Seth if he ever smokes 5 or 6 joints in a day. Seth said if he's having a big day he would. Howard said he should eat brownies with pot in them. Seth said those things can really fuck you up. He said that you don't know how strong it is when it's in food. He said he's had some bad experiences that way. Seth said that he had a weed lollipop at he Golden Globes a few years ago and it fucked him up. Howard said he used to do hash oil and that would fuck him up. Seth said he had to leave the Golden Globes because he was so fucked up.\n\nHoward said he has a million questions but they're running late. Seth said he didn't have to be anywhere until 10. Howard said he didn't want to hold him up too long. Howard told Seth not to use the N-word when he does his BET interview today. Seth said he does this thing around musicians that's really embarrassing. He said he'll start to hum or sing the musician's song. He said that it's silly and he'll just do it. He said he's found himself humming songs in front of these people. He said now he's going to have to tell himself not to say the N-word at BET. Robin said they'll read about that tomorrow in the news.\n\nHoward gave Seth some more plugs and said that the movie is opening this Wednesday. Seth said he thinks that it's opening up Tuesday night actually. Howard asked why they do that. Seth said he doesn't know.\n\nHoward said that he doesn't like that they keep telling the same story in the Superman movies. Howard said they tell the General Zod story every time. Seth said it's the same fucking shit every time. Howard said they should move on to a different criminal. Seth said that the problem is that the only guy who can go up against him is another Superman. Howard said fuck Superman movies if they keep telling the same story over and over. He said they should have him get raped by a demon with a huge cock. Howard and Seth spent a couple more minutes talking about that. Howard said he will see Superman eventually. Seth asked him to buy a ticket to his movie first. Howard said he'd do that.\n\nHoward said it would be great if Superman got throat cancer from eating out Lois Lane. Seth said that would have to be Kryptonian Papaloma Virus. Howard said Seth is going to have to get high before he goes to BET. Howard said he had to watch his movie ''This is the End'' on his little iPad. Howard said Sony sent him a copy on an iPad. He said that it said ''Charlie Rose'' on the back of it. He said that guy was watching it too. Howard wrapped up and went to break after that.\n\nTony Awards And More Vegas Discussions. 06/10/13. 9:20am\n\nAfter the break Howard came right back and said that he'd like to thank every girl in high school who saved him from getting throat cancer. Howard said he's consumed with that story about Michel Douglas. Howard said that Nelson Mandella is in the hospital for the same thing. Robin said it's not the same thing. Howard said Michael Douglas claims that it was from oral sex. Howard said he thinks he should stick to the story and he thinks he's right. Howard said the guy is also a smoker though so you never know. Robin said he had a nodule at the back of his tongue. Howard said it's a man's world. He said that they say blow jobs are good for you though. Robin said Michael was saying that you eat more pussy to get rid of the caner. Howard said the guy sounds like he's out of his mind.\n\nHoward said he didn't get to see anything in Vegas. He said he had one night to go out to dinner. He said he saw his two brother-in-laws and their wives. Howard said he played blackjack and he got wiped out in no time. Howard said that the dealer should have to show you what card they have underneath. Howard said they don't show you so there's no way to win. He said he knows how to play the game but he still loses. He said that he'd hit a 20 and she'd hit a 21. He said you just can't win.\n\nHoward said that people watched him on AGT and thought that they had the wrong show. He said they thought they had Nosferatu... or Noseferatu. Howard said he saw a story about a guy who lost his nose after going in for minor surgery.\n\nHoward said he told Gary to clear the schedule this week because he has so much stuff to get to. He brought up the Tony awards and Neil Patrick Harris singing the opening song. Howard wondered how he remembers all of that stuff.\n\nHoward said they ask them to cut promos for other countries for the shows like AGT. He said that they give you like one line to remember and he can't even do that. He said he noticed that they didn't ask him to do the promos for the Arab countries. He said they had Heidi do those promos.\n\nHoward had some audio of Neil Patrick Harris from the Tony Awards singing the opening of the show. Howard wondered how Neil remembers all of that shit. Howard said he hates Broadway and a basketball game was on that night but he found himself watching the Tony's. He said he switched over to Game of Thrones at 9 though.\n\nHoward played more clips from the Tony Awards and got some laughs out of how ridiculous the songs are. Howard said he was happy that Cyndi Lauper won but he was expecting some good songs. He said that she's into that Broadway play kind of music for the play Kinky Boots. Howard said he could write that music for that show. He said he really does want to do a Howard Stern Show musical. He said he's just lazy though. Fred played some music and Howard started singing a song that JD would sing. He had him singing about what he does there and about his trying to date Ashley Dupre.\n\nHoward told Robin to give him a subject to sing about. Robin told him to sing about Michael Douglas and his throat cancer. Howard immediately came up with a song where he sang about HPV and the throat cancer. Robin asked how Ronnie hasn't gotten anything. She said that he drinks everything from down there.\n\nHoward asked Ronnie for an update on his Batman moustache. Howard said it looks 10 times better. Ronnie said that everyone likes it. They say it looks neat. Howard said his old one used to drag him down. Ronnie said Seth Rogen's guys all got a kick out of it. He said Seth knew what it was. Ronnie said Seth's guys noticed it more than Seth did. He said Seth thought it was cool though.\n\nHoward said Ronnie sounds like he has a cold. Ronnie said it's his sinuses from Vegas. He said he has been there when it was 118 and it didn't do that to him. Howard said his lips were really dry and he had to drink so much he had to pee like 7 times at night. Ronnie said that Wendy Williams husband thought it was cool. He said that he liked it better than the stand up picture they have in the hall there.\n\nHoward said he thinks that his girlfriend is going to love it. Ronnie said he may shave it off tonight. Howard told him to keep it for a few days. Ronnie said he feels weird. Ronnie said the dark color is what's bothering him. Robin said it looks so much better. Ronnie said she's probably laughing to herself about it.\n\nHoward asked Gary what that guy charged them for the moustache. Gary didn't answer. Howard said it was probably their whole budget for the week. Howard was told it was 40 bucks. Howard said it was worth it. Howard read a live commercial and then went to break.\n\nPlease visit Amazon.com for all of your shopping needs.\n\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n\nRobin's News. 06/10/13. 9:45am\n\nAfter the break Howard came right back and said it was time for Robin's news.

Robin said that they still say he's killing in the ratings.\n\nRobin said that NBC has a crazy way of promoting things. She said they were promoting going to Vegas by watching the Miss USA pageant. Howard said that's crazy. Howard said that it's horrible to watch any kind of woman in front of your dad. Howard said you wonder if the guy has a hard on in front of you. He said he doesn't want to see that.\n\nHoward took a call from a guy who said he saw him out in Las Vegas in the elevator. Howard said there was a jewelry convention going on out there. He thinks he remembered this guy. Howard said he ran into Adam Levine out there in Vegas. He said Maroon 5 was doing a show out there for those people. Howard said that he was thinking they got paid like a million bucks to do that.\n\nHoward said he was out at the pool taking his shirt off and some fat bitch was taking his picture with her iPhone. Howard said he called her out on it and Beth got upset with him. Howard said that Beth looks great because she made money modeling. Howard said it's no big deal for her to go in a bathing suit but he hasn't worked out in a couple of months. The caller said his wife wanted to take a picture with Howard and he refused. Howard said he normally doesn't do that but when he's in a rush he doesn't take pictures. Howard said he was trying to be friendly in the elevator but then people want something from you. Howard said he could have taken the picture in the elevator but they waited until he was on his way to work.\n\nHoward said he ended up getting into the pool backwards with a hat on. He said that hot chick Dina Meyer was watching him with his titties and hairy chest. He said she must have thought he was a mess.\n\nHoward said that Beth told him to cover up so that woman couldn't take pictures of him. He said he put the towel on and he covered up like a chick. He said he knows that he'll end up in some magazine looking all fat. Howard said he can see the caption about how he grew man tits over the summer. Howard said they might say they think Robin had the big tits on the show.\n\nRobin got to her news and said that Paris Jackson tried to commit suicide. Robin said she took a knife and cut herself and there are stories going around about that. Robin said they say that this is just a cry for attention. Howard said he heard it was a machete that she took to herself. Howard said that's a big cry for attention. Howard said you feel bad for the kid. Robin said she was listening to Kurt Cobain music and wanted to go to a Marilyn Manson concert but no one could get her passes. Robin said that they say she's been suffering from depression for a while. Robin said she heard she was saying that she wants to live but not there. Robin said they say that she's one of these kids who has never heard the word ''no.'' Robin said the kid has a lot of pressure on her with everything going on in her life. Howard read a live commercial after that.\n\nRobin read a story about a cop who got a kidney transplant from an anonymous donor. Robin said that he got the transplant on Thursday. Robin said that someone stepped up and volunteered.\n\nRobin said that a Hollywood actress was found to be linked to the Ricin letters that were sent to Washington. Robin said she was charged with sending them to President Obama and Mayor Bloomberg. Robin said that this woman claims that her husband made her do this. Howard said the whole fucking world is nuts. Robin said some guy at the U.S. Open jumped on to the court with a flare. Robin said this crazy stuff is going on all over the place.\n\nHoward said that the Baba Booey mentions are all over the golf games. He thought they had some new ones but Jason said no according to Gary. Howard said he did have a clip of someone yelling out Baba Booey on the news. He played that clip where someone yelled out the Baba Booey thing during a live newscast. The guy yelled out that Baba Booey loves vinyl and started to say something about Joey Boots before they cut him off.\n\nRobin said that the plastic bags for your chips are dangerous for animals. Howard said it's the same for balloons. Robin said they had to rescue a deer with a Doritos bag on its head. Robin said that the bag got stuck on the deer's head. Howard said he would never see that since he's never in the wild. Robin said the deer remained calm until the bag was removed. Robin said it's unlikely that the bag was put on the deer intentionally.\n\nHoward said he likes this girl who is suing United Airlines over some guy masturbating for 6 hours while she was sitting next to her. Howard said he can't imagine who was sitting next to her other than Sting. Howard said that the airline must not have seen it going on. Howard said you don't necessarily see that going on. Howard read a live commercial after that.\n\nHoward said he still sounds like a young guy on radio. He said that's one good thing about radio. He said some guys do sound old. Howard said Ralph Howard had that voice. He sounded old and distinguished. Howard said they're getting a new guy but he loved that voice Ralph had. Howard said he told Ralph not to retire. He said he thinks that Ralph went to visit his kids or something after he retired.\n\nRobin got back to her news and asked what life must be like for the guy who played Chewbacca. Robin said that Peter Mayhew is 7'2'' tall and he walks with a light saber cane. Robin said he was stopped at the airport so they could examine his cane at the airport. Robin said they took it away for a little while because they thought it was suspicious. Howard said he might as well wear the whole costume instead of just carrying the cane. He said things must be bad for him if he has to carry a light saber cane around.\n\nHoward said he has to get that Amanda Bynes chick on the show. He said she tweets out a lot of crazy shit. He said that he's afraid to call her names because he calls people ugly. He said that she just calls them ugly immediately.

Howard said Breaking Bad is pretty well written. So is Dexter. Howard said The Sopranos was fucking brilliant. He said The Honeymooners was great. He said he doesn't understand that Game of Thrones. He said he's glad they killed off those two characters. Robin said that whole Stark family is too dumb to be on that show. Howard said that Khaleesi should be able to kill everyone with those dragons.\n\nHoward said the great show right now is Falling Skies. He said he got the first 5 episodes of the new season and it's great. Robin asked about Battlestar Galactica. Howard said no. He said he wants the whole season of Falling Skies. He told Gary to make that happen.\n\nRobin said the movie ''Now You See Me'' is great. She said that Howard will love you. She said it's edge of the seat kind of stuff.

Howard read a live commercial after that.\n\nRobin got back to the best written TV show and told Howard some of the other shows that were in the running. Robin said Seinfeld, the Twilight Zone, All in the Family and MASH were all in there too. Robin said Mad Men was the only show on the list that's still running.

He said he got a screener of a show called ''Under the Dome'' that's based on a Stephen King book. Howard said the premise is that a town has been enclosed by a dome and the show is good. He said the dome doesn't let you out or in. He said anything in the way of the dome when it comes down is cut in half. Robin asked why it is that we like scary and torturous premises like that. Howard said it's not that scary.\n\nRichard Christy said he read the book and it was 1100 pages. He said he reads on the subway on the way to work. Howard asked why he doesn't listen on an iPhone or something. Richard said that he'd rather not get it stolen. He said he knows JD had his iPod stolen. Richard said the book is like a weapon being so big. Howard said anything in a book no one is going to bother you.\n\nRobin asked if the show is starting soon. Howard said he's not sure. He said he just saw the first episode. He said Falling Skies is good too. He said he's seen the first 5 episodes. Howard he was sent a list of what's on this week on America's Got Talent but he can't remember any of it. He said that's on tonight.\n\nHoward said he has a lot of guests coming in today. He said Russell Brand is coming in and Ozzy Osbourne is coming in with Geezer Butler. Howard said he heard this new Black Sabbath album is great. He said he heard that Rick Rubin made the guys listen to their first album to get them all charged up. Fred said they recorded their first album in 2 days. He said their second album took 5 days.\n\nHoward took a call from a guy who said that the Johnny Cash song ''Burning Ring of Fire'' is about an STD. Howard said it is not. He said June Carter Cash wrote it about Johnny's addiction. He said that it wasn't anything to do with an STD. Howard played some of the song.\n\nRobin said she was trying to find that Jewel movie where she plays June Carter Cash. She said she wasn't able to find it. Howard said she was really good in it. He said she writes that song in the movie. Howard said that caller's interpretation of the song was good.\n\nVarious Audio Clips, Prank Calls, Song Parodies And More. 06/11/13. 6:10am\n\nHoward said he has to get to a lot of stuff today. He said he has a clip of this guy on Good Morning L.A. where he says he ran into Howard Stern at a burrito place. Howard said this is a complete fabrication. He said he hasn't been in L.A. and he didn't go to a burrito place. Howard said maybe the guy meant Howard K. Stern. Howard told Tony Potts that it wasn't him.\n\nHoward said Rihanna has a song out called ''We Found Love'' and the song is about him. Howard asked how old the song is. Gary said it's about a year old. Howard played the song and you hear her say something that sounds like ''Howard Stern is side by side...'' Robin had to hear it again. That's what it sounded like but she was saying something else. Howard asked what it is that she was saying. Gary said she says ''We're all standing side by side.'' Howard didn't get the first line of the song either. Howard had to play it again and figured it was ''Yellow diamonds in the light.''\n\nHoward said there's a beauty pageant called Miss World and they're not going to let the women wear bikinis because one country won't allow it. Donald Trump was talking about that in an interview and he said that he will never not have his contestants wear bikinis. Howard said it is pretty crazy that they won't let a woman wear a bikini. Robin said that in Dubai you can get arrested for kissing on the beach. Robin said people still go there because of the nice hotels. Howard said he wouldn't go there for 5 fucking minutes. He said there's no way he would go to Dubai for any reason. Howard said you have to be nuts.\n\nHoward said if he gets any fatter he should move there. He said he should cover up. He said he was trying on some new clothes yesterday and they have the live America's Got Talent coming up soon. He said he was at John Varvatos trying on some new stuff and he can't wear some stuff because his belly fat and titties are showing. He said he has to lose another 7 pounds or so. He said he's hitting the gym and trying to tighten up. Howard said his titties and belly started to sag so he's working on that.\n\nHoward said he's starving himself and he must be on the right track because he almost passes out. Robin said that sounds very healthy. Howard said it does, right?\n\nHoward played a new phony phone call the boys made to a Tradio show trivia game. They had clips of a bunch of people including Ronnie the Limo Driver, Dave Lampert, Evil Dave, George Takei, Robin Quivers and more. They had them throwing out answers that weren't even close. The question was about what line Rodney Dangerfield made famous.\n\nHoward said he got so many emails about Maria Menounos' laugh. He said he can't even do the impression of it. Howard said he has the gun scene from ''Scar Face'' where the guys used her laugh as the gun. Howard replayed it for those who liked it. Howard said that's a good one.\n\nHoward said he has a couple of songs that came in. He has one about Benjy tasting his own cum. Howard said Benjy says that everyone has done it. Howard said he hasn't but Benjy thinks everyone does. Howard played the song that Psych sent in about the cum eating. It was to the tune of ''Man Eater.'' He played another song about Robin that Psych sent in. He had one about JD too. Howard said that was a Queen song and it's such a great song. He and Fred spent a minute talking about how great that song was and how Freddie Mercury wrote it. Howard said Freddie was way ahead of his time. Robin said no one writes like that. Howard sang some of ''We Are the Champions'' and said just imagine he had that song and suggested recording it. Fred played the actual song and Howard sang along with it.\n\nHoward said the poor bastard got a hold of some bad cock. Fred said he wrote that and Brian May wrote ''We Will Rock You'' from what he was reading. Howard sang along with the song a bit and asked what he was thinking about when he wrote it. He said that they may have to get that Long Island Medium in there to contact him to ask.\n\nHoward said that Benjy had a weird idea. He wanted to go out and ask black people to tickle him. Howard said he did it and it seems kind of dangerous. Benjy said maybe it was a little bit. He said it was more interesting than dangerous. Howard played the audio where Benjy goes out and asks some black men to tickle him. One guy asked him to get away from him. Another group of guys said they weren't interested either. They told him to go ask some white guys because no black guys are going to do it.\n\nHoward said that Ronnie was talking about shaving off his Batman moustache. He said he's not sure why he would do that. Howard said he had a lot of people asking to take pictures with him. Howard said the elevator guy there had never even heard of Batman. Robin said she didn't know that was possible. Howard said he didn't either.\n\nHoward said the Batman thing inspired the guys to make a bit featuring Ronnie as Batman in the TV series. Howard played the clip where Ronnie is asking Cat Woman to get topless in the show. They had him getting all excited about it when the woman popped her boobs out. Howard said he's so glad they changed radio. He said you never heard anything like that on radio before he came around.\n\nHoward said Brad Pitt is out promoting the movie ''World War Z'' and he's really behind this movie. Howard said he's so into it that he's been showing up to screenings of the movie. Howard said he's had so many turkeys that he's making an effort to promote this one. Howard said Brad showed up at a screening and a guy was freaking out about it. Howard played the clip and it was a group of people screaming and you can hear a guy going nuts over Brad. Howard asked how that guy can have a normal life. He said he's talking about that guy and Brad Pitt. Howard said that you get applause but then you hear this guy screaming.\n\nHoward had a new tip from Richard Christy's Dad. In that clip Richard's dad was talking about watching out for snakes in the storm cellar. He said you have to make sure you don't step on one in the cellar. Howard asked why anyone would need that tip.\n\nHoward said this guy on the phone says he knows what ''We are the Champions'' is about. The caller said that he thinks it's about gay rights. Howard said that would make sense. Howard said the guy might be right. Howard said he doesn't think Mercury ever said that because he was closeted. The caller said he thought he was bi-sexual. Howard said he doesn't think he was. He said he thinks he was full gay. That led to them talking about the Liberace movie and how he would have liked to have played Liberace himself. He said they did a real hatchet job on that poor guy. Howard said it was bullshit. Robin said it was just one side of the tale. Howard said it was a dumb fucking movie. Howard said the performances in the movie were good but the story was bullshit.\n\nHoward said High Pitch Eric wants to be an interviewer for the show and he's the worst at it. He said he ran into Ty Pennington from Extreme Makeover. Howard played the clip of Eric asking him if he's a fan of Howard's. Ty said he was and he did an impression of Eric. Eric asked if he knows America's Got Talent. Ty said he does. He was goofing around with Eric about the show. Howard said Eric is an amazing interviewer.\n\nHoward said he had another song of Benjy drinking his own cum. He played that song and said he was going to throw up. Benjy said Howard admitted he had tasted his own cum too. Howard said he did not. Howard said he never said anything like that. Benjy said Howard did say that he kissed a woman after she blew him. Howard said if came in a woman's mouth he wouldn't kiss her. Benjy said he wants a lie detector test done. Howard said he's caught in the Benjy Vortex again.\n\nHoward took a call from a guy who said he loves him and loves him on AGT. Howard said he'll take that. Robin said she's looking up the meaning of We Are The Champions and Freddie said that it was about Football (Soccer) and not the gay thing. Howard said the gay thing was so much better.\n\nHoward looked to see what else he had to play. He said he has more but he has to take a break. Howard asked Robin how Paris Hilton is doing. Robin said she's out of the hospital and the mother of the kids is coming forward saying she could raise the kids. Howard said if Michael was still alive he'd be asleep and unconscious taking care of them. Howard said the whole story is shocking. He said not the suicide attempt but the fact that Marilyn Manson is still touring so much.\n\nHoward said that no one has ever tried to kill themselves after not being able to go to a Black Keys concert. He made it a point to tell Steve Brandano that.\n\nBatman And Superman Discussions. 06/11/13. 6:45am\n\nHoward said Ronnie's Batman beard is so great. He said he would like to shave the Superman logo into Jason's back. He said that would be great. He said they might have to bring that guy back to do that. Robin said he says it's not an S in the new Superman movie.\n\nJason came in and said that he almost did that shaving thing on his back this weekend. He said he thinks he does have enough hair back there to do it. Howard said he was thinking if Lisa G shaved the Cat Woman logo into her pubs then Batman could meet up with Cat Woman.\n\nHoward asked Jason about the new Superman movie and what he thought of it. Jason said he did and he knows Howard doesn't like the origin story. Howard said he knows the story already. He said we've seen the origin story on the TV series and in the movies 3 times. Jason said it's only been one time with Zod in it. Howard said it's too much Zod. Jason said it was only one with Zod. Howard said Zod was complete bullshit.\n\nHoward and Jason spent a minute talking about that. Jason said the special effects in the movie were great. He said the movie was cool. Howard said he'll watch it but it's the same old story to him. He said they should move on.\n\nHoward asked Robin if she's worried about the government listening to her phone conversations. Robin laughed. Howard said he was talking to Ralph about the new Superman movie and thinking about how they'd feel if they were listening to his calls.\n\nHoward said he's one of the people who thinks that Neil Patrick Harris said the N-word to Mike Tyson. He said he wanted to play just that part but he didn't think they had it. JD told Howard he needed about 5 minutes to get that done for him. Howard said Harris was singing a song to Tyson and he thinks that he used the N-word.\n\nHoward said that the Liberace guy, Scott Thorson, says that he had an affair with Michael Jackson too. Howard said Scott Thorson has probably had more music stars pass through his asshole than the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Howard said it's fucking crazy.\n\nHoward took a call from Mariann from Brooklyn who said Mel B was on the Tonight Show last night and dropped the F-word about 3 times. She said that they only gave one second of coverage to AGT. Howard said he saw Howie on the Kelly Ripa show yesterday. He said the other judges don't like to mention him. He said he thinks they're all jealous of him. He said he really is the best judge. Howard said they can't deal with it. Howard said Heidi told him that he speaks very well when they were taping the other day. He said that he waits for the producers to say things like that to him and they never do. Mariann said they're only watching for Howard. Howard told Mariann to watch tonight. Howard let Mariann go a short time later. Robin said Mariann is in the opening of the show. She's a big deal.\n\nJD came in with the clip Howard was looking for. He played the clip of Neil Patrick Harris singing to Mike Tyson and thought he heard the N-word. Howard said it would be great if he did that. He said it would be funny if Tyson knocked him out in the middle of the number. They went to break a short time later.\n\nPlease visit Amazon.com for all of your shopping needs.\n\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n\nRussell Brand Visits. 06/11/13. 7:00am\n\nAfter the break we heard a Jack and Rod Show bit where Sal and Richard had an author of a trivia book on the line to play a riddle game. Fred also played Marilyn Manson's ''Sweet Dreams'' as they were coming back.\n\nHoward came back and said this song was great. He said he was watching the new iOS announcement yesterday. He said he can't wait for this new OS. He said they're going to have a new radio service. He said that should be good for broadcasters. Howard said that means new jobs for broadcasters. Howard said some of the stations are automated but when they want to break through they have to rely on a human being. Howard said it still breaks down to someone doing something cool. Howard said that it only puts them in the driver's seat. Howard said it's more distribution.\n\nHoward said he was reading about the new OS and they're going to have a new control center and a flashlight function. Howard said the apps will multitask. He said you can manage the apps so they don't drain the battery. He said Siri is getting updated. He said the App Store will automatically update. Howard said they had it the other way so you could choose to update it. Howard said they'll have better security too. He said they're changing the icons and stuff like that too. He said they have to do cool stuff all the time.\n\nHoward said Russell Brand is there. He said he's dating up a storm since he broke up with Katy Perry. Howard said he looks better than ever. He said that he read that Tom Cruise gave him a yoga mat. Russell said he did. Howard asked why he's not doing movies. Russell said he asked Howard last time he was there what he should do and he told him to concentrate on his stand-up. Howard said he shouldn't listen to him. Russell said he's doing a world tour. He said he's going to Palestine. Howard asked if he's nuts. Russell said Howard told him like Obi Wan Kenobi to do this. Howard asked what the name of the club in Palestine is. Russell said he doesn't know. Russell said he's been doing sone philanthropic work as well. Robin said she doesn't understand his career now. Howard said he's like Audrey Hepburn.\n\nHoward asked Russell what he's actually doing. Russell said that Howard told him to concentrate on his stand-up career and he took that seriously. He said he can work with people directly doing that. Howard said he is good at it. He said he has the gift of gab but he would never advise him to go to Palestine. Howard said it is hard to do international stuff. He said Mel B doesn't get some comedian's humor on AGT because of the cultural differences.\n\nRussell told Howard that his show is called the Messiah Complex. He said that he has a bunch of symbols on his poster that might fire some people up. Howard asked whose idea it was to go to Palestine. Russell said it was his idea. He said people did tell him it wasn't a good idea.\n\nHoward asked where he's performing in the United States. Russell laughed and said you can't say that in this day. He said that it's one world. Howard said he likes all of the other countries. Howard said he loves the United States. He said he won't leave the country. He said he doesn't even like some of the states he has to go to. He said he gets freaked out.\n\nHoward asked when he's performing here in the states. Russell said he's starting in August and going through September all over the country. Howard asked if he will talk about Katy Perry in his act. Howard said that's what Richard Pryor would do. Howard said that he should do that and bring up the nitty gritty stuff. Russell said he didn't know Katy was nitty gritty. Howard said that her parents didn't like him, did they? Russell said he thought he got along with them very well actually. Robin said he has to think about the way he thinks.\n\nHoward said that he loves that he thinks he got along with them. He said they have said they prayed to god that he'd leave her. Howard said they're glad he's out of her life.\n\nHoward asked Russell about going out and protesting and getting naked at the protest. Russell told Howard about why he was protesting and it was about anti-capitalism. He said he was high at the time. Howard said when you get naked in public you must have a big cock. Russell said it was very cold out that day. He said he was on a lot of drugs too. He said that he was 20 years old and it looked like a bald patch in his pubic area. He said he looked down and saw how ridiculous it looked and tried to masturbate it into a bigger state and got arrested for masturbation in public.\n\nHoward asked if that comes up when he tries to get a green card. Russell said it does come up and he had to apologize and say that it would never happen again. He said there was so much rigmarole to get that card.\n\nRussell said he wanted to tell Howard about his stand-up tour. He said he'll be talking about people like Malcolm X, Che Guevara, and people like that. Howard said that capitalism is a great thing. He said profit is a great motivater. He said that it makes people rise up. Russell said that it's gone a little too far. Howard said he's not going to get up at 4 in the morning for communism. Russell said that he has done a lot with his own limited ability.\n\nHoward said he heard the most outrageous thing about Russell. He said he heard he's dating up a storm and the chicks are hot. He said he's seen pictures of the women. Howard said he's been fucking like crazy. He said he had some names but he doesn't know these girls. He said one is Theresa Palmer. Russell said he dated her before Katy. Howard said he heard that he was so into her that he hired Paul McKenna to hypnotize him into thinking she wasn't that hot so he could get away from her. Russell said he was making a movie at the time and this woman is beautiful. He said he had to have her but he wanted to have sex with the extras on the film. He said he called Paul and asked him to help. Howard said that these women get hurt if he does things that way. Russell said he'll tell a girl that they're alive here for a short time and he just wants to have some fun. Howard said he can't get away with that. Howard said the young girls believe they're going to be in a relationship. Russell asked if they really do. Howard said yes. Howard told JD to go out and try that himself. Howard said he'd get smacked in the head if he tried it himself. Russell said he loves women. Howard said he really doesn't. He said that he is a misogynist.\n\nHoward asked if Paul really helped. Russell told Howard that he did. He said that hypnosis works on him. Howard said Paul is a nice guy. He said he's had him on the show. Russell told Howard that Paul had him imagining this woman with him with a bunch of other guys. Then he had her imagining her head on a fat woman's body. Russell said that wasn't working either. He said he ended up sleeping with her anyway.\n\nHoward said the crazy thing he heard about Russell was about Katy calling him about going out with John Mayer and then coming over to make out with him. Howard said Katy and Russell were still talking and that irked John Mayer. Howard said Katy and Russell were seen making out in a Valet line at some club. Russell said that is not true. He said he loves a bit of gossip but that's not right.\n\nHoward asked Russell if he believes in a personal god. Russell said he believes in god. Howard asked if he believes that he's going to go meet god and go to a special place. Russell said he doesn't believe that. He said he thinks that our consciousness continues. Howard said he thinks he's dreaming. Howard said he thinks that we just die. Russell said that energy can only transform and not disappear. Howard said he's wrong about that. Howard said the world isn't even round. Russell said he has seen it on the telly and it is round.\n\nHoward said they did a poll where they asked who the smelliest celebrity is and Russell won. Russell said he isn't smelly. Howard said this was a poll they did for a Panasonic steam washer. Howard said they asked people across the U.K. about this and that's who they came up with. Howard took a smell of Russell and said that it's no wonder women want to sleep with him. Howard said he smells a little soapy and he smells nice. Howard said he felt bad for him in this poll. He said he gets that all the time so he knows how it must feel.\n\nHoward asked Russell how he prepares for a stand-up tour. Russell said he learns everything he can about someone like Malcolm X and he thinks about how he would relate to other people and he goes up and talks about him and then watches the tape and marks down the funny moments. Robin asked what inspired him to talk about this. Russell said that he wanted to talk about the things that matter because things have become meaningless these days.\n\nHoward said he read about how Russell failed to seduce Jennifer Lawrence. Russell said he's never even met her. Howard said he read that he hit on her at a party and she denied him twice. Russell said he was at that party but he wasn't hitting on her. Russell said that she is an amazing woman. Howard asked if he even said hello to Jennifer. Russell said he didn't. He said that she does appear to be a fantastic woman though.\n\nHoward said Russell's hero musically is Morrissey. Howard said he read that he met the guy and a girl with big tits walked by and he was so distracted that he missed out on the conversation. Russell said he walked away to go after those boobs. He said it doesn't matter how great the conversation is because we're wired to find certain things attractive. He said that's why he went after that girl.\n\nHoward asked why he doesn't know the music of Morrissey. Russell said that Howard is American so maybe he doesn't know it so well. Howard asked to hear some of his music. Russell told him to play some ''How Soon is Now'' so Howard had Fred look that up. Fred found the song and played it for Howard. Russell told Howard what some of the lyrics were and Howard didn't say much of anything about it.\n\nHoward said Russell is going on a world comedy tour and it kicks off in August. Robin said goodbye to him. Howard asked what he's going to be playing when he's here in the U.S. Russell said he's going to play theaters. Howard said he should take over a Broadway theater for a few weeks and tape it to air later. Russell said he should do that and forget the middle eastern countries. Howard asked if he's afraid to go over there. Russell said that he's not afraid.\n\nHoward took a call from Sour Shoes who was doing his Katy Perry impression. Russell had no idea what was going on. He said he has a bunch of lunatics on the phone. Howard asked if it's true that Katy called him after her break up with John Mayer. Russell said that is not true.\n\nHoward said he heard Russell tell a story about how he tried to get Tom Cruise to convert him to be a Scientologist. Russell said that he would say he was lonely and he was looking for something to help and ask if he knew what could help. He said Tom would just mumble and walk away.\n\nHoward said if you want to get tour dates for Russell's shows you can go to RussellBrand.tv. Howard asked why he doesn't have the .com. Howard said that he lost HowardStern.com when someone registered it but the guy had a meeting with him and gave it up just because he met with him. He said the guy was a nice guy.\n\nHoward said he's looking forward to the day that he marries Jennifer Lawrence and then comes in there a year later and her parents are thanking god that he's out of her life. Howard wished him luck on his tour and wished him luck in Palestine. Howard said if he can make it here then he can make it anywhere.\n\nHoward asked if his TV show is done. Russell said that the show was hard to do and FX was done with it so they're finished. He said that the show just didn't work. He said Howard told him to go out and do stand-up anyway so he was busy making calls booking Palestine. Howard said he's learning to tell girls they're divine in Arabic. Howard told him to watch who he bangs over there. He said he can't just go around banging women. Howard wrapped up and went to break a short time later.\n\nOzzy Osbourne And Geezer Butler Visit. 06/11/13. 7:50am\n\nAfter the break we heard a Jerky Boys prank call where the guys were calling about buying an awning. Fred also played Katy Perry's ''Wide Awake'' as they were coming back.\n\nHoward came back and said that Ozzy Osbourne and Geezer Butler are there to promote a new Black Sabbath album. Howard said people said it would never happen but it has. Howard said he wanted to just look at Ozzy and Geezer. Ozzy said that he thought he'd be dead by now. Geezer said he did too. Howard said Geezer is a vegan and an animal guy now. Howard said he's a clean living dude. Howard said that they know what it's like to have a big career. He asked what it's like to have the front man decide to leave. Geezer said that the whole band was falling apart at the time. He said it was the drugs and they were managing themselves and doing everything themselves. He said it was impossible. He said everyone had different opinions about what to do and they weren't business oriented. He said they went to some lawyers and they started getting ripped off.\n\nHoward said Geezer said that Ozzy would have died if they had stayed together. Ozzy said ''absolutely.'' Ozzy said the first album was very fun but then they started getting ripped off and he started drinking more and doing more drugs.\n\nOzzy said that if you're broke and you get a $100 bill you think you're rich. He said that he was driving around in a Beetle and his manager was driving around in a Rolls Royce. He said he knew something was wrong. Geezer said then they got the tax bill and they saw even more was wrong.\n\nHoward said that their first album was recorded in 2 days. Ozzy said he wishes they could do that now. He said the first album was like a live album. He said they had nothing to lose back then. Howard said it's too much pressure now. He said you can't just go make music and have a good time.\n\nHoward asked how the band got back together. Ozzy said he's not sure what kicked it off. He said they would get back together once in a while over the years.\n\nHoward asked Geezer how this happened. Geezer said he was working with Tony Iommi. Howard asked how his health is now. Ozzy said he's doing well. Howard said Ozzy has no idea how they got back together. Ozzy said he's right. Howard asked how it came about. Geezer said they had a conflict over the Black Sabbath name and they got together to talk about that. He said he solved some problems and that led to them doing another album.\n\nHoward said that Geezer has had that name for a long time and now the name is fitting. He said he's getting older now. Howard asked how he got the name. Geezer said that's just a nickname they use in the UK.\n\nHoward asked Ozzy how long he's been sober. Ozzy said he has been sober for 101 days now. He said that he wasn't going to his meetings and stuff and he started drinking. He said that it happens from time to time. He said he just wanted to get fucking drunk.\n\nHoward asked Ozzy if he's going to be okay out on tour. Ozzy said he has an army of people around him now. He said he has a cop keeping an eye on him. Howard asked who hired them. Ozzy said it ain't him so who does he think did it. Howard said it must be Sharon. Howard said he got a call from Sharon last night. Howard said he was talking to her and he thinks that he could fuck her. Ozzy said he's a better man than him. He said he's been trying for a long time now and it's not working.\n\nOzzy said he has a sober companion now. He said he's with him 24 hours a day. Howard said he'd love to be his sober companion. Ozzy said the guy is just a regular guy. Howard said that must be so cool to be his sober companion. Howard asked if he ever calls the guy. Ozzy said he does. He said he helps him get to meetings and things. Ozzy said he had a glass of wine at Christmas and Sharon found out about it. Howard asked why she would leave a bottle around. Ozzy said that led to a bottle of Vodka.\n\nHoward asked Ozzy if he's happy that Sharon is working so much now. Ozzy said she's going to England to the X-Factor show. He said she loves it. Howard said you can't leave Ozzy alone. Geezer said Ozzy hid the drinking from them pretty well. He said he thought he was doing too much coffee. Ozzy said that he was back into everything. He said he was writing songs about it. Howard asked how long it lasted. Ozzy said it was about a year. He said he is a big boy. Ozzy said it was fun for about 5 minutes. Ozzy said that he wasn't drinking or doing anything for years. Howard said he was like a health freak.\n\nOzzy said he forgot what it was like to feel dreadful in the morning. Howard said that's why he won't quit therapy. He said he has to go or he'll feel that way.\n\nHoward said he thought that they did this album sober. Ozzy said they sort of did. Howard said they must have hated each other in the studio. Ozzy said he didn't feel that way. He said they tried this before in 2001 and it didn't work. He said they were all living in the same house and it just wasn't working.\n\nHoward asked who writes. Ozzy told Howard who comes up with each part of the songs and how the process works. Howard said that sounds pretty simple.\n\nHoward asked why they weren't able to do the band thing in 2001. Geezer said that it just didn't work because they were living in the same place and Ozzy was still doing his TV show and working on his book. Howard asked if that TV show thing pissed them off. Howard said Ozzy was off being a Hollywood star. Ozzy said that wasn't his fucking idea. He said he doesn't do TV anymore.\n\nHoward asked Geezer what he thought of the Ozzy TV show. Geezer said he just figured that he was moving on with is life and moving away from music. He said he wasn't thinking about getting the band together at the time.\n\nHoward said the guys hired Rick Rubin to produce the album. Howard asked Ozzy if he thinks he should shave his beard. Ozzy said he thinks it's fine. He said he's doing just fine with that big beard. He said he might grow a beard like that himself.\n\nHoward asked Ozzy where they go to promote this album. Ozzy said they're doing their fair share of promotion. Ozzy said he went to a Grammy party and people were telling him how great the album is and they never got good reviews in the past. Howard said it's weird to get good reviews. Geezer said something must be wrong if they're getting good reviews.\n\nHoward said he has their new song ''God is Dead'' to play. Howard asked who came up with the idea for this one. Ozzy said he did. He said he was in the doctor's office when he saw the cover of Time magazine that said ''God is dead.'' Howard said that they're satanists and they're always talking like that. Howard played some of the new song off their new album ''13.''\n\nHoward said he loves this. Robin said they sound good. Howard let the song play through a little more. Howard asked Ozzy if he has to remember all of the new lyrics. Ozzy said he has a teleprompter. He said it's on the floor in front of him but he has to run around on stage so they have to move it around for him. Howard asked how many dates they're going to do. Ozzy said they're going to do 6 weeks on and 3 weeks off. He said that they're serious about this. Geezer said they're doing 20 gigs in the U.S.\n\nHoward asked if the guys who have to watch Ozzy are all with him now. Ozzy said they are. He said they're in the green room now. Howard said he wants to meet one of the guys. He told them to bring someone in. Ozzy told them to bring in Rick.\n\nGary came in and said that Rick didn't want to come in. Dave came in instead. Howard asked Dave about what they do to keep Ozzy from drinking. Dave said they won't let a bottle get near him. He said it's a full time job. He said they walk into the room before Ozzy goes in. He said they have to scan the room for anything and they make sure there is no mini bar in the room. Howard said he loves Ozzy's life. He said that it's out of control. Ozzy said it's beautiful. Howard said it's all about Ozzy. He said he must not have gotten any attention as a child. Ozzy said he didn't. He said that it's not his fault that he's an alcoholic drug addict.\n\nHoward asked Dave about sweeping the room and if he checks the suitcase. Dave said he packs the suitcase for Ozzy. Howard said they do everything for him. Sharon picks out the clothes and Dave packs it. Howard asked if Ozzy ever touches the bag. Ozzy said he never does. Dave said he takes the bags to the hotel and puts the clothes into the room. He said Ozzy never touches the bag. Howard asked if he's 9 years old. Ozzy said Sharon dresses him.\n\nHoward said Geezer is trying not to laugh too hard at this. Geezer said that he has to be searched before he goes into Ozzy's room. Ozzy said it's like being in prison. Howard asked Geezer if he drinks. Geezer said he does. He said that he won't drink if he has a gig the next day but he does drink.\n\nGary asked if Ozzy is allowed to carry money or credit cards. Dave said he is. He said he has his own card and cash. Howard asked if he has ever used the card and it bounces. Ozzy said it does that all the time. Howard asked if Dave has to make sure he doesn't drink mouthwash or anything. Dave said it's not that bad.\n\nHoward asked Dave how many of them there are. Dave said there are three of them. Dave said they're there at all times. He said they're even on the side of the stage during a show. He said they run out on stage to make sure no one throws him any drugs or anything. Dave said he's known Ozzy for 17 years so he knows him well.\n\nHoward asked Dave what he does if Ozzy threatens to fire him. Dave said he tells Ozzy that only Sharon can fire him. Howard said this must be working but it sounds like a nightmare for Ozzy. Ozzy said he's turning 65 this year and he can't even think about a doobie. He said that he's fucked.\n\nHoward asked Ozzy if he's ever thought about just snorting a whole bag of coke. Ozzy said he did that for 45 years. Robin said there was talk of the two of them splitting up. Ozzy said it came close. He said she confronted him about it and that was the end of it. He said that she ripped his coat off and threw coffee on him. Howard asked what she did to his car. Ozzy said she got rid of everything. She wouldn't let him drink or drive his Ferrari. He said he was too fucked up to drive that car anyway.\n\nHoward said what's great about Ozzy is that everyone gets caught up in the circus. Howard said he would have so much guilt. Ozzy said he does have that guilt but what is he going to do about it?\n\nHoward said he was interviewing Rod Stewart and he was saying he's going to have more kids. Howard said he's care free. He said Roger Daltrey is the same way. Ozzy said he has like 17 kids. Howard said Roger doesn't worry about anything. Howard said Geezer doesn't either. Howard said no one checks him like they check Ozzy. Howard said he loves this job Dave has. Howard asked what it pays. Dave said he has a smile on his face so that's all he'll say. He said he grew up idolizing Ozzy so that's payment in itself.\n\nHoward said that he misses Sharon on AGT. He said she's so glamorous with the jewelry. Ozzy told him to shut up. Howard said that he realized why Ozzy has to tour so much. He said that she has so much jewelry. Howard said she must be getting paid well doing the shows she's doing. Ozzy said he has no idea. He said she's a later bloomer.\n\nHoward said he's excited about this new tour. He said there isn't much to get excited about these days. Ozzy said that he could never do the talent shows like Howard and Sharon do. Howard said he enjoys it. Ozzy said that Sharon must love it because she flies to London to do i"
