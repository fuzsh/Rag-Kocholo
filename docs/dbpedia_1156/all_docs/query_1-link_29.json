        "text": "Subject: Albums in order: Deja Vu\n\nWhile not strictly a Neil Young album, Deja Vu along with the live album 4 Way Street and Sea Of Madness on the Woodstock album and the single Ohio and the ubiquitous b-side Sugar Mountain are the ways many people (including me) were first introduced to Neil's music. Deja Vu is a very good album which I played many many times in my formative years thus it's pretty well imprinted in my brain.\n\nListening to it today, for the first time in many years, was like going back in time. I remember having a hard time hearing Neil's contributions to some of the songs long ago and now of course I know why: he didn't play on all the tracks. But I always loved trying to pick out his lead guitar in songs like Almost Cut My Hair and Woodstock.\n\nI like all the songs to some extent, though many have been over-played for me like Our House. Helpless and Country Girl (part of which came from the Down Down Down Buffalo Springfield track not released until the Box Set came out) are both great songs. It was interesting to me and a great indicator of what was to follow, that as much as I loved Deja Vu , the next Neil Young album was for me a much more satisfying record. But, I very much enjoyed listening to Deja Vu today.\n\nMike - Expecting To Fly"
