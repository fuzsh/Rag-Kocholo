        "text": "Playboy to Open First European Concept Boutique in London\n\n, Dec. 19 -- Playboy Enterprises, Inc. (PEI) announced today that it will open a freestanding Playboy Concept Boutique on London's popular Oxford Street, next spring. Reflecting the global fashion- lifestyle brand's retail strategy to launch at least three stores per year over the next few years, Playboy's upscale shopping destination will be owned and operated under license by Global Designer Brands (GDB).\n\n\"Historically, Playboy has had a longstanding relationship with London, one of the biggest fashion capitals in the world. Playboy's growing retail success at London's preeminent retailers has demonstrated consumer demand to expand confidently to a freestanding Playboy Concept Boutique in this desirable market,\" said Christie Hefner, chairman and CEO of Playboy Enterprises, Inc. \"Given Oxford Street's reputation for offering the latest fashions to discerning London shoppers, we believe that the freestanding Playboy store, while complementing our third-party distribution, will create additional interest and enthusiasm for our wide range of products.\"\n\nThe Playboy Concept Boutique in London will be the eighth in the world, following store openings in:\n\n* Tokyo (2002), which was recognized as one of 40 top stores in the world by the Retail Leaders Association * Las Vegas (May 2005), the first U.S. retail location at The Forum Shops * Melbourne (September 2005), in Australia's fashionable Chapel Street area * Hong Kong (January 2006), in Causeway Bay's upscale Fashion Walk area * Kuala Lumpur (July 2006), in Utama Shopping Mall, Malaysia's premier fashion area * Bangkok (August 2006), in the new Central World Plaza Mall * Auckland (Spring 2007), in Sylvia Park, the country's largest shopping center\n\nIn addition to the Playboy Concept Boutiques, a high-end retail boutique opened in June 2006 in the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. The store is part of a larger entertainment destination, which is operated by the Palms Casino Resort and the N9NE Group, and opened in October 2006, revealing a nightclub, boutique casino and lounge, and sky villa, all featuring the world- famous Playboy Rabbit Head.\n\nThe Playboy Concept Boutique in London will offer a unique shopping experience to style-conscious men and women, as well as to Playboy enthusiasts. Unlike traditional retailers, the Playboy Concept Boutiques emphasize a design-driven look, inspired by the spirit of Playboy and representing concepts inherent to the iconic brand. Their fixturing is purpose-developed for Playboy, making the architectural elements \"concepts\" unto themselves, with furniture and fixtures inspired by Playboy iconography, enhancing the shopping experience. The exciting format and design of the store undoubtedly will be a destination point for European shoppers. Offering men's and women's collections of Playboy apparel, jewelry, accessories, footwear, and swimwear, the new location also will feature the high-end \"Playboy Intimates\" white-label lingerie and Playboy \"Icon\" collection of evening dresses.\n\nIn addition to the Playboy Concept Boutique in London, Playboy opened its first-ever fashion showroom in May 2005, occupying two floors at 48 Beak Street in the trendy Soho area. The venue serves as a fashion hub for media and retail buyers. Further demonstrating its commitment to the London market, Playboy opened a regional office on Rosebery Avenue in Holborn in fall 2006.\n\nIn May 2006, Playboy Editor-in-Chief Hugh Hefner visited London for the first time in over five years to celebrate his 80th birthday with an exclusive in-store event to launch Playboy men's underwear at Harvey Nichols. Other London retail partnerships have included the debut at Selfridges of Playboy's prestige cosmetics collection, \"Playboy Beauty\" and \"Playboy Exposed\" at Harvey Nichols, a photo exhibit of the most iconic images in Playboy's history that were incorporated in men's and women's fashion items. Luxury retailers that have carried Playboy fashion merchandise also include Henri Bendel in New York; Kitson in Los Angeles; Colette in Paris; Galeries Lafayette in Berlin; Daslu in Sao Paolo, and Seibu and Sogo in Hong Kong.\n\nPlayboy's branded line of licensed fashion and consumer products has experienced exceptional growth at retail since its repositioning in 1999, with a product offering that includes men's and women's fashion apparel and accessories, underwear, legwear, outerwear and footwear, as well as home furnishings and lifestyle and entertainment products. Playboy's licensed products business as a whole now generates in excess of $700 million in global retail sales in more than 130 countries and territories. Celebrities and fashion influencers spotted wearing Playboy fashions and accessories include Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, Janet Jackson, Jade Jagger, Snoop Dogg, and Lenny Kravitz.\n\nAbout Playboy Enterprises, Inc.\n\nPlayboy Enterprises is a brand-driven, international multimedia entertainment company that publishes editions of Playboy magazine around the world; operates television networks and distributes programming globally; owns Playboy.com, a leading men's lifestyle and entertainment web site; and licenses the Playboy trademark internationally for a range of consumer products and services.\n\nSource: Playboy Enterprises, Inc.\n\nOscar(R) Winners Adrien Brody and Ben Affleck, Academy Award(R) Nominee Diane Lane All Star in the 2006 Golden Globe-Nominated Thriller Inspired by Hollywood's Most Notorious Unsolved Mystery 'Hollywoodland'\n\n'The performances by Adrien Brody, Diane Lane and Ben Affleck are all Oscar(R)-worthy. This is one sensational film.' -Larry King\n\nOn DVD February 6, 2007 From Universal Studios Home Entertainment\n\nDec. 19 -- Ben Affleck (\"Good Will Hunting,\" \"Pearl Harbor\") is a Golden Globe Award nominee* for his riveting performance in \"Hollywoodland,\" a story of scandal, corruption and a star's mysterious death during Hollywood's Golden Era. The film comes to DVD and HDDVD/DVD Combo format on February 6, 2007 from Universal Studios Home Entertainment.\n\nAcademy Award(R) winner Affleck, along with Academy Award(R) winner Adrien Brody (\"King Kong,\" \"The Pianist\") and Oscar(R) nominees Diane Lane (\"The Perfect Storm,\" \"Unfaithful\") and Bob Hoskins (\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\"), leads a sterling cast in the critically acclaimed account of the strange demise of actor George Reeves, known to a generation of Americans as television's Superman. The price of celebrity is viewed in a stark light in this compelling retelling of Tinsel Town's most infamous real-life mystery. Allen Coulter (The Sopranos, Sex and the City) makes an outstanding feature film directorial debut with a picture-perfect thriller set against the glamour and corruption of 1950s Hollywood. Affleck dazzles as the increasingly desperate Reeves, a performance that earned him Best Actor honors at the 2006 Venice International Film Festival. A murder mystery with a twist, \"Hollywoodland\" dramatizes a search for the truth that will keep audiences guessing at every turn. The DVD includes exciting bonus features that take viewers inside classic Hollywood for a glimpse of the toxic effects of celebrity.\n\nIn \"Hollywoodland,\" low-rent private detective Louis Simo (Adrien Brody) is hired to investigate the premature death of Hollywood striver George Reeves (Ben Affleck). Haunted by his own success and unable to shed the superhero image created by his popular television show, Reeves is found dead, apparently by his own hand. As Simo probes the circumstances surrounding the actor's death, he finds tantalizing suggestions of foul play involving Reeves' fiancee, his wealthy lover and her movie mogul husband -- and puts himself at risk. The DVD is priced at $29.98 SRP. The combo disc is priced at $39.98.

Larry King declared, \"The performances by Adrien Brody, Diane Lane and Ben Affleck are all Oscar(R)-worthy,\" and that \"this is one sensational film.\"\n\nINTRIGUING BONUS FEATURES\n\nThe \"Hollywoodland\" DVD contains more than a half-hour of exclusive bonus features including:\n\n- Deleted Scenes - Recreating Old Hollywood - In this piece, the production team demonstrates how they re-created the glamour of the Hollywood of yesteryear. Interviews include ones with the film's production designer, set decorator, costume designer, make-up artists and hair stylists. - Behind the Headlines - Director Allen Coulter, screenwriter Paul Bernbaum, and other members of the creative team reveal which elements of the film story are based on fact, and what creative liberties they had to take in order to tell the story of the unsolved mystery surrounding George Reeves' death. - Hollywood Then and Now - With help from historians, filmmakers, actors and other experts, explore how Hollywood has changed in the last 60 years, as the similarities and difference between \"classic\" Hollywood and today's big city are examined. - Feature Commentary with Director Allen Coulter SYNOPSIS\n\nBased on the true story of Hollywood's most notorious unsolved mystery, \"Hollywoodland\" is a tale of glamour, scandal, and corruption in 1950s Los Angeles. When George Reeves (Ben Affleck), star of TV's Adventures of Superman, is found dead in his home, millions of fans are shocked by the circumstances of his death. The police and the studio bosses want the case closed as a suicide, but rumors linger. Louis Simo (Adrien Brody), a private investigator, picks up the trail and begins to piece together the actor's last, tension-filled days. Who pulled the trigger? Was it the seductive yet scheming fiancee, the spurned lover (Diane Lane), the enraged husband (Bob Hoskins), or was it Reeves himself? Simo must find out before the truth is buried forever.\n\nFor more information please visit: www.hollywoodlandmovie.com CAST & FILMMAKERS Director: Allen Coulter Written By: Paul Bernbaum Produced By: Glenn Williamson Director of Photography: Jonathan Freeman Film Editor: Michael Berenbaum Production Designer: Leslie McDonald Costume Designer: Julie Weiss Music By: Marcelo Zarvos Cast: Adrien Brody, Diane Lane, Ben Affleck, Bob Hoskins, Lois Smith, Robin Tunney TECHNICAL INFORMATION DVD Street Date: February 6, 2007 Pre-Order Close: January 9, 2007 Copyright: 2007 Universal Studios.

Much has changed in the ensuing years, but sportinglife.com remains one of the most recognisable brands in British sport.\n\n\"I can't believe it's been 10 years, but the site has never stopped changing and developing in that time,\" says Graham Shaw, editor-in-chief of sportinglife.com, who has been with the site since 1996. \"We've had many different styles and columnists,, but the biggest development has been the advent of broadband, which has brought more sports fans to the site and allowed them to follow the action nearly as fast as we can deliver the news and information.\n\n\"What hasn't changed is our commitment to the delivery of high quality sports news, which helped us make the transition to an internet-focused brand when The Sporting Life newspaper closed in 1998.\"\n\nLaunched as a joint venture between Trinity Mirror - then owners of the newspaper version - and the Press Association, sportinglife.com was sold in 2001 to what is now 365 Media Group plc (currently the subject of a recommended cash offer from BskyB). It has since become part of a stable of internet-based sports brands that includes Football365.com, Sportal.com and TEAMtalk.com.\n\n\"sportinglife.com has continued to generate a huge loyal following because it continues to do its job so well\" says Andy Roberts, head of marketing for 365 Media Group. \"That's because for the sports fan, sportinglife.com has always been and still is the best for the latest breaking sports news, live scores and results.\"\n\nBroadcaster Tony Jardine is the F1 columnist for the site and sportinglife.com also sponsors his successful rally team.\n\n\"2006 marks the seventh year of sportinglife.com's association with my rally campaign, during which time the site has really grown in profile and popularity,\" says Tony. \"The team is very proud to be associated with such a prestigious website, which covers such a broad spectrum of sports and has such a powerful reach.\"\n\nVisit www.365mediagroup.co.uk for more information.\n\nSource: 365 Media Group Plc\n\nWicked, Jimmy Buffett and Tim McGraw & Faith Hill Are 'Most Requested Events' in 2006\n\nDisney on Ice and New England Patriots Are Year's Most Requested Family and Sporting Events, Respectively\n\nDec. 19 -- Wicked, the Broadway musical and theatrical tour was the top \"Most Requested Event\" in 2006 according to Ticketmaster, the world's leading ticketing company.

If a picture is worth a thousand words, then each quote is worth at least 500.”\n\nAll of the lines showcased in the poster except one are from films that have received an Academy Award® nomination for Best Picture, Writing, or both, between 1936 and 2005. (Finding the exception should be the first of many trivia contests that the Academy expects the poster to generate.)\n\nThe concept and design for the poster was created for the Academy by TBWA\\Chiat\\Day Los Angeles.

Records, \"1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hour\" was a compilation of Green Day's early no-frills EPs \"39/Smooth,\" \"Slappy,\" and \"1,000 Hours.\" In 1992, Lookout! released the more melody-minded \"Kerplunk,\" which marked the recorded debut of drummer Tré Cool, who brought an impressive blend of energy, speed, and technique to the mix. The album included the stand-out tracks \"Welcome to Paradise\" (re-recorded for Green Day's 1994 Reprise debut \"Dookie\"), and the rampaging opener \"2,000 Light Years Away.\" \"Kerplunk\" sold 50,000 copies in the U.S., a considerable feat for an indie punk band at the time, and went on to sell more than 2 million copies worldwide.\n\nThe remastered recordings will delight old and new fans alike, and prove once again why Entertainment Weekly has called Green Day \"the most influential band of its generation.\"\n\nSire Recording Artists Armor for Sleep Head Into the Studio\n\n-- New Jersey-based post-hardcore quartet, Armor for Sleep, are heading into the studio to record their debut album for Sire Records and third studio album to date.\n\nArmor for Sleep has joined forces with renowned producer Ben Grosse (Filter, Marilyn Manson, Vertical Horizon) and will be recording at The Mix Room in Burbank, CA.

That same year, they were chosen as an MTV2 \"Artist To Watch,\" featured on MTV's \"10 Spot Drop,\" and were a headlining act on the Warped Tour. The accolades led to Jorgensen appearing with others on the cover of Alternative Press' Warped Tour issue. They also became the #1 most viewed band on MTV.com's A to Z pages, and stayed #1 on MTVU.com for five consecutive weeks. The band also won FUSE TV's Oven Fresh Battle with videos for \"Car Underwater\" and \"Truth About Heaven.\"\n\nArmor for Sleep will be recording in Burbank into 2007 and are available for \"In The Studio\" features.

Nonetheless, online buying at work still accounts for as many e-commerce dollars as buying from home. This could... (reflect) consumers' valuing of the workplace as the location where they're able to confidentially buy gifts online for immediate family members.\"\n\nKnott's Berry Farm Rings in New Year with Heavenly Sounds at Praise 2007\n\nWorld Class Thrill Rides Combined with First Rate Entertainment and Spectacular Fireworks Adds up to a Fantastic New Year's Party\n\nDec. 18, 2006 Knott's Berry Farm jumps into the New Year with a special ticket contemporary Christian entertainment celebration including top musical headliners performing throughout the theme park.\n\nPraise 2007 combines a night of famous Knott's attractions such as Silver Bullet and GhostRider with the biggest names in contemporary Christian music.

The music was engineered in a digital studio in Hollywood. If the past is any indication of the future, there should be a few million iPods with animal sounds popping out of the earphones. That's music to anyone at Apple Computers' ears.\n\nThe dogs were their own worst critics. They knocked over lamps, chewed on the microphones and took liberties with the carpeting. Like any rock and roll bad boys, they smashed instruments, knocked over tables, threw food and chased females.\n\nIt's a wonder the album got finished. The best thing about this album is the variety of dog barks. The music is fun for the whole family. It is a wonderfully creative album. Early reviews have been enormously positive.\n\nThe Jingle Dogs last album was a smash hit when it was released in 1995. Now, the dogs are back, after several backup stints with the Jingle Cats on Meowy Christmas (1993), Here Comes Santa Claws (1994), and Rhythm and Mews (1995).\n\nThe next project for the Jingle pets is a comedy movie with the working title, \"Jingle Cats Movie,\" which is in development.\n\nJust when you thought the holidays couldn't get any kitschier, Mike Spalla and his world famous \"Jingle Cats\" are at it again. Spalla has been busy this year working on the new addition to the holiday tradition of cats meowing your favorite holiday tunes, and will release the new \"Jingle Dogs\" album this Christmas day.\n\nSo far, two million \"Jingle Cats\" albums have been sold worldwide, with the United States leading the consumption followed by Japan, Canada, Germany and Sweden.\n\nSince December of 2004, consumers have downloaded over 78,000 \"Jingle Cats\" and \"Jingle Dogs\" songs from the iTunes website.\n\n\"Somebody called me up and wanted a recording of Jingle Bells and I didn't have one, and so I came into my studio to record it ... and I brought my cat with me. I was working on it for about an hour and my cat disappeared. He started meowing at me through the glass window and what I was hearing were meows that were perfectly in tune with the music. I looked over at him, I hit the record button, and I started waving at the cat and every time I waved, he would meow. So I tried waving in time with the music. I ended up with a rough take of Jingle Bells sung by my cat. I later overdubbed nine cats onto the track. Some people thought it was funny. I won a free camera from KIIS FM in Hollywood. People were asking me when the album was coming out. I had some funny friends that saw the humor in the 'project.' They kept insisting that I make an album of cats singing Holiday favorites. So eventually I was talked into it. I put together a little cassette tape that was 25 minutes long. It really was only about 7 minutes of music and a lot of repeating, so I was looping the music,\" said Spalla.\n\nThat album turned into the 1993 release, Jingle Cats \"Meowy Christmas\" which is now the original release by the Jingle Cats.\n\nThe Jingle Dogs new album will be released as a download first on December 25, 2006 from www.jinglecats.com, the CD will be released on January 1, 2007, and the songs will hit iTunes and other download services within 2-4 weeks.\n\nSource: Jingle Cats Music\n\nGrey's Anatomy, The O.C., Criminal Minds and More: Autodesk Solutions Spice Up 2006-2007 Television Lineup\n\nDec. 18 From sizzling dramas to science fiction adventures, Autodesk, Inc.

In passing the industry record, which Sony set in 2002, the studio caps an extraordinary year in which SPE released a record-breaking 13 #1 films. The studio also launched 13 films to opening weekends of more than $20 M, another industry record, and surpassed more than $3 billion in global ticket sales for the first time. Sony Pictures now holds the top two years in the all-time domestic box office record books.\n\nCommenting on the achievement, Blake said, \"We've set a bar that will be challenging for us - or any studio - to top; this has been an enormous year by anyone's definition. We successfully launched our animation division and we handled nearly every genre of movie, from broad comedies to family films, emotional dramas to event tentpoles. This kind of year is only possible when everyone is working at the top of their game, and our filmmakers really delivered exceptional product this year.\"\n\nIn addition to crediting the actors, producers and filmmakers behind Sony's 2006 slate of 27 motion pictures, Blake said, \"This year is a true testament to the hard work and dedication of the studio's production, marketing, and distribution teams who break their backs to bring it home year after year. But particular credit is deserved by our presidents of production Doug Belgrad and Matt Tolmach, president of marketing Valerie Van Galder, our president of creative advertising Josh Goldstine, our president of domestic distribution Rory Bruer, and the leadership of Michael Lynton. Of course, none of this dream slate comes together without Amy Pascal, who has been one of the most successful studio leaders in the history of our company.\"\n\n2006 marks the third time in the past five years that SPE has been #1 studio in domestic market share.

Sherry has earned enormous respect throughout the industry not only for her successful career as a producer and studio head, but because she has never failed to further devote her enormous energy to the needs of others.”\n\nLansing helped Dr. Armand Hammer form the nonprofit organization Stop Cancer and serves on its board.
