        "text": "Nia Long's infectious smile has been melting the hearts of fans since she first appeared in \"Boyz n the Hood\" and \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" in the early '90s. Over the course of those three decades, it's only fair that people have been curious about the megastar's love life. While much of her dating history took place before social media and internet coverage, her longtime romance with Ime Udoka made headlines this past September for an unfortunate reason.\n\nAmid their 12-year relationship, ESPN reported that Udoka had engaged in an intimate relationship with a woman Boston Celtics staff member while he was serving as head coach. Shortly after, the NBA team announced that they had suspended Udoka, citing \"violations of team policies.\"\n\nAfter the news made headlines, Udoka expressed his regret in a statement to ESPN's Malika Andrews, saying, \"I want to apologize to our players, fans, the entire Celtics organization, and my family for letting them down. I am sorry for putting the team in this difficult situation, and I accept the team's decision. Out of respect for everyone involved, I will have no further comment.\"\n\nUdoka and Long have one child together, a son named Kez Sunday Udoka, who was born in 2011. On Dec. 6, Long's rep confirmed to POPSUGAR that she and Udoka had split. In a separate statement to People, Long's rep added that she and Udoka are \"no longer together but remain fully committed to co-parenting their son [Kez].\"\n\nIn addition to Udoka, Long has dated other public figures over the years. Keep reading for a look at the actor's dating history."
