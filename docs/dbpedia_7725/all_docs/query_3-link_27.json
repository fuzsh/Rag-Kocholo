        "text": "Abigail Levine is a choreographer and writer working in New York City. Rooted in dance, but moving across media—performance, text, drawing, sound—Levine’s work explores the poetics of our bodily work, how we record and value it. Her multi-year commissions, Redactions (Chocolate Factory Theater, 2022) and Restagings (Fridman Gallery, 2017-2019) have been supported by fellowships and residencies at MacDowell, Bogliasco Foundation, Atlantic Center for the Arts, Los Angeles Performance Practice, Target Margin Theater, and Center for Performance Research, and project and emergency grants from Foundation for Contemporary Arts and New Music USA. Levine collaborated with pioneering electronics composer Alvin Lucier on a staging of his Orpheus Variations (ISSUE Project Room, 2020) and performed with both Marina Abramovic and Yvonne Rainer in their retrospectives at the Museum of Modern Art. Levine’s critical writing has been published in Documents in Contemporary Art, Art21, Women & Performance, Performance Art Journal (PAJ), and her creative works in Interim Poetics, La Vague Journal, and Imagined Theatres. Levine has taught in the Dance Departments at Wesleyan University and Florida State University and is currently on faculty at The New School and University of Texas at Austin’s UTNY program. She is a contributing editor to the Movement Research Performance Journal. Her latest work, Six Quiet Dogs, will premier in late 2024.\n\nwww.abigaillevine.com\n\nBRAT (She/Her/Hers) is a pro choreographer/dancer with Grenadian-Nevisian roots living in NYC. Traveling to the West Indies and back again, she developed a love for dance from Carnival and family fetes. Realizing that she had been bitten by the dancing bug, BRAT's mother enrolled her in Harlem School of the Arts and other after school programs. Eventually, BRAT landed a scholarship to Dance Theater of Harlem's Community Program where she realized she wanted to be a dancer.\n\nThis love led her to attend Columbia College Chicago which helped her evolve greatly as a dancer.There she added more color to her movement palate by studying techniques like Bhyrata Natyam, Contact Improvisation, Capoeira, Popping, and Aerial Dance. While living in Chicago, she was homesick and wanted to connect with her West Indian roots. This longing eventually led BRAT to enter the Midwest Dancehall Queen Competition. She won.\n\nThis victory gave her the opportunity to compete in the International Dancehall Queen competition. Doors were opened afterwards such as choreographing and/or performing at BAM, Performa 19, Nasty Woman Art Exhibit, The Shed, VOGUE, Target, Coachella, VMAS, and The US Open. It also allowed BRAT the fortune of co-founding her dance crew, Queen Moves, which connects and empowers women through dance and starting her dance apparel line that focuses on the financial empowerment of dancers. BRAT communicates with the world through dance and she is forever grateful for this language.\n\nhttp://www.dhqbrat.com\n\nChristopher “Unpezverde” Núñez is a Visually Impaired choreographer based in NYC.
