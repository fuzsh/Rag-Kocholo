        "text": "76 JULY-AUGUST 2022 | THE FOREIGN SERVICE JOURNAL n John K. Menzies, 73, a retired Senior Foreign Service officer and former ambas- sador, passed away suddenly onMarch 26, 2022, inMorristown, N.J. Mr. Menzies was born in 1948 in Pittsfield, Ill., to Pastor James Menzies and Iridell Fisher. Though he grew up humbly with limitedmeans in the Midwest, his parents instilled in him a profound sense of duty and service. He earned his B.A. andM.A. in German from the University of Arkansas, Fayette- ville, and his doctorate degree in German from the University of California, Berkeley. In 1982 Mr. Menzies began his career with the State Department. He had assign- ments in Hungary, Austria, East Germany and Bulgaria, where he was a co-founder of the American University of Bulgaria in Blagoevgrad in 1991. Mr. Menzies arrived in Sarajevo as deputy chief of mission in 1994. Later that year, he received AFSAâs WilliamA. Rivkin Award, along with 13 other Foreign Service officers, for âdisplaying integrity and constructive dissent in developing and advocating alternative policy views on the difficult issue of Bosnia.âThey had expressed deep concerns about the effi- cacy of U.S. policy toward that country and promoted a more activist route. The award citation said the group âcou- rageously carried their challenge to exist- ing policy to successively higher levels, including the Secretary of State [Warren Christopher]. Their proposals ultimately were adopted in part, and their principled arguments are still part of the continuing debate over U.S. policy toward Bosnia.â He was appointed ambassador to Bos- nia and Herzegovina from 1995 to 1996, and served again as ambassador, this time in Kosovo, from 2001 to 2002. He worked in various roles within the State Department and the U.S. mission to the United Nations in New York. After he retired from the Foreign Service in 2002, Amb. Menzies pursued an academic career and became the president of Graceland University in Lamoni, Iowa. He became dean of the John C. Whitehead School of Diplomacy and International Relations at Seton Hall in 2007 and served until 2013. From 2012 to 2015, he was on the American University in Bulgaria board and served as a university council member. Later on, he became president of the American University of Kurdistan and then vice president for international relations at the American University of IraqâBaghdad from 2018 to 2021. Ambassador Menzies is survived by daughters, Lauren, Alexandra andMorgan; a granddaughter, Dylan; and a brother, Jim. n Katherine Radosh, 84, a retired Senior Foreign Service officer, passed away in Jacksonville, Fla., onMarch 11, 2022, after a decade-long struggle withmyelo- dysplastic syndrome. Ms. Radosh was born on Sept. 20, 1937, in the Bronx borough of New York City, to Edmund and Catherine Koenig. She grew upmostly in New Jersey and California, often relocating because of her fatherâs work with the Army Signal Corps. After graduating with a B.A. from the University of Chicago in 1957, Ms. Radosh was accepted into a Navy training program in computer programming. Thus began her career working for the Navy and the Defense Intelligence Agency. During theThanksgiving holiday of 1959, she met 1st Lt. Burnett Radosh on a train returning toWashington, D.C., from New York. By January they were engaged, and the couple married onMarch 26, 1960. Six months after the birth of their first child, Alaric, in 1961, the Radoshes moved to France on the USNS Patch , a troop ship. In France, while her husband pursued his military career, Ms. Radosh gave birth to a second son, Jeremy, in 1962. She also worked as a substitute teacher in U.S. Army elementary schools. The Radosh family lived in Bussac, Poitiers and Orleans. After two years in France, the fam- ily moved back to the States. WhenMr. Radosh embarked on his first of two Army tours in Vietnam, Ms. Radosh returned with the boys to Northern Virginia. She worked for the State Department writ- ing essential programs that were run on State mainframe computers. Her sons remember her being called back to work in the middle of the night on occasion to fix computer problems. In 1976 she sponsored an extended family of Lao and Vietnamese refugees who lived with the Radosh family for half a year. The family remained good friends withMs. Radosh throughout her life. Ms. Radosh went on to obtain a mas- terâs degree fromAmerican University, and she and her husband took up sailing, beginning their education with the Navy Sailing Association Annapolis Chapter. WhenMr. Radosh retired from the mili- tary and Alaric and Jeremy graduated from high school, Ms. Radosh switched from Stateâs Civil Service to the Foreign Service. She flourished in four assignments: Jeddah (1980-1983), Bangkok (1983-1984), Port au Prince (1984-1986) and Tokyo (1986-1988), accompanied by Mr. Radosh. She was eventually promoted into the Senior Foreign Service before retiring in 1990 to help care for her ailing mother and in-laws. Together with her husband, she joined the Coast Guard Auxiliary and was an award-winning editor and publisher of her flotillaâs newsletter and an adept helms- man or crewmember on patrols, retiring after 15 years of service. In their catamaran, Nerissa , the Radoshes sailed from South Florida\n\nRkJQdWJsaXNoZXIy ODIyMDU="
