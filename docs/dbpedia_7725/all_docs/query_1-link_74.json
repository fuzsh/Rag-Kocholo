        "text": "Cam’Ron is still waiting for a response back from Nia Long.\n\nThe rapper and sports commentary previously sent actress Nia Long a pretty lengthy DM, shooting his shot. “Hey stink,” the 47-year-old began the message. “I Was giving you some time to yourself till I reached out. Your perseverance as a strong black woman through this turbulent time has been something to behold. You shouldn’t be taken advantage of and exploited as you did nothing to deserve this. Especially all over these sports networks. You’re bigger and better then that. You’re a queen, and by the way l’m a king. Together we can achieve the greatness we were both destine for as a couple.”\n\nThe DM continued, “(Une Vie a Vivre) that means ‘we have one life to live’ pardon my French lol. As I sit here sipping gazpacho and watching ‘the best man’ I was inspired to reach out, because that’s what I am the best man for you!! Hope to hear from you soon my Mi- amour or should I say ‘Ni-amour.’ I leave you with this ‘the most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely technical.’ Until the next time the sun rises and moon.”\n\nCam sends the DM shortly after Nia Long and Ime Udoka called it quits last year."
