        "text": "By Lily Robinson –\n\nEvery year, around 50,000 runners participate in the largest marathon in the world, the TCS New York City Marathon. This Sunday, November 5, we are honored to have some members of the HeartShare family represent us in one of the most significant sporting events in the city by raising funds and awareness for our mission and services.\n\nYou can track all our runners using the official TCS New York City Marathon App. Follow our runners on their five-borough journey, or join us in cheering them on at our various HearShare Cheer Zones throughout the city.\n\nHEARTSHARE CHEER ZONES\n\nSunset Park Brooklyn @ 11:00 am\n\nYaffa Cafe Fourth Avenue between 45th & 44th Streets\n\nPark Slope Brooklyn @ 11:30 am\n\nPEP Bakehouse and Coffee Shop on Fourth Avenue between 18th and 17th Streets\n\nManhattan NY @ 2pm\n\nFinnegan’s Wake on First Avenue and 73rd Street\n\nMeet Team HeartShare!\n\nSusan Packer- BIB#59406\n\nWestport, Pennsylvania\n\nRunning for: Heartshare Human Services\n\nHow long have you been running?\n\nI grew up in a small town and come from a family of ten children. My father worked for the railroad and is a veteran of WWII and the Korean War. My mother was the daughter of a local farmer, and she was a stay-at-home mom. We grew up with a great love for people and our country. My parents noticed when I was two that I was not speaking or hearing, and it was then that I was diagnosed with a profound hearing loss. I would need services in the classroom and eventually would have surgeries to attempt to restore some, but to this day, I wear blue-toothed hearing devices to communicate effectively and be able to work and live normally as I can.\n\nI began running at 16 years old with my father and developed a love for running but never competed, and I continue to this day, 44 years later !!!\n\nHow many times have you run the NYC marathon?\n\nThis will be my first time running the NYC Marathon , I had the privilege of taking care of a patient who came to the facility where I worked his name Anthony Amatrudo from Queens New York and he was battling colon cancer and he had shared with me that he ran the NYC marathon twice, we decided to raise money for our rehab center and I had suggested a 5 K and with Anthony as my ambassador we raised over 4,000. He was amazing and always encouraged me to enter the marathon and said I will see New York like no other, he loved the marathon and he loved New York. See picture of Anthony crossing the finish line!\n\nTell us why you run for HeartShare NYC.\n\nI am so grateful to run for HeartShare because I can relate to disabilities. I live with challenges related to my hearing, but with technology, I can live normally and still continue to work as RN. I want to run and represent HeartShare and will continue to support it long after the Marathon. I am excited to be able to have this amazing opportunity and feel blessed beyond measure, and I am grateful to Team HeartShare.\n\nWhat are you going to eat post-marathon run?\n\nMy son grew up with a love for running. He’s a veteran of the IRAQ war and is a PSP in Gettysburg, PA. He will be running for the Liver Foundation and running with me!
