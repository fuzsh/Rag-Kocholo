        "text": "Boston Celtics head coach Ime Udoka cheated on actress Nia Long and the organization tried to sweep the scandal under the rug by suspending him for one year.\n\nLittle did they know, however, that hip-hop's obsession with Nia Long dates back to the '90s, so the community won't be able to easily forgive Udoka for his transgression.\n\nLong, 51, has been mentioned by name in multiple hip-hop songs over the years, including by artists such as Kanye West, Lil Wayne, A$AP Ferg and J. Cole.\n\nKnown for her roles on Boyz N The Hood, Friday and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Long once explained to Larry King why the hip-hop community loves her so dearly.\n\n\"I think the thing with me and hip hop music...here's the deal,\" Long said. \"I grew up in a time where, you know, Puffy Combs was, you know, running nightclubs in New York City and Boyz N The Hood was out and Heavy D (my beloved brother, who I miss madly).\n\n\"You had Biggie Smalls, you had Tupac....so, this was an era where we were all sort of growing up in this business and kind of, changed the game a little bit. And gave urban music, rap music, Black films....we had a space to actually do our thing and I think that the rappers just kind of are feeling Nia Long a little bit. I think it's just kind of part of the acknowledgement .\"\n\nJ. Cole was not too young for Nia Long\n\nOne of the most memorable lines regarding Long was on \"No Role Modelz\" by J. Cole, where he says that his only regret is that he was too young to date her.\n\nSpeaking with King, Long revealed that Cole was, in fact, not too young for her, but that he didn't know it, yet.\n\n\"He's really not too young, he just doesn't know it,\" Long said.\n\nUdoka, 45, will surely come to rue the day he cheated on Long with a married woman.\n\nCheck out some of the greatest bars written about Nia Long, which by the way, most talk about how she's the ideal woman.\n\nBest hip-hop lyrics mentioning Nia Long\n\n\"The relationship was short and sweet, Nia Long.\" - Lil Wayne [Novocane]\n\n\"Short hair like Nia Long.\" - Juicy J [Bandz a Make Her Dance]\n\n\"My only regret was too young for Nia Long.\" - J. Cole [No Role Modelz]\n\n\"Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long.\" - Kanye West [Touch the Sky]\n\n\"Pretty b---h like Nia Long.\" - A$AP Ferg [Nia Long]\n\n\"Trini-born lad like Nia Long's grandmother.\" - A Tribe Called Quest [Steve Biko (Stir It Up)]\n\n\"Puffin' on strong, getting gold, bad b----es. Looking like Nia Long I mean it.\" - Meek Mill [I'm Leanin']\n\n\"I need something like Nia Long make you wanna bring her home.\" - Webbie [Like That]"
