        "text": "Jay-Z and Nia Long, photographed at T.I.’s 25th birthday party at Mr. Chow in Midtown, New York City on September 22, 2005.\n\nIn an interview with Essence in 2012 Long recalled a conversation between her and Hov: “I saw him at a party and I complimented him on his long run in music. But he turned it around and asked me: ‘How does it feel to be every boy from the hood’s fantasy girlfriend for 20 years?’ It made me laugh, I hadn’t really thought about it.”"
