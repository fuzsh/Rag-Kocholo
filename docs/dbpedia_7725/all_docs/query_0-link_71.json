        "text": "NEW YORK — Nia Long’s next big role is as the family matriarch in the Michael Jackson biopic, “Michael.”\n\nThe Brooklyn-born beauty, known for roles in Black cinema classics such as “Boyz n the Hood” and “Love Jones,” has been tapped to play Katherine Jackson in the upcoming film.\n\nHelmed by “Training Day” director Antoine Fuqua and starring Michael’s nephew Jaafar Jackson, “Michael” is expected to hit theaters in April 2025.\n\nKatherine Jackson, 93, and late talent manager Joe Jackson were the parents of 10 children who made music the family business.\n\n“Katherine Jackson is an incredible pillar of strength and grace for the entire Jackson family,” Long, 53, said in a statement. “As a mother, she was selfless and endured forces beyond her control yet still managed to help build a legacy beyond measure. I am honored to bring her voice to the screen and share Michael Jackson’s story with audiences everywhere.”\n\nFuqua said Tuesday that he’s been a longtime fan of Long’s work and described Katherine as “a woman who was the glue, the rock, and the heart of the Jackson family during its best and its most turbulent times.”\n\nProduction on the film, which has been described as “an in-depth portrayal of a complicated man who became the King of Pop,” began on Jan. 22.\n\nLionsgate and Universal announced last week that actor Colman Domingo will portray Joe Jackson in the film."
