She is set to portray the matriarch of the Jackson family, Katherine Jackson in the upcoming Michael Jackson biopic.\n\nThe movie’s producer Graham King spoke on having Long on board for the film. “Beyond Nia’s incredible talent, I was deeply moved by her connection to the material and her commitment to honoring Katherine and the love she had for her son.”\n\nDirector Antoine Fuqua added, “Nia has delivered iconic performances throughout her career. I’ve been a fan for a long time because her characters stay with you. I’m excited to now work alongside her as she pours all of that into Katherine Jackson: a woman who was the glue, the rock, and the heart of the Jackson family during its best and its most turbulent times.”\n\nNia Long also spoke on her new role, “Katherine Jackson is an incredible pillar of strength and grace for the entire Jackson family. As a mother, she was selfless and endured forces beyond her control yet still managed to help build a legacy beyond measure. I am honored to bring her voice to the screen and share Michael Jackson’s story with audiences everywhere.”\n\nThe award-winning actress will star alongside Michael Jackson’s nephew, Jaafar Jackson, who will play his famous uncle, Colman Domingo, who will play the role of Jackson’s father, Joe Jackson.\n\nThe movie is set to premiere on April 18, 2025."
