        "text": "Nia Long (1970- ) is an American television and film actress. She is best known as the female lead in “Love Jones” (1997) and as Will Smith’s girlfriend in the “The Fresh Prince of Bel Air”. She was also the youngest sister in “Soul Food” (1997). She now appears on television in “Big Shots” (2007).\n\nNia Long often appears as the female lead in black films, but only as a supporting character in white films. For example, she was the female lead opposite Ice Cube in “Are We There Yet?” (2005), but in “Premonition” (2007) she was Sandra Bullock’s Black Best Friend.\n\nSo while Nia Long is well known among blacks in America she is largely unknown among whites.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of a high school English teacher from Trinidad, she was named “Nitara” after one of the seven days of Kwanzaa. Her name means “life purpose”.\n\nHer parents divorced when she was two. When she was four her mother moved to Iowa in the middle of the country, where she studied printmaking. Nia was the only black at her school. She soon found out what this meant when a boy pushed her off her bicycle and called her “nigger”.\n\nWhen Nia was seven her mother followed her boyfriend to Los Angeles. They moved to South Central, not far from where “Boyz n the Hood” would later be filmed. Her mother drove a city bus and taught art. Nia’s first boyfriend was killed in a crack deal gone bad.\n\nShe studied acting under Betty Bridges, the mother of child actor Todd Bridges of “Diff’rent Strokes”. Nia Long first became known when she played Cuba Gooding’s girlfriend in “Boyz n the Hood” (1991). She was the one who was trying to do her homework despite the sound of gunfire.\n\nFrom 1992 to 1994 she was on the soap opera “Guiding Light”. It was in New York so she got to see her father again. She did not play a female character but a white person’s idea of a black woman. She had to rewrite her lines because they sounded so corny, as she put it.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1995 she played Will Smith’s girlfriend in the television show “The Fresh Prince of Bel Air”. Will Smith saw her talent and gave her the part over Jada Pinkett, his future wife.\n\nIn 1997 she appeared in “Soul Food” and “Love Jones”. They made her name as a film actress.\n\nSince then she has appeared in many other films, like “The Best Man” (1999), “Big Momma’s House” (2000) and “Alfie” (2004). “Are We There Yet?” was not one for the ages, but it did well at the box office.\n\nOn television she has been in “Judging Amy” (2001-2002), “Third Watch” (2003-2005), “Everwood” (2006) and “Boston Legal” (2007), among others.\n\nShe loved “Boston Legal”: she said the writing was “so beautiful and layered, so full of life”. She got to work with actors who “take their craft very seriously”.\n\nSee also:"
