        "text": "Nia Long is best known for being on television shows such as The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Empire, and Third Watch. She was also on a soap. Along with her soap and television career, Long has also been in several movies.\n\nLong starred in iconic films like Boyz n the Hood, Friday, Soul Food, In Too Deep, The Best Man, Big Momma’s House, and Are We There Yet? From where she was born and raised to being featured in rap songs, here are five fast facts about the actress.\n\nWho Is Nia Long?\n\nLong was born on October 30 in Brooklyn, New York. Her parents divorced when she was 2, so she and her mother moved to Iowa City, Iowa. They later moved to Los Angeles when Long was 7. Long attended St. Mary’s Academy and eventually graduated from Westchester High School.\n\nSoap Beginnings\n\nAfter landing a few roles early on, Long was cast as Kathryn “Kat” Speakes on the now-defunct CBS soap Guiding Light. She was on the show for three years before leaving to work on other projects.\n\nTook Jada’s Part\n\nNext, she was cast on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air as Will Smith’s girlfriend and fiancée, Lisa Wilkes. The role almost went to Smith’s eventual wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, but she didn’t get the part because she was too short. Nevertheless, Long got the role and was on the show for 15 episodes.\n\nRapper Muse\n\nLong has been mentioned by name in countless rap songs over the years. Her name has been said in Kanye West’s Touch the Sky, J. Cole’s No Role Modelz, Lil Wayne’s Novacane, Meek Mill’s I’m Leanin’, Juicy J’s Bandz Make Her Dance, and a few others."
