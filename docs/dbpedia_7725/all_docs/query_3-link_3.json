        "text": "Where is Nia Long from? Nia Long is from Brooklyn, New York, where she was born on October 30, 1970. The future TV and film star didn’t remain in NYC long, however, as her mother received a full scholarship to study at the University of Iowa, and the family packed up and moved to Iowa City. They eventually settled in Los Angeles, California, where Nia grew up studying dance and acting. Nia Long made her debut in the 1986 Disney movie “The B.R.A.T. Patrol,” though it wasn’t until 1991’s landmark “Boyz N the Hood” that she really began to earn notice. In the years since, Nia Long has appeared on such TV shows as “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” and “Third Watch,” and on the big screen, she’s turned heads with performances in “The Best Man,” “Boiler Room,” “Alfie,” and “The Best Man Holiday,” among many others.\n\nFans wondering where Nia Long is from may be surprised to learn she hails from Brooklyn, and that she spent time in Iowa City, since she’s largely associated with Los Angeles, where she grew up and now resides. Indeed, Long is an NYC native, even if she only stayed in the BK for a short time. Regardless of where she’s from, Nia Long is a major talent, and over the course of her career, she’s earned three NAACP awards — two for her work on “Third Watch,” one for “The Best Man.” She’s also proved adept at both comedy and drama, and her filmography also includes “Big Momma’s House” and “Big Momma’s House 2.”\n\nNia Long’s hometown of Brooklyn, New York, has certainly produced its share of big-name celebrities, and the borough is also the birthplace of the actresses Marisa Tomei, Edie Falco, and Lorraine Bracco. Long is in good company, even if she didn’t stick around in NYC very long."
