        "text": "What Is Nia Long's Net Worth?\n\nNia Long is an American dancer and actress who has a net worth of $5 million. Nia Long's breakout role came in the critically acclaimed film \"Boyz n the Hood\" (1991), in which she delivered a powerful performance that garnered widespread recognition. This early success set the stage for a series of notable film appearances, including roles in \"Love Jones\" (1997), \"Soul Food\" (1997), and \"The Best Man\" (1999). Long has also enjoyed a successful career in television, with standout roles in popular series such as \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" and \"Empire.\"\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn April 2003, Nia Long bought a home in Los Angeles for an undisclosed amount. She listed this home for sale in March 2021 for $2.985 million but ultimately removed the listing.\n\nDuring her relationship with Ime Udoka, Nia lived at his home in Boston. In the wake of their separation, Nia moved back to Los Angeles, where in December 2022, she paid $3.6 million for a home in the Hollywood Hills.\n\nIme Udoka Divorce Settlement\n\nNia was in a relationship with former NBA star/current coach Ime Udoka from 2011 to 2022. They were engaged at one point but never legally married. They welcomed a son in 2011. They split in 2022 after it was revealed that Udoka had an affair with a colleague within the Celtics organization. In January 2024, a judge ordered Udoka to pay Long $32,500 per month in child support. According to the documents submitted in the case, in the previous year, Ime made $400,000 per month in disposable net income, whereas Nia earned $20,000 per month.\n\nEarly Life\n\nNia Talita Long was born on October 30, 1970, in Brooklyn, New York. Her mother, Talita (née Gillman), was a teacher and printmaker, and her father, Doughtry Long, was a high school teacher as well as a poet. Long has an older half-sister, Sommore (born Lori Ann Rambough), who is also an actress in addition to being a comedian. When Long was two years old, her parents got divorced. She subsequently moved with her mother to Iowa City, Iowa, before moving to South Los Angeles. Her father lived in Trenton, New Jersey. Nia graduated from Westchester High School in Los Angeles in 1989, having also attended the Roman Catholic all-girls high school St. Mary's Academy in Inglewood, California.\n\nCareer\n\nNia Long's first professional acting role was on the Disney Channel, in the television film \"The B.R.A.T.

She followed this up with a three-year contracted role as the character Kathryn \"Kat\" Speakes on the long-running popular soap opera \"Guiding Light\" from 1991 to 1994. This was her first notable role that helped her gain more exposure. During her first year of being on \"Guiding Light,\" Long landed the role of Brandi in the film \"Boyz n the Hood\" (1991). Following her departure from \"Guiding Light,\" Nia played Beulah \"Lisa\" Wilkes, the girlfriend (and later fiancé) of Will Smith's character on the television show \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" from 1994 to 1995.\n\nLong went on to have several small roles on television, appearing in just one or two episodes of shows like \"ER\" (1996) and \"Moesha\" (1996), as well as several unsold TV pilots such as \"Live Shot\" (1995) and \"Black Jaq\" (1998). Her role as Andrea Solomon on the show \"Judging Amy\" was one of the longer ones she enjoyed, appearing in six episodes between 2001 and 2002. Her next notable television role was NYPD Officer Sasha Monroe on the show \"Third Watch,\" which lasted from 2003 to 2005 (when the show ended). Nia followed this up with appearances on shows like \"Everwood\" (2005 – 2006), \"Boston Legal\" (2006 – 2007), and \"Big Shots\" (2007 – 2008). In 2016, Long was cast as the character Giuliana, a club owner in Las Vegas, on the television series \"Empire.\" She appeared on \"Empire\" from 2016 to 2017 in a total of eight episodes.

She has won three Image Awards, twice for Outstanding Actress in a Television Drama (once in 2004 and again in 2005) for \"Third Watch\" and once for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture (in 2000) for \"The Best Man.\" Additionally, she was nominated for the BET Comedy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Theatrical Film for \"Alfie\" in 2005.\n\nPersonal Life"
