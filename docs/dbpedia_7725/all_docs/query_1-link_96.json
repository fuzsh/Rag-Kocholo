        "text": "The upcoming, highly anticipated Michael Jackson biopic has found its Katherine Jackson. Best Man star Nia Long has been cast as the mother of the King of Pop.\n\nShe will be joining the “Billie Jean” singer’s nephew, Jaafar Jackson, who was previously announced to portray his late uncle in the upcoming film, and Oscar nominee Colman Domingo, who is set to play the Jackson family patriarch, Joe Jackson. Nine-year-old actor Juliano Krue Valdi will portray Michael during his formative years in the Jackson 5.\n\nThe film will take on the musician’s life and career and will be produced by Graham King (Bohemian Rhapsody) and John Branca and John McClain, who are the co-executors of the Michael Jackson estate. Titled Michael, the forthcoming biopic will be directed by Antoine Fuqua, the filmmaker behind 2001’s Oscar-winning Training Day and 2022’s Will Smith-starring Emancipation.\n\n“Beyond Nia’s incredible talent, I was deeply moved by her connection to the material and her commitment to honoring Katherine and the love she had for her son,” said King in a press statement.\n\nMichael died on June 25, 2009 at age 50. In a career that spanned almost his entire life, the King of Pop had 13 No. 1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart. He first saw success as part of the family band the Jackson 5, and four of their songs topped the Hot 100.\n\nThe film is currently slated for release in April 2025. The film is now in production."
