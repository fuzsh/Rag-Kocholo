        "text": "Hepatitis C is one such condition that can resolve on its own or may worsen to liver cancer, cirrhosis, or fibrosis (scarring). Speaking of India, viral hepatitis is increasingly recognised as a major public health issue. It poses a significant social and physical burden and affects the afflicted person, their family, and the healthcare system with massive financial obligations.\n\nAccording to recent WHO estimates, 40 million individuals in India have a chronic hepatitis B infection, and 6 to 12 million have a chronic hepatitis C infection. The majority of identified acute liver failures are caused by HEV (Hepatitis E Virus). In line of that, let’s look into some of the necessary tests for hepatitis, the costs associated with it, and some screening guidelines.\n\nWhat is a Hepatitis C antibody test?\n\nHepatitis C is a viral illness/infection in which the liver is severely affected. It can be chronic or acute. Caused by the hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses, this condition can be fatal in extreme cases. The Hepatitis C antibody test is a blood test to determine if an individual has been infected with HCV (Hepatitis C virus).\n\nHepatitis C is mainly spread by close contact with contaminated blood. It can also happen when an individual shares syringes or needles or undergo unsupervised medical practices like blood transfusions. Below is a quick look at how exactly Hepatitis C spreads.\n\nHow does it Spread?\n\nAs stated, the most common way for a person infected with HCV to spread the virus is through direct contact with their blood. Although there may not be enough blood that the human eye can see, the virus does its job. The spreading works in numerous ways, including:\n\nSharing Contaminated Items\n\nSharing syringes or other injection drugs is the most common way for people to get infected with HCV. Sharing personal medical equipment, such as glucose monitors, common items like toothbrushes, razors, and nail clippers can also spread the infection.\n\nBirth\n\nIf an expecting mother is infected with the hepatitis C virus, she must be screened for the virus. This is because the risk of hepatitis C virus infection in infants is about 6%, which is highly preventable, provided that the guidelines are followed.\n\nHealthcare Outbreaks\n\nHealthcare facilities have had certain outbreaks due to inadequate infection control measures.\n\nIntercourse with an HCV Carrier:\n\nAlthough rare, hepatitis C can be transmitted through sexual contact. Men having intercourse with the same sex have the most reported cases of HCV transmission\n\nGetting a Tattoo or Piercing in an Unsupervised Environment\n\nUnlicensed tattoo parlours, informal surroundings, and tools that aren't hygienic increase the risk of hepatitis C transmission during body piercings and tattoos.\n\nHepatitis C Screening Guidelines\n\nAs a standard rule, Hepatitis C screening should be required for all adults (those aged 18-79). In addition, those who are particularly vulnerable should undergo several screenings. Such individuals include:\n\nBabies who were given birth by a woman having hepatitis C\n\nPeople infected with the HIV\n\nAnybody who has ever snorted, inhaled, or injected any illicit drug\n\nIndividuals who underwent organ transplants or received blood before 1992.\n\nThose women who have HCV and are expecting a child\n\nPatients with haemophilia who had clotting factors before 1987\n\nSexual partners of a person who has been diagnosed with hepatitis C\n\nEmergency and health care workers who got into close contact with blood or been pricked by a needle\n\nSexually active men involved with the same gender\n\nIndividuals who have been to a jail/prison\n\nPeople who get abnormal liver tests, where the root cause isn’t detected\n\nThose who have been on hemodialysis for a long time\n\nTips to Prevent Hepatitis C\n\nUnfortunately, a vaccine to prevent Hepatitis C has not yet been developed. The only way to ward off this illness is to refrain from doing certain actions that can trigger the virus and spread it. Some of the potential Hepatitis C protection measures are listed below.\n\nQuit taking illegal drugs/narcotics immediately.\n\nAlways getting tattooed or pierced under professional supervision in a clean and safe environment.\n\nStop sharing syringes, needles, or other drug equipment.\n\nPractising sanitary, hygienic, and top-notch procedures in healthcare facilities.\n\nAvoid donors with HCV infection to get an organ transplant or blood transfusion.\n\nAvoid unprotected sexual activities.\n\nWhy is the Prevention of Hepatitis C Important?\n\nNo matter how fatal, Hepatitis C can be prevented and cured if diagnosed early. Generally, for those with early diagnosis or new infections, the virus will take time to progress to a long-term infection.\n\nNonetheless, it is important to undergo a hepatitis c test to evaluate the status of your health. To begin with the treatment, it is essential to know the type and degree of the infection. Depending on the results, your doctor will recommend you with further diagnosis and medications to reduce the damage. Simply put, although it's curable, without immediate treatment, hepatitis C can lead to liver cancer, liver scarring, and even death.\n\nHepatitis C Treatment\n\nVarious treatment procedures can be used to treat hepatitis C. Generally, it consists of 3 easy methods:\n\nPrescription Drugs\n\nAntiviral Medications\n\nExtensive cases involving liver transplantation\n\nA thorough Hepatitis C treatment cures over 95% of individuals without causing any side effects. In fact, in most cases, patients only need to take the medication (pills) for 8 to 12 weeks, and they can cure the condition.\n\nIn addition, modern medicine has produced direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), a class of antiviral drugs, which are extremely effective. In most cases, these drugs can cure hepatitis C.\n\nHowever, before proceeding with the treatment, you must be aware of your genotype, viral load, and the extent of your liver damage. The hepatitis C medications can eliminate the virus in as many as 70% (7 out of 10) of genotype 1 carriers. 70% to 90% (7-9 out of 10) with genotypes 2 or 3 will see improvement after treatment.\n\nNote that the time required to complete treatment will generally differ from one patient to another and from one healthcare provider to another.\n\nThe choice is challenging for most people, and the treatment isn't easy either. Although the hepatitis c treatment medications have little to no side effects, some people are unable to tolerate the medications and have to stop taking them in the middle of their treatment.\n\nPatients with hepatitis C must talk to their doctor to get a detailed overview of their treatment options so they may choose the one that works best for them.\n\nHow Does Health Insurance Help?\n\nGenerally, hepatitis C treatment is quite costly because it requires multiple tests and drugs. Considering the rising costs of inflation, Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) medicines and the other necessary medications can be highly expensive. Comprehensive care involves regular monitoring through blood tests, liver function tests, and regular screenings, all of which add to the financial burden. Moreover, some cases may require treatment for complications such as cirrhosis or liver cancer, potentially leading to costly hospital stays or even liver transplants.\n\nUnder such circumstances, it is important to have medical insurance. Having health insurance not only helps you to cover the long medical bills but provides peace of mind as well. Moreover, comprehensive health insurance coverage protects your hard-earned savings and offers a financial shield.\n\nCare Health Insurance not only covers the costs associated with hepatitis c treatment and medications but also provides access to a wider range of cashless healthcare providers, thereby ensuring optimal care. Furthermore, Care Health Insurance facilitates preventive measures like screening and early detection, which are crucial for managing HCV effectively.\n\nAlso Read: World Hepatitis Day\n\nTakeaway\n\nSumming up, HCV is a serious medical condition that can cause severe inflammation of the liver and can further lead to liver cancer, organ damage, cirrhosis, and liver failure. Fortunately, hepatitis C can now be cured in the majority of instances with the help of modern medications.\n\nMoreover, while public healthcare in India can provide some level of care, you may want the most effective treatment and management of HCV. Hence, having health insurance becomes a necessity to avail of timely and effective treatment, thereby ensuring better hepatitis C treatment and reducing the financial burden."
