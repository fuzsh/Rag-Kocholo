It’s a 15 digit numeric code. Each customer is having a unique CIF number; two different customers cannot have a common CIF.\n\nThe CIF number can be obtained from the parent branch and call center following some questionnaires. CIF details will also be printed on the pledge which is duly signed by the customer for the Gold Loan product.\n\nYes, the Customer needs to enter the same mobile number which is associated with the CIF number; failing so will not allow the system to generate a complaint.\n\nFor an existing customer, the CIF number is mandatory to register any complaint. It helps us to identify, track and resolve complaints within proper SLA. If somehow the customer is unable to provide the CIF number, then in such cases,he/she can select “Existing customer as NO” and enter the remaining required details. This will also generate the complaint in the system.\n\nCustomers can track the complaint status by using the “Track your Complaints” option which is available on the navigation panel. To know about the Complaint’s status the customer has to provide a valid Case ID.\n\nIf a customer is not happy with the resolution in such cases, he/she can contact Grievance Redressal team using the appropriate option available under customer service module. But for this, prior complaints must be closed by the assigned user/executive.\n\nIf the customer is not happy with the resolution provided by the Grievance team, then in such cases, the customer can contact Principal Nodal Officer using the appropriate options available under the customer service module.\n\nYes, the Customer needs to enter the same mobile number which is associated with the CIF number; failing to do so will not allow the system to generate a complaint."
