        "text": "By Mahlia Lone\n\nTalk about a perfect lifeâ€”Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively are blond, beautiful, famous and successful movie stars, with two lovely daughters and a picture perfect house. They live an idyllic life full of sweetness, sunshine and smiles. Everything is a choice and, according to Ryan, this is a life that Blake has created for her family. Let’s see how she is achieving her dream\n\nBorn Blake Ellender Brown in 1987 in Tarzana, Los Angeles to Ernie Lively (nÃ© Ernest Wilson Brown, Jr.) an actor, and his wife, Elaine, the good looking actress has an older brother, Eric, and half-siblings, Lori, Robyn and Jason, all of whom work in the entertainment industry. A beautiful child of English, Irish, German and a trace of Cherokee ancestry, she was cherubic with lovely golden ringlets. Her parents took her with them to acting classes that they taught instead of leaving her with a babysitter, where Blake said she picked up the â€œdrillsâ€ of acting and gained confidence. At only 10 years of age, she appeared in the film Sandman (1998) directed by her father. Since showbiz was a family business, Blake was not particularly enamored by it and dreamt of attending Stanford University. Teenaged Blake had a crush on fellow child star Kelly Blatz with whom she was childhood pals. Lively said that when they started filming the teen horror flick Simon Says in 2004, â€œhe finally came aroundâ€ and the two started dating. He was her first boyfriend.\n\nDuring the summer between Blakeâ€™s junior and senior years at Burbank High School, her brother Eric asked his agent to send Blake on auditions, which is how she was cast in the coming of age movie The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005) alongside Amber Tamblyn, Alexis Bledel and America Ferrera. Blake caught the eye in the film and was nominated for a Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Breakout â€“ Female. Back in school, she became the senior class president, a cheerleader, and a member of the championship choir.\n\nIt was when she was cast as the poor little rich girl Serena van der Woodsen in the hit teen series Gossip Girl based on the bestseller book series by Cecily von Ziegesar that Lively became a household name the world over. The mega successful show ran from 2007 till 2012. During the summer hiatus of 2008, Blake reprised her role in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 and by this time she had become fast friends with the actresses.\n\nâ€œI donâ€™t want to date someone just to date someone,â€ Lively said in an interview for Cosmopolitan magazine that year. â€œI want to be with a guy whoâ€™s going to better my quality of life, better me.â€ She outed her relationship with her GG costar Penn Badgley at the 2008 Met Gala and continued seeing him for the next three years.\n\nVery close to her family, Blake said that on holidays, like Christmas Day, all the siblings would stay in bed together. â€œSomehow we just spend seven hours a day all together just chatting and itâ€™s really nice to have that time, because itâ€™s rare that we get together for such a nice chunk of time. We never leave the house. Weâ€™re together all day whether weâ€™re making gingerbread houses, or baking cookies, or sitting around and watching movies all piled up.â€\n\nInordinately fond of food and cooking, Blake called Martha Stewart her â€œidolâ€ as well as being a fan of Nigella Lawson, a TV chef. Lively spent evenings working as a pastry chef at the renowned Per Se in New York City and took cookery classes wherever she travelled as a way of immersing herself in the local culture, including a tailor-made workshop at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris. Her ambition was to become a restaurateur and also â€œhoped one day to have an interior decorating company,â€ due to her love of â€œantiques, colours and textures and layering things.â€ Even though her GG role that she became synonymous with was of a spoilt rich girl, she was actually much more family oriented and more interested in perfecting her domestic arts rather than painting the town red like other celebrities her age. After GG ended, Blake was cast in the superhero movie Green Lantern starring Hollywood heartthrob Ryan Reynolds.\n\nRyan Rodney Reynolds was born in 1976, in Vancouver, British Columbia the youngest of four brothers to James Chester â€œJimâ€ Reynolds, a food wholesaler, and Tammy, a sales assistant. The handsome blond actor is of Irish descent and was raised a Roman Catholic. His older brother became police officers, while Ryan began his showbiz career with a stint in 1991 in the Canadian teen soap Hillside. He graduated from Kitsilano Secondary School in 1994, but dropped out of Kwantlen Polytechnic University in 1996 and moved to Hollywood. His breakout role was in the hit show Sabrina the Teenage Witch with teen queen Melissa Joan Hart.\n\nReynoldsâ€™ next big role came in the sitcom Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place (1998-2001). He had a relationship with the showâ€™s star Traylor Howard for two years even though she was a decade older than him; then he moved on to Kristen Johnston, also a TV star nearly a decade older; till he finally started dating Rachael Leigh Cook, an actress closer to his own age.\n\nRyan made the jump to the big screen in the hit National Lampoon comedy Van Wilder (2002). At the same time, he started his first serious relationship with popular Canadian singer/songwriter Alanis Morisette. The couple spent five years together from 2002 to 2007 and the two were even engaged for the three last years. Morrisette wrote songs about her heartbreak after their breakup on her album Flavors of Entanglement, especially the track Torch that was all about her former fiancÃ©. During this relationship, Reynolds, known mostly for his comedic roles till now, expanded his acting range. He built up his body for an action role in the 2004 film Blade: Trinity. And in George Lutzâ€™s 2005 remake of the 1979 horror film The Amityville Horror, Reynolds traversed the horror genre as well. Continuing to play against type, he played an FBI agent alongside Ray Liotta in the 2006 crime action film Smokinâ€™ Aces, and in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) he worked in a superhero film.\n\nâ€œIâ€™ve had four boyfriends in my whole life. Iâ€™ve never been with anyone thatâ€™s not a boyfriend. If I spend time with a man, itâ€™s because thereâ€™s somebody that I know well who has been a friend for a whileâ€\n\nâ€”Blake lively\n\nIn 2008, Ryan married sex symbol Scarlett Johanssen, his girlfriend for a year, but the marriage only lasted for three years with Scarlett calling it quits citing her monogamy issues and hinting at his insecurity with her success. In the meantime, Reynolds had a big summer hit in The Proposal (2009) opposite established box office star Sandra Bullock. Not only did he effortlessly hold his own against the senior actress, but their on screen chemistry was hot, and the two ended up having a flingÂ after his marriage had irrrvocably broken down.\n\nWhen the movieâ€™s stars Lively and Reynolds made their debut as Green Lantern costars at 2010 Comic-Con at the San Diego Convention Center, he was still married to Scarlett, and she was still dating Badgley, but they had clearly established a good rapport with each other. With Green Lantern Reynolds was expected to become an A-list leading man but when the $200 million superhero movie hit theatres, it was a disappointment for critics and audiences alike. It just barely broke even. By the end of the year, the two stars were both single. During next yearâ€™s WonderCon press conference the two stars were seen giggling and enjoying each otherâ€™s company, but they were only friends at this time. Ryan told Details, â€œIâ€™m very happy not to be in a relationship right now. Thatâ€™s okay. I didnâ€™t plan on it, thatâ€™s for sure . . . but thatâ€™s okay. Iâ€™ve been in relationships pretty much since high schoolâ€¦.Some people look at that as a good thing. I think wiser people might see that as a house of cardsâ€¦.Anyone that gets divorced goes through a lot of pain, but you come out of itâ€¦.Iâ€™m not out of it yet. At all.â€\n\nMen usually seek solace when experiencing pain in the arms of the next willing woman and Reynolds followed up his fling with Sandra with two more flings that year, one with German model Agnes Fischer and the next South African glamazon star Charlize Theron as salve to his ego and pain.\n\nMeanwhile, Lively was concentrating on her career and snagged a lucrative and high profile campaign as the face of the new Gucci fragrance, Gucci Premiere. And she was the arm candy of none other than Leonardo DiCaprio who squired her around the South of France during the summer of 2011. But he is not one to settle down or even stay with any one woman for long, regardless of how good looking or sweet she may be.\n\nBack Stateside, Reynolds and Lively started spending more time together.Â He later reminisced on Entertainment Weeklyâ€™s SiriusXM show, â€œWe were buddies then. I remember it was funny because for about a year after Green Lantern had come and gone and all that stuff we were both single,â€ he said. â€œWe went on a double date. She was on a date with another guy and I was on a date with another girl. That was the most awkward date for their respective probably because we were just like fireworks coming across (laughing). It was weird at first but we were buddies for a long time. I think itâ€™s the best way to have a relationship is to start as friends.â€\n\nSoon rumors were rife that the Green Lantern costarsâ€™ were hooking up after they were seen at multiple spots together fall of 2011, and she was photographed leaving his Boston apartment early one morning. In a later interview with GQ magazine, he said, â€œI mean, I always imagined that would happen, and then it happened. Every idiotic Hallmark-card clichÃ© is true.â€ Ryan said he knew Blake was â€œThe Oneâ€ not when they first met but after they had sex on their first date. Ryan explained that he asked the actress to dance in an empty restaurant, on a really late evening in Tribeca and knew instantly. He said: â€˜It was just one of those moments where halfway through the dance, it was like, â€˜Oh, I think I just crossed a line.â€™ And then I walked her home. And, uh, you know, I donâ€™t really need to go into what happened after that.â€\n\nSpeaking about the same date to Entertainment Weekly, Blake said: â€œThat date went well for him. I donâ€™t know about fireworks for me. No, we were such good friends for so long and we both got to know each other as friends so when we were both single, we were still trying to find each otherâ€™s perfect dateâ€”â€˜Oh, who would be good for you?â€™\n\nFirst day on the set of Green Lantern, Blake arrived with a batch of freshly baked cupcakes that Ryan devoured\n\nWeâ€™d sit around being like, â€˜Oh jeez, do you know anyone?â€™ And it didnâ€™t click for, I mean, a good year and a half. Like, â€˜Oh hey, wait, hold on. We could date!â€™â€\n\nLively paid him a visit him on the set of his movie R.I.P.D., a 3D supernatural action comedy film starring Jeff Bridges, in Boston on his birthday in October with a big bouquet of balloons tied to her dog Baxter as a cute surprise. Soon they became inseparable; the new couple spent the Christmas holidays with Reynoldsâ€™ family in Vancouver where they were spotted holding hands while walking through the Granville Island Public Market. In January 2012, they were seen going for an incognito stroll in New Orleans, La. In the summer, they were back in British Columbia, visiting the Ferry Terminal in Nanaimo.\n\nReynold’s back to back flings after his marraige disentigrated\n\nâ€œThey are very much in love,â€ a source close to the couple reportedly told press. â€œThey rarely travel without one another.â€\n\nâ€œIâ€™ve been with very few people. If Iâ€™m not with somebody who really excites or inspires me, then Iâ€™d rather be by myself,â€ Lively told Marie Claire. â€œTo be around me, you must love food or Iâ€™m the most obnoxious person youâ€™ve ever met. Iâ€™m in a big cooking phase. Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ll talk about.â€\n\nPerhaps in anticipation of putting down roots, Lively sold her West Village apartment and bought a $2.3 million country style house in Bedford, in upstate NY with 1.7 acres of garden, a wood panelled living room, formal dining room, library and sun porch. â€œThey keep to themselves,â€ said a neighbor. â€œThey frequent the Bedford Hardware store for home improvement goods, buy groceries and go to restaurants in the area, but arenâ€™t very talkative to the locals. They eat out a lot, and are polite, but donâ€™t make friends with people there. The pair just want to be left alone in their home.â€\n\nFollowing a romantic trip to Venice, the couple tied the knot in a super secret ceremony at Boone Hall Plantation in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina (where The Notebook was filmed) on Sept. 9th 2012 after only a year of dating They had not even announced their engagement before getting married. The bride, 25, wore a silk tulle Marchesa ball gown with rose gold embroidery and crystals while the bridegroom, 36, was in a Burberry suit. Only 35 guests were in attendance including her Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants costars â€” America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn and Alexis Bledel. The ceremony was held in a rustic barn and the reception was held in a white tent at the plantation, while Blakeâ€™s good friend, British singer Florence Welch serenaded the newlyweds with three songs and Bette Midler performed as well. Blakeâ€™s elder half-sister, also an actress, Robyn Lively recreated her Teen Witch dance from the late â€˜80s film classic that she had appeard in. No one, not even the performers or any guests were allowed to bring in phones and everyone was sworn to utter secrecy. Even after the wedding, no pictures were released except for those of certain details, like the bouquet, cake and dessert table, which were published in Martha Steward Living magazine. The vanilla-and-sour-cream wedding cake with peach-apricot preserves and Earl Grey-milk chocolate butter cream was made by Maggie Austin Cake in Alexandria, Virginia. Among the deserts were sâ€™mores, espresso beans, blueberry cheesecake tartlets and lemon meringue tartlets, as well as fruit jellies and mini strawberry cupcakes.\n\nThe morning after, the couple were pictured sharing a kiss in Charleston as the bride displayed her stunning pink diamond engagement ring designed by celebrity jeweller Lorraine Schwartz, featuring a large center stone supported by a band of small diamonds. â€œRyan chose Lorraine Schwartz to help him find a flawless, light pink oval diamond. They worked together to design a custom setting in rose gold and pave diamonds with a nod to deco,â€ a spokesperson for the jeweller said. The brideâ€™s rose gold wedding ring, also by Schwartz, has a series of delicate diamonds to complements the engagement sparkler.\n\nLively settled down to domesticity well, preferring to cook at home rather than head out to expensive restaurants. â€œI use a lot of fresh ingredients, which really does make a huge difference. Itâ€™s easier to be healthy when eating things that are fresh, because they are often fruits and vegetables,â€ she said while filming a segment making Puff Pastry for Vogue.com. Her go-to recipes are sausage and brie puff pastry and rotisserie chicken.\n\nâ€œRight now, Iâ€™m so peaceful. Iâ€™ve never been happier in my life. He treats me like a queen,â€ announced newly wed Blake\n\nEven Martha Steward called her â€œa groovy cook.â€\n\nThe newlyweds took a romantic trip to Paris that winter. An eyewitness told Us magazine â€œThey were kissing the entire time. The locals said hello, but they were only interested in each other.â€\n\nAlways known for her unerring fashion sense, Blakeâ€™s sartorial style climbed a notch even higher after her wedding. She said, â€œItâ€™s (fashion) such a passion of mine. Thatâ€™s the reason I donâ€™t have a stylist, not because I think I can do it better than any of these people, but because I just love it so much that it would be like handing over something.â€\n\nLivelyâ€™s career chart continued to progress and, in 2013, the blond actress scored her first major makeup campaign as the new face of Lâ€™Oreal, The next year she launched a lifestyle digital magazine and e-commerce website with artisanal hand-made one-of-a-kind items that she personally selected called Preserve. The products she was hawking were too expensive for the average consumer. The site never really took off and sensibly she shut it down after only a year, claiming that she had launched it before it was ready and she would redo it and relaunch it later.\n\nLively returned to her lucrative film career and started filming for the The Age of Adaline with Harrison Ford in a cameo role. She plays a woman who â€œstops aging after recovering from a near-fatal accident,â€ but the film was only a modest success.\n\nThe Reynolds made a string of glamorous, high profile appearances that garnered them much publicity.Â First stop was at the 2014 Met Gala. However, the genetically blessed married couple skipped the after parties to eat hot fudge sundaes with peanut butter sauce at NYC hot spot Serendipity despite being all glammed up. Right after they graced the red carpet of the 67th Cannes Film Festival to attend the screening of Canadian independent film Captives, starring Ryan Reynolds\n\nRyan declared on The Late Show With David Letterman, â€œIâ€™m not one for vomiting declarations of sentiment out across the airwaves, but when we had that baby, I fell more in love with my wife than Iâ€™d ever been in my entire life. I couldnâ€™t even believe it….I used to say to (Blake), â€˜I would take a bullet for you. I could never love anything as much as I love you.â€™ And the second I looked in that baby’s eyes, I knew in that exact moment that if we were ever under attack, I would use my wife as a human shield to protect that baby.â€\n\nLively shared her marital bliss with Marie Claire , â€œWeâ€™ve never gone a week without seeing each other. Heâ€™s my best, best friend. If I could spit out a litter of kids, I would.â€\n\nAnd she did, having her first, a daughter who looks just like her who they named James, on Dec 16th 2014. The wary couple kept the birth under wraps for weeks before any public announcement was made.\n\nOn Valentineâ€™s Day 2015, Ryan said, â€œOne of the most common things in the world is making out, having a couple of drinks, and then doing it, and then having a baby. I was perfectly sober for this one though. I gotta say,â€ he joked. â€œItâ€™s amazing. I just always marvel how common it is and yet how profound it is. And I always laugh because you know celebrities you always cringe when they talk about their kids. Like â€˜my child is the only one that has ever exited a womb out, ever. Amid his laughter he continued, â€œWell, a lot of people have done this, so you always want to temper it with a little of self-effacement. But I love it. I truly worship that kid. Itâ€™s terrible. She has me so far wrapped around her finger itâ€™s dumb. She says â€˜dadaâ€™ and I will walk through a cement wall to get to her.â€\n\nâ€œI was recently asked how my style has changed since I got married, as if I was living under some sort of dictatorship. Iâ€™m very lucky to be with someone who has better taste than me. We influence each other in different waysâ€\n\nStill a working actress, Blake accepted the challenge of filming the movie The Shallows mostly in a bikini after the birth. Lively had been known for her incredible 5â€™10â€ tall and curvaceous but slim body before pregnancy. To get fit for her upcoming role, Blake hired a personal trainer who made her exercise for 90 minutes each day. Her circuit training regime included squats, lunges, push-ups and planking. The exercise did more for her than lose the baby weight sheâ€™d gained. She said, â€œI worked out with an amazing trainer Don Saladino. He kicked my butt. It was also eight months after having a baby so my body was already completely different than what it normally was. Not just aesthetically but also your muscles are different, your body, everything is just shifted and changed.â€\n\nThen speaking about the actual intense filming, she told E! News: â€œIt was really crazy. But it was also nice to have that motivation because I wouldnâ€™t have done that. I wouldnâ€™t have gotten in that kind of shape. It was like training for a marathon, but a marathon is one day. This was six weeks straight, six-day weeks, no lunch breaks, thirteen-hour days, four-foot waves at all times. By the time I was done with the movie…I had muscles that I had never had before.â€ In the film, Lively has absolutely flat abs and there is not an inch of fat or loose skin anywhere.\n\nThen in 2016, Reynolds finally hit the big time when Deadpool, the eighth installment of the X-Men film series, was released having been in inception since 2004.Â After a new type of viral marketing campaign, the film earned over $783 million dollars, becoming the overall highest-grossing R-rated film as well as the highest grossing X-Men film to date. Script writer Rhett Reese described Reynoldsâ€™ role being instrumental in ensuring the success of the movie by being â€œthe keeper of the Deadpool flame for many years … if we ever do something that is off the Deadpool path, or if it doesnâ€™t feel like Deadpool, he catches it.â€ His tenacity paid off and finally Ryan had a superhero franchise of his own, with a sequel announced after the movieâ€™s mega success.\n\nâ€œEverything we do in life we do together. I get to share my life with the person heâ€™s become, and we get to grow from thereâ€\n\nâ€”blake\n\nThe same year, Blake gave birth to their second daughter Ines. After having a second child, Ryan admitted that parenting gives him anxiety, because he now finds he is constantly in a rush and has to cram things into short bursts of time, â€œI think youâ€™re just more desperate in everything you do, â€˜cause youâ€™re like, â€˜Iâ€™ve got 10 minutes to do this, and then I gotta get home. Thereâ€™s just no time anymore, so youâ€™re hardened by it. Anxiety, I think, thatâ€™s probably it.â€ He said that earlier he didnâ€™t think he would make a good dad because of his not having had a good relationship with his own father, but Blake assured him he would and patiently schooled him in becoming a hands on dad, changing diapers and cleaning spit up.\n\nOn December 15thÂ 2016, Reynolds received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard. His beautiful wife, toddler daughter and new baby were all there with him to share in his honour. In another landmark, Blake took Ryan to Japanese restaurant O Ya in NYC to celebrate hisÂ 40th birthday.Â Blake, in a rare public declaration paid tribute to her husband, posting on Insta, â€œWe fell in love at your restaurant in Boston. We stay in love at your restaurant in NY. Thank you for the BEST food and memories!â€ In the photo, Reynolds holds a picture of the two, making the same pose, in a shot taken five years prior to this.\n\nDuring this yearâ€™s Met Gala, Humans of New York shared Ryan Reynoldsâ€™ heartfelt message about his other half on. Ryan was quoted gushing about some of Blakeâ€™s best qualities, â€œShe always responds with empathy. She meets anger with empathy. She meets hate with empathy. Sheâ€™ll take the time to imagine what happened to a person when they were five or six years old.â€ He added that she had made him a more empathetic person by helping him strengthen his relationship with his dad. â€œI had a very fractured relationship with my father. Before he died, she made me remember things I didnâ€™t want to remember. She made me remember the good times.â€\n\nHOLLYWOOD, LOS ANGELES, CA, USA – DECEMBER 15: Actor Ryan Reynolds and wife/actress Blake Lively and daughter James Reynolds and newly born daughter attend a ceremony honoring Ryan Reynolds with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame – Dedication of the 2,596th star on the Walk of Fame in the category of Motion Pictures on December 15, 2015 in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, United States.

People often think their career is something they have to chase and maintain, but for us, we said, â€˜Letâ€™s always chase and maintain our personal life.â€™ This is a career thatâ€™s like the stock market: Youâ€™ve got to stay hot while youâ€™re hot. But your family, thatâ€™s the real thing that gives you security and success and happiness.â€ And that is the secret to her success.\n\nBy Mahlia Lone\n\nThis mega successful power couple of the music industry has collaborated on numerous hit albums, three kids and has had their share of public drama. Despite Beyonceâ€™s determination to keep her personal life away from scrutiny and micromanaging the coupleâ€™s public image, the faÃ§ade of their perfect marriage shattered when her sister Solange was caught on camera kicking Jay Zâ€™s ass in an elevator of The Standard hotel following the 2014 Met Galaâ€™s after party in New York City. Cheating rumors have dogged Jay Z for years and now there was proof that where there was smoke there was fire. Though the family hushed up the story at the time, Beyonce hit back with her bestselling album Lemonade two years later in which she powerfully addresses her marital issues. This is how you deal with your problems in a controlled, systematic, well thought out and intelligent manner\n\nShawn Carter was born inÂ Brooklyn in 1969 where he was raised inÂ a housing project alongside his three siblings. His parentsâ€™ taste in music had a profound influence on the little boy who grew up listening to their record collection ofÂ soulÂ artists such asÂ Marvin GayeÂ andÂ Donny Hathaway. He said, â€œI grew up around music, listening to all types of people… Iâ€™m into music that has soul in it, whether it be rap, R&B, pop music, whatever, as long as I can feel their soul through the wax.â€ Their father abandoned the family early on, and their mother, Gloria Carter raised her kids single handedly. Just prior to his death in 2003 Jay Zâ€™s father finally reconciled with his superstar son.\n\nShawn had a tough street childhood. According to his lyrics in 1982, at the age of 12, he shot his older brother in the shoulder for stealing his jewellery. At the same time as AZ, another future rapper, he attended the troubled Eli Whitney High School, a vocational school in Brooklyn, until it was shut down due to too much student violence in the halls. He then attended the George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High SchoolÂ with future rappersÂ The Notorious B.I.G.Â andÂ Busta Rhymes, followed by a brief period atÂ Trenton Central High School inÂ New Jersey, but he did not manage to graduate high school.Â By his own admission, during this period he soldÂ crack cocaineÂ and was shot at three times.\n\nAccording to his mother,Â Shawn used to wake up his siblings at night banging out drum patterns on the kitchen table, so she saved up and bought him aÂ boom boxÂ for his birthday, further fueling his interest in music. This was the time that hip hop was growing as a music movement. Young Shawn too started free stylingÂ and writing lyrics and became known as Jazzy around the neighborhood, which he changed to Jay-Z in homage to his mentorÂ rapper/producer Jaz-O.\n\nJay Zâ€™s mother raised her kids single handely living in a housing project in a tough Brooklyn neighbourhood\n\nIn the early 1990s, Jay-Z got caught up in several battles with the popular rapperÂ LL Cool J, already a success having released four albums, the fourth becoming a double platinum, and even having won a Grammy. The rap culture was rife with open gun violence and demanded that rappers have authentic â€œstreet cred.â€Â Finally, Jay-Z started to gain some recognition touring with established rapper and MC Big Daddy Kane. Kane said Jay-Z â€œwasnâ€™t a hypeman, he basically made cameo appearances on stage. When I would leave the stage to go change outfits, I would bring out Jay-Z and Positive K and let them freestyle until I came back to the stage.â€\n\nJay-Zâ€™s first official rap single was called In My Lifetime, which he produced himself and paid for theÂ music video. Not offered a single record deal, determined Jay-Z sold CDs out of his car and with business partners,Â Damon DashÂ and Kareem Biggs, createdÂ Roc-A-Fella RecordsÂ as an independent record label in 1995 that released Jayâ€™s 1996 debut albumÂ Reasonable Doubt. It hadÂ beatsÂ from acclaimed producers such asÂ DJ PremierÂ andÂ Super DJ Clark KentÂ and an appearance byÂ The Notorious B.I.G.. The album that no big label had been willing to produce reached number 23, reached platinum status and was No. 248 on theÂ BillboardÂ 200 inÂ Rolling Stoneâ€™s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The trio never looked back and they were on their way to becoming mega successful entrepreneurs.\n\nThis time with a distribution deal withÂ Def JamÂ in 1997, Jay Z released his follow-upÂ In My Lifetime, Vol. 1. produced byÂ Sean â€œPuff Daddyâ€ Combs. Jay-Z later said that this album was made during one of the worst periods of his life, after the drive-by shooting death of his close friend The Notorious B.I.G. who is considered to be not only one of the most influential rappers of all time known for his dark autobiographical lyrics, but was also the central figure of the East Coast hip hop scene as opposed to the West Coast that became popular first. Jay-Z too recounted true stories of his difficult upbringing and the albumÂ earned platinum status.\n\nThe Knowles\n\nIn 1998, Jay-Z releasedÂ Vol. 2… Hard Knock LifeÂ with the hit track Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem) that had moreÂ flow and wordplay, and mined beats from popular producers like Â Swizz Beatz, an in-house producer forÂ Timbaland. In 2000, Jay Z released the more soulful albumÂ The Dynasty: Roc La Familia, which helped introduce newcomers includingÂ Kanye West.Â The Blueprint with Eminem as a guest rapper, which Jay had written in just two daysÂ and quickly released after the 9/11 attack, debuted at number one on theÂ BillboardÂ 200Â and reached 2x platinum status.\n\nIn 1999, both Jay-Z and Damond Dash romantically pursued the talented and popular R&B singer/actress Aaliyah who Dash won over before her tragic and untimely death in a plane crash in the Bahamas after filming a music video. This love dynamic the two business partners were to repeat years later. Though Dash was said to be engaged to Aaliyah, it was Jay Z who wrote the song Miss You after her death.\n\nThe business partners also launched Rocawear, a company that would go on to have an annual $700 million turnover. A budding fashion designer of a Bengali Indian father and Dutch mother, Californian Rachel Roy joined the startup as an intern. She would work her way up the ladder and would play a big part in both menâ€™s lives.\n\nIn October 2001, Jay Z pleaded guilty to stabbing record producerÂ Lance RiveraÂ at the Kit Kat Klub in New York City in 1999 and was sentenced to three years probation for the second degree felony. This was the time when he met an eighteen year old singing sensation Beyonce, a part of the best selling girl group off all time, Destinyâ€™s Child, who would curb his wild ways.\n\nBeyoncÃ© Giselle KnowlesÂ was born and raised inÂ Houston, Texas, toÂ Celestine â€œTinaâ€ KnowlesÂ (nÃ©e BeyincÃ©), a hairdresser and salon owner ofÂ Louisiana CreoleÂ descent (African, Native American, and French), andÂ Mathew Knowles, an African AmericanÂ Xerox sales manager. BeyoncÃ©â€™s younger sisterÂ Solange also became a hit singer andÂ briefly a member ofÂ Destinyâ€™s Child.\n\nBeyoncÃ© attended St. Maryâ€™s Montessori School, where she enrolled in dance classes. One day, the dance instructor started humming a song and Beyonce finished it, hitting all the high-pitched notes. Aged seven, she won a school talent show, singingÂ John Lennonâ€™s Imagine beating out15-16-year-olds. Her parents realized that their daughter had a natural talent and they wanted to develop it into a lucrative career for her, which the whole family could benefit from. So in 1990, BeyoncÃ© was enrolled in Parker Elementary School, a musicÂ magnet school, where she joined the schoolâ€™s choir. When BeyoncÃ© was eight, she, childhood friendÂ Kelly Rowland and Latavia Roberson auditioned for places in the girlâ€™s groupÂ Girlâ€™s Tyme that sang, rapped and danced on the talent show circuit. They made it to California and were selected forÂ Star Search, a TV talent show, but failed to take home the prize.\n\nContinuing to hone her skill, Beyonce attended theÂ High School for the Performing and Visual Arts and laterÂ Alief Elsik High School. During this time, BeyoncÃ© became a soloist at St. Johnâ€™s United Methodist Church choirÂ for two years.\n\nIn 1995, Mathew Knowles resigned from his job to manage the girlsâ€™ group full time.Â The family income was reduced by half, and they had to downsize. The girlsâ€™ group continued performing as an opening act for other R&B girlsâ€™ groups and kept auditioning before record labels hoping to get a break. During this tough financial time, Tina separated from Mathew but he still didnâ€™t give up on his golden songstress daughter.\n\nMichelle Williams, Beyonce & Kelly Rowland made up the hit girlsâ€™ group Destinyâ€™s Child\n\nFinally, in 1996 the group got a contract with Columbia Records under the new name Destinyâ€™s Child based upon a biblical passage and the following year released their debut song Killing Time on the soundtrack to the 1997 Will Smith sci-fi blockbuster,Â Men in Black; they had finally hit the big time. The groupâ€™s self-titled debut album had the its first major hit No, No, No; its multi-platinum second albumÂ The Writingâ€™s on the WallÂ (1999) had the groupâ€™s first number-one single, Jumpinâ€™ Jumpinâ€™ as well as Say My Name, which won two R&B awardsÂ at theÂ 43rd Annual Grammys. The Writingâ€™s on the WallÂ sold more than eight million copies worldwide, making the teenage girls household names.\n\nBeyoncÃ©â€™s long standing boyfriend, not being able to handle her huge success, broke up with her. She sunk into depression that lasted for a couple of years. It was so severe that she would lock herself in her room for and refused to eat anything. The family hid Beyonceâ€™s depression from the world to preserve her perfect sultry. starry image and Tina helped her daughter slowly recover behind closed doors. In this way, Beyonce was schooled to hide her pain from the world.\n\nIn 2000, the song Independent Women Part I was featured on the soundtrack of the hit movie Charlieâ€™s Angels and topped the U.S.Â BillboardÂ Hot 100Â chart for eleven consecutive weeks. The groupâ€™s third albumÂ SurvivorÂ was released just a year later,Â debuting at number one on the U.S.Â BillboardÂ 200. Beyonceâ€™s curves became synonymous with the track Bootylicious and the title track Survivor won a Grammy Award in the R&B category.Â After releasing their holiday albumÂ 8 Days of ChristmasÂ in fall 2001, the hard working group announced a hiatus to pursue their solo careers.\n\nBeyonce had met Jay-Z by this time. Though they werenâ€™t dating but only friends, they would speak on the phone and meet up. She was desirous of pursuing a solo career and he owned a record label and was an award winning producer with a talent for spotting and developing new talent, so it was a great match in more ways than one. BeyoncÃ© started dating the 12 years olderÂ Jay ZÂ after their collaboration on the song Bonnie & ClydeÂ which appeared on his seventh albumÂ The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The CurseÂ (2002). In the music video, she plays his girlfriend, fuelling speculation about their relationship status, but the duo remained tight-lipped about the romance. The couple generally avoids discussing their relationship. BeyoncÃ© has stated that she believes that not publicly discussing their relationship has helped them, while Jay Z agreed in aÂ People magazine interview, â€œWe donâ€™t play with our relationship.â€\n\nKareem Biggs, Damond Dash & Jay-Z were business partners as well as friends before they fell out\n\nThat year Beyonce branched out into movies, playing Foxxy CleopatraÂ alongsideÂ Mike MyersÂ in the comedy movie Austin Powers in Goldmember,Â which grossed $73Â million. Â Work It Out was the lead single from its soundtrack album. The next year BeyoncÃ© starred oppositeÂ Cuba Gooding, Jr., in the musical The Fighting Temptations and also sung two tracks for the soundtrack. Meanwhile, in her personal life, she was frequently spotted in Jay-Zâ€™s company courtside at basketball matches, fashion shows and A-list events. The same year, she released her first solo albumÂ Dangerously in LoveÂ after her ex band mates, Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland had already come out with theirs. Her album debuted atop theÂ BillboardÂ 200Â and sold more than11 million copies worldwide. The albumâ€™sÂ lead single, Crazy in Love, featuringÂ Jay Z, became BeyoncÃ©â€™s first number one single as a solo artist. The single Baby Boy also reached number one.Â Â Clearly the two were making amazing music together. The album earned BeyoncÃ© a then record-tying five awards at theÂ 46th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nJay-Z started the 40/40 sports bars\n\nThe ever enterprising Jay-Z after visiting the South of France opened the upscale 40/40 Club in NYC in 2003, the first in a chain of sports bars known for their live music, celebrity patrons, and sports memorabilia. Great at marketing, he cleverly mentioned the bar in his song Dirt Off Your Shoulder: â€œNow you chillinâ€™ with a boss, bitch of course SC on the sleeve/at the 40/40 club ESPN on the screen.â€\n\nAt the opening of the sports bar, he announced his eighth album, The Black Album featuring producers such as Kanye West,Â Timbaland andÂ Eminem among many others. He has such clout and such a successful track record that all the bright stars of the industry want to work with him. Jay brags about his hot girlfriend Beyonce on the track, Public Service Announcement, rapping â€œI got the hottest chick in the game wearing my chain.â€\n\n“I was 18 when we first met, 19 when we started dating. There was no rush. No one expected me to run off and get married. We were friends first, for a year and a half, before we went on any date, (we were) on the phone for a year and a half. And that foundation is so important in a relationship. And just to have someone that you just like, is so important. And someone that is honest.” –Beyonce\n\nJay-Z also collaborated withÂ R. Kelly, ex-husband of the late Aaliyah, on a collaborative studio album,Â The Best of Both Worlds. At the end of the year, Jay held a charity concertâ€”billed as a â€œretirement partyâ€â€”atÂ NYCâ€™s Madison Square Garden, the footage of which was later used in his rockumentay/hip hop filmÂ Fade to Black. Missy Elliott,Â Mary J. Blige, Foxy Brown,Â Pharrell Williams, R. Kelly and Beyonce were just some of the big names that headlined the show. He also invited the mothers ofÂ The Notorious B.I.G. andÂ Tupac Shakur in memory of his dead friends.\n\nIn February, 2004, BeyoncÃ© was honoured by being asked to perform theÂ American national anthemÂ at Super Bowl XXXVIII, at her hometown of Houston. At top of her game, and with the genius producer Jay-Z behind her, she was finally ready to take their relationship public. Jay-Z, after having split with his partners in Roc-A-Fella Records due to too many business disputes was named president of Def Jam Records. Fresh from their success and feeling confident, Jay and Bey made their red carpet debut as a couple at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards in colour coordinated outfits of white and gold.\n\nMaking their first public appearance as a couple at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards in colour coordinated outfits\n\nAs President of Def Jam, Jay-Z signed the phenomenally talented new artist Rihanna to an astonishing six-record recording deal in 2005. The record company executives literally wouldnâ€™t let the Barbadian teenager leave the building till she had signed on the dotted line lest she sign with a rival company. Jay and Rihanna began a close working relationship and a year into it, rumors that the two were hooking up were rife. We still donâ€™t know how much truth there is to the rumours, however, as neither addressed them.\n\nMeanwhile, Beyonce, still concentrating on her career, came out with another solo albumÂ Bâ€™DayÂ to coincide with her twenty-fifth birthday that debuted atop theÂ BillboardÂ 200. TheÂ hit lead single DÃ©jÃ Vu, again featured her steady boyfriend Jay-Z. She also continued her foray into films by playing a sexy pop singer in The Pink PantherÂ (2006)Â starring the veteran comedianÂ Steve Martin. The movie was a smash,Â grossing $160Â million worldwide. Though Dreamgirls,Â the film version of the 1981 Broadway musical based onÂ The Supremes, was supposed to be a Beyonce vehicle to award glory, it was singer/actressÂ Jennifer Hudson who in a supporting role ended up winning the Oscar. Beyonce covered up her disappointment well.\n\nEast Coast rappers in Miami\n\nIn 2006, whenÂ Jay-Z released his comeback albumÂ Kingdom Come, featuring the song Lost One, the trackâ€™s somber lyrics fuelled speculation that the pairâ€™s relationship was on the rocks. He raps:Â â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s meant to be, B/But she loves her work more than she does me/And honestly, at 23/ I would probably love my work more than I did she.â€ These lines are about trying to have a real, serious relationship with another ambitious and super busy high profile professional. This song was in complete contrast to his earlier songs like Big Pimpinâ€™, where women exist almost completely as predators or objects. Itâ€™s about respecting the woman you are with and a real relationship of equals. The duo was listed as the most powerful couple forÂ TIMEÂ magazineâ€™s 100 most influential people of 2006.\n\nIn 2007, Jay Z released his tenth album entitledÂ American Gangster, a new â€œconceptâ€ album depicting his experiences as a street-hustler, recorded Umbrella with Rihanna, one of the most popular songs of the year, and sold Rocawear for more than $200 million. On Beyâ€™s birthday in September, Jay proposed to her but the two decided to keep the engagement a secret. BeyoncÃ© did not publicly debut her $5Â millionÂ Lorraine Schwartz engagement ring until the Fashion Rocks concert a full year later in New York City whereby the public learnt of their engagement. In anticipation of this major life change perhaps, on January 1, 2008, Jay resigned as president of Def Jam.\n\nIt was speculated that Beyonce’s song Ring That Alarm was about Jay-Z cheating on her with Rihanna\n\nOn April 4th (4/4, their favourite number and both their birthdays) 2008, Jay and Bey married at a private ceremony at the bride groomâ€™s massive Tribeca apartment in NYC. A source told the press: â€œJay wanted it to be a really private affair – close friends and family.â€ The bride wore a dress designed by her mother, Tina, and instead of wedding rings, the couple opted for matching tattoos of the Roman numeral four (IV) on their ring fingers as a permanent mark of their commitment to one another. The Carters went to a super exclusive resort in the Maldives for their honeymoon.\n\nThe Carters are great supporters/friends of the Obamas and Beyonce sang at both of the ex-President’s inaugurals\n\nInÂ an interview forÂ EssenceÂ magazine later that year, Bey was unusually candid about her private life, explaining that it was a joint decision to keep quiet about their relationship, â€œWe decide everything. My word is my word. What Jay and I have is real. Itâ€™s not about interviews or getting the right photo op. Itâ€™s real.â€ She also said that their wedding was â€œsmall, intimate, and drama-free.â€\n\nBeyonce publicly revealed their marriage in a video montage at the listening party for her third studio album,Â I Am… Sasha Fierce, in Manhattanâ€™s Sony Club six months later.Â Sasha Fierce is Beyonceâ€™s powerful alter ego. The album featured the number-one songs Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It), a favourite of ex-President Barack Obamaâ€™s who is also a big fan of her husbandâ€™s work, as well as Halo, the longest-running Hot 100 single in her career. With these songs, she attained more top ten singles on the list than any other woman during theÂ 2000s. She also starred as aÂ bluesÂ singerÂ in the 2008 musical biopicÂ Cadillac Records. Jay Z too became the first hip hop artist to headline UKâ€™s Glastonbury Festival. In January 2009,Â ForbesÂ ranked them as Hollywoodâ€™s top earning couple, with a combined total of $162Â million.Â They also made it to the top of the list the following year, with a combined total of $122Â million between June 2008 and June 2009.\n\nBeyonce reveals pregnancy at 2011\n\nFriends and supporters of President Barack Obama, BeyoncÃ© performed At Last at the First Coupleâ€™s first inaugural ball in 2009.Â At theÂ 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, BeyoncÃ© received ten nominations, tying withÂ Lauryn HillÂ for most Grammy nominations in a single year by a female artist. She won six awards that night,Â breaking her own recordÂ set in 2004 for the most Grammy awards won in a single night by a female artist. Meanwhile, Jay-Z featured on two more of Rihannaâ€™s songs Talk That Talk and Run This Town, which they also performed together at high profile concerts. He released a studio albumÂ The Blueprint 3Â that year days ahead of schedule due to heightened anticipation.Â It became his 11th album to reach No.1 on the Billboard 200, surpassing Elvis Presleyâ€™s previous record. He also dropped the hyphen from his name.\n\nIn late 2013, Beyonce released a visual albgy gown to the MTV Video Music Awards in 2um and a string of video features where she spoke candidly about home life for the very first time: “Nothing feels like my child singing ‘mummy.’ No, nothing feels like when I look my husband in the eyes, nothings feels like when I’m respected, when I get on the stage and I see I’m changing people’s lives.”\n\nBeyonce & Jay Z with Blue Ivy VMAâ€™s 2014\n\nBeyoncÃ© announced a hiatus from her hectic career in January 2010, heeding her motherâ€™s advice, â€œto live life, to be inspired by things again.â€Â She later said, â€œI did it for my sanity, my life, my relationships, my nephew, my husband, my sister and my friendships,â€ she said of her career break. â€œI can decide I want to have kids. I can be the mother I want to be.â€ During the break she and her father parted ways as business partners.Â She travelled, visited museums and took in various cultural performances during this time. The public speculated that Bey was focussing on starting a family.\n\nBeyonce didnâ€™t share when exactly she had a miscarriage in the early stages of her pregnancy, just that she did.Â â€œI flew back to New York to get my check upâ€”and no heartbeat,â€ she recalled sadly in the HBO documentary Life Is But a Dream.Â â€˜Literally the week before I went to the doctor, everything was fine, but there was no heartbeat.â€\n\nBeyonce makes quite a fashionable entrance at the Met Gala 2015 after the debacle at the previous yearâ€™s party\n\nLuckily she became pregnant again in 2011 and this time she would bear the baby full term. After cautiously keeping the pregnancy a secret, she decided not to say anything but let the image do the talking by wearing a red clingy gown to the MTV Video Music Awards in 2011, rubbing her pregnant belly during a performance of Love On Top and saying â€œTonight I want you to stand up on your feet, I want you to feel the love thatâ€™s growing inside of me,â€ the mosttweeted moment of the year. and unbuttoning her blazer at the end and proudly rubbing her stomach.\n\nSolange kicking and punching Jay Z in The Standard hotel elevator when the 2014 Met Gala post party went viral after it was leaked to TMZ\n\nJay Z holding his cheek after the incident\n\nA source revealed to a reporter, “Rachel used to be an intern at Rocawear back in the day. It was alleged that Jay and Dash would pass girls around that office. Jay’s partying shot when the music label split was, ‘and I had your wife'”\n\nLater she said: â€œI didnâ€™t want a crazy picture or gossip story to break the news, so I decided to say nothing and proudly show my baby bump.â€\n\nIndian-Dutch Californian fashion designer Rachel Roy\n\nIn an interview she said, â€œbeing pregnant was very much like falling in love. You are so open. You are so overjoyed.Â Thereâ€™s no words that can express having a baby growing inside of you, so of course you want to scream it out and tell everyone. â€˜I felt the baby kick for the first time. Kicked five times.â€\n\nFollowing the baby news the pair gradually grew more and more comfortable with PDAs (public displays of affection). They were even spotted on double dates with fellow high-profile pals Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nAlways the hard working, thorough professional, she dropped another number one album with the popular tracks: Run the World (Girls) and Best Thing I Never Had.\n\nBeyonceâ€™s visual album Lemonade was a huge critical and commercial success\n\nOn January 7, 2012, BeyoncÃ© gave birth to her first child, a daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, atÂ Lenox Hill HospitalÂ in New York. In an official statement released after the birth, the couple announced: â€œHer birth was emotional and extremely peaceful, we are in heaven. We are thankful to everyone for all your prayers, well wishes, love and support.â€\n\nTwo days later, an emotional Jay Z released Glory, a song dedicated to their child, on his social website LifeandTimes.com. The song detailed the coupleâ€™s pregnancy struggles, including a miscarriage BeyoncÃ© suffered before becoming pregnant with their daughter. Because Blueâ€™s cries were included at the end of the song and she was officially credited on the song as â€œB.I.Câ€, and at 2 days old becoming the youngest person ever to appear on aÂ BillboardÂ chart.\n\nRita Ora posted a picture of herself wearing a bra with lemons on it and a necklace with the inital J, but then denied being the other woman after getting trolled by Beyonce fans called Bey-hive\n\nWith their marriage going well, the couple celebrated their four-year wedding anniversary by renewing their vows in front of a star-studded group of friends and family, which reportedly included Oprah Winfrey, in early 2012. A few days later, Jay Z was spotted leaving jewellers Jacob. And Co. sporting a new gold ring on his ring finger.\n\nBey sported a t-shirt with Aaliyah\n\n(Dashâ€™s late ex-fiancee)\n\non it to get back at Rachel\n\nBeyonce went on a sell-out Mrs. Carter World Tour around the globe, and shared with her fans an intimate look at family life with candid behind-the-scenes pictures of the couple kissing and holding each other.\n\nWhen Jay received the Grammy for Holy Grail, his Justin Timberlake collaboration, he pointed to Bey and said, â€œI want to thank God, I mean a little for this award, but mostly for that and all the universes for conspiring and putting that beautiful light of a young woman in my life. And I want to tell Blue that look, Daddy got a gold sippy cup for you!â€\n\nComparing his hard life growing up without a father to how he was planning to bring her up, he said on MTV,â€œI was going to have to go through some things, and they were preparing me. She has to love herself, she has to know who she is, she has to be respectful and be a moral person.â€\n\nIn addition to his record company, Jay Z has many other investments and sources of income. He is the co-brand director for Budweiser Select, advising on strategic marketing programs for media and high profile events as well as creative ad developmentÂ He has been a part-owner of theÂ Brooklyn NetsÂ NBAÂ team. He has launched his own sports agency, Roc Nation Sports, his own Life + Times website, real estate development company, J Hotels, which owns a $66Â million mid-block parcel in Chelsea, NYC, as a potential site for a 12 storey hotel and/or art gallery, has invested $200 million in Armand de BrignacÂ champagne owned Sovereign Brands, a New York-based wine and spirits company, and even has his own brand of Cuban cigars. In an interview, he said, â€œmy brands are an extension of me. Theyâ€™re close to me. Itâ€™s not like runningÂ GM (General Motors) where thereâ€™s no emotional attachment.â€\n\nJay and Bey overtook supermodel Gisele Bundchen and pro quarterback footballer Tom Brady asÂ Forbes magazineâ€™sÂ highest-paid celebrity couple in 2012, with an estimated total income of $78 million combined.\n\nBeyonce sat down for aÂ long interview with Oprah, in which she opened up about her marriage. â€œI would not be the woman I am if I did not go home to that man. It gives me such a foundation.â€ She also described her earlier miscarriage as being â€œone of the hardest things Iâ€™ve been through.â€\n\nIn December 2013, BeyoncÃ© unexpectedly released herÂ eponymous fifth studio albumÂ on theÂ iTunes StoreÂ without any prior announcement or promotion. The album debuted atop theÂ BillboardÂ 200 chart, making her the first woman in the chartâ€™s history to have first five studio albums debut at number one. BeyoncÃ©Â received critical acclaimÂ and commercial success for the album that sold one million digital copies worldwide in six days. Musically an electro-R&BÂ album, it has darker themes previously unexplored in her work, such as â€œbulimia,Â postnatal depression,Â and the fears and insecurities of marriage and motherhood,â€Â according to a critic. On the one hand, the single Drunk in Love, featuring Jay Z,Â showed the world how the couple has passionate sex in the kitchen. On the other,Â on the track Mine, Bey appears to express doubts about the relationship, singing: â€œBeen having conversations about breakups and separations/Iâ€™m not feeling like myself since the baby/Are we gonna even make it? Oooh/Cause if we are, weâ€™re taking this a little too far.â€\n\nBut soon all was to be revealed. By April 2014, the uber successful music couple had sold a combined 300 million records together, but all was not well at home. At the Met Gala 2014 after party in The Standard Hotel, Jay Z was seen bumping into Rachel Roy by Solange Knowles. Rachel had also climbed the career ladder and had been made creative director of womenâ€™s and childrenâ€™s lines at Rocawear clothing in 2001. Four years later, Rachel married Dash, amid rumours she had already enjoyed a brief fling with Jay Z, which is alleged to have cemented their closeness over the years.\n\nPregnant with twins\n\nRachelâ€™s blossoming relationship withÂ Kim Kardashian, whose soon to be husbandÂ Kanye WestÂ was close friends with Jay Z, was another link between them. By this time, Rachel had gotten divorced from Dash and was close to Jay after two decades of association. This was a relationship that Bey didnâ€™t trust or like. Solange and Rachel even exchanged words at the party after the latter had spoken to Jay. Solange, Jay and Beyonce were leaving the party when in the elevator the camera recorded a heated exchange in which Solange actually physically attacked her brother in law who to his credit did not defend himself. In the full three-minute video, a bodyguard has toÂ physically restrainÂ Solange as she tries to repeatedly punch and kick Jay Z. The recording was leaked to TMZ and went viral.\n\nIn the morning the Knowles-Carter family tried to whitewash the story by issuing a statement: â€œAs a result of the public release of the elevator security footage from Monday, May 5th, there has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident. But the most important thing is that our family has worked through it. Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred. They both acknowledge their role in this private matter that has played out in the public. They both have apologized to each other and we have moved forward as a united family. The reports of Solange being intoxicated or displaying erratic behavior throughout that evening are simply false. At the end of the day, families have problems and weâ€™re no different. We love each other and above all we are family. Weâ€™ve put this behind us and hope everyone else will do the same.â€\n\nJay, Barack and Bruce at the Songwriters Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony 2017\n\nThe sisters also posted a series of happy pictures of them together on Instagram before 7 a.m. New York time the day after the footage was leaked.\n\nBey and Jayâ€™s absence at Kim and Kanyeâ€™s wedding that year was conspicuous. They were on holiday at the time in Europe and could easily have made it. Perhaps it was due to Rachel Royâ€™s attendance at the wedding that kept them at bay. Beyonce has remained cold to Kim despite the fact that their husbands were friends, and Kanye had even caused embarrassment to himselfÂ whenÂ he disrupted Taylor Swiftâ€™s speech at the 2009 VMAs and insisted that Beyonce deserved have rightfully won the award. Kim has also repeatedly madeÂ overtures towards Beyonce but only to be repeatedly publically rebuffed.\n\nRumours continue to dogÂ Bey and Jay with claims that they were planning a trial separation but did not want to go ahead with a divorce due to their complicated financial and work entanglements. A source told The New York Postâ€™s Page Six: â€œThey are trying to figure out a way to split without divorcing. This is a huge concert tour and theyâ€™ve already gotten most of the money from the promoters up front. There are no (wedding) rings (currently on their fingers), if you havenâ€™t noticed.â€\n\nThe Carters are a family of five now after the birth of twins\n\nBut the show must go on. After much speculation, BeyoncÃ© and Jay Z spent the summer of 2014 on their On the Run Tour, the coupleâ€™s first co-headlining stadium tour together. All seemed hunky dory with the couple holding hands and kissing onstage as lots of intimate home video footage helped to reinforce the coupleâ€™s commitment to each other. There was a hiccup, however, at the Cincinnati show when BeyoncÃ© changed the lyrics to her ballad Resentment (which she performed in a wedding gown). The line â€œIâ€™ll always remember feeling like I was no good/Like I couldnâ€™t do it for you like your mistress couldâ€ was replaced with â€œIâ€™ll always remember feeling like I was no good/ Like I couldnâ€™t do it for you like that wack bitch could.â€ And â€œBeen ridinâ€™ with you for six yearsâ€¦/ I gotta look at her in her eyes and see sheâ€™s had half of meâ€ became a harsher â€œBeen ridinâ€™ with you for 12 yearsâ€¦/I gotta look at her in her eyes and see sheâ€™s had half of me./She ainâ€™t even half of me. That bitch will never be.â€\n\nBy the end of the year, ForbesÂ reported that BeyoncÃ© was the top-earning woman in music for the second year in a row, earning $115 million in the year, more than double her earnings in 2013.\n\nâ€œThey had been having problems for years,â€ revealed a source close to the couple. â€œThere was a constant commitment issue between them and in the end they were barely speaking. BeyoncÃ© didnâ€™t fully trust Jay and it was hard for her to get past that And so began an intense period of reflection for the couple. They went to a lot of counseling and have been working on their issues ever since. They had help to get them through it.â€\n\nApparently, the couple took some time to work on their marriage and went into marital therapy together at the end of which Beyonce decided to use her songwriting as a form of catharsis or perhaps she was ready to tell her story and make a buck out of it. Beyonce dropped her visual album LemonadeÂ that debuted at number one on the USÂ BillboardÂ 200, making BeyoncÃ© the first act in BillboardÂ history to have their first six studio albums debut atop the chart.Â With all 12 tracks ofÂ LemonadeÂ debuting on theÂ BillboardÂ Hot 100 chart, BeyoncÃ© also became the first female act to chart 12 or more songs at the same time.Â Additionally,Â LemonadeÂ was streamed 115 million times through Tidal, setting a record for the most-streamed album in a single week by a female artist in history. The previous year, Jay Z had completed the $56 million acquisition ofÂ Aspiro, a Norwegian media technology company that operates the subscription-based music streaming serviceÂ Tidal, so they were both in on using the rumours about their marriage to make money. They put a spin on the story to suit their purpose.\n\nâ€œThe album was released on Tidal, Jayâ€™s streaming service, and what better way to draw attention to BeyoncÃ©â€™s album release than to hint at all the speculation about past problems in their marriage,â€™â€™ a source revealed.\n\nIn one song, namedÂ Sorry, Beyonce sings the following lines discussing the break-down of a relationship and the presence of another woman: â€œSo what are you gonna say at my funeral now that youâ€™ve killed me?/Here lies the body of the love of my life/whose heart I broke without a gun to my head./He better call Becky with the good hair.â€\n\nLemonadeÂ traces the story not just of infidelity, but also of reconciliation. It starts with BeyoncÃ© questioning her relationship. â€œAre you cheating on me?â€ she asks the viewer. When the evidence of unfaithfulness becomes conclusive, she protests: â€œThey donâ€™t love you like I love you,â€ followed by anger: â€œIâ€™m gonna fuck me up a bitch,â€ she sings baseball bat in hand. Later she adds, â€œWho the f___ do you think I am?/You ainâ€™t married to an average bitch, boy!/You can watch my fat ass twist, b\n\nBy Mahlia Lone\n\nThe Billionaire & the Bollywood Star\n\nNivrutti Munim was born in Bombay in 1955 the youngest of nine sisters and one brother in a Gujarati Jain family residing in Bhuleshwar, an older South Mumbai neighbourhood where most of the Gujarati community resided. Inspired by her elder sister Bhawna, a model, Nivrutti adopted the Anglicised name Tina and entered the beauty pageant circuit. Fair, pretty and slim, she was crowned Femina Teen Princess India 1975 and subsequently represented India at the International Teen Contest in Aruba 1978; she became the 2nd runner up and won the Miss Photogenic and Miss Bikini awards.\n\nAfter appearing in a toothpaste commercial, Tina caught the eye of producer/director/star Dev Anand who cast her as his leading lady in Des Pardes (1978), which became a big hit. He cast her in two more films with him in the lead, Lootmaar and Man Pasand, which also became blockbusters quickly making her a household name. The press linked her with the elderly lothario who had launched her into films and whose production house she was signed to, a claim she denied later. Tina had been childhood friends with bad boy star kid Sanjay Dutt and they became sweethearts. When Sunil Dutt launched his son in Rocky (1981) and Tina was cast as the movieâ€™s leading lady, she not only left Dev Anandâ€™s â€œcampâ€ but also turned down two other romantic films that went on to become big grossers: Rajendra Kumarâ€™s film Love Story introducing his son Kumar Gaurav and Ek Duje Ke Liye starring South Indian popular actor Kamal Haasan. Tina dimmed her light to play the supportive girlfriend, but Sanjay was heavily into alcohol and drugs. Despite several interventions by friends and family, Sanjay was badly addicted and eventually the two broke up.\n\nDes Pardes with elederly lothario Dev Anand who launched her in her film career\n\nTinaâ€™s rapid climb to success via the men in her life\n\nWith boyfriend Sanjay Dutt, her co-star in Rocky\n\nTina was paired with the superstar Rajesh Khanna in a total of 11 films of which 8 were released and became huge hits including Souten and Bewafai. In their personal life too, the pair clicked. After his divorce from Dimple Kapadia, Khanna took up with Tina in 1980. She moved in to his palatial house Aashirwaad on Carter Road, but he never sealed the deal by marrying her. Towards the end of this scandalous, by the standards of the time, live in relationship, she attended a Gujarati wedding wearing a black sari. Traditional Gujarati wedding colours are red and gold, and she was the only one dressed minimally. A Gujarati industrialistâ€™s son couldnâ€™t help but notice the stylish Bollywood star, and thought himself how pretty and different she was. This young man was Anil Dhirubhai Ambani who would go on to transform her life.\n\nTina played the heroine in 11 Rajesh Khanna starrers as well moved in with him in his house after his divorce from Dimple Kapadia\n\nSex symbol\n\nThree years younger than Tina, Anil was the son of one of Indiaâ€™s leading industrialists Dhirubhai Ambani of Reliance Group. He had gotten his Masters degree from the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania and had brought his modern ideas back with him with which he was modernizing his fatherâ€™s business. A few months later, Anil ran into Tina in Philadelphia and was formally introduced to her. He asked her out, but being a star often propositioned by random men she was standoffish. Besides she was still living with Rajesh, who was not marrying her. In 1986, after she broke up with her older lover, Tina was again introduced to Anil by her nephew who insisted sheÂ meet this eligible Gujarati boy. She agreed to meet him reluctcantly, but kept dilly dallying. When she finally capitulated and met him, she was struck by how straight forward and genuine he was, saying simply to her, â€œYou are pretty.â€\n\nThe Gujarati business tycoon Dhirubhai Ambani with Mukesh & Anil Ambani\n\nKokilaben & Dhirubhai Ambani\n\nOn the talk show, Rendezvous with Simi Garewal, Tina recounted their first date, â€œThe first time I met him, I was quite struck by his simplicity. I found him very upfront and genuineâ€¦.He was unlike the other men I had met, because most of the guys I met were from films. Also, we spoke the same language, not literally, but we were brought up in a similar manner.â€\n\nAnil agreed on the show about their affinity to each other, â€œWhen you meet someone from the film fraternity, you have certain notions about them. I have known many people from that industry, but she is just different. The attraction came about only after I met her.â€\n\nAnil knew that he had found The One, while Tina realized that he was the kind of marriage material guy she needed to settle down with. But it was not to be that easy. They dated only a few months before the budding romance was splashed all over the tabloids and the conservative Ambanis were not amused. Their son wanted to marry a scandalous actress who had openly been living with a man.Â Anilâ€™s parents asked him to end this relationship, which could have no future. The dutiful son promptly complied by breaking up with Tina after explaining the situation to her. Tinaâ€™s film career was already at its tail end. After yet another failed romance, disheartened, she decided in 1987 to leave for Los Angeles to qualify as an interior designer.\n\nExtremely lavish but traditional Gujarati wedding\n\nThe two had no contact for the next four years, even though Anil said of his feelings at this time, â€œThere was a lot of pain. A feeling of great loss!â€\n\nThen one day after a big earthquake hit the Los Angeles area, Anil called up Tina to check if she was safe. She greeted him warmly and said she was fine. Anil abruptly disconnected the call. After he hung up, Tina was flabbergasted that he called her out of the blue and then hung up so quickly. She recalled, â€œThat was the time I was so upset and crying away. And, I asked myself why this guy called me, came into my life, and revived all the feelings? Obviously he cared thatâ€™s why he wanted to know whether I am OK or not. But, he did not even complete the conversation. The least he could do is complete the conversation.â€ It was an emotional blow for her. For the first time, she realised that Anil really cared for her.\n\nOn their first date, Anil said simply to Tina, “you are pretty”\n\nAnil explained his side, â€œThere was no conversation to be held. It would have been a sob-sob conversation, because when you are talking to someone you love so much after three to four years, you get into it.â€\n\nThough he could have had his pick of girls, Anil all this time kept trying to convince his parents to let him marry Tina. She in her turn had kept her head down and did not make any waves. Finally, seeing their sonâ€™s loyalty and commitment to Tina, they caved. With his parents blessing, Anil again called her up, and asked her when she would return to Bombay. Still smarting from his abruptÂ call two years prior, she brushed him off saying â€œsoonâ€ but not thinking anything of it she kept postponing her plans. After six weeks of this cat and mouse game, Anil told her that if she did not come this time, he would not call her again. Hearing the seriousness in his voice, she said, â€œThat was when I realised that something is going on and I shouldnâ€™t miss this. Now, I should go back, and that following week, I came back.â€\n\nThe very next day, Anil picked her up and immediately took her to his home to meet his parents. He recalled, â€œEven before she came back to India, I had very clearly laid out a plan. This is the day she will meet my parents, this is the day will get engaged, this is the day we will get married and this would be the location.â€\n\nAnil Ambani with sons, Anmol & Anshul\n\nWhen Anil left Tina with his family, his older brother, Mukesh Ambani, casually asked Tina how she felt about getting married the next month. She said that she was shocked when she realised that once the parental consent was given how quickly they were to be married. After this, Anil only had her family to contend with.\n\nAnil said, â€œI went to her house in Khar. Tinaâ€™s sister and brother-in-law were there. They both were quite shocked to see me because they didnâ€™t know what was going on (in Mumbai). Her brother-in-law went inside to tell her mother. She was shocked to see me. I said that you love your daughter, Tina, very much, and she said, â€˜yes, absolutely.â€™ I said that â€˜if that is the case, then you can keep her here otherwise, I very much want to marry her.â€™â€\n\nThe billionaire brothers with their wives, Nita & Tina\n\nTina & Anil with the Spielbergs at the Golden Globes 2013 representing their co-production Lincoln\n\nWhen Tinaâ€™s mother figured out that the son of Indiaâ€™s richest man was asking for her daughterâ€™s hand in marriage, she was overjoyed and took his hand in gratitude. Anil and Tina got married only six weeks later in February 1991 in a lavish but traditional Gujarati wedding. Tina wore a red Gujarati bridal sari with heavy gold Gujarati jewellery. Anil wore a cream coloured sherwani with gold embroidery and a Maharajaâ€™s multi strand pearl necklace.\n\nTina, after leading an independent life, moved in with her in laws. When the former sex symbol was asked how she felt about staying in a joint family system, she said, â€œI have all the freedom that I want. If at all there is a restriction, it has been put by me.

Instead of keeping Brigitte in the background, the youthful 39 year old French President confidently flaunts his youthful looking 65 year old wife everywhere and has proclaimed that anyone who doesn’t understand their union is a “misogynist and homophobe.” Let’s take a closer look at this unusual marriage\n\nBy Mahlia Lone\n\nEmmanuel Jean-Michel FrÃ©dÃ©ric MacronÂ was born in the northern French town of Amiens in 1977. At that time, his future wife Brigitte was already a married woman with a two year old toddler son and a baby daughter born the same year. The son of a physician, FranÃ§oise NoguÃ¨s andÂ Jean-Michel Macron, professor ofÂ neurologyÂ at theÂ University of Picardy, Emmanuel was a bright and precocious boy.Â Raised in a liberal, non-religious family, Macron insisted to his parents on being baptized a Roman Catholic at the age of 12 since he attended a French privateÂ Jesuit school, the JesuitÂ LycÃ©e la Providence. At the tender age of 15, he met the love of his life, his drama teacher, Brigitte who was also the mother of his friend and fellow pupil Laurence Azuiere..\n\nBrigitte Marie-Claude Trogneux came from a well off family of generational chocolatiers. Their multi million dollar successful enterprise Chocolaterie Trogneux with a turnover of â‚¬4 million wasÂ founded in 1872 in Amiens is famous for its delicious macaroons.. The family business is now run by Brigitteâ€™s nephew and has been renamed Jean Trogneux.\n\nEmmanuel as a precocious boy in Amiens\n\n“Here is my Brigitte at the school (the private Jesuit LycÃ©e la Providence in Amiens) where we met. She was my acting teacher”â€”Emmanuel Macron\n\nThe kiss at the end of the\n\ntheatre production that sparked their physical relationship\n\nBrigitte was the youngest of her parentsâ€™ six children. In 1974, she married a banker AndrÃ©-Louis AuziÃ¨re with whom she had three children: SÃ©bastien, an engineer, cardiologistÂ Laurence and Typhaine AuziÃ¨re, a lawyer who now works for Macron. In the â€˜80s, Brigitte AuziÃ¨re taught literature at the CollÃ¨ge Lucie-Berger inÂ Strasbourg. At the end of the decade, she unsuccessfully ran for the city council ofÂ Truchtersheim, before moving back to her hometown in northern France with her familyÂ in theÂ â€˜90s. There she joined the LycÃ©e la Providence as a teacher for French literature, Latin and drama. Young Macron was also her student in her drama classes.\n\nEmmanuel Macron at the Lycee de La Providence\n\nâ€œA perfect young manâ€\n\nMacron was an unusual teenage boy with dishevelled hair and an innocent, penetrating look who enjoyed reading and was wise beyond his years. He lived in his own world of â€œtexts and words.â€ Emmanuel was breezing through â€œLa Proâ€ (as the school is known) and did not seem interested in girls. His parents remembered only one girlfriend who visited their home just once.Â â€œShe was the same age, she was sweet; she was the daughter of a local doctor and a friend of ours. It lasted a few months,â€ his father said.\n\nTrogneaux family chocolaterie in Amiens\n\nThe French joke that theyâ€™ve had the macarons dâ€™Amiens for generations, and now they have the Macron dâ€™Amiens\n\nMacron admitted in his autobiographyÂ RÃ©volution that the only two high points in his life were piano, which he plays very well but is largely self taught, and drama club. â€œIt was at secondary school, through drama, that I met Brigitte. It was surreptitiously that things happened and that I fell in love. Through an intellectual bond, which day after day became ever closer.Â Then emerged a lasting passion,â€Â he recounted in the book.\n\nAt her daughter Tiphaineâ€™s wedding\n\nBrigitte added that when she arrived at La Providence, â€œall the teachers were buzzing aboutÂ Emmanuel.â€ Her daughter, Laurence, also told her that Macron, her classmate, was â€œthat amazing guyâ€ who â€œknows everything about everything.â€ When he joined her drama club, Brigitte found herself drawn to his â€œexceptional intelligence, a way of thinking that I had never ever seen before.â€ She was 40 and having a mid life crisis of sorts married to a banker specializing in international finance who often travelled away for work. Theirs was an average, comfortable, middle-class life and she must have been yearning for attention, even from a nubile young boy. Itâ€™s interesting to note that Brigitte hardly mentions her ex-husband and brushes that part of her life under the carpet. Known for her quick wit and sharp tongue, she is ready to retort if anyone hints at any impropriety on her part.\n\nLe Figaro journalist Anne Fulda meticulously researched and chronicled the love affair in her new book Emmanuel Macron: a Perfect Young Man, The teacher and her pet student would have long discussions and, impressed by his writing, she would read out his work to the class. â€œShe used to recite his work all the time. She was totally captivated by his writing skills,â€ a former classmate told Le Parisien newspaper.\n\nThey became even closer when they co-authored a play. Brigitte confided in a friend years later: â€œThe writing became an excuse. I felt that we had always known each other.â€The night the play was staged, the teacher gave her pupil a kiss on the cheek, sparking the love affair.Â Macron has described it as â€œa love often clandestine, often hidden, misunderstood by many before imposing itself.â€\n\nMadame Auziere reportedly started meeting her star pupil for trysts at homes belonging to her family, though they both deny that the relationship became physical till he was 18, the legal consensual age between teacher and student in France. Mr. Macronâ€™s parents became troubled by the rumors flying around about their sonâ€™s infatuation with a woman twice his age. The Macrons had been under the impression that their son was dating Mme Auziereâ€™s daughter, until a family friend let the cat out of the bag. When one of Emmanuelâ€™s friends, at whose grandmotherâ€™s home near Chantilly where he was supposedly studying for his baccalaureate exams, called to organise the coming weekend, Francoise realised that â€œManuâ€ who called her every day to tell her about her sonâ€™s day was not actually in Chantilly.Â She smelled something fishy.\n\nDinner with the King of Spain, summer of 2015\n\nJean-Michel said he â€œalmost fell off his chairâ€ when he discovered their son was instead in a relationship with the mother not the daughter. â€œWhen Emmanuel met Brigitte, we certainly did not say â€˜How wonderful!â€™â€At the end of the week, his father went to the station to collect his son on his supposed return from a weekâ€™s revision with friends. At home, his parent confronted him.\n\nâ€œWhat mattered to me was not the fact he was having a relationship with Brigitte but that he was alive and that there werenâ€™t any problems,â€ his mother said later.\n\nBut that is not how Emmanuelâ€™s father remembered it. He said it was mainly his now ex-wife who was â€œwound-upâ€¦ I figured, â€˜he would get over it.â€™ I wasnâ€™t worried, but Emmanuel still had to finish his schooling and not let it all go to waste.â€\n\nFranÃ§oise told Fulda: â€œWe just couldnâ€™t believe it. What is clear is that when Emmanuel met Brigitte, we couldnâ€™t just say â€˜Thatâ€™s great.â€™â€\n\nQuick witted and sharp tongued, Brigitte handles the jokes and satire on their age difference with humour, â€œHe (Emmanuel) needs to go for it (the Presidential race) in 2017 because by 2022, his problem will be my face,â€ she was quoted in Nicolas Prissetteâ€™s book Emmanuel Macron en marche vers lâ€™Ã‰lysÃ©e. Though she has not admitted to it, cosmetic surgeons speculate that she has had hair extensions, teeth veneers, botox and a mini facelift.\n\nTheir three story villa in Touquet, northern France\n\nSo they staged an intervention to ask Mme Auziere to back off from the affair. Francoise pleaded with her, â€œDonâ€™t you see? Youâ€™ve had your life. But he wonâ€™t have children with you.â€ In response, the errant teacher started to cry. Even when they asked her not to see their son until he had become an adult, she replied that she could not â€œpromise anythingâ€.\n\nNot knowing what to do, they tried to match-make him with a girl his own age, but their son too refused to comply. The illicit affair had tongues waggingÂ in the quiet, middle-class neighbourhood of Amiens where the respectable Jesuit school was located. Francoise recalled the reaction to the relationship from a woman at the reception desk of the hospital where she worked: â€œAh, but whatâ€™s going on! Iâ€™ve been thinking of you, itâ€™s terrible!â€ Left with no choice, the parents decided to send their son to one of the most demandingÂ sixth-form colleges in France, LycÃ©e Henri-IV in Paris, 90 miles (145km) away to get him away and make him focus on his work instead, hoping that he would forget.\n\nMacron believes in a secular state and defended the right of French Muslim women to wear the veil. Hence, the Grand Mosque of Paris urged the countryâ€™s Muslims to vote en masse for Macron as President\n\nMacron promised Brigitte that he would come back to find her, â€œI will come back and marry you.â€ Â She took him at his word. He continued to make clandestine trips back to his hometown to visit her in secret and when he was 18 and graduated from school, she followed him to Paris. According to what they have said to the press leading up to the election, Macron had only been in touch with Brigitte through letters and proposed marriage when her turned 18, the legal age when she could no longer be jailed for being in a sexual relationship with her minor student.\n\nUpon his return to Amiens after finishing school, he told his mother: â€œI still love Brigitte, if you understand that then all the better, because if not I am going not going to stop.â€ With no choice in the matter, Macronâ€™s parents reluctantly accepted.\n\nâ€œI had to fight in order to live both my private and my professional life as I wish,â€ Macron says. â€œI had to fight, and it wasnâ€™t the easiest or the most obvious, or the most automatic thing to do, nor did it correspond to established norms.â€\n\nâ€œStrength of conviction was required,â€ he said. â€œThey thought on several occasions that it was going to stop and naturally did everything to encourage that. In fact, I donâ€™t know how I myself would have reacted. It is very hard. An experience like that makes you think…You have to learn to fight for things, to bear the burden and have a life, which does not in any way correspond to other peoplesâ€™ lives. That was what we went through for 15 years. We managed to achieve the situation weâ€™re in today, because we knewÂ it was what we wanted. It didnâ€™t just happen all by itself.â€\n\nWhile Brigitte continued to teach in Paris, MacronÂ studied philosophy at theÂ University of Paris-Ouest Nanterre La DÃ©fense, obtaining aÂ DEAÂ degree (Master of Advanced Studies) and worked as an editorial assistant toÂ theÂ distinguished French ProtestantÂ philosopher, Paul Ricoeur. He obtained a masterâ€™s degree in public affairs atÂ Sciences Po, and trained for a senior civil service career at the Ã‰cole Nationale dâ€™AdministrationÂ (ENA), graduating in 2004.\n\nInÂ 2006, Brigitte finally divorced her long suffering husband and married Macron 18 months later. She was 54 and he 29. They got married in Touquet, northern France, in their country home where the couple often escapes to when not on duty in Paris.Â His best man wasÂ Henry HermandÂ (1924â€“2016), the same businessman who loaned â‚¬550,000 to Macron to buy his first apartment in Paris when he was Inspector of Finances in the Ministry of Economy\n\nDuring a BMFTV interview this April, Macron emphatically stated that he and his wife decided not to have any children. â€œWe have chosen not to have children. A choice that was not selfish for me. It is a choice that has been assumed, which I had to make very young given the age difference. I did not need my biological children and grandchildren to give them as much love as I gave them.â€ The couple has seven grandchildren from Brigitteâ€™s three offspring.\n\nAs Minister of Economy from 2004 to 2008, Macron focused on helping to improve French economic growth. In 2008, he paid â‚¬50,000 to buy himself out of his government contract and instead started to work as a highly paid investment banker at Rothschild & Cie Banque. In 2012, he was given a senior role inÂ President Hollandeâ€™s staff, and in 2014, he was appointed as theÂ Minister of Economy and FinanceÂ in the secondÂ Valls Cabinet, pushing through business-friendly reforms. At the Ministry, his wife remained a discreet presence during high level meetings. â€œShe spends a lot of time here because her view matters to me, because she brings a different atmosphere that is important. My life is here, you cannot work well if you are not happy,â€ Macron said after he resigned from the Hollande government in 2016.\n\nThe next year, Macron declared that he had quit the Socialist Party years ago and was an independent. He formally founded an independent, liberal and progressive political party,Â En Marche!, in Amiens in 2016 and resigned from the government. In his speech announcing his candidacy, Macron called for a â€œdemocratic revolutionâ€ and promised to â€œunblock France.â€ Pro EU and a safe alternative to the â€œneo Fascistâ€ Marie Le Pen, Macron gained many supporters from the Socialist Party, centrist and centre-right politicians. A New York TimesÂ article described Macron as â€œardently pro-Europe and who has proudly embraced an unpopular European Union.â€ Many foreign politicians such asÂ European CommissionÂ PresidentÂ Jean-Claude Juncker, German ChancellorÂ Angela Merkel and former US PresidentÂ Barack Obama publicly supported him as a Presidential hopeful, as did the French minorities.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron kisses his mother Francoise Nogues as his father Jean Michel Macron looks on\n\nWith Brigitteâ€™s mother\n\nMacron’s mother\n\nsaid that she sees Brigitte “more as a\n\nfriend than a\n\ndaughter-in-law.”\n\nWhere religion is concerned, Macron staunchly supports secularism (laÃ¯citÃ©). He said that â€œwe have a duty to let everybody practice their religion with dignity.â€ At the first meeting ofÂ En Marche!, Macron expressed opposition to the ban on Muslim headscarves in universities, â€œPersonally, I do not believe we should be inventing new texts, new laws, new standards, in order to hunt down veils at universities and go after people who wear religious symbols during field trips.â€\n\nIn an interview with the French news magazineÂ Marianne, Macron said that â€œsecularism is not designed to promote a republican religion.â€ He responded to comments made by other popular politiciansÂ regarding the practice of Islam in French society by condemning the notion that citizens should be â€œdiscreetâ€ in their religious practice, stating that â€œhistorical precedents when we asked for discretion in matters of religion did not bring honor to the Republicâ€¦.I ask one thing (of French Muslims): absolutely respect the rules while in public. Religious relationships are about transcendence, and I am not asking people to be moderate â€“ thatâ€™s not what Iâ€™m arguing. My own deep conviction is that a practicing Catholic may believe that the laws of his religion go far beyond the laws of the Republic. I simply believe that when one enters the public realm, the laws of the Republic must prevail over religious law.â€ He also condemned â€œreligious schools that teach hatred towards the Republic, with instruction mainly in Arabic or, in other instances, which teach the Torah more than basic fundamentals.â€ The Fonds Social Juif UnifiÃ© (FSJU), an organization that runs Jewish religious schools in France vociferously criticized this statement but theÂ Grand Mosque of ParisÂ urgedÂ French MuslimsÂ to vote en masse for Macron.\n\nBrigitte Macron was actively involved in her husbandâ€™s campaign as was her youngest daughter. A top adviser even told an interviewer that â€œher presence is essential for himâ€.\n\nâ€œShe spends all her time beside him, she reads and listens to everything that is said about him. He asks her questions and takes her advice,â€ the Paris Match magazine reported.\n\nIn an interview for Le Petit Journal, when asked why her husband was â€œso good at politics,â€Â she retorted, â€œHe is good at everything. Not just politics, youâ€™re being quite restrictive. Iâ€™m yet to find an area where he isnâ€™t good.â€\n\nMacron boldly told supporters that upon his winning theÂ French presidency, â€œIf Iâ€™m elected â€” no, sorry, when we are elected â€” she will be there, with a role and place that she always had with me, she will not be hidden.â€\n\nMacron formally became President on 14thÂ May 2017, the youngest person to ever be elected as President of France as well as the youngest French head of state sinceÂ Napoleon. That is not surprising because in France though a politician must not be financially corrupt, his sexual and personal life doesnâ€™t concern the public. In the past while in office, outgoing President Francois Hollande was caught having an affair with Julie Gayet, an actress nearly two decades his junior; former President Nicholas Sarkozy left his wife for the actress/musician/model Carla Bruni and even Jacques Chirac was nicknamed â€œfive minutes, shower includedâ€ for his matter of fact, business-like approach to extramarital dalliance.\n\nIn a country like the U.S. however, this would never have happened as the laws there are much strictly enforced where teacher student impropriety and underage sexual relations is concerned. Though the age difference between the Macron is about the same as that between Donald and Melania Trump, even the Donald would not have gotten away it had he seduced a fifteen year old Melania.\n\nBrigitte Macron was till 2015 teaching literature at the Ã©liteÂ lycÃ©e Saint-Louis de GonzagueÂ in Paris and now is expected to concentrate on education reform as Franceâ€™s First Lady. â€œShe will have an existence, she will have a voice there, a view on things. She will be at my side, as she has always been, but she will also have a public role,â€ Macron said.\n\nNot everyone bows down to them in deference. French cartoonists and comedians regularly mock the coupleâ€™s age difference, portraying Macron as a schoolboy being instructed by his teacher. Macron blames latent misogyny for their not understanding their relationship. Brigitte handles the satire well and has even joked that his president run better be while she still looks presentable. â€œHe needs to go for it in 2017 because by 2022, his problem will be my face,â€ she was quoted in Nicolas Prissetteâ€™s book Emmanuel Macron en marche vers lâ€™Ã‰lysÃ©e.\n\nMacronâ€™s unconventional marriage has also led some to speculate that heâ€™s secretly gay. As recently as February, he lightly dismissed rumors that he was having an affair with Radio France CEO Mathieu Gallet: â€œIf youâ€™re told I lead a double life with Mr. Gallet itâ€™s because my hologram has escaped.\n\nThe Macronâ€™s unconventional marriage seems to work for them better than many more traditional set ups. The moral of the story to take away from this may be: donâ€™t judge a book by its cover; or get them while they are young and make them dependant on youâ€”it all depends on your perspective. Either way, taking up with an underage student regardless of the level of your connection is still morally reprehensible in my opinion.\n\nRecently at this year’s Met Gala in NYC, Serena Williams made an entrance in a tight emerald green Versace gown highlighting her almost full term pregnancy bump. With diamond and emerald earrings dripping from her ear lobes and a huge grin lighting up her face, she was positively glowing. The tennis champ came on the arm of her brand new fiancÃ©, Reddit co- founder Alexis Ouhanian, who looked proud as punch to be with her. After a string of flopped romances, she is serenely happy with her 6’5″ “techie geek” because he lavishes her with love and attention. Here is how they met and love blossomed\n\nSerena Jameka Williams was born in 1981 inÂ a small Michigan town toÂ Richard WilliamsÂ andÂ Oracene Price. Both her parents were divorced and had children from their first marriages. Her mother had three older daughters from a previous union while her father had six children from his ex-wife. The couple got married in 1979 after Venus was born and then had their youngest child Serena. The family moved toÂ Compton, a rough, gang infested, primarily black, LA neigbourhood where Richard started taking tennis lessons from a coach fondly called Old Whiskey.Â He got so taken up by the game that one day, after watching womenâ€™s professional tennis being played on TV, he decided that his two toddler daughters would also become tennis professionals. He methodically wrote up a 78-page plan, and started giving lessons to Venus and Serena when they were only four and three respectively at public tennis courts. He now advises that six is the right age for a child to start receiving tennis lessons. To ensure that the girls had sufficient time to dedicate to the sport, he home-schooled them. Both he and their mother coached the girls in addition to another Compton tennis coach also called Richard Williams who went on to found The Venus and Serena Williams Tennis/Tutorial Academy in Compton. When local professional tennis playerÂ Tony ChestaÂ spotted Venus playing when she was nine, he was very impressed with her talent. Richard knew the girls needed access to better facilities.\n\nStep 2 was the Williamsâ€™ family relocating to West Palm Beach, Florida when the girls were ten and nine so that they could attend the famed tennis academy ofÂ Rick Macci. Macci is a United States Professional Tennis Association (USPTA) Master Professional, and seven-time national coach of the year who has in his illustrious career trained a few number one ranked players, namely Andy Roddick, Jennifer Capriati,Â Maria Sharapova, besides the Williams sister of course. To have him agree to coach a youngster means that child shows exceptional skill and promise. He agreed to give both Venus and Serena additional coaching at his academy. At times, Macci and Williams did not see eye to eye, but the former empathized with their father understanding that he â€œtreated his daughters like kids and allowed them to be little girls.â€\n\nBut then, Williams stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments after only a year when Serena turned 10 for two main reasons: firstly, he wanted them not to neglect their studies and, secondly, he had heard white parents talk about his daughters in a derogatory, racist manner during tournaments. Even though, at that time, Venus held a an astonishing 63â€“0 record on theÂ United States Tennis AssociationÂ junior tour and was ranked No. 1Â among the under-12 players in Southern California, and Serena held a 46â€“3 record and was ranked number one among under-10 players in Florida. Then, in 1995 when Serena was in the ninth grade, their father pulled his girls completely out of Macciâ€™s academy and took over all their coaching. When asked later why this happened and whether having followed the normal path of playing regularly on the junior circuit they would have become even better, Serena replied, â€œEveryone does different things. I think for Venus and I, we just attempted a different road, and it worked for us.â€\n\nWith their father\n\nThe Williams family\n\nMuch discipline, sacrifice and work ethic later, the two sisters dominated the tennis world. Everyone has seen the Williams sistersâ€™ powerful style of playing tennis, their bodies so strong and well built, they look almost super human. You can clearly hear the tennis ball as itâ€™s whacked powerfully by the racket and the sinews of their long limbs glisten with perspiration in the sun. It is an indeed an impressive sight. Both the sisters are not only tennis champs but credited with ushering in a new era of power and athleticism on the womenâ€™s professional tennis tour. TheÂ Womenâ€™s Tennis AssociationÂ (WTA) has ranked SerenaÂ world number oneÂ in singles on seven occasions from 2002 to 2017. On her sixth time, she held the ranking for 186 consecutive weeks, tying the record set byÂ Steffi Graff for the most consecutive weeks as world number one by a female tennis player. In total, Serena has been world number one for 318 weeks, which ranks herÂ 3rd in the Open EraÂ among female tennis players. Venusâ€™ sevenÂ Grand SlamÂ singles titles ties her twelfth on the all-time list,Â more than any other active female player except Serena.\n\nWith their mother\n\nSome commentators and sports writers regard Serena as the greatest female tennis player of all time, having set many records. Her total of 23 Grand Slam singles titles marks the record for the most Major wins by a tennis player in theÂ Open Era,Â and second on the all-timeÂ list. In fact, Serena is the only tennis player in history (man or woman) to have won singles titles at least six times in three of the four Grand Slam tournaments, and the only player ever to have won two of the four Majors seven times each (seven Wimbledon titles and seven Australian Open titles). She is also the only tennis player to have won 10 Grand Slam singles titles in two separate decades. Impressively, she holds an all-time record for the most singles matches won"
