The COMMUNITY CHURCHMAN VOL. IX. APRIL, 1929 NO. 1 COMMUNITY RELIGION By John Dunster Kettelle. While the governing bodies of our major protestant denominations are discussing the possibilities of organic union, or at least closer cooperation, a tendency of far- reaching significance may be observed in the so-called community church movement which is now making in- creasing headway especially in the smaller centers of pop- ulation. This movement is not only upsetting things gen- erally in the realms of denominational comity and polity, but is laying foundations for the development of a new and distinctive type of Christianity. The particular criterion by which a real community church may be recognized is not form of government or doctrine, but the general attitude and scope of its minis- try. In doctrine, the community church seeks breadth and inelusiveness, sometimes being content with a liberal interpretation of some historic creed, more often being bound by no creed of any sort. In government, the his- tory of the individual institution is the controlling factor. Some churches are the result of federations or mergers which condition usually leaves its distinguishing marks on the constitution and by-laws. Other churches are or- dinary denominational organizations which happen to be without ecclesiastical competition. In all cases, however, the form of organization is considered as a means to an end, and the end is the ministry of religion to the entire community. The novel aspect of the movement, and that which distinguished the true community church, is the catholicity of the appeal. The social, intellectual, creedal, moral, and other boundaries which have so often constitut- ed the lines of demarkation between the various religious bodies, are all levelled, and the effort is made to minister at once to all classes of people. Hitherto the Christian churches have been esoteric organizations, founded upon authority, endeavoring to save people out of the world more than to save the world. The authority may be ecclesiastical, as in the Roman Catholic Church, civil, as in the established churches of several European countries, or based upon Scriptural doc- trine, as in the various dissenting churches of protestant- ism. The esoteric character is manifest in the original motives of the world missionary enterprises, — which in- volved saving the heathen from the flames of hell, — and in the generally exclusive attitude toward the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper. On the other hand, when a church becomes a commu- nity church, the boundary line between “members” and “non-members” grows very nebulous indeed. An esoteric membership is a barrier to that sense of community .soli- darity upon which the success of the church largely de- pends. It will be found that often no distinction what- ever is made against non-members. They are not refused communion if they desire it. They are given a voice and vote in busine.ss meetings, and even elected to important offices. In one fairly flourishing church the clerk, treas- urer, and chairman of the business committee were all non-members in the technical sense. Furthermore, the community church must be extreme- ly tolerant and liberal in the matter of practice. If a Baptist desires to be immersed, that must be arranged. If an Episcopalian mother desires to be “churched” af- ter the order in the book of Common Prayer, that beau- tiful and impressive ceremony must be performed. Lit- urgy and freedom must be harmoniously combined in the service of worship. Sermons must have intellectual effort and literary merit in order to appeal to the educated members of the congregation, and yet must be direct and simple in order that they may be understood by the un- lettered. Every intellectual and social stratum of the community must be provided with some appropriate means of expressing its inherent religiousness within the church or it will withdraw and segregate itself. The real fore-runners of the community church movement are two comparatively recent developments within the ranks of liberal protestantism. These are the social gospel, and the doctrine of the authority of the in- dividual. The former has emphasized the importance of saving society as a whole if the individual is to prosper, thus paving the way for the conception of a ministry over a geographical area rather than to a selected group. The latter, which makes the individual the final arbiter of re- ligious problems in place of the church or the book, has more recently been qualified by placing upon the authority of the individual the controlling check of the social ex- perience. This social aspect, both of the work and the authority of the church, is the real foundation of commu- nity religion. The community church, then, emerges as an apotheo- sis of democracy. It is created by the people and for the people, and derives its religious sanctions from the so- ciety which it serves. If it is to exist at all, it must do two essential things, — attract the individual, and serve as an organizing force in society. In order to attract the in- dividiial, it must offer him the best thing possible, — the summun bonum. There is little doubt that from the .standpoint of the human being the summum bonum is more abundant life in one form or another, — that is, mag- nification of the worth and dignity of the self. If, on the other hand, the church is to serve as an organizing force in society, it must serve to remove the friction between individuals in their personal relations, and make the larg- er life equally and simultaneously available for all. In the apparent conflict of these two essential demands will be found the perpetual paradox of religion. “For who- soever will save his life shall lose it : but whosoever will lo.se his life for my sake, the same shall save it.” It will be charged that this view of the church leaves out the very essential element of divine authority. There are those who will claim that the voice of God speaks through the church, but the church is after all a human institution, and it is human vocal chords that make the voice articulate. There are also those who will claim that the will of God is made raanife.st in Holv Scripture, but the Bible is a human document. At least it has come to us through the agency of human minds and human hands in terms of human speech. How much more compelling is the authoritative voice of human need speaking out of the imperative urge of that life which no human being can create nor fully understand ! Surely this is the will of God, and the church and Bible are authentic only when they ring true to life. In the two-fold function of the community church THE CX)MMUNITY CHUECHMAN 4 • toward the individual and toward society as so far set forth, we find an opportunity to introduce a certain amount of legitimate science into the affairs of religion. The “self” and “society” are finite entities with definite- ly material aspects and as such are subject to systematic and objective study. Religion of the community type is defined by a specific functional relationship to these en- tities and thus is provided with a measure by which it may be tested and the course of its future progress be deter- mined. The validity of its hypothesis may then be es- tablished on the accepted basis of true science, that is, the reliability and accuracy of its predictions. No longer need we have recourse to the “inscrutable mysteries of God” to explain its failures. If it does not make good its promises of more abundant life we may be sure that there is something wrong with it. There is only one adequate method whereby religion may exercise its function to the self and to society, and that is through bringing the individual into relationship with God. Principal Jacks describes as a “Living Uni- verse” this whole in which every part is related to every other part. That is about as near as we can come to a sci- entifically valid conception of God. It is more than pan- theism as the man is more than the sum of the elements of which he is constituted. In dealing with the whole, we must consider the functional interrelationship of the parts. On the lowest plane we observe the relationship which we call gravitation connecting each particle with every other particle. On a higher plane we observe the bonds of affection and service which bind man to man. Our apprehension of God is a mystical experience which may be described as a conscious awareness of the relationship of self to that which is not self. Dean Sperry, lying on the deck of his sloop looked up at the sails and the sky and the fleeting clouds and said to himself “I am one with aU that.” We may understand the relationship intellect- ually, as when we trace the vibrations which impress this page upon our sense of sight back through the elec- tric lamp to the dynamo, and the coal mine, and finally to the energy of sunshine beating on the leaves of pre- historic forests milleniums ago. Sometimes there may be merely an unreasoned impression on our emotions, as when a minister, coming unbidden to visit our sick-bed, by this evidence of his devotion bears mute witness to our impor- tance to him and to our fellow men. In the task of bringing people into relationship with God, Jesus is of superlative importance. He is both a teacher and a symbol. He taught by precept and example. He told his followers that all men were brothers in that they were sons of their Heavenly Father. By his pres- ence in their homes, and his conversation with them, he proved that even publicans and sinners were important in his scheme of things, and that a certain unnamed wo- man, for performing a menial task, deserved a perpetual memorial. No wonder the common people heard him gladly who could so exalt even the humblest spirit! As a symbol, Jesus brings the universe within reasonable scope of our imaginations. “I am in the Father, and the Father in me. Who hath seen me hath seen the Father also.” Whoever could be consciously aware of his rela- tionship to Jesus could feel the same bond of unity with God. Both experiences were essentially the same. The last and deepest bonds which joined him with humanity were those of suffering and death. By the same bonds which bind us to him, we are bound to each other. There is an implied identity in the commandment “Love thy neighbor as thyself.” With the growing sense of mystical relationship to God and to the world of men, the individual assumes the cross of Christian responsibility. The problem of evil is too pressing to be solved by the easy doctrine of retri- bution and reward after death. Life is seen to be the greatest gift of the Creator, and the only opportunity to redeem it, of which we can be sure, is the present. Thus, with a new faith in the possibilities of men, and a firmer conviction that they are dealing with essential veriti^ the prophets of community religion are setting them- selves in earnest to carry on the work laid down by Jesus, the task of trying to fashion here and now, out of the life-stuff of humanity, the ideal brotherhood of the mas- ter’s dream, — the kingdom of love and truth. THE TREK OF DENOMINATIONALISM By Doris Olds White. Trek, according to a small dictionary I have at hand, is “to travel by wagon, especially, in search of a new stttlement.” This definition makes trek exactly the word to describe, not only the movement, but also the major cause of the movement which denominationalism is making today. Subconsciously some of us have sensed it, but the majority of us have been sublimely unconscious of the real force which is carrying us steadily to a new settlement. Whether we like it, or not, we are moving away from our schisms to a common expression of the Christian religion. Eventually, mayhap, we shall be car- ried to a common world religion, a very new and strange settlement, indeed, for many of us. I believe that a full consciousness of this force would carry with it the solu- tion of one of our greatest modern problems in religion. To return to my definition once more “a wagon” is most literally and prosaically this particular force. Within our land a daily trek of individual and fami- ly is moving back and forth from hamlet to city, from north to south, from the neighborhood of one race to the neighborhood of another. By farmer’s cart, by “tin Lizzie”, by great moving van, by special train, moving, — treking, — by one sort of wagon or another our restless people search new settlements. Mark this! In every moving wagon from which you see the household furniture protruding, however quaint or queer, however rural or urban, in the trappings somewhere is hidden the family or household god. What happens when the trek is ended and the new settlement is found? Furniture is adjusted to new rooms; hair is cut to a local pattern; skirts and trousers finally conform to a local cut. With great protesting the Michigan palate even learns to like Boston baked beans. But what of the gods ? Where shall they be set up I Can a Lutheran god with his dignity and beauty be made to feel at home in a Free Methodist meeting house? Can the Presbyterian god with his Scotch back-bone be forced to bend beneath the Baptist waters in order to fit into the new home? This is exactly the problem of Protestant Christianity today. Also, I believe, this is the major force which is undermining denominationalism and forcing us to a new unity. Our scholars and theologians are discoursing learnedly on a new and modern interpretation of the gos- pel of Jesus which they say is bringing us unity. But whence comes this new understanding? Why are the THE COMMUNITY CHURCHMAN 5 common people, even before the scholars, awaking to it? Simply because the wagon roads of our land are carry- ing us to new settlements where we are forced to rub elbows, eat, sleep, and work, with people whose gods are dressed differently from ours. Because the problem is more acute in small settlements they are being forced to a solution sooner than the cities. To make the matter con- crete, and to establish the fact, not merely the theory of my thesis, let me give you an example which has come under my own personal observation. A small New England village with its records racing back almost three hundred years is having to meet this very prevalent situation and is typical of the entire country, I believe. For its first two hundred and fifty years a common stock of English ancestry farmed the land, made the roads, ran the country stores, provided the town officers, and sup- ported two denominational churches. Families lived here from generation to generation, and sons, for the most part, followed in their fathers’ footsteps. The present chairman of the board of selectmen can find his family name repeating often in the old records of the town. As with the trades and lands of the people, so with their church. While now and then some head-strong youth might choose a bride from the other denominational fold and cause a small ripple in the placid waters, almost never was the town even visited by an individual of some out- landish or heretical denomination. Gradually, as the steam train brought them through the valley, other folk began to arrive and the call of tbe far settlements began to take away the native born, even as ti has done all over the country. The local Methodists finally dwindled in numbers and few new Methodists came in. The Baptists had a little better luck, but not much. Then a few years ago a paper mill began bringing in people from far countries, — New Jersey Germans, Penn- sylvania Dutch, people from the Middle West, even from across the seas from Sweden, not to mention the French Canadians, a few Italians and some Polish folk who are carefully shepherded by an Irish Catholic Father. Prot- estants from some fourteen or more denominations, Luth- erans, Christians, Congregationalists, Episcopalians, with here and there a Baptist or a Methodist! These people seemed foreigners to the native New Englanders; their speech was strange; their food with its “scrapple” and odd flavors seemed almost heathenish ; and their household gods entirely strange. Some few of them with life-long habits of church-going tried to make themselves at home in the Baptist meeting mouse, but not very successfully. The cheerful neighborly Christianity of these foreign folk seemed lacking in spiritual depths to the austere, na- tive born New Englanders. Almost a feud arose between the two factions, but it was necessary for them to buy and sell food, fuel, and homes from one to another. The old intermediary of trade and barter wore away at the edges of the differences. The children played together and visited one another’s homes. A funeral in some home called forth a sympathy which found, surprisingly, the common strain of Christianity underneath the foreign cloak. Now and then, a marriage was celebrated be- tween native and outlander. Gradually, in the wake of this trek came the dawning realization of the unifying facts of a common Christianity. Simply, and with the vision of just common people, a community consciousness of this likeness came about. No scholars or theologians came to explain to them the sub- tleties of a common gospel, but in the ordinary human contacts they discovered it for themselves. With very little ostentation, with sympathetic support of nearby clergy, with some faint opposition from denominational headquarters, a community church was born and is today succeeding in a truly marvelous way. We are a nomadic people, born of a race which trek- ed many miles to a wild, new land. We have in the past adjusted ourselves to many untried and difficult en- vironments. At one time the difficulties were those of physical environment, of virgin forest, of wild animals, of impassable ways. Today the diffieulties of our en- vironment are spiritual. We have to adjust ourselves to the enclosing walls of a humanity' which is foreign to our upbringing, and often to our taste. We are making the necessary adjustments. The corners of our intellec- tual bodies are worn off. Especially, our ymuth of today, often by a process of evolution, I suppose, is being born without the corners. Straightway, with their hammers they attack the corners on their elders and it is true that the results are sometimes grotesque and, more often, pathetic. But out of the rough-hewn shines a vision. It is no fun for the older people to be hacked and hammered in this fashion. Just here, I want to put in a word of sympathy and perhaps, encouragement for our harassed, but loyal denominational leaders. I do not believe that it is pure cussedness that makes our denom- inational secretaries appear so reactionary and un- Christian in their attitude toward community churches and like union movements. In a revealing moment to- wards midnight in our rural parsonage study, one de- nominational leader gave us more than an inkling of the difficult situation in which he finds himself. He has given a vigorous and loyal life of service to the Baptist denom- ination. He is really conservative in his theology. The form of baptism in his church is to him deeply significant and beautiful, and while not literally a sacrament, very closely akin to it. He indicated how torn he is between those who would move too fast and those who would never move at all. He acknowledged that the trend towards union and common worship was growing stronger, — per- ceptibly stronger as the younger generation was getting into the organization harness. Then he said rather wist- fully, “But I hate to have the world lose our form of baptism. I can’t help but feel that it contains something worth while.” Evidently the constant hammerings of the youthful enthusiasts were making him almost doubt the religious significance of an experience which in his heart he knew had been vital and true for himself and thousands of others. It will be tragedy if this trek to new settle- ments irretrievably wounds our older Christians, or if it breaks into fragments the beautiful rites, or litanies, or imageries of our denominations. But here is the hope! On an Easter Sunday not long ago in a small community church, the pastor baptized a number of people, some by immersion and some by sprinkling. After it was over one man who was sprinkled said to another who was immersed, “If I had realized what immersion really was, I would have chosen that form of baptism.” By hearsay, immersion had been some- thing funny to him, but in his owm church, by his own pastor, its beauty and significance are evident and appeal- ing. So it is bound to be with all our cherished differ- ences. If there is anything fine about them it will in- evitably be recognized and eherished in a community church. The community church is a new development to- wards which our great denominations are treking, reluct- antly, mayhap, but carried along by Packard limousine and gipsy barge, they are powerless to turn back. This movement is not only a real boon to Christianity, but tru- ly the greatest opportunity for the deep realities of the denominations to find ultimate expression. They may not pause ; they must move on. THE COMMUNITY CHDECHMAN THE SECRETARY’S OBSERVATIONS By J. R. Hargreaves. The action of the recent board meeting of the Com- munity Church Workers, as taken in response to the over- ture of the Home Missions Council and the Federal Council is being brought to your attention in the report of the North Canton sessions of March 12 and 13. At this juncture may I write a few lines about a trip to Minn- esota, Kansas, and Oklahoma taken in company with Dr. Morse of the Home Missions Council. At a comity conference held in Cleveland a little more than one year ago, a plan of service called the Five Year Program of Survey and Adjustment was initiated. The intent of said program calls for a survey, within t^ve years if possible, to discover the location and arrangement of churches, as now exist in the several states. It also looks towards the adjustment of churches to local needs. In this last part we are now obligated to render service and leadership. In Minneapolis, Minnesota, we met with the comity committee of the State Council of Churches and a sur- vey of ten counties was agreed upon and planned for. In some ways Minnesota is one of the most difficult of the northern states for the work of a committee on sur- vey and adjustment. There are a great many Lutheran churches, and so far few of them have shown much sym- pathy with interdenominational effort; the emphasis on doctrinal points, commonly described as fundamentalism and modernism, is more pronounced in Minnesota than in other middle west states and is an obstacle to coopera- tion; also the Catholic element is very strong. These things all stand in the way of organized community re- ligious work. On the other hand there is a spirit of deter- mination, manifest in many Minnesota church workers which is very pronounced. Leaders in education are de- voted to community betterment, and that along religious lines. Only yesterday I was asked by the dean in the de- partment of agriculture of the state university suggesting how their appointments and faculty might be used to the advantage of rural churches and rural ministers in a coun- try life conference or short course. The preparing of this letter will be my next task. The country life department of the Y. M. C. A. is active and well managed and wants to be an asset to the churches. The superintendent of that work is a member of the committee which is conducting the survey. He feels the need of united church effort on behalf of country boys and is working diligently to that end. I have a letter from him asking our cooperation. These and other marks of concern give promise of ad- vancement in community religious effort in Minnesota. In Kansas there is a much better organized Council of Churches than in Minnesota. Dr. Ross Sanderson is its very energetic and resourceful leader. Our meeting was held in Wichita and was well attended by men from different parts of the state. Kansas has a spirit of in- dependence all its own. This is manifest both in the political and religious sphere. In the church realm we must admit that their characteristic self sufficiency has a basis in a rather striking initiative. This showed itself in a new suggestion, coming from one of the superin- tendents, which looks to the organization of a state group of trustees for the temporary control of the property of federated churches. Those who are familiar with the property difficulties in such kind of organizations will hope they are originating something practical. When the proposed joint committee of the Federal Council, Home Missions Council, and Community Church Workers was described a motion looking to the forming of a corres- sponding state committee was presented and the idea adopted. In this action Kansas initiated a plan for other states to follow. In the Kansas survey, the department of sociology of the agricultural college will play an important part. An exhibit of the kind of work they do in this line was pre- sented by one of the students. As in Minnesota, commu- nity social and religious welfare seems to have a large place in the minds of Kansas teachers. I was impressed by a remark of Prof. Burr, of the Kansas State College. He said in substance: “In developing the application of the sense of cooperation among farmers the agricultural colleges do not want to be guilty of developing a non- church-supporting group, but such will be the case unless the divisive attitude of the rural churches can be over- come.” In the state of Kansas there is a large place for the influence of the community religious movement, and wise effort will be met by practical response on the part of many of the church leaders. In Oklahoma we entered the border land of the south, and came into contact with southern church feel- ing and method of organization. The comity committee, which is the survey committee, fully appreciate the local needs : they also realize that their task must be conducted with patience and due regard for past traditions. The approach to any very extensive adjustment of church con- ditions will need to be initiated through the development of the larger parish system. There are a few places which may permit of federation and in isolated eases the inde- pendent church may be the solution, but in most of the districts the many church organizations are destined to continue for a considerable length of time. The differ- ent church memberships will need to get acquainted by working together in some common community task before they will trust each other in any ventures in church mer- gers. In this connection I have a request from the dean of the extension department of the state agricultural col- lege asking us to consider the lending of assistance in the organizing and temporary support of a demonstration county work in a locality not far from Oklahoma City. The idea is to engage a leader and put on some program of community interest in which each church can have some deflnite share. The suggestion has points of similarity with the larger parish plan now being so successfully worked in Maine. I hope we may be able to lend some assistance in this possible plan of approach to Oklahoma’s problem. In the meeting at Oklahoma City I heard a very strik- ing illustration of the text found in II Kings 18:23, “I will give you 2000 horses if thou be able to set riders on them.” A district superintendent of the Methodist church told of an oil region in which there was a consolidated school. In this district there is a small Methodist and a small Baptist church. The two churches have Bible schools averaging about 25 each. The public school sup- erintendent offered a challenge to my Methodist friend as follows: “I will call out the school wagons on Sunday mornings and will agree to furnish you with 350 people for two hours of Bible school and church service if your churches will agree to put on programs which will make it worth While. ’ ’ In this sincere offer we see on the part of this Oklahoma school man a like interest to that which (Continued on page 9) THE COMMUNITY CHURCHMAN 7 EDITORIALS CHAIN CHURCHES In a recent issue of Harper’s Magazine an old-time hardware dealer tells what has happened to his home town through the chain store. The future he pictures for the ordinary village in America is far from bright. In place of the store-owner is now a hired man sent out last month by a corporation in some metropolitan city and who may be sent on next month to another city. This man is not at all interested in the town where he lives right now because he does not expect to live there very long. He hopes for a promotion. The old-time store-keeper contributed to community enterprises. But when the charity drive is put on now the request for a donation goes to some office in New York and Chicago and after the drive is over, the reply comes back that the system does not contribute. The old-time store-keeper was bound to take into account all the factors that made for community prosperi- ty over a term of years. He was interested in a new fac- tory. He joined the commercial association or the Kiwan- is Club. But the new store manager must have quick results in order to get his promotion. He is willing to for- get future values in order to cash in right away. Eventually the town that loses its local business men will not be mueh of a town. It will lack initiative, sta- bility and vision. And no wonder that an old-time busi- ness man views with alarm the new tendency. Perhaps the chain store systems will get top-heavy after awhile. They may be rendered inefficient by their very bigness. Or perhaps the socialist is right. After they get big enough to become an oppressive monopoly, the govern- ment will take them over. It is not our concern right now to settle that question. The other day a minister commenting on the situation said, “The next thing we will hear of is chain churches.” And the retort of his auditor was prompt. “That is just what we have now.” The big denominational systems have been rapidly concentrating their authority since the war. Even those denominations that have boasted most of their freedom and democracy have ways of getting the same kind of results that are attained in the highly organized ecclesias- ticisms. The end sought in every case has been the same, the chain church. There are things to be said for the chain church, just as there are for the chain store. So long as a chain groc- ery system can save the customer ten per cent on his grocery bill, it is likely that the chain grocery will do a thriving business. People are short-sighted and the im- mediate saving is real, while the development of communi- ty values is intangible. And the chain church makes its appeal. The chain church is much more sure of a minister. Closely hooked up with an ecclesiastical system, it will not need to wait long for a man. And the chain church has a program all the time. It is true that the program was made in New York or Chi- cago and its goal is quite outside the local community, but it is a program. And that is better than just drifting. But perhaps it is here that the advantages end. The effect on the chain minister is the samea s it is on the chain store manager. He is working for his promotion. He never takes root in a community. His eye is on the next town with a hundred dollars increase of salary before his goods are unpacked. His church policies are arranged for quick results. It would be of no use to make any oth- er plan for perhaps the next man would not carry it out. So he stampedes little children into church membership without teaching them anything. Or he rushes his church into a building enterpi'ise and leaves the next man to wor- ry with thedebt. Why should he worry about the commu- nity problems of health, education, good government or charity when he is sure to be on his way before anything constructive could be done for these interests. And the chain church is itself concerned with other than community values. It is of more importance that the Piggly-Wiggly denomination should be advanced than it is that conditions should be improved in Smithville. The chain church is led to believe that there is some pe- culiar sanctity attaching to saving souls in Africa or in Utah which does not attach to saving souls in Smithville. The Piggly-Wiggly denomination must be carried around the world. Not to believe this is to be guilty of the most damnable heresy. To leave any section of the globe for the A. and P. denomination would be sin against the Holy Ghost. Now one need not jump to the conclusion that every denominational minister is a chain minister and every de- nominational church a chain church. There are still a lot of churches left who believe that they ought to develop their owm program and learn to “fear God in their own vinllage.” It is so common-place that every town thinks that it is peculiar. It is. This diversity is God’s way. No two leaves on a maple tree are exactly the same. And no two communities are the same. Any minister who is independent enough to refuse to accept a program from the outside when he knows it does not fit his town, has ceased to be a ehain minister. And any church that finds its first loyalty to the folks around it rather than to a big potentate behind a mahogany desk in some distant city has ceased to be a chain church, even though it may cooperate in many common enterprises with other church- es and be written down in some denominational year book. The troubles of the old-time grocer are not without their suggestiveness to the churches. He let the dust ac- cumulate on the shelves. His stock did not turn over of- ten enough so that the bacon became rusty. If the old- time grocer wants to stay in the field, he will have to move his old-stock over into a wash-basket and make a sale on it. He will have to find out what people eat now- days and lay in a stock. And all of this suggests the peril of some independent churches, often isolated from the currents of American religious life. These sometimes keep musty old goods on their shelves after the chain churches have gotten rid of them. We know ministers in union churches too reaction- ary to live a year in any one of the leading denominations. These are by no means contributing to the development of the new community spirit. They are trying to sell shop-worn goods at high prices, and they will not for very long get away with it. Whether a church is connected with a denomination is not the real question. The people are asking. Is our town minister a prophet in his own right, or does he preach canned sermons sent out by denominational offic- ials? Is the local church truly devoted to community in- terests, seeking the unity and cooperation of all the forces 8 THE COMMUNITY CHURCHMAN that make for the up-building of human life, or is it just a cog in a big machine? Nowhere is the chain breaking down so rapidly as in the church life of America. Missionary societies with their big money drives now report dwindling resources. That is too bad. The work they are trying to do in the world is for the most part the Lord’s work. But their eagerness for quick results has led them to neglect their home base. Only strong, independent, resourceful church- es with a contented ministry can underguird a program of world evangelization. There are some signs that the Christian leaders of America are about to discern this fact. COOPERATION OF CHRISTIAN FORCES As related in our news columns the Community Church Workers have voted to cooperate with th'C Home Missions Council in a Five Year Program of Survey and Adjustment. Without in any way impairing its autonomy the Christian Church Workers will join forces with the Federal Council of Churches and the Home Missions Coim- cil in an effort to study in some adequate way the problems of over-churching and the methods of meeting these prob- lems. This arrangement is advantageous to all organizations concerned. The Community Church Workers now has an established place in the Christian world. Its relation- ship to the Protestant scheme of things is not that of a denomination taking a place among denominations but rather that of a service agency taking a place among ser- vice agencies. And from this on it should be increasingly bad taste for religious men to indulge in the forms of criticism which have been given this organization in re- cent years. And the advantage to the Home Missions Council is that by this cooperation it shows a willingness to work on a broad platform without being committed in advance to any one single method of adjusting church situations. With their vast resources, the home missions forces of America could do very much to meet the problems of com- munity organization once they set to work seriously in this direction. This generous step will increase the pres- tige of home missions. The secretaries of the Federal Council of Churches have for several years attended the conferences of the Community Church Workers. We would not commit them to an endorsement of everything the Community Church Workers have sought to do. But at least they have shown a fraternal desire to understand and a Chris- tian willingness to cooperate where cooperation was pos- sible. The new cooperation may be credited in part to their leadership. The new arrangement is not a merger but a coopera- tion. A merger would have been opposed in many com- munity churches. But a cooperation wiU be welcomed. CROWDS Where do the big crowds of human beings congregate in America? A prize fight will assemble as many people as the inauguration of a president. A foot-baU game will put to shame the greatest lecturer in the world in the size of assembly. And the movie show often has the edge on the church in the number of people reached. The Chau- tauqua has sadly declined in attendance and is driven to vaudeville to hold what crowd it has. The lodges have a declining membership in many states and are more trou- bled than the church about the small number of people that come out. The luncheon clubs resort to drastic dis- cipline. “Four absences and you are out” is the rule of one of them. Two modern inventions work against the assembling of crowds. These are the automobile and the radio. There is a new cult of nature-worship on the part of the city man. He and his family are seeking the beauty spots that are round about. And the radio allows the man to sit around the house in slippers with his feet up in the air while he listens to music and lectures. But the story is not quite so bad as it seems. If there was a prize fight once a week, it would soon dwindle in attendance to the proportions of a church congregation. Foot-ball draws from a large area of many cities to make its impressive showing, and even the college towTi seldom has more than four or five match games a season. In a mid-western city that we know, the churches of the com- munity with hteir various mid-week meetings pile up an attendance record that just about equals that of the movie show. It is neck and neck between them. The wonder is that the church with so little of the sensational and depending on spiritual appeal is able to do so well as it does. It argues an eternal vitality in its re- ligion that this is true. EIGHT YEARS OF EVENTFUL HISTORY With this issue. The Community Churchman sets out upon the ninth year of its history. The journal started as a quarterly down in Missouri. The editor of the journal, at that time David R. Piper, had to create the first List of community churches ever assembled in America. The task involved the process of getting ministers strange to one another to cooperate in a publishing venture. What sacrifices were made in those early years is now well known to most of the men in this movement. The editors of the Community Churchman were in- strumental in securing the first national conference of community churches out of which grew the Community Church Workers. It is a simple matter of history that the paper has been indirectly responsible for the founding of many new churches. Hardly a day passes that some man in a new community does not write for literature on the communi- ty church movement. The paper has been one of the most important of the mediums for conveying to this man the information that he seeks. The development of mutual acquaintance among the churches has also been a most important service. The ministers in the community church movement are no long- er strangers to each other. And the movement has needed a voice in the larger Christian world. Ungenerous attacks have been made on community churches. That is no longer safe. There is now a journal to answer these attacks. Perhaps the most important service of the paper has been the development of a philosophy of the community church movement. This has been not simply the work of the editors, but of our contributors as well. We know that the community churches are here and are rapidly in- creasing. But what is their significance and where are they going? We need a journal in which this shall be worked uot. Mr. Morphett was in England this summer and stood in the cleft of the rock where Toplady stood for shelter from the storm, which incident caused Toplady to write that great hymn of the church: “Eock of ages cleft for me Let me hide myself in thee.” The place where this rock is, is Burrington Combe, near Bristol, England. THE COMMUNITY CHURCHMAN 9 THE SECRETARY’S OBSERVATIONS (Continued from page 6) I observed in some teachers in Minnesota and Kansas. In the proposal there is a suggestion to ministers and church leaders of a great opportunity in present day desire, if, through the spirit of cooperation we can but rise to meet it. There also comes this question — will we so organize as to meet the challenge of our opportunity, or will it stand there to mock us? “I will give you 2000 horses if thou be able to set riders on them.” To the outside observer the above described chance looks easy: to my new friend it is not so easy. Old habits, old prejudices, will have to be overcome before these little churches can so join their energies as to make it worth while for 350 people to attend their service.s. AVe will try to find some way of rendering assistance in such cases as this. With the superintendent just mentioned and with others who attended the meeting in Oklahoma City, I ex- perienced a very pleasant fellowship, and was strongly assured that our cooperation would be welcomed. I look forward with more than ordinary pleasure to some defi- nite efforts in church adjustments in Oklahoma when the survey is completed. The moves, however, will have to be taken with a due regard for the present traditions in that region. The experience I just referred to was my first that far south. It is doubtless a fact that church adaptation to community needs will be slower and a bit more dif- ficult in the south than in the north. However, the rel- ative value of people to forms of organization is begin- ning to gain the attention of our southern brethren. Within a few days I have had two letters from the south, one of them from Georgia, asking about the forming of church mergers. One was from a Baptist minister: I fancy the other was from a Methodist. Not long ago I had' such an inquiry from an African M. E. bishop. If repre- sentatives from these two energetic denominations be- gin to discover that they can really associate in worship without sacrificing their loved principles, their zeal wiU soon overcome many community limitations. It is just possible that within ten years the south may lead in the community religious movement. They have this advan- tage— the people go to church in the South and when once groups come together the crowd will draw the greater crowd and revivals will naturally follow. This will reveal both safety and advantage in united effort and cause rapid spread of the community movement. In the North the making of adjustments is only part of our task ; after adjustment we will need to recall the church to the community which has so largely forgotten it. In closing permit me to say that I will be glad at any time to hear from readers of the paper. If in any way either myself or my associates who are members of the board can be of service we will be pleased to be called on.

DAILY DEVOTIONAL BIBLE READINGS The Book of Psalms is the finest for the development of per- sonal religion to be found in the entire Bible. It does not reach to the height of religious truth as expressed by Jesus, but it reveals the heart of man in his hours of greatest triumph and in his depths of despair. If you are following the suggested plan of reading a Psalm a day, you certainly have discovered by this time how true to life the Psalms are. Now that Easter, the high tide of the Christian Year, is past again, the call comes to each one of us for continued loyalty to Christ and His Church. The reading of a portion of God’s Word each day will aid us in keeping in touch with spiritual truth. “The Psalms are the response of the human heart to God’s revela- tion of Himself.’’ Week of April 21: April 21, Psalm 111.

UNIFORM SUNDAY SCHOOL LESSONS FOR THE MONTH AHEAD April 21 — “Comfort for God’s People’’ — ^Isaiah 40:1-11 In the words of this lesson we have before us one of the sublimest passages of the Old Testament. Against the dark back- ground of a wayward nation the prophet presents to us the com- forting and pardoning presence of God. He looks forward to the coming of a new day of righteousness. He is supremely con- scious of the abiding worth of God’s revelation of Himself. “The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, but the word of our God shall stand forever.’’ And here is a wonderful picture of the providence of God: “He shall feed His flock like a shepherd.’’ The theme of the first part of Isaiah is judgment. But the theme of the second part, of which chapter 40 is the beginning, is comfort and hope. Have you noticed the words “my people’’ and “your God’’? These gracious words from God, spoken by one of His prophets, brought a new hope to an exiled people. Today, in the exile of doubt, uncertainty, sin, these poetic words bring to us a message of cheer and joy. We are under God’s care. “As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I com- fort you’’ saith the Lord. April 28 — “The Suffering Servant of Jehovah’’ — Isaiah 52:13-53:12 The prophets of Israel were always looking forward. No mat- ter how dark the life of the present seemed, in the distance they saw a bright new day. In the words of this lesson the prophet looked forward to the coming of the world’s Saviour. George Adam Smith writes: “We assert, what none but prejudiced Jews have denied, that this great prophecy, known as the fifty-third of Isaiah, was fulfilled in One Person, Jesus of Nazareth, and achieved in all its details by Him alone.’’ The world’s need brought a divine Saviour, who suffered in- nocently, who suffered vicariously, who suffered patiently. Read the chapter again and see how true to the life of Jesus the prophet’s word picture is. “All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all.’’ Salvation cost the sacrifice of the Son of God. Through Him, His sacrificial life and death, and His triumphant resurrection, the way of victorious living has been clearly pointed out. “With His stripes we are healed. ’ ’ • ••••• May 5 — “What Hilkiah Found in the Temple’’ — II Chronicles 34: 1-33 When Josiah became king of Judah the nation was filled with idolatry and immorality. Josiah resolved to establish a new cov- enant and agreement with God. He desired to serve God and to have a godly nation. Heroically he undertook the task of ridding the country of idolatry and of repairing the House of the Lord. For this he sought the cooperation of the people. When re- ligious interest revives, there is a natural interest in making the house of w'orship attractive and beautiful. In the course of repairing the Temple, Hilkiah, the high priest, found a Book of the Law. Hilkiah had the book deliv- ered to the king. The reading of this temple copy of the Law made a great impression on King Josiah. It spurred him on in the regeneration of the nation. If finding the Book of the Law in an old chest in the tem- ple, and the reading of it, worked wonders in Josiah ’s time, the use of the Bible, with its clear teachings, with its message of individual and social righteousness, will work wonders today. ‘ ‘ The open Bible, read and spread, is the guarantee of spiritual liberty and religious living.’’ • -**** May 12 — “The Early Ministry of Jeremiah’’ — Jeremiah 1:1-10: 6:10, 11; 8:18; 9:2; 26:1-14 Jeremiah, like all of the prophets, was conscious of an inner call from God. He felt his own personal deficiency and lack of experience. Humility is the mark of a great life. God gave him assurance and strength and He does still. Jeremiah was a prophet of warning. He spoke boldly. Unless the people repented and turned to the way of the Lord, Jerusalem, a city rich and proud, was doomed to destruction. But Jeremiah was not received with favor. A plot was drawn up to put him out of the way. His message was regarded as an insult. It was declared that Jeremiah deserved to be put to death. But Jeremiah soon stated that the words that he had spoken were a message from God which it was his duty to deliver. He appealed to them to amend their ways. The people saved Jeremiah. He was saved because of his courage and fidelity. “The Lord will protect those who fearlessly defend His cause.’’ The message of a true prophet will always have a note of warning. America needs this warning today. To grow into a mighty enduring nation, we must follow the leadership of the great prophets of social righteousness and most of all Jesus, the Prophet of the Kingdom of God. How do we heed His message? YOUNG PEOPLE ’S TOPICS April 21 — “The Wonder of the Bible’’ — Isaiah 55:8-13. April 28 — “The Triumphs of the Bible on Mission Fields ’ ’—Rom- ans 1:16, 17.

The following article recently published on the finance sta- tistics of a New Jersey church has come into the hands of your editor and is so good we pass it on for your serious consideration or whichever way you may care to regard it. Ten cents a week, or the price of a soda, is enough for the Lord in the opinion of some of the families in a certain church in Montclair, N. J. There are other families who attend the church, and think it can get along without any financial help from them at all. The church budget according to a pamphlet recently is- sued, is $35,000. There are 408 families in the parish, and 145 families contribute nothing, leaving the total burden to the others. It is equally interesting to learn that there are 431 automobiles in the 408 families, or more than one automobile to each family. Here are some interesting items, which may have a familiar ring to the real workers in some other churches: Forty families pledge per year less than the cost of one tire. One hundred nineteen more families pledge per year less than the cost of two tires. ^ _ Five families pledged per week just the cost of two packages of “life-savers’’. Seven more families are happy to contribute per week the cost of one soda. Twenty-eight more families estimate the church ’s blessings per week equal to one admission to a Montclair movie (if one sat in the balcony). 'Twenty-two more families are content with a weekly gift of the cost of two and a half gallons of gas. How far will the ear go on that? Fifty-one families count it a joy to subscribe per week a sum equal to what many men spend in smoking one day. Forty-nine more families are satisfied -with a weekly pledge of the amount spent for one luncheon at a moderate-priced res- taurant. Why go further? One hundred and forty-five more families have pledged nothing. Their church membership being totally carried, their church dues entirely paid, by others. THE COMMUNITY CHURCHMAN 11 DECLINE or DENOMINATIONAL PAPERS “The slump in advertising does not account for the slump in circulation of denominational papers. That there has been a slump cannot, 1 think, be questioned, although I do not intend to sup- port the assumption with statistics. Dozens of denominational pa- pers have gone out of existence within the past twenty-live years. As I make a quick mental survey of the leading denominational papers still published, 1 can think of very few whose present circulation is comparable to that of a quarter-century ago; and I can think of many whose subscription list is one-half, one-third, and one-quarter what it was then. And even in the case of these denominational papers which have apparently maintained their subscription lists at their maximum level, it must bo pointed out that this is accomplished in most cases by resort to artificial pres- sure quite extraneous to normal journalistic methods. Subscrip- tions are secured by appealing not primarily to reader-interest but to the conscience of church people. They are asked to support the paper as a religious duty or as a matter of denominational loyalty. The result is that in addition to the great slump in num- ber of subscribers, there is an even greater slump in actual read- ing-interest on the part of those who loyally continue to pay the subscription price year ofter year. If the religious editors of the country could be endowed for one week with some clairvoyant power enabling them to follow every copy of that week’s issue to its destination, 1 fear they would be cruelly disillusionized to dis- cover how large a fraction of their subscribers do not read their papers at all! Ministers read them, and the small fraction of the laity who are more or less implicated in the rnnning of the de- nominational machinery; but it is a great assumption that a per- son who subscribes for a paper from a sense of religious or denom- inational duty is therefore a reader of the paper. What, now, is the explanation of this decline of reader-inter-’ est in denominational papers? Many explanations have been put forw'ard. I offer two explanations. One of these is so obvious that it hardly needs to be discussed. The other is somewhat tech- nical. I would suggest that the primary reason why denomina- tional journalism is waning is because people are losing interest in denominational religion. The other reason is that denomina- tional journalism is not and cannot be made journalistic in the true sense of that term. Let us consider the obvious reason first — that denominational journalism is waning because people are losing interest in denom- inations. By “people” I mean Christian people, not merely the outside world, but the members of the churches themselves. The compartment division of our Christian society is breaking down. Sectarian creeds and polities and traditions make less and less of an appeal to us. Few people today join the Methodist church because of the appeal of something which is distinctively Metho- distic. Few join a Presbyterian or Congregational or Disciples or Baptist church because they are attracted by something which is peculiarly the property of that particular denomination. Our church memberships are replenished by new members whose choices of denomination are determined by the most casual and incidental considerations. Their choices arise from neighborhood or social circumstances, or because they like the pastor, or better Jennie goes to that Sunday school. Hardly anybody joins a church to- day with any sense that he is committing himself to a denomina- tion that has a special mission in the world, a mission that may rightfully claim from him a support in terms which the church of another denomination across the street could not claim. Ho joins a church to be a Christian, not to be a Methodist or a Con- gregationalist or a Baptist. It is true that his family tradition strongly moves him toward a particular denomination, and other things being equal he will take a kind of pride in conserving that tradition. But this is a survival motive, not a vital motive. Our whole denominational order persists not on vital premises but on survival premises. The force that keeps it going was yenerated in the past. It is because it was. It runs on momentum, not on power generated in the living present. This being so, it is not to be wondered at that a journalism conceived and founded in a time when denominations meant some- thing vital, a journalism consecrated to the interpretation of the denominational point of view and to the strengthening and exten- sion of denominational interests, should seem drab and unappeal- ing to the mind of the average modern churchman. It is both amusing and pathetic to watch the desperate efforts of papers of this sort to exploit a denominational loyalty which does not exist. I have in mind a paper which is now devoting pages and pages of space to an elaboration of the slogan “South Africa for Christ 1” It seems that an evangelist of this denomination went to Johan- nesburg and held some revivals which resulted in the founding of a congregation or two. His “converts,” for the most part, were proselyted from the Anglican or the Dutch Reformed faith. Here now was a good journalistic opportunity. South Africa is a fresh field. China and Japan and India as mere mission fields have lost much of their journalistic value. But a movement to “win South Africa” has in it the possibilities of fresh adventure. It affords subject matter that has not been worn out. So the cry is raised that South Africa must be taken for Christ. It is not proposed that the social and political life of South Africa shall be appre- ciably affected by this invasion of an American denomination. Nor yet is it assumed that the American invasion will effect a higher order of personal religion than that which now obtains there. It is only proposed that the South Africans shall change their ecclesiastical status from Anglicans and Dutch Reformed to that of this American denomination. Thus South Africa will be taken for Christ! Now while it is somewhat discouraging to find that tliere exists any constituency at all to which such a project will appeal, it is heartening beyond expression to note how few there are who are taken in wdth such journalistic hokum. To people of ev'en modest enlightenment the attempt to identify an enterprise of mere denominational extension with the august slo- gan of taking South Africa for Christ is now recognized as an anachronism. The number of those who are sophisticated enough to penetrate the high-sounding and unctuous appeals in which de- nominational interests clothe themselves is rapidly increasing, and their multitudinous presence in all the churches tends to abash the ecclesiastical promoters, including denominational edi- tors, when they essay to use that outworn technique. But this illustrates the dilemma of denominational journalism. It is the dilemma of the denominations themselves, but with a dif- ference. A denomination is an institution gathering into itself the social and inherited interests of many people. Moreover, quite apart from its denominational peculiarities, it does function for great religious ends and values which it shares in common with all Christians. It can therefore go right on existing and func- tioning after its membership and the general public have lost in- terest in its denominational features. But a journal cannot do this. It depends for its vitality upon the instant and immediate interest of its public in the subject matter with which its pages are filled. Therefore the fadinp interest in denominations as such registers itself in the decline of interest in the denominational press much more quickly and appreciably than in any other aspect of denominational activity. — Dr. C.

One may well doubt that the boy problem has ever been studied from so many angles as in this book. A professional worker with boys whose educational training in a great university has been of the very best has combined the theoretical and the practical. Every Sunday school has a boy problem, which is in reality an adult problem. Given understanding, sympathy and right methods and the problem becomes the boy opportunity. Community churches are very scarce in Virginia, duo largely to the fact that for the most part it is made up of settled com- munities that also hiive settled likes and dislikes, particularly in religious matters. One such congregation, however, is being de- veloped at Bancroft, near Arlington, just across the Potomac river from Washington. This village has about 500 inhabitants, and various denominations had made unsuccessful attempts to estab- lish congregations when Rev. David Hicks appeared on the scene. He was a Congregationalist minister who had come south for his wife’s health and was doing special work for the Anti-saloon league. He suggested the organization of a community Sunday school, and gave his services for about six months to managing this Sunday school, not emphasizing any church or denominational lines. The plan has worked so well that they have now called him as a community pastor and are looking forward to the erection of a church building. No liturgical form of service is used, but the creed and Lord’s prayer are always included, and a plan for Lenten services called “The Fellowship of Prayer,” which is approved by the Federal council of churches, has been adopted for us. — Chris- tian Century.

THE COMMUNITY CHURCHMAN 12 •-» PREPARATION FOE LIFE’S GREATEST BUSINESS By Rufus M. Jones The true worshipper is one who rises to the positive experience of the real presence of God and who is bathed with the joy of that experience. The theologian seeks for right ideas about God; the worshipper seeks for God Himself. The former speaks of God in the third person — “He is”; the latter knows God in the second per- son— ‘ ‘ Thou art ’ and ‘ ‘ Thou art my God. ’ ’ It is, of all things, important to discover how to make this great ascent of soul and how to arrive at the meeting-place where the finite spirit becomes aware of its Divine Companion, though it must not for a moment be supposed that He is far away or in some other country — in the remote heights or in the unfathomable abysses. All that is really needed is to get ourselves into a true condition to discover that He is already there. “To arrive where God is,” as St. Augustine beautifully said, “is nothing else but to will to go — to will God entirely is to have Him.” The trouble is that most of us do not realize that this inten- tion to find God as a personal experience is the primary and es sential thing in religion. We have become so accustomed to sub- stitutes that we very easily fall back upon these substitutes and consider them sufiSeient. We content ourselves with hearing some- body talk about God, or with the theological account of Him, or with the enthusiastic hymn which gives us a moment’s thrill and exaltation as we rhythmically follow some earlier poet’s experience. What we need now is to go the next step and intensely seek God for ourselves. This intense attitude of heart, this positive in- tention of will, is absolutely essential for real worship. There will never be great meetings for worship until we come together ex- pecting, above all things else, to worship, to find God, to enjoy His real presence. It is well-nigh impossible to over-emphasize the importance of these matters of attitude and intention. We have found in our generation that the mental attitude works almost like a mira- cle even with the body. Our physical health is strangely bound up with our mental tone and with our expectations. The neuralgia which comes back at stated times, the sleeplessness which beseti us because we get to expecting it, are only too well known. Our very blood Uses are affected by our attitudes of joy and ex- pectation or by our discouragements and depressions. Immeasur- ably more is our spiritual experience shaped by what we expect and intend. We are all the time opening or closing the gates of our inner life to God. Most often we do it, as we do so many other things of our daily life, unconsc^musly or subconsiously. The set of our habits does it for us — the trend of our disposition, the inner atmosphere of our heart or mind or will or whatever else is deepest in us. The way to worship is to cultivate the habit of worship; the way to find God is to expect to find Him; the way to be flooded with the Divine Presence is to set the will and disposi- tion open in that direction. It is, therefore, very important to cultivate this habit in little children. They are very susceptible to spiritual realities; they feel the power of a living hush almost more than grown-up persons do; their inner gate is never in the early days quite tight shut, and any normal child can be trained to expect that His Heavenly Father will speak to him and be- come real to him. But if we older ones act as though we expected no such event, if we leave all this lofty inward experience out of our religion, and give no time nor scope for it in our gatherings, the little folks will naturally adjust themselves to our practical habits, and they will find their inner gate closed up like their elders. Another point of vast importance in the preparation for wor- ship is the cultivation of the spirit of love and forgiveness and charity toward our fellows. It is almost impossible to open suc- cessfully the door of the soul to God if that same door is shut and barred to some human brother. Prejudices, hardness of heart, spirit of grudge, invariably close the eye of the soul and keep the inward life in the shadow of eclipse from God. If you have hard feeling toward the person who sits across the aisle from you, it will be difiScult to break through the film and get the face-to-face experience with God. The cultivation of forgiveness, the practice of charity and large-heartedness, the atmosphere of love in the inward spirit, the shunning of prejudice as a deadly plague, are as essential to true worship as physical atmosphere is essential to breathing. This is one of the ways in which we can prepare for meeting and for worship. We can still further prepare by using as much time as possi- ble before religious services in meditation and prayer. Some have no time to sit down, to break away from the tasks of the morning and to collect the soul for its great ascent, but is it not possible to do this more or less well in the midst of necessary ac- tivity? To keep from being ruffled, to avoid being fussy and cum- bered with cares, to hold the inner helm true even amid cross- currents, may mean more than prayer and meditation do for those who have only to fold their hands and sit in sweet peace. In any case, whether we go to our worship from states of quiet and peace, or from scenes of busy activity, let us all remember that the one essential attitude is intention to seek, to find, to meet and to enjoy the infinite Comparison of our spirit. One who has never enjoyed the thrill of swimming has no adequate conception of what it means to be immersed in the cool water and buoyed up by its liquid mass. The unpracticed spectator watching the operation thinks of water as something in which you sink if you happen to fall into it. The swimmer, on the contrary, wonders how anybody ever sinks. Water seems to him made to swim in. It feels to him like a life-giving, life-renew- ing substance in which he finds himself at his physical best. Some- what so God seems to bathe and refresh the spirit of one who is bold enough to plunge into His deeps where real life begins. No wonder birds sing “in profuse strains of unpremediated art”! They have found their true element. They find the air not only buoyant, but invigorating. It raises life for them to its real glory. In God men find, too, their true element and atmosphere. All tired with the heavy effort of being good, suddenly the surge of a new force of life animates the soul, the labor ceases and the refreshed self feels carried on as though by invisible wings. — Commission on Evangelism, New York. The student-preachers are close enough to the small, struggling church in the over-churched communities to feel very strongly th« injustices imposed upon communities and upon religion by de- nominational rivalries. Surely the students are proud of their denominations. Every communion has a noble past and outstand- ing leaders. But the tragedy of competition, the duplication of ef- fort, the hypocrisy of excessive denominational pride and ex- cessive denominational pride and exclusiveness are too much for the young idealists. Not only do they say in their pronounce- ments, but they actually mean that some day denominational dis- tinctions must go. Had these young preachers authority, the day of their going would speedily arrive. This does not mean that they would insist upon uniformity among church members. Within the folds of almost any denom- ination are differences nearly as extreme as that of the Quaker and the Roman Catholic. Fundamentalists and Modernists and those with no formulated theology now sit in the same pews and worship in the same churches and why not? Where is there a church whose members are all agreed on theological issues? Cannot the group that is inclined to a formal, liturgical service have this service and yet consider itself an integral part of the larger church which includes those places where more emotional folk worship in evangelistic, informal services? Denominations have historic importance to be sure, and are not without advan- tages now, but the advantages do not warrant the keeping of these distinctions in the face of the harm they are producing and the younger preachers are iconoclastic enough to say so. — From Church Management. THE FUTURE OF PROHIBITION The election of Herbert Hoover need not be interpreted as a triumph of prohibition. A combination of reasons elected him. Probably the biggest single reason was the confidence which busi- ness had in his ability as an economic leader and an unwillingness to try a practical politician in the place of such a leader. But the election of Hoover does mean that for four years we will have a president friendly to the spirit of the 18th amendment and one who will seek to give honest law enforcement. But the defenders of prohibition are no longer united. The Anti-Saloon League has been losing friends. It is now a matter of open comment that prominent leaders affiliated with the com- mittee of one thousand discussed breaking with the league before the election. In just what respects this committee offers anything more constructive than the league we do not profess to know. There is a big reaction against the professional reformer in social life and, if it grows, it will certainly be as antagonistic to the Committee of One Thousand, led by Fred B. Smith, as it will be to the Anti-Saloon League, built on the genius of Wayne B. Wheeler. If you are hedged in, the surest way to win out is to keep up a good heart. » « « « Our young men are summoned by inheritance to a lofty type of self-reliance and manhood. If you have great sorrows keep them to yourself, unless you have some bosom friend that will listen to you with a sympathetic ear. THE COMMUNITY CHURCHMAN 16 NEWS OF THE COMMUNITY CHURCHES •' COMMUNITY CinmCH WOEKERS CONTEE The sales lodge of the Hoover Mann- facturing Co., of North Canton, Ohio, was the scene of an interesting two-day session of the erecutive committee of the Com- munity Church Workers of the U. S. A., March 12 and 13. William Hoover was host to the committee, and extended a gracious hospitality long to be remember- ed. The isolation from every form of dis- traction made possible two davs of inten- sive thought and debate. The spirit of the meetings was note- worthy. One may doubt that in all Ameri- ca a group of men could come together and have more keen debate than was held here, and yet reach more nearly unanimous conclusions. The item of largest importance was a proposed mode of cooperation with the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America and the Home Missions Coun- cil. The first draft of such a proposed agreement was subjected to considerable criticism by the members of the commit- tee. Paragraphs subjected to debate were these: “Each community where adjustments between the churches are being made by mergers, federations or otherwise shall be urged to adjust its situation by choosing that one of the evangelical denominations that is most agreeable to the majority of all the people.” “The Community Church Workers shall turn over to the Home Missions Council its secretary together with its budget of cash and pledges, and its financial con- stituency with its promise to continue its good oflSces in helping to secure funds for the supplemental budget of the home mis- sions council to cover the salary and ex- penses of Mr. Hargreaves.” The discussion revealed the fact that no one wished the Community Church Work- ers to abandon their autonomy, or to give up their financial independence. On this matter there was no difference of opinion. But on the matter of having a preferred plan of adjustment of church situations there was much difference of opinion. It became increasingly clear, however, that the Community Church Workers could not be committed to any program of church adjustment favoring the denominational type community church over all others. The speeches revealed a belief that this is a period of experimentation, and that each type of church should stand on its own feet. The following substitute basis of co- operation was on vote offered to the Fed- eral Council of Churches and the Home Mission Council: “Therefore be it resolved: “1. That we propose the following basis of cooperation between the Federal Coun- cil of Churches of Christ in America, the Home Missions Council and the Communi- ty Church Workers of the TJ. S. A. “2. There shall be established a joint committee of the Federal Council of Christ in America, the Home Missions Council and the Community Church Work- ers of the U. S. A., consisting of three members of each group. The functions of this committee shall be, “a. To study in cooperation with the Five Tear Program of Survey and Adjust- ment of the Home Missions Council the spiritual interests of individuals and communities of America with special ref- erence to the question, How can the churches — present and future — so work together as to produce the best spiritual results without competition and over- lapping of effort. “b. To make such recommendations to local communities and to state and na- tional ecclesiastical bodies as shall grow out of this study. “c. To follow up such recommendation by whatever means may seem wise to real- ize greater unity and effectiveness among the churches of America, recognizing first, last and all of the time the right of the community to determine the nature and the form of church, whether denominational or otherwise, which it will attend and sup- port. “3. The executive secretary of the Community Church Workers of the U. S. A. shall be designated Community Church Secretary of the Home Missions Council and the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America, with the following responsibilities. “a. Cooperation in the Five Year Program of Survey and Adjustment with particular responsibility for the adjust- ments to be made in local communities, following the survey, and shall be ex-of- ficio member of the joint committee of the five year program. “b. Participation in conferences and other educational programs looking to the cultivation of the cooperative spirit. “c. Corresponding secretary of the joint committee on community churches.” Dr. King, of the Home Missions Coun- cil, was present in person and many of the points were cleared up in informal con- versation relating to the freedom and au- tonomy of the Community Church Work- ers. The executive secretary will give only part of his time to the program of survey and adjustment, in order that the interests of the Community Church Workers may be served. The final draft of the resolution was sufiSciently cleared by discussion that it was adopted unanimously. The executive committee elected M. W. Van Tassell of Camden, N. Y., to serve the coming year, as financial secretary of the organization, giving a part time ser- vice for two thousand dollars a year. This action was taken in the light of the treasurer’s report which indicated that the receipts from sources other than two large donors had not been large enough to American Sunday School Union E.

The executive committee appointed a literature committee composed of Messrs Eastman, Piper and Grove. It is the plan of this committee to secure in certain magazines of national publication articles on the community church and that these shall afterwards be reprinted as pamphlets. The plan of the committee includes a pamphlet on “The Why and How of Com- munity Churches”, a pamphlet on benevo- lences for community churches, and a booklet on “Outgrowing our Confiicts. ” An important item of business was the creation of an administrative committee composed of five men which is to meet monthly or bi-monthly at its pleasure. This committee is empowered to act for the executive committee in the interim of its sessions, and keep in active touch with the work. This administrative committee is composed of Cliff Titus, Gilbert Counts, David E. Piper, Fred Eastman and Orvis F. Jordan. Three of these men are in the Chicago area and the meetings will be held in this area. The matter of the next biennial con- ference was considered, and a committee was appointed to arrange for the confer- ence.

Eallying Retreating Rural Churches A significant conference of the rural church leaders of all New England was held at the Twentieth Century club, Bos- ton, Jan. 28. Tlie town and country de-' partment of the Massachusetts federation of churches arranged the meeting. Twen- ty-seven sectional and national leaders, including ex-Governors Fuller of Massa- chusetts and Spaulding of New Hamp- shire, and Drs. Kenyon D. Butterfield and Warren H. Wilson, issued the call. The six New England states are clearly an organic whole, the three northern being agricultural; the southern, predominantly manufacturing. This unity has been recog- nized by the Conference for Rural Prog- ress, the Eastern States exposition and the New England council. Must not the religious forces do the same? The four- score who responded quickly proved that they were not mere theorists. Denom- inational secretaries, presidents of agri- cultural colleges and theological semin- aries, pastors of federated churches or “larger parishes,’’ all showed that they knew the facts, were doing things, and wanted to do more. ‘ ‘ The church situa- tion,’’ as revealed by surveys like that recently taken in New Hampshire, mighc be “deplorable’’; but that it is not hope- less was demonstrated by the actual achievements reported. One pastor had demonstrated poultry cooperatives and a blueberry farm. Another conducted a “Saturday school’’ which, through pa- tient visiting of families of every faith, includes “100 per cent of the children’’ in its membership. Rural Secretary Ken- neth C. MacArthur, of Massachusetts, be- sides aggressively pushing his field work and being often invited into other states, is pastor of a growing federated church and runs a farm of ten acres. These ef- forts are the more significant against the brightening background of an agriculture now on the up grade, in contrast with the situation in the west, or in the manufac- tories of New England. The discussions of the day resulted in the organization of a New England Town and Country com- mission, whose permanent membership will be delegations from the state federa- tions of churches or equivalent organiza- tions. Seminary Students I>eclare for Union Chicago is in point of numbers the great- est center for theological study in the United States, every one of the larger de- nominations having a considerable group of students. These form what is called the Diterseminary Group, which holds meetings from time to time. The Interseminary Group recently ap- pointed a committee on Church Union. This committee brought in a report which was unanimously adopted by these youn^ students for the ministry. The follomng is the text of their resolution; “Whereas the movement toward organic union in the churches of Christendom is rapidly gaining momentum, the commit- tee wishes to emphasize the following sig- nificant facts: 1. That denominational dividing lines are serving a less and less useful purpose. The intensity of the competition between de- nominations cripples the efBciency and spiritual vitality of the church in most communities. The present denominational system seriously hinders catholicity of Christian fellowship. “2. That the church is at present unable with united front to face the great nation- al and international problems of today. “3. That the increasing disparagement of Western Christianity on the mission fields where denominational conflicts are found, demands that a much more exten- sive organic union be effected. “Therefore we endorse with hearty ap- proval all agencies and movements work- ing toward cooperation and unity; such as tlie separate efforts toward intra and inter- denominational union, the Federal Council of Churches, the community church move- ment, the Home Missions Council, Good Will forums, inter-church schools of relig- ion, and all efforts toward inter-racial fel- lowship. The goal is not simply national but international union and ultimately and inevitably the democratic and organic uni- ty of the Church of Jesus Christ. “We therefore urge that all students definitely identify themselves with this movement so vital to the advancement of the Kingdom of God.’’ Winnetka Church Plans New Building Judged from the standpoint of mid- week activities, one of the most active churches in America calling itself a com- munity church is that at Winnetka, Illi- nois. This is a denominational type church connected with the Congregational denom- ination. A committee on constitution has been at work lately to further liberalize tlie plan of the church. It will be possi- ble for people in the church to give to oth- er than Congregational benevolences. The church has adopted a plan for a new building and it is expected that this new building will be under way sometime in the near future. Presbyterian Continue Pensions William H. Elges, a Presbyterian min- ister of Fairfax, Oklahoma, became con- vinced recently that he wished to enter the ministry of a fedearted church. He wrote the pension headquarters of his “Every Gift a Trust” It is sometimes assumed that Berea is maintained in part by State or sect. It receives not a cent from either source.

The ques- tion has been given an ofiScial answer by the pension department that if the federat- ed church will keep up its part of the sup- port of the department for the benefit of the minister, the minister may benefit by a Presbyterian pension. This is now the attitude of the Congregationalists and of the Disciples. Iowa Correspondent at Mayo’s Our readers will miss the notes of our Iowa correspondent this month. He is at the Mayo institution at Rochester, Minn., where Mrs. Johnson is under obervation. Mr. Johnson is editor of the town paper at Union and has faithfully sought to secure the news of the Iowa churches. He is a convinced community church man and a faithful worker. Our readers will join in the hope that very soon the present an- xiety in his household will be over and that his family may be well once more. Will Tour Europe and Palestine Prof. Fred Eastman, of Chicago Theo- logical Seminary, board member of Com- munity Church Workers, will spend the next six months touring Europe and Pal- estine. In Chicago he spends much of his time in journalism in connection with the Christian Century, and with the Chicago Theological Seminary Register. We think we recognize his facile pen in an editorial on the community church in the Christian Century of March 28. Will Run for Mayor Samuel R.

Elect Officers and Have Annual Reports Community church, of Grandview, la., held its annual business meeting recently and elected officers. The present member- ship of the church is 228. The Sunday school enrolment is 260. The Methodist church of the village, which was deeded to the community church, was enlarged at an expense of $10,000. All of this money has been paid in except $2,127, and this has been pledged. The Sunday school now has graded lessons. The pastor preaches a junior sermon and about twenty boys and girls remain for it. Holy week ser- vices were held by the minister. Good Ingathering at Easter Time Park Ridge, 111., community church had chairs in the aisles four of the five Sun- days in March. Sixteen children were re- ceived on profession of faith on Palm Sun- day and 2i3 adults by transfer on Easter Sunday. Three services were held on Easter morning to accommodate the peo- ple, these being held at 8, 9:30 and at 11. The local Masonic bodies were in attend- ance at the 9:30 service. An interesting feature of the church life these days is a series of lectures to an adult class on the psychology of religion given by Prof. Stev- ens, of Northwestern University. Information on Federated Churches The United States government has bul- letins both on the federated church and on the independent community church. The following are the number of people of dif- ferent denominations who are in federated churches: Congregationalist, 20,152; Meth- odist Episcopal, 13,861; Presbyterian U. S. A., 9,061; Baptists North, 5.375; Metho- dist Episcopal, South, 1,312; Presbyterian U. S., 1,087; Universalist, 1,080; Christian, 831; Disciples, 732; Unitarian, 644; Not reported above, 5,842. Are these figures to be used as indicating the relative in- terest in the practice of Christian union? If so, they have many surprises for us. Closes Pastorate at Warren, Ariz. Following a pastorate of two and a half years J. V. Bloom, of Community Church of Warren, Ariz., resigned the pastorate and closed his work March 31. During this period the church has paid off debts due to previous current expenses furnishings of building, the final payment of church building mortgage note, and al- so mortgage due on the parsonage to the presbytery of Southern Arizona. The presbytery deeded the house to the church on the payment of this mortgage. The church is entirely independent of denominational affiliation. It is situated in the Warren mining district, a district that includes Bisbee, Lowell, and Warren. Mr. Bloom has been actively connected with the life of the district. A member of the Chamber of Commerce, director of the Red Cross unit, and the local Welfare Association. He was at the time of leav- ing, president of the Ministerial Associa- tion.
