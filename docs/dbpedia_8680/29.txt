Eilís Dillon, one of Galway’s most prolific and versatile writers, who published some 50 titles, for children and adults, between 1948 and 1992, will be celebrated and remembered in a series of virtual events this year.

Ceiliúradh Eilís Dillon: Language, Landscape & Legacy is the first event in Galway Public Libraries’ Galway’s Great Read 2020 programme, celebrating the life, works, and legacy of Eilís Dillon.

The events are taking place as 2020 marks the centenary of her birth. The themes of her writing include island life on the Atlantic coast to her knowledge and love of language and folk tradition.

Ceiliúradh Eilís Dillon will be a virtual programme to ensure compliance with Covid-19 guidelines. The programme will include an online book club examining Dillon’s work; seminars exploring her Galway roots and place in Irish history; two new commissions which highlight her love of art and music - a visual art piece to celebrate her life and work and a music composition in response to one of her best known and highly regarded translated works, Caoineadh Airt Uí Laoghaire; and a children's tour, One Author, 5 Islands’, along the wild Atlantic way.
