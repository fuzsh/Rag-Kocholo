Eilis Dillon (1920-1994)

Respected Irish writer born in Galway on 7th March 1920. Lived in Ireland and Italy, and also California.

Like many writers on this website, she began writing at an early age. Her first books were written in Irish, although the majority of her work was in the English language, Her children's books are mainly set in Ireland, especially the Connemara coast, although a couple are based in Italy. Three of them are pony related, though most are general children's adventure stories. Her books were acclaimed for their strong Irish background of place, people and custom.

As well as children's books, Eilis also wrote adult novels and plays.

Collectors Info:

Island of Horses is by far the easiest one to find of the three and is usually found second hand in the Puffin paperback edition. There is however also a newer hardback edition available which is in print at the moment. The book can also be found quite easily in the USA. The Horse Fancier is quite hard to get hold of and may be expensive. It and Pony and Trap can be very hard to find in USA or indeed anywhere outside the UK.
