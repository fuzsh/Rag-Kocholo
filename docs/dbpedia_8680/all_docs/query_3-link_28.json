        "text": "Both The Butterfly Heart and The Sleeping Baobab Tree are set in different parts of Zambia. Despite it being many years since I have set foot in Zambia, the memories I have of the place are crisp and fresh in my mind: I remember the smell of the earth after a thunderstorm, the feel of the dirt underneath my feet, the heat of the sun on my skin, the intensity of the blue in the Zambian sky, the miles and miles of bush that we’d pass as we drove for three, sometimes four days to reach the coast of Kenya, the magic of growing an avocado tree from a pip and watching it fruit, the awareness we had of snakes as an ever present part of our lives. So many things, too many to list.\n\nWhen I was writing the books I was sitting in my writing room (blessed to have one) and looking out at a view that is beautiful – but not Zambian. Some of the time I was cold, other times mildly warm (!) but never overwhelmed by heat. Never looking for shade. Never wondering whether a scorpion had crept into the shoes I had left by the front door. Never moving away from the window to avoid lightning! So I wrote entirely from memory and I am glad my memories were sharp.\n\nAnd as a result, there were a number of things I learned along the way about setting and place in a book.\n\nFirst I spent a lot of time reminding myself that not everyone will know the place you are writing about as well as you do. So, assume nothing. This is hard for me as I tend to write short – so I had to repeatedly tell myself that there would be many people reading the book who have never been to Zambia, or in fact any part of Africa, so my task was to bring it alive for them. I had to find a way which would allow them to imagine that they were there, in Zambia, with the characters.\n\nSecondly, I needed avoid, where possible, long chunks of description – I needed to let the place emerge through the characters’ experience of it, otherwise it can become (courtesy of Elmore Leonard) the part that readers tend to skip. When I first started writing The Butterfly Heart I was so delighted to be stepping back into Zambia that my first few pages consisted of loving and detailed descriptions of the country. Kate Thompson (as in The New Policeman) said to me, ‘that’s all beautifully written Paula, but when are you going to start the story?’ Valid question – and I rewrote it. All those bits of description appear in the book, but scattered and seen through the eyes of the narrators. Sometimes the opening chapters are a warm-up for the writer that the reader never needs to see!\n\nThird, if you are writing for children, bring in the elements of place and setting that will capture their interest – elements that might amuse or startle or induce a sense of wonder. I was lucky in that I was writing from childhood memories – so I did not have an adult perspective on the place. I remembered what I loved about Zambia as a ten year old. It is sometimes hard to get into the head of a child if your memories are adult memories, but to reach the child, you have to.\n\nAnd, finally – try to choose a setting or place that you love. It will inform your writing and hopefully determine how your readers feel about it.\n\n(c) Paula Leyden\n\nThe Sleeping Baobab Tree is a funny, heartwarming story set in modern-day Zambia. One morning twelve-year-old Fred wakes up with an unaccountable sense of foreboding, which his friend Bul-Boo, one of the twins from next door, insists is just in his imagination. However, the feeling persists – and grows stronger when Fred’s terrifying great-granny, Nokokulu, asks him to accompany her on a trip to an ancient burial site known as the Place of Death. Then Bul-Boo overhears her parents talking about patients going missing from her mother’s AIDS clinic, and when one of the patients turns out to be Fred’s Aunt Kiki, the children suddenly view Nokokulu’s trip in a different light.\n\nCould the two events somehow be linked? As the three friends and the old woman journey into the heart of Zambia, each of them hopes to right wrongs, both past and present…but dark clouds are gathering and ancient magic is in the air.\n\nPaula Leyden’s “The Butterfly Heart”, was the winner of the 2012 Eilis Dillon First Novel Award."
