Ancestors of the surnames Le Dillon and Delyn began arriving in the British Isles at the onset of the Anglo-Norman invasion of the eleventh century. The British Anglicized the name, which resulted in a wide range of variant spellings. Dillian, Dillan, Dillow and Dillon can all be traced back to these original French names.\n\nIrish genealogists now regard this name as one hundred percent Irish. It can be found throughout Ireland and more than one county can claim it as an ancestral name. The most likely home, however, is Westmeath County, a.k.a. Dillons County.\n\nIt would be difficult to chart the migration of Dillons to America. One man, Luke Dillian, who arrived in American in 1710, is thought to be the father of the Dillons in early Pennsylvania and North Carolina. The Dillons, and their variants surnames, began arriving in the early 18th century, increasing their numbers over the years, before reaching a peak during the Irish potato famines of the mid-1800s.\n\nBy 1790, when the first U.S. federal census was taken, 21 Dillon families were living in America in six states. Three Dillons lived in Maryland with the largest numbers in North Carolina.\n\n● ● ●\n\nEARLY MARYLAND DILLONS\n\n1790 Census\n\nJohn Dillon Baltimore County\n\nJames Dillon Baltimore County\n\nWilliam Dillon Frederick County\n\n1800 Census\n\nNo Dillons were living in Frederick County\n\n(I found no census report for Baltimore County)\n\nWilliam Dillon (all related) Caroline County\n\n1 son 10-16, him 16-26, wife 16-26, 2-daughters under10 yrs\n\nVincent Dillon (all related) Caroline County\n\n2 sons u10, him 26-45, wife 26-45, daughter 10-16\n\nJohn Dillon (all related) Caroline County\n\nlisted himself only 16-26 years\n\n1810 Census\n\nJames Dillon Baltimore, City\n\nElenor D. Dillon Baltimore, Delaware\n\nOHIO DILLONS\n\n* * * * *\n\nIn its early years, the state of Ohio mirrored the growth of Dillons nationally. In 1810, for example, there were no Dillons present in the Ohio census. By the time Monroe County was formed in 1815, they began entering the state from the east. By 1820, the census of that year indicated 77 different families of Dillons were residing throughout most of the state.\n\nProperty records indicated Dillons began purchasing land in Monroe County in 1832. The first Monroe County census, which included Dillon surnames, was 1840. Three families of Dillons were living in Seneca, Perry and Franklin Townships. By 1850, seven different families of Dillons existed in almost every township of the county.\n\nThe descendents of the Franklin Township Dillons have a well-chronicled history*. They migrated from Pennsylvania to Ohio in 1835. Vincent Dillon, the patriarch, purchased 39 acres of land in Monroe County in 1833. He spent 12 years in Monroe County, producing seven of his thirteen children there. He later moved to Lawrence County, Ohio.\n\nOur ancestral Dillons were originally from Maryland. They migrated west through either Pennsylvania or Virginia before settling in Guernsey County, Ohio. Sometime between 1850  1860 the next descending generation moved to Perry Township in Monroe County.\n\n* - www.lawrencecountyohio.com/families/a_e/dillon1.htm\n\n* - http://worldconnect.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?db=dillon\n\n1820 Ohio Census\n\nGuernsey County\n\nHenry Dillon  Derry Twp.\n\nJane Dillon  Oxford Twp.\n\n(She was probably a Widow)\n\n1830 Ohio Census\n\nGuernsey County\n\nLondonderry Township\n\nHenry Dillon\n\nChristopher Dillon\n\nOxford Township\n\nJohn Dillon\n\nWilliam Dillon\n\n1840 Ohio Census\n\nBeaver Twp.

I believe his name was Henry Dillon. He migrated to Ohio between 1810-1815 and died about 1840 in Guernsey County, Ohio. According to the census report of 1830, his wife was born between 1780-90 as well. Also listed on the census report was a man between 60-70 years of age. It would appear that this man was the father of either Henry or his wife. Thus, he was born between 1760-70.\n\nI was curious if Henry may have moved directly to Ohio. The 1810 U.S. census report indicated four men by the name of Henry Dillon existed, none of whom lived in Maryland. Each lived in a different location.\n\n1. Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, age 26-44  four boys.\n\n2. Hopewell Twp. of Washington County, Pennsylvania, age 26-44  2 boys and 2 girls.\n\n3. Franklin County, Virginia, age 26-44, three boys and one girl.\n\n4. Prince Edward County, Virginia, age 26-44, one boy and one girl.\n\nHenry Dillon of Washington County, Pennsylvania was the only man who had children of similar ages to Henry Dillon of Guernsey County, Ohio. If he was our ancestor, he must have migrated west from Maryland about 1800, settled in Pennsylvania, then moved to Ohio a few years later. Washington County, Pennsylvania is geographic on a straight line east of Monroe County, Ohio.\n\nCHILDREN OF UNKNOWN DILLON\n\nUnknown daughter, born bet. 1810-15\n\nJohn Dillon, born 1815\n\nUnknown daughter, born bet. 1816-21\n\nUnknown son, born bet. 1816-21\n\nMartin Dillon, born 1823\n\nUnknown son, born bet. 1825-30\n\nUnknown daughter, born bet. 1825-30\n\nJOHN DILLON\n\nJOHN DILLON was born on 2 August 1815 in Guernsey County, Ohio. He lived in Williamsburg of Beaver Township for the census years of 1840 and 1850. John moved to Monroe County after 1850 and had established a home in Perry Township before 1860. He lived in Monroe County from that point until his death on 12 March 1892 in Greenbrier, Perry Township. He was 76. John married Margaret Johnson between 1835 and 1840. She was born 2 March 1817 in Brooklyn, New York. Margaret died on 25 February 1895 in Greenbriar, Perry Township. They are buried at the Greenbriar Cemetery in Perry Township.\n\nCENSUS REPORTS FOR JOHN DILLON\n\n1840 Ohio Census\n\nBeaver Twp., Guernsey County\n\nno date listed\n\nNo children\n\n1850 Ohio Census\n\nBeaver Twp., Guernsey County\n\n21 August 1850\n\n1860 Census\n\nMonroe County, Perry Twp\n\n20 July 1860\n\n1870 Census\n\nMonroe County, Perry Twp.\n\n29 June 1870\n\n1880 Census\n\nMonroe County, Perry Twp.\n\n21 June 1880\n\nCHILDREN OF JOHN AND MARGARET DILLON\n\nHENRY DILLON\n\nHENRY DILLON was born in 1840.

She married William Wilcox on 29 December 1869.\n\nJACKSON DILLON\n\nHe was two years of age according to the 1850 census. He must have died young because I saw no record of him in 1860.\n\nMARTIN DILLON\n\nMARTIN DILLON was born in Guernsey County, Ohio in 1849. He died on 19 September 1923 in Monroe County. He married Susan Lippincott on 11 April 1872.\n\nSUSAN ANN DILLON\n\nSUSAN DILLON was born in 1852. She died on 17 March 1897 in Perry Township, Monroe County, Ohio.

Susan was born in 1861.\n\nHENRY DILLON\n\nHENRY DILLON was born on 17 March 1840 in Guernsey County, Ohio. He died on 19 October 1907 in Graysville, Ohio. He is buried at the Greenbriar Cemetery in Perry Township, Monroe County. Henry was married twice.\n\nMilitary Notes on Henry Dillon\n\nHenry enlisted in the military during the Civil War. He fought with the 7th (West) Virginia Regiment Infantry which was organized in the summer and fall of 1861. Henrys regiment was involved with the pursuit of General Robert E. Lee from 3-9 April 1865 that culminated in his surrender at Appomattox Court House on 9 April. He was discharged in June of 1865. ( See attached pages at the end of this chapter)\n\nMARGARET ANN (UNKNOWN)*\n\nHenry Dillon married Margaret Unknown in Monroe County about 1861. She was born on 14 April 1846 and died 28 December 1867. She was only 21 years old when she died. She is buried at the Greenbriar Cemetery in Perry Township.\n\n· Richard Schumacher believes her maiden name was Margaret Ann Stine.\n\nCHILDREN OF HENRY AND MARGARET DILLON\n\nJohn L.

Elizabeth was born on 2 September 1840 in Washington County. She died of heart failure on 14 November 1929 in Perry Township, Monroe County. Elizabeth was the daughter of Samuel Lippincott and Elenor Conley. Henry and Elizabeth (Lippincott) were witnesses for the marriage of their son Martin Van Buren Dillon and Tamer Anne McGilton. She was buried at Greenbrier Cemetery on 17 November.\n\n● ● ●\n\n1870 Census\n\nMonroe County, Perry Twp.\n\n29 June 1870\n\nDillon, Henry 30 Ohio\n\n(Henry was living alone, next door to his father John)\n\n1880 Census\n\nMonroe County, Perry Twp\n\n21 June 1880\n\n1900 Census\n\nMonroe County, Washington Twp.\n\n14 June 1900\n\nCHILDREN OF HENRY AND ELIZABETH DILLON\n\nSarah F.

He died on 11 November 1958 in Hemet, Riverside County, California. He is buried at the San Jacinto Cemetery in San Jacinto. Martin was married twice.\n\nMartin married Tamer Ann McGilton on 3 July 1902 in Monroe County. Tamer was born on 19 November 1883 in Washington Township, Monroe County. She died on . She is buried alongside her parents, George and Sarah, at the Pleasant Ridge Cemetery. Tamer was about three months pregnant when the couple married. It is very possible this was a shotgun wedding. Especially since the marriage took place on Martins birthday. The marriage produced one daughter.\n\nGoldie Mae Dillon, born 23 December 1902\n\nNotes on Martin Van Buren Dillon\n\nAfter Tamer died, Martin remarried to Lura Jane Holland on 5 January 1905. The marriage produced one son, Ellswell Epthworth Dillon. After Ellswell was born, they moved from Monroe County to Texas. They homesteaded for a while, then, in 1907, moved to California. I located a census record confirming they lived in Santa Barbara County, California in 1910. The 1920 census they were living in Nevada. Martin appeared under the name Dillion in Cibola Valley of Yuma County. They owned land along the Colorado River and were forced to sell their land to make way for the Boulder Dam (1920 or 1921). In 1921 they had established residency in Hemet. Martin remained in Hemet till his death in 1958.\n\nNotes on Lura Jane (Holland) Dillon\n\nLura was born in Marietta, Ohio on 20 April 1880. She died on 20 April 1963 in Hemet, California. She was the daughter of Arins Holland and Eliza Smith. Lura had one daughter, Freeda, from a previous relationship. I check the records in Washington County and found no marriage or birth associated with Lura. Her daughter, Freeda Marie, was born on 16 February 1901 with the surname of Moore. I saw no indication that Freeda lived with her mother during any of the census reports. How she arrived from Ohio to California is a mystery I have yet to solve. Freeda died on 22 May 1988 in Escondido, in suburban San Diego, California under her married name of Thixton.\n\nNotes on Ellswell Dillon\n\nEllswell, a.k.a. Ellsworth, was born on 12 November 1905 in Monroe County and died on 19 November 1994 in Fontana, California. Ellswell married Molly (?) in 1927. They had one daughter, Patricia D., who was born in December of 1928. I located Ellswell and his family in the 1930 census living in Hemet. The Obituaries of both Martin and Lura, indicated they died in the home of Ellswell, who was living in Hemet. After the death of his parents, he moved to Fontana where he died in 1994. Ellswell also used his initials (E.E.). I located him in the Social Security Death Index as E.E. Dillon.\n\nGOLDIE MAE DILLON\n\nGOLDIE DILLON was born on 23 December 1902 in Perry Township, but was raised on Pleasant Ridge, Washington Township. She died on 10 June 1986 at the Barnesville Hospital. Her body was cremated. Goldie married Orville, a.k.a. Ross, Williams on 16 May 1925 at the Monroe County Court House. Ross was born on 16 June 1898 in Wayne Township, Monroe County. He died on 5 September 1981 in Marietta, Ohio. Ross is buried at the Oak Lawn Cemetery in Woodsfield, Ohio. Goldie and Ross were married 56 years.\n\nNotes on Goldie Mae Dillon\n\nGoldies mother died when she was only four months old. The only possession of her mothers Goldie had, was a lock of her hair. She was raised by her grandparents, George and Elizabeth McGilton, appearing in the 1920 census, age 17, living in the household of George McGilton. She remained in their home till she married in 1925. Goldie spent her entire life in Monroe County. Goldie met Ross while attending church. They later sat together, which Goldie considers their first official date.\n\nCHILDREN OF GOLDIE AND ROSS WILLIAMS\n\nWanda Lee Williams, born 26 March 1930\n\nShirley Mae Williams, born 24 February 1936\n\nSOURCES\n\nI contacted officials in Guernsey, Monroe and Washington Counties in Ohio and Riverside County in California to obtained via census reports, probate court records and county health departments. Books of marriage records for Monroe and Washington Counties were used to confirm marriages that took place through 1917. I used genealogy websites to exchange information with others researching the Dillon name.\n\nProvided by:Steve McPeek"
