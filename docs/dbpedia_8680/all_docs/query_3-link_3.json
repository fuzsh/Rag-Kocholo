        "text": "November 6, 2022\n\nYounger readers, maybe all readers, are always attracted to stories about islands, especially if no one else knows about them. Here, the island is a legendary “lost” island, off Ireland, which only a few can find. That means someone will be searching for that island for good and someone will be searching for that island for evil, in a very Robert Louis Stevenson adventure.\n\nTaking place in the 1950s, the hero of the story is young Michael, a rural lad who helps his mother keep the family farm going, as his father has been missing since he went in search of Inishmanann, the Lost Island. Michael believes that somehow, some way, his father is still alive but as a lad of the earth, he has no way to follow via the sea. But Michael does have a friend who comes from a seafaring tradition, so eventually they begin an adventure on the waves. However, two local adults are also obsessed with the hard-to-find island, because they believe there is buried treasure to be found. Michael and his allies must outwit the bad dudes to be successful, but it may be a very close call.\n\nAlthough Michael is fourteen years old, I would place this book in the Middle Grade genre, as it’s a quicker read than most teen books and it really falls into the adventure style most boys admire. In the 1950s, boys had so much more freedom than they do now, so if the reader can get past any hesitation of children going on the ocean without parental guidance, the result will be a rip-roaring ride that never stops.\n\nI certainly enjoyed it, especially the idea of an island that only a few have seen and only a few can find. This isn’t the real-life island of Inishmaan, off Galway, but one that has lived in legend. The characters are average kids, so I also thought that was wonderful. I have grown tired of stories about children who believe they are special, just because their overbearing parents told them they were. Not here. It’s quite the fun book and a good choice for young boys who want an adventure on the sea.\n\nBook Season = Spring (expected breezes)\n\nJanuary 5, 2011\n\nAnother rip-roaring adventure (a la Robert Louis Stevenson) by Eilis Dillon that takes place on the Irish sea coast perhaps 100 years ago. Ms. Dillon both writes non-stop action (kidnapping! smuggling! theft!) geared toward boys but also preserves old Irish history and legend. She really makes one feel as if they were there and as if they now understand sailing and Irish village life.\n\nJanuary 18, 2017\n\nI thought this book would be more like Treasure Island, but actually, it felt a little more like Swallows and Amazons, with some bad guys added for general excitement! It was written in the 1950s by an author who previously mostly wrote in Irish and her style is clean and simple, but she's great at setting the scene and building characters with a few swift strokes. The story takes place in a small, struggling fishing village on the Atlantic coast of Ireland and involves a couple of kids taking to the sea to try to find one's dad, who disappeared while trying to find a \"hidden\" island. Very much a page-turner! Logan liked it almost as much as he liked Treasure Island and Swallows and Amazons. Apparently, Dillon wrote 30 books for children. This was has been out of print for decades and republished by the New York Review of Books. I'm hoping to find the other NYRB republication of hers, The Island of the Horses, although the plot lines sound rather similar. In fact, many of her books seem to be about mysterious islands!\n\nSeptember 9, 2016\n\nA deeply enthralling children's adventure set on and off the Galway coast. A missing father, legendary treasure, hard-bitten rogues, danger on land and on sea, all told with realism and romance, written with beautiful clarity and perfectly-crafted prose, a vivid portrayal of Irish rural life and coastal and village fishing communities and lovely illustrations by Richard Kennedy. Some of the story-telling conventions creak a bit, but the writing raises this book several levels, this is surely a classic of children's literature.\n\nJune 6, 2012\n\nAn exciting adventure story about the small islands off the coast of Ireland. Very well-written and a fun read. NYRB Children's Collection.\n\nJanuary 5, 2018\n\nA great seafaring story - it has a bit of the amateur sailor and pirate aspects that would make it a good successor to Peter Duck.\n\nOne oddity - p.177 has dialogue attributed to Joe, Mike, my father, Michael, and I. But there are only four people present (and the first-person narrator has been Michael). Why? Also, we had to have a Mike and a Michael? Were there no other names available in all of Ireland?\n\nAugust 28, 2019\n\nOh yeah! This was great fun! I would have loved it when I was 10 and I loved it now. Clean, fast paced, with just the right amount of rough action. I really loved the independence of the boys and their confident decision making and the cast of character surrounding them that helped them on their journey. A real exercise in triaging threats and staying fast on your feet. Perfect adventure book for quiet evenings.\n\nJune 13, 2008\n\nGreat tale of a boy who goes to sea to find his father on an island. Kind of Joan Aikenish. Good use of language.\n\nNovember 15, 2020\n\nI re-read this book, stashed away in our family holiday home for 45 years and was surprised how much I enjoyed it. An adventure story set on the Irish coast - the narrator Michael gets news of his father, who vanished after sailing away four years earlier to find a lost island and the treasure rumoured to be on it. Michael teams up with the ward of a local fisherman, Joe and together they\n\nmanage to secure a boat and go in search of him. They overcome many challenges and thwart those who are set on snatching the treasure, whatever it may be, for themselves.\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\nGreat children's book full of intrigue, mystery, and of course, treasure! It reminded me of an old fashioned Disney movie or Hardy Boys mystery. I also enjoyed how it was set in Ireland and I would now like to read more books by Eilis Dillon including, the Island of Horses. Plus, these New York Review Children's Books are so beautiful. I want to collect them all!\n\nApril 2, 2018\n\nA great adventure yarn. Having visited Ireland and the islands off its coast I was transported back to those rocky shores. Great characters, wonderful sense of place, engaging writing, a real page turner. A great boys book. Not my favorite kind of story, but it really kept my attention.\n\nRead\n\nJune 3, 2020\n\na fun high seas adventure, with more lost than island\n\nMay 16, 2015\n\nA fun book, though I think that I would have enjoyed it even more if I had brushed up on Irish folklore before reading it. It does contain references specific to the folklore of this region, but the story is still enjoyable for those who don't share this background.\n\nThe story follows Michael Farrell's search for his father, who had been missing for four years after setting out for The Lost Island and the treasure it holds. Along the way he and Joe fend off greedy villains, meet a new friend and travel companion (Mike), and brave rough seas on their quest.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed this book, I do think of it as a boy's adventure story. The female characters are few and far between. At first I was concerned by the portrayal of Michael's mother, an overly trusting who sometimes seemed younger than Michael. I was relieved later on by a portrayal of a strong woman from Fort Island, owner of a public house, as it provided some balance.\n\nOverall, this is a nice suspenseful sailing adventure. While there are some violent scenes, they are not graphic and they go by quickly."
