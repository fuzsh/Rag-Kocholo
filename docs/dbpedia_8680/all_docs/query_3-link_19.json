        "text": "This paper is an insight into Jane Austen's sharp observation and judgement of characters based on social behavior as depicted in Pride and Prejudice. Jane Austen belonged to an educated family with noble ties. She was deeply influenced by the Industrial Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars which impacted the social life of Regency England in the late 18 th and early 19 th century. The Industrial Revolution proved to be a blessing in disguise for the middle class especially the traders and merchants who earned a great fortune because of industrialization which in turn stirred their desire to climb the social ladder and mingle with the upper class. Besides the social turmoil, Jane Austen's focus in the novel is marriage and courtship. Her characters belong to the upper and middle class in the novel Pride and Prejudice. The ambition of her characters at the personal level in finding an ideal man coupled with social aspirations of being acquainted and recognized as the upper class has been projected by Austen through the use of humour, satire, and wit. The social behavior of her characters, the dialogues and social interactions between them in the novel is a reflection of their class. Her novels are often identified as the novel of manners. Jane Austen critiques the social customs and norms of Regency England and is famous for her commentaries on the British landed gentry of Regency England which is evident in her novel 'Pride and Prejudice'. Jane Austen has been primarily recognized for her satire on social realism in the novel. She acknowledges the importance of noble inheritance and money but her judgement of characters in the novel is not based on social class alone but identifies the class as being directly proportional to social etiquettes and mannerisms of her characters.\n\nHence Elizabeth certainly suffers from pride and prejudice, but this is no less an ailment of Darcy as well. Darcy has to overcome his preconceived ideas about Elizabeth's inferior looks and class in order to concede she is handsome, eloquent, and very witty and intelligent â€“ his equal in intelligence, if not in possessions. Class distinctions are then exposed to be illusions and minor barriers to true love because it is she who captivates him with her wit, honesty and intelligence rather than all the simpering fawners who throw themselves at him and defer to him simply by virtue of his looks and fortune. Pride and Prejudice is thus a novel about the overcoming of these vices of pride and prejudice in the protagonists Elizabeth and Darcy in order to encounter true love."
